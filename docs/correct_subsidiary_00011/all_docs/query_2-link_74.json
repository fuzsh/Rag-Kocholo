        "text": "Tech Data Named To Exclusive Compaq Distributor Alliance Program\n\nCLEARWATER, FL (May 10, 1999) - As part of a landmark computer industry development, Tech Data Corporation was selected today as one of four North American distribution partners for Compaq Computer Corporation's exclusive Distributor Alliance Program. Compaq currently distributes its build-to-order commercial business desktop, portable and server products as well as options in North America through 39 different distributors with a total of more than 100 stocking locations.\n\nThe consolidation to four distributors, which will begin in August, will decrease the number of Compaq distribution sites by 70 percent. This will enable Compaq resellers to receive significantly better availability and more predictable delivery of products while reducing overall inventory levels and driving out inefficiencies in the supply chain.\n\n\"Compaq's decision to centralize their distribution will bring more focus and cohesion to its channel strategy and its Customer Choice program,\" commented Anthony A. IbargÃ¼en, Tech Data's president and chief operating officer. \"Tech Data is well-positioned to enable a smooth transition for Compaq and our resellers with our industry-leading on-site FactoryDirect PLUS program, scalable logistics and custom configuration infrastructure, complete North American geographic coverage and overall service capability.\"\n\nTech Data's FactoryDirect services have been in place at Compaq's Houston facility since April 1998, enabling Tech Data to immediately ship Compaq systems as they are manufactured. This eliminates time and touches in the delivery cycle as well as the need to stock higher inventory levels to meet forecasted demand. Tech Data recently took this service a step further with its FactoryDirect PLUS program, adding custom configuration services at the Houston facility so it can integrate components, peripherals and software from its comprehensive offering of more than 75,000 SKUs.\n\nAdditionally, resellers can custom-configure Compaq solutions online via Tech Data's TDXpert tool with built-in support for Compaq's channel assembly program. Available via Tech Data's award-winning Web site, resellers can use TDXpert to quickly check component compatibility, build custom system configurations, access pricing and availability, and place orders.\n\nTech Data's Private Label Delivery capabilities also give resellers the flexibility and cost savings of shipping Compaq products direct to end users while fully retaining their brand identity on shipping labels and packing documents.\n\n\"We chose Tech Data for the Distributor Alliance Program because of their logistics innovation as well as their overall capacity, economies of scale and firm strategic commitment,\" said Mike Pocock, Compaq's vice president of North American channels. \"Tech Data has been a terrific business partner and will now have an opportunity to play an even bigger role in our future.\"\n\nTo support Compaq-authorized resellers, Tech Data offers the following programs and services:\n\nCompaq-dedicated Resources\n\nSales\n\nGovernment business\n\nProduct marketing\n\nTechnical support (pre and post sales)\n\nSystem engineers (solutions design)\n\nProduct authorization\n\nMarketing services\n\nTech Data/Compaq Programs\n\nFactoryDirect/FactoryDirect PLUS\n\nCompaq Channel Configuration Program (CCP) - Channel Assembly\n\nCompaq Configure to Order Program (CTO)\n\nPartnerDirect (recently announced Prosignia fulfillment initiative)\n\nCompaq Business Center (Dedicated Compaq site within Tech Data Web site www.techdata.com/business/compaq.)
