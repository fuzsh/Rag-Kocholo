        "text": "Bangkok--Feb 5--Compaq Computer\n\n…Largest acquisition in the history of the computer industry will deliver global services and support, best of breed partnerships, and unique leadership products for enterprise customers…\n\nCompaq Computer Corporation (NYSE: CPQ) and Digital Equipment Corporation (NYSE: DEC) today announced the completion of a definitive merger agreement. As Compaq continues its drive to become the global leader in enterprise computing solutions, this latest acquisition greatly accelerates its momentum and strengthens its value proposition to customers.\n\n“We put tremendous value on the customer relationships Digital has cultivated over the past 40 years.\n\nWe are committed to supporting these key customer relationships by investing in Digital’s strategic assets, particularly its worldwide service organization, as well as its 64-bit leadership with Alpha microprocessors, OpenVMS, Digital UNIX and Windows NT enterprise systems, open storage and software products,” said Eckhard Pfeiffer, president and CEO, Compaq.\n\n“Digital’s focused enterprise strategy coupled with demonstrable improvements in operational performance make this a timely choice for us,” Pfeiffer said. In Digital’s recently reported second quarter, profits doubled and the company experienced tremendous growth in its target markets.\n\nThe transaction will be the largest acquisition in the history of the computer industry, valued at $9.6 billion based on the January 23, 1998 closing price of Compaq common stock. Under the terms of the transaction, shareholders of Digital will receive $30 in cash and approximately 0.945 shares of Compaq common stock for each share of Digital stock. Compaq will issue approximately 150 million shares of Compaq common stock and $4.8 billion of cash. Under the terms of the agreement, Digital will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Compaq.\n\n“The combined companies will provide significant economic value growth for our shareholders,” said Earl Mason, chief financial officer of Compaq. “In addition, the combination will be accretive within a year, meeting all of Compaq’s economic tests.”\n\n“This merger gives Digital tremendous reach and credibility in the marketplace,” said Digital Chairman Robert B. Palmer. “It gives us the scale and resources to make continued investments in our key technologies and services. Customers will benefit from the very complementary strengths of both companies. For example, together we will offer customers the greatest concentration of enterprise Windows NT products and lifecycle services available in the market today.”\n\nPfeiffer said the combination achieves Compaq’s stated goal of becoming one of the top three global IT companies. More importantly, it creates a new breed of enterprise leader; one committed to delivering high customer value through standards-based, partner-leveraged computing that features world class lifecycle services and support, market-segment focused solutions, particularly communications, manufacturing and finance, and enterprise technology excellence.\n\nThe combined company will create the largest channel network in the world delivering over 80 percent of its products and solutions to customers. Compaq’s field resources will continue to complement the strong reseller channel, focusing on building enduring customer relationships worldwide. These resources include individuals dedicated to pre-sales and sales account management, professional and consulting services and global service and support.\n\nThe acquisition of Tandem Computers in 1997 extended the company’s addressable market with high-end, mission-critical solutions and doubled the sales and service field resources. In 1998, the Compaq/Digital/Tandem combination further strengthens the focus on creating competitive advantage for enterprise customers by delivering the widest range of technology based solutions from hand-helds, notebooks, desktop computers, workstations, servers; high-end servers based on the 64-bit Alpha architecture and highly available and scalable NonStop systems.\n\nSubject to the approval of Digital’s shareholders as well as clearance under antitrust laws and other customary closing conditions, the transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 1998.\n\nCompany Backgrounds Compaq Computer Corporation, a Fortune 100 company, is the fifth largest computer company in the world and the largest global supplier of personal computers, delivering useful innovation through products that connect people with people and people with information.
