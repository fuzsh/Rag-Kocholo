COMPAQ Computer Corporation announced yesterday that it is to take over Digital Equipment Corporation in a $9.6bn deal that will create the second-largest computing company in the world.

Digital will become a subsidiary of Compaq following what analysts said was the largest acquisition in the history of the computer industry.

Compaq is already the largest maker of PCs in the world, but the buyout moves it into the higher-margin server business and Digital's Alpha microprocessors. The deal is expected to mean lay-offs and a management shake-up in America.

London-based industry analyst Philip Williams said: ``It will be difficult to justify having two management organisations in place and the Compaq style is more aggressive than the Digital style, so there are cultural differences.

``There will certainly be areas where the two organisations can't co-exist,'' he added. Under the terms of the transaction Digital shareholders will receive $30 in cash and 0.945 share of Compaq common stock for each Digital share.

The move is in line with Compaq's stated goal of becoming one of the top three global IT companies.

Digital chairman Robert Palmer said: ``Customers will benefit from the complementary strengths of both companies.''

President of Compaq Eckhard Pfeiffer said his company would invest in Digital's service business, its Alpha chip technology, as well as servers and software.
