        "text": "wow ! 30 years! I had a street truck (Datsun 620) many years ago.I think you guys used to host or sponser the Mini Truck Nationals? My truck placed 2nd in the 2x4 class in 1980 and 81. You guys have done well! Congrats!\n\nWell thank you for the kind words! We could have never have done it with out great customers like yourselves. And yes we used to sponsor the Mini Truck Nationals, we love giving back to the customers and the community. Let me know if there is any thing you guys ever need and I will see if I can cook up some \"RDC member\" special price for the parts you guys need.\n\nNick\n\nI was under the impression that you guys were all about slammed old school mini's but I took the time to check out your website and see you guys cover everything. You guys have one hell of an inventory of parts. I was gonna say that I wish I knew about you guys when I had my old Toyota Pickup but see you have an inventory search for my Tundra! I will definitely consider your company when I move back to So Cal.\n\nI was under the impression that you guys were all about slammed old school mini's but I took the time to check out your website and see you guys cover everything.

I will definitely consider your company when I move back to So Cal.\n\nYea, some people get that impression from us because our name is California \"Mini-Trucks.\" But we carry every thing from 1964 Datsun 320 or Toyota Hilux parts all the way up to 2009 Titan beds, Frontier front clips, Tacomas, Tundras, 4 Runners and even XTerras. We also help every community out there including the dragging lowered trucks from SunSet, to they rock crawlers up at the Hammers and in Azusa, and to the open desert racing with helping my man Dan Vance in his slick RN80 style Toyota pick up with a 06 XRunner V6 4.0L 6spd drive train. We also cater to many shops including SOLO Motor sports, Engaged Off-Road, LC Engineering and long time friends and customers Total Chaos Fabrication. We are all over the place, we literally help any one and every one!\n\nWell thank you for the kind words! We could have never have done it with out great customers like yourselves.
