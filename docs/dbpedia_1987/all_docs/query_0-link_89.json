        "text": "Bagpipes blare as Alli Walker struts onto the stage, her cowboy boots kicking up dust in Nashville’s honky-tonk haven. This isn’t your typical country music entrance, but then again, Walker isn’t your typical country artist. The Prince Edward Island native has carved out a unique niche in the industry, blending traditional twang with pop-rock sensibilities and a dash of Celtic flair. With her latest single “Dirt On Us” climbing the charts and a social media following nearing 800,000, Walker’s self-dubbed “bra country” is turning heads and winning hearts across the globe. As she gears up for a hometown headlining show in PEI, Walker sits down to discuss her musical evolution, creative process, and the exciting road ahead.\n\nWalker’s journey from small-town Canada to Music City USA is a testament to her resilience and innovative spirit. “This one was one of the first I ever wrote when I was newly signed to a publishing deal here in Nashville at Sony Music Publishing,” Walker reveals about her latest hit, “Dirt On Us.” The song’s genesis showcases her collaborative prowess and songwriting skills. “We came up with that on the spot. There’re other concepts of ‘dirt on us,’ especially in the country world, but there was no concept where it was like small town rumors thinking they know what’s up with your relationship, but really it’s only the stars and the moon and the truck bed and the boots that know and have the real dirt on us.”\n\nThe inspiration for Walker’s songs often comes from unexpected places, proving her versatility as a songwriter. Her track “Creek” found its genesis in an unlikely source: reality television. “After a long day of writing songs or work or shows, I love watching trash TV. So, The Bachelorette, Love Island, Love is Blind. I love all of those silly shows,” Walker admits. “My husband and I were watching Love Island one day, and a guy on a previous season called, his name is Rob. He actually said this to a girl. He was, like, a very country guy, and he was talking to a girl that was really city, and he was like, ‘I’d love to get you in the creek.’ Meaning, like, make her more country and show him what he’s all about.”\n\nWalker’s unique brand of country music, which she playfully dubs “bra country,” is a refreshing take on the genre. “I am very much like a girl version of bro country. I call my music bra country, so I love all my Morgan and the Hardy and Luke Bryan, Luke Combs,” she explains. This distinctive style has resonated with fans and industry professionals alike, leading to viral moments and unexpected collaborations. One such instance involved a catfish at a Nashville Predators game. “I was playing at the arena, like, during the periods, so, like, the cameras that you would watch at home, you wouldn’t see me. It’s just for the arena. And I was like, I mentioned catfish in Creek. The second line of the chorus is ‘catch you like a catfish.’ So, we’re like, maybe we can do something for social media for me with the catfish.”\n\nThe catfish incident led to an unexpected viral moment for Walker. “I didn’t realize that they were actually going to get, like, the full, you know, ESPN TSN four snack crew in to take this video. But they, like, cut from commercial early, watched me drink this beer, and then it went viral immediately,” she recounts. This blend of music and spontaneous moments has become a hallmark of Walker’s career, endearing her to fans and setting her apart in the crowded country music landscape.\n\nWalker’s love for trucks, a staple in country music, inspired one of her recent hits. “I love big trucks. I’ve always been a truck girl. Like, my dream. I’ve never had a dream car, like a Porsche or something. I always just wanted a ram truck because my dad loved rams growing up,” she shares. This passion led to the creation of “I Like Big Trucks,” a clever play on Sir Mix-a-Lot’s “Baby Got Back.” The song’s conception demonstrates Walker’s ability to blend humor, nostalgia, and country themes. “We wrote it, and that’s been really fun to post online and see the reaction. And we actually got Sir Mix-a-Lot’s blessing, and he’s technically a songwriter on ‘I Like Big Trucks.'”\n\nThe creative process behind Walker’s music is a blend of structured songwriting sessions and spontaneous inspiration. “I’m writing three to five songs a week, and it’s always between the hours of 11:00 a.m. and four,” she explains. This disciplined approach is balanced with a constant stream of ideas captured in her phone. “I always have titles or concepts in my phone, in the notes, and then I also have, like, voice notes of maybe melodies that I’ve come up with.” This combination of structure and spontaneity allows Walker to maintain a consistent output while still capturing the authenticity that resonates with her fans.\n\nWalker’s musical influences are as diverse as her sound. “I think I am a mod podge of absolutely everything,” she says, referencing artists from Avril Lavigne and Sum 41 to Taylor Swift and Brooks & Dunn. This eclectic mix of inspirations is further enriched by her background in Celtic music. “I played bagpipes as well. So, I had the Celtic side of things. So, you know, I step dance and highland dance and snare drum and bagpipes.” This unique combination of influences has shaped Walker’s distinctive sound, setting her apart in the country music scene.\n\nThe evolution of Walker’s songwriting process since signing with a Nashville label has been more about expansion than change. “I wouldn’t say it changed. I would say I am just working with different people, so I’m open to a lot more things,” she reflects. The collaborative nature of Nashville’s songwriting community has allowed Walker to refine her ideas and bring them to fruition in new ways. “Anyone can write a song on their own, but when you’re collaborating with incredible writers, bringing the idea in and knowing who you are helps so much where they can really curate exactly what you want and help bring it to the next level, which is fun.”\n\nWalker’s approach to live performances has significantly influenced her songwriting. “I’m performing so much these days that I have transitioned my songwriting into what works live for me,” she explains. This shift has led to a more energetic, crowd-pleasing style. “It’s hard to play all of those ballads, you know, if you’re playing at a bar, opening up for an artist, and no one gives a crap who you are. You have to win those people over, and it’s hard to win them over if you’re just playing a bunch of acoustic ballads. So, I am writing towards, you know, rocking out on stage and having fun.”\n\nThe concept of “mindful music” and “conscious country” remains an integral part of Walker’s artistic identity, even as her sound evolves. “Every album is almost like a phase of my life,” she reflects. While her current focus is on high-energy performances, she continues to write introspective, mindful songs. “I am writing songs like that all the time still. I just haven’t curated a whole album based around it like I did previously. But songwriting in general, it’s all about getting your feelings out. So, I’m always writing what’s going on.”\n\nWalker’s embrace of social media, particularly TikTok, has been a game-changer for her career. “During COVID I mean, the only way you could connect with fans was on social media, and that’s when TikTok really hit,” she explains. The platform’s focus on sound has made it particularly valuable for musicians. “The cool thing about TikTok is people go on there and they listen with sound. I find Instagram or Facebook, people are just scrolling, and they might watch for a second, but there’s. They might be at work or on a break, and they can’t have sound, but people definitely go on TikTok and listen to sound.”\n\nThe power of social media in shaping an artist’s career is not lost on Walker. “You could post one thing one day and it just pops off and your whole world can change and you can see the streams go up and you get all a whole new fan base, which is really cool,” she marvels. This digital landscape has allowed Walker to connect with fans in unprecedented ways, shaping her music based on their feedback and preferences.\n\nWalker’s unique blend of country and bagpipes, showcased in her viral hit “Whiskey’s Gone,” demonstrates her willingness to take risks and push genre boundaries. “I played bagpipes in that song and I was like, I don’t know what people are going to think of this, putting bagpipes in country music, but people liked it, apparently, which was fun,” she shares. This fusion of traditional country elements with her Celtic background has become a signature part of her live performances, setting her apart in the Nashville scene.\n\nThe influence of Walker’s upbringing in Prince Edward Island on her musical journey is undeniable. “Because I grew up playing bagpipes and loving Celtic music. That allowed me to write the ‘Whiskey’s Gone,’ which was one of my most viral songs,” she reflects. The small-town setting of PEI also instilled in her a drive to explore beyond her roots. “I always knew I wanted to live in a bigger city or, like, you know, move away and kind of just have more opportunities than I can get on the island… Being from somewhere so small, it actually did push me to do this and have the fearlessness to move away and do it.”\n\nBalancing creative pursuits with maintaining a strong social media presence is an ongoing challenge for Walker. “It’s a lot sometimes where it’ll be a few days where I haven’t posted and I feel guilty because I’m like, oh, my God, I haven’t posted anything,” she admits. However, she recognizes the importance of this digital connection with fans. “To me, social media is just as important as anything, as a tool for marketing, but also just as a tool for connecting with people and creating, like, a true fan base.”\n\nAs Alli Walker continues to blend her small-town roots with big-city dreams, her unique brand of “bra country” is poised to make an even bigger splash in the country music world."
