        "text": "By now everyone in the scene knows that Mini Truckin’ Magazine is no longer. On January 31st news spread quickly, via social media, that the magazine we have all grown to enjoy reading over the years was being shutdown. Time had caught up with the mag but I will say it was a damn good run. 1988 to 2014! 26 years, give or take, for those scoring at home. Think about this for a moment. 26 years! Lets compare for a moment to other epic runs in modern history. Seinfeld – 9 seasons, Cheers – 11 seasons, Terrell Davis (great running back for the Broncos) – 7 seasons. I’d say that 26 years for a magazine about mini trucks was a damn good run. Sure I wish it wasn’t shutdown however you have to look at the positive in everything.\n\nSeveral things I appreciate about the magazine is being featured twice. My truck’s chassis feature in 2010 and the cover feature by Phil Gordon in 2013. Additionally, winning “Mini Truck of the Year” (MTOTY) for 2013 is really something I will never forget. I really appreciate the honor bestowed upon me with this coveted acknowledgment, especially being the final winner of the MTOTY award. I guess the word on the top of my truck’s tag, Emeritus, brings on a new meaning at this time. The meaning of Emeritus, my favorite word, is “one retired from professional life but permitted to retain as an honorary title the rank of the last office held.” With this being said, I will ensure to carry on the title of MTOTY.\n\nHere’s to another 26 years of mini truckin’. We may no longer have a magazine named after our favorite hobby or scene but that isn’t going to stop us from enjoying and taking mini truckin’ to the next level! To the current crew that lost their jobs I’m sorry to hear this. I wish you all the best. To the past crews and editors I say thanks for all the great editorials, memories and overall passion you displayed about the scene and hobby we all enjoy."
