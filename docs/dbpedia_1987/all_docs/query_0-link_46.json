        "text": "LAREDO, Texas – A 28-year-old man has pleaded guilty to possessing a machinegun, announced U.S. Attorney Alamdar S. Hamdani.\n\nOn March 12, law enforcement attempted to stop a truck for a traffic infraction with Francisco Isaias Rodriguez riding as a passenger. He exited the vehicle seconds before the stop and began to flee. He was told to stop but he continued on foot.\n\nDuring the subsequent chase, Rodriguez resisted arrest, ignored commands from authorities and threw a small bag he carried around his shoulder over a fence and into a backyard.\n\nAuthorities later recovered the bag and found a Glock 9-millimeter pistol equipped with a machinegun conversion device, commonly known as a “switch.”\n\nThe switch altered the firearm’s function to shoot more than one round with a single pull of the trigger, making the firearm a fully-automatic weapon. The bag also contained one Glock pistol magazine with 14 rounds of ammunition, one Kriss extended pistol magazine containing 40 rounds, a pair of black latex gloves, one red and black plastic glove and a black balaclava ski mask.\n\nAfter his arrest, law enforcement searched the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record for any records pertaining to a registered machinegun, short-barreled rifle or any other weapon under Rodriguez’s name. There were none.\n\nAs part of his guilty plea, Rodriguez admitted to knowing federal law prohibits him from possessing the machinegun.\n\nU.S. District Judge Marina Garcia Marmolejo will impose sentencing at a later date. At that time, Rodriguez faces up to 10 years in federal prison and a possible $250,000 maximum fine.\n\nHe will remain in custody pending that hearing.\n\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Laredo Police Department conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Bajew is prosecuting the case."
