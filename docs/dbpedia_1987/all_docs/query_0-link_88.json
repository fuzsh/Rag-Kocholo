        "text": "Invariably, a trucker is going to have to do some form of waiting outside of his truck. Whether waiting for truck repairs or waiting for food at a restaurant, give your ears a break from listening to podcasts and grab a magazine. Here are our picks for the top trucker magazines.\n\n#7 Fleet Owner\n\nFleet Owner Magazine describes itself as “…the information source for trucking, written for middle and upper level managers at commercial truck fleets with five or more vehicles.” Even if you are a lone owner-operator or even an entry level position in the trucking industry, Fleet Owner still has insightful information all truckers will find useful, writing about all things trucks from safety to inspections to safety inspections.\n\n#6 10-4 Magazine\n\n10-4 tries its best to make trucking as fun as possible. Beyond traditional industry news and beautiful truck centerfolds, the magazine also has various puzzles and other entertainment for truckers who want a little more stimulation in their breaks after driving for hours on end.\n\n#5 Road King\n\nRoad King advertises as a magazine for professional truck drivers. At over fifty years old, Road King has articles about hobbies, stress relief, technological changes, and more. They are available for free at most TA Petro shopping centers, and digital versions of the most current issue, as well as individual articles from previous issues.\n\n#4 LandLine Magazine\n\nThe official magazine of the Owner-Operator Independent Driver’s Association, LandLine provides nationwide news on the trucking industry. If you have a computer or phone, their website allows you to filter news by state, giving you up to date information about any new laws or regulations to avoid breaking when traveling interstate.\n\n#3 Trucker’s Connection\n\nWhile having informative articles , Trucker’s Connection’s strongest point is its job recruiting. Whether you are an owner-operator looking for a new load or a recent graduate looking for a new position at a corporation, Trucker’s Connection has information on various companies that are hiring.\n\n#2 American Trucker\n\nWhen you own the website “trucker.com”, your magazine better be up to snuff. Published monthly for over forty years, American Trucker has dedicated sections for news, equipment, business, regulations, safety, and images. American Trucker also has a fully developed website for the modern trucker, complete with its own micro social media platform, Reader’s Rigs.\n\n#1 Overdrive\n\nOverdrive is truly the trucker’s magazine.
