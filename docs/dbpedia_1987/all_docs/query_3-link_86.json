I suggest you sign up with a spare email account and choose a non-interesting job, like a retired farmer.\n\nI've done this in the past and have free subscriptions to Popular Mechanics, AutoWeek, and some computer mags.\n\nThanks but no thanks. I've been thru this before, they'll start charging eventually, and it took me having to take legal action to get my funds back and stop the subscriptions and all that. Magazine salesmen are bad as used car salesmen. And I've gr a business so it was a big ordeal....they'll charge without telling you. Luckily I check my accounts often ori never wouldve noticed....\n\nLast edited by 1LOW4X4; 05-06-2010 at 09:05 AM.\n\nYou don't give them ANY credit card or banking info or send them any funds, so you wont have to take legal action to get any funds back. lol\n\nIf you want to continue after your year, just submit the renewal and pay for it. Otherwise, you won't get the magazine anymore.\n\nSorry Joe, but looks like quite a few actually did get their free years sub on that one:\n\nhttps://www.performancetrucks.net/fo...t=maxim&page=2\n\nDoesn't hurt to try. I've gotten the ones I've signed up for."
