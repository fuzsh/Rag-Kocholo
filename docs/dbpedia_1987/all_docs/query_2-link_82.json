I am hoping to have someone tell me that the person claiming to have been around \"Back in the day\" whom decided to insult the Vanners in his final paragraph, was all in my imagination. I am hoping that someone else read that same article and found that it was a positive reaction to Vans, not a laughing flashback with a poke at the current state. Please tell me I am wrong and the Idiot did not just call me old! Granted my birthday just passed but I was not ready to concider myself old! Nor would I call many of my friends OLD! sure I have some old friends but most of the Vanners I hang out with are 35 and under. 90% of the cool Astro's I have seen are the younger batch of Vanners. I'm sure they see the Retro Van or the Van that hasn't changed in 20 years since it was a show winner, but there are thousands more out there. Now are we supposed to sit here and just keep buying their rag, I think not. If there's not the coverage we expected in next months issue, I will dedicate my life to making the Editors of Truckin' regret builing up our expectations on a lie. Don't get me wrong, I would love to see the issues the way we were told they were going to be. But right now it smells fishy. When did george bush start being the editor of truckin'? I'm tired of empty promises and being lied to, I hope what I read was a fluke.\n\nMadman!\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 28,125\n\nI honestly don't know how I feel about it yet. I do know I have to read it again. Debbie, was appauled by it like you Chooie. I was not crazy about what I read, but was trying to read between the lines. I gathered that the column was written by a one time vanner that had no idea that it never stopped. Not being as old as he, I do not feel the same way about vanning (obviously) as he did.\n\nMy biggest comment on the whole Truckin Magazine , \"Vannin\" push, is they are running out of ideas to make money with their magazine. I mean they have \"BOATS\" in their TRUCKIN MAGAZINE.\n\nI do hate to say it though Chooie, as we are ALL getting there, Yes we are getting OLD. Bet Nanning will keep us young as long as we want!\n\nold hand\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 577\n\nyeah, it wasnt too positive really, almost making it seem like most vanners are just potsmoking burnout hippies or something like that. some of us may be but thats besides the point...this isnt really the image we want spread around for all the public to see is it?\n\nthe overall feel i got from the article was just a laugh at the past, they didnt have too much to say about vanning now.\n\ngene, ill throw the mag in my van tomorrow morning and make sure i get it up to summerset.\n\nalso, maybe someone should move this post to general discussion for all to see. of course i check all the forums w/ new messages when im here so it doesnt really matter to me...\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 6,115\n\ni havn't read it YET..but will before the day ends\n\n..but from what i've heard here so far\n\na van rag is in order and my motivation is\n\ndefinately growing to put something together\n\nover this winter ..maybe a \"flashback\"\n\nof this season,starting with a few pages at a time\n\n...offering them by mail online and possibly some flyers for events so those not online can get the word\n\n...my wheels are turning fast..and not just on my van\n\nanyone think they may wanna get involved with creating some good content and making a van rag ?\n\ni've never had much confidence in truckin'\n\nlets face it.. the name says it all...\n\nand it don't say vannin on thier cover\n\nVAN~ON\n\nold hand\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 822\n\nLikes: 1\n\nI did not like the article at all when I read it either. If you really read into the article it sounds like he is the one trying to promote the van or \"sport van thing\". But the other \"younger\" people at the magazine cant see it or relate to vans. I dont think we should depend on Truckin magazine to promote vans or the van movement. The FACT is that the van movement is INVISIBLE! We all know and have talked about the reasons why. I fell in love with vans from seeing them around my neighborhood when I was growing up. I was lucky enough to have a guy in my neighborhood that built vans. Custom street vans are now \"out of sight, out of mind\". Nothing is cooler than seeing a caravan of vans rolling down the street. My 2 cents is that we should start another smaller type of event. Some type of cruise. Maybe meet somewhere and cruise to some destination with some small happening. Even if its just meeting at some restaurant for lunch/dinner. Or meet at a car stereo place with a large parking lot to hang out. But the key is to be in the public eye. Then and only then will people start talking about vans."
