It has 2 million square feet of yard space.\n\nSalSon's expanded operations map. (SalSon Logistics)\n\nAs a result of the merger, the new entity will add locations across the West Coast, Midwest and Southern U.S.\n\nFounded in 1960 by Sal Berritto and Sonny DeMarco, SalSon previously had operations in Newark; Norfolk, Va.; Charleston, S.C.; Savannah, Ga.; Atlanta; Houston; Bakersfield, Inland Empire, Long Beach and Oakland, Calif.; and Tacoma, Wash.\n\nSalSon’s expanded footprint will see enhanced operations in Savannah, Charleston and Norfolk, it said.\n\n“We are thrilled to expand SalSon’s footprint and turnkey logistics model across the country, particularly in the West Coast, which will enable us to better serve our clients with a more comprehensive and efficient national logistics network,” said CEO Jason Fisk.\n\nThe deal was underwritten by investment from Boca Raton, Fla.-based private equity group Sun Capital Partners."
