        "text": "Driving commercial trucks over long distances and varying terrains can be incredibly demanding on both the vehicle and the driver. Multiple factors come into play as soon as a vehicle leaves its depot, including load weight and size, poor road conditions, difficult routes that may require constant braking and acceleration, and bad weather. These factors contribute to safety issues and driver fatigue but can be mitigated by keeping tires inflated at the proper pressure for road conditions.\n\nCommercial truck OEMs have long turned to Central Tire Inflation Systems (CTIS) to help their customers achieve appropriate tire pressures while driving. But these systems can typically have their own challenges, ranging from manual system controls which requires drivers to get out of their vehicles to adjust tire pressure, to complete system failure when components cannot withstand heat and pressure ranges within the CTIS itself.\n\nNew Technology for Safety and Reliability\n\nNow, Freudenberg Sealing Technologies has applied its material and sealing expertise to the development of a new CTIS double-lipped sealing component that can reduce friction and power loss to maintain a safe, reliable CTIS system in commercial trucks and trailers. The new, double-lipped sealing component improves the functionality and lifetime of these systems, allowing CTIS manufacturers the opportunity to develop more sophisticated, automatic tire pressure systems that are controlled by a single button inside the cab.\n\nFreudenberg Sealing Technologies’ innovative CTIS seal is designed for all axles. The seal employs special pressure-balancing lips that effectively prevent overheating, ensuring the longevity and reliability required for high-speed applications. Moreover, the effectiveness of the company’s CTIS will accommodate potential expansion of CTIS systems to drive axles, trailers and front steering axles, creating a comprehensive tire pressure solution for different vehicle configurations.\n\nFreudenberg Sealing Technologies’ Lead Center Heavy Duty in Luserna, Italy has taken the lead in developing the company’s CTIS seal, said Matteo Fenoglio, Lead Center Marketing Manager.\n\n“The North American Truck and Bus market has wanted requested an automatic CTIS system to install on their drive axles for years, but until now there has been no reliable sealing solution that can withstand the high speeds and heat generated by pressure applied to the tires,” said Fenoglio. “As the pressure in the tires is increased, it generates high heat on the seal lips which leads to premature failure of standard sealing solutions used to seal the air pressure in the tire. Our concept addresses this issue by balancing the pressure through special seal lips that prevent overheating.\n\n“We are the right partner with the right technology to help promote the next generation of CTIS systems,” said Fenoglio. “Our R&D team and engineers have conducted extensive testing on this seal and it is a game changer for heavy truck customers.”\n\nIn the broadest terms, the CTIS seal from Freudenberg Sealing Technologies incorporates two different sealing lips that both perform the same function of sealing air: sealing lips that save money on fuel and maintenance costs and address sustainability issues as well.\n\nThese are the benefits:\n\nEnhanced On-Road Safety\n\nThe CTIS plays a pivotal role in preventing tire bursts, significantly reducing the risk of accidents and enhancing overall on-road safety.\n\nImproved Driver Comfort\n\nBy minimizing vibrations transmitted to the cab, CTIS enhances driver comfort, making journeys through challenging terrains more pleasant and less fatiguing.\n\nCost-Efficient Operation\n\nThe system keeps downtime and maintenance costs at lower levels, contributing to a more cost-effective operation for Truck vehicles.\n\nReduced Fuel Consumption and Carbon Footprint\n\nOptimizing tire pressure not only enhances fuel efficiency but also minimizes the carbon footprint of the vehicle, aligning with environmental sustainability goals.\n\nIncreased E-Mobility Vehicle Range\n\nTires friction is one of the main drivers that influence the range of E-mobility vehicles"
