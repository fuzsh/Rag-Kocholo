        "text": "Did you know there is only a 11.8% chance of a typical vehicle lasting for 250,000 miles? However, breaking the barriers of conventional longevity, a 2023 study by iSeeCars.com unearthed a lineup of 23 of the best vehicle models that are defying the odds and are most likely to surpass a quarter-million miles.\n\nWant more news like this right to your inbox? Sign up for our eNewsletter today!\n\nFor its 10th anniversary, the study delved into a vast dataset of over 260 million cars sold from 2012 to 2022, scrutinizing which vehicles exhibited the highest likelihood of reaching impressive mileage milestones.\n\nAmong the contenders, trucks took the lead, securing 10 spots on the coveted list. Which may not surprise many as pickup trucks are often known for their longevity. Used regularly by service fleets, construction fleets, and other work truck fleet operations, these pickup trucks are outdriving their larger counterparts.\n\nSo, what are the most reliable pickup trucks when it comes to longevity? Whether you are curious about what the best full-size truck or the best small truck is, when looking at longevity, Toyota emerged as the most dominant brand, with a notable presence of eight models in the lineup, taking the spot as one of the best trucks to buy.\n\nThe Ford F-350 Super Duty claimed the throne as the most durable model, with a 49.1% chance of crossing the 250,000-mile mark and beyond.\n\nThe study's findings underscore a trend in the automotive industry. As stated by iSeeCars.com Executive Analyst Karl Brauer, vehicle lifespans have been on a consistent rise, with over 20 cars now displaying a 20% or higher probability of reaching the coveted quarter-million-mile milestone.\n\nThe once widely accepted notion that 100,000 miles marked the upper limit of a car's usability has been challenged over the past three decades.\n\nThe study's expansion to predict vehicles with the greatest likelihood of surpassing 250,000 miles signifies a significant leap in understanding the remarkable endurance potential of modern automobiles.\n\nLongest Lasting Trucks and the Most Reliable Pickup Trucks\n\nWhat's a half-ton truck? Is it the same as a light-duty truck? Often intermixed, a light-duty truck is often called a half-ton truck due to the truck's payload capacity. However, modern trucks can exceed those numbers.\n\nPickup trucks, on average, have a 25.9% probability of reaching the impressive milestone of 250,000 miles or beyond.\n\nSurpassing this average benchmark, nine truck models stand out, exhibiting even greater longevity potential.\n\nAmong these contenders, heavy-duty models dominate the field, but notable names like the Toyota Tundra, Toyota Tacoma, Chevrolet Silverado 1500, and Chevrolet Avalanche also boast a higher-than-average likelihood of crossing the quarter-million-mile mark. Smaller pickup trucks are still struggling to hit those higher mileage marks.\n\nWhich Trucks are Most Likely to Last 250,000+ Miles? Toyota Tacoma Tundra and Toyota Tacoma Makes the Cut\n\nSo, what are the best trucks that are most likely to last 250,000 miles or more? What can you expect from these reliable trucks? And just what goes into making the most reliable trucks of all time (or at least 2024)?\n\nRank Model % Chance of Lasting 250,000+ Miles Compared to Average 1 Ford F-350 Super Duty 49.1% 1.9x 2 Toyota Tundra 47.9% 1.8x 3 Ford F-250 Super Duty 43.6% 1.7x 4 Toyota Tacoma 41.7% 1.6x 5 GMC Sierra 2500HD 41.3% 1.6x 6 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD 41.2% 1.6x 7 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 31.0% 1.2x 8 Chevrolet Avalanche 26.7% 1.0x 9 Ram 2500 26.3% 1.0x 10 Ram 3500 24.3% 0.9x\n\niSeeCars.com analyzed data from a pool of over 260 million cars. For each vehicle, the average odometer reading was calculated at various yearly ages, forming the basis for a unique proprietary model.\n\nIs more than 200,000 miles good for light-duty trucks? Absolutely. Are you going to see a lot of these extremely high-mileage trucks in a commercial fleet operation? Probably not. But knowing they can last this long is a fantastic indicator that the truck will make it for the miles your fleet needs. These showcase the best truck options for fleet operators based on reliability.\n\nThis model was then utilized to estimate the likelihood of each vehicle's survival to different mileage thresholds. As part of the thorough analysis, heavy-duty vans and models lacking sufficient data were excluded to ensure the accuracy of the findings.\n\nLearning More about the Longest-Lasting Pickup Trucks\n\nCheck out the highlights of a few of the top longest-lasting pickup trucks:\n\n2023 Ford F-350 Super Duty: The 2023 Ford F-Series Super Duty lineup redefines the heavy-duty truck segment by merging robust performance with advanced technology. It features Pro Power Onboard for onsite power, the Ford Pro suite for operational efficiency, and 5G connectivity to meet the demands of various industries. With engine options like the 6.8L V-8 and a high-output 6.7L Power Stroke diesel V-8, it aims for top towing, payload, torque, and horsepower. Innovations like the Ford Pro Upfit Integration System enhance work equipment integration.\n\n2024 Toyota Tundra: The Tundra introduces new powertrains, including a twin-turbo V-6 and a hybrid variant, both paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission equipped with intelligent shift modes and TOW/HAUL options. The i-FORCE twin-turbo V6 delivers 389 horsepower and 479 lb.-ft. of torque, while the i-FORCE MAX hybrid boosts performance to 437 horsepower and 583 lb.-ft. of torque. This hybrid system, featuring a motor generator and a Ni-MH battery, enhances fuel efficiency to an EPA-estimated 20-24 MPG, depending on the configuration. The electric motor primarily powers the vehicle at lower speeds, with the gasoline engine taking over at speeds above 18 mph for consistent mid- to high-speed performance.\n\n2024 Chevrolet Silverado: New for the 2024 model year, the Chevrolet Silverado features a 2.7L high-output I-4 engine with the new TurboMax name and features an available Duramax 3.0L turbo-diesel engine on the ZR2. The models are available on WT, Custom, Custom Trail Boss, LT, RST, LT Trail Boss, ZR2, LTZ, and High Country trims, with Super Cruise available on the High Country. The truck bed features 12 standard tie downs, 89.1 cu.-ft. of cargo space, and an available up/down tailgate. The available Multi-Flex tailgate has six functions, ideal for work truck drivers. The Trailering package is standard on Custom trim and above, and available on WT models.\n\n2024 GMC Sierra: The 2024 model-year GMC Sierra features updated capabilities and a refined second-generation 3.0L inline-six Duramax Turbo-Diesel engine standard on its extreme off-road Sierra 1500 AT4X trim. First introduced on select 2023 Sierra 1500 trims, the automaker noted that the updated 3.0L Duramax engine comes standard with a 10-speed automatic transmission and delivers max power of 305 horsepower (a 10% increase compared to MY22), and max torque of 495 lb-ft (a 7.6% increase from MY22). In addition, for the 2024 model year, the 2.7L Turbo High-Output Engine will now carry the name TurboMax.\n\nEditor's note: This article was originally published in July of 2023 and has been updated with additional information on the top trucks.
