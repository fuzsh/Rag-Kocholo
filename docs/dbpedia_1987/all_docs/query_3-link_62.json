        "text": "OVERVIEW:\n\nTruckin Classic Trucks magazine was started by McMullen-Yee Publishing in Anaheim, California. The publishers, Tom McMullen and Ken Yee, saw a growing trend in customized pickups of all years and styles. Since it already had Truckin' to cover broader van, pickup and truck content, this new title was effectively a \"spin-off\" to more directly address 1950s era (and mostly) Chevy and Ford pickups.\n\nLike all truck magazines, it had featured vehicles, \"how-to\" technical tips and event coverage.\n\nWith Mr. Yee's death in 1994 and Mr. McMullen's death the following year, the title was then purchased as part of a larger transaction by K-III Communications (later Primedia) Inc for $55 million in June, 1995.\n\nThe magazine went from a quarterly to a bi-monthly publishing cadence in 1996, and then the title was changed to Classic Trucks with the January, 1997 issue. Publication continued with this new title until 2019 when it went to a digital-only format.\n\nThe table of contents, if available, can be seen by clicking on the icon.\n\nPUBLICATION DATA:\n\nThe publisher provided net paid circulation data to Oxbridge Communication's compendium, The Standard Periodical Directory from 1994 to 2001. Reported circulation was consistently 300,000 print issues."
