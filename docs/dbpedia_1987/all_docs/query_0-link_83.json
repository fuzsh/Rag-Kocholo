        "text": "The SOLIS solar tonneau truck cover from Worksport has proven an effecitve portable energy source from ongoing tests, capable of producing 680 W of power, according to the company.\n\nThe SOLIS has been undergoing live testing on the back of pickup trucks for the past two weeks, and will soon enter its final live-testing phase.\n\n“The COR & SOLIS system work as a powerful clean-tech nano grid, generating a significant amount of power every hour,” said Steven Rossi, CEO, in a statement. “Our test results show that the system can charge up to 45 iPhone 14s per hour, providing clean energy straight from the sun. Customers can use their cover to power the campsite, power tools, and even appliances.”\n\nSo far, Worksport has tested optimal energy harvesting and cloud integration allowing information exchange of the embedded power converters. Both Worksport SOLIS & COR will be paired with a mobile app, providing users with real-time insights into power usage and generation.\n\nRafael Oliveira, CTO designate, said in a statement:\n\n“The potential is real to have hundreds of thousands of SOLIS units travelling the roads globally, representing the largest portable solar microgrid network in the world, all providing real time data. With our live data collection, we could accumulate invaluable data relating to solar irradiance, weather conditions, and solar efficiency in different geographic locations.”\n\nPilot SOLIS solar tonneau covers are currently being produced in the company’s Western New York factory. This factory will be home to the Worksport’s SOLIS Alpha and full-scale production.\n\nThe Alpha release of Worksport’s Solar Truck Cover and COR portable energy system is set for later this summer."
