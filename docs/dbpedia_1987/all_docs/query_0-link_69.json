        "text": "The all-new 2003 Dodge Ram Heavy Duty 2500 pickup has won Truckin' magazine's \"Truck of the Year\" award, the publication's editorial director announced. During a three-week competition, the Dodge Ram 2500 4x4 Quad Cab with 345 horsepower worth of HEMI Magnum power upstaged all of its rivals in the competition. All testing was conducted by the Truckin' magazine staff over the course of three weeks and included both empirical as well as subjective tests. The staff logged roughly 3,000 miles on each vehicle. Testing criteria included fuel efficiency, standing 1/4-mile mph, 0-60 mph numbers and 60-0 mph braking.\n\nAbout the author\n\nStaff Writer\n\nEditorial\n\nOur team of enterprising editors brings years of experience covering the fleet industry.
