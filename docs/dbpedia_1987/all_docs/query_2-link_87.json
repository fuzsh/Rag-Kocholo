        "text": "Truckin’ magazine’s editor, Dan Ward, visited the Combat Center recently for an up close and personal look at the extreme trucks of the Corps. What he found was more than just trucks as he visited with Marines from 1st Tank Battalion and the Combat Center’s Explosive Ordnance Disposal team.\n\nThe Savannah, Ga., native, who lives in Foothill Ranch, Calif., experienced the monstrous power of the M1A1 Abrams main battle tank, saw his own Ford F150 dwarfed next to a Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement and at the end of a long day declared EOD’s Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle as his favorite – likely because it was the only one he climbed in or on, which actually had air conditioning. Ward, whose father and grandfather ‘claim the title,’ enjoyed the opportunity to visit with the Marines.\n\n“I wanted to see first hand the driving force of the Marine Corps,” he said. “Not just the trucks, I also wanted to see the men and women behind the scenes who do so much, but don't receive the recognition.\n\n“Being a part of a family with a rich heritage in the Corps, I also felt compelled to give a big ‘thank you’ to the Marines the only way I know how – in Truckin’ magazine,” he added. “Hopefully our gratitude for the service, sacrifice and selflessness that is our military will be evident in our unique tribute.”\n\nThe military tribute edition of Truckin’ includes 12 pages of coverage from his visit to the Combat Center and hits the newsstands July 28."
