        "text": "KID'S PAGE - NOVEMBER 2003\n\nHEY KIDS... GET INVOLVED!!!\n\nWe at 10-4 Magazine have always strived to produce a publication that the whole family can read and look at - kids and all. We know that there are a lot of kids out there whose parents, or other close family members, drive trucks for a living. With that in mind, were sure many young people pickup our magazine and give it a look. But kids have never had their own space in the magazine. Wed like to change that but well need your help.\n\nWe would like to begin printing a Kids Page every month in the magazine but we cant do it without your input. The original idea for this page came from an eleven-year-old kid named Troy from Denver, Colorado. Troy suggested that we might consider publishing kids drawings, or stories or whatever. We thought the idea was great!\n\nTroy is a certified truck nut - already! We met him for the first time at the truck show in Las Vegas and were very impressed with this intelligent young man. He showed us letters that he had written to Kenworth (submitting a new truck design for their consideration), truck drawings he had done, stories he had written, and a whole bunch of other stuff. He convinced us that there are probably many kids out there looking for an outlet for their creativity.\n\nNot only does Troy design and draw trucks, he builds them too (see photo below). He has one of the finest custom-built LEGO truck and trailer combinations we have ever seen - well, actually the only one, but I bet there are plenty more out there. If youre a kid with a cool truck model, take a picture and send it in. Tell us about yourself and whatever it is that you are sending us so that we can share it with everybody else.\n\nIf you are a parent of a creative kid, encourage him or her to write a poem, or draw a picture, and submit it to the magazine. Or kids, maybe you could take a picture of your mom and/or dads truck and write up a little story about why you are so proud of them or what kinds of things they haul. It doesnt have to be truck-related stuff, but we would prefer it to be (since we are a trucking magazine).\n\nWe want the whole family to enjoy getting and reading the magazine. We also want the kids out there to have a voice and have some fun. Send your drawings, photographs, stories, poems, letters or whatever to 10-4 Magazine Kids, P.O. Box 7377, Huntington Beach, CA 92615. Or send us an e-mail at 10-4@tenfourmagazine.com. Or fax us at (714) 962-8506. Please include your name, age, city, state, grade, the name of your school and anything else you might want to share with your correspondence. If you have any questions, call us at 1-888-440-4104. We hope to hear from you. And, once again, thanks to Troy for inspiring us and prodding us along to get this page going. Im sure well be hearing a lot more from Troy in the coming months, as he helps us develop this idea into something really good. Have fun!"
