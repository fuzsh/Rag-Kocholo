        "text": "The New Yorker, October 11, 1993 P. 96\n\nONWARD AND UPWARD WITH THE ARTS about Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead. Garcia is middle-aged; he has always been our most improbable pop-culture idol, somebody to whom the playing matters more than the posing. At 51, a halo of gray hair fringing his head and his gray-white beard indifferently trimmed, he resembles the proverbial unmade bed. The merest of filaments divides the man from the performer. His absence of style is a style itself and suggests an inability to abide by anybody else's rules. Nobody else in the history of rock and roll has ever watched his popularity advance on an exponential curve with each passing year. Tells about his poor health habits which led to a collapse. He smokes less and exercises more now. Writer watches him in concert at Oakland Coliseum. Before Garcia turned to rock full time, he fronted a jug band, Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. Then he formed the Warlocks, who got involved with Ken Kesey's Acid Tests of the sixties, and became the house band for Kesey and his bunch. Tells about the Deadheads. According to a story in USA Today, undercover agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration have lately been infiltrating Deadhead throngs and busting people who are selling LSD. Away from the spotlight, Garcia leads a simple life. If he has any taste for possessions, he keeps it hidden. He has been a creature of the road for so long that he's never had much of a home. Tells about his Roman Catholic upbringing. He enjoys scuba-diving anf plans to head to Hawaii soon."
