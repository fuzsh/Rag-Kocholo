I have a copy of the issue and its a keeper along with a bunch of photos I got at Glenn Helen, along with some of a couple of parts I machined for Chris, lots of folks put lots of time into that Truck and I think everyone is really proud of the final product. not much else to say but it's gone and I bet the next one will be even better.\n\nOct 22, 2013\n\n#8\n\nMagicMtnDan\n\nFRF Addict\n\nJoined\n\nOct 28, 2011\n\nPosts\n\n7,661\n\nReaction score\n\n1,794\n\nLocation\n\nMagic Mountain\n\nWhen I saw it on the newsstand I had to take a pic of the cover.\n\nIronic that the magazine came out just after the truck passed away.\n\nRIP \"King of the Raptors\" (that's not the name it went by around these parts).\n\nI know a lot of people and companies put quite a bit of manpower, time, and materials into helping build that truck. I hope they all were taken care of since they can't get any promotional value from it.\n\nAttachments\n\nTruckin mag cover King of the Raptors.jpg\n\nLast edited: Oct 22, 2013"
