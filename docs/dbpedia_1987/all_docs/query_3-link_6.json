        "text": "OVERVIEW:\n\nTruckin magazine was published monthly by TRM Publications in Anaheim, California. The publishers, Tom and Rose McMullen, saw a growing trend in custom vans and pickups cruising around Southern California. Named after the popular saying and the R. Crumb comic, \"Keep on Truckin'\", the first issue went on sale in Summer 1975. Content included feature articles, truck profiles and how-to articles.\n\nOWNERSHIP:\n\nFrom 1975 to May 1995, Truckin was owned by either McMullen Publications or McMullen-Yee Publishing. Mr. Yee died in 1994, and Mr. McMullen died in a tragic accident in 1995. The editors and staff rode a wave of changes as the title moved through various new owners:\n\n1995 -- Primedia acquires McMullen & Yee Publishing and creates McMullen-Argus Publishing division;\n\n2007 -- Primedia sells its Enthusiast Media division to Source Interlink Media for $1.2 billion;\n\n2014 -- Source Interlink rebrands to TEN: The Enthusiast Network;\n\n2018 -- The Enthusiast Network is restructured into the Motor Trend Group, and the following year numerous titles are ended including Truckin.\n\nThe table of contents, if available, can be seen by clicking on the icon.\n\nPUBLICATION DATA:\n\nThe publisher provided net paid circulation data to various periodical compendia from 1978 to 2005 (which is the last year for which we have data at this time). Over this time period, annual circulation averaged 250,000 print issues, and the reported values ranged from 142,000 to 523,000."
