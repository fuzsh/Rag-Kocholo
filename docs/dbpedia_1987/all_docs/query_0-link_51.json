        "text": "Chevron announced Aug. 2 it will move its headquarters from its longtime home of San Ramon, Calif., to Houston, Texas.\n\nThe move came amid a shakeup of the company’s senior executives. Chevron has about 2,000 employees at its California headquarters. Chairman and CEO Mike Wirth and vice-chairman Mark Nelson will relocate to Texas by the end of this year.\n\n“There will be minimal immediate relocation impacts to other employees currently based in San Ramon,” Chevron said in a statement. “The company expects all corporate functions to migrate to Houston over the next five years. Positions in support of the company’s California operations will remain in San Ramon.”\n\nChevron also announced the retirements of several senior executives, including Nigel Hearne, executive vice-president of oil, products and gas. Nelson will take over those roles Oct. 1."
