OVERVIEW:

Truckin Classic Trucks magazine was started by McMullen-Yee Publishing in Anaheim, California. The publishers, Tom McMullen and Ken Yee, saw a growing trend in customized pickups of all years and styles. Since it already had Truckin' to cover broader van, pickup and truck content, this new title was effectively a "spin-off" to more directly address 1950s era (and mostly) Chevy and Ford pickups.

Like all truck magazines, it had featured vehicles, "how-to" technical tips and event coverage.

With Mr. Yee's death in 1994 and Mr. McMullen's death the following year, the title was then purchased as part of a larger transaction by K-III Communications (later Primedia) Inc for $55 million in June, 1995.

The magazine went from a quarterly to a bi-monthly publishing cadence in 1996, and then the title was changed to Classic Trucks with the January, 1997 issue. Publication continued with this new title until 2019 when it went to a digital-only format.
