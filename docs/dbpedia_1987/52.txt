Description

In 1974, then-publisher of Street Rodder and Street Chopper magazines, Tom McMullen, saw a growing trend in custom vans and pickups cruising Southern California and making the scene at hot rod shows. Using the popular saying "Keep on Truckin'" as a basis, Truckin’ magazine was created. In 1975, the first issue went on sale at newsstands for $1.00 under the TRM Publications (which stood for Tom and Rose McMullen) family of auto magazines. From 1975 to May 1995, Truckin’ was published by TRM before being sold off to a larger media group after Tom and his wife died when their Rockwell Commander 112 crashed into a field in Oklahoma. The title changed hands a few more times over the years before going digital and finally ceasing in 2019.
