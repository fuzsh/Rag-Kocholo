OVERVIEW:

Truckin magazine was published monthly by TRM Publications in Anaheim, California. The publishers, Tom and Rose McMullen, saw a growing trend in custom vans and pickups cruising around Southern California. Named after the popular saying and the R. Crumb comic, "Keep on Truckin'", the first issue went on sale in Summer 1975. Content included feature articles, truck profiles and how-to articles.

OWNERSHIP:

From 1975 to May 1995, Truckin was owned by either McMullen Publications or McMullen-Yee Publishing. Mr. Yee died in 1994, and Mr. McMullen died in a tragic accident in 1995. The editors and staff rode a wave of changes as the title moved through various new owners:

1995 -- Primedia acquires McMullen & Yee Publishing and creates McMullen-Argus Publishing division;

2007 -- Primedia sells its Enthusiast Media division to Source Interlink Media for $1.2 billion;

2014 -- Source Interlink rebrands to TEN: The Enthusiast Network;

2018 -- The Enthusiast Network is restructured into the Motor Trend Group, and the following year numerous titles are ended including Truckin.
