Character Analysis

Kylie Minogue has a watery Cancer Ascendant and Ascendant Lord Moon is exalted placed in the 11th house. So she may be very sensitive and very emotional and sentimental. She is more imaginative and progressive in her manner of thinking. She can be hard from the outside like a crab but will be very gentle underneath. But she has four planets in earthy sign Taurus makes her highly practical and materialistic as well. The impracticality of Cancer Ascendant is overtaken by the impact of Taurus dominance in her chart.

Her birth star is Rohini and star Lord Moon exalted makes her extremely beautiful and very attractive. She shows a lot of pomp and show but at the same time she may have weak heart or say very selfish or self centered nature. She may be very short tempered and invite troubles by over reacting at times. She can be very secretive and violent, when instigated, as Moon is afflicted severely in the Navmansa chart by Mars and Ketu. She is also prone to depression.

Relationship and Marriage

She has said that she was never made for a conventional marriage with a house in the suburbs. In her Navmansa chart Ascendant is severely afflicted and Rahu is placed in the 7th house of Navmansa clearly indicating lack of harmony and peace in married life. Saturn-Rahu conjunction in the 9th house is also not desirable for long term relationship. So her statement matches with the planetary influences in her chart. The strong Venus in the 11th house and four planets therein might give her vast friend circle and also strong desire for love but certainly not in favor of long term bond.
