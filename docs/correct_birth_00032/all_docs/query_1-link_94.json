        "text": "This year’s Australia Day campaign asks us to reflect on the story of us. It has been applauded for its beauty and honesty, for the way it tries to capture the complicated pattern of our national soul, woven together ‘‘since the beginning of time’’.\n\nThe way we portray the past has been contested ground. The way we portray the present can be controversial, too. Tourism Australia spent $15 million getting Kylie Minogue to sell the country to the British in December only to have its carefully-crafted image of white sand and sleepy koalas brutally juxtaposed with news photographs of beaches crowded with frightened families fleeing for their lives and animals scarred and charred by fire.\n\n‘‘A pal to rely on, a shoulder to cry on, in Australia,’’ Kylie crooned on Christmas Day. The advertiser who penned that line would not have realised how bittersweet it would sound by New Year’s Eve.\n\nMateship, that living term so weighted with history in this country, is one of Australia’s enduring qualities. This Australia Day, we should reflect on the fact we are lucky to live in a place where 95 per cent of us feel we have someone to turn to when we need ‘‘a pal to rely on, a shoulder to cry on’’.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Development’s Better Life Index ranks us sixth in the world for our sense of community. We have excellent healthcare and education, jobs, plenty of green space, clean water and, until recently, unpolluted air. When it comes to the best countries in which to live, we routinely rank near the top of the list.\n\nYet the statistics gloss over the reality for some of us. It is a stain on our reputation that an Indigenous baby boy born in 2017 is likely to die 8.6 years earlier than a non-Indigenous boy born on the same day. For that little boy, now aged two or three, our excellent health outcomes don’t apply. He is also more likely, as he gets older, to commit suicide, be homeless or be sent to jail. These inequalities must be addressed. Indigenous Australians must have a ‘‘voice’’ that can be heard in the governance of this country in line with the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Constitutional recognition of their place in our story is essential.\n\nAnd we cannot take our blessings for granted. ‘‘An unspoiled environment is a source of satisfaction, improves mental well-being [and] allows people to recover from the stress of everyday life,’’ the OECD index says. Today, we face threats to our air and our water – the two measures the OECD uses to rate environment. In some parts of Australia bushfires burnt through our water catchments and left our supply at risk of contamination. In others, the smoke over the past two months has forced us to close our windows, don face masks and keep our children inside. The wake-up call that as a country we must do more to cut carbon emissions could not have been louder.\n\nLoading\n\nWe are writing our story every day, the Australia Day Council tells us, and we should be proud of many of its chapters. The work of Australian of the Year James Muecke in fighting blindness, particularly in the developing world, is a testament to how Australia, and Australians, so often make the most of our blessings and give something back. In medicine alone, Australians have been responsible for the invention of penicillin, the cervical cancer vaccine, the bionic ear, ultrasounds and spray-on skin. Think of the millions of lives changed by the industry of our countrymen and women.\n\nWe must ensure that as a nation we keep giving – and that the story we write is an epic we are always happy to tell."
