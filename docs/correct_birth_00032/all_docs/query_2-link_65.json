        "text": "Entrepreneur and musician Kylie Minogue is looking for an expert on wine as part of a £55,000 aide job, reports have claimed.\n\nThe legendary Spinning Around singer is something of a connoisseur through her Kylie Minogue Wines brand, which has already achieved significant success, following its launch in 2020, with a southern French rosé.\n\nIt has been valued through Nieslen data for 2022 at £18.9m and volumes up 314.9% last year alone, and her Pinot Noir featured on db‘s Global Pinot Noir Masters. Her wines includes expressions from Côtes de Provence, Languedoc, Gascony, Gambellera, Margaret River and the Yarra Valley.\n\nNow, as the singer returns to performing, she is looking for an aide to work alongside her as she starts her Las Vegas residency and a number of other gigs.\n\nAccording to a report in the Mirror, Minogue is looking for a candidate who will travel with her, including her home in Melbourne, time in the UK, and also in the US for the residency. It said the aide “must be a sommelier”, and a source said alongside her own successful wine brands, she “has a keen appreciation of other varieties.”\n\nShe is considered one of the most ‘hands on’ of celebrities to own a drinks brand, even appearing at ProWein 2023 to showcase her wines.\n\nIn December, she told db in an exclusive interview:“I was quite nervous about entering the industry, as I didn’t want to upset anyone, or for anyone to feel like I was gatecrashing, but people have been very supportive of me and the range.\n\n“The more I learn about wine the more I realise there is to learn. It’s been pretty daunting at times, but I’ve been welcomed by the industry with open arms.”"
