        "text": "#FREEKYLIE\n\n2+ years ago, The Docklands and Docklands Park in Melbourne, Australia, received a renovation. During this costume change and construction, the bronze\n\nKYLIE MINOGUE\n\nstatue was removed from its home and placed into storage, where it currently remains. It's no secret that the Kylie Minogue statue was evicted from this park and never allowed to return.\n\nVisitors and fans alike have been shocked by her absence, longing for the day they could step back in time to pose next to, around, and in her arms. Wow. It's been too long and too much time has passed for Australia's biggest export to be hidden away..especially for you, Melbourne: Kylie's hometown.\n\nThose of us visiting have been spinning around, wishing we were so lucky, looking for our golden girl to take selfies with: dancing in the sunlight. We've been wondering ever since: \"What do I have to do?\" to get Kylie back home? It feels like light years since she's been away.\n\nBut no worries, Melbourne. This is not some ill deed that will take a lifetime to repair. You have been slow to act, but you can remedy this situation by giving the one true KYLIE a little more time under the Melbourne sun. Put your hand on your heart and then put your hands up if you feel the Kylie Minogue love tonight.\n\nMelbourne, you're an amazing city and we hope you'll realize:\n\nKylie Minogue is THE ONE\n\nyou've been missing.\n\nThis is a petition to the City of Melbourne and Tourism Melbourne to #FREEKYLIE and get our red-blooded woman's bronze statue out of the warehouse--where it currently sits collecting dust--and back into the blue Melbourne sky and sunlight where visitors and fans can once again see the Goddess of Pop in all her bronze glory. It's never too late for Melbourne to once again do the locomotion. We believe in you."
