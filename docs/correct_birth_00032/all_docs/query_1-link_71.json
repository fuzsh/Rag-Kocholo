After a successful career as a dancer, he went on to take a leading role in casting, coaching, movement directing and choreographing music videos, world tours, media campaigns, and trade/fashion shows for Christian Louboutin, Diesel, Puma, Jean-Paul Gaultier among others. He has also appeared on television and movies, fashion shows, and advertising campaigns himself, and performed in Britain's Got Talent, Celebrity X Factor, the Brit Awards and The Royal Variety Show.Arthur and Anne met in 2010 when she was working for Christian Louboutin. They collaborated on a project for online platform Fashionair, when Arthur trained Christian for his first and only dance performance, which culminated in a viral video that saw the famous shoe designer tap dance his way in a dream sequence on a London stage. In this conversation, Arthur shares with Anne his harrowing journey from Armenia to Belgium as a refugee with his family, escaping the war when he was just twelve years old. Then how, while their refugee status was still being decided, his family was rocked by the death of his father. Shortly after, young Arthur left for Brussels to try his hand at hairdressing, only to find himself being picked out of the crowd and selected as a dancer. From there, Arthur discusses his many surprises and successes, how he went from Milan to London, and made his mark on the dance scene as a performer before turning to choreography and creative direction. Arthur dreamt of making it big, an homage to his father, and moving away from the refugee status he carried as an adolescent. The successful and charismatic personality is also the other half of one of Ireland's most beloved celebrity couples, as he is married to Big Brother alumni/star Brian Dowling. The two of them recently welcomed their first child into the world, Blake Maria Rose, and Arthur shares the ups and downs that have led to this most joyous moment. Arthur's story is quite unlike any other. As Anne reflects to him, it's epic enough to be hinting at Joseph Campbell's hero's journey. A sparkling, touching and deeply positive interview with someone who will certainly light up your day. Happy listening.Favourite quote of the episode: ‘I only keep things that Arthur wants to keep because I only keep what I think is best for me. Why would I listen to you? It's your journey. I want to create my own journey.' ***You can out more about Arthur on his website: http://arthurgourounlian.com/IG - https://www.instagram.com/gourounlian/Facebook - Arthur Gourounlian - https://www.facebook.com/arthurgourounlianand his Youtube Channel - https://www.youtube.com/user/arthurgourounlianand Vimeo - https://vimeo.com/arthurgourounlianThe Fashionair film Dancer in a Day Dream featuring Christian Louboutin and Arthur - https://youtu.be/esXVbslAvVYThe making of the film - https://youtu.be/ZxwocNpdl4QYou can also discover Arthur's new venture, AG Socks - https://theagofficial.com/products/the-gourounlianNotre Dame de Paris, the musical - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame_de_Paris_(musical)Sous le Soleil TV show -https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172057/The podcast Mamia & Me featuring Arthur and his husband Brian Dowling - https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/dont-wake-the-baby-with-brian-dowling/id1570246269?i=1000559798535The blooper real with Arthur and Brian touching up their hair - https://youtu.be/MPMxXk0usVIThe song 'Maniac' by Michael Sambello - https://open.spotify.com/track/7CML07e8m56LrmgkC4Bl3Z?si=9462b40d81fb4e98Dancing with the Stars Ireland - https://www.rte.ie/tv/programmes/dancing-with-the-stars/***If you enjoyed this episode, click subscribe for more, and consider writing a review of the show on Apple Podcasts, we really appreciate your support and feedback.

A talented vocalist,accomplished songwriter, and innovative producer, Maddix has not only pioneered a unique blend of gospel and house music but has also cultivated a diverse community of over 150 members, transforming the choir into a symbol of unity, peace, and resilience. Under her guidance, the House Gospel Choir has flourished, performing at prestigious venues and events such as Glastonbury and BBC Gospel Christmas, and collaborating with esteemed artists including Kylie Minogue, Paolo Nutini, Rudimental amongst many others. This journey from a modest group of 12 vocalists to an international sensation mirrors Maddix's dedication to harnessing the power of collective music-making as a force for change. Her mantra, “We can't all speak at the same time and have our voices heard, but we can sing together as one voice and be understood,” encapsulates her philosophy and the choir's ethos. HGC burst onto the scene with ‘Salvation' in a debut single that was crowned BBC Radio 1 ‘Hottest Record' by Annie Mac , peaking at #1 in the Music Week Cool Cuts Chart and #5 in the Billboard Dance Club Chart. Releasing their acclaimed 14-track LP in October 2020 via Island Records, RE//CHOIRED was born out of a love for sound system culture, the healing power of house music and the group seeking to channel the magic of people working together to raise the vibrations. Their latest releases include collaborations with an eclectic mix of talent including Ella Henderson, Rudimental, Duane Harden and Purple Disco Machine House Gospel Choir's live sets create a fusion of the biggest house, gospel and garage tunes that make every performance an unforgettable experience. That is the beauty of HGC, taking us to new heights of euphoria, imploring us to feel empowered, connected and always looking for a chance to uplift our voices with theirs. They remind us of the altitude of our last euphoric club moment and with each note, we're there again, watching the magic unfold in front of us, ready to receive.

Single \"Make This A Special Night\" harked back to some of SAW's earliest releases when they dabbled in R&B — and was one of several tracks recorded with the group, which was now a trio. Singer Lauraine McIntosh talks about Cool Notes' progression from reggae outfit to commercially successful soul group with mid-'80s hits \"Spend The Night\" and \"In Your Car\" — and the downturn in popularity that followed. She reveals the never-before-discussed story behind her 1988 guest vocal on \"Don't Make Me Wait\" by Bomb The Bass and how she wound up as a session singer at PWL, which led to Cool Notes' deal. Meanwhile, Kylie Minogue was also taken in a more soulful direction with \"If You Were With Me Now\", her big ballad duet with R&B sensation Keith Washington. Former PWL engineer Pete Day shares his memories of recording with Keith and we discuss the song's video and promotion, including the approach Kylie's Australian record company took with the single. Former Yell! member Paul Varney returned to PWL as a solo artist, but it seems the company didn't quite know what to do with him, almost releasing Kenny Thomas-esque track \"If Only I Knew\" before opting for the more pop-influenced \"So Proud Of You\", with both tracks ending up having a connection with the work of in-demand house producer and remixer Steve \"Silk\" Hurley.
