        "text": "Kylie Minogue is well and truly settled in the city of Melbourne following her move back to Australia, since she has launched her own wine label.\n\nThe 54-year-old popstar is targeting the Victorian wine market and has released a new pinot noir and chardonnay through her label Wines by Kylie Minogue in association with De Bortoli Wines in Yarra Valley.\n\nMinogue shared her excitement with the Herald Sun at the new launch of the Victorian wines, as her new venture owning an alcohol brand continues to expand.\n\nThe singer said: “Once we had launched the rosé, which was a success, the next conversation was we needed an Australian wine.\n\n“I need to be travelling the world with some Australian representation.”\n\nThe release comes after Minogue returned to her native country this year.\n\nThe Can’t Get You Out of My Head singer added that one of the perks of her latest launch is that it is happening within familiar surroundings.\n\n“I’m an hour or so from where I grew up. I love that [this wine is] in Victoria. I’m really proud of that,” Minogue said.\n\nThe singer’s wine brand business opened in 2020, first starting with a rosé, then flourishing into a series of creations, with a prosecco rosé and zero alcohol number.\n\nDe Bortoli Yarra Valley winemaker Steve Webber and Leanne De Bortoli will produce the new pinot noir and chardonnay next year, after which it will become readily available.\n\nPrior to releasing her wines in Australia, Minogue took to the lucrative American market, launching the drinks in June with a performance at New York City’s famous Café Carlyle and an online wine tasting.\n\nThe pop icon described the release as an unforgettable moment on Instagram at the time.\n\nMinogue said: “What a night! A true \"pinch-me moment\" performing at the iconic Café Carlyle in New York City."
