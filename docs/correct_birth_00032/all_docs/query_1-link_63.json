        "meta_description": "Australia - Culture, Diversity, Indigenous: Australia’s isolation as an island continent has done much to shape—and inhibit—its culture. The Aboriginal peoples developed their accommodation with the environment over a period of at least 40,000 years, during which time they had little contact with the outside world. When Britain settled New South Wales as a penal colony in 1788, it did so partly because of the continent’s remoteness. Australia’s convict heritage ensured that European perceptions of the environment were often influenced by the sense of exile and alienation. Yet, the distance from Britain—and the isolation it imposed—strengthened rather than weakened ties with it. The ambivalence of",

        "text": "Music\n\nLike the other arts in Australia, music there has two distinct traditions: those of the European colonists and those of the indigenous peoples, whose singing and ritual playing of the didjeridu (a drone instrument) reenact the ancient traditions related to a mythological time called the Dreaming, the Aboriginal conception of creation. Contemporary Aboriginal bands (such as Warumpi Band and Yothu Yindi in the early 21st century) incorporate elements of ancestral rituals. The European-based musical tradition also maintains its vitality in the contemporary scene. Australian opera fans can point to talent ranging from the popular coloratura soprano Dame Nellie Melba to the Australian filmmaker Baz Luhrmann’s 21st-century production of Giacomo Puccini’s La Bohème. Traditional symphony orchestras abound,\n\nAustralian musicians also have made important contributions to the development of rock music, which has been central to Australian popular culture since the late 1950s, when Americans Bill Haley and His Comets first brought rock and roll to Australia. In 1958 Johnny O’Keefe became the first Australian rock and roll singer to reach the national charts, with his hit “Wild One.” The first Australian rockers to have an impact outside the country were the Easybeats, who formed at an immigrant hostel near Sydney and scored an international hit with “Friday on My Mind” in 1966. Although the Easybeats would struggle to repeat that success, two of the band’s members, George Young and Harry Vanda, would go on to be a prolific songwriting and producing team. Moreover, two of Young’s brothers would later be key contributors to one of Australia’s biggest musical exports, superstar heavy metal band AC/DC. Another set of Australian siblings, the Bee Gees (short for Brothers Gibb), found similar international success in the pop and disco realm.\n\nAC/DC had emerged from Australia’s vibrant pub rock scene. Live-music venues thrived throughout the country and produced a number of bands that enjoyed limited foreign success but had huge followings in Australia and other bands that were popular beyond the country’s borders. Among the most notable were Daddy Cool (”Eagle Rock,” 1971), the Masters Apprentices, hard-rocking Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs, soft rockers Air Supply and the Little River Band, blues-based Chain, glam rockers Skyhooks, and Cold Chisel, which was fronted by raspy-voiced everyman Jimmy Barnes and whose 1973 anthem “Khe Sanh” evocatively conveys the experience of Australian veterans of the Vietnam War. Female vocalists Helen Reddy, Olivia Newton-John, and, later, Kylie Minogue found success by taking their talents abroad."
