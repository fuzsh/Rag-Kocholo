        "text": "Another fantastic addition to this wonderful series.\n\nEach book has vibrant illustrations and easy to understand information without it being too difficult to understand.\n\nI cannot recommend this series enough and it is so lovely to see another addition to Australian heros. Hopefully this won't be the last!\n\nThis series rarely has misses, but due to the volume of releases readers have to pick and choose the ones they buy for their children.\n\nIs this one top tier? Probably not, but it is fun, diverting and the artwork is vibrant. As a same sex parent, it’s essential for my kids gay education, and a very enjoyable read out loud!\n\nI loved the details in the illustrations, especially ABBA! I forgot that she was on Tv in Australia. And 5 decades in a row with a chart topping album?! I especially liked the extended biography in the back featuring everything she does for Pride.\n\nBefore leafing through this book, I didn't have Kylie Minogue or her music on the forefront of my mind exactly, but it brought back a lot of memories from the early noughties for me, and I'm currently finding myself listening to a best-of Kylie playlist. This was cute, fun, adorable.\n\nLove these books.\n\nLoved they have done Kylie too. Everyone thinks they know Kylie’s life but the don’t. She is an astounding woman and one to be celebrated at that!\n\nWill be purchasing in hard back too\n\nAs always the little people, big dreams series are fantastic. Being a Kylie fan growing up I just had to request this one! The illustrations always reflect who the story about and this time the book was bright and colourful just as Kylie herself has been in her career.\n\nI always look forward to a book in this series as you learn about the individual without the information being too overloaded.\n\nMaria is the best author! I love her books so much.\n\nThey are the perfect addition to any child's bookshelf. Perfect for educational and entertainment settings, Maria covers all bases in her writing.\n\nThe book of Kylie is upto her usual impeccable standard!\n\nAnother amazing addition to the LPBD library, I remember that first appearance of Charlene in Neighbour like it was yesterday so was so chuffed to see Kylie being added to this iconic collection. Kylie has had such an inspiring life and overcome so many obstacles along the way - not least her cancer diagnosis. She is a much-loved musician and has been a huge part of my life growing up. One to cherish and add to our collection for sure.\n\nKylie grew up in Australia with her parents, sister, and brother. Following in her sister's path, she got into acting first, and went from soaps to becoming a pop star on three continents. in the course of time she won her second ever Grammy Award, two decades after her first.\n\nThe illustrations by Rebecca Gibbon are fun, simple, brilliantly colorful, and delightful.\n\nWell suited for reading WITH someone of any age including ESL, and great for gifting to anyone, but especially to a school or your local public library!\n\nI requested and received a free temporary e-book on Adobe Digital Editions from Quarto Publishing Group/Frances Lincoln Children's Books via NetGalley. Thank you! Expected publication March 5, 2024\n\n@QuartoKids @CBCBook @Frances_Lincoln #(LittlePeopleBIG DREAMS @sanchezvegara @TheQuartoGroup #BreastCancerSurvivor\n\ni first heard Kylie Minogue name in 2020 but after that she completely out of my radar again. reading this was a nice way to know her, and now little kids can know her too. cute & lovely illustration as usual!\n\nThank you so much for an advance copy of this book in exchange for my honest opinion.\n\nLittle People, Big Dreams is one of my favourite series ever. As an adult, I keep collecting them, especially the ones about women, and this one was quite fun to read.\n\nI have listened to, danced to and sung Kylie Minogue songs for year, but I knew very little about her life. Learning some more was great and I think she is very inspiring to many people!\n\nThis series is TOP!\n\nI received a complimentary copy of this book via Netgalley. Opinions expressed in this review are my own\n\nI was never a big Kylie Minogue fan, but I love the Little People, Big Dreams, so I was excited to review this book.\n\nI have a brand new respect for Miss Minogue. 5 generations of music is amazing, and she is a breast cancer survivor like my mom and so many others. This book was about strength and never giving up.\n\nWe love this series and Kylie Minogue! There was a lot I didn’t know about Kylie and I think this book does a great job giving little ones just enough information. It’s not too overwhelming. The illustrations as always are amazing.\n\nFor those who enjoy reading these easily-digestible \"Little People Big Dreams\" biographies (and, I do!), Kylie Minogue is a satisfying entry. Likewise, fans of Kylie are sure to enjoy this child-friendly synopsis of Kylie's 30+ years in the entertainment biz. Fans of naive art illustration will also embrace this book...the drawings are adorable! But for everyone else, Kylie Minogue, in both human and book form, is probably not relevant (or ground-breaking, or history-making) enough to young readers to merit a recommendation.\n\nThanks to NetGalley, the author, and the publisher for providing a free e-copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.\n\nThis is the first Little People, Big Dreams book i've read with an Australian star - and as an Aussie who grew up singing along with Kylie - what a great place to start. The illustrations seemed especially gorgeous - and I loved that Dannii got a mention, as did Kylie's battle with breast cancer.\n\nKylie Minogue is not a new topic in my life. But never did I know that she was once an actress, I know her songs only. But her life is so inspiring, and the author can brought out the beauty of her struggles and it paid off. An inspiring story to read by many."
