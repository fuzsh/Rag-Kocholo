        "text": "5 . Helen Reddy ( 1941 - 2020 )\n\nWith an HPI of 53.31 , Helen Reddy is the 5th most famous Australian Singer . Her biography has been translated into 35 different languages.\n\nHelen Maxine Reddy (25 October 1941 – 29 September 2020) was an Australian-American singer, actress, television host, and activist. Born in Melbourne to a show business family, Reddy started her career as an entertainer at age four. She sang on radio and television and won a talent contest on the television program Bandstand in 1966; her prize was a ticket to New York City and a record audition, which was unsuccessful. After a short and unsuccessful singing career in New York, she eventually moved to Chicago, and subsequently, Los Angeles, where she made her debut singles \"One Way Ticket\" and \"I Believe in Music\" in 1968 and 1970, respectively. The B-side of the latter single, \"I Don't Know How to Love Him\", reached number eight on the pop chart of the Canadian magazine RPM. She was signed to Capitol Records a year later. During the 1970s, Reddy enjoyed international success, especially in the United States, where she placed 15 singles on the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100. Six made the top 10 and three reached number one, including her signature hit \"I Am Woman\". She placed 25 songs on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart; 15 made the top 10 and eight reached number one, six consecutively. In 1974, at the inaugural American Music Awards, she won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist. On television, she was the first Australian to host a one-hour weekly primetime variety show on an American network, along with specials that were seen in more than 40 countries. Between the 1980s and 1990s, as her single \"I Can't Say Goodbye to You\" (1981) became her last to chart in the US, Reddy acted in musicals and recorded albums such as Center Stage before retiring from live performance in 2002. She returned to university in Australia, earned a degree, and practised as a clinical hypnotherapist and motivational speaker. In 2011, after singing \"Breezin' Along with the Breeze\" with her half-sister, Toni Lamond, for Lamond's birthday, Reddy decided to return to live performing. Reddy's song \"I Am Woman\" played a significant role in popular culture, becoming an anthem for second-wave feminism. She came to be known as a \"feminist poster girl\" or a \"feminist icon\". In 2011, Billboard named her the number-28 adult contemporary artist of all time (the number-9 woman). In 2013, the Chicago Tribune dubbed her the \"Queen of '70s Pop\". Helen Maxine Reddy was born into a well-known Australian showbusiness family in Melbourne. Her mother was Stella Campbell (née Lamond), an actress, singer and dancer; her father was Maxwell David Reddy (born 1914 in Melbourne, Victoria), a writer, producer and actor. Her mother performed at the Majestic Theatre in Sydney and was best-known as a regular cast member on the television programs Homicide (1964), Bellbird (1967) and Country Town (1971). During Reddy's childhood, she was educated at Tintern Grammar and later Stratherne Girls' School in Hawthorn for a short time (mostly to study drama). Her half-sister Toni Lamond and her nephew Tony Sheldon are actor-singers. Reddy had Irish, Scottish and English ancestry. Her great-great-grandfather, Edward Reddy, was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1855. Her Scottish great-grandfather, Thomas Lamond, was a one-time mayor of Waterloo, New South Wales, whose patron was Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead. Patsy Reddy, a former New Zealand governor-general, is a distant cousin. Reddy was born during World War II. Her father was a sergeant in the Australian Army with a unit of entertainers, serving in New Guinea with one of his actor friends, Peter Finch, at the time of Reddy's birth. Her father returned to service during the Korean War. At age four, Reddy joined her parents on the Australian vaudeville circuit, singing and dancing; she recalled: \"It was instilled in me: 'You will be a star'. So between the ages of 12 and 17, I got rebellious and decided this was not for me. I was going to be a housewife and mother.\" At age 12, owing to her parents' constant touring nationwide and their arguing, Reddy went to live with her paternal aunt, Helen \"Nell\" Reddy, \"who was her role model\"; as her aunt, \"she gave her niece stability, a sense of morality, and strength\" for her future career as a singer who motivated women. The younger Helen's teenaged rebellion in favour of domesticity manifested as marriage to Kenneth Claude Weate, a considerably older musician and family friend; divorce ensued, and to support herself as a single mother to daughter Traci, she resumed her performing career, concentrating on singing, since health problems precluded dancing (she had a kidney removed at 17). She sang on radio and television, eventually winning a talent contest on the Australian pop music TV show Bandstand, the prize ostensibly being a trip to New York City to cut a single for Mercury Records. After arriving in New York in 1966, she was informed by Mercury that her prize was only the chance to \"audition\" for the label and that Mercury considered the Bandstand footage to constitute her audition, which was deemed unsuccessful. Despite having only US$200 (equivalent to $1,878 in 2023) and a return ticket to Australia, she decided to remain in the United States with three-year-old Traci and pursue a singing career. Reddy recalled her 1966 appearance at the Three Rivers Inn in Syracuse, New York—\"[T]here were like twelve people in the audience\"—as being typical of her early US performing career. Her lack of a work permit made it difficult to obtain singing jobs and she was forced to make trips to Canada which did not require work permits for citizens of Commonwealth countries. In 1968, Martin St James, an Australian stage hypnotist she had met in New York City, threw Reddy a party with an admission price of US$5 (equivalent to $43.81 in 2023) to enable Reddy—then down to her last US$12 (equivalent to $105.14 in 2023)—to pay her rent. On this occasion, Reddy met her future manager and husband, Jeff Wald, a 22-year-old secretary at the William Morris Agency who crashed the party. Reddy told People in 1975, \"[Wald] didn't pay the five dollars, but it was love at first sight.\" Wald recalled that Reddy and he married three days after meeting and, along with daughter Traci, the couple took up residence at the Hotel Albert in Greenwich Village. Reddy later stated that she married Wald \"out of desperation over her right to work and live in the United States\". According to New York Magazine, Wald was fired from William Morris soon after having met Reddy and \"Helen supported them for six months doing $35-a-night hospital and charity benefits. They were so broke that they snuck out of a hotel room carrying their clothes in paper bags.\" Reddy recalled: \"When we did eat, it was spaghetti, and we spent what little money we had on cockroach spray.\" They left New York City for Chicago, where Wald landed a job as talent coordinator at Mister Kelly's. While in Chicago, Reddy gained a reputation singing in local lounges, including Mister Kelly's, and in 1968 she landed a deal with Fontana Records, a division of major-label Chicago-based Mercury Records. Her first single, \"One Way Ticket\", on Fontana was not an American hit but it did give Reddy her first appearance on any chart as it peaked at number 83 in her native Australia. Within a year, Wald moved Reddy and Traci to Los Angeles, where he was hired at Capitol Records, the label under which Reddy was to attain stardom; however, Wald was hired and fired the same day. At the same time, in 1969, Reddy enrolled at the University of California Los Angeles to study psychology and philosophy part-time. Reddy became frustrated as Wald found success managing acts such as Deep Purple and Tiny Tim without making any evident effort to promote her; after 18 months of career inactivity, Reddy gave Wald an ultimatum: \"he [must] either revitalise her career or get out... Jeff threw himself into his new career as Mr. Helen Reddy. Five months of phone calls to Capitol Records executive Artie Mogull finally paid off; Mogull agreed to let Helen cut one single if Jeff promised not to call for a month. She did \"I Believe in Music\" penned by Mac Davis backed with \"I Don't Know How to Love Him\" from Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber's Jesus Christ Superstar. The A-side fell flat, but then some Canadian DJs flipped the record over and it became a hit – number 13 in June 1971 – and Helen Reddy was on her way.\" Reddy's stardom was solidified when her single \"I Am Woman\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in December 1972. The song was co-written by Reddy with Ray Burton; Reddy attributed the impetus for writing \"I Am Woman\" and her early awareness of the women's movement to expatriate Australian rock critic and pioneer feminist Lillian Roxon. Reddy is quoted in Fred Bronson's The Billboard Book of Number One Hits as having said that she was looking for songs to record which reflected the positive self-image she had gained from joining the women's movement but could not find any, so \"I realised that the song I was looking for didn't exist, and I was going to have to write it myself.\" \"I Am Woman\" first appeared on her debut album I Don't Know How to Love Him, released in May 1971. A new recording of the song was released as a single in May 1972 but barely dented the charts. Female listeners soon adopted the song as an anthem and began requesting it from their local radio stations in droves, resulting in its September chart re-entry and eventual number-one peak. \"I Am Woman\" earned Reddy a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. At the awards ceremony, Reddy concluded her acceptance speech by famously thanking God \"because She makes everything possible\". The success of \"I Am Woman\" made Reddy the first Australian singer to top the US charts. Three decades after her Grammy, Reddy discussed the song's iconic status: \"I think it came along at the right time. I'd gotten involved in the women's movement, and there were a lot of songs on the radio about being weak and being dainty and all those sort of things. All the women in my family, they were strong women. They worked. They lived through the Depression and a world war, and they were just strong women. I certainly didn't see myself as being dainty\", she said. Over the next five years following her first success, Reddy had more than a dozen US top-40 hits, including two more number-one hits. These tracks included Kenny Rankin's \"Peaceful\" (number 12), the Alex Harvey country ballad \"Delta Dawn\" (number one), Linda Laurie's \"Leave Me Alone (Ruby Red Dress)\" (number three), Danny Janssen & Bobby Hart's \"Keep on Singing\" (number 15), Paul Williams' \"You and Me Against the World\" (featuring daughter Traci reciting the spoken bookends) (number 9), Alan O'Day's \"Angie Baby\" (number one), Véronique Sanson and Patti Dahlstrom's \"Emotion\" (number 22), Harriet Schock's \"Ain't No Way to Treat a Lady\" (number eight) and the Richard Kerr/Will Jennings-penned \"Somewhere in the Night\" (number 19). She also had two Australian number-one singles, while \"Angie Baby\" was her only UK top-40 hit. On 23 July 1974, Reddy received a star, located at 1750 Vine Street, on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her work in the music industry. In late 1975, Reddy toured East Asia, Australia and New Zealand and collected 16 gold records, including 6 gold records in Australia and 6 gold records in New Zealand. At the height of her fame in the mid 1970s, Reddy was a headliner, with a full chorus of backup singers and dancers to standing-room-only crowds on the Las Vegas Strip. Among her opening acts were Joan Rivers, David Letterman, Bill Cosby and Barry Manilow. In 1976, Reddy recorded the Beatles' song \"The Fool on the Hill\" for the musical documentary All This and World War II. Reddy was also instrumental in supporting the career of friend Olivia Newton-John, encouraging her to move from England to the United States in the early 1970s, giving her professional opportunities that did not exist in the United Kingdom. At a dinner party at Reddy's house, Newton-John met producer Allan Carr, who offered her the starring role in the hit film version of the musical Grease. Reddy was most successful on the Easy Listening chart, scoring eight number-one hits there over a three-year span, from \"Delta Dawn\" in 1973 to \"I Can't Hear You No More\" in 1976. However, the latter track evidenced a sharp drop in popularity for Reddy, with a number-29 peak on the Billboard Hot 100. Reddy's 1977 remake of Cilla Black's 1964 hit \"You're My World\" indicated comeback potential, with a number-18 peak, but this track – co-produced by Kim Fowley – would prove to be Reddy's last top-40 hit. Its source album, Ear Candy, Reddy's 10th album, became her first album to not attain at least gold status since her second full-length release, 1972's Helen Reddy. In 1978, Reddy sang as a backup singer on Gene Simmons's solo album on the song \"True Confessions\". That year also saw the release of Reddy's only live album, Live in London, recorded at the London Palladium. Of Reddy's eight subsequent single releases on Capitol, five reached the Easy Listening top 50 – including \"Candle on the Water\", from the 1977 Disney film Pete's Dragon (which starred Reddy). Only three ranked on the Billboard Hot 100: \"The Happy Girls\" (number 57) – the follow-up to \"You're My World\", and besides \"I Am Woman\", Reddy's only chart item that she co-wrote – and the disco tracks \"Ready or Not\" (number 73) and \"Make Love to Me\" (number 60), the latter a cover of an Australian hit by Kelly Marie, which gave Reddy a lone R&B chart ranking at number 59. Reddy also made it to number 98 on the Country chart with \"Laissez les bon Temps Rouler\", the B-side to \"The Happy Girls\". Without the impetus of any major hits, Reddy's four Capitol album releases subsequent to Ear Candy failed to chart. In 1981, she said: \"I signed [with Capitol] ten years ago ... And when you are with a company so long you tend to be taken for granted. For the last three years, I didn't feel I was getting the support from them.\" May 1981 had the release of Play Me Out, Reddy's debut album for MCA Records, which she said had \"made me a deal we [Reddy and Wald] couldn't refuse\"; \"we shopped around and felt the most enthusiasm at MCA\". Reddy's new label affiliation would result in only one minor success; her remake of Becky Hobbs's 1979 country hit \"I Can't Say Goodbye to You\" returned her for the last time to the Billboard Hot 100 at number 88; it also returned Reddy to the charts in the UK and Ireland (her sole previous hit in both was \"Angie Baby\"). Her 14 November 1981 Top of the Pops performance brought \"I Can't Say Goodbye to You\" into the UK top 50; the track would rise there no higher than number 43, but in Ireland reached number 16, giving Reddy her final high placing on a major national chart. MCA released one further Reddy album, Imagination, in 1983; it would prove to be Reddy's final release as a career recording artist. The unsuccessful Imagination was released just after the finalisation of Reddy's divorce from Wald, whose alleged subsequent interference in her career she blamed for the decline of her career profile in the mid-1980s: \"Several of my performing contracts were cancelled, and one promoter told me he couldn't book me in case a certain someone 'came after him with a shotgun'.\" Reddy states that she was effectively being blacklisted from her established performance areas, which led to her pursuing a career in theatre where Wald had no significant influence. In 1990, Reddy issued Feel So Young on her own label – an album that includes remakes of her repertoire favourites. Meanwhile, her one recording in the interim had been the 1987 dance maxisingle \"Mysterious Kind\", on which Reddy had vocally supported Jessica Williams. The 1997 release of Center Stage was an album of show tunes which Reddy recorded for Varèse Sarabande; the track \"Surrender\" – originating in Sunset Boulevard – was remixed for release as a dance maxisingle. Reddy's final album was the 2000 seasonal release The Best Christmas Ever. In April 2015, Reddy released a cover of the Beatles' \"All You Need Is Love\" for the album Keep Calm and Salute The Beatles on the Purple Pyramid label. Reddy announced her retirement from performing in 2002, giving her farewell performance with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra. The same year, she moved from her longtime residence in Santa Monica, California, back to her native Australia to spend time with her family, living first on Norfolk Island before taking up residence in Sydney. Reddy also earned a degree in clinical hypnotherapy and neuro-linguistic programming. She was a practising clinical hypnotherapist and patron of the Australian Society of Clinical Hypnotherapists. At a ceremony in August 2006, Reddy was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame by actress singer, Toni Collette, who described her song, \"I Am Woman\", as \"timeless\". The song was performed by fellow Australian, Vanessa Amorosi. In April 2008, Reddy was reported to be living \"simply and frugally off song royalties, pension funds, and social security ... [renting] a 13th-floor apartment with a 180° view of Sydney Harbour\". Her apartment had been recently appraised, causing Reddy concern over its future affordability; however, the New York-based landlord learned his tenant's identity and wrote her: \"I had no idea it was the Helen Reddy who was living in my unit. Because of what you have done for millions of women all over the world, I will not sell or raise your rent. I hope you'll be very happy living there for years to come.\" For several years, Reddy maintained that she would not return to the stage. In 2008, she stated, \"It's not going to happen. I've moved on\", and explained that her voice had deepened to a lower key and she was not sure if she would be able to sing some of her hits. She also said that she had simply lost interest in performing, saying that \"I have very wide-ranging interests\". In 2011 she was interviewed by Australian television and said she was very happy to be retired from show business. In 2011, Reddy decided to return to performing after being buoyed by the warm reception she received when she sang at her sister's 80th birthday party. \"I hadn't heard my voice in 10 years, and when I heard it coming over the speaker, it was like: 'Oh, that’s not bad. Maybe I should do that again,'\" Reddy explained in 2013. Being more in control of her performances also appealed to Reddy, who said, \"I have more leeway in the songs that I choose to sing. I'm not locked into what the record company wants.\" She explained, \"One of the reasons that I'm coming back to singing is because I'm not doing the greatest hits. I'm doing the songs that I always loved. So many are album cuts that never got any airplay, and they're gorgeous songs.\" She also performed many of her best-known songs, including, \"Angie Baby\", \"You and Me Against the World\", a medley of \"Delta Dawn\"/\"Ain't No Way to Treat a Lady\", and \"I Am Woman\", reasoning on the latter that the audience \"comes to hear\" it. She said she refused to sing \"Leave Me Alone (Ruby Red Dress)\" because she disliked the monotony of the repeated chorus. \"They used to have a contest on the radio that you could get two free tickets to Helen Reddy's show if you could tell us how many times she sang \"leave me alone\". I think it was like 42 times,\" she said. Reddy appeared in downtown Los Angeles at the 2017 Women's March on 21 January. The march for women's rights and unity following the inauguration of Donald Trump brought out 750,000 people. Reddy was introduced by actress Jamie Lee Curtis and sang an a cappella version of \"I Am Woman\". In August 2015, unnamed sources revealed that Reddy was diagnosed with dementia and had moved into the Motion Picture and Television Fund's Samuel Goldwyn Center, where she was cared for by family and friends. A frequent guest on talk shows and variety programs of the 1970s and early 1980s – with credits including The Bobby Darin Show, The Carol Burnett Show and The Muppet Show – Reddy helmed the 1973 summer replacement series for The Flip Wilson Show (Reddy had become friends with Flip Wilson when she worked the Chicago club circuit early in her career); the series, The Helen Reddy Show, provided early national exposure for Albert Brooks and the Pointer Sisters. She also served as the semiregular host of the late-night variety show The Midnight Special in 1975 and 1976. Reddy's film career included a starring role in Walt Disney's Pete's Dragon, introducing the Oscar-nominated song \"Candle on the Water\" and the role of a nun in Airport 1975, singing her own composition \"Best Friend\". For her part in Airport 1975, Reddy was nominated for a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer – Female. Reddy was one of many musical stars featured in the all-star chorale in the film Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1978). She later played cameo roles in the films Disorderlies (1987) and The Perfect Host (2010). Despite her late 1970s decline on the music charts, Reddy still had sufficient star power in 1979 to host The Helen Reddy Special, broadcast that May on ABC-TV, of which Jeff Wald was the producer. In September 1981, Reddy announced she would be shooting the pilot for her own TV sitcom, in which she would play a single mother working as a lounge singer in Lake Tahoe, but the project was abandoned. She was an occasional television guest star as an actress, appearing on the television programs The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, The Jeffersons (as herself), Diagnosis: Murder and BeastMaster. In the mid-1980s, Reddy embarked on a new career in the theatre. She mostly worked in musicals, including Anything Goes, Call Me Madam, The Mystery of Edwin Drood and – both on Broadway and the West End – Blood Brothers. She also appeared in four productions of the one-woman show Shirley Valentine. Reddy's notable stage roles included: Shirley Valentine – as Shirley, which she performed in numerous venues across the US in 1997. Blood Brothers – as Mrs Johnstone – Broadway (1995), West End and Liverpool. Love, Julie – as Gail Sinclair. The Mystery of Edwin Drood – as Edwin Drood/Miss Alice Nutting – Sacramento Music Circus. Call Me Madam – as Mrs Sally Adams – Sacramento Music Circus (August 1986). Anything Goes – as Reno Sweeney Long Beach Civic Light Opera (July 1987). Sacramento Music Circus (July 1985). Senior Entourage – as Helen – (May 2021). In 2007, Reddy had a voice cameo as herself in the Family Guy television show's Star Wars parody, \"Blue Harvest\". In 2011, she guest-starred on Family Guy again, singing the opening theme song for the show's fictional Channel 5 News telecast. Reddy became a naturalised American citizen in 1974, saying after the ceremony, \"I feel like I'd like to have a cup of tea and a good cry.\" She resumed her Australian citizenship subsequently, when the opportunity to maintain dual American–Australian citizenship became available. Reddy was active in community affairs: In the 1970s, she helped raise millions of dollars for Democratic political candidates. In July 1977, Californian governor Jerry Brown appointed Reddy to the nine-member commission overseeing the California Department of Parks and Recreation. Her nomination was unanimously approved. She served on the commission until 1980. Three of Reddy's forebears left Ireland and went to Canada, Australia and New Zealand. A distant cousin, former New Zealand governor-general Patsy Reddy, is descended from their mutual New Zealand forebear. Reddy was an enthusiastic genealogist; she researched her family's history extensively and founded the Tasmanian Genealogical Society. \"Genealogy is addictive; it begins as an interest, becomes a hobby, then a passion, and finally an obsession. Not only with each generation uncovered does the number of people to investigate double, but so too does the desire to understand the forces that shaped them,\" she wrote in her autobiography. She was asked in an interview whether her name had any connection to the Reddy caste from India. Her response was: \"I have done some research on my father's side; most of my research has been done on my mother's side. His father was born in Ireland, but his great-grandfather served with an Irish regiment stationed in India, so it is possible that I have Indian ancestry. But it has not yet been established.\" At age 20, Reddy married Kenneth Claude Weate, an older musician and family friend whom she says she wed to defy her parents, who wished her to follow them into show business. The couple separated not long after the birth of their daughter, Traci. In 1968, she married Jeff Wald, a native of the Bronx. She converted to Judaism before marrying Wald, with whom she had a son, Jordan, born in 1972. In a 1975 People interview, Reddy admitted that her relationship with then-husband and manager Wald was volatile, with the couple having \"huge, healthy fights\", but that she owed her success (she was then the world's biggest-selling female vocalist for two consecutive years) to Wald: \"He runs it all. Naturally, when the moment of performance comes I have to deliver – but everything else is him. It's not my career; it's our career.\" By 2 January 1981, Reddy and Wald had separated and he had moved into a Beverly Hills treatment facility to overcome an eight-year cocaine addiction, a US$100,000-per-year habit (US$315,724 in 2023). Reddy subsequently filed for divorce, yet withdrew her petition the day after filing it, stating: \"After 13 years of marriage, a separation of one month is too short to make a decision.\" In 1982, after finding evidence of Wald's continued substance abuse, Reddy again separated from him and initiated divorce proceedings, which this time went through in January 1983. They agreed to shared custody of their son Jordan, but later became embroiled in a court battle after both filed for sole custody. Her son later changed his surname to Sommers and became her assistant. In June 1983, she married Milton Ruth, a drummer in her band; the couple divorced in 1995. Reddy died at the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital in Los Angeles on 29 September 2020, at the age of 78. She suffered from Addison's disease and dementia in her later years. No cause of death was given. Reddy's second husband and former manager, Jeff Wald, died on November 12, 2021, at the age of 77. A biographical film about Reddy titled I Am Woman was released in 2019, in which Reddy is played by Tilda Cobham-Hervey. The American Music Awards (AMAs) is an annual American music awards show.

Natalie Imbruglia (b. 1975 )\n\nWith an HPI of 52.32 , Natalie Imbruglia is the 6th most famous Australian Singer . Her biography has been translated into 52 different languages.\n\nNatalie Jane Imbruglia ( im-BROO-lee-ə, Italian: [imˈbruʎʎa]; born 4 February 1975) is an Australian-British singer-songwriter and actress. Born and raised in Australia, Imbruglia became widely known in the early 1990s playing Beth Brennan in the soap opera Neighbours. After leaving the series, she moved to the UK and began a singing career. Her debut single, a cover of Ednaswap's song \"Torn\" (1997), quickly became a worldwide hit, topped the US Billboard Radio Songs Chart for eleven weeks in 1998, and was listed on the 50 Best Songs of the 1990s by Rolling Stone. Her debut album, Left of the Middle (1997), was a commercial success, certified multi-platinum in the US, the UK and Australia and eventually sold seven million copies worldwide. Subsequent albums, including White Lilies Island (2001) and Counting Down the Days (2005), did not match the commercial success of her debut, but both albums still gained Gold certification in the UK. As of 2021, Imbruglia has released six studio albums and has sold more than ten million copies worldwide. Imbruglia has received various accolades, including eight ARIA Awards, two Brit Awards, one Billboard Music Award, one Silver Clef Award and three Grammy nominations. Imbruglia has appeared in several films, including Johnny English (2003) and Australian indie film Closed for Winter (2009). She has modelled for several brands, such as L'Oreal, Gap, and Kailis. Amongst other philanthropic work, Imbruglia served as a longtime spokesperson for Virgin Unite and campaigns to raise awareness of obstetric fistula. Imbruglia was born on 4 February 1975, in Sydney, Australia, second of four daughters of Maxene (née Anderson) and Elliot Imbruglia. Her father is of Italian descent, a Sicilian from Lipari who immigrated to Australia with his family aged five, and her mother is of Irish, Scottish and English descent, with an ancestor who arrived in Australia as a convict in the First Fleet. Imbruglia grew up in Berkeley Vale, New South Wales and attended Mater Dei College. At fifteen, she moved to Sydney with her family and studied ballet, tap and Highland dancing. Imbruglia appeared in Australian television commercials for Coca-Cola and the Australian snack Twisties. She left school at the age of sixteen, to pursue acting. She secured a role as Beth Brennan on the Australian soap opera Neighbours where she shared a house with Ben Mitchell who played the part of Cameron Hudson. By the end of her second year, she left the show to move to London in 1994. She met Anne Barret, who became her manager and convinced her to record a demo of four songs. She signed a record deal with BMG, after a demo of \"Torn\" impressed RCA Records. Imbruglia's first international single, \"Torn\", was a cover of a song whose first English version was made by Ednaswap, an American 1990s rock band, but it was earlier a Danish song released by Lis Sørensen The song was released on 27 October 1997 in the United Kingdom, and peaked at number two for three weeks on the UK Singles Chart. \"Torn\" eventually sold over one million copies in the UK alone and became one of the bestselling singles of 1990s in the UK ever. Following the success in the UK, the song was getting heavy airplay around the world since late 1997 but not in North America. \"Torn\" finally made its debut in the United States in January 1998 when a radio station, Los Angeles KROQ, who sensed the buzz and popularity of the song in international markets, started playing an import version of the song, which was quickly followed by other stations. MTV followed by playing its music video, and Saturday Night Live (SNL) booked Imbruglia for a live performance even before her album was available. \"Torn\" debuted at the Top 40 on Billboard Radio Songs Chart on 14 February 1998 and finally reached number one spot on 16 May 1998 and stayed at the summit for eleven consecutive weeks. To promote the album sales in the US, the record label decided not to release the physical single of the song, thus the song did not appear on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart during its popularity peak in mid-1998. The rule was changed due to the public and industry outcry in late-1998, and the song made its appearance on the chart for two weeks, and peaked at number 42. In other markets, \"Torn\" was a number one song in Canada, Denmark, and number two in her home country, Australia. Imbruglia performed \"Torn\" to promote the album and made several appearances on TV shows, including The Rosie O'Donnell Show, Saturday Night Live (SNL), The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and MTV Movie Awards in the United States, The Prince's Trust Party in the Park and Later... with Jools Holland in the United Kingdom, as well as Hey Hey It's Saturday in Australia. Imbruglia's debut album, Left of the Middle, was released on 24 November 1997. It sold 350,000 in the UK three weeks after release and was certified platinum. It has sold 7 million copies. The second single in the UK after \"Torn\" was \"Big Mistake\", which debuted at No. 2. \"Wishing I Was There\" was less successful, peaking at No. 19. \"Wishing I Was There\" only peaked at No. 2 on UK radio in summer 1998, and in the US peaked at No. 14 on the Top 40 Show. The final single from Left of the Middle was \"Smoke\", which had a more divided reception. It was a hit in the UK and made the top five, while in Australia it missed the top 40. Eventually, the album became a million-seller after charting well in many countries and entering the Top 10 in the US and UK. In 1999, she recorded a cover of \"Never Tear Us Apart\" by INXS with Tom Jones, which appeared on his album Reload. The \"Torn\" single and Left of the Middle album earned Imbruglia an MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, MTV Europe Music Award for Best Song, six trophies at 12th ARIA Music Award in 1998, including Best New Talent, Best Australian Debut Album, Best Female Artist, and Single of the Year, and two more trophies at 13th ARIA Music Award in 1999, including the Outstanding Achievement Award, as well as two Brit Awards for Best International Newcomer and Best International Female. Imbruglia's next album, White Lilies Island, in 2001, was named after where she lived beside the River Thames at Windsor. Imbruglia co-wrote every track over three years. The album's first single, \"That Day\", was stylistically different from her singles but did not reach the UK Top 10. In the US, \"Wrong Impression\" was the first single and charted in the Hot 100 Singles and adult contemporary charts. In the UK it did slightly better than That Day. \"Beauty on the Fire\", the final single, barely entered charts worldwide, and did not make the top 50 in Australia. The album, briefly notorious in the Sony BMG copy protection rootkit scandal, sold 1 million but did not repeat the success of Left of the Middle. Imbruglia's third album was ready by November 2003; however her record label refused to release it. She was given songs to record with Swedish pop producers, Bloodshy & Avant. She and the record label separated at the beginning of 2004. Four months later she signed with Brightside Recordings, formed by a former Innocent Records executive, Hugh Goldsmith. In 2003, she appeared in the spy parody film Johnny English, playing Rowan Atkinson's love interest, Lorna Campbell, in a Bond girl–style role. In April 2005, Imbruglia's third album Counting Down the Days had \"Shiver\" as its first single. \"Shiver\" became her longest-charting single in the UK since \"Torn.\" It topped UK airplay charts for several weeks, reaching eighth in the UK. It became the most-played song of 2005. Counting Down The Days became her first album to reach the top spot on the album charts. \"Sanctuary\" was the second single from the album and singles sent to radio stations. The decision was later changed to the title track \"Counting Down the Days\", with stations asked to play the album version, because the radio mix was not finished. The single on 25 July did not have as much success in the singles chart as \"Shiver,\" although it reignited interest in its album and received airplay in the UK. Due to the single, the album re-entered the top 40 in the UK charts. Imbruglia made a small European tour, her first since Left of the Middle, in late October and November. Though the album never entered UK Top 40 again, several concerts sold out, notably London. The album was the 100th-best-selling album in 2005, selling 204,877 copies in the UK alone. Imbruglia started on her fourth album in late 2005. In mid-2007, plans changed and her record company released a compilation of Imbruglia's 10 years in music. The only single from the album—\"Glorious\"—premiered in BBC Radio 1 on The Chris Moyles Show. The Singles Collection debuted at No. 5 in the UK, including the single \"Glorious\" as well as a DVD of Imbruglia's videos. The album sold 600,000 copies. In late-2008, in the second year of work on her eventual 2009 album Come to Life, Imbruglia parted with her label, Brightside/Sony BMG. She obtained the rights to songs recorded for the album and planned to record on her own label, Malabar Records. Songs were co-written with Ben Hillier, Dave McCracken, her then-husband Daniel Johns, Gary Clark, Jamie Hartman, Paul Harris, Shep Solomon and Chris Martin of Coldplay. Some tracks were produced by Hillier and mixed by Danton Supple. Accompanied by an extensive television advertising campaign and press campaign, Come to Life was released, through Island Records, on 2 October 2009 in Australia. It entered the Australian albums chart at No. 67 on 19 October 2009, making it Imbruglia's worst performing album to date, selling just 750 copies in its first week of release and spending only two weeks in the Top 100. It had been announced that the album would be released in the United Kingdom (UK) on 3 May 2010, preceded by the track \"Scars\" to be released as a single on 22 March 2010. Following the disappointing reaction on the Australian charts, the official UK launch of the album, and the single, was delayed, then cancelled. All plans to launch the album in the United States were also cancelled, with the album eventually made available online through Amazon Music. After the failure of Come to Life, Imbruglia took a six-year hiatus from music, shifting her focus back to acting. Imbruglia moved to Los Angeles and hired acting coach Ivana Chubbuck. She appeared in three movies over the next five years, Closed for Winter (2009), Underdogs (2013) and Among Ravens (2014). In April 2014, Imbruglia made her stage debut in a UK production of Things We Do For Love, at the Theatre Royal, Bath. On 3 December 2014, Imbruglia signed with Sony Masterworks and planned to make her first album in five years, covering famous songs by a range of male artists. The first single is a cover of \"Instant Crush\", originally by Daft Punk featuring Julian Casablancas. Male was released on 31 July 2015, her fifth studio album. During the spring of 2017, Imbruglia took her Acoustic Tour to Europe in support of the album. In 2018 she continued with a tour around the UK. In an Instagram post in November 2018, Imbruglia stated that new music was due in 2019. In February 2019 it was announced that Albert Hammond Jr. of the Strokes was in the studio with Imbruglia working on new music, along with Strokes producer Gus Oberg. Imbruglia signed to BMG in July 2019, her original record label from 1997 to 2007, with plans to release an album of new material sometime in 2020. This was subsequently pushed back to 2021. On 18 June 2021, Imbruglia released \"Build It Better\", the first single from her sixth studio album Firebird, which was released on 24 September 2021. The official video for \"Build It Better\" was directed by Amy Becker-Burnett, with choreography by Gregory Haney and Alex Sarmiento. \"Build It Better\" did not enter the Official UK Top 100 Chart, but peaked at No. 67 on the Official Singles Sales Chart Top 100 and at number 66 on the Official Singles Download Chart Top 100. In 2022, Imbruglia won the third series of the British version of The Masked Singer as \"Panda\". Imbruglia released her version of \"Story of My Life\" (a song she performed on the show) on 12 February 2022. It debuted on the UK Official Singles Sales Chart Top 100 at number 49. The Firebird album re-entered the UK Official Album Downloads chart at number 32. On 28 July 2022, Imbruglia made a cameo appearance as Beth in the final-ever Neighbours episode. Her appearance was filmed alongside Holly Valance's character, Felicity Scully. In February 2024, it was announced that Imbruglia would embark on a UK and Ireland tour with the Irish group the Corrs. In May 2010, Imbruglia became a judge on the second season of the Australian version of The X Factor. She mentored the Girls category, in which her final act Sally Chatfield was the runner up of the series. In 2011, she did not return for the third season and was replaced by Natalie Bassingthwaighte. In June 2011, Imbruglia appeared on the original British version of the show, where she was a guest judge for the Birmingham auditions on its seventh series. In 2016 Imbruglia was cast in the second season of SBS TV series First Contact. In 2024, she released an Audible Original podcast, Sleep Sound with Natalie Imbruglia. In the podcast she recites poetry by the late Australian poet, Dorothea Mackellar. Natalie Imbruglia is the elder sister of singer-songwriter Laura Imbruglia. During her time on Neighbours she briefly dated her co-star Stefan Dennis. Imbruglia dated American actor David Schwimmer in the late 1990s. In 1999, Imbruglia met Silverchair frontman Daniel Johns backstage at his band's concert in London. They started dating after meeting again at the ARIA awards after-party at the Gazebo Hotel in Sydney in October of the same year. After years of an on-and-off relationship, they announced their engagement shortly before Christmas 2002 and they married on New Year's Eve 2003 in a beach ceremony in Port Douglas, Queensland. Imbruglia stated in a 2002 interview that meeting Johns saved her from depression. Johns wrote the song \"Satisfied\" for Imbruglia's 2005 album Counting Down the Days, which he also produced and co-wrote the song \"Want\" from Imbruglia's 2009 album Come to Life. Imbruglia wrote her 2005 single \"Counting Down the Days\" about their long-distance relationship, as Imbruglia was based in London and Johns lived in Newcastle, Australia. They announced their divorce on 4 January 2008, stating, \"We have simply grown apart through not being able to spend enough time together.\" Imbruglia became a naturalised British citizen in 2013. On 9 October 2019, Imbruglia announced on Instagram that she had given birth to a baby boy. The child was conceived using IVF and sperm from an unnamed donor. Imbruglia is an ambassador for Virgin Unite and supports campaigns to end poverty and to bring attention to obstetric fistula. She appeared in a sketch at the Secret Policeman's Ball for Amnesty International on 31 October 2006. She has spoken of clinical depression to raise awareness about the disorder. 2008 saw her support the Fashion Targets Breast Cancer campaign in support of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, alongside comedian Alan Carr, DJ & presenter Edith Bowman, actress Anna Friel, and model Twiggy.

Iggy Azalea (b. 1990 )\n\nWith an HPI of 45.32 , Iggy Azalea is the 9th most famous Australian Singer . Her biography has been translated into 56 different languages.\n\nAmethyst Amelia Kelly (born 7 June 1990), known professionally as Iggy Azalea (), is an Australian rapper, songwriter, and model. Azalea's accolades include two American Music Awards, three Billboard Music Awards, an MTV Video Music Award, a People's Choice Award, four Teen Choice Awards and four Grammy Award nominations. Azalea is popular on video sites, her Youtube channel has accumulated 3.4 billion views, and 15 of her music videos have received over 100 million views on Vevo. Born in Sydney, Australia, Azalea moved to the United States at the age of 16 in order to pursue a career in music. Azalea earned public recognition after releasing the music videos for her songs \"Pussy\" and \"Two Times\" on YouTube. Shortly after releasing those two songs, she released her debut mixtape, Ignorant Art (2011), and subsequently signed a recording contract with American rapper T.I.'s Grand Hustle label. Azalea's debut studio album, The New Classic (2014), peaked among the top five on several charts worldwide and eventually topped the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, making Azalea the first non-American female rapper to reach the top of the chart. The New Classic was preceded by Azalea's debut single \"Work\" and chart-topping single \"Fancy\" (featuring Charli XCX), which hit the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Record of the Year. Azalea was featured on Ariana Grande's 2014 single \"Problem\", which peaked at number two behind \"Fancy\". With these hits, Azalea became the second musical act (aside from the Beatles) to rank at number one and number two simultaneously on the Hot 100 with their debut releases on the chart. In addition, she achieved three top ten hits simultaneously on the Hot 100 with the aforementioned songs and the album's fifth single, \"Black Widow\" (featuring Rita Ora), which debuted later that year. After her debut album, Azalea released a slew of singles to build anticipation for her intended second album, Digital Distortion. However, a series of conflicts with her label, as well as personal conflicts, resulted in the project being cancelled. Consequently, Azalea switched labels, releasing the EP Survive the Summer (2018) under Island Records. Further disagreements led to Azalea becoming an independent artist and creating her own label, Bad Dreams, through a distribution deal with Empire. Her second album, In My Defense, was released in 2019, followed by another EP, Wicked Lips, that same year, and a third studio album, The End of an Era, in 2021. In 2024, Azalea seemingly announced her retirement from music as posted on her social media and reported on by Billboard. Amethyst Amelia Kelly was born in Sydney and grew up in Mullumbimby, New South Wales. Her father, Brendan Kelly, was a painter and comic artist, while her mother, Tanya, cleaned holiday houses and hotels. Azalea lived in a house that her father built by hand from mud-bricks, surrounded by 5 hectares (12 acres) of land. She has two siblings named Mathias and Emerald Kelly. Azalea has also said that her father \"made her look at [art] as a teenager\", which has always influenced her life and work. She began rapping at age 14. Before embarking on a solo career, Azalea formed a group with two other girls from her neighborhood: \"I was like, I could be the rapper. This could be like TLC. I'll be Left Eye.\" Azalea eventually decided to disband the group because the other girls were not taking it seriously: \"I take everything I do serious [sic]. I'm too competitive.\" In pursuit of her desire to move to America, Azalea dropped out of high school. She worked and saved the money she earned by cleaning hotel rooms and holiday houses with her mother. She claims to have hated school, which, apart from art class, only made her miserable. She also said she had no friends and was teased for her homemade outfits. Azalea traveled to the United States in 2006, shortly before she turned 16. She told her parents she was going \"on a holiday\" with a friend, but eventually decided to stay and shortly afterward told them she was not coming back home: \"I was drawn to America because I felt like an outsider in my own country, I was in love with hip hop, and America is the birthplace of that, so I figured the closer I was to the music, the happier I'd be. I was right.\" She recalled, \"My mum was crying, saying, 'Just be safe.' I was thinking, 'I'm going by myself. I'm fucking crazy!'\" After she arrived in the US, she received her General Educational Development (GED), and resided in the country on a visa waiver for six years, returning to Australia every three months to renew it. Azalea worked in the US illegally until February 2013 when she was granted a five-year O visa. In 2018, Azalea was approved as a permanent U.S. resident. When she first arrived in the United States in 2006, she stayed in Miami, Florida, and afterward lived briefly in Houston, Texas. Azalea settled for a few years in Atlanta, Georgia, working with a member of the rap collective Dungeon Family named Backbone. During that period, she met future collaborators FKi and Natalie Sims. She said people would laugh at her because \"they thought my raps sucked\", but having grown up getting laughed at, she was able to shrug it off. Meanwhile, she had met someone from Interscope Records who encouraged her move to Los Angeles during the summer of 2010. Interscope would eventually go on to manage her for a brief period of time. It was during this time that she adopted her stage name, which she created from the name of her childhood dog, Iggy, and the street she grew up on, Azalea Street, where her family lives to this day. She also started making stop motion animated videos with freestyle rap because she felt like she had found her sound. On 27 September 2011, Azalea released her first full-length project, a mixtape titled Ignorant Art, saying she made it \"with the intent to make people question and redefine old ideals.\" Her song \"Pussy\" was included on the mixtape, alongside guest appearances from YG, Joe Moses, Chevy Jones, and Problem. In November 2011, she released a music video for her song \"My World\", directed by Alex/2tone. The video features a cameo appearance from character actor and former wrestler Tiny Lister, which earned her more attention due to its rising popularity online. \"It's supposed to have like, all the ridiculousness of a big-budget '90s video, but then chopped and screwed\", said Azalea, of the video. In December 2011, Azalea revealed she would release her debut studio album, The New Classic, as soon as she signed a major record label deal: \"Once that's sorted out and I establish an overall sound and direction for the album, I will be able to know what artists would make for a dynamic collaboration.\" On 11 January 2012, Azalea released the music video for \"The Last Song\", her third video from Ignorant Art. In an interview with Billboard, released on 27 January, Azalea hinted at an Interscope Records signing, while also revealing hopes of releasing The New Classic in June, and for her debut single to precede it in March. Azalea reached out to rapper T.I., for the direction of her debut album. T.I. was set to executive produce The New Classic, soon after a phone call the two had. At the time, Azalea was eyeing a summer release for The New Classic: \"Hopefully if all goes to plan, my album will be out in June and I'll have it recorded by the end of the month.\" However, after Interscope did not allow T.I. to be an ongoing part of her deal, Azalea opted not to sign with the major label and stay independently signed to Grand Hustle Records, until the release of her first album, which had then been postponed. In early 2012, Azalea was featured on the cover of XXL, as part of its annual \"Top 10 Freshman List\", along with fellow up-and-coming rappers French Montana, Machine Gun Kelly, Danny Brown, Hopsin, and Roscoe Dash. On 1 March 2012, T.I. announced he signed Azalea to Grand Hustle Records, along with rappers Chip and Trae tha Truth. On 26 March 2012, Azalea posted \"Murda Bizness\", the intended lead single for The New Classic, on her YouTube account. The song was produced by Bei Maejor and features a verse from her Grand Hustle label-boss T.I. In April 2012, via her Twitter feed, Azalea announced plans to release an extended play (EP) entitled Glory, later in May: \"I'm just onto something right now, the last two weeks and it's glory. Azaleans need something new.\" Also in April, Azalea starred alongside Grammy-nominated producer Diplo and FKi in the world's first fully interactive shoppable music video for Canadian fashion retailer, SSENSE. In May 2012, it was confirmed by T.I. on MTV's HipHopPov that Azalea had not yet secured distribution for her deal with Grand Hustle Records, and was described by T.I. as a \"free agent\". It was later revealed in the interview that she was in negotiation with labels other than Interscope, possibly Def Jam Recordings (wherein Bu Thiam, whom of which originally placed a bid to sign her is VP of A&R). Azalea was also featured on Steve Aoki and Angger Dimas' collaborative electronic track \"Beat Down\", which was released on 31 May 2012. On 24 June 2012, Azalea released \"Millionaire Misfits\", the second offering from her EP Glory; the first being \"Murda Bizness\".

Later that month, she embarked on yet another North American mini-concert tour with Roc Nation singer-songwriter Rita Ora, on her Ora Tour. Azalea then headlined a tour in Europe to support TrapGold. On 16 December 2012, Azalea performed live alongside Natasha Bedingfield and Bootsy Collins, covering Deee-Lite's 1990 hit disco song \"Groove Is in the Heart\", on the annual television series VH1 Divas. In January and February 2013, Azalea worked on tour while still working on her upcoming singles and summer release of The New Classic. She was the opening act for Rita Ora's Radioactive Tour, in the United Kingdom. As part of her set for Ora's Radioactive Tour, Azalea premiered her commercial debut single \"Work\", which also serves as the lead single for her debut album. The single premiered on BBC Radio 1Xtra on 11 February 2013. On 13 February 2013, it was announced Azalea had signed a record deal with Mercury Records. The music video for her debut single \"Work\", was directed by Jonas & François and released 13 March 2013. In March 2013, Azalea also joined renowned rapper Nas, on the European leg of his Life Is Good Tour. On 15 April 2013, Vevo announced Azalea as its second LIFT artist of 2013 and that she would film live festival performances, fashion and style pieces and behind-the-scenes interviews as part of the eight-week-long campaign.

Azalea also confirmed that she was not signed to Grand Hustle Records; however, heavily affiliated with the label. On 25 May 2013, Azalea performed an acclaimed carnival themed set on the In New Music We Trust stage as part of Radio 1's Big Weekend in Derry, Northern Ireland. The setlist contained songs from previous EPs and album material such as \"Bounce\" and \"Work\". The show was the start of a short set of UK pre-album promotional appearances. In June 2013, Azalea confirmed that the album was nearly finished and that the release was expected in September 2013. On 29 July 2013, Azalea revealed she will be opening for Beyoncé on the 17-date Australia leg of her Mrs. Carter Show World Tour in October and November. The third single from The New Classic, titled \"Change Your Life\", was premiered by BBC Radio 1Xtra's MistaJam, on 19 August 2013. On 3 October 2013, Azalea made her first appearance on BET's 106 & Park, where she was interviewed and performed \"Change Your Life\", alongside T.I. Azalea's debut album was slated for an October 2013 release, but in an interview with Australia's Herald Sun she revealed that due to other commitments such as supporting Beyoncé on her Mrs. Carter Show World Tour, her record label would not allow her to release The New Classic until March 2014. She said: \"The official date? Fucked if I know! It's done, it's so depressing to say this but it's the beginning of March, it's so far away but I just have to accept that.\" She explained the reasons behind the delay: \"It was supposed to be October but obviously I'm going on tour with Beyoncé and they said I'm not allowed to put an album out while I'm on tour because I'll be trapped in Australia and I won't be able to do any TV appearances and I thought that's fair enough, that's three weeks and then they said 'You can't put an album out around Christmas time, that's a bad time' and I said 'What about January?' 'Well nobody gets back off holidays and then it's the BRIT Awards, you can't release an album, it's terrible for marketing' which brings me to February.\" On 10 November 2013, Azalea performed \"Blurred Lines\" with Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards. On 5 December 2013, an unfinished song by Azalea titled \"Leave It\", allegedly produced by DJ Mustard, was leaked. Azalea later revealed the song was in fact produced by the Invisible Men and the Arcade, whom she collaborated with on the entire album. In February 2014, Azalea announced that she would be releasing a new single titled \"Fancy\", featuring English singer-songwriter Charli XCX. The song was premiered on BBC Radio 1 Xtra at 7 pm GMT on 6 February 2014. After the song's premiere, it was revealed \"Fancy\" was the song that had leaked titled \"Leave It\". On 17 February 2014, the song was serviced to urban contemporary radio in the United Kingdom as the album's fourth single. The music video for \"Fancy\", inspired by the 1995 American comedy film Clueless was released on 4 March. \"Fancy\" went on to become Azalea's most successful single to date, becoming her first single to chart on the US Billboard Hot 100. It also reached number-one on Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, as well as number-one the US Dance Club Play chart. After much delay and speculation, The New Classic was finally released on 21 April 2014. Upon its release, the album debuted at number-three on the Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 52,000 copies in the United States. The New Classic was the highest-charting female rap album since Nicki Minaj's Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded (2012). The New Classic also attained the highest number for a female rapper's debut album since Minaj's Pink Friday (2010), which had entered at number-two with 375,000 copies sold. Azalea was then featured on American singer Ariana Grande's single \"Problem\", which was released on 28 April 2014. The song was released as the lead single from Grande's second studio album. Shortly after, Azalea also appeared on Jennifer Lopez's single \"Booty\". On 28 May 2014, The New Classic's fourth single \"Fancy\", reached number-one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, with Azalea being the fourth solo female rapper ever to top the Hot 100. On the same day, \"Problem\" rose to number-two on the Hot 100, with Azalea becoming the only artist since the Beatles, to rank at numbers one and two simultaneously, with their first two respective Hot 100 entries. \"Fancy\" also topped the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip Hop Songs chart. On 24 June 2014, Azalea's song \"Black Widow\", featuring Rita Ora, was serviced to rhythmic contemporary radio, as her debut album's fifth single in the US. It eventually peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100. A reissue of The New Classic, titled Reclassified, was released in November 2014; featuring five new songs, including new singles \"Beg for It\" and \"Trouble\". On 10 December 2014, when reflecting on the year she'd had and the struggles she faced in the years before, Azalea announced plans of an arena tour for 2015 and a second studio album via her Twitter account. The same day, she revealed the title of the tour, The Great Escape Tour, and the concept behind it, which is Azalea picturing herself as \"a musical escape artist for people\". Azalea also stated that the name of the tour went along with the title of her upcoming second studio album, which would also be promoted on the tour. Azalea declared she had started to work on her second studio album in January 2015. On 4 May 2015, she released a duet with Britney Spears titled \"Pretty Girls\". On 29 May 2015, it was reported that The Great Escape Tour had been canceled and there would be a new tour planned around Azalea's new album to be released in 2016. Azalea later clarified she \"had a different creative change of heart\" and would also be taking a break to figure out the progression she wanted for her sound and visuals. In June, when asked details on her new music, she explained she had scrapped six months of work to start from scratch. On 30 August, Azalea performed \"Cool for the Summer\" with Demi Lovato at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, after a collaboration between the two was announced for Lovato's fifth studio album, Confident (2015). In October 2015, Azalea revealed the initial title of her second album to be Digital Distortion. A buzz track off the album, \"Azillion\", was made available for free streaming on SoundCloud on 9 January 2016. The project's lead single, \"Team\", was released on 18 March 2016 along with a dance video. An accompanying music video premiered on 31 March. In March 2016, Azalea revealed she had started a production company, having \"bought the rights to a couple of books that I really like, and also some television shows from Australia that I really believed in and was a fan of when I was a kid, and I had some ideas to rework [them].\" In July 2016, she announced that her company, Azalea Street Productions, had signed a deal to create original content for NBCUniversal. In February 2017, it was announced the company optioned the book Bad Girls Gone for a film that Azalea would produce but nothing materialized. On 12 June 2016, Seven Network revealed that Azalea had signed on to be a judge replacing Chris Isaak on The X Factor Australia for its eighth season, broadcast from October to November 2016. In September 2016, Azalea explained she was delaying the release of her album to 2017, despite it initially being set for July 2016, after ending the relationship with her fiancé Nick Young, stating: \"[I] just needed to have some me time to get my life in order and process the changes that are happening in my private life.\" She also mentioned wanting to record new songs that reflected her mindset: \"when I wrote [my album] I was about to get married ... I don't want to go and promote my album and get asked about my relationship that has just crumbled.\" Azalea released two singles, \"Mo Bounce\" and \"Switch\", on 24 March 2017 and 19 May 2017 respectively. The latter track features Brazilian singer Anitta. Azalea promoted \"Switch\" through a performance on the 2017 iHeartRadio Much Music Video Awards. On 7 November 2017, Azalea stated that she was not allowed to release music until January 2018, as she signed with a new label. She additionally announced the new title of her second album, Surviving the Summer, and released four new tracks for free download via WeTransfer. The media has dubbed the songs as a four-track mixtape or EP called 4 My Ratz. In January 2018, Azalea announced the title of the lead single from Surviving the Summer, \"Savior\" featuring Quavo, which was released on 2 February 2018. On 8 June 2018, the rapper revealed that Survive the Summer would be an EP. She also stated that the reason behind the postponed release date—originally for 2 June, then 30 June release—was the change of president of her record label, Island Records. On 5 July, Azalea released two tracks from the EP: \"Tokyo Snow Trip\" and \"Kream\", the latter featuring Tyga. Survive the Summer was released on 3 August 2018, and debuted at number 144 on the Billboard 200. On 3 November 2018, Azalea tweeted that she had left Island Records, which she had signed to in 2017, and established her own record label, which was then named New Classic Records. Two weeks later, she announced she had signed a $2.7 million dollar distribution deal with an unidentified company. She stated that she would be an independent artist, be able to sign other artists, and own all her masters, with the exception of her music licensed under Universal. On 20 November 2018, it was announced that she had signed a partnership deal with Empire Distribution. She would later rename her record label Bad Dreams in January 2019. Azalea announced in early February 2019 that she had completed work on her second studio album, In My Defense. She further stated her plans to release it in the spring of that year. On 27 February, Azalea announced that \"Sally Walker\" would be the first single off of the album. On the same day, her previous single, \"Kream\", was certified gold for selling 500,000 copies in the US. At the end of March 2019, 14 days after Azalea's new single was released, \"Sally Walker\" had accumulated over 38 million views on YouTube had a combined total sales of over 82,000 copies sold on all platforms and had debuted on Billboard's Hot 100 Chart at number 62, making it the highest-charting single from Azalea on the Billboard charts since \"Team\" released in 2016, which had charted at number 42. Azalea promoted the song with a performance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! during his Las Vegas shows. On 3 May 2019, Azalea released the album's official second single, \"Started\", along with its official music video. Shortly afterward, a collaboration with VVAVES titled \"Boys Like You\" was released. On 24 June 2019, Azalea announced via Twitter that her album In My Defense would be released on 19 July 2019. Pre-orders for the album began on 28 June 2019. Azalea appeared on the cover of Cosmopolitan in August. On 27 September 2019, Azalea announced she would be releasing a new extended play. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Azalea stated she was not sure if she would tour to promote the record but that she plans to begin recording new material in September, with hopes of putting it out next year. She later announced on her Twitter that she planned on releasing a new extended play on 15 November 2019 entitled Wicked Lips following the release of its lead single, \"Lola\". Following a few minor delays, the EP was released on 2 December. The EP was written primarily by Azalea with Noah Cyrus co-writing \"The Girls\", which featured Pabllo Vittar. In the summer of 2020, Azalea announced her third studio album, The End of an Era. On 20 August 2020, Azalea released the original lead single, \"Dance Like Nobody's Watching\", a collaboration with Tinashe. Following its underperformance, Azalea scrapped the song from The End of an Era and released the album's new lead single \"Sip It\" with Tyga in April 2021. In June 2021, Azalea tweeted that The End of an Era would be released in August of the same year. Later in June, Pitbull announced his I Feel Good Tour with Azalea as an opening act. On 15 July 2021, Azalea announced that she would take a hiatus from music after the release of The End of an Era. One year later, on 8 August 2022, Azalea announced that she would resume her musical activity, but seemingly announced her retirement from music again in 2024. Although Azalea is Australian, she raps with an American accent. When she first moved to America, she was involved in the Southern hip hop scene of Miami and later Atlanta, which made it easy for her to cultivate the Southern influence in her music: \"I lived in the South for five years; you pick up things from your surroundings and teachers. The people who taught me to rap are all from the South and so was the music I had listened to as a teen.\" While Azalea's debut extended play, Glory, was intended to focus on hardcore rap, the EP also touched up on other genres including electronic dance music. Music critics have defined her singles \"Fancy\" and \"Team\" as electro-hop. At the age of 11, Azalea was infatuated with hip hop when she heard Tupac Shakur's \"Baby Don't Cry (Keep Ya Head Up II)\": \"It was the song that made me fall in love with music and also what sparked my Tupac fascination. That would later make me pick up my own pen and write songs.\" In her early interviews, Azalea regularly mentioned Shakur's influence: \"I was sickly obsessed. I had every picture of Tupac ever printed on my wall.\" She has credited Beyoncé as an influence and Missy Elliott as the female rapper who she is influenced by and admires the most. Outside of music, her fashion sense is influenced by Grace Kelly, Lil' Kim, Gwen Stefani, Fran Drescher, Eve, Trina, Fergie, Christina Aguilera, and the Spice Girls, with Azalea stating that Mel B and Victoria Beckham are her favorite Spice Girls. Azalea is often noted for her cinema-quality music videos which are often comedic and contain satire. Azalea has paid homage to a number of cult films from the 1990s and early 2000s in her music videos, among the most notable examples being Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1997) in \"Work\" (2013), Showgirls (1995) in \"Change Your Life\" (2013), Clueless (1995) in \"Fancy\" (2014), Kill Bill (2003) in \"Black Widow\" (2014), Earth Girls Are Easy (1988) in \"Pretty Girls\" (2015), and Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997) in \"Fuck It Up\" (2019), among others. Alongside those film references, eras of cinema are referenced in several other videos including the Bollywood-themed video for \"Bounce\" (2013) and the 1980s cop comedy-inspired video for \"Trouble\" (2015). Additionally, the video for \"Murda Bizness\" (2012) is reminiscent of the pageant culture shown in reality series Toddlers & Tiaras. Azalea has also been credited as a director for some of her music videos and often mentions the importance she attributes to them: \"For me, visuals are as important as the music, I just love escapism and giving people something to escape to. To me, that's what art is.\" After initially resisting suggestions to try modeling, Azalea signed with talent agency Wilhelmina Models in 2012. She featured in promotional ads for Los Angeles-based lifestyle brand Dim Mak's 2012 fall/winter collection. Also in 2012, Azalea was the face of Levi's \"Go Forth\" campaign. Azalea also appeared in House of Holland's first eyewear collection campaign. In July 2014, MTV announced that Azalea would be the host of the revived House of Style. Azalea appeared in the seventh installment of The Fast and the Furious film series, Furious 7, released in 2015. Their shoe collection was unveiled in February 2015. In October 2014, Azalea and her boyfriend Nick Young were announced as the new faces of Forever 21's 2014 holiday campaign. In April 2015, she signed on to be the 100th-birthday ambassador of Australian underwear and clothing company Bonds. In 2018, Azalea was announced as Monster Products's new spokesperson and starred in their Super Bowl LII commercial. Azalea claims partial Aboriginal ancestry, stating, \"My family came to Australia on the First Fleet. My family's been in that country for a long time, over 100 years. If your family's lived in Australia for a long time, everyone has a little bit of [Aboriginal blood]. I know my family does because we have an eye condition that only Aborigine [sic] people have.\" In 2012, Azalea caused controversy for her song \"D.R.U.G.S\", a remix of Kendrick Lamar's \"Look Out for Detox\", having adapted one of its lyrics to \"When the relay starts, I'm a runaway slave / Master\", leading her to release a letter online apologizing, stating that it was a \"tacky and careless thing to say.\" According to the British newspaper The Guardian, there have been \"accusations of racism against Azalea focused on her... insensitivity to the complexities of race relations and cultural appropriation.\" Salon writer Brittney Cooper critiqued Azalea's \"co-optation and appropriation of sonic Southern Blackness, particularly the sonic Blackness of Southern Black women.\" Her use of an African-American English accent has been compared to blackface and part of a \"broad, vague area of white people pretending to be black: those who do it culturally, rather than cosmetically\" but also conversely as \"wilful ignorance\". Both supporters and critics of Azalea's rise to fame in the hip hop industry noted that it was important to be inclusive while acknowledging and respecting the role of African-Americans in pioneering hip hop. After being asked to analyze and compare her speaking and rapping voice, linguistics professor David Crystal said Azalea might be doing it unconsciously to accommodate to the American rapping style, adding: \"There are hardly any echoes of [Azalea's] original Australian accent in her speaking voice—just the odd word (e.g. \"own\", \"believe\") and inflection. She has developed a mixed accent (like so many people have these days) as a result of her traveling around.\" When asked about the validity to the criticisms leveled against her, Azalea stated: \"Do you not like me because I rap with an American accent and I'm not American? Well, that's valid on some level because that's your opinion and I can't change that\", continuing, \"But I'm not trying to sound black—I just grew up in a country where on TV and in music and film, everyone was American or any Australian person in them put on an American accent. So I never saw it as strange at all.\" In 2021, after Azalea released the music video for her song \"Iam the Stripclub\", some Twitter commentators accused her of blackfishing or \"imitating a black female aesthetic\"; Azalea called the allegations \"ridiculous and baseless\" and said that she had worn the same Armani foundation for the past three years \"in every video since 'Sally Walker'\". Her makeup artist Eros J. Gomez took to Twitter to defend and clarify that Azalea was using the same foundation in all the music video scenes. In 2018, Azalea claimed that the history of racism in the United States causes its audiences to dismiss her, and claimed that she, \"grew up in a situation that didn't involve any privilege and I worked really hard\", later reiterating on U.S. race relations: \"I make 'black' music. I don't want people to think it's not something I care about. I want to make music for girls in the gym.\" She stated, \"It's important for music to reflect what is going on socially and for there to be those kinds of voices within the industry. But I want to be that person you can listen to for four minutes and not think about that stuff at all, and it's important to have that too [...] I'm not here to offer that commentary, but that doesn't mean I don't care.\" In 2016, she lamented, \"Many people think I still live in that bubble and that I don't understand that the United States is set up in a way that doesn't benefit minorities. I've lived here for 10 years now, and I don't want it to be that way either. I'm marrying a black man and my children will be half black—of course I care about these things.\" She further dismissed the legitimacy of the racial controversy, citing sexism as the true cause of criticism. In a feature covering Azalea's career, Clover Hope wrote, \"Rather than seeing race as an issue, Iggy focused on the trend of women in rap being over-policed and accused of not writing their own rhymes, while in the process overlooking how artists like herself and Macklemore hold a broader industry advantage, even as they feel like outcasts in their field.\" In 2016, Azalea was planning to release her second album titled, Digital Distortion, explaining its concept: addressing the criticisms against her: \"some of them were fair and some of them, I think, were unfair. I just think it's interesting that we live in this age of digital distortion where we're all distorting each other and distorting ourselves and our perception of who we all are, and none of it is really accurate anymore.\" She later credited the support she received from fellow rappers as giving her motivation facing the controversial claims in the media: \"I grew up loving Missy Elliot, loving Lil' Kim or Trina and so I'm lucky I have those women I really idolized support me. So, I get a little bit confident in that, knowing the people I look up to appreciate what I'm doing.\" In March 2015, while talking about her body shape with Vogue, Azalea revealed she had undergone breast augmentation, saying, \"I did change something: Four months ago, I got bigger boobs! I'd thought about it my entire life\", adding she was sick of having to sew padding into her stage costumes and wanted to be able to wear lingerie without wiring. After initially resolving never to discuss it publicly as she didn't want other girls to feel bad about their bodies, she concluded, \"But then, I decided I wasn't into secret-keeping.\" In August 2015, she talked about having a Rhinoplasty, or nose job with Seventeen magazine, adding, \"Your perception of yourself can change a lot over time, so I think it's important to wait and make sure it's the right choice. Plastic surgery is an emotional journey. ... There are things that I didn't like about myself that I changed through surgery. There are other things I dislike but I've learned to accept. It's important to remember you can't change everything. You can never be perfect.\" In March 2018, Azalea was approved for permanent residence in the United States. In August 2023, Azalea submitted a letter to court on behalf of Tory Lanez ahead of his sentencing for shooting rapper Megan Thee Stallion. She stated in the document \"I deeply appreciate the person he is and have never witnessed him [lose] his temper or raise his voice at a woman... He's always been incredibly respectful of me and I refuse to believe that he would do anything in malice especially to a woman.\" In late 2011, Azalea began dating American rapper ASAP Rocky, whom she met through American record producer Chase N. Cashe. She confirmed that they were dating in a January 2012 interview with Vibe and, around this time, got the title of Rocky's breakout mixtape Live. Love. ASAP tattooed on her fingers. She claimed she and Rocky both had tattoos dedicated to the relationship, but his tattoos were not visible. In July 2012, Rocky stated they were no longer dating, with Azalea later removing her tattoo after years with the word A$AP crossed out. In November 2013, Azalea began a relationship with Los Angeles Lakers basketball player Nick Young. Azalea and Young were featured in the March 2014 issue of GQ magazine. They lived together in Tarzana, California. On June 1, 2015, they announced their engagement. On June 19, 2016, Azalea announced that she and Young had split after a video leaked on the internet showing Young bragging about cheating on Azalea. In late 2018, Azalea began dating American rapper Playboi Carti. The couple reportedly split in December 2019. In June 2020, Azalea announced she had given birth to a son with Carti. That October, she released a statement saying, \"I'm raising my son alone & I'm not in a relationship.\" Later in December, Azalea revealed that Carti had cheated on her and missed their son's birth. He later refused to sign their son's birth certificate. Iggy Azalea has been nominated for numerous major music awards. Azalea was the first female and first non-American rapper to be featured on XXL's \"Top 10 Freshman List\". In 2014, she received two American Music Awards in the Rap/Hip-Hop categories, along with four more nominations, and one MTV Video Music Award for her collaboration with Ariana Grande, along with seven more nominations, making her the most nominated artist at these respective award show editions. She has also won three Teen Choice Awards and one MTV Europe Music Award. Azalea won the 2014 ARIA Award for Breakthrough Artist and the 2015 People's Choice Award for Favorite Hip-Hop Artist. In November 2014, she was placed at number-one on the Maxim Hot 100 list in Australia because \"few Aussies, female or otherwise, have had a bigger 2014 than Iggy.\" Azalea also ranked at number 46 on the 2014 edition of the AMID (Australasian Music Industry Directory) Power 50, a list that compiles the most influential figures in the Australasian music world.
