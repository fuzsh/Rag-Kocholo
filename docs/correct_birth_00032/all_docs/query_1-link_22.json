        "text": "Tension follows 2020's DISCO, a glittering pandemic album dedicated to the dancefloor and the genre it’s named after. DISCO: Guest List Edition continued the funky shimmer with remixes with fellow disco-loving pop artists (who she's inspired) Jessie Ware and Dua Lipa, along with disco legend Gloria Gaynor and nu disco champ Purple Disco Machine.\n\nBack in 1988, a 20-year-old Kylie released her eponymous debut album, featuring her debut global hit single \"Locomotion.\" Since making that first big splash, she's remained dedicated to the art of dance pop, dropping an album every couple of years. Her eighth studio album, 2001's Fever, made synthy waves around the globe, and its lead single \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" remains her most memorable song. Fever's equally catchy \"Love At First Sight\" and \"Come Into My World\" were nominated for Best Dance Recording at the 45th and 46th GRAMMY Awards, respectively.\n\nFor those who somehow forgot about Kylie, or only know her as the \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" singer, or were born after 2001, it’s the perfect time to allow her nearly endless catalog of dance pop jams to padam into your heart. The sessions that led to Tension began as Kylie's personal sonic escape, and now she's offering those 11 playful tunes for us to move our bodies to and maybe even make our own.\n\nAhead of the Tension's release, GRAMMY.com caught up with the Australian pop queen about its music and how it came together. Sometimes, when you get a short interview slot with a pop star, they repeat canned answers or avoid offering up too many details. Not Kylie. She gave thorough and thoughtful answers, demonstrating her care and love for the music she makes, her fans, and pop music itself.\n\nTension is filled with upbeat songs about joy and pleasure. What was your vision for this project and how did the songs make you feel?\n\nInitially, there wasn't a vision. [Chuckles.] I just really wanted to feel. This was early 2021, so, COVID's still present and there were these windows where I can go to my happy place and be in the studio with one of my favorite collaborators. And if nothing came of it professionally, we love each other and we love to make music together. There was a gentle meander into that space. Maybe a couple months after that, I agreed with my label that, \"Okay, this is happening, we're gonna make an album.\"\n\nMy previous album [2020's DISCO] was made largely in lockdown. It's like wanting to run out into the field and just going, Yes, I want to start fresh. No more lockdown videos, none of that stuff. I really wanted new material, vibrancy. And we ended up getting it.\n\nThere was a point where we were talking about the album thematically having a kind of '80s entrance point, but it just wasn't hitting the mark so we abandoned all that. I think the turning point for the album was the decision that there's no theme — go in, have fun. My A&R said to me, almost as an aside, \"Just go in, write songs. Do a Kylie song.\" We know kind of what that is, but actually doing it's another matter.\n\nAnd he said, \"As long as it's not boring.\" That's actually not the worst advice. Yes, you want it to be amazing and moving, or escapism or whatever, but I think we can safely say that we did our best to make sure it's not boring.\n\nIt's quite eclectic. I think you can feel that [sense of] feeling liberated with not having a theme and not being afraid to self-reference, either — '80s, '90s, '00s. And I ended up in a good space personally at the end of this album. In a year and a half, a lot happens, so there's moments in the album that attest to that. A strong DNA of my music is, even if it's a challenging subject or emotion, it remains hopeful.\n\nI love that. I was reading that the album was recorded over five days or so in an Airbnb.\n\nNot all of it, but a really important chunk of it. [Biff Stannard has] a perfectly amazing basement studio in which many hits for various artists have been written. It's a pleasure to be there, but we really wanted to have our own writing camp. Because of his phobia of flying, we agreed, \"Okay, we can do South of France. You can take the ferry.\" I can't tell you how many places I looked at online that didn't work. It just got too complicated, so we ended up going about 40 minutes from where he lives.\n\nWe achieved what we hoped we would achieve. It was so glorious. Me, Bick, Biff, Duck [Blackwell], Jon Green, and another engineer. We woke up and talked about music. We had breakfast and talked about music. It was just all day, amazing love and creativity. We all had this sensation that it was a special time. \"Tension\" and \"Things We Do For Love\" were written on the same day, so we were jumping from different genres, different feelings.\n\nIt would be a shame to not talk about \"Padam Padam.\" The gay community went super hard for \"Padam\" and made it a pride anthem. What does having the support of the queer community and being celebrated as a gay icon mean to you?\n\nIt's hugely important to me and so touching. It's a difficult one to unpack — I'm always asked, \"How did you become a gay icon?\" I don't have the answer. I don't want the answer. It's very genuine — long-standing mutual respect, support and love.\n\nIt came to me many, many years ago. I can only imagine that the community saw something in me that made sense to them. I mean, I've had my own kind of struggles when I was starting out of being accepted in my field, which is very different to one's sexuality. But yeah, they pretty much adopted me.\n\nI hope that for that community and beyond, I just want to say I am open-minded and I want people to be happy in themselves. That community needed support and still needs support. I'm here. And they padamed for me.\n\nI had another question about \"Padam\" —\n\nMy favorite meme.\n\nWhich one?\n\nI don't know. There's so many.\n\nWhen you first heard the demo for \"Padam Padam\" what did you think? What was your reaction?\n\nLove. Absolutely loved. I know where I was, where I was sitting, what I was doing. I was getting glammed up for something in Miami. When they're outside songs — separate to songs that I'm involved with writing — it's always an exciting moment. My A&R sends me something and says, \"Hey, what do you think of this?\" I have no idea what to expect. In that moment, there's before and after, if it's a good moment.\n\nSo already the title was intriguing; I already knew theÉdith Piaf song \"Padam Padam.\" Straightaway, I was in. At first, I couldn't understand every lyric, so I listened again and was like that is really, really clever. I called Jamie straightaway, \"Yes, yes. I love it. I think it's great on its own, but what's more, I think it’s perfect for me. When can I get my vocals on it?\" And the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nThe thing with \"Padam\" is that it fed itself, it just kind of powered itself. The closest it would remind me of is \"Can't Get You Out Of My Head,\" where it just took off like a rocket. I'm almost like a bystander. \"Oh, Padam? Where have you gone?\" It's utterly enthralling to watch that unfold in front of my very eyes from day one to day two, and still happening now.\n\nDid you have any idea that it would be received in the way that it was?\n\nWho could predict that? Who would even dare to dream of that? I finally get TikTok. Yes, I've been slow but I finally am there. Honestly, it took all of us by surprise. And I think it's telling that now I think opening myself up to that community and having that relationship will be fruitful in the future and I hope to continue having fun with that. But I think in that initial moment, they decided — you know, the grand they. It was really organic. I don't think you can force that. It happened and I loved every second of it.\n\nKorean Pop & Film Star D.O. Exceeds 'Expectation' On New EP\n\nGRAMMY Camp is almost a wrap — but the musical memories will last a lifetime. On Saturday, July 19, the weeklong summit for students interested in music careers will wrap after six enlightening days.\n\nHeld at the Village Recording Studios in Los Angeles, GRAMMY Camp's faculty of music professionals — along with guest professionals — have offered precious insight to give campers the best chance at succeeding in their career of choice.\n\nThe available Camp tracks include Audio Engineering, Electronic Music Production, Songwriting, Music & Media, Music Business, and much more. Many alumni of this enriching crash course have risen to prestigious positions across the musical landscape.\n\nAs the Recording Academy signs off on yet another elevating GRAMMY Camp, check out this list of five major artists who cut their teeth at the almost 20-year institution.\n\nMaren Morris\n\nThe future country wunderkind attended GRAMMY Camp for its very first iteration, back in 2005. There, the then 15-year-old met undisputed leaders in the music community, like Jimmy Jam and Paul Williams — which set the course for her incredible career to come.\n\nIn the years since, Morris has won a GRAMMY, received 17 GRAMMY nominations, and topped the Billboard country charts. She also joined the country supergroup the Highwomen with fellow juggernauts Brandi Carlile, Natalie Hemby and Amanda Shires.\n\nAt this year's GRAMMY Camp, Morris returned as a guest artist. What's her advice to budding artists? \"Just stick to being authentic,\" she told RecordingAcademy.com, \"and people see that, no matter what time they arrive to the party for you.\"\n\nAlong the way, \"Find people that listen to you,\" Morris added, \"but also push you and your creativity to new areas of yourself.\"\n\nRead more: Maren Morris On 20 Years Of GRAMMY Camp & Her Advice To The Next Generation Of Music Industry Professionals\n\nJahaan Sweet\n\nIn 2009 — four years after Morris' GRAMMY camp tutelage — the formidable Jacksonville, Florida, producer, songwriter and pianist Jahaan Sweet attended GRAMMY Camp.\n\nAt the outset, he was thrilled to come to L.A. for the first time and network with like-minded folks in music. \"I knew that my skill set wasn't that great,\" he told GRAMMY.com a decade later, \"but it was just so good to be around people who were all there to learn and create together.\n\n\"I feel like that's the biggest takeback I have of GRAMMY Camp,\" he continued. \"It was amazing to have all those people together under one roof, all in the same vicinity, all doing creative things.\" Working with GRAMMY Camp Faculty Director Jason Goldman was one clear highlight for him: \"He's a great guy, and he was such a good, carefree band director.\"\n\nBy now, Sweet has worked with Kehlani, Kendrick Lamar, Drake, Eminem, the Carters, Ty Dolla $ign, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, and many more; he's been nominated for three GRAMMYs and won one. And as a launchpad, GRAMMY Camp helped make all these accomplishments possible.\n\nWatch now: Producer Jahaan Sweet Talks Making Records With Boi-1da, Drake & More | Behind The Board\n\nChappell Roan\n\nIn 2024, Chappell Roan is very, very famous — as she admits, a little more famous than she would like right now.\n\nRegardless, the self-christened \"Midwest Princess\" — whose moniker was ensconced in the title of her 2024 breakout album — has wholly earned her plaudits, including opening for Olivia Rodrigo on her GUTS tour. And she can trace a line directly back to a decade ago, in 2014, when she attended GRAMMY Camp.\n\n\"I didn't do my senior year. I didn't go to prom. I didn't go to graduation,\" Roan explained to Rolling Stone in 2022, about her early musical life. \"I missed a lot of what would have been the end of my childhood to do this job,\" she says.\n\nFor those like Roan, who are dead serious about making the music thing work, GRAMMY Camp is an ideal fount of experience and inspiration.\n\nRead more: Chappell Roan's Big Year: The Midwest Princess Examines How She Became A Pop \"Feminomenon\"\n\nJensen McCrae\n\nAnother shout out to GRAMMY Camp's Class of 2014: that's the year that indie-folk-pop favorite Jensen McCrae put in her time, at the tender age of 16.\n\n\"I started playing and writing music as a little kid, and I've known I've wanted to be creative for my whole life,\" McCrae told VoyageLA, adding that she began taking songwriting and performing seriously in high school.\n\n\"[Being a] half-white, half-Black girl who spent her whole life in academically cutthroat private schools while trying to pursue a career in the arts gives me a unique perspective on the world,\" she explained. Which made McCrae an live antenna at GRAMMY Camp, picking up signals left and right.\n\nThe 10-day experience cemented the Angeleno's desire to attend college at the University of Southern California's Thornton School of Music — where she got a full ride, and was off to the races. These days, she's fresh off an opening slot for Noah Kahan on the We're All Be Here Forever Tour.\n\nBlu DeTiger\n\n\"I remember thinking 'So many girls play guitar and sing,'\" the TikTok-flourishing bass phenom Blu DeTiger told Spin in 2022. \"I was like, 'I want to be different. I want to do something unique.' And I've never looked back.\"\n\nPart of GRAMMY Camp's message is: dare to be different, to be you. Which made DeTiger an ideal student, when she enrolled in 2015; today, she's leading the charge for a generation of young, innovative bassists of all backgrounds.\n\nRead more: Love Thundercat? Check Out These 5 Contemporary Bassists Keeping The Flame\n\nAlong with Morris and New Jerseyan singer/songwriter Jeremy Zucker, DeTiger returned in 2024 as a guest artist — bringing the musical education process full circle, as she continues to redefine how the bass is presented in the social media era of music.\n\nThe 20th annual GRAMMY Camp celebration is running now and concludes with the GRAMMY Camp Finale Student Showcase on Saturday, July 20, at the Ray Charles Terrace at the GRAMMY Museum.\n\nLearn more about GRAMMY Camp here — and we'll see you next year in Los Angeles!"
