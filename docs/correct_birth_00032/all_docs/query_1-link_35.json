        "text": "Kylie Minogue has marked her 50th birthday with a sexy snap of herself posing nude with a diamond encrusted guitar.\n\nThe Australian pop star, who first found fame playing Charlene in Neighbours in 1986, has been sharing pictures for several days reflecting her life and career.\n\nShe posted images of herself as a child, as well as some of her album covers and a picture of her on the front of Rolling Stone.\n\nShe also included a picture of herself with short hair, following a breast cancer diagnosis in 2005.\n\nOn Saturday, she wrote: \"This decade also bought the challenge of breast cancer.\n\n\"With the help of family, friends, medical teams and of course all of you, we made it through.\"\n\nMinogue underwent surgery and chemotherapy to beat the disease and was given the all-clear in 2006.\n\nOn Sunday, she wrote: \"And so a new decade begins. How thankful I am for the opportunities life has afforded me. 50..... Let's go!\"\n\nKylie Ann Minogue was born on 28 May 1968, in Melbourne, Australia, to her Welsh mother, Carol Ann.\n\nShe released her debut single, a cover of Little Eva's The Loco-Motion, in Australia in 1987 and has gone on to sell more than 68 million records around the world.\n\nHer debut album, Kylie, also topped the UK charts, as did Enjoy Yourself (1989), Fever (2001) and Aphrodite (2010), and a 1992 Greatest Hits compilation album.\n\nEarlier this year, Minogue said she would be having a \"big celebration\" to mark her 50th."
