        "text": "After 30 years spent living and working in the United Kingdom, the \"queen of pop\" Kylie Minogue has confirmed she is moving back home to Australia.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, the 53-year-old said she'd recently made the call to move back to Melbourne.\n\n\"I have spent a lot of time with my family this year in Australia and it felt really good,\" she told the BBC.\n\nLast October, Minogue opened up to the ABC's 7:30 program about missing her family and recording an album during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nShe told 7.30's Leigh Sales the global coronavirus crisis had been an \"emotional rollercoaster\".\n\n\"Time is so weird right now — was something yesterday or was it six months ago? — but it shouldn't be too long before I can get home. Anyway, hopefully.\"\n\nMinogue recorded her latest album, Disco — which was released in November 2020 — in a studio set up at her home, working with collaborators over Zoom.\n\nLoading...\n\nIn her BBC interview, Minogue said she was surprised by the public reaction to the announcement, but told friends and fans in the UK that she would come back to visit.\n\n\"I said: 'I'm not really going. I've lived here for 30 years, I'm always going to be back.\"\n\nKylie tops the charts again\n\nRecord-making career\n\nDisco made Minogue the first female solo artist to have number one albums in the UK in five different decades and only the second solo artist to do so in consecutive decades, after Bruce Springsteen.\n\nDisco was also Minogue's eighth UK number one album, taking her one ahead of Cliff Richard, Elton John and George Michael.\n\nShe has sold more than 70 million records worldwide and is the most successful Australian female recording artist of all time.\n\nMinogue has won a Grammy Award, three Brit Awards, 17 ARIA Music Awards and numerous others, and been appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 2008, and an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2019.\n\nHer first chart-topping album was Kylie in 1988, followed by Enjoy Yourself (1989), Greatest Hits (1992), Fever (2001), Aphrodite (2010), Golden (2018) and Step Back In Time: The Definitive Collection (2019).\n\nMinogue and her younger sister, Danii, took singing and dancing lessons as a child but she began her career as an actor at the age of 10, when she was cast in the long-running TV soap opera The Sullivans, in 1979.\n\nOther acting roles followed before she sent a demo tape to weekly music program Young Talent Time, which featured Danii as a regular performer.\n\nMinogue was not invited to joint the cast but did give her first televised singing performance — a duet with her sister — on the show in 1985.\n\nIn 1986, Minogue was cast in the soap opera Neighbours, as Charlene Mitchell, becoming a fan favourite character and attracting an audience of 20 million viewers in the UK when her character married Jason Donovan's Scott Robinson in 1987.\n\nMinogue became the first person to win four Logie Awards in a single year and was the youngest recipient of a Gold Logie for most popular television performer.\n\nAlso in 1987, Minogue was signed to Mushroom Records by legendary producer Michael Gudinski, who was sent a demo recording of her singing the 1962 pop song The Loco-Motion.\n\nRetitled Locomotion, the song became the best-selling single of the decade in Australia and led to her recording her debut album, Kylie, between London and Melbourne.\n\nKylie spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one, became the best-selling album of the 1980s by a female artist and went gold in the United States.\n\nLater that year, Minogue left Neighbours to focus on her music career but has continued to act, with her last credit being 2018's Swinging Safari alongside Guy Pearce.\n\nOver her career to date she has released 15 studio albums, eight live albums, 13 compilation albums, 10 EPs and 11 remix albums in addition to two box sets."
