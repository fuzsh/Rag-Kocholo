        "text": "Kylie Minogue, born May 28, 1968 in Melbourne, Australia, started out as a teenage soap opera actress, appearing in the series \"Neighbours\" (Seven/Ten/Eleven, 1985- ). In 1987, while still a teen, she began her singing career with a cover of the 1960s Little Eva hit \"The Loco-Motion,\" which went to No. 1 in Australia. When it was reissued worldwide the following year, it became an international smash. Though Minogue wouldn't have another real hit in the U.S. until 2001, she remained a major pop star in the U.K. throughout the late '80s and the '90s, ultimately achieving an almost Madonna-like status with her hook-heavy dance-pop tunes, sex-symbol image, and elaborate stage shows. Though Minogue was as mainstream a pop star as one could be, she had an appeal that transcended stylistic boundaries, and she collaborated with everyone from Nick Cave (1995's \"Where the Wild Roses Grow\") to The Pet Shop Boys (1999's \"In Denial\"). Though her popularity began to fade a bit by the end of the '90s, Minogue burst back to the top of the charts in the U.K. in 2000 with \"Spinning Around.\" The following year, the electro-tinged \"Can't Get You Out of My Head,\" which bore an earworm hook to match its title, did the same for Minogue in the rest of the world, solidifying her status as a top-tier pop diva all around the globe. In 2005, Minogue received a diagnosis of breast cancer, but after surgery and chemotherapy, she recovered and made a triumphant return to performing and recording. Minogue's willingness to talk to the press about her diagnosis and treatment was credited with inspiring a greater number of young women than ever to get checked regularly for breast cancer. In 2013 Minogue extended the reach of her stardom still further by becoming a coach on the U.K. version of \"The Voice\" (BBC/ITV 2012- )."
