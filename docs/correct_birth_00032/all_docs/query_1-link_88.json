        "text": "We hear it and we know: After months of speculation, prayers, and extremely heavy hints, Kylie Minogue will indeed perform a residency at the Venetian Resort in Las Vegas. The Australian pop star confirmed the news herself at a top-secret event held at the Pendry Hotel in West Hollywood on Thursday, July 27, where HELLO! spoke with the legend herself.\n\nKylie's first-ever U.S. residency kicks off November 3, and will also serve as opening night for the Venetian's brand-new entertainment venue, Voltaire. The intimate, 1,000-seat space aims to host not just superstars like Kylie but DJs as well as cabaret and burlesque acts too. \"I always thought [a residency] would happen at some point. So, now is the right time to be in the Voltaire environment,\" Kylie told HELLO! at Thursday's announcement. \"I think if I had done this earlier in my career it might have been too early. If I'd done it too much later I'd regret it being too much later. Right now, in my life, in my career, it feels like the perfect point, the perfect moment where, I've got the catalogue, I've got the history, but I've also got the drive and the ambition to go so much further.\"\n\nKylie also shared the news via Instagram, writing \"VEGAS BABY! So excited to headline the all-new @VoltaireLV at @VenetianVegas starting this fall. See you there! #MoreThanJustAResidency.\" The dazzling video also notes that the residency is just three months, running from November to January.\n\nAt Thursday's live announcement in West Hollywood, Kylie told the small group gathered: \"Today is the day where it's all become beautifully real..I've been on a journey [with this project] for three years. To finally be able to say 'Yes, I am doing a show in Vegas'..it's such a good match, and I couldn't be more excited!\" Later, she told HELLO! \"It's going to be an amazing time! The focus of the show: glamour...a little bit of Vegas, but magic! It's gonna be a full experience!\"\n\nWhile no setlist has been revealed, expect Kylie to perform 'Padam Padam' and many more tracks from Tension, her 16th studio album, which is out September 22, as well as from her catalog of greatest hits (think \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" and \"All the Lovers\").\n\n\"Everything about Kylie reflects the essence of Voltaire,\" Michael Gruber, the producer who brought Voltaire to life, said in a press release. \"Her music is fun. Her spirit is absolutely infectious. And she's at the top of her game, which makes this a truly special moment for fans to connect in such an intimate environment.\"\n\nThe residency is absolutely thrilling news for American and U.S.-based fans of the global icon, who has performed quite sporadically in the States over her four-decade career. In fact, her only proper U.S. tour (outside a few one-off concerts and appearances) was 2009's For You, For Me Tour, which featured nine dates in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nAccording to the press release, fans can expect a high-couture fashion aesthetic (with designers who've created pieces for Kylie as well as Beyoncé and Mariah Carey) and an art deco design created by Tony- and Emmy-winning production designer Derek McLane, who's worked on Broadway shows as well as the Oscars and the Met Gala. \"The creative team has designed an environment where people can get up and dance at their tables and revel in the night,\" Kylie says in the press release. \"That's what Voltaire is and I can't wait to perform in this intimate and exciting setting.\" Tickets and packages go on sale on August 9 at voltairelv.com.\n\nKylie is currently on yet another career high thanks to the viral success of her worldwide global smash, 'Padam Padam' — one of the summer's most talked-about, meme-generating singles, resonating with longtime fans as well as younger ones who weren't born when \"Locomotion\" came out. \"It's been an incredible journey,\" she told HELLO! Thursday. \"I will be forever grateful for Padam and for what it's given me and what it's given my audience.\n\n\"It's such a joy that my audience and then some have taken it as their own,\" she added of the phenomenon. \"These people doing their own versions of it, their own merchandise. All the TikToks and the Reels…It's gone beyond anything I could have imagined.\"\n\nWOW: Kylie Minogue sizzles in tiny black mini dress you don't want to miss\n\nRELATED: What Kylie's said about having kids\n\nTension follows Kylie's masterful 2020 LP, Disco. Of course, she was unable to tour for that LP thanks to the global pandemic, but recorded a livestream event, Infinite Disco, which was streamed worldwide."
