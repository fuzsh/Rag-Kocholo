        "text": "Kylie Minogue got lucky, lucky, lucky in the Armadale real estate market in September this year. That was when she sold a cute Victorian terrace house for more than $1.7 million â€“ a tidy profit on the sub-$200,000 she was reported to have paid for it in 1990.\n\nWhether the residents of Armadale were aware the Singing Budgie was one of them is something of a moot point: the Cambridge Street property was an investment rented out to a series of tenants and never lived in by Minogue.\n\nREAD MORE: Australia's property prices smash records with fastest growth ever\n\nHowever, there's no doubt that, as a fashionista, she's very familiar with Armadale's High Street, which has grown from a fusty haven into one of Melbourne's premier fashion strips with boutiques from leading labels such as Camilla and Marc and Scanlan Theodore.\n\nIt's the sort of local shopping strip where you don't duck out for a loaf of bread in your trackies, although designer leisurewear is a different story among the crowd doing the school run or the Saturday morning cafe parade.\n\nSeven kilometres south-east of the CBD, the City of Stonnington's little jewel has plenty to celebrate.\n\nQuieter than Brighton, less flashy than South Yarra, it has the august character of Toorak and the same blue-chip appeal of serious, designer-decorated heritage homes.\n\nGrand Victorian and Edwardian houses with heritage overlays mean the streetscapes are kept relatively intact, although there is a strong enough showing of apartments and townhouses to change a bit of the scenery.\n\nBordered by Glenferrie Road, Orrong Road, Malvern Road and Dandenong Road, it slots easily into the list of Melbourne's 10 priciest suburbs, with the schools (Lauriston Girls' School and The King David School among them) and manicured parks such as Toorak Park and Union Street Gardens to show for it."
