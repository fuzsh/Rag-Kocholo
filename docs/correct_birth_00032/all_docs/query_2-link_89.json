        "text": "Kylie Minogue’s famous gold hot pants and iconic Charlene overalls are among two iconic costumes explored in a new podcast Kylie: Behind the Seams launched today by Arts Centre Melbourne. The podcast is hosted by two Kylie Minogue super fans – Owen Minogue aka Owen Lambourn and Joseph Berto (O and Joe) who delve into her ever-evolving outfits stored and cared for in the Australian Performing Arts Collection (APAC) at Arts Centre Melbourne.\n\nThe first two episodes of Kylie : Behind the Seams have been released today with four more to follow and are available through Spotify, Google, and Apple podcasts. Fans can also watch episodes of the podcasts on Art Centre Melbourne’s YouTube channel.\n\nIn each episode, released fortnightly through JOY Media, the hosts discuss a Kylie costume from the Australian Performing Arts Collection spanning the iconic musician’s extraordinary career, including old, new, and other little-known works of art. These include Kylie’s famous gold hot pants from ‘Spinning Around’ video clip, Charlene’s overalls worn in Neighbours, costumes from her debut album, Kylie and the Did It Again’ music video off the Impossible Princess album as well as Showgirl and Kiss Me Once tours.\n\nAustralian Performing Arts Collection Head of Curatorial Margot Anderson:\n\nKylie Minogue’s costumes always prompt a great response from visitors and her fans see them through a particularly focussed lens. We’re often amazed by the level of detail a Kylie fan can recall about different items they have seen her wear in video clips or on stage and we’ve learnt a lot from their engagement with her collection.\n\nIn 2003 the Australian Performing Arts Collection at Arts Centre Melbourne welcomed an extensive donation of costumes from Kylie Minogue. This continued to grow in 2004 and formed the basis of subsequent exhibitions celebrating her career as an internationally acclaimed recording artist and performer. Currently there are around 1000 items from Kylie in the Collection.\n\nEstablished in 1975, the Australian Performing Arts Collection is the nation’s largest collection of performing arts history and traditions, acquiring performing arts material across the five key collecting areas of circus, dance, music, opera, and theatre.\n\nPodcast hosts Owen and Joe became friends more than 20 years ago through the Kylie Krew – a group of super fans who came together through Kylie Minogue’s music and fandom. Owen Minogue may be Kylie Minogue’s most recognised super fan, having spent close to $200,000 on his love of Kylie through music, tickets and memorabilia."
