        "text": "Arts Centre Melbourne will be home to Australia’s music hall of fame with the announcement of the Australian Music Vault, a new exhibition space dedicated to sharing the story of Australian contemporary music.\n\nCreated in collaboration with the music industry, it will include a free exhibition exploring the history and future of Australian music, education programs, a fully integrated digital program and items from the iconic people, events and places that define Australian music.\n\nMinister for Creative Industries Martin Foley today also announced the Australian Music Vault’s founding patrons – pivotal music industry figures, Kylie Minogue, Michael Gudinski, Archie Roach and Ian ‘Molly’ Meldrum.\n\nThe Music Vault will be supported by an advisory body with members from across the industry including APRA Chair Jenny Morris, ARIA CEO Dan Rosen and Australian Music Industry Network Chair Patrick Donovan.\n\nThe Australian music industry has been calling for a music hall of fame for more than 15 years. It has now been made possible through our $22.2m Music Works program, the largest investment by an Australian Government in contemporary music.\n\nArts Centre Melbourne is Australia’s busiest performing arts centre and home to an extensive music collection with best-practice curatorial, collection management and programming experience.\n\nIt has a strong track record of creating exhibitions dedicated to Australian music legends, including the likes of AC/DC, Midnight Oil, Nick Cave and Kylie Minogue.\n\nThe Sidney Myer Music Bowl also holds a significant place in music history: in 1967 it hosted a homecoming concert for The Seekers attended by more than 200,000 people – the biggest music event ever held in Australia.\n\nArts Centre Melbourne’s current exhibition Kylie on Stage has welcomed more than 150,000 visitors in just two months. The Centre’s Gallery 1 space will undergo a significant redevelopment in 2017 to create the Australian Music Vault, due to open in November.\n\nQuotes attributable to Minister for Creative Industries Martin Foley\n\n“Melbourne is one of the great music cities of the world. The industry has been calling for a hall of fame for many years and we’re proud to be working with the industry to make it a reality.”\n\n“The Australian Music Vault will be a place for music lovers, tourists and artists. It will celebrate the history of Australian music and be a place for the music legends of tomorrow.”\n\nQuotes attributable to Arts Centre Melbourne CEO Claire Spencer\n\n“Music is in our blood at Arts Centre Melbourne and we are thrilled to be partnering with the Victorian Government and the music industry to realise this exciting project.\n\n“Music is a quintessential part of the Melbourne experience and we can’t wait to unlock the stories of Australian music by giving life to the Australian Music Vault.”\n\nQuotes attributable to Mushroom Group Chairman Michael Gudinski\n\n“Australian music has created and underpinned some of the great moments in our nation’s history. From the political to the celebratory, the power and influence of music on our culture is undeniable.”\n\n“Creating a permanent home to honour our rich and diverse music landscape has been a passion of mine for many years and I’m so proud that the Australian Music Vault will be housed in Australia’s undisputed music capital.”"
