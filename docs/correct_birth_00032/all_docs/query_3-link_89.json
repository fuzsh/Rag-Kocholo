        "text": "Kylie Minogue\n\nProfile\n\nChart History\n\nKylie Ann Minogue, OBE (born 28 May 1968) — often known simply as Kylie — is an Australian singer, recording artist, songwriter, showgirl, and actress.\n\nAfter beginning her career as a child actress on Australian television, she achieved recognition through her role in the television soap opera Neighbours, before commencing her career as a recording artist in 1987. Her first single, \"Locomotion\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles chart and became the highest-selling single of the decade. This led to a contract with songwriters and producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. Her debut album, Kylie (1988), and the single \"I Should Be So Lucky\", each reached number one in the UK, and over the next two years, her first 13 singles reached the British top ten.\n\nInitially presented as a \"girl next door\", Minogue attempted to convey a more mature style in her music and public image. Her singles were well received, but after four albums her sales were declining, and she left Stock, Aitken & Waterman in 1992 to establish herself as an independent performer. Her next single, \"Confide in Me\", reached number one in Australia and was a hit in several European countries in 1994, and a duet with Nick Cave, \"Where the Wild Roses Grow\", brought Minogue a greater degree of artistic credibility. Drawing inspiration from a range of musical styles and artists, Minogue took creative control over the songwriting for her next album, Impossible Princess (1997).\n\nDate Title Peak Position # of plays Timebomb 12 24\n\nOur Partners\n\nTune in to the most interesting “hot” stories from the local and international music scenes.
