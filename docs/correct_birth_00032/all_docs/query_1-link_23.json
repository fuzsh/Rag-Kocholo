        "text": "Kylie Minogue is to be presented with one of France’s highest cultural awards.\n\nThe Australian singer will receive the prestigious “Chevalier dans L’ordre des Arts et Lettres” (Knight in the Order of Arts and Letters) at a ceremony May 5 in Paris, on the eve of her world tour kick-off.\n\nThe honor, which acknowledges her “contribution to the enrichment of French culture,” sees Minogue joins the ranks of celebrated past recipients, which includes singers Ella Fitzgerald and Bob Dylan, plus actors Meryl Streep and Robert Redford.\n\n“I am deeply honored to be recognized in this way,” the Melbourne-born, London-based artist said in a statement issued today. “French culture has influenced me greatly and I have always had colossal respect for the arts and people of France”.\n\nMinogue is in something on a purple patch when it comes to trophies. In December, she became an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for “services to music,” an honor which she will receive from Queen Elizabeth II during a ceremony in July.\n\nThe artist, who recovered from breast cancer to relaunch her career in 2007 with her 10th album “X” (Parlophone), claimed the U.K. Music Industry Trusts’ Award last October, becoming the first female beneficiary of the prestigious gift, and at 39, the youngest in its 16-year history. And in February, she collected the international female artist gong at the Brit Awards.\n\nHowever, Minogue won’t have much time to reflect on her prizes. Her “KYLIE X2008” tour commences May 6 at the Paris Bercy, after which time it travels through much of Europe.\n\nThe run, which cost a reputed £10 million ($20 million) to stage, will include Minogue’s first-ever dates in Greece, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Luxembourg, Russia, Latvia and Spain. The tour wraps in London on Aug. 4 with the last of seven nights at the 02 Arena.\n\nHer record company this week reported that more than 500,000 tickets had been sold."
