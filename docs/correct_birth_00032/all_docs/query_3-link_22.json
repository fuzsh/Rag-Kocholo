        "text": "She's got our heads Spinning Around!\n\nKylie Minogue has been a music icon since the 80s when she released her debut album 'Kylie'! This year alone, Kylie has narrated an episode of a Bluey spin-off, received the BRITs Global Icon Award - and if that wasn't enough, she's also released a song with Sia called 'Dance Alone' and even performed on stage with Madonna!\n\nDespite not technically being a Brit, we've certainly adopted her as one of our own. With millions of fans around the world, and so much media coverage of the singer over the years, it can feel like you already know everything there is to know about Ms. Minogue. In honour of the pop princess and her incredible performance at BST Hyde Park in July 2024, we've compiled some of our favourite Kylie facts...\n\n1. 'The Locomotion' was the biggest selling single of the 80s in Australia\n\nKylie Minogue released 'The Locomotion' as her first single in Australia, and it stayed at Number 1 for a total of seven weeks. At the end of the decade, someone did the maths and it ended up being the biggest selling single of the 1980s in Australia. Who doesn't love a bit of that Kylie classic?\n\nWATCH: Kylie Minogue - 'Locomotion' - Official Video\n\n2. 'I Should Be So Lucky' was written in just 40 minutes\n\nIt's one of the most catchy songs and it was written in just over half an hour. Kylie flew to the UK to meet music gurus Stock Aitken Waterman. The story goes that they forgot Kylie was coming, had nothing prepared for her to test out and put together 'I Should Be So Lucky' while they were waiting for her to arrive at the meeting.\n\nWATCH: Kylie Minogue - 'I Should Be So Lucky'\n\n3. Kylie's music featured in a jukebox musical named after her song\n\nThat's right! In July 2023, it was announced that theatre show I Should Be So Lucky would feature songs by the Hit Factory AND star Kylie herself digitally in the production. The show had its world premiere in November 2023 and toured the UK and Ireland until May 2024.\n\nShe said of being involved: \"I’m thrilled to announce that I will be joining Stock Aitken Waterman in presenting the new musical, 'I Should Be So Lucky'! It is the music that inspired a generation (plus my first five albums!) so to have all the SAW hits in this original story will make for a compelling, funny and heartfelt show. Let’s enjoy the magic all over again!\"\n\nShow writer and director Debbie Isitt told The Oxford Magazine of Kylie's character in the show: \"The concept was Kylie being bride Ella’s reflection in the mirror – playing her inner diva – her inner confidence if you like. I wanted Kylie to play a version of herself – but also to be properly integrated into the story.\"\n\n4. Kylie Minogue's Glastonbury performance was the festival's most watched ever\n\nKylie was heartbroken when she had to cancel her Glastonbury performance in 2005 due to her breast cancer diagnosis, however 14 years later, she got to fulfil her dream.
