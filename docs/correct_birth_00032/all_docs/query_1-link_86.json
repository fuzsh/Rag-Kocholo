        "text": "LOS ANGELES —Kylie Minogue has visited Las Vegas in person, and in spirit.\n\nShe learned so much in a scouting mission in May 2022. Minogue saw Lady Gaga’s “Jazz + Piano” show and the Anderson .Paak-Bruno Mars Silk Sonic production, both at Dolby Live at Park MGM. She also attended John Legend’s performance at then-Zappos Theater (now Bakkt Theater).\n\n“I saw three different different shows, in two different venues,” Minogue said as she announced her residency at The Venetian’s Voltaire nightclub beginning Nov. 3. “The shows I saw were very much lines of seats looking at the stage. I think Voltaire is going to be more organic, more flowy.”\n\nMinogue said the artists connected with the audience — including her — in those performances.\n\n“I felt close to them, even though I didn’t know all the songs,” Minogue said in the mingle-interview session at Pendry West Hollywood hotel. “I had a great night. It was a reassurance that if someone comes to my show and doesn’t know my catalogue, they can still be entertained.”\n\nMinogue invoked Vegas-flavored images in her 2005 “Showgirl” tour and “Aphrodite: Les Folies” tour six years later.\n\n“With ‘Showgirls,’ this was very much me saying, ‘This should be in Vegas!’” Minogue said. “And ‘Aphrodite’ was a lot of fountains and over-the-top everything. Voltaire is not going to be like those shows, but it will be an experience, it will be an event.”\n\nVoltaire is billed as an “enhanced,” 1,000-capacity nightclub in the former Opaline Theater space across from Summit Showroom (and also Starbucks).\n\nMinogue will play weekends. Tickets are on sale Aug. 9 at voltairelv.com, and will start at $200-$300 and rising to $2,200 for show-club-and room packages booked through Ticketmaster’s new experience sales platform.\n\nDerek McLane, the Emmy and Tony award-winning production designer from “Moulin Rouge,” the Academy Awards telecast and this year’s Met Gala, is devising the show’s set.\n\n“I really wanted it to feel like an escape from the environment of the casino floor. Something that\n\nfelt like a completely different world. An intimate, exciting, and inviting world,” McLane said.\n\nRob Sinclair, the Emmy winning lighting and production designer, is creating the show’s atmospheric effects. Sinclair has a lengthy list of superstar partners, among them Madonna, Queen + Adam Lambert, David Byrne and Adele.\n\nThe 55-year-old Minogue broke through internationally with “The Loco-Motion” in 1988. She is enjoying momentum entering her Vegas residency with “Padam Padam.” The dance hit is Minogue’s first top-10 single on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Songs chart since that chart was founded in 2013.\n\nThe development of Minogue’s show and the redesign of the theater has been a high priority for resort exec Michael Gruber. The former Caesars Entertainment executive official is chief content officer and lead entertainment official at Venetian/Palazzo.\n\nThe nightclub space is where “Rock of Ages,” Blue Man Group have performed. The venue has also staged such headliners as Steely Dan and Ringo Starr and his All-Starr Band. The Venetian is presenting the show, with GM Michael Gruber leading the Las Vegas production effort.\n\nVoltaire’s concept will include DJs, cabaret, burlesque.\n\n“Everything about Kylie reflects the essence of Voltaire. Her music is fun. Her spirit is absolutely infectious. And she’s at the top of her game, which makes this a truly special moment for fans to connect in such an intimate environment,” Gruber said.\n\nAnd from The Venetian Resort President and CEO Patrick Nichols, “Voltaire will lead a revival in high-caliber nightlife giving guests an unexpected night out, but also the opportunity to see some of their favorite artists in an intimate way.”\n\nThe hotel is anticipating international business in this pairing. Minogue is a major star in her native Australia, where she is the best-selling female artist ever in that country.\n\nMinogue is also massively popular in the U.K. “Padam Padam” has grown into an anthem for the LGBTQ culture, played in Pride parades around the world. Minogue has long been a favorite of the LGBTQ community."
