She is currently a coach on The Voice Australia after being a coach on the UK series of The Voice.\n\nLife and Career[]\n\nKylie Ann Minogue was born 28 May 1968 in Melbourne, Australia, the oldest child of Ronald Charles Minogue, an accountant of Irish ancestry and a Welsh mother, Carol Ann (née Jones), a former dancer from Maesteg, Wales. Through her maternal line, Kylie has an English grandmother. Minogue lives in London, United Kingdom and has done so for the past 20 years. Minogue's sister, Dannii Minogue, is also a pop singer as well as a judge on Australia's Got Talent, while her brother, Brendan Minogue, works as a news cameraman in Australia. The Minogue children were raised in Surrey Hills, Melbourne, and educated at Camberwell High School.\n\nThe Minogue sisters began their careers as children on Australian television. From the age of 11, Kylie appeared in small roles in soap operas such as The Sullivans and Skyways, and in 1985 was cast in one of the lead roles in The Henderson Kids. Interested in following a career in music, she made a demo tape for the producers of the weekly music programme Young Talent Time, which featured Dannii as a regular performer. Kylie gave her first television singing performance on the show in 1985 but was not invited to join the cast. Dannii's success overshadowed Kylie's acting achievements, until Kylie was cast in the soap opera Neighbours in 1986, as Charlene Mitchell, a schoolgirl turned garage mechanic. Neighbours achieved popularity in the UK, and a story arc that created a romance between her character and the character played by Jason Donovan, culminated in a wedding episode in 1987 that attracted an audience of 20 million British viewers.\n\nHer popularity in Australia was demonstrated when she became the first person to win four Logie Awards in one event, and the youngest recipient of the \"Gold Logie\" as the country's \"Most Popular Television Performer\", with the result determined by public vote.\n\nThe Voice[]\n\nIn January 2013, Minogue and her manager Terry Blamey, whom she had worked with since the start of her singing career, parted ways. The following month, she was signed to Roc Nation for a management deal. In September, she was featured on Italian singer-songwriter Laura Pausini's single \"Limpido\", which was a number-one hit in Italy and has received a nomination for \"World's Best Song\" at the 2013 World Music Awards. In the same month, she was hired as a coach in the third series of BBC One's talent competition The Voice UK, alongside record producer and Black Eyed Peas member, will.i.am, Kaiser Chiefs' lead singer Ricky Wilson and pop singer Sir Tom Jones. Minogue's first episode on the show aired on 11 January 2014. Minogue will not return for the second series of the show, citing tour commitments as the reason for her departure. In November, she was hired as one of the new coaches for the third season of The Voice Australia.\n\n10 Best Hits[]"
