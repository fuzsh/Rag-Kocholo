You see everything differently.\n\n“I remember having had my diagnosis, but the world didn’t know. I was with my brother and my boyfriend at the time – we were all in a daze and went to a cafe.\n\n“The server at the cafe was like, ‘Hey, how are you today?’ We just kind of robotically said, ‘Good, thanks,’ and in that moment I just thought: You really don’t know what anyone is going through.\n\n“I thought that same person by tomorrow is going to see the news and say, ‘Oh my God, she was here yesterday, and we didn’t know’.”\n\nREAD MORE: Omicron: Two symptoms that come on 'rapidly' - not typically seen with a cold - virologist\n\nBreast cancer is the most common type of cancer in the UK.\n\nMost women diagnosed with the condition are over the age of 50, but younger women can also get breast cancer, says the NHS.\n\nBreast cancer may present with a number of symptoms. The health body explains: “The first noticeable symptom is usually a lump or area of thickened breast tissue.\n\n“Most breast lumps are not cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked by a doctor.”"
