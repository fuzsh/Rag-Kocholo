        "text": "Melbourne’s most famous sisters, Kylie and Dannii Minogue, have not had a Melbourne laneway named in their honour because of the Victorian government’s strict naming rules.\n\nMinogue fan Eliza Day created a petition on change.org to push for the honour.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Push for Melbourne laneway to be named in Minogue’s honour.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\n“They are undeniably pivotal figures in pop culture,” Day wrote.\n\n“Their contribution to the music industry combined with their unwavering advocacy, love, and support for the LGBTQIA+ community makes them deserving of recognition.”\n\nDuring recent US Pride celebrations, a West Hollywood street was renamed “Kylie Minogue Way”.\n\nBut Kylie is unlikely to receive a similar tribute in her home city as the Victorian government does not allow “naming applications” for living persons, the Herald Sun reported on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to the rules, exemptions to commemorate a living person are “strongly discouraged” and generally not permitted because “community attitudes and opinions can change over time”.\n\nEven in the event of death, those lobbying for a laneway must wait two years before submitting a naming application.\n\nMelbourne has an AC/DC Lane, named after the band in 2004, while Dame Edna Everage, the alter-ego of Barry Humphries, had a laneway named after her in 2007.\n\nBut Divinyls frontwoman, Chrissy Amphlett, was only honoured with Amphlett Lane two years after her death of breast cancer in 2013.\n\nMelbourne Lord Mayor Nick Reece wouldn’t be drawn on the naming, but praised the two women for their contribution to the city."
