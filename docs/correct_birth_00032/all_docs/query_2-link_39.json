        "text": "Kylie Minogue — who partially recorded her new album Disco under the UK's lockdown — says she misses Australia and \"can't wait to come back home as soon as possible\".\n\nMinogue told 7.30's Leigh Sales the global coronavirus crisis had been an \"emotional rollercoaster\" both in a personal and global sense.\n\n\"I'm so grateful and thankful to be able to be well and working through lockdown,\" she said.\n\n\"And to know that Melbourne and Victoria are opening up slowly, as of today, is a great relief for me, with my family there.\"\n\nThe 52-year-old pop singer, who has lived and worked in England since the 1990s, said she had always felt like she didn't take for granted being able to fly back to Australia.\n\n\"But now I really, really, really feel like I must have taken it for granted,\" she said.\n\n\"I have never felt further from home or from my family.\n\n\"Time is so weird right now — was something yesterday or was it six months ago? — but it shouldn't be too long before I can get home. Anyway, hopefully.\"\n\nRecording from a home studio\n\nMinogue, who lives in London, said the lockdown in the UK began while she was midway through recording her 15th studio album in Brighton.\n\n\"None of us knew what we were walking into,\" she said.\n\nDespite the Government's orders to stay home, she wanted to continue working so found a microphone and a recording interface in an old cupboard and kept writing with her collaborators via Zoom.\n\nAfter a period of adaptation, she said recording at home was much like being in a studio.\n\n\"I was juggling a lot, though, because I was on my own, basically,\" she said.\n\n\"I felt like I was producing the whole thing.\n\n\"I was also dealing with other writers, and they've got kids, so they'd say, 'well we can work up to 1:30pm and then it's nap time'.\n\n\"So it was initially very different, but we settled in.\"\n\nMinogue said Disco, which is coming out on November 6, lived up to its title, using 70s disco lyrical references, sounds and melodies as a starting point but with some 80s flavours and call-backs to her own albums of the 2000s.\n\n\"Mostly, it's escapism,\" she said, with some elements of \"melancholy and longing\".\n\n'I tried to stop that from becoming morose'\n\nThe coronavirus shutdown did have a silver lining, of a sort, the pop princess said: it forced her to slow down, something she has rarely done before.\n\n\"I mean, what else could we do?\" she said.\n\n\"I tried to stop that from becoming morose, which, you know, that's a thing for me.\n\n\"I'm so used to having a level of adrenaline, even if it's kind of low-level, and then spiking with touring and pushing through and getting the work done or being on when you have to be on.\n\n\"So that was a slightly odd sensation for me, to just be realistic with myself.\n\n\"So I think my body is probably grateful for it, just slowing down for a minute.\"\n\nKylie Minogue is among the great Australian acts on the bill for the first episode of the second series of The Sound this Sunday at 6:00pm (AEDT).\n\nAsk us your coronavirus questions"
