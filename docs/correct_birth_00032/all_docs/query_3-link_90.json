        "text": "Your personality is adaptable. You understand and relate to the world around you via the medium of thought and intellect. Memorization, comparison, analysis, and the verbalization of your mental imagery are your favorite activities. You seek to extend your personality by a mental outreach to a multitude of new ideas and factors, becoming acquainted with an ever-increasing variety of facets of human nature. Thus, language and symbolic expression, written or oral, are your primary resources in life, although they are also potential pitfalls. Your eloquence, wit, and verve, your mastery of language, unquestionably give your power over other people (via communication) and things (science and technique). But taken to extremes, this faculty may lead to incoherency. It is thus vital for you to find an outlet for your flow of verbal expression, you must explain, communicate, and speak. If it is dammed up, you will undoubtedly suffer.\n\nYour flow of words is the expression of your vital energy, the proof that you are alive and well. If you are forced to be silent, you would be cut off from the bonds that hold you together. A kind of duality or split personality might emerge… remember Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde? “They” were a classic case. For all of the above reasons, you are naturally gregarious and sociable. You make friends quickly and easily. Your contacts and networks are important to you, because they enable you to evolve. They are a source of self-fulfillment and identification. Any form of play is also important to you, and only severe depression will deprive you of your playfulness.\n\nYou sometimes amuse yourself by acting out a variety of roles on the stage of life, just for the fun of it. Your animation and wit give you a talent for improvisation and adaptation. However, adaptability is a two-bladed sword. You are liable to find yourself in a superficial bind, having jettisoned certain important ideas in order to move about more freely. You are also sensitive, but your emotions and feelings are sometimes subject to the scrutiny and censorship of your intellect. Thus, you cannot free yourself to the strength of great passions and energies without idealizing them to a certain degree and giving them intellectual resonance. Wary of your irrational instincts and urges, you tend to control or repress them. But you will do well to learn that the intellect is not omnipotent, especially where instinct is concerned.\n\nInhabiting a\n\nKylie Minogue needs movement. She is a talented communicator.\n\nKylie Minogue needs others to fulfill her and accomplish her ambitions.\n\nAt the time of your birth, your rising sign was located in Leo (the Lion), while the sun was passing through the sign of Gemini (the Twins). A summary of the various clues mentioned above provides your personality profile.\n\nYou are a person with a strong need for contact with others. You are determined and have a strong mental agitation. You are proud and self-assured, but also have a sense of humour and a love of frivolity. You are also gifted with a great sense of communication and a flair for being creative.\n\nDespite a difficulty in settling down and making a career choice, you can be trusted to make wise decisions and take initiative. You also have a tendency to be a dilettantist, with a great capacity for brilliance. You are also generous and have a deep sense of compassion.\n\nYou have an inner duality, which can cause you to experience tension in some areas of your life. However, you are also highly sensitive and can be easily emotionally affected. You must be careful not to let your emotions get in the way of making sound decisions.\n\nBorn on the third day after the new moon, Kylie Minogue is said to be a “soli-lunar” type, which gives her a subjective character, somewhat impulsive and sometimes emotive. Generally, she doesn’t see the world in objective terms; instead, she bases her attitude on the feelings various situations arouse inside her. Likewise, in human relationships, she tends to project her imaginary reality onto others instead of seeing them for what they are. As a result, her judgements and reasoning are sometimes deprived of perspective. She may want to make an effort to refrain from overinterpreting other people’s actions, because, being the product of her imagination in most cases, her interpretations are mistaken. If she applies herself to listening more openly, people may reveal their deeper motivations. She’ll be happier and more effective as a result.\n\nThis relationship could yield a high degree of psychological compatibility and powerful mutual attraction. Kylie Minogue’s personality will exert a magnetic pull over the sensitivity, receptivity, tenderness, and other key qualities of your partner.\n\nKylie Minogue’s moon is located at 15° GEMINI. Her ideal match is a partner with the sun at 9/21° GEMINI or SAGITTARIUS.\n\nKylie Minogue would be particularly well-matched to someone who mirrors her underlying psychic and unconscious aspirations. The secret ideal you cherish of the perfect partner would be aroused; it would harmonize beautifully with your ideal imaginary lover. This great psychic compatibility is the result of a harmonious relationship between the Moon of the masculine chart and the sun of the feminine one. It is propitious to a rich flow of energies between the most hidden and secret parts of both people. They are linked by an unconscious emotional bond.\n\nKylie Minogue’s Venus is located at 0° GEMINI. Her ideal match is a partner with Mars at 0/10° GEMINI or SAGITTARIUS.\n\nThis type of partner would complement Kylie Minogue perfectly in emotional and sentimental terms. This person would reflect and fulfill Kylie Minogue’s ideal of sensuality to the greatest degree. Moreover, Kylie Minogue’s ideal partner would resonate lastingly with Kylie Minogue’s own psychic projections of her ideal. This positive relationship between the unconscious sexual yearnings of both partners would be likely to yield sensual relations of a tantalizingly mysterious and secret nature.\n\nBecause Kylie Minogue enjoys the game of seduction, she may go from conquest to conquest, until she finally becomes dissatisfied with her love life and makes a more definitive choice. In this case, she would be wise to choose this type of person. Brilliant, witty, and amusing, they will sparkle with the excitement she needs. Their unpredictability and secret vulnerability will delight her. The intellectual exchange and communication between her and you will be rich and fulfilling.\n\nKylie Minogue’s Planet Mars is located at 13° GEMINI. Her ideal match is a partner with Venus at 7/19° GEMINI or SAGITTARIUS."
