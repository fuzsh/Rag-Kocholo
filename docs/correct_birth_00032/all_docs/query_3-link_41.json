        "text": "Kylie Minogue is a superstar who walked the path from a typical girl-next-door to a superstar of pop music. She was born in Melbourne in 1968, in a family of British and Irish origin. She started her career as an actress in Australian TV by taking part in a popular TV series Neighbors. Her musical career officially started in 1987 when the first single \"Loco-Motion\" was released. In 1988 she signed up with a British recording company and released her first album Kylie, with the famous single \"I Should Be So Lucky\". The young pop star was experimenting with her image and releasing new singles and albums, which could not be as successful as her first one. Only in 1994 her song \"Confide In Me\" made it to the top charts and reminded the world about Kylie as a successful singer. In 2000 Minogue released two very good solo albums, and she took part in the opening ceremony of the Olympics in Sydney. In 2001 her album Fever became extremely popular in the US, which made the singer recognizable and famous in the American continent as well. In 2005 she was diagnosed with breast cancer and had to finish her tour fast in order to undergo chemotherapy. She was back on stage a year later to continue her triumphant career. Kylie has released 14 solo albums so far, and has spent month and month touring. She has sold over 80 million records and is the owner of a great number of musical awards, including Grammy, The Brits, ARIA, and many others. In 2008 she was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for her notable contribution in music. She often takes part in various charity projects, especially for victims of earthquakes or other natural disasters, abused children, cancer, and so on. She was never married but was in a relationship with such artists as Olivier Martinez, Andr√©s Velencoso, and Joshua Sasse."
