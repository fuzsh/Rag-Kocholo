        "text": "Kylie Minogue is a renowned Australian singer-songwriter and actress. She started her career at a very young age by appearing in Australian television series, such as ‘Skyways,’ ‘The Sullivans,’ ‘The Henderson Kids,’ and ‘Neighbours.’ It was ‘Neighbours’ that helped her gain recognition in the UK. Subsequently, an English record company decided to give her a break. Over the years, Kylie has given many hit albums, such as ‘Kylie,’ ‘Kylie Minogue,’ ‘Fever,’ ‘Rhythm of Love,’ ‘Body Language,’ etc. She has worked in many movies as well. Her concerts are considered to be iconic and she is a style icon all over the world. Her energy and public persona have led people and media to constantly compare her with Madonna. While Madonna is known as the ‘Queen of Pop,’ Kylie is called the ‘Princess of Pop.’ As far as her personal life is concerned, she suffered from breast cancer but fought it bravely and survived. After her recovery, she made it a point to talk about her fight with cancer in order to encourage and inspire people struggling with cancer."
