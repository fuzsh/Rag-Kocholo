        "text": "Kylie Minogue AO OBE (b. 1968), the 'Princess of Pop', is Australia's most successful female recording artist of all time, selling more than 80 million albums worldwide, and the first woman to have a UK number one album across five consecutive decades. Born in Melbourne, Minogue rose to local and international fame playing Charlene in the television soap Neighbours in the 1980s (she remains the youngest person to have won the Gold Logie). Her singing career began with a cover version of the 1960s song 'The Loco-Motion'. She signed a contract with the English hitmakers Stock Aitken Waterman in 1987 and made history by achieving more than 20 consecutive top ten hits in the UK. A change of record labels in 1992 ushered in a more sophisticated sound and image, as did her relationship with Michael Hutchence. With an instinct for re-invention, she has been involved in unexpected collaborations, such as with Nick Cave on 'Where the Wild Roses Grow' in 1995, and has appeared in several films including Moulin Rouge (2001). After a triumphant appearance at the closing ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Olympics, at which she sang 'On a Night Like This', in 2002 Minogue won four ARIA awards for the album Fever (2001) containing her aptly-named biggest hit, 'Can’t Get You Out of My Head'. Fever went platinum in the US and she won a Grammy for 'Come Into My World' in 2002. Diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005, she became a prominent survivor, her ordeal inspiring hope in many women; she completed her cancelled Showgirl tour in 2006. Since her recovery, Minogue has continued a regular schedule of releasing music and touring, with highlights including performing at Queen Elizabeth II’s Diamond Jubilee Concert in 2012, a seven-song set for the 2014 Commonwealth Games Closing Ceremony, acting as a coach of The Voice UK and The Voice Australia, and appearing in the Legends Slot at the 2019 Glastonbury Festival. Her fifteenth studio album, Disco (2020), reached number one in Australia and the UK."
