        "text": "Kylie Ann Minogue (born 28 May 1968), also known mononymously as Kylie, is an Australian singer, songwriter and actress. Minogue is the highest-selling female Australian artist of all time, having sold over 70 million records worldwide. She has been recognised for reinventing herself in music and fashion, for which she is referred to by the European press as the “Princess of Pop” and a style icon.\n\nWhen Kylie was a ten-year-old she accompanied her sister Dannii to a hearing arranged by the sisters' aunt, Suzette, and, while producers found Dannii too young, Alan Hardy gave Kylie a minor role in the soap opera \"The Sullivans\" (1979). She also appeared in another small role in \"Skyways\" (1980). In 1985, she was cast in one of the lead roles in \"The Henderson Kids\". She was cast in the soap opera \"Neighbours\" in 1986, as Charlene Mitchell, a schoolgirl turned garage mechanic.\n\n\"The Sullivans\" is an Australian period drama television series produced by Crawford Productions which ran on the Nine Network from 15 November 1976 until 10 March 1983. The series tells the story of a fictional average middle-class Melbourne family and the effect that the Second World War and the immediate post-war events had on their lives. It covers the period between 1 September 1939 to 22 August 1948."
