        "text": "Although she's only managed a few hits in the U.S. since her arrival as a singer in 1987, Kylie Minogue is both Australia and Europe's biggest selling female pop singer over that period and a pop culture icon in those areas. Her image on the cover of magazines is guaranteed to produce extra sales. But a singing career was never what Minogue had in mind for herself.\n\nMinogue was born on May 28, 1968, in Melbourne. In 1979, she began her acting career in the Australian TV drama series Skyways, eventually gaining a starring role in a children's series, The Henderson Kids, before achieving national fame in the five-days-a-week soap opera Neighbours. Around the time Minogue joined, Neighbours also started airing in the U.K.\n\nA major celebrity on the basis of her Neighbours popularity, Minogue had agreed to give a charity performance in the company of other personalities, choosing to sing Little Eva's \"Loco-Motion. Someone hit on the idea of submitting a tape of the performance to local record company, Mushroom, who didn't think much of the demo, but saw the potential in releasing a single by the extremely popular young TV star. In their wildest dreams no one imagined a national number one record with the recorded version of \"Loco-Motion\" (July 1987).\n\nAt that time, Mushroom Records had formed a business relationship with London hit factory Stock Aitken and Waterman (Dead or Alive, Mel and Kim, Samantha Fox, Bananarama, Rick Astley) who also saw potential in working with the popular actress, but she wasn't a priority. In fact, when Minogue turned up at their London studios they had forgotten she was coming and quickly wrote her a song while she waited. The result, \"I Should Be So Lucky,\" gave Minogue the second of her six Australian number one singles and the first of her five English number ones. Now she became a priority for Stock Aitken and Waterman. As was their way, Stock Aitken and Waterman wrote and produced her records and they controlled her video image. Their re-recorded \"Loco-Motion\" put Minogue in the Top Ten in the U.S. In Australia, the U.K., and Europe, Minogue was scoring hit after hit and quickly left Neighbours to meet the demand on her.\n\nIf she was ever just along for the ride, Minogue took her first step towards control over her career with her 1990 single \"Better the Devil You Know,\" not letting Stock Aitken and Waterman see the video she was making for the song until it was completed. SAW insisted on casting her in a girl-next-door mode, while Minogue opted for a saucier Madonna-like image. It ensured her continued success and reputation as a celebrity beyond the pop charts. With her fourth album, Let's Go to It (1991), the singer also insisted on lyrical input.\n\nWhile Impossible Princess represented another major career turning point in Australia -- Minogue's transition to a concert performer -- in Europe the album was not considered a success. In 2000, she was encouraged by the Pet Shop Boys to switch to their label, Parlophone, and she re-emerged as the pop princess of old with the critical hit Light Years. The single \"Spinning Around,\" went number one in both England and Australia. Her reign in music continued in 2001. Minogue issued Fever in October on the heels of the successful single \"Can't Get You Out of My Head.\" Such hype around the song allowed it to become an global smash, earning Minogue two Brit Awards in February 2002 for \"Best International Female\" and \"Best International Album\" for Fever. Shortly thereafter, Fever was released in the U.S. on Capitol, landing Minogue her biggest U.S. hit with \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" in nearly fifteen years. Spots on MTV's TRL and Saturday Night Live proved her power. Body Language appeared in 2004."
