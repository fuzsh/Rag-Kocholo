        "text": "Diehard fan Eliza Day set up a petition on Monday to rename a Melbourne laneway “Minogue Lane” after the pop sisters.\n\nThe Minogues are “undeniably pivotal figures in pop culture”, Ms Day said, with naming a laneway after them a fitting gesture.\n\n“Their contribution to the music industry combined with their unwavering advocacy, love, and support for the LGBTQIA+ community makes them deserving of recognition in their hometown,” the petition read.\n\n“We believe that such a gesture would be a fitting tribute to these incomparable women and their contribution to society, culture and the entertainment industry.\n\n“This action would not only symbolise Melbourne’s appreciation for their work but also encourage a positive message of inclusivity that both sisters and our city champion.”\n\nKylie and Dannii established themselves as pop stars with hits like Can’t Get You Out Of My Headand I Begin To Wonder.\n\nKylie was slated to headline Splendour In The Grass later this year before the festival was axed, while her 2023 hit Padam Padam quickly reaffirmed the pop princess’s position as an Australian icon for a whole new generation.\n\nKylie was also awarded the global icon BRIT award this year, recognised as a “master of musical reinvention” for her 36 years – “and counting” – of music.\n\n“There’s a part of me that’s still the 14-year-old girl dreaming in her room of making music and being in this industry,” she said as she accepted the award.\n\nOne of Melbourne’s most notable commemorative lanes is the iconic AC/DC Lane in the heart of the CBD, named after the Australian rockers behind hits like Thunderstruck and It’s a Long Way to the Top.\n\nThe laneway was once home to the famed Cherry Bar, which has since moved to Little Collins St.\n\nMelbourne Lord Mayor Nicholas Reece didn’t confirm whether the city was considering the calls but said Melbourne was increasing its efforts to “commemorate incredible women”.\n\n“Melbourne should be so lucky to name one of our iconic laneways after the famed Minogue sisters,” he said.\n\n“We recognise the significant contributions Kylie and Dannii have made to our city – both as pop icons and Melburnian ambassadors to the world.\n\n“We’re increasing our efforts to commemorate incredible women for the vital role they’ve played in shaping our city through our new place and road naming policy and the soon-to-be erected Vida Goldstein statue.”\n\nDespite the impassioned push from fans, it’s understood the name doesn’t comply with the state government’s naming rules.\n\nUnder the rules, commemorating living people is strongly discouraged and typically not allowed, as community attitudes and opinions may change over time.\n\nIt’s also understood naming places after people can only be done if the person died more than five years ago."
