        "text": "Bio\n\nKylie Ann Minogue, OBE (born 28 May 1968) is an Australian pop singer, songwriter, and actress. After beginning her career as a child actor on Australian television, she achieved recognition through her role in the television soap opera Neighbours, before commencing her career as a recording artist in 1987. Her first single, \"The Loco-Motion\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles chart and became the highest selling single of the year. This led to a contract with songwriters and producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. Her debut album, Kylie (1988), and the single \"I Should Be So Lucky\", each reached number one in the United Kingdom, and over the next two years, her first thirteen singles reached the British top ten. Her debut film, The Delinquents (1989) was a box-office hit in Australia and the UK despite negative reviews."
