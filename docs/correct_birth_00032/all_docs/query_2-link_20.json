        "text": "The story behind a powerful image and the costume that made it.\n\nThe Australian Performing Arts Collection (APAC) is enriched by the valuable insights of the performers it represents. When developing new collections, curators often work closely with performers to understand their body of work and its impact on Australian performing arts history, along with the very personal journey that sits at its heart.\n\nIn 2003 APAC welcomed an extensive donation of costumes from Kylie Minogue. This continued to grow in 2004 and formed the basis of an exhibition celebrating Kylieâs career as an internationally acclaimed recording artist and performer.\n\nThis story takes us back to the weeks leading up to the opening of Kylie: The Exhibition in 2005 and the unexpected arrival of an extraordinary costume. Kylie recently took some time to reflect on the inspiration behind this costume and how it was brought to life. She and her team shared their recollections with curator Margot Anderson.\n\n\"I wanted an image that would illustrate the history of the collection and my personal connection to it.\"\n\nKylie Minogue, 2022\n\nIdentified as the Museum Dress, the costume was delivered to Arts Centre Melbourne wrapped in layers of tissue paper within a large box. This gift marked the end of the first instalment of Kylieâs costume donation. It was one of over 100 items that had been eagerly awaited and carefully unpacked since the first consignment landed on Christmas Eve in 2003.\n\nUnlike famous items such as Kylieâs gold hot pants or her white jumpsuit, this addition to the collection wasnât instantly identifiable. Its purpose became clear when it was established that this dress had been worn by Kylie for the exhibitionâs signature image.\n\nAs Kylieâs collection continues to grow and reflect the many aspects of her remarkable career, the Museum Dress has come to symbolise the importance of costume and the role it plays in the process of recording and preserving Australian performing arts history.\n\n\"I loved being able to create something new which incorporated historical pieces. It echoed how a costume is often made up of various things, some remarkable and some entirely unremarkable, but when put together in the right environment, they can transcend into something other.\"\n\nKylie Minogue, 2022\n\nThe Images\n\nAs one of the most photographed people in the world, Kylieâs image and her appearance on album covers, in magazines, video clips, social media and on stage is constantly changing.\n\nKylie mastered the art of transformation early in her career. She has commissioned the worldâs leading photographers to capture her creative evolution, illustrating a body of work that includes 15 albums and concert tours over a career spanning five decades.\n\nThe Museum Dress gathers many iconic images, re-framing them in a colourful montage that acts as a kind of time machine, travelling through pivotal moments throughout Kylieâs career.\n\nThe printed fabric stretched tight across the bodice samples images from her album covers while the skirt depicts Kylie on stage, in the studio and on location in a range of intriguing settings.\n\nThese moments are made more tangible with the addition of fabric samples and trims retained for backstage repairs on tour costumes.\n\nCombined with a handful of custom-made K and M pendants, this textured component adds a personal touch and another layer of nostalgia to the overall effect.\n\n\"For touring costumes there are usually extra pieces of fabric and trimmings for running repairs on the road, making doubles and even sometimes, triples! The pieces used in this image didnât get the spotlight the first time around but they finally did with this image representing the exhibition!\"\n\nKylie Minogue, 2022\n\nA Working Wardrobe\n\nJust as the Museum Dress was designed to be worn for a photo shoot, every costume in Kylie's collection was created for a specific purpose. It's a working wardrobe that reflects the many aspects of Kylie's career.\n\nThe level of workmanship varies widely according to the purpose of each costume. Some have been created to be merely glimpsed in motion for video clips and are often less finished.\n\nKylie's last minute decision to cut the sides of her jumpsuit for the Cant Get You Out of My Head video left a raw edge up each leg. The movement it created gave the costume even more impact.\n\nCostumes designed specifically for television have added detail for close-up filming and brighter lighting.\n\nUnlike Kylie's tour costumes, they don't need to reach out to arena size audiences, so there is less call for reflective crystals and sequins.\n\nKylie has developed a keen eye for a single element that can enhance her performance and she often makes her own alterations in the lead up to a show.\n\nThe costume designed for Kylie's duet with Justin Timberlake at the Brit Awards in 2001 was originally a floor length gown. Hours before the performance, the skirt was cut dramatically, making the act a standout moment on the night.\n\nKylie's tour costumes must withstand months of rigorous performance and can require a duplicate set on stand-by.\n\nComplex commissions can take several months to finish and require special consideration when being packed for travel between venues.\n\n\"The business of making costumes and looks for shoots for one of the worldâs biggest pop stars was a fast and furious one. We would often work around the clock, weekends, evenings. This time was no exception.\"\n\nLisa King, 2021\n\nThe Construction\n\n\"The fabric was delivered on set to Frank, who constructed it into the gown there and then. I never saw the fabric until the dress appeared in the exhibition at the V&A in London years later. What an honour. The sleepless nights were sure worth it!\"\n\nLisa King, 2021\n\nâWilliam Baker, Ed Meadham, Frank Strachan and Lisa King worked wonders to create this dress. It remains a favourite image of mine.â\n\nKylie Minogue, 2022\n\nThe Result\n\nKylie: The Exhibition went on to tour in Australia and the UK, breaking new ground in 2007 as the first exhibition dedicated to a pop star at Londonâs Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\nIn 2021 the Museum Dress was retrieved from storage at APAC and prepared to go back into the studio to be photographed for this story. Strachanâs last minute stitching was clearly visible where the bodice meets the skirt, making it fragile to handle, and there was a collective intake of breath as the dress was carefully laced up on the mannequin.\n\nAlthough structurally delicate, the Museum Dress is a powerful costume representing the multi-faceted career of one of Australiaâs most treasured performers.\n\nWe look forward to sharing this costume and more special items from the Australian Performing Arts Collection in our new storage, research and education facility opening in 2023.\n\nExplore more costumes captured in the Museum Dress\n\nItem 1 of 12\n\nCredits\n\nThank you to Kylie Minogue for her contribution to this story and for connecting us with the team that created the Museum Dress. Thanks also to Lisa King and Frank Strachan for sharing their recollections.\n\nAll costumes featured in this story were donated to the Australian Performing Arts Collection by Kylie Minogue in 2004.\n\nAll images of the Museum Dress courtesy of Darenote Ltd."
