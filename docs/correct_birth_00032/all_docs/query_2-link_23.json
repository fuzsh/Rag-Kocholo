        "text": "The Loco Motion singer's last official shows in Australia were part of her Golden Tour in March 2019 when she performed in various cities before continuing her concerts overseas.\n\nSpeaking to radio hosts Fifi Box, Brendan Fevola and Nick Cody show on Tuesday morning, Minogue spilled the beans about an Australian tour being on the cards.\n\n\"I want to say yes. Yes. The answer is yes!\" We’re just locking down details,\" Minogue told 101.9 The Fox Melbourne.\n\nHowever, the 56-year-old seemed to paused during her answer, indicating she may have announced the information prematurely.\n\n\"Maybe I wasn’t meant to say that, but yeah,\" she said with a laugh.\n\nMinogue's major news came during an interview off the back of her recent concert in London on Saturday for the BST Hyde Park festival.\n\n\"It was such a huge show, it was amazing, thanks for your support from a distance,\" Minogue told Fifi, Fev and Nick.\n\nThe Can't Get You Out Of My Head artist described her performance as \"emotional\", explaining a lot had happened in her life since her last BST festival appearance nine years ago.\n\n\"So much has happened for me, but for everyone,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm always struck with... you're face to face with tens of thousands of people and everyone's got their story, and we all just happened to be together in that moment, so it was emotional.\"\n\nMinogue shared some moments from the London festival on social media, thanking fans for their support on what she described as a \"special night\".\n\n\"Thank you band, singers, dancers, crew. And thank you for being such an incredible crowd,\" she wrote on Instagram on Monday, local time.\n\nAlthough Minogue's last tour of Australia was five years ago, she did perform in Sydney last February at the WorldPride Opening Concert in the Domain alongside her sister Dannii.\n\nDuring her 2019 tour in Australia, Minogue performed in Sydney, Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne, as well as the Hunter Valley in New South Wales and Mount Cotton in Queensland.\n\nMinogue resided in London for about three decades before confirming in 2021 that she was relocating back to her birth city of Melbourne to spend more time with family."
