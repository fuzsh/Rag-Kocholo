        "text": "Kylie Minogue attends the Burberry show during London Fashion Week on Sept. 18, 2023.\n\nKylie Minogue's net worth in 2024 has been more than four decades in the making.\n\nThe Australian megastar got started as a child star on TV soap operas before transitioning to the biggest pop solo artist from her native countryâ€”and one of the biggest around the world. Her star rose even further in 2023 and 2024 thanks to the success of \"Padam Padam\" and Tension.\n\n\"I actually have this sensation of 'What's happened with my career this year?!'\" she told Vulture. \"Whether you know me, like me, care about me, I think the success of this year is kind of beyond me.\"\n\nEver humble, the Down Under Wonder added, \"I'm just doing my best. I'm fully cognizant that it is a great time ... I don't know, it feels I'm naturally a warrior and I stress and care about every little bit.\" The star, 55, credits it to her work ethic.\n\n\"I'm doing better than ever before in finding a place where I can allow myself to be just to be and to be comfortable with myself and be comfortable with what's happening around me,\" she said. \"It's something that comes with age and time.\"\n\nAnd with all that comes money. Find out how much she's amassed through the years.\n\nRelated: Barbra Streisand's Net Worth Revealed\n\nHow did Kylie Minogue become famous?\n\nKylie Minogue was born on May 28, 1968, and raised in various suburbs of Melbourne, Australia, with her younger siblings (sister Danielle \"Dannii\" Minogue, also a singer, and brother Brendan Minogue, who works in news broadcasting). She and Dannii took singing and dance lessons as children.\n\nKylie and Dannii got into show business as children, with Kylie nabbing a small role in the Aussie soap opera The Sullivans after Dannii was deemed too young for the part. She was cast in other soaps following The Sullivans, including The Henderson Kids, from which she was fired after a single season. She used that time to pursue music and began recording demos and performing live.\n\nIn 1986, Kylie became famous for her role of fan-favorite character Charlene Mitchell in the soap opera Neighbours, which was a hit both in Australia and the U.K. Her popularity on the show led her to do more public appearances, including a benefit concert in which she performed the 1962 pop classic \"The Loco-Motion.\"\n\nIn 1987, she was signed to her first record deal, releasing a more modern (for then!) cover of the track, retitled \"Locomotion.\" The song's debut coincided with the premiere of a 1987 episode of Neighbours in which her character Charlene gets married. A star was born, and \"Locomotion\" was the best-selling single of the entire decade in Australia. Her debut album, Kylie, was released in 1988, and was one of the best-selling of the year in Australia and the U.K. and was certified gold in the United States.\n\nKylie quickly got to work on her sophomore album, Enjoy Yourself, which bowed in October 1989 and sold well. By the time her third album, Rhythm of Love, came out, Kylie wanted a more mature sound and image. It didn't perform as well as its predecessors commercially, but was critically lauded. Her fourth record, Let's Get to It, was still successful, but significantly less acclaimed and sold less than her prior work.\n\nBy 1992, Kylie released her first Greatest Hits album, then left her label, later staying she was stifled creatively. She signed with a new imprint, Deconstruction Records, and was given more freedom to experiment. It worked: Her fifth album, Kylie Minogue, was a hit commercially and critically, sending her star soaring higher than ever. She began appearing in movies stateside during this time, including as Cammy in the cult classic (but critically panned) Street Fighter adaptation and Bio-Dome.\n\nOver the next 30 years, Kylie would continue to cement her legacy as a pop icon, especially in the gay community. Her later-career success was propelled largely by her 2001 smash \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" and its album, Fever, both of which are considered pop canon.\n\nIn September 2023, her album Tension and single \"Padam Padam\" were released to critical acclaim and commercial success, the latter of which won her a Grammy for Best Pop Dance Recording.\n\nRelated: Selena Gomez's Net Worth\n\nWhat is Kylie Minogue's net worth in 2024?\n\nKylie Minogue's net worth in 2024 is estimated at a whopping $120 million. After a career spanning more than 40 years in front of the camera, on stage and in the studio, it's hard-earned!\n\nPart of why Minogue is so wealthy is how fiercely she protects her image. She famously blocked Kylie Jenner from trademarking the first name \"Kylie.\" Minogue later explained on Watch What Happens Live! With Andy Cohen, \"I've spent a lifetime protecting my brand and building my brand, so it was just something that had to be done ... But let me also say we came to an agreement.\"\n\nRelated: Kylie Jenner's Net Worth Is Lower Than She Wants You to Believe\n\nHow much money is Kylie Minogue worth?\n\nMinogue is worth an estimated $120 million. Not bad for the best-selling Australian solo artist of all time!\n\nHow much does Kylie Minogue make?\n\nMinogue's specific earnings aren't publicly known, but if we average it out based on her net worth, she's earned roughly $3 million per year since she became a star.\n\nHow much is Kylie paid for Las Vegas?\n\nAccording to The Mirror, Minogue's payday for her Las Vegas residency may be as high as $120 million. The figure may be even higher, The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported, because she sold out her performances so fast that she had to add dates before the shows even began.\n\nShe told Rolling Stone of her choice to start a residency, \"I was thinking years ago, I want to do it when I'm younger, not when I'm at the sunset of my career.\"\n\nRelated: Britney Spears' Net Worth and Las Vegas Residency Earnings\n\nHow much did Kylie Minogue get paid for San Andreas?\n\nIt's unknown how much Minogue made for her blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo as a wretched woman who falls from a window in San Andreas. The film's star, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, said he begged for her not to die in the movie."
