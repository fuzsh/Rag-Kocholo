        "text": "Kylie Minogue first achieved fame in her role in the television soap opera, \"Neighbours.\" She began her musical career in 1987, signing a contract with British songwriting trio Stock Aitken Waterman, after her first single \"The Loco-Motion\" was hugely successful, becoming the highest-selling single of the decade in Australia. \"I Should Be So Lucky\" was Kylie's breakout hit in 1988 and remains a pop classic.\n\nIn 1992 she left Stock Aitken Waterman, choosing to go it alone and establish herself as a performer in her own right. In 1994 she collaborated with Nick Cave on the song \"Where the Wild Roses Grow\" which garnered artistic credibility for Kylie, as she moved away from her image as the \"girl next door\" pop star. In 2000 she returned to success with the singles \"Spinning Around\" and \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" which reached number one in over 40 countries. Through her album \"Fever\" (2001) she broke into the American market, which had before alluded her. This release led to achieving four ARIA airways as well as two Brit Awards for Best International Female Solo Artist and Best International Album.\n\nThroughout her career, Kylie Minogue has developed and evolved her music to a more mature, dance orientated sound incorporating electronica, disco and R & B influences. Whilst attempting to establish herself as a more serious artist, she has always maintained a sense of joy and fun within her music, which has helped her become such a treasured star in Australia and her adopted home in the UK.\n\nIn the middle of a tour in 2005, Kylie Minogue was diagnosed with breast cancer, which forced her to cancel the tour. Thankfully, she successfully combatted the disease, allowing her to continue producing brilliant music. Following her illness, Minogue became an important figure in raising awareness and support of health research as well as humanitarian issues around the world. Her contributions were acknowledged through an honorary doctorate degree from Anglia Ruskin University as well as being appointed as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).\n\nKylie Minogue has featured as a judge on BBC One's talent competition, \"The Voice\" for the first season and the third season of Australia's version of the show. She also released her 12th studio album in March 2014, titled \"Kiss Me Once\" which reached number one in the Australian charts and number two in the UK."
