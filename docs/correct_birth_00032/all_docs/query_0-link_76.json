        "text": "Original Kylie Minogue posters for the ’Goddess of Pop’. Her sexy image and catchy’ dance-oriented pop tunes have resulted in sales of more than 80 million records worldwide and is recorded to be the highest-selling Australian artist of all time by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).\n\nKylie Ann Minogue born 28 May 1968, also known simply as Kylie, is an Australian singer and actress. Minogue is the highest-selling female Australian artist of all time, having sold over 70 million records worldwide. She has been recognised for reinventing herself in music and fashion, for which she is referred to by the European press as the \"Princess of Pop\" and a style icon. Her accolades include a Grammy Award, three Brit Awards and 17 ARIA Music Awards.\n\nKylie Minogue posters was born and raised in Melbourne and achieved recognition starring in the Australian soap opera Neighbours, playing tomboy mechanic Charlene Robinson. She gained prominence as a recording artist in the late 1980s and released four bubblegum and dance-pop-influenced studio albums produced by Stock Aitken Waterman.\n\nBy the early 1990s, she had amassed several top ten singles in the UK and Australia, including \"I Should Be So Lucky\", \"The Loco-Motion\", \"Hand on Your Heart\", and \"Better the Devil You Know\". Taking more creative control over her music, Minogue signed with Deconstruction Records in 1993 and released Kylie Minogue (1994) and Impossible Princess (1997), both of which received positive reviews.\n\nShe returned to mainstream dance-oriented music with 2000's Light Years, including the number-one hits \"Spinning Around\" and \"On a Night Like This\". The follow-up, Fever (2001), was an international breakthrough for Minogue, becoming her best-selling album to date. Two of its singles, \"Love at First Sight\" and \"In Your Eyes\", became hits, but its lead single, \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" became one of the most successful singles of the 2000s, selling over five million units.\n\nMinogue continued reinventing her image and experimenting with a range of genres on her subsequent albums, which spawned successful singles such as \"Slow\", \"2 Hearts\", \"All the Lovers\", \"Santa Baby\", \"Timebomb\" and \"Dancing\". With her 2020 album Disco, she became the first female artist to have a chart-topping album in the UK for five consecutive decades.\n\nMinogue made her film debut in The Delinquents (1989) and portrayed Cammy in Street Fighter (1994). She has also appeared in the films Moulin Rouge! (2001), Jack & Diane, Holy Motors (2012) and San Andreas (2015). In 2014, she appeared as a judge on the third series of The Voice UK and The Voice Australia. Her other ventures include product endorsements, children's books, fashion, and charitable work.\n\nMinogue was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 2008 New Year Honours for services to music. She was appointed by the French government as a Chevalier (knight) of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for her contribution to the enrichment of French culture. In 2005, while Minogue was on tour, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She was awarded an honorary Doctor of Health Science (D.H.Sc.) degree by Anglia Ruskin University in 2011 for her work in raising awareness for breast cancer. At the 2011 ARIA Music Awards, she was inducted by the Australian Recording Industry Association into the ARIA Hall of Fame.\n\nll of our Kylie Minogue posters are 100% original and exclusive to the Original Poster Shop."
