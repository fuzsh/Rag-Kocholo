        "text": "Michael Gudinski was the first to admit he didn’t know everything. Selling watermelons was one thing he had little expertise in.\n\nAs a youngster, Gudinski and his friend Ray Evans hit on a business idea at the Sunbury Rock Festival.\n\nGudinski was stage manager of the now-iconic early Seventies fest, and manager of several bands on the bill. Evans, he told this reporter in 2010, “came up with the idea of a watermelon concession, just truck in the fuckers, cut them in half.” All good, until the third year when “it pissed down and we got stuck with one thousand watermelons. It sort of ended in tears.”\n\nThe tears dried, and lessons were learned. “Sunbury was a great thing to be involved with. It confirmed my belief that Australian music could stand up. The first two years were run with all Australian acts.”\n\nGudinski was done selling melons. Over the following four decades, the late Melbourne entrepreneur would build the Mushroom Group, a sprawling, independent music empire quite like nothing else in Australia, or anywhere.\n\n“We try to keep most of our investments in the music business where we know them,” Gudinski would go on to say.\n\nGudinski, or MG as he was widely known, had cut his teeth running dance parties throughout his hometown as a teen, before forming Mushroom Records with Evans in 1972. MG was just twenty at the time. Touring arms would mushroom from it. And later, the label signed Skyhooks, a band Gudinski was guiding as manager (at the time, he was younger than all its members). The sky was the limit.\n\nWhen Gudinski passed in 2021, aged sixty-eight, the company he created was active in every conceivable area of music, from concerts and touring, publishing, agencies, merchandise, neighbouring rights, film and TV, creative services and, of course, labels. Frontier Touring is a juggernaut, recognised at times as the world’s leading independent concert promoter, and the engine room for Ed Sheeran’s Divide Tour of 2018, the all-time box office blockbuster with more than one million tickets sold.\n\nIf business is about buying, selling and playing in that space between, Gudinski was acutely aware that sometimes an offer is too good to refuse. In the Nineties, MG sold Mushroom Records to Rupert Murdoch’s News Ltd (now News Corporation), in a two-part arrangement that has been branded in music industry circles as the “deal of the century.” After selling up, “I probably went through postnatal sale depression, which is a unique Gudinski title,” he told this reporter. “I went through a period when I was a bit disillusioned, I had a lot of money.” And he reinvested a lot of that money into the business.\n\nWhen the pandemic stopped touring, along with regular life as we knew it, Gudinski didn’t back away from the challenge. He hit the phones, got business done. The Mushroom Group Chairman organised Music From The Home Front, a virtual Anzac Day concert on the free-to-air commercial Nine Network, featuring more than fifty music stars from both sides of the Tasman. And from it, the Music From The Home Front triple-vinyl set, just the second release of that scope to be issued in Australia via Mushroom, following the live Sunbury album.\n\nThe Home Front set blasted to Number One on the ARIA Albums Chart, with one hundred percent of its profits funnelled into music industry charity Support Act.\n\nHe wasn’t done there. Through a partnership with the Victorian Government’s Victoria Together initiative, MG pulled the trigger on The State of Music, a multi-part streaming series focusing on homegrown talent; and he launched The Sound, produced by Mushroom Vision and running across multiple seasons on the ABC. “This is not about my labels,” Gudinski told this reporter in late 2020. “This is about Australian music.”\n\nGudinski’s death was a shock that resonated around the globe. The stars came out to pay tribute to the legendary music man, an extraordinary list that included Paul McCartney, Dave Grohl, Bruce Springsteen and, of course, his close friend Sheeran. The “Shape of You” singer made the long-haul trip to Gudinski’s state memorial, where he performed a freshly-penned tribute to his friend, “Visiting Hours”. Two of MG’s close friends and artist signings, Kylie Minogue and Jimmy Barnes, performed backing vocals on the final cut.\n\nIn 2023, Mushroom Group will celebrate its 50th anniversary. Celebrations are shaping up under CEO Matt Gudinski, MG’s son, who says the company’s two hundred staff, former employees and friends will be at the heart of those plans. MG is no longer there, though his spirit remains across the group he built. A permanent statue of MG stands outside Rod Laver Arena, with the chairman giving his familiar one-finger salute: Number One forever.\n\nWords by Lars Brandle\n\nThe reports of music sales charts dying a sad, ignominious death, have been greatly exaggerated.\n\nCharts, those periodical gauges of popularity, aren’t for everyone. Though, for as long as records have been pressed and released out into the public, charts have given us a glimpse at what’s hitting, what’s missing, what’s flying and what’s dying.\n\nCharts are essential kit for the record business, and their partners in retail. And promoters, whose gamble is based on whether their act is popular enough to sell tickets.\n\nArtists watch the charts, though few will admit to it. When Pnau’s collaboration with Elton John on Good Morning to the Night was about to rule the UK chart back in 2012, the lads received a wake-up call from the Rocket Man himself. “Elton was calling us up at 3am going, ‘why the fuck aren’t you awake?’. We’re going Number One’,” Pnau’s Peter Mayes recounts.\n\nAnd yes, charts are loved the world over by anoraks; geeks plugged into this never-ending popularity contest.\n\n2023 marks the 40th anniversary of the ARIA Charts. The peak body published its first survey — then the Countdown Chart — on July 10, 1983. For the first five years, David Kent, who’d published his own Kent Music Report, was tapped to track sales for the new, official tallies.\n\nThe first singles chart was topped by Bonnie Tyler’s “Total Eclipse Of The Heart”, whose music video was directed by Australian filmmaker Russell Mulcahy. And the biggest album of them all was the first Number One on the ARIA albums survey, Michael Jackson’s Thriller.\n\nWhen ARIA began tackling those charts in-house from 1988, few record stores even had fax machines. Forms would be mailed out a week in advance, then, on one-frenetic day each week, the four chart staff would call the shops and key it in. The process was anything but scientific, and “Chart Day” would run deep into the night.\n\nFast forward four decades, and all the sales and streaming data is carried online.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, ARIA’s charts carried data from a couple of hundred shops, were manually punched in; today, its system ingests information from over one thousand outlets, a mix of physical and digital data, including streams from the most popular DSPs. All but one of the charts are based on sales and consumption data, the exception being the ARIA Club Chart, which collates reports submitted by professional DJs.\n\nAs tastes change, and music finds new means of transport, ARIA’s suite of charts continue to evolve. Downloads, and then streams, were rolled into the mix. More recently, in June 2022, the trade body published its New Release Chart for the first time, a weekly examination of the most popular new local and international singles on a four-month cycle.\n\nOne of the most profound changes, for those of us who like to get the news early, came when the singles and albums charts were moved forward by a full twenty-four hours back in March 2021. And with that move, ARIA’s two main surveys became the first published in the global cycle, beating the UK’s charts by several hours.\n\nIf you don’t work in music, but you get worked up by charts, the proof of indomitable hits, the slow-burners, the flops, you’re not alone.\n\nWords by Lars Brandle\n\n1992 was a heady year in Australia.\n\nWe had come through the recession we had to have, ABC debuted two bananas wearing pyjamas, Queensland voted against daylight saving, the Prime Minister earned himself the moniker of ‘the Lizard of Oz’ after touching the back of the monarch and, significantly, Australian music changed forever. And it was kind of accidental.\n\nWhat began as a Violent Femmes tour with a little known grunge band from Seattle, grew a bit — sort of by design, sort of by accident.\n\nTwo mates, Viv Lees and Ken West, who bonded over community service pulling down gig posters — a punishment for putting up gig posters — were touring Violent Femmes to Australia and booked a band called Nirvana as the support so they could play bigger rooms.\n\nUnbeknownst to Lees, West — inspired by US festival SummerFest — kept adding things to the Violent Femmes show at Hordern Pavilion in Sydney. He put a skate ramp in the forecourt and booked a few darlings of the Aussie alternative scene — You Am I and Yothu Yindi among them. A regular gig was turning into something much bigger.\n\nAs more bands heard about what was happening, West kept adding more acts. Eventually, the Violent Femmes became Kenfest (and then Big Day Out at the last minute) with twenty-one acts playing across three stages over twelve hours. A great theory — one that has been emulated by festival promoters for decades since — the only problem was, tickets weren’t moving.\n\nIn fortuitous serendipity, the band that was booked to play the support slot had been cooking up a new album. Their debut effort, Bleach, had been a middling success — reaching eighty-nine on the Billboard 100. But their follow up, Nevermind, and its debut single “Smells Like Teen Spirit”, turned the world upside down. Alternative was mainstream and everyone wanted to hear Nirvana play.\n\nThe idea that almost flopped in the most spectacular fashion had become the hottest ticket in town.\n\nOn the back of the success of year one, Big Day Out expanded to Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth the following year and added the Gold Coast and Auckland in 1994. What began as a regular gig at the Hordern eventually expanded to a multi-city festival with up to eight stages bringing the biggest acts in the world to Australia and introducing fans to the music they would love for the rest of the year.\n\nHistory will remember Big Day Out for many things, but January 25, 1992 will forever be the day the hottest band in the world played the middle slot at an unknown music festival in Sydney — changing the course of music festivals in this country forever and, for the longest time, providing the blueprint for future festivals to live up to.\n\nAnd, perhaps most importantly, it gave about 9,500 punters a chance to say, ‘I was there when…’\n\nWords by Nathanael Cooper\n\nIf you weren’t of a certain age at the time it’s hard to explain the importance of Countdown. Sure, you can watch old episodes and read books about it — chiefly Peter Wilmoth’s wonderful Glad All Over — but you had to really be part of the Countdown generation to get the total impact and power of that ABC music’n’chat television show, which really did stop a nation every Sunday evening between 1974 and 1987.\n\nAt 6pm the youth of Australia paused whatever they were doing, gathered around the television and waited for the words “COUNTDOWN… and tonight with your host Mollyyyyyyyyy Meldrum.” Then you would sit transfixed to see whose videos had made it, who was performing live, how many times Molly would say ‘um’ and ‘er’ and ‘do yourself a favour’. You would hate some artists and love others — but you would be glued to this fast paced, often train-wreck, hour of television. If you happened — heaven forbid — to miss a show, the first thing you’d ask at school the next morning was, “Who was on Countdown last night?”\n\nThis show was the most powerful medium for popular music in the country. Prince Charles came on for an interview with Molly, Cold Chisel trashed the set at the conclusion of a performance at the Countdown Awards, Molly had exclusives with everyone. Often the conversations with Rod, or Elton or whoever it was that week, made virtually no sense; but you watched, you listened, you paid attention. Record labels would do anything — literally — to get their peeps on the show, which really came of age during the transition from black and white to colour television in this country in October 1974. Wonder why Australian artists became so visually orientated with their live shows? They had to embrace all the colour and visual aspects of performance for Countdown and colour broadcasts — and then they took it to the pubs and then to the world.\n\nEventually Countdown came to an end. There were other music television shows of course — including the all-conquering MTV which arrived on Australian screens in April 1987. The ABC tried (and for a time partially succeeded with) The Countdown Revolution, best remembered for the time that hosts Mark Little and Tania Lacy went on strike while live-to-air on June 22, 1990 over all sorts of issues, most notably the policy of not allowing artists to perform live and insisting they mime to backing tracks. But really, no one remembers this version of Countdown. Not at all.\n\nCountdown was Molly Meldrum mumbling and stumbling, often ‘tired and emotional’, through the half hour show and world exclusive ‘interviews’. We remember the deluge of ABBA, John Paul Young (aka Squeak) as co-host, Iggy Pop calling Molly ‘dogface’, and the spats with Elton and Rod — all of that. Countdown was of a time and place. Never again will one television show carry that much weight, power and influence. Stars were made on Sunday evenings in that thirty minutes of glorious mayhem. Never before, and certainly never again, has the most important issue of the day been who was on a pop music TV show the previous evening.\n\nWords by Stuart Coupe\n\nDespite over forty thousand years of rich history, Indigenous Australian music existed outside the colonial consciousness until 1991. The fight for First Nations artists to break through gathered pace in the Eighties, as artists like Warumpi Band and Coloured Stone signed significant record deals. But it wasn’t until Yothu Yindi smashed through the barriers with their groundbreaking single “Treaty” that mainstream Australia began to embrace, and celebrate, First Nations music.\n\nIn 1988, then Prime Minister Bob Hawke was presented with The Barunga Statement from members of the Yolngu nation. The statement included demands for a treaty with First Nations people, which Hawke responded to with a promise to implement by 1990.\n\nAt the time, Yothu Yindi, formed by Yolngu and balanda (non-Indigenous) members, were on the rise, with their big break coming with an invitation to tour with Midnight Oil through the US in 1988. Signing with Mushroom Records upon their return, they released their debut album, Homeland Movement, in 1989.\n\n“Treaty” was written by the band, along with Paul Kelly, in response to the 1990 deadline approaching with no action from the government — creating a powerful musical statement. The song was released to little fanfare, until being remixed by Melbourne duo Filthy Lucre; who took elements of the largely rock-based tune and turned it into a dancefloor smash.\n\nThe track broke new ground, becoming the first song with English and Yolngu lyrics to hit the ARIA Charts, peaking at Number Eleven. The video depicted the band members’ traditional dance and culture, giving non-Indigenous Australia a unique window into the world of remote First Nations communities.\n\nThe album Tribal Voice was released later that year, becoming a Top Five hit and breaking ground in the US, where they signed to Hollywood Records and peaked at Number Three on the Billboard World Music chart.\n\n“Treaty” was voted Song of the Year at the 1991 APRA Awards, received the Human Rights Commission’s Award for both Songwriting and Record of the Year, and Best Australian Single at the ARIA Awards. The video won Best Australian Video at the Australian Music Awards and the MTV International Awards. Singer Dr M. Yunupingu was honoured with the title of Australian of the Year in 1993 based on the significance of the band’s historical achievements.\n\nYothu Yindi’s legacy continued with many more albums, while the band’s record for highest-selling Indigenous album was eventually broken by Yothu Yindi member Gurrumul’s 2008 eponymous solo album, continuing the strong Yolgnu influence on Australian music.\n\nIn 2009 “Treaty” was added to the National Film and Sound Archive’s Sounds of Australia registry for historically important works.\n\nIn 2022, with artists like The Kid LAROI, Baker Boy and Jessica Mauboy now staples on radio airwaves, it’s impossible to downplay the significance of “Treaty” in normalising Black voices and stories in mainstream music. We are no further on our journey towards treaty, and the unfair burdens still being carried by today’s First Nations artists are significant. Despite this, the success of contemporary First Nations talent would not be possible without the doors, and minds, that were opened by Yothu Yindi.\n\nWords by Stephen Green\n\nHelen Reddy’s 1970s track “I Am Woman” helped redefine how women could be talked about and — more importantly — how they could talk about, and express, themselves.\n\nReddy said she wrote it because she felt she had to — there were no empowering songs that accurately reflected the grit, determination and strength of the women she knew.\n\nInstead, the songs about womanhood that she was exposed to were about being pretty, or about being deservedly downtrodden.\n\nWomen needed to be heard, and the opening lyrics “I am woman, hear me roar, in numbers too big to ignore” inspired a movement and a moment.\n\nNow in 2022, with all that’s happened with women’s liberation — and all that still needs to be done — it seems obvious that a song with the lyrics “I am strong, I am invincible, I am woman”, would inspire a movement and continue to ignite passion today.\n\nIn reality though, the track wasn’t an immediate smash in the early 1970s when it was released. It was a long, slow roar, building a legacy over decades.\n\nThe song featured on Reddy’s debut album, but she believed it “was not hit-single material” and recalled that it got no immediate airplay.\n\nDespite the seeming lack of commercial success, Reddy would play it as the opening song at live shows and it was regularly referred to in fan mail.\n\nThen, it was used in the opening credits of Hollywood comedy Stand Up and Be Counted, and Reddy was asked to add more meat to the song so it could be released as a single.\n\nReddy started performing the track on television, and then the grit, determination and strength of the women it inspired finally got the track some airplay.\n\nYet still, it wasn’t enough.\n\n“I Am Woman” bounced in and out of the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the US between June and September 1972.\n\nFinally, in December of that year, it reached Number One, making it the first chart-topper for Capitol Records since Bobbie Gentry’s 1967 hit “Ode to Billie Joe”. It was also the first US Number One from an Australian-born artist.\n\nAnd in 1973, Reddy was awarded a Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, again another trailblazing moment as she was the first Australian to do so.\n\nFamously, although not uncommon at award ceremonies, Reddy took the time to thank God. Her stint on stage stands out, however, for her use of the female pronoun when referencing the deity, noting “I would like to thank God, because she makes everything possible.”\n\nDespite its legacy, perhaps it’s lucky that Reddy was unaware the impact the song would have.\n\n“I had no idea what the song was destined to become,” she said in the early Noughties. “If I’d known, I would have been far too intimidated to have written it.”\n\nWell, thank the (female) God that she did.\n\nWords by Vivienne Kelly"
