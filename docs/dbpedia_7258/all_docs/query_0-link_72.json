        "text": "Fraud in the UK today\n\nFraud is the most common crime in this country today. An adult aged 16 or over in England and Wales is more likely to become a victim of fraud than any other individual crime type.\n\nFigures show that Â£1.9 billion has been lost to fraud by individuals in the past year.\n\nDuring the pandemic, fraud grew by 25% as COVID-19 accelerated the shift towards digitalisation. More people relied on digital banking and online shopping during lockdown, and others turned to social media and dating apps to connect with others.\n\nAround 80% of fraud is cyber-enabled, which means that it involved technology, and social media features in thousands of fraud reports every year.\n\nDespite this worrying rise, just 1% of police resources are focussed on economic crime. The Governmentâs multi-agency approach to tackling fraud is spread across several departments, agencies and working groups, leading to a cluttered policymaking environment.\n\nOn top of this, some parts of the private sector are not effectively incentivised to tackle fraud and are not taking all the steps they could to prevent it.\n\nThe result of this is that criminals based anywhere in the world can exploit digital technologies with ease to defraud millions of unsuspecting victims in the UK.\n\nThey face little risk of being caught and being brought to justice.\n\nOur committee has set out six key priorities that the Government must act on to break the fraud chain.\n\n1. Create a Cabinet sub-committee\n\nThe counter-fraud policy landscape is made up of a mind-boggling variety of acronyms and an alphabet soup of responsible departments, taskforces and Ministers. This leads to inefficient policymaking and a lack of accountability.\n\nA cabinet sub-committee with a clear mandate to tackle fraud should be established, chaired by and accountable to the Security Minister.\n\nThe sub-committee should bring together more effectively all Secretaries of State who have a portfolio that spans fraud. To ensure transparency, its membership and terms of reference should be made public.\n\n2. Strategic Policing Requirement\n\nCurrently, just 1% of law enforcement is focussed on tackling economic crime. Digital investigation remains outside the capacity of mainstream policing and the organisational structure for policing fraud is complex and confusing.\n\nTo tackle under-prioritisation, fraud should be written into the Strategic Policing Requirement.\n\n3. New criminal offences\n\nThere are several sectors involved in the fraud chain, but not all face the same incentives to tackle the problem. Until all fraud-enabling industries fear significant financial, legal and reputational risk for their failure to prevent fraud, they will not act.\n\nTo inspire behaviour change, we call on the Government to introduce a new corporate criminal offence of 'failure to prevent fraud', accompanied by significant financial penalties, to hold corporates across all sectors to account.\n\nThe Government must make it clear that a range of other measures, such as director disqualification, are ready to be enforced if culture change is not forthcoming.\n\n4. A consumer awareness campaign\n\nThere remains no national public awareness campaign to provide help and support for the general public on how to protect themselves against fraud, and to educate them on how it can be reported.\n\nThis creates confusion on what advice to follow, as well as a lack of clarity for victims, which can lead to under-reporting.\n\nThe Government should oversee the introduction of a single, centrally funded consumer awareness campaign in partnership with industry.\n\nThis should align with the priorities established in the forthcoming Fraud Strategy and should provide clear guidance on how fraud can be reported.\n\n5. Slow down banking payments\n\nThe UK has one of the most advanced digital banking systems in the world. While beneficial for businesses and consumers at large, this makes the UK a lucrative market for fraudsters looking to cash out stolen funds quickly and easily.\n\nTo stop fraudulent payments slipping through the net, the speed with which certain payments can be made should be subject to a delay lasting no more than several hours. This might include high-value payments made by personal customers to new payees, with an option to extend this to existing payees in the case of high-value payments.\n\nThe Payment Systems Regulator should consult with industry on the introduction of such a measure and the value threshold to be set. Implementation of this measure must not impact the application of other measures such as AI-assisted transaction monitoring.\n\n6. Reintroduce the Online Safety Bill\n\nThe Online Safety Bill contains several important measures to prevent fraudulent content and scam advertising from appearing on online platforms and to hold tech companies accountable when they fail.\n\nIt must be brought forward urgently."
