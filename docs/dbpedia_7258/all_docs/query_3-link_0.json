It follows a team of detectives from Friday Street police station, a division of the Manchester Metropolitan Police (a fictional version of the Greater Manchester Police). The series stars Joanna Scanlan as the protagonist, Detective Inspector Viv Deering. The first series focuses on the team's investigation into the serial murders of young girls with Down syndrome.[1][2] It was renewed for two further runs.[3] The second series of seven episodes began broadcasting on 4 January 2017, and follows the investigation into Manchester crime boss Nora Attah (Rakie Ayola). It was filmed on location in Manchester.[4][5]\n\nIn the UK, the first episode of No Offence launched with 2.5 million viewers, Channel 4's biggest midweek drama launch for more than three years. Although subsequent episodes lost overnight viewers, dropping as low as 1.2 million, the weekly consolidated series average remained at 2.5 million and finished 47% up on Channel 4's slot average.[6] In France, the first episode of No Offence aired on 29 February 2016 on France 2 and was watched by 5.46 million viewers, 20.4% of the TV audience. The next three episodes were shown back-to-back that evening and together achieved an average 4.6 million viewers, 19.3% of the TV audience.[7]\n\nA third series was confirmed in July 2017.[8] Filming took place in Manchester in March 2018[9] and it began broadcasting on 13 September 2018. The six-episode series has a political focus, with the main storyline following the attempted murder of a local politician by a far right group. On 19 October 2018, Paul Abbott stated in an interview that he had begun working on ideas for a potential fourth series,[10] but on 28 November 2019, Executive Producer Martin Carr confirmed on Twitter that the show would not be returning.[11][12][13]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the first series, DI Viv Deering is introduced as the dynamic but blunt leader of a team of detectives at a fictional police station within the 'Manchester Metropolitan Police'. DC Dinah Kowalska misses out on promotion to DS after leaving the scene after an impetuous foot chase results in a death. She then uncovers a link between a murder, a drowning and a disappearance: someone is killing girls with Down syndrome. While negotiating different cases, the team must solve the case as more girls come into danger. The prime suspect is killed whilst fleeing arrest, but Dinah and Viv separately conclude that Viv's husband is also involved. Viv burns the evidence and plans to kill rather than arrest him, but he is killed by Cathy while she and Dinah are holding him at Viv's home. With Viv they cover up their involvement before the body is found.[14]\n\nThe second series begins a little over a year later, as Viv returns after extended leave and attends a gang funeral, which is bombed despite the police presence.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nMain cast\n\n[edit]\n\nJoanna Scanlan as DI Vivenne Deering (Series 1–3)\n\nElaine Cassidy as DC (Series 1–2) then DS Dinah Kowalska (Series 3)\n\nAlexandra Roach as DS Joy Freers (Series 1–3)\n\nWill Mellor as DC Spike Tanner (Series 1–3)\n\nPaul Ritter as Randolph Miller (Series 1–3)\n\nColin Salmon as DSI Darren Maclaren (Series 1)\n\nSarah Solemani as DCI Christine Lickberg (Series 2)\n\nClaire Rushbrook as DCI Marilyn Marchant (Series 3)\n\nSaira Choudhry as PC Tegan Thompson (Series 1–3)\n\nTom Varey as PC Stuart O'Connell (Series 1–3)\n\nSte Johnson as PC Jonah Mitchell (Series 1–3)\n\nNeet Mohan as PC Taz Ahmed (Series 1–2)\n\nRecurring cast\n\n[edit]\n\nCharlie May-Clark as Cathy Calvert (Series 1–2)\n\nClaudia Adshead as Donna Calvert (Series 1–2)\n\nKate O'Flynn as Dr Peep (Series 1–3)\n\nConor MacNeill as Gavin (Series 2–3)\n\nChook Sibtain as Sgt.
