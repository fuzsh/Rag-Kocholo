        "text": "Investigating crimes, catching criminals and protecting the community is the police’s main job, but they also help victims and witnesses of crime.\n\nEven if you don’t report a crime as the victim, someone who saw what happened might do, so it’s likely that you will have to talk to police after a crime.\n\nIf you do report a crime the police will explain what will happen next. They should also give you the contact details of the police officer dealing with your case and a crime reference number. Make a note of this number somewhere safe – you will need it if you want to contact the police again about the incident, or if you want to make an insurance or compensation claim.\n\nGetting support\n\nWhen you report a crime the police should also ask you if you are happy for your details to be passed to Victim Support. If you say yes, we will automatically get your contact information and brief details about the crime. We’ll then contact you to see how we can help. If you don’t want us to contact you, tell the police officer. You can change your mind later and you can contact us directly at any time for help and support.\n\nMaking a statement\n\nOnce a crime has been reported, the police will start their investigation and try to find evidence. As the victim, they’ll need to talk to you and collect as much information as possible so that they can write up a statement. If you find it difficult or upsetting to talk to the police, you can ask for a break at any point.\n\nVictim Personal Statement\n\nAfter the interview, you will be asked to read the statement and check that it is correct. The police will then ask you to sign it. They should also give you the chance to make a separate Victim Personal Statement – this is your chance to say how the crime has affected you, and it will be taken into account during trial.\n\nGetting evidence\n\nThe police may also need to collect evidence from where the crime took place, such as photos or fingerprints. If you’ve been injured in a violent attack or suffered a sexual crime, the police will ask you whether you agree to have a medical examination. It’s your decision, but remember that this may be an opportunity to get forensic evidence that can help bring an attacker to justice.\n\nKeeping you informed"
