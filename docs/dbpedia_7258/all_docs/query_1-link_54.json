        "text": "At a glance\n\nThe UK GDPR gives extra protection to the personal data of offenders or suspected offenders in the context of criminal activity, allegations, investigations, and proceedings.\n\nIf you have official authority, you can process personal data about criminal convictions and offences, because you are processing the data in an official capacity.\n\nIf you do not have official authority, you can only process criminal offence data if you can identify a specific condition for processing in Schedule 1 of the DPA 2018.\n\nYou cannot keep a comprehensive register of criminal convictions, unless you do so in an official capacity.\n\nYou must determine your condition for processing criminal offence data, or identify your official authority for the processing, before you begin the processing, and you should document this.\n\nYou must still have a lawful basis for your processing under Article 6.\n\nIn many cases, you also need an ‘appropriate policy document’ in place in order to meet a UK Schedule 1 condition for processing in the DPA 2018.\n\nYou need to complete a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) for any type of processing which is likely to be high risk. You must therefore be aware of the risks of processing the criminal offence data.\n\nChecklist\n\nIn brief\n\nWhat is criminal offence data?\n\nWhat are the rules for criminal offence data?\n\nWhat are the Schedule 1 conditions for processing criminal offence data?\n\nIn more detail\n\nWhat is criminal offence data?\n\nThe UK GDPR gives extra protection to “personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures”. We refer to this as criminal offence data.\n\nThis covers a wide range of information about offenders or suspected offenders in the context of:\n\ncriminal activity;\n\nallegations;\n\ninvestigations; and\n\nproceedings.\n\nIt includes not just data which is obviously about a specific criminal conviction or trial, but may also include personal data about:\n\nunproven allegations; and\n\n• information relating to the absence of convictions.\n\nIt also covers a wide range of related security measures, including\n\npersonal data about penalties;\n\nconditions or restrictions placed on an individual as part of the criminal justice process; or\n\ncivil measures which may lead to a criminal penalty if not adhered to.\n\nIt does not cover information about other individuals, including victims and witnesses of crime. However, information about victims and witnesses is likely to be sensitive, and controllers should take particular care when processing it.\n\nWhat are the rules for criminal offence data?\n\nYou must always ensure that your processing is generally lawful, fair and transparent and complies with all the other principles and requirements of the UK GDPR. To ensure that your processing is lawful, you need to identify an Article 6 basis for processing.\n\nIn addition, you can only process criminal offence data if the processing is either:\n\nunder the control of official authority; or\n\nauthorised by domestic law. This means you need to meet one of the conditions in Schedule 1 of the DPA 2018.\n\nYou may only keep a comprehensive register of criminal convictions if this register is “under the control of official authority”.\n\nPublic bodies, or private bodies who are given public sector tasks, may have “official authority” to process criminal offence data. This official authority may derive from either common law or statute. If you are a public body, you must identify the specific law that gives you official authority to process criminal offence data.\n\nIf you do not have official authority for the processing, it must be authorised by domestic law. This authorisation in law is set out in the conditions listed in Schedule 1 of the DPA 2018.\n\nYou must also identify whether you need an “appropriate policy document” under the DPA 2018. Our template appropriate policy document shows the kind of information this should contain.\n\nYou must do a DPIA for any type of processing that is likely to be high risk. This means that you are more likely to need to do a DPIA for processing criminal offence data. For further information, please see our guidance on DPIAs.\n\nYou should also consider how the risks associated with criminal offence data affect your other obligations – in particular, obligations around data minimisation, security, transparency, and DPOs.\n\nWhat are the Schedule 1 conditions for processing criminal offence data?\n\nThe 28 conditions which are available for the processing of criminal offence data are set out in paragraphs 1 to 37 Schedule 1 of the DPA 2018:\n\nYou should identify which of these conditions appears to most closely reflect your purpose. Our detailed guidance gives you some further advice on how the conditions generally work, but you always need to refer to the detailed provisions of each condition in the legislation itself to make sure you can demonstrate it applies."
