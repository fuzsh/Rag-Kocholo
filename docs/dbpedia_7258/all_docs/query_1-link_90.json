        "text": "What is Joint Enterprise?\n\nJoint Enterprise is where, if one or more people commit an offence (the main offenders) and another/ others (secondary offenders) intended to encourage or assist them to commit the offence, the secondary offender(s) can be prosecuted as if they were a main offender.\n\nThis has resulted in bystanders, or people involved in much lesser criminal offences, being convicted of murder or manslaughter.\n\nWhat is the problem with joint enterprise?\n\nThousands of people are estimated to have been prosecuted under the joint enterprise doctrine. But we know that often, people are convicted under joint enterprise based on prejudicial evidence, information that could be inaccurate, or racial stereotypes.\n\nWeak ‘evidence’ that people are part of a ‘gang’ – including information about people’s associations, friends, families, use of social media, and even music preferences – has been used in joint enterprise prosecutions, particularly in those brought against of people of colour.\n\nThis relies on racist and inaccurate stereotypes about young people of colour being involved violence and other criminal activities, including ‘gang’ involvement.\n\nThe ongoing misuse of joint enterprise puts the right to a fair trial at risk, particularly for young people of colour.\n\nThe Lammy Review in 2017 highlighted the ways that joint enterprise leads to miscarriages of justice.\n\nWhat is the law on Joint enterprise?\n\nUntil 2016, the courts interpreted the law to mean that if two people set out to commit an offence, and in the course of doing so, one of them commits a different offence, the other person will also be guilty of that offence if they had foreseen the possibility that it might be committed.\n\nFor example, if two people set out to commit a robbery, but in the course of the robbery one of them pulls out a knife and commits a murder, the other party will be guilty of murder on a joint enterprise basis if he foresaw this as a possibility, but did not himself intend it.\n\nIn 2016, the Supreme Court reconsidered the joint enterprise doctrine, and said that the law had taken a ‘wrong turn’ and been misinterpreted.\n\nInstead, it said that a person will only be guilty of a joint enterprise offence if they intended to encourage or assist the person who committed the offence to do it.\n\nHowever, since 2016 the way that the law is used continues to be problematic.\n\nWho is likely to be prosecuted under joint enterprise?\n\nA number of different studies indicate that joint enterprise prosecutions are more likely to target young Black men and boys.\n\nOne study found that, of young male prisoners serving 15 years or more for joint enterprise convictions, 38.5% were White and 57.4% were BAME, and 38% Black.\n\nAnother study found that joint enterprise prisoners who identify as BAME were significantly younger than their white counterparts and were serving longer sentences on average.\n\nDespite these studies, neither the Crown Prosecution Service nor the Ministry of Justice records or monitors data about joint enterprise prosecutions – meaning there isn’t an official record of the ethnicity or age of those prosecuted under joint enterprise, or the outcomes of those prosecutions.\n\nThis means that racism in the system is going unrecorded, making it difficult for people to challenge and hold the state to account.\n\nWhat is Liberty’s legal case about?\n\nLiberty has threatened legal action against the Crown Prosecution Service and the Ministry of Justice on behalf of grassroots campaign group JENGbA (Joint Enterprise Not Guilty by Association) for failing to record this data.\n\nThis failure breaches their duties under the Equality Act 2010 to have due regard to eliminating race discrimination.\n\nWe are calling for the CPS and MoJ to record data on:\n\nThe number of joint enterprise prosecution brought for offences involving violence by area\n\nThe ethnicity and age of those prosecuted\n\nWhether any ‘gang’ evidence was relied on by the Crown in those cases\n\nAnd the outcomes of those prosecutions.\n\nMaking sure this data is recorded is the first step to ensuring that any race discrimination in the use of joint enterprise is no longer hidden from view, and that steps can be taken to eliminate it."
