        "text": "SALT LAKE CITY — Just after midnight Thursday, the state of Utah will conduct its first execution since 2010 when convicted murderer Taberon Honie is put to death.\n\nWATCH: Here's how Utah's first execution since 2010 will take place\n\nWhile the execution of Honie is set for the early morning hours, protocols are already underway at the Utah State Correctional Facility. FOX 13 News will continue to provide real-time updates on the execution throughout the day and evening.\n\n2:44 a.m.\n\nShortly after midnight, the curtain was drawn and Taberon Honie was seen strapped to a table with IVs in both arms.\n\nAt 12:03 a.m., he was asked if he had any final words. His demeanor was calm.\n\n\"From the start, it's been if it needs to be done for them to heal, let's do this,\" he said, referencing the victim's family. Then he appeared to address his fellow inmates.\n\n\"If they tell you, you can't change, don't listen to them. To all my brothers and sisters here, continue to change. I love you all. Take care.\"\n\nHonie's foot was twitching, apparently out of nervousness. He looked around the room and mouthed something to the prison's chief of operations and the warden. They told reporters Honie said \"thank you for taking care of my family\" and mouthed to his family witnessing the execution: \"I love you.\"\n\nHonie lifted his head up, appeared to take a deep exhaling breath. At first, his breathing appeared rapid, but quickly slowed. His skin turned pale, then blue.\n\nThe director of prison operations kept checking an EKG meter. Reporters were told later that two doses of pentobarbitol were administered with the second dose coming at 12:07 a.m.\n\nIt took 17 minutes before Honie was declared dead.\n\n10:37 p.m.\n\nTaberon Honie spoke to his attorneys until 10 p.m. The prison warden and operations chief then met with Honie and offered him a Valium. He declined to take it, UDC Communications Director Glen Mills told reporters.\n\nHonie is currently on his bed in an observation room, listening to music. The Utah Department of Corrections has not been informed of any last-minute legal challenges to halt the execution.\n\nI ask why midnight for an execution? It is a time when it would have the least impact on operations, Mills said. The prison is already in lockdown as people go to sleep.\n\nThis is the last scheduled update from the Utah State Prison until the execution is carried out.\n\n-Ben Winslow\n\n10:07 p.m.\n\nA group of anti-death-penalty protesters is now at the \"Free Speech Zone.\"\n\n-Emily Tencer\n\n9:54 p.m.\n\nCharles Rony, the first man who showed up at the designated \"Free Speech Zone\" outside the prison, is here on his own. He's not affiliated with any organization; some anti-death-penalty groups are planning to join later.\n\nRony says the death penalty is against his religious beliefs. He's holding a sign quoting John 8:7: \"Let him cast the first stone.\" He's originally from Haiti, which abolished the death penalty in 1987.\n\n\"Where I'm from, we don't have that. Even in a third world country, they consider death penalty as something barbaric,\" he said.\n\n-Emily Tencer\n\n9:42 p.m.\n\nAt another news conference, the Utah Dept. of Corrections updated preparations for the execution and what Taberon Honie is doing.\n\nThe final run through for execution preparations went smoothly, UDC Communications Director Glen Mills said.\n\n“We are highly confident in our plan to carry this out in an effective hours as we come into the final hours,\" he told reporters.\n\nHonie said goodbye to his family. There were lots of emotions and tears. One thing he was heard saying to his family members was “keep your heads up” and he cracked a few jokes, Mills said.\n\nHonie is now meeting with his attorneys. At 10 p.m., he will be alone in the cell. Then things will begin to proceed around 11:30 p.m.\n\n-Ben Winslow\n\n8:37 p.m.\n\nIn the past hour, Honie has continued to spend time with family members. In the observation room, a deputy warden has told him to prepare to say his final goodbyes before he is taken to the death chamber.\n\nA judge has also denied a request for an injunction surrounding the \"free speech zone\" where anti-death penalty protesters are allowed to gather, Corrections officials said. The zone is near I-80 and 7200 West. Demonstrators wanted to be closer to the prison, but were denied.\n\nHonie made two requests of the Utah Dept. of Corrections, which took place on Monday. A pipe and smudging ceremony. He has also requested a spiritual ceremony be performed with his remains. The agency has granted that request.\n\nSeven members of Claudia Benn's family will be present to witness the execution. They will not speak to the news media afterward, Corrections communications director Glen Mills said.\n\nA medical doctor will administer the fatal dose, he added.\n\n-Ben Winslow\n\n8:24 p.m.\n\nThe Cedar City judge who signed Honie's death warrant has denied a request to be available tonight \"if something goes wrong\" with the execution. Judge Jeffrey Wilcox said in a filing that Honie attorney Eric Zuckerman has not specified how the court could intervene or even have jurisdiction, so he would not entertain it.\n\n-Ben Winslow\n\n8:18 p.m.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Taberon Honie's daughter, Tressa Honie, spoke about being caught between anger and grief over the lethal injection execution. Her grandmother is Honie's victim. Her mother's family wants him put to death, but she has kept in touch with her father in prison.\n\n\"My mom's side, they can heal together,\" she said in an interview. \"I'm happy you guys are going to get this closure, this justice, but where does that leave me? I feel like I have to heal alone.\"\n\n7:34 p.m.\n\nUtah Dept. of Corrections communications director Glen Mills said Honie met previously with a Native American spiritual adviser who called him. The call consisted of \"prayers.\"\n\nCorrections officials conducted another \"run through\" of how the execution will go down, including preparing for scenarios of resistance and IV preparation.\n\nHonie continues to visit with family. At 6:40 p.m., he was notified that his attorneys were here. Honie declined to speak with them until later, opting to use all of his time with his family. At about 9 p.m., family visits will cease and he will meet with them. He can meet with attorneys or clergy up until 10 p.m. He has made no clergy requests.\n\nHe will be escorted into the death chamber around 11:30 p.m. If there is any resistance? Corrections officials will be prepared to take him in there.\n\n-Ben Winslow\n\n6:36 p.m.\n\nAt another news conference, Utah Dept. of Corrections provided an update:\n\nHonie has been visiting with his family, including his daughter, mother and father, sister, cousins, a brother-in-law and an aunt. They are speaking through a barrier. There is no time limits to the visits.\n\nHe has also received another mental health check, which evaluates his mood on how he is feeling. His mood has been described as \"gracious and appreciative\" for being able to visit his family.\n\nThe Utah Dept. of Corrections said it will do another \"run through\" of the execution tonight to make sure they do it \"safely, humanely and appropriately.\" They have done at least five run throughs.\n\nCorrections communications director Glen Mills confirmed the agency has three doses of pentobarbital, in case the initial dose does not kill Honie.\n\nHow is the mood at the prison? For inmates, it varies based on those who knew it. For staff? No one takes joy in this, but they have a responsibility to carry it out \"in a professional manner.\"\n\nHonie had a call with a spiritual leader yesterday. He requested that person and the phone call was \"quite a long time.\"\n\n-Ben Winslow\n\n5:42 p.m.\n\nIn their first news conference as Honie nears the time he will be executed, the Utah Department of Corrections offered updates:\n\nHonie was taken to an observation room at 6:09 a.m. He slept for about two hours until about 8:15 a.m. Honie ate a breakfast sandwich. He was offered a tablet to allow him to watch movies, but he chose not to do that. He has instead, been busy with visitors.\n\nHe had a visit with his mother and father. Since that time, in numbers of twos, family members have been switching out and meeting with Honie. He had a chance to meet with the warden and three mental health checks have been made.\n\nHonie's last meal was delivered around 4:30 p.m. It was a cheeseburger, fries and a milkshake. He conveyed through Corrections officials that he wanted his last meal to be remembered as one with his family.\n\nHis mood has been described by Corrections officials as “gracious and appreciative throughout the day.”\n\n-Ben Winslow\n\n4:51 p.m.\n\nAs a young reporter living in Cedar City in 1998, I covered the murder of Claudia Benn. It was a gruesome crime. Taberon Honie was accused of breaking into her home through a sliding glass door. Iron County prosecutors said Benn tried to protect herself by grabbing a butcher knife. Police said he turned the knife on her, slit her throat and then sexually assaulted her with it.\n\nBenn's three grandchildren (including Honie's daughter, who was two at the time) were in the home and prosecutors said they witnessed the murder. Honie was also accused of molesting one of the children. He was convicted and sentenced to death.\n\nIt is interesting to be here at the Utah State Prison all these years later where I am to witness his scheduled execution.\n\n-Ben Winslow\n\n4:32 p.m.\n\nThe road to the Utah State Prison in Salt Lake City is now closed. A Free Speech Zone has been established for Wednesday evening at 7800 W 700 N. Protesters need to access it via 5600 W since 8000 W will be closed. This area will be open from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. Thursday.\n\n-Ben Winslow\n\n1:45 p.m.\n\nRestoring Ancestral Winds, a Native American advocacy organization, has issued a statement on Taberon Honie's execution calling attention to the life of his victim, Claudia Benn.\n\n“Today we honor the life of Claudia Benn, a member of the Paiute tribe and bring the issue of the missing and murdered Indigenous relatives in Utah. Domestic violence and sexual assault are often a precursor to murder.” said Yolanda Francisco, Executive Director of Restoring Ancestral Winds Inc. “Claudia should still be here to enjoy a life filled with joy and safety. She deserved to live in peace like all Utah citizens.”\n\nWe say, “NEVER AGAIN!”\n\nThe full statement is here:\n\n-Ben Winslow\n\n11 a.m.\n\nAn anti-death penalty group has gathered on the steps of the Cathedral of the Madeleine in Salt Lake City to protest the execution of Honie, ahead of asking Gov. Spencer Cox it off, despite him having no power to do so.\n\nVideo below features speakers protesting Honie's execution:\n\nDeath Penalty Protest\n\n-Jeff Tavss\n\n8:30 a.m.\n\nHonie has been moved to an observation cell, which is the first step in the execution process.\n\n-Jeff Tavss\n\n8:00 a.m.\n\nThe Salt Lake City and Gunnison prisons have been placed in lockdown, which is protocol for executions in the state."
