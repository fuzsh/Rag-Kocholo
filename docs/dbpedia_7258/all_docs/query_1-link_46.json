        "text": "Different levels of check and disclosures\n\nAn AccessNI check is a criminal history record check which provides different levels of information about you. There are three levels of check:\n\na basic check contains details of all convictions considered to be unspent\n\na standard check contains details of all spent and unspent convictions, informed warnings, cautions and diversionary youth conferences\n\nan enhanced check contains the same information as a standard check and police records held locally - to work with children and vulnerable adults, the check may include information held by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS)\n\nPenalties and fines excluded from checks\n\nA criminal record check doesn't include:\n\na fixed penalty charge\n\na parking fine\n\nsome motoring offences\n\na fine for not having a TV licence\n\nTypes of criminal record information\n\nConviction\n\nIf you’re prosecuted for an offence in court and found guilty, you have a conviction for that offence.\n\nYou might receive:\n\na discharge\n\na fine\n\na prison sentence (including a suspended sentence)\n\ncommunity service or other penalty\n\nSpent and unspent convictions\n\nIf you're still in your rehabilitation period following a criminal conviction, your conviction is unspent. Any custodial sentence over two and a half years stays unspent.\n\nIf you were found guilty of a criminal offence by a court, following the specified time-period, your conviction will be considered “spent”. The specified time is the rehabilitation period.\n\nCautions, diversionary youth conference plans and informed warnings are automatically spent.\n\nAn AccessNI basic check doesn't include spent convictions.\n\nOther ways offences can be treated\n\nOffences can be treated in different ways. These are sometimes called non-court disposals or diversionary disposals.\n\nCaution\n\nIf you admit an offence, the police can give you a caution. A caution is not a conviction. A caution is a warning which is subject to disclosure for six years if you’re an adult, or two years if you’re under 18, unless it is for a specified offence.\n\nDiversionary youth conference\n\nIf an offender under 18 admits guilt, they can agree to a diversionary youth conference. They and their parent or guardian go to several meetings that might divert the young person from criminal behaviour. The diversionary conference is subject to disclosure for two years after the date accepted, unless it is for a specified offence.\n\nInformed warning\n\nIf you admit an offence, the police can give you an informed warning without going to court. A warning is not a conviction. It is subject to disclosure for 12 months, unless it is for a specified offence. This applies to both adults and young people under 18 years old.\n\nRelevant police information\n\nAn enhanced check can disclose non-conviction information or 'soft intelligence’ if the police believe it's relevant to the role you’re applying for and that it should to be disclosed. This could be:\n\nan incident that didn't go to court\n\ninformation about an ongoing police investigation\n\nIf police disclose information on your certificate but you think it isn't relevant or shouldn't be disclosed, you can raise a dispute with AccessNI.\n\nBarred list checks\n\nThe Disclosure and Barring Service keeps two barred lists:\n\npeople who are unsuitable for working with children\n\npeople who are unsuitable for working with vulnerable adults\n\nPeople on these lists are barred from regulated activity with children and vulnerable adults. It is a criminal offence for someone on these lists to work or apply to work in regulated activity.\n\nTo read about roles that are regulated, go to:\n\nRegulated activity with vulnerable groups\n\nFiltering criminal records\n\nSometimes details of your criminal record won’t appear on your disclosure certificate. This is called ‘filtering’. AccessNI filters convictions and cautions for minor or certain old offences from standard and enhanced checks.\n\nFiltering does not remove convictions for serious offences or convictions that resulted in a prison sentence.\n\nOffences that aren't filtered\n\nAccessNI does not filter:\n\na conviction or caution, diversionary youth conference or informed warning for a specified offence\n\na conviction resulting in a custodial sentence (including a suspended sentence)\n\na conviction for trying to commit a specified offence\n\na conviction for encouraging or helping someone else commit a specified offence\n\nSpecified offences\n\nSpecified offences are serious crimes that will always appear on an AccessNI check no matter when the crime occurred or the offender’s age when convicted.\n\nSpecified offences include:\n\nmurder, manslaughter, kidnap, hijack, money laundering\n\nviolence\n\nsexual crimes\n\nsafeguarding or child protection matters\n\nIf you’re convicted of an offence abroad and the foreign authorities share this information with UK police, this offence could appear on your criminal record in Northern Ireland. AccessNI will not filter an offence if it is equal to any on the specified list.\n\nAccessNI list of specified offences\n\nFiltered offences\n\nAccessNI filters information about certain convictions and offences.\n\nExamples of filtered records\n\nThe examples of filtered records explain when filtering applies to cautions or convictions for minor offences. Real people's names aren't used.\n\nOld and minor offence – conviction and fine\n\nArnold is 52. He was convicted and fined £50 for common assault in 2006. He didn't serve prison time or get a suspended sentence. This is his only conviction.\n\nThis will be filtered because the offence is not on the specified list and the conviction is more than 11 years old.\n\nMore than one offence – convictions and fines\n\nBasia is 50. She was convicted and fined £100 for common assault in 2005. In 2006 she was convicted and fined £100 for shoplifting. She didn't serve prison time or get a suspended sentence for either offence.\n\nThese convictions will be filtered as they are both over 11 years old and the offences are not on the specified list.\n\nUnder 18 – conviction and fine for an old offence\n\nCole is 24. He was convicted of common assault in 2011 and fined £200.\n\nThis will be filtered because the offence is not on the specified list and the conviction happened over five and a half years ago when Cole was under 18.\n\nUnder 18 - conviction and suspended prison sentence\n\nDelia is 20. She was convicted of common assault in 2017. She received six months detention in the Young Offenders Centre, suspended for two years.\n\nThis conviction will not be filtered because Delia received a prison sentence.\n\nSpecified offence - conviction and fine\n\nEly is 30. He was convicted of possessing prohibited images of children in 2004. He was fined £500.\n\nThis is a single office which happened over 11 years ago. This conviction will not be filtered because it is a specified offence.\n\nOver 18 - caution for a minor offence\n\nFlora is 25. She was cautioned for shoplifting in 2019.\n\nThis caution will not be filtered. Flora was over 18 when cautioned. Her caution is eligible to be filtered in 2025, six years after the caution.\n\nUnder 18 – caution for a minor offence\n\nGuy is 20. He was cautioned for shoplifting in 2015.\n\nThis caution will be filtered because Guy was under 18 when cautioned and over two years have passed since the caution.\n\nCaution and conviction for minor offences (under 18 and adult)\n\nHelga is 21. She was cautioned for shoplifting in 2010. She committed another offence in 2015. She was convicted and fined £100.\n\nThe caution will not be disclosed as Helga was under 18 when cautioned. Her separate conviction will be filtered in 2026, provided she has no further convictions.\n\nInformed warning and a caution\n\nIrene is 22. She received an informed warning for theft in 2015 and a caution for burglary in 2016.\n\nShe has two offences but none of this information will be on her check. Unlike convictions, more than one caution or informed warning can be filtered. The offences aren't on the specified list. More than two years have passed since the caution and one year since the informed warning.\n\nOther information on a standard or enhanced check\n\nFiltering doesn't remove information about your criminal history from your record. It means certain details aren't shown on your AccessNI check.\n\nSometimes AccessNI filters a caution or conviction but the offence appears on your certificate under “other information”. This happens when police believe a caution or conviction might be relevant to a job and should be disclosed on your certificate.\n\nIndependent review of criminal record information\n\nSometimes before a disclosure certificate is issued, AccessNI will ask for an independent review of criminal record information. An independent reviewer will do the review. The reviewer isn't employed by AccessNI.\n\nIf you were under 18 when convicted, the conviction is now spent and there is no information on adult offences, any criminal record information will go to an independent reviewer.\n\nThey'll write and ask if you want to say anything about the disclosure of this information. If you want to give information to the reviewer, you have 14 days to reply.\n\nThe independent reviewer might also ask for more information from:\n\npolice\n\nthe probation board\n\nthe Youth Justice Agency\n\nOnce the reviewer considers all the relevant information, they'll issue a certificate with:\n\nall the criminal record information held about you\n\nsome but not all of the criminal record information held about you\n\nnone of the criminal record information held about you\n\nAccessNI will write and tell you the independent reviewer's decision and your certificate will be issued. The independent reviewer's decision is final.\n\nDisputing an AccessNI certificate\n\nMore useful links"
