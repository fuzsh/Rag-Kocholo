        "text": "Aim of this page\n\nIf you’ve been convicted of a criminal offence in the past, then your opportunities for entering another country may be limited. It can be difficult to get a definitive answer as to what questions are being asked by a country’s immigration department about criminal records.\n\nThe aim of this page is to give brief guidance on the entry criteria for various countries throughout the world. It’s part of our information on travelling abroad.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nMany countries do not readily welcome people with a criminal record. However, how relevant your offence is and the time period that should elapse before being given permission to enter varies from country to country. Some are a lot stricter than others and it’s likely that we will have separate information where this is the case.\n\nIf you are being supervised by probation or on licence, you should follow the advice provided to you by your probation officer. Leaving the country without permission may result in a breach of your licence conditions.\n\nVisas\n\nIf the country you’re intending to visit doesn’t require you to have a visa then you’re less likely to have a problem as a result of your criminal record.\n\nDisclosure of your criminal record will often vary depending on the type of visa that you’re applying for. Most countries that issue retirement visas will require a police certificate as do work and student visas.\n\nIf you’re asked about your criminal convictions you should answer truthfully. If you don’t and they subsequently come to light, this could result in a lengthy or permanent bar to entering the country; this is especially so in Canada and the USA.\n\nTravel to Africa\n\nEgypt\n\nA visa to travel to Egypt needs to be purchased online in advance. However, there are no questions about criminal records on the visa application form.\n\nEthiopia\n\nThe majority of people travelling to Ethiopia will require a visa.
