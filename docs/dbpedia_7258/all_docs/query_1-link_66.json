        "text": "Heritage crime is any offence which harms the value of heritage assets and their settings.\n\nSome heritage assets are protected by specific legislation to prevent harm caused by damage or unlicensed alteration.\n\nHowever, other crimes such as theft, criminal damage, arson and anti-social behaviour offences can also damage and harm heritage assets, and interfere with the public's enjoyment and knowledge of their heritage.\n\nHeritage assets are sites which are considered to have a value to the heritage of England and include:\n\nListed buildings\n\nScheduled monuments\n\nWorld Heritage Sites\n\nProtected marine wreck sites\n\nConservation areas\n\nRegistered parks and gardens\n\nRegistered battlefields\n\nProtected military remains of aircraft and vessels of historic interest\n\nUndesignated but acknowledged heritage buildings and sites.\n\nHow big a problem is heritage crime?\n\nHistoric England commissioned research into the scale of heritage crime in England. The research found that historic places are not being targeted over other places, except for their valuable materials and artefacts. They are suffering a substantial rate of attrition nonetheless and they are of course susceptible to irreversible harm.\n\nThe research indicated that:\n\nAn estimated 18.7% of all listed buildings were physically affected by crime last year. That is over 70,000 listed buildings\n\nFor almost 30,000 listed buildings the impact was substantial\n\nThe biggest single threat is metal theft and the most threatened type of building is a church. About 3 in 8 churches or other religious buildings were damaged by crime last year\n\nYou can read the summary below:\n\nThe research was carried out by Newcastle University, Loughborough University and the Council of British Archaeology.\n\nFor a comprehensive study of current and emerging threats download the National Strategic Threat Assessments for Heritage and Cultural Property Crime for 2013 and 2017.\n\nThe assessments were prepared by Historic England and the National Police Chiefsâ€™ Council, to shape strategic and operational decision-making by providing an overview of the key issues affecting the delivery of effective assessment of intelligence, preventative measures, investigation, intervention and enforcement in relation to crime and anti-social behaviour committed against heritage assets and cultural property in the United Kingdom."
