        "text": "The police need as much information as possible to help them investigate the crime and to find other evidence. This includes:\n\nDescriptions of anyone involved\n\nDescriptions or names of any witnesses\n\nLicense plate number of any vehicles, even if they were not involved in the incident, as the driver may have seen something\n\nDescriptions, identifying marks or serial numbers of any stolen property\n\nSometimes, the police will need to take evidence from where the crime took place. This may vary depending on the type of crime and the seriousness of the crime. For example, they may take fingerprints or photos. This could be done by one of the officers on the scene or by a specially trained Crime Scene Investigator.\n\nThe police know how stressful and sometimes embarrassing it can be to have fingerprints or other samples taken, and they will try to be sensitive.\n\nIf you have been injured in an attack, the police may need to collect medical evidence so they can prove in court what happened."
