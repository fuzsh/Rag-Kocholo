        "text": "If you are a UK citizen and you wish to travel to Australia for business or leisure, you can apply for an eVisitor visa. This allows you to visit Australia for up to three months at a time during any 12-month period.\n\nTo be eligible to apply for an eVisitor visa, the conditions state that you must not have any criminal convictions, for which the sentence or sentences are for a total period of 12 months duration or more (whether served or not), at the time of travel to, and entry into, Australia.\n\nYou will be asked to disclose any offences that are currently awaiting legal action and whether you have been convicted of an offence in any country.\n\nYou will not be eligible to apply for an eVisitor visa if:\n\nYou have a conviction that resulted in a prison sentence of 12 months or more (regardless of the time served)\n\nYou have been convicted for two or more offences and the combined length of all your sentences amounts to 12 months or more (regardless of the time served)\n\nYou have a suspended prison sentence where the period you would have served, had it not been suspended, was 12 months or more\n\nIf you are not eligible to apply for an eVisitor visa, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you cannot travel to Australia. It means that you will have to apply for a full tourist visa through the Australian Embassy. As part of your application, you will need to apply for a police certificate.\n\nTo be granted a tourist visa to travel to Australia, you must be deemed to be of ‘good character’. The Australian authorities will take your criminal record into account when determining whether you are of good character and will have particular concerns if you have a substantial criminal record. They define a substantial criminal record as the following:\n\nA sentence of life imprisonment\n\nA sentence of imprisonment of 12 months or more (regardless of time served)\n\nAcquittal of an offence on the grounds of either unsoundness of mind or insanity if, as a result, you have been detained in a secure hospital or facility\n\nA current, or previous, association with an individual, group or organisation suspected of having been, or being, involved in criminal conduct\n\nIf any of the above points apply to you, you will need to provide evidence of what you have done since the offence that can reassure them that you are of good character. This will be taken into account when they assess your application.\n\nIf your visa application is cancelled on the grounds of either a substantial criminal record, or past and present criminal conduct, you will be permanently excluded from entering Australia.\n\nIf you wish to appeal this decision, you must do so within 28 days. Appeals can be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.\n\nChanges to the entry requirements for Canada were implemented in March 2016. These changes mean that UK citizens need to apply for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (eTA) to fly or transit through Canada.\n\nIf you are not a UK citizen, check the Canadian Embassy website to find out if you need an eTA or visitors visa.\n\nYou can apply online for the eTA and, in most cases, your eTA will be approved within minutes of you completing the application. However, there is a question on the application form that asks:\n\n“Have you ever committed, been arrested for, been charged with, or convicted of any criminal offence in any country?”\n\nThe advice from the Canadian Embassy is that you should answer yes to this question if you have ever been arrested, charged with or convicted for a criminal offence in any country. There is also some space on the form to provide details and failure to provide sufficient details may delay the processing of your application.\n\nIf you answer ‘yes’ to the question, you will be asked to provide a Police Certificate and your court records within a 30-day period.\n\nUnder Canada’s immigration law, you may be refused entry to Canada if you have been convicted of a criminal offence. However, this will depend on the crime, how long ago it was and how you have behaved since. Your application may be granted if you:\n\nconvince an immigration officer that you meet the legal terms to be deemed rehabilitated\n\napply for rehabilitation and this has been approved\n\nwere granted a record suspension or\n\nhave a temporary resident permit.\n\nIf your convictions are spent under the terms of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, you will be deemed rehabilitated for the purposes of entering Canada. This is following a decision made in the 1991 case of Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) v. Burgon.\n\nIf your convictions are spent, you do not need to apply for rehabilitation, but you should check that you are eligible to be considered as such before you travel. For more information on how to do this, please see here.\n\nIf you need to travel to Canada for a particular reason, you can apply for a temporary resident permit. For more information on how to do this, please see here.\n\nIf you wish to emigrate to Canada, you will need to provide a police certificate as part of your application.\n\nBritish Citizens can enter Japan as a visitor for up for 90 days. If you are visiting Japan for any other purposes (e.g. work or studying) you will need to obtain a valid visa from the Japanese Embassy.\n\nDo they ask about criminal records?\n\nYes, on the Disembarkation Card for Foreign Nationals (landing card), they ask the question:\n\n‘Any history of being convicted of a crime (not only in Japan) Yes/No’\n\nIf I tick ‘yes’ on the Disembarkation Card, will I be allowed entry into Japan?\n\nJapan has some of the strictest entry requirements for foreign nationals. The Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act states the following:\n\nA foreign national who falls under any of the following item shall not enter Japan.\n\n(iv) A person who has been convicted of a violation of any law or regulation of Japan, or of\n\nany other country, and has been sentenced to imprisonment with or without work for 1 year\n\nor more, or to an equivalent penalty. However, this shall not apply to those convicted of a\n\npolitical offense.\n\n(v) A person who has been convicted of a violation of any law or regulation of Japan or of\n\nany other country relating to the control of narcotics, marijuana, opium, stimulants or\n\nPsychotropic substances, and has been sentenced to a penalty.\n\nIf you tick ‘yes’ on the Disembarkation Card, you will almost certainly be questioned upon arrival by an immigration officer, who will then make a decision whether to allow you entry into Japan.\n\nIf you are a UK citizen, you can travel to the US without a visa if you intend to stay for 90 days or less, but you are required to apply for authorisation to travel under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). You can apply for authorisation to travel to or through the US by completing an Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) form.\n\nIf you have a criminal record, you may not be eligible to travel under the VWP. The ESTA form asks applicants for the following information:\n\nHave you ever been arrested or convicted for a crime that resulted in serious damage to property, or serious harm to another person, or government authority?\n\nThis question relates to ‘moral turpitude’ offences. ‘Moral turpitude’ is a legal term in the US that includes offences relating to:\n\nCrimes against the person such as murder, manslaughter, rape, gross indecency, serious assaults, kidnapping\n\nCrimes against property such as arson, burglary, theft, robbery, fraud, receiving stolen property\n\nCrimes against government authority such as benefit fraud, tax evasion, bribery, perjury\n\nAccording to the legislation, your offence will not be considered one of moral turpitude if:\n\nYou were under 18 when you committed the offence\n\nAt least five years have elapsed since the date of your conviction or, where you were sentenced to a period of detention or imprisonment, at least five years have elapsed since the date of your release\n\nThe maximum possible sentence for the offence was less than 12 months (regardless of the actual sentence you received) and you were sentenced to six months or less\n\nNote that if your offence meets the above conditions, this does not mean you do not need to declare it. The advice from the US Embassy is that if you have ever been arrested or convicted for any reason in any country, even if the arrest did not lead to a conviction, you should answer ‘yes’ to this question. The only exception would be an arrest for a minor motoring offence that resulted in a fixed penalty notice or other out of court disposal.\n\nHave you ever violated any law related to possessing, using or distributing illegal drugs?\n\nDo you seek to engage in, or have you ever engaged in terrorist activities, espionage, sabotage, or genocide?\n\nHave you ever committed fraud or misrepresented yourself to obtain, or assist others to obtain, a visa or entry into the United States?\n\nIf you answer ‘yes’ to any of the above questions it doesn’t necessarily mean that you cannot travel to the US. It means that you are not eligible to travel under the VWP. Instead, you will need to apply for a Visitor Business (B1) or Pleasure (B2) visa through the US Embassy. As part of your application, you will need to apply for a police certificate and you may need to attend an interview. The US Department of State have useful information on their website about what they take into account when deciding whether or not to grant a visa. See here for further information about applying for a visa.\n\nMy conviction or caution is spent under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act. Do I still need to declare it on the ESTA form?\n\nYes. The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 has jurisdiction in England and Wales only. Other countries have different means by which they deem a person to be legally rehabilitated. The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act does not apply to US visa law.\n\nRefusal of entry to/deportation from the US\n\nWhen you check in for your flight at a UK airport, you will be asked a series of questions and your answers will be checked against the information provided in your Visa Waiver application. Similarly, when you reach immigration at a US airport, you will be asked to provide your fingerprints and again you will be asked a series of questions and your answers will be checked against your Visa Waiver application.\n\nIf your answers conflict with the information you have provided on your Visa Waiver application form, or if the authorities have any doubts about the information you have provided, you may find that you are refused entry to the US and you are returned back to the UK.\n\nRefusal of a future visa application\n\nIt may be that you decide to withhold details of you criminal record and successfully travel to, or via, the US under the Visa Waiver Programme. It may then be the case that at some point in the future you need to apply for a visa to the US – perhaps because you take on certain employment – and you need to travel there for longer than 90 days, or you decide to emigrate.\n\nIn order to apply for the visa, you will need to supply a copy of your Police Certificate which may disclose details of your criminal record which you had previously withheld. The US Embassy will retain details of your previous Visa Waiver and this may then give them grounds to refuse your new visa application for having previously lied about your criminal record.\n\nApplying for a visa\n\nIf you are not eligible to travel under the Visa Waiver Programme, you will need to apply for a Visitor Business (B1) or Pleasure (B2) visa through the US Embassy.\n\nVisa application form\n\nThe visa application form asks ‘Have you ever been arrested or convicted for any offence or crime, even though subject of a pardon, amnesty or other similar action?’\n\nThe US Embassy advises that they expect you to declare any arrests or convictions, regardless of the nature of the offence or the length of time that has elapsed. Note that the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 does not apply to US visa law, so even convictions which may be deemed as spent would need to be declared.\n\nPersonal Data Sheet (VCU-01)\n\nWhere you declare that you have previous arrests or convictions, you will also be required to complete a Personal Data Sheet. This form requires further details about whatever you have declared.\n\nPolice certificate\n\nAs part of your visa application, you will be required to provide a Police Certificate issued by the Criminal Record Office (ACRO). The certificate must be issued within six months of the date of your visa interview.\n\nACRO filter certain eligible records from Police Certificates after the relevant period of time has elapsed. This means that you may find that some or all of your cautions or convictions are not recorded on your Police Certificate. For this reason, we recommend that you apply for your Police Certificate before completing the Personal Data Sheet.\n\nVisa interview\n\nOnce you have completed your visa application, you can arrange an appointment with the Visa Coordination Officer at the US embassy in London. The decision to grant or deny a visa is made on a case-by-case basis. You can improve your chances if you prepare for the interview in advance, in particular thinking about how you can provide evidence about:\n\nWhy you wish to travel to the US\n\nWhy you wish to return to the UK (e.g. details of your job and/or family ties)\n\nRemorse for your offence(s)\n\nWhat you have learnt from your offence(s)\n\nHow your circumstances have changed since your offence(s). Take any evidence of behavioural or education courses you have completed; counselling you may have undertaken and any other evidence of rehabilitation\n\nFor further advice and information, please contact the Resettlement Advice Service on 0300 123 1999 or email helpline@nacro.org.uk."
