        "text": "document View text version of image ( 11 KB )\n\nNCA international liaison officers\n\nTo combat international serious and organised crime effectively we deploy NCA International Liaison Officers (ILOs) in strategic locations around the world where their expertise can help disrupt serious criminality before it impacts on the UK.\n\nOur network of ILOs deployed overseas, supported by UK based officers, covers more than 130 countries around the world.\n\nCollectively they fulfil a vital role, extending our global reach and influence by working alongside our international law enforcement partners to tackle serious and organised crime in key locations that provide the best opportunity to disrupt the threat to the UK.\n\nThe ILOs work closely with the police, border, customs, security agencies and judicial authorities in the countries to which they are deployed, directing the development of intelligence, ensuring information is shared appropriately and coordinating law enforcement action that supports UK investigations.\n\nThe support that the ILOs can provide varies depending on their location and the capabilities of host partners.\n\nIn many countries ILOs help to build and improve the capability of overseas agencies to deal with organised crime threats through training programmes, providing much needed equipment and sharing the NCA experience of how best to tackle emerging threats such as cyber crime and modern slavery.\n\nEffective collaboration with host nation law enforcement allows us to use their assets and capabilities to support our own priorities and operational work.\n\nWe recognise the need for agility as threat types emerge, change or develop. To combat specific threats we may deploy officers with particular specialist skills to parts of the world where we assess particular crime threats are present that impact adversely upon UK interests. These threats include those from drugs, child sexual abuse and exploitation, cyber crime, corruption and kidnapping.\n\nFacilitating cooperation with international law enforcement\n\nOur UK International Crime Bureau (UKICB) provides the UK National Central Bureau for INTERPOL and the UK Europol National Unit.\n\nAt Europol in the Hague we lead the UK Liaison Bureau. This is a multi-agency team made up of NCA officers and seconded officers from:\n\nMetropolitan Police Service\n\nHM Revenue & Customs\n\nPolice Scotland\n\nImmigration Enforcement\n\nACRO Criminal Records Office\n\nRegional Organised Crime Units\n\nThe UK Liaison Bureau supports many serious and organised crime investigations by UK law enforcement agencies\n\nSupporting diplomatic objectives\n\nIn addition we recognise the strength and benefits of the UK diplomatic agenda in the fight against serous and organised crime. To that end, NCA international liaison officers also play a vital role in supporting the UK with diplomatic efforts globally. .\n\nEnhancing stability and improving cooperation with foreign partners has huge benefits to the security and economic prosperity of the UK.\n\nThe constructive relationships we have developed internationally mean that our international liaison officers enjoy unique access to the very highest levels of host nation governance, including Interior Ministries, intelligence agencies, law enforcement bodies and National Security Councils that other representatives of the UK government may not have.\n\nWorking together with partners from across UK government, including the Foreign & Commonwealth Office and the Home Office, this privileged access is a critical platform from which to promote ‘Global Britain’, and the values this represents, including respect for human rights and commitment to the rules-based international order."
