        "text": "Written by: Hilbert College • Jun 6, 2023\n\nThe Anatomy of a Crime Scene: Examples, Investigation and Analysis Â¶\n\nLaw enforcement is trained to gather evidence and solve crimes. However, a crime scene involves many people and many steps, so everyone involved must work together to effectively process a crime scene. Understanding the anatomy of a crime scene can make or break a case.\n\nTo learn more, check out the infographic below, created by Hilbert College Globalâs online Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice.\n\nWhat Is a Crime Scene? Â¶\n\nA crime scene describes the location where a crime takes place. It can also include where evidence is found or where a suspect lives.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nRobberies Â¶\n\nA robbery is a theft that involves violence or the threat of violence. Robbery crime scenes may include, convenience stores, commercial establishments, banks, private residences, parking lots or the streets. Basically, itâs anywhere a person was robbed.\n\nHomicides Â¶\n\nA homicide is a murder committed intentionally or during the commission of another crime. Homicide crime scenes may include where a victim was killed and where the body was found. It may also include where a murder was planned or where the murder weapon was discarded.\n\nSecondary Locations Â¶\n\nA secondary location is a site important to identifying and prosecuting a suspect. Secondary locations may include the paths a suspect traveled during the commission of a crime, where a second crime was committed, or a location where suspects convened before or after a crime. These crime scenes may be found after the initial crime is discovered.\n\nAssault Â¶\n\nAn assault is the intentional harming of another person physically. Assault crime scenes may include a residence, highways and sidewalks, parking garages and lots, convenience stores or hotels and motels. An assault may happen anywhere, so crime scenes can vary.\n\nDigital Crime Scenes Â¶\n\nSome crimes are committed online or through invasive malware. For cybercrimes, investigators go through victimsâ digital devices to find evidence. Suspectsâ computers and mobile devices are also considered crime scenes.\n\nWhoâs on the Scene? Â¶\n\nInvestigators interview witnesses and gather information from law enforcement on the scene. They also manage information given to the press.\n\nCrime scene technicians identify physical evidence at the scene. They also photograph crime scenes soÂ law enforcement and lawyers can see the original scene. Once theyâve finished at the crime scene, they write final reports of their findings.\n\nPolice officers are often first at the scene and alert necessary law enforcement. They protect the crime scene by cordoning it off. They will also keep witnesses so the Investigator can interview them.\n\nMedical examiners and coroners examine victimsâ bodies and in the morgue. They also collect physical evidence from victims. Once theyâve analyzed the scene, they will provide law enforcement with information.\n\nHow Long Is It a Crime Scene? Â¶\n\nA crime scene isnât considered cleared until the investigative team has gathered all possible evidence and information. This may take between one and two days. If a crime takes place over multiple locations, it may take longer to process each crime scene and clear them all.Â\n\nWhat Happens at a Crime Scene? Â¶\n\nAt the crime scene, law enforcement dispatches a crime scene detail to process the scene through:\n\nEvidence Gathering Â¶\n\nEvidence can prove motive, opportunity, intent, planning and identity. A perimeter must be established to keep the crime scene from being compromised. Law enforcement searches the scene for physical evidence and any clues about the subject.Â\n\nTechnicians photograph blood evidence, victimsâ wounds, surrounding areas and physical evidence before being bagged. The scene is sketched with measurements. Everything is put into evidence bags, labeled and sent to the appropriate authorities.\n\nWitness Questioning Â¶\n\nLaw enforcement establishes witnesses and obtains valid identification. Then, they separate each witness and record their name, birthday, address and all phone numbers. Finally, witnesses are interviewed individually on scene or at the office location.\n\nInvestigation Â¶\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) lists the steps of a well-planned investigation as:\n\nFirst responders notify correct personnel.\n\nThe prosecutor, the forensic doctor and scientific/technical assistance are assigned to the case.\n\nParties arrive at the crime scene.\n\nCordon off the crime scene.\n\nDetermine the proper procedures and apply.\n\nKeep the location secure.\n\nMedical personnel takes responsibility for the scene.\n\nDecide what information the media will receive.\n\nInterview witnesses.\n\nDisperse uninvolved bystanders.\n\nRecord the crime scene.\n\nNotify involved civilians.\n\nTake statements and gather information.\n\nProcessing Â¶\n\nUSAID lists the most important steps while processing a scene as follows:\n\nDetermine where to search for evidence and suspects.\n\nDescribe the immediate setting as evidence.\n\nProperly gather and remove evidence.\n\nIdentify, label and tag evidence.\n\nEstablish the chain of custody from the scene.\n\nAnalyze the evidence for information.\n\nPreserve the evidence for trial.\n\nUse available information to interpret the crime scene.Â\n\nWhat Happens Next? Â¶\n\nOnce all possible information has been gathered from a crime scene, investigators and attorneys build a case to either convict or exonerate a suspect.\n\nForensic Analysis Â¶\n\nForensic analysts examine the crime scene evidence. Whether the evidence is physical or digital, forensic analysts extract information and provide it to the defense and prosecution. Forensic analysts may also serve as expert witnesses.\n\nIdentifying Suspects Â¶\n\nThrough examining the crime scene and data provided by forensic analysts, investigators assemble a list of suspects. Investigators interview possible suspects and reinterview witnesses. When suspects are identified, they may be brought in for questioning or arrested.\n\nPreparing for Court Â¶\n\nInvestigators turn over their findings to prosecutors and defense lawyers. The lawyers may return to the crime scene to better understand the crime. Suspects work with the defense to prove their innocence. Both parties gather expert witnesses to strengthen their cases.\n\nPresenting the Case Â¶\n\nDuring trial, witnesses take the stand to explain what they saw. Lawyers reconstruct the crime scene to either prove or disprove a defendantâs guilt. Evidence gathered at the crime scene is presented to the judge and jury.\n\nAnalysis of a Crime Scene Â¶\n\nEvery crime leaves evidence behind, and law enforcement is trained to identify it. At the crime scene, technicians, officers and investigators gather all available evidence and do their best to find a suspect. Many steps and different professionals are involved, and they all must understand their roles and how crime scenes function.\n\nSources\n\nBritannica, Homicide\n\nEncyclopedia.com, Crime Scene Investigation\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation, Trend of Violent Crime from 2011 to 2021\n\nFind Law, Robbery Overview\n\nMy Law Questions, âWhat Is A Crime Scene?\n\nNational Institute of Justice, Digital Evidence and Forensics\n\nNOLO, âAssault, Battery, and Aggravated Assaultâ United States Attorney General, Homicide Scene Investigation: A Manual for Public Prosecutors"
