Approximately one-third are police officers deployed by their governments while two-thirds are international civil servants recruited by the Organization.\n\nFalse\n\nOur Red Notice is an international wanted persons notice, but it is up to each country to decide what legal status they give it, and whether or not to arrest the subject of the notice.\n\nFalse\n\nINTERPOL is not involved in extradition requests; these are made on a bilateral basis between national authorities.\n\nFalse\n\nINTERPOL is not a member of the United Nations and is not part of the UN system. We are an intergovernmental body with 196 member countries. But we do work alongside the UN in some of our activities.\n\nFalse\n\nContrary to the Hollywood image of INTERPOL, the General Secretariat does not send officers on undercover assignment. All investigations and arrests are carried out by national police in their own country.\n\nYou should be careful where you buy spare parts for your car â€“ they could be counterfeit.\n\nTrue\n\nThere is an illicit market in spare vehicle parts which has been exacerbated by the use of the Internet in recent years. This is lucrative for criminals but can put drivers in danger as these parts may not meet safety standards.\n\nTrue\n\nWe can deploy an Incident Response Team to help with the emergency response to large-scale accidents or natural disasters, or to a major crime scene.\n\nTrue\n\nPolice have seized counterfeit alcohol that has been found to contain antifreeze, nail polish remover and even paint stripper."
