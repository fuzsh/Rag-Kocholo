        "text": "I, like many others in the UK, have been through a profoundly traumatic experience — a social media pile-on - it's defined as an argument or attack by a large group of people against one person or a much smaller group.\n\nThey are a common occurrence on platforms such as Twitter. Social media pile-ons are not fun and can cause real harm to people, especially if it lasts for a few days - it can feel as though the entire world hates you. The justification that many people use for engaging in these pile-ons is to “hold the person to account”.\n\nIt's understandable - we tend to want people to learn from their mistakes but also to be held accountable for their actions. However, this can quickly turn into public shaming. If groups people are yelling at you about your mistake or action, you’re not going to learn much. More likely, you will either abandon social media platforms altogether or become defensive, resentful and retreat further into your position.\n\nMy experience is exactly that; a year on, and my life remains in tatters. The nature of the offence doesn't really matter, it's the fact that everyone was against me and no one stood up for me against the masses of social media users who may as well have wished me dead. That is profoundly traumatising and is not talked about enough - the sheer impact on the individual. It would not have been a problem if I was called out privately by those closest to me - the opinions of whom I value the most, but a huge amount of strangers passing judgement on my personal life is not something anyone could be equipped for.\n\nI don’t feel I signed up for a public shaming, and I don’t feel you ever recover from that. I got into the habit of reading what was said about me but I eventually stopped. Initially I believed it would validate all of these beliefs I had, but it just left more scars. I was terrified of real-life consequences, such as being doxxed (leading to me changing my phone number) and being attacked in the street by someone who may recognise me. I didn't feel like it was anything other than the worst thing that ever happened. I’ve felt guilty, which I deem to be productive, but I also feel a huge amount of shame, which is not quite so productive. I feel like I’m going to feel that way forever and that I am always going to be a terrible person.\n\nWhile I will say it allowed for learning and that it needed to happen, it would be wrong to suggest it made me a stronger person. It didn't - it taught me that the safest way to survive is to hide away. That's not how I want to live the rest of my life."
