        "text": "The âfailure to prevent fraudâ offence\n\nOne of the measures introduced â under the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023, which received Royal Assent on 26 October 2023, â is a new âfailure to prevent fraudâ offence.\n\nThis offence is the next in a series of âfailure to preventâ offences intended to encourage organisations to take responsibility for poor systems and controls that may be exploited by individuals to break the law.\n\nYou may be aware of the existing âfailure to preventâ offences:\n\nThe âfailure to prevent briberyâ offence introduced under the UK Bribery Act 2010\n\nThe âfailure to prevent the facilitation of tax evasionâ offences introduced under the Criminal Finances Act 2017Â\n\nUnder the âfailure to prevent fraudâ legislation, a large organisation (defined in line with the Companies Act 2006[1]) may be prosecuted with the potential for an unlimited fine where an âassociated personâ (such as an employee, agent or subsidiary) commits a fraud offence intended to benefit the organisation or any person to whom the âassociated personâ provides services on behalf of the organisation, regardless of whether senior management of the organisation was aware of the offence being committed. This may apply even if the organisation and the âassociated personâ are based outside of the UK.\n\nIt is the word âbenefitâ that makes this legislation interesting and something that most companies will have to seriously consider. It means that organisations (which includes not-for-profit entities and incorporated public bodies as well as companies) will have to assess whether or not their current fraud risk frameworks cover fraud perpetrated by the company or just focuses on the more common but not relevant (in this context) fraudulent attacks on the company, such as theft by employees or attacks from organised criminals.\n\nThe factsheet published by the UK Government on the âfailure to prevent fraudâ offence makes it clear that the definition of fraud benefiting the company is wide, covering not only misreporting (for instance in the Annual Report and Accounts) but also:\n\nDishonest sales and trading practices hiding information from parties such as consumers or investors\n\nDishonest practices in financial markets\n\nOrganisations will need to consider whether statements they make about ESG-related matters, the effectiveness of their goods and services and any other reporting, either publicly or to specific third parties are accurate. This also covers statements made by any third-party agents acting on their behalf.\n\nThe risk of this fraud occurring could be more than an unlimited fine. It could have other consequences, such as serious reputational damage."
