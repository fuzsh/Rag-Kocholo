        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe law on public order offences is mainly set down in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994. It deals with how people behave in public places, for example, being drunk in a public place, and also provides for crowd control at public events. Under the law, a ‘public place’ includes roads, public parks or recreational areas, cemeteries, churchyards, trains, buses and other public transport vehicles.\n\nIf a Garda suspects you have committed a public order offence under this Act, you must give them your name and address if you are asked for them. In fact, it is an offence if you fail to give your name and address in this situation, and you can be arrested without warrant for this.\n\nThe Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provides that, if you are convicted of certain offences under the 1994 Act, you can be excluded from a premises for up to a year. This is in addition to the penalty under the 1994 Act.\n\nIntoxication (being drunk) in a public place\n\nIt is a public order offence to be drunk in a public place. If a Garda suspects that you are intoxicated in a public place they can take the intoxicating substance away from you.\n\nThe penalty for being intoxicated in a public place is either:\n\nA fixed charge fine of €100, or\n\nThe maximum class E fine of €500, if the Gardaí decide to prosecute you for the offence, and you are convicted\n\nDisorderly conduct in a public place\n\nIt is an offence to engage in offensive conduct in a public place:\n\nBetween the hours of midnight and 7am, or\n\nAt any time, if a Garda has asked you to stop\n\nOffensive conduct is unreasonable behaviour which is likely to cause serious offence or serious annoyance to other people. This public order offence aims to deal with disorderly behaviour which falls short of threatening behaviour but could still adversely affect the quality of people’s lives. For example, people shouting late at night after leaving a nightclub where this would cause serious annoyance to local residents.\n\nThe penalty for this offence is either:\n\nA fixed charge fine of €140 , or\n\nThe maximum class D fine if the Gardaí decide to prosecute you for the offence, and you are convicted\n\nYou must give your name and address to the Garda, if you want this offence treated as a fixed charge offence. If you don’t give your name and address, you can be arrested without warrant for this and convicted of a summary offence for which the maximum penalty is a class C fine.\n\nThreatening and abusive behaviour\n\nThreatening, abusive or insulting behaviour in a public place\n\nIt is an offence to use threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour in a public place with the intention of breaching the peace. For example, if your words or actions are likely to cause a fight with the person you are insulting, or a group of youths is looking for trouble because of their threatening behaviour towards other people.\n\nIf you are found guilty of this offence you can be liable to a class D fine and to a prison sentence of up to 3 months.\n\nBegging in an intimidating or threatening manner\n\nBegging in an aggressive, intimidating or threatening manner is a public order offence. A person found guilty of this offence is liable on summary conviction to a class E fine or up to one month in prison, or both.\n\nThe Gardaí can direct people begging in certain areas to leave that area, for example, people begging at an ATM, a night safe, a vending machine or a shop entrance. If the person does not follow the request to move they can be charged with an offence and get a class E fine on summary conviction.\n\nIt is also an offence to organise or direct someone else to beg. On summary conviction for this offence, you are liable to a class A fine, or up to 12 months in prison, or both.\n\nDistributing or displaying threatening, abusive, insulting or obscene material in a public place\n\nDistributing or displaying offensive material in a public place is a public order offence. The penalty for this offence is a class D fine, or a prison sentence of up to 3 months, or both.\n\nAffray\n\nAffray is when 2 or more people use or threaten to use unlawful violence towards each other, and their conduct would cause someone of reasonable firmness who was present at that place to fear for their or someone else’s safety.\n\nThe violence involved in affray must be between the 2 or more people involved and not directed towards innocent by-standers. For example, affray would be where a group of people are fighting against each other in the street. Affray can take place in a public or private place.\n\nThe offence of affray is only committed when actual unlawful violence is used. Threats alone do not constitute the offence of affray. If you are convicted of affray, you can receive a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine, or up to 5 years in prison, or both.\n\nBlackmail, extortion and demanding money with menaces\n\nIt is an offence for a person to make unwarranted demands with menaces to make personal gains for themselves or another, or with the intention to cause a loss to another.\n\nThe exception to this offence is if the person making the demand with menaces believes that:\n\nThey have reasonable grounds for making the demand, and\n\nThe use of menaces is a proper means of reinforcing the demand\n\nWhile there is no definition in the Act of “menaces”, the courts held that:\n\n“The word menace is to be liberally construed, and not limited to threats of violence but should include threats of any action detrimental to or unpleasant to the person addressed”.\n\nIf you are convicted of this offence, the maximum punishment is an unlimited fine, or up to 14 years in prison, or both.\n\nFailure to comply with the direction of a member of An Garda Síochána\n\nIt is an offence if you do not comply with a Garda’s request to stop behaving in a way that they believe is endangering people’s safety, property, or the public peace.\n\nIf you are behaving in this way, the Garda can also ask you to “move on” to avert any potential trouble. This means that they do not have to apply the full force of criminal law by arresting you, charging you and bringing you before the courts.\n\nIt is an offence to not follow these Garda directions, unless you have a reasonable excuse or lawful authority to do so. Any person convicted of failing to comply with a Garda direction in this way, is liable on summary conviction to a class D fine, or to a maximum term of 6 months in prison, or both.\n\nWilful obstruction\n\nIt is an offence to deliberately prevent or interrupt a person or vehicle from passing freely in a public place, unless you have the legal authority or a reasonable excuse to do this. The penalty for this offence is a fine of up to €400.\n\nThis offence was created to protect the constitutional rights of the individual to pass on a public highway. While the Gardaí have no power to arrest for this offence, they can direct the person to stop the obstruction. Failure to comply with that direction is an offence.\n\nEntering a building with intent to commit an offence\n\nIt is an offence to enter a building or the vicinity of a building with the intention of committing an offence or interfering with property.\n\nUnder the definition of this offence, it is enough to be on the property, for example, in the back garden or the driveway of a house. But, in any proceedings against the accused, it is up to the prosecution to prove that the accused was there with the intention of committing an offence or interfering with property.\n\nIf you are found guilty of this offence you will be liable on summary conviction to a class C fine, or to a maximum term in prison of 6 months, or both.\n\nTrespass\n\nIt is an offence to trespass in a way that is likely to cause fear in another person. This offence does not include any intent to commit a crime or to interfere with property. If you are found guilty of this offence, you are liable on summary conviction to a Class C fine, or up to 12 months in prison, or both.\n\nIf the Garda find you trespassing in a way that causes, or is likely to cause, fear in another person, they can direct you to:\n\nStop acting in that way, and\n\nImmediately leave the area in a peaceable and orderly manner\n\nIf you fail to comply with this direction, you are guilty of an offence, unless you have a reasonable excuse or lawful authority not to comply. If you are found guilty of this offence, you are liable to a class D fine, or up to 6 months in prison, or both.\n\nRiot\n\nRiot is one of the major and most serious public order offences. It is defined as when 12 or more people are together at one place and use, or threaten to use, unlawful violence for a common purpose, and their conduct would cause someone of reasonable firmness who was present at that place to fear for their or someone else’s safety. Anyone using unlawful violence for the common purpose in this way is guilty of the offence of riot.\n\nThe important parts of this offence are:\n\nThat at least 12 people must use or threaten to use violence\n\nThey must have a common purpose in doing so\n\nTheir conduct would cause a reasonable observer to fear for their safety or the safety of some other person\n\nThe accused used unlawful violence\n\nThis offence can be committed in a public or private place. The offence of riot can be used by the Gardaí in situations where large groups of people assemble in protest and the protest turns into unlawful violence.\n\nThe maximum penalty for the offence of riot is an unlimited fine, a prison sentence of up to 10 years, or both.\n\nViolent disorder\n\nViolent disorder is a public order offence which is similar to the offence of riot. However, it is a lesser version of that offence.\n\nViolent disorder is when 3 or more people are together at a place, and they use or threaten to use violence, and their conduct would cause someone of reasonable firmness, who was present at that place to fear for their or someone else’s safety.\n\nFor the offence of riot, the accused person must have used violence, whereas for violent disorder the accused person only needs to threaten to use violence. For the offence of violent disorder, the group do not have to share a common purpose, whereas this is a requirement for riot.\n\nThe maximum penalty for violent disorder is an unlimited fine, or a prison sentence of up to 10 years, or both.\n\nAssault with intent to cause bodily harm or commit an indictable offence\n\nThe main area of law that deals with assault is the Non-fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. However, Section 18 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 creates another offence of assault with intent to cause bodily harm or to commit an indictable offence.\n\nThis offence covers aggravated assaults when someone assaults another person with the intention of causing bodily harm or committing an indictable offence. A person convicted of this offence could face a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine, or a prison sentence of up to 10 years, or both.\n\nAssault or obstruction of a peace officer"
