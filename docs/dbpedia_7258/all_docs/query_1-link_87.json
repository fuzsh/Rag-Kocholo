        "text": "Drugs and the law\n\nIt's illegal:\n\nto have or own drugs\n\nto supply anyone with drugs\n\nto make drugs\n\nto import or export drugs\n\nIt's also illegal to allow premises you own, rent, use or occupy to be used for any drug-related activity.\n\nIf you are found with drugs near a school, youth facility or location where young people formally meet, the courts will treat this as an aggravating issue can impose higher penalties.\n\nDrug dependency\n\nFor many drug users, increased drug use can lead to dependency and this condition can lead to many new problems. As drug misuse and dependency increases it can become more difficult to work and maintain a job. This can lead to financial problems as bills, such as mortgages, rent and rates, together with other household bills, cannot be paid.\n\nEven social security benefits might not be enough income to pay for drug use. Money may need to be borrowed and if repayments can't be met, this brings other problems.\n\nAs drug misuse increases, some people may use crime, such as burglary, to find items that can be stolen and sold to others to raise money to buy more drugs. Others may resort to more serious crimes such as robbery, theft, extortion - anything to secure money to buy drugs. Some people will resort to dealing to raise income, but if caught by the police this can lead to higher penalties being given by a court.\n\nIt is important to realise that getting involved in drugs can bring many other problems that can affect your health, your relationships with your family and friends, your financial wellbeing and where you live.\n\nHow drugs are classified\n\nDrugs are put into one of three categories, according to how dangerous they are and the impact they have on society - not necessarily the individual. It’s worth remembering that different drugs affect people in different ways. Drugs in all classes, not just those in ‘Class A’, are very dangerous.\n\nThe three categories of drugs are Class A, Class B and Class C:\n\nheroin, cocaine, ecstasy and LSD are Class A drugs\n\nspeed, cannabis, ketamine, mephedrone and some amphetamines are Class B drugs\n\nanabolic steroids, GHB and some tranquillisers are Class C drugs\n\n“Temporary Class Drug Banning Orders” are for psychoactive substances (sometimes mislabelled as legal highs).\n\nThe chemical composition of these new substances changes quickly. A temporary banning order allows a substance to be banned until analysis can be carried out to assess the potential risks to human health.\n\nPossessing drugs\n\nIf the police stop you and you are in possession of drugs, it is likely that you will be arrested. The drugs found will be seized and destroyed.\n\nIf you're caught with drugs you may be charged with possessing (or possession with intent to supply - a much more serious offence) controlled drugs, whether it's yours or not. If you're aged 17 or under, the police are allowed to tell your parent, guardian or carer that you've been caught.\n\nIf the police find you with drugs, the punishment that you receive will depend on the class of drug, the quantity of drugs found, where you are found (if found close to a school or youth club, the court can give a higher sentence) and your personal history (previous crimes, but importantly, any previous drug offences).\n\nFor example, if you are under 18 years old and found with a Class C drug, and depending on the circumstances, it should be anticipated that, as a minimum, you will receive a formal (recorded) warning and a police caution. You may also be referred to the police Youth Diversion Scheme. If over 18 years it should be anticipated that you will receive a caution and further action, such as prosecution, will depend upon the decision reached by the Public Prosecution Service.\n\nRisks of taking drugs\n\nHistory of drug offences\n\nIf you're found with a Class A or B drug and have a history of drug offences, you will be prosecuted.\n\nThe maximum sentences for possession of each class of drug are:\n\nup to seven years in prison or an unlimited fine (or both) for a Class A drug\n\nup to five years in prison or an unlimited fine (or both) for a Class B drug\n\nup to two years in prison or an unlimited fine (or both) for a Class C drug\n\nSentences can increase if you are dealing drugs or supplying them - even if it's just to friends with no money changing hands.\n\nYouth justice\n\nCannabis\n\nCannabis is illegal. It's a Class B drug.\n\nThe maximum penalty for possession of cannabis is five years imprisonment. A magistrate's court can also impose a fine of up to £2,500.\n\nIf you're prosecuted for supplying or producing an illicit drug, the maximum prison sentence is 14 years.\n\nPsychoactive substances (sometimes mislabelled as legal highs)\n\nIt's an offence to produce, supply or offer to supply any psychoactive substance if the substance is likely to be used for its psychoactive effects.\n\nNicotine, alcohol, caffeine and \"Poppers\" or alkyl nitrites aren't classed as psychoactive substances. Medicine defined by the Human Medicines Regulations (2012) and drugs controlled by the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971) aren't considered psychoactive substances.\n\nPossession of a psychoactive substance in a ‘custodial institution’ (prison, young offender centre, removal centre and so on) will be an offence.\n\nThe importing of a psychoactive substance, which would include buying a psychoactive substance from a non-UK based website, may lead to individuals being prosecuted.\n\nPossessing any psychoactive substance with intent to supply, supplying or offering to supply, producing, importing or exporting, all carry a penalty of either up to six months' imprisonment or a fine, or up to seven years' imprisonment or a fine.\n\nOffences with psychoactive substances could be considered ‘aggravated’ if they involved supply to under 18s, were near a school or a children’s home.\n\nInformation on psychoactive substances\n\nIntent to supply and dealing\n\nSupplying drugs doesn’t just apply to dealers. If police suspect you're going to share drugs with your friends, this is still considered to be supplying.\n\nBeing suspected of supplying drugs means you're likely to be charged. The amount of drugs found on you and whether you have a criminal record, will be taken into account when a punishment is being decided.\n\nThe maximum sentences for intent to supply drugs are:\n\nup to life in prison, an unlimited fine or both for a Class A drug\n\nup to 14 years in prison, an unlimited fine or both for a Class B or Class C drug\n\nOther restrictions\n\nIf you're found guilty of a drug offence, this could affect your future. You might not be able to follow the career you want. Some countries won't let you in even as a tourist, if you're convicted for a drug offence."
