        "text": "Are there any exceptions to automatic deportation?\n\nWhere condition 1 and 2 is met, a deportation order will always be made by the Home Secretary unless certain exceptions apply. These include:\n\nWhere the removal of an individual would breach their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights or the UK’s obligations under the Refugee Convention.\n\nWhere the Home Secretary believes that the individual was under the age of 18 on the date of conviction.\n\nWhere the individual is subject to extradition proceedings.\n\nWhere a hospital order, guardianship order, hospital direction or transfer direction under the Mental Health Act 1983 has effect.\n\nWhere the Home Secretary thinks that removal would contravene the UK’s obligations under the Council of Europe Convention or Action against Trafficking in Human Beings.\n\nNon automatic deportation of foreign nationals\n\nIf a foreign national does not meet the automatic deportation threshold, consideration will be given as to whether deportation should be pursued under the Immigration Act 1971 because it would be conducive to the public good.\n\nOne of the following criteria would need to be met before a deportation order could be made:\n\nA recommendation for deportation by a court empowered to do so;\n\nThe individual has received a custodial sentence of any length for a serious drug offence or gun crime;\n\nThe individual has committed a crime and received a custodial sentence of 12 months or more, made up of aggregate or consecutive sentences;\n\nThe individual is deemed to be a persistent offender;\n\nThe individual has been sentenced to less than 12 months imprisonment but the Secretary of State considers that the offence has caused serious harm either in the UK or in another country.\n\nDecision makers will also take into account:\n\nCautions – Police cautions can be taken into account when considering whether deportation is conducive to the public good.\n\nPrevious convictions – All previous convictions can be considered.\n\nSerious harm offences – The Secretary of State has the discretion to consider whether an offence has caused serious harm. Such an offence may have resulted in a sentence of less than 12 months but may still be grounds on which to pursue deportation.\n\nDeportation of EEA nationals\n\nThe deportation of European Economic Area (EEA) nationals is currently restricted by European law.\n\nThe ‘Free Movement Directive’ sets out the circumstances in which an EEA national may be expelled but does not specify any particular sentence thresholds that would apply. It requires that deportation must be proportionate and based exclusively on the personal conduct of the individual concerned and the ‘level of threat’ that they pose to public policy or public security. Further information can be found on our EU nationals coming to and staying in the UK page.\n\nAn individual cannot be deported solely on the grounds of their previous criminal convictions and further grounds would need to be given in order to justify the deportation of an EEA national who has resided in a Member State for over five or ten years.\n\nThis may be subject to change when Britain leaves the EU in 2019.\n\nDeportation under the Early Removal Scheme (ERS)\n\nThe Early Removal Scheme (ERS) is a scheme operated by the Ministry of Justice which allows the Secretary of State to remove prisoners who are liable for deportation early (i.e. before they reach their normal release date). This is not a voluntary arrangement and all determinate sentenced foreign national prisoners who have been confirmed as liable for removal, irrespective of sentence length, offence type or country or original, will be considered under this scheme.\n\nThe prison governor is responsible for authorising or refusing early removal and generally there are very few reasons why a governor would refuse (for example if an individual had outstanding criminal charges in the UK).\n\nIf you’re removed early under the ERS, there is no requirement for you to serve the remaining period of your sentence in custody in the country you’ve been removed to.\n\nHow long does a deportation order last for?\n\nWhen somebody has been deported after being convicted and sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less than four years, the Home Office states that an application for leave to enter the UK will only be considered ten years after the date the order was made.\n\nIn the case of an individual who has been convicted and sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least four years, it is considered that the deportation order will remain in place indefinitely.\n\nThe decision to make a deportation order\n\nIf it’s decided that deportation is appropriate then a deportation order will be served, setting out why your presence in non-conducive to the public good. The notice will contain details of all the information held by the Home Office on your circumstances at the time the decision was made.\n\nThe decision will state that you can, if you wish, make representation within 20 working days as to why you shouldn’t be deported.\n\nAppealing a deportation decision\n\nA deportation order cannot be made if deportation would be contrary to the UK’s obligations under the UN Refugee Convention or the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nWhen hearing an appeal against a deportation order following a conviction, tribunals and courts must have regard to the considerations listed in section 117c of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.\n\nThe first issue to be addressed relates to public interest. Namely:\n\nThe deportation of a foreign national is in the public interest\n\nThe more serious the offence committed by a foreign national, the greater is the public interest in deporting them.\n\nException 1\n\nYou have been lawfully resident in the UK for most of your life\n\nYou are socially and culturally integrated in the UK, and\n\nThere would be very significant obstacles to your integration into the country to which it is proposed that you are deported.\n\nException 2\n\nYou have a genuine and subsisting relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting relationship with a qualifying child and the effect of your deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.\n\nWhat would constitute ‘compelling circumstances’?\n\nThe Supreme Court has suggested that there are a number of factors which would constitute compelling circumstances. These include:\n\nHow integrated into UK society the individual is in terms of family, employment etc;\n\nThe quality of the individual’s relationship with any child, partner or other family member in the UK;\n\nThe extent to which any relationship with family members might reasonably be sustained after deportation, for example by having family members move overseas;\n\nThe impact of deportation on the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of any child in the UK;\n\nThe likely strength of the obstacles to an individual’s integration into society in the country of nationality;\n\nAny significant risk of an individual re-offending in the UK.\n\n‘Deport first, appeal later’\n\nFollowing an amendment to the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 in 2014, a new section was included which provided the Home Secretary with the power to remove an individual from the UK pending their deportation appeal. This meant that appeals could only be pursued after deportation.\n\nHowever in 2017, the Supreme Court found the practice unlawful [R (on the application of Kiarie) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC], meaning that the Home Office can no longer rely on the ‘deport first, appeal later’ provision. Any appeal against a decision affecting a person’s family and private life can only now be brought from within the UK.\n\nRevoking a deportation order\n\nAll the time a deportation order remains in force, you will be unable to return to the UK. You can apply for the order to be revoked but whether or not this will happen depends on the circumstances of the case.\n\nImmigration rules state that an application for the revocation of a deportation order will be considered based on:\n\nThe grounds on which the order was made;\n\nAny representations made in support of the revocation;\n\nThe interests of the community, including the maintenance of an effective immigration control;\n\nThe interests of the applicant, including any compassionate circumstances.\n\nMaking representation\n\nIf you make no representation then a decision to deport you will be based on the information the Home Office have available.\n\nIf you take the opportunity to make representation as to why you should not be deported, these will be fully considered. The burden of proof is on you to show why the impact of deportation would breach the Refugee Convention or your human rights, you will need to provide evidence of this impact. Less weight will be given to any representations which cannot be substantiated.\n\nUseful links\n\nBelow you will find links to useful websites relating to this page. More specific details (including addresses and telephone numbers) of some of the organisations listed below can be found here.\n\nHome Office – A Government department responsible for immigration, security and law and order\n\nfreemovement – What does “unduly harsh” mean in deportation cases?\n\nMore information\n\nFor practical information – More information can be found on our section on housing and living in the UK\n\nQuestions – If you have any questions about this, you can contact our helpline.\n\nGet involved\n\nHelp us to add value to this information.
