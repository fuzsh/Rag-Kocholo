        "text": "You may file a complaint with the IC3 if you believe you have been the victim of an Internet crime or if you want to file on behalf of another person you believe has been such a victim.\n\nInternet crime includes any illegal activity involving one or more components of the Internet, such as websites, chat rooms, and/or email. Internet crime involves the use of the Internet to communicate false or fraudulent representations to consumers. These crimes may include, but are not limited to, advance-fee schemes, non-delivery of goods or services, computer hacking, or employment/business opportunity schemes.\n\nAfter you file a complaint with the IC3, the information is reviewed by an analyst and forwarded to federal, state, local, or international law enforcement or regulatory agencies with jurisdiction, as appropriate. The IC3 does not conduct investigations and, therefore, is not able to provide the investigative status of a previously filed complaint. Investigation and prosecution is at the discretion of the receiving agencies.\n\nOnce you file a complaint with the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), you will receive the following message at the top of your filed complaint:\n\nThank you for submitting your complaint to the IC3. Please save or print a copy for your records. This is the only time you will have to make a copy of your complaint.\n\nIC3 does not collect evidence regarding complaints. While you may cut and paste information into your complaint (e.g., email headers), you must be sure to keep all original documents in a secure location. In the event that a law enforcement or regulatory agency opens an investigation, they may request the information directly from you.\n\nIt is important that you keep any evidence you may have related to your complaint. Evidence may include, but is not limited to, the following:\n\nCanceled checks\n\nCredit card receipts\n\nMoney order receipts\n\nCertified or other mail receipts\n\nWire receipts\n\nVirtual currency receipts\n\nPre-paid card receipts\n\nEnvelopes (if you received items via FedEx, UPS, or U.S. Mail)\n\nFacsimiles\n\nPamphlets or brochures\n\nPhone bills\n\nPrinted or preferably electronic copies of emails (if printed, include full email header information)\n\nPrinted or preferably electronic copies of web pages\n\nHard drive images\n\nPCAP files containing malicious network traffic\n\nNetwork, host system, and/or security appliance logs\n\nCopies of malware\n\nChat transcripts and/or telephony logs\n\nKeep items in a safe location in the event you are requested to provide them for investigative or prosecutive evidence.\n\nAfter you file a complaint with the IC3, the information is reviewed by an analyst and forwarded to federal, state, local, or international law enforcement or regulatory agencies with jurisdiction, as appropriate. As investigation and prosecution is at the discretion of the receiving agencies, please contact local law enforcement directly if you believe your matter is time sensitive."
