        "text": "The UK sanctions regime\n\nThe UK sanctions regime can apply to persons and entities where the UK government has:\n\nimposed sanctions unilaterally\n\nimplemented sanctions imposed by the United Nations (UN)\n\nThe Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 provides the main legal basis for the UK to impose, update and lift sanctions.\n\nSome sanctions measures apply through other legislation, such as the Immigration Act 1971, the Export Control Order 2008 and the Terrorist Asset-Freezing etc. Act 2010.\n\nThe sanctions regime imposes serious and extensive restrictions on dealing with people who are listed. Under the legislation they’re referred to as “designated persons”.\n\nThe law restricts you from:\n\nreceiving payment from or making funds available to persons on the sanctions list\n\ndealing with their economic resources\n\nmaking even legitimate payments to those persons\n\nOn 22 February 2024, the UK government published its first sanctions strategy: deter, disrupt and demonstrate.\n\nThe strategy sets out how sanctions are used as a foreign and security policy tool.\n\nCriminal offences under the sanctions regime\n\nThe Terrorist Asset Freezing etc. Act 2010 created a series of criminal offences. It prohibits:\n\ndealing with the funds of designated persons\n\nmaking funds, financial services or economic resources available, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of designated persons\n\nAdditionally, you must not knowingly and intentionally participate in activities that would directly or indirectly circumvent these financial restrictions or enable or facilitate the commission of any of the above offences.\n\nA consolidated list of designated persons is available on GOV.UK.\n\nYou can act for someone who’s on the sanctions list, but you must have a licence from the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) in advance of engaging in any dealing with funds or economic resources, including being paid your fees or any funds on account.\n\nWhere a specific licence is needed, OFSI strongly encourages firms to apply for a licence in advance of providing substantive legal services, in order to have certainty as to the fees that will be recoverable.\n\nIf a general licence applies to your work you should make sure you comply with any conditions under that licence.\n\nDoing a sanctions risk assessment\n\nWhen you carry out your firm’s anti-money laundering (AML) risk assessment, you should consider how likely it is that your clients may be on the sanctions lists.\n\nIt’s difficult to categorise the clients that may need to be checked simply by their nationality or country of residence.\n\nUK nationals and UK residents can be on the sanctions lists, so you may still be at risk even if you only act for local clients.\n\nThe regimes list can help you assess risk but bear in mind there may be some retainers where it’s not immediately apparent that a person or entity may have some connection to a relevant regime.\n\nYou cannot limit your risk assessment to the work regulated under the Money Laundering Regulations 2017.\n\nExamples of unregulated work that the sanctions regime may affect include:\n\npayment of personal injuries settlements\n\nproperty settlements following a divorce\n\nYou’d also need a licence from OFSI to use legal aid payments for the benefit of a person on the list.\n\nRead more about doing risk assessments\n\nChecking clients against sanctions lists\n\nYou may apply a risk-based approach to setting up a system that checks your clients against the sanctions lists.\n\nFactors that may increase the risk of a person being on the sanctions list, and so increase the reason for checking the list, include:\n\nclients or transactions with links to jurisdictions subject to sanctions, even if the clients are based locally\n\nclients or transactions involving politically exposed persons (PEPs) from jurisdictions subject to sanctions\n\nclients or transactions involving complex corporate structures in jurisdictions with high terrorist financing risks\n\nclients who seem unable to receive funds or send funds from a bank account in their name, for no good reason\n\nIf your firm has a low general risk of working for clients on the sanctions list, but individual clients have higher risks, you can check directly against HM Treasury’s consolidated list by pressing Ctrl+F to do an in-page search.\n\nIf a client comes up as a possible sanctions match, you should review all the client identity information you hold against the sanctions list, to make sure you do not have a false positive identification.\n\nThe UK sanctions list includes information on:\n\nname\n\ndate of birth\n\nnationality\n\npassport or identity card numbers\n\nlast known address\n\nIf your firm has a higher risk of dealing with clients on the sanctions list, you may want to use an e-verifier. These services incorporate the sanctions list into the databases they use to check identity information.\n\nIf you have a high risk of dealing with clients on the sanctions list, you should also have processes in place to help you find out whether key beneficial owners, or the intended recipient of funds from a transaction you’re undertaking, are subject to the restrictions.\n\nSanctions and high-risk jurisdiction lists\n\nYou can check individual clients against the sanctions lists.\n\nThere are also lists of regimes to which financial sanctions have been applied that may provide some assistance in assessing the risk.\n\nSelected sanctions lists\n\nUK – HM Treasury’s consolidated list\n\nUK financial sanctions targets by regime\n\nEU sanctions list\n\nEU regimes sanctions list\n\nUN sanctions list\n\nUS sanctions lists\n\nHigh-risk jurisdictions lists\n\nUK high-risk third countries for AML purposes\n\nFinancial Action Task Force (FATF) high-risk and other monitored jurisdictions\n\nTransparency International corruption perceptions index\n\nThe 'control' test: NBT v Mints\n\nWe've published a joint note with the Bar Council on the sanctions 'control' test in light of the Court of Appeal judgment in NBT v Mints [2023] EWCA Civ 1132.\n\nThe note was prepared before the High Court's judgment in Litasco SA v Der Mond Oil and Gas Africa SA [2023] EWHC 2866 (Comm) and the publication of the government guidance on ownership and control: public officials and control.\n\nThese provide some additional guidance relevant to the assessment of control issues, although the substantial uncertainty highlighted in the join note still remains.\n\nWith the Bar Council, we are actively engaging with OFSI and other stakeholders and have offered our assistance in developing a framework that provides greater certainty and clarity.\n\nDownload our sanctions 'control' test note (PDF 168 KB)\n\nActing for a client on the sanctions list\n\nIf you decide you still want to act, you’ll need to have for a licence from OFSI in advance of engaging in any dealing with funds or economic resources.\n\nYou must:\n\nconsider whether the work you have been asked to do is permissible from a sanctions perspective\n\nin respect of your fees, consider whether a General Licence applies and, if not, contact OFSI to get a licence to deal with the funds\n\nconsider whether you have a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing which requires a suspicious activity report to the National Crime Agency (NCA)\n\nThe last point is important because the sanctions regime applies in addition to reporting obligations under anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing legislation, including the 2011 regulations. For example you’ll need to consider whether to apply enhanced due diligence measures when dealing with a person or entity from a high-risk third country.\n\nThere may be circumstances where a report to the NCA is not required. For example, a person on the sanctions list may be suspected of terrorist involvement but may not have received a benefit from, or been involved in, raising funds for those activities.\n\nThe transaction they may be asking you to undertake could have no involvement with their alleged terrorist activities, for example a divorce or personal injury claim.\n\nEven where you’re satisfied you do not need to make a report to the NCA you must not deal with the resources of the designated person without OFSI’s approval.\n\nYou can discuss the person’s sanctioned status with them without being concerned about tipping off, as the sanctions list is public information.\n\nApply for a licence from OFSI\n\nDisclosure of documents to a third party\n\nIn Aercap Ireland Ltd v AIG and others [2024] EWHC 144 (Comm), the High Court considered whether disclosure of reinsurance documents from a reinsurance broker (a third party) would break UK sanctions because some of the insurers were Russian entities.\n\nButcher J held it would not breach the Russia sanctions regulations (regulations 28 to 29A).\n\nCompliance with a court order to disclose the documents would not constitute the provision of financial services, reinsurance services or any other service, but would be obedience to an order of the court.\n\nEven without an order disclosure, this would not be a sanctions breach.\n\nOffice of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI)\n\nOFSI has the power to grant licences exempting certain transactions from the financial restrictions. It considers requests on a case-by-case basis, to make sure there’s no risk of funds being diverted to terrorism.\n\nIt has also issued general licences that govern certain situations, such as the use of legal aid payments.\n\nYou must contact OFSI even if you decide not to act for a person you know, or have reasonable cause to suspect, is a designated person.\n\nThese changes were introduced by the European Union Financial Sanctions (Amendment of Information Provisions) Regulations 2017.\n\nThe requirements apply to all practices, not just those regulated for AML purposes.\n\nUnder the requirements, an independent legal professional is defined as “a firm or sole practitioner who by way of business provides legal or notarial services to other persons, when providing such services”.\n\nYou’re required to make a report to OFSI if, because of information that has come to you in the course of your practice, you know, or have reasonable cause to suspect, that someone:\n\nhas committed an offence under the financial sanctions and asset freezing regimes or\n\nis a designated person listed in OFSI’s consolidated list of financial sanctions targets\n\nIf you fail to notify OFSI, you’re committing a criminal offence. However, the obligation only applies in respect of information received by relevant businesses on or after 8 August 2017.\n\nWhat you must report\n\nYou must provide:\n\nthe information or other matter on which your knowledge or suspicion is based\n\nany information you hold about the relevant person by which they can be identified\n\n(where relevant) the nature and amount of funds or economic resources you hold for the relevant person\n\nFind out more about how to make a report to OFSI\n\nSign up for OFSI e-alerts\n\nLegal professional privilege\n\nYou do not have to report privileged information.\n\nHowever, you’ll need to state clearly whether privilege applies and what information it applies to. Blanket statements of privilege could be challenged.\n\nOffice of Trade Sanctions Implementation (OTSI)\n\nIn December 2023, the UK government announced the creation of OTSI to:\n\ninvestigate potential breaches of UK trade sanctions\n\nissue civil penalties\n\nrefer cases for criminal enforcement\n\nUK trade sanctions are administered by the Export Control Joint Unit (ECJU) under the Department for Business and Trade.\n\nSanctions on Russia\n\nThis sanctions regime is aimed at encouraging Russia to cease actions destabilising, undermining, or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.\n\nThe Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 came fully into force on 31 December 2020. The regulations are intended to ensure that sanctions relating to Russia continue to operate effectively.\n\nThe regulations have been amended multiple times.\n\nMake sure you are considering the most up-to-date version: the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations 2023.\n\nThe amendments came into force on 30 June 2023.\n\nThe Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) (Amendment) Regulations 2022 came into force on 16 December 2022, introducing:\n\na ban on the direct and indirect provision of auditing, advertising, architectural, engineering, and IT consultancy and design services to a person connected with Russia\n\nprohibition on the provision of trust services to, or for the benefit of, a designated person\n\nprovision of new trust services to, or for the benefit of, a person connected with Russia\n\namendment and expansion of existing restrictions on dealing with securities or money market instruments, and loans and credit arrangements to a person connected with Russia\n\nexpansion of the goods targeted by trade sanctions\n\npublication of a related general licence (GL) INT/2022/2448692 for winding down of certain matters covered by the new restrictions\n\nAmendments laid on 10 February 2022 amended the definition of ‘involved person’ in the criteria which give grounds for a person to be designated.\n\nPersons designated under this regime are included on the UK sanctions list.\n\nCheck the UK sanctions list\n\nServices and goods export ban\n\nOn 30 September 2022, the UK government introduced a package of sanctions in response to Russia declaring the illegal annexation of four regions of Ukraine, violating their territorial integrity and political independence.\n\nThe new services and goods export bans are targeted at vulnerable sectors of the Russian economy.\n\nAlthough the legislation is still to come into effect, the sanctions will prohibit (among other things):\n\nIT consultancy services\n\narchitectural services\n\nengineering services\n\nadvertising services\n\ntransactional legal advisory services\n\nauditing services\n\nA Law Society spokesperson said: \"Law firms withdrew from the Russian market at pace following the invasion.\n\n\"Any UK government proposals should be delivered in lockstep with international partners such as the US and EU.\n\n\"It is important that firms are able to continue to give advice to those looking to divest from the Russian market.\"\n\nOFSI general licence for payment of legal fees: Russia and Belarus\n\nLegal fees owed by individuals and entities designated under the Russia and Belarus sanctions regimes are permitted under general licence INT/2024/4671884 (provided they meet the terms of the licence).\n\nThe Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) general licence runs from 29 April 2024 and will expire at 11.59pm on 28 October 2024.\n\nIt replaces the previous general licence (INT/2022/2252300), which expired on 28 April 2024.\n\nGeneral licence INT/2024/4671884 is made up of:\n\nPart A: fees and expenses incurred pre-designation\n\nPart B: fees and expenses incurred post-designation\n\nKey changes to the general licence include:\n\nresetting the professional legal fees and expenses cap, so fees and expenses incurred under the expired general licence will not count towards these\n\ngreater clarity that:\n\nit may be used to start paying or receiving fees and/or expenses in cases where the total fees and/or expenses will exceed the relevant caps. A specific licence will still be needed for any fees or expenses which exceed the capped amounts\n\nthe two legal fees caps (pre- and post-designation) can be combined, subject to the terms of the licence being met\n\nlegal fees and expenses for cases involving defamation or malicious falsehood are not covered. A specific licence must be obtained if these services are to be offered to a designated person and there will be a presumption against this being granted\n\nReporting and record-keeping requirements have not changed.\n\nDesignated person reporting requirements\n\nOFSI has published information on the reporting requirements for designated persons under the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) (Amendment) (No. 4) Regulations 2023, outlining that:\n\nrelevant firms must inform OFSI of any funds or economic resources they hold for:\n\nthe Central Bank of Russia\n\nthe Russian Ministry of Finance, or\n\nthe Russian National. Wealth Fund\n\ndesignated persons are required to proactively provide details of their UK assets to OFSI (or their worldwide assets if they are UK persons) subject to a bespoke penalty threshold\n\nThe reporting obligations came into force on 26 December 2023.\n\nIt is an offence for a designated person to, without reasonable excuse, fail or refuse to comply with this obligation.\n\nIt is also an offence to, knowingly or recklessly, give information that is false in a material particular.\n\nDesignated persons who are a “United Kingdom” person within the meaning of section 21(2) and (3) of the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 are required to disclose:\n\nany funds or economic resources they own, hold or control, and\n\nthe nature, value and location of those funds or economic resources\n\nregardless of where in the world they are located.\n\nDesignated persons who are not a “United Kingdom” person are required to report under regulation 70A(2) the nature, value and location of the UK funds and economic resources.\n\nThe initial report must be provided within 10 weeks, whichever is later, of:\n\nthe date the legislation comes into force (26 December 2023), or\n\nthe date of designation\n\nThe report should reflect the nature, value and location of the person’s funds and economic resources at the relevant date.\n\nAny later change in financial circumstances must be reported to OFSI as soon as practicable.\n\nDesignated persons must report any funds or economic resource if the value exceeds £10,000.\n\nIf multiple funds or economic resources of the same type – for example, bank accounts, art or jewellery – taken together exceed £10,000, this must also be reported.\n\nOFSI can impose strict liability civil monetary penalties for breaches of regulation 70A.\n\nThe government intends for this measure to be extended to the Belarus regime in “early 2024”.\n\nRead OFSI’s blog on the reporting requirements and financial sanctions FAQs.\n\nSRA guidance on complying with sanctions\n\nThe SRA has published guidance covering:\n\nfinancial sanctions\n\nanti-money laundering\n\nstrategic litigation against public participation (SLAPPs)\n\ncontinuing to act for clients\n\nThe guidance highlights that the SRA is \"commencing a process of spot checks on firms to assess compliance with the financial sanctions regime\".\n\nIt's important that all firms ensure that they immediately review their policies, controls, procedures and sanctions compliance.\n\nTake a look at the SRA's guidance on the Russian conflict and sanctions\n\nThe SRA published further guidance on complying with UK sanctions in November 2022.\n\nThe guide aims to help solicitors and firms comply with the financial sanctions regime. It includes high-risk areas and a framework that firms can put in place to make sure they're compliant.\n\nYou should remember that the sanctions regime applies to all firms – not just those that offer services in scope of the Money Laundering Regulations 2017.\n\nSARs glossary code for sanctioned Russian entities\n\nThe UK Financial Intelligence Unit has introduced a suspicious activity reports (SARs) glossary code, XXSNEXX, to use where you suspect activity is:\n\nconsistent with money laundering, and\n\nlinked to entities sanctioned by the UK, EU, US and other overseas jurisdictions as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nThe Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act has removed the knowledge test from breach offences.\n\nA breach offence will be committed regardless of whether a person had a reasonable basis of suspicion that they were dealing with a frozen asset. This is a shift to the US Office of Foreign Assets Control model of enforcement.\n\nYou must report frozen assets and suspected breaches to the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation using the compliance reporting form.\n\nNon-voluntary breach disclosures will result in larger monetary penalties.\n\nIndicators of sanctions evasion risk\n\nRussian clients communicating changes to the beneficial ownership of their private investment companies (PICs) to non-Russian or dual national family members\n\nRequests to transfer assets between Russian national/dual-national family members\n\nUse of trust arrangements, with circumstances of transfers calling into question whether the original owner retains indirect control or otherwise could retain a benefit from the assets transferred\n\nAssets transferred have usually been shares in companies, both UK and overseas, including both minority and controlling stakes in these businesses\n\nPayments from venture capital and private equity vehicles, many located in offshore jurisdictions or the far east\n\nClients seeking to move all their assets to other financial institutions and closing their accounts in London\n\nClients domiciled in Russia asking whether they can make transfers to their London account\n\nAttempts to purchase sanctioned Russian securities, which have drastically fallen in price\n\nIncreased volume of transaction monitoring alerts resulting from Russian and Ukrainian clients making and receiving larger transfers than is typical\n\nPayments received by UK businesses, often in innovative areas, also with some elements of ownership by Russia nationals\n\nPayments via a fintech with Russian investor nexus\n\nResearch on private equity/venture capital vehicles and some people with significant control/officers of UK businesses showing individuals connected to Russian industry previously subject to sectoral sanctions and on occasion politically exposed persons (PEPs)\n\nRussian high net worth individuals who are already on international sanctions lists (but not UK list) and/or who anticipate that they may become a sanctions target, transferring assets to family members and/or close associates such as employees\n\nChange in address and names for Russian entities one day prior to invasion\n\nChange of ultimate beneficial owners from Russian to other nationalities\n\nCircumvention attempts through open account trade-based money laundering (TBML) typology – for example, increase in third-party open account payments\n\nPurchase, sale, storage or transfer of ownership of artwork or cultural property – see the NCA warning (PDF)\n\nIn May 2024, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) published analysis of the common services that professional enablers provide to sanctioned individuals. This included:\n\nobscuring ownership through shell companies and through client proxies\n\nchannelling funds into desirable assets including real estate, artwork and precious minerals\n\ndiluting ownership stakes to avoid thresholds\n\nRUSI identified 12 recommendations to help sanctions achieve their desired results.\n\nRead RUSI's recommendations\n\nResources to help you and your firm comply\n\nUK Russian sanctions legislation comes into force\n\nUK sanctions on Russia\n\nSRA statement on sanctions compliance\n\nFCA statement on new financial sanctions on Russia\n\nFinancial sanctions FAQs\n\nForeign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) resources\n\nCheck OFSI's frequently asked questions (FAQs) for guidance and technical information on UK sanctions.\n\nThe FAQs cover Russia and the Russian oil services ban, general licensing and the legal services general licence.\n\nWatch a recording of a government briefing on UK sanctions in relation to Russia\n\nCheck the statutory guidance on the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019\n\nRead the notices to exporters\n\nRead the notices to importers\n\nEmail:"
