        "text": "Compliance obligations for corporations doing business in the United Kingdom come from a variety of sources. Some apply universally, such as the UK legislation in respect of bribery and the facilitation of tax evasion. UK legislation in these areas requires corporates to have in place adequate prevention measures. Failure to do so could result in the corporate committing a criminal offence if an employee or other person associated with it commits an act of bribery or facilitates tax evasion (often referred to as failure-to-prevent offences). Other compliance requirements on UK corporates derive from sector-specific regulation.\n\nThe number of regulated sectors in the United Kingdom is high and includes (among others) charities, education, natural resources, construction, financial services, pensions, healthcare, law, social care, transport, gambling, audit, accountancy and actuarial services. Compliance failings are often at the heart of corporate crime and regulatory enforcement action in the United Kingdom. As such, the bodies that enforce the rules (as well as the industry bodies of certain sectors) have sought to provide guidance on what good compliance looks like.\n\nThis chapter considers the available guidance on compliance in respect of bribery and facilitation of tax evasion legislation. The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 (ECCTA) received royal assent on 23 October 2023 and introduced a new offence of failing to prevent fraud that, at the time of writing, is not yet in force. This new offence will bring substantive fraud and false accounting offences within the failure-to-prevent regime. The government has left the door open for the list of offences falling within the scope of the legislation to be updated through secondary legislation at a future date. Further failure to prevent offences may therefore follow.\n\nThe ECCTA has also expanded the scope of the identification principle so that a corporate will be guilty of a ‘relevant offence’ if that offence is committed by a senior manager acting within the actual or apparent scope of their authority. This reform is designed to widen the pool of company officers through whom a route to corporate criminal liability can be established; this had previously presented a challenge for prosecutors.\n\nThis chapter also considers the obligations placed on certain sectors by anti-money laundering regulations in the United Kingdom. In this area, corporates must look to sector-specific publications for guidance on complying with their obligations under the regulations (e.g., the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group Guidance for those in the financial sector). Finally, this chapter considers two regulated sectors – financial services and gambling – and considers the available compliance guidance issued by regulators in those sectors.\n\nCompliance failures: criminal risk\n\nBribery Act 2010, Section 7\n\nThe implementation of the UK Bribery Act 2010 (Bribery Act) represented a significant move away from corporate criminal liability based on the state of mind of a company’s ‘directing mind and will’. The Act introduced an offence under which corporate liability could be established by a ‘failure to prevent’ an act of bribery. Pursuant to Section 7(1) of the Act, a ‘relevant commercial organisation’ commits an offence if a person associated with it bribes another person intending to obtain or retain business, or to obtain an advantage in the conduct of business, for the organisation. It is a complete defence to the offence if the organisation can prove that it ‘had in place adequate procedures designed to prevent persons associated with [the organisation] from undertaking such conduct’.\n\nMinistry of Justice guidance\n\nWhether the procedures are adequate is ultimately a question of fact for the courts; however, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has published guidance for all businesses and sectors to assist with implementing a robust compliance framework – every step of which should be documented. The guidance sets out six key, outcome-focused principles:\n\nProportionate procedures: Procedures should be proportionate to the risk faced by each organisation, taking into account the nature, scale and complexity of that organisation’s activities. The procedures must be clear, practical, accessible and effectively implemented and enforced.\n\nTop-level commitment: There must be a clear and demonstrable commitment to preventing bribery at the most senior levels. Top-level management must involve themselves in anti-bribery procedures, fostering a culture of integrity, and communicate, internally and externally, to ensure that it is known that bribery will never be accepted.\n\nRisk assessment: Organisations should regularly undertake an assessment to evaluate the nature and extent of their bribery risk. This should address external risk (including country, sectoral, transaction, business opportunity and business partnership) and internal risk (including evaluating the sufficiency of employee training, skills and knowledge; bonus culture; gifts and hospitality policy; financial controls; and the tone from the top).\n\nDue diligence: A proportionate and risk-based approach should be taken in respect of applying due diligence to any persons who perform services for or on behalf of the company. Due diligence should address the types of external and internal risks considered in regular risk assessments. This is particularly important with the use of third-party intermediaries.\n\nCommunication: Policies and procedures should be proportionate but well embedded through internal and external communication. There should also be regular training on the policies and procedures.\n\nMonitoring and review: Organisations should keep under close review whether their procedures are still fit for purpose, having regard to any changes to the bribery risk faced or the nature and scale of their business.\n\nSerious Fraud Office guidance\n\nThe Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has published its own guidance on how it will evaluate the effectiveness of an organisation’s compliance programme. The SFO expects all companies, irrespective of individual circumstances, to have some form of risk-based compliance arrangements in place. It is clear that those arrangements must go beyond a ‘paper-based exercise’, be effective and be reviewed regularly. The SFO will look at a company’s compliance programme in the round and assess carefully the programme that was in place at the time of the suspected offence; whether and how the programme has been amended since; and whether it will be amended in the future.\n\nWith reference to the MOJ’s six guiding principles, above, the SFO will use its internal guidance to determine key case decisions, including whether (1) a prosecution is in the public interest, (2) the organisation should be invited to negotiate a deferred prosecution agreement, (3) the organisation has a defence to the corporate offence pursuant to Section 7(1) of the Bribery Act, and (4) the existence or nature of the compliance arrangements is relevant to sentencing considerations. The SFO will assess each case on its own facts, paying particular attention to the company’s risk assessment and steps taken to mitigate the risk.\n\nThe SFO guidance (read closely alongside the MOJ guidance) must be the cornerstone of any UK anti-corruption programme. Organisations should not only refer closely to the relevant guidance when designing their procedures but should also revisit it regularly when reviewing them.\n\nFacilitation of tax evasion risk\n\nCriminal Finances Act 2017, Sections 45 and 46\n\nThe Criminal Finances Act 2017 (CFA) introduced the offences of failure to prevent the facilitation of UK tax evasion and failure to prevent the facilitation of foreign tax evasion. These offences hold a relevant body criminally liable when a person associated with that body commits either a UK tax evasion facilitation offence (pursuant to Section 45) or a foreign tax evasion facilitation offence (pursuant to Section 46).\n\nAs with the Bribery Act offence, compliance-based defences are available, although on first reading the standard appears to vary between the two, owing to differing descriptions of the prevention procedures. Whereas the Bribery Act requires adequate procedures to be in place, under the CFA, the corporate defendant must prove that in all the circumstances, it had reasonable prevention procedures in place. There has been extensive criticism and scrutiny with regard to these seemingly differing standards but a post-legislative House of Lords select committee suggested it be made clear in the relevant guidance that ‘adequate’ is not intended to mean anything stricter than ‘reasonable in all the circumstances’. That said, no change has yet been made to the guidance.\n\nSeparately, and in contrast with the Bribery Act, the CFA also specifically provides for a defence in circumstances where it was reasonable not to have any prevention procedures in place.\n\nFailure to prevent fraud\n\nEconomic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023, Section 199\n\nAs set out above, the ECCTA has introduced the new corporate offence of failing to prevent fraud. At the time of the writing, the offence is expected to be in force by late 2024 or early in 2025.\n\nThe intended purpose of the new offence is to hold organisations to account if they profit from acts of fraud committed by their employees or agents. The offence applies to relevant bodies (corporates and partnerships) that are large organisations (defined by reference to turnover, balance sheet total and number of employees). A relevant body will be criminally liable when a person associated with it commits a relevant fraud offence, intending, whether directly or indirectly, to benefit the relevant body or any person to whom, or to whose subsidiary undertaking, the person provides services on behalf of the relevant body. The relevant fraud offences are:\n\nfraud by false representation (Fraud Act 2006, Section 2);\n\nfraud by failing to disclose information (Fraud Act 2006, Section 3);\n\nfraud by abuse of position (Fraud Act 2006, Section 4);\n\nobtaining services dishonestly (Fraud Act 2006, Section 11);\n\nparticipation in a fraudulent business (Fraud Act 2006, Section 9);\n\nfalse statements by company directors (Theft Act 1968, Section 19);\n\nfalse accounting (Theft Act 1968, Section 17);\n\nfraudulent trading (Companies Act 2006, Section 993); and\n\ncheating the public revenue (common law) or aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of any such offence.\n\nA compliance-based defence of having reasonable prevention procedures in place will be available. In this context, ‘prevention procedures’ means procedures designed to prevent persons associated with the body from committing fraud offences. The MOJ will introduce guidance relevant to that defence prior to the implementation of the offence.\n\nHis Majesty’s Revenue and Customs: Tackling tax evasion\n\nIn September 2017, His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) published guidance in respect of the facilitation of tax evasion offences. HMRC formulated its guidance around the same six principles as those in the MOJ’s Bribery Act guidance. It emphasises the need for bespoke prevention procedures that apply to the corporate’s own circumstances and that even strict compliance with the guidance will not necessarily amount to having reasonable prevention procedures. The guidance makes clear that the company’s self-assessment of its own risks will be key.\n\nMoney Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017, Regulation 86\n\nThe Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (the MLTF Regulations) came into force on 26 June 2017. They are intended to target the gatekeepers of the United Kingdom’s financial system and apply to credit institutions, financial institutions, auditors, insolvency practitioners, external accountants and tax advisers, independent legal professionals, trust or company service providers, estate agents and letting agents, high-value dealers, casinos, cryptoasset exchange providers, custodian wallet providers and art market participants (together, referred to as relevant persons).\n\nRelevant persons are required to have certain measures in place to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing (relevant requirements). There are numerous relevant requirements, including:\n\nconducting a risk assessment that takes appropriate steps to identify and assess the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing to which its business is subject;\n\nestablishing and maintaining policies, controls and procedures to mitigate and manage effectively the risks identified in any risk assessment;\n\nensuring that these policies, controls and procedures apply to all subsidiaries and branches (even when they are not located in the United Kingdom; and\n\ntaking appropriate measures to ensure that relevant employees are made aware of the law relating to money laundering and terrorist financing, and to the requirements of data protection.\n\nPursuant to Regulation 86 of the MLTF Regulations, a person commits an offence if they contravene a relevant requirement that is imposed on them. In deciding whether a corporate has committed an offence, the court will consider whether the corporate followed any relevant guidance, including from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and other supervisory authorities. No offence is committed if a corporate can demonstrate that it took ‘all reasonable steps’ and ‘exercised all due diligence’ to avoid committing an offence.\n\nIn December 2021, National Westminster Bank PLC was fined £264.8 million for failing to comply with requirements under the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 (which were in place prior to the MLTF Regulations). This was the FCA’s first prosecution for money laundering offences.\n\nIt is likely this will remain a focus area for the FCA. On 19 May 2023, Nationwide Building Society announced that the FCA was in the early stages of an investigation into the Society’s anti-money laundering control framework.\n\nJoint Money Laundering Steering Group guidance\n\nThose operating in the financial sector should have regard to the guidance produced by the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group (JMLSG). This is aimed at firms operating under the auspices of the JMLSG’s 14 UK trade association member bodies, in addition to those regulated by the FCA. It is approved by HM Treasury and, therefore, relevant for the offences under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (regulated sector) and Regulation 86 of the MLTF Regulations.\n\nAlthough it is not legally binding, firms will have to stand prepared to justify departures from the guidance, which is in three parts: Part I contains guidance relevant to all firms operating across the United Kingdom’s financial sector, and Parts II and III provide additional sector-specific guidance.\n\nThe focal point of the JMLSG guidance is the responsibility of senior managers (including money laundering reporting officers) to identify, assess and effectively manage money laundering risks across different aspects of their businesses. The JMLSG emphasises that there are many similarities between the strategies adopted by businesses to combat money laundering and other types of financial crime, such as fraud and market abuse, and recommends fostering ‘strong links’ between those responsible for managing and reporting on these various areas of risks.\n\nThe JMLSG guidance is clear that there is no one-size-fits-all approach and that policies and procedures should be proportionate to the size and nature of the relevant business. There are strong parallels with the MOJ’s six principles contained within its Bribery Act guidance.\n\nCompliance failures: regulatory risk\n\nA broad range of regulators in the United Kingdom have taken enforcement action for compliance breaches against those they regulate, including sector-specific regulators such as the FCA and the Gambling Commission (discussed in more detail below). There are also many profession-specific bodies, such as the Financial Reporting Council, the Solicitors Regulation Authority and the General Medical Council.\n\nFinancial Conduct Authority\n\nThe FCA regulates the financial markets and the conduct of around 51,000 financial services firms and financial markets in the United Kingdom. It derives its powers from the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA), which provides a broad range of civil, criminal and disciplinary tools that it can deploy to take action against both individuals and firms that fail to meet the required standards. Part 9A of the FSMA grants the FCA power to set its rules – as set out in the FCA Handbook – and to publish guidance on those rules.\n\nThe FCA’s approach to regulation involves a combination of high-level principles, binding rules relevant to corporate compliance (as set out in the FCA Handbook) and detailed non-binding guidance. The FCA’s Principles for Business, of which there are 12 to date, set out the fundamental obligations that regulated firms are expected to uphold in the conduct of their business and underpin firms’ responsibilities to their clients. Some of the key FCA Principles include that firms must conduct their business with integrity (Principle 1) and due skill, care and diligence (Principle 2) and take reasonable care to organise and control their affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems (Principle 3).\n\nThe high-level FCA Principles provide a basis for the FCA both to supervise a firm’s activities and to commence enforcement action where it considers that there has been a contravention of the Principles. The enforcement action available to the FCA in respect of breaching the Principles or binding rules is wide-ranging and can include, among other things, imposing a financial penalty, issuing a public censure and suspending a firm’s permission to carry on regulated activity.\n\nGuidance\n\nThe FCA also issues FCA Handbook guidance and other materials – including published FCA speeches, generic letters written by the FCA to chief executives in particular sectors, thematic reviews, policy statements and final notices – that provide practical insight and are useful tools for firms to consider in order to supplement and give colour to the high-level FCA Principles. The FCA’s website is a helpful source of information in this respect and aspects of its commentary can provide an indication of the FCA’s current and future supervisory and enforcement priorities.\n\nThe FCA’s Financial Crime Guide also provides guidance in respect of some of the high-level FCA Principles and is designed to help firms establish, implement and maintain effective financial crime policies, systems and controls. In addition, the FCA’s Enforcement Guide complements other FCA guidance as it provides direction on how such guidance can be applied to the FCA Principles. The Enforcement Guide also illustrates the importance of a firm implementing suitably robust systems and controls.\n\nAlthough compliance with FCA rules and Principles is not negotiable, it is vital that firms are also alive to the relevant supporting guidance summarised above. In theory, the guidance is non-binding but the FCA may take available guidance and supporting material into account when either considering or actively pursuing enforcement action. For example, the FCA’s Enforcement Guide states that the relevant guidance could be used by the FCA to assess whether it could have been understood or predicted at the time that the conduct in question fell below the standards required by the FCA Principles. Further, the available guidance could be used to inform a view of the overall seriousness of the breaches – the example given by the FCA is of a situation where a firm effectively fails to consider an FCA ‘Dear CEO’ letter to be relevant to its business – which could in turn lead to a higher financial penalty.\n\nAlthough the standards set by the FCA Principles are necessarily high, the way in which they are achieved can be exercised with a degree of flexibility. Each business is unique, and the FCA is clear that it wishes to encourage firms to apply their judgement about, and take responsibility for, what the Principles mean for them in terms of how they conduct their business.\n\nTo satisfy the standards set out in the FCA Principles, it is essential that the Principles are embedded in a firm’s operational processes. Senior managers must take responsibility for and carefully assess the risks inherent within their firm and ensure that appropriate systems and controls are put in place to mitigate and manage those risks. The steps a firm takes to maintain the required regulatory standards under the Principles must be proportionate to the potential risks, and its systems and controls should be sufficiently robust and adequately tested to ensure that they are effective in practice and that risks are properly managed.\n\nThe FCA’s guidance on how this can be actioned is sometimes referred to as the ‘reasonable predictability test’ or ‘condition of predictability’. Although this is not a legal test to be met in deciding whether there has been a breach of FCA rules, the FCA considers that firms must be able reasonably to predict, at the time of the action concerned, whether the conduct would breach the FCA Principles. The FCA acknowledges that firms may comply with the Principles in different ways and that enforcement action will not be taken unless it was possible to determine at the time that the relevant conduct fell short of their requirements.\n\nGambling Commission\n\nThe Gambling Commission regulates the provision of facilities for gambling in Great Britain, including the National Lottery. It licenses the businesses that offer gambling, and those who are responsible for certain key roles within licensed businesses, and provides them with advice and guidance.\n\nThe Commission derives its powers from the Gambling Act 2005. Under this Act, it is a criminal offence, among other offences, to provide facilities for gambling to persons in Great Britain without a licence or the benefit of an applicable exception. The Commission has the power to investigate whether an offence has been committed and may institute criminal proceedings against anyone found to be in breach. According to the Commission’s policy on licensing, compliance and enforcement under the Gambling Act 2005, as a general rule the Commission will not normally pursue a criminal investigation into the activities of a licensed operator, as it considers that, in most cases, the matter is likely to be capable of being dealt with by the exercise of the Commission’s regulatory powers. The Commission is very proactive in exercising its regulatory powers and conducts regular compliance assessments of its licensees. Since 2018, there have been numerous cases of the Commission exercising its regulatory powers against licensees and it has imposed significant penalties. During the year ending 31 December 2023, 13 gambling businesses paid a total of £41 million in financial penalties and regulatory settlements.\n\nThe licence conditions and codes of practice (LCCP), issued from time to time by the Commission, embody the general conditions and codes of practice to which licensed operators are required to adhere. The codes of practice fall into two categories:\n\nsocial responsibility code provisions (SRCPs), which have the force of licence conditions, and any breach of them may result in the exercise of the Commission’s regulatory powers; and\n\nordinary code provisions (OCPs), which do not have the force of licence conditions but outline good practice.\n\nThat said, OCPs are admissible in evidence in criminal or civil proceedings and may be taken into account (1) in any case in which the court or tribunal consider them to be relevant, and (2) by the Commission in the exercise of its functions.\n\nThe obligations of licensees under the LCCP are wide-ranging and cover areas such as the appointment of qualified persons, technical standards and testing, protection of customer funds, fair and open terms and practices, anti-money laundering, age and identity verification, information requirements and reporting, marketing and compliance with advertising codes, and the protection of children and other vulnerable persons (including customer interaction and self-exclusion).\n\nGuidance\n\nThe Commission publishes large volumes of guidance on its website, intended to assist licensed operators to design and implement effective policies, procedures and controls and meet their compliance obligations. Key examples include guidance:\n\nto remote and non-remote casinos and, separately, to (non-casino) gambling businesses on the prevention of money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism;\n\non customer interaction;\n\non information to lottery players;\n\non high-value customers;\n\non fair and transparent terms and practices; and\n\non policies, procedures and controls for handling customer complaints.\n\nThe Commission’s guidance is a mixture of specific directions outlining the Commission’s expectations and more flexible, outcome-focused guidance, which anticipates a degree of discretion with regard to how compliance obligations are met. Although the vast majority of guidance on the Commission’s website is not legally binding, certain licence conditions and SRCPs of the LCCP do require licensees to take account of certain Commission guidance, including (among other guidance) in respect of the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing (Licence Condition 12.1.1), customer interaction (SRCP 3.4.1 and SRCP 3.4.3), information to lottery players (SRCP 4.3.3), high-value customer incentives (SRCP 5.1.1) and customer complaints (SRCP 6.1.1).\n\nWhen conducting compliance assessments, depending on the scope of the assessment, the Commission expects licensees to be able to provide evidence that relevant guidance has been taken into account, including by demonstrating that the relevant guidance has been referred to in current versions of all applicable policies and procedures.\n\nThe Commission has broad powers to commence a review of a licence, including where it (1) has reason to suspect that activities may have been carried on in purported reliance on the licence but not in accordance with a condition of the licence, or (2) for any reason, suspects that the licensee may be unsuitable to carry on the licensed activities or thinks that a review would be appropriate. Following a review, the Commission may take no action, provide advice regarding conduct or apply one or more sanctions, including giving the holder of the licence a warning, attaching an additional condition to the licence, removing or amending a condition attached to the licence, suspending the licence, revoking the licence or imposing a financial penalty. It may also suspend the licence in other circumstances, including if at the time of deciding to conduct a review, or at any time during the course of a review, it suspects that a licensed activity is being, or has been, carried on in a manner that is inconsistent with the licensing objectives, a condition of the licence has been breached, the licensee has failed to cooperate with a review or the licensee is unsuitable to carry on the licensed activities. Alternatively, the Commission may agree to resolve a licence review by way of a regulatory settlement with the licensee.\n\nIn determining the appropriate outcome, the Commission will have regard to its policy on licensing, compliance and enforcement under the Gambling Act 2005 and its statements of principles for licensing and regulation and for determining financial penalties; however, its current policies are not prescriptive, and the method by which financial penalties (for example) are calculated is somewhat opaque.\n\nThe Commission expects compliance to sit at the heart of a licensee’s businesses. This may seem obvious, but the Commission expects licensees to be able to demonstrate this and will test for it during compliance assessments by looking carefully at a licensee’s corporate governance framework. It expects to see clear reporting lines and allocation of responsibility and regular reporting between senior management and those responsible for the relevant specified management offices. At the conclusion of a licence review, if the Commission considers that breaches of licence conditions have occurred, it is not uncommon for it to subsequently review the personal management licences held by one or more of the individuals occupying relevant specified management positions.\n\nEffective corporate governance and the implementation of policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of their licences, and controls to monitor their effectiveness, are, therefore, critical for all licensed operators. To address this issue, taking into account the size and nature of their business (and occasionally at the request of the Commission), a number of licensees have established formal compliance committees to ensure that:\n\npolicies and procedures are regularly updated, including to reflect regulatory changes or the publication of new or updated guidance;\n\nadequate staff training is provided (both induction and refresher sessions); and\n\nthe board is informed of any compliance issues, developments and remedial action required.\n\nIn addition, licensed businesses often establish internal audit functions to identify, and prioritise remediation of, any gaps in compliance. Sometimes, a licensed business will outsource the audit of its compliance framework (in some cases in accordance with a condition attached to a licence by the Commission following a licence review). The Commission’s expectations in this regard are clear: it expects its licensees to dedicate adequate resources to compliance and to put regulatory and commercial objectives on an equal footing.\n\nThe preparation and maintenance of an effective risk assessment is a licence condition and a hallmark of an effective compliance framework. Licensees must ensure that the assessment is appropriate and review it as necessary in light of changes in circumstances (e.g., the introduction of new products or technology, new methods of payment by customers, changes in the customer demographic or any other material changes) and, in any event, at least annually. In line with the requirements under the LCCP, the Commission expects to see evidence of any risks identified in the assessment being addressed in the policies and procedures designed to mitigate those risks. Along with relevant guidance that the Commission publishes, the Commission also expects licensees to demonstrate that they have taken account of the Commission’s own assessments of the money laundering and terrorist financing risks within the British gambling industry.\n\nCompliance programme fundamentals\n\nCompliance requires not only regard to the letter of the law and other rules but also to various forms of applicable guidance. This guidance, although helpful, is easily changed or updated, which increases the burden on those subject to it to ensure they remain up to date. In some cases, there is an almost overwhelming amount of guidance to keep on top of, whereas in others (e.g., the Bribery Act), there is very little.\n\nAlthough each piece of guidance is unique, there are recurring themes. Procedures must be proportionate to the level of risk faced. This means different things in different contexts but a good place to start is to consider size, complexity, sector, customer profile, geographical location, business partners, employee skill levels and financial controls. A good risk assessment is a living document that should be reviewed regularly and updated when the risk profile changes.\n\nTo establish whether certain procedures are proportionate, there should be a direct link between the risk assessment and the procedures in place. Corporations should ‘show their workings’, making it clear how their procedures address the risks identified. It is essential to be able to establish that the procedures reflect all relevant and current guidance on the matter.\n\nThe existence of the procedures, however well crafted, offers no protection if they remain the domain of a compliance department. The procedures only offer protection (both in preventing transgressions and in demonstrating compliance despite a transgression) if they are well instituted within the business. This must go significantly further than a page on an intranet site. Staff must be regularly trained on the procedures and understand how they apply in their specific roles. Management must become sponsors of the procedures and demonstrate a clear ‘tone from the top’.\n\nAs the compliance burden looks set to increase further, the financial burden on companies to institute procedures properly increases too. Although it is often said, it does not make it any less true that the costs involved in compliance will nearly always remain good value in comparison to the financial cost of a breach.\n\nEndnotes"
