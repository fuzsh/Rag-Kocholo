Things you need to know\n\nWhat the data measures\n\nThis data measures the number of arrests for 'notifiable offences' â offences for which the police must complete a crime report.\n\nArrest rates are rounded to 1 decimal place. Unrounded data was used to work out arrest rates and differences between ethnic groups.\n\nNot included in the data\n\nThe City of London police force area is not included in the data. This is because of the small number of people living in the area compared with people visiting.\n\nHow arrest rates are calculated\n\nFor each ethnic group, the arrest rate is the number of people arrested for every 1,000 people from that group.\n\nThe ethnic groups used in the data\n\nData for the 3 years from April 2020 to March 2023 uses the 19 ethnic groups from the 2021 Census.\n\nSomeone who is arrested is usually asked for their ethnicity. The circumstances of an arrest may affect the accuracy of this information.\n\nIf ethnicity is not given, it is shown as âunknownâ in the tables. Ethnicity was not given for 12.7% of arrests between April 2022 and March 2023.\n\nIn the 16 years to March 2023, the percentage of people arrested whose ethnicity was not known has varied. It was lowest (2%) between the years ending March 2009 and March 2014, and highest (15%) between the years ending March 2020 and March 2022.\n\nMethodology\n\nRead the detailed methodology document for the data on this page.\n\nData over time is shown from April 2020 to March 2023, using population figures from the 2021 Census to calculate arrest rates. This data is not comparable with previous yearsâ data, which is calculated using population rates from previous censuses.\n\nA person arrested in a particular area may not necessarily live in that area. Population estimates for police force areas are based on permanent residents of that area as reported in the 2021 Census. Read more about problems using Census data to work out rates.\n\nWe use ârelative likelihoodsâ in the data to make comparisons, for example âblack people were over 2 times as likely to be arrested as white peopleâ. You can read more about using relative likelihoods to compare ethnic disparities.\n\nA person arrested for a notifiable offence is counted each time they are arrested. This is as long as the offence is not related to one that happened earlier in the same financial year (April to March). If it is connected, or if a person has been arrested for more than one notifiable offence on the same occasion, the offence with the highest maximum penalty is recorded.\n\nThe Lancashire police force area was unable to submit arrests data in previous years (affecting the 2015 to 2020 data file). For comparability with these years, there is an âAll - excluding Lancashireâ area.\n\nIn the data file\n\nDownload the data for:"
