        "text": "BOSTON – A California man pleaded guilty today in federal court in Boston to surreptitiously filming an 11-year-old Massachusetts girl as she changed in her bedroom.\n\nJacob Guerrero, 23, of Woodland, Calif., pleaded guilty to one count of sexually exploiting a child. Guerrero was previously arrested and charged by criminal complaint on April 14, 2022. U.S. District Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton scheduled sentencing for Nov. 13, 2024.\n\n“Mr. Guerrero is a predator who targeted young children by tracking their moves. Worse, he violated a young girl’s privacy while she was in the safety of her own home, all for his own sexual gratification,” said Joshua S. Levy, Acting United States Attorney. “We are grateful to our law enforcement partners that Mr. Guerrero’s disturbing behavior was stopped and no other children were victimized.”\n\n“Child sexual exploitation cases are among the most disturbing the FBI works. They’re also some of the most impactful,” said Jodi Cohen, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Division. “Today, Jacob Guerrero admitted to depraved behavior. He repeatedly violated children’s privacy and exploited them for his own gratification. In this case, he preyed upon an 11-year-old girl in her own home. Make no mistake, FBI Boston’s Child Exploitation – Human Trafficking Task Force is working hard every day to find and bring to justice anyone actively harming children like this.”\n\nFor two weeks, Guerrero staked out the home of the victim, taking notes of times when she and her siblings showered, changed, and went to bed. On March 17, 2021, Guerrero climbed to the top of a garage attached to the victim’s home and stood just outside the 11-year-old victim’s second floor bedroom window. There, Guerrero recorded a video of the victim, unclothed, as she changed for bed.\n\nGuerrero took similar notes of the comings and goings of the children residing in several other Massachusetts homes.\n\nThis case arose following an investigation into allegations that Guerrero, while dressed in a wig and women’s clothing, attempted to surreptitiously record minor females in bathrooms and changing rooms at the Wrentham Outlets using pen cameras affixed to his shoes. State charges arising from that incident were dismissed when Guerrero was indicted federally.\n\nMembers of the public who have questions, concerns, or information regarding this case should call 617-748-3274.\n\nPursuant to the plea agreement in this matter, Guerrero faces a sentence of 15 to 20 years’ in prison. The charge of sexually exploiting a child provides for a mandatory minimum sentence of at least 15 years and up to 30 years in prison, at least five years and up to a lifetime of supervised release and a fine of $250,000. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and statutes which govern the determination of a sentence in a criminal case.\n\nActing U.S. Attorney Joshua S. Levy, FBI SAC Cohen and Wrentham Police Chief William McGrath made the announcement today. Special assistance was provided by the Norfolk County District Attorney’s Office. Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Grady, Deputy Chief of the Major Crimes Unit, is prosecuting the case."
