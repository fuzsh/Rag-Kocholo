It provides guidance which sentencers are encouraged to take into account wherever applicable, to ensure that there is fairness for all involved in court proceedings.\n\nFor racially or religiously aggravated offences the category of the offence should be identified with reference to the factors below, and the sentence increased in accordance with the guidance at Step 3\n\nStep 1 – Determining the offence category\n\nThe court should determine the offence category with reference only to the factors listed in the tables below. In order to determine the category the court should assess culpability and harm.\n\nCulpability demonstrated by one or more of the following:\n\nA – High culpability:\n\nTargeting of individual(s) by a group\n\nIntention to cause fear of serious violence\n\nSustained incident\n\nUse of substantial force\n\nProduction of weapon\n\nMissiles thrown\n\nB – Lesser culpability\n\nAll other cases\n\nHarm\n\nThe court should consider the factors set out below to determine the level of harm that has been caused or was intended to be caused to the victim.\n\nCategory 1\n\nVictim feared serious violence\n\nFear of violence caused to multiple persons present\n\nIncident escalated into violence\n\nCategory 2\n\nAll other cases\n\nStep 2 – Starting point and category range\n\nHaving determined the category at step one, the court should use the corresponding starting point to reach a sentence within the category range below. The starting point applies to all offenders irrespective of plea or previous convictions.\n\nHarm Culpability A B\n\nCategory 1\n\nStarting point\n\nHigh level community order Starting point\n\nMedium level community order Category range\n\nLow level community order – 26 weeks’ custody Category range\n\nBand C fine – 12 weeks’ custody\n\nCategory 2\n\nStarting point\n\nMedium level community order Starting point\n\nLow level community order Category range\n\nBand C fine – 12 weeks’ custody Category range\n\nDischarge – Medium level community order\n\nFines\n\nStarting point Range Fine Band A 50% of relevant weekly income 25 – 75% of relevant weekly income Fine Band B 100% of relevant weekly income 75 – 125% of relevant weekly income Fine Band C 150% of relevant weekly income 125 – 175% of relevant weekly income Fine Band D 250% of relevant weekly income 200 – 300% of relevant weekly income Fine Band E 400% of relevant weekly income 300 – 500% of relevant weekly income Fine Band F 600% of relevant weekly income 500 – 700% of relevant weekly income\n\nThe court should determine the appropriate level of fine in accordance with this guideline and section 125 of the Sentencing Code, which requires that the fine must reflect the seriousness of the offence and that the court must take into account the financial circumstances of the offender.\n\nWhere possible, if a financial penalty is imposed, it should remove any economic benefit the offender has derived through the commission of the offence including:\n\navoided costs;\n\noperating savings;\n\nany gain made as a direct result of the offence.\n\nThe fine should meet, in a fair and proportionate way, the objectives of punishment, deterrence and the removal of gain derived through the commission of the offence; it should not be cheaper to offend than to comply with the law.\n\nIn considering economic benefit, the court should avoid double recovery.\n\nWhere the means of the offender are limited, priority should be given to compensation (where applicable) over payment of any other financial penalty.\n\nWhere it is not possible to calculate or estimate the economic benefit, the court may wish to draw on information from the enforcing authorities about the general costs of operating within the law.\n\nWhen sentencing organisations the fine must be sufficiently substantial to have a real economic impact which will bring home to both management and shareholders the need to comply with the law. The court should ensure that the effect of the fine (particularly if it will result in closure of the business) is proportionate to the gravity of the offence.\n\nObtaining financial information: It is for the offender to disclose to the court such data relevant to their financial position as will enable it to assess what they can reasonably afford to pay. If necessary, the court may compel the disclosure of an individual offender’s financial circumstances pursuant to section 35 of the Sentencing Code. In the absence of such disclosure, or where the court is not satisfied that it has been given sufficient reliable information, the court will be entitled to draw reasonable inferences as to the offender’s means from evidence it has heard and from all the circumstances of the case. In setting a fine, the court may conclude that the offender is able to pay any fine imposed unless the offender has supplied financial information to the contrary.\n\nCommunity orders\n\nFor further information see Imposition of community and custodial sentences.\n\nThe seriousness of the offence should be the initial factor in determining which requirements to include in a community order. Offence specific guidelines refer to three sentencing levels within the community order band based on offence seriousness (low, medium and high). The culpability and harm present in the offence(s) should be considered to identify which of the three sentencing levels within the community order band is appropriate. See below for non-exhaustive examples of requirements that might be appropriate in each.\n\nAt least one requirement MUST be imposed for the purpose of punishment and/or a fine imposed in addition to the community order unless there are exceptional circumstances which relate to the offence or the offender that would make it unjust in all the circumstances to do so.\n\nA suspended sentence MUST NOT be imposed as a more severe form of community order. A suspended sentence is a custodial sentence.\n\nCommunity orders can fulfil all of the purposes of sentencing. In particular, they can have the effect of restricting the offender’s liberty while providing punishment in the community, rehabilitation for the offender, and/or ensuring that the offender engages in reparative activities.\n\nA community order must not be imposed unless the offence is ‘serious enough to warrant such a sentence’. Where an offender is being sentenced for a non-imprisonable offence, there is no power to make a community order.\n\nSentencers must consider all available disposals at the time of sentence; even where the threshold for a community sentence has been passed, a fine or discharge may be an appropriate penalty. In particular, a Band D fine may be an appropriate alternative to a community order.\n\nThe court must ensure that the restriction on the offender’s liberty is commensurate with the seriousness of the offence and that the requirements imposed are the most suitable for the offender.\n\nSentences should not necessarily escalate from one community order range to the next on each sentencing occasion. The decision as to the appropriate range of community order should be based upon the seriousness of the new offence(s) (which will take into account any previous convictions).\n\nIn many cases, a pre-sentence report will be pivotal in helping the court decide whether to impose a community order and, if so, whether particular requirements or combinations of requirements are suitable for an individual offender. Whenever the court reaches the provisional view that a community order may be appropriate, it should request a pre-sentence report (whether written or verbal) unless the court is of the opinion that a report is unnecessary in all the circumstances of the case.\n\nIt may be helpful to indicate to the Probation Service the court’s preliminary opinion as to which of the three sentencing ranges is relevant and the purpose(s) of sentencing that the package of requirements is expected to fulfil. Ideally a pre-sentence report should be completed on the same day to avoid adjourning the case. If an adjournment cannot be avoided, the information should be provided to the Probation Service in written form and a copy retained on the court file for the benefit of the sentencing court. However, the court must make clear to the offender that all sentencing options remain open including, in appropriate cases, committal for sentence to the Crown Court.\n\nLow Medium High Offences only just cross community order threshold, where the seriousness of the offence or the nature of the offender’s record means that a discharge or fine is inappropriate\n\nIn general, only one requirement will be appropriate and the length may be curtailed if additional requirements are necessary\n\nOffences that obviously fall within the community order band Offences only just fall below the custody threshold or the custody threshold is crossed but a community order is more appropriate in the circumstances\n\nMore intensive sentences which combine two or more requirements may be appropriate\n\nSuitable requirements might include:\n\nAny appropriate rehabilitative requirement(s)\n\n40 – 80 hours of unpaid work\n\nCurfew requirement for example up to 16 hours per day for a few weeks**\n\nExclusion requirement, for a few months\n\nProhibited activity requirement\n\nSuitable requirements might include:\n\nAny appropriate rehabilitative requirement(s)\n\n80 – 150 hours of unpaid work\n\nCurfew requirement for example up to 16 hours per day for 2 – 3 months**\n\nExclusion requirement lasting in the region of 6 months\n\nProhibited activity requirement\n\nSuitable requirements might include:\n\nAny appropriate rehabilitative requirement(s)\n\n150 – 300 hours of unpaid work\n\nCurfew requirement for example up to 16 hours per day for 4 – 12 months**\n\nExclusion requirement lasting in the region of 12 months\n\n* If order does not contain a punitive requirement, suggested fine levels are indicated below:\n\nBAND A FINE\n\nBAND B FINE\n\nBAND C FINE\n\n**Note: Changes to the curfew requirements brought in by the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 are set out in the Requirements section in the Overarching Guideline: Imposition of community and custodial sentences, but are not reflected in the ranges above.\n\nCustodial sentences\n\nSentencing flowcharts are available at Imposition of Community and Custodial Sentences definitive guideline.\n\nThe approach to the imposition of a custodial sentence should be as follows:\n\n1) Has the custody threshold been passed?\n\nA custodial sentence must not be imposed unless the offence or the combination of the offence and one or more offences associated with it was so serious that neither a fine alone nor a community sentence can be justified for the offence.\n\nThere is no general definition of where the custody threshold lies. The circumstances of the individual offence and the factors assessed by offence-specific guidelines will determine whether an offence is so serious that neither a fine alone nor a community sentence can be justified. Where no offence specific guideline is available to determine seriousness, the harm caused by the offence, the culpability of the offender and any previous convictions will be relevant to the assessment.\n\nThe clear intention of the threshold test is to reserve prison as a punishment for the most serious offences.\n\n2) Is it unavoidable that a sentence of imprisonment be imposed?\n\nPassing the custody threshold does not mean that a custodial sentence should be deemed inevitable. Custody should not be imposed where a community order could provide sufficient restriction on an offender’s liberty (by way of punishment) while addressing the rehabilitation of the offender to prevent future crime.\n\nFor offenders on the cusp of custody, imprisonment should not be imposed where there would be an impact on dependants which would make a custodial sentence disproportionate to achieving the aims of sentencing.\n\n3) What is the shortest term commensurate with the seriousness of the offence?\n\nIn considering this the court must NOT consider any licence or post sentence supervision requirements which may subsequently be imposed upon the offender’s release.\n\n4) Can the sentence be suspended?\n\nA suspended sentence MUST NOT be imposed as a more severe form of community order. A suspended sentence is a custodial sentence. Sentencers should be clear that they would impose an immediate custodial sentence if the power to suspend were not available. If not, a non-custodial sentence should be imposed.\n\nThe following factors should be weighed in considering whether it is possible to suspend the sentence:\n\nThe imposition of a custodial sentence is both punishment and a deterrent. To ensure that the overall terms of the suspended sentence are commensurate with offence seriousness, care must be taken to ensure requirements imposed are not excessive. A court wishing to impose onerous or intensive requirements should reconsider whether a community sentence might be more appropriate.\n\nPre-sentence report\n\nWhenever the court reaches the provisional view that:\n\nthe custody threshold has been passed; and, if so\n\nthe length of imprisonment which represents the shortest term commensurate with the seriousness of the offence;\n\nthe court should obtain a pre-sentence report, whether verbal or written, unless the court considers a report to be unnecessary. Ideally a pre-sentence report should be completed on the same day to avoid adjourning the case.\n\nMagistrates: Consult your legal adviser before deciding to sentence to custody without a pre-sentence report.\n\nSuspended Sentences: General Guidance\n\ni) The guidance regarding pre-sentence reports applies if suspending custody.\n\nii) If the court imposes a term of imprisonment of between 14 days and 2 years (subject to magistrates’ courts sentencing powers), it may suspend the sentence for between 6 months and 2 years (the ‘operational period’). The time for which a sentence is suspended should reflect the length of the sentence; up to 12 months might normally be appropriate for a suspended sentence of up to 6 months.\n\niii) Where the court imposes two or more sentences to be served consecutively, the court may suspend the sentence where the aggregate of the terms is between 14 days and 2 years (subject to magistrates’ courts sentencing powers).\n\niv) When the court suspends a sentence, it may impose one or more requirements for the offender to undertake in the community. The requirements are identical to those available for community orders, see the guideline on Imposition of Community and Custodial Sentences.\n\nv) A custodial sentence that is suspended should be for the same term that would have applied if the sentence was to be served immediately.\n\nThe table below contains a non-exhaustive list of additional factual elements providing the context of the offence and factors relating to the offender. Identify whether any combination of these, or other relevant factors, should result in an upward or downward adjustment from the sentence arrived at so far.\n\nFactors increasing seriousness\n\nStatutory aggravating factors:\n\nPrevious convictions\n\nEffective from: 01 October 2019\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence\n\nGuidance on the use of previous convictions\n\nThe following guidance should be considered when seeking to determine the degree to which previous convictions should aggravate sentence:\n\nSection 65 of the Sentencing Code states that:\n\n(1) This section applies where a court is considering the seriousness of an offence (“the current offence”) committed by an offender who has one or more relevant previous convictions.\n\n(2) The court must treat as an aggravating factor each relevant previous conviction that it considers can reasonably be so treated, having regard in particular to— (a) the nature of the offence to which the conviction relates and its relevance to the current offence, and (b) the time that has elapsed since the conviction.\n\n(3) Where the court treats a relevant previous conviction as an aggravating factor under subsection (2) it must state in open court that the offence is so aggravated.\n\nPrevious convictions are considered at step two in the Council’s offence-specific guidelines.\n\nThe primary significance of previous convictions (including convictions in other jurisdictions) is the extent to which they indicate trends in offending behaviour and possibly the offender’s response to earlier sentences.\n\nPrevious convictions are normally of relevance to the current offence when they are of a similar type.\n\nPrevious convictions of a type different from the current offence may be of relevance where they are an indication of persistent offending or escalation and/or a failure to comply with previous court orders.\n\nNumerous and frequent previous convictions might indicate an underlying problem (for example, an addiction) that could be addressed more effectively in the community and will not necessarily indicate that a custodial sentence is necessary.\n\nIf the offender received a non-custodial disposal for the previous offence, a court should not necessarily move to a custodial sentence for the fresh offence.\n\nIn cases involving significant persistent offending, the community and custody thresholds may be crossed even though the current offence normally warrants a lesser sentence. If a custodial sentence is imposed it should be proportionate and kept to the necessary minimum.\n\nThe aggravating effect of relevant previous convictions reduces with the passage of time; older convictions are of less relevance to the offender’s culpability for the current offence and less likely to be predictive of future offending.\n\nWhere the previous offence is particularly old it will normally have little relevance for the current sentencing exercise.\n\nThe court should consider the time gap since the previous conviction and the reason for it. Where there has been a significant gap between previous and current convictions or a reduction in the frequency of offending this may indicate that the offender has made attempts to desist from offending in which case the aggravating effect of the previous offending will diminish.\n\nWhere the current offence is significantly less serious than the previous conviction (suggesting a decline in the gravity of offending), the previous conviction may carry less weight.\n\nWhen considering the totality of previous offending a court should take a rounded view of the previous crimes and not simply aggregate the individual offences.\n\nWhere information is available on the context of previous offending this may assist the court in assessing the relevance of that prior offending to the current offence\n\n, having regard to a) the nature of the offence to which the conviction relates and its relevance to the current offence; and b) the time that has elapsed since the conviction\n\nOffence committed whilst on bail\n\nEffective from: 01 October 2019\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence\n\nSection 64 of the Sentencing Code states:\n\nIn considering the seriousness of any offence committed while the offender was on bail, the court must - (a) treat the fact that it was committed in those circumstances as an aggravating factor and (b) state in open court that the offence is so aggravated.\n\nOffence motivated by, or demonstrating hostility based on any of the following characteristics or presumed characteristics of the victim: disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity\n\nEffective from: 01 October 2019\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence\n\nSee below for the statutory provisions.\n\nNote the requirement for the court to state that the offence has been aggravated by the relevant hostility.\n\nWhere the element of hostility is core to the offending, the aggravation will be higher than where it plays a lesser role.\n\nSection 66 of the Sentencing Code states:\n\nHostility (1) This section applies where a court is considering the seriousness of an offence which is aggravated by—\n\n(a) racial hostility,\n\n(b) religious hostility,\n\n(c) hostility related to disability,\n\n(d) hostility related to sexual orientation, or\n\n(e) hostility related to transgender identity.\n\nThis is subject to subsection (3). (2) The court—\n\n(a) must treat the fact that the offence is aggravated by hostility of any of those types as an aggravating factor, and\n\n(b) must state in open court that the offence is so aggravated.\n\n(3) So far as it relates to racial and religious hostility, this section does not apply in relation to an offence under sections 29 to 32 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (racially or religiously aggravated offences). (4) For the purposes of this section, an offence is aggravated by hostility of one of the kinds mentioned in subsection (1) if—\n\n(a) at the time of committing the offence, or immediately before or after doing so, the offender demonstrated towards the victim of the offence hostility based on—\n\n(i) the victim’s membership (or presumed membership) of a racial group,\n\n(ii) the victim’s membership (or presumed membership) of a religious group,\n\n(iii) a disability (or presumed disability) of the victim,\n\n(iv) the sexual orientation (or presumed sexual orientation) of the victim, or (as the case may be)\n\n(v) the victim being (or being presumed to be) transgender, or\n\n(b) the offence was motivated (wholly or partly) by—\n\n(i) hostility towards members of a racial group based on their membership of that group,\n\n(ii) hostility towards members of a religious group based on their membership of that group,\n\n(iii) hostility towards persons who have a disability or a particular disability,\n\n(iv) hostility towards persons who are of a particular sexual orientation, or (as the case may be)\n\n(v) hostility towards persons who are transgender.\n\n(5) For the purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (4), it is immaterial whether or not the offender’s hostility is also based, to any extent, on any other factor not mentioned in that paragraph. (6) In this section—\n\n(a) references to a racial group are to a group of persons defined by reference to race, colour, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origins;\n\n(b) references to a religious group are to a group of persons defined by reference to religious belief or lack of religious belief;\n\n(c) “membership” in relation to a racial or religious group, includes association with members of that group;\n\n(d) “disability” means any physical or mental impairment;\n\n(e) references to being transgender include references to being transsexual, or undergoing, proposing to undergo or having undergone a process or part of a process of gender reassignment;\n\n(f) “presumed” means presumed by the offender.\n\nOther aggravating factors:\n\nPlanning\n\nEffective from: 01 October 2019\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence\n\nEvidence of planning normally indicates a higher level of intention and pre-meditation which increases the level of culpability.\n\nPlanning may be inferred from the scale and sophistication of the offending and/or the role of the offender.\n\nThe greater the degree of planning the greater the culpability\n\nOffence committed against those working in the public sector or providing a service to the public\n\nEffective from: 01 October 2019\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence\n\nThis reflects:\n\nthe fact that people in public facing roles are more exposed to the possibility of harm and consequently more vulnerable and/or\n\nthe fact that someone is working in the public interest merits the additional protection of the courts.\n\nThis applies whether the victim is a public or private employee or acting in a voluntary capacity.\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting where the statutory aggravating factor relating to emergency workers or to those providing a public service, performing a public duty or providing services to the public applies.\n\nLeading role where offending is part of group activity\n\nEffective from: 01 October 2019\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence\n\nThe mere membership of a group (two or more persons) should not be used to increase the sentence, but where the offence was committed as part of a group this will normally make it more serious because:\n\nthe harm caused (both physical or psychological) or the potential for harm may be greater and/or\n\nthe culpability of the offender may be higher (the role of the offender within the group will be a relevant consideration).\n\nCulpability based on role in group offending could range from:\n\nHigher culpability indicated by a leading role in the group and/or the involvement by the offender of others through coercion, intimidation or exploitation, to\n\nLower culpability indicated by a lesser or subordinate role under direction and/or involvement of the offender through coercion, intimidation or exploitation.\n\nCourts should be alert to factors that suggest that an offender may have been the subject of coercion, intimidation or exploitation (including as a result of domestic abuse, trafficking or modern slavery) which the offender may find difficult to articulate, and where appropriate ask for this to be addressed in a PSR.\n\nWhere the offending is part of an organised criminal network, this will make it more serious, and the role of the offender in the organisation will also be relevant.\n\nWhen sentencing young adult offenders (typically aged 18-25), consideration should also be given to the guidance on the mitigating factor relating to age and/or lack of maturity when considering the significance of group offending.\n\nVulnerable persons or children present\n\nEffective from: 01 October 2019\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence\n\nWhere there is risk of harm to other(s) not taken in account at step one and not subject to a separate charge, this makes the offence more serious.\n\nDealing with a risk of harm involves consideration of both the likelihood of harm occurring and the extent of it if it does.\n\nWhere any such risk of harm is the subject of separate charges, this should be taken into account when assessing totality.\n\nWhen sentencing young adult offenders (typically aged 18-25), consideration should also be given to the guidance on the mitigating factor relating to age and/or lack of maturity when considering the significance of this factor.\n\nVictim is targeted due to a vulnerability (or a perceived vulnerability) where not already taken into account in considering racial or religious aggravation\n\nEffective from: 01 October 2019\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence\n\nAn offence is more serious if the victim is vulnerable because of personal circumstances such as (but not limited to) age, illness or disability (unless the vulnerability of the victim is an element of the offence).\n\nOther factors such as the victim being isolated, incapacitated through drink or being in an unfamiliar situation may lead to a court considering that the offence is more serious.\n\nThe extent to which any vulnerability may impact on the sentence is a matter for the court to weigh up in each case.\n\nCulpability will be increased if the offender targeted a victim because of an actual or perceived vulnerability.\n\nCulpability will be increased if the victim is made vulnerable by the actions of the offender (such as a victim who has been intimidated or isolated by the offender).\n\nCulpability is increased if an offender persisted in the offending once it was obvious that the victim was vulnerable (for example continuing to attack an injured victim).\n\nThe level of harm (physical, psychological or financial) is likely to be increased if the victim is vulnerable.\n\nHistory of antagonising the victim\n\nVictim(s) had no opportunity to escape situation (eg: offence occurred on public transport)\n\nCommission of offence whilst under the influence of alcohol/drugs\n\nEffective from: 01 October 2019\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence\n\nThe fact that an offender is voluntarily intoxicated at the time of the offence will tend to increase the seriousness of the offence provided that the intoxication has contributed to the offending.\n\nThis applies regardless of whether the offender is under the influence of legal or illegal substance(s).\n\nIn the case of a person addicted to drugs or alcohol the intoxication may be considered not to be voluntary, but the court should have regard to the extent to which the offender has sought help or engaged with any assistance which has been offered or made available in dealing with the addiction.\n\nAn offender who has voluntarily consumed drugs and/or alcohol must accept the consequences of the behaviour that results, even if it is out of character.\n\nOffence committed whilst on licence or post sentence supervision\n\nEffective from: 01 October 2019\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence\n\nAn offender who is subject to licence or post sentence supervision is under a particular obligation to desist from further offending.\n\nThe extent to which the offender has complied with the conditions of a licence or order (including the time that has elapsed since its commencement) will be a relevant consideration.\n\nWhere the offender is dealt with separately for a breach of a licence or order regard should be had to totality.\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting matters taken into account when considering previous convictions.\n\nWhen sentencing young adult offenders (typically aged 18-25), consideration should also be given to the guidance on the mitigating factor relating to age and/or lack of maturity when considering the significance of this factor.\n\nFailure to comply with current court orders\n\nEffective from: 01 October 2019\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence\n\nCommission of an offence while subject to a relevant court order makes the offence more serious.\n\nThe extent to which the offender has complied with the conditions of an order (including the time that has elapsed since its commencement) will be a relevant consideration.\n\nWhere the offender is dealt with separately for a breach of an order regard should be had to totality\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting matters taken into account when considering previous convictions.\n\nWhen sentencing young adult offenders (typically aged 18-25), consideration should also be given to the guidance on the mitigating factor relating to age and/or lack of maturity when considering the significance of this factor.\n\nFactors reducing seriousness or reflecting personal mitigation\n\nMinor/peripheral role in group activity\n\nEffective from: 01 October 2019\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm\n\nWhereas acting as part of a group may make an offence more serious, if the offender’s role was minor this may indicate lower culpability and justify a reduction in sentence.\n\nNo previous convictions or no relevant/recent convictions\n\nEffective from: 01 October 2019\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm\n\nFirst time offenders usually represent a lower risk of reoffending. Reoffending rates for first offenders are significantly lower than rates for repeat offenders. In addition, first offenders are normally regarded as less blameworthy than offenders who have committed the same crime several times already. For these reasons first offenders receive a mitigated sentence.\n\nWhere there are previous offences but these are old and /or are for offending of a different nature, the sentence will normally be reduced to reflect that the new offence is not part of a pattern of offending and there is therefore a lower likelihood of reoffending.\n\nWhen assessing whether a previous conviction is ‘recent’ the court should consider the time gap since the previous conviction and the reason for it.\n\nPrevious convictions are likely to be ‘relevant’ when they share characteristics with the current offence (examples of such characteristics include, but are not limited to: dishonesty, violence, abuse of position or trust, use or possession of weapons, disobedience of court orders). In general the more serious the previous offending the longer it will retain relevance.\n\nRemorse\n\nEffective from: 01 October 2019 (revised 1 April 2024)\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm\n\nThe court will need to be satisfied that the offender is genuinely remorseful for the offending behaviour in order to reduce the sentence (separate from any guilty plea reduction).\n\nLack of remorse should never be treated as an aggravating factor.\n\nRemorse can present itself in many different ways. A simple assertion of the fact may be insufficient.\n\nThe court should be aware that the offender’s demeanour in court or the way they articulate their feelings of remorse may be affected by, for example:\n\nnervousness\n\na lack of understanding of the system\n\nmental disorder\n\nlearning disabilities\n\ncommunication difficulties (including where English is not their first language)\n\na belief that they have been or will be discriminated against\n\npeer pressure to behave in a certain way because of others present\n\nage and/or a lack of maturity etc.\n\nIf a PSR has been prepared it may provide valuable assistance in this regard.\n\nGuideline users should be aware that the Equal Treatment Bench Book covers important aspects of fair treatment and disparity of outcomes for different groups in the criminal justice system. It provides guidance which sentencers are encouraged to take into account wherever applicable, to ensure that there is fairness for all involved in court proceedings.\n\nPositive character and/or exemplary conduct (regardless of previous convictions)\n\nEffective from: 01 October 2019 (revised 1 April 2024)\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm\n\nEvidence that an offender has demonstrated a positive side to their character may reduce the sentence.\n\nThis factor may apply whether or not the offender has previous convictions.\n\nHowever:\n\nThis factor is less likely to be relevant where the offending is very serious\n\nWhere an offender has used their positive character or status to facilitate or conceal the offending it could be treated as an aggravating factor.\n\nAge and/or lack of maturity (which may be applicable to offenders aged 18-25)\n\nEffective from: 01 October 2019 (revised 1 April 2024)\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm\n\nWhere a person has committed the offence under the age of 18, regard should be had to the overarching guideline for sentencing children and young people. That guideline may also be relevant to offending by young adults.\n\nAge and/or lack of maturity can affect:\n\nthe offender’s responsibility for the offence and\n\nthe effect of the sentence on the offender.\n\nEither or both of these considerations may justify a reduction in the sentence.\n\nThe emotional and developmental age of an offender is of at least equal importance to their chronological age (if not greater).\n\nIn particular young adults (typically aged 18-25) are still developing neurologically and consequently may be less able to:\n\nevaluate the consequences of their actions\n\nlimit impulsivity\n\nlimit risk taking\n\nYoung adults are likely to be susceptible to peer pressure and are more likely to take risks or behave impulsively when in company with their peers.\n\nImmaturity can also result from atypical brain development. Environment plays a role in neurological development and factors such as adverse childhood experiences including deprivation and/or abuse may affect development.\n\nAn immature offender may find it particularly difficult to cope with custody and therefore may be more susceptible to self-harm in custody.\n\nAn immature offender may find it particularly difficult to cope with the requirements of a community order without appropriate support.\n\nThere is a greater capacity for change in immature offenders and they may be receptive to opportunities to address their offending behaviour and change their conduct.\n\nMany young people who offend either stop committing crime, or begin a process of stopping, in their late teens and early twenties. Therefore a young adult’s previous convictions may not be indicative of a tendency for further offending.\n\nWhere the offender is is care experienced or a care leaver the court should enquire as to any effect a sentence may have on the offender’s ability to make use of support from the local authority. (Young adult care leavers are entitled to time limited support. Leaving care services may change at the age of 21 and cease at the age of 25, unless the young adult is in education at that point). See also the Sentencing Children and Young People Guideline (paragraphs 1.16 and 1.17).\n\nWhere an offender has turned 18 between the commission of the offence and conviction the court should take as its starting point the sentence likely to have been imposed on the date at which the offence was committed, but applying the purposes of sentencing adult offenders. See also the Sentencing Children and Young People Guideline (paragraphs 6.1 to 6.3).\n\nWhen considering a custodial or community sentence for a young adult the Probation Service should address these issues in a PSR.\n\nMental disorder or learning disability\n\nEffective from: 01 October 2020\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence\n\nRefer to the Sentencing offenders with mental disorders, developmental disorders, or neurological impairments guideline.\n\nNote in particular paragraph 5 for Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic offenders.\n\nSole or primary carer for dependent relatives\n\nEffective from: 01 October 2019 (revised 1 April 2024)\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm\n\nThis factor is particularly relevant where an offender is on the cusp of custody or where the suitability of a community order is being considered. See also the Imposition of community and custodial sentences guideline.\n\nFor offenders on the cusp of custody, imprisonment should not be imposed where there would be an impact on dependants which would make a custodial sentence disproportionate to achieving the aims of sentencing.\n\nWhere custody is unavoidable consideration of the impact on dependants may be relevant to the length of the sentence imposed and whether the sentence can be suspended.\n\nFor more serious offences where a substantial period of custody is appropriate, this factor will carry less weight.\n\n­When imposing a community sentence on an offender with primary caring responsibilities the effect on dependants must be considered in determining suitable requirements.\n\nThe court should ensure that it has all relevant information about dependent children before deciding on sentence.\n\nWhen an immediate custodial sentence is necessary, the court must consider whether proper arrangements have been made for the care of any dependent children and if necessary consider adjourning sentence for this to be done.\n\nWhen considering a community or custodial sentence for an offender who has, or may have, caring responsibilities the court should ask the Probation Service to address these issues in a PSR.\n\nUseful information can be found in the Equal Treatment Bench Book (see in particular Chapter 6 paragraphs 119 to 125)\n\nPregnancy, childbirth and post-natal care\n\nEffective from: 01 April 2024\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm\n\nWhen considering a custodial or community sentence for a pregnant or postnatal offender (someone who has given birth in the previous 12 months) the Probation Service should be asked to address the issues below in a pre-sentence report. If a suitable pre-sentence report is not available, sentencing should normally be adjourned until one is available.\n\nWhen sentencing a pregnant or postnatal woman, relevant considerations may include:\n\nthe medical needs of the offender including her mental health needs\n\nany effect of the sentence on the physical and mental health of the offender\n\nany effect of the sentence on the child\n\nThe impact of custody on an offender who is pregnant or postnatal can be harmful for both the offender and the child including by separation, especially in the first two years of life.\n\nAccess to a place in a prison Mother & Baby Unit is not automatic and when available, the court may wish to enquire for how long the place will be available.\n\nWomen in custody are likely to have complex health needs which may increase the risks associated with pregnancy for both the offender and the child. The NHS classifies all pregnancies in prison as high risk.\n\nThere may be difficulties accessing medical assistance or specialist maternity services in custody.\n\nThis factor is particularly relevant where an offender is on the cusp of custody or where the suitability of a community order is being considered. See also the Imposition of community and custodial sentences guideline.\n\nFor offenders on the cusp of custody, imprisonment should not be imposed where there would be an impact on dependants which would make a custodial sentence disproportionate to achieving the aims of sentencing.\n\nWhere immediate custody is unavoidable, all of the factors above may be relevant to the length of the sentence.\n\nThe court should address the issues above when giving reasons for the sentence.\n\nDifficult and/or deprived background or personal circumstances\n\nEffective from: 01 April 2024\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm\n\nThe court may be assisted by a pre-sentence report in assessing whether there are factors in the offender’s background or current personal circumstances which may be relevant to sentencing. Such factors may be relevant to:\n\nthe offender’s responsibility for the offence and/or\n\nthe effect of the sentence on the offender.\n\nCourts should consider that different groups within the criminal justice system have faced multiple disadvantages which may have a bearing on their offending. Such disadvantages include but are not limited to:\n\nexperience of discrimination\n\nnegative experiences of authority\n\nearly experience of loss, neglect or abuse\n\nearly experience of offending by family members\n\nbeing care experienced or a care leaver\n\nnegative influences from peers\n\ndifficulties relating to the misuse of drugs and/or alcohol (but note: being voluntarily intoxicated at the time of the offence is an aggravating factor)\n\nlow educational attainment\n\ninsecure housing\n\nmental health difficulties\n\npoverty\n\ndirect or indirect victim of domestic abuse\n\nThere are a wide range of personal experiences or circumstances that may be relevant to offending behaviour. The Equal Treatment Bench Book contains useful information on social exclusion and poverty (see in particular Chapter 11, paragraphs 58 to 71). The Sentencing offenders with mental disorders, developmental disorders, or neurological impairments guideline may also be of relevance.\n\nProspects of or in work, training or education\n\nEffective from: 01 April 2024\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm\n\nThis factor is particularly relevant where an offender is on the cusp of custody or where the suitability of a community order is being considered. See also the Imposition of community and custodial sentences guideline.\n\nWhere an offender is in, or has a realistic prospect of starting, work, education or training this may indicate a willingness to rehabilitate and desist from future offending.\n\nSimilarly, the loss of employment, education or training opportunities may have a negative impact on the likelihood of an offender being rehabilitated or desisting from future offending.\n\nThe court may be assisted by a pre-sentence report in assessing the relevance of this factor to the individual offender.\n\nThe absence of work, training or education should never be treated as an aggravating factor.\n\nThe court may ask for evidence of employment, training etc or the prospects of such, but should bear in mind any reasonable practical difficulties an offender may have in providing this.\n\nFor more serious offences where a substantial period of custody is appropriate, this factor will carry less (if any) weight.\n\nStep 3 – Aggravated offences\n\nRacially or religiously aggravated offences only\n\nHaving determined the category of the basic offence to identify the sentence of a non-aggravated offence, the court should now consider the level of racial or religious aggravation involved and apply an appropriate uplift to the sentence in accordance with the guidance below. The following is a list of factors which the court should consider to determine the level of aggravation. Where there are characteristics present which fall under different levels of aggravation, the court should balance these to reach a fair assessment of the level of aggravation present in the offence.\n\nMaximum sentence for the aggravated offence is 2 years’ custody\n\nCare should be taken to avoid double counting factors already taken into account in assessing the level of harm at step one\n\nHigh level of racial or religious aggravation\n\nSentence uplift\n\nRacial or religious aggravation was the predominant motivation for the offence.\n\nOffender was a member of, or was associated with, a group promoting hostility based on race or religion.\n\nAggravated nature of the offence caused severe distress to the victim or the victim’s family (over and above the distress already considered at step one).\n\nAggravated nature of the offence caused serious fear and distress throughout local community or more widely.\n\nIncrease the length of custodial sentence if already considered for the basic offence or consider a custodial sentence, if not already considered for the basic offence.\n\nMedium level of racial or religious aggravation\n\nSentence uplift\n\nRacial or religious aggravation formed a significant proportion of the offence as a whole.\n\nAggravated nature of the offence caused some distress to the victim or the victim’s family (over and above the distress already considered at step one).\n\nAggravated nature of the offence caused some fear and distress throughout local community or more widely.\n\nConsider a significantly more onerous penalty of the same type or consider a more severe type of sentence than for the basic offence.\n\nLow level of racial or religious aggravation\n\nSentence uplift\n\nAggravated element formed a minimal part of the offence as a whole.\n\nAggravated nature of the offence caused minimal or no distress to the victim or the victim’s family (over and above the distress already considered at step one).\n\nConsider a more onerous penalty of the same type identified for the basic offence.\n\nMagistrates may find that, although the appropriate sentence for the basic offence would be within their powers, the appropriate increase for the aggravated offence would result in a sentence in excess of their powers. If so, they must commit for sentence to the Crown Court.\n\nThe sentencer should state in open court that the offence was aggravated by reason of race or religion, and should also state what the sentence would have been without that element of aggravation.\n\nStep 4 – Consider any factors which indicate a reduction for assistance to the prosecution\n\nThe court should take into account section 74 of the Sentencing Code (reduction in sentence for assistance to prosecution) and any other rule of law by virtue of which an offender may receive a discounted sentence in consequence of assistance given (or offered) to the prosecutor or investigator.\n\nStep 5 – Reduction for guilty pleas\n\nThe court should take account of any potential reduction for a guilty plea in accordance with section 73 of the Sentencing Code and the Reduction in Sentence for a Guilty Plea guideline.\n\nStep 6 (RACIALLY OR RELIGOUSLY AGGRAVATED OFFENCES ONLY) – Dangerousness\n\nThe court should consider whether having regard to the criteria contained in Chapter 6 of Part 10 of the Sentencing Code it would be appropriate to impose an extended sentence (sections 266 and 279).\n\nStep 7 – Totality principle\n\nIf sentencing an offender for more than one offence, or where the offender is already serving a sentence, consider whether the total sentence is just and proportionate to the overall offending behaviour in accordance with the Totality guideline.\n\nStep 8 – Compensation and ancillary orders\n\nIn all cases the court should consider whether to make compensation and/or other ancillary orders.\n\nWhere the offence has resulted in personal injury, loss or damage the court must give reasons if it decides not to order compensation (Sentencing Code, s.55).\n\nIn particular, where the offender is convicted of a relevant offence within Schedule 1 of the Football Spectators Act 1989, the court must consider whether a Football Banning Order should be made pursuant to s14A Football Spectators Act 1989, and if not give reasons why.\n\nAncillary orders – Magistrates’ Court\n\nAncillary orders – Crown Court Compendium\n\nStep 9 – Reasons\n\nSection 52 of the Sentencing Code imposes a duty to give reasons for, and explain the effect of, the sentence.\n\nStep 10 – Consideration for time spent on bail (tagged curfew)\n\nThe court must consider whether to give credit for time spent on bail in accordance with section 240A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and section 325 of the Sentencing Code.\n\nGive feedback about this page\n\nPlease tell us if there is an issue with this guideline to do with the accuracy of the content, how easy the guideline is to understand and apply, or accessibility/broken links.\n\nEmail*\n\nComment*\n\nCAPTCHA\n\nName\n\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged."
