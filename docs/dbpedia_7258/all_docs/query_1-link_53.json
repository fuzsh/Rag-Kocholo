        "text": "The government is reforming the way prisons work in order to improve how they protect the public, keep staff and prisoners safe, and turn from crime. To do this we are holding prison governors to account for improvements in the following areas:\n\nprotecting the public;\n\nmaintaining safety and order;\n\nreforming offenders to prevent more crimes from being committed; and\n\npreparing prisoners for life outside the prison.\n\nNote that Peterborough Female and Peterborough Male are counted as two establishments, but are managed under a single contract. Therefore the number of private prison contracts is one fewer than the number of private prisons shown here.\n\nOakhill Secure Training Centre is listed in the linked publication but not counted here as a prison.\n\nPrisons need to be and feel safe for both staff and prisoners. Violent incidents are the most obvious issue, but this is also about wider culture and atmosphere of the prison and the support it provides to vulnerable prisoners.\n\nTo reform offenders, we need to be sure they are being given the right services and opportunities across the different areas we know support rehabilitation and help prevent a return to crime.\n\nThese include improving prisonersâ€™ mental health and tackling substance misuse, improving prisoners' progress in English and maths and increasing the numbers of offenders in employment and accommodation after release."
