        "text": "Disclaimer: this article is for general information. It’s not intended to be used as legal advice. For information on how to get legal advice, please see our page here or find contact details of law firms with protest law expertise on our bust cards.\n\nThe information on this page was correct as of 2 November 2023. Some of the offences outlined below (and the definition of ‘serious disruption’) came into force on 3 May 2023, while the remaining offences came into force on 2 July 2023.\n\nThe Public Order Act introduces measures that significantly increase the police’s power to respond to protests and put restrictions in place for those taking part in them.\n\nThe Government first tried to introduce many of these measures in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts (“Policing”) Act 2022, but was unsuccessful. The Public Order Act reintroduces them.\n\nWhat is the aim of the Public Order Act?\n\nThe Public Order Act aims to increase the police’s ability to restrict and criminalise protest activity by introducing a range of new powers which allow, among other things, for:\n\nnew and expanded use of stop and search;\n\norders that ban people from participating in protests and control their movement/activity/associations;\n\nnew offences that criminalise certain kinds of protests altogether.\n\nThe Government has explicitly referred to Extinction Rebellion, Just Stop Oil, and Insulate Britain protests as justification for its introduction.\n\nWhat is the existing legal framework?\n\nThe Public Order Act 2023 builds on the existing legal framework governing the policing of protests. This is mainly contained in the Public Order Act 1986, which remains in force. Further changes to this framework were introduced by the Policing Act 2022. You can read more about these changes in our overview.\n\nThis page will focus on the changes introduced by the Public Order Act 2023.\n\nLocking-on\n\n‘Locking-on’ is when protesters attach themselves to other people, objects, or buildings. It is a tactic used throughout history, but the Public Order Act 2023 now makes it a criminal offence. You will be committing this offence when you:\n\nattach yourself to another person, an object or land;\n\nattach a person to another person, an object, or land;\n\nattach an object to another object or to land; and\n\nyour activities cause or can cause ‘serious disruption‘ to two or more people or to an organisation in a public place.\n\nTo commit this offence, you must have intended your acts to cause serious disruption, or you were reckless as to whether your acts would cause serious disruption.\n\nIf convicted, you are punishable with up to six months’ imprisonment, a fine, or both.\n\nThere is a defence of ‘reasonable excuse’ for this offence.\n\nThe first arrests for this offence (reported by Netpol) was of a group of Palestine Action protesters on 1 November 2023, after they chained themselves together at the entrance to Israeli arms company Elbit’s HQ.\n\nCausing ‘serious disruption’ by tunnelling or being present in a tunnel\n\nThese offences criminalise the act of tunnelling, where you:\n\ncreate a tunnel, participate in creating a tunnel, or are present in a tunnel; and\n\ncause or are capable of causing ‘serious disruption’ to two or more people or to an organisation in a place other than a dwelling; and\n\nintend or are reckless as to whether creating or being in a tunnel will cause or be capable of causing ‘serious disruption‘.\n\nIf convicted in a magistrates’ court, these offences are punishable with imprisonment for up to the general limit in a magistrates’ court, a fine, or both. If convicted in a crown court, the maximum penalty is three years’ imprisonment, a fine, or both.\n\nThere is a defence of ‘reasonable excuse’ for this offence. For example, if your presence in the tunnel or creation of the tunnel was authorised by a person who had an interest in the land.\n\nObstructing major transport works\n\nThis offence criminalises behaviour that obstructs or interferes with the construction or maintenance of transport works, such as HS2. You will be committing this offence if you:\n\nobstruct individuals (like construction workers) from constructing or maintaining any major transport works; or\n\ninterfere with, move, or remove apparatus relating to constructing or maintaining major transport works.\n\nIf convicted, you are punishable with up to six months’ imprisonment, a fine, or both.\n\nThere is a defence of ‘reasonable excuse’ for this offence.\n\nInterfering with key national infrastructure\n\nThis offence criminalises behaviour which prevents ‘to any extent’ or ‘significantly’ delays the operation of key infrastructure (including roads, railways, airports, harbours, oil & gas or electricity generation infrastructure or newspaper printing) in England and Wales. There is a list of key national infrastructure specified in the Act, which can be added to by the Secretary of State.\n\nYou will be committing this offence if you:\n\ntake action that interferes with the use or operation of key national infrastructure; and\n\nintend or are reckless as to whether your actions will interfere with the use or operation of key national infrastructure.\n\nIf convicted in a magistrates’ court, you are punishable with imprisonment for up to the general limit in a magistrates’ court (six months), a fine, or both. If convicted in a crown court, you are punishable with up to 12 months’ imprisonment, a fine, or both.\n\nThere is a defence of ‘reasonable excuse’ for this offence.\n\nThis offence has been used to arrest Just Stop Oil protesters on 1 November 2023 and charge them on 2 November 2023.\n\nLiberty is the trading name of The National Council for Civil Liberties, registered in England and Wales number 03260840.
