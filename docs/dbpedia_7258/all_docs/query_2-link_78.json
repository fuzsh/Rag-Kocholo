        "text": "The Criminal Apprehension Program (CAP) supports U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) in executing its mission to protect the homeland through the arrest and removal of noncitizens who threaten the safety of our nation’s communities and the integrity of U.S. immigration laws. CAP focuses on the identification, arrest, and removal of Incarcerated noncitizens at federal, state, and local levels, as well as at-large criminal noncitizens.\n\nThrough CAP, ERO takes criminal noncitizens into custody in a controlled environment, decreasing risks to officers, noncitizens, and the community. When ERO directly assumes custody of a criminal through CAP, it prevents the individual from being released back into the community where they may re-offend.\n\nKey Initiatives\n\nEvery day, ICE places detainers on noncitizens who the agency has probable cause to believe are amenable for removal from the U.S. and are currently in federal, state or local law enforcement agency custody.\n\nHowever, some jurisdictions elect to minimally cooperate with ERO’s law enforcement efforts while other jurisdictions have ceased to cooperate altogether\n\nSome jurisdictions do not honor immigration detainers — even for noncitizens who have been convicted of serious crimes\n\nCooperation between ICE and state and local law enforcement agencies is crucial for the identification, arrest and removal of criminal noncitizens to maintain the integrity of the nation’s security\n\nERO recognizes the importance of its relationships with its law enforcement partners and will continue to coordinate with them in a way that best serves national security and public safety. Building community trust is key to law enforcement’s ability to obtain community cooperation with respect to investigations."
