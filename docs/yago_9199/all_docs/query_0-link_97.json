        "text": "Medium and Response, Stephan Günzel, 2015\n\n— This text first appeared in the catalogue accompanying Hannah Collins exhibition at the Sprengel Museum in Hannover in 2015.\n\nHannah Collins' works do not seem at first glance to come from a single artist, but rather from different originators or a group. The outward diversity and at the same time inner complexity of her works are nevertheless the result of a single basic principle: that of a response, as she herself puts it. While embodying both 'reply' and 'reaction', response also has echoes of responsibility. Collins' works are thus both a reply and a commitment: they are the response to events, facts or objects while taking responsibility for them at the same time. This is particularly conspicuous in her film project La Mina in which she films a Romani community to which outsiders rarely have access.\n\nIn view of this, the artist doesn't have to commit herself to a subject at all and certainly not to a medium or material – whose diversity seems to suggest multiple originators. In fact, Collins herself is the medium of what there is responsibility for and which a response is given to. On the contrary: a commitment to a technical medium like that of her favoured film or photography, or drawing as their predecessor medium, would conflict with the basic principle. In fact, 'mediums' (before medium/media was adopted for the book, cinema, television or the computer in the course of the 20th century) used to be human: those thought to have the ability to communicate beyond the here and now with people at a different location or time and mostly with the deceased in the hereafter with whom they established contact for the living. It is not for nothing that she gives an illustrated book of 2007 containing an overview of works the title of Finding, Transmitting, Receiving, which succinctly describes the procedure of any medium used for transmitting a message from a sender to a receiver.\n\nBut even if Collins' most recent work on hallucinogenic plants of the Amazon might harbour a spiritual dimension for viewers, her way of working is in fact more secular than today's media. For the latter are used for what human mediums were resorted to in former times: contacting the absent in space and time (as facilitated today by the telephone and social networks) or showing images suggestive of other-worldly spheres (as facilitated today by movies and computer games). On the other hand, through her works, Collins is the medium for entirely earthly, this-worldly things, although they could take place in the past – such as her interviews and images on Noah Purifoy's outdoor museum in the Joshua Tree National Park in California, produced specifically for the exhibition at the Sprengel Museum. Even if this work has pronounced aspects of 'research', a by no means uncommon activity for artists today, the underlying principle is again responsibility. In this case, the responsibility also results in recorded responses: audio tracks of in some cases aged respondents who personally knew the artist that died a decade ago. So it is not so much a case of research as of investigations with an inherent purpose.\n\nThe most important medium of her work – this is demonstrated by the named locations where and on which her works are produced – is again not the chosen medium of photography, film or audio recording, but travel. Although Collins has her studio in Swiss Cottage in London, her works are almost always produced with inspiration from a location where she either settles for a certain period (e.g. Barcelona in the 1990s, where she still has a studio today), that she specifically visits (like the above-mentioned Joshua Tree National Park) or that she allows herself to be drawn into (like most recently the Amazon basin). In each case, travel is distinguished by the fact that it cannot be comprehended in terms of dwelling or holiday making. But even these concepts are only seemingly antithetical: in fact, holidays imply dwelling and the associated distinction between leisure and work. Travel, on the other hand, stands outside this dichotomy and, strictly speaking, doesn't start anywhere (the home or workplace) or go anywhere (place of relaxation). The point of departure for the journey is instead the quest(ion), and the destination is not the location travelled-to but Collins' elementary responses that, with the quest, form a sounding board for encounters bringing forth responses/responsibilities. (By the same token, the journey doesn't start in time either nor end on a certain date, but is ultimately endless and can, be interrupted.)\n\nCollins herself attributes her modus operandi to some extent to the illness of her father who suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, which would explain her travelling as the result of an inability to adapt. But whatever the personal and hence existential reasons, the journey is decisive as a structure that manifests itself in the work of art and not as the mainspring of an individual biography. In a certain sense, this is demonstrated by the fact that Collins takes to the road in her imagination before physically embarking on her first trip. This takes her relatively late in life to Istanbul in 1992 before she then sets off into Eastern Europe, newly opened to the West, where she visits her father's home territory in Poland in 1993 and 1994. Her imaginary travels were initiated early on by pictures of plants from Australia that she saw in her grandfather's house (and whose forebear was in turn a botanist with whom James Cook sailed to New Zealand).\n\nLike all mediums, Collins is ultimately not entirely passive, even if responses call for a listening, but bring forth what they show – for which they accept responsibility. It is a profoundly ethical form of research and documentation that renders account of what has happened or is still happening and that was not yet visible or manifested. Rather than moralising, Collins allows the viewer to witness the action. A key motivation for her work is the seemingly simple question: What does an artist do? It is precisely this question that she puts posthumously to Purifoy.\n\nHowever, on closer inspection, Collins' question is highly remarkable since it doesn't seek clarification of what art is – clarification that is still outstanding after at least five hundred years of asking. Nor does she ask what an artist is but what such a person does. This question is crucial, since the answers given so far are tautological and usually end up defining artists with the activity of producing art. Although Collins doesn't give any direct information on what (all) artists (always) do, but expresses in concrete terms what an artist does through her ethical position on the one hand and through her resultant responsibility towards events and materials on the other.\n\nThe philosophical dimension of this self-reflection thus consists in the performative feedback. And this is why what the Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle propounds in his Ethics when he deems theory to be the highest form of practice does not apply to her. The very opposite holds for Collins for whom the highest form of theory is practice, answering the question of what an artist does through her constant action and not with a definition. In a certain sense, this lends expression to a cultural difference between her and the many continental artists working in the tradition known, sometimes confusingly, as 'free art'. By this are meant not the artes liberales comprising the general basic course of study, but an art devoid of purpose, i.e. something like what is known in French as l’art pour l’art or art for art’s sake. Just as in Britain the concept of 'free art' is more likely to suggest free admission to public museums, it would be inconceivable for Collins to devote herself to an activity that brings forth art that has no function other than perhaps aesthetic edification (the definition of the fine arts) which has been superseded by art as a commodity and investment in the present day. Even if Collins' first artwork dates back to the heyday of the British Punk movement, her art doesn't aim solely to provoke or agitate (anti- )politically. The response is located in an Inbetween that is opened up by her work as an artist.\n\nIn detail, it is above all three openings of such a responsible Inbetween in which her work as an artist literally unfolds: at the same time they also mark stages in the work's development distinguished in parts by the dominance of a technique, although the stages are linked by threads rather than being separated by radical breaks. A work starts with photography that opens up an Inbetween with the treatment of the materiality of photography and later also integrates the materiality of the photographed objects. At a later stage, these are film experiments that in different ways explore an Inbetween of both space and time. Her current work, finally, is distinguished by a search for clues that applies firstly to the botanical world in its relation to human use and secondly also to her work as an artist.\n\nStructurally, her work is rare in contemporary art in revealing a congruence of form and content without the latter being 'empty'. In a certain sense as a commentary on her own work, she photographed the reconstruction of the pavilion of Bauhaus architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, built for the 1929 International Expo, during her stay in Barcelona. The peculiarity of this and his other architectural designs is the calling-into-question of a millennium-old architectural dogma according to which a building's wall separates an interior from an exterior and which constitutes so-to-speak the ultimate goal and primary purpose of building construction. In Mies' buildings, the partitions essential for this become the linking elements. The interior is no longer separated from the exterior, but the two merge or become interchanged in the light of the experience that projecting roofs create a protective room-like space outside the building while the use of glass as a material for the walls contributes to a sense of being outdoors while indoors. Collins' 2003 pictures of the Barcelona pavilion, entitled Mies Pavilion, focus not like other architecture photography on the structure as a whole but on the separating elements. These no longer have a separating function but establish connections and as such are themselves spaces in between where content and form become one. Collins thus ultimately not only supplies a commentary on her own work but also shows where the core of the overworked concept of 'form follows function' lies.\n\n1. Photography: material and metonymy\n\nCollins' early works consist mainly of photography, although the term in no way captures the specific quality of her work. These are anything but 'light drawings' (photo- = light, -graphy = drawing), but genuine 'material images'. Of course, like all analogue camera photography, they come about optically through the transmission of reflected light through the lens onto the negative, but the work of the photographer only starts here. In sometimes 'monumental' exposures of the positive, the pictures are enlarged back to almost the original size of the original light-reflecting objects. The supposed lightness and luminosity of photography is transformed here into a material whose heaviness is more effort than weight. Despite the oppressive subjects, the black & white renditions of the pictures do not weigh down the viewer but lend detail to the subjects: the gravestones of the Jewish cemetery in Poland, the house façades in Istanbul, the road to Auschwitz – they are there. In keeping with Collins' position, their presence is not intrusive but takes responsibility for itself.\n\nWhat they show are metonymic operations revealing parts of a whole that they represent – with the peculiarity, however, that the whole for which they stand (pars pro toto) cannot be seen. This stylistic device differs from metaphor, which refers to something entirely different for representation; and from synecdoche, which shifts meanings into different semantic contexts. Collins thus draws attention to a way of dealing with the unrepresentability of the Holocaust and with the two-fold ban on images: it is neither possible to picture nor symbolise the genocide perpetrated on the Jews. However, photographs can share in it, or rather they can testify that the genocide took place and – as shown by Collins' picture The Road to Auschwitz of 1996 – that the place of the killing exists. Showing the route of a road to Auschwitz is thus not solely a reference to the 'banality of evil', as the philosopher Hannah Arendt called the logistics of death, or to an infrastructural prerequisite, but a partial representation of the immeasurable whole that is not a whole but in fact signifies a breakdown of humanity.\n\nHaving studied the life of Romani in the surrounding counter-society three years earlier, Collins finally resumes her film work on Current History in 2004 by travelling to Central Russia to the city of Nizhny Novgorod where she buys old photographs of strangers in a shop. The purchase of these pictures coincides with the rediscovery of a drawing from her childhood while clearing the house of her mother who died in the same year. This picture shows Collins in the company of a ghost. Even if she has no memory of the context of this snapshot, the resultant constellation says something about the nature of photography: it shows ghosts – living people who are dead but immortalised in photographs. The undead of photography populate a between-realm which Collins accepts through the appropriation and exhibition of the pictures and which she responds to and accepts responsibility for at the same time.\n\n2. Film: space and time\n\nThe titles of her large-format photographs already suggest what Collins elaborates on in her film work. The sub- and main title of many of her photographs is 'In the Course of Time' and expounds a far-reaching paradox of photography, which as a technical medium also has the 'ghost-forming' ability to extract a moment from the flow of time – as well as, and necessarily, a chunk of space. But photography also maintains inseverable ties with the moving picture, i.e. film, as the latter is composed of stills, of single images that when viewed together synthesise the illusion of experienced time. 'Time' also of course refers to time in the sense of 'history'. Photography and subsequently film also have a paradoxical relationship with history since the moment or continuum that they capture that no longer exists although they preserve the past that would otherwise be lost for ever. There exists a dual unreality of the medium that seemingly guarantees the link with reality. Not in the sense of the manipulation or stage-managing of reality, but in the sense of facilitating a mediated perception of the otherwise imperceptible, which is the past in the present and the present in the past per se.\n\nCollins' film installation La Mina – named after the settlement concerned in Sant Adria Besos in Catalonia, which is known for its modernist and inhumane high-rises of the Franco era – consists of five monitors showing the life of Romani in Spain's northeast from different angles and at overlapping times. In terms of content, the project again demonstrates Collins' ethical position as one of responsibility that attempts to enable the film's viewers to understand the basic principles of community life – or rather the differences from a surrounding society that is to a large extent unable to grasp the rules governing jurisdiction or property. To this extent, the film documents not the understanding, but again focuses – paradigmatically for Collins – on the Inbetween of the difference existing between Spanish society and the forcibly sedentary Romani community. It also takes this contrast a step further by highlighting the Inbetween of the sedentary Romani and those still living nomadically who, at the beginning of the film, meet the community living near Barcelona and initiate a discussion on how to deal with those still on the move.\n\nThe form of the film resonates with the content in so far as it has a mode of presentation positively spectacular for the date of its production, if the term 'spectacular' weren’t wholly inappropriate to Collins' work. In 2001, however, it was anything but easy for independent filmmakers to synchronise such a large number of sequences. Technically, Collins implements something that can be considered one of the milestones of early narrative cinema: so-called parallel montage. While this is still used in feature films mainly to show spatially separate and periodically independent strands of the plot alternately in succession in order to bring them together at the end, Collins uses the actual and simultaneous parallelisation of points of view of both one and the same action and of different events in order to have them disintegrate – or, to be more precise, to leave the Inbetween open. The effect is by no means the expected distancing of the viewers for whom such deconstructed action would no longer be comprehensible, but, on the contrary, their induction into it. Collins thus undermines the essence of the documentary image that binds viewers not theatrically by means of a self-contained narrative, but 'admits' them via its openness. Contributory to this are the jump cuts absolutely outlawed in feature film editing because they destroy the illusion of continuity. Yet because they 'jump' in La Mina not in the individual sequence, but only in the overall context of sequences, the film doesn't unsettle the viewer at any point.\n\nAgain, Collins' work stands out not because of its artistic formalism for its own sake, but because of its congruence of content and form. This experiences its barely surpassable culmination in Solitude and Company in 2008. At first sight, it appears to be purely an art film in which the film sequences are dictated by the external conditions of the film material: in two successive sequences, the interior of an empty factory shop, in La Tossée in Roubaix, France on the border with Belgium, is shown from a static position for a period of 24 hours and then with the camera tracking along the length of the building. Both the frequency of the individual shots in the first case and the speed of the camera in the second are determined by the length of the reels of film employed, which are sufficient for 60 minutes when shown at normal speed and which were fully exposed without interruption.\n\nAgain, in the interests of documentary cinema, Collins reverses the organisational approach of narrative cinema: while the latter combines the moving with the static viewpoint in continuity montage to bring about the coherence of narrative space and narrative time, space and time diverge in two respects. First directly due to the sequencing of spatial shot and temporal shot, and then also indirectly in that the latter was taken from a static position while the former was shot in motion. Collins demonstrates visually what physical theories of relativity wish to say: that space is always comprehended in time and time in space. The formal conditions effective here are again intimately related to a content that is communicated here with sound recordings of the narrated dreams of local Algerian migrants who have in fact never seen the inside of the factory which has been closed since they arrived in France. Just as the wishes and fantasies expressed in them do not concur with reality, so the separation of space (time) and time (space) is something imaginary mediated by Collins through the medium of film.\n\n3. The quest: clues and nature\n\nIn Collins' later works, she again uses the still camera, a tool that she never abandons although she has subjected it in the meantime to an appraisal as a means of truth. In various urban shots taken in London, Lisbon, Barcelona again, Paris and Madrid from 1998 to 2008, we see roofscapes beneath surreal colours of the sky that clearly show the signs of image post-processing – its false colours. For Collins herself, the pictures, which she calls True Stories, are the opening scenes of possible films and thus only true in relation to the fiction of the film for which the locations are only ever sets. In keeping with postmodern photography, this poses problems in that the picture's referential value becomes (has become) doubtful. But rather than losing herself in the game of its revocation, Collins again seeks to regain it by embarking on the search for what remains and where it comes from.\n\nIn this way, she discovers for herself the things of nature and equally the nature of things. A staging post is her visits to Sigmund Freud's Hampstead home where he lived and died in exile and which is near Collins' studio. In the interior, she is interested most in the archaeological replicas that Freud not only collected but also used as therapeutic tools in Vienna to encourage his patients to speak, i.e. to start their narrative and then to arrive at the reasons for their problems and conditions. Psychoanalysis is in itself a search for clues and proceeds in its method 'archaeologically', which is why antiques as objects of the past, irrespective of their specific significance, have a semantic equivalence to the deeper strata of the soul explored in the therapy process. For Collins, the analogy goes even further and concerns the medium of photography. This time, however, not as a material, but as a path of dissemination. Just as mechanical reproductions disseminate content worldwide, so were the miniatures of ancient sculptures a means of making these sculptures universally known and available.\n\nBut she is also interested in something else about Freud: in the night of 9 to 10 March 1898, Freud has a dream that will become known from his accounts as the 'dream of the botanical monograph'. The entirely positive dream, which can also be interpreted as a reference to his patient 'Flora' or to Freud's own 'maturation' or 'flowering', is concerned with an undefined plant contained in the imaginary book seen the previous day in a shop window. The plant exists not only as an illustration, but also as itself in dried form in the book in the manner of a herbarium. Concurring with Freud's researchers, Collins identifies the leaves as those of the coca plant (lat. Erythroxylum coca), whose effects Freud and some of his contemporaries appreciated.\n\nCollins' visit to Freud's house also becomes a farther-reaching search for clues that leads her to the plant's place of origin in South America. Even if she subjects herself there to a drug experiment with the ayahuasca brew derived from yagé plants, she is concerned not so much with the hallucinatory experience as with investigating the relationship between the body and the plant and also between the mind and nature. In addition to Freud as the inspiration for the trip, she is guided by various books on plants and above all by Richard Evans Schultes' Hallucinogenic Plants dating back to 1976, a cult book of the psychedelic age. Like Collins, Schultes, who was himself in charge of a herbarium at Harvard University, was interested not so much in the 'pleasure factor' induced by the plant, but in its immediate effect on the body where the distinction between the plant and the body in the intoxication experience is overcome and the person can experience him- or herself (again) as nature. Like Schultes, who is considered the founder of ethnobotany, Collins wants to study indigenous peoples' knowledge of all manner of plants before it vanishes along with these peoples.\n\nAn unusual parallel, though no longer surprising in view of Collins' approach, exists between her Fertile Forest project from the south of Colombia, which Collins carried out specifically for the exhibition in the Sprengel Museum and a commission for the celebrated Catalonian chef Ferran Adrià in 2011. In his thoroughly experimental and molecular cuisine, a huge range of foods are used in the preparation of meals that puts the relationship between humanity and nature to the test: what makes the 'feast' 'fragile' is not only that the unusual is brought to the table, but that also Collins shows the products before their transformation by the chef. For this, she travels to the places of origin of the wasabi (Japanese horseradish) and nori (seaweed) in Japan, Stenorhynchus crabs in Galicia and anemones in Cádiz. What is striking about her photography is that it shows the foods in their environments as things that have already been 'served', i.e. what nature has given without the pictures 'humanising' their objects. The characteristic pallor of Collins' colour photographs – that strangely match the false colours of the townscapes – are also at variance with the glossy aesthetic of food photography. The latter not only tends to focus on the served final product, but also, in its theatrical presentation and lighting, elevates the food into an almost supernatural state. As a preliminary to this, Collins captured shelves and frozen food counters containing tablets and vegetables in pictures entitled Supermarket in 2004 – and once again the Inbetween comes to the fore. Here it is the intermediate zone of the retailing of foods that are neither in their place of origin in nature nor at home on the table; or, in the case of medicines, that intermediate zone of hybrid products of pharmacological knowledge that has cancelled its ties with nature without ever being able to leave it behind.\n\nCollins' current project on Noah Purifoy, finally, finds its predecessor in another search for clues – The Road to Mvezo of 2010 in which she seeks the place of Nelson Mandela's birth in the former province of Transkei in South Africa's southeast. This is where she not only visits the memorial erected there, but also Mthatha, the place where he spent his youth. The pictures that she brings back could hardly be more distressing, as they show Mthatha as a place that has evidently been abandoned and documents its own abandonment as such (its only legacy being a crooked bookcase in an open house); while at Mvezo is a structure that for its part houses a portrait of Mandela. The current work on Purifoy shows initial points of contact with that on Mandela in that both played a leading role in the struggle of black Africans and black Americans for equal rights. However, when Mandela was elected President of South Africa in 1994, Purifoy had shifted the focus of his work to the Mojave Desert after being the foremost artist of the Watts Riots of 1965 – which happened a year after the sentencing of Nelson Mandela to life imprisonment – and in the process of becoming famous due to his association with the Black Panther movement founded a year later.\n\nThe challenge that Purifoy poses for Collins is the fleetingness of his art that consists not of works but of an activity. There is a huge temptation to regard his inheritance, i.e. what is managed today by the Noah Purifoy Foundation in Joshua Tree, as the artist's work. These are installations with objects in their discovered state, which puts Purifoy in the long tradition of work with objets trouvés that he combines as assemblages with the inhospitable desert environment. But the sculptures and structures are merely the results of an activity, and it is this that Collins is concerned with in her basic question of 'what an artist does'. So she doesn't just document the shacks, readymades and garbage installations on Purifoy's property. She also asks his still living friends and fellow witnesses about his activity resulting from the protest culture of the West Coast so that she can record the replies and make them available to posterity.\n\nIt may be that Collins will never be able to give a definitive answer to the question of what an artist does. But in her affinity to the American artist she has reiterated her position on what an artist should do: her art must not be irresponsible in order to justify her work as an artist. So Noah Purifoy's motto is certainly applicable to Hannah Collins as a responsive artist: 'I do not wish to be an artist. I only wish that art enables me to be.'\n\nBird Land, 2004 Richard Noble\n\n— This text first appeared in the catalogue accompanying Hannah Collins exhibition at CaixaForum in Barcelona and Madrid in 2008-2009\n\nAt the beginning of Hannah Collins’ new projection La Mina, a group of people awake in a sort of temporary encampment on the edge of a vast housing estate. Sleeping bags, lean-tos, the odd table and chair scattered in the open space suggest an encampment of the homeless, or perhaps of Gypsies. Two men bridle an old horse and talk about what to do about the Romanian Gypsies encamped in this space, which they use for their scrap business and clearly regard as their own. The plan they hit upon is to dump as much scrap as they can on the space so as to drive them off (this has the virtue of being within their rights as users of the space and avoiding the financial obligations – petrol, etc. - traditionally involved in helping fellow Gypsies to move on). As they set off in their horse drawn cart towards the main estate to gather scrap, they pass under a motorway. A large bus thunders towards and passes them just at the low point of the road. Neither the horse nor the drivers seem at all disturbed by the size and power of the passing bus; they carry on as if this sort of confrontation between the modern and the pre-modern, town and country, between historic and present time, is nothing out of the ordinary. This brief series of events at the beginning of Hannah Collins’La Mina sets up two tensions which recur throughout the work. The scrap dealers are residents of the permanent community of La Mina, working within its political economy and proprietorial about the spaces they’ve colonised within the community. The Romanian Gypsies are in this sense marginal to the Gypsies of La Mina; still living the ancient, nomadic life, and still regarded with contempt by the town dwelling property owners. Yet equally, the scrap guys are marginal to the main economy and culture of Barcelona. They work within the confines of La Mina, deal only with other Gypsies and their main technological asset is a carthorse.\n\nThe cart emerges from the underpass at a leisurely pace, already one can feel the languid heat of the morning pressing down and enveloping the community. Their pace seems congruent with the heat, but radically at odds with the environment through which they are moving. Ringed by teaming motorways, a vast housing estate of 1960s modernist blocks, thousands of units in each, rises out of a concrete and asphalt field. This is the Gypsy community of La Mina on the edge of Barcelona. La Mina was built by the Franco regime as a typically ‘modern’ solution to the problem of housing the poor and the marginal in 1960s Spain. It was in this sense also a solution to the ‘Gypsy problem’, because Gypsies were the poorest and most marginal community in Spain at the time, though it would not have been articulated as such. Architecturally, it has the look of a particularly fascist solution, vast alienating modernist blocks built around huge rectangular plazas; a triumph of rational geometric design profoundly inimical to the development of any kind of organic street life. But of course, it wasn’t just the fascists who built such estates; they became central to post-war social housing schemes across Europe, and plague its cities from Moscow to London. La Mina is merely one of many registers of the utopian impulse in architectural modernism gone wrong. Nor were the fascists the only ones who identified gypsy communities as a ‘problem’. Nomadic cultures are, to understate the case, incompatible with modernity. There can no longer be any question of large numbers of people with a distinct culture and language travelling from place to place, following work or seasonal patters of migration through developed modern societies. Nomadic cultures are just too at odds with capitalist modernity. Their general indifference to its most basic values: individual property rights, the self-regulating anxieties of linear time keeping, and perhaps most importantly their refusal to identify with and stay in any one particular place or community, make them problematic from the standpoint of governments and social systems grounded on ownership, enterprise and rigorous self-surveillance. This is borne out by the fact that governments throughout the developed world: in North America, Australia, and Central Europe as well as Spain, have sought to constrain, localise and assimilate nomadic peoples.\n\nLa Mina evokes the sense of a community and a culture that is neither nomadic nor wholly assimilated into the modern. It exists somewhere in between, an interstitial ghetto surrounded by motorways, symbolically (and perhaps actually) excluded from the rest of the city by the arteries of economic modernisation; but also by its own cultural solipsism, by its very refusal to assimilate, to submit its own conventions, customs and traditions to the great homogenising forces of the modern.\n\nThis complex five screen projection tells three distinct but nonetheless connected ‘stories’ or narratives over three days. Each narrative unfolds in linear time, but they are projected over the five screens so that they overlap, most of the time two of the narratives unfold simultaneously. This is an immensely complex and subtle narrative technique, which allows the viewer to register the specificities of each narrative (cultural, personal, aesthetic), while at the same time grasping the larger cultural context in which the narratives of others unfold. This seems central to Collins’ project. She uses the languages of photography and cinema to construct what might be termed an ‘anthropoetical’ portrait of this community. We are offered shifting perspectives: sometimes the perspective of the observer, Collins herself, sometimes the perspective of the participants, a judge, a young boy, a man mourning his father. Similarly the camera shifts back and forth between the structural components of the community: its architecture, its judicial procedures, its internal economy; and the lives of individuals who iterate these various cultural forms through the narratives Collins constructs around them.\n\nThe shifting perspective is, it would seem, central to the poetics of the piece. Collins creates a kind of multidirectional dialogue which is based on the interplay of three ‘authorial’ perspectives: the Gypsies who are the authors of their own stories and their own dialogues, Collins herself who has filmed and edited these stories into one work, and the viewer who is offered a series of very detailed and intimate narratives that he or she must interpret from their own very limited knowledge of the situation and culture against which the stories unfold. The Gypsies involved in the project have been asked to represent themselves through a series of narratives, but there is no way of telling from either the narratives themselves or form Collins unobtrusive cinematography to what extent the stories are fictional and to what extent they are based on fact. In the end, it simply doesn’t matter, because they are evidently intended to tell us a certain kind of truth about the experience of the people involved, but this is a truth they the audience must participate in verifying or legitimating through interpreting the work itself. Everything is left open, which means one must participate actively in order to understand.\n\nCollins does not attempt a systematic analysis of the community of La Mina, still less a straightforward record of an anthropological exercise in participant observation. We are offered a plurality of perspectives on different aspects of the culture; these views do not cohere into a logical analysis, nor do they add up to a vision of the whole. Yet at the same time they tell us a kind of fragmentary truth about life in this community. We sense the overwhelming alienation and confinement imposed by its architecture, the depressing lack of opportunity or diversion for its inhabitants; yet we also witness the power of its traditions of social cohesion, the redemptive possibilities of its music, and the strangely unexpected beauty of particular cultural practices, like caging wild birds in order to hear them sing. II\n\nBy staging the slightly frightening confrontation between the cart horse and the bus Collins alerts us to a trope running throughout La Mina; the tension between the modern and the pre-modern in Gypsy culture expressed in a variety of different forms as each of the narratives unfold. In the first narrative, the two guys driving the cart seem to represent a kind of dionysian chorus on the edges of the mainstream society. They enter La Mina from the outside, from the temporary shantytown of the more transitory, traditional gypsy culture they want to be rid of, and they circle it over the course of the narrative, gathering their stuff, taking their chances. They are members of the community but somehow on the outside, somehow aligned with an earlier or more primal sense of disorder or anarchy which the community of La Mina has apparently left behind. But of course, as both Hobbes and Nietzsche in their different ways have told us, we can never leave this primal impulse to disorder behind entirely; it is always threatening to break out: in children’s games, in civil conflict, and in art 1 .\n\nCollins models this tension over the first day by projecting structures of order on the left hand screens, while the travelling dionysian chorus are confined to the right. In effect, the narrative unfolds on the left hand side of the projection. Initially, we encounter images of the architecture; a vast homogenous banality of box-like dwellings stacked endlessly on top of each other, spreading out across the five screens like a sort of demonically expanding Gursky photograph. Collins’ sensitivity to architecture is very refined. She finds in it the underlying structures of how we think about the spaces in which we live, and is somehow able to effect an immediate, almost visceral connection between the images she makes of buildings and the viewer’s subjective experience of space. What emerges in her initial tour d’horizon of La Mina, and returns at the end of the first section with the singing of the Cante Hondo, is the sense of the architecture of La Mina as a profoundly external and alienating structure. It is in a sense the authoritative presence of the external world, the world of Spanish or Catalan culture and politics which threatens both their political autonomy and their cultural integrity.\n\nThis is evoked with a sombre, aching beauty as night falls on the first day of the narrative. A wheelchair bound flamenco singer, Rafael, sings a Cante Hondo lament; a sad, solitary song which evinces the pain he feels at the loss of his mother with a directness and power that is both unsettling and moving at the same time. As he sings Collins projects images of the estate that reveal the underlying panopticism of the architecture 2 . Like Bentham’s ideal prison La Mina isolates families into discrete, isolated spaces. The essentially communal existence of nomadic peoples fosters a domestic architecture which allows several generations to live together at once. Density and isolation replace the organically communal growth of the shanty town or the temporary encampment. And in addition to this the sheer monumentality of the estate, its heavy, immobile, concrete permanence, constitutes a profound rupture with the community’s nomadic traditions. Like Rafael in his wheelchair, the Gypsies of La Mina cannot go back to the way it was before.\n\nYet the narrative of the first day is not entirely devoted to the alienating effects of externally imposed structures. Within the framework of this static, incarcerating architecture, traditional cultural forms and practices continue to flourish and sustain the community. The survival of these traditional practices is of course central to the community’s identity, and Collins’ narrative shows us how this actually works. Images of a community patriarch, Tio Emilio, gradually segue into the film as a full blown narrative. He is a judge, what aboriginal communities might call an elder, who is often called upon to resolve civil or criminal disputes within the community. In this case, two young men have had a dispute over a car, and it appears that there was some minor violence or threatening behaviour. The operation of this ‘court’ is fascinating: spontaneous and popular and thoroughly pre-modern. It shows us how an ancient mechanism for resolving disputes between members of the community can flourish in the present, and also how this practice can be a kind of resistance (that something so spontaneous and transitory, but nonetheless important, could break out amidst the monolithic architecture of La Mina is at least a symbolic kind of resistance to the colonisers’ will).\n\nTio Emilio approaches the dispute very differently from a judge in the common or Roman law tradition would. He is evidently not the least interested in the rights or wrongs of the case, and takes it for granted that some measure of each is present on both sides. What he seems most concerned with is restoring balance and unity to the community by reconciling the young men, and more importantly their families, to each other. The fathers of the young men are asked to put their respective cases, suggesting it is really the families who are the subjects of this judicial procedure, not the individuals. Tio Emilio then speaks to the respective fathers and their families with a mixture of cajoling intimacy and subtle intimidation: it is a bravura performance. He succeeds in persuading them to reconcile, but he also threatens the boys with banishment if they fight again. Historically, banishment is the severest punishment of all in nomadic cultures, because to be banished meant the loss of everything: identity, family, and very likely life. It is hard to imagine this as a punishment anyone would take seriously in a Spanish or English court, yet here it remains a powerful deterrent to uncivil behaviour. This of course points up a major difference between dominant and marginal cultures; in the former the loss of one’s culture is virtually inconceivable, and so plays little or no role in the framing of one’s identity. However, in the latter, where the loss of culture is an ever present prospect, sustaining one’s links to it takes on a much greater urgency, and more directly frames one’s sense of self. In the end the purpose of the proceeding seems to be the health of the community, not the vindication of a moral or legal standard, and still less the upholding of an individual right. The narrative of this particular judicial proceeding ends in a successful resolution of the problem, though it is easy to see that this might not be the case in more extreme circumstances. Nonetheless it illustrates two important dimensions of the way this community sustains itself. First, that it has the internal cultural and political resources for sustaining its own civil society. Second, these kinds of resources allow it to resist assimilation; they are the living or functioning basis of the community’s capacity for self-governance.\n\nBy intertwining these very complex narratives, Collins has given us a measured and it seems to me quite profound sense of the tensions that frame this community’s existence.\n\nShe illustrates the nature of their incarceration in the alienating and panoptic architecture of La Mina; an incarceration which is all the more tragic for being to a significant degree self-imposed. Yet at the same time she is attentive to and able to celebrate their day to day strategies of resistance, some of which are extremely effective at stimulating pride and self-confidence in the community. All the while the cart horse and its drivers slowly circle the estate, like witnesses from a bygone era, a time when the entire community might literally have just slipped away into the night. III\n\nThe second section of this work opens in the country. Collins’ camera again frames this new community with an examination of its architecture. This is a rural, more traditional Gypsy encampment; instead of vast modernist blocks we find a series of single story ‘jabollas’ spreading horizontally along a dirt track. The houses appear to be put together with waste materials salvaged from here and there. They have a transitory but nonetheless organic feel to them. Collins is here in familiar territory. She has photographed this kind of dwelling before, in Poland and in India. One section of the work In the Course of Time (1994) details a cluster of low, A-frame shacks, half dug into the ground and put together with bits of wood, tar paper, plastic and whatever else had come to hand. This is a difficult, complex image; rough, chaotic, evidence of hard, transitory life. Again, Collins uses architecture as a register of the subjectivity of those who build and inhabit them. These shacks are evidently used by hunters, or woodsmen, who appear to have a non- proprietorial relation to the place they have chosen to inhabit. They are registers of an economy of marginality, places where the excluded, the damaged, the other are allowed to exist. Yet at the same time they have a kind of beauty, the sensuous detail of the black and white image is almost elegiac.\n\nHowever, the images here are anything but elegiac. The rural Gypsy settlement contrasts sharply with the monumental urban architecture of La Mina, images of which continue to appear as Collins camera examines the rural settlement. The contrast between them highlights a distinction within the Gypsy community itself, which parallels or perhaps echoes the some of the divisions between the community of La Mina and the broader Catalan and Spanish cultures in which it exists. Life in La Mina would appear to be more urban, in many respects both more sophisticated and more alienating than life in the rural settlement. In the former, children play in the street, families are isolated from one another in concrete boxes, personal histories seem much more tied up with the larger society. In the latter women and children move in and out of each others’ homes easily, talking and sharing their day to day lives. A man openly discusses his worries over his son and the loss of his father, sharing his unhappiness with the head of another Gypsy community, and with his sister, who is (interestingly in this heavily patriarchal culture) the head of his own community. The implication is that despite its marginality and the profoundly self-protected, inward-looking perspective of Gypsy culture, it not one monolithic thing. Differences exist within it, and these are as important to understanding how it works as the defining commonalities.\n\nThe narrative of the second day contrasts these two communities in a series of subtle, languid images. The two communities meet and so in a certain sense solidify their differences at a marketplace, which appears to be on the edges of La Mina underneath one of the motorways that surrounds it. This a the point of encounter between two Gypsy cultures; a point at which trade occurs but at a more metaphorical level a point at which each community in a certain sense responds to and fulfils the lack of the other. To know itself each needs the difference of the other. The presence of these two communities mixing together under a flyover puts one in mind of Jeff Wall’s The Storyteller, which links the marginalisation of another nomadic people to the history of modern painting, and modernism in general. There is however an important difference. Whereas Wall’s work is primarily about representation 3, Collins’ uses the metaphorical potential of architecture to make an essentially anthropological point. Sequestered away under the motorway, the marketplace also becomes a place otherness and marginality, almost literally nowhere. Yet at the same time it is also a place of cultural exchange and renewal, a place where the dialectics internal to Gypsy culture drive it forward, sustaining and renewing its vitality.\n\nAs the second day progresses Collins focuses increasingly on life in the rural Gypsy community. The main subject of the narrative is Nanin, a middle aged man whose son is in prison, and who seems to be in a state of more or less permanent mourning for his father. There is nothing dramatic about his unhappiness, but it would seem to be rendering him in some serious way unable to cope. His family and friends are obviously concerned about him, but perhaps also somewhat impatient with his unhappiness. They want him to play the trumpet again, something he has apparently not done since the death of his father ten years ago. They tell him that he needs to play it, for himself, and for his son and for the community as a whole. The implication seems to be that music is therapeutic; it offers some sort of release or redemption to the individual, but it is also a way of sustaining the culture as a whole because it introduces new generations (in this case his son) to a defining cultural form. It links the generations together by preserving a cultural form and orienting the living away from the absolute loss of death towards the needs and aspirations of the living. At a certain point someone gives him a trumpet, while all around preparations see to be made for some sort of party. They urge him to play, which he does quite beautifully; a melody made familiar by the Gypsy Kings, more upbeat that the Cante Hondo sung at the end of the previous day, but nonetheless cathartic for that. As he finishes his song his wife, and then his sister, throw their arms around him, a smile of genuine joy and relief animates his face. This marks the beginning of a bacchanalian celebration by the whole community, suggesting in some sense that the resolution of his unhappiness, however temporary, is ultimately something that must be accomplished communally, as if it were necessary to the restoration the community’s health. The contrast with the ending of the first day, and by extension the character of the two communities, could hardly be sharper. If Rafael’s song is one of absolute loss sung out against the alienating and indifferent architecture of La Mina, in a certain sense the trumpeter’s song initiates a celebratory return to his community. IV\n\nThe third day begins with the arresting image of birdcages hung along a deep red terracotta wall; at first they look a bit like constructivist paintings, but then a certain parallel with the box-like apartments of La Mina becomes inescapable. It is apparently common here to cage wild birds in order to enjoy their song; a practice which must resonate, consciously or unconsciously, of their own cultural condition. We are back in La Mina; the quiet repose inspired by the images of the birdcages gradually gives way to the increasingly intense activities of a dense urban community. The narrative of the final day revolves around preparations for a concert in the evening. The main character is a boy of about fourteen, who is out and about in the community during the day and then prepares for the concert in the evening. Over the course of the day, moving in and out of the boy’s narrative, we encounter a large number of individuals. Some of them we’ve seen before, Tio Emilio, Rafael, the boy himself, but many of them are new, the man in the bar who speaks to the boy, lots of women wearing gold jewellery, some men in a club, children playing in the plaza. There is a sense of the community unfolding before us in all its multiplicity; after the careful examination of architecture and cultural forms we are reminded that individual specificity is always in excess of our attempts to capture it in generalisation.\n\nThe boy’s narrative is at root a story of cultural identity; of how this culture links together its past, present and future. The boy is shown listening to Tio Emilio recounting his life as an actor. He evidently had some success in the so-called ‘spaghetti westerns’ of Sergio Leone; one is shown on the television behind Tio Emilio as he speaks. The boy is clearly fascinated by Tio Emilio’s account of his life: he is a figure of authority in the community, someone who commands respect as a wise elder but also someone who has had successes in the world outside. These kinds of stories are central to the oral tradition of the community, they teach new generations about the past, about how it was for their grandfathers and grandmothers, why they left, why they returned. After he leaves Tio Emilio the boy visits a video store, perhaps in search of a ‘spaghetti western’, but all he seems to find are Hollywood films. In a way this underlines the importance of the oral tradition, without the stories of the older generations La Mina’s youth would have only American popular culture and its variants to draw upon.\n\nAs on the second day, music comes to the fore as an important part of what links the generations of La Mina together. After the birdcages we encounter a group of flamenco musicians playing or practicing with each other in one of the plazas of La Mina. The music is beautiful, up lifting, and we can see the pleasure on the faces of the musicians as the play. Strains of the melody float across the images in the projection, drawing them together. The camera pans around the square, catching from different angles a statue of Camaron, the most famous Gypsy flamenco singer of the 1970s and 1980s. Camaron is a cultural hero here. One can sense the extent of his influence in the hairstyles of the flamenco musicians preparing for the concert in the evening, who seem mostly to be sporting seventies style mullets. Ten years after his death, he is still the standard of what can be achieved in flamenco. This is underlined by a second conversation the boy has in a bar, this time with a clean shaven Nanin, who has come to the city for the concert. He tells the boy that Camaron was a god for his generation; a hero of their own culture who was also admired and respected worldwide.\n\nOne has the sense that the boy has heard this before, but it nonetheless prepares him for the final cathartic moment of the day, the concert which brings the entire community together around one of its oldest, most vibrant traditions. At one level of course it is just like any other urban community enjoying a concert on a warm summer evening; a mixture of excitement, dressing up, socialising, and having a good time. But it is also the reiteration of an internal structure, a tradition that reaches back before the tower blocks and the static, urban existence that now defines the community of La Mina. The work ends with this reiteration of the community’s ties to the pre-modern, not as an offering of hope or redemption or even nostalgia, but rather as an observation about how it endures. Yet at the same time, just as the concert is about to begin, Collins draws us back. We are not allowed to witness the climactic event, and the images are allowed to fade out against the returning image of Barcelona at night. This drawing back is a kind of intentional rupture, it reminds us that what we have witnessed is artifice; that we are not part of this community and that we have only been given the illusion that we might be able to get close to it or understand what is actually going on there. In the final frame, before the distant city reclaims the screen, an image of the cart horse fades gently out focus.\n\n1 See Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan (London: Basil Blackwell, 1949), ch. 13: Hobbes here offers his famous description of the ‘state of nature’ as a condition of the war of everyone against everyone, ‘And the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.’ He believed all human society to be constantly threatened with the outbreak of civil disorder, and hence valued authority highly; Nietzsche, on the other hand, finds the source of all great art in the primal disorder of life; see Friedrich Nietzsche, The Birth of Tragedy, ed. R. Guess, trans. R. Spiers (Cambridge: CUP, 1999), secs, 6,7.\n\n2 The term ‘panopticism’ comes from Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish: the Birth of the Prison, trans. Alan Sheridan (London: Penguin Books, 1979), pp. 195-225, esp. 201, 209; I do not of course suggest that La Mina is literally like a prison, rather that the effects of isolating families into discrete box-like units marks a radical break with pre-modern modes of existence, and in the process habituates people to a de-personalised and mechanistic form of power which is manifested not in symbols or individual persons but through the self-regulating behaviour of those subject to it.\n\n3 See Thierry de Duve, ‘The Mainstream and the Crooked Path’ in Jeff Wall (London: Phaidon Press, 19960, pp.47\n\nIngrid Swenson in conversation with Hannah Collins\n\n— This conversation was first published by La Fabrica editorial Spain in 2010\n\nIS: A lot of your work has a sense of looking at the past.\n\nHC: I think it’s actually an attempt to describe the future. It’s just in terms of the past.\n\nIS: Solitude and Company was made in Roubaix in France in 2008. It seems, more so than in your other films, to relate to your photographic work, in terms of its use of still and moving archive images. Although nearly an hour in length, there are only four or five camera positions apart from the last shot, which is a slow tracking shot that travels the entire length of the factory interior.\n\nHC: Perhaps it seems closer to my photography because I didn’t edit it, or rather I edited very little. This film was structured around the length of each film roll, as the film rolls end, we change camera position but not otherwise. The work is very structured and acknowledges structuralist film.\n\nThe film is a description of space, in this instance the space of an abandoned factory, one of many abandoned factories in the area of Roubaix around Lille, where there was a textile industry. So one key component of the work is about the end of industry in that area. There are a number of voice- overs from people of different ages, who have come to live in that area, and who are from an Algerian community. I was responding to conversations that I had had with them when they told me about never having been inside these spaces – they may have been in the area for 20 years, and are surrounded by these derelict and locked buildings that they couldn’t enter. It was about prohibited space and what that might mean to different societies. I then asked the group of people that I was working with to recount their dreams to be used as the soundtrack. I worked with them and also an actor to recount their dreams, as if they were dreaming them at that moment.\n\nMany are Algerian people living in the north of France don’t have very much of a voice. They may have quite a strong voice in their own country, but in France, they have very limited official voice.\n\nDreamscapes are places for potential freedom and I wanted to juxtapose the image of the locked and abandoned space of the factory with the boundless space of the dream.\n\nThe dreams recounted by the people have no immediate or direct bearing on the empty factory space, I choose it because it is a un-enterable space that is located in the area that these people live in.\n\nIS: Tell me about the archive footage and images that you used right at the beginning?\n\nHC: One of the first things I was shown after I had been invited to come to Lille, was this film of archive footage, and what was really odd about it was that it’s a series of shots taken at different times from the 1900s to the 1950s of the factories and the workers presumably from the area, shot using a hand held movie camera. They’re short and they're at varying speeds, because the speed of the film has changed and you can’t reproduce it at the film speed that it was filmed at. So people seem to rush about their work as if they were in a dream and the machines jerk through their movements in the projected film. It’s various factories not just one. It’s a sort of amalgam of spaces. I didn’t take it from the original footage, I took it from a video copy that was lying around, and nobody knows where the original footage is, so I haven’t re-edited it. There is one shot that is very similar to an early Lumière film, of people leaving a factory. So for me it’s got a reference to the beginning of film, and I also thought of it as being about industrial processes at their height, and then how things have ended up, in terms of physical space. For me, this has quite strong economic, social and cultural repercussions. Today we are at the end of a very long period of 150 years of industry.\n\nSomeone I met recently said “all your work is about filling in gaps in history, filling in things that are invisible.”\n\nI was very drawn to the archive footage at the beginning – all these factories steaming away and massive activity, and hundreds of machines. It felt quite similar to surrealist imagery, like Louis Buñuel perhaps, and of course the idea of the dream was something that the surrealists were very interested in too.\n\nIS: And there are certain still images within the archive footage. In particular there’s one shot of cotton spools against the brick wall, which seems to be about different texture and a lot of your work is about texture.\n\nHC: Exactly.\n\nIS: And the desert appears in the recounted dreams of more than one of the stories, and the image of the desert has played an important role in your photographic work early on.\n\nHC: When you think about abandoned factory or warehouse spaces, perhaps you also think about a desert – perhaps it could also be a desert. One can transform into the other, visually, quite easily while listening to the dreamer’s dream. But I want the viewer to make these connections. One thing I’ve learnt about my own films is that it’s better if you get the viewer to work. The viewer needs to participate in the process of the unravelling of the imagery.\n\nIS: But you also let the viewer take a rest, because there are sequences of up to a minute where you watch nothing happening and there is no voice-over or soundtrack. It’s compelling because there’s little tiny things happening, and little ambient noises, or the suggestion of something moving right at the very back of the empty space. So there’s a heightened sensitivity about it, which appears in a lot of your work. In this sense there is a lot of connection with the desert, which is about emptiness, about texture, a sense of endless time.\n\nHC: In this particular work, I’ve challenged the viewer to stick it out, and be with that place for an hour, which is a cold, not particularly nice place for an hour, just watching changes, but then I’ve given the viewer some help, because of the dreamers’ dreams and the sound. Even so, you’ve got to work hard, it’s quite an exhausting thing to watch.\n\nIS: Now I would like to leap back right to the beginning of your photographic work, and particularly your large cardboard works Thin Protective Coverings (1986) and the haunting interiors like Where Words Fail Completely (1986) that have a heightened sense of stillness.\n\nHC: The first thing I looked at and loved in photography was Roger Fenton’s images. They were much more in touch with process than my contemporaries in British photography at that time. My reason for making those early works had a lot to do with process – a lot to do with the act of putting the paper on the wall, projecting the image in the dark, having the possibility of manipulating that image. I tremendously enjoyed the different stages that you go through; first of all the act of having something in a glass screen, where you see it big, where you see it upside down. The screen I used had measurements on it so I could tell that if my image was going to end up two metres high, which is a bit taller than a person, then half-way up the image would be a particular thing, because it was marked on the screen at the back. So before I took the image, I kind of knew what I was thinking about in terms of printing it, and the printing was a physical, mechanical act. It was getting these great big rolls of paper out of blackened plastic boxes, and then putting them on the wall for maybe six hours.\n\nIS: So you did all the printing yourself?\n\nHC: Yes. Putting them away between the long time of the exposure and then developing and washing the pieces of paper with sponges and chemicals until the image was just right.\n\nIS: Did that connect with your training at art school as a painter, this very physical way of making the work?\n\nHC: Yes, I had studied painting, but also I was a student in America. I saw the work of artists like Jackson Pollock’s as large-scale, physical acts. Their painting was given meaning by the physicality of their presences. I wanted to bring that to photography. The cardboard pieces are similar in my thinking to how Rauchenberg would put a cardboard box on a wall. I was reproducing it photographically and thus gave me a chance to have another attempt at describing it. When I was printing it, I was actually describing it.\n\nIS: What, in terms of controlling the exposure on the paper?\n\nHC: Some of those images are at least 90 minutes and some are two hours in front of an enlarger. Two hours is quite a long time to reconsider an image. It gave me a chance to think that maybe that should be darker, or maybe if you walk to the left, that should be black over there when you finally see the image. When I was printing them, I’d move my body in different places or stand in front of the enlarger to get rid of everything except one area or another. The final image is the result of several stages of working at it or rethinking it.\n\nHC: When I started making all those works with cardboard boxes and things in my studio, I didn’t have a penny, I had to go and get the stuff off the street and work out what to do with it. Part of the reason that I used things like cardboard boxes, plastic sheeting and my bed was because I couldn’t afford anything else.\n\nIS: It’s also important to emphasise the scale of your work at this time.\n\nHC: They were large, often over two metres high and six metres wide and sometimes on multiple sheets, but they roll up and get transported around. They're not massive things with frames, they’re just thin bits of paper put on the wall, I didn’t really think about permanence but I did take care to make them very well, so they lasted very well.\n\nIS: But they were the opposite of what Thomas Struth was doing in terms of his photographic project.\n\nHC: Yes, they were the opposite to that. My work is not at all part of that archiving tradition in Germany from Sander, to the Beckers to Struth and Gursky. When I’ve seen woman photographers adopt that way of working, it’s partly a sense of importance that allows them to archive their surrounding, and its partly a sense of organised history; that history was one thing and then it becomes another thing, then it goes to something else. It’s very ordered, I actually like that work a lot.\n\nIS: So do I, but it's the opposite of what you do.\n\nHC: It is the opposite. I don’t think the British have put up much of a challenge in terms of what they are doing in contemporary photography, and I think there are various reasons for that, and it’s an interesting problem that British artists have in terms of photographic work. But if you go to America, it has quite a strong history connected to the way they see their own history reproduced photographically – exhibitions such as The Family of Man or Robert Frank’s The Americans bear this out. Britain has a completely different history of engagement with photography. It’s had a lot of difficulty bringing photography into the present in a meaningful way. There’s Julia Margaret Cameron, and there’s my favourite photographer of all time, Roger Fenton and later photographers such as Bill Brandt but they didn’t create a trajectory which moved Britain forward in terms of defining a new photographic language.\n\nIS: How do you see your films in terms of film practice in general; as a filmmaker and an artist?\n\nHC: It’s really problematic because of the expectation of your audience. It’s not problematic because of the work, it’s problematic because there’s such a gap between the expectation of a film festival audience, and the expectation in an art gallery. And as film’s presence has grown in art galleries, people expect to spend time watching films in art galleries. Having said that, you can help them. For instance La Mina is a five-channel film, and the running time is 40 minutes, and the sound takes you from one place to another, so you’re physically encouraged to walk around the space in order to hear, and see different things. Because it’s five screens in a row, different connections are set up between the screens. It’s very flexible. You can have one story line or line of thought going on in three screens, and then it changes to two screens, and then the middle screen becomes a kind of centre for an authorial voice – that of the gypsy mediator – Tio Emilio. You’re asked to keep up with a rapid and logical pace of change. I edited La Mina on the west coast in America where there’s a certain film tradition which incorporates Indie narrative and experimental film. The film editor was part of that tradition and was happy to work in that way.\n\nIS: With La Mina, I think you get the sense that, because it’s five screens, you could walk into the gallery at any time. It behaves well in a gallery environment. Although there are certain stories that have a beginning, middle and an end.\n\nHC: Having said that it is flexible, I would like to be able to control the viewing situation in a gallery so visitors could only watch something from the beginning. La Mina was very carefully structured, it deals with architecture, then with the result of the architecture, and the impact it has on the people who live within that architecture, then it describes their relationship to mobility, and their life customs, then it has a break. It has three chapters. Each chapter is entirely different. The second chapter deals with rural gypsies that live just outside the city and how different their lives are, and what their relationship with space is, and what their relationship with night and day is. If you came in half way through and started with chapter two, you really would have a totally different relationship with the work.\n\nIS: La Mina was made in 2003/04, just as you were moving away from Spain to live in London and then teach at UC Davis on the west coast of the States. What prompted this shift into film making at this particular point in your career?\n\nHC: Before La Mina, I made two short films. I made one about an immigrant Bulgarian woman in Barcelona, with her daughter. It was 15 minutes long, and I shot it on film and then I did another one about a singer singing an aria. But La Mina was the first serious attempt to do something on a big scale, and it was very ambitious.\n\nLa Mina is a about the gypsy community who live on the outskirts of Barcelona. It is a closed society. The ambition was to describe this whole society through the descriptions of the people who wanted to be in the film, and to describe themselves. I attempt to show all aspects of live and death in their society, from their justice and education system to their folk traditions, music and rituals. It’s closest to a piece of poetry, it’s more like a poem, maybe an epic poem.\n\nIt was scripted by me, with the gypsies, and then acted by them. But in one sense they are always acting; their whole interface with society outside the gypsy community is that they act, because they’re constantly put into situations or have to deal with situations, where they’re completely unfamiliar with the surroundings that they’re in. For instance, if a gypsy family have to go to a judge when somebody dies, they resist autopsy, that’s a good example of it. And so the family will have to act in front of that judge, to try to avoid an autopsy being performed, which they would feel to be a violation of their culture. This involves them appearing to be something, which in their own society they would never appear to be.\n\nIS: So is it about the relationship of gypsy society to...\n\nHC: ... how do you manage to maintain a totally separate society over 500 years? I mean, even though things are known about gypsy culture, the particularities of different gypsy communities are not widely known. What was special about La Mina was that they chose to describe their own society. So the work was a kind of reflection on our own changing society in the face of a longstanding culture where the changes are much less apparent.\n\nIS: And what was unusual about that film was that you had that privileged insight, because you got to know particular people in that gypsy community with who you worked closely.\n\nHC: That’s true, and also true of the recent Russian work Current History (2007), which came out of getting to know someone through the gypsy network. Through La Mina, I got to know a Russian who was half Romany and half from a Russian intellectual background, so he had both sides. And what I wanted to make a film about was Russia.\n\nIS: I’ve seen Current History, the Russian film, only in a cinema setting as a split-screen work, so it seems to have a stronger sense of narrative and of juxtaposition. Was your shift into film making about a desire to work in narrative, because your photography isn’t, first and foremost about narrative at all.\n\nHC: No, my photography’s not about narrative, but I don’t think my film work is really about narrative either. It is about different narratives or various narratives that all come together, I don’t think it’s all one narrative that begins at a beginning and ends at an end, I think it’s various narratives. But that’s quite similar to my photographs, even the early photographs using cardboard and found materials. I remember it being very clearly about going and getting bits of cardboard from all over the place and then putting them together at this one time, and then returning them to the streets, so there was this recycling element to it, and also there was just this thing about the fact that these particular things would never be in that particular order again, and that they would return to another environment.\n\nIS: That work had quite a stagey kind of lighting. It seemed to reference homelessness ...\n\nHC: I think it referred to loads of different things all at the same time. It referred to the body a lot as well, to skin. I think they’re quite difficult to describe, because the description isn’t really the experience of looking at them.\n\nIS: I just mentioned that you were moving away from Spain around 2003/04 around the time you made La Mina. But what interested you about the idea of living in Spain in the first place? That happened around the late 1980s?\n\nHC: It happened around the time I was making the cardboard works. I’ve always loved Spanish art, and I’ve always had Spanish things in my life, because my great grandparents lived in Spain for 40 years. My great grandfather was a ship surveyor. I always had more of a relationship with Spain than say, France or Italy. I think it’s because I liked the art better.\n\nIS: And you visited there when you were young?\n\nHC: I went there first when I was nineteen in the mid 1970s, on my own, and I travelled around. It was quite difficult because Spain still had a fascist government so travelling alone as a woman was quite unheard of. I went to Madrid to see the Prado and I went to Alicante and Barcelona. But the main thing that prompted me to move to Spain was that I didn’t want to bring up a child in London, and it was during a recession so it was fairly depressed in London, and I just felt that I didn’t want the first few years of my daughter’s life to be like that. I knew that the Olympics would take place in Barcelona three years later so I knew the city would be optimistic for the next three years at least. And also I had a plan that I was going to come back to London in five years, but of course you don’t reckon on how much you’re going to change in that time. My whole life changed and I didn’t want to come back. And I did think it might be hard for my daughter Echo to be away from her own country for that many years, or not know her own country, and I did think, I wonder what’s going to happen in ten years’ time, but I just went on with it regardless.\n\nIS: And it turned in to how many years?\n\nHC: It turned into... it’s now 20 years because I still have a studio and make work in Barcelona and rent a flat there. And my gallery is there.\n\nWhen I went away to Spain, I felt that I saw things much more clearly in terms of my practice as an artist. It wasn’t that I responded differently to them, I just saw them more clearly.\n\nIS: Well there’s also lots of room for misinterpretation when you are in a different country.\n\nHC: Yes, which I’ve also been accused of in Spain, of misinterpreting things, because I simply don’t understand them well enough.\n\nIS: Culturally misinterpreting.\n\nHC: Yes, but that’s been quite useful. One thing that I had noticed is that Spanish people didn’t talk much about their own history when I first moved to live there. They’ve escaped from the British obsession with their own past by going somewhere else, and I went to a place where they simply didn’t talk about their past. And I didn’t question it very much at the time, and now I question it more, and I think, well, now Spain’s having to dig over and think about its past again, and it’s causing quite a lot of trauma. But when I went there, people were just so relieved to get away from what had happened to them, that they were sort of charging into the future and not worrying about what had happened in the past. So that affected how I saw art, actually, because it just meant that I saw everything in immediate terms, I wasn’t thinking about what had happened in 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960.\n\nIS: Your work is often situated in different countries, and I’m intrigued by what you look for or what you find in the very different cultures that you visit. I suppose what I’m asking is, what takes you to South Africa, or to Russia, or to India?\n\nHC: Maybe I am attracted to the moment when there is a regime change or a disappearing status quo or that a place that will simply cease to exist as it is at that time. The first time I really did a major trip was at an invitation from the British Council to go to Istanbul and make work. And that was blindness. I went to this place, I had no particular reason to go there, no particular feeling for it. I just went there. What I decided to do, which was a very particular situation, and quite uncomfortable, was simply to do it with the least possible information I could have. Not to read, not to understand, not to plan, not to investigate. The opposite to what I would now do.\n\nIS: And what work did you make...\n\nHC: I did a picture of a street, Signs of Life (1992), which was some of the work that was nominated for the Turner Prize in 1993, I think because it was so raw. It was a picture of a street, there was one picture of gypsies on a city wall, with big stones on the front. This work came just at a moment where I’d been quite enclosed in Spanish culture, I’d adapted a lot to Spain, showing work there. I was speaking Spanish, my daughter was in a Spanish school, my life was completely sort of wrapped up with Spanish life. And then when I went to Istanbul, it was a raw response to something. What I look for when I go somewhere is the physicality of the place, the complexities of one’s environment... there is something about being nomadic that allows you to absorb complexity in a way that if you belonged to it, you wouldn’t be able to do.\n\nIS: So you try to distance yourself from something to see it. Could this picture of Istanbul be of somewhere else?\n\nHC: It could be somewhere else, except that it was a city that had this particular place that was full of rotting rubbish, mostly animal hides, and animal parts that were on the street. What you see embedded into the walls is the result of the tanning processes. It was an old part of the city that hadn’t been redeveloped, and had a feeling of physical industrialness. It was the first image I made like that. For me it didn’t refer to anything else, it was just itself, and that was what I was trying to do, make an image that was itself – what you got was something quite complete, not something that was part of an essay about a city, or part of a description of somebody else’s life. Something very short and poetic. I started writing diaries, when I was there, and I’ve written diaries ever since when I’ve gone places, so that’s part of it as well.\n\nIS: These dejected places, for want of a better word, are places that have been left to crumble and self-destruct slowly.\n\nHC: Yes, but that gets you into the thought of, what does photography have to offer now?\n\nIS: What I’m trying to prompt you to talk about is your interest in texture and decay in the built environment. And also, when I look at this, or other images of urban spaces that are neglected, or falling apart, or empty, they are often completely or almost devoid of people.\n\nHC: Yes they are. The minute you put a person in a photographic image, you create a sense of scale, and unless you decide to play with this, you have dictated the scale of the image. Once the viewer views the person in the image, the relationship they have to the work is the scale of that person. There is one photograph of a metal factory in Poland with a man walking down a street, but the image isn’t dominated by the person, it’s dominated by a sort of stunted tree, so that helps to stop you from identifying immediately with the figure. But I think they’re more like stage sets, in that sense, they’re more like places where you might imagine a relationship with that person.\n\nIS: Or a film set.\n\nHC: Or a film set. I definitely think they have a relationship to film, that’s right.\n\nIS: I see these works in contrast to but also closely related to your photographs of the Mies van der Rohe Barcelona Pavilion taken over a decade later in 2003.\n\nHC: I think they’re a response to modernism, not a rejection of modernism, but a way of looking at what modernism has failed to address, and why, it has failed as a movement. That’s been my whole interest, really.\n\nSome of the reasons I am interested in decayed spaces is to do with my own personal background. That definitely is true, I identify with them, I understand them, I think about them, I’m aware of those kinds of spaces. I think that this has to do with the fact that my father was a Polish Jew whose family had immigrated to Britain and later in his life he became unwell and ended up living in one room and his life was more or less that of a vagrant. His living situation originally started as a commune in Sussex, so it had the idealism of Modernism, and then it had its decay.\n\nThe work that I made with the gypsies is specifically titled after the place, it’s not named after the people in that place, it's named after La Mina, which is a massive ghetto of Franco-built flats. They have no relationship to Modernism. My central force is how did the world develop architecturally. That’s what interests me in art as ideology.\n\nI would say it was impossible for me to work with something where I had never come across any of its attributes before. If I go to a place and I cannot identify with any aspect of it, I would find it very difficult to make work there. For instance, the location in the Russian work was specifically chosen because, first of all, I can relate to the Socialist ideal. I might not go with it, but I can relate with it.\n\nIS: But it’s clearly failed in your film, Current History (2007), where we follow the story of an extended family who live in a small, very traditional village just outside Nizhny Novgorod, the third largest city in Russian. You are constantly made aware of the relationship to the city and post-soviet economic struggle, as it can be viewed in the distance.\n\nHC: It’s failed, exactly. On the other hand, it’s still present as something that has passed and had been there.\n\nPerhaps all of this relates to why I’ve moved about a lot. If I was very English and I’d been brought up in a household where what is valued is the permanence of family, or the place where you live, or traditions of a particular type... none of those three things were valued in my childhood, not one of them. I didn’t have a sense of permanence and place, although I did in fact have more or less permanence in Britain, but I didn’t have a sense that that was where I came from, particularly. And then I didn’t have a sense of traditions, because my father came from a Jewish family, but was sort of in denial about it. But what I did have was a history of thought, the history of the possibility of thought, the idea of where thought could take you, and I suppose that’s what I was interested in about Russia; that thought that had taken Russia to a certain point where it changed, and then what had happened after that change.\n\nIS: I remember you talking about the Russian family, the extended family that you filmed, and you described their way of thinking. The film enacts a set of their collisions such as the city against the country, or the urban against the rural, just as it does different modes of thought – that which is intellectualised and that which is direct.\n\nHC: I’m just reading this book about Stalin, and that opposition is there too. In fact it was set up at that time; essentially the peasants were oppressed and degraded and given no human respect. The film’s an exploration of the relationship between, say, the soviet building – massive blocks of flats, decayed, brutalist modernist flats – and then there’s these wooden decorated houses, and the two exist side by side in Russia, as they do in other places. And also the film engages with idea of the place of nature. It is also a descriptive film about winter; it was supposed to be a white film. It didn’t turn out very white, but the idea was a white film.\n\nThe film was also based in part on Isaac Babel’s writing. He was influenced by Chekhov and exposed the brutality of Stalinist Russian and was eventually murdered under the regime. They are short stories, just a few pages long, they’re almost like Haiku poems; incredible, intense human stories, all contained in just a few pages, they explore aspects of human behaviour in that environment.\n\nIS: A word that you use when you talk about a loose series of photographs that you have taken over a number of years that look at the notion of the site of memorial, is nostalgia. Thinking partly about the Russian film and also about this series of images, I wonder how travelling to these places was ...\n\nHC: ... in itself is a nostalgic act.\n\nIS: Exactly. That’s what I’m wondering.\n\nHC: Well, I don’t think my trip to South Africa was particularly nostalgic. IS: No, but maybe going to Poland where your father’s family came from...\n\nHC: Poland perhaps was quite nostalgic, but then and I’m not quite sure to what extent nostalgia is about absence; about something that’s not present, and in my case... I think it’s quite a basic human instinct to want to know where you come from, and that for me, was part of that journey.\n\nIS: When you write about your image of the Hunter’s Space from the series called In the Course of Time taken in 1995 in a Warsaw Cemetery, you talk about a dead tree, next to which there is a little sapling. And you talk about it as a place of memorial, and inside this place there’s both the past and the future. A more recent photograph of a memorial is the one of Nelson Mandela’s teenage home, an extremely modest, impoverished dwelling. Can you talk a bit about your interest in the memorial?\n\nHC: I’ve taken a number of works over the years that I consider to be images of memorials. For me these works are similar to domestic-scale land art. There are traces of the thing that it has originally been and can also be understood in relation to other traces made over long periods of time. Like the image I made 15 years ago in Istanbul has a completely clear relationship with the monument of Nelson Mandela’s home as a teenager that I made this year. And you could put them side by side, and they would read completely coherently and consistently. They are both kind of monuments to the overlooked and the discarded, and both place the emphasis on the tenacity of human beings in relation to their environment. The amazing thing about Nelson Mandela’s teenage home as a monument is that it’s there at all. Not that it has an ability to be monumental in a ‘monumental way’ but just that it’s a monument to the possibility of doing anything in this world.\n\nIS: And it’s also a monument to somebody before they became the figure that we know them as now.\n\nHC: Exactly, and we want Mandela to be a reasonable human being, we want him to have triumphed in the world because we’ve given him that status, we want him to be effective in changing things. He’s a symbol, his own personal life is kind of irrelevant to that. When there’s the monumental made out of the everyday, and the everyday is so obviously humble, the status that it has, has nothing to do with its physical reality. I suppose what I tried to do when I photographed it was to allow myself to imagine that I was Mandela living in that space. I want the viewer to become Mandela when they look at the space, which I think is sort of what happens. A kind of empathy.\n\nBefore you know what it is, you just think of it as a domestic, human abstract space. It’s only when you know what it is, that it becomes something else. It’s only a possibility, it was never more than a possibility at that time.\n\nIS: It’s a kernel of his greatness, isn’t it.\n\nHC: It is exactly that. I also went to where Mao grew up in China and it’s quite similar. Although Mandela’s is a truly abandoned space made into a monument, Mao’s is absolutely revered and monumentalised by the Chinese authorities, which has made it into a very pompous place; it isn’t monumentalised visually and physically; it has just been given status. The photograph of Mandela’s hut is printed on very thin fragile paper, and it’s the size of a wall, so it’s big, and very damageable. I wanted the physical image to have equilibrium with it’s subject – the two things to meet in the middle.\n\nIS: I don’t know why, but I’m thinking about the photograph of the little kids in La Mina who are drawing with chalk on the ground, and why you photographed that (Paseo Cameron 2, 2004). If that connects...\n\nHC: That’s quite similar actually. On a hot Summer’s day the children of La Mina who live in tiny apartments make these drawings on the street, all sorts of amazing things at different scales, so an eye can be huge, and a horse can be tiny. These massive collections of drawings get rubbed off the pavement each night so in the morning the drawing begins again. They draw a mixture of what is their everyday life, and what might be their lives. In a way it’s a performance as an action and in another way it’s also got lots of statuses at the same time. So it’s got the status of almost a filmic quality to it, and then it’s got the status of the anticipation of an event, and then it’s got the status of making... you know, it’s about somebody making their version of art, in a way, or certainly of expression, not art but expression. So it’s got lots of different layers to its being on a piece of paper on a wall, and in that sense, it is quite similar to the Mandela one, yes. It’s a sort of monument of an anti-monument.\n\nIS: Yes, they do connect in my head, maybe it’s to do with...\n\nHC: In the background of that photograph there is a statue of the gypsy God of music, Cameron; he is singing. The street is also named after him. I think he is the most important gypsy musician ever, and he is very important to the people that live there. So there is an image of a monument in the picture.\n\nIS: Your work is not autobiographical in any meaningful way, is it?\n\nHC: I’ve written autobiographical stuff, but I don’t quite know what to do with it. I suppose I see it as being a bit limiting, if something is strictly autobiographical. Why would I put myself directly as an image into my art? Some people do it and some people don’t. And in my case, I think when I become more than a shadowy presence in my own art, the art, from my point of view ceases to be interesting. And also, we live in an era of obsession with self-image.\n\nIS: In your artist’s book Finding, Transmitting, Receiving, one of the images is a drawing by you, made in 1961, the titled Myself with a Ghost. I can see why you’re drawn to these childhood drawings, and to use them. In the book you’ve placed this picture alongside found images of postcards and photographs that you collected in Russia. Why did you decide to include this in this context?\n\nHC: One of the gypsies said something to me, which I think is quite interesting. When I look at the past, it’s something that’s behind me, so when I think about myself as a body, the past is physically behind me, and the future is physically in front of me. But when gypsies look at the past, the past is physically in front of their eyes, and the future is behind their backs. So it’s a complete reversal. But the way I think about imaging the past, it’s definitely something that’s behind me, you know, it’s something that creeps up on me or something, it’s not something that I go and face, which is culturally different to some other people, I think. And I think the way contemporary culture is constructed is to do with one’s interrelationship with the past. It’s certainly quite important where it physically is in relationship to you, you know, what you think it ought to be. The image of Myself with a Ghost was included because I remember it as one of the first times I understood myself to be a separate human being in the world, so I drew a ghost to keep me company on my journey through life.\n\nIS: I want to talk about the relationship with still life in your work, and how it keeps coming back as a motif, and also the idea of intimacy.\n\nHC: Historically, photography adopts languages for different purposes. Roger Fenton who I’ve mentioned and Steiglitz and others developed languages for different aspects of the world as it was visualised then, which was informed through painting. When I make something like a still life, it’s not really informed by painting, I think it’s more informed by an act of doing something, an intimate act. What is in common with painting is it’s quite a studio-based activity, so in that sense, it’s in opposition to going out and finding a place that exactly meets criteria for things crossing over with one another, because when you bring things to a studio, you combine things to make the still life. I think about things like Velazquez’s painting of the Old Woman Cooking Eggs, where the viewer is witness to a sort of act of alchemy. It’s halfway between being a still life and being a historical action photograph, or domestic painting.\n\nIS: That reminds me of one of the earlier large photographs you did, which I remember finding completely intriguing and almost a bit incomprehensible. It shows a man spinning plates (The Platespinner, 1986). It was of an action but strangely, perhaps like the Velazquez, it is also a still life.\n\nHC: It was. Well it was also asking somebody to maintain something in perpetual motion and then stopping that through a photograph, essentially a paradoxical act. Which is what painting can do. It can stop something in the act, and it also takes quite a long time to do the act that stops the action, so you’ve got all these different times, and that’s what I took from painting, and incorporated into photography. And the fact that I use a big format camera means you’re always looking at the edge of something rather than looking at... I don’t ever crop anything from the edge of the image; the whole of the negative is usually used for printing. The negative has an edge, and that is the defined edge, you can’t extend beyond that. That is where you’ve cut off the image, and I think that’s how I started making still lives. I was taking notice of the edge, and what could go within it, which is similar to making a still life painting, working out what could go into your painting.\n\nIS: But with this early series of black and white still life images there were no people in them, and then you photographed a person.\n\nHC: That’s right, but that happened almost by accident. What was quite interesting about him was that he was a Russian plate spinner from the Moscow State Circus who’d come to marry a policeman’s daughter in England. He was very aware of his own body, because he was a performer, so it was almost impossible to take a bad photograph. He was so used to being looked at, every movement he made was done with a kind of aesthetic in mind. Also as a performer he was aware that each performance was slightly different.\n\nIS: Like he was constructing the image?\n\nHC: Yes, he was constructing the image. Essentially it was an image of a private performance.\n\nIS: When you were making work as a student, painting, you were taking photographs of performances, is that right?\n\nHC: I did do some. I was certainly surrounded by performance people, and I had the option of becoming a painter or moving more towards performance and I was always somewhere in between, I could never work out where I really ought to be, and I think it’s because I didn’t really fit with any of them. I couldn’t stand the act of painting, and spending months and months on one image. I found that very difficult to do. But when I made photographic images, I no longer found it difficult for some reason. I think it was because there were moments of clarity. With painting, you do get those moments, but it’s not marked by anything, whereas with a photograph, it’s marked by a series of processes. I enjoyed working in total darkness to develop an image exactly as you want it. Something that you know to be there, you’ve see what you’ve photographed and you’ve seen it in the back of the camera, but you’ve never seen it as a negative, which is a flat piece of gelatine. You don’t really know what’s contained in the negative, and you bring that to fruition by developing it. You’ve got lots of choices about where you go with it, and that’s what I liked.\n\nIS: And also just seeing the image appear is also filmic for the maker.\n\nHC: Yes, and it’s also negative, and negative to positive is a whole other change. All those changes made a big difference to how I would think about the subject matter, and what I would do with it, and what I understood as far as scale was concerned. All photography is a kind of performance at some level. You’re bringing about an image out of nothing. When you draw an image, you start with your support, which could be your piece of paper or wall, or whatever you decide to draw on, each line adds to that image, whereas with photography you get a series of shocks, which bring about the potential for that image, to come to fruition and become something. After I did the plate spinner, I started taking pictures of salt, and images that were accumulations of things. The salt was like little grains of something that you could push together int"
