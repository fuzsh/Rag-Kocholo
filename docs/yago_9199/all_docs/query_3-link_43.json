        "text": "Enamorada is set during the Mexican Revolution and follows the attempt of a revolutionary general, Juan José Reyes, in winning the love of upper-class beauty Beatriz Peñafiel. Reyes begins the film as a ruthless and macho solider who has taken over the town of Cholula. While mercilessly taking money from the town and sending its inhabitants to the “fusiladoras,” Reyes becomes enamored by Beatriz and insists that he is going to marry her. Beatriz is an independent, and feisty member of the aristocratic class who is engaged to be married to a wealthy U.S. citizen. In several comedic scenes displaying the non-traditional “macha” personality of Beatriz, she rejects Reyes’ advances. As the plot progresses, what connects these two seemingly unlikely individuals together is the Catholic Church. Through the character of the priest, who is both an old-time friend of Reyes and a long-time supporter of Beatriz, he reconciles the differences between Beatriz and Reyes. Reyes learns to relax his militaristic and brute personality, while Beatriz adopts some of the docile femininity characteristic required of the traditional Mexican woman. At the end of the movie, Beatriz leaves her fiancé, and decides to follow after Reyes and his revolutionary troops as a soldadera.\n\nThe narrative is centered around the social transformations caused by the revolution and the divisions between the bourgeoise class and the revolutionary impetus. Furthermore, the characterization of the feminine versus the masculine in this film serves to redefine the national archetype of gender that was purported by Mexican society during the revolutionary era.\n\nTimecode\n\n01:04:28-01:04:55\n\nProp\n\nThe Catholic Church\n\nExplanation\n\nThe use of the Catholic Church and the symbol of the cross is evident throughout “Enamorada.” In this still, Beatriz and Reyes are centered in the frame with the church fixed between them in the background. There is an uneasy and almost sexual tension between the two characters, but the chapel’s foreboding presence in the background suggests that this tension will soon be resolved through the church. Every time that the church appears, whether that be through the symbol of the cross or the appearance of the priest, Beatriz and Reyes undergo a character transformation that reconciles their seemingly opposite personalities.\n\nFilm Still\n\nLighting\n\nExplanation\n\nIn this still, backlighting illuminates the silhouettes of a revolutionary army as Beatriz hurries down the street in pursuit of her newly acquired love, Juan José Reyes. The high-contrast lighting adds to the dramatism of this moment, as Beatriz is rejecting her upper-class lifestyle to follow Reyes as a soldadera and join the revolutionary cause. This studio lighting positions Beatriz in the background of the shot, a reversal of her position in the first shot of the film where she stood in the foreground. The use of lighting enhances the expressive potential of the film by emphasizing the way in which gender and class relations have been reversed.\n\nTimecode\n\n01:34:21-01:34:27\n\nFilm Still\n\nExample\n\nBeatriz Peñafiel\n\nExplanation\n\nThis still is the first shot in which the protagonist, Beatriz, makes an appearance. Her presence is very influential for several reasons. First, Beatriz is played by María Félix, an immensely popular actress during the period. The use of the star system in this film helped to generate large crowds and revenue because viewers were fans of María Félix. Secondly, the grouping of characters before the camera conveys a power dynamic that is not typical of society during this era. Beatriz is in the foreground, and her stance combined with the gun that she is holding suggests a position of decisive power. The position of the upper-class gentleman and the priest in the background behind Beatriz is opposed to the typical submissiveness of the female presence. Lastly, the stern and serious facial expression of Beatriz establishes her character as strong, determined, and masculinized. While she does not say much, her presence guides the viewer’s attention to her dominance within the frame.\n\nTimecode\n\n00:07:48-00:08:18\n\nFilm Still\n\nExplanation\n\nThis clip highlights the difference between the machismo of Juan José Reyes and the “macha” attitude of Beatriz that is woven through the entire plot of “Enamorada.” In this scene, upper-class Beatriz walks through the town square where Reyes is with a group of revolutionary troops. As Beatriz approaches, Reyes crassly comments on her beauty and the fact that he can see her legs underneath her skirt. As is in line with Beatriz’s feisty attitude, she slaps Reyes on the cheek because of his comments. Not only does this scene emphasize the theme of gender and class tension in the film, but it also provides some comic relief that is indicative of the screwball comedy genre.\n\nTimecode\n\n00:31:35-00:33:30\n\nFilm Still\n\nQuality\n\nTimecode\n\n01:24:27-01:24:45\n\nFilm Still\n\nFraming\n\nTimecode\n\n01:01:30-01:01:35\n\nFilm Still\n\nScale\n\nTimecode\n\n01:05:11-01:05:16\n\nFilm Still\n\nScale\n\nTimecode\n\n01:15:31-01:15:43\n\nFilm Still\n\nMovement\n\nTimecode\n\n00:03:45–00:04:20\n\nFilm Still\n\nExpansion and Compression of Time\n\nTimecode\n\n1:32:35-1:35:32\n\nFilm Still"
