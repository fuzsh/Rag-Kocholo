I would like to thank them now. Several experts in the field gave their time and expertise. Back in the days when the Society for Cinema and Media Studies was the Society for Cinema Studies, Ana López and I were on a conference workshop panel on Latin American cinema. Her presentation was on La mancha de sangre, which had just been discovered after being believed lost for decades. Ana’s perceptive talk, which included handouts and clips from the film, piqued my interest and eventually led, all these years later, to the analysis of La mancha de sangre that I include in chapter 8.\n\nI first saw El automóvil gris at a working conference on Latin American cinema that Chon Noriega organized and hosted at the UCLA Film and Television Archive in 1995. Chon asked me to lead an impromptu presentation after a screening of the film. Thank you, Chon, for forcing me to begin analyzing the film on the spot—that was the beginning of chapter 3. More thanks to Chon and the UCLA Film and Television Archive for allowing me the opportunity to view and study El automóvil gris at the time, before it became available on DVD. This book would not have happened at all had it not been for Fernando Fabio Sánchez. He kindly invited me to give the keynote address at Cine-Lit VII, the international Hispanic film and literature conference held in\n\nFACING: Detail of figure 5.30.\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd ix\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nPortland in February 2011. It was while I was working on that keynote, a talk on the poetics of Fernando de Fuentes’s Revolution Trilogy, that the idea for this book suddenly crystalized in my mind. In addition, Fernando graciously shared rare silent Mexican documentaries from his collection that helped me better understand early filmmaking in Mexico. Patricia Torres San Martín, professor in the Department of History at the University of Guadalajara and one of the top historians of Mexican cinema, read a draft version of the Fernández chapter and provided valuable feedback on it. She also helped with the overall argument of the book, and encouraged me to include a section on La mancha de sangre. I would like to thank the José Clemente Orozco Foundation, headed by Clemente Orozco, the artist’s son, for permission to reproduce three of his father’s lithographs. Closer to home, I would like to thank Paul Stekler, the chair of the Department of Radio-Television-Film at the University of Texas, where I teach. It is always heartening to have the backing of your boss, and over the years Paul has enthusiastically championed my teaching, my research, and me. A tip of the hat to all my estimable colleagues in the department for their friendship and their intellectual sustenance. Because every student touches and inspires me in one way or another, I can say that all of them helped in this project. Special thanks to those who took my Mexican film history class, read draft chapters of this book, and took the time to give me their comments and corrections. Two students assisted me directly: Isabella Cook helped during the initial writing stages, and Emily R. Pellerin did some much appreciated copyediting.\n\nx\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd x\n\nDuring the book’s writing I was supported by a Faculty Research Assignment, sponsored by the University of Texas at Austin and administered by Roderick Hart, dean of the Moody College of Communication. My thanks to the university, the college, and Dean Hart for having faith in my project and in me. The university assisted me in another important way. Because many of the films analyzed here are little known, I wanted this book to be abundantly illustrated. A generous Book Subvention Grant from the Office of the Vice President for Research helped pay for some of the additional costs involved in reproducing those images. As someone who does research on Mexican cinema, I am extremely lucky to have the Nettie Lee Benson Latin American Library in my backyard. It is recognized as one of the great repositories of Latin American books and materials in the world, and Margo Gutierrez, librarian for Latina and Latino studies, was extremely helpful, as was the entire staff. A writer is only as good as his editor, and in my case I had two of the best. Jim Burr, senior sponsoring editor at the University of Texas Press, helped in countless ways throughout the process, and was particularly invaluable in getting the book from the pile of manuscript pages that I submitted to the book you hold in your hands. For the third time, I was fortunate to have a book included in the Texas Film and Media Series, edited by Tom Schatz. Tom is one of the most knowledgeable film and media historians of our time, a gifted writer, and a brilliant editor. Once again, his insightful comments helped me to say what I was trying to say. The production team did such a wonderful job of transforming my pages into this\n\nThe Classical Mexican Cinema\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nbeautiful book that I wanted to thank each one personally. A good copyeditor helps a writer look good in public and I had an excellent one, Sue Carter, who cheerfully checked details, improved wording, and pressed for clarity. Knowing the talented designers who work for the Press, I expected a nice-looking book, but when I first saw Lindsay Starr’s stunning design for the cover and the book, it took my breath away. In creating this exquisite showcase for the artistry of el Cine de Oro, Lindsay created art herself. Lynne Chapman, the manuscript editor, professionally oversaw the entire process, carefully coordinating text and design while keeping me on track and on schedule. I will always be grateful to Lynne for scrutinizing every word and illustration, refining my phrasing, and providing an endless supply of ingenious solutions. My deepest thanks to you all for your expertise, good will, and creativity. When I published my first book on Mexican cinema, I had three school-age children who provided me with lots of love, humor, and morale boosting. Now they are grown and married with children of their own. They, their spouses, and their children helped get me through the writing of this book in a million ways, large and small. They made me laugh, kept me sane, and reminded me on\n\na daily basis how blessed I am just to know them—and especially to love and be loved by them. So thank you: Charles and Courtney, Xavi, and Santiago; Anne-Marie and Nate, Grant, and Charlie; Christina and William, Jake, Nate, Wills, and Jase. Just before starting this book, I lost both parents in an emotionally trying eighteenmonth stretch. I want to take a moment to honor them and all they did for me. They gave me life and unconditional love. They modeled decency, compassion, kindness, patience, and understanding. They were my first teachers, and I carry the lessons I learned from them into every classroom. They were my foundation, and they, too, were part of this book. Thank you, Hortensia and Gerald, for everything. Finally, a pat on the back to my older brother, Gary, who took me to see my very first movie. When I was three years old and he was already in high school, Gary took me to the Plaza Theater in El Paso to see Cinderella. From the moment the lights went down and the first images appeared on the screen I fell under cinema’s spell—overwhelmed, enthralled, and enchanted. That was the beginning of my lifetime love affair with the movies.\n\nNEXT SPREAD: Detail of figure 6.51.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd xi\n\nxi\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd xii\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nThe Classical Mexican Cinema\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd xiii\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd xiv\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nIntroduction RETHEORIZING MEXICAN F I L M H I S T ORY\n\n/\n\nI\n\nN 1992, when I published Cinema of Solitude: A Critical Study of Mexican Film, 1967–1983, it was the first book-length critical study of Mexican cinema in English. Since then, I am happy to report, there has been a boom in the research and publishing of Mexican film history and criticism, both in English and in Spanish. It is heartening to see so much work of such high quality busily investigating Mexico’s rich and fascinating cinema. This flourishing Mexican film literature has employed numerous approaches and covered all historical periods, from the earliest days of the medium’s arrival in Mexico, through the silent era, the Golden Age, the subsequent crisis in the 1960s, the resurgence\n\n(Mexico’s Nuevo Cine) of the ’70s, the lull in the ’80s and ’90s, to its current renaissance in this millennium with the rise of contemporary auteurs such as Alfonso Cuarón, Guillermo del Toro, María Novarro, Alejandro González Iñárritu, Carlos Reygadas, Luis Estrada, Mariana Chenillo, and Fernando Eimbcke, among others. Some critics and historians, myself included, have focused their attention on the Cine de Oro, the transformative two-decade-long Golden Age that lasted from the mid-1930s to the late 1950s. During that time, Mexican cinema rose from near extinction at the end of the silent era to become the most successful Latin American cinema and the leading Spanish-language film industry in the world.\n\nFACING: Detail of figure 6.48.\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 1\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nBut despite the flurry of research and publishing, the systematic study of the style of Mexican cinema has hardly been touched upon. Other than Eduardo de la Vega Alfaro’s monograph on Sergei Eisenstein in Mexico,1 articles I have published (which have been extensively reworked here), an essay by Evan Lieberman and Kerry Hegarty,2 and another by Patrick Keating,3 the investigation of the poetics of Mexican films in general and of the most honored films of the Golden Age in particular is still in its infancy. This book addresses that lack by examining the poetics of the Golden Age’s Classical Mexican Cinema, the name I have given to the era’s most esteemed films. My investigation concentrates on the development of Mexican film in the first half of the twentieth century. Beginning with the pre-cinema and early cinema period at the turn of the previous century, I analyze the illustrations of the prolific artist, cartoonist, and illustrator José Guadalupe Posada to note how his engravings set the stage for the Mexican filmmakers who would soon follow. My claim is that Posada was the font from which Mexican film as a whole and what I call the Classical Mexican Cinema flowed. Then I examine the poetics of Enrique Rosas’s El automóvil gris (1919), the crowning achievement of Mexico’s silent filmmaking. Based on an infamous string of revolution-era crimes, this remarkable docudrama marked the national cinema’s transition from documentaries that dominated national filmmaking from its inception in 1896 to the mid-1910s to narrative films that have commanded Mexican film production ever since. As such, El automóvil gris set the stage for the Golden Age films that came after the introduction of sound.\n\n2\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 2\n\nThis is followed by a chapter covering the beginning of Mexican sound films in the early 1930s and the resulting rebirth of Mexico’s cinema production. After that are three chapters that focus on the films produced by the predominant Golden Age auteurs of three successive decades: Fernando de Fuentes’s influential Revolution Trilogy from the 1930s; the collaboration of Emilio Fernández and his filmmaking unit, especially the films they made during the 1940s; and the Mexican films of the Spaniard Luis Buñuel, who moved to Mexico in the mid-1940s, became a Mexican citizen, and directed more than twenty films there during the next nineteen years. My last analytical chapter looks at three exceptional genre films directed by three important Golden Age directors—Juan Bustillo Oro, Adolfo Best Maugard, and Julio Bracho—in the 1930s and 1940s. Methodology: Neoformalism, Neoauteurism, and Cultural Studies My analytical method combines neoformalism and neoauteurism, which will be deployed within a cultural studies framework. Neoformalist analysis is the “poetics of film” approach pioneered by Kristin Thompson in Breaking the Glass Armor: Neoformalist Film Analysis (1988),4 and used extensively since then by her and David Bordwell in numerous books, articles, and blog posts.5 In part, The Classical Mexican Cinema is modeled on Bordwell’s Narration in the Fiction Film and, to an extent, his books on Yasujiro Ozu (Ozu and the Poetics of Cinema) and Carl Theodore Dreyer (The Films of Carl-Theodor Dreyer).6 Because so little formal analysis of Mexican films exists, this approach provides me with\n\nThe Classical Mexican Cinema\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nan orderly way of detailing the style of the Classical Mexican Cinema of the Golden Age. Moreover, neoformalism has a number of other investigative benefits, enumerated by Bordwell in his second introduction to his Ozu book:\n\nFurthermore, there is no reason why neoformalism cannot aid in unveiling a film’s ideological stance. In Ozu and the Poetics of Cinema, Bordwell used the results of his poetics of cinema analysis as the basis for a discussion about how those films transmitted political ideology.10 Indeed, I did much the same thing in chapter 2 of Latino Images in Through the lens of poetics we can Film, where I performed a thorough neosystematically study a director’s subjects, formalist reading of a four-minute scene in themes, formal strategies, and stylistic Falling Down (1992) in order to demonstrate strategies, taken in relation to the normhow following the standardized practices of driven practices of his period and place. Hollywood filmmaking may inadvertently The poetics framework is historical, serve to perpetuate the stereotyping of ethnic because it mounts causal explanations of minorities.11 Of course, a lot depends on how the movies’ distinctive qualities. It’s also the critical method is employed. To be sure, analytical, because it asks us to scrutinize neoformalism can be practiced in an overly choices made by the director.7 narrow, reductive, and shortsighted way—as can any analytical approach. However, apSince studying the subjects, themes, and plied appropriately, which I hope to do here, formal and stylistic strategies of the aforeit need not be. mentioned Mexican filmmakers and their A second key analytical tool I utilize in films is precisely my goal, the poetics of film this book is neoauteurism. Just as neoformalapproach perfectly suits my objectives here. ism is a reconceptualized version of formalI recognize that some critics regard the ism, neoauteurism is similarly a more nukind of neoformalist analysis practiced by anced rethinking of auteurism, the analysis Thompson and Bordwell as ahistorical and 8 antithetical to cultural studies, but I don’t see of films based on who directed them. Here I take my cues from two critics whose work anything inherent in the method that makes I deeply respect, Robin Wood and Dolores it so. Indeed, as Bordwell himself states, the Tierney. Both of them have published signifipoetics of cinema approach is meant to investigate style within a context, “in relation,” cant works on individual directors12 without that is, “to the norm-driven practices” of the resorting to vulgar auteurism of the sort director’s period and place. Properly utilized, whereby the critic simplistically searches for then, neoformalism is historical. It situates patterns of directorial flourishes that prove filmmakers and their films in a particular authorship and provide a reason for assigning time and place. And it is analytical—not directors to a cinematic pantheon. I am aware merely descriptive—since it carefully consid- of the problems occasioned by the excesses of ers the choices directors made and asks why early examples of auteurist criticism, which 9 they made them. are neatly summarized by Wood:\n\nR E T H EOR I Z I NG M E X ICAN F I L M H IS TORY\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 3\n\n3\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nAuteurism emphasized the personal signature at the expense of everything else (sometimes valuing a director’s work just because it could be demonstrated to have one) and, at the worst, claimed or at least implied that the author was solely and exclusively responsible for the meaning and quality of his texts. Its opponents countered this by pointing out that the author did not invent the language and conventions of his medium, the genre within which the work was located, the ideological assumptions inherent in the culture and necessarily reproduced . . . in the individual text; neither did the author control the conditions of production.13\n\nBy using the term “neoauteurism,” I mean to signal the use of a more finely calibrated type of analysis of a director’s body of work. Like Tierney in her masterful study of Emilio Fernández, I concede that I am taking a “director-centered approach”14 in this book. And like Wood, in his influential book on Hitchcock, while using it I will strive “to take into account and make use of the many valuable critical developments” of the past thirty or so years in film studies, including, as Wood puts it, “work on generic convention, the principles of classical narrative, the construction of ‘classical Hollywood films’ both overall and from shot to shot, stars and how they signify, [and] the relations of films to our culture’s construction of gender.”15 Naturally, I’ll do this within the Mexican context. And I’ll take note of the play of ideology—both personal and social—within an individual film, across a body of work, within myself, and as it inflects my own critical assumptions.\n\n4\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 4\n\nThough I am still following the standard auteurist methodology—looking for stylistic patterns and their repetition within a particular director’s body of work—it is my aim to be attentive enough to see the forest and the trees. One crippling pitfall of auteurism as it is sometimes practiced is that while going about its business of spotting an overarching directorial style across a director’s filmography, it fails to fully appreciate individual works, especially when they break from established patterns. This type of auteurism thus makes criticism a self-fulfilling prophecy—finding the pattern, looking for its repetitions, and ignoring elements that don’t fit. Here I have tried to be alive to patterns as well as to their absence, and to be alert to a director discarding one style in favor of another, since this might signal a new phase in an artist’s work, perhaps inaugurating a new pattern. Thus, for example, I note how the exhilarating cinematic experimentation exhibited in de Fuentes’s Revolution Trilogy is largely absent in the films he made afterward; how Fernández’s 1950s films differ so markedly from those he made the previous decade; and how Buñuel’s Mexican films evolved stylistically as they became more surreal. I will ground my neoformalist and neoauteurist analyses in a cultural studies approach, situating the films I treat within several contexts: historical, social, cultural, economic, industrial, ideological, and—because so much of Mexican filmmaking history revolves around its filmmakers’ vexed relationship to Hollywood—global. Films are never produced in a vacuum, and it behooves the historian and critic to be aware of and sensitive to the complex network of\n\nThe Classical Mexican Cinema\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nmotivations, decisions, dreams, and desires bound up in the making of each one. This is the reason I begin a book on Golden Age cinema by examining the cultural history of image making in Mexico at the turn of the twentieth century. Starting there is the best way to appreciate how the work of the prolific printmaker José Guadalupe Posada created a visual template that the next generation of artists and filmmakers would use as they set out to create authentic Mexican art forms. Posada profoundly influenced artists like David Alfaro Siqueiros, José Clemente Orozco, and Diego Rivera, and they in turn influenced filmmakers such as director Emilio Fernández and cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa. Another example highlights the discrepancy that may arise between artistic intention and viewer reception. Emilio Fernández was proud of his Kikapú Indian ancestry. So it is no surprise that what brought him to the attention of international audiences and critics was María Candelaria (1943), a film where two top Mexican movie stars, Dolores del Río and Pedro Armendáriz, played indigenous protagonists. And yet despite the fact that Fernández’s goal was to celebrate indios and expose their deplorable treatment, the film’s depiction of them is deeply conflicted. At best, it sent mixed messages about Mexico’s indigenous people; at worst, it was yet another stereotypical representation of them. One more example will illustrate the necessity for the film critic to be aware of multiple contexts in analyzing a director’s work. This is especially important for neoformalist critics, and serves as a reminder that, from time to time, we need to step back\n\nR E T H EOR I Z I NG M E X ICAN F I L M H IS TORY\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 5\n\nfrom our close readings and take the bigger picture into account. This case demonstrates the complexities of international political and economic dynamics, and reveals how events may push and pull filmmakers in different ways, impact filmmaking, and shape a nation’s film culture. Let’s consider the reopening of global film markets after World War II and the diverse effects it had on two masterful Golden Age directors, Emilio Fernández and Luis Buñuel. For the first, the change severely damaged his standing as Mexico’s most lauded auteur and spelled the beginning of the end of his career. For the other, the reopened European markets brought him to the attention of international film financiers, which led to more filmmaking possibilities, reinvigorated his cinematic creativity, and helped popularize him as one of the foremost auteurs of world cinema. After 1950, Emilio Fernández’s films began looking more mainstream, containing fewer elements of the signature style he had developed in the 1940s. One reason was that he wasn’t always able to work with the team of collaborators that had assisted him in his ’40s films. Another was the overall decline in the quality of Mexican filmmaking in the 1950s, due to falling box office receipts, dwindling profits, and shrinking budgets. These were primarily caused by a change in Hollywood’s attitude toward the Mexican movie market. During World War II, at the urging of the U.S. government, Hollywood backed off from dominating Mexico’s film market. With the war over and the U.S. no longer in need of a strong hemispheric ally, Hollywood aggressively sought to recapture Mexico’s screens. Its success devastated\n\n5\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nMexican filmmaking. Consequently, Fernández had to scramble to make films for less money and on shorter schedules than he had become accustomed to in the 1940s. His films suffered along with his reputation. Ironically, this downturn in Mexican filmmaking had a salubrious affect on Buñuel. A disciplined filmmaker who prepared meticulously, he had learned to operate with tight budgets and on short schedules. As he gradually gained the ability to make the films he wanted to make, many of his releases were well received nationally and internationally, and his career blossomed in the 1950s. His films’ increasing critical and commercial success outside of Mexico led to his securing foreign financing for his projects. Eventually, Buñuel moved his filmmaking to Europe, and the films of his second French period found a large international art film audience. Thus a single historic event, the postwar shift in movie marketing and financing, impacted the fates of two Classical Mexican Cinema directors in contrasting ways, bad for one, good for the other. There was nothing positive about the net effect on Mexican film culture, however. It was disastrous. Mexico lost two star auteurs, the quality of films dropped significantly, the Golden Age ended, and Mexican moviegoers abandoned their national cinema. Mexican film spiraled into a long decline, the most drastic since the 1920s. As I hope this brief historical sketch indicates, as much as possible I will place my close readings within multiple contexts, and always consider the implications of my findings on the broader story of Mexican cinema—and vice versa.\n\n6\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 6\n\nMexico’s Filmic Golden Age: The Classical Mexican Cinema and the Mainstream Mexican Cinema Mexico’s movie industry can be traced back to the earliest days of silent film, but as the nation rebuilt after its revolution (1910–20), Mexican films were much less popular than Hollywood’s with Mexican audiences. “The American-made film—of whatever quality,” film historian Aurelio de los Reyes has written, “had been . . . the favorite of the entire Mexican public” since the late 1910s.16 Hollywood overwhelmed Mexico’s nascent film industry, and by the late 1920s, Mexican film production had almost completely disappeared.17 Of the 244 films exhibited in Mexico City in 1930, for example, 196 (80.4 percent) were Hollywood films, and only four (1.6 percent) were Mexican.18 As we will see, Hollywood’s film aesthetic became the accepted standard in Mexico— and indeed throughout the world. Though the Mexican film industry made a Phoenixlike rebirth with sound film in the early 1930s and had matured into a formidable national cinema by the end of that decade, Mexico’s audiences had grown accustomed to the Hollywood way of telling stories. In the main, and to the chagrin of film aesthetes who had hoped that Mexico would develop its own national cinematic aesthetic, Mexican cinema adopted the Hollywood filmmaking paradigm. As described by David Bordwell in The Classical Hollywood Cinema, the definitive study of the American studio style from 1917 to 1960 that he coauthored with Janet Staiger and Kristin Thompson, this paradigm is a set of cinematic norms for the fiction film\n\nThe Classical Mexican Cinema\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nthat includes elements encompassed by three systems. First, the paradigm entails a system of narrative logic centered on cause-andeffect linkages of story events, a goal-oriented protagonist, and the adherence to Aristotelian narrative poetics. Second, it features a system of cinematic time that governs everything from shot duration to the temporal ordering of shots to favored story devices such as flashbacks and deadlines. Third, it involves a spatial system that constitutes filmic space as story space. Compositions privilege human bodies, centering and balancing them in the frame.19 The classical Hollywood filmmaking model, both as signifying practice and as industrial mode of production (including studio and star systems, powerful producers, well-developed distribution networks, and exhibition chains), was imitated in Mexico by the late 1930s as it embarked on what is now recognized as its cinematic Golden Age (el Cine de Oro), roughly from 1936 through 1957. Actually, most Mexican films adopted as well as adapted the Hollywood model, giving the Hollywood paradigm a decidedly Mexican inflection.20 By and large, as far as film style was concerned, the nation’s films adhered to the Hollywood model; however, there was a small but formidable filmmaking faction that rejected Hollywood’s paradigm outright. As a consequence, a central feature of Mexican cinema history in the first half of the twentieth century is the dynamic tension between those that followed the Hollywood style and those that spurned it. Accordingly, I have divided Mexico’s Golden Age cinema into two groups of films: the Mainstream Mexican Cinema (MMC) and the Classical Mexican Cinema (CMC). The\n\nR E T H EOR I Z I NG M E X ICAN F I L M H IS TORY\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 7\n\nmajority of the Golden Age movies came from the MMC, works that had clearly adopted the Hollywood style, if with a Mexican flavor. The CMC, on the other hand, was a smaller but influential group of alternative films, many of which got noticed at home and at international festivals and are now considered canonical classics of the nation’s cinema. These were films made by directors in search of a Mexican cinematic aesthetic, a distinctive film form to express lo mexicano (Mexicanness). Though a minority practice, they were not by any means all that esoteric or uncommon, but rather products of the same industry as the MMC. Indeed, one of the most fascinating aspects of the Cine de Oro is that the Classical Mexican Cinema contested the MMC while appearing alongside it. Mexican film culture was spacious enough to allow films such as Fernando de Fuentes’s Revolution Trilogy, the Fernández unit’s dramas and melodramas, Julio Bracho’s searing indictment of the postrevolutionary status quo, and Buñuel’s surrealist provocations to play in theaters one week and then be followed the next by conventional, largely genrebased MMC movies—comedies, melodramas, cabaretera films, or comedias rancheras. Moreover, these CMC deviations from the Mexican filmic norm also played beside the slew of Hollywood films being exhibited in Mexico at the time. These CMC films, then, offered a look at “another cinema,” one that—from de Fuentes’s El prisionero 13 (Prisoner 13) in 1933 to Buñuel’s last Mexican-made film, Simón del desierto (Simon of the Desert) in 1965—successfully established itself apart from the standard Hollywood, European, and Mexican films that commanded most of the screen time in the nation’s theaters.\n\n7\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nThis heterogeneous mix of MMC’s commercial films and CMC’s formal experimentation was much different from the homogeneous—well nigh monolithic—U.S. Hollywood filmmaking during the same era, where cases of formal experimentation were rare. As David Bordwell famously declared about the U.S. film industry’s output from 1917 to 1960: “In Hollywood cinema, there are no subversive films, only subversive moments. For social and economic reasons, no Hollywood film can provide a distinct and coherent alternative to the classical model.”21 My claim in this book is that for Mexico’s Golden Age cinema the situation was just the opposite. Major film artists were energetically exploring alternatives, consciously seeking a distinctive stylistic structure for Mexican movies. The films they produced deviated from the formal norm and expressed something different thematically, stylistically, and ideologically. In addition, these films were deliberate attempts to counter the Mainstream Mexican Cinema, which Classical Mexican Cinema directors regarded as undistinguished, uninspired, and highly derivative. The Mexican case is more similar to that in France, especially the films made there between the two world wars, when the film culture spectrum was expansive enough to include experiments on one end, mainstream commercial ventures on the other, and many intriguing blends of the two poles in between. By producing films that greatly broadened the range of Mexican cinema, CMC directors successfully countered Hollywood in two ways. They made films that broke away from the Hollywood paradigm, and in so doing they established a Mexican film culture very different from that of the United States.\n\n8\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 8\n\nThe MMC generally followed Hollywood’s lead in everything from its star system and producer-based industrial organization down to shooting, editing, and lighting styles, set design, costuming, and makeup, as well as scripting and acting conventions. Since MMC films adhered so closely to the classical Hollywood cinema, a style that has been thoroughly explicated by Bordwell, Thompson, and Staiger,22 I feel that a neoformalist examination of those movies would be redundant and unnecessary. What does need to be analyzed, however, is the poetics of the Classical Mexican Cinema. Though these films were a numerical minority, their impact on Mexican film history was at least equal to and arguably greater than the majority MMC. These vibrant and significant movies were exceptional, a term I use in my title in two senses. First, I mean to indicate those Mexican films that were deemed extraordinary by virtue of their garnering worldwide attention, critical acclaim, and awards both at home and at international festivals—films, that is, like Fernández’s María Candelaria (1943), which put Mexican cinema on the international moviemaking map, and like Buñuel’s Los olvidados (1950) and Él (1953), which kept it there. Second, I use “exceptional” to point out that in the context of Mexican Golden Age filmmaking the CMC films were the exceptions, not the run-of-the-mill industrial product. They intentionally did not look or feel like mainstream Mexican films, and proudly stood apart stylistically and ideologically. This meant that their domestic reception was often mixed. Some CMC films were critically and commercially successful at home and abroad, like Fernández’s first films\n\nThe Classical Mexican Cinema\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nwith Dolores del Río, Flor silvestre and María Candelaria (both 1943). Others failed at the box office and were shunned by local critics, only to be lauded overseas or rediscovered by a later generation, reevaluated, and eventually added to the canon of great Mexican films. This was the case with de Fuentes’s ¡Vámonos con Pancho Villa! (1936) as well as Buñuel’s Los olvidados (1950), two first-run failures that would rank #1 and #2 in a 1994 poll of Mexican filmmakers, critics, and historians conducted by Somos magazine.23 Just as some of the CMC films were immediately popular and others were not, some were genre films, and some were more difficult to categorize. But they were just as unmistakably Mexican as the MMC films (though we might have to exclude Buñuel’s literary adaptations, Robinson Crusoe [1954] and Abismos de pasión [Wuthering Heights, 1954]). Formally, however, they were definitely idiosyncratic—vigorously accentuating a distinctive cinematic style in order to assert mexicanidad (Mexicanness). The CMC was mostly the work of three auteurs: Fernando de Fuentes, Emilio Fernández’s filmmaking unit (comprised of Fernández, screenwriter Mauricio Magdaleno, cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa, and editor Gloria Schoemann), and, interestingly enough, the Spanish-born Luis Buñuel. Besides the works of these directors, in chapter 8 I’ll discuss three more exceptional films, directed by Bustillo Oro, Best Maugard, and Bracho. How were the CMC films, which are the focus of this book, different from the Mainstream Mexican Cinema? A short list of CMC characteristics will help explain the distinction I am making. As I work my way down the list,\n\nR E T H EOR I Z I NG M E X ICAN F I L M H IS TORY\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 9\n\nkeep in mind that it wasn’t so much that the elements present in CMC films were entirely absent in the MMC. Rather, it’s that all three of these features were regularly present in CMC films, and present to a greater degree than in their MMC counterparts, and that they were deliberately placed there by their directors. First, the CMC was self-consciously auteurist—carefully planned and executed by filmmakers with an explicit aesthetic and ideological agenda. It’s fair to say that most of the MMC films were quickly made entertainments produced to clear a profit. Similarly, many CMC films were made by frugal producers hoping to make money. But the difference was that CMC directors were thinking beyond their films’ commercial potential. They had something to say, wanted to say it in a special way, and wanted viewers to take notice. Fernando de Fuentes’s Revolution Trilogy was the director’s harshly critical commentary on the failure of the 1910–20 revolution. Unlike the majority of the happily resolved films of the MMC, de Fuentes’s trilogy was composed of tragedies that raised the chilling possibility that the disappointing and dispiriting outcome of the revolutionary war might have been due to an inherent flaw in the Mexican character. As de Fuentes said at the time of the release of El compadre Mendoza (1934), the second film of the trilogy: It would have been easy to narrate the plot [of El compadre Mendoza] in such a way that the conclusion was a happy one like we are used to seeing in American films; but it is our opinion that Mexican cinema ought to be a faithful reflection of our way of being, bleak and tragic, if what we are attempting is to present truthful\n\n9\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nprofiles of ourselves, rather than making a poor imitation of what we are given by Hollywood.24\n\nnoticed. As mentioned above and as will be discussed in chapter 5, de Fuentes intentionally gave all three films of the Revolution Trilogy tragic endings that he felt were truer Similarly, Emilio Fernández’s films that he to the Mexican experience. Consequently, the made with Gabriel Figueroa and the other dramatic structure of these films was emphatmembers of his filmmaking team were a ically unlike that of the MMC and resulted in direct attack on the MMC, which Fernández a different viewing experience for audiences. derided as hardly Mexican at all, and little Fernández and Figueroa were so staunchly more than Hollywood in Spanish.

Aligning itself with contemporaneous nationalistic movements in all the Mexican arts, the CMC aesthetic in effect asserted that its films had succeeded in capturing the authentic Mexico, while MMC moviemaking—for all its Mexican characters, colorful colloquialisms, familiar locales, popular songs, and folkloric costumes—had not. From the vantage point of CMC filmmakers, the MMC had failed because its films were imitative of—one could even say infected by—the dominant Hollywood filmmaking paradigm. After all, Hollywood’s was a foreign style, developed to depict American characters engaged in the American experience, and never meant to convey lo mexicano. This difference becomes strikingly evident in the analysis of the dramatic structure of CMC films, which reveals how many were tragedies that broke away from Hollywood’s and the MMC’s standard three-act, happy-ending formula. The CMC was more pro-Mexican than rabidly anti-American, however. For Mexico to flourish after the revolution, the thinking went, it needed to find its true identity. This was as true of national politics as it was of the arts. Consequently, Mexican cinema, as de Fuentes, Fernández, and Figueroa argued, must be part of that nationalistic identification effort. The subjects of my analyses, artist José Guadalupe Posada and filmmakers Enrique Rosas, Fernando de Fuentes, Emilio Fernández and Gabriel Figueroa, Juan Bustillo Oro, Adolfo Best Maugard, and Julio Bracho, were all involved in this nation-defining mission, either implicitly (Posada and Rosas) or explicitly (the others). Luis Buñuel, however, the focus of chapter 7, was a special case. Though\n\nR E T H EOR I Z I NG M E X ICAN F I L M H IS TORY\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 11\n\njust as subversive, oppositional, and antiestablishment as the rest—if not more so— he was not part of the nationalistic project. Rather, his ideological opposition stemmed from a lifelong commitment to surrealism, whose primary motivation was the dismantling of the bourgeois status quo. “The real purpose of surrealism,” Buñuel wrote, “was . . . to explode the social order, to transform life itself.”27 Still, Buñuel was allied with the other CMC filmmakers because in attacking the status quo, he challenged the MMC. Of course, every film carries ideological content, wittingly or not. What I want to suggest is that the Classical Mexican Cinema’s ideological program was explicit, whereas the politics of the MMC were typically implicit and unthinking. Moreover, the ideology embedded in the MMC’s narratives typically celebrated the Mexican status quo—not surprising, since it was conveyed via a filmic style that was adopted from Hollywood. From the Classical Mexican Cinema perspective, then, the Mainstream Mexican Cinema was hopelessly conservative and retrograde. In effect, the CMC was filmmaking that said, “We fought a revolution to blaze new artistic trails and create a new form of cinematic expression for Mexico, not to revert to the status quo ante and copy foreign filmmaking models.” The CMC point of view was that filmmakers who relied on conventional filmmaking imitative of the Hollywood paradigm were merely another sign of how thoroughly the revolution had failed. These, then, are the defining characteristics of the Classical Mexican Cinema, the films and filmmakers that I analyze in this book. Not every film the CMC auteurs made was\n\n11\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nmemorable, commercially or artistically successful, cinematically innovative, or ideologically confrontational. But many were, and focusing on the groundbreaking films from these filmmakers’ output reveals their individualistic styles, their aesthetic goals, and their ideological intentions. This book is dedicated to analyzing those films that exhibited these three characteristics, were aesthetically significant, and were cinematically exhilarating. The films, that is, that were artistically and ideologically special: the exceptional films of the Golden Age. Distinguishing between the MMC and Classical Mexican Cinema in this way means that I had to omit many popular and beloved Cine de Oro films—movies that are commonly accepted as part of Mexico’s cinematic canon, feature popular stars of the time, and appear on the Somos list of the best Mexican films of all time. In excluding these films, I’m\n\n12\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 12\n\nneither disregarding their importance nor questioning their stature in Mexican film history. And I’m certainly not denying the fact that they are immensely entertaining, important, and enjoyable. They are all those things, something that the appearance of so many of them on the Somos list confirms. They are absent here because stylistically they adhered to—rather than deviated from—dominant Mexican and Hollywood filmmaking norms of the time. My focus here is the Classical Mexican Cinema, a remarkable body of work made by filmmakers consciously striving to forge a native cinematic form, express lo mexicano, and avoid imitating Hollywood. This book is the story of how, against the odds, they succeeded in finding a Mexican way to say something memorable, meaningful, and true about the national experience.\n\nThe Classical Mexican Cinema\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nEvery Picture Tells a Story J O S E G UA DA L U P E P O S A DA’ S PROTO CI NEM AT IC GR A PH IC A RT\n\n/\n\nJ\n\nOSÉ GUADALUPE POSADA (1852–1913) is Mexico’s best known and most prolific turn-of-the-century engraver, an image-making genius who created thousands of penny press illustrations. Many of them, like his signature calaveras (skeleton figures), are still recognized today. But he never made a film, had little if any known association with filmmakers, and died twenty years before the appearance of the Classical Mexican Cinema in 1933. So why begin a book on Mexican cinema with a chapter on him? The reason is that Posada is essential to understanding the history of Mexican film. In both formal and ideological terms, Mexican cinema begins with Posada.\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 13\n\nFormally, Posada’s art is the fountainhead of visual narration in Mexico. He provided a pictorial model for depicting Mexican life that would be studied and adopted by the next generation of painters, graphic artists, muralists, and film directors, particularly Classical Mexican Cinema filmmakers. Thus it is crucial to appreciate the linkages between Mexico’s early cinema and the array of journalistic images available at the time, especially those created by Posada, who for more than forty years was the nation’s most productive mass media illustrator. During that time he discovered and developed representational techniques we would call “cinematic,” techniques that would be available for incorporation into modern Mexican cinema, which\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nfor me begins in 1919 with El automóvil gris (The Gray Automobile), the subject of my next chapter. The visual language he developed was similar to film’s, and encompassed shot selection, framing, composition, and the use of diagonal lines to accentuate depth. The second reason to begin with Posada is an ideological extension of the first and the one that most directly links him to the Classical Mexican Cinema. It is the fact that his art was regarded as the precursor of the nationalistic art movement, a crusade that drove Mexican art for the first half of the twentieth century. Posada’s inexhaustible production and propagation of Mexican imagery served as a seminal example for artists and muralists like Dr. Atl, Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and José Clemente Orozco. Not only did Posada’s art demonstrate that Mexico was a worthwhile subject, it also inspired them to reject hegemonic European artistic traditions and establish a native aesthetic. The work of these artists and their admiration for Posada’s body of work in turn had an effect on Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein while he was making !Que viva México! in 1931– 1932. Eisenstein’s appropriations of Posada motifs along with the muralists’ establishing a nationalistic aesthetic provided an aesthetic template for CMC filmmakers in their quest to create a distinctive and authentic national film style. A perfect example of why Posada’s work was so pivotal for artists, Eisenstein, and CMC filmmakers is shown in fig. 2.1, a striking illustration depicting the miraculous appearance of the Virgin of Guadalupe. The next generation of Mexican artists must have marveled at how economically, effortlessly, and effectively it proclaimed its mexicanidad.\n\n14\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 14\n\nBy combining the Virgin de Guadalupe, the nation’s spiritual patroness, and the ubiquitous maguey plant, Posada situated this event in only one place in the world—Mexico. As we will see, this was not lost on an artist like Orozco, a director like Eisenstein, and CMC filmmakers Emilio Fernández and Gabriel Figueroa, all of whom would make the maguey a prominent compositional feature in their work. And beyond its effective nationalism, much of Posada’s imagery penetrated beneath the surface of things and provided commentary on the Mexican status quo. Obvious examples are his calaveras’ playfully mocking Mexican high society. But there was a nononsense, journalistic side to Posada too, a tough-mindedness that informed his imagery as he chronicled the entire spectrum of Mexican life—good and bad, flattering and\n\nFIG. 2.1.

This ability to see Mexico without illusions gave a sting to his cultural critique, and that refusal to look away became a fundamental characteristic of the Classical Mexican Cinema. Though Posada’s combination of native subject matter and critical perspective deeply affected the style of the CMC, it did not have the same effect on the Mainstream Mexican Cinema. Because it adopted and adhered to the Hollywood filmmaking paradigm, stylistically the MMC would very likely have developed as it did with or without the existence of Posada. But it is impossible to imagine the existence of the Classical Mexican Cinema— in form or content—without Posada’s formidable example serving as a guiding star. I will use the formal/ideological rationale I have just laid out to structure this chapter. After a close analysis of Posada’s images to note their cinematic qualities, I will explore the similarities between his cultural criticism and the ideological stance characteristic of CMC films. But before doing that, let me briefly position Posada within Mexico’s turn-of-the-century journalistic world, just at the time when it was joined by a new image medium—el cine.\n\nengraving, printmaking) and the popular media (photographs and illustrations in newspapers, pictorial magazines, advertisements, slideshows, dime novels, posters, handbills, and broadsides). Of these, the penny press ruled. In the early 1900s, it was the most popular image medium in the country, and Posada was its master graphic artist. From the 1890s to the rise of newspapers and other mass media in the first part of the 1920s, the penny press was the most widespread, accessible source of images for the Mexican public. In Mexico City in the 1890s, for example, at least eighteen such presses were in operation, and from 1900 well into the 1910s, a period considered the heyday of the medium, there were more than forty.1 During this time, these presses massproduced countless one-sheet broadsides and small newspapers, with pressruns in the hundreds or thousands and sometimes in the millions.2 Agents, newsboys, and hawkers sold these for one or two centavos3 “on street corners, in market places, at fairs, ranches and haciendas.”4 In addition, these editorial houses printed a number of other image-containing items such as board games, cookbooks, songbooks, storybooks, and chapbooks. There has been a fair amount of research The Penny Press, Posada, and el cine into the reciprocal influences of image media in Turn-of-the-Century Mexico and the beginnings of First World moving pictures.5 But as of yet, no one has made more At the time that cinema was first becoming than a passing commentary on these medipopular, the rich mix of image-containing ated cross-fertilizations in Mexico’s early media available in Mexico was very differcinematic history.6 From this perspective, ent from that in the First World.

The prolific Posada was an illustrator for more than forty years, from the pre-cinematic era (he began illustrating in León in the 1870s and moved to Mexico City around 1887) until well into Mexico’s initial documentary film stage (roughly 1896–1916). Moreover, his etchings and engravings encompassed an impressively broad range of subjects, from religious portraits to carefully drafted views of Mexico City to depictions of news events, satirical calavera drawings, and miracles. Posada documented Mexican life, legend, and folklore by creating thousands of images (most estimates have put the total at between fifteen and twenty thousand, though the actual number will never be known)7 in various media: woodcuts, type-metal engravings, and zinc relief etchings.8 These were published in popular Mexican journalistic forms—broadsides and chapbooks—that “had virtually disappeared in Europe and the United States.”9 When moving pictures arrived, the new medium established a built-in kinship with journalism. From 1896, when the Lumières’ and Edison’s representatives introduced moving pictures to the nation, until 1917, when Mexican filmmaking turned away from documentaries and embraced fiction films, the national cinema was predominantly documentary. The new medium was considered a branch of journalism and generally understood as a moving variant of illustrated magazines, which were gaining popularity in Mexico in the 1890s. Though at first these periodicals were exclusively foreign, Mexico’s own production of such magazines began in 1895 with the publication of El mundo ilustrado, which combined engravings, lithographs, and photographs.10 In those early\n\n16\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 16\n\ndecades of cinema, then, Posada and Mexican filmmakers saw themselves—and were seen by others—as essentially in the same business: reportage. Twenty years later that same impulse was one of the main characteristics of CMC filmmaking. Like Posada, CMC directors were using a mass communication image medium to depict the national experience and report on problems in the system. Mexican Cinema’s Documentary Stage (1896–1917) One distinguishing feature of Mexican cinema is the fact that for its first twenty years, from 1896 until 1916, Mexican film production was almost exclusively a documentary practice. In contrast, both European and North American cinemas gravitated toward narrative much earlier: U.S. films, for example, made the transition during the 1903–1907 period.11 And during the 1910s, a time when foreign films—mainly French, Italian, and North American—commanded more and more attention from filmgoers in Mexico, the onset of the Mexican Revolution (1910–20) provided an impetus for domestic documentary production to continue, as newsreel footage brought events of the civil war to life for the nation’s moviegoers. But the rush to capture current events was not the only reason that Mexican cinema remained almost entirely documentary, despite the unrelenting trend toward narrative films in First World cinema. First of all, Mexican documentaries were enormously popular. Second, they provided native filmmakers with a ready-made market niche. Third, documentaries were cheap to make and economical to market—entrepreneurs like\n\nThe Classical Mexican Cinema\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nEnrique Rosas and Salvador Toscano shot, edited, promoted, and exhibited their films in their own theaters.12 Fourth, they fed the desire of Mexicans to see themselves on the silver screen.13 Fifth, from the 1870s on, Mexico— through its intellectual and political leadership—was under the sway of positivism. As promoted by Gabino Barreda, who transplanted the French philosophical movement to Mexico, positivism was touted as a means of moving Mexico from anarchy to liberty. This belief was based on two assumptions: first, that economic evolution preceded political evolution (and ultimately liberty), and second, that the proper means of achieving economic evolution was through order. Order, organization, a scientific approach to the nation’s problems, and education of the masses were the cornerstones of Mexican positivism.14 “In that context,” writes film historian Aurelio de los Reyes, “fiction cinema was rejected because of its potential to dupe the public: the cinema was a science and as such should show truths.”15 Finally, a nationalistic side effect of positivism led artists in the last decades of the nineteenth century toward a celebration of lo mexicano and away from the imitation of foreign traditions. As part of this movement, the representational arts, from paintings to illustrations to photographs, were called upon to depict Mexico, its people, and its culture.16 To the degree that cinema in Mexico was regarded as a science as well as an art (early comparisons likened it to etchings, painting, and theater),17 it was clear that it should promote nationalism, like the other representational arts. Mexico’s twenty-year\n\ndocumentary-film stage, therefore, was not simply a case of arrested development, but rather the result of the convergence of complex technological, political, economic, philosophical, and nationalistic factors. The decline of the Mexican documentary came in 1915, when interest in nonfiction films waned significantly. By 1916, revolutionary documentaries—along with domestic documentaries in general—had all but disappeared from Mexican movie screens.18 Shortly thereafter, in 1917, a small band of enterprising Mexican filmmakers initiated Mexico’s first sustained fiction-film stage by producing story films. While there had been sporadic attempts at el filme de argumento (scripted fiction films) before, there had never been a sustained effort of the kind that began in that year. Only a fragmentary record of this early wave of narrative films survives, but it seems that they took two forms, one derivative and the other nationalistic. Among the first were imitations of Italian melodramas, which were very popular in Mexico at the time. For example, Mexico’s first narrative feature, La luz (The Light, 1917), was a faithful reconstruction of the Italian film Il fouco (1915), which had enjoyed enormous success in Mexico in 1916. The five films starring the Mexican stage actress Mimí Derba and produced by documentarian Enrique Rosas in 1917 were also clearly under the spell of Italian melodramas. A second group of “truly nationalistic” films was also produced; these were movies that would exhibit the landscape, folkways, and customs of Mexico (such as the first film version of Federico Gamboa’s popular 1904 Mexican novel Santa in 1918).19\n\nJ O S É G U A D A L U P E P O S A D A’ S P R O T O C I N E M AT I C G R A P H I C A R T\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 17\n\n17\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nThis brief experimental-fiction stage culminated in the national cinema’s first legitimate narrative blockbuster, the 1919 docudrama El automóvil gris. As I will discuss in more detail in the next chapter, the film was originally released as a twelve-part serial, and only survives as a partial version. Nevertheless, it is so accomplished cinematically that it can be said to be the bellwether of the Golden Age, an important precedent for both the CMC and the MMC.\n\nand foreign fiction and nonfiction movies, all provided a foundation from which Mexican filmmakers must have learned to transmit comprehensible, coherent narratives. Before I begin my analysis, a word on the use of the term “narrative” in relation to Posada. I use “narrative” in the Bordwellian sense, as “the activity of selecting, arranging, and rendering story material in order to achieve specific time-bound effects on a perceiver.”21 And although useful in categorizing the two general types of emerging early film, Narrational Representation in I deemphasize the nonfiction/fiction diTurn-of-the-Century Mexico chotomy when speaking of Posada’s imagery because, by Bordwell’s broad definition, all of In the discussion that follows, I am not look- his illustrations were narrations: that is, each ing for causal links between penny press drawing required him to select, arrange, and illustrations and cinema.

In the analysis that follows, I am omitting these two illustrations because I am not interested in Posada’s abilities as a copyist, which is what he appears to have done in these two engravings. Rather, I am focusing on the way Posada imagined and visualized scenes for events he was called on to narrate—not ones he copied from other sources—and the way his resulting images anticipated film language. Posada’s Cinematic Techniques Surveying the work of Posada, one notes several cinematic techniques that would become part of what is now called “film language.” By “cinematic” I mean characteristics unique to moving pictures, techniques that could not be duplicated by other media, that were not common practice in other media at the\n\ntime, or that would be extremely difficult to achieve in other media. For example, when watching a play on a stage, a spectator is presented with the entire proscenium view. Cinema is able to capture that in a long shot (LS), and in fact much of early cinema framed the action from such a front-row-center proscenium vantage point. Later, however, cinema began to enter the narrative space to record closer shots via the medium shot (MS) and the close-up (CU). Providing more detailed information with these shots is something cinema can do that stage drama cannot and is one example of a cinematic feature of the medium. Others include cinema’s capturing of serial motion through still photographs, the manipulation of time and space via editing, various moving camera shots (pans, tilts, and tracks), and dissolves and fades between one scene and the next.\n\nLEFT | FIG. 2.2.

They became prevalent with the advent of analytical editing, one of the hallmarks of Hollywood’s and the greater Western cinema’s classical style. It involves breaking down the action of a scene into separate shots: LSs to establish the setting, MSs to place the subject within the context of his or her immediate environment, and CUs to provide a significant detail of the subject or action. Early on in Western cinema history, films were made up almost exclusively of frontal, proscenium-like, full-figure LSs or medium\n\n20\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 20\n\nlong shots, and it was not until the mid-1910s that films began using a wider array of shots with any regularity. However, it appears that Posada created medium and close-up images of subjects frequently before they became standard cinematic practice. Posada’s Gran Fandango y Francachela de Todas las Calaveras (Happy Dance and Wild Party of the Skeletons, no date), shown in fig. 2.4, gives an example of the frontal, proscenium style common to both illustrations and early cinema. The image is self-contained in that the entire scene is depicted, and the diegetic world—as well as the narrative—ends at the image edge. Contrast this image with those in figs. 2.5 and 2.6, two of thirteen images from the front and back pages of a two-sided FIG. 2.4.

(Courtesy the Nettie Lee Benson Latin American Collection, University of Texas at Austin)\n\nbroadside, Una calavera chusca (A Funny Calavera, no date), in which Posada and his corrido (ballad) lyricist poked fun at local market vendors. While some of the calavera characters are drawn in full figure, many are drawn in “medium shot.” Of course portraits were a common artistic genre, and Posada produced many in his time. But these pictorial MSs are not so much posed, formal portraits as they are shots of active individuals caught in the middle of a working day—almost snapshots. As such they have a documentary immediacy, and despite being calavera figures, they possess recognizable human characteristics. These MSs approach the cinematic by providing closer details of the vendors that identify them not only by the foods they sell but also by costume and utensil (the fish, striped skirt, and apron-vest of Aurelia the fish vendor [fig. 2.5]; the large knife of Doña Antonia the butcher [fig. 2.6]). This sort of indication of individual traits was something that evolved in Hollywood and Western cinema throughout the 1910s and was standardized by around 1917. One of Posada’s best-known engravings is the close-up calavera of the fashionable lady, La catrina (fig. 2.7). This, we could say, is a portrait, not of a particular person, but of a class of women. Posada’s commentary—death overtaking wealth—is much more forceful in this near view, which allows the viewer to see how she clings to the pretensions of her upper-class standing, even beyond the grave: plumes and flowers decorate her fancy hat and ribbons adorn her bony, hairless skull. A fascinating example of another Posada “medium shot” is a cinema-style two-shot in a skeleton composition (fig. 2.8) included in the Corrido aquí la calavera está, señores, de\n\nJ O S É G U A D A L U P E P O S A D A’ S P R O T O C I N E M AT I C G R A P H I C A R T\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 21\n\n21\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nTOP | FIG. 2.7.

Interestingly, these figures can be found as separate subjects in other broadsides (for example, Calavera de cupido, 1913). Someone—Posada, Vanegas Arroyo, or the person composing the later page—realized that the two-shot image could be manipulated and re-purposed as individual CUs, prefiguring cinematic shot selection (over-the-shoulder shots) and editing (cutting from a MS twoshot to individual CUs).24 Another Posada MS is of the strange case of a man who was said to have a foot protruding from his side (fig. 2.9, not dated or otherwise identified). Obviously the nearer vantage point is called for in order to provide important details of the freak occurrence and to satisfy viewer curiosity.\n\nThe Classical Mexican Cinema\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nOFF-SCR EEN SPACE: FR A MING TO IMPLY A STORY WOR LD EXISTING BEYOND THE COMPOSITION One additional feature of medium and closeup images is that their partial views insinuate a diegetic world beyond the “frame.” In the shot from Alegoría de revolucionarios (Allegory of the Revolutionaries, no date) shown in fig. 2.10, we see the crouched, full body of one soldier, but only three-quarters of the wounded man he is protecting. The compact composition’s limited information, together with the gaze of the soldier toward the upper right part of the composition, imply the existence of what in cinema is called “off-screen space.” Another characteristic of the maturing cinematic style, the acknowledgment of and reference to off-screen space goes hand in hand with advancements in editing. Were this an image from a Golden Age film, we would expect it to be part of a scene whose progression of shots would typically begin with a LS (establishing the location), then this image, then probably glance-object cutting\n\n(the next shot might well be of the person or object holding the soldier’s gaze). In addition to editing, another cinematic option from this shot would be camera movement (a pan, tilt, or tracking shot) that would also provide important information and thus be well motivated. ENTER ING THE NAR R ATIVE SPACE From 1909 and throughout the 1910s, in both Hollywood cinema and, as we will see, in Rosas’s El automóvil gris, cameras were sometimes positioned closer to the subject in order to feature details of a scene. The camera’s entry into the space of the narrative is another clearly cinematic trait. A good example of Posada doing the same thing is shown in fig. 2.11, an undated, unnamed image of women who have gathered to observe conjoined twins. Viewers are placed at a very near vantage point, one that has clearly placed them inside the narrative space, perhaps even closer to the twins than the women.\n\nLEFT | FIG. 2.9.

(Courtesy the Nettie Lee Benson Latin American Collection, University of Texas at Austin)\n\nANGLED COMPOSITIONS TO ACCENTUATE DEPTH Two typical characteristics of early cinema compositions were their frontal, front-rowcenter perspective and their shallow depth, both of which drew considerably from stage conventions. By shooting actions at an angle, filmmakers began emphasizing depth, something the camera could capture but that was severely limited on the stage. While Posada, in figs. 2.4 and 2.20, for example, did sometimes rely on this head-on proscenium style, he often broke with it to compose the action on an angle, using strong diagonal lines to\n\n24\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 24\n\nadd depth. The broadside image in fig. 2.12, Los patinadores (The Street Cleaners, 1890), presents the action at an angle along a receding diagonal as films would gradually begin doing, particularly in the first decade of the new century. In those early films—Edwin S. Porter’s The Great Train Robbery (1903) is a good example—a pattern of shooting was adhered to by which interior shots maintained the frontal, flattened, proscenium perspective while exteriors were angled. Interestingly, although Posada began angling on action much earlier than cinema, as with Los patinadores, or with fig. 2.13, ¡Terribles y espantosísimos estragos! Habidos por la suma escasez de semillas y el terrible TIFO . . . (Terrible and Frightful Ravages Caused by a Grain Shortage and the Terrible Typhus . . . , 1893), he appears to have followed the same proscenium interior/angled exterior representational practice. MULTIPLE IM AGES TO PROVIDE SHIFTS IN TIME AND SPACE In narrativizing events, Posada sometimes found that one image was not sufficient to relate the tale he had to tell. This is the case with fig. 2.14, from a broadside with the headline Tristísimas lamentaciones de un enganchado para el Valle Nacional (Very Sad Lamentations of a Contracted Laborer at National Valley, 1903). The broadside is an exposé of the oppression of humble Mexicans kidnapped or hired under false pretenses to work in the plantations of the Valle Nacional region, a common practice during the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz. In a LS on the left, Posada illustrates a survivor relating his cautionary tale to a crowd of astonished listeners. Then, in an extreme LS enclosed in an oval bubble, he depicts the laborers working the\n\nThe Classical Mexican Cinema\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nfields. The broadside image provides views not only of two different locations, but also possibly of different times. (Is the balloon showing what occurred in the past? What is still occurring? Or warning his audience what may befall them in the future if they are not careful?) A similar example is found in fig. 2.15, Un sentenciado en capilla (A Prisoner in Solitary Confinement, no date). Here there is more ambiguity (which the accompanying text, now\n\nunavailable, may have clarified). It is not clear in the leap in space and time from the main illustration to the bubble image whether the execution is that of the prisoner or the man’s imagining of it. Similar problems in transmitting plot information existed in cinema as primitive narrational systems struggled with standardizing conventions (like thought and dream balloons) and ways to denote a character’s thoughts as distinct from simultaneous or subsequent actions.\n\nFIG. 2.13. ¡Terribles y espantosísimos estragos!

The three images in figs. 2.16 to 2.18, for example, all appeared on a two-sided broadside entitled Gran chasco que se pegó Don Chepito Mariguana: Por andar en amores con una mujer casada (The Great Joke Played on Don Chepito Mariguana: Because He Pursued a Married Woman, no date). The comical corrido, featuring one of Posada’s recurring characters, Don Chepito, tells of his ill-fated attempts to woo a married woman. Don Chepito first flirts with her on the street (fig. 2.16), then is knocked down by the woman’s husband (fig. 2.17), and is finally arrested (fig. 2.18). Of interest here is first of all Posada’s rendering of sequenced events, which required him to isolate and dramatize the key incidents of the story. But beyond that is the fact that in the broadside they appeared in a different order, beginning in medias res on the front side with the image in fig. 2.17, then continuing on the back with fig. 2.16, the start of the tale, and fig. 2.18, the end of it. This order in effect creates a flashback from the middle of the narrative, then a flash-forward to its conclusion, and anticipates complex movie narratives that later would be common in cinema.

Don Chepito taken to jail.\n\n26\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 26\n\nThe Classical Mexican Cinema\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nA variation of Posada’s representation of sequenced events is an illustration in which he collected four different actions in successive panels, as in a comic strip. Fig. 2.19, De nuestros dibujantes, momentos antes de los acontecimientos (From Our Artists, Moments before the Event, 1903), showing the attempted theft of a clock, is an illustration Posada did for a small penny periodical called El diablito bromista.25 In the first panel, a garbage collector empties a customer’s household waste. In the second, he presents the bill inside to the lady of the house. When she leaves the room to get the money (panel three), he tries to steal the clock, but just then it chimes and he is caught and attacked (fourth panel).26\n\nFR A MING WITH PARTIALLY SHOW N FIGUR ES IN THE FOR EGROUND Posada’s crowd scenes generally have one interesting detail in common: they have foreground figures that are cut off by the bottom edge of the composition. For example, though one of Posada’s courtroom drawings, fig. 2.20, Jurado (Trial, no date), has the typical frontality of many of his interior drawings, it varies from the proscenium style in the way the soldiers and onlookers at the bottom of the drawing are cut off above or at the waist (even the two witnesses or defendants, seen at the center bottom, are cut off at the ankles).\n\nFIG. 2.19. De nuestros dibujantes, momentos antes de los acontecimientos (From Our Artists, Moments before the Event, 1903).

They give viewers a privileged view they could only have if they were so close to the scene that they couldn’t see the entire bodies of the nearer people: that is, it positions them either within or very near to the narrative space and gives the picture documentary immediacy. In addition, the foreground figures frame the action occurring in the middle and background, thus accentuating depth in the frame and\n\ntaking viewers’ eyes from fore- to mid- to background. Moreover, they are composed in depth, a key characteristic of both Hollywood’s and Mexico’s Golden Age cinema, beginning, as we will see in the next chapter, with El automóvil gris. As a quick point of reference, I include a shot from the trial of the bandits at the end of El automóvil gris (fig. 2.21), a still that exhibits the same pictorial qualities as the Posada print. Posada’s Bequest to the Classical Mexican Cinema\n\nTOP | FIG. 2.20. Jurado (Trial, no date).

The trial of the robbers at the end of the film has a very similar composition to that shown in fig. 2.20.\n\n28\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 28\n\nIn general, and at least indirectly, all Cine de Oro filmmakers owed a debt to Posada. Like him, they worked in a popular, not elitist, visual medium. They were commercial artists and their job, like his, was to create images that related stories to viewers clearly, concisely, and unambiguously. But as I mentioned at the start of this chapter, Posada’s influence on Classic Mexican Cinema filmmakers, though posthumous, was much more direct and explicit. He had practiced what they sought: a way to produce work that was thoroughly Mexican in both form and content. He left behind a clear-eyed record of the entire spectrum of the turn-of-the-century Mexican experience—good, bad, and ugly. At its best, his was a tough-minded art that refused to look away. Delving into the core of Mexican life, he bore witness to all that he found. For all these reasons, when CMC moviemakers were pursuing a national film aesthetic a generation after his death, Posada was their touchstone. Let me give some examples to draw out the sort of influence Posada had on the Classical Mexican Cinema. Although many of his\n\nThe Classical Mexican Cinema\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nillustrations dealt with lurid crimes—after all, robberies, suicides, kidnappings, and murders were the penny presses’ stock-in-trade27— occasionally more mundane wrongs were featured. And in the depiction of little-noted, everyday injustices, Posada’s social critique could be scathing. For example, there is this unsettling domestic scene of a drunken man, presumably the household’s husband and father, raging on as his son cowers beneath him and his wife prays to the Virgin of Guadalupe (fig. 2.22). Compare that image with fig. 2.23, a scene of domestic abuse from Luis Buñuel’s La hija del engaño (Daughter of Deceit, 1951). The similarity between the two images, right down to the men’s unhinged behavior and the Virgin of Guadalupe on the walls, is striking. But despite such neat parallels, I’m not making the argument that Posada’s influence on CMC filmmakers was a matter of their imitating specific details from his engravings in their films. The point I want to make is that the key link between Posada and the CMC is their shared critique of Mexican machismo. Both images decry Mexican patriarchy’s tolerating the sort of physical, psychological, and emotional abuse depicted here. That my example comes from a Luis Buñuel film is significant, since the inanity of machismo was one of his favorite targets. (I’ll have more to say about La hija del engaño in chapter 7.) Or compare the two images in figs. 2.24 and 2.25. The first is one of many Posada engravings depicting firing squad executions, most of them capturing the moment of death. This one, however, focuses on a painful scene just before the execution, when the prisoner’s disconsolate family holds on to their father and husband. Fig. 2.25 is from the tragic\n\nTOP | FIG. 2.22. Woman Praying to the Virgin of Guadalupe as Her Husband Rages Madly.

The main male character, José Luis (Pedro Armendáriz), is about to be executed by order of a bandit leader. It is interrupted when his wife (Dolores del Río), carrying their baby boy in her arms, rushes to his side.

She must be forcibly torn from his side before the execution can proceed.\n\n30\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 30\n\nOnce again there is a compositional affinity between the two depictions, which in this case was neither indirect nor coincidental, but explicit. According to the film’s cinematographer, Gabriel Figueroa, this execution scene was directly “inspired by José Guadalupe Posada” (though he doesn’t refer to any specific engraving).28 And once again, I want to emphasize their shared critical perspective. Both explore the uncomfortable spectacle of death to reveal the pain involved in any killing; this is especially true for Fernández, who extends the scene considerably. With such a protracted, graphic treatment of the execution, Fernández was using the form and feeling of a familiar Posada motif to express one of the great themes of CMC films—the consequences of the revolution’s brutality on succeeding generations. Furthermore, both instances raise what became a major question for the CMC: To what degree does such savagery define the Mexican character?\n\nThe Classical Mexican Cinema\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nI will continue the story of the emergence of the CMC in the next chapter by discussing how Mexican film went from its twentyyear-long documentary stage to the creation of its first masterpiece, a fictionalized version of a real-life crime spree entitled El automóvil gris (1919). I will analyze director Enrique Rosas’s style and argue that it was a complex synthesis of five different influences: four\n\nnational cinemas (Mexico’s documentaries plus Hollywood, Italian, and French fiction films) along with the penny press graphic arts tradition of Posada. As I make my case, I will show that the development of Mexican cinema in general and the Classical Mexican Cinema in particular involved a mix of imitation, innovation, and inspiration.\n\nJ O S É G U A D A L U P E P O S A D A’ S P R O T O C I N E M AT I C G R A P H I C A R T\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 31\n\n31\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 32\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nEnrique Rosas’s El automovil gris (1919) and the Dawning of Modern Mexican Cinema /\n\nE\n\nL AUTOMÓVIL GRIS (The Gray Automobile, 1919; produced by Enrique Rosas [1877–1920], directed by Rosas, Joaquín Coss, and Juan Canals de Homs) is one of the few surviving examples of Mexican silent narrative film, and has been called “the most famous [Mexican] movie of the period.”1 Originally released as a twelve-episode serial with an estimated running length of between three and four hours, it was based on a notorious series of robberies that occurred in Mexico City in 1915. These crimes were unusual because of the robbers’ distinctive modus operandi. Taking advantage of the chaos brought on by the Mexican Revolution, the thieves disguised themselves as soldiers and displayed signed search warrants to gain\n\nentry to the houses of some of the wealthiest families in Mexico City. They terrorized the inhabitants, robbed them, and made their escape in a gray Fiat.2 Though it is the first Mexican docudrama, El automóvil gris’s re-creation of actual events is impressive. It was based on two sources: newspaper accounts of the affair by Miguel Nicoechea, a reporter who covered the crimes; and case notes taken by Juan Manuel Cabrera, the assistant chief of police for the military’s Special Services, who was in charge of the investigation and was said to have made most of the arrests in the case.3 Nicoechea and Cabrera coscripted the film with Rosas, and Cabrera played himself in the film. Furthermore, according to the film’s prologue, it was shot in the locations where the events had\n\nFACING: Detail of figure 3.1.\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 33\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\noccurred.4 Finally—and most dramatically— rather than staging the climactic execution of six of the bandits, Rosas, who oversaw the editing, inserted documentary footage of the actual firing squad execution, which he himself had photographed in 1915.5 This canny combination of authenticity and sensationalism appealed to audiences, contributing to the film’s enormous popularity. When it was released in December 1919, it broke all of Mexico’s established box office records, including those for most theaters to exhibit the same film on one day (19), most single-day admissions (40,233), and biggest opening day outside of Mexico City (4,012 pesos, in Veracruz).6 After the coming of sound, the serial was re-edited twice, in 1933 and 1937. Dialogue, music, and sound effects were added, and it was condensed to feature length (reportedly 111 minutes, though the DVD of the film, issued by the National University of Mexico [UNAM], runs 105 minutes). This renewed its popularity, extended its exhibition life, and made it one of the longest-running, mostviewed films in Mexican cinema history.7 In the process, however, this reconstruction completely destroyed the original. In order to conform to emergent two-hour featurelength norms, Rosas’s heirs deleted scenes, characters, plot threads, and the entire last episode. What remains for today’s viewers can be confusing, especially if they are not familiar with the events depicted.8 And as far as is known, the excised elements from the serial version are gone, making the reconstruction of the original impossible. But even given all the problems with the film that survives, it remains a seminal text in which a number of formative cinematic\n\n34\n\nBerg_5146_BK.indd 34\n\ncurrents converge, making it crucial to the understanding of the development of Mexican cinema. To begin with, because of its subject matter, it conveniently satisfied the nationalistic urge emerging in Mexican arts at the time. Moreover, El automóvil gris contains an early expression of twin themes— the corruption of revolutionary ideals and the accompanying remorse over the loss of the unique opportunity the revolution afforded—that would haunt the nation’s cinema for the next seven decades.9 Additionally, the symbiotic relationship between political leaders and the film’s producer set a precedent for state involvement in motion picture production that characterizes Mexican filmmaking to this day.10 Furthermore, El automóvil gris holds a unique place in Mexican film history as the crucial link between Mexico’s turn-of-thecentury image making—Posada’s illustrations and the early documentaries—and the Golden Age cinema that arose in the 1930s. At the same time, Rosas was borrowing from other national cinematic traditions. Formally, then, El automóvil gris resulted from the blending of these five influences: 1. the visual storytelling system established by Posada’s penny press illustrations; 2. Mexico’s rich documentary tradition, which thrived for the first twenty years of the nation’s film history by feeding its audience’s appetite for images of Mexican current events; 3. Italian cinema, known for its melodramas, attention to period detail, and mobile camera; 4. French cinema, especially, in the case of El automóvil gris, the crime serials of\n\nThe Classical Mexican Cinema\n\n6/4/15 9:48 AM\n\nGeorges Feuillade (such as Fantômas [1913–1914], Les vampires [1915–1916], Judex [1916], and La nouvelle mission de Judex [1917]), with their extensive use of location shooting and fast-paced cops-and-robbers narratives; and 5. the emerging Hollywood paradigm, with its goal-driven protagonist, causally linked narrative, and evolving rules of editing, lighting, and shooting based on character psychology.\n\nThe merging of these disparate influences made it possible for Mexico’s narrative film to keep pace with European and American filmmaking in the 1910s, despite Mexican cinema’s near-exclusive concentration on documentary production. Instead of finding itself hopelessly behind other national cinemas in the world, Mexican filmmaking— spurred by talented filmmakers like Rosas— proved nimble and inventive enough to catch up by 1919, and seemed poised to enter a silent golden age. One of my goals here is to detail the complex story of the evolution of Mexican film from its inception to the Golden Age. This is necessary because at first glance it may appear that, stylistically at least, Mexico’s Cine de Oro arose by simply imitating U.S. film and becoming a Spanish version of Hollywood. It’s true that after the coming of sound many Golden Age films (the Mainstream Mexican Cinema) were formally identical to U.S. movies. However, as this chapter will show, the way that Mexican films arrived at that style was complicated—combining, as I’ve said, influences from five sources, only one of which was Hollywood. In the time between the release of El automóvil gris in 1919\n\nand the first flowering of the Golden Age more than a decade later, four of those five vanished, leaving the Hollywood paradigm as the best—and only—remaining option. I will discuss how this came to pass at the end of this chapter, after undertaking a formal analysis of El automóvil gris. But first we must familiarize ourselves with the beginnings of movies in Mexico, with the infamous “gray car” crimes themselves, and with the production of the film. Mexican Film Culture, 1896–1917 Owing to a distinct set of factors, Mexico’s cinema development was unique. As I mentioned in chapter 2, one key difference was that until 1916, Mexican films were almost exclusively documentaries. Representatives of the Lumière brothers shot and exhibited their actualités (brief documentaries) in Mexico in 1896, and when Mexican film entrepreneurs like Salvador Toscano Barragán and"
