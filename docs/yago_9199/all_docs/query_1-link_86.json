        "text": "MOVIES have never been more self-conscious about their history. If one had to choose a defining phrase for the mood of world cinema today, \"esthetic self-awareness\" might be the most pertinent. And this sense of an art refreshing itself by rummaging through its past runs through many of the 26 programs in the New York Film Festival, which opens tonight at Lincoln Center with Agnieszka Holland's psychological drama \"Olivier, Olivier.\"\n\nIn its 30th season, the festival is presenting films from 18 countries, including Iran, which is represented (for the first time) by Abbas Kiarostami's \"And Life Goes On.\" A look at the devastating effects of an earthquake, the film will be shown tomorrow and Sunday.\n\nIn a festival that for three decades has evoked the international cinematic mood, this year political and sexual issues have taken a back seat to more esthetic concerns. An unusual number of the films being shown are adaptations of literary works. One of the most ambitious examples is the Indian film maker Mani Kaul's three-hour adaptation of the Dostoyevsky novel \"The Idiot,\" which will be shown on Oct. 8.\n\nAlong with the spirit of post-modernism, in which styles and genres from the past are mixed, matched and scrambled, runs a powerful strain of rebellion against commercial formula. Just when you think you have gotten a handle on a particular film's story, it is likely to take a sharp left turn.\n\n\"There is increasingly a sense that when people go to the movies they are going for an expected product,\" said Richard Pena, the director of programming for the festival, which is presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center. \"One of the things I like about this year's festival is that you don't know exactly how things are going to turn out.\"\n\n\"The directors are not compromising,\" agreed Wendy Keys, his associate at the Film Society. \"They're not modifying their storytelling to suit the audience.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
