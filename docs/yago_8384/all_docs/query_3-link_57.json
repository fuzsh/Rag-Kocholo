        "text": "History\n\nThe Gorilla Foundation was founded in 1976, based on the results of a unique interspecies communication study with gorillas began in 1972, by founder Dr. Francine Penny Patterson:\n\nProject Koko has evolved into much more than just an “ape language” project! As we began to learn how much like us gorillas are emotionally and cognitively, we also learned how gorillas (and other great apes) in Africa were becoming critically endangered and hence our focus has shifted from pure research to applied research for the benefit of both captive and free-living gorillas (and other great apes).\n\nMilestones\n\n1971\n\nKoko is born on July 4 at the San Francisco Zoo. The name Hanabi-Ko, meaning “Fireworks Child” in Japanese, is selected as the winner of the “name the baby gorilla” contest\n\n1972\n\n“Project Koko” begins. Francine (Penny) Patterson, a Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University, begins working with Koko at the San Francisco Zoo, initiating the first-ever project to study the linguistic capabilities of the gorillas.\n\n1973\n\n“Project Koko” moves from the San Francisco Children’s’ Zoo to its very own trailer (still in use today) on zoo grounds.\n\n1974\n\nKoko relocates from the San Francisco Zoo to a compound located on the Stanford University campus, paving the way for an expansion of Penny and Koko’s pioneering collaboration.\n\n1976\n\nDr. Patterson, Dr. Ronald H. Cohn and the late Barbara F. Hiller establish The Gorilla Foundation. Through the efforts of the Foundation, Penny and Ron obtain custody of Koko in 1977, ensuring that their fruitful partnership can continue.\n\nMichael, a bushmeat orphan from Cameroon, is given a home by the Gorilla Foundation. A welcome companion and possible future mate for Koko, Michael also receives sign language instruction and expands the scope of the Foundation’s language and behavioral studies.\n\nIn recognition of the pioneering work being done by Koko and Penny, National Geographic Society awards a grant to Dr. Patterson for the study of linguistic behavior and higher cognitive functioning in the gorilla.\n\n1977\n\n“The Pursuit of Reason”—a landmark article on interspecies communication and animal rights by Harold T. Hayes, featuring the work of The Gorilla Foundation—is published in the New York Times Magazine, bringing international attention to Koko and Penny’s groundbreaking studies.\n\nDian Fossey, renowned mountain gorilla researcher, visits Koko, who is impressed with Dian’s demonstration of gorilla vocalizations.\n\n1978\n\nDr. Patterson becomes the first woman to receive the Rolex Award for Enterprise honoring her studies of communication and higher cognitive functioning in the gorilla.\n\n“Conversations with a Gorilla” is published in National Geographic (154, (4)).\n\nDr. Jane Goodall visits The Gorilla Foundation to share information concerning the\n\ngreat apes. After returning to Africa, Dr. Goodall writes asking if Koko can provide her with some information to help with her research on wild chimpanzees – surely a first in primate research.\n\nKoko, a Talking Gorilla (a 90-minute documentary film) is produced by Barbet Schroeder and shown at the Cannes Film Festival. Chronicling the seminal years of Project Koko, the film furthers international understanding of the true nature of gorillas.\n\n1979\n\nThe Gorilla Foundation moves from Stanford to the forested highlands of Woodside, California, in order to provide a more protected environment for Koko and Michael.\n\nMorley Safer features Koko on 60 Minutes.\n\n1980\n\nGorilla Foundation Advisory Board is formed. Members include Jane Goodall and Melvin M. Payne.\n\nThe documentary Gorilla (which features the work of The Gorilla Foundation) is released by National Geographic and aired on public television stations nationwide. It eventually is made part of The Best of the National Geographic series.\n\n1981\n\nWork is completed on the gorillas’ 250-square-foot indoor facility addition and 676-square-foot outdoor play yard, providing greater opportunities for gorillas to interact, and to experience many new enrichment activities.\n\nThe Education of Koko, a book documenting the early years and discoveries of Project Koko, is published by Holt, Rinehart and Winston.\n\nDr. Patterson participates in a landmark international symposium (along with Drs. Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey and Birute Galdikas), at Sweet Briar College in Virginia exploring the state of research on the great apes\n\n1982\n\nApple, a Landseer Newfoundland puppy, joins the Gorilla Foundation family. Michael, who is becoming renowned for his creativity, immortalizes him in a painting, “Apple Chase,” which depicts Apple engaged in one of his favorite pastimes – chasing Mike!\n\n1983\n\nKoko becomes fascinated by the tiny tree frogs that inhabit her yard. She captures one, and delicately cradles it under her arm, protecting it from Michael. After carrying it around for a while, she places it on some rocks in her yard, under a tub to further shield it from possible rough play. It is an outstanding example of Koko’s innate gentleness and nurturing spirit towards small, vulnerable creatures, and her regard for other species.\n\n1984\n\nThe tenth anniversary of NOVA premieres with Signs of the Apes, Songs of the Whales highlighted by the work of The Gorilla Foundation.\n\nThe Gorilla Foundation sponsors an exhibition of gorilla-created artwork in Honolulu in order to raise public awareness about the Foundation and its goals in Hawaii, where the Foundation hopes to establish a gorilla preserve.\n\nKoko selects the tailless kitten All Ball to be her very own companion.\n\n1985\n\nKoko’s Kitten, immortalizing the relationship between Koko and her kitten All Ball, and destined to become a classic of children’s literature, is published by Scholastic Books and featured on the PBS series Reading Rainbow.\n\nNational Geographic publishes the cover story “Koko’s Kitten” (167,1), featuring the iconic image of Koko cradling All Ball\n\nAn interview with Dr. Patterson is aired during the National Public Radio program, “As It Happens.”\n\nKoko and Michael are featured with Hugh Downs on 20/20.

Students email interview questions for Dr. Patterson and create elaborate displays for their classes about the significance of Project Koko—and conservation through communication.\n\n2006\n\nPaper published with Dr. Joanne Tanner on the discovery that gorillas seem to have their own natural gestural (or “sign”) language, and that this may facilitate their learning a human sign language such as ASL.\n\nGorilla Art Exhibit launched at the Sternberg Museum of Natural History in Hays, Kansas.\n\nKoko’s first sitting with the British Royal Family’s famed portrait artist, Richard Stone.\n\n2007\n\nGorilla Foundation researchers present at numerous conferences around the world about the benefits of teaching great apes sign language to improve their welfare in captivity. A new sign language tutorial database, called ZEST (Zoo Enrichment Signing Tutorial), developed by The Gorilla Foundation is introduced to help other great ape facilities benefit from 2-way communication between apes and caregivers.\n\n2008\n\nThe Gorilla Foundation is welcomed as a member of the American Sanctuary Association.\n\nDr. Anthony Rose comes on board full-time as The Gorilla Foundation’s volunteer Director of Conservation.\n\nKokoTeach, an interactive curriculum development tool for teachers, is launched, allowing Ambassador Koko to come into the classroom to teach everything from sign language and reading to conservation and math.\n\n2009\n\nIn honor of the Year of the Gorilla, the Foundation presents the Wildlife Protectors’ Award to Denis Ndeloh Etiendem of Cameroon to allow him to pursue field research on the Cross River gorilla, the most seriously endangered gorilla subspecies. The project goal is to develop a conservation plan for this species, whose native range is the border area between Cameroon and Nigeria.\n\n15,000 copies of the mini-Koko’s Kitten book are distributed to schools and community groups in Cameroon, as part of the Conservation Values Education outreach program to raise awareness.\n\n2010\n\nThe dramatization of Koko’s Kitten is released in DVD format.Koko acquires a Facebook page, a Twitter account, and a channel on YouTube to better communicate with all her friends and fans.\n\nA change in management at Maui Land & Pineapple Company makes it clear that the original “lease” of 70 acres for the Maui Ape Preserve is not a sufficiently secure mechanism for a permanent sanctuary for gorillas. Hence an assessment of the land — plus an expanded, concentric 350-acre site — for “purchase” is performed. The purchase price (at least several million dollars) would make it necessary to mount a second capital campaign. Hence the project is put on hold until the Foundation is able to establish the development team necessary to complete such an expanded and extended campaign. The interim focus shifts to making the Woodside gorilla facility as comfortable as possible for gorillas Koko and Ndume, using some of the design enhancements developed initially for the Maui Ape Preserve. The Foundation remains open to partnerships with other great ape institutions that would like to share the land for the benefit of great apes.\n\n2013\n\nThe Gorilla Foundation hires Dr. Ken Gold, world-renowned gorilla behavior expert as its Managing Director of Gorilla Care and Research. This frees up more time for Drs. Penny Patterson and Ron Cohn to focus on gorilla care and communication research with gorillas Koko and Ndume.\n\n2014\n\nThe Gorilla Foundation begins to work more closely with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) and its associated Gorilla Species Survival Program (SSP) to create a strategic partnership beneficial to Koko, Ndume and gorillas as a species.\n\nWorld-renowned gorilla experts, Drs. Terry Maple and Joseph Erwin, begin work as consultants for the Gorilla Foundation, to help improve its business and management infrastructure in order to take Project Koko and all 4 of its programs — research, conservation, care and education — to the next level synergistically.\n\nThe Gorilla Foundation’s new website, Koko.org 3.0, planned for several years, finally launches, well before Koko’s 43rd birthday on July 4th.\n\n2016\n\nNew documentary, Koko, the Gorilla who Talks, produced by BBC, is released on both BBC and PBS stations. The documentary describes the personal side of Project Koko and evokes empathy from the public for lifelong commitment that both Penny and Koko have made for the sake of a mission that extends far beyond the two of them — to save all of the great ape species from unnecessary extinction, and to enable a new era of interspecies enrichment fueled by the simple power of a shared language.\n\n2017\n\nThe first prototype of the new Koko App is created with the help of an experienced team of educational software developers. The Koko App has the potential to teach millions of people and hundreds of captive great apes to learn to sign with Koko, and multiply the number of great ape ambassadors in the world, so that Koko is not the only one. A powerful new concept emerges in parallel with the new app, that “all gorillas are Kokos” — at least potentially."
