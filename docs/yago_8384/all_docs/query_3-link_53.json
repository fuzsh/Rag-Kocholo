        "text": "Didn’t catch Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes in theaters or want to watch the film again? The fourth installment in the beloved franchise made its digital debut before it arrives on Hulu sometime later this year. Discover how to watch Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes at home below.\n\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes is the fourth film in the Planet of the Apes reboot franchise and a sequel to 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes. Directed by Wes Ball, the movie takes place three centuries after the events of the war and follows a young chimpanzee named Noa, who embarks on a quest with a human woman named Mae to determine the future for apes and humans alike. Owen Teague, Freya Allan, Kevin Durand, Peter Macon, and William H. Macy round out the cast.\n\n“Set several generations in the future following Caesar’s reign, in which apes are the dominant species living harmoniously and humans have been reduced to living in the shadows,” the film’s synopsis reads. “As a new tyrannical ape leader builds his empire, one young ape undertakes a harrowing journey that will cause him to question all that he has known about the past and to make choices that will define a future for apes and humans alike.”\n\nForbes'Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire' Will Be Streaming On Digital This Month\n\nIn an interview with IndieWire in May, Ball compared “Kingdom” to the Bronze Age for apes. “I always loved that so much time had passed that erased all evidence of our existence in the ’68 film,” he explained. “And then you uncover all of this haunting past of the world that once was that we got to play with here. They couldn’t do that in the previous three movies. They were about the end of the human world; ours is about the beginning of the ape world.”\n\nThe director added that he envisions the Noa/Mae story as the start of a new trilogy. “There’s so much story to tell,” he continued. “What I like about the franchise is that these movies hold up a mirror to our society, the things we’re going through, and we get to look at ourselves and see humanity through these apes’ eyes.”\n\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes debuted strongly at the box office, earning $22.2 million on its first day (including $6.6 million in previews). Overall, the film brought in just under $170 million domestically and $394 million worldwide in theaters, according to Box Office Mojo, and had the second-best launch of the film series.\n\nAs for the costs, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes had a $160 million budget before marketing, coming in at a significantly lower cost than the last two films, both of which boasted $190 million budgets, according to Variety.\n\nThe sequel has garnered praise from critics, earning an impressive 80% critics score and a slightly slower 77% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Are you ready to watch the Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes at home? Find out when and where the film will be available for streaming.\n\nHow To Watch Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes At Home\n\nStarting on July 9, you can stream Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes on video-on-demand sites like Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, and Fandango At Home. The film is available to purchase for $19.99, but there is currently no option to rent the title.\n\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes also be available to watch in 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and DVD beginning on August 27, 2024.\n\nWhen Is Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes Streaming On Hulu?\n\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes will also eventually be available to stream Hulu, but the release date has not yet been announced. Because Walt Disney Studios owns 20th Century Studios, the movie will be available on Hulu’s streaming service (and Disney+ if you have the Disney bundle). You will have to wait a few months before Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes arrives on Hulu.\n\nIn comparison, The Boogeyman premiered in theaters on June 2, 2023, and didn’t hit Hulu until four months later on October 5, 2023. A Haunting in Venice had a quicker turnaround, dropping on Hulu 45 days after it’s theatrical release. Stay tuned to learn exactly when Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes will be available on Hulu.\n\nWatch the official trailer below."
