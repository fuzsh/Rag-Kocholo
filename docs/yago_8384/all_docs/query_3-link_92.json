        "text": "Synopsis\n\n\"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes\" is set several generations after Caesar's reign, with apes dominating and humans living in the shadows. As a new ape leader rises, a young ape named Noa embarks on a challenging quest.\n\n\"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes\" is the fourth installment in the Planet of the Apes reboot series. Set for release on May 10, 2024, this film takes audiences on a new journey into the world where apes rule and humans struggle to survive. With a fresh cast and a compelling storyline, fans are eager to see how this chapter unfolds.\n\nRelease Date\n\n\"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes\" is set to hit theaters on May 10, 2024, after nearly seven years since the last installment. It will face competition from the spoof movie \"Not Another Church Movie\" and Chris Pine's directorial debut \"Poolman.\"\n\nTheatrical Release and Streaming\n\nThe film will have an exclusive theatrical release, but it's expected to stream on Disney+ or Hulu later. With Disney's acquisition of Comcast's stake in Hulu, both platforms might merge, providing a single streaming option for viewers.\n\nTrailers\n\nThe first teaser trailer for \"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes\" was released on November 2, 2023, followed by a second trailer during the Super Bowl. These teasers hint at a fresh take on the franchise, with a new lead ape and a more evolved storytelling approach.\n\nPlot\n\nSet 300 years after Caesar's death, the film follows Noa, a young ape discovering Caesar's legacy. The main antagonist is Proximus Caesar, a tyrannical ape leader. The story explores themes of legacy, leadership, and the future of both species.\n\nCast\n\nOwen Teague stars as Noa, alongside Kevin Durand as Proximus Caesar and Peter Macon as Raka. Freya Allan plays Mae, a human character joining Noa on his journey. The ensemble cast includes William H. Macy, Eka Darville, and others.\n\nProduction Team\n\nDirected by Wes Ball, known for \"The Maze Runner\" trilogy, the film features a screenplay by Josh Friedman, Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, and Patrick Aison. Filmed at Disney Studios Australia, the production wrapped in February 2023, promising a visually stunning and emotionally gripping cinematic experience.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhen is 'Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes' releasing?\n\nThe film is set to release on May 10, 2024, after nearly seven years since the last installment, War for the Planet of the Apes.\n\nWill 'Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes' be available for streaming?\n\nYes, but it will initially enjoy an exclusive theatrical release. However, when it does go to streaming, it will likely be on Disney+ or Hulu.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
