        "text": "Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes has received glowing early reviews as the film premiered in Hollywood on Thursday evening (2 May).\n\nAfter critics caught a glimpse of the forthcoming Matt Reeves film for the first time, many said it was not the best in the sci-fi franchise, but agreed it was an exciting continuation of the plot.\n\nAdapted from the Pierre Boulle book Planet of the Apes, the franchise tells the story of intelligent apes who have risen to power and face new challenges as the humans and apes try to inhabit the same world. The forthcoming Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, set around 300 years after the end of War for the Planet of the Apes, follows young ape Noa (Owen Teague), who embarks on a journey to find freedom, and meets a human (played by The Witcher‘s Freya Allan) along the way.\n\nIn a string of positive reviews shared on X/Twitter following the premiere, Digital Spy’s movie’s editor Ian Sandwell wrote that while the film takes some time to find its footing, it “builds into a captivating second act and a thrilling finale”.\n\nAnother critic also added the film “takes a minute to get going” since it has to introduce new characters and a timeline, but after that, it never looks back.\n\n“Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is just a classic summer blockbuster. VFX are astonishing. Great performances. Feels like a start to an epic new saga. Need the next one ASAP.”\n\nOne critic called it a “worthy successor to the throne” of the franchise.\n\n“It’s a genuinely exciting action adventure, perhaps larger in scope than the last films, but just as grounded in honest emotion.”\n\nAnother enthusiastic viewer went as far as claiming it was the best visual effects in a blockbuster since the acclaimed CGI film Avatar: The Way of Water was released in 2022.\n\nThere are a total of nine movies set within the Planet of the Apes universe, with the last film War for the Planet of the Apes finishing with the apes mourning their leader, Caesar (played by Andy Serkis), after a brutal battle with the opposing human armies. Ceaser’s body is taken to a place he considered the promised land but there is a suggestion his legacy lives on.\n\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes is out on 9 May in UK cinemas. Its US release is 10 May."
