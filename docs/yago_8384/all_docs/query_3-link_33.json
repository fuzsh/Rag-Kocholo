        "text": "sex\n\nSome scenes contain sexualised breast and buttock nudity as a woman performs as part of an erotic dance show.\n\ndiscrimination\n\nThere are scenes containing crude and outdated racist stereotypes, including a man in black face, with a shackle and chain around his foot, referred to as slave; there are also tapestries depicting indigenous men as cannibals. There is also use of racist behaviour and language (e.g. 'negro').\n\ntheme\n\nThere are scenes in which a woman is exploited as part of a 'freak show' for her body hair. A man emotionally manipulates her into thinking that he is doing it for her own benefit, making her perform and act like an 'ape'. He ignores her protests about audience members who become 'too handsy' during shows, and in another sequence, the woman escapes before she is given over to another man interested in her 'virginal status' and needing to examine her naked, claiming he is an expert.\n\nThere are undetailed verbal references to abortion."
