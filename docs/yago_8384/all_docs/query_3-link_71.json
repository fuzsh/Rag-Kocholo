        "text": "Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes VIOLENCE/GORE 6\n\n– Gorillas and apes taser a horse and follow it to a clan’s settlement where they set structures on fire and kill many of the apes living there; we see tasers flashing, and many apes being struck and beaten, structures collapse in flames, an ape is struck down and a gorilla hits him (below the frame) and holds up what appear to be bones (like they were pulled out of the ape). A gorilla moves toward an ape and the ape raises a flaming torch to defend himself, but he is tasered; they fight briefly and another ape strikes the gorilla and runs through the structure, the gorilla catches him and pins him by the throat on the ground, the gorilla pounds on another ape mercilessly and we see blood on the ape’s face and mouth; another ape jumps on the gorilla’s back and is thrown over a platform and swings from a rope that the gorilla tasers and the ape falls slamming into parts of the structure on the way to the ground.\n\n► Several apes are sent to scare away humans suspected of encroaching on a clan of apes; we later see the first group of apes dead with bloody wounds after an attack by gorillas and apes with weapons that look like cattle prods, one ape dies with a knife in his back and another is dragged by his foot still attached to his horse. A woman, an ape and an orangutan find a bridge over a river and cross it; we see gorillas climbing along under the bridge and gorillas on horseback stand at either end of the bridge, an ape grabs the woman from behind and she struggles, they fall into the water and the woman clings onto a net that the orangutan pulls toward the bridge as the rope breaks, the woman climbs back onto the bridge, the gorilla cuts the rope that the orangutan is holding onto and he is washed away in the rapids; the ape is pounded repeatedly by a gorilla and we see his bloody face and head and the ape and the woman are tied to the back of a horse and led to a large compound of gorillas and apes. A man discovers a woman and two apes and the woman attacks the man strangling him to death.\n\n► Humans drink water from a stream as we hear a loud horn being blown in the distance, and the humans stand and seem alarmed until we see gorillas on horseback charging toward them using ropes and tasers and nets to catch them; one human is chased by a gorilla on horseback and she hides in tall grass until an ape on horseback charges toward her and catches her when she jumps toward him and they ride away.\n\n► A gorilla pounds on an ape’s back and throws him several times (we see the ape with blood on his face and he drools blood from his mouth); an eagle swoops toward the gorilla and scratches his face, then many eagles swoop around him pushing him off a cliff (we see him fall to his death). A gorilla holds an ape with a knife to its throat and a woman shoots the gorilla in the chest killing it (we see blood drip from the wound). An ape walks through a forest and steps on a trap, he falls into a deep hole and catches a vine that he swings from dangling over a large fire, then gets free and falls near the flames; an orangutan threatens him but does not harm him.\n\n► Two apes and a woman walk across a treacherous passage where heavy waves crash on the rocks, and they climb a sheer rock wall with the woman clinging to one ape’s back; rocks pull away from the wall and the one ape with the woman on his back falls, but grabs back on unharmed. Three apes hear a noise in the brush and run, they end up at the edge of a cliff and one says that a jump to the other side is too far; one ape uses a metal pole to drive into the wall of the other side and climbs up to a large nest where he takes an egg before an eagle swoops down and he falls, slides down a steep wall and dangles from a broken piece of a structure. An ape hears rustling in the woods and chases a woman away, raising a weapon toward her. A woman and three apes enter a large compound where the woman engages a generator that turns on lights and we hear a whirring sound of motors spinning that startles the apes; the woman finds a cabinet that holds weapons.\n\n► Explosives are planted around a compound, and explosives are detonated: the explosions break open a dam that releases giant walls of water that flow over many apes and into a compound; apes and gorillas climb structures inside to outrun the water and some are overcome and drown, and one gorilla chases an ape through the structure and the ape leads him through smaller and smaller passages until the gorilla cannot fit and he is overcome by flowing water and drowned.\n\n► A noise is heard in brush and an ape throws a stone at something moving behind a tree; we hear a sound, it runs away and three apes chase it to a tunnel and the apes say that whatever it was, it was not an ape. An ape hears a sound in a structure and when he investigates, he finds a woman hiding; she lunges toward him and runs. Three apes climb a structure that has become overgrown, they jump from platforms to reach a high point where an eagle’s nest is perched, take two eggs from the nest and leave. An eagle screeches and flies toward an ape, scratching his arm and flying away.\n\n► Gorillas and apes are called to a meeting place by loud horns and drums; a gorilla climbs to a platform and speaks to the crowd before ordering some of them holding heavy chains attached to giant metal doors to pull; an electrical charge is sent to the doors and we see molten metal and the chains snap throwing the apes holding them.\n\n► Three apes find a children’s book with illustrations of gorillas and apes held in cages in a zoo. An ape finds his father dead among burning rubble after an attack by a clan of gorillas and he covers him with rocks. An ape lies dead on a platform as other apes place flowers on the body and a fire is lit under the platform engulfing the body. An eagle swoops through the air and dips down to snatch a fish out of water carrying it to its nest. An ape realizes that the eagle egg he is carrying has been broken and we see yolk spilling out. An orangutan throws food toward a woman hiding behind a tree and tosses a blanket she can use to cover herself.\n\n► An ape makes a remark about a human’s odor. We are told that a man-made virus devastated the human population. Apes talk about the laws of their clan in several scenes. An ape says that another ape’s father hates him. An orangutan tells an ape that there is a law that ape shall not kill ape."
