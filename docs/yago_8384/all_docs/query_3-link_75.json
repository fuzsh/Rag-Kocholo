        "text": "Disney held the final big studio presentation of CinemaCon 2024 and it brought updates for a few Disney and Marvel projects, including Inside Out 2, Deadpool & Wolverine, Captain America: Brave New World, Moana 2, Mufasa: The Lion King, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, Young Woman and the Sea, and much more.\n\nWhile a lot of what was shown at Disney's CinemaCon presentation was only for those in the room for now, IGN was in attendance and can at least share with you our impressions and breakdowns of all the big footage that was featured. And it only feels right to kick things off with Deadpool & Wolverine...\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine Shows Nine Minutes of Footage at CinemaCon: 'Suck it Fox, We're Going to Disneyland'\n\nOn stage at CinemaCon 2024, Marvel's Kevin Feige helped introduce nine minutes of footage from Deadpool & Wolverine. Before the footage was shown, he dropped F-bomb after F-bomb as he's allowed to say them now because the movie is rated R.\n\nAs for the footage, it all kicked off with Ryan Reynolds' Wade Wilson no longer as a superhero but as a used car salesman. While he may not be a superhero at the moment, he is still very inappropriate and, on a test drive with a family, says, \"not that I didn't want to have [kids], I just haven't had a lot of vaginal sex.\"\n\nAfter we see Wilson still has his Deadpool outfit in his locker, he and Rob Delaney's Peter head back to the one bedroom apartment he splits with Blind Al and get shocked by a surprise birthday party. Here we get to see one of the fourth-wall breaks when Wilson says, \"Hey, cocaine is the one thing Feige said is off limits!\"\n\nThe party is then interrupted as Wilson is taken by the Time Variance Authority and meets Mr. Paradox. He says Deadpool can save the sacred timeline and that he is going to give him everything he's ever wanted. Deadpool responds with, \"Suck it, Fox. We're going to Disneyland!\" and then proceeds to put on his new costume.\n\nWe then got a sizzle reel with extended trailer footage, including Deadpool and Wolverine in his yellow suit.\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine will be released in theaters on July 26, 2024.\n\nCaptain America: Brave New World Shows First Footage at CinemaCon: Harrison Ford Asks Anthony Mackie to Rebuild the Avengers\n\nCaptain America: Brave New World footage was revealed at CinemaCon and, perhaps most excitingly, it featured Harrison Ford's Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross asking Anthony Mackie's Captain America to rebuild the Avengers.\n\nWe also were shown President Ross speaking with his staff while having a lollipop because he can't smoke cigars anymore. He then reveals his new look (Ross used to be played by the late William Hurt) is because he had to \"lose the mustache of lose the election.\"\n\nThe footage cuts to Isaiah Bradley and another agent being \"activated\" by some high pitch noise and they start attacking our heroes. Chaos ensues and President Ross even throws a big punch. As Sam notes, the \"inner circle has been compromised.\"\n\nCaptain America: Brave New World is set to be released in theaters on February 14, 2025.\n\n13 Minutes of Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes Sets Up the Wild Adventure to Come\n\nAttendees at Disney's CinemaCon presentation were treated to 13 minutes of footage from Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and it all began with some beautiful shots of nature. We follow a hawk down a river in the woods with rapids and waterfalls and we are soon in the company of some young apes making their way along cliffs and treetops.\n\nNoah, the protagonist of Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, is one of these three apes and he leaps across a chasm and climbs his way up to a nest of eggs. The mother hawk returns and knocks him off and he starts sliding down a cliff before saving himself.\n\nWe then cut to Noah's village being attacked by bad apes who want to burn it down. They wear armor and have tasers and beat up Noah something bad. He wakes up after the battle and appears to be the only ape left. He finds the body of his father and buries him under stones and vows to find the missing apes and bring them home.\n\nHe comes across an old train tunnel and exits to the ruins of an American city where the skyscrapers are all overgrown with vegetation. It's a striking image and only the beginning of Noah's journey.\n\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes will be released in theaters on May 8, 2024.\n\nYoung Woman and the Sea Trailer Gives the World a Look at Daisy Ridley as an Olympic Swimmer Defying All the Odds\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nYoung Woman and the Sea is a biographical drama film starring Daisy Ridley as Gertrude 'Trudy' Ederle, an Olympic champion who overcame incredible odds in the early 1900s and completed a 21-mile swim from France to England through the English Channel.\n\nThe film is set to be released in theaters on May 31, 2024, and we were treated to its official trailer and a new poster.\n\nJoining Ridley is Tilda Cobham-Hervey, Stephen Graham, Kim Bodnia, Christopher Eccleston, and Glenn Fleshler, and the film is being directed by Joachim Rønning and written by Jeff Nathanson. It's also based on the book \"Young Woman and the Sea: How Trude Ederle Conquered the English Channel and Inspired the World\" by Glenn Stout.\n\nThe film is also being produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and is said to be the highest-testing movie of his career.\n\nAlien: Romulus Footage Is As Scary As It Is Awesome\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe above trailer is not from CinemaCon 2024.\n\nA few scenes from Alien: Romulus were shown at CinemaCon and it all began with a pre-taped intro from Ridley Scott and director Fede Álvarez before jumping into a few scenes from the film.\n\nWe get to see Cailee Spaeny's Rain Carradine and crew investigating a ship, an android rebooting itself, a xenomorph escaping from a container and swimming through a flooded ship before face hugging one of the crew, a chest-bursting seizure scene, and more.\n\nAlien: Romulus will be released in theaters on August 16, 2024.\n\nInside Out 2 Footage Shows the Troubles of Becoming a Teenager\n\nAmy Poehler, who once again plays Joy in Inside Out 2, helped introduce 35 minutes of the sequel to those in the seats at Disney's CinemaCon presentation. While we won't spoil too much here, we see Riley, who is now 13, trying to impress the older kids at the girls hockey team camp she wins a spot on.\n\nHowever, her newly emerging emotions - Anxiety, Boredom, Envy, and Embarrassment - basically take over and lock away her original emotions now that she has more complicated feelings to work out as a teenager.\n\nInside Out 2 will be released in theaters on June 14, 2024.\n\nMufasa: The Lion King Gets a Quick, Yet Beautiful First Look\n\nMufasa: The Lion King director Barry Jenkins stopped by CinemaCon to discuss the much-anticipated prequel to The Lion King and shared a first look teaser of the film that is set to be released in theaters on December 20, 2024.\n\nJenkins explained that this movie is \"so full of heart\" and explains how people who become great become the way they are. There will be plenty of new songs, and the story will see Mufasa, Scar, and others going on a journey throughout Africa.\n\nThe footage was brief but it featured a snowy part of Africa and a voice-over that said the story begins far beyond the mountains and the shadows on the other side of the light.\n\nMoana 2 Footage Teases the New Adventures Ahead\n\nCinemaCon 2024 also revealed the first footage of Moana 2 to those in attendance and we even got to hear a new song that goes a little like this - \"Finally we're back, back to who we're meant to be!\"\n\nWe get glimpses of Moana on her boat with Pua and singing about coming home to her island. We then get to see a little of that joyful reunion and everyone on the island rejoices in song that Moana has returned from beyond the horizon.\n\nA sizzle reel was then shown and it featured Hei Hei, sunsets, the wide open ocean, and a short look at Maui.\n\nMoana 2 will be released in theaters on November 27, 2024.\n\nThe Amateur Is a Tale of Blackmail and Revenge\n\nThe Amateur is a new film starring Rami Malek and an exclusive sneak peek was given to those at Disney's presentation at CinemaCon 2024. The film will be released on April 11, 2025, and tells the story of a CIA cryptographer who blackmails his agency to train him and send him on a mission to kill the terrorists who murdered his wife."
