Shown is Annie Giarardot (the \"ape woman\" in the film) in a dressing room with two other semi-clothed, \"normal\" women, conveying an immediate irony as she looks up at her husband (Ugo Tognazzi) standing in the doorway. With the stamps of both the French Dalmas and Italian Publifoto photo agencies on the verso. Inspired by the real life story of Julia Pastrana, who suffered from a condition that caused excessive hairiness, and was exhibited in a freak show and mummified after her death by her husband/manager. Nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes. 8.25 x 10.5 inches. Near Fine with a touch of rubbing to the edges and slight curl. - The Ape Woman [La donna scimmia] (Original photograph from the 1964 film)",
