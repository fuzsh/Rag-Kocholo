Gail M. Burns writes: “At the 2013 Berkshire Fringe Festival (BFF) my favorite was May van Oskan’s remarkable rock opera The Ape Woman… Even in death she was used and abused by the patriarchal world that saw her as less than human. While the story is tragic, van Oskan’s distinctive music and lyrics reached to the heart of the tale and made it visceral and poignant.”\n\nA link to the full article is on the Gallery&Press page. Happy new year, and thank you to everyone — press, cast, band, production, tech– who made 2013 the most remarkable year yet for The Ape Woman family.\n\nThe long awaited LIVE ALBUM, recorded at The Berkshire Fringe! Listen to the show in its entirety, share it with your friends, corporeal and otherwise. Feliz Dia de los Muertos!\n\nGet it here: https://mayvanoskan.bandcamp.com/album/the-ape-woman-live-at-the-berkshire-fringe\n\nJust in time for Dia de los Muertos, The Ape Woman LIVE at The Berkshire Fringe is finally set to drop on November 2nd! This beautifully recorded album of the entire live show as it was performed in August will be available at mayvanoskan.bandcamp.com and while you’re there, you can check out some recent live solo recordings by May van Oskan. Thank you again to the folks at the Fringe, and especially to our amazing sound guy and recording engineer Dave Rice for making it happen.\n\nClick to Read the Review\n\nA lovely nod from Gail M. Burns at Berkshire On Stage. Thank you very much! (By the way, Miss Julia did not in fact have two rows of teeth. Goes to show you just how far reaching and pervasive the misinformation age can be.)\n\nIn other delightful news, Master of Soundwaves Dave Rice has just today bounced me the rough mix for our live album! It’s just like being there, you’re going to love it. I’ll set up a pre-order as soon as I get back to California.\n\nEnjoy the dripping golden dregs of August, my friends, and I will see you soon.\n\nWe did it! HUGE thank you to Sara Katzoff, Peter Wise, Ryan Olson, Tim Cryan, and all the outstanding interns at The Berkshire Fringe. They made it easy and delightful for us to bring a very tricky show to a whole new audience. Thanks also to Willy Mason for letting us borrow the coolest tour bus ever. I didn’t want to go home, and indeed that sentiment prevailed over many in our ensemble.\n\nSo what’s next? Well we’ve got an amazing live recording by the immeasurable engineer Dave Rice (pictured far right, looking pensive and mysterious as ever) that will soon become our new live album! That’s what. I’m setting up a preorder, so watch this space! And if you’d like said album to arrive in your ears sooner, that donate button is still working.\n\nOh, one more thing, for our fans on Martha’s Vineyard: some of the ensemble will be presenting a cabaret-style version of the show at the Oak Bluffs Arts District gallery walk on August 10th, please stop by for a song or stay for the whole shebang!\n\nOur first run in a major city was a SMASH! Thank you to everyone who came out and supported us at The Exit Theatre. Time to rest up, fly across the country, and do it all again. Oh, and wash those costumes…\n\nWhat a nice way to start a Monday. Ash Clayton and I stopped by FCC Free Radio this morning as the musical guest for Stage Time with Steven Alan Green. We played a special version of Glass Coffin, featuring ukulele and theremin. You can listen to the podcast here.\n\nThank you very much to Steven for having us on his show, and to his lovely co-host Justine for inviting us. We had a wonderful time.\n\nTime to get your smock on.\n\nI had the enviable pleasure of working with artist Alisa Javits at her home studio all afternoon, getting some paint and a lot of imagination on canvas for the set of The Ape Woman. The idea is to keep it light and portable so that, in the spirit of the circus, we can roll it all up and take the show on the road.\n\nI am amazed at how many artists, like Alisa, have chosen to get involved with the show on such a bareknuckle, all-day-long level. In honor of these hardworking ape appreciators, I’ll be adding a new feature to the website to host their bios and links to their work. Stay tuned for that. If great art is an opportunity for generosity, collaboration, and co-creation, then I guess this is it."
