Has a reversible sleeve.\n\nAll disc content plays in A no problem no nasty PAL either.\n\nPicture has certainly been remastered looks fantastic.\n\nThe documentary is the same one that's on DVD and YouTube Il Regista Che Venne Dal Futuro disappointing but still good content and that's definitely not been remastered (has non-removable English subtitles) it's a copy & paste job.\n\nBack cover of the standalone documentary that was released on DVD:\n\nIGC\n\nDistinguished Member\n\nJoined\n\nMay 22, 2017\n\nMessages\n\n2,950\n\nReaction score\n\n3,728\n\nPoints\n\n1,436\n\nLocation\n\nUK\n\nNov 6, 2021\n\n#3\n\ndisc review\n\nNot sure what the reviewer has been smoking when talking about the image."
