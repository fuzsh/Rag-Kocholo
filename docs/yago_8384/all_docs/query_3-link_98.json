        "text": "The Rise of the Planet of the Apes is promoted as an ‘origin story’. It shows how genetic manipulation lets apes become the dominant species on Earth. The movie begins in present-day San Francisco, where genetic scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) has developed an experimental virus, ALZ-112. The virus is designed to reverse the effects of Alzheimer’s disease. Will’s desperate to find a cure because his father Charles (John Lithgow) has the disease. At GenSys genetics laboratories, Will has been administering ALZ-112 to a female chimpanzee. The experiment has had positive results until the chimp attacks her handlers and is shot by security guards. Afterwards, Will finds a newborn male chimp in the dead mother’s cage. He takes the baby home, thinking it will only be for a little while.\n\nThree years later, the baby chimp – now named Caesar (Andy Serkis) – is functioning at the level of an eight-year-old human, having apparently inherited his mother’s modified genes. Disaster strikes when Caesar is placed in an primate animal shelter run by John Landon (Brian Cox) and his cruel son Dodge (Tom Felton). After being tormented and mistreated in the shelter, Caesar turns his back on humanity, communicates with other apes and begins to plan his escape.\n\nCaesar escapes and steals several canisters of the new and improved ALZ-113. He releases it at the primate shelter while the other apes are sleeping. They wake in the morning with heightened consciousness and intelligence, ready to take on their human handlers and the rest of humanity."
