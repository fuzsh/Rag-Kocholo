Letter from\n\nHistorical\n\nSociety, Bardstown, Ct.\n\n[NI0324] !Pioneer in Creek County Ok, wonderful oil country. On his property the\n\nfirst oil\n\nwell was drilled. He had 14 at one time; owned a lot of land in Ok.; was\n\ncommunity oriented. Proof: family records, newspaper articles, History of\n\nOklahoma\n\nby Joseph B. Thaburn. This article says a son, Frank, worked on the Osage\n\nranch\n\nbut I don't have a record of any son by that name. I found a record\n\nwhere a\n\nLuna Wheeler attended the Tulsa College in 1908.\n\nSome of these Wheelers are buried at Stillwater, Oklahoma. On his property\n\nwas\n\ndiscovered oil by a Tom Slick uncovering one of the richest oil strikes\n\never to\n\nbe found in the U.S.-see \"The Oklahoma Petroleum Industry\" by Kenny A.\n\nFranks,\n\npublished by the Oklahoma Press at Norman.\n\n[NI0325] !Settled at Lebanon; had no issue.\n\n[NI0326] !He was the father of John, the Steamboat Inventor. He was brought up in a\n\nfamily in Hartford where he received a good education; resided just North\n\nof\n\nthe line between East Hartford and South Windsor. The Fitch family\n\ngeanology\n\nstates that he probably died 29 March 1789, age 80. If so he was born\n\nlong\n\nafter his father died in 1697-10 years to be exact.\n\n[NI0327] !Resided Mass.\n\n[NI0335] !He was a Stonemason, a Circuit Rider Preacher who later preached from\n\nthe pulpit in a wheel chair for twenty years. It was said of him that he\n\nwas\n\neither interpreting, debating, or preaching the Revelations. It is also\n\nsaid\n\nthat he was in the 1889 Oklahoma run. He was not. There are several\n\ncensus\n\nrecords that proved he was in Arkansas at that time. There is also a\n\ncourt\n\nrecord in Arkansas dated during that time and he had to be in Arkansas to\n\nfather his daughter, Mary during the 1889 run period.\n\nHe went to the Oklahoma Territory in the fall of 1893. His son, Virgil, was\n\nthe\n\nfirst child born in Oklahoma and was nicknamed \"Sooner\". It is beleved that\n\nhe\n\nmade the run 1893 but he started leasing school land in 1894 on the\n\nPawnee land\n\nand that was settled by allotment. However, Aunt Daisy and others said\n\nhe was\n\nin a run. It is a puzzle.\n\nHe went to Oregon in 1905 and stayed for two years. His youngest child\n\nwas\n\nborn there. They lived near Oregon City in Horny Valley Burns Co. They\n\ntraveled in a covered wagon making about seven miles a day.\n\n[NI0337] !Married Col.
