But it is inevitably selective. The idea that an 'encyclopedia' (as the word itself seems to suggest) will 'encircle all there is to know about a subject' is misleading; the word's derivation more helpfully indicates that an encyclopedia has to do with 'providing a course of general education,' a definition that clearly emphasizes the instructional, rather than the inclusive, nature of books of this kind. The emphasis also falls on the word 'general.' Although this book, for example, attempts to range across history (from early records to the year 2000) and to provide data about all parts of Canada and about literature in a range of languages, not just the two that are official (English and French), it would need to be several volumes long to deal with all these subjects (and more) in greater detail. Relatedly, while it alludes from time to time to particular influences from elsewhere (Shakespeare, the Persianghazal, B U D D H I S M , Victor Hugo, MARXISM, BLOOMSBURY, the PARNASSIANS, the Grimms' fairy tales), it makes no attempt to chart the history of the world's literatures, not even those with which literature in Canada is most closely connected. However much the articles range, the book's focus remains on Canada. It looks at the storytellers, the writers, the writings, and the cultural history that in one way or another are associated with Canada, and at the images, the attitudes, and the mythologies with which, in some instances, Canada is identified. To enable readers to find the information they are looking for, this Encyclopedia of Litera-\n\nture in Canada adopts seven organizational features: 1 The main series of articles follows an alphabetical sequence, with entries indicated in boldface. 2 Within this sequence is a series of crossreferences to other articles, indicated by names in SMALL CAPITALS; sometimes these cross-references allude to other mentions of the subject, and sometimes they extend the discussion through another topic. Cross-references are not always in the exact word form of the article titles to which they refer. 3 At the end of many of the main-text entries is a list of works that the contributors have recommended for Further reading, as extensions of or supplements to the articles in question. 4 An appendix at the end of the book traces a cultural Chronology against which to read the main-text entries. 5 An Index by Contributor lists the article or set of articles that each contributor wrote. 6 An Index of Authors included in the book enumerates all mentions of each author's name. 7 A Supplementary Index lists names of individuals and groups, pseudonyms, and some terms that are mentioned in the text but for which there is no separate entry. Some of the main entries are primarily informational, compiling lists of data, as in the article called AWARDS AND LITERARY PRIZES, which assembles the names of prizewinners and their books and outlines the terms of recognition. Related informational articles on ARCHIVES and on REFERENCE GUIDES explain where manu-\n\nPREFACE\n\nscript materials are to be found and where to find out more about a variety of subjects. Still other entries provide information about crossconnections between literature, MUSIC, and the VISUAL ARTS. But many other entries are discursive. Some of these are surveys, constituting small 'courses of general education' within the larger one; they address such topics as recurrent motifs in ACADIAN WRITING, ANGLOPHONE writing, FRANCOPHONE WRITING OUTSIDE ACADIA AND QUEBEC, and QUEBEC WRITING IN\n\nFRENCH. Another series of articles looks at literary modes and genres, recording features of, for example, CHILDREN'S LITERATURE, CRITICISM AND T H E O R Y , the D O C U M E N T A R Y , the N O V E L ,\n\nTHEATRE HISTORY, and the like. Further general studies are concerned less with genre than with questions of RELIGION, CLASS, GENDER, RACE, sexuality, ethnicity, NATIONALISM, REGIONALISM, and other systems of social organization, demonstrating how these concerns affect literature in Canada (across language differences) by shaping a shared - and/or a disparate and confrontational - understanding of value and power. So as to be as useful as possible, this book also interprets widely the term 'literature in Canada/ For example, the main entries deal primarily with individual authors - ATWOOD, BEAULIEU, CALLAGHAN, DESSAULLES, KING, LIM,\n\nMISTRY, TYNES, and over 1,400 others -but no attempt has been made to define the term 'Canadian author.' There are Canadian-born writers listed here and literary figures who were born in what is now territorial Canada before 'Canada' ever existed. There are some writers listed who were temporary residents, some who immigrated, some who consider themselves exiles in Canada, some who are expatriates, some who have actively striven to separate from Canada, and some who have relinquished their Canadian citizenship, only to seek later to take it up again. In each case where a main entry exists for a writer, attempts were made to ascertain his or her matrilineal as well as patrilineal heritage and to be precise about dates and places of birth and other biographical details, but (despite questionnaires sent to contemporary authors) a few inconsistencies remain. In some instances, authors wished not to disclose data they considered private, and in others, the\n\nviii\n\ninformation was simply not available, having disappeared into inexact and incomplete historical records. Sometimes (j. MACKAY' is a case in point) even identities are unclear, and when research suggests two differing possibilities, the entry records both biographical hypotheses. At other times (the long-resolved mystery of'P.P. GROVE,' for example, and the identity of GREY OWL), the entries record both the mystery and the solution. Interspersed with the genre surveys, the informational compilations, and the authorcentred entries are articles on several other kinds of subject, though (as this book is not a 'companion' to a given set of books) there is one deliberate omission: with a very few exceptions, there are no entries on individual titles; instead, separate works are discussed, in varying degrees of detail, within the author entries and the general studies of genres, motifs, and ideas. The exceptions, moreover, are less for individual texts than for the impact that certain texts have had within Canadian cultural and social history, as with the ANNE OF GREEN GABLES phenomenon, the GOLDEN DOG tablet, or the TWO SOLITUDES school of cultural interpretation. Parallel entries address certain influential historical events - events that, whatever their origin, began over time to function iconographically, to signify cultural tensions or self-images that the society in general came to consider symbolic (the GUIBORD AFFAIR, the PERSONS CASE) Or\n\noccasionally exotic (the GOUZENKO CONTROVERSY). Of special interest are those events that came to function recurrently as literary allusions - that is, to carry literary force within Canadian texts: the completion of the CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY, CONFEDERATION, the HALIFAX EXPLOSION, the KLONDIKE gold rush, the UNITED EMPIRE LOYALIST arrival, the N O R T H - W E S T R E B E L L I O N , the R E B E L L I O N S OF\n\n1837, the OCTOBER CRISIS, the QUIET REVOLUTION, the WINNIPEG GENERAL STRIKE. The entry on HISTORICAL ANALOGUES surveys how these and related allusions function; still other events (Dieppe, the Montreal Massacre, Joey Smallwood's Newfoundland referendum) are accessible through the supplementary index. Place, too, functions emblematically, as the articles on LANDSCAPE and the NORTH separately observe. In addition, each of the prov-\n\nPREFACE\n\ninces and territories has its own entry summarizing historical and statistical data, the kind of information that often proves relevant to a reading of the literature set in that specific part of the country. Society and culture are interconnected in this book: one entry mentions the active role of various writers in securing VOTING RIGHTS, another the importance of the REFUS GLOBAL manifesto; a third looks at literary HOAXES, a fourth at the trickster COYOTE; a fifth identifies the real CABBAGETOWN, a sixth the whereabouts of the fictional MANAWAKA. Among the other kinds of entries to be found here are several that deal with the institutional framework through which authors and readers meet. Hence there are entries not only on LITERARY HISTORY but also on BOOK HISTORY in Canada; still other contributors address questions associated with BOOKSTORES, BOOK\n\nvariously address the changes that occur in literary expression because of (and through) changes in systems of value, themselves related to the interactions between speech, print media, and electronic forms of communication. Yet another series of articles - those on ORAL LITERATURE AND HISTORY, on FOLKLORE, and on MYTHOLOGY, for example - demonstrate how culture in Canada is also shaped by inheritance as well as by contemporary fashion and the politics of the everyday. Numerous articles, therefore, record the plurality of Canadian culture, both directly - in the two entries called CULTURAL PLURALITY and MULTICULTURAL VOICES (the latter deals with writers who compose in one or another of Canada's 'unofficial' languages) and those that deal with JEWISH and MENNONITE writers, BLACK\n\nD E S I G N , the PUBLISHING INDUSTRY, NEWSPAPERS, JOURNALS, EDITORS AND EDITING, LITERARY AGENTS, REVIEWING, READERS, LIBRARIES,\n\nLITERATURE, and RELIGION - and indirectly, in the several articles on cultural connections with\n\nCOPYRIGHT, LIBEL, CENSORSHIP, TEACHING,\n\nand academic programs in WOMEN'S STUDIES and creative WRITING. Because 'literature in Canada' is also a term that applies widely across many subjects and forms of expression, this range is also reflected here, in articles that deal with the usual categories of literature (POETRY, fiction, DRAMA, the ESSAY) - and those that look more closely at aspects of these genres; for example, the articles on SOUND POETRY, VISUAL POETRY, COWBOY POETRY, the LONG POEM, the SHORT STORY, the NOVELLA, the ANIMAL STORY, HUMOUR AND SATIRE, PARODY, the CAPTIVITY NARRATIVE, EXPLORATION LITERATURE, TRAVELLERS AND TRAVEL WRITING, BIOGRAPHY, LIFE WRITING, URBAN WRITING, SCIENCE FICTION AND FANTASY, MYSTERY AND ROMANCE, UTOPIA - as well as those that look through other lenses. Among the articles that consider these 'other' categories are those that examine the character of SCIENCE AND NATURE WRITING, of WAR AND LITERATURE, and of SPORTS WRITING, COMIC BOOK LITERATURE, COOKBOOKS, the HARLEQUIN, the lyrics of popular MUSIC, and other forms of POPULAR CULTURE. Articles on INTELLECTUAL HISTORY, on RHETORIC, On HISTORIOGRAPHY, On RADIO, On FILM, TELEVISION, AND LITERATURE, and On TECHNOLOGY, C O M M U N I C A T I O N S , AND LITERATURE\n\nHISTORY, the DOUKHOBORS, SCOTTISH GAELIC\n\nAFRICA, ASIA, AUSTRALIA, EUROPE, LATIN\n\nAMERICA, and the UNITED STATES (and numerous more specific regions of the world) and in the three articles on LANGUAGE (Aboriginal and trade languages, Canadian English, and Canadian French). Further articles on FIRST NATIONS LITERATURE, On the METIS, On the NATIVE IN\n\nLITERATURE, and on the Aboriginal oral literatures themselves extend even further the range of coverage within the Encyclopedia. Readers who wish to find out more about these subjects should consult the entries on ALGONQUIAN, CREE, HAIDA, INUIT, IROQUOIAN, K T U N A X A , KWAKWALA, NORTHERN ATHAPASKAN, OJIBWA, SALISH, TLINGIT, T S I M S H I A N I C , and WAKASHAN\n\nand the related articles on individual authors who used these languages for literary expression (eg, George HUNT, SEIDAYAA, SKAAY,), as well as the articles on the BEOTHUK and the NORTH. To discuss all these writers, their works, the issues and emotions they deal with, the institutions that affect them, and the events and beliefs that shape their cultural contexts, the contributors to this volume (listed in the preliminary pages) have inevitably drawn from time to time on a conventional literary vocabulary and a series of historically familiar terms. (Editing the Encyclopedia has also necessitated the use of a number of abbreviations; these also are listed at\n\nix\n\nPREFACE\n\nthe front of the book.) So that the conventions and references might be shared by all who use this book, several of the terms that are used in the articles are also denned within the list of main entries assembled here. No attempt is made to substitute for any of the numerous available dictionaries of literary terms, but there are entries on particular literary usages (eg,\n\ninteresting observations about literature and the character of a literate culture. Sampling the book will enable readers to return to literary texts themselves with more informed questions, and also with a greater understanding of the complexities of Canadian society and a renewed appreciation for the subtleties of the creative arts.\n\nALLEGORY.

The Encyclopedia of Literature in Canada is a resource book. It will not provide all the answers. But it opens up a multitude of\n\nx\n\nA Note on the Text The terms 'Eskimo3 and 'Indian' are used in this book whenever historical accuracy requires (as in the title of Samuel HEARNE'S work), but otherwise a variety of other terms is employed (eg, 'Inuit,' Aboriginal,' 'First Nations,' 'Native,' 'Cree,' 'Haida,' etc). Every effort has been made to ensure that the appropriate diacritical marks are used when referring to names, terms, and titles in such languages as Czech, German, Haida, and Swedish. With this principle in mind, the acute accent has been retained on the words 'Quebec' and 'Montreal' in entries for francophone writers, but these place names have been spelled without the accent when the allusion occurs within an anglophone context.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nAll reference works are indebted to the many scholars whose earlier works helped to chart the field; some of those scholars and works are mentioned in the entry here on 'Reference Guides' and elsewhere, and to them and their labours I and my colleagues in this present work are grateful. They helped us to understand our subject and our task; like them, and building on their work, we have endeavoured to bring together information and commentary that will facilitate still further the study of literature in Canada. Many individual persons have given greatly of their time and energy to help make this encyclopedia possible, and to them I am particularly grateful; to the many contributors, first of all, who with scholarly skill took on - and met - a variety of challenges: of finding out what was not yet known, of distinguishing between competing versions of'fact,' of condensing large bodies of data into readable form, and of balancing a sense of history with a sense of current concerns. I am indebted, too, to several research assistants: Peter Mahon, Mark Cochrane, Tamas Dobozy, and Rene Brisebois, together with Constantin Grigorut, Jerome Loisel, and Nancy Stevens. Their patient labours in the library and at the computer screen found 'missing' data for numerous entries, their eye for consistency and detail contributed greatly to the work as a whole, and their delight in discovery helped me maintain some degree of perspective during the compilation of the volume. It was a pleasure to work with them; it is a pleasure to thank them here. I thank, too, my many colleagues, both at the University of British Columbia and elsewhere, who generously answered questions, read draft entries, discussed the project with me, and made valuable suggestions: Carole Gerson of Simon Fraser University; Logan\n\nEsdale of the State University of New York (Buffalo); David Staines and Robert Major of the University of Ottawa; Howard Fink of Concordia University; Tom Vincent of Royal Military College; Bruce Kirkley of Fraser Valley University College; Joe Pivato of Athabasca University College; Kenneth Landry of Universite Laval; Chelva Kanaganayakam of the University of Toronto; and David Andrien, Rejean Beaudoin, Nick Bradley, Warren Cariou, Richard Cavell, Jane Flick, Richard Gooding, Sherrill Grace, Michael Greene, Gabi Helms, Iain Higgins, Joseph Jones, Andre Lamontagne, Paula Marinescu, Kevin McNeilly, Catherine NelsonMcDermott, Laurie Ricou, and Allan Smith of the University of British Columbia. Brian Henderson and Brenda Clews of Toronto provided instrumental help in the early stages of the project. Robert Bringhurst offered his wisdom and encouragement throughout, designing the special character set to go with the typeface (Dante) and helping to solve problems that at the time seemed insurmountable. Without all these people, this book would not have been possible. Valuable institutional support was supplied as well. Leone Earls of the CBC Reference Library provided data that helped to shape several entries here. Still other questions were answered by the staffs at the UBC Library; the public libraries in Victoria, Vancouver, and North Vancouver; the National Librarv of Canada; the National Archives of Canada and the Public Archives of Nova Scotia; the University of Alberta Archives; and the library at Boston University. I wish to thank all these people - and, on behalf of the contributors, also the many other national and international library staffs who contributed their expertise for their courtesy, their kindness, and their\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nefficient attention to detail. I wish also to express my appreciation to the UBC English Department, the Hampton Fund, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada for the support that gave me the time to devote to the shaping of this book; and to the Brenda and David McLean Chair in Canadian Studies at UBC, for support in aid of research and publication. The biographical data in entries on contemporary authors was checked, when possible, with the authors themselves; though questionnaires sometimes seem like an intrusion into privacy, most authors collaborated generously with the researchers, and I thank them for their kindness.\n\nxii\n\nSpecial thanks go to Shelley MacDonald, whose computer skills transformed a disparate set of texts, diskettes, e-mail messages, and handwritten memos into a coherent and consistent text; to Niroshi Sureweere for help with correspondence; and to my editors at the University of Toronto Press, Gerry Hallowell, Jill McConkey, Siobhan McMenemy, Frances Mundy, Cheryl Cohen, and Elizabeth Hulse, for their enthusiasm and their critical eye. Above all, for the countless ways in which she has encouraged me, helped find information, offered assistance, and provided sound advice, thanks go to Peggy New, with love.\n\nPermissions\n\nFor permission to quote from material in copyright, the editor and publisher express their appreciation to the following:\n\nGeorge Bowering for all quotations from his works University of Toronto Press for the material adapted from Merrill Distad's chapter in Periodicals of Queen Victoria's Empire: An Exploration, ed Rosemary Van Arsdel andj.

ABBEY, Lloyd Robert. Poet, critic, novelist; b London, ON, 4 April 1943; son of Madeleine (Ridell) and Edward Lloyd Abbey. The author of two books on Percy Bysshe Shelley, Abbey taught at U Toronto, where he earned his PhD (1971), and at U British Columbia. His strongly imagistic poetry, best represented in Selected Poems 1959-1989, examines the geology and marine life of the Pacific. He also wrote The Last Whales (1991), a novel told from the point of view of blue whales who outlive humanity. R. Gooding\n\nABLEY, Mark. Journalist, poet, travel writer, editor; b Leamington, England, 13 May 1955; son of Mary (Collins), teacher, and Harry Abley, church musician and piano teacher; emig Nov 1961. A Rhodes scholar, Abley moved frequently between England and Canada, settling in 1983 in Pointe-Claire, QC, as a freelance journalist. Beyond Forget: Rediscovering the Prairies (1986) records his personal travels back to the Saskatchewan town 'Forget' (pronounced 'forzhay'). Effectively, this book transcends the TRAVEL-WRITING genre. The double entendre of the title announces a different premise: encoded metaphors have the power to determine our attitudes to place and time. Abley's two books of poetry (Blue Sand, Blue Moon, 1988, and Glasburyon, 1994) extend this fascination with language, and his literary journalism is enhanced by a lucid style. G.N. Forst\n\nABORIGINAL writers, see FIRST NATIONS, INUIT, NATIVE, and names of individual language groups. ABSURD, a term used variously to describe (i) a logical dismissal, (2) an element in some forms of HUMOUR, or (3) a category of literary expression, derived from Albert Camus's description of the individual's condition in the modern world: that of being a stranger in an inhuman universe. Embraced by such international dramatists as Eugene lonesco and Samuel Beckett, the THEATRE of the Absurd came later to Canada; it is evident in the work of Claude\n\nGAUVREAU, Jacques LANGUIRAND, Len PETERSON, and George WALKER. Some characteristics of the Absurd in poetry, fiction, and drama include repetition, lack of explanation, narrative discontinuity, incongruity between stage set and stage action, reductive logic, and the dissolution of received forms of'standard' grammar, vocabulary, and word order. ACADEMIE CANADIENNE-FRANCAISE, an organization, based on the Academic Francaise (and, indirectly, on Plato's Academy, or School of Learning, 387 BC-AD 529), established in 1944, and devoted to fostering and defending the standards of the French LANGUAGE in North America. Its founders, led by Victor Barbeau, included Marius BARBEAU, Robert CHARBONNEAU, Robert CHOQUETTE, Marie-Claire DAVELUY, Leo-Paul DESROSIERS, Alain GRANDBOIS, and RINGUET. The academy currently has 36 seats, and it annually organizes conferences and acknowledges a body of literary work (such as that of Anne HEBERT) that it considers to be of superior quality. It changed its name in 1992 to L'Academie des lettres du Quebec. Jean ROYER wrote its history. ACADIAN WRITING. Modern and contemporary Acadian literature ranges from fiction, poetry, and drama emphasizing regional, ethnic, and linguistic characteristics associated with Acadian identity to writing influenced by contemporary trends such as POSTMODERNISM and revealing a more cosmopolitan allegiance to the global North American and Canadian francophonic. For a long time Acadian writing could be compared to Irish or Quebec literature to the extent that it benefited from the rich ORAL tradition of a small, fairly homogeneous, and largely rural population, and to the extent that this heritage was supplemented by the NATIONALIST, conservative college dassique education offered to the elites by the Catholic Church until the 19805. What is specific to earlier Acadian writing, notably as it emerged in the i9th century, is the impact and memory of the deportation of the Acadians in 1755-60 from what is now Nova Scotia, their subsequent return in the 17603 and 17708, and their scattered settlement, mostly in what is now New Brunswick. In particular, the\n\n3\n\nACADIAN WRITING\n\ndramatization of these events in the American Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's epic poem EVANGELINE (1847) and its broad circulation in the form of Pamphile LEMAY'S French translation (1865) - which every schoolchild learned by heart - contributed to prevailing definitions of Acadian writing. Inevitably, most Acadian writing of this period reveals a strong sense of place as well as of history, not least because in the 150 years between colonization and the identityconsolidating trauma of the Deportation, Acadian culture developed and thrived in relative isolation - 'benign neglect' is the term often used - from its European roots and its sister colony in NEW FRANCE. With France's rediscovery of Acadie through the works of the visiting French historian Edme Rameau de Saint-Pere (La France aux colonies: acadiens et canadiens, 1859), Acadian writers and scholars found new sources of inspiration for social and cultural reforms, while the founding of newspapers such as Le Moniteur acadien (est 1867) and L'Evangeline (est 1887) created venues for debate on the survival and re-emergence (or construction) of Acadian identity. Three themes emerge from the early stage of Acadian writing, which lasted until the late i9th century and arguably until the Second World War, if not later. Especially prevalent is the PASTORAL theme of a paradise lost, an ELEGY for the mythical pays de cocagne, the Arcadian golden age associated with the prelapsarian Nova Scotian LANDSCAPE of the Annapolis Valley and Minas Basin at the head of the Bay of Fundy. Poetry and fiction are its main vehicles, newspapers and local printers its sponsors. Secondly, the struggle for French-language education rights, then defined in denominational terms, particularly in the wake of the Caraquet Riots of 1875, led to DRAMA, published speeches, ESSAYS, and journalism in support of a politically defined sense of Acadian identity. Jules Boudreau and Calixte DUGUAY'S musical play Louis Mailloux (1975), about the riots and produced in Caraquet, addresses this legacy. The proceedings of the Acadian national conventions (held more or less annually after 1881) provide another focus for nationalist discourse, productively analyzed by Jean-Paid Hautecoeur in L'Acadie du discours (1975). Finally, during what became known as the Acadian Renaissance of\n\n4\n\nthe 18805, Acadian writing at once looked forward to a glorious future and indulged in a cheerful nostalgia for the naive art of the folk, as expressed in the LOCAL COLOUR sketch and the transcription of legend, genres that joined ranks with other literary forms. However, Iate-i9thcentury Acadian writing blends such romantic, social-political, and REGIONALIST concerns; thematic and generic boundaries are fairly fluid. Typically, for example, the contributions of Marichette (Emilie Leblanc), published in L'Evangeline in the 18905 and edited as a book in 1982, prefigure the tongue-in-cheek humour of Antonine MAILLET and Viola Leger's famous personnage in La sagouine. Bridging the genres of theatre and monologue, the latter melding the POPULAR traditions of the raconteur, and the impersonator or stand-up COMIC, La sagouine (1970) has sometimes single-handedly borne the burden of representing Acadian identity, while also addressing important questions concerning education, politics, culture, language, religion, and social reform. Partly because of her spectacular international career, culminating in the awarding of France's prestigious Prix Goncourt to her novel Pelagie-la-Charrette (1979), Maillet also seems single-handedly to bridge the colonial and postmodern eras in Acadian writing. Contiguous with her prodigious output, the 19705 witnessed a broader cultural phenomenon sometimes referred to as the second Acadian Renaissance, which was characterized by the creation and expansion of publicly funded French-language post-secondary institutions such as U Moncton; new federal, provincial, and local community development initiatives; official bilingualism in the province of New Brunswick as of 1969; the emergence of Acadian publishers, most notably Editions de 1'Acadie in 1972; and the creation of the Acadian regional production office of the NATIONAL FILM BOARD in 1974. An Acadian literary renaissance, particularly in poetry, MUSIC, and film, accompanied these various social and cultural developments, and Maillet's work offers one significant point of reference for this period's effervescent literary nationalism. To the extent that such comparisons are valid, her La sagouine, published the same year as her PhD dissertation on Rabelais and Acadian popular traditions, could be said to have had the impact\n\nACADIAN WRITING\n\non Acadian society that Michel TREMBLAY'S Les belles soeurs had in Quebec during that province's QUIET REVOLUTION.\n\nAlthough Acadian drama is not devoid of interest, it is in the genre of poetry that the 19705 witnessed seminal work, notably Raymond LEBLANC'S Cri dc terre (1972), Leonard Forest's Saisons anterieures (1973), Hermenegilde CHIASSON'S Mourir a Scoudouc and Ronald DESPRES'S Paysages en contrebande (both 1973), and Calixte Duguay's Les stigmates du silence (1975). Created largely by young men, this wave of poetry defiantly and eloquently broke the silence of inner exile. Probably Guy Arsenault (Acadie Rock, 1973) is the most defiant of this generation; his use of both French and English, his lack of reverence for Acadian cultural elites and for the influence of Catholicism on culture and education, and his allusions to popular music all are consistent with one set of trends in both popular and avant-garde Acadian writing. Acadian poetry of the 19703 cannot be discussed without reference to chansonniers and FOLK-rock groups. The former include Donat Lacroix (Viens voir I'Acadie, 1974), Calixte Duguay (Aboiteaux, 1976), Angele Arsenault (Libre, 1979), and the multifaceted and prolific Edith BUTLER. The two best-known rock groups are 1755 (1976-88) and Beausoleil-Broussard (1976-82); the former's name and first album both allude to the Deportation, the latter's name to Captain Joseph Broussard, who transported many Acadians to Louisiana and the French Caribbean, and whose ship - according to legend - was stolen from the British fleet that had deported the Acadians. On the whole, the poetry of the 19705, in its admixture of Acadian and standard French expressions and rhythms - its cadence and grammar of imagery inspired by the sea - gave voice to the quest for belonging, the love of the land, the mixed blessing of the Catholic religion as intellectual legacy, and the love-hate relation with the evocative eternal feminine associated with home and family. One of the recurring themes of Acadian writing in the modern era was its relation with the outside world, particularly with Quebec, both as the acknowledged heartland of the French LANGUAGE and culture in North America and as the ambiguous seedbed of a more politically oriented francophone nationalism. In 1969, on\n\nthe heels of the creation in 1968 of a Centre for Acadian Studies at U Moncton, a cultural cooperation agreement was signed by the provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec, a move initiated by the latter. While certain artists (such as the poet, dramatist, artist, and filmmaker Hermenegilde Chiasson) always adamantly both lived and worked in their native province, others (notably Antonine Maillet) more or less of necessity published, studied, and worked elsewhere, often in Montreal. If there is a tendency for European and Quebec-based writers, critics, and journalists to identify Acadian writers as Quebecois, some Acadian writers in fact chose such an affiliation. Among them, Jacques SAVOIE, author of the Quebec novel Les portes tournantes (1984), is one of the most gifted. Yet in the late 19705 he surfaced as one of the most important and promising young Acadian writers and musicians, associated with the folk-rock group Beausoleil-Broussard. His novel Racontemoi Massabielle (1979), published the same year as an NFB film about the creation of Kouchibougouac Park, uses as its imaginative point of departure the expropriation of Acadian citizens' property during the park's creation. The year 1979 also saw the publication of Maillet's Pelagic and Claude LE BOUTHILLIER'S Isabelle-sur-mer, set in a not-too-distant future where the northeastern Acadian peninsula of New Brunswick remains one of the few corners of the world untouched by a global environmental holocaust. Louis Hache's novel Adieu, P'tit Chipagan (1978), more quietly elegiac, is set in an indeterminate past on the Island of Miscou and evokes the passage of traditional ways of subsisting on land and sea. Also in the 19705, Nova Scotia-based author Germaine Comeau produced poetry, fiction, and drama of a more low-key nature, abjuring both UTOPIA and apocalypse, and giving voice to a feminine and FEMINIST sensibility. All these texts emphasize the Acadian relation to place, underscoring the shifting boundaries of bioregional and global forces and recontextualizing the themes of EXILE and homecoming. In this context one very influential non-fiction work of 1978 stands out for its poetic, philosophical treatment of emerging relations with global francophonie and the Quebec state, debating the lesser of the evils, given a real and ongoing sense of loss: Michel\n\n5\n\nACADIAN WRITING\n\nRoy's book-length essay L'Acadie perdue. The emergence of Roch Voisine as a rock star beyond the borders of Acadie (not unlike that of Celine Dion as a diva from Quebec) underscores the necessity and difficulty of bridging the gap between traditional Acadian culture and globalization. Throughout the 19705 and 198 os Antonine Maillet remained one of the most prolific authors, producing a steady stream - indeed, an ocean - of NOVELLAS, novels, plays, and nonfiction, so much so that in the eyes of many, especially in Europe, her name is synonymous with Acadian writing. Certainly, she is the most stellar practitioner of an important tradition within Acadian literature, one that she invented virtually single-handedly; and she has countless admirers for whom the Acadian theme park Le Pays de la Sagouine in Bouctouche, NB, confirms the status of her writings as a living folk museum. At its best her style is reminiscent of the fabulation of an Italo Calvino or a Salman Rushdie - parodying an archaic narrative style, voice, structure, and point of view and undermining its own authority and status as EPIC, while affirming a specifically Acadian content and approach to literary experimentation. Maillet's work is characterized by an earthy, irreverent effervescence that is feminist within the DOCUMENTARY fantasy mode. Predominant influences on her work include the language of Rabelais in Gargantua and Pantagruel and that of Acadian folk culture. The latter emerged as a central focus for Acadian Studies at U Moncton at the time, leading to important masters' and doctoral work by Charlotte Cormier (traditional music), Lauraine Leger (popular sanctions), Catherine Jolicoeur (legends), and Ronald Labelle and others (popular medicine, the oral tradition, etc). Maillet's own PhD thesis, 'Rabelais et les traditions populaires acadiennes' (1971), completed at U Laval, inspired many of these studies. Perhaps because of her very success, which in Europe sometimes reinforced prevailing notions of Acadian (and French North American) archaism - not unlike one strain within the German idealized notion of Canada's FIRST NATIONS many younger Acadian writers strive for a different style of writing, avoiding her influence in their work. Maillet's fondness for linguistics\n\n6\n\nand folklore (however theoretically sophisticated and indebted to Mikhail Bakhtin, the Russian theoretician of the carnivalesque), her preoccupation with the status of MYTH and HISTORY, her signature style, and her prolixity led in the 19905, for instance, to density, sparseness, and a radically different kind of POSTMODERN experimentation in the works of France DAIGLE and Jean Babineau. Babineau is the most controversial and least known of these two very different writers; his novel Bloupe (1993) is the Joycean analogue for a new generation of writers and songsters who marry various registers of French and English in literature focused on Moncton and influenced by both mass culture and literary THEORY. One of the most promising practitioners of this newly international Acadian writing is France Daigle. Her many novels and novellas, such as Films d'amour et de dependance: Chef-d'oeuvre obscur (1984), La vraie vie (1993), and especially 1953: Chronique d'une naissance annoncee (1995), are seen as mature - proof of the new Acadian writing's confidence, urbane, understated, grounded in its region, and open to the world. As with Jacques Savoie, cinema, human sexuality and love, the legacy of books and ideas, and especially language and desire influence and shape Daigle's oeuvre both formally and thematically. The postmodern and even POSTCOLONIAL dimensions of this new writing are characteristic of the younger generation who came of age in Acadie in the 19905; its popular dimension is the often bilingual Acadian FRINGE theatre, PERFORMANCE art, poetry, and music that coexists with more traditional Acadian writing in the cultural life of Moncton as the self-styled Acadian cultural capital. Postnationalist, heterogeneous, often feminist in its sympathies, contemporary Acadian identity constructs itself as contested - on contested terrain. The social is not absent so much as redefined in keeping within de siecle definitions of the body politic. It is less easy than it once was to detect leitmotifs in Acadian writing, whether the recurring imagery be the sea or any other element in the Acadian literary landscape. However, in keeping with the fact that - to paraphrase Antonine Maillet - the birth of Acadian identity in the i8th century was far from virginal (despite the 19th-century choice of the Catholic\n\nACORN\n\nVirgin Mary and the Feast of the Assumption as Acadian patron saint and national holiday), HYBRIDITY and migratory writing (I'ecriture de I'errance) characterize much late-2oth-century Acadian writing. Thus the CANON of Acadian fiction must include the Acadian-oriented works within Quebecois writer Jacques PERRON'S oeuvre, especially his novel Les roses sauvages (1971), one of the more interesting examples of a long succession of Acadian-inspired works by Quebec authors. Cross-currents with Cajun culture - an example being the New Brunswickinfluenced Cajun zydeco music of Zacharie Richard's Cap Enrage (1998), a compact disc extremely popular in Quebec - and links with North American francophonie in general, both past and present, still leave much room for future literary CRITICISM, attesting to the richness of Acadian culture and writing. More controversial but no less worthy of critical attention is literary work by writers of Acadian ethnic origin who write in English, such as Clive Doucet, whose linked short stories in The Priest's Boy (1992) are set in Cape Breton and address the familiar Maritime theme of 'going down the road,' underscoring the need for comparative perspectives on Acadian writing. The need for such perspectives seems implicit in the AFRICAN, Aboriginal, and Acadian mix denoted by the term Africadian,' coined by African Nova Scotian poet and critic George Elliott CLARKE. It is to be hoped that some of this comparative research will be published in the French language, but also that some of its insights will circulate not only within but also beyond the Acadian literary community. Michele Lacombe\n\nACLAND, Peregrine Palmer. Army officer, historical novelist; b England 1891, d Toronto 6 May 1963; son of F.A. Acland, federal king's printer; educ at Upper Canada C and U Toronto. After being wounded at the Somme, Major Acland was a master at Groton School for Boys in Massachusetts. A sometime resident of Montreal and New York, he wrote All Else Is Folly: A Tale of War and Passion (1929), which includes a 'Note by way of Preface' by Ford Madox Ford. The novel's protagonist, Falcon, is a Canadian who longs for military adventure in Europe; he returns to Canada from overseas combat after a\n\ndisfiguring injury. Ford endorsed the novel less as a literary achievement than as a realistic account of an ordinary man's sufferings in the First World War and as a distinctly colonial statement of the horrors of WAR. Deborah Blenkhorn\n\nACORN, Milton James Rhode. Poet; b Charlottetown 30 March 1923, d Charlottetown 20 Aug 1986; son of Helen (Carbonell) and Robert Acorn, a civil servant. Milton Acorn was one of the most individualistic writers that Canada produced. He combined a restless spirit, a fierce romanticism, and a lifelong commitment to Communism with a deep love for his native country. Although he came from a middleCLASS background, he constructed a workingclass persona that contributed to the myths he made about himself, including his claim to have a steel plate in his head; during an attack by German U-boats on his troop ship in the Atlantic en route to Europe during the Second World War, he received a head injury that required an operation. The hospital where he was convalescing was also bombed, and these psychological stresses led to his discharge in 1943 and eventually to a disability pension and several periods of institutionalization later in life for depression and alcoholism. After the war Acorn trained as a carpenter, but later sold his tools in a symbolic gesture, choosing the 'trade' of poetry. In Montreal in 1949 he met and was influenced by the group of poets, including Louis DUDEK and Irving LAYTON, who were at the centre of MODERNISM in Canadian poetry. With Al PURDY he began publishing the little magazine Moment, which continued for seven issues. In Toronto he was briefly married to the poet Gwendolyn MACEWEN in the 19605, and while in Vancouver, he co-founded the alternative newspaper The Georgia Straight in 1967. Suffering from ill health, he returned to Prince Edward Island in 1981. Acorn published numerous books of poetry, including his first, In Love and Anger (privately printed, 1956), The Brains the Target (1960), Jawbreakers (1963), and a selection of fifty-eight poems in a special issue ofFiddlehead in 1963. His early poetry developed rapidly in style from a metrically regular, romantic lyricism to experiments with free verse and a clear expression of\n\n7\n\nACORN\n\nhis socialist politics. His first major collection was I've Tasted My Blood: Poems 1956-1968 (1969), for which he received acclaim, and when he did not win the Governor General's AWARD for Poetry, his fellow poets created the Canadian Poetry Award for him, naming him 'The People's Poet,' a title he proudly claimed for the rest of his career. This volume contains some of his best-known poems, including the title poem, 'I Shout Love,' 'The Natural History of Elephants,' 'Knowing I Live In a Dark Age,' and several of his best imagist lyrics, such as 'Charlottetown Harbour' and 'The Island.' Selected and with an introduction by Al Purdy, it established his reputation as one of Canada's major poets. The Island Means Minago (1975), a retelling of Prince Edward Island history in poetry and prose, won the Governor General's Award for Poetry in 1975. Injackpine Sonnets (1977), named for the resilient tree that survives and thrives in harsh elements, Acorn continued to experiment with the SONNET, a form that he felt lent itself to dialectical arguments and MARXIST political theory, which he expresses in his poems as a play of opposing forces, such as the tension between love and anger. He wanted his poetry to be accessible to everyone, and under the influence of the American poet Charles Olson's theories of'projective verse' (see BLACK MOUNTAIN), he experimented with poetry that was meant to be read aloud. He was a popular reader and influenced a younger generation of poets through his appearances at the Bohemian Embassy in Toronto in the 19605. His last major collection, Dig Up My Heart: Selected Poems 1952$3 (1983), reprints many of his best poems from earlier volumes. There have been several posthumously published collections, ed James Deahl. See also M. FAIRLEY, R.

After studying at U Montreal and U Toulouse, Acquelin worked as a journalist for Radio-Canada and wrote for the periodicals Dixit and Vice Versa. In her first volume of poetry, Tout va rien (1987), she developed an elliptical style through which to examine the relations between solitude and the environment, metaphors for the human condition. She continues these inquiries both in poetry (Chien d'agur, 1992) and in CRITICISM (Cite ouverte, 1994) on marginality.

Editor, publisher; b Scotland 25 May 1839, d New York 30 Oct 1912. After emigrating to Canada in 1858, Adam rapidly became involved in Toronto PUBLISHING and JOURNALISM. As a partner in Rollo & Adam and Adam, Stevenson, & Co, the firms that respectively produced the British American Magazine (1863-4) and the Canadian Monthly &â¢ National R (1872-8; with Goldwin SMITH), he actively encouraged Canadian writing and himself edited the latter JOURNAL (1879-82) after it merged with Belford's to become Rose-Belford's Canadian Monthly and National R. He was also involved in American publishing ventures (with John LOVELL). He opposed current COPYRIGHT legislation, contributing numerous articles to the trade journal Canadian Bookseller and to such NEWSPAPERS as the Week, the Globe, and the Mail. In 1863 Adam married Jane Beazley, the daughter of John Gibson, who had edited the long-lasting Literary Garland, and seven years after her death in 1884 he married Frances Isabel Brown. His own literary career was confined to a few poems and (in collaboration with Ethelwyn WETHERALD) a romance about early UPPER CANADA, An Algonquin Maiden (1886). In 1892 he emigrated to the UNITED STATES, where he\n\nAFRICA IN CANADIAN WRITING\n\nedited the Chicago journal Self-Help and wrote about such subjects as the American Civil WAR. ADAMS, Levi. Lawyer, poet; b c 17 March 1802, possibly in Henryville, QC, d Montreal 21 June 1832. Little is known of his life except that he articled in Montreal and, while still a student, published two stories in the Canadian Magazine (1825), one of them about the WAR of 1812, and a long poem, Jean Baptiste (1828), a comic love story told in 160 Byronic, mock-heroic stanzas, which comments in passing on current Montreal fashions and political attitudes. Adams was admitted to the bar in 1827 and married Elizabeth Wright of Northampton, MA, in 1830; within two days of each other, they both died of cholera in 1832, leaving a three-week-old son. See also LONGMORE. ADDERSON, Caroline. Short fiction writer, teacher; b Edmonton, AB, 9 Sept 1963; daughter of Bernice (Goodfellow), homemaker, and Neil Adderson, engineer. After being raised in Sherwood Park, Adderson entered the Katimavik youth program and travelled across Canada. Six years after completing a degree in education at U British Columbia in 1982, she settled in Vancouver and began teaching ESL at Langara C. Her celebrated first book of short fiction, Bad Imaginings (1993), won the Ethel Wilson Fiction Prize and in audio format was chosen the CNIB Talking Book of the Year. The ten darkly humorous stories that make up the volume, set largely in British Columbia, sometimes depict domestic situations (marital strife, divorce, death, emotional instability). Stylistically, however, Adderson experiments with polyvocality, shifting points of view with poise and composed irony. A History of Forgetting (1999) tells of Alzheimer's disease, the Holocaust (see JEWISH), and the importance of memory as a means to avoid marginalization. See also METCALF. G.N. Forst\n\nADENEY, Marcus. Poet, novelist, musician; b London, England, i July 1900. Adeney grew up in Paris, ON, and after studying the cello in the United States and Europe, he joined the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and the faculty of the Royal Conservatory of Music. His classically formal poetry, published in various periodicals\n\nin the 19305 and 19405, is often elegaic in tone, but with an underlying sense of confidence in human intellectual and cultural potential. His novel New Babylon, written 1929-30 but not published until 1991, is a BILDUNGSROMAN in which the protagonist comes to political consciousness in the years preceding the First World War. James Doyle\n\nAFRICA IN CANADIAN WRITING. Africa, imaged as 'the dark continent,' has long persisted in the European consciousness as a nonChristian 'other,' featuring strange customs, savage rites, and no written history. Imaginary Africas persist in Canadian writing, although now more often transformed into whatever symbol or politic the non-travelling author wishes to project onto them. Hugh HOOD'S You Can't Get Therefrom Here (1972) presents the dilemmas facing a new African nation state; the tone is ironic, the African experiment presented as doomed. By contrast, M. Nourbese PHILIP'S Lookingfor Livingstone (1991) imagines a mythic place with its own communal and spiritual strengths, in counter-discourse to traditional disparaging representations of Africa. Three Quebec writers also use Africa for their novels' own political purposes: Jacques GODBOUT'S L'aquarium (1962), Hubert AQUIN'S Trou de memoire (1968; tr Alan Brown as Blackout), and Jacques PERRON'S Le Saint-Elias (1972; tr Pierre Cloutier as The Saint-Elias). Here it will be more informative to chart historically the progress of representations of Africa by those who have actually visited or lived there: travellers, sojourners, and citizens. A fairly representative account of early missionary attitudes is exemplified by Walter Inglis (Memoirs and Remains of the Reverend Walter Inglis, African Missionary and Canadian Pastor, ed Rev Wm. Cochrane, 1887). Inglis, while deploring Africans' belief in the power of fetishes, spirit possession, and the nearness to them of the spirits of the dead, equally abhorred slavery. Upon his petitioning the Volksraad about child enslavement in the 18505, he was charged with high treason and expelled from South Africa. At the turn of the century, Canada sent regiments to assist the British in their WAR against the Boers in South Africa. Many contemporary accounts painted vivid pictures of the Canadian\n\n9\n\nAFRICA IN CANADIAN WRITING\n\ncampaigns and the experiences of the soldiers: Stanley KcKeown Brown's With the Royal Canadians (1900), T.G. Marquis's Canada's Sons on Kopje and Veldt: A Historical Account of the Canadian Contingents (1900), and W. Hart-McHarg's From Quebec to Pretoria with the Royal Canadian Regiment (1902) are a few. Carman Miller's Painting the Map Red: Canada and the South African War, 1899-1902 (1993) is the best comprehensive study of Canada's participation in that war. The soldiers began with nationalistic feelings about the 'mother country' that, as they suffered losses in battles, heat and cold, sand storms, thirst, enteric fever, and long stretches of boredom interrupted by forced marches, gradually dissolved into a desire to return home. More enjoyable by far were the experiences of the groups of young women teachers who departed Canada for the camps at the end of the war. Florence Hamilton Randal (LIVESAY) sent back her accounts to the Ottawa Journal in 1902 (qtd in Sandra Gwyn, The Private Capital, 1984). These described the 50,000 Boer children in need of schooling, the gradual transformation of the concentration camps to refugee shelters as Boer families were reunited, and the pleasantries of social life with the British and Canadian officers. E. Maud Graham's A Canadian Girl in South Africa (1905) reveals an equally sprightly and pro-British attitude. Graham also disparages both Boers and 'kaffirs.' TRAVEL descriptions by tourists range widely in their responses to Africa. Some explore the unknown as exotic, some find the climate unwholesome, and others project onto a particular locale the writer's deepest desires or promote a whole country as deserving better understanding. Alice JONES'S vignettes, published in the Week (1892 and 1895), chronicle her shopping and sightseeing adventures in Algeria and Egypt. She combines enthusiastic descriptions of scenery, ancient artefacts, and colourful markets with distrust of the local people and disdain for 'the bondage of Mohammedanism.' Later accounts of travel in North Africa also reveal the authors' attitudes. The narrator of A.M. KLEIN'S 'Casablanca' (The Second Scroll, 1951) abandons his poetic celebration of the song, food, and art of the city when he sees the impoverished, unsanitary Mellah, the Jewish slum. Panic bordering on terror of the ancient\n\n10\n\nand the unknown combines with heat and airlessness in Ethel WILSON'S 'Egypt' (Mrs. Golightly and Other Stories, 1961). The discomforts and dirt confronting a Canadian family contrast with the hippie life led in Marrakesh by an international group of young people in Kildare DOBBS'S 'Morocco' (in Dobbs, ed, Away from Home: Canadian Writers in Exotic Places, 1985). Alberto MANGUEL'S 'The Painted Desert' (in George GALT, ed, The Saturday Night Traveller, 1990) scorches the reader with its description of the heat of the Algerian Sahara on its way to describing the eight-thousand-year-old cave paintings of Jassili. Scott SYMONS'S novel Helmet of Flesh (1986) follows a Canadian homosexual man's quest for sexual and spiritual unity in Marrakesh. Here place equals a long-sought quality of mind. Paul William Roberts's travel narrative River in the Desert: Modern Travels in Ancient Egypt (1993) likewise advocates knowledge of another place and spirit. The author's enthusiasm is contagious; unfortunately, he refers to the rest of Africa as the 'dark continent' that surrounds Egypt. Two books published in 1998 extend these themes: Christopher Ondaatje's Journey to the Source of the Nile tracks the travels of Sir Richard Burton and John Speke to find the headwaters of that river. Sharon BUTALA'S novel The Garden of Eden (1998) uses her observations of famine in Ethiopia to argue for preservation of the world's grasslands and for biodiversity. Jacques HEBERT offers a sustained investigation into many parts of Africa in Autour de I'Afrique (2 vols, 1950) and Nouvelle aventure en Afrique (2 vols, 1953). Alert and thoughtful, he is self-aware about his relative lack of sympathy for Islam, and he allows his romantic expectations and the thrill of adventure to be tempered by actual experience. A number of Canadian writers have spent time as sojourners in Africa, usually while teaching. Dorothy LIVESAY's Collected Poems (1972) includes 'The Second Language (Suite),' in which she comments on the difficulties of understanding another culture, in this case Zambia's. Dave GODFREY'S novel The New Ancestors (1970) is a postmodern, multi-narrated condemnation of postcolonial politics and corruption in Ghana. Audrey THOMAS wrote several novels based on her stay in that country. In the postmodernist Mrs. Blood (1970) the female protagonist understands that her Africa\n\nAFRICA IN CANADIAN WRITING\n\nis real only for her. Blown Figures (1974) is more surreal, returning Isobel to Africa to seek the causes of her life's failures. Various short stories by Thomas in Ladies and Escorts (1977), Real Mothers (1981), and Goodbye Harold, Good Luck (1986) also revisit the African experience, but more realistically and ironically, as does her novel Coming Down from Wa (1995). David KNIGHT'S novel Farquharson's Physique and What It Did to His Mind (1981) explores the failing marriage of an expatriate teacher in Nigeria against the backdrop of the first year of the Nigerian War. In his volume of poems The Army Does Not Go Away (1969), Knight is an observer, sadly aware of protests, murders, and waste. J.C. Cairns shows more involvement in 'Tanganyika,' from his Bush and Boma (1959; rpt in Dobbs's Away from Home). A Canadian district officer under the British, he concerns himself with the famine, struggling to arrange transportation of foodstuffs from one district to another one more in need. Margaret LAURENCE'S engagement with Africa is similar to Cairns's. Accompanying her engineer husband, she lived from 1951 to 1957 in Somaliland and the Gold Coast (later Ghana). She collected, translated, and paraphrased Somali poems and folk tales, publishing them in A Tree for Poverty (1954), the first printed version of what was then an entirely ORAL language. The Prophet's Camel Bell (1963) is Laurence's memoir of her year in Somaliland. Here she questions her own understanding when confronted with behaviour foreign to her. Her first novel, This Side Jordan (1960), set in modern Ghana, centres on the conflict in outlook between Europeans and Africans in a country about to become independent. In that novel, as in The Tomorrow-Tamer and Other Stories (1963), her understanding of personal struggle applies to Africans as well as to Europeans. Long Drums and Cannons: Nigerian Dramatists and Novelists, 1952-1966 (1968) places the works of eleven writers in the context of Nigeria's history and culture and its traditional music and drama. Heart of a Stranger (1976), a volume of Laurence's autobiographical essays, includes several reflections upon Africa and the life story of the Somali nationalist leader Mohammed Abdille Hasan. Neither strangers nor citizens, some Canadian writers of African descent have made an\n\nattempt to return to the land of their ancestors. Claire HARRIS, in Travelling to Find a Remedy (1986), tracks the narrator's love for a Nigerian man. But she discovers that the real barrier between them is the difference between the Western and African expectations of marriage. Damien Lopes (in poems published in Westcoast 22 [31/1, Spring/Summer 1997], North: New African Canadian Writing) journeys back to Kenya and Uganda, from which his relatives had fled. The visitors feel like Canadians, but the East Africans view them as compatriots. Lawrence Hill, in Some Great Thing (1992) and Any Known Blood (1997), dispatches his characters to Cameroon and Mali. These journeys ironically counterpoint events in Canada and the United States. Finally, former citizens of various African countries have made vigorous contributions to Canadian writing, representing their homelands out of long intimacy with their customs, language, and politics. All the former South Africans write about the cruel politics of apartheid. John Peter's novel Along That Coast (1964) evokes the beauty of the place, together with the futility of pursuing personal relationships there; Arthur Nortje's Dead Roots: Poems (1973) wrings out the themes of violence in nature and the social order, of anger and pity for his country; Jeni COUZYN'S Life by Drowning: Selected Poems (1983) shows how South Africa's violence can become internalized as a pattern of anxiety; Ernst HAVEMANN'S Bloodsong and Other Stories of South Africa (1987) describes farm life in the veldt and relations between blacks and whites; Reshard COOL'S novel Cape Town Coolie (1990) tracks the tragic career of an Indian lawyer caught up in the sexual and political conflicts of the apartheid years; Rayda Jacobs's The Middle Children: Stories (1994) draws a composite portrait of the people of Cape Town, the complexities of living as a mixed-race person there, and the dislocations of living in Canada; and Archie Grail's play Exile (1990) and The Bonus Deal (1992), a collection of short stories, examine the bitter personal cost both of open struggle against oppression at home and of attempts to form new alliances in Canada. Works by former Africans from countries other than South Africa range widely in topic and style. Jane Tapsubei Creider's Two Lives: My\n\nii\n\nAFRICA IN CANADIAN WRITING\n\nSpirit and I (1986) is an imaginative autobiography in which the narrator's spirit self lives in the past with her tribe in Kenya. Miguna Miguna's Toes Have Tales (1995), on the other hand, is a nightmarish, surreal expose of Kenyan political injustice and Canadian racism. George Seremba's one-man play Come Good Rain (1993) explains how he survived after being arrested in Uganda, mixing standard English narrative with Ugandan songs, announcements, and common speech. Maguy Kabamba's novel Le dette colonniale (1995), set in post-independence Zaire, articulates the problems of that generation, adrift whether at home or in Europe. Paul Tiyambe Zeleza, in his early Night of Darkness and Other Stories (1976), draws an insider's picture of common events in the lives of Zimbabwean people. His later novel, Smouldering Charcoal (1992), details political corruption and violence in a newly independent country. Zeleza's The Joys of Exile: Stories (1994) often takes the long historical view, moving from realism into a mythic consciousness of repetitive, meaningless violence, and human suffering and loss. Four books by M.G. VASSANJI, formerly of Tanzania, explore the fortunes of the Shamsi community of Dar es Salaam. No New Land (1991) is a comedic treatment of an exiled community experiencing deracination, prejudice, and new beginnings in Toronto. The Gunny Sack (1989), Uhuru Street: Stories (1991), and The Book of Secrets (1994) are interrelated both through some characters they share and through the author's view of history as a subterranean connectedness of people and stories across time and place that underlies change and exile.

Clergyman, ethnographer; b Sandy Lake, SK, n June 1885, d Canora, MB, summer 1961; son of Ellen (Ermine Skin) and Baptiste Ahenakew. An Anglican missionary among his own Plains CREE people in the Diocese of Saskatchewan, Ahenakew collaborated with H.C. Wolfart on a Cree-English dictionary (1999) and published a monthly bulletin for Cree speakers. His foremost literary monument is Voices of the Plains Cree, published posthumously in 1973 (rpt 1995, with foreword by Stan\n\n12\n\nCuthand). This work includes traditional tales collected from Chief Thunderchild (Peyasiwawasis) in 1923, and 'Old Keyam,' in which a fictional narrator, Keyam (Cree for 'I do not care') meditates on the changing world of his people. Keyam's cagey 'indifference' represents Ahenakew's vision of his culture's defensive assumption of a defeatist demeanour while tacitly enduring and renewing itself. John Moffatt\n\nAHENAKEW, Freda. Cree linguist, author, editor, professor (retired), OC; b Atahkakohp, SK, ii Feb 1932; daughter of Annie (Bird) and Edward Ahenakew, soldier and farmer. Ahenakew holds a BEd (U Saskatchewan), an MA (U Manitoba), and an honorary LLD (U Saskatchewan). Among her twenty books are verbatim CREE transcripts and syllabic and English translations of stories told to her by Cree storytellers. Notable among them are kohkominawak otdcimowinawawa (Our Grandmothers' Lives, as Told in Their Own Words) and kwayask e-ki-pekiskinowdpahtihicik (Their Example Showed Me the Way: A Cree Woman's Life Shaped by Two Cultures), which won the 1988 Alberta Book AWARD for scholarly book of the year. Ahenakew's Cree translations depict life in Canada before and during colonization. The grandniothers' stories are distinctive for the flavour they retain from their original tongue. This characteristic is in large part the result of Ahenakew's accuracy and skill as a linguist.

He published his first novel, La retrospection, in 1977; like all his work, it examines the\n\nALFORD\n\ncharacter of memory. Of his later works, the AWARD-winning collection of short stories Jerome et les mots (1980), a volume of prose poems, Petits formats (1987), a novel, Comme un lievrepris au piege (1992), and a volume of lyrics, Parfois meme le beaute (1993), received favourable notice for their discovery of the magic in everyday life and their creation of a place with which people could identify. Margaret Cook\n\nALBERTA, province; joined CONFEDERATION 1905; capital, Edmonton, incorporated 1892, on the site of Fort Edmonton, est 1795; area 661,185 sq km (255,217 sq miles); 2001 pop 2,974,807, over 70 per cent of whom live in urban centres, primarily the capital and Calgary; provincial flower, wild rose. Explored by Anthony HENDAY, Peter POND, Alexander MACKENZIE, Peter FIDLER, and David THOMPSON in the i8th century, the territory was occupied by Blackfoot, Blood, and Peigan peoples in the south (see ALGONQUIAN) and by CREE, Slavey, and Beaver peoples in the north (see also NORTHERN ATHAPASKAN). The HUDSON'S BAY and North West Companies established trading posts in the later i8th century, claiming the land until it became part of Canada's NORTHWEST TERRITORIES in 1870 (Districts of Alberta, in the south, and Athabaska, in the north). Treaties were signed with the Native population between 1876 and 1889, and the Dominion Lands Act (1872) opened up the territory for agricultural settlement. Waves of immigrants from Europe and the United States (including substantial Ukrainian, Hutterite, and Mormon communities) moved there during the 18905. Alberta (named for Queen Victoria's daughter, Princess Louise Caroline Alberta, in 1882) became a province in 1905 when the territories were subdivided. Its substantial petroleum resources, developed after the Leduc field was found in 1947, increasingly gave the province economic power in Canada. It has a history of conservative political thought. Alberta writers include Georges BUGNET, Maria CAMPBELL, Joan CRATE, Bob EDWARDS, Hiromi GOTO, Claire HARRIS, Greg HOLLINGSHEAD, Myrna KOSTASH, Henry KREISEL, w.o.

In a dozen books written for CHILDREN, Alderson addresses a range of ages and subjects and works in several genres, from the novel (The Not Impossible Summer, 1983) to the narrative poem (Ten Mondays for Lots of Boxes, 1995). She is best known for her realistic but humorous treatment of family in Bonnie McSmithers, You're Driving Me Dithers (1974), with sequels about Bonnie and her mother (1977, 1979), and for her sensitive picture books. These treat children in natural or rural settings, as in Wherever Bears Be (1999). Alderson often highlights a child protagonist's capacity to help, a theme developed in Ida and the Wool Smugglers (1987) or Sure as Strawberries (1992). Jane Flick\n\nALFORD, Edna. Short story writer, editor; b 19 Nov 1947, Turtleford, SK; daughter of Edith (Robbestad), hairdresser and beautician, and Robert Sample, carpenter, cabinetmaker. Alford published two collections of short stories A Sleep Full of Dreams (1981) and The Garden of Eloise Loon (1986) - and edited, with Claire HARRIS, Kitchen Talk: Contemporary Women's Prose and Poetry (1992). Her stories often address the marginalization experienced by, for example, women and the elderly, as well as that perpetrated by various social institutions. In 1975, with Joan CLARK, she co-founded and co-edited the literary journal Dandelion Magazine. For five years she was fiction editor of Grain, and she\n\n13\n\nALFORD\n\ncontinues on the editorial board of Coteau Books.

She acknowledges the support of teachers such as Chris WISEMAN, Robert KROETSCH, and Jack HOD GINS and attributes much of her inspiration to women writers such as Joan Clark, Alice MUNRO, and Audrey THOMAS. Jennifer J. Gustar\n\nALGONQUIAN ORAL LITERATURES. Algonquian (also spelled Algonkian') is a group of about three dozen related languages that descend from a common ancestor, Proto-Algonquian, which was spoken about three thousand years ago. By the time of first European contact, the Algonquian languages had spread across eastern and central Canada from Labrador to the northern Plains and down the Atlantic coast to North Carolina. The Canadian representatives of the Algonquian family are Blackfoot (in Alberta), CREE (several dialects from James Bay to Alberta), Maliseet (New Brunswick), MI'KMAQ (in the four Atlantic provinces and the Gaspe Peninsula of Quebec), Montagnais-Naskapi (in Quebec and Labrador), Munsee Delaware (in southern Ontario), OJIBWA (from western Quebec to Minnesota and Saskatchewan), Potawatomi (in southern Ontario), and Western Abenaki (in southern Quebec). Many more Algonquian languages were once spoken in the United States, including Menominee, Fox-Sauk-Kickapoo, Miami-Illinois, and Shawnee south of the Great Lakes; Arapaho, Atsina (or Gros Ventre), and Cheyenne on the Plains; Passamaquoddy, Penobscot, Massachusett, and Pequot in New England; Mahican and Delaware in the midAtlantic states; and Powhatan in Virginia. Although there are still many fluent speakers of most of the languages in Canada (except Maliseet, Munsee Delaware, Potawatomi, and Western Abenaki, which are close to extinction) and of some in the United States, more than half the known Algonquian languages are no longer spoken. None of these languages, however, has ever had a large numbers of speakers; even Cree and Ojibwa, with about 50,000 speakers each at their peak around the middle of the 20th cen-\n\n14\n\ntury, are vanishingly small from a worldwide perspective. In the i6th century Europeans collected isolated words and place names from Mi'kmaq and Montagnais speakers in the Gulf of St Lawrence and the Roanoke of North Carolina, but no connected texts. In the i/th century English and French missionaries recorded substantial texts (mostly of a religious nature) in various Algonquian languages, including John Eliot's translation of the entire Bible into the Massachusett language (Boston, 1663). Over the next four hundred years missionaries of various denominations produced a vast literature in many Algonquian languages, but since much of it was translated by the missionaries themselves from European originals, it is not a reliable guide to the grammar, usage, or literary style of Native speakers of the languages. From the mid-i9th century on, however, parts of the traditional ORAL literature were recorded in some Algonquian languages, mostly by linguists and anthropologists, although a few Native speakers wrote down their own versions. There is also a large corpus of stories recorded only in English or French TRANSLATION. Although some translators made valiant efforts to transmit the flavour of the originals, most silently edited the stories to suit EuroCanadian tastes and expectations, and some of the published versions (especially those intended for CHILDREN) were cut and bowdlerized beyond recognition. Of course, even the best translations provide only a second-hand experience of the literature (and even identifying the best requires some knowledge of the original text); attempting an analysis of Algonquian oral literature without first learning one or more Algonquian language is as unprofitable as analyzing Russian literature without knowing any Slavic language. All Algonquian languages have very complicated systems of inflection; a single word may have hundreds or even thousands of different forms. The inflections, not the word order, indicate the relationship among elements in a sentence, so merely looking up each word in a dictionary without reference to the grammar will often yield nonsense. But complete fluency is not required in order to sample the literature,\n\nALIANAK\n\nbecause the texts are usually accompanied by a translation. The two most important genres of Algonquian literature may be conveniently referred to by their Cree designations, dtayohkewin and dcimowin. Stories in the first category, equivalent to the MYTHS and legends of European literatures, explain the origins of the present world and its inhabitants (see CREATION STORIES), tell the adventures of legendary characters, and teach the consequences of disapproved behaviour. Although winter was traditionally the appropriate time for narrating dtayohkewina, some of the largest collections were recorded in the summer. The second category comprises accounts of historic events and personal experiences; not all are literally true - some stories are clearly apocryphal, and some are outright TALL TALES - but they are presented as things that happened to specific real people. Fiction, in the sense of works of imagination by known authors, is not an Algonquian concept. The literatures of the various Algonquian groups vary greatly in detail. Some stories were borrowed from neighbouring non-Algonquian peoples (and from Eurppean FOLKLORE, especially in the Maritimes). The chief character in the dtayohkewina is named Napi (nddpiiwa, 'the old man') in Blackfoot but Glooscap (Mi'kmaq kluskap; Maliseet koluskap, 'the liar') in the Maritimes; like Wisahkecahk (Cree) and NANABUSH (Ojibwa), he is both culture hero and TRICKSTER/buffoon. Although some of the stories are identical, the culture heroes have different attributes and are probably not just the same character with different names. Sources for the various Algonquian languages include the following. The largest body of texts in Blackfoot are the Southern Piegan stories recorded in Montana by C.C. Uhlenbeck and J.P.B. de Josselin de Jong (published in the Verhanddingen of the Royal Dutch Academy, 191113). The literatures of the Munsee Delaware and Potawatomi of southern Ontario have not been published (or even written down?), except for a short Munsee text in Frank G. Speck's The Celestial Bear Comes Down to Earth (Reading, PA: Public Museum and Art Gallery, 1945). The Centre d'Etudes Nordiques at U Laval published a few Montagnais legends in Atanukana, by Marie-Jeanne Basile and Gerard E. McNulty\n\n(1971), and in Basile's Innupminwan/Ethnocuisine montagnaise (1973). Anne(-Marie) Andre (in Montagnais, An Antane Kapesh), former chief at Sept-lies, wrote Eukuan nin matshimanitu innuiskueu/Je suis une maudite sauvagesse (Montreal: Ed Lemeac, 1976) and Tante nana etutamin nitassi?I'Qu'as-tu fait de man pays? (Montreal: Ed Impossibles, 1979), telling of the problems her people face in the modern world. Texts in Mi'kmaq are scarce, though large volumes of English translations of legends were published by S.T. RAND (1894) and others. A small selection, with both interlinear and free English translations, is available in A.D. DeBlois, Micmac Texts (Ottawa: Canadian Museum of Civilization, 1990). Others have been published in Tawow and other periodicals. Like Blackfoot, Maliseet-Passamaquoddy is a single language spoken on both sides of the Canada-US border. John Dyneley Prince's Passamaquoddy Texts (Publications of the American Ethnological Society, v 10, 1921) includes ten Glooscap stories; a better version of his Wampum Records is Wapapi Akonutomakonol/The Wampum Records: Wabanaki Traditional Laws, ed Robert M. Leavitt and David A. Francis (Fredericton: Micmac-Maliseet Inst, 1990). At least one large collection of texts remains unpublished. Despite its title, Abenaki Indian Legends, Grammar and Place Names (1932), by Henry Lome Masta, a former chief of the Western Abenaki, contains mostly dcimowina that explain the origins of various place names. A large collection of legends recorded by Frank T. Siebert from the last speakers ofPenobscot (an Eastern Abenaki dialect) is to be published by the American Philosophical Society.

Pentland\n\nALIANAK, Hrant Michael. Playwright, director, actor; b Khartoum, Sudan, 5 Feb 1950; son of Armenian parents. Alianak came to Canada in 1967, bursting onto Toronto's alternate THEATRE scene with a series of intensely theatrical short plays published as Return of the Big Five (1974). Directing his own work for the compa-\n\n15\n\nALIANAK\n\nnies with which he remains associated, Theatre Passe Muraille and Factory Theatre Lab, he blended pop culture and SURREALISM in a potent combination that earned him the mantle of Canada's foremost experimental playwright. His major plays, such as The Blues (1984; prod 1976) and Lucky Strike (1989; prod 1978), rework Hollywood B-movie cliches through fantastic lighting, sound, and movement effects. Alianak earned a Genie nomination for Best Supporting Actor in Atom Egoyan's film Family Viewing (1987).

Jerry Wasserman\n\nALLAN, Andrew Edward Fairburn. Actor, director, radio dramatist; b Arbroath, Scotland, ii Aug 1907, d Toronto 15 Jan 1974; son of Agnes (Fairbairn) and William Allan, a Presbyterian minister. Allan emigrated to Australia and Boston before settling in Ontario in 1925. He worked with The Family Doctor, Canada's first soap opera, on Toronto's CFRB RADIO, in 19317; then after two years with BBC London, he moved to Vancouver to develop CBC RADIO DRAMA, working with such actors as John Drainie, the musical director Lucio Agostini, and writers Lister SINCLAIR and Fletcher MARKLE. After moving to Toronto in 1943 as supervisor of CBC drama, Allan developed the prizewinning Stage series and CBC Wednesday Night, writing more than thirty plays, adapting fifty others, and directing over four hundred programs. In 1962 he became the first artistic director of the SHAW FESTIVAL; he returned to radio in 1965. His papers are at Concordia U in Montreal. See also LJUNGH, D.M.

Novelist, playwright; b Montreal 26 Jan 1916, d Toronto 29 June 1995; son of Annie (Elias) and Harry Herman. Allan's early writing - The Scalpel, the Sword (1952), a fictionalized biography of Norman Bethune (written with Sidney Gordon), and This Time a Better Earth (1939), a novel of the Spanish Civil war - reflects a didactic but panoramic historic and tragic vision. In later work, such as Love Is a Long Shot (1984; Leacock Medal for humour) and Lies My Father Told Me (story, stage play, and film), he courted popularity with comic coming-of-age themes. James Doyle\n\nALLEGORY is a protean mode of figuration that is always double, always a reinscription, always a system for speaking 'otherwise.' Conventionally, allegory - literally, 'other speaking' - has been deployed as a way of representing objects and narratives not easily approached directly: the story concerns a protagonist walking along a path in a forest and losing his way, but the concealed 'other' meaning of the story pertains to the progress of the soul through life and to the potential for perdition. In recent times, allegory has been taken up by a variety of POSTMODERN theorists - as a structuring principle for reading the communicative contract in Third World film (Fredric Jameson); as the inescapably ironic relation between representation and genuine human community in late modernity (Walter Benjamin); as a name for the inability of the sign to align with its object and thus for the condition of language itself (Paul de Man). But allegory in Canadian writing has more to do with another history. During the rise and consolidation of the European colonial empires, it was a remarkably effective tool for the promulgation of imperialist ideology and for naturalizing unequal social and political relations between Europe and its others. In response to this practice, allegory subsequently became an important mode through which POSTCOLONIAL writers and readers from a variety of specific cultural and historical locations,\n\nALLEN\n\nincluding ones in Canada, set out to interrogate Eurocentric imperial assumptions. Imperial forms of allegorical writing vary widely, but one of the most common manoeuvres in this archive is to represent colonial relations in terms of GENDER.
