Racheal was proudly independent and a full-time working mom at Equitable Trust Bank for 26 years. Racheal is preceded in death by her husband of 58 years, Trelys Prichard, who passed away in 2001.

Cherished wife, mother, Nonna (grandmother), and great-grandmother, Sheila was an inspired actress, writer, playwright, director, teacher, and artist. Her journey led her from England to Italy to the Eastern Shore of Virginia, where she planted her final roots and shared her passion for theatre and the arts. Sheila was born on July 8, 1921, in London, England, daughter of the late Patrick Daniel, an administrator of the London County Council, and Anne Fanning Mullin, both of Irish descent. She was preceded in death by her beloved husband of 60 years, Renato Cardano; her devoted son, Patrick Daniel Cardano; and her brother, Terrance Mullin. From an early age, Sheila began writing and illustrating stories and poems and writing songs. She attended St. Aloysius Convent, an all-girls’ Catholic school in London, and studied piano, violin, dancing, and elocution. Every summer she and her parents would journey across the Irish Sea by steamboat to Ireland, her parents’ homeland. Sheila especially enjoyed visiting her uncle, Michael Mullin, a poet known as the “Bard of Foremass,” who encouraged her imagination. Amidst the London air raids of World War II, Sheila studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). When the war ended in 1945, she joined a theatre company near London, and for several years was a promising and successful actress, receiving accolades for the many roles she played, including Rosalind in As You Like It, Tatiana in Midsummer Nights Dream, and Charlotte Bronte in Jane Eyre. She often had two full parts memorized at once, one in rehearsal and one in performance. In 1948, while playing Viola in Twelfth Night at the Sheffield Playhouse, Sheila met Renato Cardano, an Italian metallurgist and chemist who was studying steelmaking in England. He proposed to her on a train; they married on April 20, 1949, in a quiet wedding with family and a few friends, and honeymooned in Ireland. Sheila retired from the stage to move with her husband to Italy, where they resided for forty years, first in Terni, then in Rome, and finally in Terracina on the Tyrrenian Sea. Renato worked as the general manager of a steel and metallurgical research center, and Sheila continued to write, draw, and create art with different mediums. Together they raised their three children, Patrick, Clelia, and Luisa. Sheila’s parents joined them in Italy and spent their final years there. The tragic death of their son, Patrick, in 1979, ruptured their lives; Sheila coped through writing and her Catholic faith. Both of Sheila’s daughters, Clelia and Luisa, met and married American Navy officers in 1980 and moved to the United States, making memorable trips back to Italy every summer with their children. In 1989, Sheila and Renato followed their daughters to America. They found peace and tranquility on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, where they lived together for twenty years in their home on the Chesapeake Bay near Cape Charles. Renato created beautiful Mediterranean gardens for Sheila and their children and grandchildren to enjoy. Sheila and Renato, known as Nonna and Nonno, developed sweet routines in their daily life. Every morning, Renato would start Sheila’s day with a tray of tea. Every afternoon, Sheila would retire to her room where she would rest, write, and reflect, until Renato joined her for their afternoon tea and conversation about the world’s events and their latest projects. Every evening, they watched the sunset together. They radiated love and friendship. They were proud to become American citizens on September 12, 2001, among the first group of citizens to be sworn in after the events of 9-11. Sheila’s creativity blossomed during their retirement years on the Shore. Her daughter, Clelia, ignited a nonprofit, Arts Enter Cape Charles, renovating the Historic Palace Theatre and bringing together theatre lovers to produce many of Sheila’s plays, beginning with a full house for the very first Arts Enter production, Magia. Sheila wrote and produced over a dozen original plays, most notably Piece of Eden, a retelling of the history of the Eastern Shore in collaboration with Jean Collins and Gwen Skeens. Sheila also directed numerous plays by other playwrights, particularly British dramas and comedies. Clelia created the scenic design for Sheila’s plays and often performed and eventually directed plays herself; her daughter, Luisa, and her grandchildren also played numerous parts. Sheila’s spirit lives on in the vibrant arts community in Cape Charles. Many remember her emphatic directing, particularly her insistence on better diction. She was not afraid to ask a complete stranger to be in one of her plays, and dearly loved those who became a part of her troupe for many productions over the years. Sheila’s poetry was published in numerous magazines and anthologies. She published several books: Patrick, a compilation of stories, poems, and illustrations about grieving the loss of her son; Tail of the Squirrel and Other Tales: Stories for Children; and Plays for All Seasons, a collection of her original plays. She also wrote childrens’ songs. Her writing revealed her pure heart and true soul, and often opened a precious doorway into a child’s world of fantasy and innocence. Sheila was a devout Catholic and active member of St. Charles Catholic Church. She taught her grandchildren and several of their friends catechism and enjoyed serving as a lector, her diamond-clear voice resonating with conviction. Sheila was dedicated to arranging flowers for the altar and for many years compiled the church bulletin. A family meal was not complete without a prayer from Nonna. She was deeply passionate about the importance of staying connected to the spiritual world through her faith. She often had words of wisdom to share, reminding us to give ourselves time to think and be and not always do, to “have a good cry” if we needed to, and to be aware that once words are spoken, they can never be reversed. Sheila’s elegance, grace, and beauty emanated naturally from her with every step. She was known for her sharp wit, vibrant style, and depth of soul. She was not shy to tell you what she thought, and gave the most beautiful, heartfelt gifts of art and poems. She was shaped by her early experiences of living through the Great Depression and World War II, and saved every piece of aluminum foil. She understood the art of conversation, and had close relationships with each of her family members and many friends. She had a spark in her blue eyes that was impossible to ignore. In her later years after her husband passed away, Sheila was cared for lovingly by her two daughters, in Luisa and Victor’s home, and by very special people, including Andrea Price, Cynthia Dempster, Cindy Vera Rodriguez, Dr. Mark Clarke, Dr. John Sheppard, Victor Gazzolo, Father Michael Breslin, and many other angels, to whom the family will be forever grateful. Sheila is survived by two daughters and sons-in-law, Clelia Cardano Sheppard (John) of Cape Charles, and Luisa Gazzolo (Victor) of Cape Charles; seven grandchildren, Veronica Malone (Patrick), Renata Sheppard, Patrick Gazzolo (Melanie), Sheila Sheppard, John (Sean) Sheppard (Magda), Michael Gazzolo (Kyleigh), and Clelia Jane Sheppard; and five great-grandchildren, Charlotte and Kevin Malone, Aven Lovelady, Dylan and Luca Gazzolo, and John Daniel Sheppard, IV (Jack). She also leaves other friends, family, and many students and thespians who fondly remember her.\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nClarence Elliott Fitchett - Unknown - March 11, 2021\n\nDeparted: 03/11/2021 (Temperanceville)\n\nObituary Preview: Mr. Clarence Elliott Fitchett, age 94, of Pocomoke City, Maryland {formerly of Sanford, Virginia} passed away Thursday 11 March 2021.

Gloria was born May 21, 1931, at the family home in St. Albans, Vt., to William, a railroad worker, and Helena (Mayo) Peno, a homemaker. As a child, everyone knew her as “Honey,” but as the years passed and grandchildren came along, she was more commonly known by the nickname, “Gigi” (Grandma Gloria). She graduated from Bellows Free Academy in St. Albans, where she excelled in academics and led the high school basketball team to the state championship. Ten years younger than her twin sisters, she was often enlisted to babysit, but also relished annual shopping trips to New York City each year with her mother. Summers were spent at the family camp at Lake Champlain, while winters provided the opportunity to drive across the lake to Upstate New York. She moved to Washington, D.C., after high school and worked as a debriefer for the Voice of America when it was under the auspices of the United States Information Agency. According to legend, she had a roommate in Washington who talked incessantly into the late-night hours, so Gloria learned to sleep with her eyes open. Perhaps it was this skill that led her to become known for her artful and uncanny winking ability. During this time, she met Leon Morris Larson, a University of Missouri School of Journalism graduate heading to Hong Kong on government assignment (no doubt smitten by the wink). The couple married in 1954, celebrating two wedding anniversaries each year – one on the date she was legally married to Leon by proxy in Washington, and another on the date the couple subsequently wed in Hong Kong. Gloria was determined to complete their family by the time she was 30, which was accomplished four days before that mile marker with the birth of her fourth child. After marrying, her life’s work focused on family and raising four daughters who were born in quick succession within five years. She was a tireless homemaker who made lifelong friends wherever she ventured. She loved jade plants and African violets, rearranging furniture and The New York Times crossword puzzles. She also loved to make everyone feel at home, and to pamper her children and spoil her grandchildren. A cancer survivor, Gloria was a determined woman of formidable strength. She could be as proper as a debutante and as salty as a sailor, often in the same moment. This skill exuded charm and elicited both envy and respect from anyone who happened to be in her presence, usually while enjoying some Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, Johnny Cash, or Edith Piaf on the old Garrard turntable. The family moved often as her husband’s career took them across the country and around the world. Some of the places she called home before she and Leon retired to Virginia’s Eastern Shore included not only Hong Kong, but also Zama, Japan; Corte Madera, Calif.; Central Missouri; Alexandria, Arlington, and Virginia Beach, Va.; Canton, S.D.; and Omaha, Neb. After the death of her husband in Cape Charles in 1992, Gloria relocated back to Washington, D.C., until serendipity led her to return to Hong Kong, where she and Leon began their journey. It thrilled her to see the changes of those past 40 years, as well as to once again enjoy the peak-top views of the harbor from above the clouds. Gloria returned to the states more than a decade later to be nearer to her daughters and grandchildren. Most recently, she had resided at a ManorCare home since 2013, where she enjoyed holiday visits with family in the area and daily visits year-round. In addition to her husband, Gloria was predeceased by her parents; sisters, June Stearns (Walla) and Janice Massa (Angelo); niece, Mary (Massa) Myers, her husband, Steven, and their children, Jade and MacAlister. She is survived by four daughters: Tina Larson, of Fort Walton Beach, Fla., Laura Mulcahy (John), of Alexandria, Va., and Hong Kong, Ceri Danes (Mark), of Clive, Iowa, and Wendy Larson Carnemark (Jonas), of Bethesda; 11 grandchildren; four great-grandchildren; three nephews and one niece. The family wishes to express its sincerest gratitude to the staff of ManorCare Potomac for their years of dedication to Gloria, especially during the most challenging days of the pandemic. While a lockdown of long-term care facilities across the country prevented regular visits during her last months – a fact that is recognized with deep awareness and heavy hearts – the family appreciates those charged with her care and especially the video chats they facilitated. Details of a memorial service in Cape Charles will be announced once it is safe to gather. Arrangements are being made by Fox Funeral Home in Temperanceville. Memorial contributions can be made to Steven A. Myers and Mary Myers Scholarship Fund Trust, c/o Mark Massa, 7130 Old Farm Road, Littleton, CO 80128, or in the form of PPE to HCR ManorCare Potomac, 10714 Potomac Tennis Lane, Potomac, MD 20854.

Michael Breslin officiating\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nBetty Collins Lang - May 25, 1932 - February 11, 2021\n\nDeparted: 02/11/2021 (Temperanceville)\n\nObituary Preview: Betty Jean Collins Lang, 88, of Temperanceville, VA, passed away peacefully at home surrounded by her loving family on Thursday, February 11, 2021.

Papa Jack, as he was affectionately called, was born in Onancock on April 6, 1925, where he lived until his graduation from Onancock High School. Three days after graduation, Papa Jack relocated to accept a position at the Apprentice School in the Newport News Shipyard. He enlisted in the Merchant Marines and served his country during World War ll. Upon his return to the Eastern Shore, he met the love of his life, Jeanne Clark, affectionately known as Mama Jeanne. Papa Jack and Mama Jeanne, now with two sons, relocated to Yorktown in the late 1950’s. Papa Jack and his family returned to the Eastern Shore in the late 1960’s and settled on Hungars Creek. Papa Jack embarked on a career working on the water in various capacities as a commercial fisherman and, in his later years, as a shellfish sanitation inspector. He inspected facilities on the bayside and seaside of Virginia’s Eastern Shore, developing many lasting friendships and cultivating a reputation of respect along the way. In the early 1980’s, Papa Jack, John D. Watts, Jr., and good family friend William T. Wilkins partnered with Cherrystone Aqua-Farms to pioneer aquaculture on Hungars Creek. Papa Jack vigorously lived every aspect of his life from family, to work, to his interests and hobbies. He was a 50-year member of the Masonic Lodge (Capeville 107), the Johnstown Methodist Church in Machipongo, and enjoyed the church services held with Commonwealth Senior Living by Pastor Fletcher. Papa Jack was famous for entertaining friends, and anyone who would listen, to tales about his boyhood adventures in Onancock, wartime on the sea with the Merchant Marines, his courtship with Mama Jeanne, his relationships with his sons, and his experiences working and playing on the water over the decades. No matter the topic of conversation, Papa Jack’s intense love of life was apparent. His spirited presence will be missed by many, but certainly not forgotten. Surviving Papa Jack are his sister Nancy Hartz and her daughters Mary Lareau, Ann Warren and Martha Janney; his son John David Watts, Jr., (Lori Whittaker); granddaughter Jessica Watts; and son Ralph Edwin Watts. Additionally, he is survived by his two “adopted” sons Kevin Ambrose Rafferty and Michael T. Union. As Papa Jack would have said, “Their papers just haven’t come through yet.” Preceding him in death are his parents, Edwin and Madeline Watts; the love of his life, “Mama Jeanne” Watts; and his step-grandson, Keith Strachan.\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nRita Marie Hutton - March 23, 1931 - May 22, 2020\n\nDeparted: 05/22/2020 (Temperanceville)\n\nObituary Preview: A complete obituary will follow later.\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nJohn Benjamin (JB) Shertenlieb III - January 21, 2000 - May 21, 2020\n\nDeparted: 05/21/2020 (Temperanceville)\n\nObituary Preview: John Benjamin Shertenlieb III, “JB”, age 20 of Sanford, VA was called to Heaven on May 21, 2020.
