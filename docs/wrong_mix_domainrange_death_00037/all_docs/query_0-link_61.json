The Mary Nuckles in the census with Robert and Lienne Green said she had 4 children and 4 were living.\n\nThis leads me to believe that the Mollie that William married in 1886 was actually the mother of the children born earlier found in the 1880 census and perhaps they did not officially marry until 1886. See census records for connections. Given William divorced Mollie and remarried suggest the children lived seperately, as the census indeed show.

A. Charter heslop, at the age of 82.\n\nWilliam Isham Irby, Sr., son of William Rufus Irby and Maria Massie (Gentry) Irby, was born on his father's 656 acre farm at Locust Hill, four miles above Rockville, Va., Hanover County, on Feb. 23, 1851. He received his early education from his mother and several older sisters. His first formal schooling was at Capt. Tarlton Woodson's academy in Hanover County. He attended Changler & Coleman's Bowling Green Academy in 1867-68, returning to Locust Hill when he completed his course.\n\nOn January 10, 1873 he went to Hawkes Nest, West Virginia to clerk for MacDonald & Rudisill, ballast contractors for the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad, remaining until June, 1873 when he again returned to the farm. On March 20, 1875 he entered the telegraph office of the C. & O. at Hanover Courthouse and clerked under James Benson. He showed an aptitude for the work and when Benson left to attend the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition on May 1876, young Irby was placed in charge of the office. During his stay there he was also a deputy tax collector for the County under Treasurer George Doswell and studied under the office of Edmund Waddell, county court clerk.\n\nIn the fall of 1876, he was engaged to teach in the public school at Manakin, Va., serving there two years. In 1878 he entered Randolph-Macon College, Ashland, Va., being a classmate of the future Secretary of the Navy and State Senator, Claude Swanson. Ill health forced him to withdraw, however, and he returned to his home at Locust Hill. William's father, Captain William Rufus Irby, died June 2, 1879, and William took charge of the farm He opened a small store at what is now Vontay, two miles above the farm of Arthur Brown. He remained until December, 1887.\n\nOn Sept. 29, 1886, he was married to Susan Elizabeth Nuckolls of Waldrop, Louisa County, daughter of Charles Yancey and Victoria Anderson (Walton) Nuckolls. William met his bride about a year before while she was teaching school in his neighborhood (at his sister's Mrs. Gray). Susan was 13 years his junior, being born June 11, 1864. Susan Irby's mother, Maria Massie Irby, died July 29, 1887, and is buried beside her husband in the family plot on the Locust Hill farm. THeir first child, Charles Rufus Irby, was born August 2, 1887, and in December the young couple moved to Mrs. Irby's old home at Melrose, Louisa County, one mile from Thompson's Crossroads. In 1888 he opened a wholesale and retail general merchandise store at what is now Mechansville, Va. five miles south of Gordonsville, Va. During this time he conducted a school at his home for his children and a few outsiders.\n\nTo complete the education of his children he sent his family to Washington, D.C., in 1906. In 1908 (Feb. 12th). he sold his business and came to Washington, D.C. to join them. William was baptised in the Christian Church when he was 17 years old.\n\n[NI29295] Daughter of James Wilson &\n\nLucy Stewart\n\n*********************************************\n\n1880\n\nliving in Hollister, San Benito, CA\n\nMother of Arthur Edward West\n\n19 July 1895 San Francisco ~ 22 May 1968 San Mateo, CA\n\nMarried 19 Jun 1899 Reno, Washoe, NV\n\n1920\n\nLiving with her parents\n\nSan Francisco, San Francisco, CA\n\nFollowing her divorce from Jake, she resumed using her 1st married surname, West\n\n[HI29302] (Research):Parentage not know.

Moore and Emma Lou (Boyd) Moore.\n\nIn addition to her parents, Garnet Marie was preceded in death by three husbands, Frank J. Combs, Roscoe E. Betts and Cline C. Kiser. She was the mother of Peggy Marie Combs who died in infancy in 1934. She was also preceded in death by sisters, Norma Ann Moore, Edith Patton, Dana «b»Nuckles«/b», Bertha Hughes and Olive Upton.\n\nShe is survived by her son, James F. Combs and his wife, Carol June of Wintersville, Ohio; daughter, Jean Ann Johnson of St. Albans, West Virginia. Also surviving include grandchildren, Diane C. Combs, David A. Combs, Susan Summers Barnes, Robert Summers and Leigh Ann Summers Thompson; great-grandchildren, Roger Summers, Sean Summers and Samanthia Thompson. Two sisters survive her, Ethel Hinkle of Richwood, West Virginia, and June Ferrell of St. Augustine, Florida.\n\nGarnet Marie was a resident of Kanawha County, West Virginia, for 48 years. She was baptized into Christ October 18, 1956. She was a member of the Shrewsbury Church of Christ until she moved to Lebanon, Virginia in 1963. She was an active member in the Lebanon Church of Christ until her removal to Steubenville, Ohio in 1995 where she was affiliated with the Lovers Lane Church of Christ.\n\nGarnet Marie was very talented. Her talent and creativity took her in many directions. While in East Bank, West Virginia, she and her husband, Frank owned and operated The Combs Upholstery Shop. While working the shop Garnet Marie selected the materials and fabrics and sewed and upholstered couches, chairs and automobile interiors.\n\nWhile a resident of Russell County, Virginia, Garnet Marie worked at various jobs outside the home. She was manager and clerk in a small family owned grocery store. She worked as a seamstress in a garment factory and was a food and nutrition representative for a short time.\n\nHer home exemplified her talent as an artist through her eye for color and detail. Her most outstanding talent was her ability to play piano. She was self-taught and could play all types of music: ragtime, polka, country, classical and religious.\n\nIn recent years she has entertained residents and friends at The Martha Manor Home and the Carriage Inn in Steubenville, Ohio. Sitting at the piano, you would hear her say, \"name that tune\". Someone would name a song and she would play it. Music just seemed to flow from her fingers. Her wit was not exceeded. One would ask, \"Can you play, 'Somewhere Over The Rainbow'?\" and she would come back with, \"I can't play over the rainbow but I will play for you here.\" She made life a little brighter for us all with her sunshine. She will be long remembered.\n\nFriends may call at Montgomery Memorial Park, London, West Virginia, in the chapel on Monday, August 10, 2009, from 12:30 p.m. until time of service at 1:30 p.m. with Minister Lloyd N.

He is my cousin, (like a brother, we grew up in the same house) our mothers were twin sisters. I am really his only living family, besides his brother, and my sister, and his children. so nobody else would have known, being he didnt get the chance to really be involved actively in their lives.

Bud was born in Ludlow, Ky. on Jan. 29, 1925. Dying just shy of his 85th birthday, he had just reached half a century as a Mason.\n\nBud met his sweetheart, Ruth Lavern Hall, born April 13, 1926, while in school in Ludlow, Ky. in 1939 and despite a stint away in the Navy during WWII, managed to pursue her until they were married during the summer of 1947. He started at Purdue University in the fall of 47 on the G.I. bill and graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering.\n\nBud used his new skills to be one of two engineers to first track the Sputnik satellite in 1957 while on assignment at Eglin Air Force Base on the Florida panhandle. Later, while working for Pan American World Airways during the 1960s, he was often on loan around the world to NASA, the Department of Defense and the Air Force as he worked on tracking the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo space programs, including the moon landing in 1969. During the 1970s, Bud worked continuously overseas with his expatriate family in tow, running the airport in Liberia, West Africa and installing navigation systems in the Sultanate of Oman, located on the Saudi Arabian peninsula.\n\nReturning stateside during the 1980s, he worked until PanAm folded in 1991. Bud tried to retire several times during the 1990s, once to the Ashville area of N.C., then again to Hot Springs Village, Ark., but kept being called back to work as a consultant until he finally managed to settle in Florence, Ala. in 2003, where he and his wife of then 56 years joined his youngest son, Todd, daughter-in-law, Dr. Barbara Frazier, and their three children, Sam, Christopher and William. In addition, left behind are his middle son, Mark, with granddaughter Anna; daugther-in-law, Nancy, with granddaughter Kendra and his brother John, with sister-in-law Valerie, niece Andrea and nephew Craig.\n\nAll told his wife counts some 62 years of marriage and 23 moves, not including the rentals, but what are a few here or there amongst such long devoted friends.
