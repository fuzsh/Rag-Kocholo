The You Can't Get Beef Jerky in Marx Engels Germany Decade? The I'm So Happy to Be a Scientist My Eyeballs are Jellin' Decade? The Conservation of Energy Decade? The Hungry Forties Decade in Ireland? The Polk and Polka Decade? The Anesthesia Decade in Medicine? The Kierkegaard Fear and Trembling Decade in Philosophy? Whitey seems to be taking over the world walking away in this transitional decade, but the teeming masses of hungry angry working class whites end it in a pool of red blood as the Old Guard still has the juice to squash European-wide revolutions, causing Marx and Engels to bring their Communist Manifesto back into the shop for retooling until Darwin gives them the boost they need at the end of the next decade? The last decade in which Europe remains overwhelmingly rural? The decade in which popular newspapers make their big splash in England, along with the profession of dentistry in the U.S.? The Mendelssohn Decade? The decade in which Giuseppe Verdi bursts on the opera scene? English writer Charles Dickens, French writers Alexandre Dumas pere and fils, and American writer Edgar Allan Poe romp, and the English spinster Bronte sisters put out on their desks? Jerusalem begins to come alive again as the Great Jewish Hope?\n\nCountry Leader From To United States of America Martin Van Buren (1782-1862) Mar. 4, 1837 Mar. 4, 1841 Britain Queen Victoria (1819-1901) June 20, 1837 Jan. 22, 1901 Austria Emperor Ferdinand I (1793-1875) Mar. 2, 1835 Dec. 2, 1848 Russia Tsar Nicholas I (1796-1855) Dec. 1, 1824 Feb. 18, 1855 Prussia Friedrich Wilhelm III (1770-1840) Nov. 16, 1797 June 7, 1840 Papacy Gregory XVI (1765-1846) Feb. 2, 1831 June 9, 1846 Turkey Sultan Abdul Mecid I (1823-61) July 1, 1839 June 25, 1861\n\n1840 - The Amistad Case Year in the U.S.? The Afternoon Tea Year in the U.S.? The Mehmet Ali Year in Egypt? Good year to be a French or English novelist?\n\n1840 Pop.: Great Britain: 18.5M; Ireland: 8M. The Sixth (6th) U.S. Census reports a total pop. of 17,069,043 (9.8 per sq. mi.); New York City: 313K. Life expectancy in industrialized countries begins to increase by one-quarter of a year (3 mo.) per year. The U.S. struggles with a severe economic depression this year, brought about by the Panic of 1837; meanwhile in this decade Irish-Ams. send $1M back to relatives in Ireland and encourage them to immigrate. I fooled around and fell in love, yes I did? Mass slaughter of the 36M buffalo (bison) in the U.S. begins at the rate of 1M-2M a year under a U.S. govt. policy to \"settle the vexed Indian question\"; by 1875 only 5.5M remain, down to 541 in 1889 and 300 in 1900; in 1875 Gen. Philip Sheridan tells the Tex. legislature that whites should \"kill, skin and sell until the buffaloes are exterminated. Then your prairie can be covered with speckled cattle and the festive cowboy - the forerunner of an advanced civilization.\" China has one-third of world GDP, which begins plummeting in the two Opium Wars, bottoming out at 2% by 1980, then rising to 15% by 2013. The Second Industrial Rev. begins about this time, bringing railroads, large-scale steel production, increased use of steam power and petroleum, mass production, and factory electrification. This year is classified as a fun-with-Bambi Messianic Year by the Qabbalists (Kabbalists) in Europe, maybe because the Ottomans reestablish control of Jerusalem , which has a pop. of 10,750 incl. 3K Jews and 3,359 Christians, giving foreigners permission to buy land in 1850, after which the Jewish pop. zooms, becoming the majority group in 1850 (6K vs. 5,350 Muslims and 3,650 Christians), followed by 8K in in 1860, 11K in 1870, 17K in 1880, 25K in 1890, 35K in 1900, 45K in 1910, and 34.4K in 1921. Between this year and 1900 7M U.S. patents are granted. By this year there are 494 steamboats operating on midwest U.S. rivers. By this year there are 2,816 mi. of railroads in operation in the U.S. and 1,331 in England. On Jan. 13 the steamboat Lexington burns in Long Island Sound with the loss of over 100 lives; four days later a lithograph by Culithograph in the New York Sun by Currier and Ives becomes the first line diagram to illustrate a current event in a U.S. newspaper; the career of Currier and Ives in New York City (founded 1834) is launched, going on to pub. 7K+ different 10-cent prints in a factory with hundreds of employees until 1907. On Jan. 17 the Repub. of the Rio Grande in NE Mexico proclaims independence from Mexico; too bad, the rebellion is quashed by Nov. 6. In Jan. Zulu chief (since 1828) Dingane is overthrown and killed by his half-brother Mpande (1798-1872) (also half-brother of Shaka) with the help of Andries Pretorius and 400 burghers, and he becomes Zulu chief (until 1872) (longest ruling); meanwhile Mzilikazi (Mosilikatze) (\"Great Road\") (1790-1868), a former lt. of Shaka Zulu who rebelled in 1823 and fled to exile with his Khumalo tribe, first to Mozambique then to Transvaal founds Matabeleland in modern-day Zimbabwe between the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers, with capital in Bulawayo (\"town of the persecuted one\") (modern-day pop. 1.2M), named after Shaka Zulu's capital.

Adams) results in a landslide for \"log cabin and hard cider\" William Henry Harrison, whose pres. campaign turns around mockery that he is only suited to sit in a log cabin drinking hard cider by flaunting it and calling himself the log cabin candidate (although he doesn't actually do that in real life), with an emblem of a log cabin made of buckeye (horse chestnut) timbers, while John Bear \"the Buckeye Blacksmith\" from South Bloomfield, Ohio makes 331 speeches for Harrison, causing Ohio to become known as the Buckeye State; in 1888 A.H.

Swiss-German chemist Germain Henri Hess (1802-50) pub. Hess' Law of Constant Heat Summation, that the total energy (enthalpy) gained or lost in a series of chemical reactions depends only on the initial and final statements, becoming a progenitor of the First Law of Thermodynamics; in 1842 he proposes the law of thermoneutrality, that exchange reactions of neutral salts in aqueous solutions evolve no heat. English amateur scientist James Prescott Joule (1818-89) pub. the I^2*R law for the heat given off by a conductor of resistance R carrying a current I (Joulean heat) - the reason Easy-Bake Ovens work?

Nonfiction: Louis Agassiz (1807-73), Studies of Glaciers (Etudes sur les Glaciers); explains the role of glaciers in geological change, making a Biblical Flood unnecessary; in the fall noted Biblical Flood proponent Rev. William Buckland of Oxford debates with Agassiz at the annual meeting of the British Assoc. for the Advancement of Science in Edinburgh, and they end up going to Blackford Hill to the S to outpoint each other, and after Buckland gets the first points for an unstratified boulder, Agassiz takes him to a nearby cliff and points out hidden striations, indicating a moving glacier, and shouts \"That is the work of ice\", instantly converting him?; the scientific community remains unconvinced for a dozen years until the snow cover of Greenland is found to lie on top of a gigantic moving ice sheet, and the drift deposits on the Baltic coastline are explained by moving icebergs, giving scientists the rush of a new potential sciencescope; too bad, linguistic evidence of primitive cultures describing a universal flood also begins to be uncovered, so the battle rages on.
