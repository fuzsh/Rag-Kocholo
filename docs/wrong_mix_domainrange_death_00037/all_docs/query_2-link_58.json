        "text": "‘The whole human position is no longer tenable,’ announces a character early in William S Burroughs's Cities of the Red Night. The story that Burroughs’s biographer Ted Morgan – whose previous subjects include Winston S Churchill, W Somerset Maugham and Franklin D Roosevelt – tells in Literary Outlaw is that of someone who has spent an entire literary life attempting to reconcile a belief that human existence is unendurable with the knowledge that it is also inescapable, and whose literary life itself derives from the event which confirmed him in that belief.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 6, 1951, William Seward Burroughs – alienated scion of the Midwestern upper-middle class, grandson of the inventor of the Burroughs adding machine, demimondain mentor to Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, junkie, gun fetishist – was attempting to demonstrate the virtuosity of his marksmanship by doing a ‘William Tell act’.
