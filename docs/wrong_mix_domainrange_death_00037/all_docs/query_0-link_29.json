H.U.Smith, May 24, 1988.\n\nGeoffrey Stanger, in his letter rec'd Aug.8,1989, provides an extract from the Will Indices in Somerset House as follows: 1874. 10 December. The Will of Mary Smith (heretofore wife of John Smith) late of March in the Isle of Ely and County of Cambridge widow who died 31st May 1874 at March was proved at Peter-borough by John Stanger Smith of March Merchant the Son and Edward Henry Edwards of 168 Adelaide Road in the Parish of St.John Hampstead in the County of Middlesex Stationer the Executor.

Son was a Corn Miller in March, CAMBS. John (this one) also probably lived in Tydd St. Giles. His third Wife, Mary Dent STANGER, was from Tydd St.Mary, LINCOLNSHIRE. However, Since his Son, John Stanger-Smith was Married in St.Ives, and HIS first Child was Born Nth. Witchford, CAMBS. in late 1862, THEN during the period 1832 (when He and Mary Dent Stanger were Married) and 1862 the Family may have moved, possibly in stages from Tydd St.Giles to March.\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n\n1. Search 1841 If Family living there at that time, try 1851 Census for Tydd St.Giles. Also try 1841 Census of Tydd St.Mary, LINCS. for traces of Stangers. Furthermore look for any mention of John and Martha SMITH and Children. (unlikely) John and Mary Dent SMITH and Children; and for John Stanger-SMITH and Emma (ULPH) and Family after she left home and married in 1860. Note: Emma shows in the St.Ives Census Records for the ULPH Family in 1841 and 1851. Since she was Married in 1860, she is not shown in the St.Ives Census for 1861; but may appear in Nth. Witchford. Also look for the Stanger (or Dent) Families in Tydd St.Mary in LINCOLNSHIRE. 1841 Census Records for Tydd-St.Giles, Ref.241227, ordered from the Mormon Library at Greenwich, Apr. 23, 1988.

Bulpin\n\n...\"Few of the officials were exempt from these bickerings. The technicians, like William Stanger the surveyor, were the best of the bunch for they were kept too busy to indulge in quarrels. In any case Stanger who had come to Natal fresh from exploring the Niger River and was well pickled with tropical diseases died in Durban on the 14th March 1854.\n\nDr. Peter Cormack Sutherland who had originally set up a medical practice in Durban in 1853 was then appointed to the position of Surveyor\".\n\nSTANGER: The Town.\n\nIn 1870 the town was non-existent. Only two years later was the magistracy then known as the Tugela Division of Victoria County removed there from Umhlali. A large African hut served as the magistrate's office. In March 1873 the Surveyor-General Dr. P.C. Sutherland laid out a town and named the place Stanger after his late predecessor\"\n\n\"Of the older places Stanger became a town on the 13th October 1920 and a borough on the 1st August 1949....\n\nIn the Encyclopaedia of South Africa it refers to it as \"A town on the North Coast of Natal named after Dr. William Stanger\"....\"\n\nIn a Stanger Family File received from Mark Ward in April 2008, he included the following:\n\nThe Times, 22 January 1842\n\nLONDON, SATURDAY, JANUARY 22, 1842.\n\nWe transcribe, in another column, from a morning contemporary, what it justly calls \"the afflicting intelligence\" respecting the Niger expedition, and which is considered to be the official anti-slavery account of the matter. The result of that enterprise has been sadly correspondent with what all reasonable men must have augured, and what we ourselves hare always predicted. Three vessels have gone about 320 miles up the Niger and Chadda, and have come down again. A model farm some 300 miles from the coast has been bought, stocked, and abandoned; treaties have been made with the two negro Princes of Eboe and Iddah for the abolition of the slave trade and of human sacrifices, and then they have been left to their own practices; and this at an expense of health and life which is not indeed distinctly stated, but may well be divined from the account given by our contemporary, to whose statement we will add an extract from a letter written on board the Ethiope on the 21st of October :-\n\n\"We entered the Nun on the 10th inst., and proceeded up the river the next morning, and fell in with the Albert on the evening of the 13th inst. at Stirling Island, about 24 miles below Eboe. We found her in a worse state than the Wilberforce; all hands down with fever but Drs M'William, Stanger, a scientific gentleman, a marine, the boatswain's mate, and a servant. Captain Trotter very weak, Captain Bird Allen (who is since dead) very low; no engineers; Dr. Stanger was endevouring to work the engine the best way he could. We sent our head engineer on board, and the Albert followed the Ethiope to the coast. Captain Becroft then went on board the Albert, and took her to Fernando Po. The people at the model farm, including its manager, Mr. Carr, were all sick, and have been brought down by the Albert.\"\n\nThe Times, 27 January 1842\n\nTHE NIGER EXPEDITION.\n\nREPORT OF CAPTAIN TROTTER.\n\nOn the 5th of October Mr. Willie weighed and dropped down the river, but was soon prevented by sickness from carrying on duty; and Dr. M'William, assisted by only one white seaman, lately recovered from fever,took charge of the vessel, not thinking it right, in my state of fever, to report Mr. Willie's illness.\n\nFrom want of engineers we should have had to drop down the whole length of the river without steam, had not Dr. Stanger, the geologist, in the most spirited manner, after consulting Tredgold's work on steam, and getting some little instruction from the convalescent engineer, undertaken to work the engine himself. The heat of the engine-room affected the engineer so much as to throw him back in his convalescence, and prevent him rendering any further assistance, but Dr. Stanger took the vessel safely below Eboe, without anything going wrong with the machinery, while Dr. M'Willam, in addition to his enormous press of duty, as a medical officer, conducted the ship down the river in the most able and judicious manner. I may here remark that the Doctor steered the ship entirely by Commander William Allen's excellent chart of the Niger, of the correctness of which we had a good opportunity of judging on ascending the river, and which proved eminently useful on the passage down; and Mr. Brown, clerk, a native of Africa, who had been up the river before, also rendered, him considerable assistance in the pilotage.\n\nWhen about 100 miles from the sea Captain Becroft happily made his appearance in the Æthiope, steamer, having been requested to ascend the river and communicate with us by Commander William Allen of the Wilberforce; and it was really a providential mercy that he arrived when he did, for had any accident, however trivial, happened, to the engines, they could not have been worked any longer, as Dr. Stanger had no knowledge of the manner of rectifying it. Fever still prevented my going on deck, and there was no executive officer to take the vessel over the bar, and only one convalescent sailor doing duty, and no black sailor who could properly take the helm. Captain Becroft, however, came onboard with an engineer, and not only took the vessel over the bar but brought her all the way across to this anchorage (a distance of 160 miles), where we arrived in safety on the 17th inst.\n\nI have already alluded to Dr. Stanger's praiseworthy conduct in his acquiring a knowledge of the steam-engine, by which we were enabled to get down the river so much more speedily than we otherwise could have done; but this gentleman was, if possible, still more useful in the medical assistance which he rendered to Dr. M'William, who latterly had no assistant-surgeon to relieve him in his duties. I am sorry to say that Dr. Stanger is beginning to feel the effect of his exertions, having had fever (although slightly) within the last two days.\n\nIn an e-Mail received from Joyce [Pickering] Trousdale on August the 7th, 2012, she included an Article from the Yorkshire Gazette of June 10, 1854 that reads:\n\nOn March 11, at D'Urban, after a week's illness, Dr. Stanger, surveyor-general of the Colony of Natal. He was one of the few survivors of the memorable Niger expedition. Dr. Stanger's scientific attainments and sterling principles endeared him to every one who knew him, an his experience as surveyor-general of the colony, extending over a period of nine years, gave him a high position in the Legislative Council.\n\nand,\n\nIn a further e-Mail received from Joyce [Pickering] Trousdale on September the 12th, 2012, she included an Article from the Rutland, Lincoln and Stamford Mercury of August the 8th, 1851, that reads:\n\nWISBECH. ------ Dr. William Stanger, of the Niger Expedition celebrity, arrived in this town on Saturday from Port Natal, Cape of Good Hope.

Dr. George Eaton STANGER MRCSE LSA [3832] (William8, William [the Elder]7, William M.D. (Dr.)6, James5, William Thomas4, Thomas3, Humphrey2, Unknown1) was born on 15 Apr 1816 in Fleet Lincolnshire England, was baptised in Baptist Chapel Fleet Hargate Lincolnshire England, and died on 6 May 1892 in Wakefield Yorkshire England at age 76.\n\nGeneral Notes: George was, for many years, Head Surgeon at the Nottingham Dispensary. He apparently had a fine House with three Servants.\n\nH.U.SMITH, from \"Betty\" SPENDER's letter of July 7, 1988. ...\n\nWhen he died, George lived at 82 Brooke Green Hammersmith; and left 4853 pounds, 6 shillings & 8 pence in his will.\n\nGeorge Eaton Stanger was born in Fleet Lincolnshire and baptised at the Fleet Baptist Chapel NC on the 15th of April 1916. He had five sisters and four brothers His parents were William and Rebecca Stanger.\n\nHe studied medicine at Edinburgh, and became a \"Member of the Royal College of Surgeons\" and held the \"Licence of the Society of Apothecaries\" in 1840 and by 1844 he is living in Carlton Street Nottingham and he was mentioned in the Nottingham Date book Aug.8th 1844 and is on the list of members of the Medico-Chirurgical Society in 1846\n\nIt was probably around 1844 that he married Mary Hurst the eldest daughter of Nathan and Sarah Hurst a very prominent family in Nottingham. His Father-in Law was a Hosier and Baptist preacher. Her brothers Nathan and John were also hosiers and Aldermen, John was on the Board of Guardians and on the Racecourse Committee. In 1845/6 Nathan was one of the Sheriffs of Nottingham. Mary was one of nine children who nearly all married influential people in public life.\n\nIn the 1851 census the Stanger family was living in St. James Street or Place there were three sons, William aged 5, George Hurst aged 3, Henry York aged 1. There was also a dispenser and three female servants.\n\nBy 1861 they were living in North Circus Street and there were six children, only William was still at home, the other five children were Margaret Ann aged 9, Mary Elizabeth aged 8, Charles Edward aged 5, Walter aged 4 and Harriet aged 2.\n\nNorth Circus Street was still the family home in 1871,however on census night Mary was away and the only children there were Harriet who was now 12 years old and Henry Yorke who was 21 and an undergraduate of Oxford University. He must have been home on holiday. There was also a nephew living with them, John Heard Manlove the son of Mary's sister Elizabeth who was married to the lace manufacturer Thomas Manlove.\n\nGeorge Eaton was elected president of the Medico-Chirurgical Society twice. 1870-1 and 1876-8 and in 1881 he was vice president and treasurer. He had been treasurer before 1880 and continued until January 25th 1888 when he resigned on his retirement. He had been Consulting Surgeon to the Nottingham Dispensary and formerly Surgeon to the Nottingham Union Hospital.\n\nAt this time the surgery of Stanger and Son was 67 Gregory Boulevard. The son was Charles Edward living at 139 Willoughby St. New Lenton.\n\nGeorge and Mary then seem to have moved to London as the address in George's will was 82 Brook Green Hammersmith London on the 7th November 1889.One of the witnesses was Hannah Simons another of Mary's sisters..\n\nHe died in 1892 in Wakefield in Yorkshire. He had possibly been visiting his son William, who was a MRCS, FRCS, and LSA. He had studied at Guys Hospital and then after being House Surgeon at the Nottingham Dispensary he moved on to become Surgeon to the Hospital and Dispensary at Clayton Yorkshire. So two of George Eaton's sons followed in his footsteps. He wasn't to know that one of his Grandsons, Harry, would also follow in his footsteps.\n\nAll his estate was left to his wife Mary for her lifetime and after her death the income from trust funds to Margaret Ann and Harriett as long as they were not married.\n\nFrom the Nottingham Medico-Chirurgical Society 150th Anniversary Year Book.\n\nPage 16 On list of members of the Nottingham Medico-Chirurgical Society 1846\n\nPage 24 An account of an attendance at a \"truly horrible obstetric emergency\" in 1854\n\nPage 25 Mentioned last recorded attendance as Treasurer to the society on 3rd Feb.1888\n\nPage 30 Reference to speech made in 1886 on the use of Antiseptics in operations.\n\nPage 75 President of the Nottingham Medico-Chirurgical Society 1870-1 and 1876-8.\n\nIn March, 2011, Ken Stanger [no relation], provided the following Information:\n\nDr George Eaton Stanger (1816-1892). \"surgeon\" (ship's doctor)\n\nDr George Stanger kept a journal during his time at sea on an Australian whaler. He arrived in Australia on the ss. Sarah and Elizabeth .\n\nThe Sarah and Elizabeth was one of five large vessels purchased by the South Australian Company in 1836 and 1837 to engage in whaling from their base at Kingscote on Kangaroo Island. (Kostoglou & McCarthy, Whaling and Sealing Sites in South Australia (1991) p. 65). The vessel had previously been a whaler in the South Seas and also in the northern or Arctic whale fishery and was purchased at a northern port in Britain by an agent for the South Australian Company in August 1836. She was an old vessel, having been built in the American state of Maryland in 1775. The recent failure of the northern fishery may have meant there were a number of whalers like her on the market.\n\nShe departed Hull in October 1836 under the command of Captain James Wakeling. Captain Wakeling was an experienced mariner who had previously commanded the British whalers Prudent and the Pandora (1831-1835). She seems to have been fully equipped and manned for whaling from the start. Among her crew was the \"surgeon\" (ship's doctor) Dr George Eaton Stanger (1816-1892). The vessel took fourteen tons of sperm whale oil on the way to South Australia where she arrived 23 April 1837. The sixty-two year old vessel arrived in poor condition and there were instances of desertion and drunkenness among the crew that caused problems for the company. (AGE Jones, Ships Employed in the South Seas Trade, 1775-1861, (1986) Index p.101; Keith Travers Borrow, Whaling at Encounter Bay (1947) pp.3-5)\n\nShe departed Nepean Bay 8 May 1837, apparently on a bay whaling cruise, and returned 4 September and underwent repairs (R.T Sexton, Shipping Arrivals and Departures in South Australia, 1627-1850, (1990) p.34).\n\nShe next left Nepean Bay on January 10 January 1838 for Encounter Bay to take aboard the oil and \"bone\" (baleen) and provisions from the Solway that had been wrecked there in December 1837. (Sexton, p.42). She returned to Kingscote 3 February 1838 but ran aground at low water. She was refloated and departed for Hobart on 16 February where she arrived 5 March. (Ian Nicholson, Shipping Arrivals and Departures, Tasmania, 1834-1842, (1985) p.106).\n\nThe vessel remained in Hobart for some months repairing and fitting out for a pelagic or deep-sea whaling voyage. She seems to have departed Hobart for the South Seas around July 1839. The cruise lasted for twelve-months and ended on 3 July 1840 in Sydney where she arrived with just thirty tons of sperm whale oil aboard. (Ian Nicholson, Shipping Arrivals and Departures, Sydney, 1826-1840, (1981) p.244)\n\nShe departed Sydney for the whaling grounds on 29 September 1840. This voyage ended when she returned to South Australia on 1 February 1842 again with only 30 tons of oil aboard (Sexton, p.86). Dr Stanger seems to have left the ship at around this time as Sarah and Elizabeth had a different surgeon on board when she sailed from South Australia for London on 19 January 1843.\n\nAnother crewman who left the vessel around this time was seaman E. Binyon who wrote home to his father in England, \"The Sarah and Elizabeth is now fitting out for home and I should have gone in her if I had been treated as I ought to have been. I have had no encouragement from"
