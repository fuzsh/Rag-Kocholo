While the basic editorial interests and questions remain unchanged, a shifting emphasis reflects the concerns of a new generation of architects and scholars. The chora series has sought to articulate alternatives to a facile formalism in contemporary architecture, while rejecting nostalgic or reactionary solutions. The question of how to act responsibly in architecture remains paramount. In the first years of the new millennium, however, this question must take account of our increasingly more powerful electronic tools for formal innovation. Computers are now able to generate new forms that are totally “other” from our traditional orthogonal building practices. This can lead to projects and buildings of complex and novel shape that may be oblivious to their cultural context, intended programs, historical roots, ethical imperatives, and the experiencing body. In recent years we have witnessed an accentuation of gnostic tendencies with respect to history. This suggests that what we have made has nothing to teach us, particularly if it is older than the Second World War, and that only rational models or an introspective pseudonaturalism could be a legitimate (instrumental) methodology for design. Perhaps arising from desperation due to difficulties encountered in practice, this historical gnosticism has become almost fanatic. Even in arguments put forward under the guise of critical theory, one senses a disturbing myopia that disregards the historical origin of issues that supposedly have surfaced only recently. Yet only history in its broad sense – as the “shifting essence” of architecture, within the larger context of our inherited spiritual and philosophical tradition – can help us distinguish between significant innovation and fashionable novelty. The essays in this volume are driven by a genuine desire to seek architectural alternatives to simplistic models based on concepts of aesthetics, technology, or sociology. Their refreshing readings of our tradition acknowledge both the continuity of our philosophical and cultural landscape and the differences encountered in diverse spaces and times. In the ix\n\nPreface\n\nabsence of a living architectural tradition, these “stories for the future” reveal possibilities in places that are often ignored by conventional historiography and science. While avoiding the dangerous delusions of absolute, transparent truth represented by a single master narrative, they recognize the need for histories to guide ethical action in architecture. The growing impact of the internet and other light-based media continues to create problems for architecture. Society remains suspicious of the importance of lived space, with its uncanny weaving of spatiality, temporality, and light. Light, like space and time before it, may soon become a commodity; even its absolute speed has now been successfully modified. Nevertheless, chora, as a crossing of the human and the morethan-human worlds, remains the space of human communication, of communion, of Eros and dreams: the space of architecture. Architecture affects us deeply, despite our predilection for the screen of our PowerBook, and not surprisingly, mental pathologies are on the increase. The architect’s work issues from the personal imagination, and an appropriate mode of discourse is needed to prevent this work from becoming a simplistic formal play or an irresponsible will to power. chora continues to pursue a reconciliatory architecture that respects cultural differences, acknowledges the globalization of technological culture, and points to a referent other than itself. As in previous volumes, these eleven essays explore concrete historical topics within a critical framework that suggests possibilities for action. This selection includes Marc Glaudemans’s original speculation on the nature of urban space, beyond a dualistic concept of nature versus culture or bounded versus unbounded. Exploring the relationship between the Greek chora and the hinterland of modern (seventeenth-century) Amsterdam, Glaudemans’s conclusions are provocative in our age of megalopolis. In a topic related to the crucial theatrical dimension of chora (prominent in the first volume of this series), George Hersey also addresses the origins of our tradition. In his interesting study of the Roman Colosseum he articulates the importance of a cosmic geometry in the place for spectaculum in Rome. Echoing Hersey’s concerns in the eighteenth century, Dorian Yurchuk’s analysis of Ranelagh Gardens examines the theatricality associated with architectural meaning during the early modern period. This detailed case study demonstrates the cultural relevance of spaces for play-acting, which are often disregarded in our quest for the “tectonic” aspects of architectural precedents. x\n\nPreface\n\nThree essays in this volume examine early Renaissance subjects. Michael Emerson, in his study of Alberti, with particular reference to Cusano, attempts to redefine Renaissance architectural space with respect to cosmography and geography. Emerson admirably accomplishes the difficult task of describing its otherness, without resorting to concepts of ancient, medieval, or modern. Robert Kirkbride offers a reading of the Umbrian studioli as a crossing of medieval memory practices and the new emerging philosophical interests of the Renaissance. While the Urbino and Gubbio studioli embody knowledge, Luca Pacioli’s architectural writings demonstrate how this capacity of architecture is concentrated in the hands of the craftsman. Alberto PérezGómez’s exhaustive reading of the treatises of Luca on architecture demonstrates the nature of the craft as the epiphany of theological wisdom, akin to alchemy. Three essays in this volume discuss the work of nineteenth-century British figures. Joanna Merwood and Caroline Dionne both articulate possibilities for architecture emerging in the wake of the final disintegration of a Western cosmological picture. Merwood examines the true possibilities of modern symbolic intentionality in the writings of William Lethaby, often misleading in his self-expressed purpose. Dionne discusses architectural lessons to be found in the works of the poet and mathematician Lewis Carroll. The writer of Alice never accepted (like Edmund Husserl) the final demise of Euclidean geometry and its substitution by non-Euclidean geometries. Mark Dorrian’s perceptive essay on Ruskin’s theory of the grotesque raises the issue of mimesis in relation to the “new subject” which emerges in Europe after the demise of the ancien regime. Ruskin, who questioned the power of the reductive camera lucida to reveal anything of substance about reality, was nevertheless fascinated by mirrors and by the capacity of the daguerreotype to reveal monstrosity – the “other side” of reality – through its “index.” This awareness opened up strategies, later developed by Walter Benjamin, for the engagement of new forms of representation in architectural endeavours. Two of the three essays devoted to twentieth-century topics pursue spatial poetics in architecture by invoking other artistic disciplines. Michel Moussette eloquently describes the accomplishments of Gordon MattaClark, whose architectural interventions and literal deconstructions have defied categorization. Continuing the series of reflections on dramatic, xi\n\nPreface\n\ncinematic, and architectural spaces that have appeared in previous volumes of chora, including his own work on Tarkovsky’s Nostalgia in volume 1, Juhani Pallasmaa offers a reading of Alfred Hitchcock’s Rear Window, a film that has now attained cult status in some architectural circles. Closing this trilogy on twentieth-century “architects,” David Theodore explores ethical/formal questions in the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, the philosopher of language whose concerns have often been regarded as naturally kindred to those of architects. Theodore pays careful attention to Wittgenstein’s involvement in actual architectural tasks and draws some unexpected and fascinating conclusions.\n\nxii\n\nLewis Carroll, A Man out of Joint: The Anonymous Architect of Euclid’s Retreat Caroline Dionne\n\nChora\n\nLewis Carroll, A Man out of Joint\n\na\n\nV E RY\n\nnarrow wall\n\n“When I use a word,” Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, “it means just what I choose it to mean – neither more nor less.” “The question is,” said Alice, “whether you can make words mean so many different things.” “The question is,” said Humpty Dumpty, “which is to be master – that’s all … They’ve a temper, some of them – particularly verbs, they’re the proudest – adjectives you can do anything with, but not verbs – however, I can manage the whole of them! Impenetrability! That’s what I say!”1\n\nHumpty Dumpty is sitting on a very high, narrow wall. It is indeed a precarious situation that nonetheless allows him to claim a kind of mastery over words. Unlike Humpty Dumpty, we shall never completely restrain the words’ plurality of meanings; the words will always evoke much more than what we want them to say – or much less. Because language is polysemic, there is an ambiguity that cannot be resolved. A language is a system. Any system, no matter how complex it may appear, always circumscribes a certain field or realm – a world. The rest is left outside, rejected or not addressed. It is the beauty of systems to be self-sufficient. In our “modern” attitude there is a tendency to step outside a system in order to build, just beside it, another one that is antagonistic to the former. The union of those two systems then constitutes another system. However, there may be a way to avoid delusion. It is possible to enter a system, work within its limits (precisely at the limit) and create a new component (a critique) that induces a slight movement. In the mind, in the imagination, all antagonistic systems can coexist, and it is the attribute of poetry to reveal such paradoxes. The paradox (para-doxai) is an image of “reality.”2 It is an ambivalent and somehow disturbing expression of the real. Language and geometry may be more than systems, and there may be a link, however oblique and tenuous, between art and science that coincides with the land of geometry. In our world, space and time are paradoxical notions; their geometrical behaviour is perplexing. By looking at the transformations of Euclidean geometry in the work of Lewis Carroll and focusing on the border as a place to dwell, we shall investigate the “making” of space.\n\n2\n\nCaroline Dionne\n\na nonsense in movement The shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious things – but the oddest part of it was that, whenever she looked hard at any shelf, to make out exactly what it had on it, that particular shelf was always quite empty, though the others round it were crowded as full as they could hold.3\n\nIn the realm of nonsense and absurdity, Lewis Carroll was a pioneer.4 His work reveals the paradoxical nature of meaning, the actual coexistence of unrelated or antagonistic notions. Nonsense should not be understood as an absence of meaning but rather as a surplus of sens, a combination of opposite directions (sens) and meanings (sens) that coexist. Between these opposites there is necessarily a limit – a point, a plane, a body; a certain Humpty Dumpty sitting on a very narrow wall – that separates both. It is in between and therefore cannot be fixed; it moves, it transforms itself, or else it appears to be fixed, but only for a certain time, because the mind always oscillates between the two sides. In a sense, this is Humpty Dumpty’s tragic end. The limit is always becoming; it is the site of events. A pure becoming can never be achieved, because it would then be.5 Nonsense expresses this coexistence of opposites but also reveals the opposition, and therefore, presents the dichotomy. Nonsense, approached in such terms, would be the linguistic expression of our paradoxical encounter with the world. Paul Valéry\n\nGeometric behaviour:The dancing ostrich. From “Lewis Carroll logicien,” a postface by Ernest Coumet to Lewis Carroll, “Logique sans peine,” Oeuvres (Paris: Robert Laffont 1989)\n\n3\n\nLewis Carroll, A Man out of Joint\n\nevoked this encounter in similar terms. The soul of man follows the movement of an irreal dance. The beautiful dancer represents both form and idea and can be perceived only in movement. Phaedrus: She is dancing yonder and gives to the eyes what you are trying to tell us … She makes the instant to be seen … She filches from nature impossible attitudes, even under the very eye of Time! … And Time lets himself be fooled … She passes through the absurd with impunity … She is divine in the unstable, offers it as a gift to our regard! … Eryximachus: Instant engenders form, and form makes the instant visible. Phaedrus: She flees her shadow up into the air. Socrates: We never see her but about to fall.6\n\nThere is an immense distance, yet a wonderful proximity, between the realm of Ideas and our perception of the world. There is a land in between that Plato would call “space.” The limit is a space – an interstitial space. The space of the limit has no magnitude, yet it is a space, a land, the land of geometry. This space does not exist, it becomes – or else, it allows for things to happen. It is between the words and the things, yet it is what constitutes both. In essence? In fact? It is hidden inside the things and at the surface of things. Through language – through speech – this entre-deux is uttered at a certain moment and becomes real. Geometry participates in that utterance. It evinces a common desire to describe, to reveal, to order. the land of geometry “While you’re refreshing yourself,” said the Queen, “I’ll just take the measurements.” And she took a ribbon out of her pocket, marked in inches, and began measuring the ground, and sticking little pegs in here and there. “At the end of two yards,” she said, putting in a peg to mark the distance, “I shall give you your directions.”7\n\nGeometry occupies a central position in the development of Western philosophy, both in the way it tends to be related to the expression of ideas – its inextricability from language – and in the way we construct meaning and understand these ideas, somehow, in geometrical (or mathemat4\n\nCaroline Dionne\n\nical) terms.8 Virtually, we tend to organize fragments of thoughts, to give a shape to an idea or to “build” a structure around it. We make our point, we follow a line (of thought), and eventually we get caught in a circular argument. In this process the participation of the geometrical and mathematical realms is implicit. Numbers and geometric figures were understood from the time of the early Greek philosophers until the nineteenth century as mediators between the world of man and higher instances: they constituted a way to access knowledge. This strange interference of both the geometrical and the mathematical realms in human thinking led the most ancient philosophers to believe that man’s soul could be a number moving itself.9 Geometry has a privileged status in the history of architectural theory and practice. From Vitruvius until the end of the eighteenth century, geometry is discussed prominently in all architectural treatises. Its status gradually changes until it becomes, in the late eighteenth century, a mere instrument of applied technology, as it appears in the work of Durand.10 From a conception that posits geometry as an art – something that mediates between the human and the divine – we then come to an understanding of geometry as a tool for the use of the architect. In the mind of the engineer/architects who followed Durand’s précis, geometry became a design mechanism, an extremely simplified geometrical object: a grid on which plans, sections, and elevations could be drawn with efficiency. In the realm of our contemporary architectural practice, ambiguity of language – in drawings and in written forms – is generally avoided and architects tend to accept, uncritically, the rules of systematic geometrical descriptions as part of the design discipline; they use geometry as a tool regardless of its relation to philosophy and language. The architectural “grid” continues to be used as a tool for design in most architecture schools. “Geometry is the Science of Measuring the Land.” In his Mathematical Praeface to the Books of Euclid, published in 1570, John Dee gives us a definition of this Arte Mathematical. But what land, exactly, does geometry measure? Dee refers to remote times and places and to the wars and injustices that took place when man started to measure and divide the earthly ground, creating frontiers and naming pieces of land that became his property or the property of a nation. “Till, by Gods mercy, and mans Industry, The perfect Science of Lines, Plaines, and Solides (like a divine Justicer) gave unto every man, his owne [land].”11 5\n\nLewis Carroll, A Man out of Joint\n\nDee defines both the mathematical and the geometric entities. His definitions reveal the paradoxical interval occupied by Euclidean geometry. For, these beyng (in a maner) middle, betwene thinges supernaturall and naturall: are not so absolute and excellent, as thinges supernatural: nor yet so base and grosse as things natural: But are thinges immateriall: and neverthelesse, by materiall things able somewhat to be signified. And though their particular Images, by Art, are aggregable and divisible: yet the generall Formes, notwithstandyng, are constant, unchangeable, untrãsformable and incorruptible. Neither of the sense, can they, at any tyme, be perceived or judged. Nor yet, for all that, in the royall mynde of man, first conceived … A merveylous newtralitie have these thinges Mathematicall and also a strãge participatiõ betwene thinges supernaturall, immortall, intellectual, simple, and indivisible: and thynges naturall, mortall, sensible, compounded and divisible.12\n\nThe three realms of “things” are different and remain distant, even though they constantly interact. It is precisely in this “in between” constituted by geometry that man can reach the idea of infinity. All Magnitude, is either a Line, a Plaine or a Solid. Which Line, Plaine or Solid, of no Sense, can be perceived, nor exactly by hãd (any way) represented: nor of Nature produced: But, as (by degrees) Number did come to our perceiverance: So, by visible formes, we are holpen [helped] to imagine, what our Line Mathematical, is. What our point, is. So precise, are our Magnitudes, that one Line is no broader than an other: for they have no bredth: Nor our Plaines have any thicknes. Nor yet our Bodies, any weight: be they never so large of dimensiõ. Our Bodyes, we can have Smaller, than either Arte or Nature can produce any: and Greater also, than all the world can comprehend.13\n\nIn the modern era, geometry was gradually transformed by the development of infinitesimal calculus in the seventeenth and eighteenth century and ultimately by the new geometries that developed in the nineteenth century and began to be “applied” in Dodgson’s time.14 The notion of geometric infinity was gradually appropriated by modern man. As the possibilities of knowledge became infinite, the world of man was also extended to infinity. Once infinity became part of the world, the geometrician sought to describe not only the simple ideal figures of Euclidean geometry but all possible figures in the conic sections between 6\n\nCaroline Dionne\n\nthese ideals. In the mind of the scientist the mathematical formulas became accurate “models” of reality: the whole of creation could be described in algebraic terms.15 The universe, according to this concept, is there to be deciphered and understood through mathematics and scientific experiments. The language of science attempts to resolve the distance between the words and what they describe; geometry undergoes instrumentalization. In the scientific milieu of the nineteenth century, Euclidean geometry was not rejected outright. Rather, it became a particular instrument, one of many, within a broader and more generalized geometry that claimed to explain every phenomenon. Euclidean principles have also tended to be misconceived. Today they are understood as stiff, instrumental, and systematized explanations of reality, while nonEuclidean geometries are seen as new formal realms that describe reality and the universe more accurately. In the nineteenth century the scientific utopia became reality. Scientists in specialized and autonomous disciplines participated with great enthusiasm in the scientific endeavour; for them it was the only way to find the true nature of the world. The episode of the “Map of the Ocean” in Lewis Carroll’s famous poem The Hunting of the Snark is quite telling in this regard: He had bought a large map representing the sea, Without the least vestige of land: And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be A map they could all understand. “What’s the good of Mercator’s North Poles and Equators, Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?” So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply, “They are merely conventional signs!” “Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes! But we’ve got our brave Captain to thank” (So the crew would protest) “that he bought us the best – A perfect and absolute blank!”16\n\nThe man of the industrial revolution, this man of science, ventured into unknown territory, leaving behind all points of reference from the 7\n\n“Ocean Chart.” From Lewis Carroll, The Hunting of the Snark: An Agony in Eight Fits (London: Macmillan 1876)\n\npast. The scientific endeavour became frightening once its abstract concepts were equated to or supplanted lived experience. The real that we know through mathematical models is an approximation of reality, but it claims to be more real than experience itself. In Sylvie and Bruno, Carroll’s intricate novel, a certain German professor entertains the children with a map of his town on which everything was marked down. The map measured one mile on each side, and reading it was quite problematic, because the map, when totally open, would cast a shadow over the farmers’ crops. It was then decided that the land itself would serve as a map: indeed an ingenious idea. The “image” thus acquires a value equivalent to the reality it was intended to evoke. The industrial revolution was a theatre of technological innovation in which machines were developed at a disorienting pace: utensils that would simplify the lives of men. 8\n\nCaroline Dionne\n\nAs this new status of technology reached architecture, buildings also became utensils. As a result of this direct link between words and things, the language of poetry loses its value of truth. Myths and poetry – story-telling through works of art – are no longer understood as means of rendering the world habitable. But, as Borges explains, There is no basic [essentielle] dissimilarity between the metaphor and what scientists call the explanation of a phenomenon. They both constitute a link established between distinct things … Hence, when a geometrician asserts that the moon is a quantity that develops in three dimensions, his means of expression is no less metaphorical than that of Nietzsche, who prefers to define the same moon as a cat walking on top of the roofs.17\n\nIf we follow Borges’s argument, the scientific truths are equally deceptive and, like myths and poetry, remain temporary and fragile; they are continuously shaken by the new problems that appear to the scientist. The archaic meaning of the word “truth” indicates an ethical dimension: to be true in one’s action, character, or utterance; to be sincere.18 But the modern scientific mind is concerned more with whether a statement is true or false, even though this may be irrelevant to a deep comprehension of things. Hypotheses must find proofs. Observed effects must have corresponding causes. All of this could have started when geometricians decided to prove Euclid’s axiom about parallel lines. Some Euclidean principles, regardless of how paradoxical they may appear to the modern reader, had not needed to be proven. The definitions of the point and the line, for example, were “given.” In our tactile experience, in which hands follow the edges of a table, parallel lines do not meet. For the eyes, looking toward the horizon, they do meet. For the painter, willing to create an image that would convey a sense of the real, they do meet on the canvas. For Euclid, in this entre-deux occupied by geometry, parallel lines are parallel, and therefore they do not meet. “But who would need parallel lines to meet,” wrote Dodgson in Euclid and His Modern Rivals. For some nineteenth-century geometricians, they meet somewhere at infinity, and because infinity has become part of the world, they meet somewhere in the thickness of the trace left by the pen – or at the South Pole. From a chosen angle, from a certain point of view, either they meet or they don’t, but the mind, the imagination, is able to travel very fast, 9\n\nLewis Carroll, A Man out of Joint\n\nencompassing all imaginable points of view. Valéry wrote, “And is not the true the natural frontier of the intelligence?”19 In the work of the poet the two opposite situations can coexist at this frontier and “touch” each other. Might it be the task of the artist to reveal such paradoxes, allowing us to seize their evocative beauty? The word “task” suggests an ethical dimension that remains outside the “good or bad” dichotomy. For poetic language to escape from methodological application, it must speak about something common. Poetry does not follow a linear path but one that is discontinuous and fragmented. Poetry is not limited to literature and art. Even modern technology has this potential for poetic expression, rather than being strictly a burden.20 Carroll’s work expresses the scientific dependence on this mode of thought. Both sides of his work come together in the way he criticizes the pragmatism of Victorian society with its scientific mind-set and fallacies.21 Created through nonsense and humour, his work is resistant to a complete analysis or demystification and cannot be exhausted by any literary movement. It oscillates within the thin line that connects Romanticism and Surrealism and separates art from science.22 His work unhinges a concept of time that reduces it to quantity (associated with money) and a concept of space as a homogeneous set of coordinates. It participates simultaneously in the modern scientific debate and the realm of fiction and poetic imagination. Lewis Carroll’s work demonstrates the tight link between these two modes of thought – the “art-science” interdependence – and this is also a key to understanding the transformations of architectural thinking since the beginning of modernity. a big revolving door Alice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with the time,” she said, “than wasting it in asking riddles that have no answers.” “If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk about wasting it. It’s him.”23\n\nSince the Hatter and the March Hare quarreled with Time, he won’t do a thing they ask (with the clock). Since then, it has always been six o’clock – tea-time – and the trio is constantly moving around the table. Alice then ventures to ask, “But [what happens] when you come to the 10\n\nCaroline Dionne\n\nbeginning again?” “Suppose we change the subject,” the March Hare interrupts, yawning.24 Space and time are intricate notions. Our concept of such notions has undergone successive transformations within the tradition of Western philosophy. Changing interpretations of the Euclidean principles may have something to do with these transformations. In some ancient mythologies, space and time were gods that could not be separated: they were two expressions of the same order.25 In their concept of the world, space was not a preexisting and autonomous entity. It had to be ordered and created, but mostly it had to be kept alive and recreated now and then.26 Space and time were works of art. So-called Cartesian space has lost this qualitative aspect; it is a homogeneous, infinite set of combinations of coordinates. It is a quantity that can be measured and reduced to horizontal and vertical planes and intersections. Cartesian time is a quantitative and autonomous notion that is no longer dependent on – or predicated on – space. In homogenized space, horizontality, verticality, and depth are equivalent, with no particular qualitative aspect.27 A tower is the same as a tunnel. In The Vision of the Three T’s, Dodgson criticizes the modern concept of space as homogeneous, removed from time and without gravity. In the story an architect arrives at a construction site dressed in an outfit that he claims is atemporal, completely outside the transience of fashion, with ribbons that defy gravity. He can find inspiration in a piece of stilton; the materiality of the building is irrelevant. Cheese or stone, it is all the same; only form matters.28 In a concept of space as something that preexists, the wall becomes a denuded limit that subdivides space. Notions of temporality and the evanescence of things are eclipsed. When time is removed from space – as in basement spaces lit by artificial light (the first space into which Alice advances after falling down slowly in the tunnel) – space becomes frightening, as if it were created by something overwhelming and horrifying, something entirely other.29 The cyclic nature of archaic times cannot be retrieved. In order to express this transformation of the concept of time, Gilles Deleuze writes, using a verse from Shakespeare’s Hamlet, Time is out of joint, time is unhinged. The hinges are the axis on which the door turns. The hinge, Cardo, indicates the subordination of time to precise cardinal points, through which the periodic movements it measures pass. As 11\n\nLewis Carroll, A Man out of Joint\n\nlong as time remains on its hinges, it is subordinated to extensive movement; it is the measure of movement, its interval or number. This characteristic of ancient philosophy has often been emphasized: the subordination of time to the circular movement of the world as the turning door, a revolving door, a labyrinth opening onto its eternal origin.30\n\nIn the modern era, the geometric figure of the concept of time changes, or else it is observed from a different point of view. Time and movement remain in a close relationship, but the roles are inverted. It is now movement which is subordinated to time … Time thus becomes unilinear and rectilinear, no longer in the sense that it would measure a derived movement, but in and through itself, insofar as it imposes the succession of its determination on every possible movement. It ceases to be cardinal and becomes ordinal, the order of an empty time … The labyrinth takes on a new look – neither a circle nor a spiral, but a thread, a pure straight line, all the more mysterious in that it is simple, inexorable, terrible.31\n\nDeleuze makes a reference to Borges; the labyrinth is inexorable because it is “the labyrinth made of a single straight line which is indivisible, incessant.”32 Today, the big revolving door of time is out of its joints, off its hinges, fragmented, dislocated, no longer following a circular path in space. The time is out of humour – out of himself. Time as we now tend to conceive it is the linear time of modern history. The time line extends infinitely in both directions. But there can be a double reading of time. Time can be conceived as both linear and cyclical. On the one hand, time is a constant repetition of the same present. On the other hand, there is nothing but the past, always subsisting, and the future, always insisting. In between is the same limit, the geometric space of the event. Meaning consists precisely in this event; it is always becoming: always so close and yet so remote. This site of action may be the logos of the encounter of space and time. Both the linear and the cyclical dimensions are expressed in the timespace fragments in the Alices. Alice falls into the depths of the earth but progressively returns to the world of the surface, reconquers space and time, and creates spaces that allow for things to happen: in-between spaces. The spaces that Alice experiences are always different expressions of the same space. These spaces oscillate between worlds that are 12\n\nCaroline Dionne\n\ndifferent but equally real. The limit, the borderline between these worlds, contains – or becomes, itself – another world. The limit cannot be reduced to a plane; it expands into a zone. This limit is actually where things happen, where the passage of time is traced. The perception of space is not impassive, it implicates one’s surroundings and one’s state of distraction or concentration. But mostly it involves the postures that the body adopts in movement, mood, bodily humours, and humour. The perceiver is not in space. Space does not preexist. The perceiver, like Alice, is actually creating spaces: a succession of time-space fragments that cannot be isolated but constitute a continuous becoming.\n\nAlice is caught in space. From Lewis Carroll, Alice’s Adventures under Ground (London: Macmillan 1886)\n\nIf time is conceived through movement and rhythm and is rendered visible by light and shadows, then light is not simply another material for instrumental use by the architect. Light is the life of objects. Even though space is bound to time and human perception, the materiality of the building does not disappear: it is what one perceives. Things come together in a kind of nonfixity, a flow, a tide. The rhythm is created by a succession of material aggregates and silences. The rhythmic matter is continuously transforming itself. In Lewis Carroll’s work the characters of the books are continuously transforming themselves, successively becoming other. The same phenomenon happens to the reader. As Octavio Paz notes in The Bow and the Lyre, Lewis Carroll’s prose becomes poetry through its rhythmic 13\n\nIllustrations by Max Ernst for the French translation by Henri Parisot of The Hunting of the Snark show the frequent transformations of the characters in Lewis Carroll’s work: the hyperbolic Bellman appears differently in each of these illustrations.

The reader is continuously recreating these images, following the rhythm of the poem that not only invokes his imagination but puts his whole body into a different posture. According to Paz, this enables the space of the book to emerge into the world. Even though Lewis Carroll’s work expresses almost everything through nonsense, the spatial-rhythmic quality of his writing conveys a deeper meaning. We comprehend it; we are comprehended by it.33 If the construction of the story is good, it calls for a real participation of the reader-speaker who builds, in a rhythmic and corporeal manner, a meaning. This can be called a ritournelle.34 Our perception of built space has to do with the common activities that it shelters; with that ritournelle whistled by our body, every day, in the successive depths of this rhythm-space. We inhabit and tame architecture in order to make it belong to us, who belong to it. We render it familiar and eventually construct a meaning dancing a ronde within the walls. 16\n\nCaroline Dionne\n\nNow we are at home. But home does not preexist: it was necessary to draw a circle around that uncertain and fragile centre, to organise a limited space … Sonorous and vocal components are very important: a wall of sound, or at least a wall with some sonic bricks in it … From chaos, milieus and rhythms are born. This is the concern of very ancient cosmogonies … Every milieu is vibratory, in other words, a block of space-time constituted by the periodic repetition of the component.35\n\nSpace is not perceived in a homogeneous way. Some stanzas of a poem become more familiar, while others remain obscure. We bring together these perceived spatial fragments, but not in a rational way. Instead we follow a logic of nonsense, as in the oneiric creation of a story. It is the alternation of “known” territories and “less-known” spaces that creates a rhythm.36 It is this difference that possesses the primary rhythm, although repetition is also rhythmic.37 The difference is again this “inbetween,” this limit. It is again the land of geometry.\n\nDum and Dee, drawing by Franklin Hughes.

They sound, they appear completely new, new-born. Language ceases to be a fixed system but is conceived as growing continuously into something else: a language that is alive. Words enter into a dance, they play, and sometimes they eat each other: Snark! Lewis Carroll wrote for children, or to be more precise, on behalf of children, putting into words their fascinating vision of the world.38 In the same way, we could say that Lewis Carroll wrote for Euclid, on his behalf, trying to express the essence of geometry, its unquestionable truths. In the Alices, geometric figures become characters. Space and time also become characters; they speak to us, revealing to the reader their paradoxical nature. Euclid finds, in Wonderland, a retreat where he can escape from his modern rivals and possibly enter into a dialogue with the new geometries. Between fiction and the real, between day and night, in this space of ambiguity, opposites come together and our perception becomes what it always was: a hallucinatory experience. The limit, the border, is a world of possibles.\n\n18\n\nCaroline Dionne\n\nnotes\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 4\n\n5\n\n6 7 8\n\nThis essay is based on a speech I gave at The Lewis Carroll Phenomenon – An Interdisciplinary and International Centenary Conference for the Centenary of the Death of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, at the University of Wales, Cardiff, in April 1998.

The Latin doxai can be translated into English as “opinion.” In that sense a paradox can be understood as being contrary to common sense or commonly accepted opinions, or at least as questioning the common sense. Carroll, Through the Looking Glass, 253. The work of Lewis Carroll follows a logic of nonsense that is expressed through different means. The nonsensical particle can be a word that circulates and connects odd notions. It can also be a portmanteau (a word created from the meanings of different words, such as “mimsy,” which is “flimsy” and “miserable”). In some texts, the whole structure of the tale follows a logic of nonsense: two stories move in different rhythms on each side of an odd limit. On these literary processes, see Gilles Deleuze, The Logic of Sense, trans. Mark Lester and Charles Stivale (New York: Columbia University Press 1990). Plato emphasizes this dualism between being and becoming when he writes in the Parmenides, “the younger becoming older than the older, the older becoming younger than the younger – but they can never finally become so; if they did they would no longer be becoming, but would be so.” See Plato, Parmenides 154–5, trans.

But the logos it measures remains mysterious and somehow original to all origins. John Dee, The Mathematical Praeface to the Elements of Euclid (of Megara) (London: John Day 1570), 4. In this passage Dee expresses the primordial status of mathematics and geometry in human affairs; he refers to the most ancient philosophers but unfortunately does not give more precision to the identity of these thinkers. As Alberto Pérez-Gómez and Louise Pelletier explain, “Durand’s mécanisme de la composition supported his new rational and specialized theory, free from metaphysical speculations … In his précis, Durand expressed the notion that architects should be unconcerned with meaning; if the architectural problem was efficiently solved, meaning would follow … The aim was to represent the project objectively; the subjective observer we associate with perspective’s point of view was consistently ignored.” Architectural Representation and the Perspective Hinge (Cambridge, ma, and London: mit Press 1997), 298–9. Dee, The Mathematical Praeface, 14. Ibid., 2. Ibid., 13. Even though infinitesimal calculus was important for the development of non-Euclidean geometries, the changes remained at the level of ideas until the end of the eighteenth century. The link between infinitesimal calculus and metaphysical notions is explicit in the work of Leibniz. We perceive a kind of transposition in his work of the paradoxical notion of time (both linear and cyclical) to a more general notion of space, or to be more precise, of our perception of space. His work also evinces how ideas create images in the mind: it illustrates how geometry participates in our understanding of complex notions. See Leibniz, Monadology, in G.W. Leibniz: Philosophical Essays, ed. and trans. Roger Ariew and Daniel Garber (Indianapolis and Cambridge: Hackett Publishing 1989), 213–15. Algebra is an absolute language, and its signs no longer refer to reality. It is an abstract language in which numbers do not have symbolic values. Even infinity (∞) becomes a number for the mere end of solving mathematical problems.

My translation. Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (1993), s.v. “true.” Paul Valéry, “Dialogue of the Tree,” in Collected Works, vol. 4, 168. In this sentence, intelligence should be understood not strictly as the intellectual capacity but rather as the possibility to distinguish, to perceive, to understand. In that sense what is true is always what separates opposites and cannot be found on either of the sides; it lies in the acknowledgment of the difference. It is not surprising that scientists currently interested in quantum physics might see Lewis Carroll as a precursor. Physicists are now acknowledging the inevitable temporality of phenomena. The notion of time becomes essential once their aim is not only to describe an instant (a picture or a model of reality) but to comprehend a phenomenon (which cannot be described with the same equation in two temporal directions). Poetic language, the language of metaphors, is needed to describe the qualitative aspects of the successive transformations of matter. These physicists are trying to describe phenomena that are not very large or infinitesimally small but phenomena that occur in between, in the world of everyday life. These phenomena cannot be idealized; their appearance and tangibility are unavoidable, and therefore, their temporality becomes part of the equation; even the formula or algorithm is time-bound and always in transformation. C.S. Peirce (1839–1914), Lewis Carroll’s contemporary, formulated the first principle of pragmatism: “One’s concept of the effects of a thing are equivalent to one’s concept of the thing itself.” This maxim is the methodological basis of conceptual analysis. The eventual analysis of these concepts (intellectualized consequences of action) can be confronted with reality through experience (intellectual and practical experimentation); this reasoning is called abduction. Peirce formulated the triadic relation of the sign to its object, where every concept of being is mediated through the intellectualization of the interpreting consciousness. In the end, truth is what is accepted by a community of scientists after careful experiments and abductions. (What I tell you three times is true.) Throughout his work, Carroll tries to show the inherent circularity of such logic. See C.S. Peirce, Collected Papers, vol. 5 (Cambridge: Harvard University Press 1934), 1, 90–3, 186.\n\n21\n\nLewis Carroll, A Man out of Joint\n\n22 Paz expresses this idea of a romanticism that is not merely nostalgic for the past or a reactionary attitude against the industrial revolution and the scientific mind-set but a romanticism that is trying to reconcile the mythos and the logos. Such movements as Romanticism and Surrealism are visions of the world that can travel underground, through history, and reappear when they are least expected. Octavio Paz, The Bow and the Lyre (Austin, tx: University of Texas Press 1973); see chapter 8 and especially 154–5. 23 “Why is a raven like a writing desk?” The famous riddle was never answered in the story itself or by its author. Lewis Carroll, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, in The Annotated Alice, 97. 24 Ibid., 99–101. 25 In Greek mythology, Hermes and Hestia are gods that form a strange couple, or as Jean-Pierre Vernant says, “a problematic couple.” They are often depicted together, tightly associated with each other, but unlike the other divine couples, “they are not husband and wife … or brother and sister … or mother and son … or protector and protected.” Rather, they seem bound together through their common friendship (philia) with mortal human beings. Hermes and Hestia, unlike the other gods who have their own realm in Olympus, are gods that dwell on earth amongst men, and for that reason are tightly linked to “earth.” Hestia is associated with the centre of spaces, with the circular fireplace (hestia) at the centre of the house. She is the symbol of stability, of immutability, of unity: the central point, the one, from which all points of the sphere of the celestial bodies – the cosmos – are equidistant. On the other hand, Hermes is the god that symbolizes movement. “If he manifests himself at the surface of the earth and, with Hestia, dwells in the houses of mortals, Hermes does so in the fashion of a messenger.” He is everywhere and nowhere, ubiquitous and ungraspable, associated with doors and roads, with all the spaces and actions that exist outside the stability of the house. “If they make a couple … it is because the two divinities are situated on the same plane, because their actions are applicable at the level of the real, because the functions that they fulfill are connected … It can be said that the couple Hermes-Hestia expresses, in its polarity, the tension that can be read in the archaic representation of space: space necessitates a centre, a fixed point that possesses a specific value and from which directions can be oriented and defined, all qualitatively different; but space presents itself, at the same time, as the place for movement which implies a possibility for transition and passage, from any point to any other point … Hestia is able to ‘cen22\n\nCaroline Dionne\n\n26 27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n31 32\n\n33\n\ntralize’ space … Hermes is able to ‘set space in movement’ [‘mobiliser’ l’espace].” See Jean-Pierre Vernant, Mythe et pensée chez les grecs (Paris: François Maspero 1969), 97–101. My translation. The earthly ground remained somehow chaotic and unpredictable compared to the visible order of the celestial bodies. As Maurice Merleau-Ponty explains in Phenomenology of Perception, our experience of height is very different from that of horizontal distances, and depth is perceived (in movement) not just through vision but also through touch, smell, hearing, and taste. The link between perception and reason (body and mind) and between man and the world involves our temporal existence. Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Phenomenology of Perception, trans. Colin Smith (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul 1962), 255. It is interesting to read here the influence of John Ruskin, for whom the encounter of the human sensibility and the work of art was of great importance. Ruskin was defending such an attitude against pragmatism. For him the materiality of architecture was primordial: one should ask the stone what it has to say. A stone could tell the story of how it was crafted and could reveal the passage of time upon its face. But what we make of this story is itself another story. See John Ruskin, The Stones of Venice (London: Collins 1960). On this notion of “same, different and other,” see Paul Ricoeur, The Conflict of Interpretation: Essays in Hermeneutics, ed. Don Ihde (Evanston, il: Northwestern University Press 1974). Gilles Deleuze, Essays Critical and Clinical, trans. Daniel W. Smith and Michael A. Greco (Minneapolis, mn: University of Minnesota Press 1997), 27. Ibid., 28. The ancient labyrinth is a vivid demonstration of this union of time and space. It is circular and is bound to the space created by the dance and its rhythm. There is an entry and an exit, a beginning and an end, but it expresses the constant “being lost” of life itself. The modern labyrinth can be imagined as an infinite line, as is admirably described in Borges’s Fictions. See Borges, “Death and the Compass,” in Labyrinths (New York: New Directions Books 1962), 87. Merleau-Ponty uses this sentence from Pascal’s Pensées: “Je comprend le monde et le monde me comprend.” In the English version to which I am referring, the translator uses the word understanding: “I understand the world … it understands me.” The French meaning of the word is double: 23\n\nLewis Carroll, A Man out of Joint\n\n34\n\n35 36\n\n37 38\n\n24\n\nit can mean “understanding” in an intellectualized way, but it can also mean “to comprehend” in a physical way, that is, “to circumscribe” or “to encompass.” The rhythmic aspect of our perception of spatio-temporal fragments is similar to the rhythm involved while reading a story, a rhythm that affects our bodily postures and generates the “space” of the book. See Merleau-Ponty, Phenomenology of Perception, 408. The ritournelle is a round or a nursery rhyme; in the translation of Mille plateaux the word “refrain” is used. See Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, trans. Brian Massumi (Minneapolis, mn: University of Minnesota Press 1987), chapter 11; in French, Mille plateaux: Capitalisme et schizophrénie 2 (Paris: Minuit 1980). Ibid., 311–13. It is in such territories that we can walk at night and find our way without seeing anything. It is in such space that we happen to know every detail of a wall, the very disposition of each object. On this notion of rhythm in the ritournelle, see Deleuze and Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, 314. As Gilles Deleuze remarks, “To write is not to recount one’s memories and travels, one’s loves and griefs, one’s dreams and fantasies … The ultimate aim of literature is to set free, in the delirium, this creation of a health or this invention of a people, that is, a possibility of life. To write for this people who are missing.” See Deleuze, Essays Critical and Clinical, 4.\n\nThe Breath on the Mirror: Notes on Ruskin’s Theory of the Grotesque Mark Dorrian\n\nChora\n\nRuskin’s Theory of the Grotesque\n\nthis paper has its origins in an extended footnote to an essay that attempted to theorize the historical relationship between the terms “monstrous” and “grotesque.”1 Its focus is on certain metaphors (it is concerned specifically with references to the breath, to the mirror, and to the Fall) that Ruskin deploys in his theory of the grotesque, as expounded in volume 3 of The Stones of Venice.2 The paper emerges from two basic questions: what is the relationship between monstrosity (and, more generally, “form”) and the breath as it appears in Ruskin’s account of the grotesque, and how does the “monstrous” operate within the system of categories that structures Ruskin’s text? It concludes by sketching a connection between Ruskin’s metaphorics and his early enthusiasm for the daguerreotype photographic process. A peculiar trait that writers often display is a tendency to describe their books as children. An interesting and not uncommon variant occurs when they consider these children to be in some way bad-born: perhaps defectively conceived, wayward, ill-starred, or even monstrous. So, for example, David Hume, reflecting upon the commercial failure of his Treatise of Human Nature, described it as falling “dead-born from the press”;3 and the anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, in an interview with Paul Ricoeur, confessed, “It seems to me that a book is always something of a prematurely born child and mine strike me as quite repugnant creatures compared with what I would have liked to have brought into the world, and of which I do not feel too proud when they are exposed to the sight of others.”4 Probably the best-known statement of this kind, however, is in Mary Shelley’s 1831 introduction to Frankenstein, written for a reprinting of the novel: “And now, once again, I bid my hideous progeny go forth and prosper. I have an affection for it, for it was the offspring of happy days, when death and grief were but words, which found no true echo in my heart.”5 This introduction was produced by Shelley in answer to a request from her publisher for an account of how her book came to be written. In it she recalled the events of that wet summer spent by Lake Geneva, when Byron challenged the four of them (Mary Godwin, Percy Shelley, John Polidori, and Byron himself) to write a ghost story. She describes how, in the days leading up to the nightmare that prompted the writing of the book, she had read from a collection of German ghost stories. One of these in particular had gripped her: the tale of a ghostly\n\n26\n\nMark Dorrian\n\npatriarch who was fated to destroy the younger sons of his descendants. He came to them as they slept in their cots and, bending over, kissed them, and “from that hour [they] withered like flowers snapped upon the stalk.”6 In this story there is something of the vampire, the creature who, through the kiss, sucks away the sap, the blood, the life-force. In his study of the vampire myth in Romantic literature, James Twitchell has noted that while tales of the blood-sucking monster may have appeared in England by the eighth century, the word “vampire” is not evident in English writing until the early 1700s.7 In fact, the first British vampire novel was to be John Polidori’s The Vampyre (1819), published three years after that summer in Switzerland. We should note at this stage the character of the vampire as a liminal figure who has a special relationship with the mirror (which tells the “truth” of the creature): it is both alive and dead and neither alive nor dead. It is a creature that both collapses and lives between categories. The imperative is not to kill it (which is impossible as it is not alive) but to resolve it. Venice has a similar liminal status (between death and life) and a similar vampiric character. Twitchell stresses the extent to which narratives of the female vampire (or “lamia”) turn on seduction: usually a young man encounters “an older supernatural temptress who somehow drains his energy, leaving him weak and desperate.”8 Certainly to Ruskin writing in his later years, it seemed that this city (to which he had devoted so much of his life and energy and which he had once wanted to draw, as he wrote of St Mark’s, “stone by stone – to eat it all up into my mind – touch by touch”) had seduced and distracted him.9 He wished, he wrote in his 1883 epilogue to Modern Painters III, that he had never seen Venice, “seen her, that is to say, with man’s eyes” (4:352). I regard it, he said in the autobiographical Praeterita, “more and more as a vain temptation” (35:296). His closing words on the sea-city recall his reflections on the sirens, who, he had earlier argued, were, in the Homeric conception, “phantoms of vain desire,” demons of the imagination (and hence of the desire, not of the ears, but of the eyes) whose song, whose breath, poisons and withers (17:212–14).10 With the kiss we are within a thematics of the “breath,” a pneumatology (where pneuma is “breath” or “spirit”). If the breath is the medium by which something “foreign” passes into the body (whether\n\n27\n\nRuskin’s Theory of the Grotesque\n\ninspiration or contagion), it is also the means by which something might be drawn out or confiscated. The phantom that Shelley described acts out a demonic inversion of divine “inspiration,” the breathing-into that animates base material (“clay” or, as St Augustine described it, “slime”) and that reappears as motivated and intentional speech. When the breath is withdrawn, the body falls to putrefaction, decay, and, to associate it in advance with an aesthetic category, decadence. In some ways, then, this seems aligned with the Judas-kiss that betrays, that consigns to death, and that appears, as we shall see, as a “species of monstrosity” in its perversion of the divine kiss. In his historical study of the kiss, Nicholas Perella stresses its relationship to the idea of the unification or fusion of two within one: this hinges, he argues, on the set of concepts and values associated with breath. Breath is not just a point of connection between one human being and another; it is also the point of communion between mankind and the divine. In the Symposium Plato mentions “that courage which, as Homer says, the god breathes into the souls of some heroes, Love of his own nature infuses into the lover.”11 As Perella puts it, “we are led to consider with sympathy that theory which holds that the kiss has its origins in the magical idea of the infusion of a power or the exchange or union of ‘spirits’ or ‘souls’ carried by or even identified with breath and, sometimes, with saliva.”12 Thus the belief, known to the Romans, that the soul of someone at the point of death could be drawn back by a kiss. In the Christian tradition, there are two great kisses bestowed by God upon man. The first, described in Genesis (2:7), is of the vivifying of man by God’s breath (which, according to St Augustine, instilled within man his rational soul). The second is Christ’s bestowing of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles when he appeared to them for the first time after the resurrection: “He therefore said to them, ‘Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I also send you.’ When he had said this, he breathed upon them, and said to them, ‘Receive the Holy Spirit’” (John 20:21–2). Commenting on this passage, St Augustine writes, “For he in some way placed his mouth to their mouth when he gave them the Spirit by breathing upon them.”13 This insufflation of the Spirit could be thought of as an insemination (which, in turn, hyperbolizes the character of the breath, in its alternate guise, as a possible contaminant).14 Perella writes, “Paul taught that a\n\n28\n\nMark Dorrian\n\nunion between the soul and God could take place on the level of transcendent Spirit, but only insofar as a man has been pneumatized, impregnated by the divine Spirit.”15 The gnostic Gospel of Philip (second or third century ad ) explicitly links the kiss, the Spirit as logos, and impregnation: … out of the mouth … the logos came forth thence He would nourish … from the mouth And become perfect. For the perfect Conceive through a kiss and give birth. Because of this We also kiss one another. We receive conception from the grace which is Among us.16\n\nThus, the breath as Spirit unites with the Word. Indeed the breath is the very substance of the spoken word and the voice. As Ruskin put it, “The air [is] the actual element and substance of the voice, the prolonging and sustaining power of it” (19:342). The breath, through the voice, is thus associated with the ontotheological notion of what Derrida has called the “transcendental signified” – the ultimate and final source of meaning, the Voice of Being. Derrida writes of the privilege accorded to the voice in Western thought: “[It] is heard (understood) … closest to the self as the absolute effacement of the signifier … [it does] not borrow from outside of itself, in the world or in ‘reality,’ any accessory signifier, any substance of expression foreign to its own spontaneity. It is the unique experience of the signified producing itself spontaneously, from within the self, and nevertheless, as signified concept, in the element of ideality or universality. The unworldly character of this subject of expression is constitutive of this ideality.”17 Perhaps the clearest counterpart to Shelley’s hoary German knight, clad in armour, stooping over the infant’s cot, comes from Dante’s Purgatory. (The Divine Comedy is, of course, a constant reference throughout Ruskin’s writings.)18 Here, Statius is describing the development of the human embryo. Through the natural, physical process, two souls develop: the vegetative (that lives) and the sensitive (that feels). When this occurs, God bends over the infant and breathes into it the intellective, contemplative soul that fuses with the others:\n\n29\n\nRuskin’s Theory of the Grotesque\n\nOpen your heart to what I now reveal: when the articulation of the brain has been perfected in the embryo then the First Mover turns to it, with joy over such art in Nature, and He breathes a spirit into it, new, and with power to assimilate what it finds active there, so that one single soul is formed complete, that lives and feels and contemplates itself. (And if you find what I have said is strange, consider the sun’s heat that turns to wine when it joins forces with the juice that flows).19\n\nThe kiss that destroys or dissolves life is then to be understood as a monstrous act insofar as it is a deviation from, or even inversion of, the “natural” and sacred teleology of the kiss. In his Hexaemeron, St Ambrose said of the kiss of Judas: “Hence the Lord, condemning His betrayer as a species of monstrosity, says: ‘Judas, dost thou betray the Son of Man with a kiss?’ That is to say, changing the emblem of love into a sign of betrayal and a revelation of unfaithfulness, are you employing this pledge of peace for the purpose of cruelty? And thus by the oracular voice of God reproof is given to him who by a bestial conjunction of lips bestows a sentence of death rather than a covenant of love.”20 Although the contents page of the third volume of The Stones of Venice gives the mild appellation “Third, or Renaissance Period,” we have to get there by way of the ominous title page, severely labelled “The Fall.” Ruskin’s elaboration of a theory of the grotesque comes in the third section of this volume (entitled “Grotesque Renaissance”). His account is highly nuanced and thematically rich and is structured by a proliferating series of categories organized by a primary, “vertical” opposition between what he calls the noble grotesque and the base grotesque. He tells us at the start that he had not intended to consider this most painful period, but (and here he opens the theme of the mouth) “I found that the entire spirit of the Renaissance could not be comprehended unless it was followed to its consummation” (11:135–6). It is as if the 30\n\nSculpted heads, Palazzo Corner della Regina\n\nlate, base grotesque of Renaissance Venice has, in some sense, swallowed what has gone before. Here the Fall becomes the gulp, the slide from head to belly, from the sublime to the disgusting. Ruskin introduces his discussion of the Grotesque Renaissance through a complex rhetorical gesture that is analogous to covering one’s eyes and then opening the fingers to see through: that is to say, an act that speaks of both protection and fascination. Although he is unwilling, he says, to pollute the book by illustrating any of its worst forms, he at the same time advises visiting them and even provides the reader with an itinerary and commentary for a walking tour. Starting at the church of Santa Maria Formosa, we visit, in turn, San Moisè; Santa Maria Zobenigo (whose rebuilding in 1678 was financed by the Barbaro family);21 San Eustachio (known as San Stae); the heads on the bases of the Palazzo Corner della Regina and the Palazzo Pesaro (Ca’Pésaro); Longhena’s church of the Ospadaletto; and finally the Bridge of Sighs. Let us now recall the ghost story that Mary Shelley read and surmise that in some sense the bad kiss (or “bad breath”) of which the story speaks, is at the beginning of, or even inaugurates, monstrosity. The kiss in the ghost story comes, in fact, to be about two children: the horrific image of the withered child and Mary Shelley’s own “hideous progeny,” to which the story gave birth through the “womb” of the nightmare. 31\n\nRuskin’s Theory of the Grotesque\n\nChurch of the Ospadeletto (Santa Maria dei Derelitti)\n\nRuskin starts his walking tour of grotesque Venice at Santa Maria Formosa, and he devotes special attention to it. He recounts at length the story of the festival commemorating the rescue of the brides of Venice, in which the Doge, accompanied by twelve maidens, annually visited the old church. We are to picture this, Ruskin says, as we approach the tower of the church built upon the site. Into this scene erupts the mask carved on the base of the tower: “A head – huge, inhuman, and monstrous – leering in bestial degradation, too foul to be either pictured or described, or to be beheld for more than an instant; for in that head is embodied the type of evil spirit to which Venice was abandoned in the fourth period of her decline; and it is well that we should see and feel the full horror of it on this spot, and know what pestilence it was that came and breathed upon her beauty, until it melted away like the white cloud\n\n32\n\nMark Dorrian\n\nSculpted head, Santa Maria Formosa\n\nfrom the ancient field of Santa Maria Formosa” (11:145; my italics). Here at the (mythic) beginning – both of Ruskin’s account (start here! he says) and of the grotesque phenomenon – in this paradigmatic, almost absolute instance of the base grotesque, the breath enters. It is a polluting, contaminating breath before which form itself withers. Later, in an aside, he notes that even the teeth on the sculpted head are represented as decayed (11:162). This deforming miasma, emitted in Venice, whose issue is monstrous and which inverts the morphological powers that Ruskin later ascribed to Athenian insufflation, seems to drift through his subsequent thinking, perhaps to reappear as the ominous “plague-wind of the eighth decade of the nineteenth century” of his later writings, the symbol, as Raymond Fitch puts it, “of a power opposed to the cohesive and vital energy he invoked in his uses of the term ‘purity.’”22 The\n\n33\n\nRuskin’s Theory of the Grotesque\n\nplague-wind’s hiss suggested its serpentine character, and the wind itself was linked by Ruskin, cryptically, to “an evil spirit, the absolute opponent of the Queen of the Air” (34:68).23 At many points in Ruskin’s writing, such as in his frequent insistence on and defence of inspiration, a pneumatology is evident. His most elaborate treatment of the topic is contained in his eulogy to the myth of Athena, The Queen of the Air (1869). This text allows us to delineate a series of related ideas within which the theme of the breath is, for Ruskin, conceptually located and expounded and which seems retrospectively to govern, at least in outline, the metaphorics of the breath in his writing on the grotesque contained in The Stones of Venice sixteen years before. As queen of the air, Athena extends her sovereignty over physical and spiritual realms: physically she has power over the atmosphere, over calm and storm; spiritually “she is the queen of the breath of man, first of the bodily breathing which is life to his blood … and then of the mental breathing, or inspiration, which is his moral health and habitual wisdom” (19:305). The placing of this bodily breathing and mental breathing together under the spiritual might make us suspect that the distinction between them is less clear than it may seem at first: this is later confirmed, for “whenever you draw a pure, long, full breath of right heaven, you take Athena into your heart, through your blood; and with the blood, into the thoughts of your brain” (19:328–9). Ruskin’s ostensible focus in the second section of The Queen of the Air, entitled “Athena Keramitis,” is on Athena as a life-giving power. His approach is circumspect, but in a passage that he later claimed defined the use of “spirit” in all his writings, he observed the translation of the Greek pneuma (wind or breath, he tells us) into spirit or ghost, while stressing that the “spirit of man” in all “articulate” languages means his “passion or virtue” (19:352). Acknowledging the dependence of life on the chemical action of air, yet concerned to defend against any thoroughgoing scientific materialism, he attempts to construct a distinction between the mere “chemical affinities” of matter (which can produce only “indefinite masses”)24 and the transcendent presences of air and sunlight, upon whose kiss (we might say, looking back toward Dante) the formative process is initiated: hence, as Ruskin puts it, the “Myth of Athena, as a Formative … power” (19:354). Seen in this way, insufflation is first and foremost a matter of morphology: spirit (which 34\n\nMark Dorrian\n\nRuskin equates with “life” or “breathing”) leads to form and is thereby to be distinguished, via the moment of air and light, from what is simply force: “For the mere force of junction is not spirit; but the power that catches out of chaos, charcoal, water, lime, or what not, and fastens them down into a given form, is properly called ‘spirit’” (19:357). Our delight in form and colour in nature bears witness to the presence of the same spirit as our own in nonhuman life and thus allows Ruskin’s exemplar of formal beauty, the flower, an unlikely element of a pneumatology, to take a central place within it.25 In the final volume of The Stones of Venice, Ruskin had referred his work on Venice to a theological language of Types in which the world was written; and in the chapter “Grotesque Renaissance” he had commented on the snake in such terms.26 In The Queen of the Air, he extended his discussion of this “Word of God,” this “divine hieroglyph of the demoniac power of the earth” (19:359, 363). Here the characteristics and meaning of the serpent, in its opposition to that of the bird, are placed under the sign of its breathlessness: in it, we are told, “the breath or spirit is less than in any other creature” (19:360). “It scarcely breathes with its one lung (the other shrivelled and abortive)” (19:363). As “the symbol of the grasp and sting of death” it is also the earthly creature whose deathly and withering kiss presents the most persuasive and biblically resonant inversion of divine insufflation (19:363). Often conflated in Ruskin’s iconography with the woman as seductress,27 the serpentine kiss was a Judas-kiss, “or, in one word, treachery” (7:399). This kiss was more than venomous; it was leech-like, a strangely vampiric kiss – one that sucked, that withdrew, that emptied out, that possessed. Shortly after the publication of The Queen of the Air, Ruskin recorded a dream in which he battled with a woman-snake only to have “another small one [fasten] on my neck like a leech, and nothing would pull it off.”28 During the previous year, when he had been assailed frequently by serpentnightmares, he had dreamt of a beautiful snake that, he told a young companion, was an innocent one but that when he touched it, “became a fat thing, like a leech, and adhered to my hand, so that I could hardly pull it off.”29 For Ruskin the snake, presenting an image both terrifying and sensual, with a strange obsessive beauty that slides easily into obscenity, seems, of all natural forms, to have had an essential relationship with the grotesque.30 It is no surprise to find the character of bird and serpent myths acting for him as a point of discrimination regarding 35\n\nRuskin’s Theory of the Grotesque\n\n“the moral state and fineness of intelligence of different races” in a way almost identical to the presence or absence of the “noble grotesque” as he had described it in The Stones of Venice (19:366; 11:187). For Ruskin the grotesque is closely related to the concept of the Fall and is even, in the last instance, identified with it. The date of the fall of Venice is put at 1423, when Foscari became Doge. The decline in question was not just in the moral character and pursuits of Venice’s inhabitants, the compost in which the base grotesque roots and blossoms as a kind of fleur du mal; it was also a fall in the vigour, power, and consequence of the Republic. This association between, on one hand, luxury, licentiousness, and the pursuit of pleasure and, on the other, the atrophy of the nation was by no means new. Jeanne Clegg suggests that in the case of Venice this linkage begins with Gilbert Burnet’s report on the city after his visit in 1685 and continues in Pope’s Dunciad, which “links dissoluteness with naval, and hence economic and political impotence. There is no energy, no fertility in this sexuality, only languor and abandon.”31 While the base grotesque emerges and flourishes cancerously within the city during its Fall, the grotesque is, at the same time, embedded by Ruskin in a broader argument in which it becomes figured as the key characteristic of all lapsarian art. In Ruskin’s schema it is the main purpose of the faculty of imagination to, as he puts it, apprehend “ultimate truth.” This truth is not something that can be sought out by a human being but is presented or given. It comes of its own accord and is not mastered but masters. “The vision, of whatever kind, comes uncalled, and will not submit itself to the seer, but conquers him, and forces him to speak as a prophet, having no power over his words or thoughts” (11:178). Ruskin, drawing an explicit connection with Pauline pneumatology, thus defends the Platonic opposition between inspiration and art as set out in the Phaedrus, and the privilege accorded to the former. This breathing-in, this insufflation, even manifests itself as a madness (the famous “madness of God” of the Phaedrus) that properly marks the irreducible division between the higher and lower worlds. The vision presented by the imagination is figured as in a mirror that is (as a plane of symbolization) interposed between the human viewer and the divine. Now Ruskin seems to suggest that a clear and calm mind can recapture “as in a perfect mirror” what is presented to it, through it (11:179), but before an inconstant and ill-educated mind, the image fragments 36\n\nMark Dorrian\n\nand warps under the passions. As he elaborates this trope, however, the possibility of the perfect mirror seems to recede. Onto the mirror of the fallen soul, he tells us, the Devil breathes, misting and polluting it, obscuring, in a kind of pneumatological play between divine inspiration and its other, the truth that flickers upon it. We must “sweep the image laboriously away,” but still we arrive at an image that is necessarily distorted, given the human condition: “the fallen human soul, at its best, must be as a diminishing glass, and that a broken one, to the mighty truths of the universe round it; and the wider the scope of its glance, and the vaster the truths into which it obtains an insight, the more fantastic their distortion is likely to be, as the winds and vapours trouble the field of the telescope most when it reaches farthest” (11:181). It is precisely this play of the sublime image of divine truth upon the agitated surface of the fallen soul that gives rise to the grotesque. Thus, at its most elevated the grotesque merges into the sublime, that is to say, the faithful apprehension of the image. Ruskin calls the sublime rare, and in fact we are led to suspect that it is more a regulatory ideal than an actual possibility. The sublime, in short, would be the magical union of the specular image with its referent: in Platonic terms, a union of the “copy-child” with its “Father.” It would be the effacement of the plane of symbolization taking place on the plane of symbolization. Indeed, Ruskin speaks a little later of the time when “that great kingdom of dark and distorted power, of which we all must be in some sort the subjects until mortality shall be swallowed up of life … and neither death stand between us and our brethren, nor symbols between us and our God” (11:186). The “mirror stage” described by the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan is a point in the development of the child when it constructs, through identification with the image in the mirror, the phantasm of a coherent self in what Lacan calls the “jubilant assumption of his specular image.”32 The “mirror-stage” of the Ruskinian grotesque is the opposite: here the mirror fragments, warps, and morcellates what is presented to it. For Baudelaire the “monstrous phenomenon of laughter” was the index of man’s fallen condition;33 for Ruskin it is the enduring presence of the grotesque. The account of the grotesque that Ruskin sets out is coordinated by two asymmetrically positioned dualities. The first, the “vertical” opposition already mentioned, distinguishes the noble and ignoble grotesque. The nature of the distinction between these two categories 37\n\nRuskin’s Theory of the Grotesque\n\n(which carry a clear metaphysical charge, with the noble grotesque being described as “true” and the ignoble “false”) is the main subject of Ruskin’s investigation. Whereas the former is the product of a healthy and well-proportioned mind (“I believe,” writes Ruskin, “that there is no test of greatness in periods, nations, or men, more sure than the development, among them or in them, of a noble grotesque” [11:187]), the latter is the poisonous flowering of a degraded and abject humanity. Its most base forms are “evidences of a delight in the contemplation of bestial vice, and the expression of a low sarcasm, which is, I believe, the most hopeless state into which the human mind can fall” (11:145). The second duality is introduced through Ruskin’s claim that in almost all cases the grotesque is composed of two elements: the fearful and the ludicrous. Depending on the relative dominance of these elements, the specific character of the grotesque phenomenon becomes defined as either terrible or sportive (11:151). There is no straightforward correspondence between the categories that constitute each duality (noble/ignoble; terrible/sportive); rather Ruskin’s text suggests that the terrible and the sportive terms operate across the noble/ignoble distinction. But while this is asserted, it is at the same time problematized by changes that occur in the character of the terrible grotesque as it shifts across the divide from noble to ignoble. In the realm of the noble grotesque, fearful elements receive adequate expression, but insofar as they appear in the domain of the ignoble, they seem to have devolved into something that evokes only “disgust.” Consequently, the ignoble workman, we are told, “may make his creatures disgusting, but never fearful” (11:170). Again, the ignoble grotesque has “no Horror. For the base soul has no fear of sin, and no hatred of it: and however it may strive to make its work terrible, there will be no genuineness in the fear; the utmost it can do will be to make its work disgusting” (11:176). Thus, while the sportive grotesque traverses the noble/ignoble distinction and lodges in both locations, the terrible grotesque seems primarily to find purchase in the noble, its fearful aspect tending to disqualify its appearance within the ignoble. If we look now at where Ruskin’s text touches on the question of monstrosity, we will find that it is a characteristic associated primarily with the ignoble grotesque and therefore also with the ludic. For example, the degraded architecture erected during the final period of the Fall of Venice is characterized by “deformed and monstrous sculpture” (11:135), as in 38\n\nMark Dorrian\n\nRuskin’s illustration of the ignoble grotesque (from Ca’Rezzonico?)\n\nthe carved head at the base of the tower of the church of Santa Maria Formosa: “huge, inhuman, and monstrous – leering in bestial degradation, too foul to be either pictured or described, or to be beheld for more than an instant” (11:145). Unwilling, even for didactic purposes, to publish such an abomination, Ruskin substituted another image, described as “utterly devoid of intention, made merely monstrous,” to illustrate the ignoble late Renaissance grotesque of Venice (11:190).34 The ignoble grotesques produced by “Inordinate Play,” we are told, will be forms “which will be absurd without being fantastic, and monstrous without being terrible” (11:161). Raphael’s grottesche in the Vatican are precisely the result of such play: “an unnatural and monstrous abortion” (11:171). Finally, the ignoble workman, incapable of drawing upon models that nature presents, is satisfied when seeking to express vice “with vulgar exaggeration, and leaves his work as false as it is monstrous” (11:177). On one occasion only is monstrosity admitted to the noble grotesque, and here it is ultimately grounded in fearful phenomena presented by nature (11:169). In Ruskin’s account, then, the ludicrous, and not the fearful, is the primary locus of monstrosity: to understand this we must pursue the implications of his system of categories. In Ruskin’s view, grotesque phenomena are to be understood as arranged in a hierarchy at whose upper limit the grotesque is surpassed and the absolutes of divine beauty and terrible sublimity are revealed 39\n\nRuskin’s Theory of the Grotesque\n\n(11:165–6). Through the beautiful and the terrible, the fundamental conditions of man’s existence gain expression: their presence in nature sets a constant demonstration before man of the existential choice with which he is confronted. The terror in man that is provoked by nature springs from his interlinked fears of death and sin. Through this coupling, nature’s destructive phenomena gain a moral effect. Faced with the terrifying convulsions of nature that announce the strike of the thunderbolt, the human soul is appalled; and, even beyond this “there is an occult and subtle horror belonging to many aspects of the creation around us, calculated often to fill us with serious thought, even in our times of quietness and peace” (11:164). Now the terrible grotesque, ultimately grounded in the truth presented through nature, emerges with the apprehension and expression of the awful imminence of death and sin. From this, from its sensitivity to the truth of man’s existential condition, it gains Ruskin’s commendation. However, the apprehension that conjures the terrible grotesque is defective: it fails (or refuses) to plumb the full horror and truth of what it contemplates, and so it falls short of the sublime. The grotesque is produced through this lack, but what is absent is, at the same time, discerned. The master of the noble grotesque feels the resonance, senses the depths, of what is withheld from him. This present absence is not evident to the workman of the ignoble grotesque: he “can feel and understand nothing, and mocks at all things with the laughter of the idiot and the cretin” (11:167). We can now see that the double movement of the “monstrous” in Ruskin’s text, upward to the heights of the noble grotesque and, much more notably, downward to the most abject ignoble grotesque, involves a curious inversion whereby the ludicrous, by its very nature, becomes terrible. This is because the ludic, as manifested in the ignoble grotesque, must become, in the last instance, an object of fear: where the trace of the monstrous within the noble grotesque comes as an expression of the presence of sin in the world, the bloated monstrosity within the ignoble grotesque is both the symptom and the actualization of sin. With the monstrous ignoble grotesque we are no longer witnesses to representations of representations: instead, the object has advanced into actuality, this movement producing, out of its ludicrousness, its fearful character. In Ruskin, this effect is produced by the supposedly indelible link between the deed and the moral condition of the doer. Thus, too, the connection between the monstrous and the disgusting in Ruskin’s dis40\n\nMark Dorrian\n\nPilaster, Ospadeletto\n\ncourse, insofar as we take disgust in its Kantian sense as what cannot be held back by representation and advances upon the viewer, “insisting, as it were, upon our enjoying it, while we still set our face against it.”35 Indeed the open mouths, lolling tongues, and slavering chops of the sculpted heads to which Ruskin points suggest this advance in another way: the polluting breath’s overcoming of the prophylactic distance associated with the purely optical. The base grotesque, as the result of a disregard for what is propitious, linked to hubris, bestiality, luxuriousness, sarcasm, and mockery, for the theistic imagination does not merely record but calls down an imminent retribution. Indeed, a biblical fate hung over the Venice of the ignoble grotesque, and Ruskin, echoing the dying speech of the Doge in Byron’s play Marino Faliero, closes: “That ancient curse was upon her, the curse of the Cities of the Plain … By the inner burning of her own passions, as fatal as the fiery rain of 41\n\nRuskin’s Theory of the Grotesque\n\nGomorrah, she was consumed from her place among the nations; and her ashes are choking the channels of the dead, salt sea” (11:195). In conclusion, I would like to speculate, in a very conjectural way, about Ruskin’s enthusiasm for the photographic process known as the daguerreotype during the period when he began to work on The Stones of Venice.36 In his brilliant essay “Likeness as Identity: Reflections on the Daguerrean Mystique,” Alan Trachtenberg has analyzed the singular power of these strange images and the complex discourse that grew up around them and within which they were embedded. The daguerreotype process produced no negative, so each plate was unique and irreplaceable. Yet, as Trachtenberg puts it, the positive /negative nexus was embodied on the face of the plate, the image shifting between these poles as the plate was tilted with respect to the viewer’s eye. The image upon the copper plate was polished to a high shine and was usually set below a gold-plated mat. According to Trachtenberg, “Daguerrean portraits lend themselves to a discourse in which atavistic fascination with images as magical replicas, as fetishes and effigies, mingles with sheer pleasure in undisguised technique, in the rigours of craft.”37 The discourse on the daguerreotype that flourished in the 1840s and 1850s was, as Trachtenberg puts it, a mixed discourse of science, technique, art, and magic. What I want to focus on in the context of Ruskin’s metaphysics of the grotesque is the contemporary popular rhetoric on the daguerreotype as a mirror with a memory. In the period of its popularization, the daguerreotype seemed to capture something beyond the mere “image” of the referent; it seemed “too real to be understood as just another copy of the world.”38 Instead, the process seemed to capture something essential about the sitter, the very essence or identity of a person, fastened down and suspended within the tain of the mirror. The daguerreotypes conjured animistic notions of “life” in the image; some of the popular fiction of the 1840s and 1850s imagined that one might fall in love with a daguerreotype or that daguerretypes might fall in love with one another. In short, the daguerreotype seemed to realize the uncanny union or fusion of the image with the referent in a way suggestively in accord with Ruskin’s clear seeing, as implied negatively in his metaphysics of the grotesque. The daguerreotype reproduced most closely, albeit in the “fallen” world, the optical and cognitive event upon whose terms Ruskin figured his regulatory ideal, the prelapsarian mirror of the soul that unites with the divine truth (to which might we say, the “cam42\n\nMark Dorrian\n\nera” of the imagination is witness?). The mechanical apparatus, through its apparent transparency before the referent, effects something like a prosaic version of the ecstatic effacement of self that Ruskin had experienced in 1842 before the mountains at Chamonix (4:364).39 Although Ruskin’s comments on the daguerreotype are resolutely down to earth, certain moments in his writing suggest more: in a letter written to his father from Venice in 1845, dated 7 October, he says, “I have been lucky enough to get from a poor Frenchm[an] here, said to be in distress, some most beautiful, though small Daguerreotypes of the palaces I have been trying to draw … It is very nearly the same thing as carrying off the palace itself – every chip of stone & stain is there.”40 In some senses the daguerreotype was more than “carrying off the palace”: it seemed to disclose the real to perception with a finer grain than did the reality it recorded. Thus we have the image of Ruskin, as described in another letter to his father eight days later, stumbling around St Mark’s, his eyes fixed on a daguerreotype: “I have been walking all over St Mark’s Place today, and found a lot of things in the Daguerreotype that I never had noticed in the place itself.”41 The only way one might make sense of the great prosyletizer of the visual, walking around Venice, eyes fixed, like a modern tourist, on an interpretative document, is if that document, here the daguerreotype, is more than interpretative. (We should note here that the daguerreotype, through its very fidelity, always contained an aspect that was somewhat monstrous. In Nathaniel Hawthorne’s novel The House of the Seven Gables, published in 1851, as was the first volume of The Stones of Venice, we are introduced to a daguerreotypist, Holgrave, whose ancestors practised witchcraft. His art is a modern technico-magical variant of the black arts practised by his forerunners. At one point he confesses a sin of the same order as Shelley’s Victor Frankenstein: “I misuse Heaven’s blessed sunshine by tracing out human features, through my agency.”42 This is an impeccably monstrous moment: the trapping, or deviating, or turning of Nature’s power against itself through art. We are almost invited to see his peculiarly animated daguerreotype portraits as little monsters.) The curious closeness of the photograph and its referent is a recurring theme in histories and theories of photography. It is usually framed in terms of the ontology of the photograph: its status as the record of an emanation from an object (whose real existence is therefore presupposed). It is the force with which the photograph returns us to, or better, 43\n\nRuskin’s Theory of the Grotesque\n\ninstantiates the referent that underpins Roland Barthes’s comment that it produces that “rather terrible thing … the return of the dead.”43 However, this “return of the dead” is not a straightforward return to life; like the liminal creatures of which we spoke at the beginning, it is more a condition of both life and death, neither life nor death. The photograph operates both between and on the outside of the conceptual opposition. As Derrida wrote on the occasion of the death of Roland Barthes, “The versus of the conceptual opposition is as substantial as a camera’s click. ‘Life/Death: the paradigm is reduced to a simple click, the one separating the initial pose from the final print.’ Ghosts: the concept of the other in the same … the dead other alive in me. The concept of the photograph photographs all conceptual oppositions, it traces a relationship of haunting which perhaps is constitutive of all logics.”44 Thus, one feels that the photograph has always had a strange affinity with Venice, that city between life and death that travellers in the early nineteenth century described as a phantasm, a dream, or a city of sleepwalkers and that Ruskin called “a ghost upon the sands of the sea, so weak – so quiet – so bereft of all but her loveliness, that we might well doubt, as we watched her reflection in the mirage of the lagoon, which was the City, and which the Shadow” (9:17). notes I am grateful to the Canadian Centre for Architecture in Montreal for the award of a visiting scholarship from May to August 2000, during which this essay was completed, and to Zoe Quick for conversations. 1 “On the Monstrous and the Grotesque,” written in 1996 but published in Word & Image 16, no. 3 (2000): 310–17.
