        "text": "Louis Armstrong (Aug 4, 1901 – July 6, 1971)\n\ncourtesy of Life Magazine\n\n“As a youngster in the little orphanage home in New Orleans, I was the bugler of the institution. When I got to be around 13 or 14 years old, they took me off the bugle and put me in the little brass band.”\n\n“There are two kinds of music, the good, and the bad. I play the good kind.”\n\n“My whole life, my whole soul, my whole spirit is to blow that horn…”\n\n“If ya ain’t got it in ya, ya can’t blow it out.”\n\n“What we play is life. I don’t let my mouth say nothin’ my head can’t stand.”\n\n“We all do ‘do, re, mi,’ but you have got to find the other notes yourself.”\n\n“There are some people that if they don’t know, you can’t tell them.”\n\n“You blows who you is.”\n\n“It really puzzles me to see marijuana connected with narcotics dope and all of that stuff. It is a thousand times better than whiskey. It is an assistant and a friend.”\n\n“I spent nine days in the Downtown Los Angeles City Jail. The judge gave me a suspended sentence and I went to work that night – wailed just like nothing happened. What strucked me funny though – I laughed real loud when several movie stars came up to the bandstand while we played a dance set and told me, when they heard about me getting caught with marijuana, they thought marijuana was a chick. Woo boy – that really fractured me!”\n\n“If you have to ask what jazz is, you’ll never know.”\n\n“A lotta cats copy the Mona Lisa, but people still line up to see the original.”\n\n“There is no such thing as ‘on the way out’ as long as you are still doing something interesting and good; you’re in the business because you’re breathing.”\n\n“Never play a thing the same way twice.”\n\n“My life has always been my music, it’s always come first, but the music ain’t worth nothing if you can’t lay it on the public. The main thing is to live for that audience, ’cause what you’re there for is to please the people.”\n\n“The Brick House was one of the toughest joints I ever played in…Guys would drink and fight one another like circle saws. Bottles would come flying over the bandstand like crazy and there was lots of plain common shooting and cutting. But somehow all that jive didn’t faze me at all. I was so happy to have some place to blow my horn.”\n\nSatchmo: My Life in New Orleans (1954)\n\n1932, inscription to Hoagy Carmichael\n\nBillie Holiday and Louis Armstrong in the 1947 film ‘New Orleans’\n\n“Some of you young folks been saying to me, “Hey Pops, what you mean ‘What a wonderful world‘? How about all them wars all over the place? You call them wonderful? And how about hunger and pollution? That ain’t so wonderful either.”\n\n“Well, how about listening to old Pops for a minute. Seems to me, it ain’t the world that’s so bad but what we’re doin’ to it. And all I’m saying is, see, what a wonderful world it would be if only we’d give it a chance. Love, baby, love. That’s the secret, yeah. If lots more of us loved each other, we’d solve lots more problems. And then this world would be a gasser. That’s wha’ ol’ Pops keeps saying.”\n\nSpoken intro to “What a Wonderful World” (1970 version)\n\nRenowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice almost as much as for his trumpet-playing, Armstrong’s influence extends well beyond jazz music, and by the end of his career in the 1960s, he was widely regarded as a profound influence on popular music in general.\n\nArmstrong was one of the first truly popular African-American entertainers to “cross over,” whose skin-color was secondary to his music in an America that was severely racially divided. He rarely publicly politicized his race, often to the dismay of fellow African-Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for desegregation during the crisis in Little Rock.\n\nHis artistry and personality allowed him socially acceptable access to the upper echelons of American society that were highly restricted for a black man.\n\nArmstrong died of a heart attack in his sleep on July 6, 1971, a month before his 70th birthday, and 11 months after playing a famous show at the Waldorf-Astoria’s Empire Room. His honorary pallbearers included Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Pearl Bailey, Count Basie, Harry James, Frank Sinatra, Ed Sullivan, Earl Wilson, Alan King, Johnny Carson and David Frost.\n\ncourtesy of Frank Beacham on Facebook\n\n——\n\n“When you’re sick [due to drug withdrawal], music is a great help. Once in Texas, I kicked a [heroin] habit on weed, a pint of paregoric, and a few Louis Armstrong records.”\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs, Junky (1953), Chapter 12\n\n“You know you can’t play anything on a horn that Louis hasn’t played…”\n\nMiles Davis to Nat Hentoff in 1958, as quoted in Milestones : The Music and Times of Miles Davis (1998) by Jack Chambers, p. 209\n\n“He was born poor, died rich, and never hurt anyone along the way.”Duke Ellington\n\n“Armstrong is to music what Einstein is to physics and the Wright Brothers are to travel.”\n\nJazz documentary producer Ken Burns\n\n“The extent of his influence across jazz, across American music, and around the world has such continuing stature that he is one of the few who can easily be mentioned with Stravinsky, Picasso and Joyce. His life was the embodiment of one who moves from rags to riches, from anonymity to internationally imitated innovator. Louis Daniel Armstrong supplied revolutionary language that took on such pervasiveness that it became commonplace, like the light bulb, the airplane, the telephone.”\n\nStanley Crouch; Time Magazine; June 8, 1998\n\n“He’s the father of us all, regardless of style or how modern we get. His influence is inescapable. Some of the things he was doing in the 20’s and 30’s, people still haven’t dealt with.”\n\nArmstrong disciple Nicholas Payton\n\n“What he does is real, and true, and honest, and simple, and even noble. Every time this man puts his trumpet to his lips, even if only to practice three notes, he does it with his whole soul.”\n\nLeonard Bernstein\n\n“I knew Louis well, he had his crazy little habits. Everyone thinks he was a druggie, but he wasn’t. After every concert, he would put on a stocking cap, then he’d have his bottle of Pluto water, orange juice, Serutan [a brand of laxatives] and a joint. This was his formula; in fact, he used to post the recipe on bulletin boards, calling it ‘The Road to Good Health.'”\n\nMitch Miller, in “Mitch Miller Remembers,”\n\nThe Chicago Tribune (November 15, 1987), Sec. 13, p. 17\n\n“If you don’t like Louis Armstrong, you don’t know how to love.”\n\nMahalia Jackson\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs (Feb 5, 1914 – Aug 2, 1997)\n\n“Knowing you might not make it… in that knowledge courage is born.”\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs, The Western Lands\n\n“Whether you like it or not, you are committed to the human endeavor. I cannot ally myself with such a purely negative goal as avoidance of suffering. Suffering is a chance you take by the fact of being alive.”\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs, Letters to Allen Ginsberg, 1953-1957\n\n“Love? What is it? Most natural painkiller what there is. LOVE”\n\n(This is credited in “Last Words” as his final journal entry)\n\n“A paranoid is someone who knows a little of what’s going on. A psychotic is a guy who’s just found out what’s going on.”\n\n“I don’t care if people hate my guts; I assume most of them do. The important question is whether they are in a position to do anything about it.”\n\n“Whether you sniff it smoke it eat it or shove it up your ass the result is the same: addiction.”\n\nAllen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, Philip Whalen, Boulder, Colorado, circa 1974, the year Naropa Institute was founded.\n\ncopyright Rachel Homer\n\n“There couldn’t be a society of people who didn’t dream. They’d be dead in two weeks.”\n\nBurroughs and Bowie\n\ncopyright Daily Telegraph\n\n“Man is an artifact designed for space travel. He is not designed to remain in his present biologic state any more than a tadpole is designed to remain a tadpole.”\n\nWilliam Burroughs, NYC 1953\n\n“Burroughs at what looks like the 8th Avenue & 14th Street Subway station, New York City” October 1953\n\nAuthor Allen Ginsberg\n\n“Desperation is the raw material of drastic change. Only those who can leave behind everything they have ever believed in can hope to escape. ”\n\nwith Joe Strummer\n\n“You know a real friend?\n\nSomeone you know will look after your cat after you are gone.”\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs, Last Words: The Final Journals\n\nwith Tom Waits\n\n“In the U.S. you have to be a deviant or die of boredom.”\n\nwith Madonna\n\n“As a young child I wanted to be a writer because writers were rich and famous. They lounged around Singapore and Rangoon smoking opium in a yellow pongee silk suit. They sniffed cocaine in Mayfair and they penetrated forbidden swamps with a faithful native boy and lived in the native quarter of Tangier smoking hashish and languidly caressing a pet gazelle.”\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs, The Adding Machine: Selected Essays\n\nwith Jimmy Page\n\n“There is nothing more provocative than minding your own business.”\n\nwith Patti Smith\n\n“If I had my way we’d sleep every night all wrapped around each other like hibernating rattlesnakes.”\n\n“Build a good name. Keep your name clean. Don’t make compromises, don’t worry about making a bunch of money or being successful — be concerned with doing good work and make the right choices and protect your work. And if you build a good name, eventually, that name will be its own currency.”\n\n~ William Burroughs’ advice to Patti Smith, as recounted by her\n\nKurt Cobain visits the Burroughs home in Lawrence, KS, 1993\n\n“The first and most important thing an individual can do is to become an individual again, decontrol himself, train himself as to what is going on and win back as much independent ground for himself as possible.”\n\nWilliam Burroughs sits on a bench in his backyard\n\n(either waiting for the answer or the manager)\n\nPhoto source: the Estate of William S. Burroughs\n\n“So cheat your landlord if you must, but do not try to short-change the muse. It cannot be done. You can’t fake quality.”\n\n“I see painting as an evocative magic, and there must always be a random factor in magic, one which must be constantly changed and renewed.”\n\n“America is not so much a nightmare as a non-dream. The American non-dream is precisely a move to wipe the dream out of existence. The dream is a spontaneous happening and therefore dangerous to a control system set up by the non-dreamers.”\n\n“In my writing I am acting as a map maker, an explorer of psychic areas. . . a cosmonaut of inner space, and I see no point in exploring areas that have already been thoroughly surveyed.”\n\n“Writers, like elephants, have long, vicious memories. There are things I wish I could forget.”\n\n“When you stop growing you start dying.”\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs, Junky\n\n“Love is a haunting melody that I have never mastered, and I fear I never will.”\n\n“Language is a virus from outer space.”\n\n“Artists to my mind are the real architects of change, and not the political legislators who implement change after the fact.”\n\n“I’m running out of everything now. Out of veins, out of money.”\n\n“When you’re sick [due to drug withdrawal], music is a great help. Once in Texas, I kicked a [heroin] habit on weed, a pint of paregoric, and a few Louis Armstrong records.”\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs, Junky (1953), Chapter 12"
