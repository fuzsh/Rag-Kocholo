        "text": "C1 Canterbury\n\nCanterbury, a parliamentary and municipal borough, and a county borough in Kent. It is also a county in itself. It is the metropolitan see of all England, the capital of the county, an important market-town, a principal station on the L.C. & D.R., and also on the Ashford and Margate branch of the S.E.R., is 55 miles from London by road and 62 by railway, 14 from Margate, 16 from Dover, and 7 from Whitstable. Its site is a valley surrounded by hills, its appearance as seen from any point is highly picturesque, and its environs are diversified and very pleasant. Canterbury returned two members to Parliament until the Redistribution of Seats Act in 1885, when it was deprived of one. Area of the parliamentary borough, 3834 acres; population, 22,710; area of the county and municipal borough, 3971 acres; population, 23,062.\n\nHistory\n\nCanterbury rose prior to the era of authentic history, and comes into view as a British town under the name of Dwrhwern. The Romans made it one of their principal stations, rebuilt and strengthened it over nearly the whole area occupied by the modern town, and called it Durovernum. The Saxons made it the capital of the kingdom of Kent, and called it Cantwarabyrig, \"the stronghold of the men of Kent.\" The arrival of Augustine in 597, followed by the conversion of Ethelbert, gave it consequence as the source of Christianity to England, and as the cradle of the metropolitical see. The Danes took it in 843, 852, 918, and 1011, but were repelled successively by Elfleda and Canute. It had a castle before the Conquest, and was called Civitas Cantuariae at Domesday. It had begun at the fall of the heptarchy to be eclipsed by Winchester and London, and it continued for ages to decrease in comparative importance, but at the murder of Thomas Â£ Becket in its cathedral in 1170 it burst into celebrity as one of the most notable towns in Europe. Pilgrims of all ranks from all parts of Christendom crowded to its gates, and the romancers placed it side by side with Cologne and Compostella.\n\nWalls and Streets. Walls most probably were built around the town by the Romans, walls certainly stood around it in the time of the Saxons, new walls and a ditch were formed in the time of Richard I., and these were renovated in 1374-81 by Archbishop Simon of Sudbury. The area within them has been found to contain many Roman bricks, pavements, vases, lachrymatories, and personal ornaments at about 6 or 9 feet beneath the surface, and therefore was occupied by Roman houses. The walls were 6 feet thick, composed of large masses of chalk cemented with a strong mortar and lined and faced with flint, were surmounted by twenty-one turrets at equal distances, and had six gates. Portions of the walls, with two or three of the turrets, still stand in Broad Street, and on the south side of Dane John. The west gate also still stands contiguous to the river, and is a noble embattled structure flanked by two lofty round towers. The ditch around the walls was originally 150 feet wide, but most of it is now built upon or converted into gardens, the chief of which is the picturesque Dane John. Part of the present town is without the walls, and much is modern, handsome, and substantial, but most of it within the walls is ancient. The High Street presents gabled ends and projecting fronts. Alleys and lanes toward the cathedral and its precincts look antiquely picturesque. Mercery Lane, leading on the High Street, was named from the mercery-stalls at which pilgrims bought memorials of their visit, and contains some window arches of the \"Checquers of the Hope,\" noted by the lively and laughter-loving Chaucer, and the first opening west of this lane shows part of the court into which the pilgrims rode. An inn still standing, called the Red Lion, entertained the ambassadors of Charles V. in 1520, and another ancient bat modernised inn, called the Star, in the suburb of St Dunstan, on the way from the railway station to the centre of the city, was a hostel for pilgrims who arrived after the shutting of the gates at nightfall.\n\nPublic Buildings.Â£The guildhall, situated in High Street, was built in 1439 and rebuilt in 1697, has been exteriorly modernised, and contains pieces of ancient armour and some curious portraits. In 1880 the whole of the interior was rearranged and redecorated. The court or sessions-house is a modern structure in the suburb of St Augustine. The prison, a red brick building, adjoins the court-house in the suburb of St Augustine, is an erection of 1808 on the radiating plan, with the keeper's house and chapel in the centre. The music hall is in St Margaret Street. The theatre is in Guildhall Street, was built in 1861, and will hold 800 persons. The royal cavalry barracks were built in 1794, form three sides of a square, and present a striking appearance. The old infantry barracks were built in 1798, with accommodation for 2000 men, formed for some time a station for the horse and foot artillery, and are now used for depots of cavalry. The present infantry barracks were built in 1811. The military hospital is situated behind the barracks. The keep of the ancient castle stands in Castle Street, adjacent to the site of one of the city gates, measures 88 feet by 80, and is now occupied by the Gas and Water Works Company. The castle was taken without resistance in the time of King John by Louis of France, became afterwards a prison, and was notable for the incarceration of the Jews. The mound on which the donjon stood (now called the Dane John), has, along with part of the city walls, been converted into a city-mall 1130 feet long, laid out in spiral walks and shrubberies, and commands a grand view of the cathedral. An adjacent field outside the walls was the scene of the martyrdoms in the reign of Mary, and bears the name of the Martyrs' Field. The Archbishop's palace, founded in the time of the Saxons, rebuilt by Lanfranc and extended by Hubert Walter and Stephen Langton, stood in Palace Street, and its remains are now used partly as the junior department of the King's School, and partly as the house of the surveyor of the chapter. This was the scene of the death of the Black Prince, of the prelude of the murder of Thomas Â£ Becket, of the bridal feast of Edward I., and of banquets to Henry VIII., Charles V., and Elizabeth. The Canterbury Museum and Free Library, in Guildhall Street, was founded in 1826. The library has over 5000 volumes. The museum contains many curiosities and Roman antiquities. There is a school of art in connection with the Art Department, South Kensington. A swimming bath in Whitehall Boad was built in 1876. The Agricultural Hall, a very fine building just outside the city wall, is much used for cattle and flower shows. The Masonic Temple, situated in St Peter's Street, is a fine building. The town has an excellent system of sewage; the works are situated on the Stun'y Road. The cattle market is a large one; the markets are held fortnightly on Mondays. Other markets are held on Wednesday and Saturday in each week.\n\nThe Cathedral\n\nA church was built by St Augustine on the site of the cathedral, greatly injured by the Danes in 938, restored by Archbishop Ido in 940-60, damaged again by the Danes in 1011, and almost destroyed by fire in 1067; it contained the bodies of St Blaize, St Wilfred, St Dunstan, St Alphege, and St Andoen, the heads of St Swithin and St Furseus, and the arm of St Bartholomew. The present edifice was commenced in 1070-86 by Archbishop Lanfranc, extended, altered, and restored by successive prelates till 1495, and has undergone great and costly renovations. It exhibits, in its various parts, all the styles of architecture, from Early Norman to Perpendicular, makes grand displays of them, both in then respective features and in their junctions with one another, and is especially rich and large in Transition Norman and Perpendicular English. It has a crypt with vaulted roof 14 feet high, supported on massive pillars, and the whole building stands aloft on a height of base and with a force of character unsurpassed in any other cathedral, dominating over the city around it like an abrupt, isolated, spiry hill over some miles of plain. It consists of a south porch; a nave of nine bays, with aisles; a central transept, with two chapels; a choir of six bays, with aisles; a choir-transept, with two apsidal chapels in each wing; a presbytery of two bays, with aisles, and with northern and southern apsidal chapels; an eastern ambulatory, with aisles; a main apsidal chapel of four bays, with magnificent procession-path and aisles; and a circular structure to the east of this, called Becket's Crown; and it has a central tower and two western towers. The dimensions of the cathedral areÂ£nave, 220 feet long and 72 in breadth; choir, 180 feet in length and 40 in width; great transept, 124 feet long; choir transept, 154 feet long; cloisters, 144 feet square; Trinity chapel, 71 feet long and 69 in breadth; external length, 530 feet; internal length, 514 feet; western towers, 157 feet in height; central or Bell Harry Tower, 235 feet; including its pinnacles, 249 feet. The nave has no triforium; the main transept has no aisles; the choir is approached by noble flights of stairs, and offers the earliest instance of the pointed arch in England; the screen is of the 15th century, with niched imagery of founders and saints, and was recently restored; the throne was carved by Flemish workmen, and cost Â£E1200; the pulpit is of stone, by Butterfield, and was put np in 1846; the main apsidal chapel is approached by broad nights of stairs, contained the gorgeous shrine of St Thomas a Becket, and has a curious mosaic pavement, with the signs of the zodiac; the central tower is of two stages, with octagonal turrets at the angles, and has been called the glory of all towers; and the western towers are each of six stages and much beauty, one of them rebuilt in 1840 at a cost of Â£25,000. Effigies, altar-tombs, and other monuments, in great variety, are dispersed through the various parts of the pile to the memory of the archbishops and many other notable persons, including Henry IV., Queen Joan of Navarre, Edward the Black Prince (whose surcoat, gauntlets, and shield hang above his tomb), a Lady Mohun, a Countess of Athole, Admiral Sir G. Rooke, Sir John Boys, Hadrian Saravia, Orlando Gibbons, W. Shuck-ford, Odo Coligny, a Marquis of Dorset, and a Duke of Clarence.\n\nThe edifice served, throughout Roman Catholic times, both as a cathedral and as a conventual church. A Benedictine priory stood connected with it, and was known as the convent of Christ's Church. A massive wall surrounded the precincts, and served at once for defence and for seclusion. The passage from the priory led to the choir-transept through a circular chamber, now used as a baptistery. The old library, on the site of the prior's chapel, contains many valuable books and manuscripts belonging to the late venerable Benjamin Harrison, M.A., archdeacon of Maidstone. The Cathedral library contains a large collection of Greek and Roman coins and old Bibles. The Chapter House, approached from the east walk, is a fine building with an exquisitely carved roof of Irish oak; its dimensions areÂ£90 feet long, 37 broad, and 54 high. The cloisters are on the north side of the nave, measure 144 feet by 144, and have eight bays on every side. The space southward of the choir formed the cemetery, or God's acre, sown with the seed of the resurrection. ' The Oaks' was the convent garden; the Norman doorway is in the precinct gate eastward of the choir. The ancient stone house on the left side turning round the Becket's Crown formed the Honours, the guest-hall (a nave and aisles 150 feet by 40 feet), for the reception of visitors. Considerable remains of the infirmary are observable, the chapel and common-hall, of flint, with three tall pointed windows, built in 1342. Near it was St Thomas' well. At this point occurs ' the Dark Entry,' a Norman cloister built by Prior Wibert about 1167, with a curious bell-shaped tower, which served as the monks' conduit; above it is now the baptistery. On one side is the gate of the great cloisters. The arch and ruins towards the Green Court are those of La Gloriette, the prior's rooms built by Prior Hathbrand in 1379. Passing the chapter, once the prior's chapel library, the Prior's or Court Gate leads into the Green Court. In the Green Court is the Deanery, a fine house, containing the portraits of many former deans of Canterbury. It was built by Dean Godwin in 1570, after a fire on the site of the Prior's lodgings. In it Hooper welcomed Queen Mary. At the north-east corner a large gateway opens into the fellings or foreigns, the space beyond the conventual jurisdiction. On the north side were the ancient dean's great hall, water-house, granary, refectory, frater-house, brew-house, bake-house, and domestic buildings, among which great part of the dormitory remains, with a gateway and steps. At the north-west angle is the Norman precinct gate of the priory, which stood on the south side of the court; the back entrance to it or Larder Gate still remains. At the south-west angle is the arched door which led to the palace. The strangers' hall was on the west side. In the north-west angle is likewise the Norman staircase, with an open arcade which led into the north hall, 150 feet by 40 feet, allotted to the stewards of the prior court; the arches on which it was supported alone remain; above them the King's School was built by Mr Austen in 1855. They form a passage into the Mint yard. It is the only staircase of the period known to be in existence. In the King's School were educated Harvey the physician, Lord Thurlow, and Lord Tenterden. Within the ancient almonry, on the northwest of the Green Court, stood the chantry of St Thomas Â£ Becket, which Henry VIII. converted into a mint, and Cardinal Pole made the King's school. In the high wall, probably a portion of Lanfranc's building, leading to the northwest entrance of the cathedral, are the remains of the covered way to the cloisters, by which the primates entered, but their ordinary approach was through a large gateway with a square tower of flint and ashlar.\n\nAncient Monasteries\n\nAn abbey was founded by St Augustine outside the walls in the eastern suburb of Long-port. It was designed by him mainly as a mausoleum for bishops and kings; it became the burial-place of himself and his successors, and of Ethelbert and his successors; it possessed much grandeur as an edifice, and great wealth and consequence as a monastery; it was always regarded as more sacred and important than the cathedral, till the latter outshone it by means of the glory of Becket's shrine, and it competed to the last with the convent of Christ Church in the splendours and fetes of its guest-hall. The buildings of it were greatly injured at the Reformation, were, some time after, partly converted into a royal palace, were subsequently given to Lord Woton, were several times damaged by fire and by flood, were eventually degraded to the uses of a brewery, and were purchased in 1844 by Mr Beresford Hope, and the Augustine Missionary College was erected on the site.\n\nC2 Canterbury St. Dunstan\n\nC3 Canterbury St. Martin\n\nC4 Canterbury St. Mary Bredin\n\nC5 Canterbury St. Mary Northgate\n\nC6 Canterbury St. Paul\n\nDover,\n\na seaport town and municipal and parliamentary borough in Kent. The town stands on the coast, partly under chalk cliffs, at the mouth of the rivulet Dour, the end of Watling Street, and the terminus of two railways, 15 1/4 miles SE of Canterbury, and 76 from London. The \"S.E.R. has a station in Beach Street, with a branch to the Admiralty Pier. The L.C. & D.R. has two stations-one at the Priory, on the Folkestone Road, and a terminal station in Strond Street, with a branch to the Admiralty Pier. It confronts Calais, is the nearest port of England to France, and has been noted from very early times as a main point of communication with the Continent.\n\nHistory.\n\nDover was the Dwffyrrha of the ancient Britons, the Dubrse of the Romans, the Dofra or Dofris of the Saxons, and the Dovere of Domesday. The ancient Britons had a camp at it, CaÂ£sar appeared off it prior to his landing at Deal, a Roman receiver of tribute was located at it before Caesar departed, another Roman functionary converted the British camp at it into a fort or castle in the year 43, Severus engirt it with strong walls about the year 200, Roman legions were stationed at it in the reigns of Valen-tinian and Theodosius, and King Withred of Kent protected it by a sea-wall about the year 700. The Saxons and the Danes were prevented from troubling it by its strength. King Arthur, in the romance, arrived at it from Brittany. The knights of the Norman Conquest burned it, but the Conqueror furnished money for rebuilding it and gave it to Bishop Odo. Its Norman masters enlarged and strengthened its castle, enriched it with numerous churches and monastic houses, and made it, according to Matthew Paris, \" the lock and key of the kingdom.\" Stephen, the last of the Norman kings, died in it. Henry II. was here in 1156, and again with Louis of France in 1179. Richard I. sailed hence in 1189 to the Holy Land. Walter, Bishop of Carlisle, was here in 1205 on his way to Rome as Prince John's agent against the Barons.\n\nKing John assembled on the neighbouring downs in 1212 a force of 60,000 men to prevent a threatened descent of the French, and made on the western heights in 1213 his submission to Rome. The French laid siege to the castle in 1216 in the belief that the capture of it would give them the kingdom, but were forced to retire. Richard de la Wyche, Bishop of Chichester, preached a great crusade against Sicily at Dover in 1253 in presence of the king.

In 1893 the Prince of Wales came to lay the foundation stone of the eastern arm of the new harbour.\n\nShakespeare has dramatised several of the events we have noted ; Gray, the poet, mentions Dover ; Lisle Bowles wrote a sonnet on it; Lord Byron alludes to it in some sarcastic lines ; Wordsworth and Mrs Hemans celebrate it in a happier strain ; Dickens gives prominence to it in his \" David Cop-perfield. \" Dr King, the antiquary, made observations at it in 1744 and 1787; and Cole, the antiquary, visited it in 1735 and 1769. The town gave the title of Earl in 1628 to Henry Carey, fourth Lord Hunston ; of Baron in 1685 to the Hon. Henry Jermyn ; of Duke in 1708 to James Douglas. Earl of Queensberry; of Baron in 1788 to the Hon. Joseph Y^orke; and of Baron again, in 1831, to the Right Hou. George J. W. Ellis.\n\nSite, and Streets\n\nThe town occupies the entrance to a fertile vale, part of it overhung by an amphitheatre of chalk cliffs. and spreads thence, beneath the cliffs, along a curving shore. It has brilliant environs of hill and cliff and promontory; presents within itself romantic features ; commands, from its heights, a gorgeous prospect of the surrounding country, and across the straits to France, and is excelled by few towns in England in the mingled beauty and grandeur of its attractions. The walls which anciently engirt it described an irregular triangle, and had several towers. Four gates were on the south side and four on the west side, and the foundations of two of them, Severus Gate on the south and Adrian Gate on the west, remain. The western part of the town, contiguous to the harbour, consists of irregular narrow streets, and is the chief seat of business. The part thence along the shore includes lines of private houses (dates from 1791 and later periods), and is the chief resort of visitors and sea-bathers. The Marine Parade, Liverpool Terrace, and the houses under the East Cliff, were commenced in 1817, Guild-ford Lawn and Clarence Lawn a year or two later, the Esplanade in 1833, Waterloo Crescent in 1834, and Camden Crescent in 1840. Many handsome villas have been erected in the suburbs in recent years and the town much extended. A very progressive policy lias made itself apparent in the widening and improving of thoroughfares, the building of a school of art at a cost of about Â£10,000, and public baths.\n\nPublic Buildings, &c.\n\nThe town-hall, opened in 1883, is a fine building of Kentish rag, Bath stone, and flint, erected at a cost of about Â£19,000. The ancient building was a Maison Dieu, founded by Hubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent, in 1227 as a resting-place for strangers and pilgrims, and a belfry-tower of it, the refectory and chapel, part of the north aisle of a crypt, and a north-east sacristy remain. The building for the Dover Museum and Philosophical Institution was erected in 1849, and is a handsome structure. There are concert halls, a theatre, a custom-house, and a sailors\"' home. The Gordon Boys' Orphanage was founded in 1884. There are five clubs and a Working Men's Institute. The public park, 23 acres in extent, was opened in 1883. There are several first-class hotels, good boarding-houses, reading-rooms, libraries, baths, and places of recreation. Bathing establishments are on the Marine Parade, bathing machines are on the beach, and bathing-places without machines are very near the town. A handsome promenade pier, 900 feet in length, with a width of 40 feet at entrance and 100 feet at top for the pavilion, was opened in 1893. It is approached from the Marine Parade. Near the Parade is a monument erected to the memory of the officers and men of the 60th Rifles who fell in the Indian Mutiny.\n\nThe Castle and Fortifications.\n\nThe castle crowns a chalk cliff 320 feet high, about a quarter of a mile north-east of the town, and occupies nearly 35 acres. Its parts are so numerous and complex that a clear idea could scarcely be given without the aid of a ground-plan, and they date variously from Roman, Saxon, Norman, and later times, but have, on the whole, been entirely remodelled since 1780. The castle, in its present state, may, in a general way, be said to consist of an upper and a lower court, defended by deep, broad, dry ditches, with subterranean communications to inner towers. The upper court is surrounded by a strong wall with towers, while the lower is encompassed on all sides, except next the sea, by an irregular wall or curtain, flanked by numerous towers. The entrance is on the south side of the principal tower by a flight of steps, leading by the west side to the house of the governor. The keep is supposed to occupy the site of the Roman pretorium, and has a height, at. the top of its parapet, of 465-8 feet above low water. The subterranean passages are supposed to have been formed in the reign of John. The cliff, with its vast congeries of almost every kind of fortification, looks like a citadel within a town, projects to the shore nearly as a promontory, and must, before the invention of cannon, have been as strong as Gibraltar.\n\nMany changes and additions were made in the course of last century and in the early part of the present one to render this stronghold still more secure, and to fit it better for garrisons and for defence. Subterranean apartments, with communications, were formed for the reception of soldiery, and barracks excavated in the solid rock capacious enough to accommodate 2000 men. Fortifications also were erected on formidable heights to the west, which are higher than the keep. Four guard-houses were constructed there, ramparts and lines of defence were raised to defend them, and positions were made for seventy-two pieces of cannon. During the eleven years preceding 1814, likewise, entire regiments of soldiers, companies of miners and engineers, and a large train of masons, artificers, and labourers were continually employed in forming extensive excavations, lines, breast-works, batteries, redoubts, fosses, and all other strong constructions of military defence. Handsome barracks are situated above the town, and have communication with it by means of a military shaft. An arched passage leads to this from Snargate Street, and three spiral flights of 140 steps each, commencing at the extremity of the passage, wind round a large shaft or tower, open at the top to admit light. Above the barracks, on the hill, is the grand redoubt, surrounded by a deep fosse, and on the ridge of the hill, to the south-west of the redoubt, is the citadel, defended by deep ditches and numerous flanking and masked batteries. Lines of communication, either superficial or subterranean, connect all parts of the fortifications, and a military road passes over the hill from Archcliffe Fort to the entrance of the town from Folkestone. Deep wells and curiously-contrived tanks give an ample supply of excellent water; and a military hospital, a handsome edifice, .stands charmingly on the declivity toward the sea. The southern fortifications extend as far as the celebrated Shakespeare Cliff, or Hay Cliff, described in t1 King Lear.\" This is 350 feet high, almost perpendicular, and somewhat remarkable in form, but is by no means so sublime an object as might be supposed from Shakespeare's description. Additional barracks for 1200 men were erected, at a cost of Â£60,000, in 1855-56, and a school-church for the garrison was opened in 1858.\n\nA curious piece of brass ordnance within the castle walls bears the name of Queen Elizabeth's pocket pistol. It is 24 feet long, is adorned with flowers and emblematical devices, and is said to be capable of carrying a 12-pound shot seven miles. It was cast at Utrecht in 1544, and presented to Henry VIII. by Charles V. A pharos watch-tower to the south of the keep is remarkable both as the only piece of the Roman works of the castle now remaining, and as almost the earliest regular masonry now existing in Great Britain. It forms a conspicuous object for miles around, and during the last 1800 years has served as a landmark to guide the mariner to the shores of England. It consists of a casing of flints and tufa, with bonding-courses of large Roman tiles, filled up in the interior with smaller stones and mortar, and it is octagonal outside and square inside, with walls 10 feet thick and a clear inner space of 14 feet each way; It was used for defence, and underwent alterations in the time of William the Conqueror, was repaired in 1259 by Lord Grey of Codnor, constable of the castle; was allowed afterwards to bear unaided all the abrasion of time and weather, and was at one time used as a government storehouse. The church of St Mary in the Castle, adjoining the pharos, occupies the site of the Roman Sacellum, is ascribed by some antiquaries to the age of the apocryphal King Lucius, or the period of the mission of St Augustine; seems certainly to date, in its oldest portions, from the middle of the 7th century; is chiefly Norman, but contains Saxon parts, has interspersions of Roman bricks and tiles in its walls, and was finely restored in 1862, under the direction of Sir Gilbert Scott, to be a garrison church. A special document of the time of the Conqueror speaks of \" the castle of Dover, with the well of water in it.\" The position of the well eluded the most diligent investigation till the year 1811, when it was discovered in the keep in the thickness of the north-east wall. The castle has always been considered one of the principal defences of the country, and contains a garrison of about 750 men. Fort Burgoyne, an extensive modern work to the north, now forms the real line of defence on that side.\n\nEcclesiastical Affairs.\n\nThe parishes of St James and St Mary, the chapelries of Trinity and Christ Church, the extra-parochial places of Dover Castle and East Cliffe, and parts of the parishes of Charlton, Hougham, Buckland, and Guston are within Dover borough. Five other parishes, a chapelry, and a priory or collegiate church were formerly within it.\n\nSt James' Church,\n\nin St James' Street, at the foot of the Castle Hill, consists of nave, south aisle, and chancel, with low central tower, has a Norman doorway, and contains the ashes of the father and grandfather of Lord Chancellor Hardwicke, and a monument to Sir Nathaniel Wraxall. A larger church, to supersede this, in Maison Dieu Road, was built in 1861-63; is in the Decorated English style, of Kentish rag with Bath stone dressings; consists of nave and aisles 94 feet long and 66 feet wide, galleries at the sides, and a chancel 34 feet by 24, with an organ chapel on the south; and has a tower at the north-west angle, with crocketed pinnacles, and surmounted by a fine spire 150 feet high. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Canterbury ; value, Â£460 with residence. Patron, the Archbishop. St Mary's Church, in Cannon Street, consists of nave with aisles, a chancel with apse, and a west square tower with octagonal spire; dates from the llth century, but was mainly rebuilt in 1843-44, and contains monumental inscriptions for the actor Foote and the poet Churchill. The living is a vicarage; value, Â£880, in the gift of the Archbishop, Lord Warden, and Lord Lieutenant. Trinity Church, in Strond Street, was built in 1833 at a cost of Â£8000. The living is a vicarage; value, Â£250. Patron, the Archbishop. Christ Church, within Hougham parish, was built in 1844, and is a good structure of nave and aisles, with bell-turret, in the Early English style. The living is a vicarage; value, Â£350, in the gift of Trustees. The church of St Peter and. St Paul, Charlton, is a small building of flint and brick. A magnificent church to supersede this was built of stone in 1893 in close proximity with an entrance to Frith Road. The living is a rectory; value, Â£300. Patron, Keble College, Oxford. The Church of St Bartholomew is a good stone building in the Early English style. The living is a vicarage; value, Â£195. Patron, Keble College, Oxford. The church of St Andrew is at Buckland. The living is a vicarage; value, Â£320. There are Wesleyan, Congregational, Baptist, and Unitarian chapels, a Roman Catholic church, Jews synagogue, and a Friends' meeting-house.\n\nSt John Baptist's Church\n\nwas destroyed in 1537, St Peter's after 1611, St Nicholas in 1836, St Edmund's at some period not noted, Our Lady of Pity's or Archcliffe chapel in 1576. St Martin's-le-Grand Collegiate Church was founded in 691 by King Withred, refounded on a new site behind the market-place by King Henry II., and continued to be used for Divine service till 1528. Ruins of it, comprising the east piers of the central tower, the walls of the choir and its aisles, part of the transept, and the chapterhouse on the south side of the choir, with a portion of the crypt and a belfry, are still standing. Its churchyard contains the tomb of the poet Churchill, and was the place where Lord Byron wrote his well-known lines on one lt who blazed the comet of a season.\" The priory of St Martin, on the Folkestone Road, nearly opposite Christ Church, was founded in 1132 by Archbishop Corboil; had a large and magnificent church, which has entirely disappeared; made a great figure for a time in opposition to the Archbishops of Canterbury, but was at length subdued by them and became their property; and is now represented by a picturesque decorated principal gateway, and by the guest-house and the refectory, the latter nearly perfect, both very plain but massive, with Norman and Early English features. One of the priors, Ascelyn, became Bishop of Rochester, and another, Eichard, became Archbishop of Canterbury immediately after Thomas a Becket. Suffragan bisliops of Dover existed from 1537 till 1597, and were re-appointed in 1818. Dover College is an excellent boarding school for boys, founded in 1870; and is situated in the pleasant and extensive grounds of the priory. Dover High School for girls was founded in 1888. Aimshouses have existed from time immemorial.\n\nThe South-Eastern railway\n\nfrom Folkestone to Dover was opened in 1844, and excels nearly every other line of equal extent in England in the engineering difficulties which it overcame. The part of it near and at Dover, especially, is very striking. The Abbots Cliff Tunnel is 1940 yards long, goes through hard chalk at a level of 12 feet above high water, and is ventilated by side galleries opening in the face of the cliff. The sea-wall beyond this is three-quarters of a mile long, 23 feet thick at the base, and from 60 to 70 feet high, consists of solid concrete, and is washed on one side by the sea, and overhung on the other by precipitous cliffs from 300 to 400 feet high. The Round Down Level, a space of about 7 acres in the course of the sea-wall, was formed by blasting a mass of chalk 300 feet long, 375 feet high, and 70 feet in mean width; and the blast on one occasion was done by galvanic batteries, with 18,500 Ibs. of gunpowder, making a noiseless explosion which caused the prodigious mass to glide in shattered fragments \"like a stream into the sea.\" The Shakespeare Cliff Tunnel is 1417 yards long, is entered by two pointed parabolic arches, and has two parallel tunnels, each 30 feet by 12, with seven air-shafts and seven lateral outlets to the sea, through which the excavated chalk was discharged. The timber viaduct, close to the town, is 2000 feet long. The tunnel of the L.C .& D.R. from Canterbury passes through the western heights, is 680 yards long, 21^ feet high, and 31 1/4 feet wide, and goes on a level 280 feet below the summit of the hill. Submarine telegraphs go from Dover to Calais and Ostend. The first was originally laid in 1850 to Cape Grisnez, and was the earliest submarine telegraph ever undertaken, but broke in consequence of fretting on a ridge of rocks under the cape, and a successor to it was formed to Sangatte, nearer Calais.\n\nThe Harbour.\n\nDover is the only one of the ancient Cinque ports which has not lost its harbour, and it would long ago have shared the fate of its brethren but for successive large and important government works. Its harbour once extended some way up the valley, but has gradually retreated in consequence of the debris brought down from the hills, and of a shifting bar of shingle. Works were undertaken for it by Henry VIII., which included an enormous pier, and cost Â£80,000. Fresh works were commenced by Elizabeth, and continued by James I., which cost great sums, and kept the harbour open. New works or reconstructions were done in 1737-79 at a cost of Â£22,000. The harbour at present includes the pent or inner harbour, 11^ acres in extent, with an entrance 60 feet wide, the basin or middle harbour 3^ acres, and the outer harbour 7 1/4 acres. The inner dock was enlarged, deepened, and reopened for traffic in 1874. A wet dock and a graving dock are on the west side; a dry dock and basin are to the south of the outer harbour; a quay, constructed in 1841, and admitting vessels of 200 tons, goes 400 feet along the lower side of the pent, and 431 feet on the south-east; a commercial quay, formerly called pent-side, was formed in 1834; an addition of 4 acres to the outer harbour, enclosed by quays, was made in 1844; and a sea-wall, commencing at the north pier-head, and continued along Waterloo Crescent and the Esplanade, was built in 1850. The entrance of the harbour between the piers is 150 feet wide, and has a depth of from 14 to 18 feet of water. A harbour of refuge, immediately outside and eastward, was commenced in 1847. The first portion of the Admiralty pier, which forms the western arm of the harbour, 800 feet long, 90 feet broad at the base, 60 feet broad at the top, and commanding 10 feet of water at the lowest tide, was constructed in 1848-51. A second portion was begun in 1854, and occupied nearly thirty years. It is considered one of finest examples of sea-work in the world. The total cost was nearly Â£1,000,000. Two 81-ton guns were placed at the end of the pier in 1882. The works sustained considerable injury from furious storms in 1850 and 1855, yet continued substantially progressing, and meanwhile did valuable service in stopping the passage of beach which had so often choked the old harbour. In 1893 the Dover Harbour Board commenced the construction of the eastern arm, in order to provide a purely commercial harbour of ample dimensions, and it is expected that it will be completed in about seven years. The new works comprise eastern arm, landing jetties, and Admiralty pier extension. The eastern arm, at a cost of Â£414,000, is to contain a length of 1260 feet of ironwork, beyond which stonework extends to the distance of 1500 feet. The depth of water at entrance at lowest tides will be 40 feet, and the area 60 acres, while the estimated cost is Â£600,000.\n\nTrade, &C.\n\nDover has a head post office, two banks, maintains fully its old character as the chief point of England's communication with the Continent, figures as the head of the Cinque ports with a body of 56 pilots for the Channel service, and publishes four weekly newspapers. Markets are held on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and apart from that connected with the mail and packet service to the Continent,. the trade carried on is chiefly in shipbuilding, sail-making, rope-making, corn-grinding, and the supply of ships' stores.\n\nDover was chartered by Edward I., is governed by a mayor, 6 aldermen, and 18 councillors. The limits of the municipal and parliamentary boroughs are co-extensive. The area is 1256 acres ; population, 33,300. The parliamentary borough returned two members to the House of Commons until the passing of the Redistribution of Seats Act, 1885,. which reduced the number to one. The number of vessels registered as belonging to Dover in 1893 was 47 (3783 tons). The entries and clearances each average 4200' (960,000 tons) per annum. The customs revenue in 1893' was Â£54,160.\n\nD7 Dover St. James\n\nD8 Dover St. Mary\n\nD9 Dover St. Mary In The Castle\n\nGreenwich,\n\na town, a parish, and a parliamentary borough in Kent. The town is suburban to London, within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan police and the Central Criminal Court, and of the London County Council, is separated from Deptford only by the river Ravensboume, and stands on the Thames, opposite the Isle of Dogs, with stations on the L.C. & D.R. and S.E.R., 3 miles by rail and 5 by water SE by E of London Bridge.\n\nHistory.\n\nGreenwich was known to the Saxons as Grenawic, signifying \" Green Town,\" and seems to have taken that name from the verdure of its site, or of its environs, as seen from the Thames. Eitruda, niece of King Alfred, gave it, along with Deptford and Lewisham, about the year 900 to the Abbey of St Peter at Ghent. The Danes took possession of it in 1011 and other years, made camps on the high grounds above it at Blackheath, and slew, on the site of its parish church, Archbishop Alfege, whom they had brought from Canterbury. It figured at Domesday as Grenviz, and belonged then to Bishop Odo. It appears to have soon, by royal grant, reverted to Ghent Abbey; it was held by that establishment till the suppression of alien monasteries by Henry V.; it then reverted to the Crown, hut was soon given to the Carthusian priory of Skene, and at the Reformation it again came back to the Crown. Yet a part of it, apparently from the time of the royal grant to Ghent Abbey, was always reserved by the Crown, and that part, together with the rest, after the Reformation, owing to the pleasantness of the locality add the salubrity of the air, was a favourite residence of the kings and queens of England, and it has ever since been rich in historical associations. Edward I. and some of his successors made it their occasional abode. A splendid tournament was held here in 1217. Henry IV. resided much here, and in 1408 he dated his will from it. Henry V. gave it for life to Thomas Bean-fort, duke of Exeter, on whose death in 1417 it passed to Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, uncle to Henry VI. That duke in 1433 rebuilt or enlarged the manor house, called it Placentia, raised round it some fortifications enclosed in the park, and erected a tower on the site of the present observatory. Edward IV. re-enlarged the palace and founded in its vicinity a minorite friary. Henry VII. made the palace his favourite residence. Henry VIII. was born in it; was baptized in the parish church; married here Catherine of Arragon and Anne of Cloves; kept here his Christmas in 1521, 1525, 1527, 1537, and 1543; held here a series of tournaments and gorgeous spectacles; received here in 1527 a splendid embassy from France; celebrated here in 1536 the festival at which Anne Boleyn was arrested; and generally throughout his reign maintained here a surpassing display of luxury and magnificence. His daughters, Mary and Elizabeth, were born here. Edward VI. died here. Elizabeth, as figured by Shakespeare, was baptized here in the \" Friar's Church; \" as figured by Sir Walter Scott, went here through the scene of Raleigh's first interview, and of his mudded cloak; resided in the palace here during most of her reign; was entertained in the park in 1539 by the city of London; received here in 1585 the Dutch deputies, offering her the Crown of the Low Countries; received here in 1586 and 1597 embassies from Denmark and Poland; was seen here in 1598 in all her magnificence of costume by Hentzner the traveller; and watched from the windows of the palace here the vessels of her adventurous seamen as they floated past on their way to fresh discoveries in the new world. James I. resided a considerable time here, and his queen, Anne of Denmark, improved the palace, walled in the park, and laid the foundation of \" The House of Delight.\" Their daughter, the Princess Mary, was baptized here with great pomp in 1606, Charles I., previous to the Civil War, often resided here, and his queen, Henrietta Maria, completed Queen Anne's \" House of Delight.\" Charles II., after the Restoration, occasionally resided here, ordered the demolition of the decaying palace, and commenced the building of a new one on a most splendid scale, but was not able to erect more of it than what now forms a portion of the western wing of the present royal hospital The palace was finished by William and Mary. Queen Mary, in 1688, George I., and the mother of George III., landed at Greenwich. Lord Nelson's body was brought here in 1805-6 from Trafalgar. George IV. embarked here amid a vast display of magnificence in 1822 for Scotland. Sir W. Boreham, of the time of Charles II., resided in an old carved house near Crawley's Wharf. Dr Johnson, in 1737, \" struck with the seat that gave Eliza birth,\" lodged in the house in Church Street next the \" Golden Hart,\" and during walks in the park composed great part of his \" Irene.\" Lord Chesterfield lived in what became the Ranger's house. Vanbrugh built on Maze Hill a residence after the model of the Bastille, and called Vanbrugh House. Dr Bumey had a school in Stock-well Street, and Dr Crombie near Maze Hill chapel. Admirals Lawson and Leake also were residents, and Ducarel the antiquary, Goddard the Gresham professor, and Munro the physician were natives. Greenwich gave the title of Duke to the great Argyle.\n\nEnvirons and Streets.\n\nThe park and Blackheath on one side, and the Thames on the other, give Greenwich very fine environs. See BLACKHEATH. The approach by the Thames is eminently striking. Its highest attraction is the magnificent hospital, presenting to the river an imposing range of beautiful though unadorned Grecian buildings, extending for several hundred feet along its side, and divided into two wings by a noble lawn, with a terrace and handsome approach by steps to the river. The ever-green verdure of the lawn forms a very striking and pleasing relief to the massive pillars and porticos with which it is surrounded. Each wing recedes to a considerable distance from the river, and is crowned in its retreat by a lofty dome, behind all which rise the hills of the park, their verdure broken into various shades by its groves of elm, pine, and chestnut, and the summit adorned by the Royal Observatory. The older parts of the town are very irregularly built. Most of their streets axe narrow, and have insignificant houses, yet some modern parts, with a spacious street leading from the parish church to the hospital, and with a continuation of the road beyond the hospital to the lower Woolwich Eoad, are great improvements. A new town also has arisen in the east. Numerous elegant villas are on the outskirts, in the vicinity of Blackheath.\n\nPublic Buildings.\n\nThe market-house was rebuilt in 1831. The court-house, in Burney Street, is a place of county courts for Greenwich, Deptford, Lewisham, Ridbrook Eitham, and Mottingham. There is a theatre and a music hall. The public baths and wash-houses in London Street were built in 1851, and are a neat structure in the Jacobean style. The lecture hall, on the Royal Hill, is the home of the Greenwich Literary and Recreation Institute. The monument to Lieutenant Bellot, the Arctic navigator, stands in front of the left wing of the Royal Hospital, was erected by public subscription, and is an obelisk of red granite, inscribed simply with Bellot's name. The other noticeable public structures are mostly of far higher mark, and will be noticed in subsequent, paragraphs.\n\nChurches.\n\nThe livings within Greenwich parish are St Alphege, Trinity, Christ Church, St Paul, St Peter, and St Mary; and all are vicarages in the diocese of Rochester. Value of St Alphege, Â£260 with residence. Patron, the Crown. Trinity, Â£4: 00 gross value. Patron, the Vicar of Greenwich. Christ Church, Â£500 gross value with residence. Patron, the Vicar of Greenwich. St Paul, Â£450 gross value, united with residence. St Peter, Â£315 with residence. St Mary united with St Alphege. The old church of St Alphege was ancient, had a chantry belonging to a guild of the Holy Cross, contained a portrait on glass of Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, contained also a monument to the antiquary Lambard, which was removed to Sevenoaks, contained likewise several other monuments and brasses, one of which was to Thomas Tallis, king's musician in the time of Henry VIIL, and became ruinous in 1710. The present church was built in 1718, was one of Queen Anne's fifty new churches, is a large edifice in poor, mixed Grecian style, has a square tower, with cupola and small spire, and contains portraits of Charles I., Queen Anne, and George L There were buried, in the churchyard, Admiral Stainer, who was famous during the Protectorate, General Wolfe, the conqueror of Quebec, the Duchess of Bolton, the original \" Polly Peachum\" of Gay's opera, Lord Aylmer, Sir C. Hardy, and the author Newcourt. The interior was thoroughly restored in 1869. Christ Church was built in 1849, St Paul's Church in 1868, St Peter's Church in 1865. St Mary's is a chapel of ease to the parish church of St Alphege. A Presbyterian chapel and a Roman catholic chapel are handsome structures. There are also three Congregational, two Baptist, and two \"Wesleyan chapels, a mission church at East Greenwich, and a mission chapel.\n\nThe Hospital and Soy al Naval College.\n\nThe palace founded by Charles II., forming the west wing of the hospital, was begun in 1664, after designs by Webb, and completed in 1698, under the direction of Wren. The edifice was converted by William and Mary into an asylum for disabled seamen of the royal navy, was grandly extended in their reign and in that of Anne, was first opened for the reception of \" pensioners \" in 1705, and was much enlarged in the time of George IV. The style is Ionic, the general design is the original one by Webb, colonnades, cupolas, and the features of the great hall are by Wren, and brick buildings to the west are by Van-brugh. A terrace in front, on the river, is 875 feet long, and a great quadrangle is a square of 273 feet. A statue of George II., by Rysbrach, is in the centre of the quadrangle, and was cut from a block of marble, weighing 11 tons, taken from the French by Sir George Rooke. The buildings form four great masses or courts-the western one near the river King Charles', the eastern one near the river Queen Anne's, the north-western one King William's, the north-eastern one Queen Mary's. The great hall is in King William's building, measures 106 feet in length, 56 feet in width, and 50 feet in height, is well-proportioned and artistic, has emblematic paintings over the ceiling and the side walls, executed by Su-James Thornhill, between 1708 and 1727, at a cost of Â£6685, and occasioning it to be often called the painted hall, and contains pictures of illustrious admirals and famous battles, collected chiefly through the exertions of Edward H. Locker, Esq., memorials of Nelson exhibited in a glass-case, and a marble statue of Captain Sir William Peel, erected by his brother, the Hon. Frederick Peel, in 1861. The chapel is in Queen Mary's building, has the same dimensions as the great hall, was rebuilt after a destructive fire in 1789, under direction of \" Athenian Stewart,\" and contains an altar-piece of the shipwreck of St Paul, by West, a monument to .Admiral Sir Richard G. Reats, by Chantrey, and a monument to Admiral Sir Thomas Hardy, by Behnes. A library is in King Charles' building, and has a bust of Dibdin, the author of the famous naval songs. The income of the hospital includes aa annual parliamentary grant of Â£20, 000, the proceeds of the large estates of the Earl of Derwentwater, forfeited in 1715, and the proceeds of various private bequests, including particularly one of Â£20, 000 by Robert Osbaldeston, and amounts to upwards of Â£130, 000 a year. The Painted Hall and the chapel are open to the public. The hospital formerly received about 2700 pensioners, but, by an Act of Parliament, out-pensioners were substituted, and the buildings are now occupied as a Royal Naval College, receiving for this purpose 700 students, all officers of the Royal Navy and Marine Artillery and Engineers being admitted, as well as a limited number of the officers of the mercantile marine. The old infirmary of the hospital, situated to the west of the main buildings, has been occupied since 1870 by the Seamen's Hospital Society; the society receives no aid from Government beyond the free use of the building.\n\nThe Hospital School.\n\nThis institution was incorporated with the Royal Hospital in 1825. The building stands between the hospital and the park, includes at its centre the edifice which was called the \" House of Delight,\" which was the residence of Henrietta Maria, Queen of Charles I., and which, next to Whitehall banqueting-house, is, the best extant memorial of the palaces of the Stuarts,' consists of two wings, each 146 feet long, connected by a colonnade 180 feet long, serves for the training of the sons of seamen to the sea service, is arranged into two schools, upper and lower, with 400 boys in each, and has good play-grounds, gymnastic apparatus, a rigged ship for instruction and exercise, and a small observatory.\n\nThe Park.\n\nThis extends from the Royal Hospital to the high ground of Blackheath, comprises about 200 acres,, is agreeably diversified with height and hollow, presents within itself very pleasing scenery, and commands, from two eminences, most charming views. One of these eminences is that surmounted by the Observatory, and looks away over London and the Thames, and the other bears the name of the One-Tree Hill, is situated near the east border, and looks away so far as to Windsor Castle. \" Would you believe,\" said Walpole to Bentley, in 1755, \"I had never been in Greenwich ParkÂ£ I never had, and am transported. Even the glories of Richmond and Twickenham hide their diminished heads.\" The park, as it now exists, is only about one-half of the original one connected with the royal palace, and it was laid out, in the time of Charles II., by the famous Le Notre, who presided over the gardens of Versailles. The elms in it are said by Evelyn to have been planted in 1664, but the Spanish chestnuts, though arranged in regular avenues similarly to the elms, appear to be of greater age. The park is open to the public. Greenwich Fair, notable for frolic, was partly held in it, during Whitsun week, till 185 6, and was then abolished. Numerous tumuli, containing spear-heads, human bones, and other relics, were within the park.\n\nThe Royal Observatory.\n\nThis stands on an eminence in the park, about 300 feet above the level of the Thames. Its site was occupied by a tower called Mirefleur, built by Duke Humphrey, and said to have been the original of the Tower of Miraflores figuring in \" Amadis de Gaul.\" The older part of the observatory was erected in 1675, after designs by Wren; the lower part is the residence of the astronomer-royal. The parts in sight are little used for any operations; but two turrets on the leads are in constant active service. One of them has an anemometer, for hourly registering the direction and force of the wind; and the other has a time-ball, about 6 feet in diameter, which drops at one o'clock, notes the time to the shipping on the Thames, and telegraphs it to time-balls and signal-guns at distant stations. Meridional observations of the sun, the moon, and the stars are regularly made, to the aggregate of upwards of 5000 in the year.; magnetic observations also are made, the choicest instruments of the London chronometer-makers are brought hither to be tested, and all English charts and maps reckon from this point the degrees of longitude, E and W. The first astronomer-royal appointed for the observatory was Flamsteed, and others have been Halley, Bradley, Maskelyne, Pond, Airy, and Christie. The cost of maintaining the observatory is about Â£10, 000 per annum.\n\nSchools aad Charities.\n\nThe proprietary school was established in 1849, gives a first-class education at moderate expense, and has an average attendance of 150 pupils. Eoan's Grey-Coat School was founded in 1643, educates and clothes poor native boys of Greenwich parish. Foreman's Green-Coat School was founded in 1672, educates and supports sons of native seamen, watermen, or fishermen. The Blue-Coat School was founded in 1752, educates and supports poor native girls. National schools are at Church Passage and Blackheath Hill; industrial schools at East Greenwich and Blackheath Hill; infant schools at East Street, Lamb Lane, and Blackheath Hill; and a mission school for girls at Trafalgar Eoad. Queen Elizabeth's college was founded by Lambarde the antiquary in 1558, had originally an income of Â£104, devoted to the maintenance of 24 men and their wives, has acquired additional income from bequests, underwent enlargement in 1819 by the erection of tenements for aged persons, and gives an allowance of Â£20 to each almsman. Trinity Hospital, commonly called Norfolk College, was founded in 1613 by the Earl of Northampton, has a square central tower, gives support to poor men of Greenwich and Shottesham parishes, and has an income of Â£660, The Jubilee almshouses were erected in 1809, in honour of the jubilee of the 50th year of the reign of King George IIL; other houses were added to these from time to time, but in 1878-79 the whole of them were taken down and rebuilt, and they now form a handsome block of 14 houses facing the Greenwich Road. The Penn almshouses were erected in 1884 by Mrs Ellen Penn, in memory of her husband, and consist of 9 houses. There are several smaller almshouses in the town. The total amount of charities is very considerable.\n\nTrade, &c.\n\nGreenwich has several post offices under London, S.E., a bank, and numerous hotels and taverns, and publishes two newspapers. Large support accrues to it from the visits of pleasure-parties from London, especially during the white-bait season; much to the lower classes accrues from employment on the river, and much to the operative classes from roperies, a spinning flax factory, iron foundries, iron steamboat works, engineering establishments, and some extensive factories for the supply of materials connected with shipping. Markets are held on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Greenwich, with the parishes of Charlton, Ridbrook, and St Nicholas (Deptford), forms the parliamentary borough of Greenwich under the Redistribution of Seats Act, 1885, sending one member to Parliament. Previously, with an extended area, it sent two members. The population of the parliamentary borough is 78, 167. Greenwich also contributes four members to the London School Board, and under the Local Government Act, 1888, is included in the county of London. It is governed by a district board of works, consisting of 99 members. A portion of the works of the South Metropolitan Gas Company are situated in this parish, and occupy 127 acres in Greenwich Marshes. The workhouse is in Woolwich Road."
