        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nI FIRST ENCOUNTERED Queen of France Isabeau of Bavaria (1371–1435) in Christine de Pizan scholarship. The queen in this context is frequently deployed as a foil, her greed and turpitude contrasted with the moralizing Christine’s righteousness.1 Because the queen is a peripheral figure in studies of Christine’s work, I did not question the depiction initially. On the contrary, I was guilty of perpetuating it, uncritically, in one of my own articles.2 But the frequent references to the queen as a cupidinous woman of dubious morality began to strike me as out of place in a body of scholarship devoted to a figure who was herself a champion of women. Moreover, the scholarship gave no documentation for the charges. Increasingly curious, I began to search for what might lie behind them, turning to histories of medieval France for information.\n\nIn these volumes I discovered the lascivious spendthrift with whom I was familiar from Christine de Pizan scholarship. A history of the Hundred Years Wars published in 2008 remarks coyly that “il [Louis of Orleans] serre d’un peu trop près sa belle-soeur, la jeune et jolie Isabeau de Bavière, la reine. Cette brunette ardente a vingt-deux ans; son mari est fou, et son séduisant beau-frère adore la faire danser. A partir de là, on peut tout imaginer” (he [Louis of Orleans] clung a bit too closely to his sister-in-law, the young and pretty Isabeau of Bavaria, the queen. This ardent brunette was twenty-two; her husband was insane, and her seductive brother-in-law loved to dance with her. Beyond that, we can imagine all sorts of things).3 A study of medieval nobility depicts her stashing away a personal fortune as her people suffered.4 A history of the University of Paris decries the destructive results of her supposed political opportunism: “En soutenant des partis contradictoires, la reine Isabeau de Bavière conduisit la France à des luttes fratricides dont l’enjeu était la conquête de pouvoir” (By supporting opposing parties, the queen Isabeau of Bavaria led France into fraternal battles the stakes of which were power).5 A study of Capetian women and regency claims that “Isabeau increased her wealth and power but preferred a life of entertainment and celebration to the establishment of political domination. According to the drift of the moment, she allied herself with whomever seemed likely to triumph.”6 She is regarded as empty-headed and too attached to her German family: “On ignorait ses idées. En avait-elle d’ailleurs? Seules ses inclinations étaient claires. Elle était très liée à son frère Louis de Bavière.” (No one knew her ideas. Indeed, did she have any? Only her inclinations were clear: she was extremely close to her brother, Louis of Bavaria.)7 Her incompetence is taken for granted: “La reine semble surtout n’avoir eu aucune capacité politique” (The queen seems above all to have had no political skill).8 She is an unnatural mother who had long since “épuisé les joies de la maternité. Une nouvelle grossesse ne pouvait la réjouir qu’en lui offrant le prétexte de se faire octroyer encore quelque bagatelle, un droit de péage, une abbaye, un château entouré de bonnes terres” (lost all joy in maternity. She took pleasure in a new pregnancy only insofar as it offered her the pretext for claiming a new gift, the right to a toll road, an abbey, a chateau surrounded by productive land).9 In a history of Joan of Arc we learn that Charles VII, dauphin led to Rheims by Joan of Arc, “might have quickly united the country were it not for the base act of a wanton woman,” Isabeau of Bavaria.10 In earlier years, Isabeau had “supported the debauched Duke of Orléans against Philip the Bold,” but later she teamed up with Philip the Bold’s son, Jean sans Peur, sometimes known in English as John the Fearless, to conspire against her son, Charles. From there she went on to take over the government, and, from this position, she “kindled the flames of civil war.” The author concludes with the pronouncement: “In the name of this unnatural woman, who had been exiled from Paris on account of her scandalous behavior, the Burgundians ravaged the centre and south of France.”\n\nAnd as if this were not enough, Isabeau is alleged to have been grossly overweight. “At the end of her life,” we are told, “she was grotesquely fat, to the point that her obesity made it doubtful that she could act as regent of the kingdom. She suffered from gout, and by 1425 she had to get around in a wheelchair.”11 Referring to the period of 1416–17 when the Armagnacs held power in Paris and the two dauphins Louis and Jean had just died in quick succession, another historian places the primary blame for Isabeau’s failure to take control of the government on her excess poundage: “Il restait Isabeau. Mais alourdie par l’embonpoint, peut-être désemparée par le décès de ses deux fils, elle ne semble pas avoir joué alors un rôle prépondérant dans la vie politique.” (Only Isabeau remained. But overweight, and perhaps distressed by the deaths of her two sons, she seems not to have played an important role in political life.)12\n\nSurely where there is smoke there is fire, I thought. And yet, when I tried to verify the charges, I could not. The histories from which I have just quoted do not cite contemporary references, but each other, in a seemingly endless feedback loop. Moreover, their favorite adjectives for describing the queen—wanton, cupidinous, obese—give pause, representing as they do a litany of traditional misogynistic complaints. Claims that on the surface suggest misogyny deserve skepticism.\n\nThus I continued to research, seeking more specialized information, and finally came upon the small body of scholarship specifically focused on the queen. The difference between the Isabeau I discovered there and the promiscuous creature of the more general histories was nothing less than astounding. To begin, the few scholars who have studied her in any detail are unanimous in their assessment that the adultery charge is a fantasy, resulting primarily from the misreading of two documents dating from the queen’s lifetime. The first is a single paragraph in the chronicle of Michel Pintoin, known today as the Religieux or Monk of St. Denis. Because the passage bears the weight of proving what would have been considered by contemporary standards the queen’s incestuous affair (an affair with her brother-in-law would have constituted incest), I reproduce it here in full. Pintoin writes that in spring of 1405 Jacques Legrand, a well-known preacher whose patron was none other than the king’s brother Louis, the Duke of Orleans, gave a sermon at court that targeted the duke and Isabeau.13\n\nThe sermon began, writes Pintoin:\n\nIn tua curia domina Venus solium occupans, ipsi eciam obsequntur ebrietas et commessacio, que noctes vertunt in diem, continuantes choreas dissolutas. Hee maledicte et infernales pedissece, curiam assidue ambientes, mores viresque enervant plurium et impediunt sepius ne milites vel scutiferi delicati adeant expediciones bellicas, ne in aliqua parte corporis deformentur.\n\n[Lady Venus occupies the throne in your court: certainly drunkenness and debauchery follow her, turning night into day, with continual dissolute dancing. Oh, the cursed and infernal lackeys, who constantly inhabit your court, greatly sap morals and strength and impede soldiers’ going on military expeditions, squeamish as they are about becoming deformed in different body parts.]14\n\nPintoin then interjects that Legrand next turned his attention to fashion at the court:\n\nAd dissolucionem eciam habituum, cujus inventrix regina fuerat principalis, descendens, cum ipsam mulipliciter reprobasset, subintulit: “Hec et multa alia, o regina, in opprobrium curie tue dicuntur. Que si non velis credere, in habitu mulieris paupercule eundo per civitatem, audies ab infinitis personis.”\n\n[Moving on to the dissoluteness of their clothing, of which the queen had been a principal instigator and whom he reproached in many ways, he carried on: “This and many other things, oh Queen, are said about your court to its disgrace. If you do not want to believe this, if you put on the clothes of a poor woman and walk through the streets of the city, you will hear it from many people.”]15\n\nThat Louis of Orleans was Legrand’s patron makes the likelihood that the preacher would publicly accuse him of adultery with the queen remote, to say the least. Furthermore, as R. C. Famiglietti points out, the passage in no way supports the charge of adultery. “From the information given by the Monk of Saint-Denis about the sermon, however, it appears that the only thing Legrand held against Isabeau was the fact that she had introduced new styles of dress which he could not approve. Of course, since she was the queen, he considered her responsible in general for the actions of her courtiers. But he seems to have thought she was not aware of the truly scandalous nature of their behaviour.”16\n\nFamiglietti then observes that a scurrilous pamphlet called the “Songe véritable,” making the rounds at roughly the same time, neatly proves that rumors of queenly adultery could not have been circulating in 1405–6, for among the faults attributed to Isabeau therein, adultery is conspicuously lacking. The pamphlet, he writes, “is a valuable aid in the assessment of the charges made by scholars against the queen, for here is a work that attacks Isabeau with vehemence, and yet states that her reputation was intact until a sudden change occurred… . If, indeed, there had been even the merest suspicions of an adulterous relationship between the queen and the duke of Orleans, would not the author have used them somewhere in this poem? He was certainly close enough to the court to have heard such gossip, if it existed, for he was able to name and vilify in the ‘Songe’ many members of Isabeau’s household.”17\n\nThe second source that has been held out as proof of the queen’s adultery is the Treaty of Troyes, signed in 1420 to declare Henry V of England heir to the throne of France. However, recent historians explain that to read the Treaty of Troyes as the queen’s admission of her own guilt is to mistranslate a common expression used in the treaty, “so-called” (soi-disant).18 The context of the expression is as follows:\n\nConsidéré les orribles et énormes crimes et deliz perpetrez oudit royaume de France par Charles soy disant daulphin de viennois, il est accordé que nous, ne nostredit filz le Roy Henry, ne aussi nostre chier filz Phelippe duc de Bourgoigne, ne traicterons aucunement de paix ou de concorde avecques ledit Charles, ne ferons ou ferons traictier senon du conseil et assentement de tous et chascun de nous trois, et des trois estas de deux royaumes.\n\n[Considering the horrible and enormous crimes perpetrated upon the Kingdom of France by Charles, the so-called dauphin of Vienne, it has been agreed that neither ourselves nor our son the King Henry nor our very dear son Philip the Duke of Burgundy will make any peace treaties with said Charles, nor will we make or have any made except with the council and agreement of all three of us and the three estates of our two kingdoms.]19\n\nEarly historians, already believing in Isabeau’s promiscuity, read soi-disant as a veiled reference to Charles’s paternity and wove the insult into a narrative of degraded motherhood. But recent historians agree that the interpretation cannot be justified: soi-disant, they explain, was part of standard insult vocabulary, challenging the bearer of a title’s fitness for the title. Employed in exchanges between Charles of Orleans and his cousin Jean sans Peur, the insult had a long history. As Pintoin reveals, Charles VI himself used the expression to refer to his son, future Charles VII, to whom he denied the title of dauphin for his role in the assassination of Jean sans Peur. As far as Charles VI is concerned, his son is the “so-called” rather than true dauphin. Just after the assassination of Jean sans Peur, writes Pintoin, a flurry of letters sent out by the king spread the news of the act. These letters concluded with the announcement that the dauphin would henceforth be forbidden any title but that of “so-called dauphin.”20\n\nIn addition to adultery, the queen has been cleared of the other crimes with which she has long been charged. In a scholarly biography in German of 1969 Heidrunn Kimm extricated the queen’s black legend from what is verifiable, revealing the influence of nineteenth-century anti-German sentiment upon her political reputation. Kimm’s work was followed by a series of articles by Yann Grandeau published during the 1970s, in which the author made a strong case for an active, politically savvy queen, a woman “dont l’intelligence était vive” (whose intelligence was acute).21 She alone of the king’s entourage understood the gravity of the coup of Jean sans Peur of 1408, writes Grandeau, and the necessity of grooming the dauphin Louis to take the place of his father at that point if the Valois dynasty was to survive. “Menant le jeu des coulisses et donnant à chacun l’exemple de la sérénité,” he continues, “elle poursuivit avec clairvoyance et ténacité une politique centriste.” (Directing the game from the sidelines and giving an impression of serenity to all, she followed a centrist political line with foresight and tenacity.). In a 1981 article, Theodor Straub revisited the black legend to show its lack of basis in history. R. C. Famiglietti’s Royal Intrigue of 1986 offers a sympathetic portrait of the woman who promoted her son, the dauphin Louis of Guyenne, as a safeguard against the monarchy’s disintegration.22 Rachel C. Gibbons’s Alexander prize–winning “Isabeau of Bavaria, Queen of France: The Creation of an Historical Villainess” and 1997 doctoral dissertation devoted to Isabeau studied the queen’s political astuteness. Gibbons characterizes her as the sole member of the royal family capable of preserving the monarchy, a woman “whose often adept handling of diplomacy, including her support and promotion of the dauphin Louis during his teenage years, have been largely ignored or dismissed in histories of the period.”23\n\nIsabeau’s career, then, has been revised. But this scholarship only makes the continued existence of the queen’s black legend all the more surprising. As Ronald Schechter has written, “Once a fact becomes ‘common knowledge’ the historian is released from the obligation to cite a source, and only a determined effort to falsify it can dislodge it from the bricolage of generally accepted facts that constitute the historical canon.”24 This may be true. And yet, in the bodies of writings devoted to other notorious queens, one generally observes a clear distinction between the way they are portrayed in serious history, on the one hand, and popular history and historical fiction, on the other. Recent studies of the Religious Wars in France recognize Catherine de Médicis to be a victim of partisan propaganda.25 Likewise, scholarly studies of Marie-Antoinette take their subject seriously, considering that queen carefully within her context.26 The difference between the crimes that clearly biased contemporaries report Marie-Antoinette to have committed (for example, incest) and her verifiable acts is routinely maintained.\n\nDespite the excellent scholarship already available, then, work on Isabeau remains to be done. The present study originates in my interest in the incommensurateness between the queen’s reputation and the historically verifiable elements of her career. I began by rereading the historical sources, all of which had all been uncovered and studied, and I reiterate what other studies devoted to the queen have discovered: that the contemporary evidence does not support the black legend. On the contrary, the Isabeau who emerges from the sources is a diligent peacemaker, devoted to her mad husband and dedicated to saving the throne for her son. Thus a major goal of this study is to understand the tenacity of the black legend. I trace the evolution of the mythology surrounding the queen, explaining why it has been so resistant to challenge. But beyond this, I have come to believe that Isabeau’s life is in itself worthy of further study. The queen’s career has been misunderstood, I argue, with some attributing her too much authority and some too little. This is because neither the role assigned her nor her performance of it has been reconstructed against contemporary expectations of what she was meant to be doing. Royal ordinances dated 1402, 1403, and 1407 seem to grant extensive regency powers to the queen. Certain of the depictions of her within contemporary chronicles suggest that she was considered an important figure and regarded with reverence. Yet, other depictions dating from her lifetime belie the image of a powerful Isabeau. She receives virtually none of the attention that would indicate the anxiety generally associated with powerful women. Unlike the queen of her grandson, Henry VI, Marguerite of Anjou, who was also summoned to a position of authority by her husband’s insanity, Isabeau is never condemned in the chronicles for warmongering or over-stepping the bounds of her office.27 Nor is she ever during her own lifetime accused of illicit affairs, an attack routinely leveled at powerful women.28 These apparently conflicting sources have led to the widely diverse assessments among modern historians of the extent and nature of Isabeau’s authority. But the contemporary documents cohere when Isabeau is placed in a framework that has received a good deal of attention in recent studies: that of the mediator queen. The mediator queen fulfilled a multivalent role that included not only ritualistic functions associated with peacemaking but also the practical activities of intercession, arbitration, and filling in for her husband when he was absent.29 A complex of images defined and idealized the role, the most potent of which were Esther and the Virgin Mary.\n\nThe role of the medieval and early modern mediator queen has been discussed in a number of contributions over the past two decades by such scholars as John Carmi Parsons, Fanny Cosandey, Lois L. Huneycutt, Margaret Howell, Elizabeth McCartney, Helen E. Maurer, and others.30 Although the role varied across time and space, it can be generalized by the quality that Louise Olga Fradenburg designates “interstitiality” or “in-betweenness.” Mediator queens caused things to happen through networking, through working behind the scenes. Fradenburg writes that “the condition of many forms of queenship may be found not so much in the glamorized, special suspended states associated with communitas as in the fact of queens’ being so often at the nodal points of cultural work.”31 Isabeau’s role in the government as articulated in royal ordinances demonstrates that her primary function was mediatory. Charged with appeasing dangerous rivals, she worked from a position located both inside and outside of the Royal Council, over which she presided when the king was mentally incapable of doing so. A substitute for the king, acting on her husband’s behalf, she possessed no real power independent of him. Throughout her career she styled herself as a mediator, as the force guiding the Valois dynasty through the illness of the king, working to keep the kingdom intact by reconciling its warring factions.\n\nSo that Isabeau’s career as a mediator queen can be examined afresh, the first two chapters of this study aim to free the queen from the burden of her black legend. A pivotal third chapter then lays out recent theories about mediator queens and, through a discussion of Isabeau’s own mediating activity, argues that her career gains coherence when reexamined within this framework. In each of the five remaining chapters, I explore a different narrative strand introduced in the opening chapters. The overall format, thus, is not chronological, but thematic.\n\nBecause many readers will not be familiar with the details of this queen’s career, chapter one, “Isabeau of Bavaria: Her Life,” narrates the major events of her life against the tangled and deadly Armagnac-Burgundian feud and the Hundred Years War. But the chapter has another purpose: to demonstrate how different the queen’s story appears when it is emptied of the bias that has so often marked it. Certainly any narrative must be recounted from a perspective, and I will justify mine in chapter three. However, quite different from perspectives are inaccuracies, and, as we have seen, the notion of Isabeau’s immorality is an inaccuracy, or, least, it cannot be verified. It is important, therefore, to approach the documents again. This is not to whitewash the queen, but to ask which interpretations the evidence will bear when read minus the lingering influence of the tales of debauchery. I suggest that the story that appears is that of a woman who, thrust into the formidable task of preserving the monarchy from the incursions of the king’s powerful male relatives, exercised her role with skill and dignity according to a traditional model that permitted women to take on the role of an absent man, carving out a role for herself that I describe in later chapters as coregency.\n\nChapter two, “Isabeau of Bavaria: Her Afterlife,” explores the queen’s status as lieu de mémoire, to borrow the terminology coined by Pierre Nora. The transformation of her life into a scandalous narrative took place in several distinct phases. The first was the development of the legend of her promiscuity. Although no evidence, at least official, suggests that the English believed Charles VII to be a bastard, the fact that claims to the English throne—most notably that of Edward, son of Henry VI—were countered with the charge that the claimant was illegitimate raises the suspicion that a similar strategy might have been employed to harm Charles VII. Once in place, the rumor of Isabeau’s promiscuity developed in a number of different directions, giving birth to a rich folklore. A second, independent strand of the black legend was developed by sixteenth- and seventeenth-century legal historians concerned with female regency. As the king slowly consolidated his power beginning in the late sixteenth century, the ubiquitous factionalism of the fifteenth century became incomprehensible to legal historians studying that period. Reading Isabeau’s depiction in chronicles and official documents, some legal historians began to see her flexible alliance building, standard behavior during her own time, as a negative tendency, as a sign of her political divisiveness. In the eighteenth century, the discovery of documents related to the Cour amoureuse, the renowned love court at the time of Charles VI, shored up the image of the debauched Isabeau. Later in the century, the various negative traits attributed her converge in the outrageous history of the queens of France by Louise de Keralio, whose Isabeau is a prototype for Marie-Antoinette. During the nineteenth century, magnificently entertaining stories of an adulterous, luxurious, meddlesome, scheming, and spendthrift queen flourished under the pens of historians like Michelet and, later Marcel Thibault, who, even as he claimed to be regarding the evidence surrounding the queen objectively, incorporated her story into a larger narrative of French nationalism.32 It is hardly surprising that patriotic nineteenth-century French historians would be biased against a Bavarian queen. But what is perhaps surprising is their intensely ludic attitude towards the queen. They freely admit that their interpretations of Isabeau are speculative but go on proposing them nonetheless. Isabeau’s usefulness as a figure against which to construct nationalism appears to have been more compelling than any obligation to historical accuracy.\n\nThe first two chapters, then, are intended to wipe the slate on Isabeau clean and allow a beginning from zero. In chapter three, I present and support the framework I have chosen for retelling Isabeau’s story. Drawing on the insights offered by recent scholarship on mediating queens and medieval violence and its remedies, the chapter builds a context within which Isabeau’s search for peace appears responsible rather than vacillating, weak, or opportunistic. In response to histories that have focused on the apparent failure of the queen’s repeated peace negotiations, this chapter places her activity in the context of scholarship on medieval violence and the rituals associated with its containment. Most important, the chapter attempts to extricate in more detail than has been offered in the past exactly what Isabeau’s position on the Royal Council involved. The history of France during this period has been thoroughly and expertly treated. But Isabeau’s role during this time been very little noted, and this the chapter aims to remedy.\n\nEach of the next chapters revisits an issue or set of related issues particular to Isabeau’s queenship that has been misrepresented somehow over the years. Chapter four, “Isabeau’s Contemporary Reputation,” makes the controversial, but, I believe, accurate claim that Isabeau was not badly viewed during her own time. It is taken for granted that Isabeau was disliked by her contemporaries. We read, for example, that “Isabeau of Bavaria’s dreadful reputation was strongly reinforced by the chronicles. Since rumors against her were often floating around Paris, one cannot really fault a historian for recording them.”33 A number of studies of injurious language have included the queen as an example of powerful women damaged by mala fama, bad reputation, resulting from gossip.34 Even Isabeau’s champions routinely assume that her reputation suffered in 1405 because of her close political association with the king’s brother, Louis of Orleans.35 And yet, surprising as it may seem, criticism of the queen from her period is limited to two sources, both of which I have mentioned above. They are the chronicle of Michel Pintoin (which records four criticisms of the queen in the year 1405), and the scurrilous pamphlet the “Songe véritable,” of about 1406, circulated by a Burgundian supporter.36 It is no coincidence that in 1405 Jean sans Peur had just succeeded his father as Duke of Burgundy. One of his first acts was to come to Paris to solicit the royal funding that had ceased abruptly with his father’s death. Jean’s demands met with stubborn resistance by the Royal Council. What could have been more natural than for the duke to send his men to claim to a chronicler that Louis of Orleans and Isabeau were mismanaging the realm to justify his demand for royal funds? Neither source, I argue, can be regarded as a reflection of a widespread dislike of the queen.\n\nIn chapter five, “Isabeau of Bavaria and the Cour amoureuse,” I examine an example of the queen’s self-representation as arbitrator, that is, her involvement in the poetic society known as the Cour amoureuse. None of the rare recent scholarship on the institution mentions Isabeau. And yet, she was central to its foundation. Created in the beginning years of what was shaping up to be a catastrophic feud, this “love court,” in which love poetry written by the male members was judged by the female members, must have been intended as a means of articulating and ordering the passions that eventually led to violence, as a means of symbolically dramatizing and working out tensions. Typically, Isabeau can be found both at the center and on the margins of political activity. Her role in the institution was essential—ladies are the judges—and yet she was excluded from membership—only men could compete. Thus the Cour amoureuse can be seen as an emblem for the position of women in fifteenth-century French society and for the mediator queen, and as a forum for Isabeau to present a positive image of herself as arbitrator.\n\nChapter six, “Reinterpreting the Enlèvement du dauphin,” revisits the episode from the queen’s life that elicited the well-known intervention of Christine de Pizan, “Une Epistre a la Royne de France” (“An Epistle to the Queen of France”), to consider how the queen managed one dangerous situation. This 1405 episode, a struggle for physical possession of the dauphin Louis, was set in motion when Jean sans Peur, attempting to rally the Parisians to support a coup of the government, chased down and returned the dauphin to Paris, after Isabeau had summoned the boy to her side. Specialists in Christine de Pizan, influenced by the scholarship of Léon Mirot, who adopts the Duke of Burgundy’s version of the event, treat the queen as indifferent to the cause of peace and motivated by greed and her attachment to Louis of Orleans.37 In contrast, I argue that Isabeau’s actions throughout the episode represent a strategy to restore the peace, itself part of her larger strategy to keep the Valois monarchy intact. I conclude by considering how certain of Christine’s writings, including “An Epistle,” are intended to rally support behind the queen by helping to reinforce her image as mediator.\n\nChapter seven, “Revisiting the Treaty of Troyes,” reexamines the events surrounding the notorious document. Perhaps more than any other event in the queen’s life, the Treaty of Troyes of 1420 demands consideration; the most important recent study devoted to Isabeau, Gibbons’ dissertation, ends in 1417. Isabeau has long been reviled for her part in the treaty, which she is assumed by many to have signed “sous l’empire de la vengeance et de la peur” (under the regime of vengeance and fear) and which “consacra la déchéance de la monarchie, la ruine de la France et son propre déshonneur” (assured the fall of the monarchy, the ruin of France, and her own dishonor).38 And yet, Pintoin, certainly no fan of the English occupation, notes the joy with which Parisians welcomed news of the accord.39 Indeed, the Treaty of Troyes has been seen by some recent historians as a triumph for the French and a disaster for the English.40 In this chapter, I argue that Isabeau’s signing of the treaty should not be seen as an unpatriotic act but as a reasonable attempt at a solution to the war. Those who opposed the treaty were not French patriots or idealists refusing collaboration with the enemy. Rather, they were bound by kinship, marriage, or feudal obligation to the Armagnac faction, a faction to which the dauphin Charles adhered only by chance (although married to Marie of Anjou, whose family staunchly supported the Armagnacs, he had earlier been scheduled to marry Anne of Burgundy) and which had itself been discredited thoroughly by its suppression of the Parisians when it gained power after the Cabochian revolt.41\n\nFinally, in a concluding chapter, “Wife, Mother, Friend,” I emphasize the attractive traits that emerge from the contemporary sources on Isabeau: her devotion to her husband and his to her, her intense interest in her children, her piety, her interest in literature, and her aptitude for negotiation. I also challenge the perception that her household was perceived as corrupt by her contemporaries. Once again, the point is not to whitewash the queen but to examine the evidence through an optic more appropriate than those applied in the past. Although it is impossible to recapture the personality of a woman who lived six hundred years ago, certain characteristics emerge clearly enough from the sources to offer an occasional glimpse of the queen in her different roles.\n\nI would like to be precise about the goals of this study. It adds no previously undiscovered sources to the story of Isabeau. The documents related to her life have been studied and many of them edited.42 But although most of my material has been exploited in earlier studies, when refracted through the prism of Isabeau as a mediator queen, it yields a new story. Isabeau has often fared badly at the hands of historians who slot her story into old misogynistic paradigms and equally badly at the hands of literary specialists who insert her into feminist critical narratives without sufficient allowance for her historical situation. I try to correct the problems that arise from each of the approaches, while culling the advantages of both. That is to say, I reread the historical documents associated with Isabeau from the perspective that Gabrielle Spiegel has referred to as the “middle ground,” a critical position based upon both “a belief in the referential, constative possibilities of language,” the belief that documents do speak of actual events, and a “theoretically informed appreciation of the literary nature of all historical documents and their mediating and supplementary role in all historiography.”43 As will be clear now, the study is as much interested in the creation of the queen’s legend as in the reality behind the legend, as much interested in how inadequate critical frameworks have distorted our understanding of her strategies as in the strategies themselves, and as much interested in how to reread the primary sources related to medieval queens as in the information about Isabeau to be gleaned from those sources.\n\nMoreover, this study is not a traditional biography, and it makes no claim to be comprehensive; on the contrary, it seeks to draw attention to aspects of the queen’s life that could be developed in further studies. If the Isabeau who emerges from my rereading is regarded by readers as a figure ready for insertion into the canon of active queens, as a figure worthy of further attention, the study will have achieved its goal. For despite her notoriety, Isabeau has received very little scholarly attention among scholars writing in English. To Famiglietti, she represents only a minor interest in his broader study of the period, and he therefore leaves much to be said about her. Although the publication in monograph form of Gibbons’ dissertation—the only English book-length study of the queen—is eagerly awaited for its detailed analysis of the queen’s financial accounts, at the moment this research is difficult to access. Colleen M. Mooney’s 1977 doctoral dissertation on fifteenth-century queens offers important information on Isabeau’s household, but the study is marred by its uncritical acceptance of the queen’s black legend. Much work on the queen remains to be carried out. All the data for a prosopographical study of her household exists, for example. As a powerful woman in medieval French society, she offers a compelling case study. Given her position as one in a long line of female regents extending into the seventeenth century, her queenship offers a potential starting point for further study of regency. The lessons of Isabeau’s vilification and the process of her restoration are important—one might even say exemplary—for the study of medieval and early modern queenship. Isabeau, a “well-behaved woman,” should not have made history, to borrow the expression of Lauren Thatcher Ulrich. Indeed, her black legend is so disproportionate to the story that emerges from contemporary documents that her biography and afterlife must serve as warnings not to accept “common knowledge” about historical figures uncritically. Isabeau’s story reminds us of our obligation to approach queenship from a skeptical perspective, refusing to read accusations of fickleness, greed, and ambition at face value.\n\nA note about translations: Except where noted, the translations of poetry and prose are my own. As for names, it is impossible to be entirely consistent when translating medieval French names. Certain of the names that figure in this study are routinely left in French by English-speaking scholars (for example Isabeau rather than Elizabeth, Louis rather than Lewis). Others, like Joan of Arc, are generally translated into English. I follow convention for these names. Certain names, like Jean and Philippe, are translated sometimes. In these cases, I have chosen to leave Jean to avoid what seems to me the greater inconsistency of John the Fearless alongside of Jean de Montaigu and Jean Gerson, neither of which is ever translated into English. Philippe, however, I have converted to English. I translate “of” in names when the reference is to a territory (Louis of Orleans, Jean of Berry), but leave “de” in cases of what had become family names by the late fourteenth century, although they may have referred to geographic locations earlier (Christine de Pizan, Bureau de la Rivière)."
