        "text": "Basset History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nFrance\n\nIreland\n\nFollowing the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, the name Basset was first found in Britina. It was a name for a person of small stature having derived from the Old English word bas, meaning of low stature. 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Basset family\n\nThe surname Basset was first found in Staffordshire where the family traces back to Thurston, a Norman who held six hides of land in Drayton (known today as Dayton Bassett.) Thurston was the \"paternal ancestor of several families of Basset, which rose to power and distinction very shortly after the Conquest. Ralph Basset [(died 1265)], the illustrious founder of their greatness, is said to have been raised by Henry I, from a lowly condition, and to have been 'exalted above earls and other eminent men.' True it is he was constituted Justice of England, and invested with the power of sitting in whatever court he pleased.\" 2\n\n\"Thurstan Basset appears in the Roll of Battle Abbey.\" 3\n\nOne source claims that the family may have branched to Withcote in Leicestershire in ancient times. \"At the south-western extremity of the parish [of Withcote] may be traced the foundations and embankments of Solay or Sawley Castle, a place of great importance in the baronial wars, supposed to have been built by the Bassett family.\" 4\n\nThe aforementioned Ralph Basset was father of Ralph Basset, 1st Lord Basset of Drayton and Maud (c. 1265-1299.) He rose to become Governor of Edinburgh Castle (1291-1296.) His son Ralph Basset III was killed at the Battle of Evesham one year after his appointment. Wooton-Bassett, a market-town and parish, and formerly a representative borough, in the union of Cricklade and Wootton-Bassett, hundred of Kingsbridge in Wiltshire was an ancient family seat.\n\n\"This place, which appears to have been originally of greater importance than it is at present, was, at the time of the Norman Conquest, called Wodeton, from wode, a wood, and tun, a town. About a century after that period, it became the property of the noble family of Bassett, from whom it derived the adjunct to its name.\" 4\n\n\"At the upper end of the north aisle [of the church at Blore, Staffordshire], within a kind of chantry chapel, is a noble altar-tomb of statuary marble, supposed to be to the memory of William, the last male heir of the Bassetts, who was living in 1588; there is also a brass, dated 1400, in the aisle.\" 4\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Basset family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Basset research. Another 79 words (6 lines of text) covering the years 1050, 1093, 1198, 1330, 1597, 1602, 1625, 1626, 1628, 1640, 1641, 1644, 1656, 1669, 1673, 1674, 1679, 1681, 1687, 1688, 1693, 1695, 1720, 1721 and 1890 are included under the topic Early Basset History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nBasset Spelling Variations\n\nIt is only in the last few hundred years that the English language has been standardized. For that reason, Anglo-Norman surnames like Basset are characterized by many spelling variations. Scribes and monks in the Middle Ages spelled names they sounded, so it is common to find several variations that refer to a single person. As the English language changed and incorporated elements of other European languages such as Norman French and Latin, even literate people regularly changed the spelling of their names. The variations of the name Basset include Bassett, Basset, Bassit, Basett and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Basset family\n\nOutstanding amongst the family at this time was\n\nLord Basset of Drayton\n\nLord Basset of Weldon\n\nSir Robert Basset of Umberley, a colonel in the English Army\n\nArthur Basset (1597-1673), an English politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1625 to 1626\n\nWilliam Bassett (c. 1602-1656), an English landowner and politician, Member of Parliament for Bath (1640-1644), supported the Royalist cause in the English Civil War\n\nWilliam Basset (1644-1695), an English divine\n\nSir William Bassett (1628-1693), an English landowner and politician, Member of Parliament for Bath (1669-1679) and (1681-1693)\n\nJoshua Bassett or Basset (c. 1641-c.1720), an English academic, Master of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge (1687-1688)\n\nBasset Ranking\n\nIn France, the name Basset is the 709th most popular surname with an estimated 6,833 people with that name. 5\n\nMigration of the Basset family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Basset family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt.\n\nAnother 50 words (4 lines of text) about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nBasset migration to the United States +\n\nFaced with the chaos present in England at that time, many English families looked towards the open frontiers of the New World with its opportunities to escape oppression and starvation. People migrated to North America, as well as Australia and Ireland in droves, paying exorbitant rates for passages in cramped, unsafe ships. Many of the settlers did not make the long passage alive, but those who did see the shores of North America were welcomed with great opportunity. Many of the families that came from England went on to make essential contributions to the emerging nations of Canada and the United States. Some of the first immigrants to cross the Atlantic and come to North America carried the name Basset, or a variant listed above:\n\nBasset Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nWilliam Basset, from Middlesex, who arrived in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1621 aboard the ship \"Fortune\" 6\n\nMrs. Elizabeth Basset, from Middlesex who arrived in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1621 aboard the ship \"Fortune\" 7\n\nWilliam Basset in Virginia in 1622\n\nGeorge Basset in Virginia 1637\n\nFrancis Basset, who arrived in Boston, Massachusetts in 1682 6\n\n...

They made many attempts but failed in some to establish settlements on the Islands including Saint Lucia and Grenada. By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 12\n\nBasset Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nHenry Basset, who landed in Barbados in 1663 6\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Basset (post 1700) +\n\nFrancis Basset FRS (1757-1835), 1st Baron de Dunstanville and Basset, an English nobleman and politician\n\nJohn Basset (1791-1843), English writer on Cornish mining\n\nRen√© Basset (1919-2021), French photographer who received the Ni√©pce Prize in 1958\n\nAnne Charles Basset de Montaigu, French Divisional General during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars from 1789 to 1815 13\n\nFrancis Basset (1715-1769), Cornish landowner and politician\n\nSarah Basset (d. 1730), slave and alleged witch in the British colony Bermuda in the West Indies\n\nFrances Basset (1781-1855), 2nd Baroness Basset, British peeress\n\nDelfin Carbonell Basset (b. 1938), contemporary lexicographer\n\nBasset Maguire, American Botanist\n\nRelated Stories +\n\nThe Basset Motto +\n\nThe motto was originally a war cry or slogan. Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Pro rege et populo\n\nMotto Translation: For King and people.\n\nCitations +\n\nReaney, P.H and R.M.
