Grace Jones essentially retired from music after this album and became a film actress for three years. The album followed her definitive Nightclubbing and was a commercial disappointment, although it had some nice material and excellent production and arrangements. But she often sounded distant and detached, and not even the great support could totally overcome Jones’ less than enthusiastic performances.
