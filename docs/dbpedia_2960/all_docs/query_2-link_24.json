But, within the busy lives we often create for ourselves, it’s easy to fall victim to monotonous routines for the comfort and sense of control they provide.\n\nIdentifying your true purpose (or purposes) can help spark energy, passion, and excitement for the future that you may have never felt before or have only experienced in passing.\n\nIn this article, you’ll learn how to discover if you’re lacking purpose in life, get a step-by-step guide on how to find your purpose, and leave with practical tools to pinpoint and start journeying toward your life’s purpose.\n\nDemystifying the \"purpose\" quest\n\n“Finding your purpose” is a phrase often thrown out in different contexts, including life coaching sessions, career brainstorms, and mental health settings like therapy. This can muddy the waters for what it actually means to find your purpose and which areas of life you should consider.\n\nBefore you dive into finding your purpose, let’s break down the concept of having a purpose and why it’s important.\n\nWhat is a life purpose?\n\nA life purpose is an overall vision for your life based on the things that are most meaningful to you. It’s often a central goal or set of goals that include the following:\n\nGuide decision-making\n\nProvide direction\n\nCreate a sense of meaning\n\nInfluence behaviors\n\nDetermine how you prioritize your time\n\nYou can think of the purpose or objective of life as your “why” or the reason you get out of bed each morning. It’s the motivating factor behind many things you do that shape your goals and make you feel like you’re on this planet for a reason.\n\nWhy is finding purpose important?\n\nAside from providing a sense of direction, focus, and self-worth, finding your life’s purpose comes with a range of benefits, including:\n\nBetter physical health and well-being\n\nGreater success and happiness\n\nStronger personal relationships\n\nHigher income\n\nRecent research shows a strong sense of purpose leads to positive social well-being and lower levels of loneliness. A purposeful life can also reduce impulsive behaviors and lead to a longer life.\n\nLife purpose examples\n\nTo offer a better sense of what it means to find your life purpose, here are a few life purpose examples to inform and inspire your journey:\n\nRaising a family and setting the best example for your children\n\nSupporting a social issue, such as climate change or racial equality\n\nCreating a legacy that helps others who have faced similar challenges\n\nBecoming a researcher to contribute to better medical treatments\n\nTraveling the world to experience new cultures and perspectives\n\nIt’s important to remember that your purpose statement doesn’t have to be grandiose, like solving world hunger. Purpose comes in all forms, as everyone derives meaning from different sources.\n\nUnderstanding the journey\n\nAnswering the question “What is my life purpose?” may seem like it should be straightforward, but doing so is often anything but simple. Finding your purpose is a journey with ups and downs.\n\nAt times, you may feel on top of the world, proud of all you’re doing and the difference you’re making where it matters most. But in other seasons, you might languish and need to regain your sense of purpose.\n\nAll these emotions are normal, so give yourself some grace if you feel you are lacking right now. You can always get back on track.\n\nDo you lack purpose in life?\n\nSpeaking of lacking purpose — how do you know if you’re struggling to find your purpose? One tell-tale sign is experiencing purpose anxiety, which is a nervousness about being able to find your purpose.\n\nIt can be easy to put a lot of pressure on yourself to find the best-fitting purpose and dedicate your life to it. But you may have more than one purpose that changes throughout your life's chapters.\n\nIf you feel frustrated about your life purpose not feeling obvious, remember you have an entire lifetime to find your passions. Don’t let purpose anxiety keep you from putting in the work for self-improvement.\n\nHere are some other signs that you might be lacking a sense of purpose:\n\nYou have little energy\n\nYou don’t feel enthusiastic about the future\n\nYou don’t think you’re making a difference\n\nYou’re not able to recognize the things you are accomplishing\n\nYou don’t feel like doing activities you normally enjoy\n\nStep-by-step: How to answer \"what is my purpose?\"\n\nIf you feel discouraged about finding your purpose, there are some mental exercises and steps you can take to come closer to your true calling. Try thinking through these steps and writing down your initial thoughts as you go.\n\nIdentify your life values\n\nYou can’t answer the question “What is my purpose in life?” without answering, “What do I value?” Your core values are the beliefs that guide the way you live and what you prioritize.\n\nExamples of personal values include the following:\n\nHonesty\n\nIntegrity\n\nGratitude\n\nGenerosity\n\nFlexibility\n\nFamily values\n\nTo uncover your personal values, answer the following questions:\n\nWhat has been the most meaningful moment in your life? Why was it meaningful?\n\nWhen have you felt least satisfied?\n\nWhat accomplishments do you take the most pride in?\n\nWhat’s your ideal environment?\n\nWhat makes you angry?\n\nTake the time to self-reflect on specific moments and the emotions you felt to help you discover patterns in the things you care about.\n\nSet meaningful goals\n\nOnce you have a solid list of core values, brainstorm meaningful life goals that align with them.\n\nFor example, if you value generosity, set goals to volunteer time, money, or resources to a cause. If you value sustainability, for example, make it a goal to begin composting at home. Once you achieve that, you can set a goal to use the compost in an herb and vegetable garden and complete the cycle.\n\nAddress your fears\n\nIf some of your goals feel unattainable, what’s holding you back? What do you fear might happen?\n\nIt’s not uncommon for there to be logistical or emotional barriers to investing 100% into your goals and values. You might fear failure, rejection, or not being good enough at something to go after it.\n\nMake a list of any fears that come to mind, and be your own devil’s advocate. Are your fears logical? Are there any ways you can work around them? If you’re struggling to overcome your fears, ask a trusted friend for their input on breaking down these walls.\n\nExplore your passions\n\nYour passions and interests can indicate the area(s) in which your life purpose might lie, but they can be hard to identify. They can be so ingrained in your way of thinking that you become blind to them.\n\nIf you’re unsure what your passions are, ask the people who know you best. You may already be pursuing them without realizing it. Perhaps you’re an unofficial mentor to young people in your community. If so, being a coach or mentor could be your passion.\n\nAnother way to find your passion is to think about what you’re good at. If you’re great at helping others handle relationship issues or problems with their boss, consider a career as a personal coach. You could even create purpose in your work by pursuing coaching classes or certificates. Or, you might prefer to keep your passion as a hobby or turn it into a side hustle instead of a full-time source of income.\n\nStart small to build momentum\n\nDetermining your life’s purpose may feel daunting, and setting goals that are too big can quickly become overwhelming. It might deter you from taking any steps at all.\n\nIf you’re interested in changing careers to better align with your purpose, don’t immediately jump ship and apply for other roles. Start with a goal of researching the industry and position, asking questions like these:\n\nWhat are the day-to-day responsibilities?\n\nWhat do people like and dislike about this line of work?\n\nWhat qualifications or skills do you need to succeed?\n\nBegin with a discovery process that feels more attainable but is still driving you toward your mission.\n\nBuild your community\n\nPurpose often involves connecting with others who share similar interests, so being an active community member can contribute to a greater sense of purpose in life.\n\nWhen you find your purpose, you’ll discover that many others share your passions and values. Joining or creating a community allows you to find that sense of connection with others as you work together toward a common goal. It can also be a great way to hold yourself accountable.\n\nPractice gratitude and self-acceptance\n\nPracticing self-acceptance can help you be kinder to yourself when things go wrong. We all make mistakes. Instead of beating yourself up for your failures, try to see each setback as an opportunity to grow.\n\nPractice self-compassion to help you develop self-awareness. When you accept all of yourself, you’re more likely to give the best of yourself in every situation. This might be at work, with your family, or while doing the things you love.\n\nNever stop experimenting\n\nPersonal goals and values can change over time, and that’s OK. Your life’s purpose doesn’t need to remain stagnant. Stay curious about the world around you, and watch out for situations that may uncover emotions you weren’t expecting.\n\nThis concept of continued curiosity can be especially important when finding your purpose after college. This is a time to explore new career paths and try new things with a growth mindset. You never know what unexpected passions you may stumble upon.\n\nAdvanced tools for discovering your purpose\n\nSome of the above steps may feel vague to you. If that’s the case, explore using various tools for a more defined head start.\n\nPersonality assessments\n\nPersonality tests are great for helping you find your core values and identifying your true self. Many personality assessments also provide results that share the following:\n\nIntrinsic motivators\n\nInsight into your emotional makeup\n\nYour communication style\n\nPersonal preferences\n\nHere’s a list of free personality assessments you can take right now.\n\nPurpose coaching\n\nSometimes, you need an outside perspective and sounding board to find your purpose. Consider signing up for purpose coaching if you’re having trouble finding it alone.\n\nA purpose coach can help you visualize your ideal life, identify your passions, and create a roadmap to get you there. Answering a set of questions can help you match with a purpose coach who fits your needs.\n\nMindfulness and meditation\n\nFinding your purpose requires awareness, which you can elicit from cognitive exercises like mindfulness and meditation. Mindfulness can lead to a positive change in attitude, improve mental fitness, and create greater resiliency for stress and depression.\n\nAdditionally, meditation can make you more self-aware, keep you centered, and help you think more creatively.\n\nKickstart your search for meaning and purpose\n\n“What is my purpose?” is a big question that requires deep self-reflection to answer meaningfully. If you need brainstorming and goal-setting support, consider working with a 1:1 expert coach who helps people like you answer this question daily."
