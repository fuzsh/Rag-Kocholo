Other tracks were remixed or re-edited by the PolyGram/Universal engineers in 1998 for this particular compilation, instead of using the many existing long or extended versions by original producers Chris Blackwell and Alex Sadkin that were released on vinyl in 1980–1982. The track \"Living My Life\" appears as an edited remix by Paul \"Groucho\" Smykle—dating from 1986, which the liner notes fail to mention. Another anomaly on the album is that it concludes with \"Slave to the Rhythm\", a track which was recorded in 1985, in London and with British producer Trevor Horn. Also the mix used, here renamed \"Hot Blooded Version\", is again an alternate 1998 re-mix/re-edit of the original 12\" version entitled \"Blooded\".: \n\tSource: Wikipedia",
