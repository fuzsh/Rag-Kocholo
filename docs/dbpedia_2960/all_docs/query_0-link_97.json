The song has since come to be one of Jones’ signature tunes. The song was co-written by Jones herself, Sly Dunbar, Dana Mano, and Robbie Shakespeare.\n\nUpon its release, “Pull Up to the Bumper” spent seven weeks at number 2 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart, as well as becoming a Top-5 single on the U.S. R&B chart.\n\nIn 1985 the track was remixed and re-released to promote the Island Life compilation, the Extended Remix includes additional keyboard overdubs and remix by Paul “Groucho” Smykle. This 1985 remix peaked at #12 on the UK pop chart in early 1986.\n\nJones’ genre-hopping artistry earned her a diehard LGBTQ+ fan base from day one, largely because of her very uncommon divadom. By gleefully toying with masculine and feminine conventions, she offered her queer audience a constantly evolving performance in which they could recognize their own sexual fluidity. “Bumper” succinctly captures Jones’ protean mix of playfulness and aggression, simultaneously tongue-in-cheek and deadly serious. It’s a masterstroke of double entendre that, with its sinuous reggae-disco backdrop and Jones’ snarled vehicular puns, really only demands one thing from you: that you move.\n\nSIDE A:\n\nPull Up To The Bumper (Extended Remix) 6:25\n\nRemix – Paul “Groucho” Smykle\n\nProducer – Alex Sadkin, Chris Blackwell\n\nWritten-By – Dana Mano, Grace Jones, Koo Koo Baya\n\nSIDE B:\n\nLa Vie En Rose 7:20\n\nArranged By – Duke Williams\n\nProducer – Tom Moulton\n\nWritten-By – E.
