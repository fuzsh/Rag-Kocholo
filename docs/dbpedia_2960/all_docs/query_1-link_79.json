        "text": "So before I move onto the next track:\n\nSeven and the Ragged Tiger\n\nSeven and the Ragged Tiger is the third studio album by English new wave band Duran Duran. It was released on 21 November 1983 by EMI. It was the band's first and only number-one album on the UK Albums Chart, and would prove to be the last studio album for the band's most famous line-up until 2004's Astronaut.\n\nVocalist Simon Le Bon said the album \"is an adventure story about a little commando team. 'The Seven' is for us—the five band members and the two managers—and 'the Ragged Tiger' is success. Seven people running after success. It's ambition. That's what it's about.\"\n\nEMI re-released the album in 2010 in two configurations: a two-disc digipak and a three-disc box set (consisting of two CDs and one DVD). The latter includes on the DVD the first official release of the \"As the Lights Go Down\" video.\n\nIn 1983, Duran Duran intended to spend a year away from the United Kingdom as tax exiles, as their income had increased dramatically after the success of Rio and the reissue of their 1981 debut album Duran Duran the previous year. Thus during May 1983 the band began writing and making demo recordings at a châlet near Cannes in the south of France with producer Ian Little. The band was having some trouble writing material there but still came up with ideas for most of the songs that appeared on the album. Several were completed, including a track called \"Seven and the Ragged Tiger\", for which the album was named. This song was never officially released, but parts of it would eventually evolve into the track \"The Seventh Stranger\". A demo version of the original track has since leaked onto the internet, albeit in very rough, warped form. No quality recording of the song is said to exist.\n\nWith the songs written during their stay in France, the band started recording at George Martin's Air Studios on the Caribbean island of Montserrat in May. The sessions, which saw producer Ian Little joined by the vastly more experienced Alex Sadkin, would keep Duran Duran in Montserrat for five weeks. During one of these sessions, keyboardist Nick Rhodes collapsed and had to be airlifted to a hospital; newspapers later reported it was due to an episode of paroxysmal tachycardia (abnormally fast heartbeat).\n\nPrior commitments brought the band back to the UK in July 1983, including a charity gig playing in front of Prince Charles and Princess Diana at the Villa Park. It was later revealed that the Irish Republican Army had plotted to plant a bomb at the concert in order to injure Charles and Diana, but the IRA member sent to carry out the plot, Sean O'Callaghan, was in fact an informant working for the Irish Government and successfully helped to pull the plug on the operation.\n\nIt was around this time that the Princess of Wales publicly named Duran Duran as her favourite band. During their time in the UK, the band worked on a few more songs in a studio in London, before returning to Montserrat for one final late summer session.\n\nAfter the island's isolation, the band moved the project to Sydney, Australia at the end of August. Producers Ian Little and Alex Sadkin continued working with the band on the album, now titled Seven and the Ragged Tiger, at 301 Studios. An argument during this period between John Taylor and Alex Sadkin over the prolonged mixing is said to have been the germination of the Power Station side project that happened in 1985, as Taylor contemplated leaving Duran Duran for the first time.\n\nThe album's cover photo was shot on the steps of the State Library of New South Wales\n\nThe band remained in Australia, with their Sing Blue Silver world concert tour due to commence in November 1983 at the National Indoor Sports Centre in Canberra. Beforehand, the band departed for the sands outside of Sydney to film the video for the first single \"Union of the Snake\" with director Simon Milne. Twenty-four hours before the band were due to deliver the single to EMI, Nick Rhodes and Simon Le Bon did an all-night session to complete the writing, recording and mixing the B-side \"Secret Oktober\". In October, the band's record company released the \"Union of the Snake\" video to MTV a full week before the single was released to radio, at a time when the industry feared video really might kill the radio star.\n\nThe simultaneous worldwide release of the album followed a few weeks later on 21 November. The album entered the UK chart at number one (to date, their only number one album there) and achieved platinum status only a week after its release. It also reached #8 in the US and was certified platinum by January 1984, and eventually double platinum.\n\nThe next single \"New Moon on Monday\" was released in January 1984, accompanied by another ambitious video. In February, the band appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine, and won two Grammy Awards in the new Long Form and Short Form music video categories.\n\nA Nile Rodgers remix of \"The Reflex\", released in April, became the band's second number one single in the UK (for four weeks) and first number one in the US (two weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100).\n\nThe world tour for the album played large indoor arenas and continued through the first four months of 1984. A documentary about the tour, Sing Blue Silver, was made by Russell Mulcahy, as was the promo video for \"The Reflex\", and the concert videos Arena (An Absurd Notion) and As The Lights Go Down. The live album Arena was also recorded during this tour. The live concert video was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award for Best Stage Performance (but lost to Van Halen's \"Jump\").\n\nIn the documentary film Extraordinary World, filmed a decade later, Rhodes described the sound of the album as \"barely controlled hysteria, scratching beneath the surface\".\n\nAll songs written and composed by Duran Duran.\n\nSide one\n\n\"The Reflex\" – 5:29\n\n\"New Moon on Monday\" – 4:16\n\n\"(I'm Looking For) Cracks in the Pavement\" – 3:38\n\n\"I Take the Dice\" – 3:18\n\n\"Of Crime and Passion\" – 3:50\n\nSide two\n\n\"Union of the Snake\" – 4:20\n\n\"Shadows on Your Side\" – 4:03\n\n\"Tiger Tiger\" – 3:20\n\n\"The Seventh Stranger\" – 5:24\n\n2010 re-issue\n\nDisc 2\n\n\"Is There Something I Should Know?\"\n\n\"Faith in This Colour\"\n\n\"Faith in This Colour\" [Alternate slow mix]\n\n\"Secret Oktober\"\n\n\"Tiger Tiger\" [Ian Little mix]\n\n\"The Reflex\" [Single mix]\n\n\"Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)\" [Live]\n\n\"New Religion\" [Live]\n\n\"The Reflex\" [Live]\n\n\"Is There Something I Should Know?\" [Monster mix]\n\n\"Union of the Snake\" [Monkey mix]\n\n\"New Moon on Monday\" [Dance mix]\n\n\"The Reflex\" [Dance mix]\n\nDVD (As the Lights Go Down)\n\nIntro: \"Tiger Tiger\"\n\n\"Is There Something I Should Know?\"\n\n\"Hungry Like the Wolf\"\n\n\"Union of the Snake\"\n\n\"New Religion\"\n\n\"Save a Prayer\"\n\n\"Rio\"\n\n\"The Seventh Stranger\"\n\n\"The Chauffeur\"\n\n\"Planet Earth\"\n\n\"Careless Memories\"\n\n\"Girls On Film\"\n\n028 The Reflex\n\n\"The Reflex\" is the eleventh single by Duran Duran, released worldwide on 16 April 1984.\n\nThe remixes for both the 7\" and 12\" singles were done by Nile Rodgers, of Chic fame. It was his first work with the band, and he would later go on to produce \"The Wild Boys\" single as well as the album Notorious (1986) and several tracks on Astronaut (2004).\n\nThe video for \"The Reflex\" was shot during The Sing Blue Silver Tour at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, Ontario on 5 March 1984. Director Russell Mulcahy filmed some of the closeup footage in the indoor arena that afternoon, and the rest was filmed live during that evening's concert.\n\n\"The Reflex\" is primarily a concert video, accurately portraying Duran Duran's Sing Blue Silver tour performance style (perhaps with a little more hair spray and a little less sweat than usual). However, in keeping with the band's insistence that their videos \"never be ordinary\", the video screen above the stage displayed bits of naked models wearing collars and chains illuminated with black light, occasionally interrupted by computerized video white noise. At one point, a waterfall appears to pour out of the video screen above the stage to soak the audience. The computer graphics used to achieve this were cutting edge at the time, but rapid advancement in the field quickly made the effect look dated.\n\nMulcahy found it challenging to edit the video to match the jumpy fast-and-slow edits in the Nile Rodgers remix of the single. For the instrumental break in the middle of the song, he had to do some video \"scratching\" with Simon Le Bon's silhouette.\n\nKeyboard enthusiasts have taken special note of the Fairlight CMI (the first digital sampling synthesiser) that Nick Rhodes operated with a light pen in this video, and throughout the tour.\n\nIn its heavily remixed form, \"The Reflex\" was the band's second single to reach number one the UK singles chart, after \"Is There Something I Should Know?\" in 1983, and it would be their last #1 song there. It was preceded at number one by \"Hello\" by Lionel Richie and followed by \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\" by Wham!\n\nThe song was also the band's first single to hit number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 (for two weeks) on 23 June 1984. It was preceded at number one by \"Time after Time\" by Cyndi Lauper, and followed by \"When Doves Cry\" by Prince. It also topped the charts in Ireland; the Netherlands; Belgium; & Europe's aggregated weekly chart, as well as Australia #4 & Canada #3.\n\nPart 2 of 2\n\nThis was a good album, but it was a slight drop in quality from the first two."
