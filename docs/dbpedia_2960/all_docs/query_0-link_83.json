        "text": "A nondescript building near the waterfront, on the Northwestern outskirts of Nassau. Nothing hints at the fact it once hosted a world-class recording studio.\n\nThe property looks “unkept and run down”, a disappointed Google reviewer points out. “The building is still standing, but it has been let go.”\n\nAC/DC’s Back in Black was recorded here, one of the biggest-selling albums of all time and the reason for that Google reviewer to hop on bus number 10 from Downtown Nassau.\n\nCompass Point was set up in 1977 by Chris Blackwell, founder of Island Records, the label that turned Bob Marley into a global superstar.\n\nphoto: Christine Puccio (under CC license)\n\nIsland, still operating independently at that point, owned two studios in London. But Blackwell had a vision for a creative space in the Caribbean that exuded calm and serenity.\n\nBorn in London and raised in Kingston, he knew that the Jamaican capital was too loud, too dirty, and too dangerous for such a place.\n\nThe Bahamas, on the other hand, had turned into an offshore hotspot and a coveted destination for wealthy tourists. A 50-minute flight connected Nassau to Miami, multiple times per day.\n\nBlackwell decided to build a mix of a high-end recording studio and a tropical holiday resort on the main island New Providence, with the palm-lined beachfront just a stones throw away.\n\nThe studio featured the best analog equipment, including an MCI 24-track mixing desk, luxurious facilities and 24/7 staffing.\n\nInspired by the playbook of iconic labels Motown and Stax, Blackwell started building a serious house band: The Compass Point All Stars (CPAS). He wanted a group rooted in Jamaican tradition but with open ears and minds.\n\nThe foundation of CPAS were drummer Sly Dunbar and bassist Robbie Shakespeare, also known as the prolific reggae rhythm section Sly & Robbie.\n\nInto the mix came French-Beninese keyboard specialist Wally Badarou, a magician on the Prophet-5 synthesizer, who had played on Robin Scott’s 1979 new wave hit “Pop Muzik”.\n\nBlackwell wanted them to record with Grace Jones, a Jamaican model and disco singer who had risen to fame in New York’s Studio 54 era.\n\nThe edgy, progressive sound of the studio would be defined on Jones’ legendary “Compass Point Trilogy”: Warm Leatherette (1980), Nightclubbing (1981), and Living My Life (1982).\n\nIn a 2006 lecture at Red Bull Music Academy, Badarou recalled the session that would spawn the first two of those classic albums.\n\n“It was not going to be a regular reggae session. It was not going to be a regular disco session either. […] Actually, there was a sense of uneasiness at first. Then the whole thing started to gel from ‘Private Life.’ Then we realized that there was a groove and there was some sophisticated synthetic electronic palettes upon the groove. That’s what made it so different.”\n\nAside from Dunbar, Shakespeare and Badarou, the early Compass Point All Stars consisted of percussionist Uziah “Sticky” Thompson and two guitarists, Barry Reynolds and Mikey Chung.\n\nHouse producer and engineer Alex Sadkin was crucial to their sound as well – his meticulous recording techniques included spending hours to set up Dunbar’s drumkit.\n\n“In those days we were not working with software. It was all analog […]. It’s a matter of ears, it’s a matter of balance, it’s a matter of how you feel about what you have. It’s about the very fabric of the sound itself […]. Alex Sadkin changed my life, in a way, because he helped me understand that you didn’t need to just crowd things up. If you have it, it’s there, and it’s large, it’s wide, and it helps having all the dynamic coming through.”\n\nDespite the initial “uneasiness”, Compass Point All Stars slowly morphed into an actual community.\n\nBlackwell had bought the adjacent lot and built apartments on a hill behind the studio, where the session musicians lived in a condominium.\n\nThe early to mid-1980s were the heydays of Compass Point.\n\nRobert Palmer became a Nassau resident. AC/DC recorded Back in Black. Roxy Music, The B-52s and David Bowie came over to work. Joe Cocker and Mick Jagger played with the All Stars. James Brown did as well, though the project never saw a release.\n\nThe Talking Heads recorded three albums at Compass Point between 1978 and 1983 – including the seminal Remain in Light with producer Brian Eno.\n\nThe band’s rhythm section couple, Tina Weymouth and Chis Frantz, even bought an apartment on the property. Their playful new wave side project Tom Tom Club was born in Nassau as well.\n\nWhat made the studio so special, aside from the melting pot of musical influences, was the relaxed atmosphere.\n\nAccording to Wally Badarou, the mentality was decidedly Jamaican – “soon come”. The session musicians went barefoot, and were rarely on time. Weed smoke filled the studio rooms.\n\nBadarou recalled Sly & Robbie’s particular way of working:\n\n“If it was not cooking, it was not cooking, and there was no point trying to even go any further. If, on the second try, if it was not cooking, forget it. I was like, ‘That’s it. Look, we can still do it. We can do it, please.’ ‘No, no. It’s not happening. Forget it.’ And they were right. […] That’s what music is all about. It’s got to be just there, […] it just needs to flow.”\n\nAt that time, many artists would feel inspired by music from the Caribbean and West Africa. In Nassau, they’d start actually experimenting with offbeats and polyrhythms.\n\nSome got carried away by the Compass Point vibe – like French post-punk singer Lizzy Mercier Descloux. Her second album Mambo Nassau sounds completely different to her previous material, but it’s a joy to listen to. It’s the sound of an artist breaking free from pre-conceived ideas and expectations, including their own.\n\nUntil the mid-1980s, Compass Point ran on full steam. At one point, Blackwell had to build a second studio room – Studio B – to satisfy demand.\n\nBut in 1987, house engineer Alex Sadkin died in a motorcycle crash.\n\nThe same year, Chris Blackwell got himself into financial trouble, as his expansion plans into the film industry didn’t pan out, and Island Records were sued by U2 for millions of unpaid royalty dollars.\n\nIn 1989, Blackwell sold Island to the PolyGram corporation.\n\nIt wasn’t just that he couldn’t take care of the facilities at that time. The vibe in the Bahamas changed as well. Once a safe destination, New Providence turned into a hub of the international cocaine trade. Crime rates raised, tourists and artists stopped coming.\n\nThe studio went through a period of decline, but Blackwell managed to save Compass Point – by getting Terry and Sherrie Manning onboard.\n\nTerry, an experienced producer and engineer, had previously worked at studios in the US and UK, including Abbey Road. The Mannings arrived in 1992, immediately started renovations and managed to lead Compass Point into a second blooming period.\n\nArtists like Björk, Lenny Kravitz, Mariah Carey, Sade, Celine Dion and Shakira recorded there during their 18-year tenure.\n\nIn September 2010, Compass Point closed down after 33 years of being in business – as the studio website said, it was due to “a series of incidents, socio-political based happenings which made it untenable to continue business in The Bahamas.”\n\nWhich brings us back to the disappointed Google reviewer, whose boyfriend was such an AC/DC fan that he wanted to visit the legendary studios where their biggest-selling album was recorded in 1980.\n\nAll they found was a faded, abandoned building complex.\n\nStill, “the views from the front are gorgeous.”\n\nMedia Diet\n\nNo reading and watching recommendations this week, but instead a longer roundup of new music – albums and songs – I’m currently enjoying.\n\nRaphael Rogiński – Žaltys (LP, 2024)\n\nWell-versed in jazz and classical music, the Polish guitarist also draws from Eastern European folk music traditions and American primitive-style fingerpicking, developing a unique style. For his new album, Rogiński got inspired by ancient Lithuanian mythology and music, inviting Indrė Jurgelevičiūtė of the folk band Merope, who sings and plays piano and kanklės – a plucked zither from the Baltic region. Layers of overdubs and effects conjure a magical dreamworld of string-based sounds, resulting in a mesmerizing collection of impressionist ambient folk vignettes.\n\nPoppy H – Good Hiding (LP, 2024)\n\nSince their outstanding second album Grave Era came out in February (when I’ve interviewed them), ultra-prolific UK producer Poppy H has released several more projects and a best-of compilation spanning their nine-months recording ‘career’. Their newest album Good Hiding feels like a true follow-up to Grave Era, similarly dark and somber, though there’s slightly more hope palpable. Musically, it goes from industrial soundscapes to raw electronic tracks to electroacoustic jams based on field recordings and analog instruments. The diversity of the material is truly astonishing, but somehow it’s always carrying the producer’s signature style.\n\nJonnine – Southside Girl (LP, 2024)\n\nOn her fourth solo album, Jonnine (of Australian experimental duo HTRK) delivers wistful vocals over sparse guitars, piano and percussion, captured on a portable 6-track recorder. Recalling a childhood summer spent by the sea, the music sounds distant, while field ambience takes center stage. The songs come across raw and unfinished, but that’s exactly what makes them deeply beautiful; capturing the magic of the fleeting moment. Listening to Southside Girl, I feel the same mundane melancholy I feel watching Éric Rohmer’s films. File under: Summertime sadness.\n\nPassepartout Duo and Inoyama Land – Radio Yugawara (LP, 2024)\n\nThis album is the collaborative work of two long-running duos, one from Italy and one from Japan, exploring the Japanese style of ambient music dubbed Kankyō Ongaku (often translated as ‘environmental music’). Recorded in a kindergarten in a small town called Yugawara, the four musicians mix the sounds of electronic keyboards and acoustic children’s instruments. Playful, bright, serene and summery, but steadily emitting a soft kind of energy – an absolute delight to listen to.\n\nPoeji – “Cathedral” (Song, 2024)\n\nMongolian jazz singer Enji Erkhem and German experimental drummer/percussionist Simon Popp joined forces for a strong debut LP under the Poeji moniker. Enji’s wordless vocalizations and Popp’s wooden and metal percussion are drenched in reverb and delay, conjuring an uncanny atmosphere. My favourite tune is “Cathedral”, which feels like secretly witnessing a forbidden ritual. Somewhere between dark ambient, industrial and dub – but nothing less than stunning.\n\nMartyna Basta – “Flame After Flame” (Song, 2024)\n\nKrakow-based sound artist Martyna Basta’s past work mostly classified as ‘ambient/experimental’. On this new stand-alone track, the trained classical guitarist moves away from abstract textures into actual song territory. The press blurb aptly references Caroline Polachek, Eartheater and HTRK, but the melancholic tune’s ethereal, dreamy vibe also reminds me of Cocteau Twins and Mazzy Star. One of my favourite songs of the year so far.\n\nHakushi Hasegawa – “Somoku/The First Take” (Performance, 2024)"
