        "text": "The film was inspired by a 1983 cover story in Rolling Stone magazine, written by Aaron Latham, titled \"Looking for Mr. Goodbody,” which declared health clubs as the “New Singles’ Bars.\"\n\nThe 19 Dec 1983 DV announced actor John Travolta would be re-teaming in Perfect with writer-producer-director James Bridges and screenwriter Aaron Latham, both of whom he worked with on the 1980 film Urban Cowboy (see entry). The 24 Feb 1984 HR reported that actor Jamie Lee Curtis had also been hired to star, and partial funding for the Columbia Pictures production would come from their partnership with Delphi Films.\n\nAn open casting call for physically fit background actors was held at The Sports Connection in Santa Monica, CA, on 3 and 4 May 1984, according to the 9 May 1984 LAHExam.\n\nReal-life Rolling Stone magazine editor, Jann Wenner, was cast as editor \"Mark Roth,\" after making a screen test with John Travolta, as reported by the 8 Jun 1984 HR.\n\nThe HR production chart of 5 Jun 1984 referred to an alternate title, Perfect! and announced shooting began on 4 Jun 1984. However, production notes in AMPAS library files report filming began on 23 May 1984 in Mammoth Mountain, CA, for two days, to shoot the film’s skiing scene. Filming resumed in NY, in late Jun 1984 for two weeks of location shooting. Production moved to Los Angeles, CA, for the remainder of the shoot, spending several weeks at The Sports Connection health club, which was the original site of inspiration for Aaron Latham’s articles. Other locations include Laird International Studios in Culver City, CA, where producers spent $500,000 to recreate the two-story Rolling Stone offices, headquartered in New York City, according to production notes.\n\nThe 3 Oct 1984 DV confirmed that filming began on 23 May 1984 and four weeks of shooting remained. According to the 25 Oct 1984 LAHExam, a number of illnesses delayed production. Principal photography was reportedly in its final weeks.\n\nCritical reception was overwhelmingly negative. The Aug 1985Box announced earnings of $4.2 million after the first three days in 1,344 theaters and $2.5 million from second weekend totals. The 21 Jul 1985 LAT reported box office totals for the $20 million picture were only $13.8 million after five weeks of release.\n\nEnd credits include the following acknowledgments: “Thanks to Rolling Stone®,” and “We wish to thank the following for their cooperation: Carly Simon, Lauren Hutton, Mick Jagger, Christie Brinkley, Susie Coelho, Kathryn Bigelow, Mary MacDonald, Dagny Corcoran, Nanette Pattee-Francini, Mitchell Lichtenstein, Mike Talla, Joanne Held, Reynaldo Villalobos, Michael Peyser, Jonathan Filley, Lori Openden, Chippendales, Michael Ives, American Airlines, TWA, EZTV, Oberlin Color Press, a division of World Color Press, and special thanks to The Sports Connection® - its staff and members for being such good sports.” End credits also acknowledge: \"Filmed at Laird International Studios.\"\n\nLess\n\nRolling Stone magazine investigative reporter, Adam Lawrence, travels to Los Angeles, California, to pursue an interview with a business man named Joe McKenzie, who was arrested for drug crimes.

Jessie refuses Adam’s request to be the subject of his piece on The Sports Connection, but agrees to have lunch with him. She asks him point blank if he is writing an exposé on the singles scene at the club, which he denies. After Joe McKenzie is released on bail, he grants Adam an exclusive interview, and Adam goes to New York City to meet him. The story he writes on McKenzie is contested by Rolling Stone for fear it will incite government opposition. The publishers demand Adam turn over his tape-recorded interview, and when he refuses after promising secrecy to McKenzie, the magazine refuses to print the story. Adam returns to Los Angeles and begins a relationship with Jessie. He attends her aerobics class, and she agrees to be interviewed. Jessie shares that she was interviewed by a reporter when she was an Olympic swimming hopeful, but the journalist wrote a scathing exposé about her affair with her coach. Jessie and Adam take a ski trip together, and their relationship deepens. Behind Jessie’s back, Adam pursues his story on the health club singles scene. Jessie is furious and ends their relationship when she catches Adam tape-recording a personal story she shares. His editor, Mark Roth, informs Adam that McKenzie offered the magazine a large sum of money not to run the story on him. Sometime later, Adam interviews Linda Slater, a promiscuous health club member. She and her friend Sally Marcus are excited to be the focus of his story, unaware of its negative slant. Rolling Stone photographer, Frankie, is sent to take pictures at The Sports Connection to accompany the article. Adam stops her from photographing Jessie, and demands she turn over the pictures she has already taken. Jessie visits Adam, and he gives her his tape recordings, and promises not to write about her. They resume their relationship, but Jessie finds The Sports Connection story on his computer, and learns that he is making the club and its members look bad. She deletes the only copy and accuses him of being callous. Later, Adam rewrites the article with a positive slant about the health resurgence in America. His editor, Mark, is angered that the story is not what Adam promised, and assigns another journalist to rewrite the story without Adam’s knowledge. Frankie shares the photographs she took of Jessie, and the journalists recognize her as the former swimmer. They print her picture with the old story of her long-ago affair, and credit the cover story to Adam. When he learns about the article, Adam races to apologize to Jessie, but she refuses to believe he did not write it. Adam returns to New York and attacks his editor’s office with a baseball bat. Later, Adam is subpoenaed by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) to testify against Joe McKenzie, and turn over his tape-recorded interview. Jessie travels to New York to attend the hearing. When Adam takes the stand, he refuses to hand over the tapes, and is held in contempt and sent to jail. As he is taken into custody, Jessie chases after him, shouting his name. Soon after, Joe McKenzie is found not guilty, and Adam is released from jail. Jessie waits outside the prison, and kisses Adam upon his release.\n\nLess"
