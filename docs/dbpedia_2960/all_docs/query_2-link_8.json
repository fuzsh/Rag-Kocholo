        "text": "Alexa Crowe’s life of solving Murder will continue in June.\n\nThe Lucy Lawless-led crime drama My Life Is Murder will launch Season 4 with a two-episode premiere Monday, June 17, on Acorn TV. The XL premiere will also air that night on BBC America, at 9/8c.\n\nTwo new episodes will premiere weekly each Monday, on Acorn TV and BBC America.\n\n“It’s been great getting the gang back together again for this new season of My Life is Murder,” says Lawless. “These episodes have a bit of everything — from homicidal hairdressers to wicked widows, brutal ballet to deadly soufflés, and we are having an absolute ball filming this series once again. I can’t wait for our fans around the world to see the magic that our fabulous cast and crew have been working hard to produce.”\n\nMy Life Is Murder‘s eight-episode Season 4 brings “Eight new mysteries. Eight new worlds. Eight diabolical killers that only Alexa Crowe (played by Lawless) can catch. But this time, Alexa is bringing her friends and family along for the ride: Tech guru Madison (Ebony Vagulans) is stepping up, contributing her considerable technical skills to Alexa’s investigations and the two of them have fallen into a comfortable mentor-mentee relationship. Though neither of them will ever agree on who is the mentor and who is the student.\n\n“Cafe owner Reuben (Joe Naufahu) is stepping in,” the official synopsis continues. “Brother Will (Martin Henderson) is staying close. Detective Harry (Rawiri Jobe) has her back and cranky cat, Chowder, can’t help complicating everything.”\n\nEmboldened by the changes in her life, ready to revisit demons of the past and excited to embrace her future, Alexa in Season 4 “is even more of a force, determined to reveal the most carefully hidden secrets that crack the most bewildering cases. And, somehow, she and her fabulous whanau (chosen family) still have a bunch of fun along the way. Let the Auckland adventures begin again…”\n\nXena alum Lawless also serves as an executive producer on My Life Is Murder, alongside Rachel Antony, Claire Tonkin, Harriet Crampton, Nicky Davies Williams, Pilar Perez and Don Klees."
