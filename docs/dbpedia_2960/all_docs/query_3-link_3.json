        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Producers Denise Di Novi and Margaret French Isaac of Di Novi Pictures have partnered with author Amanda Kloots to turn her memoir Live Your Live into a feature film.\n\nAmanda Kloots and her sister Anna Kloots penned the book and are adapting the screenplay themselves. No financier has been set yet.\n\nIn Live Your Life, Kloots reflects on love, loss, and life with her husband, Broadway star and Tony-nominee Nick Cordero, whose public battle with Covid and tragic death made headlines around the world. In the early spring of 2020, Cordero was hospitalized for what he and his wife believed was a severe case of pneumonia. Entering Cedars-Sinai, there was no indication that Cordero would never return home. Diagnosed with Covid, Cordero – who only a few days earlier was the picture of health – soon deteriorated. Suffering a series of complications – minor heart attacks, an amputation, sepsis – he was kept alive for weeks, hooked to a ventilator, bypass machines, dialysis, and a specialized heart-lung bypass machine.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nKloots shared their journey on social media. Her updates quickly made an impact, inspiring millions of followers around the globe to share positive thoughts and prayers and dance each day to Nick’s song “Live Your Life.” Cordero passed away after 94 grueling days in the ICU.\n\n“Live Your Life is a powerful love story set against a devastating period in our lives. It’s about love, faith, community, and resiliency and we feel honored that Amanda and Anna wanted to collaborate with us to tell Amanda’s deeply personal story.” said Di Novi and French Isaac.\n\n“Anna and I are very grateful to Denise and Margaret for giving us this opportunity to share this story in a new way. With their guidance we are enjoying the process of working together again to shape my memoir into a film,” said Amanda Kloots.\n\nKloots is currently a co-host of CBS’ Daytime Emmy Award-winning The Talk. At the end of 2021, she was a finalist on Season 30 of the ABC hit series Dancing with the Stars and will be touring the US with the live company in March. She is currently developing a Christmas movie at CBS as well as a children’s book with Harper Collins, all while managing her AK! Fitness brand that includes an app, products and several major brand partnerships. In 2020 she co-founded and runs the Hooray For apparel brand with her sister Anna.\n\nAnna Kloots is a writer living in Paris, France. Her memoir, My Own Magic with Harper Horizon, is set to be released in February 2023. In addition to founding and running the apparel brand Hooray For with her sister Amanda, she works freelance for travel, fashion, and lifestyle brands, and has a print shop where she sells photographs from her travels to 83 countries around the world. Anna shares daily anecdotes and insights on life as an American in Paris on her Instagram and short essays on her blog.\n\nAmanda Kloots is represented by WME, Mortar Media and Del Shaw Moonves Tanaka Finkelstein Lezcano Bobb and Dang.\n\nDi Novi Pictures movies have grossed over a billion dollars around the globe.
