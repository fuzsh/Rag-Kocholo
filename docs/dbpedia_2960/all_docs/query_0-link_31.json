        "text": "Benji B\n\nNow, as I was just discussing with my colleague, Jeff, there's enough to talk about to make this lecture last about a week. We're going to do our best to try and navigate it in the next 90 minutes or so. I think really the most natural point to start off in this huge area that we have to talk about is really to ask you, Wally, what it is that made you first do what you do?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nHello everybody, hope youâre all doing alright. Jetlag has passed away? I suppose itâs a seek for visuals, a seek for honesty and many things. When I was young, when I was about 14, anyone who knew me would swear that I was to become a pilot because I was into aviation so much. Anything that resembled a cockpit was heaven for me and the first time I entered a recording studio I saw a cockpit. I saw a place that was nothing, that was just cold equipment, cold gear, and you just had to bring your knowledge, your experience of life, what it is that you wanted to do and where you wanted to go to make it fly. That's what a recording studio is to me ever since. Nowadays it's a laptop, but that hasn't changed. It's the same thing. That's what made me do what I do.\n\nBenji B\n\nHow would you best describe what it is that you do?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nIf you look at my website you would see the first thing I put was a painter. I think Iâm a painter. Actually, I thought I was but I didnât dare say it up until Manu Dibango told me, âWally, youâre a painter,â and I said, âOh, yes. Thank you. Thatâs exactly what I want to be.â Iâm a painter, but I think weâre very privileged in making music that we design to think that we want to paint and painters normally, actually, take their models from outside of their minds to actually paint something. Unless weâre talking about abstract painting. Even abstract painting derives more or less from the regular thing that you canât actually see. Iâm a painter. Iâm a soul painter. I paint with music. I paint with notes. I paint with sounds. I paint with melodies. Melodies come first to me. I know it sounds a bit strange for somebody that loves James Brown, but I can tell that James Brown is a melody man before being a rhythm, a groove maker.\n\nBenji B\n\nHow can you tell that?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nWell, listen back to what he did in the â50s, â60s, and youâll find out that he was an incredible melody singer to start with.\n\nBenji B\n\nIn melody versus groove, melody wins for you?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nYes. Thatâs a very hard issue to me, even today. I believe that the value of a melody is difficult to appreciate. It is more than just putting notes together. It is actually creating textures. With just a melody, with just knowing exactly what an instrument can do you can create things that the best synthesizer in the world wonât do. Iâm a synthesizer specialist, by the way. Sorry to say. The more I learn, and the more I get Iâm growing to mastering my machines the more I realized that people like Ravel and Debussy were capable of doing the exact same thing, even better than what we do with synthesizers, just by using the right timbre from an oboe and a cello and a flute and a violin. They do that just by telling each of them what exactly to play. What note to play. I believe that, also, if you listen to, I donât know how many of us here know about Joseph Savino, weather report, he would pick up any synthesizer even the cheapest one, plastic sounding chord machine, and make it sound incredible. Simply because heâd be playing the right notes. That to me is key.\n\nBenji B\n\nThough you paint with a range of different mediums, as a producer and as a musician your paintbrush of choice is the keys...\n\nWally Badarou\n\nItâs the keys, yes. Itâs the synthesizer. I see in the synthesizer the extension of the recording studio medium, which is that youâd have something that is totally bland that has nothing. I mean, when I started with the synthesizer. Nowadays the synthesizers are loaded with thousands of sounds and you can download them by the millions, but when I started out a synthesizer was just a blank piece of machine with just patch chords and we had to devise the sound from the ground up. And that was what a recording studio was also. Tape machine was just sitting there and you had to put something into it that would make the whole of the world dance to what you did. That for me, itâs unbelievable. It still is an unbelievable experience. I will tell you about what Iâm doing nowadays, if you ask me, âWhat do you do today, Wally?â I know that weâll come back to that later. Iâm a stage actor. Yes. I went into theater five years ago and I embraced that thing like, wow, and I thought it was that different from music. Itâs the exact same thing. But we are very privileged that the thing that we are expressing come from our inner soul. Where a stage actor will impersonate somebody that is a character out of a book, out of a novel. Why was I going onto that? I canât remember anymore.\n\nBenji B\n\nWhat youâre doing right now.\n\nWally Badarou\n\nYes, because I just wanted to talk about what actually is the beginning of things. What I love about music is that you can actually go anywhere in the world. Do I have a favorite place in the world? No. I can be happy anywhere as long as I have a place where I can start something that is within myself and I will propel, that I will project to the world. That will go beyond the four walls of wherever I am. Thatâs basically it. Yeah.\n\nBenji B\n\nEven though you consider yourself a citizen of the world now, and have traveled everywhere, where did it start for you? Where were you born?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nIâm African from Benin. Yoruba. From a Muslim father. A Catholic mother. I speak French. I speak English. I spent ten years in Africa, about ten to 15 years in the Bahamas speaking English. I spent a lot of time in London eating Indian food and the rest of it in France and in America. So, I belong to the world. Actually it sounds corny, but itâs a reality. One of my main mottos is that you are not reduced to where you come from. Where you were raised is part of who you are, but so is everywhere else, each and every experience that you go through is your roots, just as much as where you come from. Thatâs my belief. All those wonderful experiences, all those wonderful people that Iâve been privileged to work with are my foundation, just as much as where I come from.\n\nBenji B\n\nJust to fill people in, can you give us a few examples of people that you have collaborated with over the years?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nIâve been really privileged to work with some of my heroes. To start with yesterday I named a few. The music that was on when you came in was from Fela, and I produced a double album by Fela made of three songs. I worked with James Brown, the âGodfather of Soul,â that was a very short-lived experience but we will talk about that later. I worked with Mick Jagger, the Rolling Stones. I worked with Paul McCartney, we had a jam together in my studio. I just cannot believe even today that I did all those things with all those people. Herbie Hancock, Josef Zawinul. I am yet to work with Stevie Wonder, but we worked with Quincy Jones on the French bicentennial, he was our godfather. Thatâs more or less it, really.\n\nBenji B\n\nWhen would you say was the bulk of your most well-known music recorded?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nIn the â80s, I would say. Most of what people know about me came from the â80s area. In Europe and England I was involved with a band called Level 42. I was the so-called fifth member. I not only worked with them but we co-wrote tunes together. That was from the England side of things. From the West Indies, Island Records side of things, I would be talking about Grace Jones, Robert Palmer, the Talking Heads, Tom Tom Club, Jimmy Cliff, a bit of Bob Marley on a soundtrack that I did that was called Countryman. Um, Gregory Isaacs. I donât have a list of all that stuff. All that era. French artists as well, maybe if I say Serge Gainsbourg it will mean something to someone here. [people in audience nod] OK. Also lots of African artists, like Manu Dibango, Salif Keita, Youssou NâDour. I had the privilege to work with a fabulous Indian percussion player called Trilok Gurtu. I went to Bombay to work with him.\n\nBenji B\n\nI think we are going to go into depth in some of those areas later on, but you also were involved as a session player with some absolute smash hits in the â80s, certainly some records that were on heavy rotation when I was a child. Shall we let them have a listen?\n\n(music: Grace Jones â âPrivate Life (Dub)â)\n\nI used to be called Prophet. âHey, Prophet!â Ah, look at that. And it was, buy-ba-yup-by-yubup. To me it was just, OK, this is what I have for the time being. Iâll come back later and devise something smarter than this. I canât leave this. You canât keep this. There we go again. The good thing about working with people also is that you learn from them. You learn from their body language, you learn from the way they react, that youâre actually there. The thing that youâre looking for is already there. You donât have to be too hard on yourself sometimes.\n\nBenji B\n\nCan you tell us about what you learned from Sly & Robbie in that period?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nWell, that very thing, which is that if it was not cooking, it was not cooking, and there was no point trying to even go any further. Blackwell will come with a bunch of tunes to try, and they will give just a couple tries to each of them. If, on the second try, if it was not cooking, forget it. I was like, âThatâs it. Look, we can still do it. We can do it, please.â âNo, no. Itâs not happening. Forget it.â And they were right, because see, when I left Nassau, the very first year, I was so happy to be back to the regular thing. You know, nine in the morning, five to nine. Iâm on time. I was doing all those boring sessions, and one day I just put a cassette of the rough mixes of those things and I listened and realized that this was music. Thatâs what music is all about. Itâs got to be just there. Sometimes it needs to be worked. Sometimes it just needs to flow.\n\nThis is the hardest thing that we musicians have to come to terms with. When is it that you actually made it? Do you still need to work harder on what you did, or is it already there? How do you define that? Thereâs some level of self-censorship that we have to go through. Even I, I come with things. Thereâs one tune that I want you to have a listen to, but Iâm not even sure that you should listen to it because I donât know if itâs already there yet, you know? How do you define that? Thatâs where being a producer comes in.\n\nBenji B\n\nWhen is the painting finished, kind of thing?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nExactly. Talking about Fela, for instance. How can you produce Fela? Nobody can produce Fela. He is larger than life, OK? But even being larger than life, sometimes itâs good to have that other ear whoâs going to tell you that you already done it. Itâs there. Donât go any further. Thatâs all I did. I did not give any direction to Fela. I mean, Fela knows what heâs doing. I cannot teach him Afrobeat.\n\nBenji B\n\nYeah, but you still have to record the fifteen horns in the back.\n\nWally Badarou\n\nYeah, and the 20 women and fight against that kid who is trying to shut the SSL computer off right in the middle of the mix. That was horrendous, yet it was very short. We did the whole double album in three days from start to finish, mixing included. Well, we didnât have much time to fiddle around anyway. Each song is about forty-five minutes long, so the question was, âWhen does it start, actually?â We just had to be ready to go onto to blood light, as they say in Jamaica. Red button.\n\nBenji B\n\nHow did you know what was a take and what was rehearsal in that situation.\n\nWally Badarou\n\nWell, we just guessed that. By the time they rehearsed the fifth or seventh section of the song, they were ready to go. For us, they didnât even give us a start time. They just said, âOne, two,â and it was, âOh, get in,â and that was the take. There was no double take. There was no second chance.\n\nBenji B\n\nWeâve spoken extensively about your work as a session musician and as an arranger, but as youâve just mentioned, you also did a lot of producing as well. In your mind, what is a producer?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nAs I tried to say, itâs actually, for me, the man who is an alter-ego to the artist and who will be able to tell him that he is already there. Thatâs basically what a producer is. Actually, it is more than that obviously. In a conventional way the producer would choose the material with the artist, would choose the studio, the engineer, the musicians, the arranger â all of that. That is what a producer used to be in my days. Nowadays, people believe that being a producer is to go into a studio with a drum machine or a computer and start programming things. I never do that unless that is part of what the artist wants me to do. Being a producer for me is from start to finish discussing the project. What is it that you want to do? Why do you want to do this album? What is it that you want to make it different from the rest of the pack? Discuss that in-depth before going to the studio.\n\nBenji B\n\nHow do you get the best out of the artist once you are in the actual creative zone in the studio? What is the secret?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nI donât know if there is any. It really depends on the artist, it depends on the vibes, it depends on the music. There are always so many different parameters. There is one artist called Carlinhos Brown from Brazil. The man wouldnât stop writing. Every day he came with ten new songs. âWally, you should listen to this! Listen to this! Listen to this!â I said, âPlease, letâs finish what we already have in the works, and then we will go into something else.â There was a song called âArgila,â which was one of these new ideas, and it is one of the best songs in the album. I had to give to him at least a chance to listen to the album. He played acoustic guitar and I played Fender Rhodes and we did it in one take. We did it in one take because it was late at night, I was hungry, I was tired and I wanted to go home. And it is one of the best songs on the album.\n\nBenji B\n\nAs a producer, how do you react to being produced?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nIâve never been produced as a solo artist. As a session musician, it is like being an actor, you take directions from the producer. But most of the time I have been very lucky to work with a lot of people who wanted me in the studio because they knew that the type of color I would bring in, the type of melodies, counter-melodies, gimmicks and everything would just fit the work. One of the great examples of this is Gregory Isaacsâs Night Nurse â one of my all time favorite albums because it happened so very easily.\n\nThe album was not even planned to me, I just landed there and found out I was wanted on board, âHereâs the Prophet 5.â I was jetlagged, I was tired. Again, most of the great events of my life happened when I wanted to go home. It was a one night thing for me. All those 15 tracks maybe, done in one night! They had been cutting down the tracks for three or four days before. It was real fast, real sparse, fantastic singing, lots of space, beautiful. Still today, I play it as if I wasnât part of it. Iâm really proud of that album.\n\nBenji B\n\nIf youâre not sure what heâs talking about, youâll definitely recognize this in a minute.\n\n(music: Wally Badarou â âWolves in the Uralsâ)\n\nSo this album is really made of all those textures, of sounds evolving, morphing, from one to another and also, it was more melodically-based. Again, I didnât want be reduced to that neither. And then I also wanted to show what it is that makes me an African artist as well. So I came up with a third album in 2001, which had something like... Do I have it here? No, I donât have it here. Something in the vein of this.\n\n(music: Wally Badarou â unknown)\n\nOK, so those are the three things that Iâve been basing my work on, which is, I could do some hip-hop, R&B, jazz, soul. I could do some real orchestrated work as well. And I do also some African thing as well. I just didnât want to be reduced to any of those three branches. I just wanted people to understand that that was those three things at the same time.\n\nBenji B\n\nSo I guess this brings us onto the title of this session, really, âWhereâs Wally?â Because evidently thereâs an unbelievable body of work throughout the â80s, up until â89, and then thereâs nothing until 2001.\n\nWally Badarou\n\nThatâs right.\n\nBenji B\n\nKind of missing in action. Why did you decide to take your foot off the gas for a minute?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nFirst of all, I was quite happy and lucky to have gone through the â80s the way I went, which is working with great people and coming up with great projects. Yet, out of the â80s, I felt that I wanted to just concentrate on my own work. And by that time, I was not looking for a direction, but I was accumulating material that I wanted to build upon. And I was called to produce people. I did quite a lot of African artists and Brazilian and Indian production. They didnât get noticed, but they were there, so it didnât feel to me that I was actually taking steps back from the scene. But, it just didnât happen. Iâm still working on my own next project, solo project. And in the meantime, I discovered stage acting five years ago. And I thought that this was, at long last, a way to bring the stage performance together with music because, as I told you at the beginning, Iâm a studio man, basically, when it comes to music. Iâm a solitary worker. I work just by myself, and I love that. I love to collaborate with people also, but it remains a studio-confined effort. I didnât do much live work as a musician. I never toured with Level 42, for instance. I discovered stage acting because somebody made me believe that I could direct a movie one day. I said, âOh my God, if that ever happens I better know what it is to be an actor before I pretend that I can direct an actor.â So I went from the basics, I took lessons and discovered a new love, which is stage acting. Which is unbelievable. That explained also that I am taking longer to complete my next musical project, but it will happen. Donât you ever worry.\n\nBenji B\n\nThanks then. Well, I think at this point we need to say thank you. [audience applause]\n\nWally Badarou\n\nThank you.\n\nBenji B\n\nItâs not quite over yet, Wally, because I am about to open the questions up to the floor. Please, please donât feel shy about asking questions. I know this is the first lecture, but itâs highly likely that anything that you are interested in finding out the answer to, the rest of us are as well. Is there anyone that would like to elect themselves? Great, OK. There should be a mic on itâs way to you soonish.\n\nAudience Member\n\nHi, Wally. Thanks so much, that was an incredible speech. Iâm sure we all really appreciate it. Iâve just got a question in particular about this record here, Nightclubbing. This is probably one of my favorite records ever. Itâs actually Ninaâs record, but Iâve got this back at the hotel as well. Iâm sorry Iâm rambling on here. My question is with the stuff that you did, the pop stuff that we played earlier, itâs very much the US sort of influence, and then you had the Level 42 was to me a very English sort of sound. But this record here when I first heard it, it was just a very exotic sort of sound to me. I guess working with Sly & Robbie that was a very sort of Jamaican sound. On that record in particular, the outstanding track to me was âIâve Seen That Face Before.â That was just a very exotic, French sort of sounding record. Can you talk to us about that record?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nThat was the point actually. When Chris Blackwell had that idea of making me and Barry Reynolds, the guitar player who used to work a lot with Marianne Faithfull, to join Sly & Robbie was to actually create that sort of cocktail of influences. It was not going to be a regular reggae session. It was not going to be a regular disco session either. I remember when we flew together, Barry and I, and discovered Sly & Robbie, we were fighting because we knew that these guys were Jamaican and they were going to ask us, âCan you play reggae?â And we would come in and say, âWell, we donât know that we can play reggae, but can you read music?â Anyway, that never happened. Actually, there was a sense of uneasiness at first. Then the whole thing started to gel from âPrivate Life.â Then we realized that there was a groove and there was some sophisticated synthetic electronic palettes upon the groove. Thatâs what made it so different. So that was the key.\n\nAudience Member\n\nYeah, thatâs fantastic. Thank you.\n\nBenji B\n\nA good tune to illustrate that work.\n\nWally Badarou\n\nShe needs a mic.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThank you. I just wanted to ask more about the actual creation of sounds. Listening to your stuff is breathtaking. I was wondering with all the incredible people you get to work with, do you ever take stuff from the sessions? As far as sampling, I know thatâs a touchy issue, but take like, say you work with an amazing singer or vocalist, when you have those strings coming in on that sound it almost sounded like you couldnât tell if it was a violin or a voice. Do you use, from working in these sessions have you ever taken peopleâs things and worked them in to these incredible soundscapes that youâre making in sounds?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nMost of the time I would develop all those sounds by myself. Iâm glad you are raising that issue, because it has always been a question on how I would work. Developing a sound takes time. Itâs a time-consuming process. Most of the time you have producer, the artist, and everybody sitting here just getting bored to death, because itâs not very spectacular. Itâs not entertaining at all. I mean, it wasnât. Thatâs probably where being familiar with your machine was key first.\n\nSecondly, working with people who understood the process was very important. Chris Blackwell, who produced those Grace Jones albums, realized from day one that I needed my space before myspace.com was ever invented. He just left me alone. He said, âWally needs his space. Thatâs Wallyâs part now, everybody out of the studio.â I was privileged to have all the time I needed to do my own thing. When I worked on Foreigner, âI Want To Know What Love Is,â I had what we call slave tapes. I had my own studio within the big studio. When they were cutting all the drums and everything I had my own thing where I could develop my own sounds. So that was key, yes. Most of the sounds that I would use, even though I might not create them right on the spot, were created by myself either from other sessions or in my own home as well. Itâs a combination of different sources. Some of them I would create from scratch.\n\nAudience Member\n\nSomething like strings of a violin. I found some of the best synthesizers today had such a hard sound to come up with, and yours sounds so warm. Are you building on ones that are already synthesized or are you actually getting strings in to your bass?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nLayers. Layers of different things, but it also has a lot to do with the line that Iâm trying to do as well, so the sound will depend a lot on the line itself. The type of layers that Iâll be coming up with will be dependent on that as well. How to put it... Itâs a combination of different things. Sometimes I would just muck about and fiddle with nubs and fiddle with the bank presets, but I would create. Then things will just pop in and I will say, âOh, thatâs cool. Letâs keep it.â Thatâs what happened with âAddicted to Love,â for instance. Most of the time I would try, I would think of something that I wanted to do and would develop a sound in respect to that thing I wanted to do.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThank you.\n\nWally Badarou\n\nYes, please. There are two more over there.\n\nAudience Member\n\nHi.\n\nWally Badarou\n\nHi.\n\nAudience Member\n\nAs someone who has worked with as a composer and producer, in terms of making a record how would you weigh at the importance of composing the ideas and producing how those ideas are realized in to the final piece of music?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nItâs the most difficult part, especially if you work by yourself. Thereâs a reason why I think itâs very important that no matter how you proceed that you get people to listen to what you do. At least listen to, if not produce. Producing has a lot to do with listening. Listening to what is actually happening. I found myself on the verge of losing it if I didnât have somebody to come in and just listen to what I was doing. Just by the body language telling me how far I was to the point that I wanted to make. Producing is very hard. Self-producing is very hard. Itâs like self-directing. I donât know how Woody Allen does his movies. Heâs incredible. Heâs not just a great actor, not just a great movie storyteller, but heâs also self-directing, which is unbelievably hard. I believe that he must have, he too, him too, people who can watch. By just their body language, he can tell that heâs there or not. Yes. Does that answer your question?\n\nAudience Member\n\nYeah. What Iâm looking for is how you weigh out the importance of composition of the final production.\n\nWally Badarou\n\nComposition is first. I know this is a strange place to say it, but composition to me is key. Production is important because it will make the value of the composition reach the world. Yet, if an idea doesnât make it by your production, it may happen with somebody elseâs production. As long as you have the gems in the can, which is the idea first, then youâre there. Thatâs how I think of it. I may be wrong. Sometimes I know that Iâm wrong on that issue. This is what I want to believe. I feel more comfortable that way. Thank you.\n\nAudience Member\n\nFirst of all, I shall say that this is one of my most favorite albums ever. I guess, the first question is whatâs it like when you first put those synths and Grace just, she was just here or synths first or what? How does it all work?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nGrace would cut the tracks with us. Actually, the whole of the album was done very conventionally, which is that she would do guide vocals as we were playing. Chris Blackwell would sit as well in the studio with us. Then, parts would be fixed here and there, basses, guitar. Then I would have my own shot, fine-tuning, revising, redoing some of the parts. Then, she will do the finished vocals. Thatâs how it usually worked. Sometimes, she would do her vocals before I do my little icing things. Take for example that tune called âLibertango, Iâve Seen That Face Before.â That one actually was sung before I did most of the synthetic part on it, which allowed me to really be doing those things in between her vocals to highlight them. Pleasure.\n\nAudience Member\n\nHow did you feel when you were at the table or are you sometimes on the guitar?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nThe way I write is very, very specific. I would proceed almost like Josef Zawinul, which is that I would sit on the acoustic piano and develop ideas on the acoustic piano, record them, and forget about them for years. Then, in the back of my mind without even knowing, ideas will flow out of those ideas to complete them, to make them richer, to develop them. Iâm very grateful that youâre asking this question. I believe the composition has a lot to do with just that sparkling little idea at first that was magic even before you knew it. Itâs a very simple, little tiny, little melody, chord change, sound, rhythm. It could last five seconds or half an hour, depending on how great you felt about when you did it. I know my weaknesses. I know that, just let it go, I will probably kill the thing without even knowing what was the real value. Thatâs why I never rush any of my production. Thatâs why itâs taking so long actually. I just leave this thing, age like good wine. Youâre French, right? Yes. I like that. I leave it to rest like a good wine, and if three years later it still talks to me like it did when I did it, wow, I know I have something.\n\nAudience Member\n\nCan I ask another question too? [inaudible]?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nOh, no, actually, I tell you what. Iâm glad youâre talking about it. We never watched the movies, no. We were doing those things that were called kilometers music. Music aux kilometre in French, right? Which means that all we were required to do was just any music, really. Just play music. We just had a long jam. We never watch any of those movies, sorry to say. Yes, anybody?\n\nAudience Member\n\nHello?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nYes, hello.\n\nAudience Member\n\nWhat do you think about this virtualâ¦\n\nWally Badarou\n\nSynthesizers. I think theyâre fantastic. Theyâre getting better and better and better and better. They lack one thing. Physical. Again, itâs a matter of generation. Itâs a matter of getting used to whatever you have. People, you want to believe that you needed to fee; the knobs in order to actually come up with a great sound. Itâs true, to a certain extent, if youâre used to it. Then, you can also do it differently. I used to have a Synclavier years ago. A Synclavier was what, a big keyboard, one knob. Loads of push buttons that you needed to activate in order to go to page number 23 in order to do this shape. I mean, it took forever, it could take forever. But then you could develop strategies to actually get faster to this or that aspect of things, which is not slower or more time-consuming than actually using your mouse or your trackpad. Itâs a matter of getting used to whatever medium you have.\n\nBenji B\n\nIf you have to take the Pepsi challenge on it, with a blindfold, are you really honest that you canât hear a difference between the two?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nOh yes, you can. Iâm not saying that you cannot. Iâm saying that theyâre just as good. I donât want to develop a cult of vintage, I keep my vintage gear because I know it, thatâs all. I could almost blind program the Prophet 5, I know where the knobs are, âOK, OK, alright.â Because I know the Prophet 5, Iâve been using it for so long. Thereâs also a distinct sound out of it. Whether the emulation of the virtual copy of the Prophet 5 matches or does not match the Prophet 5 is no issue to me. It has its own distinct thing as well. Iâm sure that one day people are going to look at those virtual synthesizer as being just classic as just the Prophet 5 ever was. I remember when the Prophet 5 came in, people used to laugh at it also, saying, âWell, it doesnât have the meat that you can have on the CS-80 Yamaha.â Yes, but today, itâs a classic. What the fuss, sorry. Excuse my French. Yes?\n\nAudience Member\n\nI just have a question about performance. Itâs refreshing to see you not getting stuck on the warmth of analog and vintage gear. But as far as performance is concerned do you, what do you value from your performance? Do you ever go and change the velocity of something that you thought you were doing it with your fingers or change the sounds of something that ... Or do you ... Are you really dedicated to getting it right with your fingers in the performance?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nItâs a combination. Actually, are you talking about live performance?\n\nAudience Member\n\nNo, Iâm talking about like your productions. For you is that something that you focus more on getting a performance right, like, if itâs not right. Do you go and play it again? Or do you like fix it in the computer now that youâre using a computer?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nI do just as much as you do. The issue is I can play keyboard to a certain extent. Iâm glad I can do that. It really helps a lot. Yet, I know that at some stage itâll be preferable to keep the magic of the past that I did and just fiddle with things like the velocity, the filters, and everything afterwards. So I do just as much as you do. Itâs just that it all really depends on how. Itâs all a question of how much I spend actually doing the main substance. Yeah, I can be fast on that, but see Iâve seen Herbie Hancock once in the studio doing a pass on a Manu Dibango album. Everybody was like, âWow listen to this!â One take. Heâs got it. And the man was not happy. âNo, no way, youâre not going to keep this. I need to re-do it. Please let me do it again. I mean itâs just so bad let me do it again.â He did it fifteen times and at the end of that the thing was dead, even him. You know Herbie Hancock, as big, as great as he is, was capable of destroying his own work. Luckily enough, we kept the first take. Now we all have to learn, OK? I can still improve my playing just as much as you. Probably, I mean donât know but, you know I do not consider myself the best keyboard player ever. I have things that can work that I know how to do and I can achieve quicker than other people, but I still have to work on it. Yeah.\n\nWally Badarou\n\nYes?\n\nAudience Member\n\nAbout the creation of the melody, does it generally come from your voice?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nNowadays, yes. Most of what I did in the past came from the keyboard. Out of playing and jamming and just practicing. I would spend hours just practicing. No aim, nothing in sight other than just feel good about keeping my fingers unrested. And an idea would pop up and I would capture that and that would be it. Then, I would develop on it later as I said earlier on. Nowadays, Iâm more into developing ideas from within or from guitar. I can play some guitar as well. Ideas that I get from playing guitar are very, very different from the ideas that I get from the keyboard. Very different, because the guitar somehow I do not master as much as I do keyboards, and also itâs definitely more basic. So melodiesâ¦ Oh, can I play something?\n\nBenji B\n\nPlease.\n\nWally Badarou\n\nQuick Wally, people are waiting. People are waiting. Theyâre not going to wait any longer. [mumbles] There it is.\n\n(music: Wally Badarou â unknown)\n\nThis is a soundtrack. There is no keyboard in it, only strings, guitars, and my voice. Very different. [applause] Thank you.\n\nAudience Member\n\nYou didnât tell us and Mary anything about your work statement in France, but let me search up Michael Maslow.\n\nWally Badarou\n\nOh yes.\n\nAudience Member\n\nWhat kind of work would you do with him and what. All the works you would do in Franceâ¦\n\nWally Badarou\n\nIn France ...\n\nAudience Member\n\nYou also told. Self-production is hard and is it harder to work with a guy who is a self producer?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nOh, no! OK. There are two questions in your question, okay. Yeah, the work that I did with the French people are known to the French, most of the time, because itâs in the French language. I worked in Los Angeles with a singer called Alain Chamfort and Serge Gainsbourg was doing the lyrics. Thatâs how we worked together on that project. And, working with a self-producer, thatâs a very interesting question because thatâs what I want to do. Today Iâm interested in self-productions because I believe that there is nothing more exciting than people who know that what they have to do, they have to do it by themselves first. And then, get somebody else in to just balance some of the decision, some of the direction, just make sure that they are into something.\n\nAudience Member\n\nHow do you feel if you are working with someone?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nYes. Absolutely. Actually, that comes from the fact that I do not believe that as a producer I should be doing the down work, which is programming the drums and all that. That to me is not just producing. This is writing. So if weâre talking about collaborating on the writing level, then fine. Letâs do that. But itâs a much longer process. If youâre talking about producing, I mean, Iâm not going to play anything other than just some icing you want a bit of my personal touch here and there. I would be glad to do that. But, I shouldnât be doing the core of your work. Thatâs your right.\n\nAudience Member\n\nYou started talking about co-production and the line...\n\nWally Badarou\n\nYeah, the line is very thin between the two. And actually, I do more core production in that respect, nowadays. So if you have anything that you want to show to me and you want me to be core producing with you, please. [laughs] Iâll be down to do that. It means to me ... As long as you know that sometimes my share of the work can just be, âOK, OK, what youâre doing is great you donât need to do more, keep it that way, letâs go and release it.â If youâre ready to take that from me, if youâre ready to take that word from me, then we can work together. But, if you believe that I have to actually go and analyze and put everything, tear everything apart before you have something out, thereâs no point calling me. Thatâs how I work with Salif Keita. Salif Keita has a band, a fantastic band. He said âWally, we want you to come in here and have a listen, what do you think?â And I said, âThis is great. Donât touch it. Letâs go in the studio, you want to do it?â âYes, lets do it!â I did virtually nothing else than refrain people from overplaying. Thatâs all I did. That was my production. [applause] Thank you. {to audience member] Go ahead.\n\naudience member\n\nYou space it out into the main product. A lot of respect for the space. Is that something like [inaudible] or is it like, you know come back in after the vocal is done?\n\nWally Badarou\n\nYouâre talking about the studio work that...\n\naudience member\n\nYeah.\n\nWally Badarou\n\nIf I understand your question.\n\naudience member\n\nSorry.\n\nWally Badarou\n\nYes. Youâre trying to figure out...\n\naudience member\n\nIt seems like you have a great spec for the written section in space.\n\nWally Badarou\n\nYes. Well itâs something that is natural to me. I mean, I donât, I like to be more precise. When I first started, I was a very busy keyboard player. I would play everything, put clavinets everywhere, I would just fill the tape with just takes, OK? I was a clavinet guy, you know I used to [sings a beat]. I wouldnât leave one little thing. And I realized that I was going the wrong way. I realized it and what helped me realize that was those guys, âPrivate Life,â Sly & Robbie. Loads of space. Now, I must say something here to the memory of that guy. His name was Alex Sadkin. He engineered those fantastic albums: Nightclubbing, Warm Leatherette, Joe Cocker, Sheffield Steel, Talking Heads. All those things were engineered by that guy and what that guy did was even before MIDI was invented which allowed us today to be able to sit back and listen to things that are almost already mixed. This guy, out of the tape machine was capable of putting almost finished mixes every time. Each time. So, when I was working I had almost the finished version already. The drums, the bass sounded magnificent before I even started putting my keyboards, when I did âPrivate Lifeâ overdubs. That way, I knew that I didnât have to fill things, you know.\n\nWe used to do that a long time ago where you only have the proper rough mix, so you did not know where you stood, right? So, you would just fill the tape, just in case. You know, just in case we need something here, let me put it. Thatâs wrong. I mean, to me it seems wrong today. Right? Nowadays, itâs easy to figure that out because itâs so easy to have the great sound right out the box. But in those days, it was... So I made it something very personal that I will always fight for something that would be as sparse as possible. Very, very sober.\n\nBenji B\n\nDo we have time to play a quick example of that? Yeah, we canât finish without playing a bit of this and I think that this is a beautiful example both of your point and also the talk about engineering and sonics."
