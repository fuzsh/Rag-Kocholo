        "text": "Apiento\n\nWhen he’s not running the brilliant Test Pressing site or DJing as Apiento, Paul Byrne is researching and writing a book on Grace Jones and the legendary Bahaman studio Compass Point. Knee deep in the world of Chris Blackwell’s Island Records and an avowed Grace Jones fanatic, Byrne makes the case for ‘Private Life’ representing the peak of major label music.\n\nGrace Jones\n\n‘Private Life’ from Warm Leatherette\n\n(Island Records, 1980)\n\nBuy / Listen\n\nA super obvious choice but in my opinion one of the greatest records put to tape (when they still did that). As many people know Grace Jones went from being a disco artist to one of the most forward-thinking artists of her day during her Compass Point period and this track heralds the start of that time. Miss Jones always had charisma and an attitude but at Compass Point she found her edge. This is also the point where Chris Blackwell’s – producer and head honcho of Island Records – plan of pulling together the ultimate house band worked perfectly. Add Grace and you’re flying. I’m preaching to the choir here but you’ve got Sly & Robbie, Wally Badarou and Barry Reynolds on lead guitar all topped off, or underpinned by, by Sticky Thompson on percussion and Mikey Chung on rhythm guitar. ‘Private Life’ is major label music at its peak. An amazing artist, amazing band, incredible performances and production from Alex Sadkin and Chris Blackwell, all recorded at one of the most high tech studios of its day based in paradise all coming together in one of the finest records ever made. Play loud."
