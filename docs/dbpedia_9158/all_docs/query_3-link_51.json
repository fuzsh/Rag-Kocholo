        "text": "It's an old discussion that doesn't really belong in this Roy Acuff thread in my opinion. In short: labels like Mosaic and Bear Family (e.g. the Carter Family set) put a lot of research, time, capital etc. into their sets, only to see their masterings \"borrowed\" by Proper, JSP (with the exception of the sets that were mastered by the late John R.T. Davies), Definitive, Lonehill, etc., and that's why I'm not buying stuff from them.\n\nSorry for the thread crap.\n\nBTW, The CD reissue of the \"Greatest Hits\" LP is all rechanneled, but this is the only CD with the master take of \"Lonesome Old River Blues\" and for the longest time, \"This World Can't Stand Long.\" The master take of the latter would later be used on the 2004 \"Essential Roy Acuff\" compilation. Both of these songs on the 1992 \"Essential Roy Acuff\" CD use alternate takes.\n\nFor those who want an inexpensive way to get this song on CD with great sound, pick up the Moe & Joe Super Hits CD, but pick up Steve's Moe & Joe twofer on S&P.\n\ni just got the older Columbia CD \"The Essential Roy Acuff - 1936-1949\" from yourmusic.com (since they're not going to offer it any longer after their stock runs out). it has twenty cuts and is probably a good buy if you're looking for a single disc Acuff compilation (although it does have 3 alt. takes as brad mentioned above). plus, it was produced by Bob Irwin and mastered by Vic Anesini. as far as sound quality is concerned, i never hesitate to buy anything that has Bob's name on it.\n\nThere are lots of Roy Acuff tracks including a few not on the older Essential Roy Acuff on the first of the 5 volume VA series \"Columbia Country Classics\" http://www.sonymusicstore.com/store/catalog/MerchandiseDetails.jsp?merchId=10251&skuId=27147. Volume 5 is the only disc that has gone out of print in the series but it can easily be found used on Amazon, eBay, etc.\n\nDon't these older Columbia CDs suffer from noise reduction?\n\nA lot of these were done by Bob Irwin and Vic Anesini but Don Meehan did Vol. 1 of the series and these do contain a lot of tracks that are hard to find on other CDs.\n\nOn January 8, JSP will release the first in a series of Complete Okeh/Columbia master recordings boxed sets with their first volume containing his first 100 commercial recordings, and lots of these aren't even on the Proper boxed set and had never been on CD before. This first boxed set contains 6 CDs. If you want to get your feet wet, get the Proper boxed set.\n\nThat's good news, but I really hope they won't tamper with the sound...\n\nI ordered my copy on Amazon U.K. and I just noticed that it is shipping\n\nAccording to Amazon (scroll down) it's 4 CDs.\n\nI've just received the JSP Acuff box set. It's indeed 4 CDs. It says on the back of the slip case that many of the tracks were sourced from the Joe Bussard Collection and that the original 78s were sourced and transferred by Chris King. I haven't listened to the set yet.\n\nAny updates on this collection? How is it? I'm thinking of getting either hte JSP box or the Proper box, but I can't decide which one I want!\n\nI'd recommend the JSP box to start along with the Columbia Essential CD. I also have a great Bear Family 2 CD set that goes from 1953 to 1958 and covers Capitol, Decca and MGM. Finally Ace has released 2 twofers of his Hickory output from the 60s...fabulous stuff! I can't wait for Bear Family to change their minds and do the big one\n\nAttached Files:\n\nAcuff1.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n15.7 KB\n\nViews:\n\n0\n\nI was fortunate to see Roy Acuff many times on the Opry. He most frequently performed Wabash Cannonball, Wreck on the Highway, and Great Speckled Bird. Charlie Collins, a longtime member of Acuff's Smoky Mountain Boys, still performs regularly on the Opry, as one-half of the Opry Square Dance Band. Collins performed each weekend on the Opry with another veteran of the Smoky Mountain Boys, dobro virtuoso Bashful Brother Oswald (Beecher Ray Kirby) until Kirby's death in 2002. Many early country music groups included one member who provided comic relief. Kirby filled that role for Acuff, much like Speck Rhodes with Porter Waggoner's Wagonmasters.\n\nThis is indeed true although I was never fortunate to see Roy in person on the Opry, I saw him perform on the Opry regularly via TNN.\n\nI'd get the JSP. It has generally good transfers and it features Acuff's complete first 100 sides from 1936-1944 (his best years in my view) as far as I can see. It's Vol.1 in a series, though I haven't seen Vol.2 yet."
