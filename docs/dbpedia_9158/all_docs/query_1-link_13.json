        "text": "Linda Martell was drawn to country music at a young age, but her appreciation for a wide variety of musical genres would lead her to numerous performances at the Charleston Air Force Base. During one of those performances, officers in the crowd harassed Martell, insisting she sing a country song. She finally gave in, giving a performance that blew those in attendance away and landed her a record deal as a country artist. Born June 4, 1941, in Leesville, S.C., Martell began singing in church ar age 5. She grew up in nearby Columbia, S.C., where she took an interest in country, blues, jazz and R&B. She would begin performing R&B tunes with a small group in clubs around Columbia, as well as the Charleston Air Force Base. Following the famed country performance at the base, a serviceman who'd been in the audience told a friend, Duke Rayner, from Nashville, Tenn., about the singer. Rayner reached out to Martell who persuaded her to fly to Nashville for a demo recording session. The demo was taken to record producer/label owner, Shelby Singleton, who would sign Martell to the Plantation label. Her debut single, \"Color Him Father,\" was released in the summer of 1969 and reached the Top 25. In Aug. 1969, after a meeting with Roy Acuff, Martell began the first African-American woman to appear on the Grand Ole Opry. She would make a total of 12 Opry appearances. Her debut album, \"Color Me Country,\" was released in 1970. Martell would make many television appearances, including on popular syndicates like Country Carnival and Midwestern Hayride, as well as Hee Haw. Her 1970 singles, \"Before the Next Teardrop Falls\" and \"Bad Case of the Blues\" would crack the Top 60, but would be her last chart appearances. Martel retired from the music business in 1974, following her 12th Opry appearance."
