        "text": "Kho Gaye Hum Kaha, as the title of the film suggests, shows how lost we have become as a generation; so entrapped in the world of filters that we have lost touch with our real selves.\n\n<span;>•Wedding• <span;>Twenty three broken mirrors <span;>Glazed with the hazelnut ice-cream of your wedding <span;>Slashed eyeballs rolling down the savannah green floor <span;>Fresh milk spilling over the granite kitchen slab <span;>Smoke rising from burning cigarettes <span;>And a few hopes crying <span;>Women wearing pretty white gowns <span;>Their cheeks painted in red and golden <span;>Grooving, holding their red […]\n\nFrom patriarchy, homophobia, body-shaming, and cancel culture, KJo's films have always mirrored these issues of the 21st century, offering steady solutions amidst the grandeur of their setting.\n\nAs I, with my heartbreak, visit and revisit our memories of love, I realize how closely my life is similar to the 1987 Bollywood film, Ijaazat, directed by Gulzar.\n\nThrough his words, he taught us to express our heart, chase our dreams, make each day of our life count - because life is uncertain and we never know what awaits for us tomorrow.\n\nEvery time Dimple and you crossed paths, my heart skipped a beat seeing both of your pensive eyes which clearly exhibited the unsaid feelings of both your hearts.\n\nIn both the seasons of Masaba Masaba, witnessing your journeys and the hurdles both of you endured both in personal and professional lives, teaches us so much.\n\nSexual matters are certainly important themes for a teen drama, however, teenage is also about exploring oneself in other things in life.\n\nBe it operation Bluestar, Anti-Sikh riots, the Kargil War, Bombay blasts or the Bombay attack of 9/11, all these events deeply impacted Laal and are an integral part of his journey\n\nLove doesn't always mean holding on, sometimes it's all about letting go of the people you love because they deserve better lives.\n\n‘Shameless’ exposes the shamelessness of financially solvent human beings like Praveen who misuse technology.\n\nDesires are something we all possess irrespective of age but society dictates what desires one should have as per their age.\n\nBaai's last words before her death will resonate inside me for a long time - \"Pata hai khane mein sabse ahem kya hota hai? (Do you know the most important ingredient of food?)\"\n\nThar depicts how the quest for revenge brings the beast out of a human being leading to the degradation of humanity.\n\nAlizeh, brilliantly portrayed by Anushka Sharma, is an emotionally layered character who never peddled her vulnerabilities, and inspires everyone not to change themselves or their decisions for anyone else in their lives.\n\nTagore successfully intertwined the two feminine characters, Binodini and Ashalata as one antithesis of the other in \"Chokher Bali\".\n\nArjun Talwar, you might not be perfect but your selfless love for your family and passion will etch you in our hearts forever.\n\nMarilyn was always frightened that she would be betrayed by the people she loved. Her insecurities made her complex and difficult for people around to understand her.\n\nAnatomy of a Scandal presents to us the brutal reality of this world where power empowers men like James Whitehouse to get away with anything they do.\n\nI am in absolute awe of the way Sakshi Tanwar's Sheel maintains a fine balance between her family, her work, and her mission to unveil the truth behind her daughter's murder."
