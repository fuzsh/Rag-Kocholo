Despite the friendship, PK has a hidden agenda. To uncover his motives, viewers will have to watch \"Kolkata Diaries\" on July 18th.\n\nDirector Rashed Raha describes the film as a unique tale of love, friendship, and betrayal. \"Kolkata Diaries is a story about relationships,\" he says. \"It highlights the trust, love, and tensions in small relationships. I hope the audience will enjoy the film.\"\n\nMushfiqur Rahman Manzu, Bongo's chief content officer, shared his excitement about the film: \"Kolkata Diaries is a new movie by director Rashed Raha. Previously, his web series 'Dome' was released on our platform. This new film is a collaborative effort between Bangladesh and India. We found the story captivating, so we decided to bring it exclusively to Bongo for the first time. We believe our audience will love it.\"\n\n\"Kolkata Diaries\" marks the return of actress Sreelekha Mitra to Bangladeshi cinema after a long time and this film is the first Bangladeshi movie for actress Darshana Banik.\n\nThe film will be available for streaming on the Bongo app and website starting 18 July."
