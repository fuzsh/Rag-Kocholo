        "text": "I chanced upon this film out of the blue and realized it is always good to catch a not over hyped, light film with an inherent interesting message. The message in the film, the old Arabian tale of Aladin’s magic lamp set in contemporary Calcutta, is simple yet profound. The gadget freak genie informs his disillusioned, heartbroken owner at some point that “Rupkothay sobta bola thake na” or ‘not everything is mentioned in fairy tales’.\n\nWe all just prefer to look at the bright side of a tale, but each has its dark corners which raises its ugly head from time to time.\n\nAschorjo Pradip based on Shirshendu Mukhopadhya’s story has been adapted as an adult fable with witty dialogues, sarcasm and believable protagonists by the director Anik Dutta (of Bhuter Bhobisyat fame). Anil (Saswata Chatterjee in a spectacled, relevant rings on his finger to improve his fate persona) and Jhumur (Sreelekha Mitra) a typical middle class Bengali couple live, aspire and fight it out on a daily basis in an overstuffed with furniture 1.5 room rented accommodation in a Bechu Dutta lane (sounds middle class enough !) house where Anil has lived all his life.\n\nThey have hazaar issues in their life and marriage – husband does not speak enough English to appear for their son’s admission test, son wants a playstation, wife needs a brand new i10 since her sister has a bigger car, she regrets marrying him just because she liked his songs in a Pujo pandal, husband hardly sings anymore, the son pukes whenever he has to drink milk for breakfast, the husband needs to work harder to meet sales target and secretly pines for his company’s sultry Bong bombshell brand ambassador who goes by the cheeky name Mala M(aal), he turns the photograph of Baba Loknath to face the wall when he tries to cajole his wife for physical intimacy – it is basically a household we all have seen / been to at some point in our lives.\n\nThe first half till Saswata comes across the magic lamp while helping neighbourhood kids find their cricket ball, has its good moments. Of course, if you are a Bengali, you totally get the jokes; not sure if they will come across that funny in translation.\n\nSample this: Anil late for his office, having been rejected by Taxi drivers somehow manages to get himself in a crowded bus. As the bus takes a nasty turn he nearly falls over a lady standing in front of him. Lady turns and looks at him with pure disgust. Just as she opens her mouth to say something, Anil says “Ache”. The taant wearing lady angered beyond recognition snaps “Ki ache?” Anil stoically replies, “Barite ma bon ache”.\n\nSaswata is good. I have seen him in 2-3 movies till now and have started acknowledging him as an actor who does have a range.\n\nAs expected, once the lamp is rubbed, the genie (Rajatava Dutta in a bald, blue tooth wielding plastic avatar) makes an appearance and thus starts the new, always wanted but could not afford life of Anil’s. He is able to purchase a duplex apartment in a swanky project, hangs out at the famed Golf club, and drinks premium scotch at expensive eateries, closes business deals successfully with international companies’ blah blah.\n\nOf course, like all stories this ends one fine day. And not on a nice note at all. I personally found the climax interesting.\n\nYes, the film could have done away with all the songs except Charidik bodle gechhe, wherein composer Raja Narayan Deb collaborates with Amit Kumar to recreate the evergreen number sung by his legendary father Kishore Kumar, Prithibi bodle gechhe. Keeping the melody intact, the director has re-worked the lyrics. Yes, the film could have been edited better. It does drag in the second half and there are some boring stereotypes (Marwari businessman stating Bengalis are only bothered about culture, art and Tagore, a typical atheist intellectual who corrects Anil’s English pronunciation etc) but it is definitely worth a one-time watch.\n\nOne should not always look for deep, meaningful in every frame cinema. Grab a beer, get some snacks and chill today evening with Aschorjo Pradip.\n\n*************"
