        "text": "Hurricane Katrina, the costliest storm in US history, devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005. The immediate impact of the storm killed nearly 2,000 individuals and displaced more than one million residents, resulting in the largest migration of US residents since the Dust Bowl of the 1930s (Nigg, Barnshaw, and Torres 2006). Climate models predict that such extreme weather events will increase in frequency and severity (Field et al. 2012), yet little is known about the effects of environmental catastrophes on long-run health and longevity, which represent considerable economic value (Murphy and Topel 2006).\n\nThe disruption induced by extreme weather events can be used to illuminate factors that affect the accumulation or depreciation of health capital (Grossman 1972). For example, when a disaster displaces people from their homes, the regions they move to may play an important role in shaping long-term health outcomes. While life expectancy varies significantly across US locations (Chetty et al. 2016, Dwyer-Lindgren et al. 2017), little is known about the extent to which this variation reflects the causal effect of place on health. Because Hurricane Katrina displaced many survivors, it can serve as a natural experiment of how place affects long-term health. If the geographic variation in life expectancy reflects causal effects of place, then the widespread migration out of New Orleans to regions with better economic and health conditions may have generated health benefits.\n\nThis paper has two primary aims. The first is to estimate the short- and long-run mortality impacts of Hurricane Katrina on the elderly and the long-term disabled of New Orleans. Prior studies have evaluated how demographic and economic outcomes evolve after environmental catastrophes (e.g., Hornbeck 2012; Hornbeck and Naidu 2014; Nakamura, Sigurdsson, and Steinsson 2017), but little is known about the long-run health effects of these events, especially among adults. The second aim is to estimate how the mortality of displaced survivors was shaped by their destinations.\n\nQuantifying the long-run health impacts of events like Hurricane Katrina has proven difficult, largely due to lack of data that capture pre-disaster outcomes and track individuals post-disaster with minimal attrition. To overcome this challenge, we use Medicare administrative data from 1992 to 2013 that allow us to follow elderly and long-term disabled individuals over time and space and provide exact dates of death. We identify Medicare cohorts living in New Orleans just prior to Hurricane Katrina and trace out their mortality rates up to eight years after the storm, regardless of whether or where they move.\n\nTo identify how outcomes would have evolved in the absence of Hurricane Katrina, we measure mortality for comparable Medicare cohorts initially residing in ten cities that were not directly affected by the hurricane, following Deryugina, Kawano, and Levitt (2018). To validate this control group, we show that mortality trends in the New Orleans and control city cohorts were similar prior to Hurricane Katrina as far back as 1992, the earliest year for which we have data. We then estimate the causal effects of the hurricane by comparing how the New Orleans cohort’s post-hurricane outcomes changed relative to those of the comparison cohort (i.e., a cohort-level difference-in-differences event study analysis).1\n\nWe find that in 2005, the year of the storm, Hurricane Katrina increased mortality by 0.56 percentage points (over 10 percent of the mean). Most of these excess deaths occurred within a week of the hurricane’s landfall, and this immediate effect dissipated over several months. In contrast to the short-run mortality increase, we find that Hurricane Katrina led to sustained reductions in mortality from 2006 to 2013. This long-run mortality decline is not explained by short-run mortality displacement, or “harvesting.” Inclusive of the initial increase in mortality, Hurricane Katrina increased the probability of surviving through 2013, eight years past the storm, by 2.07 percentage points, a 3.2 percent increase relative to the overall eight-year survival rate of the 2005 New Orleans cohort.\n\nWe also find that the hurricane led to a massive and lasting dislocation of the elderly and long-term disabled, consistent with prior evidence on the demographic effects of the hurricane (Deryugina, Kawano, and Levitt 2018; Eyer et al. 2018). Medicare beneficiaries living in New Orleans as of March 2005 were nearly 50 percentage points more likely to leave their commuting zone of residence than members of the control group. Over one-half of those who left had not returned as of 2013, conditional on being alive. New Orleans was one of the highest mortality areas in the country prior to Hurricane Katrina, and displaced individuals generally moved to lower-mortality regions. To the extent that local mortality outcomes reflect place-specific determinants of health, relocation to lower-mortality regions may have driven the decline in mortality among Hurricane Katrina victims.\n\nTo directly examine the role of place on health, we examine the mortality patterns among New Orleans residents who had moved away by March 2006. We find that hurricane survivors who moved to low-mortality regions subsequently experienced lower mortality than survivors who moved to high-mortality regions. Specifically, each percentage point increase in the destination region’s mortality rate corresponds to a 0.83–1.01 percentage point increase in the movers’ mortality rate. This effect emerges quickly after the move, suggesting it does not arise entirely through slow-moving channels such as lifestyle.\n\nThe relationship between local and migrant mortality describes the causal effect of place on individual mortality under the assumption that baseline mortality risk among those who move is uncorrelated with mortality rates in the destination region. Supporting this assumption, we find little correlation between destination mortality rates and movers’ ex ante predicted mortality, which we construct from detailed data on demographic characteristics, past health care utilization, and preexisting chronic conditions. In addition, the estimated relationship between movers’ mortality and destination mortality is highly stable, even with rich controls, including variables that are strongly predictive of mortality. Changes in the local mortality rate experienced by hurricane victims can explain over 70 percent of the long-run mortality decline caused by the hurricane.\n\nNext, we examine how other local attributes correlate with movers’ mortality. We find that movers’ mortality increases with local rates of obesity and smoking and decreases with average income, home values, and urban population share. Movers’ mortality is not statistically significantly correlated with local physician or hospital bed supply or a hospital quality index. We also do not find a relationship between movers’ mortality and local health care spending, shedding new light on a long-standing question of whether higher-spending regions generate better health outcomes than lower-spending regions and pointing to low returns to living in a high-spending region.2\n\nOur study adds to a growing body of literature that uses migration to identify how local conditions affect individual outcomes. Song et al. (2010); Finkelstein, Gentzkow, and Williams (2016); and Molitor (2018) study movers in Medicare to identify local determinants of diagnosis rates, medical spending, and physician practice styles, respectively. Movers have also been used to study how local conditions affect education and earnings (Chetty, Hendren, and Katz 2016; Nakamura, Sigurdsson, and Steinsson 2017; Chyn 2018; Chetty and Hendren 2018a), income reporting in tax filings (Chetty, Friedman, and Saez 2013), and brand preferences (Bronnenberg, Dubé, and Gentzkow 2012). Black et al. (2015) and Johnson and Taylor (2019) estimate mortality effects of migration but do not study how migrant outcomes depend on destination characteristics.\n\nWe contribute to this literature by studying how the long-run mortality outcomes of those displaced by Hurricane Katrina depend on the destination region. Our finding that migrants’ realized mortality outcomes correspond closely to their destination region’s mortality rate suggests that local conditions are an important determinant of individual health outcomes. Our study complements contemporaneous work by Finkelstein, Gentzkow, and Williams (2019), who estimate the mortality effects of place among Medicare movers using a novel method to account for potentially endogenous sorting on unobservables. They also find that current location matters greatly for life expectancy, although the correlation they find between the effect of place on mortality and local mortality is smaller than what we estimate. Because Hurricane Katrina displaced many people who would not have otherwise moved, this pattern suggests that place may matter less for the typical mover than for the typical stayer, analogous to evidence of negative selection on children’s economic gains among movers to better neighborhoods (Chyn 2018).\n\nOur results also shed light on why life expectancy differs across the United States and how health capital accumulates over the life cycle. Regional differences in life expectancy correlate strongly with numerous demographic factors and health behaviors, like income and smoking (Chetty et al. 2016, Dwyer-Lindgren et al. 2017). Our results suggest that geographic variation in life expectancy is at least partly driven by contemporaneous location characteristics and not just by differences in demographics or health behaviors that affect mortality only over long time horizons. In addition, the sharp and enduring decline in the mortality rate of Hurricane Katrina victims contrasts with the canonical Grossman (1972) model of health capital, which posits that health capital changes slowly, although it is consistent with a version of the model in which health capital depreciates rapidly, as may be the case with the elderly and long-term disabled.\n\nWe also provide the longest-run controlled estimates of the mortality effects of a disaster on adult victims. Prior research on disasters and health has been largely limited to considering birth outcomes and infant health (e.g., Torche 2011, Currie and Rossin-Slater 2013, Currie and Schwandt 2016), immediate post-disaster mortality (e.g., Kahn 2005), or survey-based measures of longer-run health for a subset of the victims.3 Survey approaches, however, generally suffer from nonrandom sampling, rarely measure preexisting outcomes, and usually lack a control group. By contrast, our data track the mortality and location of every Medicare-eligible individual. Our finding that Hurricane Katrina reduced long-run mortality among the elderly and long-term disabled populations builds on recent evidence that the hurricane indirectly generated other long-run benefits, including higher earnings among the working-age population (Groen, Kutzbach, and Polivka 2020; Deryugina, Kawano, and Levitt 2018) and improved test scores among displaced students (Sacerdote 2012).\n\nThe paper proceeds as follows. Section I provides an overview of Hurricane Katrina. Section II describes the data and estimation sample. Section III outlines our research design, and Section IV presents the results. Section V concludes.\n\nII. Data and Estimation Sample\n\nA. Data\n\nThe primary data for our analysis are Medicare administrative records for all Medicare beneficiaries from 1992 to 2013 (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 1992–2013). These data offer three key features for studying health dynamics in our setting. First, Medicare covers nearly all US residents aged 65 and older as well as non-elderly individuals who have received Social Security disability benefits for at least 24 months or have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Second, annual beneficiary summary files report the nine-digit beneficiary zip code where Social Security Administration (SSA) benefits and official communication are mailed, which we call the “zip code of residence.” This allows us to identify individuals living in a specific place at a certain time (e.g., New Orleans residents prior to Hurricane Katrina) and to track them over time even if they move.8 Third, Medicare reports exact dates of death based on SSA records.\n\nWe use two sets of annually recorded Medicare variables.9 The first set, which comes from Medicare eligibility files and is available for every Medicare beneficiary, contains beneficiary zip code, race, sex, birth and death dates, cause of death, and ESRD information. Beneficiary zip code is based on a snapshot taken at the end of the year (file years 1999, 2007, and 2009–2013) or in March of the following year (all other file years in the sample). For individuals who die prior to the location snapshot, the zip code reflects their last address on record. Cause of death codes are available only for years 1999–2008.\n\nThe second set of Medicare variables is available only for beneficiaries enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare (over 80 percent of our sample). These variables provide information on medical spending and the presence of chronic conditions from fee-for-service claims. We measure total annual medical spending as the sum of payments due to providers (including hospitals and physicians), excluding payments for Part D drugs. We use Medicare indicators for the presence of 27 common chronic conditions inferred from medical claim histories. In most cases, we group the 27 individual conditions into eight broad categories: heart disease and stroke, respiratory disease, blood and kidney disease, cancer, diabetes, musculoskeletal diseases, Alzheimer’s/dementia, and other. The chronic condition indicators are available only for individuals who are continuously enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare over a condition-specific look-back window (usually two years).\n\nWe use counties as the primary unit of geography for the analysis. In some cases, we consider commuting zones (CZs), which aggregate counties into 709 regions based on work commute patterns in 2000. We refer to a county by the primary city located in the county and use the terms “city” and “county” interchangeably. For New Orleans, a consolidated city-county, the county and city boundaries are identical.\n\nWe obtain several county-level attributes related to public health, the environment, and economic conditions, including average Medicare spending, the number of physicians per capita, smoking and obesity rates, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels, frequency of temperature extremes, the crime rate, local government expenditure, and per-capita income. The construction of these variables is detailed in online Appendix Section A.1.4.\n\nFinally, we match Medicare beneficiaries to more detailed flood and neighborhood income characteristics based on their nine-digit zip code of residence at baseline.10 We use five-meter resolution Hurricane Katrina flood depth data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA 2005). We classify a nine-digit zip code as “flooded” if the average flood depth within a 50-meter radius of the centroid is at least two feet. We define neighborhood income for a nine-digit zip code to be the 2000 Census median income among household heads age 65 or older in the block group in which it falls. A beneficiary is “below median income” if their neighborhood income measure is below the median in New Orleans.\n\nB. Estimation Sample\n\nIdentifying the causal effect of Hurricane Katrina on mortality requires estimating counterfactual mortality outcomes for New Orleans victims. We do so by examining how outcomes evolve among Medicare beneficiaries initially residing in other regions. Our primary control regions are the ten US cities with a population of at least 100,000 chosen by Deryugina, Kawano, and Levitt (2018) to most closely match the median earnings, population growth, and racial composition of New Orleans in 2000–2005: Baltimore, MD; Birmingham, AL; Detroit, MI; Gary, IN; Jackson, MS; Memphis, TN; Newark, NJ; Portsmouth, VA; Richmond, VA; and St. Louis, MO (see online Appendix Figure A.3 for a map). Online Appendix Section A.2.1 reports the robustness of our main results to alternative control groups.\n\nOur preferred estimation sample consists of individuals who were eligible for Medicare in 2004 and whose baseline location is reported as of March 2005, just prior to Hurricane Katrina (the “2004 cohort”). summarizes the baseline (2004) characteristics of this cohort for the 65,457 beneficiaries initially residing in New Orleans (column 1) and the 941,685 beneficiaries from the ten control cities (column 2). Gender composition, age distribution, and claims-based Medicare spending and chronic condition prevalence were similar for the New Orleans and control city groups. Relative to the control group, New Orleans beneficiaries were more likely to be Black (60.5 percent versus 39.2 percent), more likely to live in a below-median income neighborhood (49.9 percent versus 34.8 percent), and less likely to be enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare (68.6 percent versus 92.5 percent). Over half of the New Orleans beneficiaries lived in a nine-digit zip code with two or more feet of flooding caused by Katrina.\n\nTable 1—\n\nNew Orleans (1)Ten control cities (2)New Orleans movers (3)Percent male43.041.941.4Percent black60.539.275.6Age70.171.067.2Percent 65+77.781.269.5Percent 75+40.742.232.9Income for 65+ year-olds in 9-digit zip28,23030,96225,005Percent below median income49.934.855.4Percent who experienced 2+ feet of flooding during Katrina56.50.067.1Percent enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare in 200468.692.569.72004 Medicare spending (fee-for-service only)10,4609,6408,857Percent with end-stage renal disease2.11.72.0Percent with blood and kidney disease46.252.743.6Percent with heart disease and stroke64.869.463.2Percent with diabetes27.428.528.9Percent with musculoskeletal condition28.630.427.0Percent with respiratory disease12.814.012.8Percent with cancer6.88.34.9Percent with Alzheimer’s / dementia12.412.68.5Percent with other chronic condition39.941.138.9Number of individuals65,457941,68526,467\n\nBetween March 2005 and March 2006, 26,467 beneficiaries in the 2004 New Orleans cohort left the New Orleans CZ, a group we call “movers” (see column 3 of ). Relative to the average New Orleans beneficiary, movers were younger, were more likely to be Black, and came from poorer and more heavily flooded neighborhoods. Movers were slightly less likely to have some chronic conditions (e.g., heart disease and cancer) but equally or slightly more likely to have others (e.g., diabetes). New Orleans movers also scattered broadly: the top 20 destination counties accounted for about one-half of all movers, while the other half relocated to counties that each attracted less than 1 percent of the movers (see online Appendix Table A.1).\n\nWe use cohorts based on Medicare eligibility in 1992 and 1999 to assess mortality trends prior to Hurricane Katrina. plots raw annual death rates for the 1999 Medicare cohort, by initial region of residence.11 For example, the 2005 mortality rate for New Orleans is the fraction of beneficiaries who died in 2005 out of those who lived in New Orleans in 1999 (regardless of subsequent moves) and survived through 2004. Mortality rates for the New Orleans cohort are plotted in black, and mortality rates for cohorts from each of the ten control cities are plotted in blue. For comparison to the rest of the United States, light gray lines plot mortality rates for the cohorts initially residing in each CZ except the one containing New Orleans.\n\nreveals one of the key findings we formally estimate below. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, the New Orleans cohort had one of the highest mortality rates in the United States. Cohorts from the ten control cities also generally had high mortality rates that trended similarly to the New Orleans cohort’s mortality in 1999–2004.In 2005, the year of Hurricane Katrina, the New Orleans cohort’s mortality rate increased substantially. But in 2006, mortality among the New Orleans cohort fell to the middle of the mortality rate distribution and remained there through 2013, suggesting that Hurricane Katrina led to a long-run decline in mortality among the New Orleans cohort. This long-run decline is not explained by regression to the mean: in other regional cohorts with high pre-2005 mortality, post-2005 annual mortality rates approximately paralleled those from lower mortality cohorts (online Appendix Figure A.5). As we estimate formally below, the mortality decline also cannot fully be explained by mortality displacement, or harvesting, as would occur if Hurricane Katrina killed individuals who would have died soon anyway."
