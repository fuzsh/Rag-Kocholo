        "text": "Ike Turner Jr. and Tina Turner | Source: Getty Images\n\nTina Turner passed away on May 24, 2023, in her KÃ¼snacht, Switzerland home. She was 83.\n\nThe iconic singer had four sons, two adopted and two biological. Her biological sons, Craig and Ronnie, have both passed on.\n\nHer living children, Ike Turner Jr. and Michael Turner live completely different lives and were not in touch with their mother while she was still alive.\n\nIconic singer Tina Turner passed away peacefully in her home at the age of 83. At the time of her death, she was living in KÃ¼snacht, Switzerland with her husband, Erwin Bach.\n\nBefore her death, the singer suffered several health issues. She was diagnosed with intestinal cancer in 2016, had a kidney transplant in 2017, and suffered from high blood pressure for most of her later life.\n\nTina Turner smiles during the presentation of the music project 'Beyond - Three Voices For Peace' on May 14, 2009 in Zurich, Switzerland. | Source: Getty Images\n\nBorn Anna Mae Bullock on November 26, 1939, in Tennessee, Turner found fame in the late 1960s when she collaborated with Ike Turner in the music scene. After getting married in 1962, they separated in 1976 after years of enduring physical and emotional abuse from her husband.\n\nWith no money to her name, Turner worked hard to make a comeback. By the 1980s, she had one of the biggest comebacks in pop music, bringing the world hit after hit in \"The Best,\" \"Private Dancer,\" and \"What's Love Got To Do With It.\"\n\nFor years, Turner was on top of the game. She was an international superstar, selling over 180 million records, selling out several world tours in the biggest stadiums, and winning a total of 12 Grammy Awards in her lifetime.\n\nA portrait of Tina Turner circa 1985. | Source: Getty Images\n\nIn 2021, Turner was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame a second time for her work as a solo artist. This came 30 years after she was first inducted alongside her ex-husband Ike.\n\nTurner's personal life was as eventful as her career. She gave birth to her first son, Craig Raymond Turner, on August 29, 1958. She shared him with saxophonist Raymond Hill.\n\nLater on, Turner got into a relationship with Ike Turner Sr., and he ended up adopting Craig. Her son died in July 2018 after taking his own life.\n\nThe death was a painful one for Turner. She scattered his ashes in the ocean. She wrote a statement regarding Craig's death, saying: \"He was fifty-nine when he died so tragically, but he will always be my baby.\"\n\nTina Turner, Ike Turner, and their children, Michael, Ike Jr., Ronnie, and Craig Hill. | Source: Getty Images\n\nThe singer never knew why her son struggled. He was working as a real estate agent and was dating a woman whom he was looking forward to introducing to his mother. Ultimately, she felt loneliness was the reason why her son went off the edge.\n\nTina and Ike Sr. welcomed their only son Ronnie Turner on October 27, 1960. The singer was quite open about raising her son in a privileged way, putting him through private school, giving him lavish allowances, and providing him with everything he needs.\n\nUnfortunately, despite everything being given to him, Ronnie was self-destructive. He suffered from substance abuse, and by 1986, Turner had cut him off financially.\n\nTina Turner hugs Shawn Bell, 10, at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital on Friday, Oct. 20, 2000 in Memphis, Tennessee. | Source: Getty Images\n\nRonnie followed in his parents' footsteps in the music industry. He played bass in a band called Manufactured Funk and had a cameo in his parents' biopic \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" in 1993.\n\nRonnie reportedly had two children and got married in March 2007 to a French singer named Afida Turner when he was 46. In December 2022, Ronnie died of colon cancer at the age of 62.\n\nIn the same way, she wrote a tribute to Craig when he died, Turner also wrote Ronnie a tribute a day after he died. \"In sorrow, I close my eyes and think of you. My beloved son,\" she wrote.\n\nHer Adopted Son Became a Superstar\n\nTurner had an adoptive son named Ike Turner Jr. whom her husband Ike Sr. had with a woman named Lorraine Taylor in 1958. He was adopted by Turner when he was a child.\n\nAdmittedly, Ike Jr. once admitted that Turner was \"the only mother I've ever known.\" He followed his parents in the entertainment industry, playing drums and piano as a child.\n\nHe ended up playing every instrument available to him, save for the horn. By the age of 13, he was touring alongside his dad and was out of school. He ran his dad's recording studio and went on tour with him.\n\nRonald Turner, son of Ike and Tina Turner, speaks to the congregation with his wife at his side, during a memorial service for singer and musician Ike Turner on December 21, 2007. | Source: Getty Images\n\nEven after Ike Sr.'s split from Turner, she remained on good terms with her adoptive son. He even briefly worked as her sound engineer despite Ike Sr. wanting them to cut ties.\n\nUnfortunately, by 1985, Ike Jr. lost touch with his mother. At the time, he felt like the singer was neglecting her responsibility as a mother to him and his two brothers, Michael and Ronnie.\n\nBy 2018, he reiterated his sentiments by saying he and Turner had not gotten in contact with each other for over a decade. Talking about her choice to cut ties with him, he said:\n\nâMy mother is living her life â she has a new husband, and she's in Europe. She doesn't want to have anything to do with the past.â\n\nIke Turner (L) and Ike Turner Jr. (R) pose with his Grammy for Best Traditional Blues Album for \"Risin' With The Blues\" in the press room at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards at the Staples Center on February 11, 2007 in Los Angeles, California. | Source: Getty Images\n\nTo date, Ike Jr. continues to make music. He's a Grammy Award-winning artist and recently released a song titled \"Yes To Life\" with singer Sweet Randi Love.\n\nIke Jr. allegedly inherited part of his father's estate when he died in 2007, however, the amount was never disclosed. Ike Sr. didn't have a valid will at the time of his death, which is why a Superior Court Judge ruled that his estate would be shared by his children.\n\nThe ruling was made after two other people claimed to have had a written will in their possession. Ike Sr.'s ex-wife, Audrey Madison Turner, claimed she was the rightful owner of her husband's estate, as he left her with a handwritten will.\n\nLikewise, Ike Sr.'s longtime friend James Clayron also claimed he had a written will from Ike Sr., making him the lone benefactor of the musician's estate. Ultimately, none of them got a share, and both wills were nullified.\n\nIke Turner (L) stands with guest Audrey Madison and Ike Turner Jr. after he was inducted into the Hollywood Rockwalk along with Muddy Waters, Robert Cray, Solomon Burke and Etta James on April 4, 2005 in Hollywood, California. | Source: Getty Images\n\nHer Other Son Went to a Convalescent Home\n\nTurner's other adopted son, Michael Turner, was from Ike Sr.'s relationship with Lorraine Taylor. The singer adopted Michael before she split from Ike.\n\nThe divorce took a toll on Michael, who wanted them to work out their differences and get back together. The gravity of the situation took a toll on his health, and he was often hospitalized.\n\nAs an adult, Michael suffered from substance abuse. At the time, he acknowledged Turner as a woman who would do anything for him, yet he didn't give her a call when he needed it most.\n\nFor illustration purposes only. | Source: Getty Images\n\nMichael clarified what he thought of Tina, yet acknowledged his need for freedom. He was once quoted saying:\n\n\"Tina was really good to me, and I love her, but I can't live with anybody. I [have to be] free to do what I want to do.\"\n\nIn 2017, Ike Jr. reported that his brother was now bound to a wheelchair after suffering several seizures and strokes. A year later, he revealed that Michael was living in a convalescent home in Southern California to get the proper care he needed.\n\nFor illustration purposes only. | Source: Getty Images\n\nMeanwhile, when it came to Turner, she was not able to visit Michael at the convalescent home while she was still alive. Instead, she sent him her support by providing for him financially whenever needed.\n\nWith Turner no longer around, the world is mourning the loss of an iconic woman who endured so much in life only to pick herself back up and start anew.\n\nOn the opening night of the musical at the West End, Turner announced that after everything she had to endure, she finally forgave her ex-husband.\n\nFans were able to get a glimpse of Turner's life through \"Tina â The Tina Turner Musical\" at the West End and a year later, on Broadway.\n\nThe musical on Turner's life has earned a total of 12 Tony nominations, winning one for lead star Adrienne Warren's portrayal of Turner.\n\nOn the opening night of the musical at the West End, Turner announced that after everything she had to endure, she finally forgave her ex-husband. Her announcement was met with loud applause from the audience.\n\nWhile people were glad to hear that Turner had forgiven her late ex-husband, her son claimed that it was too late for that. He said his mother should have forgiven Ike Sr. while he was still alive, the same way he did.\n\nSince 1994, Turner had lived in Switzerland with Erwin Bach, a German music producer who once won her heart. They took their relationship to the next level back in July 2013 when they got married in an intimate celebration.\n\nDespite the health issues Turner faced in her later years, her representative clarified that she died of natural causes. She once tried to end her life through assisted suicide because of the pain she had to endure due to kidney failure, but her husband saved her life.\n\nBach is set to receive half of Turner's estate, which is estimated to be around $250 million. A private funeral ceremony has been planned for the singer's closest family and friends.\n\nIf you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), text \"help\" to the Crisis Text Line at 741-741, or go to suicidepreventionlifeline.org.\n\nncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1nbnBgZ3q1tc2aZK2toqOys3nIrGSsraKrtrexw2aZsmViYsCwutJmpqedXp3Brrg%3D"
