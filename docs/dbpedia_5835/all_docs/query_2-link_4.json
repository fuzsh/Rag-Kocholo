        "text": "Post by Rob Durkee on\n\nBY ROB DURKEE\n\nIke Turner, who was half of the successful duo Ike and Tina Turner plus had a hand in one of the first rock and roll records ever, died early Wednesday, December 12, 2007, at his San Diego Home. He was 76. At press time, there was no cause of death released.\n\nIke And Tina Turner rose to fame in the early 1960's and had 18 Cash Box pop hits from 1960 through 1975, the year after they divorced. Six of their hits made the top 40 and the duo was inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. By far their biggest hit was the #5-peaking \"Proud Mary,\" the remake of the Creedence Clearwater Revival song, in 1971. Ike and Tina Turner also had top 40 hits with \"A Fool In Love\" (#19, 1960), \"It's Gonna Work Out Fine\" (#21, 1961), \"Poor Fool\" (#23, 1961), \"Ooh Poo Pah Doo\" (#37, 1971) and \"Nutbush City Limits\" (#26, 1973). The duo also had a dynamite remake of the Beatles' \"Get Back.\"\n\nOver the years, many people thought \"It's Gonna Work Out Fine\" included talk by Ike Turner but that wasn't the case. Instead, the man people thought was Ike Turner doing the talking was actually Mickey Baker of the duo Mickey and Sylvia.\n\nIke Turner was part of what's believed to have been one of the first rock and roll records ever, 1951's \"Rocket 88.\" Jackie Brenston has been credited as the artist on the record, believed to be the first to feature a distorted guitar courtesy of guitarist Willie Kizart. Sometimes the song's been credited as being by Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats but no such group existed. Turner played piano on the record and has been credited by many sources as the writer of \"Rocket 88.\" Sam Phillips of Sun Records, who sold Elvis Presley's contract to RCA Records, produced \"Rocket 88.\" Ike's piano riff on \"Rocket 88\" was used note for note in the intro to Little Richard's \"Good Golly Miss Molly.\"\n\nIke Turner met Tina, who was born Anna Mae Bullock, in 1959 and they eventually married. About 10 years after their divorce, Tina Turner exploded back onto the pop scene with a solo career starting in 1984. She had two #1's with \"Typical Male\" and \"What's Love Got To Do With It.\" The latter song title would become the title of an autobiographical movie dealing with Ike's alleged abuse of Tina. However, Ike has denied the abuse allegations and expressed his frustration over his contributions to music being overshadowed by the abuse allegations. \"You can go ask Snoop Dogg or Eminem, you can go ask the Rolling Stones or (Eric) Clapton, or you can ask anybody--anybody. They all know my contribution to music, but it hasn't been in print what I've done or what I've contributed until now,\" he said in a 2001 interview with the Associated Press.\n\nDrug problems also plagued Turner's life. In 1989, he spent 17 months in jail. \"I can't say I'm proud that I did drugs,\" Turner confessed, \"but I'm glad I'm still alive to convey how I came through. I used to pray with God, saying 'Give me three days clean and I'll never look back.' But I never did get to three days. You know why? Because I'd lie to myself. And then only when I went to jail, did I get those three days. And, man, I haven't looked back since then.\"\n\nTurner, who was married 13 times, also suffered from emphysema in his later years.\n\nIke Turner was also known for a flop record and a group named after him. In 1966, Ike and Turner released a Phil Spector-produced single, \"River Deep, Mountain High.\" The record was promoted heavily and was chock full of Spector's unique wall of sound. However, the record buying public didn't respond accordingly and the single never made the Cash Box singles chart. Meanwhile, the duo's backup group emerged in late 1961 with the #16 hit, \"I'm Blue (The Gong Gong Song)\"...and the Ikettes were named after Ike.\n\nIke Turner won a grammy earlier this year in the traditional blues album category for his LP \"Risin' With The Blues.\""
