        "text": "Tina Turner’s husband is set to inherit nearly half her estimated $250 million fortune.\n\nThe ‘What’s Love Got to Do With It’ singer married music producer Erwin Bach, 67, a decade ago after a 27-year romance, and he donated a kidney to her to save her life in 2017 and supported her through her other health woes including her 2013 stroke just before they married.\n\nTina’s singer daughter-in-law Afida, 46, who is the widow of her late son Ronnie, told the Sunday Mirror about how the star’s wealth was likely to be split: “As she married in Switzerland, I think around 47 per cent will go to the spouse and the rest to the children.”\n\nAfida Turner was married to Ronnie in 2007 until his death in 2022 aged 62 from complications linked to colon cancer.\n\nTina also adopted two of her abusive husband Ike Turner’s sons, and son named Craig from a previous relationship with musician Raymond Hill, when she was 18.\n\nCraig died by suicide in 2018, which Tina described as her “saddest moment as a mother”.\n\nAfida added about how the family set-up may lead to complications over how her estate is split: “Tina’s two children are Craig and Ronnie – she never adopted Ike Jr.\n\n“It’s just because she was with Ike that they were in the family, so the only ‘blood’ descendants are Craig and Ronnie.\n\n“Today I’m the only one with the name – there are no other Turners.”\n\nAfida stressed she wasn’t thinking about Tina’s money, adding: “I’m not here for that. I'm here to respect my mother-in-law.\n\n“I’ve always earned my own money – no one has ever given me anything in the Turner family – that’s the Turner way, OK.”\n\nTina’s final fortune of $250 million, estimated by Celebrity Net Worth, didn’t only come from her stream of hits including ‘What’s Love Got to do With It’ and ‘We Don’t Need Another Hero’.\n\nShe also starred in films such as ‘Tommy’, Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome’, and ‘Last Action Hero’, while her 1993 biopic ‘What’s Love Got to Do With It’ told the story of her path to success and battle to hold onto her stage name during her painful divorce from her abusive ex-husband Ike Turner, who died in 2010 aged 76 after subjecting her to beatings and sex she said felt more like rape.\n\nShe sold her image and music rights to BMG two years before her death in a deal thought to have been worth $50 million, and died in her $76 million Swiss retreat."
