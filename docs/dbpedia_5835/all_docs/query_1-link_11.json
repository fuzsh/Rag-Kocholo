        "text": "An accidental cocaine overdose killed the blues legend Ike Turner in his California home last month, authorities have concluded.\n\nTurner, 76, also had hypertensive cardiovascular disease and pulmonary emphysema, but it was the cocaine that caused his death, the San Diego County medical examiner's office said yesterday.\n\n\"We are listing that he abused cocaine, and that's what resulted in the cocaine toxicity,\" Paul Parker, the chief investigator at the medical examiner's office, told the Associated Press.\n\nTurner's death was ruled accidental, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported, citing sources from the medical examiner's office. No illegal substances were discovered in Turner's home but investigators did find drug paraphernalia, the paper said.\n\nTurner, who was known as much his brutality towards his former partner Tina Turner as for his music, had a long history of drug abuse.\n\nThe Mississippi-born son of a preacher claimed to journalists that it was during long tours that he had started using drugs.\n\nWith Tina, he had a series of hits in the 1960s and 70s, including River Deep Mountain High, Proud Mary and I Want to Take You Higher.\n\nThe couple split in 1976, with Tina later saying he had hit her and burned her with cigarettes.\n\nTurner never admitted the abuse, except to argue: \"There have been times when I punched her to the ground without thinking. But I never beat her.\"\n\nHis career declined after the break-up, and he was in jail on weapons and drugs charges when he and Tina were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991.\n\nHe returned to the road in 1993 after his release, and enjoyed a revival in 2001 when he released the Grammy-nominated album Here and Now. He also won a Grammy last year for Risin' with the Blues, which was named best traditional blues album.\n\nTurner's former spokesman was not immediately available for comment."
