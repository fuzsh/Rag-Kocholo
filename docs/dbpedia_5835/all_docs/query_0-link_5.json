Emergency services received a 911 call, possibly from Ronnie’s wife, Feda, Thursday morning, who reported that Ronnie was having difficulty breathing just outside their home and asked them to rush there.

His mother hasn’t given any response to his passing yet. Ronnie had put his name in Hollywood acting in the 1993 movie ‘What’s Love Got to Do With It’ in which he co-starred with his mother. Ronnie was born to Tina and Ike in 1960. Tina’s eldest son Craig with musician Raymond Hill was a realtor and committed suicide in 2018 by shooting himself in his Studio City home.\n\nTina had two more children with Ike, Ike Jr and Mike. The couple separated in 1976 after Tina accused Ike of hitting her. Ike later died from a heroin overdose in 2007. Tina had given birth to Craig before meeting Ike but later adopted him when she married. Her first son with Ike was Ronnie. Ronnie lived in his Los Angeles home with his wife, Feda and had battled with cancer for a long time.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWho is Ronnie Turner?\n\nRonnie Turner was the son of popular actress-singer Tina Turner and her husband, Ike Turner.\n\nHow did Tina Turner’s eldest son die?\n\nCraig, Tina’s eldest son, committed suicide in 2018 by shooting himself.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by an external agency.
