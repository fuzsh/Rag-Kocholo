At 6:30 a.m. the following morning, the Big Cypress helicopter began searching for Thornbury along the preserve's north boundary from Highway 41 to I-75, an area containing numerous hunting camps and criss-crossed by airboat trails employed by hunters to get from the reservation into the preserve. While this effort was underway, Miccosukee searchers found D.T.'s body. No further details are currently available on the incident, but a supplementary report is to follow. [Carl Davis, BICY, via telefax from Steve Alscher, LES, RAD/SERO, 10/28]\n\nWednesday, October 30, 1991\n\n91-586 - Big Cypress (Florida) - Follow-up on Search\n\nD.D.T., the Miccosukee police officer whose body was found on lands adjacent to the park on October 28th, apparently from accidental drowning early that morning. Searchers found his swamped police airboat in a flooded borrow pit adjacent to I-75. Rangers aboard an NPS helicopter participated in the search along with aircraft and ground searchers from the Broward and Metro-Dade sheriff's departments, U.S. Customs, Florida Game and Fish Commission, the Coast Guard and a Miami TV station.\n\nMonday, December 2, 1991\n\n91-636 - Big Cypress (Florida) - Rescue\n\nAround 4:30 p.m. on November 29th, S.C., 18, and R.A., 43, both of Miami, were hunting in the park's Loop Unit when R.A. mistook S.C. for a game animal and accidentally shot him in the back with #4 shotgun pellets from a range of 50 feet. R.A. ran three and a half miles to Highway 41 to get help. He contacted a ranger there at 6:20 p.m.; the ranger then notified local law enforcement, EMS and air rescue agencies. Since the hour was late, an air rescue unit from Metro Dade was also summoned. Severe weather soon closed in on the area and the first air rescue unit canceled its mission. The Metro Dade helicopter continued to the Oasis ranger station and landed there with the assistance of rangers, who set up ground lighting. The Metro Dade unit declined to fly further, however, due to further worsening of the weather. When the crew learned that it would take five hours to walk in, retrieve S.C., then carry him out, they reversed that decision and decided to make an attempt to reach him. Ranger D.B. Wangerin joined the crew on the flight in. They found S.C. within 15 minutes, but lost him while attempting to find a place to land. After touching down, Wangerin and a crew member searched for S.C. while the crew kept the engines running so that the helicopter wouldn't sink in the mud. S.C. was soon found and brought back to the helicopter, which by this time was running low on fuel. The pilot called for a ground crew with emergency lights and asked them to set up at Oasis. The helicopter lifted off just after 8:30 and immediately flew into total white-out conditions. The pilot brought the helicopter down to tree-top level in his efforts to find Oasis, but was unsuccessful. A subsequent attempt to find a nearby jetport was also fruitless. Just as both engine fuel warning lights came on, the crew spotted a clearing near the visitor center and residential area in Shark Valley in Everglades and the pilot was able to land without incident. Fuel trucks were summoned and topped off the helicopter's tanks. The helicopter then flew to a nearby hospital, where S.C. was admitted. At the time of the report yesterday, S.C. was in critical condition.

Suicide is suspected, and the sheriff's office is handling the follow-up investigation. The building in which E.C. was found is a structure which the park acquired and is planning to tear down.

Subsequent investigation revealed that they were involved in collecting animals for the commercial market and that the animals had a commercial value of about $350,000. Rangers also seized a large number of reptiles and amphibians, a small quantity of drugs, videotapes depicting collection activities, log books and maps showing collection sites, and paraphernalia associated with reptile collecting. On February 19th, N.W. of Traverse City, Michigan, who had previously pleaded guilty to violating the Lacey Act, was sentenced to three years' probation, with a special condition that he serve six months in a community control facility. He must also complete 100 hours of community service at Sleeping Bear Dunes, and was ordered to pay $1,000 to the federal asset forfeiture fund. Three other defendants in the case - S.G., co-owner of Great Northern Reptiles, D.S. and S.E. - were sentenced on the same charges last September: S.G. to six months in a community control facility and 300 hours of community service; D.S. to three years probation and 300 hours of community service; S.E. to three years probation and 200 hours of community service. Garvin also forfeited a 1981 Ford station wagon; Schneider and Eisele each S.G. $7,500. Last July, T.B., another co-defendant, was sentenced on a misdemeanor violation of the Lacey Act to two years probation, a cash forfeiture, and the forfeiture of items seized by the rangers at the time of his arrest. The cases were jointly investigated by the NPS, U.S. Fish and Wildlife, and the Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission. [Naples Daily News article, sent via telefax by Bill Carroll, CR, BICY, 2/26]\n\nMonday, July 13, 1992\n\n92-327 - Everglades and Big Cypress (Florida) - Cocaine Seizure\n\nA twin-engine Piper Aerostar dropped ten bales of cocaine into the norther portion of the park while being pursued by Customs aircraft on the afternoon of July 1st. Radar observers had spotted the Aerostar flying from the Bahamas toward the eastern United States at an extremely low altitude, and Customs had dispatched a Blackhawk helicopter and a Citation fixed-wing aircraft to pursue the plane. They trailed it across the park to a remote landing strip, at which point confederates on the ground apparently notified the Aerostar's crew that they were being followed. The plane turned and flew back across the park, dumping bales of cocaine as it went. One bale fell in Big Cypress and ten more landed in Everglades. Everglades and Big Cypress rangers worked the access points into the glades, contacting people from their airboats, while Customs agents recovered the cocaine using their helicopters. The pilot and his passenger were arrested when the plane landed at Homestead General Airport on the east boundary of Everglades. Prior to landing, all of the bales were dropped from the plane; one struck a church in Homestead, while another landed at a location where the Homestead police chief was speaking at a neighborhood crime watch meeting. The bales, which weighed about 65 pounds each, were valued at $2.5 million each. The total value of the cocaine seized on NPS lands was placed at about $27.5 million.

Here are highlights of activities which are either in the works or undertaken or completed over the last 72 hours:\n\n* The maintenance teams which arrived late last week have been re-roofing structures (both residences and park buildings), clearing roads and working on related activities. All structures in Big Cypress have now been stabilized.\n\n* The receiving and distribution center which has been set up at Oasis Ranger Station in Big Cypress has so far processed 25 tons of supplies and materials and distributed them to work sites.\n\n* A contract for underground installation of power lines from the east entrance of Everglades to Flamingo will likely be signed today. Construction is scheduled to begin tomorrow.\n\n* The Service's housing coordinator is on scene to assess the employee housing situation and develop alternatives for both temporarily housing displaced employees and rebuilding permanent quarters.\n\n* Denver Service Center's facilities assessment team leader is on-site and setting up for the full team's arrival on Wednesday.\n\n* The resource assessment team leader will arrive on Thursday, and the full team should be on scene and in the field by Monday.\n\n* Flamingo is now fully operational. TW Services, the concessioner, is housing displaced families and ARM team members in the lodge, feeding 300 people on a daily basis, providing laundry services, and offering some recreational activities (such as movies) for residents and other employees. More families from Homestead will be moving into lodge because of condemnation of their residences.\n\n* Particular attention is being paid to park documents, which are beginning to mold. Efforts are underway to increase dehumidification of the Beard Center, which houses these documents, and a contractor has begun freeze- drying some materials to restore them. Documents from Biscayne are also being moved to this location and treated.\n\n* Everglades and Biscayne remain closed.

Entitlement to overtime for travel is based upon whether the event causing the travel is unscheduled or administratively uncontrollable. The event (Hurricane Andrew) clearly fits the criteria.

NPS rangers and investigators detailed to the case reviewed documents, maps and photographs seized during the investigation and found documentation of illegal forays into Everglades, Big Cypress, Ding Darling NWR, and other protected public areas. Statute of limitation and dual prosecution considerations led the U.S. attorney's office to recommend against federal prosecution and agree to a cooperative effort with the state. D.P.W. was sentenced to two years' community control (house arrest), three years' probation, and 300 hours of community service; he was also required to pay $3,500 in restitution. H., 75, P.S., 41, and R.W., 44, received similar but lesser sentences in earlier pleas. Agreements with the state attorney's office will allow NPS acquisition of forfeited evidence documents for use in an intelligence database and training programs.

The closure affects the general gun season, which is traditionally the most popular season for south Florida hunters. The park's remaining four management units are still open to hunting. High water levels continue to stress animal populations by concentrating animals on limited high ground, reducing or eliminating forage, and dispersing animals from their normal home ranges.

Everglades received an initial request for a helicopter from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), but a local aircraft operator was able to fill the request. On the morning of May 12th, an interagency meeting was held to coordinate response to the accident. The Florida Freshwater Fish and Game Commission asked the NPS for airboats and operators to help with the transportation of personnel to and from the crash site. Everglades provided two airboats with three operators; Big Cypress provided another two airboats with two operators. The commission expressed its thanks, as its personnel had been on duty at the site for over 24 hours. Park employees were to remain on duty at the site until 6 a.m. this morning, then be replaced by commission employees. No further requests for NPS assistance have been received, but the parks are standing by to help as needed. The communications center at Everglades, which serves the south Florida parks, has been coordinating communications and resource orders for both parks. Calls requesting information about the crash and its impacts on the Everglades environment have been coming in from as far away as Australia.

The two walked to a nearby canal to wash their hands. Accompanying them was their dog, N., a 90-pound yellow lab. While at the edge of the canal, a 12- to 13-foot alligator came on shore and grabbed the dog. The M.W.s tried to scare it into letting the dog go, but it ignored them and killed the lab. M.W. felt that the gator attacked the dog rather than his son only because the dog got to the canal first. Alligators can become habituated when fed by people, and there was a trash can which may have contained food nearby. The can has been relocated and signs warning visitors to beware of gators have been placed in the area.

Around 1:50 a.m. the following morning, they spotted two men attempting to leave the park on an ATV with a four-point deer in their possession. After they parked the ATV about 100 feet from the road in dense vegetation, one of the two men walked out to the road and was arrested. The rangers then told the second man to stay where he was, but he instead attempted to flee on the ATV. The rangers approached him after the ATV got stuck after traveling only a few feet. As they did so, the man grabbed a rifle, pointed it at one of the rangers, and attempted to work the firing mechanism.

A man in a white Cadillac had driven through the area that morning and had made belligerent comments toward another resident. The caller also identified the driver of the Cadillac as having been in Looneyville in March, at which time he'd been shooting a weapon and had been \"extremely confrontational and belligerent.\" Rangers Eduardo Echeverria, Tom Berg and Dane Tantay and two state game officers contacted the two occupants of the Cadillac, who were fishing west of Fisher camp. Echeverria approached one of the two men, later identified as L.F. L.F. put his fishing pole down as Echeverria approached; as he turned toward the ranger, Echeverria saw that he had a weapon holstered on his right side. Echeverria ordered him not to touch it, but L.F. placed his right hand on the gun and used his left hand to release the safety latch on the black holster. Echeverria again ordered him not to touch the weapon, but L.F. ignored him and drew it out. Echeverria grabbed the gun - a .22 caliber semi-automatic pistol - and pulled it away from L.F.. It had one round in its chamber and another eight in its magazine. L.F. said that he'd only brought he gun to defend himself \"in case I get shot at because some of these people are wild out here.\" L.F. was arrested for disorderly conduct and interfering with an agency function. Further investigation led to the discovery that L.F. had stopped two other men earlier that day and had told them that he'd hunted in the area for years, that no one would stop him from doing so, and \"that if anyone such as a law enforcement officer tried, he would be looking at the wrong end of L.F.'s pistol.\" [Eduardo Echeverria, PR, BICY, 4/4]\n\nFriday, August 25, 2000\n\n00-506 - Caribbean/South Florida Areas - Follow-up on Hurricane Debby\n\nHurricane Debby has largely dissipated and no longer presents a threat to any NPS areas.

To begin the implementation of this process, the Park Facilities Management Division has brought the Service's national Type I incident management team (Skip Brooks, IC) to Washington to begin a comprehensive condition assessment program for the Service. The team is operating under a delegation of authority signed by Dick Ring, the associate director for park operations and education. As of now, plans are to conduct the assessment at six pilot parks this year - Redwood N&SP, Santa Monica NRA, Effigy Mounds NM, Fort Caroline NM, Timucuan E&HP, and Big Cypress NP. The team is employing subject matter experts from these parks and throughout the Service to carry out this effort. At some point, the program will be expanded to 30 parks or more. Once complete, the program will be reviewed and validated by an impartial, independent organization so that the public and the Congress can have confidence that the information is accurate.

The helicopter then crashed into trees in the very rugged Western Raccoon Point area of the park. J.K. called his wife via cell phone and told her that he'd crashed and that he thought he'd suffered a back injury and possibly some broken ribs. The signal was then lost. His location was given to authorities alternatively as either 60 miles southeast or 60 miles east of the regional airport at Fort Meyers. Searchers from Lee County initially looked to the east of the airport, and park staff were not involved. Just before 8 a.m., however, the Broward County Sheriff's Office called the park and asked for a search of Big Cypress. ICS was put into effect and the Collier County Sheriff's Office was asked to assist. When the park's helicopter became airborne, the crew discovered that there were already many aircraft searching the area, none of whom had checked in through the incident management team. Attempts to establish command and control of search aircraft proved fruitless. A spotter in a Collier County SO helicopter located the downed McDonnell Douglas around noon. When the park's helicopter arrived, there were eight helicopters circling or hovering at various altitudes in the area. The park helicopter landed in an area of short cypress trees; a park EMT, a fire and aviation ranger and a Collier County lieutenant then hiked about a half mile through dense cypress and standing water to the crash site. They found that J.K. wasn't with the helicopter. A hasty search of the area was conducted, but no sign of J.K. was found. Utilizing a series of radio relays, helicopters in the area were asked by the NPS on-scene commander to spiral out from the crash site to search for J.K., presuming him to be either on foot or down. Within 30 minutes, he was found about two miles north of the crash site, attempting to walk out. He was flown to Lee County Memorial Hospital, where he was treated and released. After the operation concluded, park staff learned that a Miami-Dade County rescue helicopter had heli-rappelled officers into the scene prior to the arrival of the park helicopter. When they found that the pilot was gone, they left the area, neglecting to inform the incident management team that they'd been there. The park and Collier County SO will jointly host a meeting with involved rescuers to discuss the use of ICS in joint operations.\n\n[Submitted by Ed Clark, Chief Ranger]\n\nThursday, September 02, 2004\n\nFlorida Parks\n\nPreparations For Frances Accelerate\n\nHurricane Frances is now forecast to hit Florida hard on Saturday morning, and those in its way are getting ready:\n\nBig Cypress NP  The park began shutting down yesterday in anticipation of Hurricane Frances' arrival. Preparations were completed yesterday afternoon, thereby making it possible to release employees to take care of their home preparations today and early tomorrow. It's already impossible to find a hotel room in Naples, as residents from Florida's east coast seek places of refuge. The recent experience of Hurricane Charley has everyone sensitive to the possibility of a hit from a major tropical storm.

Reports on those impacts appear below. As a member of the federal interagency wildland fire community, however, NPS employees are among those responding to the larger impacts of the hurricane on residents of Florida. An area command team and six Type 1 incident management teams have been committed to assist FEMA with disaster relief and the operation of receiving and distribution centers, base camps and logistics staging areas for essential supplies. Also committed (as of Tuesday morning) are eleven helicopters and four buying teams.

These cases involved a total of 42 suspects and resulted in the confiscation of 3,494 pounds of berries. The suspects were typically Hispanic migrant farm workers who were paid anywhere from $.50 to $1.00 per pound for the berries by wholesale buyers. Investigators identified a number of buyers at a farmers market in Immokalee, Florida, about 35 miles from the park. Migrants are supposed to pick the berries on private property with permission of the owner, and the buyers insist they have no control over where the pickers find the berries. In an effort to prevent further depredations, rangers met with the local Collier County Sheriff's Office commander and made contact with all wholesale buyers at the farmers market. Each was provided with a map of the park and advised in Spanish that both the park and the nearby Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge, Picayune Strand State Forest, and Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve are off-limits to collecting. Press releases will also be prepared and sent out to Hispanic media in the area, timed for publication just prior to the next harvest season. The saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) is endemic to the southeastern United States and is both ecologically and economically important. The plant occurs as under story in poorly-drained pine flatwoods, well-drained scrubby flatwoods and in sand pine scrub. The berries, while in season, are a major source of food for black bears and other animals. For centuries, the aborigines of Florida used the berries as a staple food item and as a healing herb. In 1898, doctor Edwin Hale published a book titled Saw Palmetto in which he described the medicinal value of the plant for relief of prostate gland swelling and various aphrodisiac qualities. Today it is reputed to be the leading seller of natural prostate remedies.

There is still water flowing over the Loop Road. The road is partially open and a contract is being developed for its complete clean-up. Access within the park is by swamp buggy and other off-road vehicles. Significant tree hazards within the park will require special handling. Security fencing at Monroe Station is being installed, as this facility sustained significant damage. Crews are working on wayside and campground debris removal and clean-up. Special handling methods need to be employed to prevent the spread of invasive plants. Safety hazards include poison wood, poison ivy, poisonous snakes, poison spiders and alligators.
