        "text": "'Physical strength in a woman - that’s what I am.’\n\nTina Turner\n\nThe death at the age of 83 of the legendary singer Tina Turner earlier this year prompted me to look back on her life and work. And so I watched ‘Tina’ the documentary (2021, directed by Daniel Lindsay and TJ Martin) and ‘Tina’ the musical (2018, directed by Phylidda Lloyd, at the Aldwych Theatre, London). Both were compelling commemorations of her luminous talent and indomitable spirit.\n\n'My legacy is that I stayed on course… from the beginning to the end, because I believed in something inside of me.’\n\nTurner shakes and shimmies, struts and stomps. She twists, jives and kicks her long legs to one side. She clenches her fists and claps her hands; implores us, pleads with us. She is both spiritual and sensual; tenacious and triumphant. Resplendent in red split skirts and sparkling silver mini-dresses; rejoicing in denim jumpsuits and leather leotards; glorying in knee-high boots, big belts and big hair - with a beaming smile and a full-throated roar, she celebrates what it is to be alive.\n\n'I’m self-made. I always wanted to make myself a better person, because I was not educated. But that was my dream—to have class.’\n\nTurner’s success was hard won. She had to prevail over poverty, racism, sexism and ageism. Above all she had to overcome a wretched, abusive relationship. She teaches us a good deal about survival and strength of character.\n\n‘My ex-husband was a physically violent man. I went through basic torture… I was living a life of death. I didn’t exist. But I survived it. And when I walked out, I walked and I didn’t look back.’\n\nAnna Mae Bullock was born in 1939 into a sharecropping family in rural Tennessee. As a child she started singing in the choir at her local Baptist church. She discovered she had a remarkable voice.\n\n‘When you’re in the South there’s nothing happening except the church, the piano, the preacher.’\n\nWhen she was 11 Anna Mae’s mother left without warning for St. Louis in order to escape her violent husband. Two years later he moved to Detroit with another woman. Anna Mae, feeling unloved and isolated, was cared for by her strict grandmother.\n\n‘I didn’t think that I would actually achieve [success as a performer] because first I wasn’t pretty, and I didn’t have the clothes, and I didn’t have the means.’\n\nAt 16 Anna Mae rejoined her mother in St. Louis, where in 1956 she met Ike Turner, a talented musician whose 1951 recording ‘Rocket 88’ is considered by many to have been the first rock’n’roll song. That track was carelessly credited to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, and so began Ike’s lifelong sense of injustice.\n\n'Oh, there's something on my mind.\n\nWon't somebody please, please tell me what's wrong?\n\nYou're just a fool, you know you're in love.\n\nYou've got to face it to live in this world.\n\nYou take the good along with the bad.\n\nSometimes you're happy, and sometimes you're sad.\n\nYou know you love him, you can't understand.\n\nWhy he treats you like he do, when he's such a good man.’\n\n'A Fool in Love’ (I Turner)\n\nDuring the intermission in one of Ike’s concerts, Anna Mae grabbed the microphone and sang. He immediately recognised her talent and enlisted her to his band.\n\n‘I was playing these two roles… Rings all over my fingers and bareback shoes with seams in my stockings. And then on Monday morning I was headed for school.’\n\nAnna Mae had undoubted star quality, and Ike subsequently recast his outfit as the Ike and Tina Turner Revue – without consulting her. Perhaps this was the first indication that he had a sinister, controlling side. But she was young, in awe and in love. She accepted the name change and they got married.\n\n‘I promised him that I wouldn’t leave him. In those days a promise was a promise.’\n\nBefore too long Tina realised she was in a toxic relationship. Ike was unfaithful, controlling, violent and abusive. He was also addicted and paranoid, and he gave her no financial independence.\n\nAnd yet she couldn’t bring herself to leave him.\n\n‘I felt obligated to stay there and I was afraid. And I stayed. This was just how it was. I felt very loyal to Ike and I didn’t want to hurt him. And sometimes after he beat me up, I ended up feeling sorry for him.’\n\nThrough the early 1960s Ike and Tina Turner had a string of R&B hits and toured extensively. Featuring Tina’s mesmerising singing, a tight band and the well-drilled, high-tempo dancing of backing vocalists the Ikettes, they presented an electrifying stage act.\n\nIn 1965 the band caught the eye of renowned music producer Phil Spector. Sidelining Ike from the recording sessions, he recorded Tina performing ‘River Deep – Mountain High’, a stunning expression of his ‘Wall of Sound’ technique.\n\n‘That was a freedom that I didn’t have. Like a bird that gets out of a cage. I was excited about singing a different type of song. I was excited about getting out of the studio on my own. It was a freedom to do something different.’\n\nThe single was a smash overseas, but failed to make an impression on the US pop charts. The quest for mainstream success continued.\n\n‘When I was a little girl, I had a rag doll.\n\nIt was the only doll that I've ever owned.\n\nNow I love you just the way I loved that rag doll,\n\nBut only now my love has grown.\n\nAnd it gets stronger in every way.\n\nAnd it gets deeper, let me say\n\nThen it gets higher, day by day.\n\nAnd do I love you, my oh my.\n\nRiver deep, mountain high.\n\nIf I ever lost you would I cry.\n\nOh, how I love you baby.'\n\n'River Deep, Mountain High’ (E Greenwich / J Barry / P Spector)\n\nAt long last, in the early 1970s, after relentless touring and countless TV appearances, Ike and Tina Turner achieved crossover pop hits in the US - with 'Proud Mary' and 'Nutbush City Limits'. But Tina was increasingly unhappy.\n\n‘I was insanely afraid of that man.’\n\nWhen she wasn’t performing she found herself confined to the family home in LA where she was raising four children. Ike became more controlling, bad tempered and violent. On one occasion Tina took a whole bottle of sleeping pills in an attempt to end it all.\n\n‘Maybe I was brainwashed. I was afraid of him and I cared what happened to him and I knew that if I left there was no one to sing. So I was caught up in guilt and fear.’\n\nFinally, introduced to Buddhism, she developed the mental strength to make a break.\n\n‘Buddhism was a way out and it changed your attitude towards the situation that you’re in... So I started seeing my life. I started seeing that I had to make a change.’\n\nTina’s relationship with Ike had endured for 16 years. But in 1976, after the couple had a violent argument on their way to their hotel in Dallas, she fled with only 36 cents and a Mobil gas card in her pocket.\n\n‘I walked across the freeway to the Ramada Inn. I was very proud. I mean I felt like…I felt strong.’\n\nTina’s short walk across that busy, dangerous freeway late at night represented a massive act of fortitude and defiance. She filed for divorce the same month and it was finalized in 1978. She was left with no money, no house, no car and no claim on royalties. She just wanted to be free. All she demanded was that she retain the Tina Turner name.\n\n‘Actually there is something that he has that I want… That is when I realised that I could use Tina to become a business.’\n\nHard times followed. Tina was burdened with the bills for cancelled shows and found herself performing in Vegas and at sales conventions; in hotel ballrooms and on any TV show that would have her.\n\n‘I was becoming stagnant. I knew that there was something else. And I realised I wasn’t going anywhere. I’d be in Las Vegas all my life.’\n\nTina’s luck changed in 1979 when she met Roger Davies, manager of Olivia Newton-John. He saw that, behind what had become a disco and nostalgia act, there was still a phenomenal talent. She pitched her vision for a new chapter in her career.\n\n‘I had a dream. My dream is to be the first Black rock’n’roll singer to pack places like the Stones.’\n\nReasoning that the US’s schism between R’n’B and rock radio stations presented too great a barrier to realising Tina’s ambition, Davies took her to the UK. There, in two weeks, she recorded a collection of pop and rock songs with four different production teams, including Martyn Ware of Heaven 17 and Rupert Hine. Tina was at first reluctant to take on one proposed track that had previously been recorded by Bucks Fizz. Finally she relented and ‘What's Love Got to Do with It’ became the album’s standout single.\n\nThe resultant ‘Private Dancer’ album, released in 1984, was a runaway success. Certified five times platinum in the United States, it sold 10 million copies worldwide, and the following year Tina won three Grammys.\n\n‘I didn’t consider it a comeback album. Tina had never arrived. It was Tina’s debut for the first time. That was my first album.’\n\n'You must understand, though the touch of your hand makes my pulse react,\n\nThat it's only the thrill of boy meeting girl, opposites attract.\n\nIt's physical.\n\nOnly logical.\n\nYou must try to ignore that it means more than that.\n\nWhat's love got to do, got to do with it?\n\nWhat's love, but a second-hand emotion?\n\nWhat's love got to do, got to do with it?\n\nWho needs a heart when a heart can be broken?\n\n'What's Love Got to Do with It’ (T Britten / G Lyle)\n\nTina continued recording, touring and scoring hits for her adoring fan-base. In 1988 she performed in front of 180,000 in Rio de Janeiro, setting a record for the largest paying concert attendance for a solo artist. She had achieved her dream of becoming the Queen of Rock’n’Roll.\n\n‘I will receive it when I’ve earned it.’\n\nIn the years after her divorce from Ike, Tina was constantly asked about the split. In a 1981 interview with People Magazine she reluctantly revealed the facts of the domestic abuse in order to put the whole story behind her. But the questions kept coming.\n\nWhen in 1993 a movie of her life story, ‘What’s Love Got to Do With It’ (starring Angela Bassett), was released, Tina couldn’t watch it. At the Venice Film Festival she explained:\n\n‘I’m not so thrilled about thinking about the past and how I lived my life…The story was actually written so that I would no longer have to discuss the issue. I don’t love that it’s always talked about. You see, I made a point of just putting the news out to stop the thing, so that I could go on with my life. And this constant reminder is not so good and I’m not so happy about it. So, do I want to sit with a screen and watch all the violence and brutality? No… That’s why I haven’t seen it.’\n\nBy shining a light on her experience of domestic abuse, Tina helped a vast number of women all over the world. And she illustrated the complex emotions playing out in victims and survivors. In time Tina was happily remarried and found peace.\n\n‘At a certain stage forgiveness takes over. Forgiveness means not to hold on. You let it go.’\n\nAs Tina’s mother, with whom she had a difficult relationship, observed, she was fundamentally a courageous, independent spirit.\n\n‘Some people [are] afraid to climb a ladder unless someone’s holding it. But she’s not. Once she’s made that first step on that ladder, she’s climbing… up, up, up.’\n\nAt the heart of Tina’s extraordinary triumphant story was huge personal resilience. We should all aspire to her strength of character.\n\n'I didn’t have anybody really, no foundation in life, so I had to make my own way. Always, from the start. I had to go out in the world and become strong, to discover my mission in life.'\n\n'Left a good job down in the city,\n\nWorking for the man every night and day.\n\nAnd I never lost one minute of sleeping,\n\nI was worrying about the way that things might've been.\n\nBig wheel keep on turning,\n\nProud Mary keep on burning,\n\nAnd we're rolling, rolling,\n\nRolling on the river.’\n\n‘Proud Mary’ (J Fogerty)\n\nNo. 448\n\n‘I’m not gonna stop. I was there. I’m still here. I’m a living witness.’\n\nI recently attended a performance by 82-year-old Mavis Staples, lead vocalist of the legendary Staple Singers. I followed this up by watching a moving documentary about her life and career: ‘Mavis!’ (2015, written and directed by Jessica Edwards)\n\n'The devil ain't got no music. All music is god's music.’\n\nThe Staple Singers pioneered a hybrid of gospel, folk and soul that combined melodic sweetness with a gutsy guitar sound, raw vocal storytelling and an urgent message. With their heartfelt ‘freedom songs’ they took a leading role in the civil rights struggle. And to this day Mavis Staples sustains their calls for progress with resolute positivity.\n\n‘We’ve come to you this evening to bring you some joy, some happiness, inspiration and some positive vibrations.’\n\nLet’s consider how Mavis and the Staple Singers can ‘take you there.’\n\n'I know a place\n\nAin't nobody cryin’,\n\nAin't nobody worried,\n\nAin't no smilin' faces\n\nLyin' to the races.\n\nHelp me, come on, come on.\n\nSomebody, help me now.\n\nHelp me,\n\nHelp me now.\n\nOh, let me take you there.\n\nOh-oh! Let me take you there!’\n\nThe Staple Singers, ‘I’ll Take You There’ (A Isbell / A Hardy)\n\n1. ‘Family is the Strongest Unit in the World’\n\nBorn in 1914, the youngest of 14 children, Roebuck ‘Pops’ Staples grew up on a cotton plantation near Drew, Mississippi. Having learned to play guitar from local bluesmen, he dropped out of school to sing with a gospel group. In 1935 he married Oceola Staples and they moved to Chicago where Pops found work in meatpacking, construction and steel.\n\nThe couple had four children - Cleotha, Pervis, Mavis and Yvonne – who grew up together on 33rd Street on the South Side, a melting pot of musical talent. Sam Cook, Curtis Mayfield and Jerry Butler all lived nearby and the Staples house became a social hub.\n\n‘Everybody would come to our backyard because Mamma would make home-made ice cream, spaghetti, coleslaw. So they knew this was a party at the Staples backyard.’\n\nFamily meant everything to Pops.\n\n'Pops always taught us that family is the strongest unit in the world. If you stick with your family, nobody can break you, nobody can harm you. You'll always have your family.’\n\n2. ‘Sing What You Feel in Your Heart’\n\nPops set about giving the young Staples siblings their musical education.\n\n‘Pops called us kids into the living room. He sat us on the floor in a circle and he began giving us voices to sing that he and his sisters and brothers would sing when they were in Mississippi.’\n\nIn 1948 Pops formed the Staple Singers, and they took to performing in local churches and on the radio.\n\nMavis had a deep, gritty voice that resonated powerfully with Pops’ blues guitar.\n\n‘People would say, ‘That’s not a little girl… It’s got to be a man or a big fat woman.’’\n\nMavis ignored the comments and sang with total conviction.\n\n'I'm just singing what I feel in my heart.’\n\nIn 1952 the Staple Singers signed a professional contract and 1956’s ‘Uncloudy Day,’ their first hit, became the first gospel song to sell a million records.\n\n'They tell me of a home far beyond the skies\n\nAnd they tell me of a home far away.\n\nThey tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise\n\nThey tell me of an unclouded day.’\n\nThe Staple Singers, 'Uncloudy Day'\n\n6. Only Stop Singing When You’ve Nothing Left to Say\n\nSadly Stax was declared bankrupt in1975. The Staple Singers signed to Curtis Mayfield's Curtom label and scored another hit with ‘Let's Do It Again.’ They also memorably performed ‘The Weight’ with The Band in their film ‘The Last Waltz.’ However, with the arrival of disco in the late ‘70s and the growing taste for more heavily produced sounds, the group’s popularity declined.\n\nGradually time has taken its toll. Pops passed away in 2000, followed by Cleotha and Yvonne. When Pervis died in 2021, Mavis became the last soul survivor.\n\n‘It’s because of you, Pops, that I’m standing here today. And I tell you, you laid the foundation and I am still working on the building.’\n\nMavis, who made a couple of fine solo albums in 1969-70, has continued to record brilliant music, on her own and with collaborators. She has no intention of packing it in.\n\n‘People always asking me when am I going to retire. I don’t care to retire….I’ll stop singing when I have nothing left to say. And that ain’t gonna happen.’\n\nI was particularly struck by Mavis’ dedication to the cause; by her youthful enthusiasm and her ageless conviction that there is still work to be done.\n\n‘My mind is made up and my heart is fixed and I just refuse to turn around. I have come too far. And I’m determined to go all the way until Dr King’s dream has been realised… And if y’all don’t see me here singing, look for me in heaven…I’ll be walking those streets of gold and singing around god’s throne.’\n\nMavis and her family teach us that a desire for progress and a commitment to change cannot be lightly held or casually worn. Rather they must come with passion and action; hard work and a hard edge.\n\nAs she sang in one of the Staple Singers’ greatest songs, she’s ‘just another soldier in the army of love.’\n\n'Now hate is my enemy. I gotta fight it day and night.\n\nLove is the only weapon with which I have to fight.\n\nI believe if I show a little love for my fellow man\n\nThen one day I'll hold the victory in my hand.\n\nThat's why I'm just another soldier in the army of love.’\n\nThe Staple Singers, ‘I’m Just Another Soldier’ (R Jackson, H Banks)\n\nNo. 383\n\n'Well, you can bump and grind, it is good for your mind.\n\nWell, you can twist and shout, let it all hang out.\n\nBut you won't fool the children of the revolution.\n\nNo, you won't fool the children of the revolution.’\n\n‘Children of the Revolution’\n\nI recently watched ‘Cosmic Dancer,’ a splendid BBC documentary about the musician Marc Bolan.\n\nIn his brief life Bolan brought colour, style and romance to drab early ‘70s Britain. He set the charts ablaze and hearts aflutter with his swaggering guitar pop. He inspired a generation of teenagers, challenged stereotypes of masculinity and invented Glam Rock.\n\n‘I guess my name will live longer than any record. I am the ‘Cosmic Dancer’ who dances his way out of the womb… I am a lifestyle. I am my own fantasy.’\n\nBolan created his own world of gurus, warlocks and wizards; of gypsy dancers and ‘silver-studded sabre-tooth dreams.’ With a sway of his slim hips and a wave of his elegant hands, this latter day troubadour looked his audience straight in the eye and serenaded them. He was ‘your boy, your 20th century toy.’ He was ‘just a Jeepster for your love.’ And he ‘loved to boogie on a Saturday night.’\n\n‘I’ve always known I was different right from the start, right from the moment I was born. When I was younger I certainly thought I was a superior sort of being. I was very much into my own little world in those days.’\n\nMarc Bolan was born Mark Feld in Hackney, East London, in 1947. His father was a lorry driver and his mother worked on a fruit stall in Berwick Street Market. As a child he fell in love with Elvis Presley, Eddie Cochrane and Gene Vincent. But most of all he fell in love with himself - as he preened, pouted and posed in front of his bedroom mirror.\n\n‘As a little kid I was always into music… I used to just look in the mirror and wiggle about. I was completely knocked out by my own image, by the idea of Mark Feld and what he would become.’\n\nAged 9 Bolan was given his first guitar and he formed a skiffle band at school. Later he embraced the dandy discipline of Mod and featured in a Don McCullin shoot about the youth movement for Town magazine.\n\nBolan was well aware that his popularity was as much based on his image as his music.\n\n‘95% of my success is the way I look. Look and presence is what people pick up on. People are really works of art and if you have a nice face you may as well play about with it.’\n\nBolan’s long lustrous curls tumbled over his delicate shoulders. His purple open-neck shirt revealed a gold pendant on a hairless chest. He shimmied across the stage in flared trousers and stacked heels, scarves on his wrists and a sailor’s hat on his head. He wore leopard, tiger and zebra skin prints; sequins, silk and satin; feather boas, floral shirts and figure-hugging tank tops. He finished off his look with a little glitter on each cheek.\n\n'You're so sweet.\n\nYou're so fine.\n\nI want you all and everything,\n\nJust to be mine.\n\n'Cos you're my baby.\n\n'Cos you're my love.\n\nGirl I'm just a Jeepster\n\nFor you love.’\n\n‘Jeepster'\n\nOf course pop stardom is fleeting. By late 1973 Bolan’s fickle young audience were turning their attention to other heart-throbs - to the Osmonds and David Cassidy.\n\n‘I’ve never felt so insecure as I do about my music, because I’m so exposed. What I’m playing and singing is a projection of my real self.’\n\nThough Bolan had a few more hits, the original T Rex line-up disintegrated and his marriage broke up. He turned to drink and drugs and put on weight. His career limped on with further albums and tours, and his own teatime TV show. But the glory days were over.\n\nIn September 1977, Bolan was being driven home through Barnes by his backing singer and partner Gloria Jones. The yellow Mini struck a fence post and then a tree. Bolan was killed instantly. It was two weeks before his 30th birthday.\n\n‘Personally the prospect of immortality does not excite me, but the prospect of being a materialistic idol for four years does.’\n\nBolan’s time at the top was brief and brilliant. He came to represent an age of innocence, an era of youthful optimism, a period when pop really mattered.\n\nSome took Bolan less seriously because he courted teen magazines and photo shoots; because his looks were flamboyant and his lyrics were daft. But such criticism failed to understand the thrilling effervescence and precious transience of pop music. And Bolan left a legacy. In creating Glam Rock he cleared a path for Bowie, Roxy and Punk.\n\n'It’s easy to underestimate him because he overestimated himself.'\n\nKeith Altham, Publicist\n\nViewed from a distance, one can’t help being struck by Bolan’s extraordinary narcissism and arrogance. This was a man whose self-belief knew no bounds and who often spoke with a comic hauteur.\n\n'If God were to appear in my room, obviously I would be in awe, but I don't think I would be humble. I might cry, but I think he would dig me like crazy.’\n\nIn my time I have known quite a few conceited creative people. I have become convinced that original thinkers need a certain amount of ego to sustain them; that you can’t break conventions without a little self-importance; that invention often comes with pretention. Of course nothing excuses rudeness or poor treatment of others. But there is a price to pay for difference. And it’s a price worth paying if there’s real talent to back it up.\n\n‘I do lie a lot, you know. I feel my credibility as a poet allows me to make things up.’\n\nA few years ago Brian was driving Gwyn and me to a meeting in West London. As we passed Barnes Common, Brian pointed out the spot where Bolan met his end. The car radio had been playing quietly in the background. Suddenly and magically ‘20th Century Boy’ started blaring from the speakers. Bolan had lost none of his dramatic flair.\n\n'My friends say it's fine, friends say it's good.\n\nEverybody says, it's just like a rock 'n' roll should.\n\nI move like a cat, charge like a ram.\n\nSting like a bee, babe, I wanna be your man.\n\nWell, it's plain to see you were meant for me\n\nI'm your boy, your 20th century toy.’\n\nT Rex, ‘20th Century Boy’ (M Bolan)\n\nNo. 333\n\n‘If my heart could do my thinking\n\nAnd my head began to feel,\n\nWould I look upon the world anew,\n\nAnd know what's truly real?’\n\nVan Morrison, ‘I Forgot that Love Existed’\n\nSome time in the late 1980s I went on a road trip round France with my brother Martin and friends Mike and Thommo.\n\nCrammed into a small, silver Citroen AX, with our sports bags strapped to the roof and with nothing booked, we disembarked at Calais and plotted a path towards the Loire Valley.\n\nSince Martin and I were feeling flush, each night we shared a room in a modest hotel, while Mike and Thommo settled for the local campsite. When the four of us reported at the first establishment and requested ‘une chambre a deux lits,’ the proprietor was somewhat challenged. Martin, realising the misunderstanding, gestured towards Mike and Thommo and explained:\n\n‘Non, ils font le camping!’\n\nWe started each day with strong coffee, golden croissants, President butter and apricot jam, and each evening we feasted on quite extraordinary food and wine - whether at a smart local restaurant or a truck drivers’ cafe.\n\n‘Fruits de mer et confit de canard, s’il vous plait.’\n\nThommo couldn’t cope with the unrelenting richness of the meals, and so we took one night off, settling for local ‘Loveburgers’ washed down by 1664.\n\nWe moved on to the Vendée and the Dordogne, through the Auvergne and up to Burgundy, Alsace and Lorraine. And at each new location I dusted off the remnants of my O-Level French.\n\n‘Pardon, maisonette, je n’ai pas de la monnaie.’\n\n‘Ah, c’est l’année des guêpes!'\n\nWe explored lush green landscapes, rugged mountain roads and bleak grey hamlets. We encountered old men playing boules on village squares and young men playing baby-foot in late night bars. We avoided one town because on approach it seemed to be very smelly. Only later did we realise that we’d been following a sewage lorry round a ring road.\n\nWe were accompanied on the trip by Van Morrison’s elegiac ‘Poetic Champions Compose’ album, on repeat play. It seemed entirely appropriate.\n\n'You're the queen of the slipstream with eyes that shine.\n\nYou have crossed many waters to be here.\n\nYou have drunk of the fountain of innocence.\n\nAnd experienced the long cold wintry years.’\n\n‘The Queen of the Slipstream’\n\nOn the long journeys Scouse Mike would amuse himself by hanging his head out of the car window. And when the two campers returned to their site each night, he insisted that Thommo stay up into the early hours drinking cheap warm red wine from plastic bottles.\n\nInevitably on a holiday of this nature, although we were pretty much aligned in terms of evening adventures, there were some disagreements about how to spend the daytime. Martin and I were interested in churches and chateaux. Thommo leaned towards nature and wildlife. Mike just wanted to have fun.\n\nTo accommodate Mike we took in a terrifying luge trip down a mountainside. And when we visited the tomb of Eleanor of Aquitaine at the magnificent abbey at Fontevrault, he persuaded Thommo to stay outside and play footie. On another occasion he took over the map, and, without conferring, navigated us to a beach crowded with locals in skimpy trunks and bikinis. This was not my natural habitat. In protest I sat on a towel fully clothed with my top button done up.\n\n'Let go into the mystery.\n\nLet yourself go.\n\nYou've got to open up your heart,\n\nThat's all I know.\n\nTrust what I say and do what you're told,\n\nBaby, and all your dirt will turn\n\nInto gold.'\n\n‘The Mystery’\n\nWe all look back on the holidays of our youth with great fondness. These were simple, carefree, happy times. And perhaps our exploits were all the more special because they were characterised by surprise, serendipity and strangeness. Everything seemed mysterious.\n\nI read recently (The Guardian 14 May ‘Weird Dreams’) about a new theory of dreams.\n\nDreams have long fascinated scientists and psychoanalysts. Freud believed they were ‘disguised fulfilments of repressed desires.’ And through the years experts have variously hypothesized that they help us process our emotions; consolidate our recollections; make creative connections between memories; and practice our survival skills.\n\nErik Hoel, a research assistant professor of neuroscience at Tufts University in Massachusetts, has proposed that, by introducing the strange and bizarre to our habituated existence, dreams equip us to cope with the unexpected.\n\nHis theory was inspired by the field of machine learning. Artificial intelligence often becomes too familiar with the data with which it’s been coached, assuming that this ‘training set’ is a perfect representation of anything it may subsequently encounter. To remedy this, scientists introduce some chaos into the data in the form of noisy or corrupted inputs.\n\nHoel suggests that our brains do something similar when we dream.\n\n‘It is the very strangeness of dreams in their divergence from waking experience that gives them their biological function.’\n\nThis suggests to me that we should think seriously about the role of the unusual and unfamiliar in our lives.\n\nPerhaps we should more actively embrace strange and bizarre events in our personal and professional worlds; not just in our dreams or on holiday, but in our day-to-day experience. Maybe we should use the weird and wonderful to ward off the narrowing perspectives brought on by habit, custom and age. Maybe we would do well to regard disruption, not just as a revolutionary market force; but as a necessary part of our daily regime.\n\nDespite our excellent gastronomic adventures, by the last night of our tour of France I was pining for some familiar food. Spotting ‘fromage blanc’ on the menu, I assumed it was cheddar and ordered it with eager anticipation. When it arrived it was worryingly soft and smelly.\n\nI ate it nonetheless.\n\n'I've been searching a long time\n\nFor someone exactly like you.\n\nI've been travelling all around the world\n\nWaiting for you to come through.\n\nSomeone like you,\n\nMakes it all worth while.\n\nSomeone like you\n\nKeeps me satisfied.\n\nSomeone exactly like you.’\n\nVan Morrison, ‘Someone Like You’\n\nNo 328\n\n‘I just consider myself a person first. And anything else that anybody else might call you - well, they’re just names really, aren’t they? ’\n\nPoly Styrene\n\nI recently enjoyed a documentary about the luminous singer and inventive songwriter Poly Styrene.\n\nCo-directed by Paul Sng and Poly’s daughter Celeste Bell, ‘Poly Styrene: I Am a Cliché’ reminds us that, as leader of her band X-Ray Spex, Poly gave us some of the most inspiring music of the punk era. She engaged with issues - sexism, racism, consumerism and identity - in a way that was heartfelt, insightful and way ahead of her time. She was a creative force, a defiant political voice and a unique style icon.\n\nLet us consider what Poly teaches us today.\n\n‘Who am I? I’m just an ordinary tough kid from an ordinary tough street.’\n\nMari Elliot was born in 1957 in Bromley and raised in Brixton. Her mother was a Scottish-Irish legal secretary, her father a Somali dockworker. Bullied at school, she encountered racism from all sides.\n\n‘They see us as a threat to their genetic existence.’\n\nAs a teenager Mari travelled around the country going to gigs. She dabbled in a recording career, and made her own customised clothes and jewellery to sell on a stall on the King’s Road. On her nineteenth birthday she saw the Sex Pistols perform on Hastings Pier. She decided there and then to form a punk band, and promptly put an ad in the Melody Maker for ‘young punx who want to stick it together.’\n\nAnd so X-Ray Spex was born. Mari chose her stage name, Poly Styrene, from the Yellow Pages. It suggested ‘something around today - something plastic and synthetic.’\n\nIn 1977 X-Ray Spex released their first single. The song begins with a gently spoken intro:\n\n'Some people say little girls should be seen and not heard. But I think ...\n\nPoly’s voice suddenly becomes irate:\n\n‘Oh bondage up yours! 1-2-3-4!’\n\n‘Oh Bondage Up Yours!’ was inspired by Vivienne Westwood’s Seditionaries outfits, by the Suffragettes and David Bowie, by rage against ubiquitous sexism, racism and consumerism. It was banned by the BBC and was not a hit. But it became a seminal punk single.\n\n‘I discovered a new-found sense of freedom….I had an innate desire to be free – to be free from unwanted desires seemed desirable.’\n\nThe X-Ray Spex sound was built on a base of buzzsaw guitar. A robust saxophone added melody and mystique. And over the top of it all Poly shrieked, chanted and sang with raw power and intensity.\n\n'A lovely girl with a voice that could punch a hole in a steel plate.’\n\nJohnny Rotten\n\nOn stage Poly performed with righteous anger and joyous pride. She skipped, strutted, danced and did a playful hand jive. You can’t take your eyes off her.\n\nGiven her experiences growing up, Poly was keen not to be defined by demographics, gender, ethnicity or style tribe.\n\n‘Identity. That’s one of the current problems at the moment is identity. Everyone’s looking desperately to identify themselves with one thing, instead of themselves.’\n\nShe elegantly articulated these sentiments in song.\n\n'Identity\n\nIs the crisis,\n\nCan't you see?\n\nWhen you look in the mirror,\n\nDo you see yourself?\n\nDo you see yourself\n\nOn the TV screen?\n\nDo you see yourself\n\nIn the magazine?\n\nWhen you see yourself,\n\nDoes it make you scream?’\n\n‘Identity'\n\nI have always found this a compelling provocation. When we look in the mirror, do we see categories and classifications? Do we see other people’s standards and stereotypes - their expectations of who we are? Or do we see a unique individual, liberated from definitions and divisions?\n\nX-Ray Spex did not hang around for too long. They only released five singles and one album, 1978’s ‘Germfree Adolescents.’ They performed in all the classic punk venues: The Roxy, the Man in the Moon, the Hope and Anchor, New York's CBGB's. And they featured in the famous 1978 Rock Against Racism gig at Victoria Park.\n\nBut then in 1979, exhausted by touring, Poly left the band. She was misdiagnosed with schizophrenia and sectioned. Only many years later was her condition recognised as bipolar disorder.\n\n‘It isn’t normal for people to be surrounded by people telling them that they’re great.’\n\nPoly pursued a solo career, developing a more jazz-based sound, and in 1983 she joined the Hare Krishna movement. She died of breast cancer in 2011. She was only 53.\n\nPoly Styrene teaches us that creativity is, at heart, an articulation of your own personal tastes, your individual feelings, your particular perspectives – unconstrained by custom, consensus and convention. Creativity is an expression of self.\n\nThe B-side of X-Ray Spex’ first single was ‘I Am a Cliché’ and featured the song title being repeated over and over again. Of course, Poly Styrene was anything but.\n\n'I drove my polypropylene car on wheels of sponge,\n\nThen pulled into a Wimpy bar to have a rubber bun,\n\nAnd watched the world turn day-glo.\n\nYou know, you know,\n\nThe world turned day-glo.’\n\nX-Ray Spex, ‘The World Turned Day-Glo’\n\nNo. 330\n\n‘Well with buck shot eyes and a purple heart\n\nI rolled down the national stroll\n\nand with a big fat paycheck\n\nstrapped to my hip-sack\n\nand a shore leave wristwatch underneath my sleeve\n\nin a Hong Kong drizzle on Cuban heels\n\nI rowed down the gutter to the Blood Bank\n\nand I'd left all my papers on the Ticonderoga\n\nand I was in bad need of a shave\n\nand so I slopped at the corner on cold chow mein\n\nand shot billiards with a midget\n\nuntil the rain stopped\n\nand I bought a long sleeved shirt\n\nwith horses on the front\n\nand some gum and a lighter and a knife\n\nand a new deck of cards (with girls on the back)\n\nand I sat down and wrote a letter to my wife\n\n’Tom Waits, ‘Shore Leave’\n\nI recently watched a documentary on the musician Tom Waits (‘Tales from a Cracked Jukebox’, BBC4).\n\nIn his gruff, gravelly voice, Waits sings about loneliness and longing in the wee small hours; about outsiders and outcasts - lowlife at the liquor store, in cocktail bars, strip joints and tattoo parlours; about the one that got lucky and the one that got away; about dreaming to the twilight and drinking to forget; about forlorn lovers looking for the heart of Saturday night.\n\n'Oh and the things you can’t remember tell the things you can’t forget\n\nThat history puts a saint\n\nIn every dream.’\n\n‘Time’\n\nWaits pores over the underbelly of American city life, telling tales of warped relationships and withered dreams, cracked aspirations and doomed love; the determined self-delusion of the hopeless case.\n\n'Well I've lost my equilibrium and my car keys and my pride.’\n\n‘The One That Got Away’\n\nWaits is a master of characterisation. He gives us fragments from the lives of damaged veterans, worn out waitresses and escaped criminals - seen through the bottom of a beer glass; refracted through early morning tears. His stories are interwoven with incoherent conversations in a late-night drugstore, the elusive dreams of advertising, the insistent pitch of the whiskey preacher.\n\n‘Don't you know there ain’t no devil,\n\nThere's just god when he's drunk.’\n\n‘Heartattack and Vine’\n\nWaits teaches us a good deal about the alchemy of storytelling; about drawing on a rich set of influences, infusing personal experience with invention and memory; about creating our own imaginary worlds.\n\nInterviewer: Do you have a philosophy about writing?\n\nWaits: Never sleep with a girl named Ruby and never play pool with a guy named Fats.\n\n1. ‘Create Situations in Order to Write About Them’\n\nWaits was born in 1949, in Pomona, California. His parents were teachers, his father an alcoholic. They separated when he was 10 and his mother took him to suburban San Diego. He dropped out of High School and did a variety of low-paid jobs.\n\n‘It was a choice between entertainment and a career in air conditioning and refrigeration.’\n\nWaits turned to music as an escape. He progressed from writing Dylan-influenced folk songs to jazz compositions inspired by the Great American Songbook. In 1972 he moved to LA, settled into a cluttered two-room apartment and hung out in the downtown bars, diners and pool halls.\n\n‘You almost have to create situations in order to write about them, so I live in a constant state of self-imposed poverty.’\n\n2. ‘Combine Imagination with Experience and Memory’\n\n'I like beautiful melodies telling me terrible things.’\n\nWaits took notes of late night conversations with barflies and Bohemians; of dialogue overheard in taxis, at newsstands and gas stations. And then he set his imagination to work.\n\n‘I remain in all of my stories, but at the same time I think that the creative process is a combination of imagination and experience and memories. By the time a story or song is finished, it may or may not resemble wherever the story came from.’\n\nImportantly, Waits blurred the line between experience and invention.\n\n'Mostly I straddle reality and the imagination. My reality needs imagination like a bulb needs a socket. My imagination needs reality like a blind man needs a cane.’\n\n3. ‘Try to Discover That Which Has Been Overlooked By Moving Forward’\n\nWaits grew up surrounded by the emerging hippie culture, but regarded himself as ‘a rebel against the rebels.’ He drew his inspiration from a previous age: from ‘50s Beat writers Kerouac, Ginsberg and Burroughs; from film noir, Hitchcock and ‘The Twilight Zone’; from detective novels and the art of Edward Hopper. He was a man out of time.\n\n‘Sometimes you find yourself going back in time just to locate something that you can’t find in the future. You’re trying to discover that which has been overlooked by moving forward.’\n\n4. Write About People, Places and Things\n\nWaits avoided hollow generalisations. He peppered his work with incidental details; with references to particular streets, brands and weather conditions – to Kentucky Avenue, Burma Shave and ‘that bloodshot moon in that burgundy sky.’ He always wrote about specific people, places and things.\n\n'I think all songs should have weather in them. Names of towns and streets, and they should have a couple of sailors. I think those are just song prerequisites.’\n\nWaits recognised that small events can create big dramas.\n\n‘It’s the little things that drive men mad. It’s the broken shoe lace when there’s no time left that sends men completely out of their minds.’\n\n5. Keep Evolving\n\nWaits’ songwriting style changed over time.\n\n'You have to keep busy. After all, no dog's ever pissed on a moving car.’\n\nIn the early ‘80s he became fascinated by Captain Beefheart, by the pioneering contemporary composer Harry Partch, and by Weimar artists Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht. His song settings moved increasingly from the bar and diner to Vaudeville and the stage, the freakshow and the fairground. His writing explored themes of salvation and damnation. And his instrumentation embraced experimental brass, percussion and found objects\n\n'Oh, I'm not a percussionist, I just like to hit things.’\n\n6. ‘The Way You Affect Your Audience Is More Important than How Many of Them Are There’\n\n'They say that I have no hits and that I'm difficult to work with. And they say that like it's a bad thing.’\n\nThough Waits was much admired by critics and fellow artists, his commercial success was modest. Nonetheless he is regarded as one of America’s greatest songwriters. He has always focused, first and foremost, on the work.\n\n'I would rather be a failure on my own terms than a success on someone else’s. That’s a difficult statement to live up to, but then I’ve always believed that the way you affect your audience is more important than how many of them are there.’\n\nWaits reminds us that reward and recognition should not be objectives, but effects.\n\n'I worry about a lot of things, but I don’t worry about achievements. I worry primarily about whether there are nightclubs in Heaven.’\n\n‘We are ghosts or we are ancestors in our children's lives. We either lay our mistakes, our burdens upon them, and we haunt them, or we assist them in laying those old burdens down and we free them from the chain of our own flawed behavior.'\n\nBruce Springsteen, ‘Springsteen on Broadway’\n\nI recently watched ‘Springsteen on Broadway’ (Netflix), the film record of Bruce Springsteen’s 2017-18 residency at the Walter Kerr Theatre, New York.\n\nI’ve always been an admirer of Springsteen. As a youngster I fell for the romantic picture he painted of blue collar America. He sang about his family and friends, home and hometown; about cars and girls, escape and the open road; about dancing in the dark and racing in the streets; about broken promises, burnt out Chevrolets and the land of hope and dreams. He was a sentimental storyteller, a soulful troubadour. He was the future of rock’n’roll.\n\n‘Springsteen on Broadway’ is not a conventional gig. The singer weaves stripped down versions of some of his more famous numbers around a spoken narrative about his life and career. For the most part he stands alone on stage, in dark jeans and t-shirt. Lean and tanned, face chiseled, eyes beaming, a smile never far from his lips, he commands our attention.\n\nHe explains what his hometown, Freehold, New Jersey, meant to him when he was growing up.\n\n‘There was a place here. You could hear it, you could smell it. A place where people made lives, and where they worked and where they danced, and where they enjoyed small pleasures and played baseball, and suffered pain; where they had their hearts broken and where they made love, had kids; where they died and drank themselves drunk on spring nights; and where they did their very best, the best they could to hold off the demons outside and inside that sought to destroy them and their homes and their families and their town.'\n\nSpringsteen speaks with a preacher’s zeal, testifying to the ties that bind. He prompts us to recall why we loved the United States in the first place; reaffirms the fundamental dignity of the working class; reminds us that masculinity doesn’t have to be toxic; restores our faith in the transformative power of rock’n’roll music.\n\n‘The joyful, life-affirming, hip-shaking, ass-quaking, guitar-playing, mind and heart-changing, race-challenging, soul-lifting bliss of a freer existence… All you had to do to get a taste of it was to risk being your true self.’\n\nSpringsteen’s emotive themes resonate particularly in a contemporary setting, when there’s so much doubt about America and its place in the world – when there’s a darkness on the edge of town.\n\n‘These days some reminding of who we are and who we can be isn’t such a bad thing.’\n\nThere’s a compelling moment early in the show when Springsteen comes clean about the source of his classic blue collar narratives.\n\n'I come from a boardwalk town where everything is tinged with just a bit of fraud. So am I … I’ve never held an honest job in my entire life. I've never done any hard labor. I've never worked nine to five… I’ve never seen the inside of a factory and yet it’s all I’ve ever written about. Standing before you is a man who has become wildly and absurdly successful writing about something of which he has had absolutely no personal experience. I made it all up.'\n\nThough Springsteen had little first hand experience of working class struggle, it becomes clear, nonetheless, that his storytelling gift was rooted in observation of the community he grew up in, awareness of its strengths and passions, sensitivity to its trials and tribulations. Moreover, many of his songs were inspired by his father - ‘my hero and my greatest foe’ - a complex man of Dutch Irish descent, who was haunted by depression and drink and struggled to find work.\n\n‘Now those whose love we wanted but didn’t get, we emulate them. It’s the only way we have in our power to get the closeness and the love that we needed and desired.’\n\n'My darling, believe me.\n\nFor me there is no one but you.\n\nPlease love me too.'\n\nAretha seemed to reach out to me across an ocean, across a great divide of experience, ethnicity, gender and age. The soaring vocals, the spirituality cut right through me. Her voice demolished the distance between us. It was immediate, urgent, gentle and kind.\n\n'Sometimes, what you’re looking for is already there.’\n\nAretha Franklin\n\nBorn in Memphis in 1942, raised in Detroit, the daughter of a famous preacher, Aretha learned to sing and play the piano in church. But her recording career was initially only moderately successful. Then she teamed up with producer Jerry Wexler at Atlantic Records, and in 1967 they went down to record at Muscle Shoals, Alabama. There followed a cascade of luminous soul classics: ‘I Never Loved a Man,’ ‘Respect’, ‘Natural Woman’, ‘Chain of Fools,’ ‘Think’ – variously expressing ardent affection, enduring love, self-righteous anger and bitter regret. She was hugely successful, universally acclaimed, justly lauded as ‘The Queen of Soul’.\n\nYet things were never easy for Aretha. She had a tough childhood and a challenging youth. She was unlucky in love and struggled with health issues. In her rare interviews she seemed shy, wary and a little awkward. She wasn’t a natural celebrity and, as she had a fear of flying, she seldom traveled abroad in later life.\n\nAretha’s warm mezzo-soprano articulated the breadth of these experiences, embracing all the joy, heartache and pain. She could be weak sometimes, and at other times compellingly strong. She always communicated an intense humanity.\n\n'All I'm askin'\n\nIs for a little respect when you come home (just a little bit).'\n\nAretha Franklin, ‘Respect’ (Otis Redding)\n\nOf course, for the most part Aretha didn’t sing her own words. She was channelling the thoughts of the lyricist, inhabiting the character of the song. But she had a special talent for expressing real feeling, true emotion. When I listen to ‘Don’t Play That Song’, ’Aint No Way’,’ Until You Come Back To Me’, I feel what Aretha feels. I second that emotion.\n\nWe talk a good deal about empathy in business nowadays. We define it as the ability to put ourselves in other people’s shoes. But what does this really mean?\n\nAretha teaches that empathy is not a rational condition. It’s not a cold calculation of other people’s circumstances. It is a profoundly emotional state. It’s the ability to identify shared human truths; to really feel for someone; to share their sentiments; to inhabit their triumphs, challenges and disappointments - despite differences of background and experience, regardless of race, colour or creed.\n\n'Baby, will you call me the moment you get there?\n\nBaby, will you do that, will you do that for me now?\n\nOh, call me, call me the hour, call me the minute, the second that you get there.\n\nOh, call me, call me, call me, call me, call me, call me, baby.'\n\nRodgers and Hammerstein’s Oklahoma! features a song called ‘The Farmer and the Cowman.’ This jaunty number explores the musical’s central tension between the farmers, who have an instinct to settle and cultivate the land, and the cowmen, who naturally want to move on and pioneer new territories. Brian Eno, the master musician, producer and artist, has observed that this tension, between cultivating and pioneering, is fundamental to our understanding of creativity.\n\n‘I often think that art is divided between the farmer and the cowboy: the farmer is the guy who finds a piece of territory, stakes it up, digs it and cultivates it – grows the land. The cowboy is the one who goes out and finds new territories.’\n\nIt’s a thought provoking distinction. And perhaps all of us in the field of commercial creativity should ask ourselves: What kind of creative am I? Am I more adept at pioneering or cultivating? Am I a cowboy or a farmer?\n\nI suspect most of us would like to imagine ourselves as cowboys or cowgirls; as experts in reframing, redefining, reinventing; as intrepid adventurers intent on discovering new frontiers. It’s the more romantic choice. Indeed this is Eno’s own understanding of himself.\n\n‘I would rather think of myself as the cowboy, really, than the farmer. I like the thrill of being somewhere where I know no one else has been.’\n\nBut let’s not be too hasty.\n\nMany of the world’s great artists could perhaps be described as more farmer than cowboy. Think Mondrian, Giacometti, Rothko or Pollock. They worked within a coherent conceptual space, repeatedly revisiting a relatively narrow terrain; making it their own through variety and depth of expression. They ‘grew the land.’\n\nMoreover, in the world of commercial creativity ongoing brand success requires high levels of consistency and coherence: campaigns that build a positioning; initiatives that sustain and evolve a theme; executions that nurture an idea with imagination and freshness.\n\nMy former boss Sir Nigel Bogle would often talk of a brand needing to ‘move it on without moving it off.’ This task can be just as critical and just as challenging as complete reinvention. It requires the calibrated embrace of context, a more nuanced understanding of past success, a respect for ideas that were not invented here. But do we properly appreciate, celebrate and reward the ability to evolve, nurture and cultivate? Do we really acknowledge the worth of the creative farmer? Or will we always prefer our creative cowboys and cowgirls and their mastery of the blank piece of paper?\n\nPerhaps a little predictably, I’m inclined to say that a healthy creative business needs both cowboys and farmers. We need to be able to pioneer as well as to cultivate; to reinvent as well as to refine. And critically we need to know when to adopt each of these two modes; when to stick and when to twist.\n\nAs Rodgers and Hammerstein put it, ‘the farmer and the cowman should be friends.’\n\n‘Oh, the farmer and the cowman should be friends.\n\nOne man likes to push a plough, the other likes to chase a\n\ncow,\n\nBut that's no reason why they cain't be friends.’\n\nThe Farmer and the Cowman, Rodgers and Hammerstein\n\nNo.115"
