        "text": "Ike Turner, born November 5, 1931 in Clarksdale, Mississippi, grew up playing the blues. In 1956, he met a teenage girl and singer named Anna Mae Bullock. He married her and helped create her stage persona, Tina Turner. The two became the revue Ike & Tina Turner and created several R&B hits, including \"I Idolize You,\" \"It's Go Work Out Right\" and \"Poor Fool.\n\nThe duo's cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Proud Mary\" won them their first and only Grammy Award together in 1971. Their last hit together was \"Nutbush City Limits,\" written by Tina and released in 1973. Turner died of a cocaine overdose on December 12, 2007, in San Marcos, California.\n\nThe stormy relationship with Tina Turner\n\nHe met Tina Turner when she was 17 years old in a club in St. Louis (Missouri). He married her in Mexico in 1962 and they formed the group Ike & Tina. They had children together, divorcing in 1976 due to the continuous aggressions of Ike, who beat and forced Tina to sing sick and his public and repeated infidelities with other women.\n\nIke Turner was sinking in alcohol and drugs. He was arrested numerous times for possession of narcotics and spent 17 months in jail.\n\nIn 1993 the film What's Love Got To Do With It was released, taken from Tina's autobiography and directed by Brian Gibson, which narrated the life of Tina Turner and in which the actor Laurence Fishburne played a violent Ike accused of domestic violence.\n\nIke Turner Net Worth\n\nIke Turner is considered to be a pioneer of fifties rock and roll, but his roots are found in the blues, which he returned to in the late days of his career. Ike is probably best-known for his work with his then-wife Tina Turner. At the time of his death his fortune was estimated at 500 thousand dollars, according to the website celebritynetworth.com.\n\nIke Turner died of an accidental cocaine overdose, the San Diego medical examiner said.\n\nTurner, 76, was found dead Dec. 12, 2007, at his home in San Marcos, San Diego County."
