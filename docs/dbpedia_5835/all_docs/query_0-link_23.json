        "text": "As we prepare to usher in a new year, we can’t help but pause for a moment to remember those who are no longer with us. This past year saw the deaths of some huge stars, pioneering personalities and memorable figures who seemed larger than life and left their marks behind on the world.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the most notable deaths of 2023.\n\nAdam Rich\n\nRich was a child star who gained fame playing Nicholas Bradford on the ABC series “Eight Is Enough,” which aired from 1977 until 1981. He was found dead Jan. 7 in his Los Angeles home, NBC News reported at the time. In June, the medical examiner's office ruled Rich died from the effects of the drug fentanyl and that the death was an accident. He was 54.\n\n“Adam was simply a wonderful guy. He was kind, generous and a warrior in the fight against mental illness,” his spokesperson, Danny Deraney, said in a statement in January.\n\n“He really was America's Little Brother,” he added.\n\nJeff Beck\n\nA trailblazing and beloved guitarist who fused a variety of musical styles in his music, Beck died Jan. 10 of bacterial meningitis. He was 78.
