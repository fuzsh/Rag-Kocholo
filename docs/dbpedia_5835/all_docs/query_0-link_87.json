        "text": "C-J's Kramer cherishes arts community in all its forms\n\n\"Do you think he's guilty?\" my grandmother's friend asked over cocktails at her apartment in The 800. I was 8, but I knew who John Dean was. His picture was on Time magazine.\n\nEven then, I knew about journalism. At home, my parents subscribed to The Courier-Journal and magazines, watched television news and listened to WHAS radio. The news informed discussions — Watergate, the Cold War and even Mikhail Baryshnikov's defection from the Soviet Union.\n\nThat last one caught my attention. I was one of those little girls who, around 4 years old, would parade around the living room to Tchaikovsky, determined to dance ballet. (I also danced to my father's Ray Charles and my mother's Ike and Tina Turner records.) I did get lessons a few years later, but they only lasted for a short time before other school and family events squeezed that from the schedule. (There is a similar story regarding my piano lessons.)\n\nWhen the Louisville Ballet announced Baryshnikov would perform with the company, I begged to go and my grandmother bought season tickets. She took me to that performance and others over the next several years. She also took me to the opera and the orchestra, while my mother took my sister and me to theatrical performances, including Marcel Marceau and \"A Chorus Line.\" I even remember reading reviews by the late William Mootz in The Courier-Journal.\n\nDuring those years, I was a theater kid who knew she could find a writing life in journalism. But it wasn't until my second year at Indiana University and after a semester on the campus newspaper's city desk that I introduced myself to the arts editor and found my niche. I took electives in the arts nearly every semester (including art history, voice, playwriting and, yes, tap dancing), and my senior year I became arts editor.\n\nBut my path to become The Courier-Journal's primary arts writer hasn't been a straight one. I've been a freelance journalist. I've worked for arts organizations. I've worked in public radio. My passion for foreign cultures led me to Africa, where I worked in humanitarian aid doing media-related work for most of the 1990s. I moved to New York City for several years to do the same. There I had exhilarating access to so much art and also got back into journalism.\n\nA few years ago, I was a guest in a college arts administration class where the instructor asked me if I was or aspired to be an artist. The question completely threw me. I never have. Instead, I always sought a way to be a catalyst for and transcriber of art and creativity in its eclectic forms.\n\nCommunities need that. People need that. (I also believe the conflict of interest that comes if a political reporter decides to run for public office applies to me in the parallel arts reporter-artist comparison.) And people need to see that art isn't something that just happens in the glow of stage lights and behind gallery walls.\n\nJust like a reporter covering agriculture or another covering politics, my own appreciation for the subjects are enriched when I know, as they say, how the sausage gets made, or the backstory.\n\nThat's why I love to write about the mounting of an exhibit, the practices of a sculptor in a studio, the rehearsals for a play, ballet or concert. It's why I love covering the economics and politics that shape the arts, and why I write about the performance of the Louisville Fund for the Arts and the financial standing of arts organizations.\n\nThat's why a few weeks ago I wrote about a woman who started a her dream business called Good Garbage, which collects materials to sell for reuse, and found she can meet many artists' needs. That's why I wrote about a former Louisville Orchestra violinist who quit his longtime job there several years ago to focus on providing lessons to children at his school in the West End.\n\nWhat keeps me going is a core belief that the arts are necessary for the welfare of a community and individuals. They fortify the social connections that strengthen democracy by bringing to it a multitude of voices and conversations.\n\nFor many, the language of art allows people not only an exhilarating way to communicate, but also sometimes the only way or safe way to communicate, as is stressed in art therapy. Deciphering any extent of art takes time — listening, watching, reading and hearing. And when art achieves a high level of quality, that illuminates and speaks to people; the power is arresting.\n\nSo, I go to as many arts events as I can outside my office hours. Sometimes I'm writing about them. Often, I'm not, but they give me insights in the community and into the artists' work to inform my own writing.\n\nI try to be attentive to all that the arts offer this region, and that's true when July comes. That's when I begin to pore over the listings of events in the upcoming season, which wonderful colleagues Gege Reed, Denise Smith and Kenzie Winstead work to put together.\n\nThen comes the consuming process of considering all there is in classical music, dance, theater and the visual arts and recommend five events in each category for the upcoming year. That's not an easy task.\n\nPick just one Louisville Orchestra performance? Well, yes. But there's so much more. There's a wealth of classical music in the city that has the Kentucky Opera, the University of Louisville's School of Music, a vibrant choral scene and several chamber music performances by musicians from this community as well as touring ensembles.\n\nChoosing among the many theater and visual arts events takes time and care as well. I work to apply that level of care to what I choose to write about over the year to provide a deep and wide view of the arts here.\n\nBut I love what I do and I cherish the arts community in all its forms here — of course I'm particularly privileged that there's a bit of family and Louisville art history in the building where I work.\n\nIn The Courier-Journal's lobby, there is a multicolored fresco dated 1947 by Henry Varnum Poor, whose murals are in several federal buildings, including the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building, and whose ceramic works are in the Art Institute of Chicago and the Metropolitan Museum of Art collections.\n\nIn one corner is Poor's signature and under it the name of my grandfather, who did the plaster work. His face appears as one of the Appalachian men in one panel, along with the likeness of my aunt and my uncle when they were children.\n\nIn some ways, it's just another backstory, but one that for me has illuminated family history I never fully knew until I started working here more than four years ago.\n\nReporter Elizabeth Kramer can be reached at (502) 582-4682.
