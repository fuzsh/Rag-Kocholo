        "text": "Stephanie Sy:\n\nShe was the undisputed queen of rock 'n' roll, a Black woman who conquered every stage with unleashed sexuality, power, and raw emotion.\n\nIn a career spanning eight decades, Tina Turner sold more than 100 million records, won 12 Grammys and in 2021 was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Born in the Tennessee Delta, Turner rose to fame with Ike Turner. The Ike and Tina Turner Revue broke out with a bevy of hits, including \"Proud Mary.\"\n\nTurner's soulful rasp and stage presence enthralled fans. But, behind the scenes, she was a victim of domestic abuse. Turner endured more than a decade of husband Ike Turner's beatings and infidelity. The late Ike once broke her jaw. Years later, she explained why she stayed as long as she did in the relationship to Australian \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nTina Turner, Musician:\n\nIt became a way of life. It was on hold, I'd have to say, as far as I can remember now. I had put everything on hold because it was just an existence of children being involved, debts.\n\nWhere is it to go? Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.\n\nStephanie Sy:\n\nShe did initially struggle. Getting a solo recording contract wasn't easy. But when she did come back, it was by storm with the 1984 album \"Private Dancer.\" By then in her mid-40s, the album's song \"What's Love Got to Do With It\" became her best-selling single.\n\nAfter her comeback, she published a groundbreaking autobiography. \"I, Tina\" was adapted to the silver screen with Tina Turner played by Angela Bassett. As a live performer, Turner was an original, inspiring the likes of Mick Jagger and Beyonce, the moves and that voice. She was simply the best.\n\nFor the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Stephanie Sy."
