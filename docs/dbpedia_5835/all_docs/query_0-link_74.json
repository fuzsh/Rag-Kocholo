He had a run of top 10 hits from the 1950s into the 21st century, and his music was heard everywhere from movie soundtracks and radios to home stereo systems and iPods, whether Alfie and I Say a Little Prayer or I’ll Never Fall in Love Again and This Guy’s in Love with You.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nDionne Warwick was his favourite interpreter but Bacharach, usually in tandem with lyricist Hal David, also created prime material for Aretha Franklin, Dusty Springfield, Tom Jones and many others.

He was 61.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nSizemore became a star with acclaimed appearances in Natural Born Killers and the cult-classic crime thriller Heat. But serious substance dependency, abuse allegations and multiple run-ins with the law devastated his career and sent him to jail.\n\nDespite the raft of legal trouble, he had scores of steady film and television credits, though his career never regained its onetime momentum. Aside from Black Hawk Down and Pearl Harbor, most of his 21st century roles came in low-budget productions, where he continued to play the gruff, tough guys he became famous for portraying.\n\nGary Rossington\n\nGary Rossington, Lynyrd Skynyrd’s last surviving original member who also helped found the group, died on March 5 at the age of 71.\n\nAfter adopting Lynyrd Skynyrd as the group’s name — both a reference to a similarly named sports coach at Rossington’s high school and to a character in the 1963 novelty hit Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh — the band released their debut album in 1973.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nA collection of country-tinged blues-rock and Southern soul, the album included now-classics like Tuesday’s Gone, Simple Man and Gimme Three Steps, but it was the closing track, the nearly 10-minute Free Bird, that became the group’s calling card, due in no small part to Rossington’s evocative slide playing on his Gibson SG.\n\nRobert Blake\n\nRobert Blake, the Emmy award-winning performer who went from acclaim for his acting to notoriety when he was tried and acquitted in the killing of his wife, died on March 9. He was 89.\n\nBlake, star of the 1970s TV show, Baretta, once hoped for a comeback, but he never recovered from the long ordeal which began with the shooting death of his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, outside a Studio City restaurant on May 4, 2001.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nHe was adamant that he had not killed his wife and a jury ultimately acquitted him.

Schulz of Peanuts fame and Far Side creator Gary Larson to Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, who marked Jaffee’s 85th birthday by featuring a Fold-In cake on The Colbert Report. He retired at the age of 99.\n\nKeith Nale\n\nTwo-time Survivor contestant and fan-favorite Keith Nale died Apr. 18 at the age of 62.\n\nNale, a firefighter by trade, competed on Survivor: San Juan del Sur in 2014 and Survivor: Cambodia in 2015.\n\nIn San Juan, Nale succeeded in making it to the final four contestants, but was eventually bested by Natalie Anderson, who won the season.\n\nWhile competing in Cambodia, Keith took a more collaborative approach, but ultimately lost the winning title to Jeremy Collins.

He praised a salsa-dancing couple as “like two sizzling sausages on a barbecue.”\n\nGoodman announced his retirement from DWTS last year, after serving on the judge’s panel for 31 seasons. During his last appearance on the show, Goodman received a standing ovation from the in-house audience.\n\nHarry Belafonte\n\nHarry Belafonte, the civil rights and entertainment giant who began as a groundbreaking actor and singer and became an activist, humanitarian and conscience of the world, died April 25 at the age of 96.\n\nBelafonte was one of the first Black performers to gain a wide following on film and to sell a million records as a singer; many still know him for his signature hit Banana Boat Song (Day-O), and its call of “Day-O! Daaaaay-O.” But he forged a greater legacy once he scaled back his performing career in the 1960s and lived out his hero Paul Robeson’s decree that artists are “gatekeepers of truth.”\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBelafonte participated in protest marches and benefit concerts and helped organize and raise support for them. He worked closely with his friend and generational peer the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., often intervening on his behalf with both politicians and fellow entertainers and helping him financially.\n\nHe risked his life and livelihood and set high standards for younger Black celebrities, scolding Jay-Z and Beyoncé for failing to meet their “social responsibilities,” and mentoring Usher, Common, Danny Glover and many others. In Spike Lee’s 2018 film BlacKkKlansman, he was fittingly cast as an elder statesman schooling young activists about the country’s past.\n\nJerry Springer\n\nJerry Springer, the legendary talk show host and former mayor of Cincinnati, died on April 27 at the age of 79.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWhile most famous for his popular, and at times controversial, talk show, The Jerry Springer Show, Springer wore many hats over the course of his life, including actor, producer, lawyer and politician.\n\nHis long-running talk show, and all the subsequent on-stage drama, ran from September 1991 to July 2018. He also hosted the Jerry Springer Podcast for seven years, from 2015 to 2022, and hosted a show called Judge Jerry from 2019 to 2022.\n\nAt its peak, The Jerry Springer Show was a ratings powerhouse and a U.S. cultural pariah, synonymous with lurid drama. Known for chair-throwing and bleep-filled arguments, the daytime talk show was a favorite American guilty pleasure over its 27-year run, at one point topping Oprah Winfrey’s show.\n\nAfter more than 4,000 episodes, the show ended in 2018, never straying from its core salaciousness: Some of its last episodes had such titles as Stripper Sex Turned Me Straight, Stop Pimpin’ My Twin Sister, and Hooking Up With My Therapist.\n\nGordon Lightfoot\n\nGordon Lightfoot, often called Canada’s greatest songwriter and known worldwide as one of the founding fathers of folk-rock, died on May 1 at age 84.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAn iconic figure in the ‘60s and ‘70s, Lightfoot wrote many songs that transcended borders and music tastes, including The Wreck of Edmund Fitzgerald, Ribbon of Darkness and If You Could Read My Mind, among many, many others.\n\nLegendary musicians like Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Hank Williams Jr., Bob Dylan and Barbra Streisand — to name just a few — recorded Lightfoot’s songs to great success, and he was widely respected in the music industry.\n\nDeveloping a reputation in the industry, Lightfoot signed on with United Artists in 1965 and released I’m Not Saying as a single. He appeared on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson and showed up at the Newport Folk Festival, further establishing his name on the music scene. Not long afterwards, he recorded his first album, Lightfoot!, which featured hit songs Early Mornin’ Rain and For Lovin’ Me.\n\nUnknowingly, Lightfoot had set a bar: he became famous as a Canadian artist without capitulating and moving to the U.S., a feat not commonly seen.\n\nJacklyn Zeman\n\nJacklyn Zeman, who played Bobbie Spencer for 45 years on ABC’s General Hospital, died May 9 at the age of 70.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nZeman joined General Hospital in 1977 as Barbara Jean, who went by Bobbie, and was the feisty younger sister of Anthony Geary’s Luke Spencer.

When he was able to bench press 605 pounds, Graham completed a photo shoot with Arnold Schwarzenegger for Muscle and Fitness magazine.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe photo shoot pushed Graham toward the entertainment industry.

She was a star from her 1987 debut album The Lion and the Cobra and became a sensation in 1990 with her cover of Prince’s ballad Nothing Compares 2 U, a seething, shattering performance that topped charts from Europe to Australia and was heightened by a promotional video featuring the grey-eyed O’Connor in intense close-up.\n\nA critic of the Catholic Church well before allegations sexual abuse were widely reported, O’Connor made headlines in October 1992 when she tore up a photo of Pope John Paul II while appearing live on NBC’s Saturday Night Live and denounced the church as the enemy.\n\nFor many years, she called for a full investigation into the extent of the church’s role in concealing child abuse by clergy.

His departure, ironically, was touched off by the song he co-wrote and was best known for, Take It to the Limit.\n\nA shy Nebraskan torn between fame and family life, Meisner had been ill and homesick during the Hotel California tour (his first marriage was breaking up) and was reluctant to have the spotlight for Take It to the Limit, a showcase for his high tenor. His objections during a Knoxville, Tennessee concert in the summer of 1977 so angered Frey that the two argued backstage and Meisner left soon after.\n\n“The purpose of the whole Eagles thing to me was that combination and the chemistry that made all the harmonies just sound perfect,” Meisner told the music website Lobster Got Talent in 2015. “The funny thing is after we made those albums I never listened to them and it is only when someone comes over or I am at somebody’s house and it gets played in the background that is when I’ll tell myself, `Damn, these records are good.”’\n\nPaul Reubens\n\nActor Paul Reubens, best known for his portrayal as ’80s television character Pee-wee Herman, died on July 30, years after he was diagnosed with cancer.
