        "text": "SAN MARCOS – Ike Turner died Wednesday at his North County home.A groundbreaking guitarist, pianist and bandleader who helpedpioneer both early rock ‘n’ roll and modern rhythm and blues,Turner’s reputation was tarnished by his drug addiction, stint inprison and allegations on film and in print that he abused TinaTurner, his famous former wife. He was 76.\n\nAn investigator with the county Medical Examiner’s Office saidTurner died at 11:38 a.m. The cause of death had not beendetermined, but foul play was not suspected, the investigatorsaid.\n\nMembers of Turner’s band, the Kings of Rhythm, had gathered athis house Wednesday morning.\n\n“We all came just to surprise Ike and make him feel better,”said bass player and band leader Kevin Cooper of San Diego.”Instead we got our own surprise.”\n\nCooper said Turner’s ex-wife and manager, Ann Thomas, was thelast to see him alive in his bedroom just after 8 a.m. Wednesday.With the band members in the house and ready to play some music tocheer him up, she delivered the news that he wasn’t breathing. Bandmembers tried unsuccessfully to revive him before paramedicsarrived, he said.\n\nThe band members stood somberly in a straight line outside hisfront door as Turner’s body, wrapped in a maroon bag, was led outof the house and into a waiting white van at about 3:15 p.m.\n\nA 1991 Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame inductee with his ex-wifeTina, Turner’s significant impact on popular American music willprobably be forever overshadowed by Tina’s allegations that hesavagely beat and otherwise abused her during their marriage.\n\nWhile he disputed the severity of those allegations, a 1993film, “What’s Love Got to Do With It?” — based on Tina’s 1986autobiography — portrayed Ike as a violent thug. The movie’spopularity and salacious details became a pivotal moment inAmerican culture, spurring public interest in solving theoften-hidden problem of domestic violence.\n\nTina Turner declined comment on her ex-husband’s passing througha spokesperson.\n\nIn an interview with the North County Times in February afterwinning his second Grammy award — for his 2006 CD “Risin’ With theBlues” — Turner bemoaned his public persona.\n\n“I’m not the person that they made me in the movie,” he toldTimes reporter Noelle Ibrahim.\n\nMusically, while Turner achieved his greatest popularity in the1960s and early ’70s with the Ike and Tina Turner Revue, his mostinfluential period was in the early 1950s when he was a housemusician, arranger and band leader at Sam Phillips’ legendary SunStudios in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nThere he not only mingled with the likes of Elvis Presley,Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison and Jerry Lee Lewis, but he also played onnumerous blues and early rhythm and blues records by such emergingstars as Howlin’ Wolf, Sonny Boy Williamson and B.B. King.\n\nThe most famous session was in 1951, when his own band recordeda song he had written titled “Rocket 88,” which is widely cited asthe first rock ‘n’ roll record because of its driving beat andheavily distorted electric guitar. However, Chess Records issuedthe song under the name of the young singer in Turner’s band,Jackie Brenston, robbing him of credit for many years until musichistorians began citing his role.\n\n“If ever there was a first rock ‘n’ roll song, that was it,”said Dan Del Fiorentino, historian for the Museum of Making Musicin Carlsbad on Wednesday. “That’s pre-Elvis, that’s pre-everybody.It’s important to look back and say he was there at the beginning,and he should get props for that.”\n\nTurner was born Izear Luster Turner Jr. in Clarksdale, Miss., onNov. 5, 1931. In interviews about his childhood, he said he firstfell in love with music while hanging out at a local Clarksdaleradio station from the age of 8, helping the disc jockeys. The”Routledge Encyclopedia of the Blues” credits blues pianist JoeWillie “Pinetop” Perkins with giving Turner his first music lessonsat around the same time.\n\nWhile still in high school, he formed his first edition of theKings of Rhythm band, eventually playing from bases in St. Louisand as far east as Memphis.\n\nBy the late 1950s, Turner had left Sun Studios, which hadincreasingly turned from recording black blues musicians to themore lucrative, white rockabilly bands of the time.\n\nIn 1959, he hired a young singer named Anna Mae Bullock. He gaveher the stage name of Tina, and changed the name of the band to theIke and Tina Turner Revue, which quickly scored a Top 10 hit in1960 with “A Fool in Love.” The Revue was a popular draw throughoutthe 1960s and early ’70s, releasing a string of hits and winning aGrammy in 1971 for the band’s high-energy cover of the CreedenceClearwater Revival song “Proud Mary.”\n\nIn the mid-’70s, the Turners split both professionally andpersonally, with their divorce finalized in 1978. While Tinareturned to the charts in the 1980s as a popular solo act, Ikenever again achieved the fame he’d known with the Revue.\n\nTurner had lived in San Marcos since 1991, and had reformed hislegendary Kings of Rhythm band, filling it out with both longtimemusical cohorts and young musicians from around town. Musically, hereturned to the blues and R&B of his youth, releasing theGrammy-nominated “Here and Now” in 2001 and the Grammy-winning”Risin’ With the Blues” last year.\n\nEncinitas’ Leo Dombecki, who played saxophone in Turner’s bandfor the past four years, praised Turner as a kind and patientteacher and boss, and said he hoped Turner’s legacy will includehis musical contributions as well as his personal failings.\n\n“All he ever really cared about was the music, so hopefullypeople pick it up from there and move on,” Dombecki said."
