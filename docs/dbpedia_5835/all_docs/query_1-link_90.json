        "text": "From the Associated Press:\"Ike Turner, whose role as one of rock's critical architects was overshadowed by his ogrelike image as the man who brutally abused former wife and icon Tina Turner, died Wednesday at his home in suburban San Diego. He was 76.\"'He did pass away this morning' at his home in San Marcos, in northern San Diego County, said Scott M. Hanover of Thrill Entertainment Group, which managed Turner's musical career.\"\"There was no immediate word on the cause of death.\"\"A spokesperson for Tina Turner, who endured a tumultuous and well-chronicled marriage to Ike, tells Access Hollywood, \"Tina hasn&#146;t had any contact with Ike in more than 30 years. No further comment will be made.\""
