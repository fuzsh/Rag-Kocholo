        "text": "In recognition and celebration of Black History Month this February, we have curated a selection of books, films, podcasts, and music that celebrate the voices, writing, lives, and history of Black people in America. This collection loosely centers around Blackness in media—aiming to highlight Black music, pop culture, television, and performance. In these selections you will find Black creators discussing the impact of media misrepresentation on Black masculinity, connections between Black music and culinary traditions, rest as a form of resistance, the history of Black performance in America, Black feminist sound, and ekphrastic Black & queer futures alongside a variety of other topics. We hope that you can utilize this collection alongside additional IU Library resources to recognize and celebrate the work of Black intellectuals, writers, poets, chefs, directors, and creators this February.\n\nOur collection is only a small sampling of texts. See below for additional reading lists:\n\nBlack History Month Reading List (Monroe County Public Library)\n\nReading Recommendations From Black Cultural Figures (T Magazine)\n\nBlack Caucus, American Library Association Resources (BCALA)\n\nBlack History Reading List (Innocence Project)\n\nBlack History Month Reading List (The Century Foundation)\n\nBlack Lives Matter Reading Lists (Powell's Books)\n\nAbout the Playlist\n\nIn addition to the resources we've gathered in this feature, we've also curated a sampling of music by black artists, across time and genre. To learn more about the deep and varied contributions of black musicians to the development of this medium, take a look at some of the resources we used to make this and other related playlists in the Sounds of Black History Month feature.\n\nNote: To enjoy the playlist in full, click on the white Spotify icon in the upper-right corner of the playlist, and press the \"like\" (♡) button in the application to save.\n\nNext Steps\n\nNational recognition months are a great opportunity to celebrate and participate in events and learning that honor the history of marginalized communities. We recognize, however, that these months, and the creation of resource guides, is only one small step in celebrating and recognizing the contributions of marginalized communities across America. We also recognize that reading books, engaging with films, and listening to music by Black creators is only one aspect of supporting Black communities. To engage more fully, consider supporting local Black-owned businesses, learning about the history and experiences of Black people in Bloomington and at IU, and supporting institutions at IU the are dedicated to Black students. Please see our feature on Local Black History for resources specific to Bloomington, Indiana.\n\nIn particular, we would like to highlight the Celebrating Black Cinema series hosted by the Black Film Center & Archive, the Neal-Marshall Black Culture Center, and the City of Bloomington. See the full list of events on the Neal-Marshall Black Culture Center Calendar.\n\nTo explore more programming at IU, see below:\n\nArchives of African American Music and Culture (AAAMC at IU)\n\nA repository of materials covering a range of African American musical idioms and cultural expressions from the post-World War II era.\n\nPride of IU Stories: Black History Month Features\n\nWhile Black History Month, as a formulation, often emphasizes history and the present (and thus maintains a retrospective focus), we acknowledge that there are many Black futures that we can dream, cultivate, and grow together. While we have highlighted a number of resources that imagine a different world, in the (or \"a\") future we hope to shift our focus to looking forward, with new features and resources that highlight what is possible.\n\nIf you'd like to engage more deeply with Black History Month through library resources, the IU Libraries Arts & Humanities department has created a number of resources and features to provide more holistic coverage of Black history:\n\nThe Sounds of Black History Month (Media Studies)\n\nBlack LGBTQ+ Poetry (Gender Studies)\n\nBlack Philosophy & Thought (Philosophy)\n\nIn Memoriam: bell hooks (Philosophy)\n\nLocal Black History (Race, Migration, & Indigeneity)\n\nBlack American Poets and Poetry, 1770-Present (Literature)\n\nBlack Freedom Movements in American History (History)\n\nAfrican American Voices and History in University Collections (History)\n\nContemporary Black Playwrights You Should Know (Theatre & Drama)\n\nPerformance and Protest: Theatre, Politics, and Activism in America (Theatre & Drama)\n\nBlack Artists & Designers (Art, Art History, & Architecture)\n\nPan-Africanism in Art and Literature (Art, Art History, & Architecture)\n\nAfrocentric Architecture (Art, Art History, & Architecture)\n\nJuneteenth and Folklore (Folklore)\n\nBlack History Month Streaming and DVD Resources (Media Services)\n\nYouth Materials on Africa & African Identity (Education Library)\n\nYouth Materials on African American Identity (Education Library)\n\nYouth Materials on Afro-Latine Identity (Education Library)\n\nIn recognition and celebration of Black History Month in February, we have created a series of curated playlists designed to celebrate the voices, innovations, and influence of black artists and musicians across music history.\n\nThe first in our series of playlists, titled “Masterpiece,” explores a variety of genres and musical movements traditionally recognized as being driven by black artistry and innovation, genres that provide a space for the voices of black artists to be heard and celebrated. This playlist focuses on key figures in pop, jazz, soul, funk, r&b, and hip hop, spanning from the mid-20th century to the present day.\n\nIn addition to this more general playlist, we also created three other playlists that offer deep dives into genres where black voices and influence are often obscured or overlooked: including rock music, celebrating black pioneers in punk, metal, and other rock music movements; folk and country, where black contributions to the evolution of folk and country music into popular culture is centered; and electronic, where we highlight key black contributors to the evolution of electronic music in all its many sub-genres.\n\nProvided in tandem with these playlists are library and freely available resources to aid in the further exploration and celebration of black contributions to contemporary popular music and culture.\n\nResources for Further Exploration\n\nArchives of African American Music and Culture (AAAMC at IU) Repository of materials covering a range of African American musical idioms and cultural expressions from the post-World War II era\n\nBlack Grooves Music review site hosted by the Archives of African American Music & Culture (AAAMC) at Indiana University\n\nThe Black Music History Library A living collection of books, articles, documentaries, series, podcasts and more about the Black origins of traditional and popular music dating from the 18th century to present day.\n\n\" History of Black Music in America\" A series of livestreamed discussions on Black Music in the United States, from Serato\n\nBeyond the Playlist\n\nAs with many of these national commemorations, one month is never enough time to fully honor and celebrate the history and culture of marginalized communities, let alone heal the legacies (and ongoing reality) of harm they've experienced. We recognize that there is much more to be done, that racism and anti-blackness can't be eliminated simply through the creation of resource guides, and that the work of realizing justice won't soon be over. But nevertheless, we keep trying, contributing how we can and building upon the efforts of those who came before us, and we continue to learn from and with one another.\n\nIf you'd like to engage more deeply with Black History Month, the IU Libraries Arts & Humanities department has created a number of interrelated resources and features to provide more holistic coverage of this remembering. You'll find those, below:\n\nBlack Histories & Futures Month (Media Studies)\n\nBlack LGBTQ+ Poetry (Gender Studies)\n\nBlack Philosophy & Thought (Philosophy)\n\nIn Memoriam: bell hooks (Philosophy)\n\nLocal Black History (Race, Migration, & Indigeneity)\n\nBlack American Poets and Poetry, 1770-Present (Literature)\n\nBlack Freedom Movements in American History (History)\n\nContemporary Black Playwrights You Should Know (Theatre & Drama)\n\nPerformance and Protest: Theatre, Politics, and Activism in America (Theatre & Drama)\n\nBlack Artists & Designers (Art, Art History, & Architecture)\n\nPan-Africanism in Art and Literature (Art, Art History, & Architecture)\n\nAfrocentric Architecture (Art, Art History, & Architecture)\n\nJuneteenth and Folklore (Folklore)\n\nBlack History Month Streaming and DVD Resources (Media Services)\n\nYouth Materials on Africa & African Identity (Education Library)\n\nYouth Materials on African American Identity (Education Library)\n\nYouth Materials on Afro-Latine Identity (Education Library)\n\nAnd for all things Black culture, you can never go wrong with the resources, services, and collections of the Neal-Marshall Black Culture Center Library."
