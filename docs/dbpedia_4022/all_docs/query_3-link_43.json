        "text": "There is a budding mutual admiration society inside the Giants’ defensive line room.\n\nDefensive coordinator Patrick Graham, a former defensive line coach himself, is a frequent visitor to the position meetings. A welcomed-guest, for a position group expected to be the deepest and most talented on the roster.\n\nSign up for Giants Extra: Get exclusive news, behind-the-scenes observations and the ability to text directly with reporters\n\nIn a pivotal season for Leonard Williams, playing on the franchise tag, Graham’s influence could hold the key to finally unlocking the former first-round pick’s potential.\n\n“I love the scheme,” Williams said on a recent video conference with reporters. “Pat Graham, I feel like he’s a genius when it comes to x’s and o’s and stuff like that.”\n\nWilliams, set to count $16.2 million against the cap this season, produced just 48 pressures on 466 pass-rush snaps, and only had one sack in a Giants uniform after being acquired in exchange for third-round and fifth-round picks in a trade deadline deal with the Jets.\n\nGraham has high expectations for Williams as an anchor along the line that includes Dexter Lawrence and Dalvin Tomlinson.\n\n“From afar, I know he has been a productive player in this league,” Graham said Tuesday. “He’s a big body who has athleticism, plays with his hands, affects the passer and plays in the run game. He can move up and down the line, so right there is a big smile that comes on my face when you are dealing with someone like that. You can’t wait to get your hands on him and just get out to the field and see what he can do and be able to coach him.”\n\nGraham plans to employ multiple fronts, giving 4-3 looks as well as 3-4 fronts, and of course a healthy amount of snaps in the nickel. Figuring out how to thrive in all of it, is something Williams has already shown Graham he has a hunger to do.\n\n“The thing that stood out for me from Leonard is the fact that he’s very inquisitive,” Graham explained. “He wants to know why he should be thinking that, what he should be thinking here. Asking our opinions, whether it’s me or Coach Spence, just talking to us in terms of how to be a better player. So far, he has been working really hard, he’s been really diligent in the classroom.”\n\nTaking those lessons from the classroom to the field, whenever Williams gets back in action following a hamstring injury that has sent him to the non-football injury list, will likely determine whether Williams has a long-term future with the Giants and if he can take the steps necessary to become one of the league’s elite defensive linemen.\n\nHe’s out to prove he belongs in that realm.\n\n“I definitely still feel like I’m playing with a chip on my shoulder,” Williams said. “At the same time, though. I’m ready to just go out here and play the best that I can. It starts today. It starts one day at a time.”\n\nGet Giants text messages: Cut through the clutter of social media and text directly with beat writers. Plus, exclusive news and analysis.
