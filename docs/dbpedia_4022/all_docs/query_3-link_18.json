        "text": "Trusts and estates law has a reputation for being a rather dull and static practice area.\n\nBut Graham Leonard, an associate at Harter Secrest & Emery LLP, considers the field “quite a dynamic practice.”\n\nLawmakers in some states are considering legislation to allow for digital wills. In New York state, the original paper version of a will takes precedent, and a “signing ceremony” with two witnesses is required.\n\n“But now there’s a push to create this digital will, which could fundamentally change the way that wills are signed,” said Leonard, 34.\n\nConservative practitioners fear that digital wills could “really open the door for potential undue influence, depending on how the digital wills are to work,” he said. “I think we need to be really careful about how those wills are signed and actually become valid wills.”\n\nBefore joining Harter Secrest & Emery in August, Leonard was an associate at Hodgson Russ LLP in Buffalo. He moved to Rochester with fiancé Eliza Pope-Collins, a resident at the Strong Memorial Hospital.\n\nHe grew up in Henderson Harbor, Jefferson County. Starting in 2008, after graduating from SUNY Albany, Leonard spent about two years as an Americorps worker at the Western New York Law Center, a non-profit law firm in Buffalo.\n\nThe center provided free legal services for people having their homes foreclosed on; Leonard’s job was to collect data for a foreclosure study.\n\nAfter completing the Americorps assignment, Leonard worked as a paralegal at the center, then went to the University at Buffalo School of Law.\n\n“What drew me into the law initially was the opportunity to work with people who really needed help and didn’t have anyone else who could help them,” Leonard said. “So now I try to do as much pro bono work as I can in addition to the work that I do here.”\n\nBefore entering law school, two close relatives dies unexpectedly, and that experience ultimately led him to work in trusts and estates.\n\n“They didn’t have plans in place, so it made what was already a really difficult situation for my family all the worse because, in addition to being sad that we had lost loved ones, there was also uncertainty about what would happen,” he said.\n\n“I developed this sense that maybe I can help people who are in this position figure out a way through it and prevent people from even being in this position at all by putting plans in place,” he said.\n\nThat is often more involved than simply preparing a will.\n\nIn most cases, married people own major assets jointly with their spouse and spouses are routinely designated as the beneficiary for any financial assets that are not held jointly.\n\nWhen one spouse dies and the other inherits all the assets, the transfer usually goes relatively smoothly.\n\nBut that’s when the will of the surviving spouse becomes critical, Leonard said.\n\n“Where the will really comes into its own is after the second death, because then property most often passes to the children,” he said. “That’s when you need to coordinate your beneficiary designations, your transfer on death forms, and your property, so that all property goes into that trust for a kid, if you’re creating one.”\n\nThe practice area also is becoming more complex because of the growing diversity in the types of assets people own.\n\n“As we become an increasingly digital society … many of us have social media profiles, many of us access our financial records online, and some of us even have assets themselves that are digital in nature, like cryptocurrency. Trusts and estates practice needs to account for all those things,” Leonard said.\n\nLeonard became a lawyer “because it’s one of those professions where you can work directly with people and really have an impact,” he said.\n\nAs an undergraduate he was considering law school, “but before I took the plunge, I wanted to dip my toe in, which is why I did the Americorps term,” he said. “Within a couple weeks of working there, I knew that it was what I wanted to do.”\n\ni"
