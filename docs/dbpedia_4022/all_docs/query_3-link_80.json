        "text": "Tickets On Sale For March Performances\n\nWhen a cast of “has-been” actors and a “washed up” director attempt to revive their careers by staging a mediocre play on a shoe-string budget, murder ensues. The cast of Drop Dead! will take the Bucyrus Little Theatre stage March 8-10 and March 15-17, 2024.\n\nDirected by Jason Chandler, Drop Dead! is a full-length comedic murder mystery that features local actors Tim Lutz, Matthew (Lee) Sterling, Joseph Loftis, Dodi Conkel, Billie Weiland, Randy Mann, Karellyn Sterling, Graham Leonard, Curtis Ashley, and Abbey Kanellakis. The show, written by Billy Van Zandt and Jane Milmore, is presented by arrangement with Concord Theatricals on behalf of Samuel French, Inc. Please note that this show contains mature language and themes. Parental discretion is advised.\n\n“This show has it all,” said Chandler. “There are so many really funny moments that will have you doubling over in laughter. Each actor in this cast has really gone above and beyond. It’s not easy to play a character who is playing another character - but they nail it. It’s very well executed.”\n\nTickets are $15 for adults and $10 for students. However, parental discretion is advised as the show contains mature language and themes. Friday and Saturday performances begin at 7:30 p.m. while Sunday performances start at 2:30 p.m. More information about the show and to purchase tickets, visit www.BucyrusLittleTheatre.com. Additionally, the box office will be open for advance ticket sales 6-8 p.m. Monday, March 4, and Monday, March 11. Tickets will also be available at the door on a first come, first served basis.\n\nCall the Bucyrus Little Theatre at 419.562.0731 with questions about the performance, special accommodations, or for assistance pertaining to your online ticket purchase.\n\nAbout Bucyrus Little Theatre\n\nFounded in 1951, the Bucyrus Little Theatre exists to provide cultural enrichment, education, and entertainment to Bucyrus and the surrounding communities.
