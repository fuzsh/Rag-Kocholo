        "text": "It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of one of our founder and longest members, Graham Leonard G4DDN.\n\nUp until only a few weeks ago Graham was still enjoying and following his passion for Amatuer Radio, a hobby and activity that he had enjoyed since working with RADAR technology and equipment during his time in the RAF.\n\nIt has been heart-warming to see so many tributes, dedications and memories sent to us at the club from radio amateurs across the country who had the pleasure of meeting and knowing Graham throughout the years. Many of the memories recall the encouragement, help and kindness offered by Graham to help them get started or to overcome problems with maintaining and operating their kit. A great many recall the shared field days and radio activities that they worked alongside Graham.\n\nThank you to Patricia, Grahams Daughter, for including so many of his amateur radio friends and colleagues in his funeral to give him a final 73.\n\nRest in Peace Graham\n\nA copy of the Order of Service, together with a special tribute from Sam Jewell and tributes and memories from some of Grahamâ€™s friends from the Amateur Radio community can be viewed and downloaded below."
