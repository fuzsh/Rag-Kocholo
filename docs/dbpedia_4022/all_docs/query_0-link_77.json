        "text": "Graham studied fine art and advertising at Cardiff College of Art before commencing a successful career in advertising that spanned over 30 years, working as a creative in Wales, Manchester and the Midlands, culminating as Creative Director for several major ad agencies in Birmingham creating campaigns for national and international consumer and industrial brand leaders. Painting fulltime since 1995 his main interest is in landscape using acrylic on panel which allows a variety of techniques to be employed, including the lightness of watercolour to impasto as used with oils, “it is the combination of subject matter, atmospherics and surface treatment that fuels my passion for the visual and drives my desire to create.” Elected to full member in 2011 he regularly exhibits at the gallery, gaining a number of awards and prizes over the years, and has also shown work at Himley Hall Dudley, Derby Museum, Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery, Broadway Arts Festival, Broadway Museum & Art Gallery and the Royal West of England Academy, Bristol. His work is held in private collections in the UK and abroad."
