        "text": "Holy Dot Day, Batman!\n\nIf you managed to read the whole title of this post, you know we have a lot on the agenda for today! And it all has to do with dots – either directly or in a more roundabout way 🙂\n\nWe’ll start with Perfect Picture Books, which I like to put on top so it’s easy to find when people click over from the master list. I’ve chosen a book about a dog with spots… which are a lot like dots.\n\nNext up will be my Dot for International Dot Day.\n\nFinally, just when you think you can’t bear the suspense for another second, I will announce the winner of the Summer Send-Off Contest… before you go dotty! (OK. That was a reach :))\n\nReady? Set. GO!\n\nHarry The Dirty Dog\n\nWritten By: Gene Zion\n\nIllustrated By: Margaret Bloy Graham\n\nHarper & Row, 1956, Fiction\n\nSuitable For: ages 3-8\n\nThemes/Topics: bath time, behavior (rebelliousness), facing consequences, problem solving, animals (dogs)\n\nOpening: “Harry was a white dog with black spots who liked everything, except… getting a bath. So one day when he heard the water running in the tub, he took the scrubbing brush… and buried it in the back yard.”\n\nBrief Synopsis: Harry doesn’t want a bath, so he hides the scrubbing brush and runs away. All day long he plays happily, getting dirtier and dirtier, until finally, when he returns home, he’s so dirty his family doesn’t even recognize him. What’s a dog to do?\n\nLinks To Resources: Harry The Dirty Dog Activities, Harry The Dirty Dog read by Betty White with pictures and tasteful animation (delightful!) as well as activities.\n\nWhy I Like This Book: I not only like this book, I love it. I loved it as a child. I loved it with my children. I love it as a writer because to me it’s a story that does everything right. I think children (and adults :)) can relate to Harry’s story because we all have the urge to rebel from time to time but, like Harry, in the end what we want most is to be safe and loved… even if it means having a bath 🙂 The art is delightful, depicting Harry as lively and lovable, culminating in the sweet last page where Harry is curled up, happily asleep and dreaming, but leaving you to wonder whether he hid that scrubbing brush to make sure he was always clean so his family would always recognize him, or whether he hid it to avoid another bath any time soon 🙂\n\nFor the complete list of books with resources, please visit Perfect Picture Books.\n\nMoving on, it’s time to celebrate International Dot Day!\n\nFollowing the lead of Patricia Tilton on her wonderful blog Children’s Books Heal, I am joining in on International Dot Day, based on Peter H. Reynolds’ picture book The Dot. The idea is to encourage people not to be intimidated and to create their own art in the form of a dot. This year over half a million people will participate – primarily children in classrooms – but lots of other people as well. Celebri-dots features dots created by well-known authors and illustrators. (Dot Day is actually September 15, but I don’t post on Saturday so mine is going up today :))\n\nI am not particularly artistic, but I had an idea for a dot. The lovely and talented Beth Stilborn, whose computer skills leave mine in the dust, turned my idea into reality. Thank you, Beth! 🙂\n\nMy dot is about love.\n\nLove comes in many shapes and sizes. For my daughter it comes in the shape of a polka-dot pony. The pony is not fancy or highly bred. She’s 14.1 hands* of fine, cinnamon chip fur, with a sturdy build, a velvet-soft nose, one brown eye and one blue, and though she might not appear to be anything special, she owns my daughter’s heart. And it just so happens that two of those cinnamon dots that sprinkle her fur so liberally are heart shaped. I am not making this up. You can see one of them in the dot 🙂\n\n* (for those who might not be horse people, a hand is the unit of measure for horses and is equal to 4″. 14.1 hands means that the pony stands 57″ at the withers.)\n\nAnd just for fun, another dot… 🙂\n\nHere is the special pony those dots and that heart belong to 🙂\n\nmy daughter counted the pony’s spots one day and in case you’re wondering, she has 791! 🙂\n\nand the poem my daughter wrote about her:\n\nChestnut, chestnut, chestnut spots\n\nAppaloosa polka-dots.\n\nHow many little chestnut spots?\n\nLots and lots and lots and lots!\n\nby Little Hill 5\n\nSo there you have it. My polka-dot pony love dot 🙂\n\nSo I guess that’s it, right? We’ll wrap up and head out to read everyone’s Perfect Picture Books….\n\nWhat?\n\nOH! You want to know who won the contest?\n\nWell. Okay 🙂\n\nI’ve got to tell you, somehow this turned out to be the closest contest we’ve ever had here and that’s saying something because everyone is so talented that the contests are always close. In this case, however, the contestants were literally neck and neck. First one would pull ahead, then another. It was a serious nail-biter! In the end though, we did have a clear winner. And that was…\n\nDDRRUUMM RROOLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!\n\nCongratulations, Erik! Well done!\n\nAnd to all the other finalists, excellent job as well. And to everyone who entered, you are all amazingly talented and creative people and it was a joy to read every single entry! Thanks to everyone for participating.\n\nErik, you may email me at your convenience and choose your prize 🙂 And since we only had 15 entries, I’m only giving a prize for first place. (If we’d had over 20 entries I would have included 2nd and 3rd place prizes, but now you’ll just have to wait for the Halloweensie Contest on October 31st for that! :))\n\nAlthough I don’t usually add the placement of all the finalists, in this case it was such a close race that I thought you (and they) might like to know how well they did:\n\n1st: Erik\n\n2nd: Sidney\n\n3rd: Vivian\n\n4th: Romelle\n\n5th: TIE: Jess and Lauri\n\nSo now, my lovelies, if all the PPBF bloggers would kindly leave their post specific links in the list below, we shall all come visit – the best part of Friday 🙂\n\nHave a great weekend, everyone! 🙂"
