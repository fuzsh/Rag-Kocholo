        "text": "A pair of jacks could lead to a good hand in cards. A sophomore wrestler named after a pair of Jacks has helped uplift the Louisville program.\n\nEarning a varsity starting spot as a freshman last season, sophomore Jax Leonard has developed into a dangerous middle weight for the Leopards, who are getting closer to capturing a Northeastern Buckeye Conference championship in the final year of its existence.\n\nLeonard, who bumps back and forth between 145 and 152 pounds, has been a force since he became a starter and his level of excellence was on display at the Eastern Ohio Wrestling League Tournament in Austintown Fitch last weekend.\n\nCompeting at 145 pounds, Leonard survived and advanced against every opponent he faced, winning an individual title convincingly. For wrestling at a high level in multiple matches over a two-day time period, Leonard was named The Review Male Athlete of the Week.\n\n“We've got some great coaches who push us, encourage us and challenge us, even during a match,” Leonard smiled. “When I'm out on the mat, I can hear two of them yelling, but it’s encouraging words, not anything negative.”\n\nLeonard fulfilled Louisville head coach Rocky Laughlin's pre-EOWL matchup strategy, winning four 145-pound matches decisively. He opened the tournament with a 5-0 decision over Austintown Fitch's Caleb Crawford, handing his opponent a defeat in his own building. His second-round match was against West Branch's Brock Wilke and the result was a 12-4 major decision, Leonard pinned Alliance's Zach Rodgers in the championship semifinals and claimed the title with a 9-3 decision over Beaver Local's Beau Smith.\n\n“We never wrestled in this tournament before, but it was good for me because I got four matches and faced some very good competition,” Leonard said. “Wilke was very strong. Rodgers was a little taller but talented. Beau Smith is very good and I only beat him in the last seconds in our previous match.”\n\nLeonard and Smith tangled in a state dual between Louisville and Beaver Local at Canfield. Smith was more than a worthy opponent, but Leonard recorded a 12-9 win at the state dual. Recalling what Smith did in their first match, Leonard was more aggressive offensively and solid defensively in their EOWL final and secured a 9-3 decision.\n\n“Smith has super strong hips and I remember him throwing me a couple of times at the state dual, so I was prepared for that,” Leonard grinned. “I had better balance and was able to (counter) better. On one takedown, he tried a lateral drop and I just sunk my hips and got a single-leg takedown against him.”\n\nLeonard laughed when asked about his unusual first name, explaining the reasoning behind it.\n\n“I had two uncles named Jack and my parents really liked and respected both of them, so they decided to name me after both of them,” Leonard added. “They just decided to spell my first name Jax, instead of Jacks.”\n\nLeonard followed another family member into wrestling. Jimmy Leonard, his older brother, was one of seven seniors on last year's Louisville team, which included a strong freshman class. Jax Leonard was one of the first-year wrestlers who impacted the program immediately. Logan Vanicek, Carter Mickley, Brent Paulus and Blake Robbins were four others.\n\nJimmy Leonard, who competed at 195 pounds, was an outstanding wrestler for the Leopards last year and showed a good work ethic and provided a positive influence for the freshman class, including his younger brother.\n\n“It was good getting a chance to wrestle on the same team with Jimmy,” Jax Leonard said. “He's not (around) to help me, since he enlisted in the service, but he's been a great inspiration by (voluntarily) serving his country. Even though he's not here, he's still encouraging me.”\n\nWith senior Ryan Jakubiak an exception, Louisville has an even younger team this season. Another freshmen class, headed by Garett Lautzenheiser and Davin Rhoads, who joined Leonard as an EOWl individual champion after winning the 120-pound title, adds another layer to the foundation set by Laughlin and his staff.\n\n“Lautzenheiser, Rhoads and other guys like Daniel Kennedy have really stepped up and have made us better,” Leonard said.\n\nSo has a demanding schedule, which included a trip to St. Paris and a recent dual match against state and national power Graham. Leonard accredited himself against Joey Sanchez in a 152-pound match, losing by decision.\n\n“It was different and surreal, going down there,” Leonard said. “You're in the country and the town finally pops up. You go into the school and there is a wrestling atmosphere in it. You look around and see all of their great teams. It was a great experience.”\n\nAnd Leonard hopes that trip to Graham and an EOWL title will be followed by many more positive experiences the rest of the season."
