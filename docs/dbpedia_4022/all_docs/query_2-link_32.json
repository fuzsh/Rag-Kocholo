        "text": "We lost an avid outdoorsman and people person this week. Leonard Eugene Graham joined God in Heaven on Tuesday, April 8, 2014. A memorial service was held April 15 at the United Methodist Church in Winslow.\n\nHe was born August 13, 1926, to George Graham and Edith Nelson Graham, in Garden City, Kan.\n\nLeonard attended Deerfield High School in Kansas, where he played basketball, graduating in 1944.\n\nA year later he married his beloved Alice Walters Graham on Sept. 30, 1945.\n\nHe supported his family as a farmer from 1944 to 1958, on 1,200 acres in western Kansas, gaining three children along the way.\n\nIn 1958 he moved his family to Denver, Colo., where he attended Denver University for a year, refining his accounting and marketing skills. The family then moved to Montrose, Colo., where he became the manager of a farm cooperative and lived for four years. From there, in 1962, they moved to Delta, Colo., where he began selling insurance with the National Farmers Union Life Insurance Company. He kept his insurance license active ever since. His three children graduated high school in Delta.\n\nIn 1966 the family moved back to Denver, and Leonard became the district manager for National Farmers Union Insurance Company there for five years.\n\nLeonard and Alice came to Winslow in 1971, and together sold mobile homes and managed mobile home parks for over 40 years. He served 16 years on the city council, including two years as vice mayor of the City of Winslow. He spent six years on the Winslow Senior Citizens Board, and also delivered Meals on Wheels for six years.\n\nHe was active in the Winslow United Methodist Church as a member of the board of trustees, and he sang as a tenor in the choir along with Alice, who was a soprano. He was also a member of the Winslow Elks Lodge and the Winslow Chamber of Commerce. He was part of the Northland Pioneer College Foundation Board for 18 years.\n\nEver the outdoorsman, Leonard enjoyed swimming, skiing, snowmobiling, boating, golfing and fishing.\n\nTwo days following his death, his beloved Alice Graham joined him in the arms of our Lord.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his three brothers and his parents.\n\nSurvivors include his three children, Susan Lawler, Max Graham and Ted Graham, and their spouses; six granddaughters; six great-grandchildren; four nephews and their spouses; one niece; and many beloved cousins."
