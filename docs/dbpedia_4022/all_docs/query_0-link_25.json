Faithfully serving his communion for many years, he became the Bishop of London, in 1981. For many years he was an outspoken critic of the novel doctrines and practices, which were arising in the Church of England. After his retirement, he was received into full-communion with the Catholic Church, in 1993. He was conditionally ordained a Catholic Priest in 1994 and granted the title of Monsignor, by St. John Paul II, in 2000. Msgr. Graham Leonard departed to the Lord on January 6, 2010."
