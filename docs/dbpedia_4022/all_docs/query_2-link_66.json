        "text": "I first laid eyes on Jon Dee Graham on April 16, 1984. He was 25. I was 23.\n\nWe were at the Ritz, a giant rock club in Manhattan’s East Village. Jon Dee was playing in a band from Austin, Tex., called the True Believers, who were opening for Los Lobos. I am impatient with opening acts, and I was prepared as always to dislike whatever this thing called the True Believers would turn out to be.\n\nThen they came out on stage and blew my hair back. The Troobs, as their fans called them, were a roaring, three-guitar army like nothing I’d heard since Skynyrd’s plane went down. But these guys had done time in punk-rock bands. They united the Athens weirdness I had loved in college with the three-guitar stomp that stayed in my eight-track player all through high school.\n\nWhat I remember liking about Jon Dee Graham was that even though he could clearly play like hell, he never showed off. His solos always served the song.\n\nThen, over the next few years, the rest of the world and I pretty much forgot about the True Believers.\n\nThirteen years later, I wandered into the Star Community Bar in Atlanta to see a singer and songwriter from Austin named Kelly Willis. I asked a friend, “Is anybody opening?” Came the answer: “Some guy named Jon Dee Graham.”\n\nI thought, “Well, this is gonna suck.” In my experience as a music nerd, I have rarely seen a great guitar player and a great songwriter occupy the same body. With rare exception, the guys who sling great guitar solos can’t write great words to save their lives, and vice-versa. That’s why they need each other.\n\nWhen the 38-year-old Jon Dee Graham walked onto the tiny stage, I stood my 36-year-old self out on the floor and waited for him to bore me.\n\nHe sat in a chair, delicately finger-picking his acoustic guitar. Then he began to sing in a voice so gruff it sounded almost threatening, but what came out was so tender:\n\nHe kept playing and began to moan. His voice carried the melody, but it sounded like the roar of a wounded lion. Then he played a gentle A-flat chord and delivered the only line in the song’s chorus.\n\nAll my angels have gone home; can we use yours?\n\nI was floored. A story of a man and his son on a bus trip going somewhere. A story of the wonder that lives in the eyes of children only. But the father is in pain. For whatever reason, his own angels have exited the scene. But he looks at his son and sees a reason to be faithful and to hope that the angels might, just might come back.\n\nIt was a story that could wind its way off for thousands of words, for two dozen chapters.\n\nBut Jon Dee Graham told it in one verse and a chorus. One minute and 25 seconds. Five lines. Forty-three words and one long moan. For the record, that’s only 64 percent of the words it took me to describe the song to you just now.\n\nIn the art of American songwriting, where economy of language is so precious, that’s about as good as it gets.\n\nAt the end of the night, Jon Dee stood at the end of the bar selling copies of his first solo record, “Escape From Monster Island.” The first song on the record was “$100 Bill.” I bought two copies. One of my dearest friends and fellow music nerds, Martin Flaherty, had seen his son Michael enter the world only months earlier, and I knew Martin had to hear this record, with its tales of a father and young son. “Escape From Monster Island” became a little landmark of our long friendship.\n\nJon Dee was pleasant enough, shook my hand and thanked me for buying the CDs.\n\nI walked out into the fall chill on Moreland Avenue. I might as well admit it. That’s the night I began stalking Jon Dee Graham.\n\nIf you are interested in learning about the craft of songwriting, you have an advantage when someone you believe is among America’s best songwriters sleeps on your couch when he comes through town.\n\nRecently, I decided to use this advantage, so I got Jon Dee on the phone. We spent a couple of hours talking about songwriting. It did not surprise me that he started by talking about the value of economy.\n\n“The thing about a song is: You've got all this structure but none of the real estate,” he says. “It's very little space that you've got to work with, and so it's like every fucking word has weight. Early on, I figured out that the song is a delivery system, just like the missile that delivers the warhead. It’s like, how much information can you convey in the delivery system? That sounds kind of clinical, and I swear to you that ‘clinical’ is not the word to use for how I work. It's not clinical; it's fucking bloody. But I did figure something out pretty early on. I'd write something and go, ‘Wow, that's just so clever or beautiful.’ Or, ‘Look at the internal rhyme here.’ And then I’d go, ‘It has to die.’ I had to take it out. Because as beautiful as it is, it doesn't carry enough information.”\n\nThe ability to look at one’s own work and pare it back to its essence is difficult to develop. Anyone who creates things knows this. It’s an idea that’s even begun to spill over into the business community. A Wharton School grad named Matthew May, who runs an “ideas agency” in California, wrote a book a couple of years ago called “The Laws of Subtraction: 6 Simple Rules for Winning in the Age of Excess Everything.”\n\nMay probably makes scads more money than Graham ever will, but I wonder which one could teach the other more about the laws of subtraction.\n\nIf you parse the verse above from Graham’s “Butterfly Wing,” you will notice that it has a grand total of seven words. Each of them is repeated as many as a half-dozen times, and only the final word — “that” — is used just once. I’m not trying to reduce songwriting to mathematics here, because that can’t be done, but putting the words of “Butterfly Wing” into a spreadsheet seems to magnify what a marvel of verbal economy the song actually is.\n\nThe song is three verses, one of which is repeated. Verse 2 uses only nine words and Verse 3 just six. The entire song is constructed of just 19 words.\n\nOf course, such a delivery system, no matter how mathematically elegant, is only as powerful as the weapon it delivers.\n\n“Butterfly Wing” consists essentially of three lines.\n\nShe’s as pretty as a butterfly wing. She’s as pretty as that.\n\nI ain’t talkin’ about what I deserve. I ain’t talkin’ about that.\n\nI’m as happy as a dog in the yard. I’m as happy as that.\n\nThe narrator marvels at the exquisite beauty of the woman he’s with, who makes him as happy as a dog in the yard. Yet he questions, somewhere inside himself, whether he deserves such happiness.\n\nA completely universal experience, one all of us encounter at some time in life, captured in 19 words. If he could manage to trim 44 characters from it, he could tweet the whole damned thing.\n\n“There’s not one fucking lyric that I've recorded anywhere that I cringe when I hear it now,” Jon Dee says. “Not one. Some are better than others, but there's not one that I'm embarrassed about.”\n\nIt’s no wonder. Turns out you can learn the laws of subtraction at Wharton, or you can learn them the Jon Dee Graham way.\n\nBut take caution: The latter would probably hurt more.\n\nEvery Wednesday night when they’re both in Austin, Jon Dee Graham and James McMurtry, the songwriting son of “Lonesome Dove” author Larry McMurtry, play the Continental Club with their full bands. Sometimes, they go on tour together. “We spend a lot of time with each other,” Jon Dee says.\n\n“We were over in Germany one time, and we were talking about songwriting,” he says. “We were both a little lit at that point, and I said to McMurtry, ‘You know what, I wish I could write the way you do. I wish I could just imagine people who have never lived, just think about them doing things that have never happened.’ He looked at me and he went, ‘Well, I wouldn’t mind writing like you write, except I wouldn’t like having to bleed to death on stage every night.’\n\n“But that’s the deal. That’s the price comes with it,” he continues. “Every time I sing ‘$100 Bill,’ I’m back on that bus. I’m just laying it all out there and I’m living it and I’m singing it and it’s literally like opening up my chest and going, ‘Here it is. Here’s what happened. Here’s how it felt.’”\n\nPicturing the pleasure that might have come from a trip up into the Hill Country with his son to see the Christmas lights, I say, “I expect that’s a fairly pleasant place to be.”\n\n“Actually,” he replies, “at the time I felt like I was going to die. At the time, I thought that it was the most painful, horrible place where I could possibly be.”\n\nThe origins of a story are rarely as simple as the story itself. The song came from a Christmastime trip in 1995. Graham had recently seen his first marriage break up, and he had moved from California back to Texas with Roy, who was 3 years old, to start over.\n\n“It was like, ‘Oh my god, my marriage is gone. I’ve gone back to Texas to start over with nothing but nine hundred-dollar bills and I’ve got to build a life here all over again with a 3-year-old, which was unthinkable, just fucking unthinkable,’” he says. “We were going to see my sister, and everyone was sort of viewing me with horror. Mine was the first divorce in the family, and I was so destitute. I had to ride the Greyhound bus to see them. I was sort of acting like everything was fine, but it was really clear that nothing was fine.\n\n“But I remember we were on our way back to Austin, and he was asleep in my lap. I’m looking at him and I’m thinking, ‘At this point, I’ve used up all of my ideas.’ But I looked down at him and I thought, ‘He’s got some luck in him. Maybe we could survive on his luck for a while.”\n\nAnd so they did. Which is why the song connects with such force. It’s not just a song of a pleasant trip with your kid. It’s a song about overwhelming fear and uncertainty, underneath which shines a faint glimmer of hope. And as a song, its power comes from Jon Dee’s ability to distill fear and hope into a single line.\n\nAll my angels have gone home, now let’s use yours.\n\n“I’ve been having this talk with a friend of mine, one of my grown-man friends, about this concept of the unthinkable,” Jon Dee says. “It’s like, if you live long enough, you will be asked to do the unthinkable. It touches every man in a different way, and it comes at different points in their lives. Your father’s dying and you have to stay there as it happens. Or you have to surrender your child. Or you have to go to the pen. Whatever it is that’s unthinkable waiting for you, what defines us is how we handle the unthinkable.”\n\nLooking back on his bus trip with Roy, now almost 20 years ago, he says, “That was just my first unthinkable. Yet on the other side of it, when I look back, it’s like, you know, you’re getting up every day and doing the unthinkable, and pretty soon it isn’t unthinkable anymore. And in fact, with hindsight, the unthinkable actually turns out to be fairly beautiful.”"
