Ordination in the Roman Catholic Church

An outspoken critic of moves to ordain women to the priesthood within the Anglican Communion, Leonard eventually left the Church of England to become a Roman Catholic and, on 23 April 1994, he was conditionally ordained as a priest (but not as a bishop) in the Roman Catholic Church. Although the Roman Catholic Church still does not recognise the validity of Anglican ordinations, Leonard's ordination was conditional due to there being "prudent doubt" about the invalidity of his previous ordination in the Church of England. [ [http://www.angelfire.com/nj/malleus/hume_statement.html Statement of Cardinal Hume on the ordination of Anglican bishop Graham Leonard as a Roman Catholic priest] ] Leonard claims that he was not firstly also ordained a deacon and has said the Pope's personal instruction was that he should be ordained immediately to the priesthood 'sub conditione'. He was later appointed a Papal Chaplain with the title Monsignor and then a Prelate of Honour by Pope John Paul II on 3 August 2000.

Family

Brother-in-law to Michael Swann, Lord Swann of Coln St Denys, and Hugh Swann, cabinet maker to Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, having married their sister, Priscilla Swann. Monsignor and Mrs Leonard have two sons.
