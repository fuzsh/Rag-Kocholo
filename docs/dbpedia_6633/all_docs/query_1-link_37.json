        "text": "Amazon Kids+ recruits Craig Hunter\n\nThe YouTube alum quietly joined the streamerâ€™s LA-based team as a senior creative executive in June.\n\nAmazon Is Reportedly Giving Up On Original Kids' Series\n\nAmazon Studios is pivoting from kids' content to series for older and broader audiences.\n\nI don't know much about Craig Hunter's work, but it seems pretty well received. Hopefully, he can help Amazon take kids shows more seriously again.\n\nI thought Amazon would stop with kids shows entirely\n\nIt's true kids aren't watching as much TV these days, but at the same time, Amazon can't completely quit kids because they have lots of free time to watch stuff and disposable income to buy stuff; they're too valuable to walk away from altogether. Thus they're now saying that going forward they'll be targeting a broad family audience while not zeroing in on kids specifically. \"We're not aiming our content directly at kids, but it's OK if they want to watch.\""
