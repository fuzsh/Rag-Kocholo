        "text": "Chair, Chief Executive\n\nSaban Capital Group\n\nSaban is an Israeli-American investor and entertainment mogul who over the last four decades built numerous media and telecommunication businesses. Originally born in Alexandria, Egypt, Saban immigrated to Israel at the age of 12. In 1975 he relocated to France where he began a successful independent record company. Eight years later, he moved to Los Angeles and became one of the top suppliers of music for television. By the late 1980’s Saban was directly producing television, including X-Men and shows based on Marvel Comics. He formed the Saban Capital Group in 2001 after selling the global television and production company Family Worldwide to the Walt Disney Co. for $5.2 billion. The investment firm makes minority and controlling investments across a broad portfolio of companies. Through his Saban Family Foundation, the executive has made over $500 million in philanthropic donations. According to the Business Journal’s Wealthiest Angelenos list, Saban is worth $4.5 billion. He is a mega-donor to the Democratic Party, and this February co-hosted a fundraiser that President Joe Biden attended at his home."
