        "text": "Haim Saban\n\nHaim Saban Honored with Star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame\n\nWatch complete ceremony as the Hollywood Chamber honors Haim Saban with Walk of Fame star below.\n\nThe Hollywood Chamber of Commerce proudly honored iconic producer and Power Rangers creator, Haim Sabanwith the 2,605th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame today, Wednesday, March 22nd, at 11:30 a.m. PST. The star in the category of Television was dedicated at 6712 Hollywood Boulevard in front of thehistoric Egyptian Theatre.\n\nHelping Emcee and Hollywood Chamber President/CEO Leron Gubler to unveil the star were Mayor Eric Garcetti, producer and songwriter, David Foster and producer and TV personality, Simon Cowell.\n\nThe Hollywood Chamber of Commerce which administers the popular star ceremonies encourages people who are unable to attend and fans around the world to watch the event live exclusively on www.walkoffame.com.\n\nHaim Saban is the creator and producer of the Power Rangers™, which debuted on American television in 1993. Two decades later, the series is still on air and currently in its 24th season domestically, where it airs on Nickelodeon and also airs globally, making it one of the longest running and most-watched kids actions series in television history. It is also one of the top-selling boy’s action toy products in the United States.\n\nA native of Alexandria, Egypt, Saban immigrated to Israel at the age of 12, attending agricultural school and serving in the Israeli Defense Force. While in Israel, Saban built the country’s premier tour promotion business. In 1975, the Yom Kippur War brought about his relocation to France. There, he established an independent record company which soon catapulted to the top of the European labels industry, selling more than 18-million records over a period of eight years.\n\nLooking to build on his European music industry success, Saban next moved to Los Angeles in 1983, where he launched a chain of recording studios that rapidly became the top supplier of music for television. He would venture into television production in 1988, forming Saban Entertainment, an international television, production, distribution and merchandising company. The company produced several major hits, including The X-Men™ and numerous other shows and products developed around Marvel Comics characters.\n\nMost notably, under Saban’s guidance, the organization introduced to the U.S. the “Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,”™, which quickly became a pop culture phenomenon. Now the iconic brand will be re-imagined in Lionsgate’s highly-anticipated feature film, “Saban’s Power Rangers” hitting theatres March 24, 2017.\n\nSaban also formed Saban Capital Group (SCG) and in 2003, SCG led a group of investors that acquired a controlling stake in ProSiebenSat.1 Media, Germany’s largest broadcasting group. Saban served as ProSiebenSat.1’s Chairman of the Supervisory Board. SCG sold the group’s controlling stake in the company in 2007 to private equity firms KKR and Permira.\n\nIn 2005, SCG teamed with Apax Partners and Arkin Communications to acquire a controlling stake in Bezeq Israeli Telecommunication Corp., Ltd., as part of the government’s privatization of the company. Two years later, SCG teamed with a group of investors to acquire Univision Communications Inc., the premier Spanish-language media company in the U.S., with the number one ranked Spanish-language television network.\n\nThe Saban Family is on BusinessWeek’s list of the 50 most generous philanthropists in the U.S. His fortune also ranks among the world’s top 200 in Forbes Magazine. Saban and his wife Cheryl started the Saban Family Foundation in 1999, which supports medical, children’s and education programs, including the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles, Soroka Children’s Hospital in Israel, the John Wayne Cancer Institute, the Motion Picture and Television Fund, the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, American Israel Education Foundation, William Jefferson Clinton Foundation, and the United Friends of the Children. In 2002, Saban founded the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution and he currently chairs its International Advisory Council.\n\n★★★\n\nABOUT THE HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME www.WalkOfFame.com\n\nThe Hollywood Walk of Fame is an internationally-recognized Hollywood icon.
