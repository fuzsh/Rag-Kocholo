        "text": "What Is Haim Saban's Net Worth?\n\nHaim Saban is an Egyptian-born Israeli-American television and media proprietor, producer, and composer who has a net worth of $3 billion. And that's AFTER Haim has given away around $1 billion to charity to date. Haim Saban made his fortune in television and media as the founder of Saban Entertainment, a television production company. He also composed the theme songs for a number of children's television series, including \"Inspector Gadget\" and \"He-Man,\" in addition to producing Western adaptations of Japanese cartoons such as \"Power Rangers\" and \"VR Troopers.\"\n\nSaban got his first big win with the children's TV show \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\" in the early 1990s. In 2019, Haim sold the Power Rangers' intellectual property rights to Hasbro for $522 million.\n\nIn 2005, Haim sold Fox Family Channel, a joint venture with News Corp., to Disney for $5.3 billion, and in 2007, Saban and a group of private equity investors bought Univision for $13.7 billion, getting a stake that is now worth $600 million. In 2019, Haim launched Saban Music Group, which focuses on \"global artists, particularly those from Latin America, the development of new artists and acquisitions of existing businesses.\" Haim received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2017.\n\nEarly Life\n\nHaim Saban was born on October 15, 1944, in Alexandria, Egypt. He is from an Egyptian-Jewish family, and his family immigrated to Israel in 1956. Haim's parents sent him to a Youth Aliyah boarding school, and after he was expelled, he began attending night school, where he was told by the principal, \"You're not cut out for academic studies; you're cut out for making money.\" Saban later served in the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nMusic Career\n\nHaim's music career began in 1966 as the manager and bassist for the band The Lions of Judah (Ha'arayot). In 1969, Dave Watts of the band The Tornados joined the group, and they traveled to England to perform at London nightclubs. There, The Lions of Judah were signed by Polydor Records, and in July 1969, they performed on \"Colour Me Pop\" on the BBC. After the group returned to Israel, Saban turned his focus to music promotion.\n\nHaim moved to the U.S. in 1983 and became known for composing music for children's TV shows with Shuki Levy. The duo composed music for projects such as \"Dragon Quest,\" \"Inspector Gadget,\" \"She-Ra: Princess of Power,\" and \"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe.\"\n\nHaim was credited with composing 3,700 works at the time, but several composers had alleged a decade earlier that they had written some of that music. Ten different composers threatened to sue him for $1 million, and he stated in the article, \"We settled for $10,000 a pop. They knew they had zero case. They were totally wrong.\"\n\nBy 1999, he netted a reported $2.5 million in royalties from his cartoon theme songs alone.\n\nSaban Entertainment\n\nIn 1988, Haim founded Saban Entertainment. In 1993, Saban had his first huge hit. Eight years earlier, on trip to Japan he saw a footage from a TV show featuring fighting Spandex-clad teenagers. Saban's creative partner wrote a screenplay, and they produced a short film that combined the Japanese footage with newly shot American footage. They called the show \"The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\"\n\nMost people hated the short film. One person did not. That person was the head of the Fox Kids Network. He green-lit a series. Saban Entertainment went on to produce more than 70 projects, including \"A.L.F.,\" \"V.R. Troopers,\" \"Sweet Valley High,\" \"Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog,\" and \"Digimon: Digital Monsters.\" In 1996, Saban Entertainment merged with Fox Children's Network (which was owned by News Corporation) to form Fox Kids Worldwide. In 2001, Haim and News Corporation sold Fox Children's Network to The Walt Disney Company for $5.3 billion, leaving Saban with a profit of around $1.6 billion. Through a complex tax sheltering system arranged by his tax adviser, Saban didn't pay a cent in taxes on the deal.\n\nIn 2003, Haim was the leader of a consortium that acquired a controlling stake in Kirch Media Group's ProSiebenSat.1 Media, which grew to become the largest commercial TV broadcasting company in Germany. In 2007, Saban and the consortium sold their controlling interest in the company for 22.40 euros per share to Permira and KKR; when they acquired their controlling interest in 2003, they paid 7.5 euros per share.\n\nIn 2006, Saban Capital Group and a group of investors including Thomas H. Lee Partners and Texas Pacific Group purchased Univision for $13.7 billion. They sold a 64% stake of Univision to the investment firms Searchlight Capital Partners and ForgeLight LLC in 2020. In 2019, Haim created the Saban Music Group, and he said of the decision, \"Music has always been one of my life's greatest passions — shaping, influencing and motivating me on a daily basis. It is with great excitement that I reenter the music business — not only as a businessman but as someone who is passionate about the art, dedicated to the development of worldwide artists and wants to provide world-class entertainment.\"\n\n$500 Million Hasbro Sale\n\nIn May 2018, Haim agreed to sell all intellectual property rights to his Power Rangers franchise to Hasbro for $522 million in cash and stock.\n\nAs Saban himself put it in a press statement:\n\n\"Twenty-five years after launching Power Rangers, I believe the future for this brand has never been greater. Hasbro's leadership in innovation, storytelling and brand stewardship make it the perfect company to further develop the global reach and appeal of the Power Rangers property.\"\n\nThe deal means that the Power Rangers characters are joining the Hasbro family of toys, which includes other A-list toy properties like Transformers, My Little Pony, Monopoly and Play-Doh. And the deal also includes other less well known properties joining Hasbro's stable: My Pet Monster, Popples, Julius Jr., Luna Petunia and Treehouse Detectives.\n\nPower Rangers purists may be alarmed that Saban is letting go of the property he created from existing Japanese action shows in 1993, but not to worry: He's staying on board \"in a consulting role to further guide our development of this valuable property for the next generation of Power Rangers fans,\" according to Hasbro Chief Executive Brian Goldner.\n\nThe sale of the Power Rangers brand to Hasbro is not the first time Saban has relinquished it to other owners. In 2001, rights to the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers series and its sequels were sold as part of the Fox Family to Disney, but after languishing under the Disney banner it was sold back to Saban in 2010 for under $100 million.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nHaim married Cheryl Lynn Flor in 1987, and they welcomed son Ness in 1989 and daughter Tanya in 1991. Cheryl is a screenwriter and producer, and Ness followed in his parents' footsteps and became a producer as well. Saban is also stepfather to Tifanie Christun and Heidi Lenhart, Cheryl's daughters from her marriage to Ray Lenhart. Heidi is an actress best known for starring as Jenny Garrison on the '90s teen sitcom \"California Dreams,\" and Tifanie is a voice actress. Haim has consistently donated to the U.S. Democratic Party, and in 2007, he co-hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton with Steven Spielberg that raised more than $850,000.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nHaim and Cheryl have donated nearly $47 million to Children's Hospital Los Angeles and $11 million to the Saban Free Clinic (formerly the Los Angeles Free Clinic). In 2002, Saban provided a $13 million grant (with a promise of additional funds) to establish the Washington, D.C. think tank the Saban Center for Middle East Policy. In 2007, he donated $14 million toward the completion of the Soroka Medical Center in Israel, and the center later opened the Saban Pediatric Medical Center (2008) and the Saban Birth and Maternity Center (2011).\n\nIn 2018 the Sabans donated $50 million to the Academy of Motion Pictures Museum.\n\nIn 2019 the Sabans donated $420 million to 1,000 causes and organizations and at the same time encouraged other billionaires to follow their lead.\n\nHaim has sponsored the Saban National Political Leadership Training Seminar in conjunction with the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee. The Saban National Political Leadership Training Seminar was dedicated to training student activists in pro-Israel advocacy to \"prepare for challenges and opportunities on their campuses\" and \"mobilize for legislative and electoral impact during the next school year.\"\n\nReal Estate\n\nSaban and his wife, Cheryl own several incredible properties in Southern California. They own a 23,000-square-foot mansion in a gated community in Beverly Hills called Beverly Park. The mansion is likely worth $50 million.\n\nIn the 1990s the Sabans bought an 11,000-square-foot oceanfront mansion in Malibu. They listed this property in June 2024 for $75 million.
