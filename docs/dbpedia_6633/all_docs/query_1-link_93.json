        "text": "Julius the monkey, created by Southern California artist Paul Frank, is cute. But Julius Jr., the younger version of Julius, is even cuter.\n\n“Julius Jr.” is a new pre-school children’s TV series that debuted last September on Nick Jr., part of the Nickelodeon network. Now that the little guy is going international, with overseas distribution and a second season, Saban Brands is signing agreements with a host of licensing partners this year and next to make tons of Julius Jr. products.\n\nThe new lines of products will include apparel, accessories, costumes, sleepwear, home goods and more.\n\nThe licensing partners include Parigi Group as well as Freeze for sportswear and T-shirts; Jay Franco for beach, bedding and bath accessories; High Point Design for hosiery and slipper socks; Accessory Innovations for backpacks, bags, headwear and cold-weather products; Komar Kids for children’s sleepwear from infants’ through size 8; Rubie’s Costume Co. for toddlers’ costumes; and Amscan for kids’ costumes to be sold exclusively at Party City.\n\nSaban Brands, based in Los Angeles, was created in 2010 as an affiliate of Saban Capital Group. That same year, Saban Brands acquired Paul Frank. Saban Brands’ other stable of labels and brands include Power Rangers, Julius Jr., Digmon Fusion and Popples.\n\nJulius Jr. is a young monkey and an aspiring inventor who likes to create gadgets that help his friends. Julius Jr., played by voice-over actress E.G. Daily, lives in a box with its own workshop. Other characters who live in the box include Clancy, a short giraffe; Sheree, a blue raccoon; and Worry Bear, a worrywart bear.\n\nHaim Saban, head of Saban Capital Group, started out as a children’s TV show producer and was successful in the early 1990s with his Mighty Morphin Power Rangers."
