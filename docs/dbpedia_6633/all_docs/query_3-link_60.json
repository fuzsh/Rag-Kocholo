        "text": "OVERVIEW: The Saban Family Foundation strongly support Jewish organizations in Israel and the U.S. Other areas of interest include health, the greater Los Angeles area and, to a lesser extent, arts and culture.\n\nIP TAKE: The Saban Family Foundation tends to support the same grantees each year, with grants mainly going to large Jewish and healthcare organizations. This is a supportive and collaborative funder, but it’s crowded grant space makes it more challenging for new grantees.\n\nIn the foundation’s hometown of Los Angeles, some smaller human services and mental health organizations have also received funding. In spite of its low profile, this funder accepts letters of inquiry at any time on organization letterhead, so it’s not an inaccessible as it may appear. Letters should be addressed to Jesse Bronner, the foundation’s senior director, at the address provided below.\n\nPROFILE: The Saban Family Foundation was established in Los Angeles in 1999 by Haim Saban and his wife, Cheryl Saban. Haim Saban is a veteran of the entertainment industry. His company, Saban Entertainment, served as the distributor for many successful children’s franchises in the U.S. and abroad, including the Power Rangers. The company was purchased by the Walt Disney Company in 2001. Cheryl Saban is a psychologist and author who has served as an advisor to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. The Saban Family Foundation maintains a low profile, making it difficult to ascertain its specific funding priorities. Tax filings suggest interest in Jewish causes in the U.S. and Israel, health, the Los Angeles community and, to a lesser extent, arts and culture.\n\nGrants for Jewish Causes\n\nJewish causes appear to be the Saban Family Foundation’s largest giving area, with Israeli organizations receiving some of its largest grants. The foundation has given millions to the Friends of Israel Defense Forces and $1 million to the Birthright Israel Foundation. Other grantees involved with Israeli causes include the American Israel Education Foundation, the Israeli American Council and ELEM/Youth in Distress Israel. U.S. Jewish organizations that have received recent funding include the Jewish Funders Network of New York, the Jewish National Fund, the UCLA Hillel and Congregation Beth Israel of Los Angeles. Temple Emanuel of Beverly Hills has received millions in support over the years. The Foundation has also provided ongoing support to Chicago’s International Fellowship of Christians and Jews.\n\nGrants for Public Health and Access\n\nThe Saban Family Foundation has demonstrated a strong commitment to public health and access through grants to health organizations working nationally and locally in Southern California. Recent grantees include the Los Angeles Free Clinic, the Melanoma Research Alliance Foundation, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of Los Angeles. The Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles has received around $35 million in donations over the years, and the Saban Community Clinic in Los Angeles has seen millions in support as well.\n\nGrants for Los Angeles\n\nEach year, this funder makes a handful of grants to organizations working in mental health and human services for underserved people in Los Angeles. Recent grants have supported the substance abuse prevention program Angels at Risk, the Los Angeles Shelter Partnership and Together We Rise, which works with foster children and youth.\n\nGrants for Arts and Culture\n\nArts and culture comprise a much smaller giving area for the Saban Family Foundation. However, the foundation gave $10 million in 2021—one of its largest grants—to the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Foundation. Other past grantees include the New York City Ballet, California’s Temple of the Arts and New York’s public television station WNET.\n\nImportant Grant Details:\n\nThe Saban Family Foundation gave away about $8 million in a recent year. Grants mainly ranged from $5,000 to $500,000, with only a few grants awarded in amounts of $1 million or more. The foundation’s average grant size is about $75,000. This funder tends to support the same grantees year after year. With the exceptions of some smaller Los Angeles-based nonprofits, grantees tend to be large, well-established organizations working in the foundation’s areas of interest. For more information about past grants, see the Saban Family Foundation’s recent tax filings.\n\nThe Saban Family Foundation accepts letters of inquiry at any time. Letters must be submitted on organization letter head to the foundation’s senior manager, Jesse Bronner, at the mailing address provided below. The foundation may be reached by telephone at (310) 557-5100.\n\nPEOPLE:\n\nSearch for staff contact info and bios in PeopleFinder (paid subscribers only).\n\nCONTACT:\n\nSaban Family Foundation\n\n10100 Santa Monica Blvd., No 2600\n\nLos Angeles, CA 90067\n\n(310) 557-5100"
