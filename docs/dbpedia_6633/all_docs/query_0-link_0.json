        "text": "Net Worth: $4.5 B\n\nLAST YEAR: 4.4\n\nCHANGE: 2.3%\n\nAGE: 78\n\nRESIDENCE: Beverly Hills\n\nSOURCE OF WEALTH: Entertainment, real estate\n\nTHE MONEY: Saban made his mark, and most of his wealth, in and around television, but in recent years he’s comfortably shifted toward pursuing personal interests and serving as patron for personal causes. Saban has been a reliable hand for the Democratic Party statewide and nationally, with his rare media appearance or public commentary typically dedicated to championing the party’s cause. Records indicate Saban has individually given about $116,000 to various Democratic causes this year up through mid-August."
