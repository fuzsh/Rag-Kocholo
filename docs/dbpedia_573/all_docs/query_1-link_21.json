It defines what is considered a \"special plant\" and describes the criteria for a plant to be included on the tracking list. The document also outlines the global and state ranking systems used by the Natural Diversity Database to assess a species' conservation status and risk of extinction within its range. Ranks run from G1/S1 for critically imperiled species to G5/S5 for secure common species.",
