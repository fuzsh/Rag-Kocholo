        "text": "AURORA, Ill. (CBS) -- The Lincoln Masonic Temple in Aurora went up in flames late Monday night, and firefighters spent more than nine hours extinguishing the blaze.\n\nThe fire started around 10 p.m. Monday at the nearly 100-year-old temple, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but has been vacant for about 10 years.\n\nPolice blocked most of the roads leading to the building, but from a distance smoke and firefighters using a ladder truck to try to put out the flames could be seen working to douse the flames.\n\nFive nearby homes also were evacuated during the blaze.\n\nThe fire was extinguished by about 7:30 a.m., but firefighters warned that people should avoid the area, because of hot spots that still posed a danger.\n\nThe Aurora fire chief said much of the fifth floor of the historic building was on fire when crews first arrived at about 10 p.m. and parts of the building collapsed at least three times as firefighters were trying to put out the flames. Some of that debris fell on a power line.\n\nThe overnight fire was so intense that more than 400 people lost power overnight.\n\nA ComEd map shows some were back online a few hours later.\n\nThe building was built in 1922, but it has been abandoned for some time now.\n\nThe cause of the fire is still unclear, and there is concern the building is now too unstable for crews to go in and attempt to determine a cause."
