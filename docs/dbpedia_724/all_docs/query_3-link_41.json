        "text": "Mr. Holden began his education in the public schools of Charlestown, New Hampshire, and was fourteen years of age when the family left for the west. He finished his education in the schools of. Rockton. When nineteen years of age he went to Chicago and entered the employ of Fuller & Fuller, who are in the drug trade, with whom he remained eleven years. He then engaged in business for himself, in the wholesale glassware trade, on South Water street, Chicago, and was in that business at the time of the great fire in 1871, when he was burned out with the rest. Losing everything, he came to Aurora, and soon after found employment with the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Company, and was with them seven years. He then went 'into the hardware business, as the junior member of the firm of Kendall & Holden, and that partnership continued for fifteen years, when he sold out to his partner. In 1895 he took up the real-estate, insurance and loan business, his offices being in the Coulter building.\n\nMr. Holden was united in marriage, September 17, 1868, to Marian Howell, daughter of Dr. O. D. and Cornelia (Moore) Howell. She was born in Moresville, Delaware county, New York, where her mother was also born, while her father was a native of the same county. They settled in Aurora in 1855, where he continued his practice. Both he and his wife are deceased. They had six children, two of whom are now living - Marian, and Annie the latter being the wife of Judge F. M. Annis, of Aurora. To Mr. and Mrs. Holden, two sons have been born - Frank H., and Ben E., who are now in Paris, where they have been for three years, engaged in study. They completed their preliminary education at Aurora, then graduated at the Chicago Manual Training School, then attended the Institute of Technology in Boston, three years, and are now at the Beauxarts, in Paris, and will finish the course in the fall of 1898. In that school are many young Americans, and all of prominent American families. This will be a splendid schooling for these young men, and when they return they will be richly and well endowed for life's journey.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Holden are members of the People's church, in Aurora, and in politics he is a Republican, casting his first presidential vote for Abraham Lincoln. He has held various positions of honor and trust, and for eighteen years was a member of the board of education. For fifteen years, he was a member of the board of supervisors of Kane county and was chairman of the board for eight consecutive years. In the spring of 1897, he was elected mayor of Aurora, and has made a popular and efficient officer, ever looking towards the best interests of Aurora. He has always taken an active part in the politics of the county, and has been a prominent factor in its growth and development. Socially he is a charter member of the City Club, and has been its president. He is a man of pleasing address, of social characteristics and highly esteemed.\n\nOn the 25th of April, 1846, Mr. Robertson was united in marriage with Miss Julia A. Esmond, a native of New York, by whom he had two sons, Charles F. and Ira E. They both served their country faithfully in the war for the union, the former giving up his life at Vicksburg, while the latter survived until after the close of the war, and died at home.\n\nOur subject has an adopted daughter, Hattie, who married Robert S. Brown, a former partner of his, and who died on the 20th of August, 1893, when about fifty years of age. They had three children: Esmond R., Letitia and Amy.\n\nIn politics Mr. Robertson is an ardent Republican, and has always manifested more or less interest in political affairs. In 1857 he was elected justice of the peace, and again in 1858, and in 1864, serving in all, seven years. In 1879 he was elected supervisor, and served until 1888, In the village he has held all the important offices, and has ever shown an interest in the material welfare of the place. No improvement has ever been suggested but has met with his unqualified support, and he is therefore regarded as one of the most enterprising of the citizens of Maple Park. Fraternally, he is a Master Mason, holding membership with the lodge at Sycamore, Illinois. He also belongs to the chapter and commandery.\n\nMr. Robertson is in all respects a self-made man. Through his own exertions he has attained an honorable r; position and marked prestige among the representative men of Kane county, and with signal consistency, it may be said that he is the architect of his own fortunes, and one whose success amply justifies the application of the somewhat hackneyed, but most expressive title \"a self made man.\" He has many of the elements of character which have enabled him to pass on the highway of life, many of the companions of his youth, who, at the outset of their careers, were more advantageously equiped or endowed.\n\nAs his means increased he purchased more land, until he had a farm of two hundred and seventy-six acres adjoining the present village of Sugar Grove. While residing in New York he married Eliza C. Brown, also a native of that state, where she was reared and educated. They were the parents of five sons, all of whom grew to mature years and all living and heads of families. Asel T. is a farmer of Sugar Grove township; Samuel B. resides in Aurora; Sarson L., of this review; Charles D., of Aurora; and Smith C, of Chicago, Illinois. Dexter C. Judd was quite a prominent man in Sugar Grove township, and held a number of local offices of honor and trust. Later in life he removed to Aurora, where his death occurred in June, 1893. His wife passed away two years previously, dying in 1891, and their bodies were laid to rest in Sugar Grove township.\n\nThe subject of this sketch grew to manhood on the old home farm, and was educated in the Sugar Grove schools. He remained with his parents until after attaining his majority. On the 25th of November, 1870, in Sugar Grove township, he was united in marriage with Miss Mary Gillett, a daughter of Lewis H. Gillett, a pioneer of Kane county, and later removed to Iroquois county, where he purchased a farm and remained six years, then returned to Kane county, bought the old homestead on which he has since resided, and where he has engaged in general farming and also in the stock business. In 1897 he also engaged in the farming-implement and coal business at Sugar Grove, where he has just completed a large and substantial residence, one of the best in the township. Mrs. Judd died in 1894, leaving two sons - Lewis Dexter, married and now running the old home farm, and Clarence, a student in the Sugar Grove Normal Institute. Mr. Judd was again married April 2, 1895, his second union being with Miss Susie Kauth, who was born and reared in Kane county, and a daughter of Michael and Audesia Kauth, of Sugar Grove township.\n\nPolitically Mr. Judd is a life-long Republican, the liberty-loving principles of which he inherited from his father, who was a strong anti-slavery man. He cast his first presidential ballot for U. S. Grant in 1868, and has voted for every presidential nominee of the party up to William McKinley, for whom he voted in 1896. He has always taken an active interest in political affairs, and has served as a delegate in many conventions, county, congressional and state, and has given his services to his county as supervisor for nine years. He is a member of the Masonic fraternity, and also of the Modern Woodmen of America. As a citizen he is enterprising and progressive, and never fails to be found in the front of those advocating any measure that will advance the interest of his town or county. Well known throughout the entire county, as well as in the adjoining counties of Kendall and De Kalb, he is held in the highest esteem by all.\n\nAfter he left college he spent his time in the seminary in Aurora until 1862, when, the war being on, he enlisted in July of that year. He organized a company, but it was not mustered in and was disbanded. With fifteen of his men he went to Piano and enlisted there, joining Company K, One Hundred and Twenty-seventh Illinois Volunteer Infantry. His first service was at Camp Douglas, and Dr. Little was appointed orderly sergeant. The regiment remained in camp until November 20, when it was ordered to Memphis, Tennessee, and assigned to General Sherman's division, and with it remained until the close of the war.\n\nFrom Memphis he went with the Chickasaw Bay expedition, and was in the fight in December. Later his command went to Arkansas Post, and was in that battle in which about five thousand prisoners were captured. From there they went to Vicksburg, and were under Grant at Young's Point. He was in that vicinity and in the siege until the surrender. While at Arkansas Post the captain of the company was taken sick and resigned, and our subject was appointed to his place. After Vicksburg they were ordered to Chattanooga, and were all through that campaign. After the relief of Chattanooga they were sent up to relieve Burnside, at Knoxville, from which place they returned to Larkinsville, and went into camp, while Sherman was organizing his Georgia campaign. At the battle of Kenesaw Mountain he was in command of the regiment; the colonel pleading sickness and the major withdrawing, he was put in command by General Giles A. Smith, and with his command was in the hottest of the fight. After the day was won he received the compliments of the general for his gallant services. From then on he was in the campaign until the fall of Atlanta. In the engagement of August 3, 1864, at Atlanta, he was wounded while in command of the left wing of the regiment. Colonel Curtis lay back with his regiment and would not come out, so Captain Little, in whose valor and capacity to lead there was no question, was called to take charge, and as the regiment was marching out for battle he was wounded. The colonel of this regiment was finally reinstated through political pressure and joined his regiment at Goldsboro, North Carolina.\n\nAfter he was wounded Captain Little went north, and later returned to Chattanooga, where he was ordered to organize, among the detachments of the Fifteenth Army Corps, a command and go to the relief of General Ammen at Knoxville. His command consisted of six hundred men. He then returned to Louden and took command there, guarding the bridge. From there he went to Cleveland, Tennessee, and was assigned to the staff of General Baughton, where he remained until he rejoined his regiment at Goldsboro. He was aide-decamp on General Baughton's staff. On their way they had a fight with General Bragg, at Kingston, North Carolina. After he arrived at Goldsboro the provisional division was disbanded, and he was put into the Second Missouri Engineer Corps, Army of the Tennessee. In this position he served until he arrived in Washington, when, on the 5th of June, 1865, he was mustered out.\n\nAfter his discharge Captain Little returned to Aurora, and feeling rusty in literary matters, after his long service in the army, he entered Antioch College to review his studies. He entered the senior class, and remained there for about one year, when he returned to Aurora and began the study of law with the Hon. Charles Wheaton. He was admitted to the bar in 1867, and began at once his practice by opening an office at Aurora, where he has since continued. He soon came to the front, and is one of the successful attorneys of the Kane county bar. His first partner was Hon. B. F. Parks, who remained with him in 1873-4. His next partner was L. Isham White, who was with him about one year, and was succeeded by G. W. Avery, that partnership continuing five years. Then came Ira S. Smith, who is his present partner. Captain Little is a close student of law, and is regarded as an able counselor and pleader.\n\nCaptain Little was married January 18, 1877, to Miss Bonnie B. Snow, daughter of Prof. Snow, who was a Massachusetts man by birth. They have an adopted son, Leonard Rae. Mrs. Little is a member of the Episcopal church, in which she takes an active part. In politics Captain Little is a Republican, and in 1869 served as alderman of the Eleventh ward. In 1874 he was elected mayor of the city, serving one term, and during his incumbency he organized the public library, which has become one of the beneficial institutions of the city. Previous to his election as mayor he served as city attorney, and has served one term subsequently. Fraternally, he is a member of Aurora post, No. 20, G. A. R. As a citizen he is progressive, and is ever ready to do his part for the best interests of the community in which he lives."
