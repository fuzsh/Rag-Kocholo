        "text": "The abandoned Lincoln Masonic Temple in Aurora has been destroyed by a fire that broke out after 10 p.m. Monday night. The structural integrity of the building was a challenge as the building quickly began to crumble. Some of the building collapsed onto power lines knocking out power for some homes.\n\nThe longtime historic landmark in downtown Aurora hasn’t been used in over 10 years. The Masonic Temple built in 1922 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The 50,000 square foot building has been empty since 2008 when it was being used as a banquet hall. Neighbors say homeless people and teenagers often break in the building. The old structure continues to present challenges for firefighters."
