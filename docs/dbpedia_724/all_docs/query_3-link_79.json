I am 39 years old and I love to rock and go to concerts.\n\nI love hard rock because this sounds weird it does help with my anxiety and the lyrics I can relate to on a lot of levels. I have been into metal since I was very young about age 6 love me some Guns N Roses thatâ€™s how it started.\n\nMy all-time favorite band is Godsmack.\n\nBest Concert that is tough I have seen so many but I love seeing Godsmack live I have seen them 3 times and it gets better every time!\n\nOk here is my list of the songs"
