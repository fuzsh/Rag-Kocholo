        "text": "On June 2, 2001 I sat in my office here in New York and browsed through the Internet and came across some unusual material on Freemasonry and Shrinedom. The information caught my eye, as it was data that has been shared from time to time on various groups I belong to on the Internet. Nothing in depth, but small information on this particular individual who I had the pleasure of one time meeting when he ran a sect of a Muslims in Flatbush section of Brooklyn, New York. This group was very prominent in the late 70âs to early 80âs.This person who I recognized by the name âAl Imam Issa Al Haadi Al Mahdiâ or as many new him by âDr. Malachi Yorkâ had various websites claiming to be the Imperial Grand Potentate (Internationally). He is the leader of Al Mahdi Temple No. 19. ILL. And uses the name and title of Rev. Dr. Malachi Z. York 33 degree (A.E.O. & N.M.S.) The Ancient Egiptian (note the spelling) Order & Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, Northern & Southern Jurisdiction, and also Grand Master of Nuwaubian Grand Lodge (A.F. & A.M.) Ancient Free & Accepted Masons Inc. Ramses II Mir No.9. He also claims to be a Scottish Rite Freemason of Amos Grand Lodge of Macon, Ga. and Deputy Grand Master of Pride of Georgia Lodge A.F. & A.M. Well after seeing that it kind of blew my mind.\n\nAfter reading a little I decided to write him and E-mail that was freely furnished in his web site:\n\nEzekiel Wrote: (6/02/01) Dr. York, I am Ezekiel M. Bey from New York. I have been reading many of your articles since you had the Ansaar Community well established. The reason I am writing you is because I have seen you evolve in many areas that may confuse those who do not know you. You and I have met many of times. I by other names as well as those I have seen you trans-change.\n\nI probably have all of your Ansaar Community subscription and volumes. What I need to know is what do you consider yourself now? You first called yourself a Muslim, now by what I see, a Moor. But then you also say you are a Mason which many years ago you were against the Masonic Order.\n\nI am not challenging you in any way but would like to know what are your evolutionary reasons for all of your changes? I know all things change and nothing stays the same. But you have so rapidly went from one stage to another in which the people of today do not understand, and in order for one to keep up they might have to know you by what you present at the moment and not like I, who have seen you in your early years.\n\nWell, I wish you the best and hope you can enlighten me on what your intentions are especially now which you call yourself a Shriner.\n\nI know you know the history of the Moorish Fez and what is presently worn, which is a Tarbush. I see you have been reading and studying amongst the Moors.\n\nWhat would you say Noble Drew Ali would say about your movements today?\n\nWell, the next day to my surprise I received a reply from Dr. York.\n\nDr. Yorkâs Reply:(6/02/01) â If you really followed the books and I believe you did you would know I was always a Freemason. And crossed the desert along time ago to the shrine finding many mistakes in the rituals and handbooks. The tunnel vision discouraged me but I was called to sit on the International Supreme Council of Shriners and to upgrade the handbook and research the roots of the ritual meanings presented with original Arabic manuscripts and translate them into some sense, which I accepted.\n\nI found Muslims to be blindly following undercover Euro- Arabs terrorists with no regards for the true Mothers and Fathers of the religion. I found the Moors confused and Emulating Freemasonry not even knowing the language. After so many years I think that the Noble: Drew Ali who himself was a Shriner would be heart broken by the dissention remembering he was betrayed by his own.\n\nMy brother you touched on a touchy subject. I have no room for faith or belief, only facts and Islam as practiced by most is faith blindness standing in the light blinded by it. My heart has always been in Nubia that is Egypt and so is every true Freemason and Shriner. I see where I can be more affective for the upliftment of humanity in the Shrine where my eccentric mind and intense research canât be called a cult or sect or militant or the likes.\n\nâI had to sit back and think , where did all of this come from? When I thought of him saying that he found Muslims to be blindly following undercover Euro-Arabs Terrorists , it took some wind out of me.\n\nHe generalized all Muslims to be terrorist in that statement and I totally disagreed. He also stated that he found the Moors confused, and Emulating Freemasonry not even knowing the language; it told me to be cautious and evaluate his data and information.\n\nDr. Malachi York is now part of a new group called the United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors. Not to be confused with the Moorish Science Temple that Noble Drew Ali (Aka Timothy Drew) started in the early 1900âs or the Circle of Mothers & Sons, or The Great Seal of the Moorish Science.\n\nDr. Malachi York in many of his writings and web sites express that he is from another galaxy. A galaxy known to him as Illyuwn. He claims that there are 19 galaxies and that Illyuwm is the 19th. He states in some of his writings that Illiyuwm means âOn Highâ and that this galaxies has 3 suns, UTU, SHAMASH, and APSU; with 38 Moons and 19 planets.\n\nTo get to know Dr. York a little more of what he represents today, I sent him another E-mail on June 5th, 2001 to see if he would respond and explain a few of my curiosities:\n\nEzekiel Wrote: Brother Dr. York, at least that is who I believe you are since you did not sign the E-mail of your post. I appreciated you responding to my enquiry about a few curious thoughts of mine. You see I to am a Moor and a Mason. I do not recall you ever calling yourself a Mason but that is neither here nor there. The fact is that you consider yourself one now. As far as the Shriners you give a good description and definition of the Fez in which I am very familiar.\n\nMy question to you is when did you first see yourself as a Moor? Since in the 70's you considered yourself a Muslim and not a Moslem in the circle of the Moorish Science Temple?\n\nI can relate to your intolerance to faith as this in not the age of belief but the age of \"I Know\". I am a Masonic writer as well and I have written many articles for many Masonic publications. So I do understand your mission in reaching the blind and teaching them how to see correctly.\n\nI have seen most of your sites and I see you have many names. Is there a reason for this? I too have evolved to have many names as well but what is your reason? The reason I ask these question is not to doubt your intentions but to get a clear picture to who I once new you as, and what you are today.\n\nIn trying to relate to his concept one must realize that this man has studies intensively the doctrines of the world. This is why one must speak the language he understands but letting him know that your reason might be totally different then his. So my position was to learn how he sees his own view and not what he wants me to sees by his form of casting illusions:\n\nDr. Yorkâs Reply:(6/6/01) âI have one name Issa Al Haadi Al Mahdi and many titles according to which school of thought Iâm mastering and teaching. Anyone who has read my books who is a Freemason would recognize Masonic language through out the books. As far as Moor is concerned I have in my possession a card issued at age 28 in 1973 Brother M. York-EL home office 48 inches St. Mt. Clemens, Michigan, 48043. The card has a Crescent and star to the left under which is the word Islam next to that thereâs a clasped hand, above it is the word unity, to the right is the symbol of circle 7, beneath it the word Allah. I've always carried this card on my person and never denied being a Moor. I was initiated in 1970 at Masonic, King Solomon Lodge No.4 1215 Bedford Ave. Brooklyn New York. Then I was pasted at Enoch Grand Lodge on Putnam and Nostrand Ave. in Brooklyn and raised at the same under Worshipful Master Charles Tensely 33rd degree. I was crossed at Mecca II Desert Georgia, oasis Macon by Noble T.W. Smith Jr. 33rd/95 degrees. My family on my Mothers side were all Shriners and Daughters of Isis out of Richmond Virginia Zen Court No.98 Newport News Virginia and Zen temple No.122. I hope this information helps you to understand my involvement. While in Morocco studying at Fez University I visited the shrine there, Maghrib Temple as well as the Grand Temple in Khartoum where I was given documents, which will be on the web page chartering and linking us to the International Supreme Council Of Worldwide Shrinedom. Concerning the Fez, Moors donât wear Fez's and the word is faas in Arabic as appose to the tarbah, which was mis-pronounced by the Turks as Tarboosh. Many errors appear in Moorish American doctrine but that's neither here nor their. The fact that we elders of the true purpose have survived, and I hope that you spend your life as I do waking up our people. Your brother I.S.L.A.M.â\n\nHere Dr. York states that his affiliation was with a King Solomon Lodge and Enoch Grand Lodge in Brooklyn in 1970. He claims to have been created a Shriner in Macon, Georgia by someone named Noble T.W. Smith Jr. who was a 33rd over 95Â°âs. Both Grand Lodges are known today as Bogus and Irregular Grand Lodges.\n\nSo far we see a Man who is a Muslim, Moslem, Moor, from galaxy 19 of the 19th planet called Illiyuwm, who became a Shriner in Macon ,Georgia. He was given what I know as a Nationality Card, which I am very well familiar as this is only given in the Moorish Science Temple of from a authorized Sheik of the same.\n\nAfter receiving this information from Dr. York, I was compelled to respond as I felt there was more he would tell. So on June 6th, 2001 I replied:\n\nEzekiel Wrote:(6/07/01) Islam Brother Issa Al Haadi Al Mahdi, I am well aware of the Nationality Card issued by the Moors as I myself carry one on my person at all times. What is most interesting is your affiliation with King Solomon Lodge and Enoch Grand Lodge. Are you aware of legality in Grand Lodges? These Grand Lodges operate illegally when it comes to Masonic Authority. Enoch was a break off from Hiram Grand Lodge, which was set up by John G. Jones who was a suspended Mason from the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge. He was the original founder of the Shriners among people of dark complexion here in the States.\n\nSpeculative Masonic bodies must find the origin to the British Isles. That is if you are practicing speculative Masonry. Operatives are recognized as Stone Masons as were the Ancient Egyptians in their mystery schools of thought.\n\nThose Lodges you mentioned are speculative and considered spurious Lodges or what we know as irregular. I understand that this was back in 1970 well over 30 years ago.\n\nOne of my biggest concerns is the talk of you being from another galaxy. Is there some truth to this? And what about the extraterrestrial beings I have heard that exist on earth? I would like to know about this.\n\nHere is where the Gold is tested by the fire to see if itâs pure. Dr. Yorkâs response is not a direct one and avoids certain inquiries I made concerning the topic of extraterrestrial beings as some of his followers claim they were taught by Dr. York. This is explained by a student of Dr. York on her web site. He mentions Prince Hall in his reply but really does not explain who the man was as you will see later what he thinks he knows of Prince Hall, the father of our Fraternity here in America.\n\nDr. Yorkâs Reply: (6/8/01) âFirst of all when you speak of freemasonry and then jump into the subject of extraterrestrial you can become confused. I answered your question as to my affiliation with lodges in New York. Close observations I mention lodges and shrines in Virginia. If you are familiar with my family history as I hope you are, you will know of the family affiliation with Boston and Prince Hall. I like many accepted what you are calling European Freemasonry from Britain however, after entering Lodges in Egypt and Morocco, and the Grand Temple in Saudi Arabia I found that most if not all Freemasons in America haven't a clue of what real Shrinedom is. And where it originated they donât know who Hiram really was let alone the repeated mistakes stemming from a lack of fluency in the Arabic language. Things like Arabic Nobles of the Mystic Shrine in Arabic speaking countries. At the shrine it translate Arab Nobles of the Mystic Shrine the passwords are wrong as a result of Europeans receiving them in manuscripts from individuals who themselves were not Arabs. Rizk Allah Hassaan Effendee was a Turk and did not speak fluent Arabic. Louis Marracci did not speak fluent Arabic and never translated the Arabic Quran. He was Italian and translated from Castilian Spanish of Spain to Latin. Shaykh Alnasafi was a Persian; his native language was Farsi Albert L. Lawson an American, was not fluent in Arabic. Bro. Jones claimed to have received on June 1893 sanctioned from Noble Ali Rifest Pasha who name Pasha alone reveals that he was not an Arab but rather a Turk. All of the above were not sanctioned by the (As Spayed) the blood line of the family we have and used in our temple translations from the Arabic which was brought back from the Egyptian temples and Shrines who got them from well preserved tents in the gold casket of As Spayed Al Hussein father of As Spayed Yacub , son of As Sayyid Ali, and Fatima daughter of as Sayyid Muhammad, and Nabi (P.B.U.H.). The Masonic Lodge does not have its origin in Britian but in Babylon with Nimrod. Many people have been misled by a group of men called the Alberts. Peace!â\n\nNotice that he never gives any reference to his information but at times places himself in an area of the world to have witness it with his own eyes. For the third time I asked the question of extraterrestrials.\n\nIt is mind boggling to have learned in one of the website were the media reports that the Rev. Jesse Jackson attended one of there public functions and gives Dr. York and his followers credit for what they are doing in the communities. This is the deception and the views other Masons are blind to when one does not know the truth themselves. The illusions of doing for the communities are shadowed by the hypocrisies and lies of what looks good. We fail to pick up on falsehood when we dare not test the Gold with fire. The many sites that Dr. York has are somewhat ironic and shows an unstable mind controlling even weaker minds by the process of brainwash. Later you will see how misinformation can fool even the best of Men if we are not watchful.\n\nEzekiel Wrote:(6/9/01) Then Brother Mahdi Please explain what you see as extraterrestrials? And how you come from another galaxy or rather the 19th galaxy that you say. This indeed is an interesting subject as I have heard of many who say that they are from other worlds.\n\nDr. York is uncertain to whom he is talking to. He is unsure if he is talking to a human or some other being in what could be the enemy. He uses NASA as a sort of reference to answer my questions, but nothing that he will openly say that it is coming from his person:\n\nDr. Yorkâs Reply:(6/10/01) âI have written several books on this subject that are still available. One thing is for sure to date; the government has confirmed finding right outside of third solar system a tri- solar system. The same sheriff that hated legends. On which Caucasians, which include is deputy and friend admit of seeing craft hovering over the black pyramid in Tama. Anything that I would try to explain to you would sound like science fiction. The war in heaven still goes on and I never know exactly who or what Iâm still talking to. Is there a Rizq? NASA thinks so. Is there an Illiyuwm? NASA found it. Are there such things as unidentified crafts? NASA has confirmed it. Are there people walking amongst you whose bodies are vessels for higher intelligence from other dimensions? It has been confirmed. Besides those things there is nothing more I can say.â\n\nI make one last attempt to see if he might explain his views on outer beings and try to direct the conversation back to Masonry and what his intentions are as it relate to his International Shrine Order in Macon Georgia and abroad:\n\nEzekiel Wrote:(6/10/01) I do understand what you are saying Brother Mahdi. My question is, are you of that galaxy and did you come from that Galaxy? We all know that we have come from somewhere. I am asking did you come from this galaxy?\n\nI am not interested in what NASA thinks. I am interested in what you think and the people who follow you. I myself know that there are other entities and other life form within our World. What I am asking is your explanation on how you see things. So, how do you explain extraterrestrial beings?\n\nBack to Freemasonry, how do you relate the Shrine to Freemasonry? What is your concept in regularity in Freemasonry? And what do you think of Prince Hall Freemasonry? Prince Hall Freemasonry has been around longer than any other Black Fraternity in this country. What do you know of Prince Hall Freemasonry?\n\nDr. Yorkâs Reply:(6/12/01) âSubjects that I've discussed and made plain in books I leave at that, except for those who stand close enough to me to bring trust with how I feel about things. Prince hall had a white father and a half white mother. I did say if Iâm correct my family was out of Boston. By that I thought I was making myself clear. Prince Hall Clandestine Modern Freemasonry is all confused. Reading the same books giving to them by Euro Freemasons. Prince Hall cannot establish an African Lodge when neither his mother nor father was African. Scottish Rites and the likes are Caucasian, being no Negro or Scottish. We have the in-depth history of the real teachings that was given to the Geeks, who gave it to the Romans, who gave to the Europeans, who the Negroes begged for charters from them for years. So we move and work on a much higher levels than the sects that the original doctrine has divided into by self-rightous leaders. Something that must be done away with. After they finish there 32nd degree or there 12th degree to the Knights Templar they become Muslims anyway, so this is the civilizing of the Greeks and doesnât really apply to us the true seed of the Quraish tribe. The Black Arabs.â\n\nAgain Dr. York ignores my question and now says he only discusses those thing with those that he trust and close to him. He places Prince Hall in a circle of a White Father and a half White Mother. He removes the Afrocentricity away from Prince Hall and calls him âbeggars of Charters.â What Dr. York is practicing is a mystery to me, but it sure does not sound like any Freemasonry I know nor any Shrinedom I have ever heard of.\n\nThe names he goes by are as mentioned, âIssa Al Haadi Al Mahdi, Dr. York, Chief Black Eagle, Dr. Malachi Z. York EL, Nayya Malchizodok EL, Al Mahdi, Dwight York, Rabboni Yâshua Bar El Haady and many others. I think this is the most far fetch controversial person I have ever known of. I have no idea how Freemasonry falls into any of his concepts. He has taken Islam, a pure religion of the East, and took his own twisted ideas, threw some Shrine twist into it, went to deep space nine, well in his case the 19th galaxy, took a trip to Egypt and became a Pharaoh, created his own Moorish group, and believes he is from a tribe of Indians called the Yamassee Native Americans. Now how can anyone follow him is beyond me. I get exhausted just dialoguing with him via E-mail. This Man is literally running his own Grand Lodge in Georgia, his own Shrine Temple called AL Mahdi Shrine Temple Ancient Egiptian Order & Arabic Nobles of the Mystic Shrine (A.E.O. & A.N.O.M.S). I guess he got tired of me asking questions, that he asked me to identify myself or the conversations with him will cease. I needed to know where did he get a Charter to operate or where did he receive his authority to practice Freemasonry. Well here is how it went.\n\nEzekiel Wrote: (6/11/01) Where did you receive your Charter to give you authority to practice Masonry? That is if you are one who feels you need a charter. Why do you emphasize Shrinedom? Do you feel Shrinedom and Freemasonry are the same?\n\nDr. Yorkâs Reply: (6/12/01) âIf you truly read my books then you know my history as a Mahdi, and if you've read the web page you would have seen the blood link to the Prophet Muhammad and Ali. Need I say more? Again I repeat identify yourself, Lodge, Temple, Desert, Oasis, Potentate, or our conversation about Masonry and Shrinery has reached its end.âwww.egiptianmysteries.com\n\nTo my Brothers and Sisters who read this article, many may find it funny, many find it upsetting but I ask you, if this happened to you, how would you find it ? The following article is a story that happened to me....As a child I always wanted to be a Mason! All my male members of my family are Masons . My oldest brother is a Prince Hall Mason from Florida. I remember when I was 16 years old . I went into a known Masonic bookstore called, Drew Sales .Today it is called \" JZ Enterprise \" located in Chicago. I went in there and told them I wanted to be a Mason! An older brother there asked me my age .When I told him my age, he explained to me that I was too young ,but he wrote me a recommendation to go to some lodge on 42nd and Cottage Grove. I never did go. As I got older I had my share of trouble with the law. I knew at some point I wanted to change my life . I inquired to my uncle, how I could get into Masonry . He stated that he would talk to his Worshipful Master. My uncle came back with a reply that they were not accepting anyone at this time.\n\nI would ask anyone on the streets of Chicago that I saw wearing a Masonic ring! And sad to say that nobody would call me. One day I saw a brother wearing a jacket with the Square and Compass and gave him my info. He never called until I ran into him 3 more times. The last time I was persistent.\n\nThis Brotherâs name was Bro. S. I. He was the Worshipful Master of Micah Lodge No. 212 which was neutralized by the Grand Lodge because the only active Brother Worshipful Master S.I. had was me. S.I. told me my application fee would be $300 and before he could say would that be any problem I pulled out the money and paid him. I never heard from him again until I received a phone call a few days later stating to be at 540 N. Cicero at 6:00p.m. I almost thought I had been scammed!\n\nS.I. told me to report to \" Most Worshipful St. Paul Grand Lodge Free and Accepted Modern Masons. \" I received their version of the First Degree . Several months later I received of what they called, half of the Third Degree. I didn't receive my other half until a month or two later. At this point I never received a dues card until I left Bro. S.I.âs Lodge and went to Sawyer Lodge No. 3. The Worshipful Master there (whose Lodge was named after him) taught me a lot that I thought was pure Masonry. I received a dues card that I begged for so long to get ! On the card, it had the Grand Masterâs and Grand Secretaryâs signature on it , however it never stated the dues(monetary information) on the back. When I inquired about that, they told me that, â it was a old card âand that âthey are going to print up the new cards that will have the dues structure on the back.â I accepted this because I didn't know any better.\n\nThis Lodge used the ritual, Lester's Look to the East. I studied this book hard because I was so excited that I became a Mason. I started memorizing everything quickly . The Grand Secretary Bro. C. W. took the ritual from me and told me the stuff that I'm quoting is useless if I can't show him any of it in the Bible. Bro. C.W. stated that I was a book Mason. Another Brother, Bro. . C. C. told me, âI'll fit right in with Prince Hall organization because of my memorizing the ritual!â\n\nMy $300 application fee only covered just my entry fee. No dues, no apron, no ritual! All the Worshipful Masters and elected and appointed officers had aprons. The rest of the Craft did not. They stated that they did not have any for us and had to reorder them. When they did reorder , it was $65.00 each. Our dues was $30.00 per month, plus $360.00 a year for taxation fees. Another $350.00 was due every December for their annual convention. (Funny but no other lodges or Grand Lodges would be there except St. Paul).We have to buy a Grand Lodge jacket that cost $170.00. They give us a minimum of 10 raffle tickets each and were told if we do not sell them all , we would have to pay out of our pockets for the tickets that were left. All that including the application fee was like close to $2,000.00 the first year!! Including dues!\n\nI paid the total cost and was very excited that I was a Mason! Nothing else in the world cared. I called my Brother(P.H.A.) up in Mississippi, and told him everything . He basically went off! My brother explained to me that there is no such thing of two halves to a Third Degree and I should of went Prince Hall Affiliated. I ignored my brother because \" I was excited to be a Mason\"! They taught us things about Prince Hall. For example:\n\n1) Prince Hall could only be a Mason if he dropped one letter and be a three letter.\n\n2) He was only allowed to be a Mason while he was on shore.\n\n3) The moment he stepped on land, he wasn't a Mason, so all these Prince Hall Lodges out there are clandestine because they are on land.\n\n4) Prince Hallâs cargo on his ship were black slaves.\n\n5) He was a slave driver.6) Prince Hall Lodge's are scamming people out of money.\n\n7) They make you pay for everything !\n\n8) It is at least $1,000.00 dollars for each degree that you get in Prince Hall.\n\n9) When you go up to the higher degrees, you start practicing devil worshipping and sacrificing goats.\n\nâ\n\nThese are just \" some \" of the things they told us about Prince Hall Freemasonry. I took it upon myself to research all of this and found out it was a down right lie. I would ask myself, why are they lying to me ? Why don't we attend the conventions with other Lodges? Is it something they don't want us to find out there ? Why do they tell us don't associate with Prince Hall Brethren? I thought all Mason's were our Brother's ? What happened to those hundreds of Brothers and Sisters that use to be apart of this Grand Lodge and Grand Chapter? Why is the total membership of Brothers are less than 300 ? All these questions erased from my mind when they appointed me Senior Deacon! You thought I was excited then! I had some power! All of the officerâs positions are permanent position's, until someone dies.\n\nOur Grand Master is C.W. He is an old man that has had many heart problems. Grand Master C.W. drove a nice Cadillac and had no job. It was said that he had been a Prince Hall Mason and has received every degree He told us that his name is in the book of older brothers at the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Illinois.\n\nIn St. Paul Grand Lodge we only go as far as three degrees. All the officer's including the Worshipful Master has only three degrees, including the Grand Master. I asked them, why do we not confer the other degrees? Why do we only have three degrees?\n\nThey told me that is all I needed.. They taught us that there is no such thing as \" 3, 5, 7 \" and that it is, \" 4, 6, 8 \" because you have to count the \" Tyler \"! The Tyler is important too!. They taught us that the story of Hiram Abiff was a myth and donât let anybody call you \" Bro. Hiram \" on the streets because Hiram is a dead man and you are not dead. They also taught us that \" King Solomon \" was not a Mason and he never had possession of the Master's word because if he did have it, he would not be looking for the substitute word. They were hard stating, do not let any Mason call you Solomon because its disrespecting you by calling you a name of a man that was not a Mason.\n\nWe couldn't wear our jackets unless we could \" Walk the Circle \". The circle is St. Paul Grand Lodge emblem that has the letter âGâ , with the Square and Compass, but it also has the nine emblems that is in the 3rd. Degree. Well there are 10 emblems and we have to explain what they mean to us in order to wear the jacket that we bought. They told me that I wasn't a Master Mason unless I was dead because the only Master Mason is Jesus Christ.\n\nI joined the Order of Eastern Star and became a member of Dorcas Grand Chapter. They also meet in St. Paul Grand Lodge. I never received the white book(ritual), no studying, no classes, but Symbol for the Order of the Eastern Star was on my jacket.\n\nThey use to irritate me about bringing a candidate. They needed more candidates to join the lodge. They wanted me to hit the streets to find people to join the lodge like I was trying to get someone to convert to a religion or something.\n\nOn Saturday November 3, 2001, I was healed into Charity Lodge No.108 of Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Illinois and its Jurisdictions, F&AM., Prince Hall Affiliation. I can tell you this, I didn't have to pay for no dues card, no ritual, gloves, apron , etc. All that was included with my dues card and application fee. Only $100.00 a year compared to $30 a month in dues is beautiful ! My subordinate Lodgeâs meetings are attended by 30 and more Brothers. Grand Lodge Meetings have Hundred's maybe thousand's of Brothers that are Prince Hall.\n\nWhen I was in St. Paul Grand Lodge F.A.M.M., subordinate lodges had about 8 or less Brethren and their Grand Lodge meetings had less than 30 Brothers attending. Prince Hall has thousands attending their Convention's, while St. Paul has not even 50. I'm no longer excited and gullible like I use to be, but I'm happy now that I found a warm home in a just and lawfully constituted Lodge of Masons.\n\nI wrote this article so that people that are involved in the lodges such as the one I was in can wake up ! I ask that some Brothers and Sisters to stop being excited and gullible and use your common sense. To my understanding there are two Grand Lodges recognized in the state of Illinois. One is the my Grand Lodge and the other is the Mainstream Grand Lodge.I didn't know that when I was very young , the Junior Crafts that the brother referred me to join when I was young visiting the bookstore is the Grand Lodge on 42nd and Cottage Grove. This is the same Prince Hall Lodge that I am active in now! And you know what?? I still have that old recommendation.\n\nThere are some good Brothers in St. Paul that just joined. I am trying to get them to come into the Prince Hall Grand Lodge. Those who are still members of St. Paul Grand Lodge, I know you are reading this and I hope this may give you something to think about and wake up. Just like I did.\n\nFraternally\n\nBro. Marcus Cartlidge\n\nCharity Lodge No. 108\n\nMost Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Illinois\n\nItâs been a long time coming. That is the answer that I give people when they ask me why I decided to be healed into the Prince Hall Affiliation. I was Entered, Passed, Raised, Arched, and Knighted in the National Compact Affiliation. When I decided that I wanted to seek membership in Freemasonry, I did my fair share of research. I found that as an African American man, I needed to seek membership in Prince Hall Masonry, so right away I ruled out Modern Free, International, Federated, and Scottish Rite. All of them I recognized as bogus right away. What I did not know was that there were two groups of African American Masons calling themselves Prince Hall.\n\nI had several friends as well as family members that were made Masons in Smooth Ashlar Grand Lodge of Georgia National Compact Prince Hall Origin. All of them were not active, and none of them knew what the differences between the two âPrince Hallâ Grand Lodges were. Just when I thought that that Grand Lodge might not be the best place for me, I met a brother whose lodge was under Smooth Ashlar. This was a good brother by the name of Al Price. He took me and two other brothers that were interested out, and just talked about masonry with us. He answered every question that we had to the best of his ability. When it came to the questions I had about the PHA lodges, he told us that there was no difference. He said that PHA was not recognized by any other Masons and that Masons under Smooth Ashlar were recognized all over the world. It was later that I found out that he was just reciting what was taught to him by older brothers in his lodge which was Burkshire #664.When my petition was accepted, my investigation consisted of me and five other brothers taking the Senior Warden to dinner and drinking, while he asked us questions. This was a really charismatic brother who talked a good game. He told us about how we had made the right decision by coming to Smooth Ashlar. He told us he knew many PHA brothers and witnessed them being beaten during initiations in the middle of the night in graveyards. He told us how he was admitted into Mainstream meetings, while PHA Masons were turned away. He told us of how Smooth Ashlar has a charter to work and PHA Masons donât. He told us that PHA Masons can only be Masons in the state that they live in, and if they leave the state they are not Masons. We were told that PHA Masons have to be forty five or older to hold any office. Upon hearing all of this, we were happy that we decided to become Masons in Burkshire Lodge under Smooth Ashlar.\n\nWe six brothers received our EA degree, along with the lecture for that degree. That was all we learned for a year. The lodge did pretty much nothing but argues about money, and listen to the Past Masters preach in the lodge and occasionally some would catch the Holy Spirit during the meeting. Three of the other EAâs left during this time, but three of us refused to give up. During that year a few more EAâs joined our class. One guy who joined with us had been an EA for more than two years. It was not that we were not proficient, but rather they could not get together enough to run the lodge. Six of us were passed and raised in one night, in a poor excuse for degree work. There was a lot of stumbling and book reading. We were told that we were lucky it was not a PHA lodge because we would not learn any ritual, but would only be given a Catch question book.\n\nUpon being raised we were given positions right away. We were not elected, but rather we sat in seats for the brothers who had stopped coming to meetings. It was around this time that I started asking questions about the historical background of the National Compact and Smooth Ashlar. All of my questions were dodged, or some answer was made up with no references to back it up. I asked why PHA Masons say they are the only legitimate Black Masons, and why they say they have a Charter from the United Grand Lodge of England to prove it. I was told that PHA was lying, and that the charter was no longer valid. I searched the internet for any history of the National Compact, but there was nothing to be found. I was also given a copy of the official history of the National Compact written by Brock. It told of how the Compact came about, how a split came about in 1877 which created State Rite Masons (PHA). It also says that the only legitimate black Masons are FAAY Masons. I was filled with joy to have some printed material to back me up when other Masons called me bogus, not real, irregular, and unrecognized. This happened quit often.\n\nIt was around this time that I decided to create an internet e-group on yahoo.com for people who wanted to talk about the National Compact, PHA, and mainstream Masonic relations. The group grew rapidly, and I found that there were many that were seeking the same information. I was first praised by many in the Compact for building websites and starting the e-group. It was one of the first times that the Compact got recognized in public. All of the praise went silent when the topic of history, legitimacy, and recognition came up in the group. PHA Masons such as Brothers Ralph McNeal, Ezekiel M. Bey, Joe Snow, and David Gray started posting the true history of the National Compact along with references to back what they posted. I went head to head with many of those brothers. Some of the debates got quit heated. I defending the National Grand Lodgeâs history many times alone, but later I was joined by Brother Cedric Lewis of Mississippi. My good act of trying to defend the National Compact against what I thought at the time were unjust attacks, was met with a stiff reprimand from Smooth Ashlar Grand Lodge. I was completely confused, and asked what I did wrong. I never received and answer. I later received many emails from the âspecial deputyâ of the Grand Master threatening to suspend me if I did not censor or shut down the e-group. I asked for help from some of the grand officers in my lodge, but all agreed with the Grand Lodge. I was told that some how I had shamed my lodge. I informed the âSpecial Deputyâ of the Grand Master that I could not control what brothers posted on the group nor could I shut it down. The truth was that I was learning too much, and I did not want to be thrown back into darkness. I telephoned Brother Cedric Lewis in Mississippi and informed him of my situation. I requested that he take over the group. He was in another state and out of the jurisdiction of Smooth Ashlar Grand Lodge.\n\nAfter my run in with the Grand Lodge and my near suspension, I decided to lay low for awhile and secretly gather information on my own. I received an email from Brother Ralph McNeal who I thought was my enemy at the time who to my surprise informed me that many mainstream Masonic Libraries had information on the Compact. He told me that all I needed to do was call or write them and request information. Upon calling the Iowa Masonic Library, I received copies of nearly everything that they had on the Compact in the mail. I had everything that I need to show that the National Compact was an irregular body from the beginning as well as information the lead me to believe that the body that calls itself the National Compact today is not the same body that was formed in 1847.\n\nEven with the information that I had in my possession, I still remained a member of Smooth Ashlar Grand lodge. I felt that I had gone too far. I was Senior Warden of Burkshire Lodge #664, I was worthy patron of Charity Chapter #134, I was a member of King Solomon Royal Arch chapter, and Yorkshire #8 Knights Templar Commandry. I was comfortable. That is until I started to see the things going on in Smooth Ashlar behind the scenes. The first was the missing money in the Grand Lodge. Our lodge would pay taxes to the Grand Lodge and the money would disappear. We would go a whole year without traveling cards, new members never receive certificates. Every event that the Grand Lodge had was an undercover fund raiser. Collection plates were passed around like a church service. Smooth Ashlar Grand Lodge sessions were like street riots, with brothers asking where all the money was. The checks that Smooth Ashlar wrote for the hotels for the session bounced two years in a row. In 2002 the Grand Master expelled the Grand Treasurer for âsingle handedlyâ cleaning the entire treasurer out. The total was something close to $100,000. The other Grand officers wanted us to believe that there was no one else involved. I didnât buy that for a second.\n\nI witnessed many things in Smooth Ashlar Grand Lodge that made me ashamed to be a member of it. I have seen countless occasions of degree selling. For the right price you can achieve any degree that you want. For the low price of $85.00, thirty five Master Masons were given the Mark Master Mason through the to the Knight Templar degrees in a one night class. There was a huge uproar at the following Grand Lodge session about the incident, but it was not about the fact that it was wrong. The problem was that some of the Grand officers did not get their cut of the money. At that time the Shrine of Smooth Ashlar also decided that they would double their price and make any of those brothers Shriners under the table. There was never any control over who was getting degrees and if they were qualified for them. I know for a fact that one of the brothers in the one day York Rite class got all the degrees, the Consistory degrees, and then the Shrine and no one knew where he came from. It later turned out that he was an Nwabian follower of Malachi York. He took all that Smooth Ashlar had to offer and delivered it to Dr. York. I later witnessed this same brother being allowed to pay the overseer of the Grand Lodge hall to hold his own clandestine meetings in the hall. They knew very well that he was an Nwabian clandestine Mason, yet they took his money and gave him full access to the hall. This should not have really surprised me, because I witnessed many brothers from bogus lodges allowed access to meetings in Burkshire and other Lodges under Smooth Ashlar. Any man with grips and passwords was allowed entrance. When any of us would object, we were told that âa Mason is a Mason.\n\nâI have to also touch on the subject of Smooth Ashlarâs much hyped military lodge. The lodge was introduced at the grand Lodge session of 2002, with no explanation of where they came from. They were marching around like a military unit wearing black military jumpsuits. The strange part was that during the session they accompanied Grand Master Campfield everywhere. I later found out that they were assigned to be his personal body guards at the session. The Grand Tyler also wore the military jumpsuit and carried a drawn sword. He no longer guarded the door, but now was never to leave the Grandmasterâs side. The Grandmaster now had his own military outfit, complete with generalâs stars on the collar. In the Smooth Ashlar Master Mason and OES workshop this year, during the Grand Masters opening address to a room full of Masons of various degrees and Eastern Stars, GM Campfield stopped talking and threw up the Grand haling signs of distress of a certain degree in plain view of everyone. The doors of the auditorium were thrown open and the military lodge ran in from different directions and surrounded Campfield. What was the reason for this display? He once again wanted to show off \"Georgiaâs first military lodge,\" as he called it. I have no idea where they get this claim, but I would guess that they did what they do best, they made it up. I never remember a charter being granted at any Grand session. The members of this âmilitary lodgeâ are not even in the military. They say that the term âmilitary lodgeâ comes from their requirement that the members be connected to the military. It does not matter what that connection is. You could have been in the military at one time, high school ROTC, or even just work on a military base. I met one brother who gained membership because his wife was once in the Army. This lodge is a joke, but fits in very well with the rest of Smooth Ashlar.\n\nWith all of this craziness going on in SAGL, I decided that I had enough. I wanted to be in an environment that allowed me to practice Masonry the right way. I wanted to be a member of a lodge that was allowed to do things right, and not do things because that was how they used to do it. I wanted to be a part of a Grand Lodge that had a real history and followed the landmarks of Freemasonry. SAGL made up fictional versions of both. I contacted Brother Ralph McNeal and inquired how I might be healed in Georgia. He put me in contact with Brother Joe Snow who is Grand historian for the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand lodge of Georgia. Brother Snow told me what I needed to do to be healed and he got me stared on my way. I went back to several members of Burkshire Lodge and told them of my intentions. I was surprised to find out that most of them wanted to be healed also. In all there were fifteen of the twenty four brothers that wanted to be healed. Upon us all talking, we worried that an existing lodge might be over whelmed by so many brothers being healed at once. We then came up with the idea of being healed as a lodge. That is where we stand today. An entire lodge healed into The Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Georgia PHA, by the Honorable Willie Williams Grand Master. We changed the name of the Lodge to Exodus Lodge, because we all felt that we had escaped a state of bondage by the grace of God.\n\nI say to any brother that is a member of a bogus or irregular lodge. Donât let anyone stop you from seeking the truth about that affiliation. If someone advises you to stop looking, that should make you look all the harder. If you know that illegal and un-Masonic practices are going on in your lodge or grand lodge donât ignore it, get away from it. Donât get comfortable there like many of us did. Donât stay there because your father or grandfather was a member as many of us did. Every adult man must walk his own path, and your father and grandfather would surely understand that. What you are practicing in that clandestine atmosphere is not Masonry. It is a sad attempt at copying true Masonry. Many say that if all African American Masons could unite we would be a mighty force, and I agree. I pray that all worthy brothers will find their way to true Masonry. This is found in the Prince Hall affiliation. I finally feel that my eyes are open and I am at home.\n\nâ\n\nFraternally,\n\nBrother Bernard Bethea\n\nExodus Lodge UD PHA\n\nThis paper is written to tell of an experience of being a member of an irregular jurisdiction. I am in no way trying to bring about a âwitch huntâ on irregular bodies. I would just like to express my experience and to challenge those that are with irregular bodies to question their authority.\n\nIâve titled this piece Forgotten Treasure because sometimes the sisters are forgotten about. Some feel that itâs not important for us to know, itâs not our business to know and to those I question, why?\n\nLife is forever changing, like the weather â cold, hot, warm, rainy, rarely again to be the exact temperature it was the day before. Change comes whether we want it to or not. We get so fixed in our little world until nothing else matters. Change also means to undergo transformation â to transition. I resisted this change I am about to talk about but eventually I relaxed and took the truth in its purest form and question why was I holding back. I couldnât see clearly and I began to blame and punish myself. After my initial feelings of anger, betrayal, hurt I knew it was something that had to be done. Instead of resisting change I had to take chargeâ¦My grandmother exposed me to the Order at an early age. I would go to many functions with her and was always amazed at the grace the ladies portrayed and how intelligent and nice they were. I would always find ways to emulate my grandmother and would ask her questions about the Order and how to become a member. She was always eager to show me her precious mementos. Sometimes I would find it strange that she would always ask me to go places with her. She would always be at every function and performance I participated in through school and other organizations. We would spend countless hours with one another and she would always tell me that she was preparing me for a lifelong experience. She stated that no matter what happens and what people say, she wanted me to pursue becoming a member of the Order of Eastern Star. I never did question her after that and through high school and college I just kind of put it in the back of my mind. In my eyes to become a member of the Order was much further down the road because what was more impressionable at the time were the college sororities.\n\nI became friends with a lady and weâll just call her âSister Friendâ. We went through school together and both of our families are from Louisiana so we became close from the beginning. After high school she went to college in another state and after college came back home. She would always talk about the sisters and all the different functions, meetings, etc. I never really questioned her much because I knew she was still active with her college sorority so I figured thatâs what it was all about. One day I remember her asking me if I had something white she could borrow and I told her yes. As she was getting dressed I noticed that she was putting on a pin and I immediately recognized it and asked her was she a member of the Eastern Stars. She answered yes and asked me how did I know that symbol. I told her that my grandmother was a member but is inactive now. We got into a conversation as to why havenât I became a member and she felt bad because after all this time she thought I knew she was a member. I told her that I just never pursued it and it didnât interest me at the time and itâs for old ladies. Seems I struck a nerve with her and she told me that she would be by after her meeting to talk to me.\n\nSister Friend asked me for weeks to attend a tea that her chapter was hosting. I initially declined but at the last minute accepted. This was something important to her and after all this time she has been there for me and supported me on all of my endeavors so I felt that I should support her as well. I was quite impressed and shocked. The Order wasnât full of little old ladies and I had a very good time. Iâve never had a problem socializing with others so I just fell right in. Not knowing but I became the center of attention. They begin asking me questions regarding my life, my family, my future and other subjects of the liking. On our drive home Sister Friend just smiled and commented that they liked me. I shrugged my shoulders and didnât think anything else about it. As time went on Sister Friend would invite me out more with her âsistersâ. It became quite a routine and I enjoyed talking with the ladies. She would spend time with me talking about the order and all that she does and what it has done for her. She would always comment and say that it keeps her grounded. I begin to question her more and there were times that she couldnât answer. I would get a little upset because I felt that we had been friends all this time and there was nothing that we didnât or couldnât share with one another. She told me if I really wanted to know â join. I always declined because I felt I didnât have the time for all of the meetings. Sister Friend teased me and stated that I find the time to come to their social functions then I could find the time for a meeting an hour or two each month. And most importantly I should become a member because my husband was a Mason. I then begin to make all kinds of excuses regarding the secrecy and rumors Iâve heard that they are devil worshippers and they sacrifice goats. Sister Friend and my husband would always uphold the Order and Masonry and how proud they were to be members and they would always add, PHA members at that. But I didnât make it easy for them. Finally she asked me if I thought my grandmother and husband were devil worshippers? I really didnât know what to say. Ignorance had me tongue tied. But I would still debate the issues with them and finally we came to a truce because our friendship begin to suffer from it and decided that we just wouldnât talk about the order. My husband told her that I wasnât just ready and when the time comes I will see the light.\n\nAs time passed Sister Friend became less active with the order because she had to spend more time at home with her child and my husband became inactive due to work travel. But it seems something was still pulling me into that direction and my husband wanted to get back active. My husband befriended a new guy at work and found out that he was a Mason. (Weâll just call him Bro. Misguided) Bro. Misguided informed my husband that the Grand Master comes through there all the time and he would like for him to meet him and possibly join their lodge. Bro. Misguided would talk so highly of the GM and how the lodge is in search of brothers especially brothers who were Masons before to help them build up the lodge. My husband agreed to meet the GM and was impressed with the outcome of the meeting. We were invited to their Annual Banquet to meet some of the members. The banquet was nice and we were the guest of the GM and his wife who held the office of Worthy Grand Matron and also Worthy Matron. The GM was very outspoken and talked about Masonry with such zeal. To say the least we were impressed and after the banquet my husband was asked if he made a decision to join. Before answering the GM told him that he wanted to get him in so that he could assist him in teaching the other brothers and after that he would let my husband run his own lodge. The GM then commented on how prestigious his Grand Lodge was and that it will be one of the largest. His comments then went on to express the legality of his grand lodge â that it was recognized worldwide. He receives more recognition than Prince Hall and that Prince Hall was bogus and had no true facts on their legality. The selling point came about when my husband was told that in order to receive all of the degrees in Masonry that he would have had to become a member of a 4 letter (AF&AM) lodge anyway so why not join now. He had to say no more and then proceeded to ask if I was going to join the Eastern Stars. My husband answered that if he joins that I would join. He told me this was my opportunity to actually find out about the order and to not argue about it because itâs a good thing. I didnât resist and agreed to join. We were given the cost of what it would be to join, which was $130.00 for us both, and I was told that the Worthy Matron and Secretary would contact me. We politely paid the joining fees and went about our way.\n\nI was contacted about a week later notifying me of the time, date, place and attire for my initiation. I immediately called my mother and grandmother and they were both excited. My grandmother asked me if I knew the name of the chapter and the affiliation and if I had been investigated because she didnât receive a phone call. My answer - no. She begin to give me all kinds of instructions and what to wear and that she would come to the house to prepare me. The day of my initiation I was filled with reservations. I still wasnât sure if this was the right thing for me but I wanted to make my husband and grandmother happy so I pushed those thoughts aside and prepared myself. As I was getting dressed she made sure that all was in place and that all was white and pure. She gave me one of those talks as to what to do and what not to do and presented me with a small gift box and not to open it until I passed through the five gates. (The gift was her Eastern Star pin.)So I begin my journey (1997)â¦I was a little early so during that time the GM told me the different things the chapter does and how excited he was for me to join and then bluntly asked if I paid my joining fees. I told him yes and showed the receipt. He walked me to his office and told me of the Grand Lodge and Chapter and how it works and the different higher houses that I can become a member of. He also stated to me of the different books that I need to buy and regalia. But I didnât have to purchase all of it right then except the ritual books and bylaws and I could put my regalia on layaway. I kindly shook my head and proceeded to meet the sisters as they walked in. I was told to stay seated as they open the meeting and someone would be down to get me shortly. During that time the GM told me that I would be blindfolded but to not worry it was part of the process. He then goes into telling me of stories of how Prince Hall Chapters initiates and that he doesnât allow all of that foolishness in his lodge. Shortly a gentle and kind lady calls me by my name and states that she will be guide and to trust her. She asked me a few preliminary questions and proceeded to walk me upstairs. At this point I really donât know what to expect but I kept thoughts of my grandmother in my head and that she wouldnât lead me down an unrighteous path. The process was seemingly long and all I could think about was take this blindfold off so I could see what was really going on. As I was brought into the light things seemed normal other than this large signet on the floor. I became a little nervous until I took the âwalk of the labyrinthâ and said to myself that I know all of these stories. This was beginning to be quite interesting as they went into details regarding the heroines and also proper protocol in the chapter. I was quite relieved. The WM introduced me to the sisters once again in their respective stations and they were each told to teach me the grip and password and tell me something about the order.\n\nAfter the initiation process the WM went right into the remainder of the meeting and announced that it was time to elect officers. I sat back and begin to just take notice of the members. They begin to talk amongst each other and already I could sense that there were clicks. I did have a little previous experience with parliamentary procedures and it seems this âelection of officersâ turned into a whoâs my friend election. That seemed to go right pass me and I just sat back. Before the closing the WM stated that she will begin to give assignments out and since I was the only one initiated and the first of the year that I would have the first assignment and present it at the next meeting. My assignment was to study with the sister that was appointed to the âblue point of the starâ and the heroine she represented. I was excited and met with âSister Blueâ after the meeting. We exchanged numbers and she informed me she was a college student. I told her that I would call her and possibly come out her way so it would be no extra expense to her. Before I parted, a sister approached me and she told me to study all I can because I will be charged up and she went her way with a cunning smile. Charged up? What is that? I asked the GM about what is to be charged up and he said that he doesnât teach things like that at his lodge. He stated that theyâre like test questions to make sure that you are a member of the order. Thatâs a Prince Hall thing and its unnecessary and you shouldnât discuss anything pertaining to the order to anyone. Knowing that I had a whole month I still went home and immediately started reading my ritual. I called Sister Blue the next week and left a message. No return call âso it became a ritual of mine to call her every few days. Still no return call and time is winding down. Iâm getting nervous because Iâm not for sure what I am suppose to studying and if there was any additional material I needed and I had questions! So I turn to my grandmother and she assisted me and pointed me in the direction to take my studies to another level. By this time Iâm nervous because Sister Blue still hasnât returned my phone call and the meeting is Saturday. She eventually calls me the day of and states that she will not be at the meeting. She told me if I had questions, to ask them at the meeting. Now, Iâm angry but I know what I have to do. I go to the meeting and as the Secretary is doing roll call she calls out Sister Blue name and no one says anything. She asks has anyone heard from her and I raise my hand and stated what was told to me. After roll call, the WM asks that I sit at that station and if I was ready for my presentation. To say the least my presentation went over well and I was even asked a few questions and so eagerly answered them all. The WM was quite impressed and made a comment that I should study with each star point to make sure they get the same information. Throughout the meeting I asked questions and made comments on the information presented. From that point I was pretty much on my own. We were given a phone list of all the members in the chapter and I made it a point to call each one of them and introduce myself again and ask questions because weeks had passed and I havenât heard from anyone. Months pass and I seem to talk to the WM more than any of the other sisters. I continue to study on my own and bring forth new items to the chapter. Not necessarily new but items that I havenât heard discussed yet. Finally the Secretary befriends me and states that she enjoys the information I bring and if I donât mind studying with her. I accepted and shortly we all begin to study at my house occasionally and they begin to give me the details of the chapter and lodge. I begin to take notice that the membership at the meetings is declining. I was informed that the majority of the ladies were college students and during finals they study and school breaks they go home. Well seems like there were more finals and breaks as normal so I begin to sit back and take notice as to what was going on. Well there seems to be complaints that the GM is not doing things correctly, all heâs worried about is money and heâs taking charge of too much and no one is learning anything. At this time I am sitting at a different station each month because someone didnât come to the meeting. Iâm frustrated because itâs a lot to take in and where are these sisters? They did all this talk about sisterhood and how to make the chapter upstanding and all but no one is taking action. At that time I made it a point to learn all that I could and to take some of the weight off of the WM because it seems that these young ladies are not doing their job.\n\nBy this time announcements are being made about Grand Session. I was told that this is a meeting that is held once a year for all of the lodges and chapters in that jurisdiction and if anyone wanted to elevate into the higher houses they may do so with the approval of the WM and GM. I thought finally I would get a chance to meet some other sisters and brothers. My hopes were diminished because it was the same people I see every month. There were no other chapters. I met a few other brothers but not many. The GM announced that we all we be in this meeting. He doesnât agree with the separate meetings and that it was a privilege for the sisters to be included in the Grand Session meeting with the brothers. The GM opens the meeting and weâre all told that there will be a $25.00 representation fee for each member and that if you were behind in your dues you had to pay your dues first and if you couldnât pay the $25.00 fee you would not be able to vote or have a say in the decisions made during the meeting. As brothers and sisters came into the meeting the GM would call them up to the Secretaryâs desk and begin questioning them of their financial business in front of everyone. As he is going through the meeting agenda he goes off on a tangent of paying dues and supporting the grand lodge. He made a statement that if you donât pay your dues â donât expect any type of assistance from the lodge. Then his next tangent was to explain that this grand lodge was a legal and upstanding grand lodge. The GM went to explain how the charters were obtained and that we were recognized worldwide and had amenity with the GL of Scotland. Before he closes the meeting he asks that all that will be elevated to stay and the others may go. As I was about to leave he told me to stay put because he wanted to make sure I received my high degrees. I questioned what were the high degrees and he told me - Queen of the South, Amaranth, and Heroines of Jericho and Daughters of the Sphinx. He stated that he needed to elevate as many sisters as he could to get those houses active and if I would assist him and the WM in seeing to that. I kindly accepted and he bestowed upon me and the other sisters each obligation from every house. After that he stated how much the dues are and we needed to purchase our rituals for each house and begin to set up meetings. Needless to say my first Grand Session was not a very good one. I came out of there more confused than I went in. Now Iâm questioning whatâs a charter? Whoâs the GL of Scotland? What are these higher houses all about?\n\nAt the next meeting I was approached by the GM to become a Board Member at his request because he needed sisters to be on the board. I asked what all did I have to do and he stated that I would need to attend the quarterly meetings and assist with updating the bylaws and constitution. I said okay and he stated that to become a Board Member it would cost $250.00 for a lifetime membership and $10.00 every meeting. He told me that I could pay the $250.00 out in time but he really wanted me to become a member so that I could help him get things moving with the lodge and chapter. I kindly accepted.\n\nDuring the next two years membership is declining at a fast rate. Sisters and Brothers both are unhappy as to the practices of the lodge and chapter. Brothers are quitting at a fast rate because they feel that everything is being âshortcuttedâ meaning brothers are coming in off the street receiving their 3 degrees in one day and basically paying their way up the ladder to receive the degrees of the higher houses. Pretty much the requirement was to come to meetings and pay your dues. Sisters were tired of him trying to run the meetings and doing as he pleases. The main complaint was that he was bringing in sisters to become members and no one knew these people and we would find out the day of the meeting. All of his talk was of money. His teachings became sermons of discontent with what we were doing wrong. He would talk about us buying paraphernalia from other places and not supporting the grand lodge was a violation of the bylaws. Flags were raised because along with the Macoy ritual we had to purchase the ritual book for that jurisdiction that was written by the GM. It was basically a shortcut version of the Macoy ritual with slight variations and at times was confusing because he would tell us to use that ritual in conjunction with the Macoy ritual. When we would question those items he would get upset thinking we were trying to ban his ritual. We learned both rituals and made adjustments when necessary due to the arrangement of the chapter room.\n\nEveryone was pretty much getting disgusted because in other Masonic communities we were irregular. I knew nothing of what irregular or bogus was until a PHA sister and brother approached me. I was asked of my affiliation and was immediately told that I was bogus. I asked why and no one could answer me. They would just say oh, you donât have a charter. I asked the question to the GM and he proudly showed me the âcharterâ from the state we reside in and the paperwork from Washington. The GM would talk on lengths on how irregular Prince Hall was and that we should not succumb to their ways and let them lie to us. He stated that he has challenged Prince Hall and they couldnât produce a charter. He went on to talk at great lengths of his Masonic past and being a member of the âGrand United Congressâ and how he has the authority to start lodges and chapter anywhere in the world and that I should feel privileged to be a part of an organization that is recognized worldwide unlike Prince Hall. I begin to ask him to tell me of these other jurisdictions and where they came from. He went on to state the history of Prince Hall up to where he became a Mason and said that Prince Hall started creating lodges without a charter. He went on to state that Prince Hall finally received his charter from the Grand Lodge of England but after sometime was dropped and never received the proper authority again to operate. He went on to give accolades to John G. Jones for his work in Masonry and Shrinedom and for âleavingâ Prince Hall. I took what he said as being truth because after all he was the GM and a man with 40 years of experience in Masonry. He has to know what he is talking about and I went about my way.\n\nAs time goes on the sisters are bonding and we have set a standard as to how we want our chapter to operate. Weâre coming along with our studies, participating and creating community and volunteer service projects and making a respectful stand for our chapter. But there is still that lingering problem of the GM wanting to control everything. We decided to have fundraisers so that the chapter could have an active budget. We were told that we couldnât do that it and would have to put the funds in the Grand Lodge bank account. That raised many flags and the GM was questioned about that but the outcome was still null and void. Whenever there is a situation that is brought to his attention it turns into a âquestioning of his authorityâ and he makes it a point to seat you or remove you. We wanted to intermingle with other chapters and he didnât approve of it but said it would have to be done on our own time. So by this time its getting tiring because nothing can be done without his approval and there is no one to replace him if voted out. Still then Iâm sure he would find some bylaw that would protect him. By this time weâre losing valuable members due to ethics that should be practiced but are not and I begin to open my eyes wider on what is going on with this jurisdiction. I begin to research and visit other chapters and have befriended many good sisters along the way. I begin to question why is it that we donât attend these conventions? Why are we not in communication with other lodges and chapters? Why does Prince Hall have all of these jurisdictions but are still being called bogus? Is it something Iâm not being told here? Yes, there is a lot that I was not told and a lot within this jurisdiction that I cannot correct.\n\nIts very tiresome to know that the work and effort you put into something will go no further than the paper it is written on and that the jurisdiction you belong to will go no further than where it is now. The membership has decreased drastically and itâs the chapter that keeps it running. Its one thing to belong to an irregular organization but its also another thing to belong to one that has no future. So instead of continually being blind I opted to search for light. My reasons for leaving this jurisdiction go deeper than the trivial issues that have been experienced. One thing that I donât want to do is experience this again and to stop learning. During my search I found truth and have learned to appreciate the efforts of those that are working to preserve the rich history and tenets that this organization was built on. My intentions are to not only search for the truth but to practice the truth in a legal and competent jurisdiction. So the next time you see me, put your sunglasses on because this light may blind you!\n\nâHe who practices the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be manifested as having been wrought in God. (John 3:21)FOUND: PRICELESS TREASUREI petitioned and on February 23,2002 I became a member of McCullough - P. Wolridge #12 â Norris Wright Cuney Grand Chapter of Texas â PRINCE HALL AFFILIATED. I must give thanks to Bro. Joe Snow for his efforts and patience on educating me on the rich history of Prince Hall and to understand the difference between regular and irregular Masonic bodies. With his assistance and guidance and encouragement from Bro. Bey, Bro. McNeal and Bro. Stanley, the transition was one of success for myself and other members of my previous chapter.\n\nI begin to have reservations because I was leaving friends and my âcomfort zoneâ. But I had to reflect on how effective I would be now knowing the truth. How can I continue to live a lie? How can I lecture on being a good Eastern Star if I wasnât being true to myself nor the order? I knew what I had to do and it wasnât an easy road. I battled the decision to just leave and not say anything or inform the sisters and brothers of what we were dealing with. I felt obligated to at least pass on the information that had been given to me and give them the truth in its purest form as it was given to me. Even at the cost of losing friends and my integrity being questioned, I felt I was doing the right thing. It became a battle of me vs. the jurisdiction. With the assistance from the brothers on the Commission, it was a battle that I gladly suited up for. I presented the information to include references so that they each had the opportunity to research this for themselves. I didnât want this to be a conversation that only the brothers would have and come back and tell the sisters, âeverything is okayâ or âthis doesnât concern you.â We all are entitled to the truth to better enable us to make conscience decisions.\n\nI was invited to come to the lodge and meet with the sisters and ask any questions that I had. It was a greeting that will be remain etched in my memory forever. I gave an introduction of myself and was introduced to each sister that was present. They each greeted me with love and it was as if you were seeing an old girlfriend â excited, friendly, warm and caring. They were eager to tell me things about the chapter and how satisfied they are being members of this jurisdiction. Everyone stressed the points that they are constantly learning and the Worthy Matron always test and makes sure that all members are kept abreast on the business of the order. From that short time I knew that I was in the right place. I asked around to other sisters of the order regarding this chapter and was given positive reviews. I begin to feel that my journey has been fulfilled when I received the phone call informing me to come to the next meeting in all white because my time had come to truly âwalk in the lightâ. I immediately called my grandmother and this time I could answer her questions regarding the name of the chapter, affiliation, the Worthy Matron and location. I even told her the things that the sisters shared with me regarding the chapter. She was extremely proud that I have finally found my place in the order. Surprisingly, she expressed to me that she wanted to get back active once I became a member and do things she planned for us to do. That in itself confirmed to me that I was on the right path. All of my reservations and feelings of not being accepted were dispelled.\n\nWhen the Worthy Matron banged her gavel and announced that I was now a member of McCullough â P. Wolridge #12 â PRINCE HALL AFFILIATED I was overjoyed with happiness and a sense of accomplishment. Weâre always told to go after what we want, follow your dreams, etc. But something that stayed etched in my mind when I asked my mother what should I do. Her response was, âDo the right thing. If you can believe a lie, then you can believe the truth.â I have listened to the opinions and lies of others and chose to believe them because I didnât know the truth. But before I blame others, I had to look at the lies I told myself. I became dependent on a bad situation and used it as a crutch â an excuse for not living up to my potential. So now was the time to re-focus that energy to a more positive situation. My holding pattern had been broken and I am free.\n\nIf you donât care to know the truth, any lie will do. To my brothers and sisters who are members of bogus / irregular bodiesâ¦when are you going to get tired of âany old lieâ?\n\nFeeling like most men, who as they mature develop a sense of community and the need to contribute to the betterment of our world, I decided to seek the assistance of like minded men, hoping to fulfill the concerns of my own heart and mind. Little did I know that my journey to fulfill that need would be so long and tumultuous, but nevertheless, educational.\n\nBeing a veteran of the Navy, I have had the opportunity to travel our terrestrial house quite a bit. And in my travels I have seen many things of beauty that have caused me to reflect upon my own life as a man, a father, a son, and husband. But one of the things of beauty that truly caught my attention was, while still in the Navy and stationed in Stuttgart, Germany, I witnessed the constant display of unity shown by and reverential respect shown to a tightly knit group of sharp men. The thing I noticed most was that they always seemed to be together all the time and enjoyed each others company. Plus, when they announced any type of function they were sponsoring, it created a big buzz around the base, with everyone almost in sheer anticipation on attending or in some why contributing to its success.\n\nAfter observing these men for some time, I knew I wanted to be a part of them and experience the same joy, respect, and camaraderie that they gave each other when I saw them. After more thought, I finally gained the courage to ask. I noticed one of the groups that usually hung together leaving the chow hall (Dining Facility). I stopped them, introduced myself and told them that I had been checking them out for quite some time and that I wanted to join their âmenâs groupâ. Needless to say, they all echoed Menâs Group! and in good spirit, laughed at me for calling them such.\n\nHowever, one of them with patience proceeded to inform me that they were not just some type of âmenâs groupâ, but that they were in fact Masons. I said okay, and inquired as to what did I have to do to become a one. The first question he asked me was how long did I have left on station (in Stuttgart)? I informed him that I only had two months left on station and that I was leaving the Navy once I left there. He told me that I didnât have enough time left on station to complete the required work, but that he would sit down and talk with me anyway and give me potential contacts in the area that I was going once I left Stuttgart.\n\nWell, this is where my Masonic nightmare begins. Upon my arrival in Atlanta, I asked my then barber, who proclaimed to be a mason, about becoming a member of the lodge he was a member of. He informed me that I was right on time, because âtheyâ were starting a new lodge in that area and were gathering petitions. Stupidly, I assumed two things about this Masonic barber. One: Since he was black that he was a Prince Hall Mason and Two: that this new lodge was going to be a properly constituted and chartered lodge within a Prince Hall Grand Lodge jurisdiction. However, as I later found out, both my assumptions only made an âassâ out of me. But, I must continue by saying that at this point, lodge and jurisdictional legitimacy was all scrambled eggs to me and meant nothing. My desire was to be a Mason and to emulate what I saw displayed in Germany amongst those Masons there.\n\nAfter receiving the petition Bro. Ruffian, the Masonic barber told me to return the petition to him with a $180 dollar money order so they could vote on it and arrange an investigation. He told me to make the money order out to Nehemiah Lodge #033, Sons of St. Joseph Grand Lodge of Georgia, which prompt me to ask him, where do I have to put Prince Hallâs name?\n\nWell Bro. Ruffian went on to explain that we werenât going to be a part of Prince Hall; since Prince Hall wasnât really a legitimate body, but that this new lodge and jurisdiction would be under the authority of the United Supreme Council of the World, whoâs location was out in California, which was ran by S.G.I.G Dr. J.P. Jeckyll (not real name). He went on to state that our Grand Lodge was going to be Sons of St. Joseph Grand Lodge of Georgia and itâs Grand Master Bro. Billy D. Ceever, 33rd (not real name).He further said that it didnât matter whose lodge I became a part of because we were all the same, because we all took the same oath and obligation. Well like a true novice, I took Bro. Ruffianâs word for gospel and proceeded to become a Mason. Shortly thereafter, I was investigated and told to keep my calendar open for the next week, because they could call me at any time and tell me where to meet them for initiation. Well, true to form, thatâs exactly what happened. One Saturday evening, I received a phone call and the other person on the phone told me to meet Bro. Ruffian and four other candidates at a Ramada Inn Hotel to be initiated that night. The first thing I can remember thinking was, âI thought Masons met in a lodge like the guys in Germany did, but oh well.â I was subsequently, Passed in that same hotel room as well, but Raised, in a church nearby. At my Raising, is where I had the opportunity to meet the man who was self-appointed or selected to be our first Grand Master Bro. Billy D. Ceever, 33rd.Bro. Billy D. Ceever later told us that he had been a member of the Prince Hall family for more than 20 years and was supposedly headed to take a prominent leadership station within the jurisdiction of Delaware. However, due to âotherâ ill wishing Brothers within that jurisdiction he was âcastâ out and black balled, âfor some reason.â And that the same Brothers with far reaching hands, informed the Masonic leadership in Atlanta of his whereabouts, so they would know to look out for him and cast him a cold shoulder as well.\n\nAgain, I took every word that came out of this knowledgeable manâs mouth as true gospel. Because I knew that there was no way under heaven that such a man would lie to me or to any of us (Yeah Right!!!).\n\nAs time went on I became the jurisdictions most ardent student. I read everything I could get my hands on and took on every challenge and challenger that came near me. Those opposed to Masonry I was willing to crush or die trying, all I needed was an excuse for me to attack you and I didnât care. Little old church going ladies included. Say something anti-Masonic and they would let their Pitbull loose (me), and if my attacking you led to blood shed then so be it, I loved Masonry too much to see it injured by anybody.\n\nI was finally a Mason and proud of it. I had a job to do. I had to assist these Brothers with building a jurisdiction, so I went about my duties with all the zeal my body could muster. I would leave my regular day job and 4:30pm, get home and kiss my wife and baby daughter Hello and Good-bye at the same time, grab me a sandwich, go down to the new Grand Lodge office and work there until 9:30pm or 10:30pm at night. Go to sleep and proceed with the same routine the next day and the day after that. The feeling of being proud of my Fraternity kept me going. However, that feeling of pride also made me stupid and covered me with a thick coat of ignorance.\n\nNehemiah Lodge #033 began to get noticed. Bro. Ruffian, became the sitting Worshipful Master and I was elected Senior Warden. We participated in charity events for the homeless, provided shelter for abused women and participated in a major Senior Citizens event that was sponsored by the Mayorâs office in Atlanta. From the outside we looked like that tightly knit group of men that I first saw in Germany, however from the inside we began to smell like over run sewage. As we began to receive more coverage for our charity work, Bro. Ruffianâs name would appear in different media outlets and be credited with being the âleaderâ of our lodge.\n\nNeedless to say, our Grand Master Bro. B. D. Ceever, 33rd, became increasingly jealous at the exposure Bro. Ruffian and the lodge were receiving. He (the GM) felt that if anyone should get any exposure at all, it should be him, because he was the one who started the jurisdiction in the first place and the only reason that we were Masons was because âheâ had put âhisâ seal of approval on it. If it werenât for him none, of us would belong to the Fraternity!â¦ as he later screamed at us. The shock and pain I felt within the inner chambers of my heart were paralyzing, I couldnât believe what I was hearing, but I didnât have a lot of time to hurt, because there was more to come.\n\nBro. Billy D. Ceever, 33rd, told us that in order to build a strong jurisdiction, we had to move into other areas and spread our fraternal philosophy to others that might not otherwise receive it, without our help. He recommended that we start in his hometown of Blakley, Georgia, which would be the ideal place to introduce the people there to the greatest philosophy the world has known. And, that since Blakley was such a small town, we would be the first âlegitimateâ Masonic lodge in that area, because there was no other Masons there. (Liar!!!)So on a rainy Saturday morning and like Black Knights in shiny silver armor. At least fifteen of us packed into ours hoopties and melted the pavement, determined to initiate, pass, and raise (all in one day) those poor souls who had no knowledge of what Masonry was. We were hell bent on giving them the correct version before anyone else got hold of them, especially members of Prince Hall.\n\nThe plan was that when we got to town and since he and his family had mega clout there (in Blakley) we would first stop and get breakfast and then proceed down to the town hall and begin our work. After the degree work was completed we would conduct a lodge of instruction, and then the âtownâ would host a fish fry for us, that had been planned by the new Brothers and his family. Well, that was plan A. And, as far as I can remember, we didnât have a plan B. In fact we felt that we didnât need a plan B, because no one was going to dare disturb his plans or interrupt what we had come to Blakley, Georgia, too do.\n\nWell, when we drove into town we decided to stop at a fast food restaurant to get breakfast and relax for a moment. Bro. Ceever, 33rd, said he would continue on into town to make sure that everything was in place and ready to go. As we were sitting there, dressed in traditional Masonic dress, we could hear people beginning to whisper at the sight of the new strangers that were in town. We felt proud, good even, that we were being noticed by the towns people, and plus, our egos even told us we looked good and we were there to introduce Freemasonry to that little oleâ town. However, as we wallowed in the slop of our egos, what initially escaped us was the fact that we werenât the only men proclaiming to be Masons in that restaurant that morning.\n\nOne of the Brothers, whispered out and said, âHey man! Check out that old man sitting in the corner, look at his hands.â As we turned to look at the old man in the corner, who was eating his breakfast slowly, silently, and with observation, the first thing that caught all of our attention was the beautiful square and compass that engulfed the ring that sat on his right had ring finger. At that point the old man noticed that we were watching him, finished his breakfast and left the restaurant peacefully.\n\nAbout twenty minutes thereafter, Bro. Billy D. Ceever, 33rd returned to the restaurant looking a bit bewildered. All of us noticed the confused look on his face and immediately asked what was wrong. He began to tell us that there would be some changes to our previous plan. He went on to explain, that there were some Prince Hall Masons that had ârecentlyâ moved into town, started a lodge and was now in cohorts with the local Caucasian lodge there to run us out of town. (All this had supposedly happened the same morning)Once again, pure shock! What! Prince Hall Masons! Where? I thought we were the âfirstâ Masons in this town. What do you mean Caucasian Lodge? Since when did they start talking to âusâ? He went on to tell us, that we werenât going to be able to complete our degree work in the town hall meeting room, because âthoseâ other Masons had closed that off to us. And the âtownâ fish fry? Not!! The guy that owned the restaurant that was going to sponsor the event, suddenly had to close his shop for inventory. Bro. Ceever, 33rd went on to say that he had went by the local recreational facility, in hopes to secure a room there, the guy there said flat out, NO! He later informed us that, the guy was a member of the local Caucasian lodge and didnât think too highly of outsiders invading their âsharedâ territory.\n\nUndeterred, he finally found, what I believed to be one sympathizer who let us ârentâ his church basement to initiate, pass, and raise our new Brothers for a fee, which we had to reach in our pockets and pay him, right then and there. I couldnât believe what had happened to us. There was a bright future for us in that town, well at least until we met that quiet old man sitting in the corner of that restaurant minding his business, eating his breakfast and with a watchful eye, closely observing us in our egotistical filth, but as I know now, that wouldnât be the last Mike Tyson blow to my mug.\n\nAt a fundraiser we were sponsoring, there were some Brothers from Smooth Ashlar Grand Lodge, Prince Hall (O)riginated that were in attendance. As we were standing around talking with each other, another Brother from their jurisdiction walked up and joined in the conversation. To this day, I donât know what prompted the Brother to ask, but he did. He looked at our appointed Deputy Grand Master Bro. B. Gullible II, 32nd, and ask, âExactly, where did you guys receive you charter, and if you got it from the United Supreme Council of The World, just where did they originate and get their authority from?\n\nâAt that point, I was self assured that our Deputy Grand Master knew all he needed to know and was going to rip a mud hole in that Brother just for questioning such a thing. Well, after thinking about it a second or two, my Deputy Grand Master, our Deputy Grand Master, shook his head and said, âI donât knowâ. Again, pain rushed through my body and literally paralyzed me once again. My mouth dried and I couldnât talk. I realized that in street language, we had just been âpunked outâ by someone from another jurisdiction. Whatâs even more appalling is the fact that I didnât know either, nor did any other Brother at that fish fry. We were all put to shame, but for the better.\n\nFrom that moment on, Brothers began to immediately ask questions. Questions, our Grand Master couldnât answer and didnât want to answer, so instead of accounting for the obvious he in turn started turning one Brother against the other. Needlessly, stabbing Brothers in the back, circulating bad rumors to wives and loved ones, and emptying bank accounts.\n\nSubsequently, we all left the lodge and jurisdiction all together and the lodges within the jurisdiction eventually folded. Some Brothers, saw the light sooner than others, and made there exit long before Grand Master Billy D. Ceever, started on his path of destruction. And from what I have been told by Bro. Ruffian, who remains a good friend of mine to this day, our former Grand Master, lost his wife, his job, his house and eventually went to jail for some reason or the other, but most of all he lost sincere Brotherly Love.\n\nThereafter, my wife (sheâs active duty Army) received orders to Naples, Italy and while not fully recovered from my shock, disappointment and heart-break, I started to see the image of that group of guys again that I had observed and met in Germany. Most of all, I loved Masonry too much just to sit on my laurels (a$$) and watch others do the work, I knew I was commissioned to contribute too and participate in.\n\nAfter a period of observation, I once again approached a group of men who identified themselves as being Prince Hall Masons (this time I made damn sure!) and members of the local lodge there in Naples. Immediately, I knew I was HOME!!!In April of 1999, I petitioned and became a member of Mediterranean Lodge #149, Free and Accepted Masons, Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge, Jurisdiction of Oklahoma. In 2000 I sat the seat of Worshipful Master. In 2001 I was made a Past Master.\n\nBecause of the many blessings that I have received and my appreciation for the Brothers that fight arduously to keep Prince Hall Freemasonry untainted, pure, and true to form, is the reason I had to share my story. In my Masonic travels I have met too many good men whoâs ambition and enthusiasm to serve humanity through Prince Hall Freemasonry, have been taken advantage of and met the same fate as my aspirations did early in my so-called Masonic career. I have vowed to rid our honorable Fraternity of such people, men and women both.\n\nGreetings Brethren and those seeking to knock upon the door to Masonry.\n\nI came out of an irregular Grand Lodge named Hiram Grand Lodge of New York. Located in Harlem, New York off of Lenox Avenue and 124th, this Grand Lodgeâs origin is detailed in another section of this website so I need not digress into that thread as that information came from me.\n\nI sought Masonry back in the early summer of the year AL 6000, or 2000 A.D. Like most, I searched on the Internet by entering âmasonâ into a search engine and printed out the first ten that popped up. Later that evening, upon reaching home, I went back online and read each site.\n\nOf course, Prince Hall came up once or twice and I read those a few times over. I studied what I could and decided this was a fraternity in which I should seek membership. For those, like myself, who pledged a college fraternity and thought something is still missing, I found the subject of Freemasonry wholly enlightening and the history that appears to delve into antiquity, beyond interesting. When I discovered that most of the African-American Greek lettered organizations [generally known as BGLOâs, or black Greek letter organizations] were founded by Prince Hall masons and a few of the sororities by members of the Order of Eastern Star [especially my fraternityâs founder and his beau], I thought, at first, all African American men who were masons were Prince Hall. There was nothing to say they werenât. However, I did not research deep enough because, as I later found out, there was also nothing that said they were, either.\n\nThat weekend I opened my yellow pages phone book and looked up fraternities, social organizations andâ¦bingo! I found the MWPHGLNYâs number and, lo and behold, they were located not eight [8] blocks from me. Placing a call to them, I was greeted by an answering machine. I left a message detailing my interest in joining the organization and desire to learn more about what this locationâs lodge did in my community.\n\nThree days later, I still had no return call. I called back and left another message. By that weekâs end, I still had not heard from them. Frustrated, I drove up there one evening after bringing my son home. There was no one there. The following day I took my wife to Queens to help a friend shop for her wedding dress. While I was driving past Murdock Blvd I remembered my friendâs sister was an Eastern Star who lived right on Murdock and Springfield Blvd! I drove over to their home and, luckily she was homeâ¦actually packing up as they were moving! Great timing. I took her aside and told her of my interest about masonry and explained the difficulty I was having contacting the lodge nearest me [as far as I knew the only one since none other were listed]. She gave me the number of a brother in Queens and said he didnât live far from my mother in Rochdale Village. I hopped back in the car, dialing his number on my cell phone, steering all the while toward my motherâs area of Queens.\n\nHe was home, we chatted briefly, and he suggested I come by. Heck, I was already within five blocks of his home! I stopped at my motherâs place, to kill time, and continued over to his house about a half hour later.\n\nAfter a good conversation with this brother I learned he was the founder of this particular lodge, back in 1974, and the grand lodge was Hiram Grand Lodge basedâ¦now get thisâ¦back in Harlem! I mentioned that I did some research and didnât find this GL listed and called another one that was not too far from me off 155th, but no one returned my calls. He just shrugged and said âWell, youâre here now so it worked out.â I filled out the petition, left a deposit andâ¦a few months later I was raised to Master Mason on October 14, 2000. Now the story takes a turn.\n\nNovember 2001 found me online and subscribing to various freemasonry lists, predominately those of yahoo groups. One in particular started me on another path. I got on the PHA research list group and introduced myself and where I hailed [heleâd] from as was the requirement. After reading a few emails, I canât recall what was exactly said, but my response elicited a back channel reply from Bro. Harmon Weston, PHA out of the very same Prince Hall Grand Lodge I attempted to contact before. We emailed a few times back and forth and he was kind enough to explain this thing called âbloodlineâ and âirregularityâ and being âclandestineâ. I was, to say the least, a bit ticked off at first. He suggested I go to the Grand Lodge of New Yorkâs own library and do the research myself as nothing is hidden. I did just that but also arranged to meet with Bro. Weston with another brother who was raised with me. We met at Deanâs CafÃ© in Brooklyn and that opened my eyes a little wider.\n\nThe night Bro. Weston and I met at Deanâs CafÃ© my lodge had an instructional meeting. As it was breaking up I asked the past master, whose home we were having the meeting, if I could get some contact information on other lodges in our jurisdiction that I might stop by and meet them. After all, I was a Traveling Man, no? He said heâd get it for me next time as he couldnât find them just then. I thanked him and left for my meeting with Bro. Weston.\n\nDuring that week I must have called this past master three times asking him for this information. Finally, I let it drop.

I done had my fill. I started thinking back to my initiation and thereafter. I thought about my being passed and my raising. All that studying I had done and no one ever asked me one question from my catechisms. I was even told to stay away from ââ¦that Internet!â Even more interesting was learning that Bro. Rashied had left the very same Grand Lodge I was then a member of. In fact, he took his entire lodge out of there. Was this the person Iâve heard brothers whisper about? This particular brother later invited me to witness an installation ceremony held in May of 2001 at the Grand Lodge of New York on 23rd Street in Manhattan. There I was able to meet the GMâs from Haiti, Romania, Italy and several other prominently known members of the Craft. All were amenable and easily approachable.
