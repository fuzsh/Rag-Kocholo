        "text": "\"It's sad to see such a beautiful, historic building go,\" one resident told Patch.\n\nAURORA, IL â€” An Aurora landmark has been destroyed by fire and now the city plans to demolish the remaining parts of the building to keep residents safe. Firefighters have been battling the blaze at the historic Masonic Temple since around 10 p.m. Tuesday, when a bystander called to report the fire.\n\nAs of 6 p.m., the fire was still smoldering.\n\nAccording to Aurora Fire Department Battalion Chief Jim Rhodes, two exterior walls of the nearly 100-year-old building collapsed during the fire.\n\nSeveral streets were closed in downtown Aurora Monday night after what's been described as a \"major\" fire broke out in the 100 block of South Lincoln Avenue.\n\nOn social media, residents shared video that showed the fire apparently tearing through the city's abandoned Lincoln Masonic Temple.\n\nResidents were advised to avoid the area as crews continued to work to extinguish the flames in the historic building.\n\nHector Ortiz said he lives near the Masonic Temple and walked close by to take photographs and video.\n\nOrtiz told Patch, \"[I]t's sad to see such a beautiful historical building go. Wish there would have been more efforts to protect and preserve the building in previous years after it closed down.\"\n\nJust after 11 p.m., ComEd reported more than 500 people without power in the area.\n\nThe Masonic Temple was built in 1922 and had since been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nNo injuries have been reported at press time.\n\nFire officials are still investigating the cause of the blaze.\n\nThis is a developing story; check back for updates.\n\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
