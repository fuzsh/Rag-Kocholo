        "text": "ABOUT THE CHICAGO BUILDING CONGRESS MERIT AWARDS\n\nThere is no other association activity that more perfectly defines the mission of the Chicago Building Congress than its Merit Award Program. The Merit Awards have celebrated the building industry since 1956 by singling out the outstanding projects in greater Chicagoland built during the past three years.\n\nCBC Merit Awards\n\nThursday, May 9, 2024\n\nMorgan Manufacturing\n\n401 North Morgan Street, Chicago, IL 60642\n\nTHANK YOU TO OUR SPONSORS!\n\nPLATINUM LEVEL SPONSOR\n\nEVENT LEVEL SPONSORS\n\nGOBO SPONSOR\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nQ: Who can enter the Merit Awards?\n\nA: Anyone can enter the Merit Awards with a project that has been completed within three (3) years of submission.\n\nQ: If my company is not a CBC member, can we still enter our project(s)?\n\nA: Yes, if your company is not a CBC member, you can still enter as many projects as you like by selecting the non-member section of the form.\n\nQ: What are the Merit Award Categories?\n\nA: The Merit Award Categories reflect Chicagoland’s ever-changing construction landscape. Here are the categories:\n\nEducation – Pre K through 12\n\nEducation – Higher Education\n\nHealthcare\n\nResidential/Hospitality\n\nCommercial Construction UNDER $50 Million\n\nCommercial Construction OVER $50 Million\n\nRenovation & Adaptive Reuse UNDER $20 Million\n\nRenovation & Adaptive Reuse OVER $20 Million\n\nInfrastructure or Industrial Construction\n\nInterior Build-Out\n\nPlease remember that multiple projects can be submitted for multiple categories, however the same project cannot be entered into more than one category.\n\nQ: Can I enter several projects?\n\nA: Yes, you can enter as many projects as you like. Each project entered will require project details, contact information (including those key subs), and payment. However, you can enter several projects using one electronic form.\n\nQ: Can we enter a project outside of Chicagoland or Illinois?\n\nA: The primary purpose of the Merit Awards is to recognize outstanding projects in the Chicagoland area and surrounding counties. However, in the past some projects have been submitted built in Illinois and of course were seriously considered.\n\nQ: What is the timeline for each phase of the Merit Awards?\n\nA: Here is the timeline for each phase of the 2024 Merit Awards:\n\nMerit Award SUBMISSION DEADLINE: Extended to February 6, 2024\n\nMerit Award PROJECT DETAILS FORM & PHOTOS DEADLINE: February 8, 2024\n\n(Projects must be completed by December 31, 2023.)\n\nEmail Notification Sent to Finalists Scheduling In-Person Presentations: February 2024\n\nFinalists’ Presentations & Judging Dates to Determine Winners: February 22, March 19, 20, 27, & April 3, 2024\n\nMERIT AWARDS GALA: May 9, 2024\n\nQ: When must a project be completed to be eligible for the Merit Awards?\n\nA: Projects completed within the last three years, and by Dec., 31, 2023 are eligible for the Merit Awards.\n\nQ: If we have entered a project in a previous Merit Awards Program, can we enter it again for this year’s Merit Awards?\n\nA: Previously entered Merit Award projects can be re-entered, as long as they have been completed within the last three years, and were not selected as Merit Award winners.\n\nQ: How do I enter projects for the Merit Awards?\n\nA: Entering your projects is easy! Simply go here, enter contact information, your project title, and select a category. You can pay for your entry (or more than one) right online. If you have more than one project you are entering, you can do them all in the same registration.\n\nQ: How much is it to enter a project?\n\nA: Each project registered is $300 for CBC Members, and $600 for non-members.\n\nQ: What if I enter a project, and the budget increased placing me into a different category, what should I do?\n\nA: If you are close to the original project budget, keep the project in the same category. If however, the budget/expenditures has vastly exceeded your original estimates, please contact cbc@chicagobuildingcongress.org.\n\nQ: How are the projects judged?\n\nA: A panel of dedicated industry professionals volunteer to judge all presentations. This includes owners, developers, contractors, subcontractors, and those in services to the construction industry. Judges select the top five entries in each category based on the criteria below. Remember to include these in your submission and (if selected as a finalist) in the finalist presentation:\n\nDistinctive, functional, or innovative design\n\nQuality of construction\n\nImpact of the project on the community and inclusion initiatives\n\nSafety record\n\nQ: What is the process for judging?\n\nA: The first meeting is to determine finalists from the Merit Award entries, and the second and third judging sessions select the winners in each category. These dates are tentatively scheduled to take place in February and March. There is usually a backup date scheduled in April. The Merit Awards take place in May.\n\nQ: How can I get involved as a Merit Award judge? Are there certain criteria I need to meet?\n\nA: Thanks for your interest in the Merit Award judging process. We have two criteria to be a Merit Award judge:\n\nYour company must be a CBC Member with dues paid up-to-date.\n\nYour expertise in the construction industry. As a CBC member serving the construction industry, your expertise is needed to help identify finalists and the winners of the Merit Awards.\n\nQ: Interested in being a Merit Award judge?\n\nA: A panel of dedicated CBC members volunteer to judge all the presentations.
