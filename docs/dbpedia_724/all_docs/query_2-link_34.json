        "text": "On October 8, 2019, the historic Aurora Masonic Lodge was still smoldering from the previous nightsâ€™ fire. Aurora building and fire department officials were concerned that the 5 story building would collapse destroying adjacent homes and utilities. Time was of the essence to remove the unstable walls. Adjacent roads were closed and homes were evacuated.\n\nThe city solicited bids on October 9th, Alpine Demo Company was awarded the project on the 10th and was on site the 11th starting the demolition process.\n\nThe project was completed without damaging adjacent property, and historic columns were also salvaged during the process. The site was restored to a clean lot. Contact us to learn more about our commercial demolition services in Aurora.\n\nWe love the work we've accomplished with our clients! Here's what some have to say about their experience with Alpine."
