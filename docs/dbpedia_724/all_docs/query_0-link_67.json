The first tower, at 1400 W Randolph Street, will be a 25-story mixed-use building. The second tower, at 1440 W Randolph Street will be an 11-story residential structure. The project site is located along W Randolph Street, with 1400 W Randolph sitting on a corner lot at the intersection of W Randolph Street and N Ogden Avenue. 1440 W Randolph Avenue sits on an interior lot along W Randolph Street between N Ogden Avenue and W Lake Street, across the street from Union Park. The nearest public transportation is Ashland CTA L station, serviced by the Green and Pink Lines, a five-minute walk away from either property.
