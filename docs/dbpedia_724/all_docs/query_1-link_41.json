A Temple was constructed on the site and dedicated in 1832, but initially could not be owned by the Grand Lodge because of legal limitations on the value of real estate that the Grand Lodge could hold. Turnagain Alley became Temple Place and the Temple School, established by Bronson Alcott, was housed there during the 1830s. The Temple also held a concert hall and was the site of many public lectures by Ralph Waldo Emerson, including his reading of The Transcendentalist in 1842. Masons used the Masonic Temple for meetings until 1858, when the building was sold to the U.S. government for use as a courthouse. The government sold the building in 1885 and it was remodeled into commercial space for the R. H. Stearns department store.\n\nBeginning in 1859, Boston's Masons occupied a building at the corner of Tremont and Boylston Streets that was known as Winthrop House, and that was rededicated as \"Freemason's Hall\" in December 1859. That building was destroyed by fire in April 1864. A grand new Masonic Temple building, designed by Merrill G. Wheelock, was built in its place on the same site and dedicated in 1867. The second temple was also destroyed by fire in 1895 and replaced at the same location with a building designed by George F. Loring and Sanford Phipps, dedicated on December 27, 1899.\n\nAlso in Massachusetts:\n\nBuilding Image Dates Location City, State Description 4 Lynn Masonic Hall 1880 built\n\n1979 NRHP-listed Lynn, Massachusetts A Gothic-style building from 1880, NRHP-listed 5 Masonic Building (Newton, Massachusetts) 1896 built\n\n1986 CP 296 to 304 Walnut Street & 456 to 460 Newtonville Avenue Newton, Massachusetts Part of Newtonville Historic District, which is NRHP-listed 6 Masonic Temple (Quincy, Massachusetts) 1926 built\n\n1989 NRHP-listed 1170 Hancock St.\n\nQuincy, Massachusetts Classical Revival building from 1926 7 Masonic Block (Reading, Massachusetts) 1984 NRHP-listed 600-622 Main Street\n\nReading, Massachusetts Late 19th and 20th Century Revivals and other architecture 8 Masonic Temple (Springfield, Massachusetts) 1923 built\n\n1983 NRHP-listed 339-341 State Street\n\nSpringfield, Massachusetts Classical Revival 9 Masonic Temple (Worcester, Massachusetts) 1914 built\n\n1980 NRHP-listed Ionic Ave.\n\nWorcester, Massachusetts Classical Revival 10 Masonic Hospital Shrewsbury, Massachusetts Former Whittall estate, Juniper Hall, donated to the Masons in 1927, in what is now Prospect Park.
