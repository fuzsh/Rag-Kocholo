For more information about LAW visit the website.\n\nThe Labor Archives contains more than 300 separate collections of labor related materials from individuals and organizations documenting the local, national and international dimensions of the labor movement in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nUnion Collections\n\nMany unions have made the Labor Archives the official repository for their historical records -- minutes, office correspondence, membership files, publications and contracts.\n\nPersonal Papers\n\nLabor leaders, attorneys, arbitrators, and rank-and-file workers, and labor rights supporters have donated their personal papers.\n\nOrganizational Records\n\nRecords from organizations that supported organized labor, worker's rights, and civil rights and also records from labor critics and opponents. Also included are records of employers, some of which were the collective bargaining partners--and sometimes opponents--of unions.\n\nPrimary Reference Tools"
