        "text": "“About eighteen miles southwest from Chicago, are situated the famous ‘Athens Quarries,’ near Lemont. In 1846 the stone was discovered by some workman while they were excavating for the Illinois & Michigan Canal, but was not then considered of superior quality. It was, at first, used merely for foundation stone. In 1852, however, the Merchant’s & Mechanic’s Bank of Chicago was faced with the Athens stone, the first used for this purpose in the city. F. C. Sherman and William B. Ogden then used it in their buildings, next to the Sherman House, and on the corner of Lake and Clark streets….”\n\n“In 1850 the County and city commenced to agitate the project of erecting a court-house jointly by them. In December of that year, a resolution was adopted that the county pay three-quarters and the city pay one quarter of the expense to be incurred in the purchase of grounds and the erection of a court-house and jail. In June, 1851, that one structure was to be erected, a combined court-house and jail, in the center of the square, the latter to be in the basement of the building….On September 12, 1851, occurred the impressive ceremonies of laying the cornerstone of the structure….The splendid edifice was completed during the year 1853. The $111,000 expended upon it was borrowed upon the bonds of the county, having from seven to eighteen years to run, at ten per cent interest, payable semi-annually…The walls of the structure were faced with gray marble, taken from the Lockport quarries, at a cost of $32,000. The building was three stories in height, with two domes and a cupola, the main part being one hundred feet square. There were projections from the north and south fronts, fifty by sixty feet each; also on the east and west fronts thirty-two by sixty feet each. As these projections were carried up the entire height of the building, its dimensions were one hundred and thirty feet north and south, and one hundred and sixty-four east and west. The stone steps at the north and south ends also added to the imposing appearance of the court-house, which covered an area of 17,000….”\n\n“About eighteen miles southwest from Chicago, are situated the famous ‘Athens Quarries,’ near Lemont.

Compared with the previous church edifices it was an elegant building. The total cost was $40,000. It was built of Illinois marble....”\n\n“A new enterprise is being developed at Cokeville, Wyo., that bids fair to become an important factor in the industries of the State, says the Engineering and Mining Journal. It is the discovery and development of a large deposit of amber onyx. The company are now taking out slabs 4x2 feet, but expect to take out much larger slabs in the near future. The amber contains all kinds of figures imaginable. The company are taking out some very fine-veined white onyx, and also some cream onyx that is very handsome, showing half a dozen different colors and figures when polished. The company shipped a carload of finished onyx to be used in the Y.M.C.A. building in Chicago. The company expect to make this one of the greatest enterprises in Wyoming. The company has its general office at 225 Dearborn street, Chicago, and the officers are Clarence B. White, President; J. M. Van Osdel, Treasurer, and C. R. Van Osdel, Secretary.”\n\n“At 150, Old Main Old Main Rocks,” by R. Lance Factor, George Appleton Lawrence Distinguished Service Professor of Philosophy. (This link is no longer available, although you can view the site on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine.)\n\n<http://www.knox.edu/Alumni-and-Friends/Knox-Magazine-and-More/Knox-Magazine-Archives/Fall-2007/At-150-Old-Main-Rocks.html?ss=print>\n\nAccording to this article, “Old Main and Whiting had cherry red brick, lead white windows and doors, and blue limestone foundations, porches, and entrances. Charles Ulricson, the Swedish born immigrant architect and builder of both Old Main and Whiting Hall, made a special effort to explore Illinois quarries searching for the bluest limestone available. He sought and received extra money from the Trustees to purchase 13 carloads of Aurora Blue Cloud….” The original Blue Cloud limestone porches and stairs at Old main “flaked and crumbled almost as quickly as the stone turned from blue tint to buttery brown.” Due to the deterioration of the building, by 1927 it was decided that Old Main must be either renovated or destroyed. Janet Greig Post, Knox’s first woman trustee and a graduate of the Class of 1894, was responsible for raising the money to restore the building. “Restoration meant removing paint and replacing brick. New foundations, porches, and trim required five carloads of Indiana’s hardest Bedford limestone. Only the ashlar blocks at the entrances are the original Blue Cloud.”\n\nHistorical information and photographs about the Old Main building are available in the article above and R. Lance Factor’s book published in December 2009:\n\nChapel in The Sky: Knox College’s Old Main And Its Masonic Architect, by R Lance Factor, Northern Illinois University Press, December 15, 2009, ISBN-10: 0875804152, ISBN-13: 978-0875804156. (“Factor uncovers the architectural mysteries of Knox College’s beloved Old Main. Knox College’s Old Main – a national landmark and the only extant building that was a site of the Lincoln-Douglas debates – is a campus treasure with a secret. Built in 1857, Old Main was designed by Charles Ulricson, a Swedish-born immigrant who was trained by Freemasons. In ‘Chapel in the Sky,’ Knox faculty member Lance Factor decodes the symbols of this beloved building and explores how an ardently anti-Mason administration came to hire Ulricson.”)\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Harry Hill Ferguson, an Alton industrialist, “purchased limestone blocks from the local Grafton quarries and small portions from an old trading posts.” He imported stonemasons from Europe and Yugoslavia to do the stonework on his estate. Limestone was used in the construction of the buildings on Mr. Ferguson’s estate. Mr. Ferguson willed his farm to the State of Illinois, and in March 1963 the facility opened as the Pere Marquette Boys' Camp, and in 1973 was organized as a residential center. As of June 1981 it became known as the Illinois Youth Center - Pere Marquette.\n\n\"History - The City of Joliet was founded in 1831 by settlers who were attracted to the area by abundant fertile soil and soft coal and limestone deposits. The geography of the area was marked by bluffs to the west of the Des Plaines River Valley, at the time well-timbered, and by gently rolling prairie.\n\n\"An important industrial resource of earliest Joliet that has continued to the present is the vast beds of limestone that underlie the city and surrounding area. Buildings constructed during the 19th century of local limestone still stand in many areas of the city, with several excellent examples contained in the proposed district (#'s 3, 10, 30, 37, 44). Chicago's historic Water Tower was constructed of Joliet limestone as was the Old State Capitol in Springfield.\"\n\nThe Jacob A. Henry mansion is listed on the National Register. Construction of the mansion began in 1873 and was completed in 1876. Limestone from Mr. Henry's Joliet quarry was used for the foundation and basement floor. Red Illinois sandstone and red brick, fired in Ohio, were used in the next two floors. Single slabs of limestone were used for the porches, and the largest limestone slab every quarried in Joliet was used under the entrance gates. According to this web site, the stone measures 22 feet by 9 feet by 20 inches.\n\nThe National Park Service web site presents the memorial stones in placed in the interior of the Washington Monument. The Illinois Memorial Stone entries can be viewed on the National Park Service’s web site in either the “Album” or the “Slide Show.”\n\nThe Illinois Memorial Stone in the Washington Monument can be viewed along with the details in the WAMO Stones Section 2. The Masons, Grand Lodge of Illinois, Memorial Stone can be viewed along with the details in the WAMO Stones Section 3. The S. of T., (Sons of Temperance) Grand Division of Illinois Memorial Stone can be viewed along with the details in the WAMO Stones Section 4.\n\nThe Washington Monument web site has recently been redesigned. Below is an description that was available on the National Park Service web site in January 2008 that describes the Memorial Stones in the Washington Monument.\n\n“A unique feature of the Washington Monument is the 193 memorial stones that adorn the interior of the monument. Starting in July 1848 the Washington National Monument Society invited states, cities and patriotic societies to contribute Memorial Stones. The Society listed some requirements to be followed. They asked that the stone be durable, a product of the state’s soil, and meet the following dimensions; four feet long, two feet high and 18 inches thick. These stones pay tribute to the character and achievements of George Washington. These traits are not only admired by Americans but by people the world over as seen by the number of stones donated by foreign countries. Below is a list of stones donated by state. In the near future all the stones will be online.\n\n“While viewing the stones please keep in mind that the Washington Monument has undergone extensive renovation over the last three years. A key component of the project has been the restoration of the memorial stones. Over the years the stones have been damaged by moisture and vandalism. The pictures that follow show the condition of the stones before their restoration. In the upcoming months new images will be added highlighting the restored stones.”\n\nThe following information relating to the Illinois Memorial Stone can be viewed along with the details in the WAMO Stones Section 2.\n\nName: Illinois\n\nLevel: 50-ft.\n\nDonor: State of Illinois\n\nDates: 1850s/1850s\n\nOriginal material: limestone\n\nDimensions: 2' x 4'\n\nSculptor/Carver: not known\n\nOriginal inscription: Illinois.
