        "text": "AURORA, IL â€” Just over a month after a late-night fire ripped through the historic Aurora Masonic Temple, crews are still picking up the pieces and residents are looking for answers. In a recent media briefing, Ken Schroth, director of public works, recently gave an update on the demolition of the fire, the cause of which is still unclear, according to Chicago Tribune.\n\nThe fire, which was first spotted by a bystander around 10 p.m. Oct. 7, brought firefighters out to battle the blaze, which smolders for hours after the flames were extinguished. When officials opted to demolish the building in early October, they acknowledged that demolition, though necessary for public safety, may make it more difficult to assess the cause of the fire.\n\nAurora Fire Marshal Javan Cross told Chicago Tribune the Aurora Fire Department collected the evidence it needed before the demolition, but acknowledged the difficulty of attributing a cause to the fire under such circumstances. \"It is not an ideal investigative environment,\" Cross told Chicago Tribune.\n\nAs demolition wraps up on the Aurora Masonic Temple, Benton Avenue has been reopened near the scene. Crews are still working to crush materials and fill the basement of the temple. The work will require Lincoln to remain closed near the historic temple site for a few more weeks as crews continue to haul out debris and other materials, Schroth said in Tuesday's media briefing.\n\nRelated: Demolition Planned After Fire Destroys Masonic Temple In Aurora"
