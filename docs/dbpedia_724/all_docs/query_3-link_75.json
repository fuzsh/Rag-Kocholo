        "text": "Euclid Lodge No. 65, of Ancient Free & Accepted Masons, will be opening its doors in celebration of 170 years of Freemasonry in Naperville.\n\nJoin them for refreshments, and see what Freemasonry (and the secrets of Freemasonry) is all about.\n\nIf you have ever wondered what goes on in the second floor above the Naperville Running Club, here is your chance!\n\nThe open house will be held from 1 to 5 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 12, at the Naperville Masonic Temple, 34 W. Jefferson Ave. in Naperville.\n\nThe open house will feature tours of the newly renovated lodge along with a wealth of information detailing the very close connection of the lodge with the history of Naperville.\n\nJoseph Naper, founder of Naperville, was a charter member of the lodge when it was chartered by the Grand Lodge of Illinois, in 1849.\n\nIn addition, the Masonic mural, \"Faith, Hope And Charity\", a Naperville Century Walk art piece painted by Naperville artist Marianne Lisson Kuhn, will be rededicated at its new location on the south side of the Gap Store on Main Street.\n\nFreemasonry is a fraternity; comprised of men from every race, religion, opinion, and background who are brought together as brothers to promote friendship, morality, and brotherly love among its members.\n\nWith over 6 million members worldwide, Freemasons belong to the largest and oldest fraternal organization in the world. Freemasonry proposes to \"make good men better\" by teaching - with metaphors from geometry and architecture - about building values based on great universal truths.\n\nThe celebration is open to the public."
