Warshauer 704 Maple St. SW Sleepy Eye, MN 56085 www.grandevenues.com C: (312) 550-7868 www.paulwarshauer.net E-mail: paulwarshauer@gmail.com CURRICULUM VITAE, SELECTED PROJECTS, EMPLOYMENT, AND PRODUCTION CREDITS Historic Real Estate Developer & Theatre Producer/Director Paul Warshauer is a historic real estate developer, consultant, theatrical producer/director, writer, and performer. He enjoys working in the worlds of business development, historic real estate, and entertainment. Although at times it is challenging to juggle “right brain and left-brain” activities, he has accomplished most of his major goals. (See www.grandevenues.com) He writes, directs and hosts original murder mysteries around the country. (See www.murders4fun.com) Some former offices of his real estate development companies were located in historic properties. He has led projects in Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, Illinois, California, Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, Kansas, Indiana, Oregon, Texas, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and in England, Italy, and Jamaica. Mr. Warshauer specializes in consulting, theatre, business and real estate development, business plan writing, grants, hiring, contract negotiation, acquisition, mergers, and mediation. Paul W. Warshauer recently served as the Developer for the former New Ulm Middle / High School renovation project involving acquisition and subdivision of the one city block, now called the Emerson Union Apartments and the State Street Theatre. Some of Mr. Warshauer’s projects include: Redwood Falls Theatre Group, LLC Masonic Temple Building, Grand Island, NE Ellendale Hotel, Ellendale, ND Cultural Block Development, Ellendale, SD Wheaton Grand Theatre Project, Wheaton, IL Westmont Theatre Project, Haddon, NJ Oakes Hotel Development Project, Oakes, ND Liberty/Paramount Theatre Project, Youngstown, OH Chicago Athletic Association Restoration, Chicago, IL Quarters One Residence, Rock Island, IL Siskiyou County Perform.

The property sits on a square block of valuable downtown property. The City is negotiating with R-P to “design, construct and operate” the community center in the former gymnasium and related spaces. It is a multi-tiered development with many moving parts. The main issue now is listing the property on the National Register of Historic Places. That designation will allow the developers to utilize Federal and state historic tax credits.

Local librarian, Linda Roiger, brought the project to the attention of Warshauer. Warshauer toured the historic house and immediately made an offer. After some negotiations, Warshauer brought in partner Mark Burmeister, who was born and raised in Springfield but now lives in Wykoff, Minnesota. The two began an investment campaign to raise $100,000. The house is on the National Register of Historic Places and the approximate budget for renovation & restoration is $350,000. The plan is to create a bed & breakfast for the public (a for-profit tenant) and conference center for the local Springfield Area Historical Society, a not-for-profit). An unusual lease will allow funds to flow from a not-for-profit to the for-profit LLC.\n\n4. 4 2023-Present Masonic Temple Building Enfield, North Carolina Mr. Warshauer joined Andrew and Myra Wirtz in their development project to restore and operate the three story, historic Masonic Temple in downtown, Enfield, North Carolina. The existing company that owned the property was named “Glass Bead, LLC,” based on the couple’s love of New Orleans and its culture. Mr. Warshauer advised Andrew & Myra as a consultant, (for a fee) then joined the LLC as a 15% equity member. He continues to advise the investment group and the project as Chairman of the Board. His intimate knowledge into developing historic properties, business planning and organization made him a valued member of the company. Negotiations are underway with historic architects, tax credit providers, local government officials and potential tenants. The Business Plan Outline calls for the establishment of three tenants: The Temple Restaurant and Bar, A full service restaurant and bar located on the second floor of the historic property. The name is taken for the original name: Masonic Temple. The company seeks and owner operator of said restaurant and bar. The Masonic Auditorium, a performing arts space that exhibits movies, books concerts and other events. The space was originally a movie theatre for the public and has a large stage suited for all manner of public performances. This venture is operated by a not-for-profit allowing for the utilization of grants for performances and artistic endeavors. The concessions are operated by the tenant on the second floor and include a full bar. The Eastern Star Theatre, on the third floor in the magnificent former Lodge Room of the Masonic Orders. This space is reserved for banquets, civic meetings, concerts and theatre pieces suited for a more formal venue. The catering is provided by the tenant on the second floor. The long range plans include the addition of a boutique hotel on the property behind the Temple Building . The current front entrance An artistic rendering of the property\n\n5. 5 2022-Present FOHS LLC The Former Owatonna High School Mr. Warshauer created FOHS LLC (Former Owatonna High School, a Minnesota Liability Company) with the sole purpose of developing a site plan and a development proposal for the 20+ acre site. His group signed an exclusive Development Agreement with the school district on April 25, 2022. The Parties agree to provide the Developer 180 days to create a plan and proposal pursuant to an Exclusive Agreement. He has three investors including VP Matt Durand. Independent School District 761 owns the Owatonna High School located at 333 East School Street, Owatonna, Minnesota (PIN 17-015-4122, 17-015-4109, 17-015-4108). The High School site consists of several connected structures including the high school, a track and field, tennis courts and the Ag building. The District is replacing the High School with a new school at a different location and no longer needs all the facilities at the Site but intends to retain some of the facilities and grounds for continued District use. Mr. Warshauer is soliciting interest from potential partners, tenants, co-developers. The intent is to subdivide the property and to sell parcels and lease others. The District will own at least two of the parcels at this time. A Task Force created by the District issued a report that outlines many options for the property: https://engageowatonna.com/the-high-school Potential uses include, but are not limited to, town homes, apartments, a community center, social services, a culinary school, a performing arts center. Mr. Warshauer poses in front of the main entrance An aerial view of the 20+ acre parcel (parts of the field to the right are not included)\n\n6. 6 2021- Present The Historic Kasson School Project The $10 million development project is known as “The Water Tower Place,” and involves the acquisition of the 1918 historic school, development of an investment strategy, raising of capital, and finalizing the Business Plan for approximately 30 high end apartments for seniors in the city of Kasson, 15 miles west of Rochester, Minnesota. The school was already listed on the National Register of historic places but the Part 2 of the historic tax credit portion is being prepared at this time. The sale of these tax credits makes about $4 million in funds available for the development with no debt and no equity. Mr. Warshauer has three investors including Diane O’Brien, Oleg Smal, and Amir Sergyeyev. Upper left: An aerial of the entire property. Upper right: The main entrance of the property that has been maintained like this for many years by volunteers and the current not for profit owners, (KARE, NFP).

Below: The historic Water Tower, adjacent to the school property.\n\n7. 7 2012-2017 Emerson Union / State Street Apartments, LLC This $13+ million project involved a three part plan for the acquisition, division, and development of the property known as the ISD 88 Administration Center, also known as the former Middle School located at State and Center Streets in New Ulm, Minnesota. The school was constructed in 1915 with additions in 1938 and 1955. In January 2015, the property was approved for the Part I of the Federal Historic Tax Credit process and was listed on the National Register for Historic Places in July 2015. Groundbreaking for the apartments commenced in 2019. The application indicated that many of the “school elements would be included in the development of the apartments. The property was owned by the Minnesota Independent School District #88 and a Purchase Agreement was signed between the School District and Cenate LLC, a Minnesota limited Liability Company formed in February, 2014 by Mr. Warshauer and its Board of Governors, (Directors). The terms included a payment to the school district of $25,000 at closing and a lease for use of parts of the property for administrative use for two years and for theatre and gymnasium use for up to ten years. Three complex leases were executed at closing between the parties. Closing occurred on July 2, 2014. Mr. Warshauer created the legal entity (Cenate LLC) and renamed NUACT as “State Street Theater Company.” Cenate sought investors for the acquisition, development, restoration, and renovation of the school property as apartments and commercial space and found CentraSota and the Welch companies to purchase the apartment section for $200,000 thus returning 183% to the investors. The sale of the “housing section” was completed in March, 2015. Agreements between the parties, “Development Agreements” and Covenants” were signed between the parties that addressed common walls, joint area maintenance, specific repairs, and parking. A long term lease was negotiated for theatre spaces not owned by the State Street Theater. The theatre property was donated by Cenate to the State Street Theater Co. in July 2015. Appraised value is $150,000. The charitable contribution was claimed by the investors. An apartment in the Emerson Union Apartment building managed, at this time, by Lloyd Management. Chalkboards, transoms, wood bookcases and doors were retained in many of the apartments lending the “former school feel” to the project. In addition, wide hallways and empty lockers were part of the plan. Trophy cases are permanent part of the project and contain many historic school artifacts and memorabilia.\n\n8. 8 The State Street Theatre Co. will seek donations and grants for the restoration, renovation and operation of the community auditorium, adaptive reuse for the former locker rooms, (as set, prop and costume shops) and the creation of a Black Box Theatre from what was the “Little Gym.” The budget is approximately $3,000,000. At one time Mr. Warshauer maintained the titles of State Street Apartments Property Manager, Cenate Vice President of Project Development, and State Street Theater Co. Executive & Artistic Director. He was also an equity partner in the real estate venture. Cenate dissolved in February 2016.

The sale of the school property was completed on July 2, 2014. Here are the principals for the sale of the entire city block located at the corner of State and Center Street. The property was referred to as the District Administrative Center (DAC). From left: Kevin Thoreson, housing consulting, Paul Warshauer (Cenate VP, Project Manager), Reed Glawe (President, Cenate) and Phillip Rondeau, (Principal, CentraSota, LLC).\n\n9. 9 The sale of the residential portion of the property to CentraSota LLC commenced in the fall of 2014. A purchase agreement was signed on October 17, 2014 and closing occurred between CentraSota and Cenate in March 2014. Cenate directed Mr. Warshauer to immediately apply for a listing on the National Register of Historic Places making the property eligible for Federal and State Historic Tax Credits. Mr. Warshauer enlisted Dan Hoisington, of Hoisington Preservation Consultants to write the application. Considerations were made to include the Auditorium as a separate parcel from the future apartment section. The subdivision was completed and approved by the City and stamped in March, 2014.\n\n10. 10 State Street Theater Co. formerly New Ulm Actors Community Theatre, NUACT November 2011-August 2017 Mr. Warshauer was hired for a six month period commencing November 1, 2011 as the NUACT consultant and interim Executive Director. When his contract expired, the parties negotiated a one- year extension followed by a 1.5 year extension. On July 2, 2014, Mr. Warshauer was hired on a two year contract with the title, “Executive and Artistic Director.” He taught workshops for kids and adults in acting, directing and improvisation. He produced and directed Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Fiddler on the Roof, South Pacific, The Front Page, Arsenic & Old Lace, & Harvey. He supervised the lease of the theatre space with Cenate LLC, the owner of the property. He produced a monthly cable show, “Something Artsy” and a monthly play reading society at the historic Lind House. He was also the host of the “Tickets Please” movie Festival. Clearly, Mr. Warshauer clearly wore many hats with the State Street Theatre.

Here he is at a grant awards luncheon for the New Ulm Area Foundation\n\n11. 11 2015-2020 Redwood Theatre Group, LLC The Redwood Theatre was constructed in 1931 and operated as a family movie theatre until the 1980s. In 2015, the owners, Shon and Tina Giernet, sold the property to an LLC created by Paul Warshauer, for Craig and Cynthia LeBrie. The five formed the LLC and inspired a group of citizens to create the Friends of the Redwood Theatre, NFP (a 501c3 organization). The two organizations are restoring the theatre to operate as a 200 seat digital cinema and small performing arts venue. Renovation costs approach $1.1 million. The old Proscenium arch and “speaker area.” The five owners of the Redwood Theatre in 2015 The Redwood Theatre in 1948\n\n12. 12 2006-2011 Masonic Temple Building, Grand Island, Nebraska The Retzler Development Group, LLC (a Nebraska limited liability company) purchased the historic seven story building for $70,000 from the Masonic Templecraft Association of Grand Island. A successful negotiation period with Verizon Wireless for cell towers atop the building provided a substantial advance payment that was used to cover the down payment and closing costs. Seven tenants occupied the building thus making it “cash flow positive.” The development plan included the renovation and restoration of artists loft & apartments on the 2nd floor, shared business suites on the 3rd floor, two high ceiling condominiums on the 4th floor, a 3,800 sq. foot condominium on the 5th floor and a Dinner Theatre/Bar on the 6-7th floors. Parking issues and fire exits ultimately stalled the project. Mr. Warshauer maintained his office and residence on the 5th floor in the 3,800 sq foot Knight’s Templar Floor. The Retzler Group prepared a neighborhood development plan calling for skywalks connecting a proposed parking structure with the Bartenbach and Masonic Temple Buildings. The building was sold to Charles Anson in 2011. (Photo by Scott Kingsley)\n\n13. 13 2004-2006 The Wheaton Grand Theatre (Grande Venues, Inc.) Grande Venues, Inc. (an Illinois corporation) was created by Mike Novelli and Paul Warshauer from a need by “theatres in renovation mode.” GVI created programming and restoration options for “Grand Venues,” meaning theatres, hotels, and other historic properties. With the advertising, marketing, and business skills of Michael Novelli, and the years of experience of theatre production and operations of Paul Warshauer, the Wheaton Grand Theatre was the first of several consulting contracts negotiated. Plans were made to make the Wheaton facility a three theatre venue. Paid consulting work was also performed by Grande Venues for the Zoe Theatre in Pittsfield, IL, the Lyric Theatre in Ellendale, North Dakota, the Garden Theatre in Charleston, South Carolina, the Parkway Theatre in Baltimore and the Enean Theatre in Pittsburg, California to name a few. Mike and Paul ran the Wheaton Grand theatre on a day to day basis for months before the Wheaton Theatre board decided on retaining another consultant who failed. By 2015 the theatre STILL had not opened to the public making Grande Venues the last successful full time operators of the Wheaton Grand Theatre. The well rounded Program Calendar of events created by Paul Warshauer and Mike Novelli was the key to success for the Wheaton Grand. (Music, movies, children and family programming, speakers, and rentals) It is also the secret of success for ANY performing arts center.\n\n14. 14 2006, CAA (Chicago Athletic Association) Chicago\n\n15. 15 2004 Chairman, Golden Griffin Ventures, Ltd. and Alliance Resorts, Ltd.

He even found time to go to Europe spending his profits, and some rent money from 216 South Blvd. with lifelong friend, Dr. Paul Adler. 1971: University Heights Public Library, Cleveland Heights, Ohio This was Paul’s first real job. He truly enjoys spending time inside libraries so as a high school junior, he went in to a local library and asked for a job. The head librarian liked him and volunteered that, “there are no jobs today, (she winked) but if you volunteer, there might be a job next week.” He volunteered for two weeks then got the job. Paul shelved books, checked out materials, registered patrons for new library cards and eventually helped to coordinate the annual book sale. All this for $1.16 per hour to start; He does not recall his final hourly wage but Paul thought, “he had died and gone to heaven!” He continues to maintain his own personal library. Warshauer’s first REAL job at the UHPL\n\n23. 23 EDUCATION 1983-1986: California State University, Northridge, California Mr. Warshauer earned a Bachelor of the Arts in English/ Theatre Obtained secondary teaching credential (junior and senior high school) in California.

At one event the cast pretended to be “guests” at the wedding. Paul Warshauer played the kindly old judge and assisted in the investigation after the “Wedding Cake and these antique serving tools were stolen! The audience loved it and acted as detectives questioning the wedding party who were all in on joke.\n\n37. 37 “Who Stole the Aberdeen Emerald?” Jewel Heists “It’s a Wonderful Life!” Radio Plays Mr. Warshauer produces, adapts, writes, and directs “live radio plays.” The audience participates in what appears to be a live radio broadcast of familiar stories. Plays include, “It’s a Wonderful Life,” “Miracle on 34th Street,” “Treasure Island,” “A Seussified Christmas Carol,” “A Christmas Carol,” David Mamet’s “Water Engine,” and many others. Some clients have done several murder mysteries over the years and needed something new. Jewel Heists have been popular. Other groups do not want to do “murders” like children’s groups, some high schools, women’s shelters. In Aberdeen North Dakota, there is a Wizard of Oz park so Paul Warshauer wrote an original murder involving a massive mythical emerald left by Oz author, F.

Architects Lowenstein + Durante and general contractor, Marous Brothers from Willoughby, Ohio have been retained to lead the $4.8 million project. The design calls for the restoration of the Grand Proscenium Theatre, for smaller theatre and music events, the creation (adaptive reuse) of two digital cinemas in the balcony, a white tablecloth restaurant, and theatre bar and retail in the basement. Funding is ongoing and Youngstown State University will now play a pivotal role in the development.

The theatre itself has been unoccupied since 1978. The massive theatre constructed in 1925 held over 4,000 people and showed movies and vaudeville shows. The Uptown was designed by Rapp & Rapp for Balaban and Katz. It opened with a large staff and could “fill, spill and refill” multiple audiences every day utilizing clever lobbies and three street exits. Legal battles continue but the City of Chicago stabilized the exterior. Volunteers continue to maintain the deteriorating interior. Warshauer served as the last Chairman of the Uptown Theatre and Centre of the Arts. The group was heavily financed by Albert Goodman but could not execute a final purchase agreement for the property. In 2008 a new group of investors emerged ready to take on the project. Time will tell…The theatre is not going anywhere. On the right is a photo taken on the 80th birthday of the theatre in 2005. You can see Paul Warshauer under the marquee…barely…\n\n41. 41 The World Trade Centre, New York, NY December 31, 1999. 2:00 to 4:00 pm Paul Warshauer visited a real estate client regarding tax matters at the World Trade Center on December 31, 1999 and decided that a trip to the top for New Year’s Eve would be a treat. After his meeting the host took him upstairs. When Warshauer heard how much it might cost to attend, ($135.00 at the door and drinks were extra) he had a few beers, sat by the window and took a few photos. Who knows if the staff working up there that day survived on September 11, 2001? As it was a bar, no one is sure how many people upstairs were actually at work. The restaurant was called “Windows on the World.” Later that night I went with a comedian and his fiancé to New Jersey to celebrate New Year’s Eve at a First Night alcohol free party. Scott Blakeman was the comedian for the alcohol free First Night “stroll around talent and activities.” We spent the actual New Year’s Eve on a football field watching third rate fireworks. (Photos by Paul Warshauer) The Ross Ragland Theatre, Klamath Falls, Oregon The Esquire Theatre (1947) was saved from the wrecking ball by Frank Drew, John Tritch and other civic leaders. Warshauer advised Chairman Frank Drew and the first board of directors on the mechanics of theatre operations, producing shows, raising money and creating long lasting and sustainable programs. Paul Warshauer created the long lasting series of programs and fundraising opportunities for this now regionally famous performing arts facility. Warshauer served on many committees including the programming committee. He wrote the grants that created a county wide after school theatre program and also created the Ragland Summer Theatre Camp program using county parks, the theatre, and the Oregon Institute of Technology, (a university campus). Warshauer also was a resident producer producing and directing some of the largest and most profitable shows of the theatre’s history including, South Pacific, Guys and Dolls, Man of La Mancha, Annie Get Your Gun, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, Treasure Island, Follies” and others. Warshauer starred on stage at the Ragland as Nicely-Nicely Johnson in Guys and Dolls and as Alfred P. Doolittle in My Fair Lady.\n\n42. 42 Ellendale Hotel, Lyric Theatre, and the Ellendale Opera House, Ellendale, North Dakota In December of 2007 the Retzler Group created a new entity, Historic Ellendale Land Development Company, LLC with Peggy Gilbert and local businessman, Jeff Langley. The group purchased the Nodak Hotel (formerly the Dickey Hotel and Ellendale Hotel). HELD has begun work to restore it as a boutique hotel with 20 rooms, a Café and artist workshop and gallery. In May, 2006 and in June of 2007 the Economic Development Director of Ellendale (Patricia Bowen) retained Grande Venues/ Retzler Group to perform consulting services for the Lyric Theatre, Nodak Hotel and the Ellendale Opera House downtown. Paul Warshauer spent several days talking with local business people, educators, the Mayor, and members of the public. He conducted two informal meetings and developed an “Executive Plan” to open the Lyric Theatre. The city and JDA is still raising money and awareness for the projects.

Located on Chicago’s Northwest side, Henslowe Group’s Chairman, Paul Warshauer poses under the restored marquee. Warshauer applied for, and received, a façade rebate for the “chase mechanisms for the neon and bulb electrification.” Warshauer led a group of investors (R. Pales, and J. Deans) to sign a lease with option to purchase agreement with the owners of the multi-use building. The oddly shaped building has 32 apartments, 8 storefronts and a 1,200 seat theatre that had been divided into two theatres but was closed at the time of the contract. Warshauer wrote a complete business plan, negotiated with the Portage Park Neighborhood Association, union projectionists, potential tenants and the City of Chicago. The issuance of a Public Place of Amusement (PPA) license was compromised by a tragic fire in a south side nightclub. That license in the form of an “Occupancy Certificate” arrived too late. Henslowe “sold” their lease to a Hispanic church group. New tenants operated the space as a single screen movie theatre showing vintage films and producing other community events.

Paul and Tom conducted meetings, wrote grants, attended meetings of the Village Board, created a Nebraska not-for-profit group, filed articles of organization, contacted historic preservation organizations and worked out a five year pro forma. The project ended when the Village board voted to demolish the Tower in 2010. The not-for-profit was dissolved in June, 2011.

The Eldridge Castle Project (2016) Warshauer was hired as consultant by realtor Steven Schrudder of Windemere to create a feasibility study for the historic castle in Bellingham, Washington. Warshauer assembled a team of architects, builders, engineers and property managers. Two large high voltage towers were problematic and caused the project to stall. In 2004, Grande Venues was selected as the prime developer for this $16,000,000 urban renewal project in the city’s south side involves the use of historic tax credits, Tax Incremental Financing (TIF) and government funding. The 2,000 seat magnificently restored atmospheric theatre will be surrounded by a restaurant, parking structure with commercial and residential components, and a school for the arts. The former owners are the Gardners who lavished their own money to bring this theatre into its current splendor. The current owners are Ron and Regina Evans who are working hard to re- open this movie palace.\n\n48. 48 The Westmont Theatre Project, Camden County, New Jersey The Retzler Group was asked to assist in the creation of a not-for-profit organization in Camden County New Jersey. He created a board with local architects, attorneys, and theatre aficionados. The City is currently wending its way through a lawsuit with a former developer. The graphic defined how the property might look if all parties sat down at the table and settled the lawsuit and moved forward with development of the theatre and a themed restaurant.\n\n49. 49 The Zoe Theatre Arts Assessment® The City of Pittsfield and an economic development partnership retained Grande Venues, Inc. to perform a complicated arts assessment to determine if the public would come to movies in this quaint town. The Zoe Theatre was a 1950s era “on the square” theatre. Mike Novelli and Paul Warshauer traveled to Pittsfield, IL to conduct a series of town hall style meetings. Retzler delivered a100 page report with specific recommendations and programming elements. To date despite our best efforts, the theatre remains dark but a committee has been working on revitalizing the theatre recently.\n\n50. 50 ZOE THEATRE AND PROPOSED PERFORMING ARTS ANNEX FINAL ARTS ASSESSMENT REPORT Prepared for The City of Pittsfield, Illinois Greater Pike Industrial Development Corporation Grande Venues, Inc. 1117 Wheaton Oaks Court Wheaton, Illinois 60187 (630) 480-3345 ~ Fax: (630) 480-3346 www.grandevenues.com Report prepared by: Michael Novelli Paul Warshauer Fran Lins & Jonathan Tharnstrom\n\n51. 51 Zoe Theatre Arts Assessment Table of Contents Section I: Overview……………………………………………. 1-5 a.

Paul Warshauer traveled to Charleston, did a short survey and a needs assessment. Clearly there was a need for a small theatre, music, film venue in historic Charleston and the historic Garden Theatre was in need of an operator. Months earlier commercial interest were et to buy the property and perform drastic renovations that would have removed all semblance of the former historic theatre. Erected in 1918, the theater ran successfully until the 1970’s, when it closed. Seven years later, in 1977, the theater was restored. During the 1980’s, the theater was used for performances during Charleston’s famous Spoleto Festival and eventually transformed into a performing arts space. The City of Charleston did not renew its lease of the theater in 2003, and despite efforts of the Friends of the Garden Theater, the theater was converted into retail space. We would like to think that our historic perspective led the modern developer to retain historic elements of the theatre. The theatre in its heyday.

Superintendent Terry Kenealy said the purchase price is $300,000 but new Superintendent Mike Lucas slashed that price to $89,000 in the hopes that the Developer would take the property off their hands. The middle school has been marketed by United Country Real Estate since the new middle school facility was constructed. The current purchase agreement is an amendment of an earlier agreement. The original had a closing date of mid-January, 2009; however, the Duke wrestlers use the middle school gym for practice. That closing date would have come before the wrestling season was completed. The new purchase agreement pushes the closing date to December 2009, to eliminate that problem and some zoning issues. Superintendent Kenealy said that if a solution comes for the wrestling practice area, the closing date could be much earlier than March. There’s also a possibility that an agreement may be reached in which the closing takes place earlier and the wrestlers are allowed to continue their practices there per the new owner’s permission. The purchase includes the middle school, gym, surrounding sheds and most of the contents, with the exception of a few items the district has in storage. The sales contract does not include the property north of the middle school, across the street, which has been proposed for a new softball complex. Paul Warshauer, CEO for York Centre and his Grande Venues Group, says he’s excited about the future of that particular property. (www.grandevenues.com) “Everything is still in the planning stages,” Warshauer said. “We’d like to see some apartments, and we would like to maintain the historical theater — for it to become a multi-use arts facility. We still have to talk to the city and the county, and we will have several meetings with members of the public as to what they would like to see there. It’s rare for a developer to ask for public input — but we like to do things in open forum. This school belongs to the community — what a developer decides to do with it is the Purchase Agreement Approved for Old Middle School Pending sale comes with $300,000 price tag slashed to $89,000\n\n55. 55 American way. But so many people went through that school. To look at how to preserve the historical building and the developer make a buck — that’s the making of a happy marriage.” York Middle School in its last year of operation as a school in 2007 The conceptual drawing showing a working restaurant and catering kitchen, a theatre, art school music school and approximately 28 apartments.\n\n56. 56 Lafayette Movie Theatre Programming Contract A group of business men purchased the Lafayette Theatre in Indiana for the purpose of saving their downtown. They retained Retzler Development Group, LLC to create a season of classic films. Mr. Warshauer stayed in Lafayette, visited with the principals and theatre manager, toured local businesses and tendered a formal report. The group did well and the Lafayette Theatre continues today on its journey to find an identity.\n\n57. 57\n\n58. 58 South Boulevard Housing Development Mr. Warshauer’s first foray into the world of real estate began in 1974 when he purchased two single family homes on South Boulevard (216 & 220) in Evanston, Illinois from Elsa Erickson on a “land contract.” The sales price was $91,000 for BOTH houses. He did not have the down payment. To earn the money he scalped 1,000 tickets to a George Harrison concert, netting about $15,000 in cash. However, he was arrested at the Chicago Stadium for “scalping.” The case was dismissed and his record was expunged! None the less, Mrs. Erickson was impressed and accepted $13,000 down which was less than the 20% she expected. He moved into 220 South with two room-mates. He rented 216 out for $700.00 month to 3 wealthy Northwestern graduate students. His payment to Mrs. Erickson was $700.00 per month so the project was cash flow positive from Day One! He hosted lavish TENT PARTIES and invited hundreds of friends. Paul finally moved to California and found investors for the project. He demolished 220 South, vacated a small alley, and our investment group built several condominium units on the property. 216 South Blvd. 220 South Blvd. Site of Tent Party\n\n59. 59 Catskills Entertainment District (Fleischmann’s Theatre) This photo was taken in August 2005 at the only meeting regarding the formation a Catskills Entertainment District in upstate New York.

The Catskills Entertainment District (CED) was to be a formal performing arts cooperative set up by local government, not for profit organizations, business entities, economic development agencies, and arts organizations in this specific region using theatres and performing arts spaces that were under- utilized or that have not been constructed or considered at this time.\n\n60. 60 Sgt. Gomez Home (Wheaton Illinois) A Community Effort Todd Plagman (left) and Paul Warshauer (right) stand in front of the nearly completed home for the Gomez Family. The fundraising effort began when a Wheaton native returned disabled from the Iraqi war. Joel Gomez had limited resources and his family had been financially devastated by the continuing care he required. Mr. Plagman volunteered to serve as the chairman of a massive community wide fun raising campaign. The effort collected money for the family to build a house and provide care for Mr. Gomez and housing for his family. A large kick off, well publicized and attended by Lt. Governor Pat Quinn, then US Congressman Henry Hyde, and many other dignitaries was held at the Wheaton Grand Theatre, then managed by Grande Venues owned by Paul Warshauer and Mike Novelli.

This was the photo used by the New York Times. Warshauer served on the organizing committee that drew 18,000 people downtown to protest “Federal irrigation interference.” US Senators, Congressmen and local politicians joined in a symbolic protest by scooping buckets of water from the Klamath River and passing them down Main Street to an irrigation ditch near Klamath Union High School.\n\n63. 63 Organizing 18,000 people for a peaceful protest is not easy work.

(The P³ Project) The P3 project would connect developers, state agencies, preservation groups, tax credit providers, an attorney, a CPA, and equity sources (banks and private investors). The goal would be to preserve two projects per year to start. The Wishek Historic City Hall project (in Wishek, ND) would be the first this year, (2010). The Ellendale Hotel & Nodak Café (in Ellendale, ND) would be the second. The Old City Hall was finally demolished by the City Council in 2011. The key components are: 1. Not-for-profit groups (NFP) mean well but they rarely have enough capital or business experience to make historic properties economically viable. 2. NFPs cannot obtain Federal Historic Tax Credits available to the private Developers (or any for profit entities such as an LLC). 3. Developers can provide the pro forma, feasibility, and business plans necessary to make historic properties “interesting” to investors and banks. 4. NFPs can provide many hours of volunteer labor and experience. 5. Developers cannot obtain certain funds that NFPs can obtain, (grants, tax deductible gifts, in kind donations, pro bono services, and the elusive naming rights*). 6. The Developer would purchase these properties as an LLC then immediately negotiate a long term lease. The owners of the LLC could expect a small return on investment. How the investors’ tax advantages can be valued in North Dakota is one of the elements we need to explore. Banks will naturally look at the property on the basis of its value and the strength of the “tenant.” If the not-for-profit “tenant” is well organized and has a board with broad community appeal and experience, most banks will loan.\n\n65. 65 The Dayton Arcade Project The City of Dayton and the Friends of the Dayton Arcade, a not-for-profit advocacy group, retained Mr. Warshauer as a consultant to explore opportunities to develop the amazing Dayton Arcade Building in downtown Dayton, Ohio. He spent several days touring the property, meeting architects and city officials and made a determination that the project could move forward if completed in segments. Parking was a massive problem and Mr. Warshauer began the process of trying to line up partners. The former owner defaulted on a tax lien and a group from Germany and Wisconsin purchased the property. The new owners have not paid taxes since the purchase. Mr. Warshauer remains involved as a consultant and potential property manager.

Warshauer created a company called, Creative Entertainment Management Company and served as an agent (and scalper) for several productions and events. In an attempt to publicize his company, Warshauer agreed to a ten minute rally with the tennis great. Warshauer brought a TV and film crew, (including film-maker Brian England, and lifelong friend, Rick Kotrba) and others in his entourage. Although the two had never met, Riggs played this event up as we were old friends posing for photos and pretending we had played in New York months ago… For the record, Warshauer scored one point against Riggs who handily defeated Warshauer in three games straight. It was fun to see Mr. Warshauer scramble all over the court.\n\n67. 67\n\n68.

The backstage antics, romances, fights, and creative processes are captured as the “Murder Mystery Bus” travels from city to city with the Troupe, the Host/Author and staff. Two celebrities area on the day of the show to “star” and the proceeds of the live theatrical show go to local charities No TV show has ever captured LIVE theatre antics like this. Each episode can be filmed in only two days. The Sizzle will be taped from OCTOBER 15- 16, 2015 at the Oster Regent Theatre in Cedar Falls, Iowa. Two well known actors (or local celebrities) from each city will join the Troupe of eight actors as they audition three local hopefuls to perform in a show in front of a live audience making the cast of 13 lucky performers! As part of the reality show concept, the cast will “vote off” a Troupe member each week and a new cast member will audition immediately to take the spot. The replacement could be a professional actor “waiting in the wings” or one of the local performers who captures the heart or imagination of the audience. The proposal in the first cycle, shows are presented in thirteen cities. In following seasons, other US cities and foreign countries could play a part. Each week an original performance is cast, rehearsed, and presented in ONE DAY in front of a live audience.

Every show has a solid and funny denouement (reveal) where the victim comes back from the dead to “tell all.”\n\n70. 70 The Show Profile: This is the way a normal episode might be filmed. On a Thursday night, the Murder Mystery “bus” pulls into a city and unloads the tired cranky actors and crew into their hotel. The assumption is that they have been on the road. THE CAMERAS FOLLOW ALL OF THIS. In Cedar falls we will stay, and film, in local hotels including the historic Blackhawk Hotel on Main Street just a few doors down from the Oster Regent theatre. This would be typical of the various cities we visit. The cast and crew critique the show from the last week finds out whom the new Troupe member will be. In the second or third season, the staff goes to the website gurus who show the results from on line voting. The company goes over the details for the following day frequently getting into arguments and revealing personal rivalries. The company is kept together by the show’s creator and father figure, author/director Paul Warshauer, who has presented over 350 of these murder mysteries in a career that spans over 20 years. His quirky personality keeps everyone on their toes. After the first evening meeting, some of the cast goes out drinking and others spend the night in the hotel or reviewing their scripts. The camera follows them all. Below is the KING OF MURDER MYSTERIES! The Troupe will travel from city to city in the “Murder Bus” which has corporate sponsor logos. Naturally the cameras will roll as the performers, crew, and producers argue and complain about their parts, the amateur performers, accommodations, the author, etc. For the Sizzle tape we rent from a local company.
