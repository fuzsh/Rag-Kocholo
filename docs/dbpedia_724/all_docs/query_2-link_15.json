        "text": "The Illinois Masonic Temple in Aurora went up in flames late Monday night, and firefighters are still working to put out the fire (CBS Chicago/Mugo Odigwe).\n\nPolice and firefighters from Aurora Fire Department responded about 10:00 p.m. Monday October 7, 2019 to a fire in a historic building — the Illinois Masonic Temple, 104 South Lincoln Avenue in Aurora. The fire response at the 4-5-story building was elevated to a 3rd Alarm by about 1:45 a.m. this morning.\n\nAccording to Aurora Fire Department the 50,000 square-foot building is at high risk of collapse. Part of the building collapsed and brought down power lines. By midnight about 500 ComEd customers were without power. By 7:15 a.m. Tuesday about 183 ComEd customers were without power.\n\nIn the building’s most recent use it was known as the Lincoln Manor Banquet and Conference Center at the corner of Lincoln Avenue and Benton Street. The banquet hall and conference center closed in 2006.\n\nThe Masonic Temple was built in 1922 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2009, the building was listed by Landmark Illinois as one of the most endangered buildings in Illinois.\n\nVideo news feed from ABC 7 Chicago Chopper 7 HD (Facebook) …\n\nMORE INFO BELOW ADS …\n\n^^ MOBILE?
