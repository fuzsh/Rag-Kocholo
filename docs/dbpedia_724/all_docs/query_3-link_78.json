        "text": "Immigrants from Cornwall, Great Britian, in Marquette County\n\nBy: Russell M. Magnaghi\n\nLabor\n\nCornish miners were always seen as an independent group of rugged individualists who worked for the company. The stoping contract, introduced by the Cornish, was a system whereby each miner contracted with his mine captain for the work he had to do. Given their expertise in mining and the fact that many of them were mine bosses, superintendents, and managers, they were not attracted to radical union groups. However, throughout the nineteenth century there were many instances where Cornish miners or their bosses went on strike because of low or unpaid wages, brutal bosses, or poor working conditions. These were usually isolated cases.\n\nNon-Mining Occupations\n\nWithout going into all of the occupations that the Cornish went into other than mining it is fair to note that when and where possible they started their own businesses. The Lutey family came from gardening folk in the Old Country and when they came to Michigan they carried on the tradition as florists. They had shops in both Ishpeming and Marquette where the name is still associated with flowers. William Trebilcock in 1909 was a major concrete contractor in Ishpeming and did extensive work for the city on streets, sidewalks, and structures. A study of the 1910 Federal census for Negaunee and Ishpeming, located in the Northern Michigan University Archives would provide extensive detail on the varies occupations Cornishmen got involved in.\n\nCornish vs Other Nationalities\n\nThe Cornish came to the mining company speaking the English language and possessing expertise to work in the mines. As a result, they obtained the best positions in the mines, while others with fewer skills or late arrivals were forced to take lower positions. The Cornish also kept other immigrants from working their way into the mining hierarchy. The Irish, who went to the Copper Country in the early days of mining, also spoke English but did not have the same mining expertise as the Cornish. Religious differences between the Catholic Irish and the Methodist Cornish resulted violent clashes between these two Celtic people at times in the 1840s and 1850. Later on the Marquette Range many immigrants such as the Finns did not appreciate the Cornish and the fact that they held important jobs and decided whop received the best jobs in the mines and on the surface.\n\nCornish in the Wars\n\nIn all of the wars the United States fought in, Cornishmen participated. During the Civil War both recently arrived Cornish immigrants, Cornish-Americans and their sons served in the Union Army from Michigan. Stephen Cocking, a brigade bugler from the Upper Peninsula, served in the 23rd Michigan Volunteers. William Tresize came to the United States with his parents who first settled in Pennsylvania and then settled permanently in the Keweenaw and he worked in the mines until 1862. At that time he joined the 27th Michigan Volunteers and was wounded before Petersburg. Later, after returning from a mining stint in the West, Cocking became the lighthouse keeper at Copper Harbor. Cornish immigrants and Cornish-Americans who served heroically in the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, the Korean War, Vietnam War, the Gulf War and the War in Iraq."
