        "text": "Saw a thing the other day noting that formal dining rooms have pretty much become a thing of the past in modern homes.\n\nWhich isn’t too surprising, I guess. Times have gotten a lot less formal these days. For instance, just look at how people dress these days to go to church or attend what used to be formal open houses.\n\nEven the definitions of mealtimes have changed, reflecting the end of what small bit of the rural lifestyle remained for the vast majority of the nation’s population.\n\nWhen I was a youngster growing up on a farm, dinner was served at noon, and supper was the evening meal. I recall being invited to dinner at my second grade classmate’s house and was surprised that his parents—the local Presbyterian minister and his wife—meant the evening not the noon meal.\n\nThe nomenclature was even codified into the radio programs we listened to before the arrival of TVs in our rural community. “Dinner Bell Time” was the noon show on WLS-AM, my family’s favorite radio station, while the “Suppertime Frolic,” with disk jockey Randy Blake playing mostly country-western tunes (that evolved into rock ‘n roll) entertained my sisters on WJJD-AM while they did the supper dishes.\n\nWe, of course, had a dining room in our farmhouse that was used for family dinners as well as when extra hands showed up when corn shelling took place or other times with more than just us folks had to be fed.\n\nMost people don’t give formal dinners any more, and even out in the country the need for dining rooms largely died with the rise of all-encompassing farm mechanizing in the 1940s and the disappearance of diversified farming in the 1960s. Before that happened, farmhouse dining rooms were busy places essential to the operation of farms, especially during harvest season, due to the need to feed large numbers of men and boys who were working to get grain in out of the field.\n\nHarvesting and threshing small grains—wheat, oats, rye, barley—was a time-consuming and labor-intensive process that farmers (normally one of the most conservative bunches) began adopting new mechanized harvesting processes early in the nation’s history.\n\nThe long, complicated process began with cutting ripe grain standing in the field, gathering the stalks in bundles, and stacking the bundles into what were called shocks to dry.\n\nBefore mechanization, the dried grain was then hauled to the barn or other building where it was dumped on the floor and beaten with flails to separate the grain from the stalks. The stalks—straw (not to be confused with hay)—was separated from the grain to be used as animal bedding. Then the grain had to be winnowed to separate it from the hulls before it could be bagged and hauled to market.\n\nThe first operation mechanized was harvesting—cutting the grain—something that was first tried by the ancient Romans, but which wasn’t really perfected until Cyrus McCormick developed his harvester in the 1830s. McCormick’s harvester was pulled by one or two horses and cut the grain stalks allowing a man walking alongside to rake them into rows to make hand-bundling easier. It was far more efficient than the old method of cutting by hand with scythe and cradle.\n\nMcCormick and other ingenious inventors then came up with the reaper, which cut the grain and allowed one or two other men riding the machine (besides the driver) to bundle the grain as they moved through the field. That was followed by the binder, which cut and bound the bundles mechanically.\n\nMeanwhile, mechanical threshers had also been perfected. Steam powered and called separators because they separated grain from stalks and chaff, they were first big and stationary, but soon were put on wheels so they could be pulled by steam-powered tractors to wherever they were needed to thresh grain. Most farmers couldn’t afford such expensive machinery so they formed cooperatives to buy, maintain, and operate the machines. Threshing rings—so called because the machines were moved from farm to farm around the farms of the members of the co-op—consisted of up to 30 men and boys who had to be fed for several days during the threshing season at each farm participating.\n\nThus those dining rooms that were features at every farmhouse, even some of the smallest, where gangs of hungry men and boys ate roast beef, pork, and chicken, bushels of potatoes, and whatever garden vegetables were ripe and drank gallons of coffee, milk, and water cold from the well. The work of the threshing rings’ farm wives during harvest season was every bit as hard and complicated as that of their husbands and sons.\n\nBut by the late 1940s, the era of horse-powered farming plus those threshing rings had rapidly drawn to a close as individual farmers were able to buy one of the new efficient and relatively inexpensive combined harvesters—called combines—that both cut and threshed the grain. And within a few years the big dinners farm wives had to organize for gangs of men were gone, too.\n\nFarm families marveled at the sudden change, this one for the better, after the horrible years of the Great Farm Depression that began right after World War I and lasted until World War II. It was during that last world war that so much new mechanization began replacing the old horse-based farming culture.\n\nBy 1949 out here in Kendall County, tractor-pulled or self-propelled combines had become the norm during the harvest season, and those once-crowded dining rooms were relegated to family dinners and parties.\n\nAs Clara Smith Walker, the Kendall County Record’s Oswego correspondent observed in the paper’s July 7, 1949 edition: “By the time this paper is delivered, the oats harvest will be about completed for 1949. Many find the crop, though of fine quality, is below the average yield. What a difference from the former way of a few years ago when the farmers ‘went threshing’ for three or four weeks, depending on the weather, each August! If one can recall the days when the housewives served both dinner and supper, you are getting old.”\n\nNot that some folks didn’t look back on the threshing era with nostalgia. But usually those were people who hadn’t had to deal with either the work of threshing or preparing those huge meals for days at a time.\n\nOne of those who expressed some nostalgia for that era was Katherine “Kit” Naden, a city girl who married a Kendall County farmer and who wrote for the Record under the pen name, The Rural Woman.\n\nOn July 27, 1950, The Rural Woman wrote in her weekly “Ordinary Things” column: “‘A sower went forth to sow’ last spring and this week he’s reaping a harvest. The seed fell on good ground, for look at the fields with their growth of yellow grain. In this mechanized age, the whole process of harvesting is done by machinery. But who wouldn’t enjoy one of those larruping ‘thrashing’ dinners of ye older time?”\n\nClara Walker, well remembering the back-breaking labor it took to cook those threshermens’ dinners in the era of hand-fired cookstoves, hand-pumped water, and washing the dirty dishes, pots, and pans created by up to 30 men, was not amused by The Rural Woman’s wide-eyed nostalgia.\n\nIn the next week’s Record, she sardonically noted: “The Rural Woman may have her ‘larruping thrashing dinners,’ but as for this correspondent, after nearly 50 years of threshing, she is glad the farmers have combines. And did she forget that we used to have threshing suppers, too, for several days—maybe a week if it rained—and for about 20 men? Something about which the modern farmer’s wife knows nothing of—the long, hot days of preparation. But it was fun, too, if one had good health.”\n\nAs noted above, by the time I came along threshing was but a memory, the old equipment parked out in back of farmsteads rusting away. But our dining rooms, both on the farm and at our house when we moved to town were still well-used for the crowded family dinners that are themselves now things of the past.\n\nAnd farming itself, which used to be such a group activity, is now a largely solitary vocation with huge computerized machines operated by one person doing the work it literally took dozens of men to do until the middle of the 20th Century. Mechanization’s been so successful and so efficient, in fact, that the numbers of farmers decrease annually as do the number of farms, which have significantly increased in size through the years.\n\nWe don’t notice the effects of mechanization and crop improvements so much around our little corner of northern Illinois due to population and commercial growth steadily pushing west from the Chicago metro region. But you really see it in central and southern Illinois and in largely rural states like Iowa, where whole towns with their schools, churches, and businesses are evaporating, because one farm family now does the work it took up to a dozen of them to do just a few decades ago.\n\nLots of houses of a certain age still boast formal dining rooms, but their use, like most all the rest of life these days, has drastically evolved through the years. But even after the era of those “larruping thrashing dinners” was long past, they did create nostalgia for some.\n\nI remember talking about her life as a farm wife with my grandmother many years ago. Noting all the changes modern life had brought—shortly before, we’d just watched a man walk on the moon—I asked her if she’d ever want to go back to “the good old days.”\n\nAt first, she looked at me like I’d lost my mind, but then got a thoughtful look on her face. “Well,” she slowly mused, “Maybe just for dinner.”\n\nBack long before the first humans arrived in these parts, Mother Nature used the Fox River Torrent to create not only the Fox River itself, but also a huge gravel bed along the river’s banks just south of what eventually became today’s Village of Oswego.\n\nThe gravel bed was soon overlain by wind-blown and water-carried soil that grew the mixture of timber and prairie plants the area’s settlers found when they arrived in the early 1830s.\n\nThe land was surveyed along with the rest of most of Kendall County in 1838, and was included in surveyed Township 37 North of the baseline, Range 8 East of the Third Principle Meridian. Townships are comprised of 36 sections, each one-mile square. The surveyors found that the Fox River flowed through the southeast corner of the surveyed township, something that would have future political implications.\n\nAfter it was surveyed, the land was put up for sale in 1842 by the U.S. Government. A number of those early settlers bought parts of that land, including Section 23, Daniel Cooney, (west fractional half of the southeast quarter), R J. Smith, (east half of the southeast quarter), Walter Selvey (southwest quarter), Section 26, Ruth Kennedy and J. Burbee, the northwest quarter, and Section 27, T. Pierce, southwest quarter, all in 1843.\n\nIn the new Illinois Constitution of 1848, county voters across the state were permitted to establish township governments. Previously, counties were governed by three-man commissions. With the new constitution’s permission and upon the vote of their residents, county boards would be comprised of the supervisors of each of the county’s townships. In 1850, most counties in the northern part of Illinois adopted township governments, including Kendall. Starting that year, Kendall’s county board was comprised of the supervisors of each of the county’s nine townships.\n\nIn practical terms, that meant some of the boundary lines of the old surveyed townships were adjusted to make township administration easier. Bristol Township, for instance, gave up those sections south of the Fox River, which were then added to Oswego Township. And many of those sections were the ones underlain by that gravel Mother Nature deposited so many eons before.\n\nBy 1870, according to the Kendall County atlas, the land where all that gravel was located was then owned (moving from north to south along the west side of the right of way of the Ottawa, Oswego, and Fox River Valley Rail Road) by Peter Cooney, Frederich Leigh, William Cooney, and Mrs. C.J. Cowdrey. By 1903, land ownership had again consolidated, with it being in the hands (again north to south) of A.L. Truman, William O. Leigh, Frederich Leigh Jr., and George M. Cowdrey.\n\nStarting in the late 1870s, the southern part of the parcel became a popular picnic area, since it was heavily wooded with highlands on the river bluff overlooking the Fox River. By the 1880s, its popularity was general throughout the area.\n\nFor instance, on Aug. 19, 1885 the Kendall County Record reported that the Yorkville post of the Grand Army of the Republic—the Civil War veterans group—had held a picnic there: “The Grand Army picnic at Cowdrey’s Park last Saturday was not as largely attended as was expected, Saturday being a bad day for business men to leave. However, there were three carloads down from Aurora, a large delegation from Oswego, and quite a crowd from Yorkville. The day was a perfect one, and there could be no more beautiful site for picnic party than this riverside resort on George Cowdrey’s farm. There are fine springs on the ground, there was plenty of ice water, hammocks, and swings and boats on the river, and Cliff Sweet with his orchestra.”\n\nOn Aug. 25, 1886, the Record reported from “Cowdrey’s Camping Ground” that: “The grove is a delightful place and combines all the advantages of a nice camping ground. It is quite rolling and covered with beautiful trees and being located on the river’s bank offers fine advantages for boating and bathing purposes. A small brook runs through the center of the grounds and within a few feet of the tents.”\n\nInterest in mining the gravel on the Cowdrey land at the south edge of the parcel was first announced in 1893. The area of interest at first was on the east side of the railroad tracks, with the wooded scenic land along the river not included in the mining plans.\n\nOn April 12 of that year, the Record reported that “George Cowdrey is negotiating with Chicago parties for selling them a part of his gravel deposit.” And by Oct. 11, the Record could report that “Operations in the gravel works down at Cowdry’s have been commenced.”\n\nGravel mining operations continued for just a few months before they were stopped due to the Panic of 1893, a severe financial depression. It wasn’t until 1898 that the Record could report additional activity in the Cowdrey gravel mining area. On Dec. 7 that year, the Record reported that “Parties from abroad (Elgin we believe) are prospecting on the Cowdrey place with a view of opening a gravel bed, the output to be shipped to Chicago. There were such works established there several years ago, but failed during the hard times of ’93.”\n\nWith gravel mining continuing west of the railroad, William Cowdrey sold the scenic riverfront land at the southern tip of the parcel to a Chicago developer for use as a resort. As the Record reported in December 1899: “A deal which has been in the process of negotiation some time was concluded this morning and will be of great interest to the people of lower Kane and Kendall counties. The deal involves the transfer of Cowdrey’s Park below Oswego to a wealthy syndicate, who will transform it into a private park with an elegant club house.\n\n“The deed of 20 acres comprising the park runs to William Derby of Chicago and the price paid was $2,000, $100 an acre. At the same time, the gravel bank on the other side of the CB&Q railroad was deeded to the railroad company for $200 an acre, the two deals giving Mr. Cowdrey the use of $4,000 cash, which will place his finances in comfortable condition and at the same time, leaving him the most valuable portion of his farm for agricultural purposes.”\n\nThat resort was named The Elms and for many years was a popular summer destination for Chicago families looking to spend the summer outside the city. The area developed into The Elms, in fact, has been used ever since as a campground, formerly known during past years as Hide-A-Way Lakes and now called Fox Bluff Resort.\n\nGravel mining by the railroad continued for several years, with the company gradually buying more land upstream from the original purchase. By the early years of the 20th Century the entire area north virtually all the way to Minkler Road was being mined for its high-quality gravel. During that era, both the CB&Q Railroad and the H.D. Conkey Sand and Gravel Company began extensive gravel mining, working from south to north from the west border of the railroad right of way to the Fox River.\n\nAs an example, on June 11, 1913, the Record’s Oswego correspondent reported that: “Ivan Fugate was severely hurt at the Conkey Gravel company’s plant and was taken to the Aurora hospital where he is receiving care. He was working around a belt when he was caught by the pulley and thrown to the floor, breaking his jaw bone and reviving serious bruises.”\n\nIn May 1913, the Stevens-Adamson Manufacturing Company’s trade publication, The Labor-Saver, reported the operation was shipping out 10 railcar loads of gravel a day, mostly for use by the railroad as roadbed ballast.\n\nBoth companies gradually continued to expand their operations. In September 1918, the Record reported that Chris Herren sold 80 acres west of the railroad to the CB&Q for gravel mining.\n\nBy the 1920s, the area was being heavily mined. Both the railroad and Conkey had built a number of rail sidings into the gravel pit area by that time to handle the heavy mining activity that was creating numerous lakes and spoil heaps.\n\nGradually, the Conkey and its succeeding companies, and the CB&Q Railroad acquired title to the entire area between the railroad tracks and the Fox River underlain by the huge gravel deposit.\n\nThe mine’s operations had ceased by the late 1930s, since the railroad’s needs for roadbed ballast were declining. The mine reopened during World War II to supply gravel for the war effort, but then closed again about 1950 as rail mileage across the nation began to be abandoned as more and more goods were transported by truck.\n\nThe bulk of the land was eventually acquired from its commercial owners by the Illinois Department of Waterways, now merged into the Illinois Department of Conservation. A portion of the old gravel mine was leased by the Village of Oswego and Oswego Township as a municipal solid waste dump.\n\nOn May 28, 1953, the Oswego Ledger carried this notice concerning the—to modern sensibilities at least—casual way the township solid waste dump operated: “Notice from township highway commissioner Kenneth Gowran: “Please get a key to the dump and put all rubbish in the pit where it belongs. Do not put rubbish along the private road on south side of dump. There is more rubbish there now than I can cover. Violators of this will have to clean up the mess.\n\n“We lease this property from the State of Illinois for your benefit so please help us keep it looking respectable.\n\n“The gate on the dump will be open Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in the future. If you have rubbish to dispose of on other days get a key for the gate from Kenneth Gowran residence, Lyle Shoger, or Oswego Hardware Store.”\n\nOn Sept. 16, 1953, the Ledger carried more news about using the area as a municipal dump site: “The [Oswego Village] board granted the village president authority to sign a five-year lease on the village dump. The property is owned by the Illinois Department of Waterways. The rental is $50 per year. The village also plans to reinstall a gate to the dump and to complete fencing around it to discourage indiscriminate dumping. The dump, which is used jointly by the village and township residents, is maintained by the township road commissioner.”\n\nIn late April 1957, the Ledger reported that some of the area adjacent to the old gravel mining area near the municipal dump was to be developed: “A preliminary plat of a new 39 lot subdivision was presented to the Oswego Plan Commission last Monday night by Chris Herren. The proposed subdivision area lies on what is commonly referred to as the old Cutter School Road, just off Route 71 south and west of Oswego. The area lies between the river and the CB&Q Railroad tracks and has outlets on the river road that runs from Route 71 toward the village and township dump area.”\n\nThe Oswego Park District had been established by voter referendum in 1950—its name was officially changed to the Oswegoland Park District in February 1966. For its first decade the district didn’t own any park land of its own but instead hosted youth and adult programming at Oswego School District facilities. In 1960 Don L. Dise, developer of Boulder Hill, donated the first park to the district, SuzanJohn Park, located on an acre and a half site between Durango and Hampton roads in the development.\n\nIn 1961, the district purchased the 21.5 acre Waa Kee Sha Park, a natural area located on Reservation Road south of Oswego, making it the second district-owned park before it obtained what is still its largest parcel of parkland.\n\nOn June 27, 1963, the Oswego Ledger reported that the Department of Conservation had transferred ownership of a large parcel of the old gravel mining site to the park district: “A 160 acre parcel south of Oswego along the Fox River was transferred to the Oswego Park District by the Illinois Department of Conservation after Gov. Otto Kerner signed House Bill 397 into law. The area was planned to be developed over the next 10 years into a forest preserve-type park area…The extensive river frontage will offer numerous advantages to boating and fishing enthusiasts…The Department of Conservation has reserved a part of the property for development of a low-level dam, which is part of the general Fox River Development Plan from Ottawa to McHenry.”\n\nThe park district continued to allow municipal dumping on the section that had been used for the purpose for several years, but it was a constant maintenance headache. As the Ledger reported in October 1964: “A few thoughtless people have been dumping refuse outside of the designated areas at the Oswegoland Dump. Residents are hereby notified that persons who dump any kind of materials anywhere but in the designated areas will not only be ordered to clean up the mess, but will be taken to court and fined. The fine for such an offense is not less than $25 nor more than $100.”\n\nIn July 1965, the old dumping area was closed and a new area was designated as the municipal dump site: “Effective as of this date, the dump used by Oswegoans for the past several years between the gravel road and the river will be closed. All future dumping will be done in the designated area only on the southwest side of the road and only on days and during hours when an attendant is on duty. Any person dumping any kind of refuse, including brush and tree trimmings, at any other spot or outside of regular hours will be prosecuted as heavily as the law allows.”\n\nAlthough dumping was still allowed on the park land, development of the parcel as a designated natural area began in 1965. On July 15, the Ledger reported that: “Work has begun on the new park area which lies south of Oswego. On Monday, Mr., Francis Kluckhohn of Hawk, Inc., began filling in the old Oswego dump and leveling the area for the entranceway, parking area, and future picnic area of the park site.\n\n“A strip of ground approximately 1,000 feet long lying parallel with the Fox River is being worked on at this time. The total area of the park is 168 acres. Future plans include nature trails, some of which are now cut, and possibly a lake being dredged out of one of the old pits. The park area has already seen use, particularly by the Boy Scouts for the many splendid campsites which it affords.”\n\nThe next year, the Ledger reported the old dumping area was being closed: “Effective as of 5 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 13, 1966, the area now being used for municipal dumping purposes on Oswegoland Park District property will be closed for a period of 60 days. The dump is being closed pursuant to a hearing to be held by the State of Illinois Department of Sanitation in Springfield the week of Aug. 22, brought about by complaints of taxpayers who live in the area.”\n\nSubsequently, the municipal dump was permanently closed.\n\nIn the 1990s, a resident near the park made a series of complaints to the park district and to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency concerning the old dump area. The park district was forced to expend a considerable amount of money to remove alleged pollutants and debris from the park land. In addition, the district was fined for filling some of the gravel mining areas by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which claimed the areas were natural wetlands.\n\nToday, the parcel, named Saw Wee Kee Park, is one of the Oswegoland Park District’s largest natural areas park facilities as well as one of the area’s natural areas jewels. The rest of the extensive old gravel mining area is today used for a variety of purposes including as private hunting, fishing, and shooting clubs. And, of course, the old summer resort that began as The Elms is still welcoming visitors to enjoy Kendall County’s oldest campground.\n\nOswego is at a crossroads. No, I’m not talking figuratively or philosophically here, because Oswego is literally at a crossroads. In fact, Oswego IS a crossroads.\n\nThanks to that happenstance, Oswego changed over from a small country village primarily catering to the surrounding agricultural area into a bustling, constantly growing suburban community, a change that began decades ago.\n\nIn the 1830s and 1840s, roads were the primary means of overland travel the area’s White settlers used to get here from their former homes to the south and the east. While we did have a few pioneer families arrive from Southern states, the bulk of those early settlers came west from the New England and Middle Atlantic states, traveling overland either in family groups or in actual wagon trains.\n\nLewis B. Judson and Levi Arnold decided to establish a new village where an existing trail used by the area’s Native People crossed the Fox River. The trail crossed using a shallow ford created by a smooth limestone shelf the river flowed over not far upstream from the mouth of Waubonsie Creek. Native Americans found the crossing easy there, and so did the wagons and stagecoaches of the White settlers who began arriving in the early 1830s.\n\nThat trail eventually became a road extending from what’s now Naperville west across the prairie to Oswego and then bent a bit southwesterly to the ford across Blackberry Creek before bearing west and north to the hamlet of Little Rock before going on all the way to modern Dixon, then where John Dixon’s ferry crossed the Rock River. From there, the trail led north up to the lead mining region around the Fever River and the bustling commercial center of Galena.\n\nAnother trail that became a settlers’ highway ran from Oswego east and south to the settlement of Plainfield at Walker’s Grove on the DuPage River. From there, the road continued easterly to the growing village of Juliet on the DesPlaines River. For whatever reason, Juliet’s residents apparently didn’t intend to participate in the fun when Romeoville was named and so changed their town’s name to Joliet in honor of French explorer Louis Jolliet—although leaving one “L” out of the name.\n\nYet another pioneer trail that became an important mail route was the western branch of the Chicago to Ottawa Trail, linking the city on the lake with the head of navigation on the Illinois River. At some seasons of the year, steamboats could reach Ottawa, but for most of the time, the main steamboat port was just a couple miles downstream from the rapids that often blocked boat traffic at Peru. That road came west from Naperville just like the road to Dixon and Galena but at Oswego it turned south following Oswego’s Main Street and then modern Ill. Route 71. It bypassed Yorkville a couple miles to the west on the way to the Hollenbacks’ settlement at Newark before heading across the prairie to the junction with the High Prairie Trail just a few miles north of Ottawa. The High Prairie Trail extended from the lakefront at Chicago west to Brush Hill—modern intersection of U.S. Route 34 and York Road—where it branched off from the trail to Naperville and instead headed across the prairie to Plainfield. From there it extended to Daniel Platt’s settlement that became Plattville and to Holderman’s Grove (both in Kendall County) before extending on to Ottawa.\n\nOswego’s final road connection was the Fox River Trail that ran from Ottawa north up the west side of the Fox River through modern Dixon to Penfield, a hamlet at the mouth of Rob Roy Creek not far from the landmark architectural gem, the Edith Farnsworth House. From there it followed Fox Road into Bristol (now the north side of Yorkville) and then north and east roughly following modern U.S. Route 34 to Oswego, where it crossed the Fox River on that village’s fine ford before heading north all the way to LaFox, later renamed Geneva.\n\nIn 1841, the Illinois General Assembly created Kendall County by clipping three townships—Little Rock, Bristol, and Oswego—from Kane County and six—NaAuSay, Kendall, Big Grove, Fox, Lisbon, and Seward—from LaSalle County. A three-man commission appointed by the General Assembly made centrally-located Yorkville the county seat. But all those roads leading into Oswego probably led to it becoming the new county’s most populous township and village. And that probably led to Oswego organizing a referendum in 1845 to move the county seat.\n\nThe upshot of that election was that the county seat was, indeed, moved up to Oswego. The township had promised to provide a brand new courthouse if the county seat moved there, and they did, indeed, building one on the block bounded by Monroe, Jefferson, Madison, and Jackson, the site today of the Byline Bank and the Oswego Post Office.\n\nBut in the days of horse-drawn transport, traveling to Oswego to do whatever official business needed to be done was no easy task. Which was good for Oswego hotel operators—the village boasted three of them plus a few boarding houses—but not for taxpayers’ pocketbooks. So in 1859, another referendum was held and centrally-located Yorkville was again chosen as the county seat, and where it has remained since.\n\nBut transportation technology was already undergoing major changes by the time settlement began here in the Fox River Valley. The first big innovation was the remarkable Erie Canal. The project of New York Governor DeWitt Clinton, the canal linked the Hudson River with Lake Erie. Over a course of 300 miles, the Erie Canal actually crossed some geographical heights we here in Illinois would rightly call mountains via a series of well-engineered locks. It was completed in just eight years, opening the vast New York market to livestock, grain, and other products produced by the Western states bordering the Great Lakes. And in return, the canal carried finished goods and settlers seeking new homes in the west.\n\nThe success of the Erie Canal prompted a veritable canal mania across the nation as state after state—virtually all of them north of the Ohio River—engaged in canal building. And that included Illinois, too.\n\nEver since 1673 when Jolliet and Jesuit Father Jacques Marquette had paddled up the Illinois River, the DesPlaines River and portaged over to the Chicago River to get to Lake Michigan the idea of a canal linking Lake Michigan with the Illinois River had been kicked around. In the 1830s, with canal mania at its height, work began on the Illinois & Michigan Canal linking the lake with the Illinois River at Peru. But then the Panic of 1837 (a severe financial depression) struck, and work on the canal pretty much stopped because Illinois was bankrupt. Way over budget and far behind schedule, the I&M Canal didn’t open until 1848.\n\nAnd that gave an opening for another transportation revolution. Less than a decade after the Erie Canal was finished and shortly after the I&M opened, rail lines began extending all over the country. While canals were huge transportation successes, they were still limited in that they shut down during the winter months’ freezing temperatures. Railroads, on the other hand, offered all-weather, year-round transportation slowed only by deep snow.\n\nThe first steam railroad line, the Galena & Chicago Union Railroad, opened its first length of tracks in 1849, going only so far west as Oak Park. But over the next few years, the amount of railroad mileage in Illinois literally exploded. By 1853, tracks cross the Fox River at Aurora and were aimed at Galesburg on the Mississippi River. Little Rock Township Marcus Steward resident told the new railroad company that if they ran the right-of-way through his property, he’d build a town on it. Which he did, and that’s how Plano was founded. And within just a few years of it opening, railroad tracks paralleled the I&M Canal, siphoning some of its business.\n\nSo by 1850, canals and railroads were considered the most important new transportation technologies, and roads were gradually being pushed aside, particularly their funding from the federal government on down. For instance, the National Road, which was envisioned to run from Maryland all the way to St. Louis saw its funding gradually disappear so that it only reached Vandalia, then the capital of Illinois. And that stretch, from Indiana to Vandalia, was little more than a cleared trace across the prairie with little or no improvements. The feeling was, roads would be supplanted by both rail lines and canals. But the problem proved to be goods, including grain and livestock from farms, had to get to a rail line or canal in order to use it.\n\nIt took a half-century of people putting up with terrible roads before various “Good Roads” organizations began to arise, both nationwide and here in Illinois. Spurred first by “wheelmen,” bicycling enthusiasts, and then by automobile, truck, and bus owners, the clamor for good roads became deafening.\n\nIn 1918, during the dark days of World War I, Illinois voters approved a $60 million bond issue to fund a system of paved highways that would link every county in the state. With a growing system of paved highways, combined with the perfection of affordable, dependable automobiles, all of a sudden, roads were important again. And with roads receiving government funding, and railroads not receiving it, the days of travel by passenger train and interurban trolleys between virtually every area of Illinois were numbered.\n\nHistorically overnight, Oswego found itself an important crossroads once again. When the state’s spate of building new paved roads ended in the 1940s, it turned out that three state highways began at Oswego, Ill. Routes 31, 25, and 71, while a busy multi-state U.S. highway, U.S. Route 34, passed directly through the village’s downtown.\n\nThat U.S. highway, which followed the old stagecoach route from Oswego east to Naperville, would prove to be the corridor down which population and commercial growth would flow. By the 1980s, Oswego Township found itself bordered by three of the fast-growing Chicago Collar Counties—Kane, DuPage, and Will. Existing municipalities from those counties began annexing into Kendall County, but Oswego Township, especially, found that its location adjacent to the Collar Counties and on the fast-growing U.S. Route 34 Corridor was a recipe for explosive growth. Before the real estate bubble finally broke in 2008, Kendall County, driven by Oswego Township’s growth, was, in percentage terms, the fastest-growing county in the nation.\n\nFor those of us interested in history and its impact on the places we live, watching the effect of roads on Oswego during the last 190 years or so has been fascinating. Not the least of that fascination has been realizing that no single person or group actually planned for that growth to happen. Rather, it’s more an accident of nature, sort of like the sudden appearance of a volcano on Main Street. Judson and Arnold placed their new village where they did because of that excellent ford across the Fox River. They had no inkling their new town’s location would become adjacent to the fastest growing region in the northern Midwest. But here we find ourselves today. And really, given the drastic condition of so many rural areas of our state and nation these days, would we rather be planning how best to deal with growth or be coping with depopulation and economic devastation?\n\n.\n\nModern life around these parts seems chock full of challenges, but at least we don’t have to worry about sharing the streets with grazing cows. Time was, that was a real problem.\n\nBack in the 19th and early 20th centuries, cows were commonly kept in town to provide families with milk and cream. Along with the family’s driving horse and a few chickens urban cows were milked in the town barns that stood on most small town lots, and on many in large cities, too. In small towns, cows were allowed to wander at large to graze on the grass and weeds that grew freely on the dirt streets and alleys of the era. But as noted, those roving cows caused problems.\n\nAnd the May 20, 1869 the Kendall County Record reported that the Oswego Village Board had decided to do something about it. In a story by the Record’s Oswego correspondent, Lorenzo Rank, headlined “The Great Cow Rebellion!” Rank reported: “The great sensation of Oswego last week was the cow rebellion. It happened this way: The corporation powers that be ordained that all cattle should be prohibited from running at large in the village streets. A lot of cows soon were in the pound. Cow owners were filled with indignation, denouncing it as a piece of highhanded legislation, a crushing down of the poor, etc. The government backed down. The cows are now enjoying the liberty of the streets. As for myself in that struggle, I was on the side of the cow; am too much of a calf, that is, like milk too well to go back on her.”\n\nFor the next two decades, villages tried to curb roaming livestock with various levels of success. For instance, on Aug. 14, 1873, Record Publisher John R. Marshall observed from Yorkville that: “Village folks should keep gentle cows. Cows that are vicious and hungry break through people’s fences and eat up their sweet corn. This is not right–keep nice easy cows. Bad cows make men swear and women lose their temper.”\n\nAnd up in Montgomery, on June 1, 1882 the Record correspondent reported more cow controversy: “On the 29th day of April a special election was held in R. Loucks’ coal office for the purpose of entertaining whether the majority of the voters desired cattle, etc. to run at large upon our streets. Thirty-three votes were cast; twenty-three against cattle as free commoners, and ten for. On the 10th of May the ordinance went into effect. Those who own cows have resolved themselves into a “milk brigade,” and will refuse to sell or give milk to the families of those who voted against the cows.”\n\nEventually, all the cows in towns up and down the Fox Valley were confined behind fences. “Good fences make good neighbors,” poet Robert Frost’s fictional neighbor observed in Frost’s poem, “Mending Fence.” Frost was referring to the stone walls that surrounded New England fields and farmsteads. In the poem, Frost wasn’t entirely certain the fence between his orchard and his neighbor’s pine grove was at all necessary—but the sentiment was a New England truism that worked most of the time back East.\n\nAnd as it turned out, it worked even better out here on the Illinois frontier.\n\nSettling the Illinois prairies meant learning a host of new skills for virtually all the pioneers who arrived in the northern part of the state from the 1820s through the 1850s. Those who moved north from southern Illinois, as well as those who came from the Eastern forests that stretched unbroken from the Atlantic to western Indiana, found the old skills of clearing timber in order to plant crops were no longer needed. Instead, the challenge was to survive on the rolling, sparsely-timbered grasslands that covered the northern two-thirds of Illinois.\n\nInstead of the old way of improving farmland, which consisted of girdling trees to kill them, cutting them down the second year, then grubbing and pulling stumps to create open farmland, and, finally removing all those rocks handy for making walls, prairie pioneers were faced with the problem of dense prairie sod.\n\nThe regular plows of the era were not capable of cutting through the thick and extremely tough prairie sod, so most pioneers contracted with an earlier arrival who already owned a special plow to “break,” or turn over, the sod the first time.\n\nHere in Kendall County, Peter Lamsette, known by the settlers as Peter Specie because he would only accept hard cash, “specie,” owned a breaking plow and the yokes of oxen needed to pull it. The earliest settlers paid Specie to break the native sod with his plow, and as a result, he was responsible for helping create the county’s first farms.\n\nAccording to most accounts, it cost from $2 to $2.50 per acre to have the prairie broken, or about twice the government price of the land itself, which was set by Congress at $1.25 per acre. Conversely, it cost an average of $12 per acre to clear timber to create fields so even with the cost of breaking sod, prairie land was a better deal. Especially since the resulting farmland was far more productive than the thin timber soil east of the prairies that began in western Indiana.\n\nBut while it was less labor intensive to create farmland on the prairie, there were other obstacles to be overcome. A bit one was fencing. Fencing was one of the major challenges the pioneers were forced to deal with, a not inconsiderable problem given the scarcity of timber on the prairie.\n\nWhy fence anything to begin with? First of all, as we saw in the examples above, vulnerable land including fields and gardens, had to be fenced to protect it from the cattle, sheep, and hogs that were allowed to run free on the prairie. A field could be completely destroyed overnight by a herd of roving livestock.\n\nSecond, better farmers realized that if they were to improve the breeds of livestock on their farms, they needed to keep their breeding stock securely fenced in. It was impossible to regulate the selective breeding of cattle and hogs if boars and bulls roamed at will impregnating sows and cows. Wild horses, too, roamed the prairies early on and these generally small former French breeds posed a danger to anyone who wanted to maintain bloodlines that would be most valuable for work, driving, and racing horses.\n\nIn timbered areas, the rail fence, also called the worm fence because of its worm-like zigzag appearance, was developed into a sturdy, animal-proof way of protecting crops and livestock alike. A properly built worm fence was said to be “horse-high, hog–tight, and bull-strong” by the pioneers. According to William Oliver writing in his handbook for prospective pioneers, Eight Months in Illinois with Information to Immigrants in 1843, developing an 80-acre farm large enough to support a family required 10,000 fence rails.\n\nRails were created by cutting down trees, and then cutting the trunks into 10-foot lengths. The resulting logs were then split into rails using wooden mauls and wooden or iron wedges. A single large tree from the first-growth timber in the region’s groves and along area creeks and rivers could often produce four relatively branch-free 10-foot logs and from 150 to 200 rails. How common were such huge trees? Quite common. The Little White School Museum in Oswego has a frame comprised of 11×11 inch oak and walnut timbers with unbroken spans of 35 feet. Clearly, the trees that produced such massive timbers had to be huge.\n\nOliver reported that cutting and splitting 100 to 150 rails was considered a good day’s work on the Illinois frontier. Legend says that Abraham Lincoln, who was for a while a professional rail splitter in his younger days, could produce between 300 and 400 rails a day.\n\nAfter splitting, the rails had to be hauled to the land to be fenced, which is one reason why, along with the wind breaks they offered, land closest to groves and other patches of timber was claimed and farmed first. After the rails were hauled to the site, they were assembled into a fence.\n\nThe most common fences were eight or nine rails high, and measured about five feet in height. The stacked rails were then strengthened with a “stake and rider” system that tied each section together. One hard-working man could fence about 200 yards a day or enclose 30 acres a week if enough rails were available.\n\nAccording to James Sheldon Barber, who arrived here in Oswego from Smyrna, New York in December 1843, about 10 acres of timber was required to supply an 80 acre farm with the necessary materials to build a house and outbuildings and supply enough rails for fencing. Early plat maps of Kendall County show many of the larger groves subdivided into small five to 10 acre plots to supply those settling the prairies with sufficient timber to get their farms up and running and to supply the firewood and repair materials to keep them running.\n\nPioneer millwrights followed closely behind the farmer-settlers, and the lumber their sawmills produced made for more efficient use of timber resources.\n\nThen along about the same time, loggers opened up the vast forests of Wisconsin and Michigan to lumber companies. Millions of board feet of sawn lumber were shipped to Chicago beginning in the early 1840s that was used for everything from board fences to commercial and residential buildings, to sidewalks everywhere west of the city on the lake.\n\nRail and board fences, of course, weren’t the only kind the pioneers tried. Some worked, and some didn’t until a couple of inventive geniuses over in DeKalb came up with the idea of how to successfully manufacture a practical barbed wire for fencing.\n\nFor instance, ditch fences were also sometimes built by cutting sod and piling the strips along the ground. Then a ditch was dug in front of the pile of sod about four feet wide and three and a half feet deep or so, with the dirt thrown up on the stack of sod. The resulting rampart created a serviceable fence that, if it didn’t keep roving livestock out, at least slowed them down. But what with northern Illinois’ annual average of about three and a half feet of rain, ditch and sod fences tended to melt back into the prairie fairly soon.\n\nSo when it was discovered the Osage Orange tree, when planted close together in hedges along field boundaries, made dense, tight, living fences enhanced by the trees’ formidable thorns, it didn’t take long for the idea to spread.\n\nJonathan Baldwin Turner , a professor at Illinois College at Jacksonville, was not only an abolitionist but was also an agricultural innovator and was also the Osage Orange’s strongest promoter. Osage Orange hedge fences were planted by Illinois farmers starting in the early 1840s and by the 1850s were the predominant fence type in the state.\n\nIn the April 12, 1855 Kendall County Courier, published at Oswego, Russell Whiting and his son, James, advertised, “Osage Orange Hedges Made. The undersigned will contract for making Hedges of the Osage Orange Plant next spring and will warrant them to make the thing for which they are designed. Also the Osage Orange Seed and Plants for sale.”\n\nHow valuable did farmers find the Osage Orange? In a letter discovered by my friend Mike Skinner, sent by Pvt. Joseph Buckley, serving in Tennessee with Company H, 89th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, back to his wife in Illinois in December 1862, Buckley promised—in the midst of the Civil War—to locate some Osage Orange seeds for a neighbor friend in Lisbon Township and send them back home.\n\nOsage Orange didn’t prove good just for hedge fences, either. Hedges have to be trimmed every year to keep them from spreading and taking farm and pasture land out of production. Settlers found the tough dense wood was perfect for wagon wheel hubs and other items that required wood that would bend but not easily break. And Osage Orange also proved to be excellent firewood. When burned, it produces more heat—32.9 million BTUs per cord—than any of 37 species on a University of Nebraska firewood testing list that also included two kinds of hickory and three of oak.\n\nBut Osage Orange grows slowly. It takes about three years for seedlings to grow into a useful hedge fence. And board fences were becoming ever more expensive.\n\nSerendipitously, it was right around this same time, in 1874 in fact, that a DeKalb farmer, Joseph Glidden, and Isaac Elwood, a DeKalb hardware dealer, patented their barbed wire fencing that proved both popular and economical. It found a ready market, not only in the tallgrass prairie states east of the Mississippi River, but became even more popular on the treeless shortgrass plains west of the river.\n\nBarbed wire, however, did require wooden fence posts, so farmers and experts at the new Midwestern land grant universities experimented on the best fence post wood. Oak and hickory, it was found, were surprisingly fragile as fence posts, tending to rot fairly quickly. No one was really surprised, however, when it was found that tough, dense Osage Orange made long-lasting posts. Best of all, existing hedges didn’t even have to be cut down—dozens of fence posts could be harvested through the normal (though often neglected) annual hedge pruning process.\n\nWhen I was a little kid living on a farm out in Wheatland Township just east of Kendall County, just about every farm had large a stack of well-cured Osage Orange fence posts cut heaven only knew how many decades previously and kept around just in case.\n\nThen in 1890, James S. Merritt of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania filed a patent for a steel or iron fence post and the era of using wood for agricultural fencing began to end. Steel posts didn’t rot and were much sturdier than even Osage Orange posts.\n\nBy the time the 20th Century dawned, the era of cattle, hogs, and sheep running at large was long behind area farms. By then fencing on the farm was used to keep livestock in, not necessarily out. Even grain fields were fenced during those years because cattle would usually be turned into fields harvested by machine to clean up any grain they missed or dropped.\n\nBut then the era of diversified farming, where a mixture of grain and livestock was grown on every farm, ended as did the need for those fences enclosing fields. So they’ve slowly been removed to allow yields to be maximized by planting right up to the farms’ property lines.\n\nAnd those hedge fences? Amazingly enough, a lot of them still exist here in Kendall County although they’re slowly disappearing, too. Now badly overgrown and untrimmed for decades, they take up acres of land that could be farmed even while providing good habitat for a variety of wildlife. Interestingly enough, these days it’s more often the developer who’s bought the farm property than the farmer who’s removing those remnant hedge fences to make room for housing and commercial developments.\n\nBut those remnant Osage Orange hedges, along with occasional badly weathered wooden fence posts still standing lonely guard along country roads, are tangible reminders of the era when good fences not only made good neighbors on the Illinois prairie, they also made good farms.\n\nIt was August 1871, and the members of the Oswego ladies Association were one happy bunch. After years of fundraising, they’d finally reached their goal.\n\nThe women had started out joining together during the Civil War to send off a variety of items, ranging from blankets to socks and gloves to Oswego solders serving in the military. They’d modified their goals after the war to raise funds to benefit the entire community. And now they were ready to celebrate their purchase for the community of its very first…hearse.\n\nAs Kendall County Record Oswego Correspondent Lorenzo Rank reported in the paper’s Aug. 31, 1871 edition: “A few more days and death will be no longer any terror; the new hearse is ready for delivery. The ladies who brought about this achievement of a free hearse through raising of moneys in fairs, socials, etc. now wish to finish their labors and enjoy the fruits of it. The greatest harmony and goodwill was maintained during the endeavor and their several years of joint labor, and it is now hoped that no jealously will spring up between them, and that the honor of its first usage may not create any envy among them.”\n\nBy 1871, the community’s undertaker was Charles Shaver. Like his predecessors, Shaver owned the village’s furniture store where he not only sold, but also made furniture. And among the things he made were coffins. Across the U.S. of that era, especially in small towns it was taken for granted that the local furniture store owner also doubled as the community’s undertaker.\n\nFurniture store owner and carpenter Thomas Greenfield was apparently Oswego’s first undertaker, operating the business in conjunction with his furniture store.\n\nAccording to the Rev. E.W. Hicks’ 1877 history of Kendall County, Greenfield arrived in Oswego in 1842. In the 1850 U.S. Census, his occupation was listed as “carpenter.”\n\nAfter the devastating Oswego fire of February, 1867 that destroyed all the businesses on the east side of Main Street between Washington and Jackson streets, Greenfield was one of the Oswego business owners who combined to build the new brick Union Block.\n\nIn a collection of framed Oswego business information and memorabilia in the collections of Oswego’s Little White School Museum, undated but probably dating to the late 860s, Greenfield advertises himself as “Thos Greenfield, dealer in Furniture. Special attention given to Undertaking.” His advertisement in the frame includes various metal furniture parts such as hinges, along with two different handles that look identical to the ornate handles illustrated on caskets of the era.\n\nIn April 1874, Greenfield traded his Oswego building, along with his furniture and undertaking business, to Charles F. Shaver in exchange for Shaver’s farm in Specie Grove along modern Minkler Road southeast of Oswego.\n\nShaver had moved into Oswego from his farm in November 1871, the Kendall County Record’s Oswego correspondent reporting on Nov. 23, 1871: “Mr. H.A. Barclay has sold his residence on Madison street to Charles F. Shaver.”\n\nShaver continued to operate his very successful furniture store in conjunction with his undertaking business, becoming well known for both. On July 27, 1887 the Record’s Oswego correspondent reported: “Perhaps there are some now that would like to have their funerals take place right away so as to get first use of the magnificent new hearse received by C.A. Shaver the other day. It is a beauty, by it the terrors of death are made all to disappear.”\n\nThen in July 1888, the Eastman family moved to Oswego from Yorkville, Mr. Eastman joining Shaver in the furniture and undertaking business. As the Record reported March 6, 1889: “Shaver and Eastman rendered the undertaker’s services at the funeral of John Carroll, near Plattville, Sunday. The body was taken to Aurora for burial in a Catholic cemetery.”\n\nAnd on May 1, 1889 the Record reported: “The funeral of Dr. C. Weirich took place Sunday afternoon from the house, conducted by Shaver & Eastman.”\n\nBy October 1890, Eastman had left the business. Then in April 1894, Shaver apparently sold the furniture and undertaking business to his son-in-law, Dr. William T. Putt. It’s possible Shaver’s business went broke like so many other businesses due to the financial Panic of 1893 a severe economic depression that resulted in the failure of every bank in Kendall County. Along with Shaver’s business, Putt also took over Levi Hall’s drug store, which he soon after sold to Scott Cutter.\n\nPutt originally partnered with John Huff to form a company with one of my all-time favorite Oswego business names: Putt & Huff Undertakers, the Record reporting on April 11, 1894: “’Putt and Huff’ makes a nice looking and nice sounding name for a firm, which is the newly established firm here for undertaking. They very efficiently carried out their first service in conducting the funeral of Mrs. Rieger.”\n\nPutt & Huff didn’t last long in the partnership business, however. The very next year, George M. Croushorn partnered with Putt, Huff apparently having left the business. The Record reported on Oct. 25, 1895: “Putt & Croushorn is now the title of the proprietorship of the furniture store and undertaking business. G.M. Croushorn bought a half interest in them.”\n\nWhen Charles Knapp built his new two-storefront brick building on the west side of Main in the middle of the block between Washington and Jackson streets, Croushorn moved the business there. The business was in the modern Masonic Hall, 71 Main Street.\n\nBesides running his downtown furniture and undertaking business, Croushorn was also a rural mail carrier, the May 29, 1907 Record explaining: “George Croushorn, the Oswego undertaker, furniture man, and rural mail carrier, was raised to the master Mason’s degree last week by Raven [Masonic] Lodge.”\n\nBy 1931, Croushorn was looking to get out of the furniture business and concentrate on the undertaking business. Along with a partner, he did it, the April 1, 1931 Record reporting from Oswego that: “George M. Croushorn and his son-in-law, J. B. Thorsen, recently opened a new funeral home in the Oliver Hebert homestead, one of Oswego’s landmarks built in 1852. They have as fine a commodious and thoroughly modern a funeral home as can be found anywhere in the country. The entire first floor is given over to service rooms and another floor to the display of funeral merchandise of all kinds. There will be a formal opening of the home on Saturday, April 11, and Sunday, April 12, when the public may come and inspect the home.”\n\nThe firm’s grand opening was a grand success, with the April 15, 1931 Record reporting: “Between three and four hundred people attended the opening of the Croushorn & Thorsen funeral home April 11-12. Mr. MacCorsin of Evanston, a traveling salesman for the National Casket company, said this funeral home would do credit to a town of 10,000 population. The former Hebert house has been redecorated inside and out and presents a very neat and appropriate appearance. One front room is reserved for funeral services, one for an office, and in other rooms caskets are on display.”\n\nUnfortunately, the elderly Croushorn didn’t live very long to enjoy the business’s new location. On July 12, 1933 the Record reported his death: “George M. Croushorn, age 79, one of the best-known men of Kendall County, died early Saturday morning, July 7, 1933. Mr. Croushorn had been in business in Oswego for more than thirty-five years, first conducting a furniture store and later an undertaking establishment, and a few years ago he converted the old Hebert stone residence into a funeral home with his son-in-law, Jake Thorsen of Leland conducted the Croushorn & Thorsen Funeral Home. Three children survive him: Mrs. Susie Roswell of Centralia, Wash., Mrs. Myrtle Thorsen of Leland, Ill, and J.R. Croushorn of Aurora; seven grandchildren, George and Mary Roswell, Virginia and Jack Thorsen, and Herbert, Warren, and Margaret Norris; two brothers, Albert of Yorkville and J.B. Croushorn of Aurora. Mrs. Croushorn died in October 1927 and a daughter, Mrs. Sadie Norris, died last March. The funeral was held from the Presbyterian church, of which Mr. Croushorn had long been an elder on July 10. Burial was in the Oswego cemetery.”\n\nAfter this date, the business was known as the Thorsen Funeral Home, as the Record noted when it reported on March 27, 1935: “The Thorsen funeral home is now equipped with ambulance service.”\n\nThe ambulance arrived too late to assist in what was undoubtedly Thorsen’s most famous—or perhaps infamous—undertaking event. When the FBI finally located the badly decomposed body of John Dillinger Gang member John “Three-Fingered Jack” Hamilton in a shallow grave just north of Oswego in 1934, the Thorsen staff was tapped to process the body. Thorsen gave the job of preparing the decayed body for burial to trainee Ron Smith. Smith later said the smell and condition of Hamilton’s body persuaded him that he needed to consider a completely different career path.\n\nJ.B. Thorsen maintained ownership of the business until October, 1938. The Record reported from Oswego on Oct. 5, 1938: “The Thorsen Funeral Home has changed ownership. Mr. Thorsen of Oswego sold the business to Mr. McKeown of Chicago. Mr. and Mrs. McKeown will live in the upstairs apartment of the establishment.”\n\nThe McKeowns continued to not only own the funeral home and mortuary business, but also continue operating the community ambulance service begun by Thorsen.\n\nWhen World War II broke out in December 1941, the McKeowns didn’t know what the future might bring. Everett was definitely of draft age and the couple didn’t have any children at the time. They found out in June 1943 when Everett, along with Oswegoans Walter Smith, Bob Ritehour, and Les Weiss were drafted. Then the question was what to do with the business. Evelyn knew how to run the business, but she was not a licensed mortician.\n\nBut on June 16, 1943 the Record reported the McKeowns’ Yorkville friends had come to their aid: “Mrs. E.M. McKeown has reached the decision to carry on the funeral home during the absence of her husband, who leaves shortly to enter the Armed Services. The decision is one that will face more and more wives as the war goes on and Mrs. McKeown is to be congratulated for “keeping the house in order” while her husband is serving his country. A licensed embalmer and director has been secured and the business will go in with the usual high type of service as in the past.” That Yorkville friend was Leonard Larson of the Larson Funeral Home.\n\nWhen the U.S. Army got Everett McKeown through basic training, they decided that with his background as a mortician, a good fit might be to train him as a medic. Which they did. And in April 1944, he shipped out for the European Theatre.\n\nThen in July 1944, Evelyn received the alarming news that Everett had been wounded during the D-Day invasion, the Record reporting on July 5: “Mrs. McKeown has received a letter from her husband, Pfc Everett McKeown, in the medical Corps, in England, that he was wounded in the invasion of France, one leg fractured by a mortar shell, after he had landed to set up their company on the continent. He is now in England in a hospital.”\n\nLittle did she know, however, that Everett’s war was far from over. After being evacuated back to England, Everett recovered, and was sent back to the front—just in time for the Battle of the Bulge.\n\nOn Dec. 26, 1945 the Record reported that Everett was back home in Oswego after his eventful military service. As the newspaper recapped his service: “Everett McKeown, who before his honorable discharge, Dec. 18, was Sgt. McKeown, a combat medic, went into service in June 1943 and was overseas for 23 months, going from England into Normandy on D Day, was wounded in the invasion, was returned to England and hospitalized for six months, then to France again, joined the 1st Division and was in the Battle of the Bulge, being in Czechoslovakia when the war ended. He has four battle stars, an invasion arrowhead, a combat medic badge, and the purple heart. The people of Oswego and vicinity could well decorate Mrs. McKeown with a medal as she has continued the business of the McKeown funeral home with the assistance of a Yorkville funeral director, Leonard M. Larson, for the duration, including ambulance service. Mr. and Mrs. McKeown went to Stronghurst to be with his mother for Christmas.”\n\nLike so many young soldiers discharged from their military service, Everett McKeown was ready to do more, both for his community and for his business. Three years after his discharge, the McKeowns decided to move their business down the street a couple blocks to more palatial quarters.\n\nOn Sept. 8, 1948 the Record noted that: “Mr. and Mrs. Everett McKeown have purchased the large residence on the corner of Madison and Tyler and expect to be located there by October 1. They will use the house as a residence and a funeral home. Mr. and Mrs. H.B. Saunders, who sold the home to Mr. and Mrs. McKeown, have moved to Warrenville.”\n\nIn a follow-up on Sept. 22, 1948 the Record reported: “Sept. 22: Mr. and Mrs. Everett McKeown and baby have moved into their new home on Madison street. Mr. McKeown’s mother, who has been here for several weeks, returned to her home in Stronghurst the first of the week.”\n\nAlong with running the ambulance business and funeral home, Everett McKeown was deeply involved with the Oswego Lions Club and as a member of the Oswego Volunteer Fire Department. He also served as the longtime treasurer of the Oswego School District. He was also, in 1956, appointed a member of the first Oswego Plan Commission and served as on the first Oswego Community Bank Board of Directors. In 1961 when the Oswego Grade School and Oswego High School districts merged into the Oswego Community Unit School District 308, Everett was elected to the board and appointed board treasurer. Meanwhile, Evelyn was a long-time fixture in the high school business office.\n\nBy the late 1960s, Everett and Evelyn McKeown were looking to wind down their busy civic and business careers in Oswego. The Feb. 22, 1968 Oswego Ledger reported that: Everett McKeown of the McKeown Funeral Home, Oswego, announced the addition of William F. Dunn to his firm. Bill is the son of Dr. and Mrs. Richard F. Dunn, Oswego. Dr. Dunn is the plant physician for Caterpillar Tractor Company. Bill attended Marmion Military Academy but graduated from Ottawa Township High School and from Worsham College of Mortuary Science. He also attended Bogan Junior College in Chicago, Aurora College, and the U.S. Armed Forces Institute. Bill moved to Oswego in December 1965 just prior to entering the U.S. Army’s Medical Corps, from which he was honorably discharged on Jan 18, 1968. A member of St. Anne’s Parish, Bill is a member of the Oswego Jaycees, a deputy coroner for Kendall County, and a licensed funeral director.”\n\nIn 1972 the McKeowns decided it was time to retire. Bill and his wife, Patricia Pearce Dunn, bought the business, including the funeral home on Madison Street. The firm’s name was changed to McKeown-Dunn in 1978, creating the current McKeown-Dunn Funeral Home. On May 3, 2010 the Dunns opened their new Dunn Family Funeral Home with Crematory at 1801 South Douglas Road in Oswego. The former Madison Street funeral home is no longer used for that purpose.\n\nAnd just within the past couple years, Oswego gained a second funeral home for the first time in history when Bauman Family Funeral Home and Cremation Services moved into their quarters on U.S. Route 34 just west of the Oswego Bridge. It’s been a long and winding road from Oswego’s first furniture dealer, carpenter and part-time undertaker Tom Greenfield, to today’s professional morticians serving the Oswego community’s bereaved. But it’s also been an interesting one, involving a fascinating piece of the Oswego area’s history.\n\nThis year marks the anniversaries of a couple of important road projects—roads that still remain major arterial routes here in Oswego and Kendall County.\n\nThe paving of modern U.S. Route 34–then designated Route 18–from Aurora via Oswego, Yorkville, and Plano and on to Princeton in western Illinois was finished 100 years ago this year. In addition, paving work on Ill. Route 25 from Aurora to the Route 34 intersection in downtown Oswego was also finally completed in 1924 after being started as a hard road demonstration project back in 1914.\n\nWhile the two highways are separate routes these days, time was that Route 25 nearly became Route 34.\n\nToday, the Route 34 Corridor is recognized as not only an engine of economic and population growth, but also one of population sprawl. For a while back in the early 2000s, Route 34 almost looked like a housing development gun aimed right at little Kendall County by densely populated counties to the east—between 1990 and 2010, Oswego Township’s population nearly tripled.\n\nThe conception of those two road projects, if not the realization of the profound effect they would eventually have on the Village of Oswego, began in the years before World War I as more and more Illinois residents, both rural and urban, began lobbying for better roads. With few exceptions, the state’s roads outside large cities—and often inside them, too—were dirt-surfaced and turned into literal mudholes after every rain or season change. As historian David Wrone put it, “With rare exceptions, the roads of Illinois in 1910 differed only in the number of miles from the roads of 1818.”\n\nThen various groups began militating for better roads, the first of which were the “wheelmen,” bicycle enthusiasts who rode the high-wheeled cycles of the 1890s. Then, with the introduction of automobiles and trucks, motorists joined the better roads call. And finally farmers did, too, grudgingly acknowledging that better roads would make it easier for them to get their livestock and crops to market and to bring back home the groceries, clothing, and other things they needed.\n\nAs the Illinois Highway Improvement Association put it following their first conference in 1912: “Improved roads mean better schools and larger attendance; better health and quicker medical attention; better farms and more cultivated land; better crops and cheaper transportation; better economic conditions and more producers; better social conditions and less isolation; better church attendance and better citizens; better postal service and closer friends; better business and more consumers; better industries and more employment; a better state and a better nation.”\n\nDuring the next several years, work on persuading Illinois residents that a system of paved roads would benefit everyone continued. Eventually, the matter was put before the voters in a November 1918 statewide referendum. The state’s local governments, along with a variety of private “good roads” organizations, including the Illinois Farm Bureau, heavily—and successfully—lobbied voters to pass the bond issue, campaigning to “Pull Illinois out of the Mud.”\n\nEven though the U.S. was deeply engaged in World War I, Illinois voters overwhelmingly approved a $60 million bond issue on Nov. 5, 1918 to build a network of concrete-surfaced highways that would be impervious to the state’s notoriously changeable weather and link every county in the state.\n\nEver more efficient, affordable, and dependable motor vehicles, from cars to trucks to buses, were available in 1918. But, as noted above, the state’s deplorable road system virtually disappeared in a sea of mud every spring and after heavy rains. The problem often prevented farm families from visiting town to sell grain and livestock and to do their shopping for weeks at a time.\n\nThe original route northern Kendall County’s hard road was to take was south from Aurora on what is today Ill. Route 25 on a section of concrete road already built as a demonstration from that city to the Waubonsie Creek bridge in Oswego. Then the route was to head south on what’s today Ill. Route 71 to Van Emmon Road. The mile of Van Emmon from modern Route 71 into downtown Yorkville had been paved in 1917 by Kendall County as another hard road demonstration project. The route was then to cross the river at Yorkville and go on west to Plano, Sandwich, and, eventually, Princeton.\n\nBut with the election of Len Small as Illinois’ new governor in 1921, business interests successfully lobbied for a straighter route from Aurora west. While Kendall County residents were looking for maximum hard road access, business interests—primarily trucking companies—were looking for efficiency, meaning a straighter, shorter route.\n\nThe new route ignored both existing stretches of paved road. Instead, the chosen right-of-way ran down modern Ill. Route 31 from Aurora to Oswego, where it continued directly west on modern Route 34 to Plano. It thereby bypassed both Oswego’s and Yorkville’s downtowns. To tamp down Kendall County’s anger–which was considerable–the state agreed to build stub highways from the new highway into both downtowns.\n\nWhat with survey and design work and right-of-way purchases, it took a few years for actual construction to begin, but by April 1924, contractors were ready to start building from Aurora west on what was then called Route 18—today’s Routes 31 and 34—and nicknamed the Cannon Ball Trail (not to be confused with the local Cannonball Trail in modern Kane and Kendall counties).\n\nThe Kendall County Record reported on April 16, 1924: “The completing of the Cannon Ball Trail between Oswego and Yorkville on the west side of the river has been started.”\n\nSince so many miles of concrete highway were being built around the region, the Record’s editor had a safety suggestion for highway officials to consider, one we pretty much take for granted these days. On April 23, he wrote “Auto drivers who are much on the roads would appreciate the placing of the black center line on cement roads. This mark comes the closest in being an accident preventative than any other one of the many suggested corrections. These black center marks might well be built into the roads when they are installed, or at the latest, placed when opened for traffic and replaced as soon as they become obliterated.”\n\nCrews completed sections of the route during the next several months, including a new overpass across the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad tracks at what was called the Wormley Crossing north of Oswego on modern Ill. Route 31. Thirty years later, Caterpillar, Inc. would locate their new, sprawling manufacturing plant near that crossing.\n\nIn addition to the Route 18 project, the state decided that since the concrete road on the east side of the river was to be extended across Waubonsie Creek into Oswego to connect with the stub running across the river from Route 18, a new bridge across the creek would be required to handle the expected increased traffic load. The old iron truss bridge across the creek had been built some decades previously. The replacement was to be a state-of-the-art concrete bridge.\n\nOn May 28, the Record’s Oswego correspondent reported: “The last section of the Cannon Ball concrete road was completed Friday. In twenty-one days it will be opened for traffic. Grading will begin at once on a road from the [Red Brick] school house to the end of the concrete road on the east side of the river. When this road is finished Oswego will be sitting on top of the world in so far as good roads can make it.” The Red Brick School was located where the Byline Bank and the Oswego Post Office are situated today.\n\nThe last section of old Route 18 west of Somonauk to Princeton wasn’t paved until the fall of 1929, but by then Kendall County residents had been enjoying use of the road east of there for five years.\n\nMeanwhile in Oswego, the hard road link with Aurora—Route 25, then called the East River Road—was completed in December 1924. As the Record’s Oswego correspondent happily noted on Dec. 10: “The concrete road on the east side of the river will be open for traffic Wednesday, Dec. 10. This is a great improvement for Oswego. The bridge across the Waubonsie creek is a beautiful piece of concrete work. Oswego is proud of this improvement and gives praise to the county and village who worked so faithfully for this beautiful bridge and highway.”\n\nAll that road construction led to a number of Kendall County transportation changes. The main one was the final closure of the interurban trolley line from Aurora through Oswego to Yorkville. The Illinois Commerce Commission allowed the line to close as long as it was replaced with bus service making use of some of those new concrete highways.\n\nAs the Record reported on Aug. 6, 1924: “Through an order from the Illinois Commerce Commission, the interurban line from the [Fox River amusement] park south of Montgomery to Yorkville will be discontinued as soon as buses are provided to take care of the traffic. This permission comes after a long battle with the commission and a period of wretched service by the street car company at this end of the line… The bus service will be started as soon as the vehicles can be procured.”\n\nIn addition, the interurban line from Yorkville to Morris also stopped service in 1924, only to be bought by a farmers’ cooperative that kept it open until 1938 when it, too, succumbed to motor vehicle competition from the newly paved Ill. Route 47.\n\nCompletion of modern Route 34 between Oswego and Naperville—then designated Route 65—had to wait almost an entire decade. Work began in February 1933 on the project, buoyed by some of Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal federal funds. The initial paving project, with the exception of the stretch crossing the Lincoln Highway (U.S. Route 30) and the Elgin, Joliet & Eastern Railway tracks a few miles east of Oswego, was finished by October 1933. The EJ&E overpass and the Route 30-Route 65 interchange weren’t finished until late in 1936, finally completing the paved highway between Naperville and Oswego.\n\nThe next year, 1937, the state changed highway routes and numbers. The old Route 34 running north from the west end of the Oswego bridge across the Fox River was renamed Ill. Route 31—its modern designation. Route 65 between Naperville and Oswego was renamed U.S. Route 34, which now bypassed Aurora all together. And with that, today’s system of highways all got their modern designations. Also, Oswego became either the origin or terminus of three state highways, Ill. Routes 31, 25, and a couple years later, 71.\n\nSo that’s how the whole Route 34 thing got its start, going from a country road linking Oswego to the east with Naperville and west to Plano and Sandwich. The road was paved in the 1920s and 1930s, allowing Oswego Township residents easier access to the burgeoning jobs market in Chicago’s near-west suburbs to the east and also offered an economically important route for livestock and grain shipments coming from the west. In the early 2000s, to handle the ever-increasing traffic load, Route 34 was four-laned between Oswego and Naperville, while stretches farther west were also four-laned between Orchard Road and Sandwich.\n\nToday, that former stretch of two-lane country highway between Oswego and Naperville is a divided four-lane economic engine dotted with shopping centers, business parks, and housing developments.\n\nAnd even though it’s a century on now, transportation improvements and modifications still seem to be the order of the day around these parts as another construction season is again upon us.\n\nI was working on the “Lost Oswego” presentation I’m scheduled to give on Saturday, May 4, at the Little White School Museum here in Oswego when I decided to include a few architectural preservation successes the community has enjoyed.\n\nThe program is mostly about the landmarks we’ve lost over the years, a process of change that began a few decades after Oswego was founded and continues to the present day. But Oswego’s architectural history isn’t all bleak; there have been a few major successes, too. Chief among those, of course, is the Little White School Museum itself. Slated for demolition in the 1970s, a grassroots community effort not only saved the landmark structure, but led to its complete restoration into the community resource and treasure it is today.\n\nWhile the Little White School Museum success was due to a private-public partnership between the not-for-profit Oswegoland Heritage Association and the Oswegoland Park District, some other Oswego landmarks have been saved by their private owners. A group of three adjoining buildings on the west side of Main Street just north of Jackson Street is a prime example of that.\n\nOriginally three separate buildings, the W.O. Parke Building, the first Oswego Community Bank, and the Durand House have been turned into a single commercial structure that enjoys a lot of community patronage.\n\nWilliam Oscar Parke built his two-story front-gabled landmark commercial building of native limestone in 1845 at the northwest corner of Main and Jackson streets.\n\nLike all of Oswego’s limestone buildings, the stone was likely quarried right in the Oswego area, which boasted a number of limestone quarries. One quarry was right behind what’s now the Oswego Public Library along Waubonsie Creek and it’s likely that’s where the stone for Parke’s building came from. Other limestone quarries were located east of the modern Ill. Route 25 bridge across Waubonsie Creek and operated by early settler Walter Loucks and on either side of Wolf’s Crossing Road just east of the original Oswego village limits, operated by Elijah Hopkins. Yet another quarry, this one specializing in flagstone of varying thicknesses, was operated by George D. Wormley on the west bank of the Fox River a couple miles upstream from Oswego. After its life as a stone quarry, the Wormley quarry property was sold to the YWCA for use as a summer camp and named Camp Quarryledge. Since those days, the parcel has had numerous owners but the old quarry, namesake of the camp, still exists.\n\nIn addition, the Parke Building was also parged. Parging consists of covering a building’s stone or wood siding with a relatively thin layer of mortar. While the mortar’s still wet, the mason doing the parging work scribes lines in it making it look as if the building is constructed of cut stone rather than the random-layed stone we see today when the parging has all fallen off or been otherwise removed.\n\nParke, a businessman and Oswego’s second postmaster, ran both his store and the post office from the building. After Parke sold the building in 1848 a number of postmasters and merchants conducted business there ranging from grocery stores, harness shops, a tinsmiths, and an auto repairs. The Oswego Post Office remained housed in the building, off and on, from the 1840s until Postmaster Lorenzo Rank moved it to the new building he erected in the middle of the block between Washington and Jackson streets in 1874.\n\nRank, who was also the long-time Oswego correspondent for the Kendall County Record and knowing community residents would probably complain about the change, wryly noted in the Record’s Aug. 4, 1874 “Oswego” news column: “The post office has been moved from the corner where it was in operation for about 19 years to the center of the block across the street. The inside arrangements of the new office are about as crooked as they could have been made. The change is not favorably regarded by the public.”\n\nAs Rank explained about Parke in the Aug. 5, 1875 Record: “W.O. Parke, or Oscar Parke as familiarly known, was in an early day one of the most energetic men and prominent merchants of this town; he was the postmaster during the administration of James K. Polk and again during a portion of that of Franklin Pierce. Intelligence of his death was received a few days ago.”\n\nOver the next several decades, the building went through several owners and just as many uses, from a grocery store to a feed mill to a harness shop. In 1901, Oswego jeweler A.P. Werve moved his jewelry store into the ground floor of the building, while he and his family lived upstairs. Werve also bought a couple pool tables in 1902 to supplement his store. And in January 1904, Werve opened a bowling alley in the building as well. Werve was apparently quite an innovator—he custom built the first automobile in Oswego in 1903.\n\nAfter Werve’s numerous uses the building was purchased by Gus Shoger and rented out for a number of uses including farm implement sales. In Sept. 1914, Fred and Clare Willis displaced the harness business in the building and moved their tinsmithing and heating business there, where they remained until Clare was called up to serve in World War I.\n\nThen in 1922, young Earl Zentmyer came down to Oswego from Aurora looking for an opportunity to open an auto repair business. As it happened, Charles Reid, who was operating the Liberty Garage in Gus Shoger’s stone building, was looking to sell. Shoger offered Zentmyer good rental terms and the deal was sealed. Zentmyer opened the village’s first Ford auto dealership there in 1929. In the early 1930s, he bought the stone building as well as the old livery stable across Main Street at the northeast corner of Main and Jackson, moving the dealership there after doing some extensive remodeling.\n\nZentmyer continued to own the building, where a number of businesses from his son, Jim’s, post World War II appliance store to the first Rucks Appliance Store to Zentmyer’s wife’s Lay-Z-Pines Driftwood Arts gift and craft store were located.\n\nZentmyer owned the building until 1970, when he sold it to Jacqueline and Ken Pickerill. The Pickerills had moved their Jacqueline Shop, an upscale women’s apparel store, there from their original location on South Main Street in 1960. In 1996, the Pickerills retired and sold the building to Greg Kaleel, who today houses the Prom Shoppe women’s clothing store in the historic structure, continuing a 170 year mercantile tradition.\n\nAs far as I can determine, no structure ever bordered the stone Parke Building to the north during the 19th Century, other than a storage shed or two. Instead, a single-family home was built a short distance north, leaving a blank space.\n\nIn 1863, James A. Durand and his family moved to Oswego from their former home at the end of modern Light Road There, Durand had been the CB&Q’s first Oswego station agent, and bought what became known as the Durand House at 19 Main Street, just a short distance north of the Parke Building.\n\nAfter they left Oswego in 1869, the house was rented to many Oswegoans including pioneer druggist Levi Hall and his new bride.\n\nOswegoan John Sanders served in the Mexican-American War in 1846. He eventually returned to Oswego and married the widow, Nancy Pearce King. The couple moved about the U.S. fairly often as Sanders engaged in businesses ranging from sliversmithing to retail merchant. They permanently returned to Oswego and bought the Durand house in 1873. Sanders progressively lost his eyesight during the next several years until he was totally blind. He died Feb. 12, 1885 and is buried in the Pearce Cemetery.\n\nDuring the next 106 years, the house experienced many owners and residents before 1991 when Lee and Bernie Moe opened the Village Grind Coffee & Tea Company, Oswego’s first dedicated gourmet coffee shop. The Moes sold the business to its current owners, Jodi and Dave Behrens, in 2004. Today, the Village Grind, which has been amalgamated into a block of storefronts with it and the Parke Building being sort of bookends, remains one of historic downtown Oswego’s most popular destinations.\n\nAnd then there’s the building in the middle that offers a connection between the Parke and Durand buildings, the first Oswego Community Bank.\n\nBanks in Oswego didn’t have a very successful history. The community’s first, a private bank, was established by Oswego druggist Levi Hall. As the Kendall County Record reported on Feb. 24, 1881: “It should have been mentioned heretofore that Oswego has made another progressive step and reached a very important business acquisition namely that of a bank. L.N. Hall in connection with his [drug] store is now doing a general banking business, and he has the best facilities for conducting it.” Hall’s store was located in the north storefront of the Union Block on the east side of Main Street between Washington and Jackson streets.\n\nUnfortunately, Hall became a victim of the Panic of 1893, one of the nation’s periodic economic depressions. The Panic was so serious that all three Kendall County banks failed during a two-week period that summer. Hall, an honest and contentious businessman, worked hard to try to pay back his depositors. The community didn’t get another bank until 1903 when the Oswego Banking Company opened. Eventually bought by the Burkhart family and turned into the Oswego State Bank, it failed during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nAfter that, it took the community nearly 30 years before they were ready to try establishing their own bank again. But local businessmen and farmers finally realized they really need a local bank. On Nov. 22, 1956, Oswego Ledger Editor Ford Lippold noted: “There is some talk about the possibility of a bank being formed in the village. This is one of the things that will be of great benefit to everyone in the community.” He followed up with this Dec. 13 note: “A public meeting is being planned for Jan. 14, 1957 to discuss the possibility of setting up a bank in Oswego, a facility that really is needed.”\n\nThe gathering turned out to be successful, Lippold reporting on Jan. 17: “A good group of Oswegoans turned out for the meeting in the Community Room Monday night to discuss the possible formation of a bank in Oswego. There was a general feeling in the group of a definite need for a bank in Oswego and a steering committee is being formed to lay the groundwork for the possible organization of a bank on a community basis.”\n\nTalks with potential corresponding banks and attorneys continued and on April 4, 1957, the Ledger reported: “G.C. Bartholomew, chairman of the organizing committee for the new Oswego bank reports that the number of necessary forms pertaining to the organization of the bank have been completed by the following organizers: Homer Brown, Dr. Sheldon Bell, John Cherry, Charles Lippincott, Myron Wormley, Earl Zentmyer and G.C. Bartholomew.”\n\nThe idea was for the new institution to be a true community bank, Lippold noting in the April 25 Ledger that “Present plans are to have the shares of stock in the new bank sell at a low cost each so that everyone will have an opportunity to be a part of the new organization. A limit will be placed on the amount of stock that any one person can own.”\n\nFrom there, plans moved forward quickly with tens of thousands of dollars being subscribed in the proposed bank by Oswego residents. Lippold was somewhat surprised at the positive attitude of so much of the community towards the new bank given the normal negativity towards just about anything new, noting on Oct. 10, 1957: “It’s been a long time since there’s been so much interest in anything in the community as there is in the new Oswego Community Bank and, for a change, the comments are mostly favorable. Oh, there are a few diehards who say it will never go, but they are the same ones who said the auto would never replace the horse. Back to the easy chairs, boys, lay down and roll over, you’re dead.”\n\nOn March 13, 1958 the Ledger reported that Oswego contractor Richard Young had broken ground on March 9 for the new bank building on Main Street just north of Jackson Street, adjacent to the Parke Building. It was hoped construction would be completed in 120 days, according to bank officials. In addition, seven local residents were elected to the bank’s first board of directors including George. C. Bartholomew, John Cherry, Myron Wormley, Sheldon Bell, Charles Lippincott, Earl J. Zentmyer, and Homer Brown.\n\nAs planned, the new 1,700 square foot building included a first floor plus a full basement. The vault, with a capacity of 1,050 safe deposit boxes, was built of 18″ thick steel reinforced concrete.\n\nThe bank opened on Aug. 30, 1958, the Ledger reporting: “Among the many features offered in this well-planned, air conditioned building are a modern vault ample teller facilities, safety deposit boxes, drive-up window, safety alarm system, day and night depository, and a customer parking lot. A spacious basement area is available for employees’ comfort and for future expansion as the Oswegoland community continues to grow.”\n\nWrote Lippold in an Aug. 28 Ledger editorial: “The opening of the doors of the new Oswego community Bank Saturday morning, Aug. 30, is another omen of the future of the Oswegoland community. A year ago, the bank was only an idea in a few people’s minds. Today, it is proof that 242 Oswegoland folks have faith in their community and are willing to back up this faith with cold, hard cash.”\n\n“It is also a good sign that the opening comes almost at the same time as our mammoth 125th anniversary Oswegorama celebration,” he continued. “With a solid past of a century and a quarter, the future can hold nothing but god for the people of the Oswegoland area.”\n\nTiny by modern banking standards, the new bank served the Oswego community for the next 13 years, but by the late 1960s it was clear the little community institution had run out of room. Through the cooperation of the Oswego School District, Oswego Township, and the Village of Oswego, four lots on the block bounded by Jackson, Monroe, Jefferson, and Madison streets—the old Red Brick School site—were rezoned, paving the way for a new bank on the corner of Madison (U.S. Route 34) and Jackson streets.\n\nGround was broken in late June 1970 for the new structure and the move from the downtown bank to the new building was completed under heavy police guard in late May 1971. Subsequently, the old bank building was sold to Ken and Jackie Pickerill, owners of the adjacent Jacqueline Shop women’s clothing store. The store quickly expanded into the bank building.\n\nAfter Greg Kaleel bought the Parke and bank buildings, as well as the Durand House, he connected all three buildings creating a single commercial block to serve customers from those seeking good food at the Village Grind in the Durant House to fine clothing in the rest of the building—one more piece of Oswego’s rich downtown architectural history.\n\nOswego’s grown a LOT during the past several years, to the point that unincorporated Boulder Hill, once several times larger than the village, can now perhaps be considered a sort of suburb. But the time was, more than a century and a half ago, Oswego actually did have a suburb, and an industrial suburb of sorts at that, bordering the village to the north.\n\nThe Fox River Valley’s pioneer millwrights, who provided some of the most vital services early pioneers required, followed closely behind the area’s first settlers. Early millers used their talents to provide food by grinding corn and wheat into flour, and also supplied building materials from their first rudimentary saw mills on the Fox River as well as on its tributary creeks.\n\nIn 1836, Merritt Clark arrived in the Oswego area—the tiny village tumbling along the brow of the ridge overlooking the Fox River was then called Hudson—and built what Kendall County’s first historian called a corn mill on the west bank of the river. The mill was located about 3/4 miles north of the village that had been laid out in 1834 by Lewis B. Judson and Levi Arnold. Judson and Arnold called their new community Hudson—probably to remind them of their home area of New York—but it was renamed Oswego in 1837 after Congress awarded the growing town its own post office.\n\nThe same year Oswego got its post office, Levi Gorton and William Wormley built a dam across the Fox River to provide water power for Clark’s mill, and Clark reportedly added a chair factory to his corn milling operation. Later that same year, however, Clark apparently sold his business, including the mill and dam, to Levi Gorton and his brother, Darwin. The Gortons, apparently unsatisfied with Clark’s rudimentary mill, started construction that year of a true grist mill on the same site. The new mill was ready for operation the following year.\n\nThen sometime prior to 1840, the Gortons sold their mill and dam to local business and property owner Nathaniel A. Rising. Rising and his partner, John Robinson, added a store to the grist mill at the west end of the dam and continued and apparently increased the business the Gortons had founded.\n\nIn 1848, apparently looking for even more opportunities, Rising and Zelolus E. Bell, who was then acting on behalf of the estate of the now-deceased Robinson, laid out the Town of Troy on a site located at the east end of the mill dam. The official plat of the new village was recorded on June 24, 1848 at the Kendall County Courthouse, then located in Oswego. County voters had agreed to relocate the county seat from Yorkville to Oswego in 1845.\n\nRising and Bell located Troy just far enough north of Oswego that the boundaries of the two towns never really touched each other, even after Walter Loucks’ addition to Oswego was platted sometime after 1860.\n\nAs laid out, Troy was bounded by Summit Street (now Ill. Route 25 and North Madison Street) to the east and the Fox River to the west. As originally numbered, the village consisted of Blocks 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 18, 19, 20, and 21. Blocks 1–4 were apparently never platted, perhaps being saved for future expansion.\n\nFull blocks measured 280.5’ (17 rods) square and were divided into eight lots bisected by two 16.5’ wide alleys running at right angles. As it turned out, only Blocks 9 and 7 were fully lotted, with Block 10 consisting only of Lots 1 and 8; Block 6 remaining totally unlotted; Block 5 containing Lots 1, 2, 3, and 4; Block 21 containing Lots 1 and 2; Block 20 containing only Lots 1, 2, 3,and 4; Block 19 containing Lots 1 and 2 (each as large as two regular lots; and Block 18 containing Lots 1, 2, and 3.\n\nWater Street (now North Adams Street) divided Blocks 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 from the riverfront Blocks of 18, 19, 20, and 21.\n\nConnecting Summit Street with the Fox River were (from north to south) First Street, Second Street, and Main Street. Third Street connected Summit Street with Water Street but apparently did not go all the way through to the riverbank as did the other streets.\n\nAs platted, and just like the lots in the Village of Oswego, each standard lot was 66’ (four rods) wide by 132’ (eight rods) deep.\n\nExceptions were the riverfront lots, which varied considerably in depth, and Lots 1 and 8 in Block 10. Lot 1 was 132 feet deep but was only 53.5 feet wide at its west end, narrowing to just 40 feet of frontage on Summit Street. Lot 8 was 66 feet wide on Water Street, but narrowed to 55.5 feet on the alley at its east border. Exactly why this was remains one of local history’s mysteries.\n\nStreets platted by Rising and Bell varied in width from 60 to 70 feet. As platted First, Second, and Third streets were 60 feet wide, while Main and Water streets were 70 feet in width.\n\nBesides laying out the village of Troy, Rising and the Robinson estate also added a sawmill at the east end of their dam to compliment the gristmill at the west end of the dam. It was located on Lots 1 and 2 of Block 19 in Troy.\n\nIn 1852, Rising sold the mills, dam, store and all other parts of Troy that remained unsold to William O. Parker. Parker had been born in Canada in 1828 and moved to Illinois with his family in 1836. In 1851, Parker moved to Oswego, purchasing the Rising milling operation and the rest of Troy just a year later. And with the sale, the milling operations on both sides of the river became collectively known locally as Parker’s Mills.\n\nFive years later, in February of 1857, an exceptionally severe spring freshet—flood—occurred and destroyed Parker’s east bank sawmill and the dam, and damaged the grist mill on the west bank. Although Parker suffered damages of $3,000, a considerable sum in 1857, especially since a devastating financial depression was about to hit, he rebuilt the sawmill and dam and repaired the gristmill and store. And his businesses "
