        "text": "THE AUTHOR\n\nC. W. Torrence was born in St. Marys, Ohio, Nov. 14, 1871, and attended school at New Bremen, and Wapakoneta, Ohio. From the latter of which he was graduated May 18th, 1888 standing second in his class. In 1880 he moved with his family to Wapakoneta, Ohio. After his graduation from the public schools he served a year or two in his father's office of County Auditor and enrolled for a course in the Ohio University at Columbus, Ohio, from which he graduated with honors two years later. There followed a five years service in the Peoples National Bank of Wapakoneta, as Teller and confidential advisor to the President of that institution. He severed his connection with the bank two years later, to accept a position with the Union Pacific Coal Company in Hanna, Wyoming, as cashier and pay master of that institution, which position he filled for three years. During the time he was employed by that company, he met and married Eva R. Bostwick, making his home in Hanna, Wyoming. To this union one child, whom they named Koneta, was born. He left Hanna to accept a managerial position with the Dayton Brass and Cornice Company in Dayton, Ohio. Two years later he was called to Cincinnati, Ohio, to fill a position in the offices of the Breese Bros. Co. He entered the Masonic fraternity during the year 1896, joining Hamer Lodge No. 167 of Wapakoneta, Ohio in which he held his membership until the year 1917 when he demitted to Ely Lodge No. 29. He entered the Grand Lodge of Nevada in the year 1924, ten years later he was appointed Grand Historian by Grand Master H. R. Amens, and at once started to gather data for the history of the constituent lodges of the Jurisdiction of Nevada. The task was finished in 1941. The illustrations appearing in the book are from the collection of Past Masters Herman Davis and W. M. David who kindly loaned their volume of views collected during their terms as Grand Masters. Other views were taken by Chas. D. Gallagher or were furnished by the lodges as named. In 1939 Mr. Torrence joined Reno Consistory No. 1 A. A. S. Rite. In 1942 he was elected Worthy Grand Patron O. E. S. In 1943 he joined Kerak Temple A. A. O. N. M. S. He is also a member of St. Marys Chapter, Royal Arch Masons, which he joined in 1896. Always interested in writing, and a profound student of Masonic lore, his devotion to the cause of Masonry makes him an outstanding member of the Craft, and a logical person to write the History of the constituent lodges of Nevada, which is hereby submitted for your criticism.\n\nPROLOGUE MASONIC RAMBLES IN NEVADA\n\nNevada: \"Home of the sage and the pine,\" of sand covered plains, of rugged sun-kissed hills and mountains, a state of mystery and charm. Buried 'neath its desert sands, and hidden in its canyons, the bones of hundreds lie, victims to the lure of its hidden wealth, and only the Great Architect of the Universe knows through what untold years its magic call has beckoned and enticed the adventurer with the lure of its mystic trails. Remains of a long forgotten people have been uncovered by the geologist or their activities traced in pictured writings on bluffs, which ages ago were smoothed by erosive action of wind and sand. A race of beings who may have been strong and powerful, long before Noah launched his ark, long before the pyramids were built, or before the Ming dynasty of the flowery kingdom laid claim to power and prestige.plg1But, though Nevada has witchery and allurement, she has long since yielded to the spell of the white man's magic. Down her dim trails, first came the pioneer; the rumble of his prairie schooner disturbing the primeval silence of a rock bound wilderness, and widening the trail made by the hurrying fret of countless red men. For years, in an unbroken stream, this tide swept on, into the golden west, or, loitering by the side of trickling streams, gambled with the elements or diced with mother nature in quest of fickle fortune. Then came the locomotive, its shrieking whistle and clanging bell issuing a challenge to the howling defiance of the wolf and coyote, bearings its burden of humanity to distant fields, lured by the hope or promise of a golden hoard. Today, motor cars and rumbling trucks flash over broad smooth roads, which were once dangerous wagon trails infested by prowling denizens of the mountains and plains, where traveling caravans were beset and harassed by cunning, blood thirsty Indians. High in the azure blue of the skies, the airplane roars its savage song, an evidence of mans inventive genius, an emblem of man's progression. From its dizzy height, it passes over mute evidences of decay, a deserted mining shaft, a decaying mill, where once the tide of golden fortune ebbed and flowed. It passes high above a town, whose once populous streets are overgrown with sage or mesquite bush, whose sagging roofs and battered walls are mute attestants to the remorseless hand of time, and the fickle tide of fortune. A town whose grandeur is gone, whose hum of industry has long since been silenced, and whose treasure is seemingly exhausted. And there are many such in Nevada. And yet, Nevada remains, and probably always will remain, a land of mystery and magic. Man may dynamite her mountains, he may pan her streams and rivers for its gold, he may bridge her chasms and build his cities, but he cannot chain that charm which lies in her mountains and hills; he cannot overcome the lure that haunts her ancient trails, nor can he silence the ceaseless echo of those spirit voices which sigh among the pine and balsam, and whisper her derision and contempt for his futile attempt to conquer her.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe following historical manuscript, prepared by D. E. W. Williamson, was presented and read before the sixty-sixth annual Communication of the Grand Lodge of Nevada, Free and Accepted Masons of Nevada, convened in the city of Reno, in the Masonic Temple, on the 12th day of June, 1930. It was published in the Annual Proceedings of that year, and is produced here in full. The text follows:\n\nMORMONS AND MASONRY IN NEVADA\n\nIn speaking of the old town of Genoa in this state several months ago, the editor of the Carson Appeal said that the first gathering of Masons ever held in Nevada took place there, but inquiry as to his sources of information led to nothing definite, because the man who had told him, a former postmaster of Carson City, had long been dead. If any meeting of so-called Masons occurred at Genoa, it must have been a gathering of those who first saw the light in Illinois in lodges that on October 7, 1844, were declared by the Grand Lodge of Illinois to be clandestine. The first known informal meeting of Masons in Nevada of which there is any note took place in Virginia City in 1860. (Proceedings of G. L. of Nevada, 1928, Report of History Committee.)plg2But the fact that a meeting of clandestine Masons may have taken place at Genoa, which prior to the survey of Orson Hyde in 1855 was known as Mormon Station and was settled by Mormons almost exclusively, makes the relations of Mormons to Masonry in general and the attitude of Masonry in Nevada toward Mormons of especial interest to the Fraternity. Some of those Mormons, under a ruling of the Grand Lodge of Illinois in 1846, may even have been Masons in good standing, since little attention was then paid to non-payment of dues, and few if any jurisdictions required documentary evidence or a card such as now is demanded.\n\nI.\n\nThere is no denying that most of the Mormons who came West from Nauvoo in 1847 had been made Masons in what were at the time regularly constituted lodges. On October 15, 1841, a dispensation was issued by Grand Master Jones of the Grand Lodge of Illinois for the organization of a Masonic Lodge at Nauvoo in that state and the lodge was set to work on March 15, 1842 (Goodwin, \"Mormonism and Masonry\" 4.) Quite a number of the Mormons had been raised in New York and Ohio. The dispensation was suspended on August 11, 1842, but was restored in November, 1842, on the recommendation of a Grand Lodge Committee which found that the chief irregularity had been collective balloting, and two more lodges were granted dispensations in Nauvoo, while one at Montrose, Ill., was given a charter as Rising Sun Lodge, No. 12, and a dispensation was given another in Keokuk. All these were strictly Mormon lodges and they continued to work, virtually unchallenged, until the Grand Lodge convened in October, 1843, when the charter of Rising Sun Lodge, No. 12, was suspended and the dispensations recalled from Nauvoo, Helm and Nye lodges in Nauvoo and Keokuk Lodge, all on the grounds of irregular work, of concealing their records and of disregarding Grand Lodge instructions and resolutions. (Op. cit. ch. v., p. 36.) The lodges involved paid not the slightest attention to Grand Lodge orders, but continued to work as before, refusing to surrender their books and papers. They even went so far as officially to dedicate the Masonic Hall at Nauvoo on April 5, 1844, with Masonic ceremonies, although at that time they really had no existence as lodges, whatever, under the ruling of the Grand Lodge. Five hundred and fifty men, called Masons in the report of the proceedings, attended. The Grand Lodge of Illinois apparently did not know what to do about such behavior and it was not until its annual communication in 1846 that it at last took drastic action. It adopted a resolution declaring that the suspension of a subordinate Lodge by the Grand Lodge only affects the standing of its individual members so far as they participate in disregarding the edicts of the Grand Lodge after the first information thereof coming to their knowledge and providing such individuals by their act shall not have been the cause of the action of the Grand Lodge declaring such lodge suspended or clandestine. (Op. cit. ch. vi.,p.40,note.) It is said that Joseph Smith, founder of Mormonism, was still claimed to be a Mason at the time of his murder by a mob, and it is quite possible to believe that many Mormons, who took little active part in the lodges, imagined that they were still Masons three years later on coming West. Even John Doyle Lee, the leader of the Danites, who conducted the Mountain Meadow massacre in 1857, when he and his men murdered a band of 120 emigrants from Arkansas, laid claim to being a Mason and seemed quite sincere about it. In his confessions, published in 1905 under the title of \"The Mormon Menace,\" this man, who was found guilty and paid the penalty of death in 1877 for his part in the massacre, tells of a meeting in Tennessee where he preached. He says: \"I had just commenced speaking when one of the men began to swear and use indecent language and made a rush for me with his fist drawn. I made a Masonic sign of distress, when to my relief and yet to my surprise, a planter pushed to my aid. He took the drunken men and led them out of the crowd and then sat by me during the rest of the sermon, thus giving me full protection. That man was a stranger to me but he was a good man and a true Mason.\" (P. 169.) After the killing of Joseph Smith the Mormons remained on at Nauvoo until March, 1846, when they began the westward march that led to the settlement of Utah and the establishment of Salt Lake City.\n\nII.\n\nReturning to the subject of Genoa, Mormon Station was founded by a small party of Mormons in June, 1850, who had a band of cattle and in addition sold supplies to the emigrants to California who passed along the Carson Valley on their way West, but these people did not remain and in the spring of 1851 John Reese and Stephen Kinsey with a larger number of Mormons, reoccupied the station, taking formal possession on July 4 of that year. (Thompson and West, \"History of Nevada.\") They formed quite a settlement and established fine farms in the neighborhood. Three years later, Orson Hyde, president of the apostles of the Mormon Church at Salt Lake City, was appointed probate judge of the newly formed Carson County, of which Genoa was the principal settlement, and led a party of seventy families who settled in and around Genoa and in the southern part of what is now Washoe county. Hyde, who was a close friend of Joseph Smith in Nauvoo and who had acted as missionary in England successfully, was one of the leaders in Mormonism and there cannot be the slightest doubt that he was a member of one of the Masonic Lodges at Nauvoo, for nearly every able-bodied Mormon belonged. With him was Enoch Reese, another active leader, and in his party were men known as Richard Bentley, Russell Kelly, William Nixson, Charles Loveland, Permins Jackman, Seth Dustin and others who afterwards were active in Salt Lake City. At the first election the county officers were all Mormons. It was not altogether a bed of roses for them and Orson Hyde was busy with fulminations against the Gentiles from time to time. The miners of the territory could not understand why anyone should try to apply Mormon rules to them and they laughed at Hyde's efforts to introduce the Mormon taxes under the name of tithes. By 1856 there were as many Gentiles as there were Mormons and at one time there was almost a pitched battle between Gentiles and Mormons, but Orson Hyde called the latter off. Properly to understand the feelings of Masons toward the Mormons in Nevada later, it is necessary to understand that this was only three years before the discovery of the Comstock Lode. The efforts to enforce Mormonism on Gentiles left their mark and about this time other causes increased the hostility of most Americans against the followers of Brigham Young. The records of the United States Court at Salt Lake City were burned and a federal judge was driven out of Utah by the Mormons and finally the intention of Brigham Young to fight the United States became so plain that the President sent General Albert Sydney Johnston with United States troops to Utah to maintain order. Brigham Young took alarm and issued an order to all Mormons in California and Nevada to return at once to Salt Lake City. They obeyed, sacrificing their property for whatever it would bring. P. J. Sessions led the first Mormon train of twenty-one families, which left Eagle Valley on July 16, 1857, and on September 5 another urgent message came by express which was followed by an exodus of 450 persons. Genoa was reduced to a small village, while the Washoe Valley was almost depopulated. (Stenhome, \"The Rocky Mountain Saints,\" pp. 284, 285.) It is proper to say that some of the Mormon settlers refused to return to Utah and remained in Nevada, where they became fine citizens. Brigham Young's clashes with the federal authorities lasted for months and were notorious throughout the United States, both Republican and Democratic parties in their national conventions denouncing the Mormons, and President Buchanan calling attention in a message to Congress to their defiant attitude toward the laws of the country. Times have changed since then and last year the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Nevada approved a ruling of the Most Worshipful Grand Master that he could see no reason why a Mormon, otherwise qualified should not be made a Mason. But in 1866 the Mormons were distinctly regarded with suspicion by all with whom they came into contact. Proof existed that Brigham Young was hostile in the early years of the Civil war to the Union side and that he hoped for the success of the Confederacy. Besides this, emigrants from the East and Middle West told many stories of the unpleasant way in which they were treated while crossing Utah. In addition to these facts, disclosures of what occurred in the endowment house at Salt Lake City incensed Masons, who felt that the mysteries of Masonry were being profaned. For instance, in one of the grips of the so-called Melchizedek priesthood in the Mormon church, the colloquy is: \"What is this\" \"The second grip of the Melchizedek priesthood, patriarchal grip or sure sign of the nail.\" \"Has it a name?\" \"It has.\" \"Will you give it to me?\" \"I cannot, for I have not yet received it.\" ... \"You shall receive it through the five points of fellowship through the veil. These are foot to foot, breast to breast, hand to back, and mouth to ear.\" (Quoted by Goodwin, \"Mormonism and Masonry,\" P. 59.) Understanding the ill regard in which Mormons and their faith were held, it is possible to comprehend the remarks of Grand Master Joseph DeBell, at the communication of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Nevada on September 18, 1866. Brother DeBell reported issuing a dispensation for the organization of Mount Moriah lodge in Salt Lake City and said that, when this lodge has been opened and had begun work, the question was submitted to him of how Mormons were to be created who claim to be Masons and ask the privilege of visiting. In issuing the dispensation, he said, he had required a pledge that the petitioners should carefully exclude all persons of the Mormon faith. \"The general character of the Mormon people,\" Brother DeBell declared, \"as it comes to us through the various channels of information, is of such a nature as should forbid their entrance into our fraternity. In answer to the question from Mount Moriah lodge, he replied: \"One known to be living in the daily violation of what is known as the proprieties and decencies of life, setting at naught the moral law as laid down in that Great Light that is ever open on our altars, should by the same rule be excluded from our assemblies. Therefore you will take notice that Mormons, claiming to be Masons, be excluded from the right of visiting; and also that petitions for the degrees of Masonry shall not be received from any person who is known to be a Mormon.\" The committee to which the grand master's address was referred reported fully concurring in his views and adding: \"The man who is not true to his government and faithful to the laws of his country is unworthy the name of Mason and should not be admitted into the great Masonic family.\" Mount Moriah lodge of Salt Lake objected to the ruling, holding that it should be the best judge of whom it should admit to the lodge as visitors or members. The communication of 1867 of the Grand Lodge, therefore, refused to grant a charter and directed that demits be sent to the members. Mount Moriah lodge subsequently obtained a charter from Kansas, which for a time caused some friction between the Grand Lodge of Nevada and that of Kansas, but the Salt Lake lodge changed its views and in Utah now a Mormon is not regarded as eligible to become a Mason. In practice a Mormon is not admitted to a lodge in several other jurisdictions, although they have no printed rules on the subject. (Editor's note - the above was correct at the time of printing of this book - 1944 - but has since changed; a Mormon - or a man of any faith - may now be admitted to a Utah - or any other - Masonic Lodge.) The question of admission of Mormons to the Masonic bodies in Nevada remained without discussion in the form in which it had been decided by Brother DeBell until the communication of the Grand Lodge in 1913, when it was again brought up by representatives from the eastern part of the state. At that time arguments for and against the views of Brother DeBell were offered but no action was taken and the ruling remained undisturbed until it was set aside last year.\n\nIt has been said, \"The West would not be the West, were it not for the Covered Wagon of Pioneer Days.\" In like manner we might assert that Nevada would not be Nevada, were it not for Carson Valley and the trails which led to the Comstock through the fertile meadows which skirted the Carson River, and the roads which wound their treacherous way over Kingsbury, or down jumbo grades, and by the many devious paths over the rugged hills and mountains which flank the country in which is located Carson City, Capital of the Sagebrush State, and the birthplace of the first Masonic Lodge in Nevada. It has been a much discussed question among the later generations of the fraternity, why Masonry in Nevada should have first found sanctuary in Carson City instead of Virginia City, which, by reason at that time of its greater population and its firmly established mining industry, as well as for its greater number of sojourning Masons, had outdistanced Carson City, and might on that account have been entitled to the honor of having in its midst, the first unit of Masonry to be established in the territory of Nevada, besides which, it is historically certain that the first meeting of a Masonic nature held in Nevada was held in Virginia City in the early summer of 1860, on the occasion of the funeral of Brother Edw. Paris Storey, a captain in the U. S. Army, who was killed in an engagement with the Pah-Ute Indians June 2, 1860. This information is corroborated in a letter received from Brother W. A. VanBokkelen, who served as M. W. Grand Master of Nevada Masons in the year of 1872, and who was thoroughly familiar with Masonic developments in the state. Just why the meeting in Virginia City referred to by Past Grand Master VanBokkelen did not culminate in the establishing of a lodge in Virginia City, Masonic records fail to disclose, for it is known to have been presided over by M. W. Wm. H. Howard, a Past Grand Master from California, who afterward became the first sheriff of Storey County, Nevada. This brother is said to have been an unusually zealous Mason, having performed active Masonic service in various sections of the United States. That he was held in high esteem by the brothers of Virginia City is evidenced by the fact that he was the leading spirit in the formation of the first Masonic lodge in Virginia City on January 15, 1863, which was at first named in his honor but afterwards was changed to Virginia Lodge No. 3. However, the zealous Mason, having performed active Masonic service in various sections of the United States. That he was held in high esteem by the brothers of Virginia City is evidenced by the fact that he was the leading spirit in the formation of the first Masonic lodge in Virginia City on January 15, 1863, which was at first named in his honor, but afterwards was changed to Virginia Lodge No. 3. however, the brethren in Carson City had felt the urge to build Masonically, and had set in motion the machinery which should eventually bring them to a realization of their cherished hopes.\n\nNevada at this time numbered among its population many Masons of unquestionable zeal who had come across the California border from sections where Masonry had been firmly established after order had been created from chaotic conditions which followed the Gold Rush of 1849. Strengthened by the fraternal support of these brethren, the Masons who had previously found their way into Carson Valley and settled there, met during the early part of January 1862, \"to formulate plans for the establishment of a Masonic lodge.\" It is said that the movement had its inception as the result of a call for assistance from a member of a storm bound immigrant band en route to the Pacific Coast, who, in her extremity, requested of other members of the band, that they summon relief and aid from any sojourning members of the Masonic fraternity residing in Carson. The Call went out at once, and immediate response was made by the brethren in Carson. It is stated, that among the Masons living in the town were Brothers R. B. Ellis and J. H. Wayman, both physicians, who attended the sick traveler, administering necessary medical aid, and arranged for other attention in the way of supplying food, clothing and medicine. As a result of this incident, the brethren at Carson City were aroused to the necessity of establishing a unit of Masonry in Carson for the practice of Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth, not only for the benefit of their own members, but for the assistance of worthy brethren in need of aid, who might pass through Carson City on their way to the new El Dorado at Virginia City lying at the base of Sun Peak Mountain which held the wealth of the·Comstock Lode in its embrace. The first authentic record made of the outcome of the determination of the brethren of Carson City to establish lodge in their midst, is reflected in the account of a meeting held on the evening of February 13, 1862, when Brother M. D. Larrow presented a dispensation signed by the M. W. Grand Master of California, granting authority to fifteen brethren to establish a lodge of F. & A. Masons in Carson City under dispensation, to be known as Carson Lodge No. 154, and naming M. D. Larrow, Worshipful Master, Phillip Stoner, Sen. Warden, and R. B. Ellis, J.W. The dispensation was officially granted by the Grand Lodge of California February 3, 1862. The records of Carson Lodge disclose the names of the following brethren named in the dispensation, viz; Brothers M. D. Larrow, Phillip Stoner, F. A. Tritle, F. W. Peters, W. C. Phillips, Seymour Pixley, D. L. Brittan, R. B. Ellis, I. H. Wayman, H. Armer, Wellington Steward, W. R. King, Henry Rice, Abraham Curry, and Henry Grice, men who were prominent in the professional and commercial affairs of Carson City at that time.\n\nIt is said that the meeting called for the purpose of receiving the dispensation was held in the upper part of the T. G. Smith building, known as Smith Hall, located north of the State Capitol building being a frame structure over what is now (1944) Heiden's Garage. On the old visitors' record under date of February 27, 1862, appears the name of Samuel L. Clemens -- known best to American literature as \"Mark Twain,\" who registered from Polar Star Lodge No. 99 of Missouri, and who paid his first visit to Carson Lodge on that date, subsequent visits were made to Carson lodge by the rising young author, who at that time was connected with the Territorial Enterprise, a weekly newspaper published in Virginia City. That Brother Clemens was an ardent Mason is evidenced also by the appearance of his name upon the Tyler's register of Esmeralda Lodge No. 170 at Aurora, Nevada, when that famous old silver camp was in its prime, during which period he was a resident of the town for several months. He is also known to have visited the lodge at Virginia City, Gold Hill, and Silver City, while residing at Virginia. The records of Carson lodge show that Brother Clemens paid dues to the amount of $1.50 upon one occasion, the payment being in the nature of a donation from a visiting, sojourning brother, rather than payment as a member of the lodge. For some unaccountable reason not readily understood at this remote time, a considerable period of time elapsed before mention is made on the records of the new lodge, of the installation of its first officers. Unfortunately, the records of the California G. L. are not available, and just when the Grand Lodge met in the year of 1862 is not definitely known to the Nevada brethren; however, it was about the middle of May of that year, if the charter issued Carson City lodge was issued under authority, at the Annual Communication, for on May 15 of that year, a charter was granted Carson Lodge and it was numbered No. 154 on the roster of California lodges. This charter named Marcus D. Larrow, Worshipful Master, Edward J. Smith, S. W., and Henry Rice, J. W. Arrangements were at once made to receive the charter and its distinguished bearer on May 29 of the same year, on which date the ceremony of constituting the lodge and installing its officers was performed by Brother John S. Van Dyke, as Deputy Grand Master, acting under authority of Most Worshipful Wm. C. Belcher, Grand Master of the California Jurisdiction. At this meeting Brother M. D. Larrow, who was also named W. M. of the lodge under dispensation, but who had never been installed into office, was inducted into the oriental chair of K. S. by a convocation of Past Masters, and received the Past Master's degree. In the meantime, a new superstructure is said to have been added to the building in which the lodge met, and in this structure, conveniently and comfortably outfitted to accommodate the brethren, Carson lodge continued to expand, performing its work and spreading Masonic light. It was in this hall too, that the first public installation of officers was held on the evening of December 27, 1862, presided over by Past Grand Master William H. Howard, of the California jurisdiction. It is noted in the minutes of December 18, 1862, that Brother Blasdel, afterward elected governor of Nevada, presented a petition to Carson lodge, signed by twenty-one brethren from Virginia City, asking permission to organize a lodge at that place. Brother Blasdel vouched for the integrity, fitness, and qualification of the petitioners and the request was graciously granted, resulting in authority being granted by the Grand Lodge of California to organize Howard Lodge of Virginia City, U. D., which afterwards became Virginia Lodge No. 162. The year 1862 was a particularly busy one for Carson lodge. As an example of the work it was called upon to perform, the records of the meeting of February 20 of that year, state that seven petitions for the degrees were received besides three applications for affiliation. There were fourteen members present upon the occasion besides twenty-seven visiting brethren. This condition continued throughout the entire year, with the result that at the beginning of 1863, a splendid membership was enrolled upon the roster of the lodge, while peace and harmony prevailed among the brethren. The selection of Carson City as the location for the first Masonic lodge in Nevada created some unlooked for situations in Masonry on Nevada soil. In the first place, Nevada had not yet been admitted to statehood. Masonically, it was under the jurisdiction of California, and so, with no Grand Lodge in the territory to direct its destinies, and the parent Grand body, while not inaccessible was, nevertheless, inconveniently placed to be hurriedly communicated with, and so the contention has been made, perhaps deservedly so, that Carson lodge exercised some of the prerogatives of a Grand lodge. Reference is more particularly made to its tendency to exercise its prerogative in granting permission for other lodges to be organized in the Territory, in close proximity to its charter. For instance, Washoe Lodge No. 157 was required to ask permission of Carson Lodge before its petition to organize under dispensation was granted by the Grand Lodge of California. The same was true of Silver Star Lodge No. 165 of Gold Hill, Nevada, approval to organize being twice asked for from Carson lodge, before being granted. Escurial Lodge No. 171, at Virginia City; also requested permission from Carson lodge to organize before its petition to the Grand Lodge of California was granted, and from way over in Lander county, Nevada, the brethren of Austin Lodge No. 172 framed a request to Carson lodge, asking permission to organize before authority was finally received from the Grand Lodge of California, and the dispensation issued. However, it is not to be assumed that in receiving these acknowledgments of its authority Carson lodge was assuming prerogatives not due it, nor levying tribute where tribute was not due. Being the first lodge to be organized in the Territory of Nevada, it held certain territorial jurisdiction under its Charter, by reason of which it might if it chose, prevent the establishment of any other lodges aspiring to organize in the territory from which it drew its membership; and so the several lodges mentioned which asked permission to organize in its territory, were only observing an established precedent and extending Masonic courtesy to Carson lodge, at the same time obeying Masonic law by so doing. And so, in seeming to adopt some of the prerogatives of a Grand Lodge, as it has been claimed, Carson lodge in no way usurped the authority of the parent Grand Lodge, nor assumed privileges belonging to that body. It posed, rather, in the capacity of an advisory institution, if at all, deferring to the Grand Lodge of California those questions of law and jurisprudence which might occasionally be brought up, and these occasions were remarkably rare, so on the whole there has never been any justification of the claim that Carson lodge took over some of the privileges of a Grand Lodge, for if it ever acted, even in an advisory manner, it was always with due deference to the Grand lodge under which it was chartered, and with no claim to authority as an individual unit of Masonry. During the early months of the existence of Carson lodge, owing to the necessity of outfitting its quarters, and the added expense of placing them in order and repair for the comfortable reception of its members, visitors and initiates, the lodge incurred debts amounting to over $1,200.00. Repeated efforts were made to raise the money to liquidate this indebtedness but with no tangible results. By the beginning of the year 1863, the brethren were most deeply concerned because of their inability to free the lodge from its encumbrances, and so levied an assessment of $10.00 per member to assist in reducing their indebtedness. This assessment, together with a donation amounting to $125.00, assisted materially in relieving the situation and eventually clearing the books of all indebtedness. Along with its financial troubles, Carson lodge is said to have experienced some difficulty in maintaining harmony among some of its members. The Civil War, then in progress between the North and South, was the agent of much bitter feeling between the supporters of both contending factions. In this part of the country were found many Southern sympathizers, who openly voiced their sentiments, antagonizing the citizens who came from north of the Mason and Dixon line. This antagonism culminated at times in physical encounters, and apparently crept into Carson lodge, for we find in the minutes of July 17, 1862, that a committee was appointed to investigate charges of secessionism which had been filed against certain members of the lodge; however, at a later meeting, held some time in August of the same year, the committee so appointed reported it was unable to sustain the charges, and they were withdrawn. Subsequent differences the same year between some of the members were voluntarily aired in the lodge, but under the pacifying efforts of the W. M. and his wardens, these difficulties were adjusted, and brotherly love prevailed. In evidence whereof, it is recorded that at a later meeting that year, several petitions for membership were received, and all were referred for investigation to one committee. Again, at the annual election of officers in December, 1854, to serve for the ensuing year, the officers were declared elected unanimously, indicating that peace and harmony prevailed among the brethren. During all this period of its existence, Carson lodge had remained domiciled in Smith's Hall which it had occupied since the date it received its authority from the Grand Lodge of California, to organize under dispensation, February 13, 1862, but with the liquidation of its debts and the dawning of a new era of prosperity and advancement, new and more commodious quarters were desired and it was decided to find a new home. Since a new building recently completed and owned by a brother named Kline was available and met their requirements,the lodge removed to the new location. Several attempts were made to purchase this building, but without success. On October 24, 1864, Carson lodge received an invitation from the brethren at Genoa, Nevada, to lay the corner stone of a proposed Masonic Temple at that place. The records of the lodge however do not reveal that the lodge participated in these ceremonies. In this connection may we quote from an article written by Past Grand records says: \"It is interesting to note that a dispensation to organize at Genoa was not granted until February 22, 1868, while in the history of Nevada it states the lodge occupied the upper story of the County building for some time. We cannot reconcile the discrepancy as to time.\" It is to be assumed, however, that the brethren performed this service. It must likewise be supposed that the Temple at Genoa was ready for occupancy when the lodge was granted its dispensation, and was duly instituted in that building. As the year 1864 drew to a close, it is recorded that during the two years and more that the lodge had been in existence, frequent discussion had come upon the floor of the lodge in reference to the advisability of organizing a Grand Lodge of Nevada, but no definite action had ever been taken, the movement lacking leadership. But, in other sections of Nevada, notably at Virginia City, the project had been often discussed, and had been weighed from every angle. Accordingly, early in December, 1864, a communication was framed by Virginia City lodge and sent out to the lodges in Nevada operating under a California charter, inviting them to meet in Virginia City on January 15, 1865, and continue in session until the purpose of the meeting should be accomplished, namely, the formation of a Grand Lodge of Nevada. This invitation was read in Carson lodge on the evening of December 15, 1864, and finding no opposition, was approved and accepted, and arrangements were made to attend the meeting. On January 17, the lodges represented at the communication, surrendered their California charters, and received new charters signed by the newly elected officers of the Grand Lodge of Nevada. In the distribution the brethren at Carson were enrolled on the Grand Lodge roster as Carson Lodge No. One. As might be supposed, the creation of a Masonic lodge at Carson City, being so far removed from the parent jurisdiction, and denied the privilege of holding Masonic intercourse with brethren who were versed in recent rulings of Grand Lodge bodies, and alive to customary practices in vogue in other lodges, led to some unusual practices and developments in lodge procedure. For instance, it is claimed, that following the death of President Lincoln, Carson City decided to pay tribute to his memory on the day of his burial, in Washington, D. C. To this end, factories were to be shut down for the day, business and public houses closed, private homes and business houses appropriately draped in mourning, a funeral procession to form and march through the town, and a funeral oration to be delivered. In keeping with this decision, and in honor to the martyred President, the lodge called a meeting to arrange for proper representation upon this occasion, and decided to march in the funeral procession in full regalia, and in customary funeral formation. Accordingly on the day set for the observances, the lodge met, and opened a Grand Lodge in ample form, with a representative attendance of duly deputized Grand Lodge officers. The procession was headed by the Grand Bible, and Grand standard bearers, and all station and altar emblems of the Grand Lodge were appropriately draped. This action of the lodge was duly reported and approved by the Grand Lodge at its next annual communication. Reviewing the annals of Free Masonry in Nevada it becomes apparent that the greatest strides Carson lodge had made were between the years immediately following the close of the Civil War, and up to and including the Centennial year 1876. It was during this period that Carson lodge alludes to its own progress as the \"Golden age of No. One.\" Times and conditions were ripe to usher in such an era. The mines of the Comstock were then at the peak of their fabulous production, and Carson City was the gateway through which passed a mighty throng to woo the fickle goddess of chance, or to engage in the more stable marts of industry, and in the passage of those whose ultimate Mecca was Virginia City, Carson City reaped its harvest, and prospered accordingly. But it was more than a mere record of prosperity which brought wealth and industry to Carson, through which all classes, sects, denominations and societies benefited. It was a record of indomitable energy and perseverance which separated the dress from the gold, and in Masonic circles, built up a membership which not only had its influence upon the destinies of the little city, but manifested itself in the affairs and policies of the state as the years sped by. At numerous times and places Carson lodge was called upon to participate in the activities of city, county and state. As a particular instance of this, mention is made of the laying of the corner stone of the State Capitol, this ceremony taking place on June 9, 1870, under the supervision of the Grand Lodge of Nevada, presided over by Most Worshipful Grand Master George W. Hopkins, assisted by Deputy Grand Master George Robinson, and the entire corps of elective and appointive Grand Lodge officers. De Witt Clinton Commandery, Knights Templar acted as escort to the Grand Lodge, and a large procession included civic, military and fraternal societies. The Grand Marshal of the procession was Bro. Fred H. Tritle, while the principal speaker of the day was Robert H. Taylor, Grand Orator of the Grand Lodge F. & A. M. of Nevada. It is also interesting to note that Carson lodge has been host to the Grand Lodge of Nevada at its Annual Communications upon numerous occasions, extending its good cheer and broad hospitality so generously that there is always the desire to \"come again\" and bask in the fellowship of this splendid unit of Masonry. The history of Masonry in Carson City would be incomplete without mention of the meeting arranged by the brethren to constitute a \"Lodge of Perfection,\" which was effected through the efforts of Deputy Inspector H. I. Hoskins, 32nd Deg. for Nevada. The brethren met in the Senate Chamber of the Capitol, it having been graciously tendered by the State authorities, as the Masonic Hall was occupied by another fraternity. The brethren of the Rose Croix from Virginia City assisted in the ceremonies. Prominent among the new membership appears the names of Chas. E. Laughton and Norris D. Chamberlain. Brother Laughton afterwards became Lieutenant Governor of Nevada and earned the name of \"fiddlin' Governor,\" it developing that he carried his violin on his political campaigns, and \"fiddled\" his way into the good graces of his followers. Trenmore Coffin, whose name ranks high on the roster of Masonry, became a member of the Carson Lodge of Perfection in February, 1875. In 1904, he became Grand Orator of all the Bodies of the Scottish Rite in Reno. Under date of March 25, 1875, the \"Official Bulletin\" states that Capitolium Chapter of Rose Croix was constituted at Masonic Hall in Carson City by Henry S. Hopkins, \"with all the grand and imposing ceremonies of this most ancient fraternity.\" Glancing through the rolls of Carson Lodge No. One, we find the names of many Masons who took a leading part in the affairs of Nevada while it was still a territory, and continued their activities when it was admitted to statehood. Succeeding registrations reflect the names of many Masons who later became prominent in the social, religious, and political affairs. To follow the lives of these substantial citizens, would be to uncover activities concerning which volumes might be written, and would reveal characters of sterling worth, and fixed integrity. As a sanctuary for such individuals, Carson lodge has become famous in Masonic annals, and has established an enviable reputation among the brethren in Nevada.\n\nThe history of Washoe Lodge begins in the winter of 1860-61, and is cast in that period of glamour and excitement, attendant upon the discovery and development of the Comstock lode, dating from January 28, 1859, when James Finney, or \"Old Virginia,\" made a rich strike in Gold Hill, and Henry Comstock, Patrick McLaughlin, Peter O'Reilly, Emanuel Penrod and Kentuck Osborne came into the picture, and Sandy Bowers and his wife Eilley Orrum, rose to opulence, whose reckless extravagance and final relapse into almost poverty, is a story of human pity and interest. The story of the blueblack clay, secret of the wealth of the Comstock, at first cursed by the miners and thrown upon the dump as worthless, but afterward by an accident found to contain $1595.00 in silver, and $4790.00 in gold values per ton, precipitating a \"rush,\" the scenes and excitement of which no pen could hope to portray, for they are deep dyed with the richest color of comedy, pathos and tragedy, acts of heroism, self-denial, intrigue, shame and honor, but inextricably interwoven into the history of Washoe County. For when the great discovery was made on Mt. Davidson, or Sun Peak Mountain, Washoe Valley leaped into prominence for it had fuel and timber for building, plenty of water and fine rich land for farming; and from it the Comstock could be and was supplied. It soon assumed importance and following the necessary location surveys made in the spring of 1861, Washoe City came into being, began to grow and for the next five or six years, enjoyed a substantial and steady expansion. In 1866 it became the county seat of Washoe county. With the coming of the V. & T. Railway, the decline commenced. Reno wanted the county seat, and on August 5, 1868, a petition signed by 750 residents of Reno was sent to the County commissioners asking for the removal of the County seat to Reno. This petition was denied, but another was framed and sent in February 1870. Washoe City made a protest, and sent William Webster and William Boardman to plead their case, while Thomas E. Hayden appeared for Reno. The petition was withdrawn, but another was soon presented. On June 14, 1870, a special election was called to decide the issue. Reno won by a vote of 544 to 362. Washoe then applied to the courts for redress, resulting in a bill being sent to the legislature which was passed, declaring Reno to be the County seat on and after April 3, 1871. It was the doom of the valley city, an early exodus of many of the residents followed, business became stagnant and, while for the next 18 years or more, a settlement continued to exist on the old site of the town, yet its progressive spirit was broken, and one by one its citizens departed to other fields.\n\nIt was prior to this period that the urge for Masonic intercourse in Washoe City was felt by the sojourning brethren, resulting in the establishment of a lodge under California registry. It is inconceivable, but it is nevertheless true, that but small attention was paid by the officers of the Grand Lodge of California, to the organization of Washoe lodge, No. 157 chartered under California register in July, 1862. Two reasons have been assigned for this regrettable neglect. One, Washoe lodge was far removed from the confines of California and the distance to be traveled to assist in its organization and institution led through undeveloped territory and across treacherous mountain trails with lurking danger ever present, and weary unmarked miles and hours demanding days of hardship and toil and privation ahead if the trip should be attempted. Two, it was the second year of the Civil War, the country was in the throes of political and sectional excitement; the attention of the states was focused on the bitter contest, and the sympathies of a harassed people were centered on the faction whose cause and opinions they had espoused. It was natural therefore, that in the excitement of the moment, the importance of properly recording the events of the founding and final establishment of Washoe lodge, No. 157, should be overlooked and utterly neglected, for such was the case. The actual records are almost nil in reference to who was responsible for originating the movement and about the only reference obtainable is from the journal of proceedings of the Grand Lodge for the year it was authorized to organize under dispensation, the names of its first officers, and a list of its membership at the conclusion of its first year of existence. A meagre record upon which to erect a historical structure, but nevertheless, a foundation upon which was constructed a unit of Masonry which flourished during the period of its existence, and grew to be a commanding agent in the fraternal affairs of the Sagebrush state, springing into existence, as previously stated at the time when the blood of the mining world was at red heat due to the discovery of fabulous ore deposits over on the slopes of Sun Peak Mountain, and the rush of excited men and women to this new El Dorado of Nevada. It witnessed from afar all the romance and glamour incident to the development of a new mining district, and absorbed some of the benefits resulting from the creating of wealth, for the resources of Washoe City and surrounding territory were called upon to contribute to the building of the mining center on the Comstock, and in the resultant distribution of wealth, Washoe lodge profited, not so much financially, but rather because there was brought to Washoe city, through commercial and industrial relations, men of means, ability, and fraternal impulse, who eventually became associated with and finally enrolled on the roster of the lodge, and became a forceful part of its existence. The incidents leading to the establishment of Masonry in Washoe city were similar to those noted in the organization of other Masonic units developed in Nevada at that time. Realization came in response to an urge for Masonic contact with the brethren in a home where the landmarks of the Order might be properly observed, and the practices of the craft might find indulgence in a hall of their own. Unlike many of the early Nevada lodges, the intention to organize was productive of almost instant results, functioning in a series of gatherings called to formulate plans for an immediate organization of the brethren to operate under dispensation. The feasibility of forming a Masonic association to function until a larger charter list could be assembled was considered and is hinted at in a later journal of proceedings of the Grand Lodge, but this possibility of Masonic organization was discouraged, and a petition was framed to the Grand Lodge of California, asking permission to organize U. D. Favorably considered, the prayer of the petitioners was answered, and on July 25, 1862, the dispensation was granted by Wm. C. Belcher, M. W. G. M. of California, naming Geo. W. Brown as W. M., R. R. Johnson as Senior Warden, and Thomas B. Prince as Junior Warden. The following is a list of Master Masons of Washoe lodge, reflected in the proceedings of the Grand lodge of California of 1863 at the close of its first year of existence. Geo. W. Brown, Geo. C. Cabot, L. D. Chillson, Horace Countryman, A. M. Davidson, Henry A. Gaston, D. T. Gloyd, J. N. M. Haddick, H. M. Holden, R. R. Johnson, P. Keyes, J. K. Lovejoy, Thomas Parker, T. B. Prince, T. A. Read, Henry S. Smith, A. W. Stowe, P. E. Shannon. Fellow Crafts-W. F. Everett and Geo. W. Lameroux. Withdrew--David Lowe, and W. D. McFarland. Quarters for housing the new lodge were obtained in the upper story of a building occupied by Mears and Knickhead as a mercantile establishment, which, having been appropriately furnished, were in readiness to welcome the distinguished Masons who assembled on the Saturday next preceding the full moon in July, 1862, to open the new lodge, and witness the installation of its officers. (Ed. note - with the meeting day specified as it was, Washoe 157 was a \"Lunar Lodge - meeting near the full moon, that its members might have sufficient light to make the trip to and from the Lodge in safety.) Brethren from Virginia City were present in large numbers to assist the distinguished officers and brethren. A fine banquet preceded the opening of the lodge, and the installing of officers. For the next ten months Washoe lodge continued to function agreeable to the wishes of its sponsors, and the desire of the Grand Lodge of California. So well did it merit the approbation of that Grand Body, that on May 15, 1863, it was moved to authorize a charter to be issued, naming D. J. Gloyd, W. M.; Geo. W. Brown, Senior Warden; James H. Sturtevant, Junior Warden; P. E. Shannon, Secretary; H. W. Stowe, Treasurer; R. R. Johnson, Senior Deacon; J. K. Lovejoy, Junior Deacon. It is interesting to note, that at that time Washoe lodge had an enrollment of 36 members. Not an unusual numerical list it is true, but among its number were those who were nevertheless sincere and devoted brethren, through whose instrumentalities the lodge grew and spread its Masonic light; men who figured prominently in municipal, county, and state affairs, and brought fame and honor to themselves and the section from which they hailed; some of whom afterward crossed over into California, becoming identified with its commercial, industrial, political, and social life, adding luster to the honor roll of that state. For, the Masons who pioneered the way in Washoe lodge were men of outstanding merit and integrity; they took a leading part not only in Masonic affairs, but in public life as well; some of them attained not only public honor, but also became wealthy. Prominent among those who gained renown in the political field, was Thomas A. Read, elected first County Commissioner of Washoe county, serving with credit to his constituents, and honor to himself. Thomas B. Prince was another member who earned the confidence of the voters of Washoe county, and served them through two different sessions of the legislature. James B. Sturtevant, also prominent in Masonry, and said to have been one of the first to place farming on a secure and profitable basis in Washoe Valley, represented his county in the legislature, and made a name for himself, by reason of his honesty, fairness and forceful argument on the floor of the House. He afterwards removed to California, where he is said to have become a leader, and whose son became a Justice of the Supreme Court of that state. Henry W. Brady was another member of Washoe lodge who became prominent in Masonic circles. He served as Worshipful Master of Washoe lodge for three terms. He was Master of Washoe lodge when the lodges of Nevada met in Virginia City to organize the Grand Lodge of Nevada, and had the honor of presiding over the first lodge opened at the formation of the Grand Lodge of Nevada, and with the organization of that Grand Body became its first Senior Grand Warden, acting as installing officer of the first Grand Lodge officers. P. E. Shannon, who served as Secretary of Washoe Lodge, was a man of recognized ability, not only in his lodge, but throughout Washoe County. He became Clerk of Washoe County, in which office he served with rare ability. Later he was elected County Recorder, where he once more demonstrated his ability and willingness to serve his constituents with that marked deference and good will which always characterized his association with the public. P. E. Shannon was for many years Secretary of Washoe Lodge. He was also a veteran of the Mexican War, serving in the 2nd Regiment N.Y. Volunteers, at the storming of the Castle Chapultepek at the City of Mexico. In this same company was David E. Scannell, Chief of San Francisco Fire Department, who served his company as a lieutenant. Brother Shannon was also a member of the Masonic Veterans' Association of the Pacific Coast. He died November 27, 1895. Henry A. Gaston, a charter member,and active in the affairs of Washoe lodge, was likewise a distinguished attorney and prominent in the affairs of Washoe County, as was Fred D. Stadtmuller, who joined the lodge in 1864, afterwards withdrawing and affiliating with Carson Lodge at Carson City. Later he removed to San Francisco, and engaged in business where he died about 1891. George Robinson, then in the prime of an active business career, also affiliated with Washoe Lodge, filling the various chairs, and serving the lodge as a true and tried Mason. His efficiency and capability was soon recognized by the Grand Lodge of Nevada, with which he became actively associated, and which he served as Most Worshipful Grand Master for two terms 1870-1871. These are but a few of the members of Washoe lodge who brought honor to that lodge and credit to the Order in Nevada. It was truly a remarkable roll, still, they were only a part and parcel of those remarkable men and Masons who built largely and well in Nevada, and constructed a foundation upon which succeeding generations have continued to build a super-structure which shall endure as long as Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth shall be practiced. The question of organizing a Grand Lodge of Nevada had long been considered, and attempts had been made upon various occasions to bring the question to issue; during the year 1863 Washoe lodge assumed the responsibility of bringing the constituent lodges of Nevada into convention for the purpose of effecting the long sought for organization and sent out invitations to the seven lodges of Nevada with that object in view. An objection was raised that Nevada was not a state, and that it was not desirable nor provident to organize a Grand Lodge under territorial administration; also that as the number of lodges was small, the question should be held in abeyance. In November, 1861, after Nevada had been admitted to statehood the subject was again renewed. Referring to the minutes of Washoe lodge of December 10, 1864; a resolution from Virginia and Escurial lodges, inviting the lodge to send delegates to Virginia City to meet January 15, 1865, to the organization of a Grand Lodge was read and the invitation unanimously accepted. On January 17, 1865, Washoe lodge withdrew from the California Jurisdiction, and united with seven other lodges to form the Grand Lodge of Nevada. At that time there were 35 Master Masons, four Fellow Crafts, and four Entered Apprentices on its membership rolls. Five Master Masons had withdrawn, and two had been suspended for non-payment of dues. Today, wild grass and sagebrush grow where once stood the Valley City of Washoe. The old Masonic meeting place, its weather-beaten and crumbling sides and curling shingles, mute evidence of the devastating hand of Time, is all that remain of a once thriving and industrious little city. Sunken foundations, overgrown with the dust and erosion of the years mark the place where were once substantial buildings and commodious business blocks stood, for in the days of its affluence Washoe City was a town of some 2500 people, with good sized business houses, hotels, boarding houses, church, and school, and a fine brick courthouse which was built at a cost of between $25,000 and $30,000. It also supported a weekly newspaper, \"The Washoe Times,\" published and established by G. W. Derickson, who was later killed in a controversy by Horace F. Swazey. The publication then passed into the hands of General Allen, an uncle of Derickson, who continued the publication during the affluent days of the town. Business men came to Washoe City from many points on the Coast, and the commercial affairs of the town multiplied rapidly, for Washoe City was also the center of a wealthy farming district, and the surrounding hills were covered with a growth of virgin balsam and pine. From a thousand mountain rills came a flow of crystal water to quench the thirsty and to water the soil; resources which contributed to the comforts of the city and the valley, but which also were commercialized and brought wealth and increase to the people. The old building which housed the brethren of Washoe Lodge continued as a landmark for many years after the town had passed into decrepitude, but it too, finally went the way of all things perishable. Its decaying walls are all that is left of its one time stability. The lodge surrendered its Charter in 1888 and the brethren drifted to other localities. During the years of affluence and prosperity, Washoe lodge became a favorite sanctuary at which the brethren of the lodges at Virginia City and Carson City would gather to exchange fraternal greetings, and enjoy the hospitality of the brethren of the Valley city lodge. It is regrettable that the original Tyler's register of the lodge was not preserved, for it undoubtedly would have disclosed the names of many distinguished Masons who were identified with the affairs of the district, either as residents or investors and whose habit it was to foregather with the brethren of No. 2 at their special invitation or when prompted through fraternal impulse to visit at regular or stated meetings. For Wm. H. Howard, Jno. C. Currie, Bro. Ellis, Capt. Edw. Faris Storey, W. A. VanBokkelen, Joseph DeBell, Wm. A. Stewart, and many others took an active and important part in Masonic affairs during the peak of Washoe lodge prosperity and are said to have been consistent visitors and attendants at Masonic gatherings held in the district. It is also more than possible that Samuel Clemens' (Mark Twain) name also appeared upon the old Tyler's register of this lodge, for during the time he was employed upon the \"Territorial Enterprise\" of Virginia City, he paid frequent visits to, and enjoyed working with the lodges at Virginia City, Gold Hill, Silver City and Carson City. With the decline of commercial and industrial activities in Washoe City. Masonry languished, and eventually it became impossible to hold meetings due to no quorum present. On several occasions Washoe lodge attempted to remove to Reno, but on each occasion, Grand Lodge denied the request, with the result that on March 25, 1888, the brethren voted to surrender the charter and on June 12 of that year the lodge was declared extinct.\n\nThe history of Nevada mining begins with the invasion of territory by a band of Mormons sent out by Brigham Young in early months of the year 1850 to effect a settlement in the country adjacent to the Truckee river and on the Trail which wound its tortuous course across the rugged slopes of the Sierra mountains in California. After days of harassing experiences and heartbreaking adventures they penetrated the Valley of the Truckee, and made camp, the location afterwards becoming known as Ragtown. From this base they gradually extended their operations, some penetrating the adjacent hills and mountains in search of gold, others selecting promising locations along the grass-covered banks of the river where they eventually developed valuable agricultural tracts. Those who ventured into the mountains soon decided that the rocky slopes were barren of mineral values and turned their attention to the mountain streams in the hope that they might be successfully panned for gold. After days of discouraging search they reached a spot near which the present town of Dayton is located, and entered the mouth of what they named \"Gold Canyon\" where the first recorded discovery of gold in Nevada was made. The amount of gold panned was negligible, but with dogged persistency characteristic of their sect, they continued to pan only miserly returns, for months unmindful of the fabulous wealth which lay just ahead of them, beneath the windswept slopes of Sun Peak mountain, which, within the next decade was to astound the mining world with its richness, and from whose subterranean depths would issue a flow of wealth, compared to which the yield from the fabled mines of Solomon, King of Israel, would be a mere pittance. The years passed by; occasionally the monotony of their existence was relieved by the arrival of other caravans, pushing westward. The little band of placer miners in Gold Canyon had been augmented by other arrivals and quite a settlement had now been established at that point. But by far, most of the travelers trekking along the trail, wended their way up the steep canyon, sometimes stopping for the night at the foot of Sun Peak mountain at the spot where later huge mining enterprises were to be established, and where a sizeable city should be founded and where in a day in June, 1859, Peter O'Reilly and Patrick McLaughlin cleaned their first rocker of rich ore, which topped the deposits of the fabulous Ophir mine; and where, on the same day, Henry Paige Comstock came riding by, and, sensing the value of the discovery, fraudulently claimed all rights to the ground by reason of previous purchase, and made his claim good. He later formed a company to work the claims, including Peter O'Reilly, Patrick McLaughlin, Emanuel Penrod, Kentuck Osborne and James Finney, or Old Virginia, and gave to this and surrounding district, the name \"The Comstock Lode,\" a name to be conjured with in mining history, embracing a district which would become the arena of gigantic civic and industrial activities; the spot from which would develop fierce personal and commercial strife, involving millions in capital, creating Napoleons of finance and developing mental and physical giants among whom loom the names of Wm. A. Stewart, afterwards to become U. S. Senator, Philip Deidesheimer, who developed a method of timbering which came into universal use in western mines and made possible the working of soft ground in high stopes. Adolph Sutro was also a developed product of the Comstock whose bulldog persistency completed the Sutro tunnel in spite of financial and political antagonism, which project not only drained the mines of the district, but also became a means for their ventilation, and, upon one occasion, an agent through which food and supplies were conveyed to the starving inhabitants of Virginia City who were snowbound and buried in gigantic drifts and cut off from communication with the outside world. To this district also came Wm. Sharon, W. C. Ralston, D. O. Mills and Alvinza Hayward, to become prominently allied with the commercial, industrial and financial activities of the camp. The Comstock was also responsible for the development of Jno. P. Jones, shrewd politician and financier, who was later elected U. S. Senator from Nevada. The list is long, and wealth, fame and honor came to many who cast their lot and fortune here. Later came John W. Mackay, James Graham Fair, Wm. S. O'Brien, and James C. Flood, destined to rule the Comstock and become its Bonanza Kings; to coax fabulous riches from its depths, and establish immense fortunes, portions of which, as in the case of the Mackay riches, would be set aside for the purpose of contributing to the education of the youth of our state with the endowment of the Mackay School of Mines at the Nevada State University. The wealth of the other bonanza kings found outlet in commercial enterprises, giving employment to thousands, and contributing to the convenience of professional and industrial pursuits.\n\nThe romantic and glamorous story of the Comstock is replete with experiences, adventures and situations sufficient in themselves to induce thrills in the most sedate, arouse the interest and attention of the most taciturn and phlegmatic, and quicken the pulses of those who are susceptible to excitement. While volumes have been written recording the history of this unusual district, penned by such notables as Dan DeQuille, Charles Howard Shinn, Mark Twain, Rollen M. Daggett and Bret Harte, contemporaneous with the growth and development of the Comstock lode, or compiled by authors who in after years devoted months and years to the collection of data for their manuscripts, yet the story of the Comstock has never been completely told, for there is left to the imagination, the real picture of hardship incident to the first months of promotion, the subsequent subjection of the elements, heat and cold, as during the first summer and hard winter when they threatened to depopulate the district, and almost succeeded; but when these forces were overcome, and the breast of Sun Peak yielded up its treasure, there remains to be sensed the thrill of amassing and helping to amass wealth; the departure from the old mode of living - and the resorting to metropolitan and cosmopolitan airs. And, when the final touches had been given to the structural units which made the composite city, the canyon streets sounded to the din of commercial activity, the gulches echoed to the confusion incident to the mining of fabulously rich ore, and an era of prodigality was ushered in unparalleled in the history of any mining camp, and the world looked on in amazement - these are some of the things to be conjured with as we recall the story of the Comstock, for they give us a new slant on those times and people who promoted and developed what was preeminently the greatest mining district the world has ever known.\n\nAnd so, as the mining history of Nevada was born in territory adjacent to the wind swept slopes of Sun Peak Mountain, and was developed in the fabulously rich bonanza mines of the Comstock, resulting in the founding of new mining camps in the adjoining district, so in like manner Masonry was cradled in the same district and found sanctuary in Gold Hill, Silver City, Dayton and Virginia City. Keeping pace with the development of the metal industry of the district and eventually becoming a factor which aided in shaping the destiny of individuals, Masonry exerted its moral and refining influences on municipal, county and state affairs long before Nevada was admitted to statehood. Although the first unit of Masonry in the Territory of Nevada was not established in Virginia City, yet it is historically true that the first Masonic gathering in the state was held in that thriving camp in June, 1860, and was called to observe Masonic funeral rites over the body of Capt. Edw. F. Storey, killed in an engagement with hostile Indians, near Pyramid Lake, to which reference has been previously made. Many notables were present at this meeting, prominent among whom was Wm. Henry Howard, Past Grand Secretary of the Grand Lodge of Louisiana, and a Past Grand Master from California, who was selected to preside over the meeting, and who is said to have pronounced the funeral oration. An old time resident of Virginia City, who later became a member of Virginia City Lodge No. 162, was authority, before his death, for the statement that following the funeral services, Masonic matters were discussed by the brethren which contemplated the establishment of a lodge in Virginia City and the acquiring of suitable quarters in which to house the lodge. Although this after-meeting stimulated interest in Masonry in the district, it was nevertheless productive of no immediate results. In the meantime the brethren in Carson City had become active, resulting in the organization of Carson lodge No. 154 under California jurisdiction, and having the honor of being the first unit of Masonry to be established on Nevada soil. However, interest in Masonry in Virginia City had not languished. The organization of the lodge in Carson City served as a stimulus to further activity and not only aroused the resident Masons of Virginia City to action, but was the instrument whereby sojourning Masons living in Gold Hill and Silver City felt the urge to organize in their respective communities to spread Masonic light. The movement in Silver City was started in the early months of 1863, meetings of sojourning brethren being called, to formulate plans for the purpose of organizing and to arrange for suitable quarters in which to perform their Masonic work. The brethren at Gold Hill were led in their undertaking by Bro. Charles E. Ollney and Duane L. Bliss, while Silver City Masons accepted the leadership of Brother J. C. Currie, and in Virginia City Brother William H. Howard, a Past Grand Master from California, but at that time a resident of the premier mining camp in Nevada, was responsible for the inauguration of the movement to found a Masonic unit in that place. However sincere and anxious the brethren in this district may have been to spread Masonic light, a dissenting factor gradually intruded upon their plans, a factor born of sectional animosity induced by the Civil War then in progress between the North and the South, and represented in this section of Nevada by scores of sympathizers who had come from both sides of the Mason and Dixon line, to cast their lot and find pastime in this unique mining center. From various publications dealing with the history of the Comstock lode, it appears that there was unusual bitterness manifested among the adherents of both the Northern and Southern factions in Virginia City at that time. The Union sympathizers maintained no established headquarters in the town, the whole community being their field of operations, and their following was represented by the majority of the citizens of Virginia City, among whom were found many Masons. The Secessionists, however, most of whom were of prominent Southern families, had, by either a tacit understanding or mutual agreement congregated at the Virginia House, the leading hotel in Virginia City, and there maintained recognized headquarters. Prominent among those domiciled at that hotel were Judge Reardon, Frank Herford, Frank Denver, Judge Raeborn, and Charles Fairfax, the latter a native of the State of Virginia, and the recognized leader of the Southern sympathizers in Virginia City. Wm. Henry Howard was also a frequent guest of the Virginia House and, being a native of Tennessee, and for many years a resident of Louisiana, had imbibed many of the customs and beliefs of the South, and was an acknowledged supporter of the Confederate cause. His southern sympathies therefore weaned him from the confidence of those northern factionists who were members of the Masonic fraternity, and although Bro. Howard was foremost in the movement to organize a Masonic lodge in Virginia City, and through his endeavors Virginia lodge No. 162 was finally chartered, yet it has been assumed by some that his southern sympathies were instrumental in depriving him of the honor of having the lodge bear his name, although it was originally intended that this honor should go to him. Whether this is so or not, and there is no authentic record to sustain such contention, it is nevertheless true, but likewise inexplicable, that when the Grand Lodge of California issued a charter to the brethren at Virginia City to organize under dispensation, the wishes of the brethren of Virginia City were ignored, and the charter was issued to the brethren of Virginia Lodge No. 162 instead of Howard Lodge No. 162. The authority granting permission to organize under dispensation was issued January 15, 1863, under the hand of Grand Master William C. Belcher, and the Grand Lodge of California on May 24th, 1863, issued to them a charter, with the following officers and members: William H. Howard, Worshipful Master; Joseph DeBell, Senior Warden; James Z. Kelley, Junior Warden; James Bolan, Treasurer; Charles M. Cornell, Secretary; Hypolite Hugnet, Senior Deacon; Ferdinand Waiter, Junior Deacon; A. S. Olini, Marshal; T. M. Adams and Columbus Walker, Stewards; and John Doyle, Tyler, together with the following Master Masons: Joseph Barnett, Isaac C. Rateman, Harver Beckwith, S. A. Chapin, Orman Crandall, Lewis Goodwin, I. Heilshorn, Charles Tones, Isaac Kraimer, Charles Lintott, Samuel Lubeck, Julius Marsh, W. B. May, W. F. Meyers, Reuben J. Mitchell, John A. Paxton, L. Rawlings, Charles Rawson, Hugh M. Reed, L. Reynolds, F. S. Rising, Richard Rising, John W. Stattler, Samuel Symons, Levi W. Taylor, and Walter Winn. The following Entered Apprentices were also named in the charter: E. W. Adams, , Rufus E. Arrick, Allen M. Cole, Stephen T. Gage, D. M. Hanson, Charles L. Strong and J. Warner. The receipt of the charter by the brethren at Virginia City, brought with it expressions of disappointment, dissatisfaction, and disapproval of the action of the Grand Lodge of California in its refusal to honor Brother Howard by naming the new Masonic unit for him; but he very graciously accepted their decision and pointed out to the brethren of the lodge, that while their wishes had not been gratified in the bestowal of a name for the new unit, and he had not been honored by having the lodge named for him, yet he had after all, been honored during the period of his incumbency as Grand Master of California, by having had Howard Lodge No. 96 of Yreka, Calif., bear his name, and too, he felt that he had been signally honored by being named as the first worshipful master of Virginia Lodge 162; he asked that the brethren accept the situation with good grace, and that a true Masonic spirit might prevail. That Brother Howard had believed that the new lodge would bear his name, and that he had been informed of the wishes and intentions of the brethren long before the charter was issued, and received by the brethren is evident, because upon the occasion of the instituting of the lodge, he presented them a complete set of officers jewels, which were wrought from native silver taken from the Comstock lode, and beautifully engraved with the name, \"Howard Lodge\" on each jewel. This set is said to have cost Brother Howard the sum of five hundred dollars. Brother Howard continued his activities not only in Virginia Lodge, but throughout the district, attending and working with the various lodges in that section of Nevada. To him may be accorded the honor of having been instrumental in effecting the organization of the Grand Lodge of Nevada which met in Virginia City in 1865. He died in 1866, a few hours before the second annual convention of the Grand Lodge was convened; his body was borne to the lodge room in which the convention was to be held, and lay in state while the Grand Body assembled, when Grand Honors were paid the distinguished brother. The funeral oration was pronounced by Bro. Jos. DeBell. Bro. DeBell was assisted in the funeral services by Bro. J. C. Currie, who from that time on until his death, was prominent in Grand Lodge affairs, and who became Grand Master of Nevada Masons in 1860, and was re-elected again in 1867. He was master of his own lodge for ten years, and was mayor of Virginia City at the time of the great fire in 1875, and became chairman of the restoration committee appointed to take charge of reconstruction, following the fire. Later he withdrew from his lodge, and united with Virginia City Lodge. Urged to intensive action by the accomplishments of the brethren at Virginia City, sojourning Masons living in Silver City, under guidance of Bro. J. M. Currie, expressed their desire to organize a lodge, by framing a petition to the Grand Lodge of California in the early months of 1863, asking authority to organize under dispensation, permission having previously been asked from Carson Lodge No. One, to organize in territory controlled by the latter lodge. Carson Lodge assented, and on March 20, 1863, authority was granted the brethren at Silver City, to establish a lodge under dispensation, naming J. M. Currie, W. M.; T. M. Henry, S.W., and W. B. Hickok, J. W. With the institution of the lodge, and the installing of its officers, the lodge entered upon an intensive year of service, and added a fine membership to its original roll. On May 15, 1865, it was officially chartered, with its first officers appointed in the dispensation again named to guide its destinies. In addition thereto, August Koneman was named Treasurer, Henry Warnold, Secretary; James Cowden S. D.; Moses T. Burke, J. D.; Henry Lux, Tyler. In its first report to the Grand Lodge of California eleven members were reported in good standing. With the organization of the Grand Lodge of Nevada, it was chartered as Amity Lodge No. 4 upon Nevada Roster, with the following officers in charge: Richard T. Mullard, W. M.; James M. Kennedy, S. W., and W. J. Burke, J. W. Brother Mullard was the last master under California jurisdiction; he became Deputy Grand Master of Nevada Masons in 1868. With the arousing of Masonic interest in both Silver City, and Virginia City, Masons in Gold Hill in the meantime had become aroused to the desirability of forming a Masonic unit in their own locality, and on the 11th of April, 1863, Wm. G. Alban, R. R. Barnes, Levi W. Lee, M. Frankenheimer, Lewis B. Frankel, Sigmund Ettinger, A. C. Hollingshead, Hugh McLeod, Henry Donnelly, N. A. H. Ball, Robert Webber, Charles E. Olney, Duane Bliss, Samuel Robinson, and H. H. Veasy framed a petition to the Grand Lodge of California asking permission to establish a lodge at Gold Hill. On the 20th of June, 1863, the document for which they petitioned was issued, and on July 1lth the dispensation was delivered, and W. G. Alban was installed Worshipful Master; E. R. Barnes, Senior Warden; L. W. Lee, Junior Warden; S. H. Robinson, Treasurer; S. Ettinger, Secretary; L. B. Frankel, Senior Deacon; A. C. Hollingshead, Junior Deacon; H. McLeod and M. Frankenheimer, Stewards; H. N. Veasy, Tyler. On the 13th day of October, 1864, the Grand Lodge of California issued a charter to Silver Star Lodge No. 165, with Chas. E. Olney, W. M.; L. W. Lee, S. W., Duane Bliss, J. W.; S. H. Robinson, Treasurer; S. E. Ettinger, Secretary; L. B. Frankel, Senior Deacon; Sol Neal, Junior Deacon; M. Frankenheimer and Hugh McLeod, Stewards; J. Lockwood, (not a member) Tyler.\n\nThere was wild activity on the slopes of Sun Peak Mountain, and in the gulches and canyons which radiated from its wind swept sides. Claims were located in all directions, by a motley aggregation of prospectors, most of them inexperienced miners; they had no knowledge of geology, and cursing, threw away the heavy blue black deposit which clogged their rockers and exhausted their quicksilver, but which was the real secret of the Comstock Lode, the source of the wealth which made the district famous. To this environment the gold-mad throng continued to stampede, hailing from every section of the land. With them swept into this maelstrom of Humanity, came many Masons, who in the order of things, were eventually enrolled with the membership of Silver City, Gold Hill, and Virginia City lodges. It is said that at the peak of its membership, Amity Lodge had an enrollment of 194 members, but its existence and progress was always more or less hampered by the proximity of the lodges at Gold Hill and Virginia City. However, the brethren were constant and energetic, which is attested by their effort and determination to carry on with an ever increasing membership, the growth of the lodge being steady, and lodge activities never waning. With a corps of competent officers elected annually to guide its destinies, it has continued to remain as one of the prominent and dominant units of Masonry in the state. Although it suffered a loss of membership with the decline of the metal industry on the Comstock, it has maintained its one time prestige, and is today a forceful factor in Masonic circles. In the meanwhile, a fourth group of brethren in Virginia City, had felt a Masonic urge, and were ambitious to establish another unit of Masonry in the camp. Headed by Brother W. A. Van Bokkelen, in the late weeks of 1863 a meeting was called to outline plans to organize a new lodge in territory dominated by the brethren of Virginia City, No. 162, Silver Star No. 165 at Gold Hill, and Amity No. 163 at Silver City, many brethren of which are said to have been present at the meeting at the request of Brother Van Bokkelen, and to have voiced their approval of a fourth lodge being established in territory adjacent to their charters. With their approval obtained, and the assurance of fraternal support, the new group was impelled to make application to the Grand Lodge of California to organize under dispensation. Accompanying their application, was a personal letter from Bro. Van Bokkelen directed to the Most Worshipful William C. Belcher, Grand Master of California Masons, requesting that the new lodge be designated by the name \"Escurial\" and stating that the name had been suggested to him when reading in Prescott's History of Spain a description of Escurial Palace. This name was deemed singularly appropriate for the new lodge, since the Spanish palace had been; built high in the mountains (Pyrenees) and was located in the vicinity of many mines, and that the name, and its appropriate application to the new lodge had found instant and popular favor with the brethren. The delay incident to action by the Grand Lodge of California upon this application, was negligible, for, on January 22, 1864, official approval was given, and a dispensation was issued to the petitioning brethren, authorizing them to organize Escurial Lodge under dispensation. At the 15th annual communication of the Grand Lodge of California, on October 13, 1864, Grand Master Wm. C. Belcher authorized that a charter be issued to the following officers and members of Escurial Lodge, U. D.: Geo. W. Hopkins, Worshipful Master; Wm. A. Van Bokkelen, Senior Warden; Columbus Walker, Junior Warden; Roderick C. Chappel, Treasurer; Erasmus W. Haines, Secretary; Charles V. Anthony, Chaplain; Ellis C. Morton, Senior Deacon; Basil V. Barry, Junior Deacon; John O'Brian, Marshal; Leonard W. Ferris, and Daniel N. Powers, Stewards; Julius Lockwood (of Virginia City Lodge No. 162) Tyler. Master Masons as follows: Robert Baxter, George W. Birdsell, John C. Bloomer, Chas. B. Brooks, Ovid Chauvel, Clark Churchill, Charles M· Cornell, Josiah Earl, Robert Eichler, Edwin T. Estes, John Fleming, Benj. L. Higbee, Wm. H. Jenkins, Geo. D. Keeny, Alex E. Kennedy, Stephen D. Merchant, Frank A. Parks, Thomas Parker, John V. B. Perry. Thos. H. Pinkerton, David C. Ross, Geo. E. Scammon, Philip Stoner, James Wheeler. Entered Apprentice, John Faull. Brother Geo. W. Hopkins became Grand Master of Nevada Masons in 1868 and 1869; Bro. Wm. A. Van Bokkelen served as Grand Master of Nevada in 1872, and as Grand Secretary F. & A. M. of Nevada Masons from 1867 to 1870 inclusive. In the meanwhile, it had become necessary to acquire suitable quarters in which to house the new lodge, and arrangements were made with Virginia City lodge No. 162 whereby Escurial Lodge was to occupy the same quarters, share the necessary running expenses, and enjoy all the privileges that Virginia City lodge enjoyed, and eventually to reimburse Virginia City lodge for one half of all expenses incurred in promoting and acquiring the building. This arrangement proved mutually agreeable, and for years the two 1odges dwelt together in fraternal peace and harmony. When the lodges in Nevada resolved to divorce themselves from the California jurisdiction and establish a Grand Lodge of Nevada Masons, was at the joint invitation of Virginia and Escurial lodges that the eight lodges then operating on Nevada soil met in Virginia City January 15, 1865, and organized the Grand Lodge of Nevada at which Grand Session Virginia lodges became Virginia No. 3, Escurial became No. 7, and Silver Star No. 5. It has been said that the prosperity and promotion of Virginia City might readily be reflected in the growth of Masonry on the Comstock, for by the end of 1869, Virginia Lodge had 142 members enrolled. Escurial followed with 138 and Silver Star at Gold Hill 123. By the spring of 1875 Virginia boasted of 185, Escurial showed 153 and Silver City 188, and their finances were in a flourishing condition. Then followed a period of disastrous fires, which almost completely wrecked both Virginia and Escurial lodges. On May 19, 1875, a large section of the business district of the city was wiped out, and the building occupied by the Masonic brethren was leveled. Permission was obtained to occupy the Odd Fellows' Hall, and plans started to raise money to erect a new temple. Work was begun and the Grand Lodge invited to lay the corner stone on October 12, but on September 3 another fire swept over the town destroying the Odd Fellows' Hall, and all the books, records and regalia saved from the fire of May 19 of both Virginia and Escurial lodges were a total loss. However, the brethren were not discouraged, and work was rushed on the new Temple in process of erection in another part of the city. On October 12, the special Communication of the Grand Lodge was held according to previous plans, the ceremonies being attended by the combined membership of the four lodges in the district, besides many visiting brethren from other sections of the state. The impressiveness of the occasion was heightened by the attendance of De Witt Commandery, Knights Templar, which participated in the ceremonies in full uniform.\n\nIt must be remembered that after the fire of May 19, all the records and papers of the Grand Lodge which were saved from the flames, and they were pitifully few, were stored in a brick building owned by Past Grand Master J. C. Currie. Fortunately, this building was not in the line of fire of September 3, and after the ceremonies attendant upon the laying of the corner stone of the new temple on October 12, it was decided as soon as the building was completed, to remove the remaining records of the Grand Lodge to the completed structure, and also to make it permanent headquarters for De Witt Commandery, Knights Templar, and a storage place for their magnificent uniforms, said to have cost between $200 and $300 apiece. These plans, however, failed to mature, for on October 26, barely two weeks from the date of laying the corner stone of the new temple, a fire, known to posterity as the Great Fire of 1875, ravished the city, entailing a loss of approximately $11,000,000 and the framework and foundation of the new temple were destroyed. In this fire the Currie building, containing what was left of the Grand Lodge records, was also consumed with its entire contents. Not a shred nor a leaf of the records of the Grand Lodge remained. However, the jewels presented to Virginia lodge by Past Grand Master W. H. Howard when that lodge was instituted, were found among the cooling embers when the conflagration had subsided. These jewels are now in possession of Carson Valley lodge. The embers of this destructive blaze were scarcely cool before the Masons of Virginia City were again planning to erect a new temple. Though discouraged, and their lodge finances exhausted, their spirits were not broken and their indomitable pride would not permit the acceptance of fraternal or financial aid from other Masonic lodges either within or without the state. Very shortly their enterprise and determination was visibly manifested in the framework promoted through their own finances, of a new temple which this time became a reality and was ready for occupancy the following June when the Annual Communication of the Grand Lodge was to be held, but which owing to lack of reports from local lodges of the state and from the Grand Bodies of other jurisdictions, originals of which had been consumed in the fire of October 26, the Grand Lodge session was called off, and the Grand Lodge of Nevada did not convene until November, 1876.\n\nThe story of Masonry in Virginia City would be incomplete without reference to the meeting held on Mt. Davidson Sept. 8, 1875, following a fire which destroyed the I. O. O. F. building in which the Masonic brethren had been meeting since the fire of May 19, 1875, when the Masonic building was burned to the ground; there was no available hall in town after the fire of Sept. 8th, and since it was desired to hold a meeting to devise plans to carry on the work of erecting a new temple, it was suggested to Grand Master Robert W. Bollen that a meeting be held near the top of Mt. Davidson. Brother Albert Hires, worshipful master of Virginia Lodge No. 3, when informed of the suggestion, asked: \"What shall be done to transact the business of the lodge and provide for the destitute, if that meeting is held at the top of the mountain ?\" He was told, \"Call the lodge together on the mountain, waiving all signs and ceremonies.\" He accordingly issued a call to the brethren to foregather near the top of Mt. Davidson, at the foot of the granite peak which surmounts the summit. The area selected was a natural amphitheatre surrounded by high crags. In preparing the plot for the meeting, rough boulders had been selected as stations for the Worshipful Master and Wardens, and the enclosure was lined with rough rocks which served as seats for the brethren. An altar was built of native rock in the center of the improvised lodge room, before which the brethren might approach the East. From a flag pole erected in years gone by, the white flag of Masonry emblazoned with the square and compass and letter G, floated in the breeze. Grand Master Robert W. Bollen was invited to preside over the meeting. Prayer was offered by Rev. I. D. Hammond, a member of the Craft, and Masonic odes were rendered by the local quartette, consisting of Bros. E. I. Passmore, Geo N. Eels, O. L. Foster, and Geo. W. Dorwin. A line of sentinels, distinguished by white bands worn around their arms were stationed around the mountain to prevent intrusion of the curious. Grand Master Bollen delivered an inspiring address welcoming the local and visiting brethren, stating the object of the meeting, and outlining a campaign which would advance the moral, spiritual and educational uplift of the district and state. Ways and means were discussed to finance and for finishing the new Temple in process of building, and arrangements made for the laying of the corner stone Oct. 12th. Following the Grand Master, Brother Chas. DeLong, Robert H. Taylor, Rollen M. Daggett, and Past Grand Masters John C. Currie and George Hopkins delivered interesting talks, and a number of selections were rendered by the lodge quartette. The meeting was closed and the brethren began the long trek down the steep mountain side. Historical accounts of the meeting written by brethren who attended, state that 342 members and visitors were present representing every Masonic jurisdiction in America. The meeting was given wide publicity not only in Masonic publications, but accounts of the gathering were printed in many of the leading newspapers of the nation. It has been maintained that the meeting on Mt. Davidson was the only one of its kind held in America up to that time. While there had been Masonic gatherings in the open, notably one held by the brethren near the settlement of Ragtown, Nevada, and another said to have been promoted by Eureka lodge No. 16, these were more of a recreational nature, promoted more for their novelty, rather than for any actual necessity, and were attended exclusively by local members. \"Mt. Davidson will be known among the craft as 'The Mountain of the Lord' and the grandest altar of Freemasonry built by the Supreme Architect. Its solid base girded with bands of gold and silver, and sparkling with gems of crystal quartz; its altar cloth in winter the purest snowy mantle spread on it by heaven itself, while the blazing sun, the silver moon, and the glittering stars, shall be its greater and lesser lights, to shine upon it as long as the earth shall be used as a Trestle Board by the Craft.\" (From \"50 Years of Masonry in California.\" Edwin A. Sherman, 33 Degree.) By 1880 Virginia City had seen its best days. The story of the Comstock had been largely written, and evil days drew nigh. Ore production was on the wane, and the glory of the bonanza days had passed. The prestige the district had once commanded was gone. The glamour and romance, the prodigality and lavishness of the \"sixties,\" when silver was King, had disappeared; they existed in memory only, and the exodus began. From a thriving inland city which flaunted its metropolitan and cosmopolitan airs, whose population at the peak of its prosperity numbered far into the thousands, it had dwindled until but a few hundred remained. The prosperity and progress of Masonry in the Comstock was naturally reflected in the discovery and development of the bonanza mines of the district. With but a few score enrolled on the membership rosters of the three lodges in the district when the Grand lodge was organized January 15, 1865, the craft expanded and grew until twenty years later when ore production began its decline, there were approximately 500 members enrolled in Virginia City. But the end was inevitable, and, as the fortunes of the district and city declined, so, likewise did Masonry suffer and so too, did its once proud membership disperse. Many of the brethren returning to the place from which they came, demitting to the lodges where first they found Masonic light. Many, of course, remained loyal to the lodge of their adoption in Virginia City and continued their membership for perhaps years, before affiliating elsewhere. Many crossed into California and eventually demitted to lodges in the Golden State, while some remained loyal to the district and to their lodges. To them remains the credit and honor of keeping the Masonic fires burning. Though the brethren remained steadfast and loyal, they could not always continue to stem the tide of discouragement caused by the gradual loss of membership and eventual depletion of their treasuries. Virginia lodge No. 3, the first lodge to be organized on the Comstock, continued until May 14, 1915, when in despair it surrendered its charter. Silver Star Lodge No. 5 of Gold Hill fought a losing battle until 1919, when it too succumbed to the inevitable, and consolidated with Escurial No. 7. Valley No. 9 of Dayton, the first lodge in the state to be granted a charter by the Grand Lodge of Nevada (October 12, 1865) maintained its existence until 1926, when it to realized the impossibility of regaining its prestige and one time numerical strength and merged with Amity No. 4.\n\nAn anniversary of the meeting held on Mt. Davidson September 8, 1875, and sponsored by the Grand Lodge of Nevada, though under the auspices of Virginia Lodge No. 3 and Escurial Lodge No. 7, was called for September 11, 1932. It was a replica, so far as possible, of the meeting held on the same spot 57 years before, honoring the pioneers of Nevada Masonry, perpetuating their memory and commemorating the unique meeting of more than a half century gone by. It was the second meeting held on this Masonically revered spot, and like the meeting held in 1875, was attended by more than 300 members of the order. Nineteen Masonic jurisdictions of the United States were represented, 17 California cities alone sending delegations. Among the distinguished guests present was ex-governor of Nevada, R. K. Colcord, the oldest living Mason in Nevada, who was then 94 years old. Attending was W. R. VanBokkelen of Oakland, California, son of Past Grand Master W. A. Van Bokkelen, who served as Grand Master in 1872, and who was a distinguished guest at the meeting of September 8, 1875. An host of dignitaries representing high officials of the state, besides many of the living Past Grand Masters of Nevada were present. An interesting exhibit was the original jewels of Virginia lodge No. 3, made of Ophir bullion and presented to that lodge by Past Grand Master W. H. Howard of the California jurisdiction, at the institution of Virginia lodge in 1863, which are now in possession of Carson Valley lodge No. 33 of Gardnerville, Nevada. Included in the exhibit was a photograph of Jno. C. Currie, Past Grand Master of Nevada Masons, who was responsible for the organization of Amity Lodge No. 4 of Silver City. There was also a photograph of the stone altar used by Virginia lodge No. 3 at the first meeting on the mountain September 8, 1875. The only known surviving member of the craft who attended the meeting in 1875 was William Sutherland, 84 years of age, who was prevented from attending by reason of infirmities due to his advanced years. Bro. Sutherland, a printer by profession, was a member the \"Territorial Enterprise\" staff, a leading publication of Virginia City at the time of the meeting of 1875, and set "
