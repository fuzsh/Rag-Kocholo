        "text": "The ambi­gu­ity in the term ​“olive oil” has long con­fused con­sumers and enriched the world of disin­gen­u­ous actors.\n\nTo the unanointed, olive oil is all-encom­pass­ing.\n\nIt comes in $40 bot­tles from bou­tique spe­cialty stores in the world’s most cos­mopoli­tan cities. Meanwhile, five-liter tins gather dust on deli floors in sleepy towns.\n\nSee Also:Olive Oil Basics\n\nThousands of kilo­me­ters away, drums, totes and flex­i­tanks — embla­zoned with the same two words — travel across the oceans on mas­sive con­tainer ships.\n\nTo add to the con­fu­sion, in most super­mar­ket aisles olive oil is usu­ally com­bined with a series of pre­fixes.\n\nThese range from the extrav­a­gant (ultra-pre­mium) to the mun­dane (pure) to the truly cryp­tic (polyphe­nol-rich).\n\nBut what do these pre­fixes actu­ally mean? The short answer: noth­ing.\n\nWho gets to define what olive oil is?\n\nThe only olive oil pre­fixes to which con­sumers should pay any atten­tion are those laid out by the five major olive oil reg­u­lat­ing author­i­ties: the Codex Alimentarius, International Olive Council (IOC), European Union, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Australian author­i­ties.\n\nThere are many other national author­i­ties that have for­mally leg­is­lated olive oil stan­dards and grades too, but they largely fol­low the ground­work laid by the five afore­men­tioned reg­u­la­tors.\n\nAs with rules gov­ern­ing most foods, the first tech­ni­cal def­i­n­i­tions of olive oil were laid out by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in the Codex Alimentarius.\n\nOriginally, the Codex Alimentarius defined four sep­a­rate olive oil grades: olive oil, vir­gin olive oil, refined olive oil and refined olive-pomace oil. Most reg­u­la­tory author­i­ties world­wide have based their own olive oil stan­dards and grades on these orig­i­nal four.\n\nHow is olive oil defined?\n\nFrom the four grades of olive oil laid out in the Codex Alimentarius, nine dif­fer­ent cat­e­gories of olive oil and olive-pomace oil are defined by the IOC.\n\nHowever, in the European Union, which is respon­si­ble for more than three-quar­ters of global pro­duc­tion, this fig­ure drops to eight.\n\nThese cat­e­gories fall into three sep­a­rate groups:\n\nVirgin oils for con­sump­tion;\n\nBlended or refined olive oil and pomace oil and vir­gin olive oils fit for con­sump­tion;\n\nOlive oil not fit for con­sump­tion\n\nWhile there is broad agree­ment inter­na­tion­ally about the dif­fer­ent olive oil cat­e­gories, their def­i­n­i­tions change based on where the olive oil is pro­duced. However, it is impor­tant to note that olive oil labels must accu­rately reflect the appro­pri­ate cat­e­gory in the coun­try where the oil will be sold.\n\nVirgin oils\n\nVirgin olive oils are obtained solely by mechan­i­cal or other phys­i­cal means under ther­mal con­di­tions that do not alter the chem­i­cal com­po­si­tion of the oil. The only treat­ment that the olives and oil undergo are wash­ing, decanta­tion, cen­trifu­ga­tion and fil­tra­tion.\n\n1. Extra vir­gin olive oil\n\nThe Codex Alimentarius, IOC, the USDA and Australian author­i­ties define extra vir­gin olive as hav­ing an excel­lent fla­vor and odor with the median of defects – the median score of one of the 12 olive oil defects, which is per­ceived with the great­est inten­sity – as zero and the median of fruiti­ness above zero. EVOO also has a free fatty acid con­tent expressed as oleic acid less than 0.8 grams per 100 grams.\n\nWhile most gov­ern­ments around the world adhere to the stan­dards set out in the Codex Alimentarius, the def­i­n­i­tion for extra vir­gin olive oil is more strict in California, which per­mits a free fatty acid con­tent expressed as oleic acid less than 0.5 grams per 100 grams. However, the organolep­tic require­ments remain the same.\n\n2. Virgin olive oil\n\nThe Codex Alimentarius, IOC and E.U. define vir­gin olive oil as hav­ing a rea­son­ably good fla­vor and odor with the median of defects between zero and 3.5, with the median of fruiti­ness attribute above zero. The free fatty acid con­tent, expressed as oleic acid, is less than two grams per 100 grams.\n\nThe USDA and Australian author­i­ties have slightly stricter organolep­tic require­ments, with the median of defects between zero and 2.5 with the median of fruiti­ness attribute above zero. The free fatty acid con­tent remains the same.\n\n3. Ordinary vir­gin olive oil\n\nThe Codex Alimentarius, IOC and Australian author­i­ties define ordi­nary vir­gin olive oil as hav­ing a median of defects between 3.5 and six, with a median of fruiti­ness above zero. The free fatty acid con­tent, expressed as oleic acid, must be less than 3.3 grams per 100 grams.\n\nOrdinary vir­gin olive oil is not very com­mon as it may only be sold directly to con­sumers in coun­tries where the cat­e­gory is rec­og­nized.\n\nBlended of refined olive oil and olive pomace oil and virgin olive oils fit for consumption\n\n4. Refined olive oil blended with vir­gin olive oils (olive oil, in the U.S.)\n\nThe Codex Alimentarius, E.U., IOC, Australian author­i­ties and USDA define this cat­e­gory of olive oil as com­pris­ing a blend of refined olive oil with vir­gin olive oils fit for con­sump­tion.\n\nThe final blend of the two has a free acid­ity, expressed as oleic acid, of less than one gram per 100 grams. Its organolep­tic char­ac­ter­is­tics cor­re­spond to vir­gin olive oil but may vary depend­ing on indi­vid­ual reg­u­la­tions in each coun­try.\n\n5. Olive pomace oil com­posed of refined olive-pomace oils and vir­gin olive oils\n\nOlive pomace oil is obtained by extract­ing the last remain­ing droplets of oil from olives that have already been mechan­i­cally trans­formed. The process usu­ally involves chem­i­cally extract­ing the oil with pow­er­ful sol­vents before evap­o­rat­ing these out of the final prod­uct and deodor­iz­ing the result­ing oil.\n\nThe Codex Alimentarius, E.U., IOC and USDA define olive pomace oil as com­pris­ing a blend of refined olive pomace oil and vir­gin olive oils fit for con­sump­tion. Free fatty acid con­tent must be less than one gram per 100 grams.\n\nIn Australia, author­i­ties have slightly more strict require­ments, also requir­ing olive pomace oils to have the same organolep­tic stan­dards as vir­gin olive oil, a median of defects less than or equal to 2.5.\n\nOlive oil not fit for human consumption\n\n6. Lampante vir­gin olive oil\n\nThe Codex Alimentarius and IOC broadly define lam­pante vir­gin olive oil as an olive oil obtained solely by mechan­i­cal meth­ods that is not fit for human con­sump­tion. Its free fatty acid con­tent, expressed as oleic acid, is more than 3.3 grams per 100 grams. Its organolep­tic char­ac­ter­is­tics also have a median of defects greater than six and a median of fruiti­ness of zero. These types of oils are typ­i­cally sent to be refined and then blended.\n\nHowever, the USDA and Australian author­i­ties have a slightly stricter def­i­n­i­tion for lam­pante vir­gin olive oil. They define the prod­uct as hav­ing a median of defects between 2.5 and 6 or a median of defects less than or equal to 2.5 with a median of fruiti­ness of zero. Free fatty acid con­tent, expressed as oleic acid, must be less than two grams per 100 grams.\n\nThe E.U. has very sim­i­lar rules to the USDA and Australia, only dif­fer­ing in that the median of defects must be above 3.5 or the median of defects must be less than or equal to 2.5 with a fruiti­ness of zero.\n\n7. Refined olive oil\n\nThe Codex Alimentarius, E.U., IOC, Australian author­i­ties and USDA define refined olive oil as hav­ing been obtained from vir­gin olive oils using refin­ing meth­ods that do not alter the ini­tial glyc­eridic struc­ture, esters com­pris­ing glyc­erol and fatty acids. The free fatty acid con­tent, expressed as oleic acid, is less than 0.3 grams per 100 grams.\n\n8. Crude olive pomace oil\n\nThe Codex Alimentarius, E.U., IOC and USDA define crude olive pomace oil as the prod­uct obtained by extract­ing the last remain­ing droplets of oil from olives that have already been mechan­i­cally trans­formed. The process usu­ally involves chem­i­cally extract­ing the oil with pow­er­ful sol­vents before evap­o­rat­ing these out of the final prod­uct and deodor­iz­ing the result­ing oil.\n\n9. Refined olive pomace oil\n\nThe Codex Alimentarius, E.U., IOC and USDA define refined olive pomace oil as being obtained from crude olive pomace oil using meth­ods that do not lead to alter­ations in the ini­tial glyc­eridic struc­ture. It has a free fatty acid­ity, expressed as oleic acid, of not more than 0.3 grams per 100 grams.\n\nThe main takeaways\n\nShopping for olive oil should not be as hard as it is. Really, most con­sumers are in the mar­ket for either an extra vir­gin, vir­gin or refined olive oil blended with vir­gin olive oil.\n\nWhen shop­ping for olive oil, pay no heed to the myr­iad pre­fixes adorn­ing ornate labels. Simply pay atten­tion to the terms ​“vir­gin” and ​“extra vir­gin.” Any other pre­fixes – with the excep­tion of ​“organic” – are utterly mean­ing­less (no mat­ter what the YouTube videos say).\n\nExtra vir­gin and vir­gin olive oils are more expen­sive than a blend of refined and vir­gin olive oils, which usu­ally will not be labeled ​“refined olive oil blended with vir­gin olive oil.”\n\nHowever, any label­ing descrip­tion from plain ​“olive oil” to ​“pure olive oil,” ​“light olive oil,” ​“pre­mium olive oil” or ​“fresh olive oil” is sim­ply a blend of refined and vir­gin olive oils.\n\nCaveat emp­tor."
