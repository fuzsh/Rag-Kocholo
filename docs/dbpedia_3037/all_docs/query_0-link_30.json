        "text": "The International Olive Council (IOC) in Madrid, Spain, sets the grades and standards for world olive oil trade, which members of the North American Olive Oil Association agree to follow. The different types of olive oil are distinguished by their production method, flavor and chemistry. For production and trading purposes there are six different grades of Olive Oil and three different grades of Olive-Pomace Oil, although consumers are usually offered only two or three types for home or restaurant use. All olive oils offer benefits compared to commonly-used cooking oils, but the health and usage benefits vary among the grades.\n\nVirgin and Extra Virgin\n\nThe closest to nature are Virgin Olive Oils, which offer the most health benefits and a wide range of quality and flavor profiles, similar to wine.\n\nVirgin olive oils are naturally extracted from the olives without using heat or chemicals\n\nVirgin olive oils retain antioxidants and vitamins from the olives\n\nExtra virgin olive oil is the highest grade of all and has zero flavor flaws when assessed by a panel of 8 – 12 tasters\n\nVirgin olive oils work well for both cold and hot uses when cooking\n\nThe flavor profiles of Virgin and Extra Virgin Olive Oils are vast. The final flavor is affected by many factors including the olive type, where the olives are grown, when the olives are harvested, the weather during the growing season, and the processing.\n\nRefined Olive Oils\n\nPoor quality virgin olive oil with major sensory and/or chemical defects is called Lampante olive oil. Lampante olive oil is refined to remove bad flavors and odors and the end result is Refined Olive Oil.\n\nThe grade Olive Oil is made by blending Refined Olive Oil with Virgin Olive Oil. The Virgin Olive Oil adds flavor and antioxidants back to the Refined Olive Oil and the percentage used can vary by supplier.\n\nOlive oil contains the same large proportion of monounsaturated fat, the “good fat,” as virgin olive oils, but olive oil will have fewer antioxidants because it is mostly refined olive oil\n\nOlive oil typically has a milder flavor than extra virgin olive oil\n\nSome manufacturers call out “Light in Flavor” or “Light Tasting” on the Olive Oil label when there is very little virgin olive oil blended with the refined olive oil\n\nOlive oils work well for some cold and many hot uses when cooking\n\nFinally, the IOC sets standards for a separate product category called Olive-Pomace Oil. Unlike Olive Oils, which are naturally extracted from olives, Olive-Pomace Oil is solvent extracted from the leftover skins and pits after the olives are crushed and then it is refined. The consumable grade Olive-Pomace Oil is made by blending Refined Olive-Pomace Oil with Virgin Olive Oil."
