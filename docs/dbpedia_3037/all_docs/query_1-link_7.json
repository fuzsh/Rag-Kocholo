        "text": "How to read the label on Morocco Gold extra virgin olive oil.\n\nUpdated September 29th 2023\n\nWhy Labelling Information For Extra Virgin Olive Oil Matters\n\nWhen it comes to choosing your bottle of extra virgin olive oil, we know there is a lot of choice! So, what is important in ensuring you are buying authentic extra virgin olive oil? The olive oil label is a hallmark of the quality and grade of any reputable extra virgin olive oil and is a great way of providing reassurance of the quality of the extra virgin olive oil you are buying.\n\nExtra virgin olive oil is an entirely natural, unrefined oil and represents the highest quality olive oil available. Genuine extra virgin olive oil is rare, making it slightly more expensive. The definition of extra virgin olive oil entails specific production methods, taste, and chemical composition.\n\nIt’s important to read the label on extra virgin olive oil before purchasing in order to make sure you are getting the highest quality product. At Morocco Gold, we ensure all of our labelling information is clear and transparent, including information on polyphenols, which are a vital component in delivering the health benefits associated with a high-quality extra virgin olive oil.\n\nUsually extra virgin olive oil will have phrases like ‘cold-pressed’ or ‘first cold pressed extra virgin olive oil’ labelled on the bottle, indicating that a chemical-free process was used in its extraction. Taking extra time to read the label ensures you get the best extra virgin olive oil for your culinary needs!\n\nTo be classified as extra virgin olive oil, the acidity level must be below 0.8%, with no taste defects. In practice, the best extra virgin olive oils have significantly lower acidity levels. For example, Morocco Gold extra virgin olive oil consistently remains below 0.5%, typically averaging around 0.25% to 0.3%, depending on weather conditions throughout the growing season. Unlike other oils, extra virgin olive oil is completely natural and undergoes no chemical treatment or alterations in temperature. That is why our label includes the words ‘obtained directly from olives and solely by mechanical means’ – also – ‘pressed within 24 hours at temperatures below 27 degrees’.\n\nThe Importance Of Being Single Estate Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nWhen it comes to extra virgin olive oil, authenticity matters. It’s crucial to choose the best quality oil to ensure both the taste and health benefits. There’s something special about single estate extra virgin olive oil. It comes from one source, without any blending or mixing with other oils. This guarantees a pure and authentic oil, maintaining the highest quality standards.\n\nMorocco Gold Extra Virgin Olive Oil Labelling : Our Objectives\n\nOur aim at Morocco Gold is to re-establish consumer trust and confidence in Extra Virgin Olive Oil as ‘the original superfood’ through setting a new standard for authenticity, traceability and the guarantee of Extra Virgin Olive Oil quality with the information included on our olive oil labelling.\n\nIn particular, we include the results of our annual harvest analysis on each and every bottle of Morocco Gold Extra Virgin Olive Oil so our customers can see at a glance the quality of our oil.\n\nOur labelling enables our customers to make well informed choices about the olive oil they prefer. That is why we pay so much attention to the information we include on our rear label."
