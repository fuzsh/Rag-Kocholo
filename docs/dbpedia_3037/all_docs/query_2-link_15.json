        "text": "The legislation on food products labeling, olive oil included, is governed by both EU and national level regulations, directives, and laws. The purpose of this “bundle of regulations” is to clarify what “must”, what “may”, and what “ may not” be indicated on the label.\n\nIn the episodes dedicated to labeling (Podcast 32, 33, 35, 37) I will try to tell you how the label, an olive oil’s identity card, is made.\n\nAll the information here was updated in 2022, so it is a good idea to check the reference legislation on the website of the Ministry of Agricultural Policy, the Inspectorate of Fraud Repression and other relevant bodies as with all the legislation there is a succession of interpretations, new regulations and amendments.\n\nThese podcasts on labels are intended to be an informative guide and not an essential vademecum.\n\nThe label’s purpose is to describe what is in the container, allowing a consumer to know exactly what he/she is buying. It is also indispensable for detecting food fraud.\n\nSometimes fraud is unintentional or due to labeling regulations that are complex, elaborate, and multidisciplinary.\n\nOccasionally, a producer (not being able to objectively judge his own product) mistakenly considers more or less severely defective oils extra virgin, only because they are made from his olives. Consequently, if he labels them as virgin, he is selling adulterated oils and is punishable by law.\n\nI will try to shed some light on current legislation. If you wish to know about olive oil defects, you may listen to other episodes of this podcast.\n\nAs there often is confusion between mandatory and voluntary information on the label, in today’s podcast I tell you more about voluntary indications on the label.\n\nEven if voluntary information has no legal or nutritional relevance, it shall not mislead the consumer. Often, voluntary information is added to the label to better represent the product, even if unnecessary, redundant, and repetitive.\n\nSo I would suggest to include only mandatory information on the label: The less you write, the less likely you are to make a mistake and the less likely it is that you will have to defend what you have written.\n\nAlthough there are specific regulations regarding olive oil, the EU Regulation1169 from 2011 established common ground for governing food information, enabling EU consumers to make informed choices in relation to food, and, specifically, to prevent misleading actions and omissions of information. It brings together the set of rules on food labeling, presentation and advertising.\n\nTherefore all the “extra” information that you want to provide must be subjected to this regulation and must be accurate, transparent and logical in order to ensure high consumer protection levels. Voluntary information shall provide information on food safety composition and quality without misleading the consumer.\n\nLet’s start with the simplest and most innocuous: The name of the cultivars used to produce the oil we are labeling.\n\nMonocultivar\n\nIs it possible to indicate the name of the cultivars or a cultivar if we are producing monocultivar or monovarietal oil on the label?\n\nLet’s say you have inherited the olive grove from your grandfather and your grandmother tells you that the olive trees are the Leccino variety that your grandfather bought in Tuscany before the war. Is this sufficient to bottle olive oil from these trees as “monocultivar Leccino”?\n\nNo it is not. You need to have proof of purchase or land surveyor records identifying the cultivar. These must be part of your olive orchard records.\n\nIf we are to compare it with the wine world…you would never bottle wine and write on the label that is Nebbiolo just because your grandfather said so.\n\nAfter you verified the type of cultivar, you must make sure that the name corresponds to the one listed in the Olive Varieties Records of Italy (“Schedario Oleicolo Italiano”).\n\nCreative names or genetic variations from the area classified and named only locally cannot be used. There are specialized research centers that analyze olive leaves and are able to identify cultivars at a really affordable cost (less than 100 euros per sample).\n\nThe analysis is done by comparing the values obtained with the existing database that has more than six thousand samples between main cultivars and variations.\n\n“First cold pressing” – “Cold extraction”\n\nThe “pressing” is used for olive oil obtained by a traditional or discontinuous cycle, in other words with a hydraulic press (See Podcast 20). The term “extraction” may be used if olive oil is obtained by a continuous cycle..\n\nThese two terms are not interchangeable and should be used accurately. So we cannot write “ pressing” if oil has been produced by a continuous cycle, even if we think that pressing sounds better.\n\nIn both cases (whether traditional or continuous cycle), the term “ cold” can be written on the label only for extra virgin olive oil obtained at a temperature not exceeding 27℃.\n\nIf you are really determined to include these terms on the label, make sure you have a declaration provided by the miller, for each batch of processed olives, indicating the technology used to ensure the truthfulness of the declarations.\n\nIf you write it on the label and you do not have the certification issued by the miller, it is trade fraud (Article 8, DM 10711/09, Reg EU 29/12). The violation is done by the person who bottles the oil because the label indicates a processing method that the bottler cannot document without the miller’s certification.\n\nJust a reminder (from Podcast 20): The olive oil extracted from mediocre olives – – even if processed at temperature below 27℃ – – will be of mediocre quality.\n\nEqually, it makes very little sense to write first cold pressing as there is no second pressed extra virgin olive oil. If you want more information on this, you may listen to podcast 20 in which this issue is covered at length.\n\nStrong or mellow? Robust or rustic? Authentic or healthy?\n\nUnlike wine, the organoleptic characteristics relating to extra virgin olive oil may appear on the label solely if they describe positive attributes such as fruity, bitter and pungent as defined by the IOC (International Olive Oil Council). Fruitiness can be described as green or ripe and the intensity of perception can be described as robust, medium or delicate as defined by the IOC. These attributes can be written on the label only if the oils have been assessed and certified by the authorized panel leader (In Italy, it shall be a panel carrying out organoleptic qualities for the commercial classification of the olive oils, recognized by the Ministry of Agriculture ). This certification must be done for each batch.\n\nLow acidity\n\nIf the oil is extra virgin, the acidity is already low. There is no need to provide this information on the label. If the mineral water label said “potable”, the consumer would find it laughable. But if the consumer reads “ low acidity” on the olive oil label, this information will most probably influence his choice. As I mentioned earlier, voluntary information should not mislead the consumer.\n\nMoreover, EU regulation allows declaration of the acidity on the label only when provided together with peroxide value, wax content and ultraviolet absorption.\n\nThis implies having a proof of chemical analysis for declared values. However, the law, initially, did not specify when these values shall be measured. As these values tend to increase over time, many bottlers, to avoid misunderstanding, specified that the values were those measured at the time of packaging.\n\nThis changed with the EU Regulation 1096 from 2018 that specifies “where indicated on the labeling, the value of physicochemical parameters should be the maximum values such parameters could reach by the date of minimum durability”.\n\nSo if you want to avoid potential disputes and penalties, you should declare the maximum values that could be reached by the date of minimum durability.\n\nEven if it makes no sense at all! Common sense tells us that these values should be determined at the time of packaging.\n\nUnfiltered\n\nYou can write “unfiltered” if olive oil is actually unfiltered! It may seem obvious, but there are perfectly filtered oils on the market (filtration as explained in the Podcast 19 is an essential practice) whose labels claim that they are “unfiltered”, most probably to attract those consumers who think that unfiltered olive oils keep their intrinsic properties intact.\n\nYou cannot write on the unfiltered oil’s label “sediment is an indicator of authenticity” as it does not correspond to the truth. In no product on the market is authenticity synonymous with residues on the bottom.\n\n“Selected by” or “Guaranteed by” may be written only if adequately supported by documentation and relevant authorizations for each batch of product.\n\nFor instance, if my olive oil is included in Slow Food’s Extra Virgin Olive Oil Guide, I cannot write on the label “the oil was selected by Slow Food” nor can I place the Slow Food logo on it because the Slow Food’s guide regulations do not allow it. So if I were to do it anyway, I would be violating the regulations and risking legal penalties.\n\nIt is possible to to write any voluntary certifications (always adequately supported by documentation), land references (the number of parcels), geographic coordinates, history of the company responsible for marketing or history of the oil mill, suggested food pairings, a bar code, web addresses and similar information.\n\nHealth claims\n\n“Olive oil polyphenols contribute to the protection of blood lipids from oxidative stress – Beneficial effect is obtained with a daily intake of 20 g of olive oil.” This claim can be used only for extra virgin olive oils containing at least 5 mg of hydroxytyrosol (and its derivatives oleuropein and tyrosol) per 20 g of olive oil.\n\n“Source of vitamin E – Vitamin E contributes to the protection of cells from oxidative stress”. This claim may be used for extra virgin olive oils containing at least 80 mg of alpha tocopherol per kilogram of product.\n\nHealth claims included on the label must be supported by chemical analysis of the compounds for each batch of olive oil."
