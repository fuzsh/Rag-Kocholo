        "text": "Tips for planning your olive oil label\n\nConsiderations when ‘planning your label’\n\nAustralia and New Zealand Food Authority\n\nSome requirements for labelling:\n\nName and address of manufacturer. This is to be site address not a PO Box, and should include the state of the manufacturer.\n\nThe lot identification. This is a code that relates to each batch of oil you produce. The code for that batch is then placed on the label of every package it relates to. How to choose to code each batch is up to you, provided that you maintain your records so that you can identify and recall a batch, if necessary.\n\nStatement of ingredients. This is to be placed on the label in descending order of ingoing weight.\n\nDeclaration of any food additives. Food additives can only be added in accordance with regulations.\n\nDate marking. ‘Best before’ or ‘Use by’ etc.\n\nDirections for use and storage. The label must include a statement of any specific storage conditions required to ensure that the food will keep for the specified period indicated in the ‘use-by’ or ‘best-before’ date.\n\nNutrition Information Panel. To include energy, protein, fat, carbohydrates and sodium.\n\nPercentage labelling.\n\nImportant! Please check the FSANZ website at http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/ to view the new joint Australian New Zealand Food Standards Code.\n\nFor additional information contact FSANZ via email advice@anzfa.com.au or phone the ‘advice desk’ on 1300 652 166 (for the cost of a local call).\n\nSuggestions for information on olive oil labels:\n\nName of company or brand.\n\nCategory of oil (“Extra Virgin”, “Virgin” etc)\n\nOlive Oil.\n\nCold Pressed (If it is).\n\nDescription of oil’s character – robust, mild, fruity, nutty, and so on.\n\nName of region where olives were grown.\n\nName of variety/varieties.\n\nCholesterol free.\n\nMonth or year of harvest/processing.\n\nClaims you are making like ‘Totally natural product’ or ‘heart-healthy’ need to be verified by FSANZ and there is a process for you to follow.\n\nFree from additives.\n\nProduct of “name of State or country”\n\nQuantity (750 ml etc).\n\nBest before date.\n\nStickers or panels with additional information -“Certified organic by NASAA”, “Winner of Gold Medal” etc\n\nOther Suggestions:\n\nBe truthful in all statements made on your label.\n\nThe presentation of your label is very important. Ensure labels are positioned well on the bottle (not crooked) and also make sure that the label is not blemished from leaking oil and so on.\n\nIf you are blending different varieties of olives in your oils, state them on the label.\n\nYour bottle and label should convey a message of quality.\n\nIf you want to give a lot of information, consider having another label on the back of the bottle.\n\nThe main label could have your brand name, volume, year of harvest, region, variety , oil category (Extra Virgin, Virgin) and so on.\n\nA back label could give information about such things as the method and date of processing, details about the variety and region, or nutritional information. Interesting aspects of your family and/or property history could also be given.\n\nCheck that your name hasn’t already been trademarked elsewhere in Australia.\n\nRead more about Labelling\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
