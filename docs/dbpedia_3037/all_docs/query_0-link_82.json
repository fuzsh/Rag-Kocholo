Yes, we even put it in our coffee, and drizzle it over ice cream.\n\nBut our olive oil is more than just for cooking - it's nourishment for the soul, and it brings our family together. We hope it does the same for yours.\n\nOur region's unique Oblica varietal, preserved from the time of Roman Dalmatia, is hand-picked and cold pressed in November at the annual village harvest, in our little selo near Zadar.\n\nAnd we'd be honored if you tried some. Živili!\n\n- The Erlić Family"
