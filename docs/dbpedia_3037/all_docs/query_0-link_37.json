        "text": "The technological advances in fats and oils analysis have been accompanied by a growing awareness of the need for ever more effective control of the quality, purity and authenticity of the olive oils that are sold, especially on new olive oil consumer countries. This moved the IOC to invite olive oil chemistry experts from its member countries to collaborate in searching for new more accurate and reliable methods, particularly to detect fraud, based on technical advances and new scientific data and research.\n\nSince 1988, the chemists have been meeting twice a year. Their work has led to the adoption by the IOC of olive oil-specific methods to detect seed oils, desterolised seed oils, olive-pomace oil or traces of halogenated solvents, among others."
