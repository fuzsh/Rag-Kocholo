        "text": "Types of starchy foods\n\nPotatoes\n\nPotatoes are a great choice of starchy food and a good source of energy, fibre, B vitamins and potassium.\n\nIn the UK, we also get a lot of our vitamin C from potatoes. Although potatoes only contain a small amount of vitamin C, we generally eat a lot of them. They're good value for money and can be a healthy choice.\n\nAlthough potatoes are a vegetable, in the UK we mostly eat them as the starchy food part of a meal, and they're a good source of carbohydrate in our diet.\n\nBecause of this, potatoes do not count towards your five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, but they can have an important role in your diet.\n\nPotatoes are a healthy choice when boiled, baked, mashed or roasted with only a small amount of fat or oil and no added salt.\n\nFrench fries and other chips cooked in oil or served with salt are not a healthy choice.\n\nWhen cooking or serving potatoes, go for lower-fat or polyunsaturated spreads, or small amounts of unsaturated oils, such as olive or sunflower oil.\n\nFor mashed potato, use lower-fat milk, such as semi-skimmed, 1% fat or skimmed milk, instead of whole milk or cream.\n\nLeave potato skins on where possible, to keep more of the fibre and vitamins. For example, eat the skin when you have boiled or baked potatoes.\n\nIf you boil potatoes, some nutrients will leak out into the water, especially if you have peeled them. To stop this happening, only use enough water to cover them and cook them only for as long as they need.\n\nStoring potatoes in a cool, dark and dry place or in the fridge will help stop them sprouting. Do not eat any green, damaged or sprouting bits of potatoes, as these can contain toxins that can be harmful.\n\nBread\n\nBread, especially wholemeal, granary, brown and seeded varieties, is a healthy choice to eat as part of a balanced diet.\n\nWholegrain, wholemeal and brown breads give us energy and contain B vitamins, vitamin E, fibre and a wide range of minerals.\n\nWhite bread also contains a range of vitamins and minerals, but it has less fibre than wholegrain, wholemeal or brown bread. If you prefer white bread, look for higher-fibre options.\n\nSome people avoid bread because they're concerned about having a food intolerance or allergy to wheat, or they think bread is fattening.\n\nHowever, completely cutting out any type of food from your diet could mean you miss out on a range of nutrients that you need to stay healthy.\n\nIf you're concerned that you have a wheat allergy or intolerance, speak to a GP.\n\nBread can be stored at room temperature. Follow the \"best before\" date to make sure you eat it fresh.\n\nCereal products\n\nCereal products are made from grains. Wholegrain cereals can contribute to our daily intake of iron, fibre, B vitamins and protein. Higher-fibre options can also provide a slow release of energy.\n\nWheat, oats, barley, rye and rice are commonly available cereals that can be eaten as wholegrains.\n\nThis means cereal products consisting of oats or oatmeal, such as porridge, and wholewheat products are healthy breakfast options.\n\nBarley, couscous, corn and tapioca also count as healthy cereal products.\n\nMany cereal products in the UK are refined, with low wholegrain content. They can also be high in added salt and sugar.\n\nWhen you're shopping for cereals, check the food labels to compare different products.\n\nRice and grains\n\nRice and grains are an excellent choice of starchy food. They give us energy, are low in fat, and good value for money.\n\nThere are many types to choose from, including:\n\nall kinds of rice – such as quick-cook, arborio, basmati, long grain, brown, short grain and wild\n\ncouscous\n\nbulgur wheat\n\nAs well as carbohydrates, rice and grains (particularly brown and wholegrain varieties) can contain:\n\nfibre, which can help your body get rid of waste products\n\nB vitamins, which help release energy from the food you eat and help your body work properly\n\nRice and grains, such as couscous and bulgur wheat, can be eaten hot or cold, and in salads.\n\nThere are a few precautions you should take when storing and reheating cooked rice and grains. This is because the spores of some food poisoning bugs can survive cooking.\n\nIf cooked rice or grains are left standing at room temperature, the spores can germinate. The bacteria multiply and produce toxins that make you be sick (vomit) and have diarrhoea. Reheating food will not get rid of these toxins.\n\nIt's therefore best to serve rice and grains as soon as they have been cooked. If this is not possible, cool them within 1 hour of cooking and keep them refrigerated until you reheat them or use them in a recipe such as a salad.\n\nIt's important to throw away any rice and grains that have been left at room temperature overnight.\n\nIf you are not going to eat cooked rice immediately, refrigerate it within 1 hour and eat it within 24 hours.\n\nRice should be reheated thoroughly, reaching a core temperature of 70C for 2 minutes (or equivalent) so it's steaming hot throughout.\n\nRice should not be reheated more than once – it should be thrown away. Do not reheat rice unless it's been chilled safely and kept in a fridge until you reheat it.\n\nFollow the \"use by\" date and storage instructions on the label for any cold rice or grain salads that you buy.\n\nPasta in your diet\n\nPasta is another healthy option to base your meal on. It consists of dough made from durum wheat and water and contains iron and B vitamins.\n\nWholewheat or wholegrain are healthier than ordinary pasta, as they contain more fibre. We digest wholegrain foods slower than refined grains, so they can help us feel full for longer.\n\nDried pasta can be stored in a cupboard and typically has a long shelf life, while fresh pasta will need to be refrigerated and has a shorter lifespan.\n\nCheck the food packaging for \"best before\" or \"use by\" dates and further storage instructions."
