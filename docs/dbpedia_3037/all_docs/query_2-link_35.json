        "text": "4.2.1. Credence Attributes\n\nOrigin. Among the credence attributes, the origin of the product was the most studied attribute. The product origin refers to the place where the production takes place. Thirty-two reviewed studies have focused on consumer acceptance and preferences for origin-related cues associated with the EVOO product. Most of the studies reported as origin cues were important drivers for EVOO or OO choices [7,8,9,11,27,30,32,34,36,39,41,43,44,45,46,49,51,53,57,59,60,61,63,65,66,67,69,71]. An exception to these findings was Mtimet et al.’s [64] study, according to which the region of origin attribute is not related to Tunisian consumers’ purchasing decisions of EVOO. Several studies pointed out as regional certifications are associated with consumers’ perceptions of olive oil authenticity, quality and healthiness, adding value to the product [30,31,51,59,60]. Additionally, other studies showed that the “origin of production” attribute was associated with a premium price in the Spanish market [41,43,46]. Spanish consumers consider elements related to the olive-oil quality both physical quality attributes (e.g., acidity, sensorial properties) and historical and identity values (e.g., origin, traditional production) [43]. Erraach et al. [43] found that Spanish consumers prefer the “PDO” label over the “country” of origin and “origin of production” information. Although the taste experience of the product may invert such preferences’ ranking, as found in Ballco and Gracia [41], where the “origin of production” was valued as more important than the “PDO” label after taste. According to Espejel et al. [44], consumers with low knowledge of OO bases their choice of consumption on intrinsic attributes (e.g., color, appearance, flavor, etc.), otherwise an expert consumer bases their choice of consumption on extrinsic attributes (e.g., origin). These results suggest the need to promote and increase the consumer knowledge of products protected under the PDO [45]. When the comparison of “origin of product” refers to a country of production, consumers from EVOO non-producing countries such as Japanese consumers prefer Italian EVOO over Spanish and Tunisian [65]. Additionally, Italian consumers prefer Italian EVOO rather than European [34] or Spanish [7] ones. However, Cicia et al. [31] and Scarpa and Del Giudice [69] suggested that Italian consumers are affected by home bias in purchasing EVOO as the domestic one was largely preferred over foreign EVOOs. These results were consistent with Tempesta and Vecchiato’s [39] findings that when investigating consumers’ preferences for Italian or Veneto EVOOs, suggest that Italian consumers largely prefer local products. Home bias was also detected in several studies testing the relevance of the production region among Italians and for which consumers are willing to pay a premium price ranging from +35% to +41.8% for 100% Italian EVOO [29,30,32,36]. Consistently, Greek consumers record home bias in their EVOO choices, preferring Greek olive oil over ones from other Mediterranean countries [53], as well as Chilean extra virgin olive oil consumers preferring domestic products over Italian and Spanish ones [59]. Home bias is less relevant in non-producing countries. For example, only 20% of Americans prefer local olive oil [57]. Comparing Netherlands and Italian consumers, Italians are more aware of the strict requirements needed to indicate the origin on the label [30]. Ilak Peršurić [61] showed that German consumers recognize a high value in origin attributes such as protected designations of geographical origin (PDO) and/or German original designation. Additionally, Roselli et al. [11] found that environmentally friendly consumers prefer domestic products to directly support rural landscape preservation.\n\nAccording to Jimenez-Guerrero et al. [66], the country of origin attribute is more capable of influencing inexperienced consumers than experienced consumers. From a sensory analysis point of view, it was noted that EVOO produced starting from olives produced in the same geographical area shared similar sensorial attributes [67].\n\nSustainable-related attributes. The twenty-four studies reviewed have focused on consumer acceptance and preferences for sustainable-related attributes associated with the EVOO product. The studies reviewed pointed out that consumers highly accept organic EVOO and are also willing to pay a premium price to purchase a product produced according to sustainable farm practices. Specifically, the premium price associated with the “organic” attribute largely varies across studies ranging from +0.7 EUR/L [39] to +7.14 EUR/L [34]. The premium price of organic EVOO is driven by the consumers’ interest in lowering the environmental impacts of products consumed, as well as by the perception that organic EVOO is healthier compared to its conventional counterpart [30]. Indeed, organic EVOO is often defined as a “natural product”, “additive free”, “chemical residue free”, and “pure” [48,54]. Boncinelli et al. [7] found that consumers interested in EVOO with organic labels jointly selected health claims on it confirming an overlapping interest in a product’s health and sustainable attributes. Instead, the organic feature does not affect consumers’ organoleptic expectations and the overall quality perception [27,48]. Organic consumers were indicated as young with a medium–high education level and income. Women show marked preferences for organic EVOO compared to men [34,39,53]. Factors potentially hindering the consumer’s acceptance and preferences for organic EVOO were indicated as being the lack of knowledge about organic production methods; lack of knowledge and access to stores selling organic EVOOs; and lastly, the low level of trust in the organic information reported on the product’s label [47,48,54]. Those barriers may justify the results from two studies by Dekhili et al. [63] and Yangui et al. [49], which detected consumer disutility from purchasing organic EVOO, as well as consumers’ lack of interest in the organic attribute.\n\nAlthough the majority of studies in the literature have focused on assessing consumer acceptance and preferences for the organic attribute, recently, scholars have explored consumer preferences for other sustainable attributes potentially available in olive oil such as those indicating that the product is “obtained from ancient trees”, or “produced in mountainous areas”, or “obtained with sustainable water use”, as well as whether the OO is produced from trees preserving the “traditional landscape” [34,39]. Those studies consistently found the existence of premium price associated with the product bearing such attributes and this premium ranges from 0.7 EUR/L for a product labeled as a “mountain product”, to 5.79 EUR/L for those products with olives collected “from ancient tree”. Thus, these findings pointed out that consumers are interested in the broader set of sustainable-related attributes potentially available in EVOO besides the organic ones and are willing to pay higher prices for such attributes [34,39].\n\nBrand. As a credence attribute, the brand was often considered to affect consumer acceptance and preferences for OO and EVOO in thirteen reviewed studies. Vlontzos and Duquenne [55] analyzed the Greek consumers’ WTP for several EVOO brands and found that around 20% of the consumers would accept paying more for a branded EVOO. Ballco and Gracia [41] studied the differences between processors’ leading brands and distributors’ private brands of Spanish EVOO, pointing out that leading brands are widely accepted among Spanish private labels to which consumers associated lower cost and quality. Antonialli et al. [66] pointed out that a price premium was associated with branded EVOO among Brazilian consumers. Contini et al. [32] and Espejel et al. [44] found that a brand shapes consumer acceptance and preference among consumers with a high “feeling”/knowledge of the product among Italian and Spanish consumers, respectively. Although, the average Italian’s acceptance and preference for EVOO are not affected by the product brand. Those results are consistent with findings from other studies, which found a lack of consumers attention to the EVOO brand among Italian [36], Greek [51] and Spanish [49] consumers, while [59] even recorded a negative influence in the final consumer price of a retailer brand in Chile.\n\nSafety and health-related statements. Six reviewed studies focused on consumer acceptance and preferences for safety and health-related statements associated with the EVOO product. One study review focused on Greeks’ preferences for EVOO with “HACCP” and “ISO” certifications, used as proxies for informing consumers about enhanced product safety features. Authors pointed out that consumers place a marginal interest in safety-related aspects taking it for granted in products available on the market, as well as recording a lower level of awareness for safety-related certification schemes [53].\n\nAll six studies cover consumer interest in and preference for health-related statements associated with EVOO products. Krystallis and Nees [53] pointed out that Greek consumers value health-related statements more than those indicating sustainable production practices (e.g., organic) when selecting EVOO products. Although, health-related statements recorded lower relevance when compared to information on the place of origin of the product. Greek consumers interested in health-related statements were young, educated, wealthy consumers of both genders with low average family size, approximately 2.8 members. Further, scholars in [54] pointed out that consumers perceive EVOO as the healthiest OO compared to other commercial OO categories surveying Greek consumers.\n\nComparable results from those obtained by Krystallis and Nees [53] were found by [32,36] when investigating Italian consumer preferences for EVOO products associated with a wide set of product attributes. The authors pointed out that the health-related statement is the second product attribute, after the one indicating the origin of the product, in orienting consumers’ preferences for EVOO. Boncinelli et al. [7] suggested that health-related statements play a marginal role in consumers’ EVOO choices. Such statements are of interest to half of the consumers surveyed, who would select an EVOO with health-related statements conditionally upon the product that already bears statements as organic and geographical indications. Instead, Cavallo et al. [9] found that a discounted price associated with an EVOO bearing a health-related statement suggests that consumers may find it difficult to process such information and for them to reject it. No attempt to segment consumers interested in health-related disclosure on the base of their social economics and psychographic characteristics were found in studies based in Italy.\n\nBased on the literature reviewed, we conclude that the safety aspect of an EVOO product is taken for granted and that safety-related information is of no or limited interest to consumers selecting EVOO products. Instead, health-related statements are of interest, at least for a share of EVOO consumers, likely those consumers with a higher income or education as well as those with more of an interest in health. Related to the literature on health-related statements, it is worth mentioning that the heterogeneity of the findings available in the literature is large because authors have tested consumers’ preferences for a broad variety of health-related statements, for instance, terms such as “Best before”, “Keep until instructions”, “Additives free”, “Cholesterol free” [53], “Health claim” [7,36], “Substances beneficial for health” [32], and “Nutritional label” [9]. Additionally, result variations may depend on the sample used in the analysis, as three out of six cases were composed of less than 200 hundred observations collected in selected regions of Italy [9,36] and Greece [53]. Thus, findings may provide a partial picture of the impact of health-related statements on consumer preferences for EVOO."
