        "text": "Scientific research has indicated olive oil can assist in the fight against heart disease, cancer, diabetes and Alzheimers. The polyphenols in olive oil are antioxidants, which have also been shown to help fight diseases including some type of cancers. Olive oil is also known as one of the best sources of monounsaturated fatty acids, a type of fat that has been shown to improve blood cholesterol levels.\n\nExtra Virgin olive oil is the highest quality of olive oil available. Olive oil is considered extra virgin when it has been produced by a simple pressing of the olives – without any other processes – which allows it to provide the highest level of health benefits. Click here for the official definition of extra virgin olive oil.\n\nWhen buying extra virgin olive oil, consumers should look for products packaged in dark glass bottles or other containers that protect it from light. The label should clearly indicate where the olives were grown, their harvest date, the oil’s grade, and a “best by” date. “Best by” dates are usually one to two years from the time the oil was bottled. With olive oil – unlike wine – freshness is important.\n\nArbequina, Koroneiki, and Frantoio are just three examples of hundreds of varieties of olives grown for milling into olive oil. Each olive variety has its own size and color characteristics and distinct flavors. Differences among the varieties of olives are similar to the differences among the varieties of grapes used to produce the different flavors in wines.\n\nAs long as its stored away from heat and light, an unopened bottle of high quality extra virgin olive oil may last up to two years from the date it was bottled. More and more producers are now scientifically testing their oil to provide trusted “best by” dates for consumers on each container. Once opened, the oil should be used within a few months.\n\nYou can use extra virgin olive oil for all of your cooking, food preparation, and even baking. Scientific testing has shown high quality extra virgin olive oil is among the most versatile cooking oils available. According to Dr. Mary Flynn, “High quality extra virgin olive oil can be heated to 420°F before it reaches smoke-point (i.e. begins to smoke and starts to form unhealthy compounds), which is higher than nearly every other vegetable oil. Olive oil is much more stable when heated compared to most vegetable oil.”\n\nWhether dipped, drizzled, sautéed or fried, extra virgin olive oil can be a healthy ingredient in any meal or snack. It can even be a healthy and tasty substitute for butter in baking and other preparations.\n\nDr. Mary Flynn writes “Apart from the considerable health benefits of extra virgin olive oil, when you work out the cost of olive oil per tablespoon, it's actually quite inexpensive. A 17 fl. oz bottle of olive oil contains approximately 32 tablespoons, and a liter contains 64 tablespoons. Many extra virgin olive oils cost less than 30 cents per tablespoon, so my recommended dose of 3 tablespoons of oil per meal costs 90 cents.” Mary Flynn, PhD, RD is Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine at Brown University’s Alpert Medical School in Providence, Rhode Island.1"
