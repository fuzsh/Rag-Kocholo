        "text": "What is Extra Virgin Olive Oil?\n\nThe term “Extra Virgin Olive Oil” is worded very specifically. It is a classification of olive oil. In order to be called Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO), the product needs to have been cold-pressed, one time. It needs to never have been heated or refined in any way, and it must not have any additives or have any other kinds of oils mixed in with it.\n\nWhen fresh, EVOO has a flavour profile specific to each species of olive tree that was harvested to form the oil. Its flavour can typically be described as grassy, fruity, or even floral, with a bitter characteristic, and then a peppery aftertaste.\n\nWhen combined with other foods or ingredients, EVOO acts as an flavour-enhancer, richly provoking the natural flavours in food. It is a favourite among chefs due to its stability when cooking; many chefs choose to fry in it, and then add butter for flavour if desired, as the EVOO stabilizes the butter and increases its smoke point when cooking. From garden-fresh veggies, to bread and cheese, to pasta and sauce, meat and more, EVOO is a wonderful pantry item, pleasing to any palate.\n\nTasting Technique\n\nThere is an entire culture surrounding appreciation of high quality EVOO and, just like wine-tasting, there have been specific techniques developed that are proven to bring out the best in aroma and flavour when tasting olive oil.\n\nNot just for professionals, an awareness of these tasting techniques can help the average consumer discern the quality of their EVOO whether they've purchased from a grove-to-table supplier like us or from a grocery store.\n\nTasting olive oil is also an interesting and rewarding experience! We invite you to come on down to our store for a professional demonstration and tasting experience - no appointment necessary.\n\nClick here for more about Olive Oil Tasting.\n\nSmoke Point\n\nExtra Virgin Olive Oil has a smoke point of 410F according to the most recent study conducted by the International Olive Oil Council. That is approximately med-high heat on your stovetop. EVOO does not break down and form carcinogens, even if its smoke point is exceeded.\n\nA note on how to cook with olive oil, from The International Olive Council (2013):\n\n\"Olive oil is ideal for frying. In proper temperature conditions, without over-heating, it undergoes no substantial structural change and keeps its nutritional value better than other oils, not only because of the antioxidants but also due to its high levels of oleic acid. Its high smoking point (210ºC) is substantially higher than the ideal temperature for frying food (180ºC). Those fats with lower critical points, such as corn and butter, break down at this temperature and form toxic products.\" Click here to read more.\n\nHow are the EVOOs Flavoured?\n\nExtra Virgin Olive Oil, by definition, must have absolutely no additives. Once a flavouring has been added to an EVOO, it must only be called a flavour-infused olive oil, in order to protect the EVOO term.\n\nAt Prairie Oils & Vinegars, we stock EVOO, as well as a huge selection of Infused Olive Oils. The Infused Olive Oils are based on the most mild EVOO of that season's harvest, so that the flavourings shine through. Our ingredients in our flavourings are so simple, they are usually reflected right on the fusti label.\n\nFor example, Lemon Olive Oil includes a mild Extra Virgin Olive Oil and a pure lemon extract. Chipotle Olive Oil uses an extract of natural oils from smoked chipotle peppers. Any of our Infused Olive Oils flavoured with extracts mean they are using the natural oils extracted from the flavouring-ingredient through expression or maceration, not through chemical processes.\n\nThe Butter Olive Oil is one exception, which actually has no butter in it. It is vegan-friendly and dairy-free, making it a perfect choice for those with lactose-free needs. It is made using a patented plant that actually makes the EVOO taste very much like melted, unsalted butter. We invite you to stop in and try it!\n\nPressato\n\nAny Infused Olive Oils using the word \"Pressato\" have been expertly prepared by the co-crushing of olives with other ingredients like herbs, chilies, and other spices. This process creates a singular, high-aroma flavoured olive oil and culinary experience that enhances the organoleptic properties of both the olive oil and the natural oils and aromas of other fresh ingredients co-milled with fresh olives.\n\nBoth the olives and other ingredients are pesticide-free and employ organic farming practices, which are closely monitored by a field of our own experts from seed to tank. This intricate and precise process involves the simultaneous harvesting of olives alongside other freshly picked ingredients such as citrus, vegetables, and herbs. Timing is of the essence, as the ingredients need to be brought to the mill within three hours (to stop ripening and avoid oxidation) following harvest in order to be quickly co-milled before any ripening occurs. The extracted end result is tasted, evaluated, and lab tested to ensure only the highest quality of flavour Infused Olive Oils reach your table.\n\nIs Extra Virgin Olive Oil Healthy?\n\nYes, it is! In fact, the healthful properties of this remarkable substance are substantial. It is a healthy source of fat, lowers bad while upping good cholesterol, rejuvenates and protects our skin, possesses pain-reducing anti-inflammatories, and much more. So it can be an excellent choice to add to our diet!\n\nPlease click here to visit our Health Information page to read more!\n\nOur Supplier\n\nOur supplier for our vinegars and most of our oils is a company called MillPress Imports.\n\nMillPress Imports is a privately held, family-owned and operated business primarily focused on sourcing, importing and bottling the finest lots of fresh Extra Virgin Olive Oil and vinegar products. Leveraging their deep industry expertise, their team is on the cutting edge of agriculture, product testing, organoleptic ratings, food safety and manufacturing."
