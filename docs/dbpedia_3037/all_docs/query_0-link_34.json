        "text": "Peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, fish, soy, dairy, wheat, eggs, and sesame are not present in our California Olive Ranch production facility where our oil is stored and bottled. Extra Virgin Olive Oil is also naturally gluten free.\n\nOther oils bottled at our facility are refined avocado and canola oil (the refining process pulls out proteins, which takes out any allergenic compounds, but we still have processes in place to avoid cross-contamination) and other flavorings.\n\nOur Lucini items are made at our facility as well as co-packer facilities. Some Lucini products are bottled in facilities where sunflower oil is present. Our pasta sauces and pesto sauces are produced in a facility that handles milk, fish, tree nuts, eggs and wheat. Our dressing and marinade products are produced in a facility that handles milk, tree nuts, wheat, sesame, and soy.\n\nWe ensure that all our co-packer manufacturers follow the same standards to uphold the same minimal cross contamination risk in any products, including stringent policies to prevent cross-contamination. These include, but not limited to, storage guidelines, sanitation practices, and cleaning verification (allergen testing). All equipment is tested for allergens prior to starting the canning or bottling process and the equipment and structural design of the facility minimizes the introduction of hazards and human contact. GMPs address potential allergen cross-contamination from personnel to ensure they are educated on this type of hazard and take every precaution to prevent this from occurring."
