        "text": "Spotlight Series: All About Italian Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)\n\nOlive oil is at the heart of nearly every Italian dish—especially the full-flavored, unrefined variety known as extra virgin olive oil.\n\nExtra virgin olive oil is a superior drizzling condiment and cooking oil made from the first cold pressing of select olives. This high-quality olive oil boasts the richest olive flavor and a full cast of health benefits. More than just a simple pantry staple, extra virgin olive oil is a healthy and transformative ingredient that is ready to upgrade your everyday creations: from salad dressings and marinades to baked goods and even the simple, yet iconic bread-dipping appetizer of EVOO and herbs.\n\nLearn more about this exquisite Italian olive oil such as what defines an “extra virgin” olive oil, how to look for a great bottle of olive oil at the grocery store, how to store extra virgin olive oil, how it is used in the kitchen and more.\n\nShop DeLallo Extra Virgin Olive Oil:\n\nWhat Is Extra Virgin Olive Oil? What Does It Really Mean?\n\nExtra virgin olive oil is a superior olive oil that is made by the first, cold pressing of the olive fruit. Unlike other varieties (pure olive oil and extra light olive oil), high heat and chemicals are not used to extract the oil. This results in an olive that boasts a fresh, raw olive flavor with a golden-green hue. Extra virgin olive oil is best used in its raw form for dressing, drizzling and as the famous Italian bread-dipping appetizer.\n\nWhat Does “Extra Virgin” Mean?\n\nTo be considered an authentic extra virgin olive oil, an olive oil must be extracted by cold pressing. This means the extraction of the oil from the olive pulp must be done at or below 80°F (27°C) hence the term “cold-pressed.” It cannot be extracted with high heat or chemicals. These two methods (heat and chemicals) actually degrade the oil, taking away from its bold flavor and raw quality. Because extra virgin olive oil is pressed in its raw form, it retains all of its flavor as well as nutritional and health benefits, such as natural antioxidants and polyunsaturated fats (fatty acids).\n\nTo go deeper, olive oil that derives from this pressing (extraction) is analyzed in two ways to be considered “extra virgin”:\n\nSensory/Organoleptic: Certified testers review the oil for any negative attributes, of which there can be many. If a negative aroma or flavor is detected, the oil cannot be bottled as a raw, cold-pressed product. This means it will need to be refined and cannot be classified as “extra virgin.” Olive oil is tested for three specific flavor characteristics: fruitiness, spiciness and bitterness. These are rated on a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 is the best.\n\nChemical: In certified laboratories, olive oil is reviewed for its chemical composition. If the olive oil fails any of these tests, it cannot be classified as “extra virgin.” One of the most important tests checks the oleic acidity, which needs to be below .8% at the time of pressing.\n\nWhat Makes Extra Virgin Olive Oil So Special?\n\nThere are many reasons to explain why extra virgin olive oil is so special. To begin, it is an “extra virgin” oil, meaning that it is extracted from the olive fruit without the use of chemicals or heat. This preserves its most bold, fresh flavor, making it an excellent oil for using in its raw form as a drizzle, dip, dressing, etc. Cold pressing also helps the oil to retain its health benefits. EVOO is loaded with “good fats,” or unsaturated fats, that have been proven to lower the risk of heart disease. Olives are rich in the antioxidant Vitamin E, which helps shield the body from disease, as well as oleuropein—an antioxidant with anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. All of these characteristics make EVOO an exceptional oil, a healthful oil for dressing, drizzling, baking and sautéing.\n\nWhere Does DeLallo Italian Extra Virgin Olive Oil Come From?\n\nDeLallo Extra Virgin Olive Oils come from Italy. Olives are grown, harvested, pressed and bottled. The olives used in DeLallo Private Reserved Extra Virgin Olive Oil come from family-owned orchards in Sicily.\n\nReasons You’ll Love Our Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nThere are so many reasons to love DeLallo Extra Virgin Olive Oil.

Our Extra Virgin Olive Oil doesn’t just taste good, it’s good for you too. A cornerstone of the famously healthy Mediterranean diet, extra virgin olive oil is loaded with heart-healthy fats and antioxidants that are responsible for decreasing inflammation in the body.\n\nWhy DeLallo Extra Virgin Olive Oil?\n\nWith so many to choose from, it’s hard to know which extra virgin olive oil should make it into your shopping cart at the grocery store. Is it fresh? Is it authentic? Is it really from the country it claims to be? You shouldn’t need to be a detective to read a label and know what you’re getting.\n\nDeLallo Extra Virgin Olive Oil is an authentic Italian product from a single country of origin. This means olives are grown, harvested, pressed and bottled in Italy.\n\nBecause olives come from a single country of origin, our oil is produced with a focus on quality and consistency, rather than cost.

Click here to view our latest verification results.\n\nMany so-called “extra virgin” olive oils are blends of substandard olive oils and some aren’t even the Italian product they say they are. For instance, just because an oil is bottled in a particular country, it doesn’t mean that the olives are grown in that country.\n\nExtra virgin olive oils from olives of a single country or origin and even more narrowly from a particular region or single variety are produced for quality. Conversely extra virgin olive oils made from a blend of these oils from multiple countries are done so to achieve a price, not quality.\n\nBy law, the country or countries of origin of the oils that compose an Extra Virgin Olive Oil must be stated on the label or lid. Look for them before making a purchase.\n\nHow To Store Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nExtra virgin olive oil is a raw delicacy that requires proper storage to keep it tasting its best. To retain its robust olive flavor and aroma, remember one simple acronym, or word, to remember these four easy steps: H.A.L.T.\n\nHEAT: Keep your oil away from any source of heat. Store in a cool, dry cupboard, never by or above your oven.\n\nAIR: Seal olive oil bottles tightly. Allowing air into your oil causes it to break down and degrade quickly.\n\nLIGHT: Whether it be natural or otherwise, light will damage your oil. Properly store your oil in a dark place, like a cupboard, until its next usage to prevent exposure.\n\nTIME: Unlike wine, extra virgin olive oil does not get better with age. The fresher the olive oil, the better, so only stock up on enough oil to last you for a month or two of use.\n\nExtra Virgin Olive Oil: FAQ\n\nWhat Type Of Olives Are Used To Make DeLallo Extra Virgin Olive Oil?\n\nDeLallo selects only the finest Italian olives for our authentic EVOO. Olives are grown, harvested, pressed and bottled in Italy, to create exquisite oil that boasts a single country of origin. These olives are chosen for their complementary flavors and a final product that is fruity, bitter and pleasantly peppery with notes of creamy artichoke and green apple. Our cold-pressed, unrefined Extra Virgin Olive Oil exceeds the stringent quality standards set by the IOC (International Olive Council). The results speak for themselves: a superior 100% Italian extra olive oil unrivaled in quality and consistency of flavor, color, texture and freshness.\n\nIs DeLallo Extra Virgin Olive Oil Cold Pressed?\n\nYes, DeLallo Extra Virgin Olive Oil is made with the first cold pressing of the olive fruit. No heat or chemicals are used to create our authentic, 100% Italian Extra Virgin Olive OIl.\n\nIs DeLallo Extra Virgin Olive Oil Single Origin Sourced?\n\nYes, every olive chosen for our exquisite Extra Virgin Olive Oil is grown, harvested and pressed in Italy.\n\nIs Extra Virgin Olive Oil Good For You?\n\nOlives are good for you, thus so is its raw, cold pressed oil. Olives are a vital component of the famous Mediterranean diet. Olives and their oil are said to contain “good fats.” But what are those? Good fats are unsaturated fats that are said to lower bad cholesterol (LDL) and boost good cholesterol (HDL). Olives are an excellent source of monounsaturated fat, or oleic acid, which is said to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, ultimately lowering the risk of heart disease. Moreover, olives are unique when it comes to the ratio of quality fat, as they boast a lot of bang for their buck—high in good fat, low in carbs and with few calories.\n\nBelieve it or not, our bodies need fat. Besides providing us with a good amount of energy in its concentrated calories and allowing us to feel fuller, fat is responsible for growth and healthy skin. Without fat, say goodbye to your metabolism and the Vitamins (A, D, E and K).\n\nAs far as vitamins and nutrients, olives are rich in Vitamin E, a fat-soluable antioxidant that helps shield bodies from disease. They also contain antioxidants like oleuropein. Exclusive to olives, oleuropein is said to help with heart health—these benefits along with anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties.\n\nIs DeLallo Extra Virgin Olive Oil Mixed With Other Oils (I.E. Vegetable, Etc.)?\n\nNo, DeLallo Extra Virgin Olive Oil is 100% olive oil. There are no other oils added.\n\nCan I Cook With Extra Virgin Olive Oil?\n\nYes, extra virgin olive oil is a healthy substitute for many everyday cooking oils. While its fresh, bold olive flavor shines best in raw applications, like dressings and drizzles, EVOO can be used for sautéeing, pan frying, braising, roasting and baking.\n\nWhat Is The Smoke Point Of Delallo Extra Virgin Olive Oil?\n\nThe smoke point of any oil fluctuates due to varying factors such as freshness and acidity), but generally speaking, the smoke point of extra virgin olive oil is a range of 350˚F to 410˚F.\n\nCan I Fry With Extra Virgin Olive Oil?\n\nIt is not recommended to fry using extra virgin olive oil. Not only is EVOO best enjoyed in its raw form, where its fresh flavor can shine, but it also has a lower smoke point than frying oils. This means it burns more quickly than refined cooking oils and loses many of its good characteristics. It is recommended that you use Pure Olive Oil for frying, as it has a higher smoke point.\n\nCan I Bake With Extra Virgin Olive Oil?\n\nYes, extra virgin olive oil is a healthier substitute for butter and vegetable oils in many baked goods such as cakes, cookies and breads. Extra virgin olive oil gives baked goods a moist texture and a subtle flavor. There are certain ingredients that pair up better with the light olive flavor: nuts, rosemary and citrus fruits —to name a few. For an olive oil with a more neutral flavor, we recommend Extra Light Olive Oil or Pure Olive Oil for baking.\n\nCheck out your individual recipes to make sure that extra virgin olive oil is a suitable substitute.\n\nDoes Extra Virgin Olive Oil Expire?\n\nTypically, extra virgin olive oil is best consumed within 18-24 months after bottling. As soon as a bottle of olive oil is opened, it begins to degrade (by heat, light and air.) This is why we recommend purchasing the amount of olive oil you plan to use within a month or two.\n\nHow Do I Recognize Impure and Inauthentic Extra Virgin Olive Oil?\n\nIf you’re wondering how you can tell if an extra virgin olive oil is authentic, all the information that you need is on the label. Avoid any terms like “extra light,” “pure” or “pomace.” These refer to olive oils that have been refined with chemicals or heat. These are not cold pressed oils. The ingredient list should include nothing more than the olive oil itself—no additional oils or preservatives. The label should include a batch date (bottled or harvest date), not the same as an expiration date. Without this, you could be buying a very old product. Check the origin. Remember: Just because an oil is bottled in one country doesn’t mean the olives for that oil come from the same country. This may denote a lengthy time period between harvest and bottling. Scan the label for seals from third-party certifiers.\n\nExtra Virgin Olive Oil Vs Olive Oil - What Is The Difference?\n\nExtra virgin olive oil is a type of olive oil that is made by the first cold pressing of olives. If a bottle is simply labeled “olive oil” it is probably referring to “pure” olive oil. This oil is made by using heat or chemicals to extract and refine the oil. Pure olive oil has a more neutral flavor due to this processing. It also has a higher smoke point, which makes it better for high-heat frying. On the other hand, extra virgin olive oil retains its bold, raw olive flavor and usually is darker in color.\n\nExtra Virgin Olive Oil Vs Extra Light Olive Oil - What Is The Difference?\n\nThe difference between extra virgin olive oil and extra light olive oil is the level of processing used to create each. Extra virgin olive oil is made by the first cold pressing of the olive fruit. Extra light olive oil is made with heat and/or chemicals, which gives it a pale golden hue and a neutral flavor unlike the intense olive flavor of extra virgin olive oil. Extra light olive oil is super mild, making it a good choice for cooking and baking where a neutral flavor is desired.\n\nExtra Virgin Olive Oil Vs Castelvetrano Extra Virgin Olive Oil - What Is The Difference?\n\nDeLallo Extra Virgin Olive Oil and DeLallo Castelvetrano Extra Virgin Olive Oil are both raw olive oils made from the first cold pressing of the olive fruit. The difference is in the olives used to create each. While our traditional EVOO is made with a group of Italian olives chosen for their complementary flavor profiles, our Castelvetrano EVOO is made exclusively with the Sicilian Castelvetrano olive, as the name implies. Unlike the glass bottle of our signature Extra Virgin Olive Oil, our Castelvetrano Extra Virgin Olive Oil comes in a chef-inspired squeeze bottle for convenience in everyday cooking."
