        "text": "From Castelvetrano to Kalamata, rich in history and tradition, our olives are firm to the bite with meaty flesh and a resonant, lingering aroma. Monte Pollino olives have an exceptional briny flavor you will enjoy!\n\nAfter being sorted and washed, the olives are cured in a brine of water and salt. After 90 to 120 days, our olives become savory and crunchy. They are then drained, washed, and jarred alla Contadina \"peasant style\" in extra virgin olive oil.\n\nDistinctive Ingredient: 100% Italian olives grown in Abruzzo\n\nServing Suggestions: Enjoy our olives with a vegetable dish, pasta dish, or as a side to your meal. You can enjoy them straight from the jar, one by one, or add them as an integral part of any antipasto platter. Dot focaccia dough with olives before baking, this is a wonderful item to have in your pantry.\n\nSource and Origin: Abruzzo, Italy"
