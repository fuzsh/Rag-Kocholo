        "text": "Spain is the largest producer of olive oil in the world, its seemingly endless olive groves account for nearly half of the world’s production.\n\nMost Spanish oil comes from olives grown in the vast groves that spread across the Andalucian countryside where the hot sun beats down on the groves and boosts the yields. Typically the olive oil is sweet and fruity with low levels of bitterness and pepper. The Catalonia, Extramadura and La Mancha regions also produce considerable quantities of delicate oil.\n\nMost of the olive oils and extra virgin olive oils in the supermarket shelves are blends of oils from different countries.\n\nThe very best and purest form of olive oil is extra virgin which is stored or bottled immediately after pressing, just as it is. To obtain this prestigious classification however, the olive oil must undergo a range of stringent tests to ensure that its acidity levels are below 0.8%. All oils above this limit are sent to a refinery and blended with extra virgin olive oils to add flavour, the resulting product is known as standard olive oil.\n\nSome refined olive oils are further blended to obtain a milder flavour, like Filippo Berio’s Mild & Light olive oils, making them ideal for frying and baking with no discernable “olive oil” taste.\n\nOther types of refined olive oils are produced, not from the oil which comes out of the milling process but from the olive paste that remains. This residue, or pomace, contains a small amount of oil which is removed with the use of solvents. The resulting oil is then refined and blended in the same way as ordinary olive oil to make olive pomace oil."
