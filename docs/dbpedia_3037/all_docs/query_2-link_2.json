If both re-tests fail, you will only need to pay for the cost of the sensory re-test. This can vary from £300 to £600.\n\nIf you fail an inspection at any stage of olive oil production, including any re-test, APHA may issue you with a compliance notice.\n\nThe compliance notice will tell you what’s wrong, what you must do to fix the problem, and how long you have to do this. You could be prosecuted if you do not comply with the notice.\n\nAppeal against an inspection decision\n\nYou can email APHA oliveoilcompliance@apha.gov.uk to ask them to review their decision if you disagree with it. If you’re not happy with their response, you can appeal against the decision.\n\nFor appeals in England or Wales, your appeal must arrive within 28 days from the date on the compliance notice. For Scotland or Northern Ireland, your compliance notice will tell you what date you must appeal by.\n\nIn England or Wales, contact the General Regulatory Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal.\n\nIn Scotland, contact the relevant sheriff court.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, contact the relevant magistrates court.\n\nIf you have a question about olive oil inspections, email APHA oliveoilcompliance@apha.gov.uk."
