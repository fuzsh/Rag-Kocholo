        "text": "For consumers seeking extra assurance of olive oil quality, here is a list of the olive oils that are enrolled in the North American Olive Oil Association's (NAOOA's) Certified Olive Oil Seal program for random testing and certification.\n\nThe NAOOA olive oil certification program is the nation's largest and most complete olive oil testing and certification program. We purchase olive oils from supermarkets in the USA and Canada and test them multiple times per year for adherence to the physico-chemical purity and quality standards set by the International Olive Council (IOC).\n\nOur list of certified olive oil changes on a regular basis. Please refer to our master list of certified olive oils for an up to date list.\n\nBrands that are part of the NAOOA Certified Seal program may bear this mark in either black and white or color. It is also possible that a product may be certified, but choose not to put the seal on the label (check out the FAQ on the seal program below).\n\nAs of June 15, 2024, the list is as follows:\n\nAldi\n\nCarlini Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nCarlini Olive Oil\n\nSimply Nature Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nSicilian PDO Certified Val Di Mazara Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nBotticelli\n\nBotticelli Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nColavita\n\nColavita Premium Selection Olive Oil\n\nColavita Premium Italian Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nColavita Mediterranean Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nColavita 100% Greek Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Premium World Selection\n\nColavita 100% Spanish Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Premium World Selection\n\nColavita Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nColavita Olive Oil\n\nFilippo Berio\n\nFilippo Berio Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nFilippo Berio Extra Virgin Olive Oil Delicato\n\nFilippo Berio Extra Virgin Olive Oil Robusto\n\nFilippo Berio Light-Tasting Olive Oil\n\nFilippo Berio Olive Oil\n\nFilippo Berio Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nFilippo Berio 100% Italian Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nGoya\n\nGoya Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nGoya Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nGoya Unico Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nGoya Puro Olive Oil\n\nGoya Light-Tasting Olive Oil\n\nIliada\n\nIliada Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nLa Tourangelle\n\nLa Tourangelle Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nLa Tourangelle Organic Smooth & Fruity Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nLa Tourangelle Organic Bright & Peppery Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nMoresh\n\nMoresh Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nNapa Valley Naturals\n\nNapa Valley Naturals Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nOlitalia\n\nOlitalia Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nOrigin 846\n\nOrigin 846 Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nPompeian\n\nPompeian Extra Virgin Olive Oil Robust\n\nPompeian Extra Virgin Olive Oil Smooth\n\nPompeian Spanish Bold Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nPompeian Organic Smooth Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nPompeian Organic Robust Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nPompeian Mild-Tasting Olive Oil\n\nPompeian Rich-Tasting Olive Oil\n\nPompeian Early Harvest Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nPompeian Light Tasting Olive Oil\n\nPompeian Made Easy - Drizzle\n\nPompeian Made Easy - Bake\n\nPompeian Made Easy - Fry\n\nPompeian Made Easy - Saute\n\nPompeian November Moon Extra Virgin Olive Oil 500ml\n\nPompeian Familia Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil 500ml\n\nPompeian Three Branches Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nPompeian California Dream Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nPompeian 100% Spanish Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nPrimal Kitchen\n\nPrimal Kitchen Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nSprouts\n\nSprouts Farmers Market Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nSprouts Extra Virgin Olive Oil of Italy\n\nSprouts Extra Virgin Olive Oil of Greece\n\nSprouts Extra Virgin Olive Oil of Spain\n\nSprouts Farmers Market Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nScalifani\n\nSclafani Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nStar\n\nStar Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nStar Original Olive Oil\n\nStar Extra Light Tasting Olive Oil\n\nStar Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nStar Robust Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nTerra Delyssa\n\nTerra Delyssa Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nTerra Delyssa Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nWhole Foods\n\nWhole Foods Market Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Italy\n\nWhole Foods Market Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Seville\n\nWhole Foods Market Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Greece\n\nWhole Foods Market Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Portugal\n\nWhole Foods Market Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Morocco\n\n365 Spanish Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\n365 Greek Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\n365 Italian Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\n365 Italian Extra Virgin Olive Oil - Unfiltered\n\n365 Mediterranean Blend Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\n365 Mediterranean Blend Extra Virgin Olive Oil - Organic\n\nZoe\n\nZoe Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nZoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nFAQ\n\nHow does the NAOOA Certified Seal Program work?\n\nParticipants in the NAOOA Certified Seal Program must agree to have us randomly test their products, which we sample from store shelves, and submit the samples to certified independent laboratories. The oils are tested to ensure that they meet or exceed the physico-chemical standards set by the International Olive Council to ascertain purity and quality. Participants pay a fee to participate in the program and license the NAOOA Certified Seal for use on their packaging. It does not mean that we test every bottle or even every lot. However, the penalty for getting caught is severe. If we can confirm that a product we have tested is not authentic, the company is required to conduct a recall of the licensed products from all stores across North America.\n\nDo you test all brands?\n\nNo. We only test bottles of companies that agree to take part in the program. The program is currently only open to members of the North American Olive Oil Association.\n\nDoes the fact that an olive oil does not have your seal mean that the olive oil is fake?\n\nThe answer is emphatically no. According to a study conducted by scientists from the FDA in a study published in 2015 the risk of purchasing a bottle of adulterated EVOO is low (less than 5%). The scientists randomly sampled 88 bottles of EVOO that they purchased from supermarkets and online stores and did not find a single instance of adulteration. The FDA’s findings mirror the results of the NAOOA's robust monitoring efforts, which sampled an average of close to 200 olive oils annually directly from retail shelves for 20 years. So even if a product does not have a certification seal, you should feel confident you are getting authentic products, especially if you buy from a retailer you trust, select a brand you know, and/or do not pay a price that is “too-good-to-be-true.”\n\nThe brand I usually buy does not have your seal…when will you test it?\n\nWe only test brands that agree to be part of our program. Please inquire with the brand and suggest that they might join.\n\nI just purchased a bottle from a company whose name is listed on your webpage as a certified brand, but the bottle does not have the seal on the label. Does that mean it is not authentic?\n\nNo. There are a couple of reasons why this may be the case. First, the AboutOliveOil.org Quality Seal program is product specific—not company specific. Companies have to pay the fee for each separate named product. A company might agree to pay the fee for their best-selling item, e.g., “Premium EVOO,” but not for a product that does not have wide distribution or high sales, e.g. “Organic Limited Edition EVOO.”\n\nSecond, companies in the program are not required to put the NAOOA Certified seal on their labels. Many are content just to have the seal listed on the website or share the information with retailers because labels get crowded, and they may wish to use the space for other information.\n\nBut what about news reports from foreign countries about seizures of adulterated olive oil and related arrests?\n\nThere’s a reason why we hear about those problems in Europe but not here. American consumers can take comfort in knowing European Union (EU) member states aggressively monitor and control exports of olive oil to the U.S., which is their most important market. They want to protect the integrity of one of their most important agricultural products. Anyone found trying to export adulterated olive oil will end up in jail. And the vigilance has paid off. So, if a bad actor in an EU country wants to play games with olive oil, it’s a lot easier to get away with it if they keep their scheme within the open EU borders.\n\nWhat specific controls are in place in exporting countries to protect the integrity of oils coming to the United States?\n\nAll olive oil produced in EU member states, which includes more than 80% of the olive oil consumed by Americans, is legally required to undergo risk analysis and is subject to controls to check for authenticity and conformity with labeling rules at every stage of marketing, including before they are exported.\n\nFor example, Spain, which produces more than half of the world’s olive oil and is the leading exporter to the United States, takes the following steps:\n\nAll exporting companies must be registered in the EU Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) system to be approved to export goods. To ensure accountability, an entity can’t have more than one EORI number, which helps maintain an accurate export history database to track performance over time.\n\nSpain has three different points of inspection and analysis:\n\nThere are 17 autonomous communities that make up Spain, and they each conduct inspections of olive oil in the manufacturing facilities where it’s produced.\n\nSpain’s Official Service of Surveillance, Certification and Technical Assistance of Foreign Trade (SOIVRE) samples olive oil to be exported and conducts physico-chemical and sensory testing to ensure authenticity and quality. Olive oil bound for the United States is specifically targeted for additional testing. SOIVRE also checks olive oil to ensure labeling requirements are met.\n\nSpanish Customs also collects samples and conducts physico-chemical and sensory testing.\n\nThis rigorous process ensures the integrity of olive oil shipped to the United States – Europe’s most important export market.\n\nOther exporting countries outside of the EU also have stringent requirements. For example, Morocco has a rigorous process for inspecting and monitoring each batch of olive oil intended for export. Olive oil can only be released for export once it’s met the trade standard of the destination market. Morocco also has a network of internationally accredited labs specializing in olive oil analysis, which tests for quality and purity.\n\nWhy is there so much written about fake olive oil?\n\nConsumers are passionate about olive oil, and nothing gets them more riled up than to have someone tell them that their beloved olive oil is fake. And that presents an opportunity for people to make money by preying on people’s passion and fear of being cheated. So, when you see a claim about fake olive oil, ask yourself, did the source actually perform any laboratory tests or offer any proof? Was the story about fake olive oil something that was discovered in the U.S.? Is the person making the claim selling something like a competing product or a scandalous book, or simply trolling for clicks or views on an article that will bring them ad dollars and followers on social media platforms?\n\nAs with wine, beer, coffee and other products, there are good, better and best qualities of olive oil to meet every flavor preference and budget. Shop at retailers you trust and buy brands you know. If you want to try a new brand, as with anything you buy, beware of prices that are too good to be true, and always taste the olive oil as soon as you bring it home. If you don’t like it, take it back to the store where you bought it for a refund or exchange it for something you like.\n\nIs it important to look for “first cold-pressed” on an extra virgin olive oil label?\n\nIt may surprise you, but the answer is no! That’s because all extra virgin olive oil is, by definition, “first cold-pressed.” The phrase “first cold-pressed” may distinguish extra virgin olive oil from seed oils (e.g., canola, vegetable, corn, soy, etc.) that are extracted with high heat and/or chemical solvents, but it can’t be used to distinguish one extra virgin olive oil from another. Extra virgin olive oil is produced at temperatures below 80.6°F, which is “cold” compared to high-heat extraction. Similarly, with all extra virgin olive oils, there’s only one extraction (“pressing”), so the word “first” is redundant. Olive oils produced at higher temperatures or from a second pressing will fail to meet the exacting standards for extra virgin olive oil.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the term “pressed” is outdated. It was coined at a time when olive oil was extracted using a hydraulic press. Today, the vast majority of olive oil is extracted using a centrifuge. Click here to check out a video about how olive oil is made.\n\nDoes the fact that my bottle contains olive oils from different countries mean that it’s fake?\n\nCertainly not. There’s nothing inherently wrong with blending olive oils from different countries, which is done to maintain a consistent flavor profile and price point. In fact, there’s no guarantee that a bottle of oil that comes from a single country will be any better than a multi-country blend. Like blends in the wine industry, olive oil blends are created to achieve desired and even award-winning flavor profiles. In fact, it’s not uncommon for blends to win esteemed competitions like the Mario Solinas Quality Award.\n\nAll olive oils produced in European Union member states, which includes more than 80% of the olive oil consumed in the U.S., are required to undergo risk analysis and controls to check for authenticity and conformity with labeling rules at every stage of marketing, including before they are exported.\n\nWhat about olive oil that says it’s extra virgin but it’s not?\n\nTo be clear, adulteration and mislabeling are separate issues. You should have every confidence that your olive oil isn’t adulterated, which means mixed with other types of oil. When a bottle labeled extra virgin (the best quality) is found not to live up to that designation, that’s a more complex subject. There are a few reasons for this:\n\nThe quality of olive oil changes over time and when it’s exposed to light, heat and air. These changes can be outside the producer’s control, as they can take place with the retailer or the consumer.\n\nTaste – which is a key factor in determining the extra virgin grade – is a subjective determination when done by a single taster. For that reason, official grading requires a panel of at least eight expertly trained and calibrated tasters following strict protocols to minimize the impact of subjectivity. Often, sensational journalists claim a bottle of oil is mislabeled without following this protocol and, as a result, many times these claims are unsubstantiated, misleading and overblown.\n\nFor consumers wanting to make sure they get the highest-quality olive oil:"
