        "text": "I read these as\n\nPY20/21\n\nProduction year 2020/2021 - or harvest season, which is typically between October and February, but may vary.\n\nL2022.03.28\n\nLabel date, probably also when the oil was bottled.\n\nE2024.03.28\n\n“Expiry” date, two years after the label date. Note that you should interpret this rather as a best-before date and a quality degradation indicator, not a food safety indicator.\n\nThe numbers don’t tell you anything about the quality of the oil per se (considering you previous questions), but after two years, or rather three, considering the first date, there may be some degradation, which may or may not be noticeable, depending on different factors (e.g. storage conditions).\n\nBecause the comments on other answers have been moved, I am supplying a supplementary answer which addresses the \"quality\" portion of the question.\n\nElsewhere on the label you will see:\n\nPacked in Italy with oils from Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain\n\nThis is what's called a \"blended\" olive oil, which is usually an indicator of lower quality. This is because, while sometimes oil distributors blend to maintain a taste profile, most of the time they do it to lower costs, using whatever are the cheapest available oils. Industry-wide, that includes adding things that aren't olive oil at all. Filippo Berio in particular is known for doing this."
