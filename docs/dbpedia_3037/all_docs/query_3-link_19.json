        "text": "Sorry, millennials — Gen Z is trying to replace avocado toast with “tomato ice toast.”\n\nAnd some say they’re trying too hard to be cool.\n\nGen Z TikTokkers have stunned viewers with their latest controversial concoctions using shaved, frozen vegetables to make savory granitas.\n\nGranita — a simple shaved ice — has long been enjoyed by Italians, typically made by freezing fruit, herbal or spice juices, sometimes adding simple syrup, and scraping the frozen block into a bowl to be eaten.\n\nLemon, cinnamon, jasmine and espresso are some of the most common flavors found on menus around the world.\n\nHowever, Gen Z foodies have put a fresh twist on the sweet treat by freezing whole fruits and vegetables and grating them on top of toast and burrata or mixing the shavings together for an ice-y salad.\n\nIn one of the most viral videos of the savory granitas, chef Eitan Bernath grated a portion of a frozen tomato over an open ball of burrata.\n\nHe then drizzled olive oil and balsamic vinegar on top, finishing with a sprinkle of salt and pepper and a sprig of basil.\n\nBernath seems to approve of his snack with a wide-eyed look.\n\nHowever, viewers had mixed opinions on the creation.\n\n“I don’t know how I feel abt this,” the top comment reads, while another labeled it “REVOLTING.”\n\nSome viewers thought the frozen version of a tomato, basil and burrata salad was “genius” but others simply said, “No.”\n\nThe popular chef has posted more traditional recipes, including watermelon, pineapple, mango and orange — but he has continued to get creative.\n\nHe most recently posted a clip of a “shaved frozen cucumber tomato salad,” made by grating a frozen cucumber, tomato and red onion into a bowl and then drizzling the shavings with olive oil, lemon, salt and pepper.\n\nBernath admitted that it “might sound absolutely insane” but insisted it “turned out to be a delicious savory granita.”\n\n“Is that frozen salad or salad ice cream?” someone asked.\n\n“This way, I’d definitely be a salad person,” another noted.\n\nBut again, not everyone was ready to whip up a bowl for themselves.\n\n“One question…WHY?” a person commented.\n\nTikTok foodie Mads, who goes by @cripanddip online, recently posted a clip claiming she “had to try” the trend that she said seems “so refreshing.”\n\nIn the video, Mads cuts a slice of sourdough bread, rubs it down with a clove of garlic, spreads a ball of burrata on the toast and then grates a little pile of frozen tomato and peach on top.\n\nShe completes the snack with a dribble of white balsamic vinegar and olive oil, a few basil leaves and sprinkles of salt and pepper.\n\nThe food lover was skeptical of the trending treat and complained that iced vegetables bothered her sensitive teeth — but was pleasantly surprised overall.\n\nMads did note that the tomato flavor was very subtle and admitted she would still prefer a pan con tomate — a piece of garlic toast topped with blended tomato, olive oil, salt and pepper.\n\n“I love it,” she decided after a few bites.\n\nThe creative concoctions don’t seem to have taken off beyond social media and don’t appear to have been added to any menus this summer — but that doesn’t mean it won’t still happen."
