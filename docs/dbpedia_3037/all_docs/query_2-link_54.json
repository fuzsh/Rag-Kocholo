        "text": "Olive oil quality assurance\n\nMost consumers associate olive oil with a healthy, often Mediterranean diet and fresh food.\n\nAt the same time, it is not only one of the most popular edible oils, but also one of the most expensive. Therefore, in addition to traditional producing countries such as Greece, Italy or Spain, more and more countries are getting into olive oil production to benefit from the profits.\n\nHowever, the quality of a high quality olive oil depends on many factors, such as a quick processing of the olives after harvest, the olive variety or the production process. Due to its high price, olive oil is also one of the most vulnerable foods to adulteration and food fraud. The most common adulterations observed in extra virgin olive oil are blends of lower quality olive oils, refined olive oils or foreign varieties. In the European Union (EU), olive oil is the only edible oil that has its own regulation defining the requirements for olive oils.\n\nIn order to be successful on the market and to protect one's own olive oil brand, the selection of the right raw materials and suppliers is crucial for producers and traders.\n\nOur olive oil experts at the Hamburg site safeguard your products with comprehensive chemical and sensory tests. Contact uns here!\n\nWhich chemical analyses are suitable for determining identity and purity?\n\nRegulation (EU)2022/2104 defines characteristics of olive oils. The IOC method to be used is assigned to each characteristic in Annex I. The International Olive Council (IOC/ COI) is the world's only international, intergovernmental organization in the field of olive oil and table olives.\n\nFor the determination of purity and identity, these parameters are determined. This serves e.g. to exclude mixtures of extra virgin olive oil with refined olive pomace or other edible oils:\n\nFatty acid spectrum, incl. trans fatty acids\n\nSterols\n\nWaxes\n\nStigmastadienes\n\nTriglycerides, incl. ECN42\n\nContent of erythrodiol and uvaol\n\n2-glycerol monopalmitate\n\nWe perform our analytical methods according to the specifications of the International Olive Council (IOC/ COI).\n\nWhat is the importance of the sensory evaluation of virgin olive oils?\n\nThe sensory or organoleptic evaluation of olive oil is necessary to correctly categorize a product (\"extra virgin\", \"virgin\", \"lampante\"). There are strict specifications for sensory testing.\n\nOur panel of tasters, known as the Olive Oil Panel, is officially recognized and by the International Olive Council (IOC/ COI). In addition, our sensory procedures are accredited according to DIN EN ISO 17025.\n\nThe SGS Olive Oil Panel evaluates both the desired, positive characteristics (attributes) fruitiness, bitterness and pungency as well as sensory defects. These taste defects usually originate from processing and storage errors and thus underpin the results from the chemical analysis. The following off-flavors, among others, must not be present in an extra virgin olive oil: pungent/muddy, musty-moist-earthy, vinous or vinegary, rancid.\n\nThe basis of our sensory evaluation is Commission Regulation (EU) 2022/2105 (Conformity control of marketing standards for olive oil and methods of analysis of characteristics) and the procedure for organoleptic evaluation of virgin olive oil (COI/T.20/Doc. No. 15 (Sensory evaluation of olive oil)."
