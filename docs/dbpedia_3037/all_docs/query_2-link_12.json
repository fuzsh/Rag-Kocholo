        "text": "What are the information to be included on your olive oil label?\n\nAre you an extra virgin olive oil producer and are you going to put your product on the market? Before doing this you need to know which are the essential information you need to include on your labels. Here is a mini guide that helps you understand what are those data that you cannot forget. This article is intended to be an informative guide and not an essential vademecum. We always recommend you to contact an expert to be sure you have created the legally perfect label. In any case, here is the mandatory information for your extra virgin olive oil labels.\n\nSales denomination\n\nEU Reg. 29/2012 art. 3 paragraph 1 defines the denomination of olive oils and extra virgin olive oil in particular. The first mandatory information for extra virgin olive oil labels is the correct name that is: EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL.\n\nNet quantity\n\nThe net quantity of extra virgin olive oil must be expressed in extended form (for example 0.5 liters) or with an abbreviation (0.5 liters without an abbreviation dot). Other indications for volume units other than liter can also be used, such as centiliter (e.g. 50 cl) or milliliter (e.g. 500 ml) in extended or abbreviated form without an abbreviation dot. Remember, however, that extra virgin olive oils sold to the final consumer can be placed in packaging with a maximum capacity of five liters.\n\nConditions of conservation and / or use\n\nFor all foods that require special storage and / or use conditions, these conditions must be clearly indicated on the packaging or on a label attached to it. In the case of extra virgin olive oil, the heat, light and oxygen contained in the air can alter the condition of the product. For this reason it is important to define the correct storage conditions of the product (eg. Store the product in a tightly closed bottle, in a cool and dry place, away from light and heat sources).\n\nName or business name and address of the food business operator\n\nFirst of all, it is necessary to clarify what is meant by this term. The food business operator who is responsible for the information placed on olive oil packaging is the operator under whose name or business name the product is marketed.\n\nBy law, it is mandatory to indicate the name of the company that markets the product and not the name and address of those who produce or pack it. This does not mean that the indication of the manufacturer or packer is prohibited.\n\nIndeed, if you decide to indicate one or more of the other figures, you must pay particular attention to do it correctly. It must be remembered that if you want to indicate the producer of extra virgin olive oil, it is necessary to indicate the company name who actually produced the oil, i.e. the miller who transformed the olives into oil, not the grower or bottler.\n\nCountry of origin\n\nAnother mandatory indication for the extra virgin olive oil label is undoubtedly the designation of origin, that is, the indication of a geographical name.\n\nIf the extra virgin olive oil is produced in Italy, terms such as \"Made in Italy\", \"Origin Italy\" or other equivalent can be used.\n\nThe designation of origin depends on the geographical area in which the olives were harvested and in which the mill where the oil was extracted is located.\n\nNutrition facts label\n\nDetailed nutritional information can be inserted on the back label and repeated in synthetic form on the front label. To find out what is the nutrition facts label, read our article.\n\nBatch\n\nAnother mandatory information for oil labels is the batch to which a foodstuff belongs.\n\nWhere should you enter this mandatory information?\n\nThe mandatory information for oil labels must be entered clearly and clearly visible and legible by the end customer. Obviously, this information must also be indelible.\n\nIn the main visual field of the label, the product name, origin and net quantity must be entered.\n\nIn addition, all other mandatory information for oil labels mentioned above must be placed on the label not necessarily in the main field.\n\nTechnical details to set the correct label\n\nAll the mandatory information mentioned above must be affixed to the food in a prominent place so that it is easily visible, clearly legible. Therefore they must absolutely not be hidden, obscured by other written and graphic indications.\n\nIt is essential to ensure the readability of these elements. For this reason, the characters that are used must have the median part (determined by the height of the x), equal to or greater than 1.2 mm.\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, this article is intended to be a brief tutorial of the mandatory information to be included on oil labels.\n\nWe always recommend you to ask support to an expert in order to avoid unpleasant mistakes.\n\nWe hope you enjoyed this article.
