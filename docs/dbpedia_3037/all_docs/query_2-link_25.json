        "text": "The International Olive Council’s Definition\n\nAccording to the International Olive Council, EVOO is “virgin olive oil which has a free acidity, expressed as oleic acid, of not more than 0.8 grams per 100 grams and the other characteristics of which correspond to those fixed for this category in the 10C standard.”\n\nClearly, this is not a terribly helpful definition for those who are not well versed in olive oil, but it is more than adequate for those who regulate EVOO within the different nations. If you are interested in learning more about the different types of olive oil and definitions, you can check out the International Olive Oil website for more details and explanations of the different types and their many uses. You will get an idea of the standards that many countries and areas that produce EVOO use when determining their own policies.\n\nThe Classifications of Olive Oil\n\nEVOO is considered the purest form of olive oil, but it is certainly not the only king. In the United States, there are five classifications. In terms of classification, EVOO is the highest grade, and it is the one that many professional chefs use, particularly in places like Italy and Greece.\n\nEVOO is the purest and usually the product that people prefer for cooking. It has a better flavor and odor than the other classification. It also tends to be healthier.\n\nVirgin olive oil is the next most commonly used olive oil. It is less costly and for those who don’t know the difference, it can be an acceptable substitute for EVOO.\n\nLampante virgin olive oil is not something that can be sold for consumption. The poor taste and odor make it off-putting enough that people are not likely to attempt to ingest it. Typically, this olive oil is further processed for consumption or is included for other uses.\n\nRefined olive oil is the product of further refining olive oil, but it does not change the initial glyceridic structure of the product. It does not have an odor or flavor.\n\nOlive oil is a blended form of olive oil (usually mixing virgin olive oil and refined olive oil). It is fit for human consumption and can add flavor to many different dishes.\n\nEVOO Specifications\n\nRegardless of what organization or country is defining EVOO, there are certain aspects that are relatively universal. While it is often said to taste better than virgin olive oil, for a product to be labeled EVOO it must meet several requirements for the chemical composition and the method used to produce the oil.\n\nSome EVOO also goes through taste tests to ensure that it does not have any flaws that would require it to be labeled as virgin olive oil. Sometimes the smell or taste can make a product seem inferior, even if it appears to pass many of the other tests."
