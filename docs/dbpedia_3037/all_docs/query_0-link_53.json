        "text": "What does « virgin » mean for vegetable oils ?\n\nThe mention of the word “virgin” in the name of the vegetable oils indicates that oil has been extracted by means that do not change the qualities of the product. If the trade name doesn’t have this mention, this means that the oil has been obtained by refining or by other processes removing the taste, the smell and the color.\n\nThe word “virgin” means that the olive oil is extracted by mechanical means preserving all the qualities of the product (the oil present in the fruit). So this is a pure fruit juice.\n\nA refined olive oil is a lampante oil (which does not fit for consumption) which is processed (chemically and physically) to remove its color, smell and taste. Contrary to other vegetable oils such as sunflower or rapeseed oil, the regulation forbids its sale as it is, it has to be mixed with virgin olive oil. This is then sold with the name “olive oil composed of refined olive oil and virgin olive oil”.\n\nGood to know : we only find this kind of olive oil in some ready-cooked dishes in France but it represents 50% of the Spanish consumption of olive oils.\n\nThe optional mentions\n\nMentions which can help you in your choice :\n\nthe organoleptic characterics : this is the aromatic description of olive oil (there are many different tastes for olive oils as for wines)\n\nthe variety : the mentions of the variety(-ies) used can give you an indication about the origin.\n\nLearn more about the varieties and European Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) !\n\nThe mention “AB” or “issue de l’agriculture biologique” (from organic production) indicates a way of production of olives and an olive oil extraction in accordance to the organic production specifications. This mention does not indicate either a quality or a specific taste.\n\nMentions less important in the choice of an olive oil :\n\nPression à froid / Extraite à froid (cold pressing / cold extraction) : these mentions indicate the system used (pressure / centrifugation or percolation) and an extraction temperature inferior to 27 °C. These mentions do not prejudge of olive oil quality.\n\nThe acidity rate, the peroxide index (…)"
