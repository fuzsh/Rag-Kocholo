        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nDietary oils are essential ingredients in many food products and are widely used for cooking and food processing. In recent years, there was an increase in the demand for edible oils due to the growth of the food industry and the changing dietary habits of consumers [1]. A variety of edible oils are produced from various sources such as nuts, seeds, and fruits, and their nutritional quality can vary greatly [2].\n\nCurrently, there is a lack of a standardized ranking system for edible oils based on their nutritional quality. Producers and consumers are often unaware of the nutritional differences among oils, making it difficult for them to make informed decisions [3]. This results in the production and consumption of oils with lower nutritional quality, which can have negative impacts on public health. Therefore, developing a score for edible oils based on their nutritional quality is of utmost importance, as it would allow consumers to make informed decisions about the oils they use and would encourage producers to improve the nutritional quality of their oils.\n\nFor the moment, there is no universally accepted score to rank edible oils according to their nutritional value. The smoke point score, which measures the smoke point of an oil and classifies edible oils accordingly, is calculated according to the official American Oil Chemists’ Society Cc 9a-48 method [4]. However, this score does not consider the composition of the oils and the recommendations of international organizations responsible for dietary recommendations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) [5,6], European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) [7,8], or the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)/Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [9]. On the other hand, the American Heart Association publishes recommendations for oils based on their fatty acid composition, which can also be used as a guide for ranking edible oils based on their nutritional quality, but never created a score [10].\n\nRecently, Zhao et al. [11] published a model for the evaluation of the nutritional quality of 13 edible vegetable oils commonly used in China. Employing seven evaluation criteria, including saturated fatty acids (SFA), unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), and vitamin E, they found that the highest score was obtained for peony seed oil, while the lowest score belonged to palm oil. However, some components of the oils were out of the analysis, such as polyphenols. In addition, the model relied on the French and Chinese Dietary Reference Intake recommendations only.\n\nIn the present study, we propose a new score based on the Dietary Reference Intake provided by the FAO/WHO [5,6], EFSA [7,8], and USDA/FDA [9], as well as health claims approved by the EFSA [12,13] and USDA/FDA [14,15] in 32 dietary plant oils and animal fats. A ranking system based on nutritional quality would provide a basis for evaluating the health benefits of the oils. This would be beneficial for public health as it would promote the use of oils with higher nutritional quality, reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Furthermore, a ranking system would promote the development of new and healthier oils, contributing to the growth of the food industry.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe use of a score-based system to rank dietary oils based on their nutritional value is important, as it enables food producers and consumers to make informed decisions when selecting and purchasing oils for their products and meals. This would ensure that high-quality and nutritious oils are used in food production and consumed by individuals. The score developed here was based on the RDV of international institutions, such as the FAO/WHO [5,6], EFSA [7,8] and USDA/FDA [9], as well as health claims approved by the EFSA [12,13] and USDA/FDA [14,15].\n\nThe top-ranking oil in the proposed score was VOO, with 100 points due to its unique compositional profile. One of the factors contributing to the positive score for VOO was its high oleic acid content (55–83 g/100 g, according to the IOC commercial standard ref), which is associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease. The FDA approved health claims that suggest the consumption of oils high in oleic acid may help reduce the risk of heart disease when used in place of oils high in saturated fat [16]. The claims also emphasize that oleic acid-containing oils should not increase daily caloric intake and are intended for oils with oleic acid contents above 70% (70 g/100 g). The EU also established a list of permitted health claims for oleic acid-rich oils when replacing saturated fats in the maintenance of normal blood cholesterol levels. However, it does not state the threshold at which to consider a fat as “high-oleic”. VOO also contains other health-promoting compounds, such as linoleic acid, α-linolenic acid, tocopherols, and hydroxytyrosol, which contribute positively to the score. According to the OIC standard, the linoleic acid content should range between 2.5 and 21.0 g/100 g. The mean value used in the present study for the content of linoleic acid in VOO was 12.3, which guaranteed 3 points in the score. Similarly, the α-linolenic content in this oil was above the threshold, adding 2 points more to the score, and the tocopherol content contributed 3 more points. In contrast, the phytosterol content was not high enough to add up points, and VOO received negative points due to its lack of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of the n-3 series and the presence of SFA. According to the IOC commercial standard, the SFA content of VOO ranges from 9 to 25 g/100 g. The mean content used to evaluate VOO in the present study was 16.6, which is higher than the concentration used as criterion (9 g/100 g).\n\nFinally, it is noteworthy that VOO is the only fat that contains hydroxytyrosol in enough of a concentration to add points to the score. Hydroxytyrosol and its derivatives also have a health claim approved by the EFSA for olive oil, as a cause and effect relationship was established between the consumption of olive oil and the protection of LDL particles from oxidative damage [17]. However, only VOO, and not common and pomace olive oils, presented concentrations of polyphenols high enough to reach the minimum concentration stated in the claim (5 mg per 20 mL of oil). Common and pomace olive oils, which share the same fatty acid composition with VOO, did not present concentrations of polyphenols high enough to add points in the score. It is important to note that these olive oils are submitted to a refining process that removes some of the beneficial minor components present in VOO.\n\nOlive oil, and particularly VOO, is widely studied for its potential health benefits, particularly in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. A meta-analysis conducted in 2019 showed that high-phenolic extra virgin olive oil (VOO) was effective in reducing LDL-cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and oxidized LDL-cholesterol levels [18]. In addition, a systematic review by the USDA reported that a Mediterranean-style diet, including olive oil, was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality in nearly all studies examined [19]. A part of the health benefits of VOO is attributed to its high content of polyphenols, which were shown to improve plasma concentrations of malondialdehyde, oxidized LDL, total cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol in clinical trials [20]. These effects appear to be maintained even when the oil is used for cooking [19]. However, some researchers noted that the evidence is still limited and that more large clinical trials are needed to confirm these benefits [21]. While the evidence is still emerging, the consumption of VOO as part of a healthy diet showed promise in promoting cardiovascular health and reducing the risk of all-cause mortality.\n\nFlaxseed oil, which ranked second after VOO and ahead of the other olive oils (common and pomace), is known for its high content of α-linolenic acid, similarly to chia and sacha-inchi oils. Flaxseed oil is also richer in tocopherols and has a lower level of SFA compared to other oils. Numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses investigated the health benefits of consuming flaxseed oil. A recent systematic review of randomized clinical trials in patients with metabolic syndrome and related disorders reported that flaxseed oil consumption significantly reduced systolic blood pressure, but not diastolic blood pressure [22]. Additionally, Musazadeh et al. [23] conducted a meta-analysis that aimed to determine the impact of flaxseed oil on biomarkers of oxidative stress, and found a significant decrease in malondialdehyde levels and an increase in total antioxidant capacity levels, indicating that it may be useful in reducing oxidative stress and strengthening the antioxidant defense system in humans.\n\nThe ranking of vegetable oils based on their content in the components studied revealed that all oils, except for margarine and coconut oil, scored above 50. One notable case was palm oil, which was previously associated with adverse cardiovascular health outcomes, as it was reported that it increased LDL-cholesterol levels compared to vegetable oils low in saturated fat [24]. However, more recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses showed only modest increases in serum lipids [25] or no increase at all when compared to oils rich in UFA [26].\n\nAfter calculating percentiles, coconut oil received the lowest score of 0 points due to its high SFA content, resulting in low concentrations of UFA. In addition, the presence of phytosterols and tocopherols was very low, which contributed greatly to the low punctuation. Despite claims made by consumers on social media regarding the health benefits of coconut oil [27], recent meta-analyses showed that consumption of this oil increases serum lipid concentrations more than oils rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and PUFA [28,29,30], which is comparable to that of animal fats rich in SFA [31].\n\nMargarine was strongly linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease due to its content in TFA. As a result, the WHO recommended eliminating industrially produced TFA, and several countries implemented regulations to reduce or ban the use of partially hydrogenated fat [32]. As a consequence, the TFA concentration in margarines varies greatly depending on their origin of production. The nutritional quality score of margarine included products with TFA content ranging from 0.1 to 21.7 g/100 g, with a mean value of 10.9. Therefore, this high TFA content contributed to a low score value for margarine and a low position in the ranking. However, margarines are frequently enriched with vitamin E and/or phytosterols, which could contribute to a higher score for this food.\n\nIn terms of nutritional quality, the score of animal fats was highly variable. Fish fats, due to their high content in n-3 PUFA, ranked best, occupying positions 12 (salmon) to 19 (herring) in the ranking. In contrast, lard, beef tallow, and butter ranked at the bottom of the classification, just above coconut oil. The low score obtained by animal fats other than in fish was mainly due to their high content in SFA, which is associated with elevated levels of LDL-cholesterol [33,34,35]. Despite some controversy about the role of SFA in cardiovascular health [36], limiting the intake of SFA to less than 6% and 10% of daily energy is recommended by the American Heart Association [37] and the FAO/WHO [5,6], respectively ( ). We found that SFA strongly correlated with the nutritional quality score and provided a high AUC value in ROC curves, indicating that the SFA content of a fat or oil can be used to predict the score.\n\nThe current study has several strengths and limitations. An important strength is that the score was developed by considering the RDV and health claims of four important international food and health organizations (FAO/WHO, EFSA, USDA, and FDA). Secondly, the model included nine criteria, including fatty acids, micronutrients, and bioactive compounds, for which nutritional dietary recommendations or health claims were available. Moreover, the study included 32 fats and oils, both of plant and animal origin, which is a larger sample size than the previous study by Zhao et al. [11], the only authors that previously attempted to elaborate a score to rank vegetable oils according to their nutritional quality, to the best of our knowledge. These authors, included only 13 vegetable oils and did not differentiate between VOO and common and pomace olive oils, just as other popular nutritional ratings, such as Nutri-Score [38]. However, the study also has limitations. For instance, the score did not consider non-compositional parameters of oils, such as their smoke point and resistance to oxidation, which could influence their nutritional quality over time. Additionally, despite the large sample size of edible oils and fats used, the score could be enhanced by increasing the number of oils evaluated. Finally, the composition of some oils is highly variable, which could lead to changes in the score."
