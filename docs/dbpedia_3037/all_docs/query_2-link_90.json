        "text": "Dieter G. Oberg, Munich\n\n(Abstract of a lecture at the University of applied Siences, Waedenswil/Zurich)\n\nWhy is the labelling of olive oil\n\nof such high importance, compared to other vegetable oils?\n\nFirstly, labelling is important because the image of olive oil is generally highly favourable, due to its taste characteristics and its particular nutritional value, and also because there is a tendency to transfer this image to other products (e.g. margarine, mayonnaise, mixed oils).\n\nSecondly, virgin olive oils are pure natural products. The natural characteristics – and of course the harvesting, handling and processing – of the fragile fruit include essential features which may influence the quality and in particular the flavour of the oil. This is why there is a huge range of qualities on the market, as is the case with wine and fruit juices.\n\nThirdly, the extreme variations in consumer requirements need to be taken into account. These requirements are differentiated, not only by product specifications such as special taste or odour, but also by varying levels of interest in different products and by monetary aspects. At the same time, broad acceptance of the product generally has a positive effect on the entire market.\n\nA What is obligatory for labelling?\n\nClassification examples extra virgin olive oil or\n\nolive oil (refined olive oil plus virgin olive oil)\n\nClassifications are designed to guarantee a particular quality and facilitate comparison by consumers. A clear distinction should be made between classification and quality. There are minimum requirements for quality classes. For example, the highest definition “extra virgin olive oil” has a defect median zero and a fruitiness over zero, according to official sensoric standards. These criteria confirm the classification of the product. If a slight negative attribute is observed, the oil is then classified only as “virgin”, and if the defect is more intense, the grade is reduced to “ordinary” or “lampante” and the product is no longer admitted as a foodstuff .\n\nToday the highest definition , “extra virgin olive oil”, must be supplemented by the following declaration on the label: “Superior category olive oil obtained directly from olives and solely by mechanical means.”\n\nThe second highest definition, “virgin olive oil” must be supplemented by” – obtained directly from olives and solely by mechanical means”.\n\nFilling quantity\n\n5 l containers and smaller, they may not be resealable\n\nBest before\n\nThe date must be clearly indicated on the label, where the consumer can find it (e.g. on the lid, on the glass bottle or under the bottle). It must be indicated day/month/year. If the best-before date is only indicated with month/year, the lot/batch number is mandatory.\n\nThe date given is valid from the filling date, i.e. not from the production period. Actually a clear indication, if there were not different qualities.\n\nVery well produced oils from green olives can have a considerable freshness of 24 months, olives harvested at a good stage of ripeness can also last 18 months if carefully processed, the more uncertain the contents of the container (mixture of different olives from one or from different countries), the more fragile the shelf life can be.\n\nAfter that, the responsibility for the best-before date lies with the marketer, who ultimately bears the responsibility towards the consumer. If the distributor is publishing on the label the campaign year (like 2021/2022), the consumer might realize the bb date better.\n\nInformation of Producer and/or bottler and/or distributor\n\nOne of the three possible addresses is mandatory on the label so that the consumer has the possibility to contact someone in certain cases. More precise indications of origin are optional, but are used more often today because consumers attach importance to them and receive important information.\n\nIndications of origin\n\nSince 1 July 2009, virgin olive oils (extra) must always bear an indication of origin on the package. If it is a matter of labelling with country names, this is regulated in VO (EG) 29/2012. Depending on the origin the consumer can differentiate as follows:\n\nExtra virgin olive oil from Greece\n\nExtra virgin olive oil from the Community (or blend of olive oils from the Community or blend of olive oils from Spain and Greece or blend of olive oils from the Community and Turkey)\n\nExtra virgin olive oil from Tunisia\n\nIf the labelling of a protected area of origin or a protected geographical cultivation area is concerned, this is regulated in Regulation (EU) 1308/2013 or Regulation (EU) 29/2012. The decisive factor is the connection between the typical characteristics from cultivation to the product and the geographical origin.\n\nProtected area of origin (only after application and approval by the EC), e.g. Sierra Segura, Terra di Bari, Sitia-Lassithi-Crete.\n\nProtected geographical area (only after application and approval by the EC), e.g. from Lesbos, from Toscano.\n\nIt is crucial that consumers read the label in great detail on the subject of origin.\n\nOrganic olive oil\n\nIf a virgin olive oil is declared to be organic, indication of organic cultivation must appear on the label together with a control number.\n\nNew Health Claims Regulation VO 1924/2006\n\nIt distinguishes between nutrition claims and health claims. For the first group there is already an annex in the regulation. For the second group, an annex will be created. The information is constantly being supplemented. It is advisable to do good research in these areas.\n\nIn the future (depending on the stock at the latest from 14.12.2016) there will be mandatory information in the nutrition declaration.\n\nThese include:\n\nCalorific value (per 100ml or 100g): in kl and Kcal\n\nFat: in g\n\nOf which saturated fatty acids: in g\n\nMonounsaturated fatty acids: in g\n\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids: in g\n\nProtein: in g\n\nCarbohydrates: in g\n\nOf which sugar: in g\n\nDietary fibre: in g\n\nSodium: in g\n\nAttention: do not indicate cholesterol ! Not allowed.\n\nThe indication of storage\n\nIt is now obligatory, e.g. \"Store sealed, dark and preferably at temperatures of 16° to 20°C. If stored below approx. < 8°C, the olive oil crystallizes. It regenerates at room temperature without affecting the taste.\"\n\nB Optional labelling informations\n\nCold-pressed/ Cold-extracted / First cold pressing\n\nIf an oil has verifiably been pressed at a temperature lower than 27 ° C in a traditional press, the designation “cold pressed” may be used.\n\nIf it has been extracted using a modern decanter method at under 27 ° C, it may be described as “cold-extracted”. In brief, this means that “cold-pressed” and “cold-extracted” imply a gentle pressing or extraction with a positive effect on the stock of important antioxidant fat-accompanying substances in olive oil, which depend on the type, degree of ripeness, and storage time.\n\nIn general, the pressing temperature must not generally exceed a level which could impair flavour quality. An excessive pressing temperature can be detected by sensory testing groups.\n\nInformation on acidity (free fatty acids – otherwise known as oleic acids)\n\nThe worse an olive is treated between its ideal state of ripeness and processing in the press, the more the free fatty acids, measured as oleic acid per 100 g oil, increase. This information is not to be confused with the oleic acid from the lipid profile, which is called mono unsaturated fatty acids. The lower the free fatty acid content, the better the quality of the oil. The highest classification allows a maximum of 0.8%, but some producers voluntarily adopt a lower limit. Nevertheless, one must assume that acidity level is not a particularly meaningful piece of information for consumers, because they can seldom detect its effect on flavour. A low acidity value may well say something about the care a producer takes during manufacture, but need not always do so, because the type of olive used and climatic conditions also have an effect. Incidentally, sensory tests take place without knowledge of the acidity level. Finally, the new EU regulations allow declaration of the acidity value on the label only when provided together with values for wax, peroxide and UV-absorption.\n\nInformation on origin\n\nThe new regulations on declaration of origin, valid since Nov. 2003, can be found in the EC Regulation 1019/2002, Paragraph 4. This information enables most declarations of origin to be clearly interpreted. Nevertheless, the label must be read very carefully for the distinctions between the various places of origin described in the attachment to be recognised.\n\nCertificated details on flavour\n\nInformation such as “mild”, “medium” or “intense fruity” is permitted provided that the producer or bottler is able to assess these attributes properly. The descriptions of flavour intensities “fruity”, “bitter” and “pungent” using figures are allowed only if the oil has been tested by a group of experts recognised by the IOOC.\n\nC Optional additions\n\nSmaller producers may indicate other factors which influence quality on their labels. These include:\n\nHarvest time\n\nHarvest method\n\nBottling date\n\nOlive type or proportions of various types\n\nIndications of possible sediment (for unfiltered oils) and storage guidelines\n\nFiltered / unfiltered\n\nReferences to nutritional data (e.g. Polyphenols)"
