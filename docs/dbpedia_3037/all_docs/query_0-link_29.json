        "text": "Seasonality\n\nIn the U.S., olives are in season in the autumn and harvest occurs from September into November. Ripe ones are purple and black depending on variety. Even when ripe, though, they are too bitter to eat as a fresh fruit. The ones you are used to eating have been “cured,” by being soaked in brine or salted. Although canned black olives (those found on a supermarket shelf) are actually green ones that were turned black with alkaline.\n\nGeography\n\nSpain and Italy are top producers of olives in the world while in the U.S., California produces 99 percent of all domestic olives.\n\nThe olive is the fruit of an evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 feet tall. The tree, with its characteristic silvery green leaves and gnarled bark, thrives in hot, sunny Mediterranean climates. Although they grow well in moist soil, the trees are fairly hearty when it comes to drought resistance, flourishing in the rocky and often steep hills along the Adriatic. Trees can also hold up to cold snaps, but will die off in freezing temperatures. If you are thinking about planting an olive tree, know that it can take up to fifteen years for it to bear fruit.\n\nProduction is separated into two parts: table olives (olives grown for cooking and eating) and olive oil. While most of the olives grown in the world are turned into oil — about 90 percent — most of the table olives are consumed in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern countries, according to “The Oxford Companion to Food.”\n\nIt takes about eleven pounds of the fruit to make a liter bottle of olive oil. The ripe fruit are ground into a paste that is then pressed. The resulting liquid is then separated by centrifuge into oil and a liquid called pomace. In ancient times, the process involved stone mills to crush the fruit and grass mats to separate the liquid.\n\nEating olives\n\nStoring\n\nOlive oil has a limited shelf life and should be consumed within a year of production otherwise it will go rancid. When not using, store in a cool place out of direct sunlight. Fresh, cured olives will keep in the refrigerator for at least a few weeks, while canned and bottled olives can last years if sealed and kept cool (and away from direct sunlight).\n\nCooking\n\nIt’s hard to think about olives without thinking about olive oil, especially when 90 percent of harvest gets turned into oil. It can be used to cook with, drizzle on seasonal vegetables or add to salads.\n\nTable olives are a perfect snack or appetizer, pairing well with various cheeses and wines. Some come stuffed with lemon, almonds, cheese and garlic, or seasoned with herbs and chili. A classic condiment is tapenade, a puree of black olives, capers, anchovies, herbs, lemon, mustard and even cognac. And don’t forget martinis! Need to remove the pit? Smash the flat side of a chef’s knife et voilà!\n\nOlive oil is also delicious in baked goods, like this classic Italian olive oil cake.\n\nPreserving\n\nOlives are one of the original preserved foods. Humans have been curing, brining, fermenting and salting them for millennia. In modern times, they are tinned and bottled, extending their shelf life for years. If you’re one of the lucky few who have ready access to fresh olives, here’s a how-to guide for curing your own.\n\nNutrition\n\nThey may be high in fat, but it’s healthy monounsaturated fat. Further, they are an excellent source of Vitamin E, providing 25 percent of your daily recommended value in a 3.5 ounce serving. In addition, there are a lot of health claims about the benefits of olives and their oil."
