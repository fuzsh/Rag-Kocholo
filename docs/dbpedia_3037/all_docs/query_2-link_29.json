        "text": "Technically, there is no cold-pressed (or cold extracted) extra virgin olive oil. It is often said that the best olive oils are processed and then pressed.\n\n“Cold-pressed” is a historical legacy dating back to the ‘90s when the first “continuous cycle” machines with a processing temperature of around 28 ° C began to be used in the mills, replacing the old presses with “fiscoli” (a filter container in which the ground olives are placed for pressing) which reached temperatures 60 ° C during processing and burnt and completely oxidized the olive oil.\n\nFor this passage from 60 ° to 28 ° the processing is defined as “cold working”, but it is understood that 28 ° is not really a cold temperature. The best extra virgin olive oils, like ours, are processed at temperatures between 22 ° C and 25 ° C in continuous cycle mills.\n\nAs written in the product description, our olive oils are “just milled” extra virgin olive oil (also called “Novello”), or rather it is the extra virgin olive oil obtained from the pressing of last October / November. On our labels, you will find the exact year of olive oil production.\n\nBe careful, however, that due to the numerous requests, the freshly pressed olive oil has a limited stock.\n\nEVOO (an acronym for extra virgin olive oil) is the most valuable of the olive oils and it is the direct product of the pressing of the olives. Our EVOO has a free acidity that never exceeds 0.2% (we are talking about grams of oleic acid per 100 grams of olive oil) well below the legal limit of 0.8%.\n\nThe Panel test, that is the examination thanks to which the organoleptic characteristics of the olive oil are established, is free from defects and presents fruity, bitter, and spicy notes that vary according to the origin of the olives and the climate, which greatly affects plant health and fruit growth and ripening.\n\nExtra virgin olive oil for Italians is a very serious thing. Italy is the largest producer of quality extra virgin olive oil in the world. We boast 500 varieties of olives that can produce very different high quality extra virgin olive oils.\n\nTo recognize a good Italian extra virgin olive oil, always look at the label and always prefer it to the various extra virgin olive oils from who knows where. Even from countries of the European Union. In fact, although these olive oils comply with consumer safety standards, they do not have the same quality as ours.\n\nItalian extra virgin olive oil is one of the MADE IN ITALY products present all over the world.\n\nAt Oilalà, we use only and exclusively Italian olives to obtain a 100% Italian extra virgin olive oil of superior quality. The acidity of our olive oil does not exceed 0.2%, well below the legal limit of 0.8%.\n\nThe most important alteration that extra virgin olive oil can undergo is oxidation which leads to rancidity. Oxidation is a chemical process that occurs when the olive oil remains in contact with air and light. For this reason, we have created the bag in box. A unique package able to avoid, as much as possible, the contact of the olive oil with light and oxygen.\n\nHere are some tips to keep the olive oil at home in the best possible way:\n\n1. store in cool places with temperatures between 10 ° C and 25 ° C so that it neither freezes nor overheats\n\n2. store the extra virgin olive oil in dark places, away from sunlight (if the bottle is made of glass).\n\n3. keep the bottle of olive oil hermetically sealed as there are house insects who love olive oil very much. Furthermore, the passage of air accelerates the oxidation process\n\n4. store the olive oil in odor-free environments as the olive oil tends to absorb odors\n\nLet’s start by saying what extra virgin olive oil is. Extra virgin olive oil is the acronym for\n\nextra virgin olive oil.\n\nExtra virgin olive oil must have certain chemical and organoleptic characteristics: color, smell, consistency, and above all acidity which by law must not exceed 0.8%. In addition, extra virgin olive oil is always and only obtained through mechanical, never chemical processes, with temperatures not exceeding 27 ° C.\n\nOlive oil, on the other hand, is a mixture of oil obtained through chemical substances (refined oil) and virgin oil."
