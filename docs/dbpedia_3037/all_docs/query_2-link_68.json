        "meta_description": "Olive oil is the liquid extracted from the fruits of the Olive tree: the olives. It is also the healthiest edible vegetable fat and the only one that can be consumed as olive juice, as the rest of oils (sunflower, soybean, rapeseed, etc.) need to be refined, meaning they undergo a series of aggressive processes involving numerous chemical products. As it is well known in a large part of our planet, Extra Virgin Olive Oil is the essence of the Mediterranean diet: fresh juice from healthy olives with endless uses and health properties.",

        "text": "Do we know all the existing varieties?\n\nThere are multiple varieties and qualities of Olive Oil, and its classification and identification are not completely clarified, as it is sometimes done by nomenclature and other times by the qualities described on the label of the container.\n\nThus, the different types of Olive Oil are classified based on their variety, quality, acidity level, extraction methods, and sensory characteristics, such as taste, smell, and color.\n\nClassification based on commercialization\n\nThe first approach to the types of Olive Oil that we will discuss in this article will be from the point of view of commercialization. In this sense, the oils that we can find in our usual point of purchase are as follows:\n\n路 Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\n路 Virgin Olive Oil\n\n路 Olive Oil (blend of refined olive oil and virgin olive oil)\n\n路 Olive Pomace Oil (blend of refined pomace oil and virgin olive oil).\n\nThis classification corresponds to the four commercial categories of Olive Oil recognized in the legislation of the European Union (CE Regulation 1019/2002). It is worth noting that refined Olive Oil and Refined Olive Pomace Oil are not marketed as such; they are blended with a small percentage of virgin olive oil.\n\nDiagram of https://www.aceitedeoliva.com\n\nIt is important to emphasize that the term 'Virgin' can only be used for oil obtained from the fruit of the olive tree (the olive) solely through mechanical processes such as cleaning, washing, grinding, and other physical procedures like tempering, centrifugation, decantation, and filtration. It is a fruit juice that does not require any chemical treatment to be consumed and retains all its components, including aroma, flavor, vitamins, and nutrients naturally. It is also worth noting that to ensure the quality of the oils, they must pass various physical, chemical, and sensory analyses.\n\nExtra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nExtra Virgin Olive Oil is a top-grade oil obtained directly from olives solely by mechanical means. Therefore, it is olive juice that has not had any substances added to it afterwards, making it a completely natural product. The quality of the raw material and the production conditions are such that it results in high-quality olive oil with excellent properties. Additionally, in order to guarantee the quality of Extra Virgin Olive Oil, it must meet certain parameters:\n\nThis type of oil, also known as Aove, is a juice of the highest quality oil and can be found in the market at a slightly higher value, not only in price but also in terms of health, flavor, authenticity, aromas, and delicacy. Currently, only a small part of Olive Oil production holds the distinction of Extra Virgin.\n\nExtra Virgin Olive Oil consists of a wide range of olive varieties, from single-varietals to blends, making this product a universe of sensations waiting to be explored.\n\nTo this day, we know of more than 1900 olive varieties worldwide, with 470 found in Spain, 644 in Italy, and 46 in Greece, among others. Each of these varieties produces a juice or Extra Virgin Olive Oil with different organoleptic characteristics.\n\nVirgin Olive Oil\n\nLike Extra Virgin Olive Oil, it is extracted directly from the olive only through mechanical processes. However, it loses the \"Extra\" label when a loss of quality is detected due to defects in the olives or in the production process. Therefore, this type of olive oil may present some defects in tasting, and its acidity should not exceed 2 degrees. It is usually produced in the last weeks of harvesting, using very ripe olives that have been exposed to adverse conditions, such as frost. This type of Olive Oil is ideal for use in frying processes or for making certain sauces.\n\nVirgin Lampante Olive Oil\n\nVirgin Lampante Olive Oil is an Olive Oil with defective taste or whose free acidity expressed as oleic acid is higher than 2 grams per 100 grams. Its analytical characteristics may also conform to those established for this category.\n\nThis type of oil is the result of using olives that have fallen to the ground due to climatic damage or diseases, and it exhibits poor organoleptic qualities and an acidity level that exceeds 2 degrees. Therefore, it is not advisable for human consumption and is not sold as it is. Its destination is oil refineries where it is transformed into refined oil through very aggressive chemical and physical processes.\n\nRefined Olive Oil\n\nIt is obtained when Virgin Lampante Olive Oil undergoes a refining process through very aggressive and drastic chemical and physical procedures to eliminate all unwanted components of acidity, odor, and flavor. The resulting liquid is a type of Olive Oil almost devoid of taste, odor, and color, known as Refined Olive Oil.\n\nOlive Oil\n\nAccording to the aforementioned regulation, this denomination applies to an oil composed of a blend of refined Olive Oils topped with Virgin Olive Oils to enhance its organoleptic characteristics.\n\nOlive Pomace Oil\n\nIt is obtained from the pomace of the olive, which is a by-product resulting from the production of Olive Oil. It is composed of pulp, skin, and pit, along with traces of oil, making it the residue of the olive once Olive Oil has been extracted by mechanical means. This pomace is taken to factories called \"oruja\" mills where, through processes involving drying and extraction with solvent (hexane), a crude oil called pomace oil is obtained. This oil is not suitable for consumption and requires a refining process through very aggressive and drastic chemical and physical procedures to eliminate all unwanted components and turn it into refined pomace oil. Refined Pomace Oil is an oil devoid of taste, odor, and color. This oil is mixed with small percentages of virgin olive oil with strong flavors and aromas and is marketed under the name of Olive Pomace Oil. It must have an acidity level not exceeding 1%.\n\nMOST IMPORTANT OLIVE AND AOVE VARIETIES IN SPAIN (There are as many AOVEs as there are olive varieties.)\n\nVariety PICUAL. Its oil has a main characteristic of high bitterness, and if the oil is young, it is also known for its spiciness. It is a powerful-bodied oil, which may be rejected by people not accustomed to consuming olive oil. It is highly resistant to oxidation.\n\nVariety HOJIBLANCA. Its oil has a medium bitterness, less than the picual variety.\n\nVariety ARBEQUINO. Its oil has low bitterness and spiciness. Suitable for beginners in extra virgin olive oil."
