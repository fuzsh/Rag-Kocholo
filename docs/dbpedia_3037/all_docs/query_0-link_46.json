        "text": "Olive oil and extra virgin olive oil are both made from olives but with different extraction methods. This means they have various differences. Overall, extra virgin olive oil may be considered more healthful.\n\nMany types of oil are available on the market, including vegetable, canola, avocado, walnut, and coconut oil. It can be difficult to know which oil is the best. Do they actually taste different? Is one more healthful than the others?\n\nThis article takes a look at the differences between extra virgin olive oil and olive oil, including their tastes, health benefits, and cooking and smoke points.\n\nThe uses of different oils vary. Olive oil has a great flavor that makes it suitable for adding uncooked to salad or bread, and it is relatively heat-stable for cooking. However, there has been some controversy over whether olive oil is actually healthful, and there is no consensus about which type is best.\n\nThe main types of fat in olive oil, which mainly consists of oleic acid, are monosaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), which health experts agree are a healthful fat.\n\nIn contrast, saturated fats and trans fats are unhealthful fats. Research has linked eating unhealthful fats to a range of health conditions, including heart disease, stroke, and obesity.\n\nReplacing saturated and trans fats with MUFAs can help lower a person’s risk of heart disease. These fats raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or “good,” cholesterol and reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or “bad,” cholesterol in the bloodstream.\n\nOlive oil is one component of the Mediterranean diet, which research has shown to have many benefits for health, including that of the heart, eyes, and brain.\n\nRead more about the different types of fat here.\n\nMost of the modifiers that go before olive oil, such as “virgin” or “extra virgin,” refer to the process that manufacturers use to produce the oil. Extra virgin olive oils have undergone the least processing.\n\nWhen the manufacturer processes the oil, they clean it with chemicals and then heat it. These processes prolong the shelf life, which is great for the food industry, but they may strip away a lot of the oil’s flavor and some of its benefits.\n\nAccording to research, extra virgin olive oil has more polyphenols than regular olive oil. Polyphenols are a type of antioxidant, and they have many health benefits. Refining olive oil strips it of its vitamins, polyphenols, and other natural ingredients.\n\nMany people find that extra virgin olive oil has a more pleasant taste than olive oils that have undergone more processing. Fresh, unprocessed extra virgin olive oil should taste:\n\na bit fruity\n\na little bitter, similar to biting into an olive\n\nslightly peppery\n\nIf the oil tastes metallic, flavorless, or musty, this may be due to overprocessing, or the oil might have gone bad.\n\nMany people opt for cold pressed, unfiltered, or stone pressed products when choosing which extra virgin olive oil to purchase. With these options, the oil has not undergone heating or filtering, which usually adds chemicals to the oil.\n\nPros of extra virgin olive oil\n\nPeople may prefer to use extra virgin olive oil in place of regular olive oil because:\n\nit has undergone less processing\n\nthey find it to have a more pleasant taste\n\nit contains fewer chemicals\n\nit is higher in antioxidants, vitamins, and other natural ingredients\n\nPure olive oil is a blend of extra virgin olive oil and processed oils. People can check the label to find out exactly what is in the oil before buying it. Some light virgin oils are a blend, too.\n\nThe term “light” refers to the flavor of the oil, rather than the calorie content. Light oils are often processed and refined, which strips down the color as well as the flavor.\n\nProcessing makes the oil last longer, and it also makes it possible to heat the oil to a higher temperature, which is good for cooking. However, it adds chemicals and takes out nutrients.\n\nThe best place to store olive oil is somewhere cool, dry, and dark. It is best to place it somewhere where it will not get radiant heat, either from appliances or the sun. Doing this will keep the oil fresh for longer.\n\nWhen using oil for cooking, it is important to keep the heat level in mind. The smoke point is the temperature at which the oil begins to break down, become carcinogenic, and release smoke into the air. In other words, it is when the oil starts to burn.\n\nIf oil starts to burn or catch fire, a person should throw it away and start again.\n\nThe American Heart Association (AHA) say that the following oils are relatively healthful for cooking and preparing food:\n\nolive\n\nsafflower\n\nsunflower\n\nsoybean\n\ncanola\n\ncorn\n\npeanut\n\nThey recommend using these fats instead of solid fats, such as butter, shortening, or lard, and tropical oils, such as palm and coconut oil, as these types can have a lot of saturated fat.\n\nRead more about the best oils for frying here."
