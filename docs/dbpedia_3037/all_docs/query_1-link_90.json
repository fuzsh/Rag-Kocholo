        "text": "What is the difference between cold pressed olive oil vs regular olive oil?\n\nHow is cold-pressed olive oil made?\n\nWhat is extra virgin olive oil?\n\nHow do you choose the best olive oil for cooking or using directly on food?\n\nIn this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the characteristics, production methods, and health advantages of olive oil.\n\nWe will also explain the difference between extra-virgin oil that is cold-pressed, from the highest grade olives, and cheaper poor-quality oil that often contains volatile compounds and additives.\n\nBefore moving to Italy from the United States, I found the labels on olive oil to be very confusing.\n\nI also had never actually tasted good, cold-pressed, extra virgin olive oil made in the traditional method – the way Italy and other Mediterranean countries have been making it for thousands of years.\n\nFalling in love with good olive oil and its “peppery” bitterness has been one of the best things about my new life in Italy.\n\nI am convinced that the high amount of unrefined olive oil that has been added to my diet is a major contributor to the dramatic improvement in my health since moving to the Mediterranean region.\n\nOne of the main reasons for including cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil in your diet is because of its array of health benefits.\n\nRich in monounsaturated fats and antioxidants, cold-pressed olive oil has been associated with numerous advantages for heart health, inflammation reduction, and overall well-being.\n\nThe presence of phenolic compounds and vitamin E, found in cold-pressed olive oil, contributes to its antioxidant properties and helps combat free radicals while protecting the body’s cells from oxidative stress.\n\nOlive oil is derived from the fruit of olive trees (Olea europaea).\n\nThe extraction process involves pressing or crushing the olives to extract the oil from the olives.\n\nWhile there are various types of olive oil, two prominent categories are cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and “regular” olive oil.\n\nExtra virgin olive oil is the highest quality and most flavorful, while regular olive oil is more refined and has a milder taste.\n\nNow, let’s explore these types in more detail.\n\nCold-pressed olive oil refers to oil extracted solely through mechanical means, without the application of heat.\n\nThis gentle process ensures that the oil retains its natural flavors, aromas, and nutritional integrity.\n\nThe color of this fabulous oil is a vibrant chartreuse green, the aroma and flavor is vibrant and peppery.\n\nCold pressing involves crushing the olives, in their whole form, into a paste and then pressing the paste to extract the oil.\n\nBy avoiding high temperatures, the delicate compounds and volatile aromas of the olives are better preserved, contributing to a more vibrant and distinct flavor profile.\n\nCold-pressed olive oil is often also extra virgin olive oil which means that it is the oil obtained from the first pressing of the olives in a batch.\n\nSometimes the same batch of olives can be pressed 3 or more times, but with each press the quality of the oil drops.\n\nThe first cold press is where true extra virgin olive oil comes from – this is the finest oil you can buy.\n\nRegular olive oil, also referred to as “pure olive oil” or just olive oil, is a blend of refined olive oil.\n\nThere are practically no regulations on this non-extra virgin oil.\n\nThis means you never really know what is in your oil, where it’s from, or if it really is olive oil.\n\nThe color of “regular” olive oil is more golden and the flavor is dull and tasteless.\n\nThe refining process involves treating the oil with heat and chemical solvents to remove impurities and neutralize intense flavors.\n\nWhile this refining process may diminish some of the natural antioxidants and flavor characteristics, it results in a more stable oil with a higher smoke point.\n\nUnfortunately the reason the “smoke point” is higher is because the oil has been infused with petroleum-based solvents and often blended with other non-olive oils.\n\nRapeseed, canola, sunflower, and safflower oils are commonly mixed into “regular” non-extra virgin olive oils without ever being listed on the labels.\n\nIf you are looking for good quality oil, look for a brand grown and produced in California.\n\nCalifornia olive oil is considered some of the best-quality olive oil because the standards for production in California are high and strictly monitored.\n\nLike many food labels in our modern world of fake food and imitation products, olive oil labels are intentionally misleading.\n\nI was once under the impression that the $4 bottle of olive oil I usually bought with “all-natural” “extra virgin oil” stamped on the label was more or less the same as the more expensive bottles sitting on the shelf beside it.\n\nThe olive oil industry has been especially rife with corruption for the past 60+ years, and thousands of years before that.\n\nIn 2019, a story by 60 Minutes and an investigative report by The New Yorker magazine shed light on the dark world of counterfeit olive oil.\n\nThese stories reported that approximately 70% of extra virgin olive oil is likely fake or completely mislabelled.\n\nTo ensure that you are getting the “real thing” check the back label very closely.\n\nFor Italian olive oil look for DOP on the label – this is oil from a specific protected and regulated growing region.\n\nAlso, look for a harvest date and the name of the specific town and region where the oil is produced.\n\nIf the label says the oil is a “product of Europe” or the “European Union” that’s a red flag and the oil is most likely fake.\n\nJust claiming that oil is a product of Italy, Spain, or France is not enough.\n\nYou must have a harvest date, city, and region at the very least.\n\nIf you find the name of the specific farm or family that makes the oil you’re in great shape.\n\nAlso, expect to pay more for high-quality olive oil.\n\nOlive oil production is a labor-intensive endeavor – the best and healthiest olive oil does not come at $4 a bottle.\n\nCold pressed olive oil, with its robust flavor and distinct characteristics, shines when used in dressings, dips, and drizzles.\n\nIts fruity notes and intense aroma enhance the overall taste profile of dishes, particularly when used as a finishing oil.\n\nCold-pressed olive oil is best enjoyed in its raw form, allowing its unique qualities to take center stage.\n\nDrizzle extra virgin cold-pressed oil over dishes before serving them or use it in salad dressings for the most robust flavor boost.\n\nYou can certainly cook with the highest quality oil from cold-pressed olives but cook at a lower temperature.\n\nI personally use my superior quality cold pressed oil for every type of cooking here in Italy.\n\nLook for reputable brands that adhere to high-quality standards and follow proper production methods.\n\nCertification seals from organizations such as the International Olive Council can provide assurance of authenticity and quality.\n\nBy considering these factors, you can select the right type and grade of olive oil that complements your culinary needs and preferences.\n\nThe distinction between cold pressed olive oil vs regular olive oil lies in their production methods.\n\nCold-pressed olive oil is extracted through a gentle mechanical process, preserving the natural flavors and health-promoting compounds of the olives.\n\nThere is no heat applied to the olives during cold-press oil extraction.\n\nCold-pressed oil offers a vibrant taste profile and is best enjoyed in raw applications.\n\nOn the other hand, regular olive oil undergoes a refining process and has a milder flavor.\n\nWhile some feel that it is better for cooking, due to its high smoke point, I personally feel that it is best used as lamp oil or to quiet a creaky door.\n\nWhen shopping for quality oil, be sure to check the label for harvest date, city, and region – California and Italian olive oil are excellent options.\n\nAlso, cheap oil is a red flag that it may be fake.\n\nWhether you seek the robust and fruity flavors of cold pressed olive oil or the versatility of regular olive oil, incorporating high-quality olive oil into your diet can elevate your culinary experiences.\n\nYou will reap the numerous health benefits associated with this “liquid gold” which originated from the Mediterranean region.\n\nAre you interested in learning why Italians and people
