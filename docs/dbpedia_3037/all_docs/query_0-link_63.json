        "text": "Find us salivating. Ice cream is one of the best ways to fully appreciate the flavor of high-quality olive oil. The sweet, simple richness of cream and sugar is the perfect backdrop to let grassy, tropical flavors do their thing. For a real nerd alert, most ice creams contain just one type of fat—butterfat from dairy. But in this case, the oil joins the fun. Technically, they don't combine, but because they're frozen, they hold together in a group hug, creating a lush texture halfway between creamy and silky.\n\nDid you know that olives can be grown in Oregon? Not only are olives grown in Oregon, but the family farm, Durant Olive Mill, has pioneered new techniques to grow their olives using a Spanish olive tree variety called Arbequina (pronounced: are-beh-key-nah). The Durant family leans into the colder climate in Oregon and presses their oil each Fall to create an olive oil that doesn't develop the spicy, bitter flavors you taste in California olive oils. Instead, we get delicate, slightly grassy flavors with a hint of tropical (almost pineapple) flavor. Nestled in the heart of Oregon's Willamette Valley, Durant crafts small-batch, artisanal olive oils and vinegars. With a commitment to sustainable farming practices, they offer a unique tasting experience, showcasing the rich flavors of locally grown olives."
