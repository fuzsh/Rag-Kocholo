        "text": "Olives are small fruits that grow on olive trees (Olea europaea). They belong to a group of fruit called drupes, or stone fruits, and are related to mangoes, cherries, peaches, almonds, and pistachios.\n\nOlives are very high in vitamin E and other powerful antioxidants. Studies show that they are good for the heart and may protect against osteoporosis and cancer.\n\nThe healthy fats in olives are extracted to produce olive oil, one of the key components of the incredibly healthy Mediterranean diet.\n\nOlives are also enjoyed in salads, sandwiches, and spreads.\n\nSome immature olives are green and turn black when they ripen. Others remain green even when fully ripe (1).\n\nIn the Mediterranean region, 90% of olives are used to make olive oil (2).\n\nThis article tells you everything you need to know about olives.\n\nOlives contain 115–145 calories per 3.5 ounces (100 grams), or about 59 calories for 10 olives.\n\nThe nutrition facts for 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of ripe, canned olives are (3):\n\nCalories: 116\n\nProtein: 0.8 grams\n\nCarbs: 6 grams\n\nSugar: 0 grams\n\nFiber: 1.6 grams\n\nFat: 10.9 grams\n\nSaturated: 2.3 grams\n\nMonounsaturated: 7.7 grams\n\nPolyunsaturated: 0.6 grams\n\nFat\n\nOlives contain 11–15% fat, 74% percent of which is oleic acid, a type of monounsaturated fatty acid. It is the main component of olive oil.\n\nOleic acid is linked to several health benefits, including decreased inflammation and a reduced risk of heart disease. It may even help fight cancer (4, 5, 6, 7).\n\nCarbs and fiber\n\nCarbs comprise 4–6% of olives, making them a low-carb fruit.\n\nMost of these carbs are fiber. In fact, fiber makes up 52–86% of the total carb content.\n\nThe net digestible carb content is therefore very low. However, olives are still a relatively poor source of fiber, since 10 olives only provide about 1.5 grams.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nOlives are an unusual fruit because of their high fat content. Their most abundant fat is oleic acid, which may have several health benefits. They also contain 4–6% carbs, most of which consists of fiber.\n\nOlives are a good source of several vitamins and minerals, some of which are added during processing. This fruit’s beneficial compounds include:\n\nVitamin E. High-fat plant foods usually contain high amounts of this powerful antioxidant.\n\nIron. Black olives are a good source of iron, which is important for your red blood cells to transport oxygen (8).\n\nCopper. This essential mineral is often lacking in the typical Western diet. Copper deficiency may increase your risk of heart disease (9, 10).\n\nCalcium. The most abundant mineral in your body, calcium is essential for bone, muscle, and nerve function. Some methods of olive processing add calcium to the fruit (11).\n\nSodium. Most olives contain high amounts of sodium since they’re packaged in brine or saltwater.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nOlives are a good source of vitamin E, iron, copper, and calcium. They may also contain high amounts of sodium if packaged in saltwater.\n\nOlives are rich in many plant compounds, particularly antioxidants, including (12):\n\nOleuropein. This is the most abundant antioxidant in fresh, unripe olives. It is linked to many health benefits (13).\n\nHydroxytyrosol. During olive ripening, oleuropein is broken down into hydroxytyrosol. It is also a powerful antioxidant (14, 15).\n\nTyrosol. Most prevalent in olive oil, this antioxidant may have anti-cancer effects (16, 17).\n\nOleanolic acid. This antioxidant may help prevent liver damage and reduce inflammation (18, 19).\n\nQuercetin. This nutrient may lower blood pressure and improve heart health (20).\n\nSUMMARY\n\nOlives are particularly rich in antioxidants, including oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, oleanolic acid, and quercetin.\n\nThe most common varieties of whole olives are:\n\nSpanish green olives, pickled\n\nGreek black olives, raw\n\nCalifornia olives, ripened with oxidation, then pickled\n\nBecause olives are very bitter, they’re not usually eaten fresh. Instead, they’re cured and fermented. This process reduces bitter compounds like oleuropein, which are most abundant in unripe olives.\n\nFermentation processes may also reduce cholesterol levels and increase beneficial bacteria in the final product (21).\n\nHowever, there are some varieties that don’t need processing and can be consumed when fully ripe.\n\nProcessing olives may take anywhere from a few days up to a few months depending on the method used. Processing methods often rely on local traditions, which affect the fruit’s taste, color, and texture (11).\n\nLactic acid is also important during fermentation. It acts as a natural preservative that protects the olives from harmful bacteria.\n\nCurrently, scientists are studying whether fermented olives have probiotic effects. This could lead to improved digestive health (21).\n\nSUMMARY\n\nFresh olives are very bitter and usually need to be cured and fermented before eating.\n\nOlives are a staple of the Mediterranean diet. They’re associated with many health benefits, especially for heart health and cancer prevention.\n\nAntioxidant properties\n\nDietary antioxidants have been shown to reduce your risk of chronic illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer.\n\nOlives are rich in antioxidants, with health benefits ranging from fighting inflammation to reducing microorganism growth (22).\n\nOne older 2009 study showed that eating a pulpy residue from olives significantly increased blood levels of glutathione, one of the most powerful antioxidants in your body (23, 24).\n\nImproved heart health\n\nHigh blood cholesterol and blood pressure are both risk factors for heart disease.\n\nOleic acid, the main fatty acid in olives, is associated with improved heart health. It may regulate cholesterol levels and protect LDL (bad) cholesterol from oxidation, though some experts say more evidence is needed (1, 25, 26).\n\nFurthermore, some studies note that olives and olive oil may reduce blood pressure (27, 28).\n\nImproved bone health\n\nOsteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone mass and bone quality. It can increase your risk of fractures.\n\nThe rates of osteoporosis are lower in Mediterranean countries than in the rest of Europe, leading to speculation that olives might protect against this condition (29).\n\nSome of the plant compounds found in olives and olive oil have been shown to help prevent bone loss in animal and test-tube studies (29, 30, 31, 32).\n\nIn addition, observational studies suggest that following a Mediterranean diet may reduce the risk of bone fractures (33).\n\nCancer prevention\n\nOlives and olive oil are commonly consumed in the Mediterranean region, where rates of cancer and other chronic diseases are lower than in other Western countries (34).\n\nThus, it’s possible that olives may help reduce your risk of cancer.\n\nThis may be partly due to their high antioxidant and oleic acid contents. Observational and test-tube studies reveal that these compounds disrupt the life cycle of cancer cells in the breast, colon, and stomach (6, 7 35, 36, 37).\n\nHowever, long-term, controlled human studies are needed to confirm these results. At this point, it’s unclear whether eating olives or olive oil leads to lower cancer rates.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nOlives are very rich in antioxidants that may contribute to a variety of benefits, such as lower cholesterol and blood pressure. They may also reduce your risk of cancer and bone loss, but more research is necessary.\n\nOlives are well tolerated by most people but may harbor high amounts of salt due to their packaging liquid.\n\nAllergy\n\nWhile allergy to olive tree pollen is common, allergy to olives is rare.\n\nAfter eating olives, sensitive individuals may experience allergic reactions in the mouth or throat (38).\n\nAcrylamide\n\nAcrylamide is linked to an increased risk of cancer in some studies, although other scientists question the connection (39).\n\nSome people choose to limit their acrylamide intake as much as possible (40).\n\nSome olive varieties – especially ripe black olives – may contain high amounts of acrylamide as a result of processing (41, 42, 43, 44). Olive producers are investigating ways to reduce the amount of acrylamide that forms during processing.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nOlives are usually well tolerated, and allergy is rare. However, they may contain high concentrations of salt. Some varieties may contain higher amounts of acrylamide due to processing.\n\nOlives are a savory and delicious addition to meals or appetizers.\n\nThey’re low in carbs but high in healthy fats. They’re also linked to several health benefits, including improved heart health.\n\nThis stone fruit is very easy to incorporate into your routine and makes a great addition to a healthy, whole-foods-based diet."
