        "text": "Extra Virgin Olive Oils are best used for salads, table top oil or drizzling on finished plates, where there flavor can truly shine. This is because 100% extra virgin olive oils will break down easily (smoke) and lose flavor when subjected to high heat applications such as sauteing, baking, or broiling. When selecting an olive oil, you should base your decision on flavor and aroma, not on color and appearance. Contrary to conventional wisdom, greener olive oil does not necessarily indicate a superior flavor.\n\nBlended Olive Oils can be used at the table, in your favorite kitchen recipe, and also for sauteing, baking or broiling any meal. There are times when the flavor of 100% olive oils can overpower more subtle flavors in cooked foods. Blended oils offer the advantage of a less assertive olive flavor along with superior performance for high heat cooking. Blended oils are the most cost effective for all of their applications, heat stability and genuine flavor."
