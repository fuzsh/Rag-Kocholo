        "text": "Always Go For Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nWhile extra virgin olive oils found in supermarket shelves may be inadequately labeled or even sometimes labeled as “extra virgin” when in fact they are not, you are still better off going with a mislabeled extra virgin olive oil rather than settling for the much lower-quality vegetable oils or even the low-quality types of olive oil such as “pure” or “lite”. Of course, it is advised that you buy olive oil from a trusted source in order to avoid falling victim to mislabeling in the first place.\n\nHarvest Date\n\nAlways look for the harvest date on the bottle and make sure it is at least within the last year. Olive oils are usually harvested between October and December. This means that if you shop for olive oil in April 2018, an olive oil with a Fall 2017 harvest date would still be considered “new harvest”. Note that many imported olive oils have their harvest and “best by” dates in EU format. In such cases, 4/10/2017 would mean the oil was harvested the 4th of October 2017 and NOT the 10th of April 2017.\n\nBuy From A Source That You Trust\n\nThe only way to be 100% sure an olive oil is truly “extra virgin” is to conduct a chemical analysis even though a tasting expert can usually tell with a sip or two. Since you can’t do a chemical analysis at home, it is important that you buy olive oil from producers or merchants that you feel like you can trust.\n\nIf you know a producer / brand to be 100% legitimate and trustworthy then you could buy all of your olive oil from them. However, that would probably limit your options as there are many varieties, each with unique taste and characteristics, and most producers only use their local olive varieties to make their oils.\n\nIf you’re the type seeking culinary adventures, then variety is what you want. Find a merchant selling high-quality extra virgin olive oils that also carefully stores the oils to avoid damage from heat and light. This is important since it is often the case several months will have passed till the olive oil reaches your doorstep after it’s been harvested and bottled.\n\nHigh quality extra virgin olive oil is very hard to make. A lot of effort goes into collecting and picking fresh, healthy olives and that adds to the final cost. But, that’s also what makes it 100% natural food with the massive health benefits it has grown famous for. Lower quality olive oils are made without the same level of care when it comes to picking the olives to crush. Thus, they need to be thermally and chemically treated to eliminate the bad flavors resulting from oxidized olives.\n\nAny comparison between extra virgin olive oil and canola, soy, sunflower, or any other cooking oils would be unfair and like trying to compare a supercar with a cheap 800cc car without safety belts and no airbags.\n\nBut good extra virgin olive oil isn’t just a healthier oil but an ingredient that can be used to elevate your dishes to a brand new level. There are many different varieties to choose from and much like wine, each has its own flavor and aromas. The health benefits and the strong fruity flavors of extra virgin olive oil are why it is great value for the money. But why don’t you just find that out for yourself?"
