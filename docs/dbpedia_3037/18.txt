I snapped a photo of a label on olive oil this weekend….. I was furious! Here’s why Olive oil was in a plastic bottle allowing light to affect nutrition and quality. Plus, olive oil may absorb PVCs from the plastic – just what you don’t need. Label says “packaged in Italy” but oil is coming from 5 different countries. Outdate only on the label - without the harvest date you have no idea how old that oil is. Says it’s extra virgin and cold extracted – really? Who’s watching in 5 different countries for quality? This is a perfect example of mass-produced industrial oil sold in bulk, repackaged for big box stores, and being used in millions of kitchens. Costco had a pallet of it sitting there – 16.67 for two liters- it’s no bargain! Better to look on the label for Olives sourced from one country Dark glass bottle that doesn’t react with the oil….. prohibits light from affecting nutrients…. and is better for the environment. Harvest date should be on the label, so you know exactly when the oil was produced for freshness Ideally a 3rd party chemical analysis showing nutritional analysis, especially polyphenol content for health benefits. I don’t think this is too much to ask but in the U.S. especially, labeling and disclosure laws are so lax just about anything is on the shelves. Don’t do this to your health I’ll link more information about a small grower in Italy and quality in the comment below. There’s a big difference between the real thing and industrial olive oil for consumption. Here’s how one person put it in our community of high-quality olive oil users….. This truly is a milestone in my journey of healthy living. Since I have tasted what is probably fraudulent oil, I am curious as to how the real thing tastes. Forrest W.
