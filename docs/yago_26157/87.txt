Suzy Kendall is a British actress best known for her film roles in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Her blonde attractive looks got her leading roles in some fairly prestigious productions. She later appeared in increasingly lower-profile films, including several giallo thrillers made in Italy and several TV series in the 1970s before retiring to spend more time with her family.

She was born Frieda Harrison on January 1, 1944 in Belper, Derbyshire, England. Kendall attended Derby & District College of Art where she studied painting and design. She was a fabric designer at British Celanese and then became a photographic model before becoming an actress.

Kendall married the pianist, comedian, and actor Dudley Moore in 1968, and though they divorced in 1972, they remained friends. She remarried shortly afterwards. In 2002 she hosted a memorial service for Moore attended by her second husband and daughter.

Kendall and her friend Pat Wellington wrote Natural Appeal: Fragrant Natural Preparations for the Care of Skin, Hair and Body, a book on beauty tips (ISBN 978-0460045254 published 1980).

Kendall now lives in London with her second husband Sandy Harper. Their daughter Elodie Harper is a BBC journalist.
