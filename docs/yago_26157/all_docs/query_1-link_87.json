        "text": "Long before he got caught between the moon and New York City, engaged in Foul Play, or counted to 10, Dudley Moore was a well-known renaissance man: a talented comedian, writer, actor, composer, and classically-trained jazz musician. Cherry Red's El imprint has recently reissued Moore's 1972 trio album, Today, featuring his interpretations of original songs and favorites by Henry Mancini, Burt Bacharach, and the team of Harry Warren and Mack Gordon.\n\nToday, originally released on Atlantic Records, followed a decade's worth of sporadic jazz recordings on labels including Parlophone, Decca, and London Records. Moore had already achieved international fame thanks to Beyond the Fringe, the satirical stage production which he created with Peter Cook, Alan Bennett, and Jonathan Miller. His continued partnership with Cook led to further work on television (Not Only...But Also), film (Bedazzled, The Wrong Box) and stage (Good Evening) before Moore chose to focus on his solo acting career, primarily in the United States. Even with a busy slate of activities, Moore never fully abandoned his musical endeavors, contributing the scores to Bedazzled, Staircase, 30 is a Dangerous Age, Cynthia, and other projects.\n\nToday was recorded in Sydney by pianist Moore, bassist Peter Morgan, and drummer Chris Karan during The Dudley Moore Trio's three-week tour of Australia. This was not \"jazz lite,\" or crossover jazz, but rather an instrumental album showcasing the trio's gifts of improvisation and elegance. Despite the title, the album made little attempt to channel current sounds; Moore had already done that masterfully with Cook on releases like \"The L.S. Bumble Bee,\" a slice of psychedelia poking gentle fun at The Beatles and The Beach Boys. At its heart were five original Moore compositions, of which the most current-sounding was the rhythmic, driving \"Song for Suzy,\" written for Moore's then-wife, actress Suzy Kendall and featuring his scat-style singing. Others included the breezy \"Waterloo,\" beautifully ruminative \"Before Love Went Out of Style,\" the swinging \"Robyn's Blues,\" and the pensive bossa of \"The Staircase.\" Moore additionally brought his fleet touch and masterful jazz phrasing to three covers, including a sprightly \"The More I See You,\" a sly, extended meditation on Burt Bacharach's melody to \"The Look of Love,\" and an attractive take on Henry Mancini's film theme \"Two for the Road.\"\n\nThe Dudley Moore Trio returned to Sydney in 1978 to record Dudley Down Under: Live on the Cube Records label. Moore himself, of course, went on to triumphs in Hollywood, receiving an Oscar nomination and Golden Globe win for his role in Arthur. Music remained an integral part of his life after Today. Among his later releases were an album with vocalist Cleo Laine on CBS Records in 1982 and a solo recital for GRP in 1991. These were hardly his most notorious latter-day recordings, though; he reteamed with Peter Cook between 1976 and 1978 for a series of unabashedly off-color albums under the moniker of Derek and Clive. Dudley Moore died in 2002 at the age of 66.\n\nEl's reissue boasts a 12-page booklet with uncredited commentary on Moore's career; there are no credits for remastering, either, though the release (licensed from Warner Music UK) presents the trio's music with clarity and presence. Today, celebrating the musical legacy of a beloved performer, is due on October 20 in the U.K. (October 27 in the U.S.) from Cherry Red and El.
