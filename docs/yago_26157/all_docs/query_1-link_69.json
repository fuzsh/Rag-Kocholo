        "text": "Director: Joseph McGrath\n\nStarring: Dudley Moore, Eddie Foy jr., Suzy Kendall\n\nRelease Date: 4th March 1968 (US)\n\nThe Beatles’ impact on popular culture went beyond music; the Fab Four also changed the course of British film comedy. With the release of A Hard Day’s Night (1964) and Help! (1965), The Beatles brought a carefree spirit to British comedy, combining youthful impertinence with a more thoughtful, sharper approach to dialogue. The increasing use of color also helped lend an air of psychedelia to even the lowliest of budgets as British film shook off its flat cap and raincoat, loosened its collar and bought itself some new gear from Canarby Street. All this led to British comedy films of the second half of the 1960s feeling as different, and changing just as rapidly, as The Beatles’ music did after their early involvements with the transcendental meditation movement. It also led to some very peculiar films.\n\nSome weeks ago, we looked at Billy Liar (1963) and the startlingly modern character of Liz, played by Julie Christie. After the success of the two Beatles films, it was as if Liz had taken the reins of British movie comedy from Billy’s parents, leaving Mr & Mrs Fisher with the ‘Carry On’ series and the odd Norman Wisdom film (though even Wisdom could move with the times, as with 1969’s What’s Good For the Goose). Black and white formality gave way to the fluid and the lurid, from the demented Gonks Go Beat (1965), to the swinging I’ll Never Forget What’s’Isname (1967) and Can Hieronymous Merkin Ever Forget Mercy Humppe and Find True Happiness? (1969). As these titles suggest, not all such forays into the new permissive society were a success.\n\nOne British comedy act who came of age during the mid 196os was Peter Cook & Dudley Moore. Meeting at Cambridge University in 1960 they, along with Alan Bennett and Johnathan Miller, formed the hugely successful Beyond the Fringe team. Once the group had run its course, Moore and Cook starred together in their own BBC sketch show Not Only…But Also (1965-66, 1970) their first work as a duo in what became a fruitful if intermittent partnership. Cook and Moore’s friendship was strained by a competitiveness bordering on the antagonistic, with both men ambitious to take their talents to ever larger audiences. The pair starred in two films together, The Wrong Box (1966) and Bedazzled (1967); though well-regarded today, both films flopped at the box office. For Dudley Moore the films were disasters and required a change of tack, as biographer Jeff Lenburg explained in 1983: “Moore could not afford another flop…what he needed more than ever was an impetus to help his career meet his expectations. The first step was to abandon his association with Peter Cook.”\n\nMoore scripted a film suited to his particular talents, including his musical skills (Moore was, of course, an accomplished pianist and composer). What he came up with was 30 is A Dangerous Age, Cynthia, the story of a 29-year-old man determined to marry and write a musical before his 30th birthday, around six weeks distant as the film begins. “Between the idea and the reality, falls the shadow,” wrote T S Eliot, and somewhere between Moore’s script (eventually co-written with director Joseph McGrath and comedy actor-writer John Wells) and the eventual production, something went awry.\n\nThe pre-credits sequence demonstrate the confusion behind the script as we see Dudley Moore, playing the 29-year-old Rupert Street, involved in minor incidents of a sort that might lead us to think his character is very superstitious or obsessed with time-keeping when in fact he’s neither. We then see Street visit a registrar’s office where we learn he’s a pianist and would like to get married on his 30th birthday, September 13th, if at all possible. The registrar (Frank Thornton, who cornered the market in this sort of role) points out that custom dictates a woman should ideally be involved, and throws Rupert out of his office in a brutal, polite, and rather English manner. So, is Rupert is a hopeless romantic, or a amiable moron? We never get a grip of who Rupert really is and what appears as fierce ambition is portrayed more as eccentricity, rather than a desperate race against the clock.\n\nWe do gain an impression that Rupert is a fantasist, as we see him acting on the registrar’s advice to find a woman during the opening credits (set out in a truly hideous font), but only in his imagination, as every woman Rupert encounters becomes his bride. Various very 1960s women arrive in mini-mokes, on bicycles, and in London buses, culminating in a mass ceremony by the Albert Memorial. In reality however, Rupert arrives at the grotty back entrance of his place of work, a Scottish-themed nightclub called Jock’s Box, a name defying closer examination.\n\nDuring afternoon rehearsals, Rupert plays the piano, mugging and adopting silly voices, as Moore was wont to do a little too often, as his friend and mentor Oscar (Eddie Foy Jnr., once of the all-singing, all-dancing Seven Little Foys family troupe), a former vaudeville act, dances and quips in the background. The larks are interrupted by club owner Jock McCue (played by Duncan Macrae, looking older than his 61 years, and who died not long after production was completed), a stern, Presbyterian sort who seems an unlikely man to run a nightclub. Jock wants to talk to Rupert in his office, but Rupert cries off as he needs to pick up his laundry, and the scene fades without us learning if Rupert’s job is under threat or not, an instance of 30IADAC’s habit of raising dramatic tension before deciding it can’t be bothered to follow it through.\n\nThe British critic Leslie Halliwell described 30IADAC as “a few thin sketches frantically over-directed”, and the following sequence is a prime example. As Rupert explains his plans to Oscar while they walk the streets, director McGrath fragments the dialogue with cuts here, there, and everywhere, as if compensating for a thin script. Aptly enough with these distracting visuals, Oscar tells Rupert he’ll become distracted from his work once married.\n\nDriving through London in a convertible (another sure sign we’re in a late 1960s British film), Rupert thinks of the great composers and their domestic routines. We see Rupert become Beethoven, up at five-thirty each morning, we’re told; Bach with his children, all of who are jolly excited at being in a film; and “rotten swot” Mozart, who’d written more music as an infant than Rupert could ever hope to compose. All well and good, though the sequence seems written to indulge Moore’s dressing up as famous composers than to move the film on in any way. Rupert decides he needs greater discipline in his life, something Moore might have benefited from in his writing.\n\nRupert arrives at his apartment, part of a tenement run by Mr & Mrs Woolley, two of the most interesting characters in 30IADAC. Mr Woolley (Northern Irish actor Harry Towb), a man of few words, is often seen furiously polishing the couple’s car, with neither yet able to drive; Mrs Woolley (Patricia Routledge, still going strong at the age of 87) refers to her husband as ‘Daddy’ and runs a pre-natal exercise clinic, even though the couple appear childless. Displacement activity was never so displaced as this, and Mrs Woolley in particular regards Rupert with maternal benevolence. Dotty neighbors, or in this case landlords, are a staple of British comedy, and Routledge and Towb, British screen regulars, are a delight whenever they appear on screen.\n\nThe laundry arrives – via the post, sent by his mother, along with a packet of sherbert lemons and a slice of bread pudding. A letter reveals Rupert left home only three months ago; Sparky the cat “is in disgrace”; Rupert’s parents feel he’s too young for marriage; mother had a bad turn recently and required medical attention. And if you think the latter is a relevant plot point, you’re mistaken, as Rupert’s parents merit not another mention during the course of the film.\n\nThe telephone in the outside hallway rings (a sentence certain to make readers of a certain age feel old) and Rupert answers, only to find the call is for his new neighbor, Louise Hammond (played by Moore’s then girlfriend and future ex-wife Suzy Kendall). There’s a fun scene where Rupert stands holding the clunky handset while Louise argues with her boyfriend Paul while clad in only a towel. No sooner is the call over than Rupert fantasizes of winning Louise’s heart – we see Moore as a cowboy, a Valentino-style Sheikh, a top hat and tails playboy (as if previewing his success as Arthur (1981)) and a stock car racer – not NASCAR, but the British BriSCA formula, those curious little vehicles that resemble shoehorns on wheels. In his daydream, Rupert races his car (in what looks like the now defunct Harrengay stadium), only to become involved in a pile-up.\n\nA lucid daydreamer, Rupert screams. Louise reappears at the door, puzzled. “There isn’t a doorbell,” Rupert explains, and fearing her neighbor is unwell, Louise invites him in for coffee. “Oh, you do your own cooking,” states Rupert. One is never quite sure whether Rupert is serious or joking and Louise doesn’t quite know what to make of this odd little man, though she soon takes to Rupert.\n\nAn art student and school teacher, Louise’s flat is full of sketches and paintings. Rupert contributes his own painting – well, paint is used, at any rate – of a stick man, a flower, and a boat, of the sort decorating family fridges the world over. Louise likes it though, and we later see it take pride of place on her apartment wall.\n\nA phone call for Rupert – it’s his agent, Victor (Peter Bayliss), who awaits Rupert in his office for a meeting about the proposed musical. Could Rupert possibly call round, as he should have done an hour and a half ago, in the next four minutes? As we’re in theaterland, it comes as little surprise that Victor is portrayed as gay (or camp at the very least), with a flamboyant turn of phrase to match his pink shirt and polka dot night-gown, though why his trousers are undone is more of a mystery. Ares gay men prone to have their trousers undone? Such are the questions unusual films provoke.\n\nThere follows a rather tiresome montage of Rupert’s dash to Victor’s office, in the style of the contemporary opening titles to the BBC sports program Grandstand (bet that played well in Peoria) and Rupert makes it just in time. Victor introduces Rupert to director Horst Cohen (Ted Dicks Jnr), choreographer Gore Taylor (Johnathan Routh, with immense eyebrows) and financial backer, the Honorable Gavin Hopton, a Warhol-esque figure played with an icy slither by satirist John Fortune. There’s a lot of peculiar dialogue relating Rupert’s contract and who gets a cut of what, before Victor introduces us to his huge drinks cabinet, even though his guests agree to share a single glass of cold milk with which to toast future success. Rupert is more interested in replicating the picture he drew for Louise, who we see interjecting with dialogue via some tricksy special effects overlaid upon Rupert’s contract. As Rupert signs, the musical score turns portentous, as if Rupert is making a terrible mistake, but again, this suggestion isn’t borne out by the subsequent action, leaving us to ponder what’s going on behind 30IADAC‘s curious moments of emphasis.\n\nReturning to his flat, Rupert is invited in for dinner by Louise. After he’s explained his dual objective for the next six weeks, Rupert provides his motivation: “Shelley was dead by the time he was 28. If you haven’t made it by the time you’re 30, you never will. Ask anybody!” Louise doesn’t know why Rupert’s in a rush: “life doesn’t end at thirty any more than it begins at forty…you’re just playing with numbers.” This said, it’s rather strange Louise herself also has an arbitrary target in mind: “I’m having five kids by the time I’m 30.” “Can I help?” offers Rupert; “no, I can manage on my own,” replies Louise. They’re both referring to the washing-up – probably. One of 30IADAC‘s charms, and there are many, comes in this type of double-meaning and wordplay, and it’s a shame it neglects this aspect as the film continues.\n\nRupert shows off his musical skills on the piano Louise just so happens to own, and launches into an annoying parody of Noel Coward, then changes tack in a spectacular fashion as we’re treated to a jazz song, ‘The Real Stuff’, set in an ultra-cool club where everyone dresses in white and Rupert serenades Louise on a revolving piano. Dudley Moore’s wonderful performance here is one of the highlights of 30IADAC as he sings his own composition. The song ends with Rupert and Louise kissing on the floor. Sadly for the budding romance, Louise intends to meet Paul later.\n\nThe scene shifts to Jock’s Box, run with military fervor by Jock, who addresses the waitresses as if they were his troops. Rupert joins the line-up and after some impenetrable business over Jock inspecting their fingernails, we see Jock the compere working the audience, i.e., telling them to stop eating as he wants to introduce the first act: a pair of satirists named Jackson & Faraday. Well, it would be the first act, if Jackson & Faraday had showed up, but they haven’t. Quite what the point of this is beyond me; maybe Moore was sending up viewer expectations of some Peter Cook-style political comedy (earlier in the film, Rupert is seen reading a copy of Private Eye, the satirical magazine set up by Cook). It’s a joke without a punchline, and it’s a rare comedy film that can afford such indulgences. On the bright side, it allows Jock to introduce the house band, with Dudley Moore joined by the other members of his trio, for a pleasing jazz instrumental. After this, clubgoers including Louise and Paul, flood the dancefloor, only to be stopped by Jock, who calls an intermission (“they’re not drinking!”) and reminds everyone the club doesn’t accept credit cards. Because he is Scottish. Geddit?\n\nWhile getting changed after his performance, Rupert overhears Louis and Paul (Nicky Henson) arguing in a back alley. Paul wants Louise to return home with him, but Louise will not consent, arguing “I’m just another car to you.” The row threatens to turn violent, with Paul trying to drag Louise away by the arm. Rupert intervenes; Paul looks the pianist up and down, which doesn’t take very long. “You were right,” Paul tells Louise. “There’s isn’t anybody else!” A rubbish, middle-class scuffle breaks out, ending with Paul disposing of Rupert by throwing him through the nearest window.\n\nRupert, his left arm in plaster, phones Jock from the doctor’s surgery, asking for leave of absence. Jock, ever compassionate, reminds Rupert that Ravel composed a sonata for one hand and expects to see Rupert at the club tonight or he’ll see Rupert in court. The doctor treating Rupert in this brief scene is played by Clive Dunn, normally a reliable comedy stalwart who specialized in playing old men, yet here he somehow manages to suck the life out of the scene, flattening a nice gag about a patient wrapped head to foot in bandages.\n\nDeficient in the arm department to the tune of one, Rupert meets Louise in a pub garden, as this is the one day of the English summer when the nation’s pub gardens aren’t under an inch of rain water. Rupert drinks a pint of what looks like apple juice, as even English beer wasn’t that odd a color in 1968, though Watney’s Red Barrel pushed it close. There’s a rare degree of tension in the air as Rupert accuses Louise of still caring for Paul; “your broken arm has gone to your head,” Louise tells him, though as with Jock’s threat of legal action, this antagonism soon dissipates. Rupert feels it’s time to work on his musical somewhere far away, “Tahiti, China, anywhere.”\n\n‘Anywhere’ transpires as Dublin, or ‘Dublin, Ireland’ as a caption helpfully informs the viewer. Oscar has joined Rupert on his musical mission, and it’s only when they arrive in Dublin harbor he remembers he’s got a letter for Rupert from his doctor, to the effect that his arm isn’t broken after all. Rupert casts aside his cast, upon which he’s written ‘Rupert Loves Louise.’\n\nOscar tells Rupert his life story as they walk to their lodgings (The Wall hotel, should you wish to make pilgrimage), of his early stage success (“I was 24, I had shirts made in London, my hair cut in Rome”) and of a girlfriend in the chorus line who became so jealous of Oscar’s rise to fame, she sabotaged his stage entrance with marbles, which isn’t a very girlfriend-y thing to do. “I was in pieces, she was in Salt Lake City, with a Hungarian ventriloquist.” None of this is strictly relevant to proceedings, though gives us something to listen to us we follow Rupert and Oscar around various Dublin sights.\n\nEnsconced in his hotel room, Rupert wonders if Louise will ask him to sing at her and Paul’s wedding. This leads to a painful sequence were Rupert sees himself in the mirror as a jester with a lute, and the two sing a medieval-style duet, and it’s every bit as awkward as those words suggest. 30IADAC grinds to a complete halt for the sake of showcasing Dudley Moore’s musical versatility, which the pint-sized polymath has already proved to the viewer’s delight.\n\nInspiration fails to strike Rupert, who hammers out climaxes, crescendos and little else. Taking a walk only brings out more autobiographical details from Oscar, and so Rupert leaves him to it and ducks into none other than a Martello Tower, of Ulysses fame. Inside, 30IADAC takes another turn for the peculiar.\n\nThis tower contains not medical students and eejit English, but candlelight and a rapt audience awaiting the words of the Storyteller, (Michael MacLiammoir) who lays in a brass bed having partaken of nothing except whisky for twelve months. Because he is Irish. Geddit?\n\nPreferring to tell his story with the use of dolls, the Storyteller relates the legend of Mehaul and Myra, “long ago, when snakes were still in Ireland.” For this sequence, Moore plays Mehaul and Kendall plays Myra, made up to look like puppets, and emote only in an expressionistic manner.\n\nMehaul is off to seek his fortune, leaving his beloved Myra in the care of Black Sean, which was Mehaul’s first mistake. Returning ten years later, which is another mistake, Black Sean, rather fond of Myra himself, tells Mehaul she married a Saxon lord and Mehaul believes this unverified tale, mistake number three. Throwing his expensive carriage into a river, Mehaul tears off his fine clothes, coats himself with mud and lives in a cave for 70 years, and I think we should stop counting the mistakes at this point. Myra, meanwhile, lives in a nearby cottage where she (very) patiently waits for her truelove to return.\n\nOne night, a storm breaks, and a flood carries Mehaul to the cottage and he is smashed through the front door, breaking every bone in his body, including those weird fiddly little bones in your inner ear. Reunited, Mehaul and Myra die and go to Heaven, whereas Black Sean is struck by lightening and doesn’t get to go anywhere.\n\nThe next we know, Rupert is wading along the shore, Stephen Dedalus-style, except Stephen didn’t play the violin while so doing. “I’ve got my musical, Oscar,” cries Rupert. Oscar reminds Rupert he has only 3 weeks until his birthday. “So what? Handel wrote ‘The Messiah’ in 3 weeks, in Dublin,” a fact which I suspect James Joyce told anyone prepared to listen. We see Rupert as Handel, sending his manuscript to London, and his laundry to his mother in Leigh-on-Sea.\n\nRupert and Oscar return to ‘London, England’ (thanks, movie), only to find Louise has left the care of Mr & Mrs Woolley for a teaching job in Birmingham – and she left, it seems, with Paul. To make matters worse, Mrs Woolley informs Rupert all his post was destroyed by Mr Woolley who, drunk on sherry, became convinced his wife had embarked on an illicit correspondence with Geraldo (a popular dance band leader of the 1940s and 1950s). Between them, Rupert, Mrs Woolley, and Oscar glue together a postcard sent by Louise to Rupert. The message: “work hard.” Rupert determines to seek out Louise in ‘Birmingham, England,’ just in case you thought Rupert had traveled to Alabama.\n\nWhile in Birmingham, Rupert frequently phones Oscar to update him on his lack of progress, and it becomes clear the former vaudevillian is making drastic changes to Rupert’s musical without his knowledge, with Victor, Horst, and Hopton increasingly suspicious at to Rupert’s absence. Hopton expresses his concerns to Victor, who’s getting a cup of ‘coffee’ from a rudimentary vending looking like an assemblage of spare parts leftover from R2-D2. “‘Then”, said Mr Bankes, “there is that liquid the English call coffee,'” wrote Virginia Woolf in To The Lighthouse (1927); Mr Bankes wouldn’t even describe what Victor drinks as liquid, especially after the agent spits out one of the coins he inserted into the machine in the first place.\n\nAnyhow, Hopton tells Victor if Rupert doesn’t show up soon, and put his signature on a future options contract, Hopton will pull out of the deal. Or, as Hopton puts it, “Confucius he say, ‘if he no show – no show.'” And yes, John Fortune pulls his eyes aslant to mimic a Chinese person, and I daresay Fortune cringes to this day to think about it.\n\nThe desperate Victor enlists the aid of a private detective named Herbert Greenslade (played by John Fortune’s fellow satirist and future comedy partner, John Bird). And if you guessed we’re heading along the well-worn path into spoof Raymond Chandler/Humphrey Bogart territory, you are horribly correct. Greenslade narrates his parts of the film in a fake American accent as he searches the industrial wastelands of Birmingham for Laura (who he finds quickly) and Rupert (who he doesn’t). It’s all so balls-achingly dull you sigh with relief when Greenslade finally reunites Rupert with Laura.\n\nRelieved at finding his sweetheart (what happened to Paul?), Rupert tells Louise there’s no rush to return to London, as “the musical can look after itself.” Greenslade disagrees; unless Hopton’s documents are signed by 7.00pm, the show is off. Oh, and it’s September the 13th, though technically it’s not Rupert’s birthday until 9.30pm, as that’s when he was born. All a little convenient, but at last we’ve some dramatic impetus now.\n\nA flight to London is out of the question as it’s Friday the 13th and so would mean certain death (really?). Greenslade therefore drives Rupert and Louise to London in his khaki-colored Ford Popular.\n\nFirst things first, and Rupert and Louise are married by the Registrar, with the Woolleys, Oscar, and Victor attending. “Just in time,” comments the Registrar, leading Louise to ask what he means. Checking the certificate, Louise realizes the truth: “this was made out three weeks ago – Bluebeard!” Louise punches Rupert and walks out, because who doesn’t enjoy a fight at a wedding?\n\nLater, it’s time for the premiere of Rupert’s musical, ‘The Golden Legend of Erin’. A TV presenter (Derek Farr) informs us Irishmen from all over the UK have gathered to attend the musical, and yes, it’s hilarious national stereotype time, with all the rowdy Irishmen (no women are seen) shown as wearing brown overcoats, flat caps, and swigging alcohol. The musical begins with Rupert none the wiser as to his new wife’s whereabouts, though he might want to check the Race Relations Board.\n\nCurtain up and Rupert’s down: “what’s Oscar doing up there?” asks our composer as his mentor hoofs and jigs upon the stage. Instead of the doubtless sensitive and intricate interpretation of Irish legend penned by Rupert, the audience are presented with a musical seemingly written by your drunk work buddies after spending the night at O’Flanagan’s Genuine Old-Time Downtown Shamrock Bar on St Patrick’s Day; various ‘Irish folk’ take to the stage and dance, “signifying happiness the only way simple villagers know how.” It’s ‘Springtime for Hitler’ via the Emerald Isle and Rupert is in despair. As the audience laughs and hoots, Rupert storms the stage, pleading for the show to stop. Checking his watch, Rupert sees it’s half past nine: “I’m thirty!”\n\nWe enter Rupert’s tormented psyche once more, as he stands atop a birthday cake as various characters circle around chanting “it’s awful, it’s awful, it’s awful.” Rupert wails as he falls through a trapdoor in the cake…\n\n…however, the audience aren’t chanting “it’s awful” but “author, author!” The Irish in the audience tumble over, and indeed through, the balcony to invade the stage through sheer joy and join in the production. The musical is a success! Terrible, racist, but a success!\n\nRupert spots Louise in the wings. “I do love you, you know, birthday or no birthday.” “I know,” replies the new Mrs Street, and they return home. As they prepare for bed, Rupert reads a very unlikely newspaper horoscope, to the effect that a child born during an eclipse next June 13th will be the Second Coming, or whatever. Rupert performs a quick calculation in his head and then springs upon the awaiting Louise, her arms outstretched. This freeze-frames for THE END, giving us the image used on 30IADAC‘s publicity poster, because back then, trailers and posters were the original spoiler trolls.\n\nFor a film publicized as the epitome of the swinging Sixties (this being Columbia Pictures’ take on Moore’s work), 30IADAC has a sweet, old-fashioned feel; with a few tweaks here and there, and add a bevy of dancing girls, and you might have a modern take on the ‘Big Broadcast’ films of the 1930s, albeit one showcasing the talents of one particular star. Moore performs better than his comedy partner Peter Cook does in his one solo film, The Rise and Rise of Michael Rimmer (1970) even if Rimmer is the better film. Moore, perhaps a superior musician and actor than he was a comedian, looks perfectly at ease during 30IADAC, though one would be hard pushed to guess we’re watching a future Hollywood star in the making.\n\nMoore and Cook would reunite for the bleak yet brilliant The Bed-Sitting Room (1969, also starring Frank Thornton) and the riotous ensemble comedy Monte Carlo or Bust! (1969), with their last film the badly received Sherlock Holmes spoof The Hound of the Baskervilles (1978), after which the pair split once more in acrimony. Just a year later, Moore scored a hit with Blake Edwards’ 10 (1979). The story goes that after 10‘s release, Cook traveled to Hollywood from the UK, only to see his erstwhile partner’s face plastered across LA’s billboards before telling the taxi driver to take him back to the airport. The pair were reconciled before Cook’s death in January 1995, while Moore passed away in 2002 after suffering a long period of ill health.\n\nSuzy Kendall and Moore divorced in 1972, yet remained lifelong friends. Jeff Lenburg argues the character of Louise is unnecessary to 30IADAC, and Moore had intended the film as purely about Rupert writing his musical, making 30IADAC‘s conceit yet more slender, and it’s practically transparent as it is. Lenburg admits Kendall brings “charm and sex appeal” to the film, and she does give Moore someone to talk to as an equal, important given the cast of eccentrics around him. Kendall’s career had already peaked however with this and To Sir With Love (1967), and the majority of her remaining films, before retiring in the mid-1970s, were low-grade British and Italian horror films, with one exception being Diary of A Cloistered Nun (1973) which sounds like a film I must watch as soon as possible.\n\nA curio representing a different time, 30IADAC was carried away on the winds of social change like a dandelion seed, a piece of fluff not without its prettiness (it could have worked harder on the wit, though its does amuse at times). Ten years or so later, the wind would sweep the British film industry away into almost nothing, and how it could have done then to afford such a profligacy of seeds."
