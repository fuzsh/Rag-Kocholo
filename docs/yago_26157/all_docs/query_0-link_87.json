        "text": "Dudley Moore\n\nListen – Dudley Moore – The Real Stuff – MP3\n\nListen – Dudley Moore Trio – Unknown Tune from ’30 Is a Dangerous Age Cynthia’ – MP3\n\nGreetings all.\n\nI hope the beginning of a new week finds you all well.\n\nThis week is the beginning of something major for yours truly (stop by Funky16Corners for the whole story), that will in all likelihood lead to a less stressful life (which can only be good for the blogging and the creativity and what not).\n\nAll of this turmoil makes me want to start the week with something unusual, so, here we go.\n\nThough I suspect that very few of you have never heard of Dudley Moore, I’m pretty sure that a lot of you have no idea that alongside his career as an actor and comedian, he was also a successful musician and composer.\n\nMoore was an accomplished jazz pianist (he recorded in that capacity for several labels) and wrote and performed music for a number of his movies.\n\nThe tune(s) I bring you today hail from the soundtrack of the 1967 film ’30 Is a Dangerous Age Cynthia’ in which Moore starred with his future wife Suzy Kendall. Oddly enough, roundabout 20 years ago, when I had my first apartment, this movie was a fixture on Cinemax and I remember watching it several time, and digging the soundtrack. There was one tune in particular that I fell in love with.\n\nIt was only recently that I managed to grab a copy of the soundtrack album (after winning the 45 of two of the songs, and having it disappear in the mail). So, the album pops through the mail slot, makes it onto the turntable, and lo and behold the song I was looking for turns out not to have been included on the soundtrack!\n\nThere are some cool tunes – including the groovy ‘The Real Stuff’ which I’m posting today – but the instrumental I remembered was nowhere to be found.\n\nSo, I set out on the interwebs, and without to long a search happened upon a clip of this very song on Youtube. I put my considerable digi-ma-tization talents to work and created an MP3 (thanks to whoever posted the film clip, which had fairly decent fidelity), and I’m posting it today.\n\nUnfortunately, no one seems to know what the song is called. As I said it’s not on the soundtrack LP, and as far as I can tell isn’t listed in the credits to the film. It may very well be something the Dudley Moore Trio recorded on a studio album, but if that’s the case, I don’t have it.\n\nIf anyone knows what it is I’d love to know. Until then, it remains the “unknown song” from ’30 Is a Dangerous Age Cynthia’.\n\nThe “known” commodity in today’s post, is the aforementioned ‘Real Stuff’. Moore starts things off in a comedy style, with a tip of the hat to 1920s English pop, taking a sharp left turn into New Orlean-style piano and wild vocals.\n\nI hope you dig both tunes, and I’ll be back later in the week with something even more unsual.\n\nPeace\n\nLarry\n\nPS Head over to Funky16Corners for something spiritual from Louis Armstrong (Yes, Louis Armstrong…)"
