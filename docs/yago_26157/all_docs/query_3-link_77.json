        "text": "1 / 22\n\nSoft-spoken Susie Cave, with her porcelain skin and raven-black hair, sounds and looks like a fairy-tale heroine. The story of her ever-growing brand, The Vampire’s Wife, which began in a tiny room by the sea, likewise has the magic lure of a folk tale—starting with the name. It was dreamt up by the model turned designer and her husband of 20 years, the poet and singer-songwriter Nick Cave. As the moniker suggests, there are Gothic overtones to Cave’s covered yet body-revealing dresses, but her overall aesthetic might better be described as hyperfeminine.\n\nThe Vampire’s Wife Pussy Bow collection is the first of a series created in collaboration with the costume and set designer Alice Babidge. Cave describes the results as more “saturated” than before; they’re also more high-profile, as the garments have been photographed on Susie and Nick’s fabulous friends. It was Babidge who gathered this gorgeous gang to pose in the new line for a campaign featuring Kate Moss, Keira Knightley, and Philip Treacy as well as the lovebird couple. Susie sat with Vogue Runway to spin the tale of The Vampire’s Wife. Once upon a time…\n\nHow did you decide to start The Vampire’s Wife?\n\nI’m quite a shy person, and Nick, my husband, is in the public eye. When I go out with him, I can have a lot of social anxiety, and I never really knew what to wear. Nick’s always immaculate in a black suit and I always was feeling very less than, and so I started designing dresses that gave me confidence.\n\nI overemphasize the female form; the waist, the shoulders—making them quite big so you feel quite strong—but in very simple [shapes] so you’re not fussy. Quite minimal in a way. That’s how it all began; and then it sort of started that people would want to wear them on the red carpet and all that sort of thing. [Recently] Princess Beatrice wore one of my dresses, and she sent me a beautiful letter saying, ‘Thank you, your dress gave me so much confidence and I felt so good and empowered wearing the dress.’ I had spoken to her about the fact that I design dresses to make you feel confident, and subconsciously I think that comes through. I’m not like, ‘Oh, I’ve got to build these dresses that make women Amazonian,’ but I think sometimes when you have an intent, it somehow goes into the fabric of the idea.\n\nYou only have to sometimes think of something—and that can work positively or negatively, so you have to be careful what your intent is always. When people say, ‘Oh, I felt so confident wearing the dress,’ I’m like, Wow! That must really come through. That’s my intent, for everybody who’s wearing the dresses: to feel their best, to feel strong and female in a way that’s not manipulative.\n\nWhat’s special about your latest offering, The Vampire’s Wife Pussy Bow collection?\n\nI started working with this incredible costume and set designer called Alice Babidge, [who] has made costumes for Cate Blanchett. We became friends through my son Earl, who’s in this film called True History of the Kelly Gang that Alice [worked on]. She made all of these incredible dresses for men to wear, and she told me that when she was making the costumes, she was thinking of The Vampire’s Wife. [Though] we both were quite shy towards each other, we wanted to work together. The Vampire Wife’s Pussy Bow collection is the first of a series with Alice. [The dresses] are a little bit more saturated, I think, but kind of simpler at the same time. Literally every single dress has a bow somewhere—inside the dress, outside the dress.\n\nIt’s the first time we’ve named a collection. The next one is called The Vampire’s Wife Frill Seeker. Before Pussy Bow, I was quite random and wasn’t really fitting into the collection [schedule]—you know, spring/summer this, autumn/winter that. It was a little bit chaotic. So we decided to try and be a little bit more organized like that.\n\nWhat can you tell us about the campaign?\n\nIt was Alice’s idea to ask friends who’ve been very supportive of me as a person and the brand to be in the campaign. I was too shy to ever ask Keira Knightley, Kate Moss—or anyone—to do [that]; I didn’t want to put them on the spot. But they very kindly agreed to be in the photographs.\n\nEverybody chose what they wanted to wear. We had two rails of clothes and everyone knew exactly what they wanted. Amanda Harlech chose the black velvet dress and Kate immediately chose a little minidress. Amanda is someone I’ve known since I was 17. I know it was a really difficult time for her because Karl Lagerfeld had just died, and she literally got off the plane from his memorial and came straight to the studio without hesitation. I was just amazed. And then there’s Keira Knightley, who’s about to give birth, she came; and Thomas Houseago, the wonderful sculptor, and his partner Muna El Fituri; they were in town and they’re great friends of ours and they agreed. Kate Moss, who I’ve known since she was 16 and I was 22, very kindly agreed [as did] Philip [Treacy] and his husband, Stefan, and the dog. Philip and I have known each other for 30 years, since way, way back. We lived together at one stage. Bella Freud is my best friend for the last 30 years. [All of these people,] they’re really like family to Nick and I. I was really quite overwhelmed that they would be willing to give me the time to do that. It was just wonderful.\n\nIs community an important element of The Vampire’s Wife in general?\n\nI think The Vampire’s Wife as a brand has become a little bit like a community. My husband and I developed the idea of the name together. We started from a little room in Brighton by the sea; it was just literally a tiny little room where I’d sit and design, and it just sort of grew, due to the people who seem to be attracted to it. [Many of them are] other musicians and actors and people who are in a similar world to Nick, [and they] started to gravitate towards us incredibly, fortunately. A lot of performers seem to really enjoy wearing the clothes.\n\nThough many of your dresses are covered-up, they are definitely not for shrinking violets. Can you talk about this dichotomy?\n\nI love, I love, I love, being completely covered, even with a headscarf on, but showing the legs with some wonderful heels. I think that’s lovely because it makes you focus on the legs, or breasts, or whatever is exposed. You know, in architecture, there is talk about the space around things; it’s kind of like that with the dresses I make, too. There’s a definite space around the dress and it’s quite exaggerated and larger than life.\n\nI think to be covered, showing the female form in an exaggerated way is very sexy as well—in the way that I see what I think is sexy as a woman. I think it’s powerful and very attractive to be dressed from head to toe completely covered. [Think of] Audrey Hepburn in Givenchy, Cher in Bob Mackie just looking so incredible [while] covered in rhinestones, and Marilyn and her rhinestone dress singing ‘Happy Birthday’ to the president…. I suppose what’s common in everything that I’m saying is extreme femininity—whether covered or uncovered.\n\n[My work is] a bit playful. I am not prudish in any way. I’ve been naked many times, and on Nick’s album cover for Push the Sky Away. My friend Dominique Issermann was shooting me for a magazine and that ended up being on the cover, and I didn’t have any clothes on. That was sort of a spontaneous thing. I just sometimes think a dress where you’re covered from head to foot is actually more practical because you don’t have to think, you just put one thing on. [I make covered-up dresses and] I also make see-through dresses and incredibly short dresses that literally show your underwear—I make matching underwear for that. My approach is more playful; it happens that it’s sort of coinciding with people wanting to be more covered up. I hope that I appeal to every woman, whether they’re completely covered or not.\n\nWhen I heard that your husband was in the campaign, I wondered if he would be wearing a dress. What are your thoughts on gender fluidity?\n\nI think it’s wonderful that men wear dresses. Honestly, it just feels like the most natural thing in the world to me; it always has done. I’m just thrilled that the boys are wearing dresses in our campaign—and wearing them in whatever way they want to. It’s sort of coinciding with this movement now [towards gender fluidity], which hopefully is going to improve people’s lives. I’m [happy] if we can in any way be supportive of that in the way we represent The Vampire’s Wife.\n\nMy son, Earl, just did this movie in Australia where he’s wearing a dress the entire time. In Australia in 1800s, the men from the Kelly Gang wore their mother’s wedding dresses to look like banshees, to look like ghosts, to scare whoever it was they were robbing. They’d wear white wedding dresses—one of the dresses in the Pussy Bow collection is based on a dress my son wore in the movie; it’s called the Early dress. The Kelly Gang would put their mothers’ wedding veils on, too, and they had these tattoos, and they’d go off and do their robbing the rich to help the poor. That’s a very basic description; I don’t really know all the true ins-and-outs of the movie.\n\nCan you talk about the world that you’re creating with The Vampire’s Wife?\n\nIt’s such a new brand, but it’s very genuine. Every idea is from something that Nick and I have talked about. When Nick and I first met 25 years ago, we found we had very similar interests in what we thought was fascinating. The things that we both found that we loved were quite odd. They were often things that weren’t perfect. We started to sort of put all of these things into the “Stuff” pages on The Vampire’s Wife website. We often discover things at the same time [and] we do the Stuff posts together. It is a little world, which, if you came to our house in Brighton, you could see…. I mean, all of Nick’s songs are written about what he sees: like mermaids, Brighton and the beach, and the view from our house. There’s a lot of lovely history around where we live in Sussex. I’m always trying to evolve and learn as I go. I don’t want to sound like I know exactly what I’m doing; it’s always just taking things from different things—architecture, films, and books—just all sorts of things.\n\nHow do you navigate public/private roles as the founder of a brand and a shy person?\n\nNick is someone who doesn’t have social anxiety. He’s a very confident person. I am like the total opposite. I think I’ve always been attracted to strong personalities, like Nick and all my friends, because I like to hide behind and just be alongside and supportive—but at the same time, not supportive in the way that I don’t have my own life. I’ve worked since I was 14; I’ve always earned my own money.\n\nI am also sort of a weird dichotomy because I am really shy person, but at the same time, I don’t want to be forgotten. I think that’s why I make these dresses. And also as a person, I like to be of service. I have this thing that I like to be helpful to people I love, and that extends outwards to the people who love The Vampire’s Wife, which has become an extended family for me. I’ve always been very much surrounded by men. I’m very close to my father, my brothers. I didn’t have any sisters, and so I always kind of longed for that sort of female relationship which I’d never had. When The Vampire’s Wife took off, suddenly I was getting letters—Florence Welch was writing to me, and Chan Marshall, Cat Power were writing to me, and Stevie Nicks was asking me for things. And they were quite vulnerable, they were very sweet, [writing]: ‘Might you be able to make this?’ or ‘Might you be able to….’ I suddenly found I was being trusted by all of these incredible women—and not just famous women. It was incredibly warming and beautiful for me.\n\nI think those women sort of gathering around me and asking me for dresses drew me out. It was almost like [hearing] sirens: ‘We need some things.’ I love to be needed and useful. To feel like I can make a dress or be of service appeals to me because I’m also a very maternal kind of person. My mom was very like, ‘You’ve just got to get on with it.’ She wanted to make me really strong and independent, and she did. But it’s kind of lovely to be like a mom to all these people who like my dresses. It does feel like that. I fret when I’m making [a dress for someone]. I have to make sure they have the right underwear and I’ll go and buy it and do everything and, you know, the whole thing—the same as I would if I had a daughter. It gives me a purpose. God knows what I’d be doing otherwise, I’d be driving Nick completely mad!"
