        "text": "DENNIS WATERMAN lived his life in showbiz – and what a life it was.\n\nThe youngest of nine kids growing up on a council estate in Putney, South London, he went from child actor to national treasure, playing tough guys in two of Britain’s most successful TV series – The Sweeney, alongside John Thaw, and Minder, with George Cole as Arthur Daley.\n\nDennis, who died on Sunday aged 74, spent 12 years on crime drama New Tricks, as retired cop Gerry Standing.\n\nAway from the cameras, the headlines revolved around Dennis’s affair and turbulent relationship with his Minder co-star Rula Lenska in the Eighties.\n\nHere, using his own words, we bid a fond farewell to a telly great.\n\nON PARENTS ROSE AND HARRY\n\nDENNIS’S mum Rose made curtains for a living, while Harry was an upholsterer who became a ticket collector at Clapham Junction station.\n\nThe youngest of nine, Dennis said: “I was a big surprise.\n\n\"I was spoiled rotten. I was golden b*****ks.\n\n\"I remember looking at other people’s mothers, thinking, ‘She’s tasty’ as they were 30 years younger than mine.”\n\nON BEING A CHILD ACTOR\n\n“WE became 30-year-olds before we were 12.\n\n\"You’d hear kids say, ‘Oh I’ve got a wonderful part in . . . ’ and I’d think, ‘You should be talking about football’, which I was.\n\n“I did a year in (stage musical) The Music Man.\n\n\"I went to school in the daytime, then straight to the theatre and back home on my own about 11pm.\n\n\"It was a long leafy black lane before we got to our flats.\n\n“My sister said she knew how frightened I was by how loud I whistled.”\n\nON DATING DUD’S GIRL\n\nAT 19 Dennis secretly dated Dudley Moore’s girlfriend, actress Suzy Kendall — his co-star in 1968 film Up The Junction.\n\nHe said: “We met up everywhere, sometimes risking meeting in the flat she shared with Dudley.\n\n“One afternoon I had the effrontery to be playing Dudley’s piano when he walked in. I don’t think he suspected anything.\n\n\"He was the hottest thing in London — why should he fear a callow 19-year-old working with his bird?”\n\nON MEETING HELEN MIRREN\n\nTHE two met while acting at the Royal Court theatre, between 1965 and 1968.\n\nDennis recalled: “Oh God, she was tasty. It was like Marilyn Monroe walking into the room.”\n\nAs for his acting abilities, he said: “Well, The Sweeney and Minder, one has to say, I could have done in my sleep.\n\n\"Although I hate saying that because it is harder than people think to make yourself look like a normal person.\n\n\"They were very successful programmes and at that time, if you were popular, you were considered to be not very good.”\n\nON GETTING THE ACTING BUG\n\n“MY oldest sister, Joy, ran her own amateur dramatics society and dragged us all in.\n\n\"My mother played piano a bit, the East End knees-up job, but I don’t really know where it all came from.\n\n\"I’d failed my 11-plus — I don’t know how, I wasn’t stupid, but obviously didn’t think it was that important.\n\n\" Another one of my sisters met some people who went to Corona (the West London theatre school where he trained) and suggested I have a go at that.\n\n\"I went along and had a smashing time.\"\n\nWHAT HE TOLD HANNAH AT 14\n\nHIS daughter Hannah played Laura Beale in EastEnders from 2000 to 2004.\n\nWhen she was 14, Dennis gave her some worldly advice and recalled: “I was worried I wasn’t much of a role model.\n\n“I said, ‘You’ve seen how I live — the drinking, the smoking and the various other things I get up to.\n\n“Well, you don’t have to be the same. In fact, it might be a very good idea not to drink as much as I do, to smoke as much as I do — to do anything I do, as much as I do!”\n\nON FALLING FOR RULA LENSKA\n\nDENNIS fell in love with Rula Lenska, who went on to become his third wife, while he was married to actress Patricia Maynard and she was married to actor Brian Deacon.\n\nHe said: “It happened so suddenly and it was total. I can only compare it to being hit in the stomach by a ten-ton bag of cement.\n\n“We didn’t know what to do. We did try to part in an attempt to save our marriages, but it was hopeless.\n\n\"It was horrible and we were so unhappy.\n\n“I knew that in the public eye we were cast as the villains.\n\n\"But we just felt we were caught in a situation and we tried to make it as painless as we could.\"\n\n... AND ADMITTING HE HIT HER\n\n“SHE certainly wasn’t a beaten wife. She was hit, and that’s different.\n\n\"It’s not difficult for a woman to make a man hit her.\n\n“The problem with strong, intelligent women is that they can argue well.\n\n“And if there is a time when you can’t get a word in . . . I lashed out, when frustration builds up and you can’t think of a way out.\n\n\"It happened, and I’m very, very ashamed of it.”\n\nON THE SWEENEY\n\nTHE Sweeney ran from 1975 to 1978, starring John Thaw as Met Police Flying Squad Detective Inspector Jack Regan and Dennis as Detective Sergeant George Carter.\n\nDennis recalled: “We certainly had an impact on the police.\n\n\"When we started, they didn’t want anything to do with us, but then they realised it was quite healthy for the public to see that the police were as tough as the villains.\n\n\"Then they got worried that their wives would realise what they were up to.”\n\nON JOHN THAW\n\n“WE shot only in the seedier sides of London. We filmed in more gutters and derelict pubs than you’d believe.\n\n“We were surrounded by villains.\n\n\"At lunchtime, John and I would go into the pub as we occasionally liked a half to relax, and someone would go, ‘Oi!’\n\n\"We thought, ‘Here we go. It’s all going to be off in a minute’, and they would say, ‘You’re exactly like the geezer who nicked me’.\n\n\"And we’d think, ‘Thank Christ for that’.\n\n“A couple of times, at the end of the day, John said, ‘Let’s go up to the Serpentine and get a boat out’.\n\n\"It was a strange thing to do, but great fun.”\n\nON WORKING WITH GEORGE COLE ON MINDER\n\n“I WAS cast first and I was told George Cole was going to do it, and he had done a wonderful serial called A Man Of Our Times, about a middle-aged man who is made redundant and his whole life is shattered by it all.\n\n“I thought he was much too nice and too posh to play Arthur Daley. I obviously underrated his expertise a great deal.\n\n“We were both from South London, we were both child actors who had made it through to adults and he had a wicked sense of humour.\n\n\"We just, after two or three days, realised how much we liked working with each other.\n\n\"I went to a party he threw commemorating the 40th year of his first job and I was amazed at the galaxy of famous people there, all laughing.\n\n\"He had that magical quality, you just looked at George and you smiled.\n\n“He was a complete dream, he was the most professional person and just about the nicest person.\n\n\"He was loved by everybody who worked with him.”\n\nON RETIRING TO SPAIN\n\nIN 2015, Dennis began a sunshine retirement with his fourth wife Pam Flint.\n\nHe said: “I’m not rushing about looking for work — I’ll see how far the money goes.\n\n“I have found out a remarkable thing about myself is that I’m really, really good at doing f*** all.”\n\nON BEING FAMOUS\n\n“I QUITE enjoy it. The lucky thing about my image is people firmly believe they know me.\n\n“I get asked a lot of time, because I usually play a hard man, ‘Did you ever have any trouble?’ and I didn’t — apart from the occasional photographer you’ve got to whack out of conscience.\n\n“People say, ‘Come and meet my mum’.\n\n\"I get treated like one of the family. If it has to happen, I’ve had it the nicest way — it can get a bit intrusive but it doesn’t go on for ever.\n\n“It’s lucky I’ve been successful, because I can’t do anything else.”"
