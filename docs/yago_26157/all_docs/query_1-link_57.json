        "text": "\"I'm sorry, Rupie. Hey, where you goin'?\"\n\n\"I've got to find Louise.\"\n\n\"But, uh...\"\n\n\"Look, no buts, you look after the show.\"\n\n\"But...\"\n\n\"I'll only be a couple of days. I'll ring you, all right?\"\n\n\"Can I just say one thing?\"\n\n\"All right, say it, but I'm still going.\"\n\n\"That's my suitcase you've got.\"\n\nI recorded this off of Turner Classic Movies some time ago and just got around to sitting down and watching it. I can't say that I was really amused by it, but Dudley Moore seems to play the piano very well and it's the first meeting between him and Suzy Kendall, who he was married to for about four years. Not much more to say than that.\n\nPoor Dudley Moore — in 1968 he wrote this movie, starred in it, composed its score and it’s songs, plays piano with his jazz trio in it, and romances his then-wife Suzy Kendall and it’s so little remembered that I’m the third person to review it since Letterboxd debuted in 2011.\n\nMaybe Dudley needed to direct this one too — fun script and game actors lead a Swingin’ London era satire on old movie cliches and story conventions would have worked better with a creative director with some visual flair and a sense of pace.\n\nGreat character actors through out.\n\nI was saving this one up to watch on the day I turned 30 in the hope that it might prove itself revelatory viewing in some way, but the movie is mostly a failure, which doesn't entirely prevent it from being mildly likeable in spots, very much like me. Watching a bug-eyed Dudley Moore look directly at the camera, have a royal freak-out and anguishly and hysterically shout \"I'M THIRTY!!!!\" before the scene abruptly cuts to a nightmare sequence that ends with a proverbial pie in the face was somewhat amusing. Bad movie, though still not nearly as bad as turning 30.\n\nDudley Moore needed to ripen a little before he was ready to carry a movie (by himself, without Peter Cook to balance him out). He co-wrote this debut solo starring vehicle, as well as composing the score, and he comports himself as if he were afraid the audience might burn the theater down if they felt they weren't getting enough of him. The director, Joseph McGrath, who had much more to be modest about than Moore, was not the man to teach him about the value of self-restraint, or anything else."
