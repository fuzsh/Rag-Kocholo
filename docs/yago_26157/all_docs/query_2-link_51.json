        "text": "Hollywood has turned out in force to cheer on the greatest athletes in the world at the Olympic Games. Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes, Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban, Snoop Dogg, Tom Cruise, Flavor Flav, Ariana Grande and others have relished the opportunity to be fans — though they’ve drawn many of their own in the process.\n\nEva Mendes and Ryan Gosling\n\nThese two are rarely seen together at public events, but they changed things up for the Games. The couple, together since filming The Place Beyond the Pines in 2011, checked out the dressage individual grand prix freestyle at the Palace of Versailles. Later, they watched the artistic gymnastics women’s uneven bars final — apparently joined by their two daughters: Esmeralda, 9, and Amada, 8.\n\nTom Cruise\n\nThe actor, on a break from making Mission: Impossible 8, was in the audience for the women’s gymnastics qualifiers — Simone Biles’s Olympic return — as well as swimming. Giving a performance of his own in the stands, he was out of his seat cheering, clapping and giving a double thumbs-up. Cruise also allowed his fellow spectators a fan moment. He went over and took some selfies with them.\n\nIt’s since been revealed that Cruise has a top secret role in the closing ceremony. The action star will reportedly perform one of his signature stunts as a way of handing over the Olympic flag to Los Angeles ahead of the 2028 Games.\n\nSnoop Dogg and Martha Stewart\n\nAs NBC’s special correspondent this year, the Snoop-of-all-trades delivered lots of TV gold, whether putting his spin on badminton, rocking custom T-shirts of his favorite Olympians, swimming with Michael Phelps or being trolled by Biles’s mom.\n\nThat was before his celebrity BFF Martha arrived in Paris — and things got even better. The domestic doyenne said her sometime co-star was scared of horses, so she agreed to join him at the Games for four days to help him cover dressage. They were not to be missed as they twinned in equestrian outfits, she unsuccessfully tried to get him to try escargot (“Oh hell no, uh-uh,” he replied) and they worked together to overcome his fear of horses.\n\nJohn Travolta\n\nThe actor had a father-daughter day with Ella Bleu, watching the men’s tennis final between Novak Djokovic of Serbia and Carlos Alcaraz of Spain. They also watched men’s gymnastics.\n\nKendall Jenner\n\nWhat is an event, anywhere in the world, without a Kardashian in attendance? The Kardashians star and model knew she looked cute in her Team USA gear at the women’s gymnastics all-around — and snapped a selfie blowing a kiss.\n\nGuy Fieri\n\nThe Food Network chef demonstrated just how much Hollywood star power there was in the stands. The Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives star shared a selfie — during the men’s tennis finals — that also included chef Bobby Flay, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, Travolta and actor Sacha Baron Cohen.\n\nCynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande\n\nThe Wicked co-stars are already well into their movie promotion, appearing together — in pink and green, no less! In addition to their appearance at the opening ceremony, they were in the stands for the gymnastics competition.\n\nJohn Legend and Chrissy Teigen\n\nThe musician and his model wife brought the family — well, two of their four kids (Luna, 8, and Miles, 6) — for the fun.\n\nLegend and Teigen attended the opening ceremony and were in the stadium waving flags and cheering on Simon Biles, Suni Lee and the others during the gymnastics qualifiers. They also watched swimming, with Teigen and the others making some noise in the crowd.\n\n\"This was on our bucket list,” Legend told Reuters. \"They represent the best of America and we are so proud and excited for them. Let's go, USA.\"\n\nHoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie\n\nThe Today show co-anchors have been busy covering the Olympics for NBC, but they squeezed in the artistic gymnastics women's team final on July 30 to make some noise for Biles, Suni Lee, Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey and Hezly Rivera.\n\nNatalie Portman\n\nAlso in attendance at the women's gymnastics final was Portman, who couldn't contain her excitement as the U.S. team won gold and Biles became the most decorated U.S. gymnast in Olympic history.\n\nNicole Kidman and Keith Urban\n\nThe seal hands were back as the Oscar-winning actress watched the Olympic skateboarders alley-oop and airwalk alongside her musician husband and their daughters, Sunday, 16, and Faith, 13. (Kidman also shares daughter Bella and son Connor with ex-husband Cruise.) But no harm, no foul because they looked like they were having a great time. The fam also watched the women's gymnastics team final.\n\nMariska Hargitay\n\nThe Law & Order: SVU star rooted for \"glorious Katie\" Ledecky and the American swimmers on July 31 alongside her husband, Peter Hermann, and two of their children, son Andrew and daughter Amaya.\n\nHargitay later celebrated Ledecky's eighth career gold and 12th career Olympic medal with the swimmer's family. She also shared hugs with decorated Olympic gymnasts Suni Lee and Jordan Chiles, who were shy to meet her.\n\nLady Gaga\n\nThe singer went from performer during opening ceremony to superfan. Decked out in Team USA gear, she watched gymnastics and swimming with reported fiancé Michael Polansky by her side.\n\nGaga, who will soon be in the Joker sequel, also posed for photos with fans.\n\nOn Friday, Gaga wowed the crowd with her pink pom-pomed performance of “Mon Truc en Plume,” a tribute to French dancer/actor/singer Zizi Jeanmaire. It’s since been reported that it was actually prerecorded due to safety reasons, due to the rain.\n\nCeline Dion\n\nThe singer delivered a triumphant performance closing out the opening ceremony on July 26. It was Dion’s first time performing since she announced she was diagnosed with the rare autoimmune neurological disorder stiff-person syndrome in 2022. It was emotional to watch, even for NBC commentator Kelly Clarkson, a fellow singer, who said Dion deserved the gold medal for vocal athletes.\n\nJudd Apatow, Leslie Mann, Elizabeth Banks and Max Handelman\n\nBanks, star of the upcoming film Skincare, has attended several different events with husband Handelman — including swimming, cycling and tennis — but they made beach volleyball a fun foursome with Apatow and Mann.\n\nSpike Lee\n\nWho was rooting on the USA basketball team? The film director — and Knicks lover — himself, of course, with an Olympic jersey for the occasion paired with a hat repping his home team.\n\nMick Jagger\n\nThe Rolling Stones frontman, off of his band's \"Hackney Diamonds Tour,\" logged some family time with his youngest child, Deveraux, while watching fencing.\n\nFlavor Flav\n\nThe Public Enemy rapper has showed his mad love for water polo at the games. He's the “official hype man” and sponsor of the U.S. women’s team (yes, really) and has been bringing his signature energy to events, which he's attended wearing a water polo cap and clock shades.\n\nNick Jonas\n\nThe singer took a jaunt to Paris for a few days to catch the games. While watching Biles and Co. on the mat, he chatted up Legend and Teigen in their luxury box. He was also there for the fashion. He attended a star-studded event at Team USA outfitter Ralph Lauren’s Parisian eatery, Ralph’s Restaurant.\n\nKelly Clarkson\n\nThe singer and talk show host is on the payroll for NBC as she does commentary during the games. She and Peyton Manning received mixed reviews for their opening ceremony coverage, but the show — and the commentary — goes on.\n\nColin Jost\n\nThe Saturday Night Live star — who's an \"avid surfer,\" according to NBC — is also working the Olympics — but not from Paris. He's covering the surfing competition in Tahiti. His sports commentary gig hasn't been without incident; he injured his foot on a coral reef.\n\nGreta Gerwig\n\nOne row down from Cruise during the women’s gymnastics qualifications was the Barbie director.\n\nQueen Latifah\n\nWearing red, white and blue and waving a flag, the entertainer cheered on the U.S. men’s basketball team.\n\nChristopher Meloni\n\nAhead of Law & Order: Organized Crime Season Five, Meloni was in Paris for the Games. With his wife by his side, he watched men's skateboarding, took a selfie with Snoop and attended the Ralph Lauren event.\n\nJuliette Binoche\n\nThe French actress attended the women's gymnastics team final in her hometown.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick\n\nThe couple brought their three kids — James Wilkie, 21, and twins Tabitha and Marion, 15, to the opening ceremony.\n\nParker and Broderick, seen rocking USA sports jackets, and their kids also watched gymnastics — where SJP had a warm greeting for Kotb — and beach volleyball.\n\nNina Dobrev and Shaun White\n\nThe Vampire Diaries actress and the three-time Olympic gold medal-winning snowboarder have been spotted all over the place — the opening ceremony, the gymnastic qualifiers and fashion parties (Louis Vuitton and Ralph Lauren) — despite Dobrev being on the mend after surgery stemming from an e-bike crash.\n\nAt one point, White was snapped pushing Dobrev through a crowd in a wheelchair, as it’s her first time out without crutches. That’s dedication!\n\nPharrell Williams\n\nThe musician turned designer participated in the Olympic torch-bearing relay, attended the opening ceremony and also hosted Louis Vuitton’s star-studded pre-Olympics bash, which drew celebrities including LeBron James, Steven Spielberg, Charlize Theron, Mick Jagger, Zendaya, Jeremy Allen White and Rosalía, John Mulaney, Sophia Bush and Zac Efron.\n\nSalma Hayek\n\nThe Magic Mike's Last Dance actress also participated in the torch relay. On social media, she called it an honor, adding, “I was proud to represent the enduring spirit of the Olympics, bringing light, hope, and unity to all.”\n\nDon't miss a medal!
