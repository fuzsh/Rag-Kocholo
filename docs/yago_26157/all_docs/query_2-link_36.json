        "text": "News: De Beers cancels Aug. sight amid weak demand, moves Oct. sight to Sep. India factories extend August vacations to reduce inventories and support prices. Production down sharply in Jul. and early Aug. Polishers prefer to produce melee because itâ€™s easier to sell; 0.30-3 ct. weak. Kiran Gems to suspend production for 10 days from Aug. 18. Trading centers seasonally quiet. Rough market slow. Petra defers Aug.-Sep. tender of South African goods. Okavango prices drop 5%-15% at Aug. sale. Global stock-market declines create uncertainty, with Dow Jones index -5% since Jul. 31; Signet shares -12%. High expectations for Mumbai IIJS show as India jewelry sales pick up ahead of Diwali and wedding season.\n\nFancies: Fancy-shape prices weaker following strong demand last year and overproduction by manufacturers. US buyers more selective about quality of SIs, rejecting black centers and short ratios. Elongated shapes still preferred. Fancies with medium and short ratios harder to sell. Supply shortages supporting prices for Marquises. Cushions slow. Very well-cut fancy shapes hard to find and commanding premiums. Oversizes trading at higher prices than usual. Off-make, poorly cut fancies illiquid."
