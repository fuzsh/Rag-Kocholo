        "text": "During Chris Ingham’s superb presentation of the life of the great Dudley Moore, he (only once) stumbled over a word. As the announcer at the gig, I wood never distend to such a Paux Fas.\n\nOne of the delights of any show led by Chris is the depth of his research, and the humour of his presentation. I think everyone found something new about Dudley’s life and talent. But as good as it was, the music was what the evening was about, and the music was wonderful.\n\nThe musicians were:\n\nChris was on piano and vocals. He said in effect that he was unequal to the virtuosity of Dudley. I wonder; to me, there was no note out of place, whether the music was dense or sparse. Consider the riot of counter-rhythms on “Amalgam”, while echoing the serene themes played by Paul. The vocals were a riot on their own.\n\nPaul Higgs, who played trumpet (open, wah wah, harmon, straight) and flugel. His soft, clear singing to echo the frenetic piano on “Amalgam”, was lovely. He is such a good player. His enjoyment of the work of the others was lovely to watch. He made the trading of 4’s with George such a treat.\n\nGeorge Double was the drummer. I loved his range of expression was surprising; hand work on “Atlanta”, some beautiful trading on several numbers, and just watching him play. And for the first time for me, he sang, in duet with Paul, as backing vocalists. Way backing vocalists, bh singing by the drums, very funny. You have to be good to be funny.\n\nSimon Thorpe only sang once, but it was clear he enjoyed it. He is a favourite at Fleece Jazz. His work throughout the evening was superb, and the solo on “Sad One for George” was special.\n\nThese guys gave us the joy and the complexity of Dudley Moore’s music. It was an evening to cherish. Steve’s amazing set list below deserves a read.\n\nOur next gig is also a celebration of one of the greats. A trombone led band to honour a drummer? Yes indeed. Art Blakey would be delighted by the work of the Rory Ingham sextet: Rory on trombone, Alex Garnett on sax, James Davison on trumpet, Matt Carter on piano, Misha Mullov-Abbado on bass, and Luke Tomlinson on drums. It will be a high energy, wildly swinging gig.. So do join us for the first gig of the new programme on Wednesday the 8th of May.\n\nTake care,\n\nDave\n\nTHE CHRIS INGHAM QUARTET: THE MUSIC OF DUDLEY MOORE\n\nSETLIST, FLEECE JAZZ 24/4/24\n\nDudley Dell – originally the B-side to his 1961 debut single Strictly for the Birds. Now only available as a bonus track on Authentic Dud Volume 2, the CD reissue of Moore’s 1965 album on Decca Records, The Other Side of Dudley Moore. This quirky two-minute number is best known nowadays as the theme tune to Radio 4’s Quote Unquote. It shares the same chord sequence as My Blue Heaven and contains glancing references to a host of jazz standards.\n\n(Theme tune to) Not Only . . . But Also – Not Only … But Also was the hugely popular TV sketch show that Dudley hosted with Peter Cook between 1964 and 1970. The quirky, angular, Thelonious Monk-inspired theme to Not Only … But Also was the B-side to Pete and Dud’s 1965 Top 20 hit Goodbye-ee. It has virtually vanished from the internet. You’ll find some snippets of Moore playing it on (retrieved) videos of the TV show, but a full recording is not available.\n\nWaterloo – full of labyrinthine chord sequences/ My Blue Heaven (Donaldson/Whiting) – full of Dudley’s characteristic playfulness with a two-step lope on bass and finger-popping on bongos courtesy of Simon Thorpe and George Double respectively.\n\nPoova Nova – from The Other Side of Dudley Moore.\n\nBedazzled Dudley’s best-known song is the recurring theme from the 1967 movie, Bedazzled. It was most memorably delivered by a fictional psych-rock band called Drimble Wedge and the Vegetations, with Peter Cook deadpanning the lyrics (“I’m not available / You fill me with inertia”). Dudley recorded several instrumental versions, recasting the heavily flanged rock song as a gentle bossa nova.\n\nCornfield – from Bedazzled\n\n* * * * * * *"
