        "text": "NOT every celebrity who makes an appearance on behalf of an arts organization does it for love. But one thing is sure about Dudley Moore's concert at the Palace Theater tomorrow night for the benefit of Stamford Theater Works: he'll be doing the show for Susie Fuller.\n\nThe way Ms. Fuller -- a director, longtime friend of Mr. Moore and a member of the theater's board -- remembers it: \"I sent Dudley a letter on Feb. 23 of last year, and I felt the only way was to be straight. So I came right out and wrote, 'Give us a benefit.' Two days later, he called and he said, 'Yes, yes, yes.' \"\n\nWhich is just the way Mr. Moore remembers it. During a phone conversation from Los Angeles, where he has lived since the mid-1970's, Mr. Moore said: \"Yes, I called Susie, and I said yes -- three yesses. And I'll do everything I can do, though I have no idea what that will be.\" 'A Program of Sorts'\n\nMr. Moore, whose pianism is as honorably regarded as his comedy, recently returned from a concert engagement with the Baltimore Symphony, during which he played Mozart's 21st Symphony and Gershwin's \"Rhapsody in Blue.\" And he just recorded an album of \"easy listening\" compositions called \"Songs Without Words.\" So the search for ideas won't be a stretch.\n\n\"I will organize a program of sorts,\" he added, wondering whether the audience \"will want more parodies, more jazz, more ballads, more serious stuff.\" He continued: \"I'm a little wooly on it. It depends on the people and on what amuses me.\"\n\nMr. Moore's new album includes such selections as \"Waltz to Suzy\" (dedicated to his first wife, Suzy Kendall), \"Tuesday\" (for his second wife, Tuesday Weld), \"Patrick\" (for their 15-year-old son) and \"Brogan\" (the name of his present wife \"of two or four years, I can't remember,\" he said).\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
