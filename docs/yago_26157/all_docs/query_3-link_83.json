        "text": "Suzy Izzard has shared an update on her preferred name and pronouns.\n\nThe comedian announced in 2020 that she would be using “she/her” pronouns moving forward, and earlier this year revealed she had begun alternating between her original name and a new moniker.\n\nIn a social media update, Suzy has told fans she now \"prefers\" her new name, but “no one can really get it wrong” as she \"doesn’t mind\" being called Eddie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe posted: “As people may now well know, I have added the name ‘Suzy’ to my names.\n\n“So going forward I am preferring Suzy but I don’t mind Eddie. And I prefer she/her but I don’t mind he/him. So no one can really get it wrong unless they call me Kenneth or Sabrina.\n\n“I am remaining Eddie Izzard in public. Thank you.”\n\nSuzy previously revealed she’d wanted to be called by that name since she “was 10”, and later opened up about the inspiration behind it.\n\nDuring an appearance on on Lorraine, she told the host she used to love watching Suzy Kendall in To Sir With Love as a 10-year-old.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I just thought, ‘I’d like to have that name’, but of course at that time I wasn’t telling anyone,” she recalled.\n\n“I knew I was what seems now to be trans, [but] I couldn’t define it when I was a young kid, I just sort of said, ‘that’s not happening’. And then I took off as Eddie, and I thought, ‘well it doesn’t matter’.”\n\nShe continued: “It’s got Edward John in my passport, so I just thought, what if I add ‘Suzy’ in there? And then all these people are not sure what to say, and I said, ‘I prefer Suzy, but I don’t mind Eddie. I prefer she/her, I don’t mind he/him’.”\n\n“No one can make a mistake with me,” Suzy added, joking: “Unless they call me Gregory or Sabrina, and then that’s not quite right. But everything else, no one can make a mistake, and they can choose.”"
