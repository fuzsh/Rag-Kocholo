        "text": "All the trade papers have cottoned on to the notion of doing half-yearly assessments of the movies on offer. Not suggesting they’ve stolen my idea, of course, but I always find it interesting to see which of my blogs attract more attention than others. So here’s the top-viewed films for January-June 2023.\n\nThe Swinger (1966). No surprises here since this movie is king of the all-time swingers. Ann-Margret stars as a wannabe writer living out her character’s adventures and, in passing, taking every opportunity to shake her booty.\n\nFireball XL5 (2022) The Gerry Anderson 1960s sci fi television series featuring Steve Zodiac, colorized and winning over a new legion of fans.\n\nPlane (2023). Pilot Gerry Butler goes Die Hard on a remote island where his plane crash lands and his passengers are taken hostage by terrorists. No word yet on a sequel but another Den of Thieves 2 is in production.\n\nFraulein Doktor (1969). German spy Suzy Kendall outwits British opposite number during World War One.\n\nVendetta for the Saint (1969).

George Peppard, charged with murdering adulterous wife Jean Seberg, must clear his name.\n\nSgt Ryker (1968). Lee Marvin creates merry hell in Korea. Another compilation of television episodes and revived to cash in on his success.\n\nStagecoach (1966). Ann-Margret, Alex Cord and Bing Crosby head the cast of a decent remake of the John Ford western.\n\n100 Rifles (1969). Raquel Welch and Jim Brown team up to drive out the ruthless Mexicans in a steamy, violent western.\n\nMoment to Moment (1966). Jean Seberg caught up Hitchcockian skulduggery in the South of France.\n\nBaby Love (1969). Linda Hayden as the object of too many people’s affections as she is taken in by a well-off London family.\n\nTitanic (1997). The 3D version of the James Cameron classic, much in the news at the moment after the Titan disaster, which was reissued in advance of the Avatar sequel.\n\nSisters (1969). Nathalie Delon and Susan Strasberg in semi-incestuous Italian drama.\n\nMickey One (1965). Cult Arthur Penn existentialist thriller starring Warren Beatty and a stand-up comedian hiding out from the Mob.\n\nRage (1966). Glenn Ford and Stella Stevens battle a rabies outbreak in Mexico.\n\nSword of Lancelot/Lancelot and Guinevere (1963). Cornel Wilde writes, directs and stars in historical epic.

Provincial teenager Barry Evans tries to get his share of the Swinging Sixties with the help of Judy Geeson.\n\nLady in Cement (1969). Frank Sinatra as private eye Tony Rome makes the mistake of taking on mob moll Raquel Welch as a client.\n\nCan Heironymus Merkin Ever Forget Mercy Humppe and Find True Happiness (1969). Anthony Newley warbles his way through cult musical, another actor-writer-director extravaganza this time mainlining on Fellini and with copious nudity.\n\nThe Invitation (2022). Nathalie Emmanuel finds her lover enmeshed in a Gothic conspiracy.\n\nOnce a Thief (1965). Ann-Margret again, this time in a more serious role as the wife of reformed criminal Alain Delon sucked back into a heist. Directed by Ralph Nelson. Hip jazz score by Lalo Schifrin.\n\nHannibal Brooks (1969). Michael Winner World War Two comedy drama with Oliver Reed making best friends with an elephant.\n\nArabella (1967). Delightful Italian comedy with Virna Lisi trying to seduce various versions of Terry-Thomas.\n\nNaked Under Leather / The Girl on a Motorcycle (1968). Chanteuse Marianne Faithful brings erotic heft to controversial movie, heavily cut for U.S. release. Co-star Alain Delon smokes a pipe.\n\nKing’s Pirate (1967).

Co-stars Faye Dunaway.\n\nWhirlpool / She Died With Her Boots On (1970). Creepy thriller from Jose Ramon Larraz sees top model Vivian Neves terrorized by photographer Karl Lanchbury.
