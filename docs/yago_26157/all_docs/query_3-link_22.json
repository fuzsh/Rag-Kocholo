Here's the list...\n\n200 OLDEST LIVING SCREEN STARS\n\n101 years old\n\n01 Janis Paige (9/16/22)\n\nThis singing stage and screen actress made big impressions in Silk Stockings and Please Don't Eat the Daisies in the late 50s early 60s but her breakthrough stage role went to Doris Day on film (The Pajama Game). She later moved to TV soaps where she worked through the early 1990s...\n\n02 Jacqueline White (11/23/22)\n\nActress of the 1940s for MGM and RKO.
