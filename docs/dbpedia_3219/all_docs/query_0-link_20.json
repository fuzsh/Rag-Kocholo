        "text": "DISAPPOINTMENTS AT MANCHESTER\n\nScotland again won the International Championship, unbeaten, when they beat England at Manchester on Saturday by one goal to none. England, on the other hand, suffered the additional aggravation of having to accept the \" wooden spoon,\" the result of two defeats, one drawn match, and not a single victory.\n\nIn searching for reasons for the rather humiliating position occupied by England, in spite of all her apparent wealth of first-class League clubs, one noted two outstanding facts. One of these was painfully apparent at Glasgow last year, when the slightly slower but vastly more efficient conception of the dribbling game held by Scotsmen enabled their national side not only to score two goals to none, but to outplay their opponents in the process. On Saturday much the same thing happened, although the victory, as shown in goals, was the smallest possible. One might add, perhaps, that Scottish Association football also has its faults ; and over-elaboration and mere trickiness at times are two of them. Hence, to some extent, the lowness of the scoring, though one also must not forget the craft and skill--not always according to the rules--of the modern defence.\n\nThe second fact noted was the difference in the mental attitude of the general public, and, one is inclined to think, of the players as well. In Scotland, a crowd of 100,000 at the great match of the year is commonplace. And if one of the English strongholds, like Lancashire, has to be invaded, there are thousands ready to carry the necessary Scottish atmosphere, garments, and sounds into the enemy's camp. A stranger in Manchester on Saturday night might well have fancied himself in Glasgow. The long trek out to Old Trafford was covered by numerous small bands of be-tartaned individuals, complete with bagpipes and boundless optimism, in spite of the repeated drenching showers of rain and muddy roads. It was much the same in the hundreds of tramcar specials. Inside the ground of the Manchester United Club there was the same impression of Scottish enthusiasm and comparative indifference on the part of the English spectators. These, admittedly, were in a considerable majority ; but, allowing for the bad weather and the increased price of admission, it was significant that a ground that has held over 70,000 people at a Cup-tie had room for another 20,000 at least on Saturday. Nor must one forget the neutralizing of the home brass band by a smaller but much more shrill and insistent Scottish pipe band. In the battle of discords, the pipe band won every time. This was a detail, no doubt, but the obvious indifference on the part of the general public could hardly have failed to have its effect upon the players, and the writer, at any rate, does not hesitate to attribute some of the feebleness of the English attacks in the second half to the individual feeling that, after all, a national defeat would not matter so much as, say, the respective joys and horrors of promotion or relegation--blessed words both...\n\nIt was in the perfect positioning and backing up of their players that Scotland achieved victory. The winning goal came about in this way, after about half an hour's play. Gallacher this time slipped away towards the right, and a brilliantly clever piece of inter-passing with Jackson ended in Gallacher obtaining the ball for a second time, and in sending the ball across the goal-mouth to Jackson. The latter's shot was at close range, but the ball hit a goal-post before rebounding into the net. - The Times - Monday 19th April, 1926\n\nFootball League Division One\n\n17 April 1926 Team P Pts Huddersfield Town 41 57 Arsenal 39 49 Sunderland 40 46 Aston Villa 40 43 Bury 40 43 Liverpool 40 42 Bolton Wanderers 39 42 Sheffield United 39 41 Newcastle United 40 40 Blackburn Rovers 41 39 Tottenham Hotspur 40 39 West Bromwich Albion 40 38 Everton 40 38 Leicester City 41 38 Manchester United 37 38 Cardiff City 39 38 West Ham United 40 37 Birmingham 39 36 Leeds United 40 34 Manchester City 40 33 Burnley 39 32 Notts County 40 31\n\nDivision One matches played on 17 April 1926:\n\nARSENAL 3-1 HUDDERSFIELD TOWN\n\nHulme, Lawson, Parker pen.

Reading led the southern section by two points from Plymouth Argyle, who had played a game fewer, but\n\nit was to be a fifth successive runners-up placing for the Pilgrims, with Reading promoted as champions for the first time, following five seasons in the bottom half of the table.\n\nIN OTHER NEWS...\n\nIt was on 17 April 1926 that twenty-thousand women marched through London in protest against industrial strike actions and lockouts that were doomed to failure. The Trades Union Congress would organise a General Strike in support of the intended reduction of miners' wages and increased hours, in the following month. It would last for nine days, but it was, ultimately, unsuccessful."
