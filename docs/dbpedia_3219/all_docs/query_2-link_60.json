        "text": "There might have been hoopla and celebration on Feb. 7 as high school student-athletes made their college decisions official as part of National Signing Day.\n\nBut days, weeks and months of serious thought went into those choices, said former Canton football coach Tim Baechler — whose son, Lou, was one of five players from his 2017 team to take part in signing day.\n\n“I've tried to tell kids to base their decision on four things: Will the degree you get from this school be well respected everywhere? Will you have an opportunity to play and play early? Is the team going to win and win big while you are there? How bad do the coaches want you?” stated Tim Baechler, who retired in November after a 20-year hall-of-fame career with the Chiefs.\n\nLinebacker Lou Baechler signed with Hope College (NCAA Division III) after mulling over offers from several Division II schools.\n\n“He had two D-II offers, and an opportunity to be a preferred walk on at a few others,” Baechler continued. “Julie (Lou’s mom) and I are thrilled about his decision.\n\n“It is a great school (in Holland, Mich.) with a coaching staff that is going into their third year there, and I feel their program is about to take off.”\n\nAlso ready to start careers in college football are outside linebacker Noah Brown (Northwood University, D-II offer), running back/defensive back Colin Troup (Colgate University, D-1 AA offer) and offensive lineman Max Mulvaney, who will walk on at Indiana Wesleyan.\n\nMeanwhile, a fifth football player who was a key factor in Canton’s success, linebacker/running back Nick Polydoras, is going to Cleveland State to play men’s lacrosse.\n\n“I’m happy for all of them,” Baechler added.\n\nFollowing is a National Signing Day roundup highlighting the college choices of senior student-athletes from other area high schools:\n\nCanton Chiefs\n\n• In addition to the Canton football players, several seniors who play other sports also participated in the National Signing Day festivities on Feb. 7.\n\nThose included the following: Kathleen Brady (softball, Heidelberg University), Isabelle Dawson (softball, Aquinas College), Hailey Domzalski (rowing, Michigan State University), Sarah Hammond (soccer, Wesleyan University), Alaina Heitmeyer (basketball, Calvin College), Sabrina Lee (lacrosse, Concordia University), Emily Meredith (volleyball, East Stroudsburg University), Dan Mullen (swimming, Grand Valley State University) and Hannah Zajdel (softball, University of the Incarnate Word).\n\nPlymouth Wildcats\n\n• Joey Robb will play men’s basketball at Kalamazoo College.\n\n“I am very happy for Joey and his family,” Plymouth boys basketball coach Mike Soukup said. “He has worked really hard the past four years and it is great to see that work pay off with an opportunity to play at the collegiate level.\n\n“Obviously you have to be gifted academically to go to Kalamazoo College and Joey is a great fit for their program both as a student and as a player.”\n\n• Kyle Aniol is slated to continue his baseball career at Madonna University, where he also will study to go into the nursing program.\n\n“He is one of the hardest workers we have in the program,” Plymouth baseball coach Jason Crain said. “Extremely athletic and is one of the best defenders in our program in the infield or outfield.\n\n“He is aggressive on the base paths that puts tremendous pressure in the opposition. He is a team leader.”\n\nCrain added that Plymouth Baseball “couldn’t be more proud that he signed with Madonna. It is a perfect fit for him.”\n\nSalem Rocks\n\n• Alexandra Derubo signed to play Division I women’s soccer at Ball State University. Although the goalkeeper did not play for the Rocks during her high school years, she has been an instrumental piece of 2014 and 2017 national championship teams earned by the Michigan Hawks Academy team.\n\n“It was pretty close to home (just over 3 hrs) so I didn’t have to travel very far and I loved the coaches there and the atmosphere there is really cool.,” Derubo said. “I’ve been told to be prepared and fit, because the goalkeeper coach is going to be really tough.\n\n“And I’m ready for it, because I’m really excited to play. I can’t wait to get down there.”\n\nDerubo, who intends to study for a degree in business, said she will continue with the Hawks until June or July and then make the move to Ball State, where she will play in the Mid-American Conference.\n\n• Katie Coleman opted to sign with Central Michigan University, another D-I MAC program. The forward has one more season left with Salem before beginning the transition period.\n\n“I’ve always really liked playing soccer, and then I wanted to go to a school that had some options, because I’m not sure what I want to go into yet,” Coleman said. “And it was a really good fit for me with the team and coaching philosophies.”\n\nShe said she expects to have no trouble adjusting to college life because “they play formations that I like, they have a really good team culture. ... I like the ball at my feet, I can hit the ball pretty well.”\n\nGarden City Cougars\n\n• Cam Walter signed to play football in the NAIA with the Blue Devils of Lawrence Technological University.\n\nWalter is a three-sport standout with the Cougars (also playing basketball and baseball) and is expected to play tight end at LTU.\n\nDuring his prep career, he was valuable because of his versatility, playing wide receiver and quarterback.\n\n“They love him, with his size,” Garden City head coach Jim Baker said. “He has the ability to do some things.\n\n“He has great hands, athletic ability, he can get open and do some things in the open field.\n\n“He’s just a smart kid. He knows how to play the game.”\n\nContact Tim Smith: tsmith@hometownlife.com. Follow him on Twitter: @TimSmith_Sports."
