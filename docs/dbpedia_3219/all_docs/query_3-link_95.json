        "text": "By KEVIN ECKLEBERRY\n\nDaily News\n\nThe Troup Tigers will be put to the test.\n\nTroup, which begins its Region 5-AAAA schedule next week, will be in Cartersville the next three days for the Perfect Game High School Showdown.\n\nThe tournament, which features elite teams from across the Southeast, will be contested at the Lakepoint Complex.\n\nTroup will play four games, beginning with today’s game against Loganville at 8:30 p.m.\n\nTroup will play again at 3:30 p.m. on Friday, and its schedule after that will depend on what happens in the second game.\n\nThe Tigers must remain in the winner’s bracket to have a chance to win the championship, but they’ll play four games regardless.\n\nTwo years ago, Troup participated in another elite tournament, the IMG National Classic in Florida.\n\nAs competitive as that tournament was, Troup head coach Garner said the field for the Perfect Game event is considerably better.\n\n“All in all, this tournament is much stronger, and much deeper than the IMG tournament,” Garner said.\n\nTroup opens with Loganville, and it will play either North Gwinnett or Providence (Fla.) in the second round on Friday at 3:30 p.m.\n\n“Loganville has won back-to-back state championships,” Garner said. “North Gwinnett is ranked number one in Class AAAAAAA. Providence is the defending champion of this tournament. Parkview is ranked number two in the country, and you have Cartersville and Blessed Trinity.”\n\nTroup heads into the tournament rolling along nicely.\n\nAfter opening the season with five consecutive wins, Troup lost to Upson-Lee in a game where it had a 5-0 lead.\n\nTroup bounced back from that loss with wins over Central-Phenix City and Northside to improve to 7-1, and it will look to stay hot this week heading into next week’s Region 5-AAAA opener against Chapel Hill.\n\n“Obviously I’d like to see us hit a little better, but I like our group, and they’re playing hard,” Garner said. “We’re trying to feel them out, and try to see how everybody’s sliding into place, and what each individual can. It’s a process, and that’s what we’re working on.”\n\nFirst up for Troup in the Perfect Game tournament is Loganville, which is coming off a state-championship season.\n\nLoganville has another loaded roster this season that includes a pair of pitchers in Bay Witcher (Troy) and Joseph Brandon (Georgia State) who have already signed college scholarships.\n\nBrandon threw a no-hitter in the state-championship series last season.\n\nIn the second round, Troup will play either North Gwinnett or Providence (Fla.), and that promises to be another difficult test.\n\nNorth Gwinnett went 35-4 last season and reached the state semifinals.\n\nNorth Gwinnett has an experienced team that includes senior pitcher Walker Cleveland, who has signed with Georgia Southern.\n\nProvidence, which comes from Jacksonville, is looking to win the tournament for a second straight season, and it has a team capable of doing that.\n\nProvidence is led by Florida State signee Alex Sanchez, who hit two home runs in last year’s tournament.\n\nTroup brings a strong resume of its own into the tournament.Troup has won back-to-back region championships, and it will be a favorite to make it three in a row this spring.\n\nTroup is led by shortstop and pitcher Ryan Bliss, who has signed with Auburn.\n\nBliss has done a remarkable job from the leadoff position, and he has also been an effective pitcher.\n\nTroup has a pair of aces in Colby Williams and Garrett Casey, who have both been nearly unhittable this season."
