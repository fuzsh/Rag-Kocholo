        "text": "By Murray Gleffe\n\nCorrespondent\n\nName: Keely Troup\n\nSchool: Green Bay N.E.W. Lutheran\n\nSport: Girls’ soccer\n\nParents: Callista and David Troup\n\nKeely Troup recently finished her soccer career at Green Bay N.E.W. Lutheran.\n\nTroup said she’d like to spend a week in New Zealand.\n\nShe said she hopes to get accepted into the Rochester (Minnesota) nursing program, receive an internship at Mayo Clinic and play soccer.\n\nHow did you blend with incoming freshmen?\n\n“By working with them during practice, as well as off the field with their studies.”\n\nHow painful is it to get railed in the shins during a game?\n\n“It’s a pain that is indescribable.”\n\nWhat was your favorite snack for a game?\n\n“Fruit snacks – before and during.”\n\nWho was the funniest person on the team?\n\n“Emma Williams – she made the simplest things funny.”\n\nIf you could be somebody for a day, who would it be?\n\n“(Amazon’s) Jeff Bezos.”\n\nWhat’s one thing you want to do in your lifetime?\n\n“Jump out of a plane.”\n\nWould you rather fly in a helicopter over Yellowstone or the Pacific Northwest?\n\n“Yellowstone, without a doubt. I grew up going there during summer vacations with my family, and it’s one thing I’ve never done. “\n\nIf you could play for any college team, who would it be?\n\n“UCLA is my dream team.”\n\nWhat are your pet peeves?\n\n“When players pick up the ball and walk with it or people chewing gum with their mouth open.”\n\nIf you could start your own professional team, what would the team’s name and colors be?\n\n“The colors would be purple and white, and I’d name the team the Royals.”\n\nWalmart or Target?\n\n“Target.”\n\nBefore a game, did you prefer to get hyped up with the team or keep it calm and do your own thing?\n\n“I wanted to hype my team up, set goals for the game and remind them we were put into certain positions for a reason.”\n\nIn your opinion, what position is the most difficult?\n\n“Center, defensive-mid. The responsibility of this position is to see the field and know when to attack and fall back, but also set up plays for the striker to take and score.”\n\nTalk about your family.\n\n“My family is mostly from Wisconsin and Minnesota. Both sets of my grandparents are involved in my life. My older brother and younger sister have always been supportive. My parents are encouraging with everything I’ve done.”\n\nWould you rather own a brick or colorful house?\n\n“A colorful one because life is too short to care what people think.”\n\nWho’s your favorite soccer player?\n\n“Alex Morgan – she’s an amazing player and a great role model.”\n\nHow do you define success?\n\n“Doing your best and going above the expectations set for you.”"
