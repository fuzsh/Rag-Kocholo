        "text": "Methodology: Second tier\n\nIntroducing an exciting new feature! This is something I've been dabbling in for a while. When going through the newer eras, I decided to experiment with what it would look like if I made a list of the next 16 best players for each position. Like with the best 16, it seemed to me there was a second group of players who could be picked out from the average masses. This set of players would be ones who are considered good enough to represent one of the top NTs for a prolonged period, but would not be considered one of the absolute best players in the world. This also includes players from big clubs who are not necessarily starters, but are important squad players nonetheless. This tier also includes many of the shooting star types who shine for a short while, but don't maybe have the longevity for true greatness.\n\nI skimmed through the World Soccer issues again while doing revisions, and discovered it is possible to manufacture a second tier of players based on the information they provided. Basically if a player was mentioned regularly in the magazine, I figured it meant they made the cut for this tier. Pre-Bosman this includes players who (again) managed to be capped for a major NT on a fairly regular basis, as well as key players for smaller nations who hadn't made the cut for the top list.\n\nI've also been thinking about the terms I've been using. World Class is probably too generous a term for everyone who have made the main list. The term is probably best reserved for the players who make the Ballon D'or shortlists. Something like upper international class would be a more appropriate term for the first tier list. The second tier would be then be lower international class. In Kicker terms the top tier would be the regular international class and world class players. Second tier would be the broad circle/occasional international class players.\n\nNow, since these are players with a much lower profile, my second tier list is going to be more informal. I didn't want to get stuck micromanaging every player's career season by season. The aim was to score another 16 for every position, but in some eras that just didn't seem to come off naturally, so I didn't force it. The numbers will vary some era by era.\n\nI'll be starting off by publishing the second tier concurrently with the top tier on the eras I'm working on now. After I'm done with the pre-60s eras, I'll move on chronologically from there.\n\nFor the older eras I'm working on now, this list will be even more informal due to the scarcity of material. A lot of the players here were only capped a couple of times, so I may have thrown some names in based on a couple of match reports alone. These early lists are more like a shortlist of every player who made it into my radar. Since there will be room for later additions, suggestions are always welcome.\n\nYes I understand the logic of what if + anticipation but it's already difficult to predict what will happen in the next 6 months for all these players. Most of them are injury-prone, Hernandez too (Tolisso too) or did not reached the next step at a mental level for now (Rabiot, Kurzawa, it's the least we can say about them). About Hernandez, he played quite a lot for an 18-20 years old defender in a club such as Atl√©tico (coming in from the bench in an UCL Final at 20 years old was a mark of confidence in his potential too, from Simeone).\n\nHopefully, there'll be couple of newcomers quite rapidly for the nt since it's much interrogation points and no concurrency for Pavard on the right. For now there's only Ferland Mendy on the left (which for now looks like a little miracle btw with this serie of injuries at this position wich is the one with less depth in French football for the international level). Maybe Dagba on the right?\n\nIf Sidib√© and Mendy had been fit to play, dunno if the French team are World champions too. If Pavard or Hernandez had been injured during the competition, their replacements were not even fit to play btw (Sidib√© was not reassuring against Denmark while Mendy entered for the last 40-45 mins and was even less reassuring, was about to have something breaking in his body again).\n\nHernandez has just made his come back in club last week, at CB. Still at Bayern, Pavard plays on the right again after having been lined up in the centre during a while (his first position). It seems he should have more concurrency at Bayern soon or later.\n\nAs for Kurzawa, he's a free agent and has contacts with Chelsea, Liverpool and most of all Barcelona it seems. Offensively, he's good, but defensively, lately, it ws not brilliant. He did not imposed himself at PSG so elsewhere, it remains to be seen (it remains to be seen where he will be signed too).\n\nDigne rebounded well at Everton (Everton player of the year the first year) after PSG (where he had not all the confidence needed and was replaced by Kurzawa who's been a liabilty defensively... partying too much? Digne also did very well in nt when Hernandez was injured, against \"small nt's\", but that was qualifiers still). Some were skeptical about Bernat in the beginning but he is way better than both.\n\n1930-1935:\n\nI wanted to give a more detailed review this time to explain my thinking, and to offer some comments on some of the borderline players. I'll make a few general notes, and then go through things nation by nation.\n\nThe competition for spots was heaviest in the defensive positions, goalie, fullbacks and centre-half, though that's partly because CH has some of the more forward-types included. CH is an interesting mismatch in general. I don't think anyone would say Jack Barker and Gy√∂rgy Sarosi play the same position. Other areas are good, except for right-wing which is the problem area. If anyone can spot a usable RW in the other positions, LMK.\n\nThe main thing I want to discuss is the question of team strength, and what I like to call the Ireland paradox. Basically, the Republic has a pretty competitive team in this era, and the likes of Holland and Belgium seem to consider the Irish to be superior, or at least on par to their teams. However, when looking at the Irish in more detail, there aren't any exceptional players to be found. Some of their best players are just bench-warmers at English or Scottish clubs. The player with the highest reputation, Paddy Moore, was too wayward a character to really succeed in Scotland.\n\nIf Ireland are earning a good rep with their leftover players, it would seem to indicate British football is still well ahead of the continent in terms of quality. But then we run into the other side of the paradox, which is the English NT facing off against teams on the continent with players who are dismissed as not being top-quality. So which way is it? In my view, there's a good chance the Brits still have a large chunk of the top players in this era, they just don't have the method to mold an impressive unit out of them half the time. At any rate, I'm continuing my methodology with the belief that England are just one of the strongest nations with a deep pool, but not head and shoulders ahead of the pack.\n\nGetting into the players, England has a surprisingly small representation here in terms of attacking talent, partly due to rotation, and partly due to a couple of players dominating their position. The next couple of names in line are the likes of Waring and Tilson, who didn't particularly shine at international level.\n\nScotland now joins Wales and Ireland in the group that's the toughest to figure out, this being due to their messed up selection policies and the difficulty or refusal of picking Anglo-Scots. I picked the obvious James and Gallacher, but have no idea if there were some Scottish gems hidden in English football who were victims of selection policy. There's no one with a reputation that survives to modern days, at least, so I think I'm good. Jimmy Gibson was a third player whose absence was being lamented in the papers, but this was around 1930, so I'm not sure if his reputation stayed as high throughout this era. In terms of defenders I picked what seemed like the two top guys, but even they were described as more solid than spectacular.\n\nWales and Ireland are as much a mystery as ever. Several players will impress now and then, but it's hard to figure out if they only impress at a Welsh level, or if they would legitimately be considered as one of the very best players in the country. I kept the number of Irish and Welsh players down to the bare minimum: Arsenal's John, the highly-rated surprise find Tom Griffiths, and the high-scoring Jimmy Dunne. Neither Dunne or Bambrick particularly shone at NT-level, they just scored goals, but Dunne makes it in due to his good domestic record. Bambrick was more uneven in his Chelsea run, so he's out.\n\nHeading into the continent now, Italy seems to have good depth in all positions. Hard to say if some of the players whose path is blocked by the Meazzas and Ferraris would have been considered absolute top class, but my earlier World Soccer-based research has taught me to go primarily by NT-representation. So the likes of Sallustro, Sansone and Fedullo will have to settle for being second tier.\n\nSpain and the Central European powers are of the level where the majority of the most-used 11 deserve a spot here. Some of them are rotating players in certain positions, giving a larger pool of players enough games to earn a solid rep. Austria as the most dominant team earn a few spots more than their competitors.\n\nGermany starts to improve steadily around 33-34, which makes things awkward for my three-year rule. I included the high-profile duo of Conen and Lehner, but the likes of Janes and Goldbrunner will have to wait for the next era. Switzerland had a world-class defensive trio, as well as two world-class Abegglen brothers. Xam experienced an Indian summer after a more uneven late 20s, and Trello was a lot more high-profile than I realized. France are at the bottom of the European barrel, with even the likes of Mattler and Delfour struggling to get in. Their best players are imports like Bek and Duhart.\n\nOf the other amateur nations, Holland are the ones who seem to enjoy the best rep. Defence is generally their strong area, and their attacking play starts improving by leaps and bounds when the likes of Bakhuys and Kick Smit get there. Bakhuys falls awkwardly into the mid-30s range, but this is the better era for his inclusion. Law Adam was another top player for them, but his NT-career was cut short due to injuries. When I left them off around 1935, Holland were credited as being the top amateur nation, and their results are quite good around this time. When looking at both early and late-30s, it seems likely most of the first 11 will be included. Belgium's results are a lot weaker, so I've kept their number to a minimum. Voorhoof and Hellemans were the top players.Capelle and Van Den Eynde I'm less sure about.\n\nStandards in Scandinavia are down from the 20s. So low, ion fact, Norway was their top team for a moment, and Denmark were struggling even against little Finland. It's hard to pinpoint the actual level because they're so isolated, but I kept their number to a minimum, too. Juve and Pauli Jorgensen are obvious choices. The Swedish players from this era are completely memory-holed, but Rydberg was top-class, and Kroon their best player. There were several others who were close to making it, but I played it safe and kept them at second tier. The Danish and Norwegian goalies I'm a bit iffy on. Danish winger Ernst Nilsson is someone who I forgot to include last time. He belongs in the late 20s.\n\nEastern Europe is where things get interesting. Yugoslavia is another one of the biggest mysteries to me. They have several players who are considered ATG for the country, but honestly Arsenijevic, Tirnanic and Marjanovic never impressed me much when I was reading. Especially against the bigger teams they're often nowhere to be found. Their best seemed to be Lehner, as well as Sekulic and Bek, which makes sense because the last two were scooped up by foreign clubs. Is there a reason why they didn't go for the first three, hmm? Tirnanic and Marjanovic are both useful as right-wingers, though, so I included them, but doubts remain. Ivkovic no longer holds a regular spot, so he's gone.\n\nBoth Yugoslavia and Romania are challenging, because their results seem much poorer than the number of class players would seem to suggest. You'd think with so many top players they could get more things done? The great part about Romania is that we actually have a point of comparison due to their dual internationals. Avar, Bodola and Baratky were all good enough to hold a regular spot for Hungary, too, so this proves even the weaker EE-nations had players who could hang at the top level. Dobay's claim seemed pretty undisputed. Kovacs will go on to not be great in France (seems like), but was good enough to earn a Hungary cap. Albu goes to the not quite sure territory, while Vogl gets the Ivkovic treatment.\n\nPoland starts to emerge internationally to a degree, and they fight pretty evenly with the Scandinavians. They seem to be lacking in the top-player department, though. They have several players who impress at times, but rather than include so many forgotten players, it was safer to not include them. That means they're well-represented at second tier, though. Martyna was the only one who made the cut. I've never seen him mentioned among Poland's ATGs, but the reviews were very favorable. Bulgaria are decribed as highly primitive, except for a couple standouts. Their top players Asen Penchev and Asen Pashev (yes) actually made it all the way to the Czech league, but didn't convince, so this is where I draw the line.\n\nSouth America is another tough area to figure out in this era. They barely play any internationals, and the ones they do play have heavy rotation. This fact combined with lack of research material makes it hard to figure out when a player has emerged or passed his peak. This is why I went with a skeleton crew of Americans for this era, and did heavy cuts in the most competitive positions of Goalie and centre-half.\n\nBrazil deserves a special mention, because as I mentioned in the BdO thread, they seem to enjoy a high reputation yet at the same time lack the individual player reputation. Leonidas just has the required 3 seasons, I think. Based on what I read, Waldemar de Brito should probably be included, but his almost complete lack of caps throughout his career works heavily against him."
