        "text": "Baker Park is Darien's hidden gem. Located off Noroton Avenue, many families with young children frequent the 11.7 acre park to utilize the playscape and play areas nestled in the corner of the park. During the day, the park offers the town, a \"neighborhood park\" atmosphere, where parents and children can play and relax together. In the afternoon and evening, the park is utilized by Darien Little League and Darien Soccer Association on the multipurpose softball/soccer field. At the south end of the playfield, a walking trail enters the wooded area and wraps around the park courtesy of Eagle Scout Alex Von Stuelpnagel in 2011. Eagle Scout Daniel Stewart coordinated an improvement project in 2013 to honor his father, Rick Stewart, and installed split rail fencing, planted boxwoods, and installed a tree and benches overlooking the field."
