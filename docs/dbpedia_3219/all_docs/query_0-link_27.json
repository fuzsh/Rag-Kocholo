        "text": "Just devastating news.......don't have words at the moment and really don't know what to write.\n\nI've went to some lengths in many previous posts about how much respect I have for the folk who find their way to Celtic through the less traditional channels. It's a tough road for many of these lads and lasses, as they often have to defy their own upbringing and conventions and run the gauntlet with friends and family.\n\nI can't speak for David, but I'm fairly sure he may have mentioned previously that his path to Celtic was one of those paths less followed and was borne purely out of the awe and magic which eminates from those magnificent Hoops. As someone from the North-East of Scotland, I can't imagine that David was subject to the same level of vilification that may appear in other parts of the country, but his love for Celtic would still leave question marks and bewilderment among many and it would have taken much courage and conviction to declare his love for the club.\n\nI'm sure Bridie will agree that Forfar is a modest wee town up here in the North-East and that that modesty is reflected in the fine people that that wee town has bestowed upon us. David was one of those fine people and it is an incredibly sad loss to the wider Celtic community, but not nearly measurable compared to the magnitude of the loss for his family.\n\nI don't know if religion is a theme within the Potter household, but I do hope they know that David will feature prominently in many of our prayers for the foreseeable future and I can only hope they can take some strength from the love that we feel for a man who gave so much to Celtic and to those who follow Celtic.\n\nHow I would have cherished the opportunity to sip from the fountain of his knowledge regarding the mighty Bhoys in Barrel Hoops, but at least I can have his storied words to feast upon yet.\n\nDavid Potter.......Celtic historian and legend RIP\n\nI am really saddened by this news. Unfortunately I never got a chance to meet the man and thank him for educating me by sharing his extensive knowledge. I first took notice of him when I read his books on Willie Maley and Wee Troupie (Alex/Eck Troup - probably Forfar's greatest ever player who I was unaware of even though he was related to a school pal). Since then I've managed to accrue a number of his footballing history books. I loved his writing style where it felt like he was sitting next you telling a compelling story. I think it is fair to say he was a nerd like myself who loved facts and recounting history.\n\nI always thought of him as a Celtic/Forfar equivalent of the late Bob Crampsey, who coincidently was the headmaster at Forfar Academy when my Mum & Dad were there, so David will probably have known him well.\n\nYou are right - growing up in Forfar meant there were absolutely no religious prejudices back in the day. My own Grandad was a practising protestant and fairly high up in the masons (but very against bigotry and he would have hated the Orange Order with a passion, even though he was a very coothie man) but a supporter of the Celtic. For us it was all strictly about joy of the football with none of the baggage. Sadly I think this may have changed these days as I've seen FTP graffiti (hopefully it is just a very small number of idiots).\n\nNot only am I sending my best wishes to Rosemary and his family, but also the team at the Celtic Star. They have lost a mentor, a colleague but most of all a very good friend.\n\nRest in peace, David. Hail Hail!\n\nJust devastating news.......don't have words at the moment and really don't know what to write.\n\nI've went to some lengths in many previous posts about how much respect I have for the folk who find their way to Celtic through the less traditional channels.
