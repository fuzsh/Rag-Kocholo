        "text": "247Sports was on hand for the first scrimmage day of the 2018 season in the Peach State Thursday, where a trio of SEC West football commitments took the field as LaGrange (Ga.) Troup County hosted Columbus (Ga.) Northside.\n\nThe three known commodities each held his own in the 36-2 Troup County win, but a productive three-star and two emergers caught our attention as well. Below are thoughts coming out of the event in which the starters played for the first half.\n\nClass of 2019\n\n4-star Outside Linebacker/Defensive End King Mwikuta - Troup County\n\nVitals: 6-foot-4, 235 lbs\n\nNotes: After playing mostly with his hand in the dirt at defensive end in 2017, Mwikuta is back to a stand-up, outside linebacker role within the Tigers' defense. After the event he told 247Sports he is most comfortable coming off the edge from the traditional defensive end spot, in a three-point stance, but needed to become more comfortable in space both for the 2018 season and for his prospects at the next level. Mwikuta affected the passer on routine through the brief action with a good first step and solid hands against blockers. He seemed to adjust to motions and audibles while out in space early on. No player on the Troup County roster got his team going like Mwikuta, a captain, did Thursday.\n\nRecruitment: Committed to Alabama\n\n3-star Wide Receiver Jamari Thrash - Troup County\n\nVitals: 6-foot, 180 lbs\n\nNotes: After a 1,400-yard junior season the steady target picked up right where he left off in collecting near 200 yards on just three catches Thursday. Thrash isn't a flashy or speedy talent, but he can get behind a defensive back with efficient routes and quickness with consistent hands to boot. On his first touch of the night, he broke several tackles after the catch as well. The three-star can affect the defense at all three levels of the passing game.\n\nRecruitment: Holds more than a dozen offers, Georgia State among those on his mind as Power 5 programs track senior season\n\nRunning Back Fredrick Davis, Jr. - Northside\n\nVitals: 5-foot-10, 192 lbs\n\nNotes: A well put-together two-way standout, Davis can make plays in between the tackles or in space with good vision, balance and better-than-expected speed in the open field. His build enables him to finish runs with power and he wastes little time dancing in the open field. The decisive runner holds his own in the passing game, too.\n\nRecruitment: Undeclared with offers from Navy and several FCS and Ivy League programs\n\nClass of 2020\n\n4-star Defensive Lineman Andy Boykin - Troup County\n\nVitals: 6-foot-3, 257 lbs\n\nNotes: Lining up on the defensive interior and on the edge at times, Boykin may have been the most impressive prospect Thursday based solely on what we saw. Even before the contest began, he looked more impressive on the hoof than at last glance, carrying some 260 pounds very well, with a frame to add even more weight if deemed necessary over the next few years. The junior is explosive off of the football with great quickness that was too much for Northside linemen to handle inside or out. He finished plays with power, too, displaying a consistent motor in the process.\n\nRecruitment: Committed to Auburn\n\n4-star Wide Receiver/Athlete Kobe Hudson - Troup County\n\nVitals: 6-foot-1, 186 lbs\n\nNotes: More likely to play wide receiver at the next level, he has taken the reigns as the Tigers' quarterback this year and will be a true dual-threat option over the next two seasons. On Thursday, though, it was about his throwing ability because of the controlled environment (THS QBs were not live) and he put some impressive throws on the table, especially down the field. Hudson has plenty of arm strength, we even saw him throw from the 50-yard line to the corner pylon a few times in warmups, and he has some accuracy deep as well. He will make improvements on the touch game and playing consistently underneath, but once he is unleashed during the season there should be high point totals and statlines by his name.\n\nRecruitment: Committed to Auburn\n\nDefensive Lineman Sheldon Brown - Northside\n\nVitals: 6-foot-4, 260 lbs\n\nNotes: Brown looks the part, with good length and minimal bad weight with two full prep seasons ahead of him, but his best football is clearly down the road. He made plays using his athleticism up front, particularly when redirecting and flowing towards the football, but he will need to improve on the little things, like pad level, leverage and consistency, before major college programs take a closer look at him as a scholarship prospect.\n\nRecruitment: Has yet to pick up initial scholarship offer"
