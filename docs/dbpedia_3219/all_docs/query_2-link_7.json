        "text": "LAGRANGE, GA (WTVM) - A LaGrange native who plays for the Tennessee Titans has announced that he will be bringing a free flag football youth summer league to the Chattahoochee Valley.\n\nWesley Woodyard, also the co-founder of 16Ways Foundation, says the league will focus on basic football skills to foster and encourage youth to succeed in other areas of their lives such as goal setting, elements of leadership, searching out and seizing positive opportunities, and developing self-worth.\n\nThe program, open to up to 80 participants aged six to twelve, includes six-weeks of practice and play, six non-contact games, and a coaching staff of 16. Additionally, a closing fun-filled Family Day will coincide with championship weekend that will highlight athletic and personal skills attained.\n\nThe NFL linebacker spoke with News Leader 9 about the importance of athleticism plays in young lives.\n\n\"My mother introduced me to football,\" said Woodyard. \"I was one of those kids who was always talking too much and getting into trouble. Football taught me a lot about self-discipline.\"\n\nThe season begins July 16th and end August 18th.\n\nThe program will take place at the George F. Harris Baseball Complex in LaGrange.\n\nParents interested in signing their child up can do so by clicking here or by coming to the Mike Daniel Recreation Center in LaGrange."
