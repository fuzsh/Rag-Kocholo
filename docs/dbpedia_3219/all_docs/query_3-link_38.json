Those are the guys you really respect because we talk here as a program about loving football, and you've got to love football when that's your role. To come out and work hard in practice and give a look on a scout team and know you're probably not getting into the game on Saturday, and then be back out there doing it again on Monday – Sarge did that for four years. Players like him are always your character guys and the guys who go on and are extremely successful in whatever they do because they have that right attitude. I'm going to miss Sarge and I know he's going to be successful.\"\n\n2019 (Junior)\n\nSquad member.\n\n2018 (Sophomore)\n\nGames/Starts: 1/0\n\nPosition: OL\n\nBest Games: Made collegiate debut in Colgate's 38-0 victory over Georgetown.\n\n2017 (First Year)\n\nSquad member.\n\nBefore Colgate\n\nRed Bank Catholic ...
