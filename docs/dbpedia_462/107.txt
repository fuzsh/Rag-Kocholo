Another day, another remake!

A remake of the definitive buddy cop film, 48 Hrs., is getting a remake now. It will be directed by Good Time directors, Benny and Josh Safdie, with the latter co-writing the script with Ronald Bronstein and Jerrod Carmichael.

The first film, which was highly successful upon release in 1982, starred Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte as a convict and cop who have 48 hours to team up to catch two people who killed a cop.

It was the first in the “buddy cop” genre, which went on to include films like Beverly Hills Cop, Lethal Weapon and Rush Hour.

The movie was also the first film role for Murphy and his first major role outside of Saturday Night Live.
