        "text": "AKA Edward Regan Murphy\n\nBorn: 3-Apr-1961\n\nBirthplace: Brooklyn, NY\n\nGender: Male\n\nRace or Ethnicity: Black\n\nSexual orientation: Matter of Dispute\n\nOccupation: Comic, Actor\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: Beverly Hills Cop\n\nEddie Murphy is a popular comedian, movie star, and part-time singer who started life in the housing projects of Brooklyn. His parents divorced when Murphy was a toddler, and his father, a policeman, was killed by an angry girlfriend when Murphy was 8. Murphy and his older brother, Charles, were placed in foster care when their mother was hospitalized for a long period of time. By high school, Murphy was the class clown, and by age 17 he was performing comedy in clubs where a kid his age wouldn't otherwise have been allowed in. The smaller venues paid $25-$50 a night, and he soon worked his way to larger clubs, including New York's Comic Strip.\n\nAt 19, he was hired as a minor player on Saturday Night Live. He was quickly promoted to full-fledged cast member. On SNL, Murphy's running gags included \"Little Richard Simmons\", \"Velvet Jones\", \"Buckwheat\", \"Gumby\", \"Raheem Abdul Muhammad\" (the militant black movie critic), and \"Mr. Robinson\", a blaxploitated homage to Mr. Rogers. In 1982, Murphy issued his debut comedy album, a self-titled effort that was criticized by the humor-deprived for making fun of Asians, women, and especially gays. The same year he made his big screen debut in 48 Hours, stealing the film from big star Nick Nolte.\n\nThen came Trading Places, Beverly Hills Cop (in a part originally written for Sylvester Stallone), and Coming to America. He reportedly turned down the Ghostbusters part that went to Ernie Hudson. In recent years, Murphy has reinvented himself in family-friendly fluff comedies like Doctor Dolittle, Daddy Day Care, and Shrek, and he was Oscar-nominated for his supporting role in 2006's Dreamgirls.\n\nIn 1985, Murphy released How Could It Be, a album of pop music including the million-selling single \"Party All the Time.\" His other musical albums include So Happy (1989) and Love's Alright (1993).\n\nMurphy has been harshly criticized by Spike Lee for not using his show business clout to help black actors break into film. Murphy did, however, pay for the funeral of Redd Foxx, one of his comedic inspirations, when he died destitute.\n\nIn the early hours of 2 May 1997, Murphy was driving his wife's SUV down Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood. Murphy pulled over, and a transvestite hooker named Atisone Kenneth Seiuli (or \"Shalomar\") got in. They drove off together, but didn't get far before Murphy was pulled over by a Los Angeles Sheriff's Department squad car. The cops spent half an hour talking amiably with Murphy, warning him about the neighborhood and perhaps getting his autograph before shaking his hand and letting him go. Seiuli, though, was arrested on an outstanding warrant for violating probation on an earlier prostitution charge.\n\nAs quick as Seiuli could post bail, the story was in the tabloids. According to Seiuli, in their brief conversation in the vehicle, Murphy had put two hundred-dollar bills on her leg, and \"asked me if I did this for a living, being a transsexual prostitute. I said yes. Eddie said, 'Do you like to wear lingerie?' I said yes. He said, 'Can I see you in lingerie?' I told him, 'Whenever I have the time.' He said, 'I'll make the time.' \"Then he asked me, 'What type of sex do you like?' I said I was into everything.\" Or at least, that was Seiuli's story.\n\nMurphy's version was, not surprisingly, not the same. \"I'm married with three children. I'm not going to be out there screwing hookers off the street or anything like that. I'm just being a nice guy... I was being a good Samaritan. It's not the first hooker I've helped out. I've seen hookers on corners... and I'll pull over... and they'll go, Oh you're Eddie Murphy, oh my God, and I'll empty my wallet out to help\". The next weekend, Saturday Night Live aired a sketch titled, \"Good Samaritan Eddie Murphy,\" with Tim Meadows as Murphy, ferrying transsexuals throughout metropolitan Los Angeles, out of the goodness of his heart.\n\nOne by one, a parade of local transvestite escorts chatted with The Globe, The National Enquirer, and more mainstream publications such as Gay & Lesbian Times, telling about their assorted encounters with Murphy. Several subsequently recanted their stories, and were reportedly well paid to do so by a man connected with Murphy's lawyer. Murphy sued the tabloids, but later quietly settled.\n\nCandace Watkins, a purported mother figure to several of the transsexuals involved, later wrote In the Closet with Eddie Murphy under the pen name Carnal Candy. The book was filled with tales from Watkin's girlfriends about their alleged liaisons with Murphy.\n\nOn 22 April 1998, Seiuli, wearing only a black bra padded a leather bikini thong (both from Frederick's of Hollywood) was found dead under her fifth-floor apartment window. She had apparently locked herself out of her apartment, tried sneaking in through an open window, and fallen to her death. There is no reasonable insinuation that Murphy was involved in Seiuli's death.\n\nFather: Charles Q.
