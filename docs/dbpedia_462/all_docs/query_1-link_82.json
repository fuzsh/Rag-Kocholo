        "text": "In the world of cinema, there have been few statements as polarizing as the one made by legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese: \"Marvel movies are films, but they aren't cinema.\" This provocative assertion, followed by Quentin Tarantino's equally compelling observation that \"Hollywood has been Marvel-ized,\" has ignited passionate debates within the film industry and among moviegoers. It raises profound questions about the state of contemporary cinema and what it means to be a true cinematic experience. Read this article by Samah Noor Nausheen on the Imperium Publication website to learn more.\n\nStallone's story is truly a testament to the power of self-belief and determination. It's incredibly inspiring to see someone have the courage to turn down substantial offers, betting everything on their own vision and talent. It's a reminder that although the safer path might be tempting, sometimes you have to hold out for what you truly want. Sure, nine out of ten times, it might not work out, but when it does, the reward is not just success, but success achieved on your own terms, which is infinitely more satisfying. Stallone's 'Rocky' is the perfect example of that one massive payoff that makes all the risks worthwhile. #Inspiration #SelfBelief #Determination #Rocky #Stallone #BetOnYourself #SuccessStory #FollowYourPath #AgainstAllOdds #DreamBig\n\nThere is a new wrinkle to the Scream story. Just a day after Melissa Barrera was let go from the stabby franchise over what were considered controversial social media posts, word arrives that her co-star (and possibly the biggest draw of the movies currently) Jenna Ortega also won't be returning. Her absence, however, is being put down to scheduling reasons. According to a story in Deadline, it all has to do with how busy Ortega's work calendar has become because of the actors' strike. The report mentions discussions about Ortega having to skip the movie being held even before the strike kicked in. Not only does she have to finish shooting the last few days on Beetlejuice 2, but she'll be spending a chunk of next year in Ireland filming the second season of Wednesday. Why wouldn't the Scream franchise simply look to make the time-juggling work (or wait for her to be available)? It appears production company Spyglass and studio Paramount are looking to keep the Ghostface train rolling. The timing remains a little suspicious given the Barrera news, but either way, it means big issues creatively for the films going forward –– it'll likely mean another reboot or potentially a pivot back to the legacy characters (though they are becoming increasingly few between on-screen fatality and off-screen contractual issues). #Celebrities #JennaOrtega #ScreamMovie #MelissaBarrera #Wednesday #Movies #TheSocialTalk\n\nOh hey look, the top three films of 2023, which drove the movie industry to its highest performing box office take in 4 years, none of them were sequels, reboots or franchise/shared universe pictures. Do you honestly believe a film like Barbie, Oppenheimer or Super Mario Bros. would have been written by an LLM? Or that you could have produced their striking visuals with a diffusion model? There's a lesson here for us, if we're willing to pay attention. #Movies #BoxOffice #GenerativeAI https://lnkd.in/gWdmPXWi"
