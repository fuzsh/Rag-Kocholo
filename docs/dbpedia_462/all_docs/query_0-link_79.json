        "text": "The cop and the convict, that's the relationship explored in Walter Hill's 48 Hrs.\n\nNick Nolte mumbles. Eddie Murphy laughs with hysteria. They make one the most enjoyable \"buddy cop\" pairs in cinematic history. Nolte might use some colorful language, but he's only playing the part of the tough cop. I believe his character has a good heart, and I adore how Nolte & Murphy's relationship develops throughout the film. In the end, you can't help but smile.\n\nJames Remar and Sonny Landham are so good at being bad. I wanted more scenes with the baddies. As much as I praise Mr Landham for his role as Billy Sole in Predator, I believe his turn as Billy Bear is the highlight…\n\nThe original 80s buddy cop film; Walter Hill’s “48 Hrs” started the genre off with equal portions of comedy and rage.\n\nBefore Eddie Murphy landed in a mire of derivative projects that appropriated his blackness for humor more than for social commentary — there was “48 Hrs.”\n\nDirector Walter Hill doesn’t go for the cheap race gag that instead turns racist. Murphy commands the film by wielding words - and the occasional action - like a hammer against all small-minded bigots. It’s not a question of whether he will get one over on all the guys. He has always been flying in the air — ten feet above their heads.\n\n“48 Hrs” casts Murphy as a convict on loan to…\n\nAction! - The Unlikely Rumble: Hill v Hyams\n\nSo, like I said at the beginning, prepare for some offsets in this fight. Although Hill still has the lead, Hyams is no longer playing games and is gaining ground.\n\nAnd, while I understand why many people enjoy it and see it as a genre classic, there's something about it that prevents me from connecting in the same way that others do. The now-famous bar scene is enjoyable, but I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.\n\nHaving said that, I liked it more this time, especially the interplay between our two protagonists and the action. Walter Hill has definitely learnt a thing or two from his early work, and much…\n\nDirector Walter Hill is primarily know for three things: 1) action 2) an active camera and 3) testosterone. No film of his plays up all three and balances them quite like 48hrs. Add to that the comic powerhouse that is Eddie Murphy's film debut with an equal foil that is Nick Nolte's lone wolf cop and you get a high-octane and energetic neo-buddy-cop film that delivers from the amazing Hill-centric cast to James Horner's fantastic score.\n\nThe Roger Spottiswoode/Walter Hill story of a cop that has 48 hours to use a convict to solve a prison escape hits the ground running.\n\nHill's film starts it's action thrust from minute one. Scenes are kinetic, the narrative moves and we get just…\n\nWalter Hill once again teams up with uber-producers Joel Silver and Lawrence Gordon for one of the biggest commercial hits of his career and inadvertently invents what we now know as the decade plus box office dominating genre of macho 80s \"buddy cop\" film. Originally conceived as a 70s-style San Francisco neo-noir for Eastwood (with a possible pairing of he and Richard Pryor), this eventually landed in the hands Nick Nolte as the rough blond-haired Dirty Harry style cop Jack Cates and then 20-year-old SNL star Eddie Murphy who makes his astonishingly charismatic big screen debut as the smart-ass, fast-talking, sexually frustrated career criminal Reggie Hammond who Cates paroles and partners up with for a \"long fucking night\" of driving…\n\nSo I've heard so much about this movie and apparently I've been mistaking this movie with another Eddie Murphy (where the film kicks off with him playing bad ass, trying to stop a bank robbery or something).\n\nIn the grand scheme of buddy cop films, this one was alright. Maybe because I grew up watching family-friendly Murphy, this early R rated movies tend to be very hit and miss for me. That's not to say he wasn't incredible, cause the man was brilliant back then like the Confederate Bar sequence, but he felt a bit restrained in here. Nolte was very good, though he also is capable of doing much better. The action was very uneven, though there are some…"
