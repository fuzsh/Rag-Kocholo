        "text": "Coming 2 America trailer\n\nDecember 22nd, 2020\n\nComedy starring Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall comes to Amazon Prime on March 5 ... Full Movie Details.\n\nFrom the lush and royal country of Zamunda, newly-crowned King Akeem and his trusted confidante Semmi embark on an all-new adventure that has them traversing the globe from their great African nation to the borough of Queens, New York—where it all began. More...\n\n2020 Awards Season: Golden Globes Nominations\n\nDecember 11th, 2019\n\nThe Golden Globes nominations are the second major Awards Season set to come out. It is still very early in the year and the predictive value of the Golden Globes is a little suspect, but there are still some things to learn here. (This is especially true on the TV end, as there’s talk about how strange the nominations are this year.) Marriage Story led the way with six nominations, just ahead of The Irishman and Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, both of which picked up five nods. More...\n\nHome Market Releases for June 12th, 2018\n\nJune 12th, 2018\n\nThere are not many big releases on this week’s list. Tomb Raider, Sherlock Gnomes, The Strangers: Prey at Night, and Love, Simon were, at best, midlevel hits domestically. Worse still, only the last one earned good reviews. Fortunately, the film is good enough that the DVD, Blu-ray Combo Pack, or 4K Ultra HD Combo Pack is worthy as Pick of the Week. More...\n\nHome Market Releases for October 25th, 2016\n\nOctober 24th, 2016\n\nIt’s not a great week on the home market, as the biggest release of the week is the low-budget horror film, Lights Out. It is worth picking up on Blu-ray, but it is not worth the Pick of the Week title. The best film on this week’s list is Finding Dory, but it is only coming out on Video on Demand and it is worth waiting for the Blu-ray. That said, there’s no top-notch competition, so it is the Pick of the Week. More...\n\nTheater Averages: Yerevan Highlight of Dark Weekend with an Average of $9,748\n\nSeptember 21st, 2016\n\nNo films made it into the $10,000 club this past weekend, but 3 Weeks in Yerevan came really close with an average of $9,748 in three theaters. Another film, The Beatles: Eight Days a Week, did well with an average of $7,322 in 85 theaters. Sort of. In addition to playing in 85 theaters, there were another 80 theaters that had one-time showings over the weekend, which is why its total haul for the weekend is $771,153. I really hope having a mixed of regular showings and one-time screenings doesn’t catch on, because it makes our job of tracking box office numbers more confusing. More...\n\nWeekend Estimates: Sully Beats Trio of New Releases\n\nSeptember 18th, 2016\n\nAs expected, this weekend’s three new wide releases couldn’t budge Sully from the top of the chart with the Tom Hanks/Clint Eastwood drama down a very respectable 37% in its second weekend to $22 million, for a total of $70.5 million to date. Two films, Blair Witch and Bridget Jones’s Baby both had aspirations to challenge Sully for the title, but had to settle for second and third place.
