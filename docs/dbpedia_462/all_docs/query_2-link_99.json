        "text": "So after a short break I’m back and tackling Walter Hill’s career as he entered his third decade of filmmaking, and he decided to enter it with his only sequel to date which also happened to be the sequel to his biggest box office success, was he going to arrive at the decade in style? with Another 48hrs…..\n\nIn short no, no he wasn’t because Another 48hrs is such a dull and uninspired sequel that it almost ruins the first film, if this was sold as a two DVD box-set after the first watch this DVD would gather some serious dust, it’s very rare that the title of a movie actually could be a quote from the pitch meeting\n\nExecutive one: hey you know what made money?\n\nExecutive two: no, what?\n\nExecutive one: 48hrs, you know what could make more money?\n\nExecutive two: no, what?\n\nExecutive one: Another 48hrs\n\nand then laughs and cocaine all around. And this is where the problem with this movie starts, you see sequels became a relatively new thing in the 1980s, sure certain movies had sequels before obviously but these were by and large very rare, and usually only really came about quite a few years later and only if the filmmaker had a good idea, but with the birth of the blockbuster came the birth of the sequel, Jaws 2 was released in 1978 to inferior reviews but massive box office and the sequel trend started, by 1990 we had four Jaws movies, three Indiana Jones’, three Back to the Future’s, two Romancing the stone/Jewel of the Niles’s, three Rambos and five Rocky’s. in short studios were sequel happy and many of these sequels were put together in a shoddy slapdash way (obviously with the exception of the Indiana Jones trilogy, Rocky 1-3/ 4 with a couple of pints) studios had a lax attitude to sequels and this features heavily in Another 48hrs.\n\nThe film is essentially a re run of all the best of the first movie, we get a bloody desert opening which introduces our badguy, Jack Cates on a case which brings him into contact with one of our villains, he goes to see Reggie, Reggie sings Roxanne, Reggie rousts a bar again, there’s another hotel shootout and in the end Jack has to shoot a guy holding Reggie hostage, there’s a joke early on about how Jack Cates spent some of Reggie’s money to buy a new car only to buy the exact same make, model and colour of car that he already had, which is weirdly symbolic of the movie. After watching the first one in such close proximity it made for a very dull experience.\n\nBut your thinking, hey surely it’s not exactly the same, it’s eight years later, surely they address this and add some new stuff right. Well yes it’s not exactly the same in every respect, this time they’ve shaved the edge of the film that was present in the first one. You see in the eight year interim buddy cop films had become quite a popular sub genre we had Lethal Weapon leading the charge, Hill’s own Red Heat and even Tango and Cash. When the first 48hrs came out this sub genre didn’t really exist so Hill was free to just make a thriller with two opposing guys in the lead, but by now a formula has been figured out and this movie follows it to a tee which results in a slightly neutered version, it feels like the first one if it was edited for TV. It’s very reminscient of watching Lethal Weapon 2 after the first one, the edge in Martin Riggs is gone, he’s not suicidal he’s just an adrenaline junkie stereotypical wild man cop, (though I do like Lethal Weapon 2, diplomatic immmuuuunity) and the same goes for Nolte in this. Jack Cates in the first movie felt like a regular deeply flawed man, he hurled offensive racist insults mainly to keep Murphy down but it’s also heavily implied he was bigoted. He struggled to maintain a steady relationship he drank too much, smoked too much didn’t take care of himself. But the Jack Cates here is just your classic rogue cop, but he’s not even really a rogue. The whole movie were told about how much of a maverick Cates is but to be honest he doesn’t really do anything outrageous, though it is kind of cool to see Cates being tried for the type of action movie destruction we typically see but that’s not really given enough focus, Nolte even says that he quit drinking at the start of the movie, which again is quite symbolic.\n\nBut what about Murphy? well he’s a bigger problem. In between the first film and this one Murphy’s star had gone stratospheric with monster hits like Beverly Hills Cop, Coming to America and his two stand up tours Delirious and Raw. In the meantime while Hill had enjoyed modest financial success with some of his movies during this period he also had several disappointments and hadn’t really had a big day at the box office since. The opening of this movie says it’s in association with Eddie Murphy productions and boy does it feel that way, you see the previous year Murphy had his first real disappointment with Harlem nights, an expensive vanity project that he wrote, starred in, produced and directed, it was slammed by critics and bombed at the box office, so here we have Murphy retreating to safe ground and it feels that way because he isn’t playing Reggie Hammond anymore, he’s just playing Eddie Murphy dialed up to eleven, when I reviewed the first film I said how I loved that Murphy played it relatively straight, the comedy was incidental Reggie Hammond was just a funny guy but he was still believable as a career criminal, here? absolutely not, he comes across as so shrill and loud and he seems like he’s trying so desperately to be funny that you have to wonder why anybody would do business with him, he also doesn’t participate in the action much at all, he has a tussle with a girl with a switchblade that’s quite awkward and at the end he tries to shoot one of the villains before punching him through a window, he spends the rest of the time just standing around cracking jokes while Nolte does most of the really quite minimal physical work, so much so that those two instances of action feel really out of place and ridiculous, there’s one point where Murphy has a gun trained on a villain and takes a comically long time to set up the shot before pulling the trigger and finding the gun empty, right, now remember Reggie Hammond in the first film, remember when he pointed the gun at Billy bear and was visibly shaking, where’d that guy go.\n\nWithin the rest of the cast there’s not a lot to really say, Brion James and Ed O’Ross are both wasted as Nolte’s colleagues, it’s a shame these two great character actors don’t really get a chance to shine, the villains are a group of confederate bikers who are so extreme and over the top that they seem completely out of place, the original 48hrs dealt with crooks, sure Ganz was homicidal but he was still a criminal, these guys (one of whom is meant to be Ganz younger brother in a kind of clever reference to the first one) are just flat out crazy and don’t really do much of anything. Bernie Williams is kinda cool in an extended cameo.\n\nJames Horner’s score feels and sounds a lot more like he’s copy and pasted from Commando throughout, I know he uses his score from the first movie again but when he adds new pieces it’s just Commando.\n\nOn the positives the movie looks pretty good and Hill stages all the action scenes well, three in particular stand out, the opening scene with the villains feels like something out of a western and Hill makes great use of the isolated location of a small cafe in the middle of nowhere, it’s a strong opener, the bus crash sequence is also impressive, it’s well shot, staged and the stunt is effective also the final shootout in a dry ice and mirrored nightclub is well set up though it does seem like it was edited too much.\n\nNow whenever I watched this film the odd time over the years there was always something about it that felt off to me, something I couldn’t put my finger on it was then that I discovered whilst researching it that the studio forced Hill to cut half an hour out of it a week before the release, this results in many problems, mainly pacing and the lack of development to the supporting cast but mainly plot holes, throughout the movie Jack and Reggie don’t really do much detecting there always one step behind and stuff sort of happens to them and the twist reveal of the villain makes no sense because we have no idea how Jack figured it out so fast and also the character has been edited to the point of a cameo so his reveal doesn’t really carry any weight, it gives the film a disjointed feel and a really uneven mood and tone, which is a shame because the juggling of tone is something Hill usually excels at and it’s one of the highlights of the first film.\n\nOverall Another 48hrs is one of the laziest and least inspired sequels, if you can’t find anything else to watch stick it on but I’d only recommend if your a die hard Murphy or Hill fan, even then outside the action scenes there’s not much of Hill present.\n\nNext up a true hidden gem, 1992’s Trespass.\n\nThomas Finnegan"
