        "text": "One of Eddie Murphy's co-stars from the upcoming film Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F has revealed what he was like on set.\n\nThe movie is the fourth installment in the franchise, which is set to hit Netflix on July 3. The first film was released in 1984 and starred Murphy as Axel Foley, a detective from Detroit who visited Beverly Hills to solve the murder of his best friend.\n\nRead more: Compare the Best Streaming Services\n\nThe new movie sees Murphy return to the role of Foley, this time returning to Beverly Hills after his daughter's life is threatened. It also stars Chantal Nchako, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Paul Reiser, Kevin Bacon and Taylour Paige.\n\nIn an interview with The U.S. Sun, Nchako revealed what it was like working with Murphy on the reboot. She said while he was \"amazing,\" she was advised to keep her distance from the actor, something that the original headline in the publication focused on.\n\n\"I get to fitting, which was wonderful, but they're like, 'don't talk to him,'\" she said, which took place a few days before she was scheduled to film a one-on-one scene with Murphy.\n\n\"'You know, just do your work. He doesn't talk to people.' So everybody is giving you advice on how to be, but you're the only person that's going to be on set,\" she said. \"You do want to take the advice because you don't know, you're like, 'OK, maybe that's how I should be because, you know, this is my first studio film.'\"\n\nHowever, Nchako ignored the advice she received and spoke to the actor on the day they were shooting together and they soon bonded.\n\nA representative for Nchako told Newsweek: \"The quotes from Chantal were taken wildly out of context for The US Sun pieceâ€”working with Eddie was the honor of a lifetime and was such a wonderful and truly inspiring experience and to suggest anything otherwise is false and we don't condone clickbait headlines that spur negativity.\"\n\nNewsweek emailed Murphy's spokesperson for comment on Friday.\n\nNchako told The U.S. Sun that Murphy was \"shy and reserved\" and she eventually told him how much of an honor it was to work with him. Nchako said they bonded over their African heritage and after that, they \"just started riffing.\"\n\nMurphy also gave Nchako advice, to which she said: \"My reaction was like, he is so kind. And I'm so happy that I went in and was myself. I will never forget that.\"\n\nNchako's interaction with the actor was made even more special by the fact that in between shots, he asked the professional photographer on set to take a picture of the two of them together.\n\nShe added: \"He didn't do that for anybody else. And he said, 'Make sure this gets printed and she gets this tonight.'\"\n\nNchako plays Officer Moore in the upcoming movie, who she described as a thorn in the side of Murphy's character."
