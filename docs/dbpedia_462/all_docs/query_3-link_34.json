        "text": "It’s Big Willie Style\n\nWill Smith had “star” written all over him but before he was Mike Lowery, he was just The Fresh Prince. Will was one half of the popular rap duo “DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince” who had pretty good success, becoming one of the first rappers to ever win a Grammy once they appreciated the art form. One night though, Will was at a party and Quincy Jones was there telling him how a sitcom built around him would ideally work. Will really had no intention on acting but he knew Quincy Jones had an eye for talent. Premiering in 1990, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air found Will playing a fictionalized version of himself living with his wealthy family in Bel-Air. It was a hit due to the comedic timing and heartfelt performance Will can pull out of nowhere. He set a goal a few seasons into the show to become “the biggest movie star in the world”.\n\nSix Degrees of Separation was Will’s first movie in 1993 but once we got to Bad Boys in 95 he was cooking with gas. He engulfed the role of Miami Detective Mike Lowery with so much charisma and coolness it can’t be turned away. He was handsome, he drove a nice car, he was kind of rich, he got all the girls, and he was respected. I remember reading a Letterboxd review for Men in Black of a guy saying when he was 10 years old he would play a game with another group of kids called “Will Smith” and the basis of the game was you pick whatever Will Smith character you want and then you are him for the rest of the day. Why would anyone not want to be Mike Lowery? He’s freaking awesome. He was able to keep up with Martin Lawrence’s comedy chops as well as doing a big action stunt at the same time. This movie in particular was the start of Will’s run. After this, he did Independence Day which was the highest grossing movie of 1996 and then Men in Black in 1997 to about the same financial success. A run that is so special we have not seen likes of it again unless you were in some Marvel shit.\n\nMARTY MAR!!!\n\nMartin Lawrence was a rising comedian out of Maryland in the early 90s. He had small but substantial roles in the films such as Do the Right Thing, House Party, and Boomerang. Then in 1992, Martin got his big break. He became the main host of the HBO half hour comedy show Def Comedy Jam which helped discover some of the greatest comics of all time like Bernie Mac, Chris Tucker, and Jamie Foxx.\n\nThe true big break was his very own sitcom that was greenlit by Fox network. Martin starred as the title character of a man living in Detroit working as a radio host as well as living with his girlfriend Gina, played by Tisha Campbell. Martin was an instant hit show because it displayed the comedy range he had by being able to play different characters within each episode. Sheneneh, Jerome, Roscoe, Ol Otis and countless others were characters Lawrence could just slip in and out of with ease.\n\nThe show was a commercial success. It was one of Fox’s highest rated shows while it was on air, bringing in a whooping 8 million viewers in it’s first three seasons.\n\nWill was on a roll, Martin was on a roll, and it was time for these two to meet and maybe make something special.\n\nBad Boys, Bad Boys, Whatcha gonna do?”\n\nThe great thing to me about Bad Boys is how good of an ensemble the cast is. Will Smith as the bravado Mike Lowery, Martin Lawrence as wise-cracking Marcus Burnett, Joe Pantoliano as hot-head Captain Conrad Howard, Téa Leoni as Julie and Tchéky Karyo as the bad guy Fouchet! Stacked cast even though I know for sure most of you reading this have no idea who I am talking about. Michael Bay behind the camera for his first directed film and he showed a style all of his own. Shootouts, sometimes unnecessary explosions, 360 camera angles, shitty dialogue, I LOVE IT!!\n\nBad Boys goes as follow: Fouchet and his gang steal $100 million in heroin from a police vault. Mike and Marcus are on the case. Mike sends one of his informants named Max to go investigate a party where the dealers are at and she brings her friend Julie with her. Sadly, Max gets shot and killed at the party and Julie escapes. Julie wants to be protected by Mike that same night but Mike is no where to be found, so the captain sends Marcus as Mike (which works because Julie has never met Mike before) to care for her. The 3 of them must work together while keeping their true identities apart to solve the case of the missing heroin and vengeance for Max’s murder.\n\nThe movie works so well because of the timing of everything. Martin and Will improvised when they had to because Bay didn’t like most of the actual script and wanted to see how far they would go to making each other laugh in a scene. Some of the funniest scenes in the movie are improvised including this very timeless scene after a shootout on the freeway.\n\nThe film made $141 million at the box office and although it wasn’t the biggest hit with critics, audiences loved it. They loved the natural chemistry, the big action stunts, the funny bits. So much that they made 3 more !!! (should have stopped after the 2nd).\n\nBad Boys can be rewatched at any point in time to me. It’s just such a fun watch and it’s one of me and my brother’s favorite. Rush Hour might be the superior buddy cop series depending on who you talk to but the charisma and just summer energy Bad Boys is able to capture is unlike any other buddy cop film.\n\nSide note: I wish Michael Bay still had the juice after this like this is his first movie and he found his demographic and style but then started overdoing. Michael also directed Transformers (2007) which is fantastic and The Island which is also great…but then he directs 4 more TRANSFORMERS MOVIES!!! BROTHER WHY!!! Legacy was already kind of cooked after 2001 (Pearl Harbor) but after Ambulance (2022) completely tarnished. Oh well. I will always have 3 films to remember him by."
