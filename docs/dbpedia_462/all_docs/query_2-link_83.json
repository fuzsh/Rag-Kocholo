New specifications include 2160p/Dolby Vision video. This set also includes the 2021 Paramount Presents Blu-ray which features a newly remastered 1080p picture. Both that Blu-ray and this UHD include a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless soundtrack. The extras from the new Blu-ray are included as well, but not on the UHD disc itself. Paramount has also released the original film, '48 Hrs.,' onto the UHD format.\n\nJack Cates (Nick Nolte) has pushed the edge time and again but this time he may have pushed too far. In his relentless pursuit of a criminal known as \"Iceman,\" he shoots and kills a man in the middle of a money exchange. Jack says the man shot at him first, but when an investigation turns up no supporting evidence, he faces a manslaughter charge and is given precious little time to clear his name. When Jack learns that Iceman wants Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) dead and has hired a band of bikers to do the deed, he's forced to pair up with his old \"partner\" for one more ride with more on the line than ever before: Reggie's life and Jack's freedom and career.\n\nFor a full film review, please click here.\n\nAnother 48 Hrs. 4K Blu-ray, Video Quality 4K\n\n1080p\n\nThe included screenshots are sourced from a 1080p Blu-ray disc.\n\nParamount's 2160p/Dolby Vision UHD release of 48 Hrs. shows some positive gains over the 2021 Paramount Presents Blu-ray. This appears to be sourced from the same master. The images hold similar characteristics, with the UHD amplifying the textural positives and presenting a superior color palette.\n\nParamount's UHD release of Another 48 Hrs. features 2160p/Dolby Vision video. As with the first film, this one is exceptionally grainy, though overall density is reeled in a bit, especially in well-lit daytime exteriors, such as the extended sequence chapter two. In this film, grain never gets as thick as it does right at the opening shot, but a rather heavy field remains throughout. Still, the grain is welcome a nicely complimentary to the filmmaker-intended gritty appearance. It will certainly be too much for some who are used to, and prefer, a cleaner digital sheen, but for film purists this one will more than likely please. Grain management is better on the UHD, too, compared to the 2021 Blu-ray. It's more organic and a little less clumpy here.\n\nLike the first film's UHD, this one also reveals a fairly sizeable gain to overall sharpness and clarity compared to the 2021 Blu-ray, evident in conjunction with the dense grain field. Faces are tack sharp, as are clothes, and the image reveals environments, both natural and manmade, with striking command and ease of overall definition. Textural gains and sharpness benefits are evident in practically every frame, obvious simply from watching and more than evident when conducting side-by-side A-B comparisons.\n\nThe Dolby Vision grading is very good as well. The image is not as depressed and gray as the first film, and there is little evidence of that flatter, duller palette here. Colors here are richer and can be very evocative. An explosion at the nine-minute mark just leaps off the screen with newfound intensity to fireball yellow and orange. It's a real treat and a nice gain over the Blu-ray. Color balance is excellent throughout, with dramatic gains even in subtle elements in the background and obvious elements in the foreground, including skin tones, which are very healthy and flattering (and only a mild gray push in some places). Black level depth is solid and whites are very crisp and satisfying (look at Eddie Murphy's shirt at the 43:20 mark), negotiating brightness and brilliance better than the first film's UHD and better than this film's companion Blu-ray. This is a very good UHD image from Paramount.\n\nAnother 48 Hrs. 4K Blu-ray, Audio Quality\n\nFor this UHD release of 48 Hrs., Paramount has simply ported over the existing Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless soundtrack. Its review is repurposed below from the 2021 Blu-ray review for your convenience below:\n\nLike its predecessor, Another 48 Hrs. arrives on the UHD format with a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless soundtrack that carries over from the 2021 Blu-ray. The presentation is commendable in every way. Clarity is steady throughout, detail is fine, aggression is balanced, surround implementation comes regularly, and balance is terrific. James Horner's unforgettable score is a highlight for both clarity and stage engagement. It's a saturating presentation, holding to a dominant front side placement but offering balanced surround cues to amplify the immersion and intensity. Environmental cues are likewise superb, with every key locale springing to life with incredible sonic vividness, including the famous bar brawl sequence. Gunfire hits hard, explosions rock hard, and action din is well rounded for placement and detail. Dialogue is clear and center positioned for the duration.\n\nAnother 48 Hrs. 4K Blu-ray, Special Features and Extras\n\nThe UHD disc includes no extras, but the bundled Blu-ray houses the supplements from the 2021 release. Please click here for coverage and see below for a list of the two items included. A digital copy code and a non-embossed slipcover are included with purchase.\n\nFilmmaker Focus: Director Walter Hill on Another 48 Hrs.\n\nTheatrical Trailer\n\nAnother 48 Hrs. 4K Blu-ray, Overall Score and Recommendation\n\nAnother 48 Hrs. is a casually entertaining film with a gritty edge. It has little value beyond its superficialities, which are admittedly well done and enjoyable, whether considering the action or the Nolte/Murphy interplay. When the original released, Murphy was then a star in the making but here, going on a decade removed from 48 Hrs., he was suddenly the biggest star in the world. With that comes expectations not attached to the original and, combined with a let-down script, the movie is difficult to place on the same genre-defining pedestal as the original. This is capable, serviceable entertainment but also a missed opportunity for something special. Paramount's UHD is very good, though, delivering high yield video and audio presentations. The main extra of note is a decent retrospective with Director Walter Hill. Recommended for fans.\n\nNorth America Blu-ray Discussions\n\nTopic\n\nReplies\n\nLast post\n\n• 48 Hrs.
