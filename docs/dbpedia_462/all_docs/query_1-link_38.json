        "text": "Beverly Hills Cop\n\nBeverly Hills Cop holds a retains a hallowed position in the pantheon of ‘80s blockbusters. It was the third of three films to catapult Eddie Murphy to movie stardom (the others being 1982’s 48 Hours and 1983’s Trading Places). At the time w...\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F, the fourth installment in the Beverly Hills Cop franchise, understands what made the 1984 original (and its first sequel) successful and leans heavily into those strengths although some elements don’t play as well in t...\n\nComing 2 America\n\nThe fairest way I can describe Coming 2 America is to say that it’s not as bad as I feared it might be. Damning with faint praise, indeed. My expectations were based on two factors: (1) the original movie, Coming to America, was an amusing-b...\n\nDolemite Is My Name\n\nDolemite Is My Name isn’t only a biopic of the comedian/actor/musician Rudy Ray Moore, it’s Eddie Murphy’s Valentine to one of the most outrageous figures in ‘70s Blaxploitation films. Murphy has long desired to make a movie about Moor...\n\nDr. Dolittle\n\nWhen I first heard that Twentieth Century Fox intended to re-make Dr. Dolittle with Eddie Murphy in the title role, I suspected that it was a bad move (the success of The Nutty Professor notwithstanding). Now that I have endured the 85 minute moti...\n\nDr. Dolittle 2\n\nAbout the most positive comment I can offer about Dr. Dolittle 2 is that it's not as painful to endure as its 1998 predecessor, Dr. Dolittle. Unlike the earlier Eddie Murphy effort about the M.D. who can talk with animals, the second installment m...\n\nDreamgirls\n\nDreamgirls is a wonderful entertainment: a musical that, while not skimping on the music, delivers a multi-layered storyline featuring complex characters. The average Hollywood musical focuses on spectacle and, while there's some of that to be fou...\n\nImagine That\n\nWatching Imagine That, I was beset by a feeling of intense depression. Is this what Eddie Murphy has become? Once moviedom's most high-octane comedian, a combustible mixture of raunchy, non-holds-barred verbal repartee and kinetic physical mayhem...\n\nMeet Dave\n\nBack in the 1980s, it wasn't uncommon to hear Eddie Murphy referred to as a \"comic genius.\" 20 years later, the man who once made a concert film called Raw has become a purveyor of PG-rated pabulum. At one point, Murphy could deliver while collec...\n\nMulan\n\nMy concept of a \"family film\" is a movie that can be enjoyed by viewers of all ages: undiscriminating young children, teenagers with short attention spans, and adults with somewhat more refined standards.
