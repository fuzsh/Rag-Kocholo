In 2022, the Prince of Tides actor told CNN that “I wanted to be busted out after being thrown off the force, and Eddie [would] get out of prison, and he has got to figure out who has set me up.”\n\nNeither Paramount or series director Walter Hill – who told Moviehole about a decade ago he had no interest in returning to that franchise – were interested at that stage."
