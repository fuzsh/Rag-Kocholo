        "text": "I voted 48 HOURS, which has an actual story and the peak comedic moments. BEVERLY HILLS COP feels like it was written as it was filmed and not in a good way.\n\n48 HOURS surprised a lot of moviegoers, since the gritty detective element was not featured in previews and commercials, which instead promised a non-stop yuckfest featuring SNL's brightest star. You don't even meet Eddie Murphy until several people are shot and the investigation is underway.\n\n48 HOURS was also the first action film I could recall in which guns ran out of ammo and were reloaded -- or were not, with disastrous consequences. I remember thinking, \"Wow, no one ever does this in the movies.\"\n\nDidn't 48 HOURS also achieve some sort of technical distinction -- the first film shot entirely with natural light or something like that?\n\nMartin Brest: Most underrated and underutilized director of our time.\n\nYou make consistently wonderful films. Studio messes with your latest film because of a buzz-worthy romance going on during your production, film tanks, you never work again. That's Hollywood!\n\nSo that's a vote for \"Beverly Hills Cop\" - the movie that showed Eddie Murphy doesn't have to just be a funny sidekick, but can hold a film on his own and be funny, adventurous and a STAR.\n\nJeff\n\nSaw them both at the cinema when they came out so I'm going to vote based on my reaction at the time and go for \"Beverly Hills Cop\" by a nose. By coincidence I watched \"Another 48 Hours\" last week and thoroughly enjoyed it, maybe it's my age, but I like that period of cinema.\n\nThe magic of 48 HRS. is that it's really Nick Nolte's movie, not Eddie Murphy's (with the exception of the redneck bar scene). Nick always gets the last word in their banter, Nick is more in control of the situation. Compare that to the sequel, where Nick sits around in the background while Eddie chews up the scenery.\n\nThink about the final line of the first one: \"Can I have my lighter back, Reggie?\" Jack Cates vs. Reggie Hammond? No contest."
