        "text": "A \"buddy cop\" movie doesn't necessarily need to have cops in it. No—while the trope tends to come from movies like Lethal Weapon where the entire endeavor is built on the chemistry, or lack thereof, between a pair of police officers with fundamental differences as they come together to solve a crime or figure out a mystery, a \"buddy cop\" movie can really pair any two people together. The \"cop\" part isn't the hook as much as the \"buddy\" part is. What we're looking for here is that familiar dynamic: people who aren't so similar putting aside, and even embracing their differences for a sum that's greater than its parts. It's a familiar formula, but one that can always be entertaining when executed right.\n\nOne good way to think about that formula might be with a phrase that Roger Ebert coined in his review of Rush Hour, as a \"Wunza movie.\" The opening of his review reads as follows:\n\n“Rush Hour” is our reliable friend, the Wunza Movie, pairing two opposites: Wunza legendary detective from Hong Kong, and wunza Los Angeles cop. And wunza Chinese guy, and wunza black guy. And wunza martial arts expert and wunza wisecracking showboat. Neither wunza original casting idea, but together, they make an entertaining team.\n\nYou get the idea. It's not so much the police aspect that we're after, but the dynamic of two distinctly different people coming together. Chemistry is key—you may not realize it, but that's the key ingredient you're looking for here.\n\nSo, no, not all of the movies on this list are explicitly \"police\" movies. But they all capture that dynamic you were looking for when you clicked onto this list: two people coming from different places in life, coming together to get to the bottom of something. Sometimes this can be funny. Sometimes this can be dead serious. But the formula is there, and by hook or by crook these movies tend to make it work."
