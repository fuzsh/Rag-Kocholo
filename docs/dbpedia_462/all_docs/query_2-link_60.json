        "text": "Another 48 Hrs. is the 1990 sequel to 1982's 48 Hrs. Eight years following the events of the first film, SFPD Inspector Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) finds himself working with recently released convict Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) in order to track down a notorious drug lord known as \"The Iceman\". The film was helmed by original 48 Hrs. director Walter Hill.\n\nThe following weapons were used in the film Another 48 Hrs.:\n\nWARNING! THIS PAGE CONTAINS SPOILERS!\n\nHandguns\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 29\n\nInspector Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) carries a four inch Smith & Wesson Model 29 .44 Magnum as his sidearm at the beginning of the film, just as he did at the start of the first movie.\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 629\n\nWhen he is relieved of his Model 29, Cates (Nick Nolte) then switches to his 'spare gun', a four inch Smith & Wesson Model 629 .44 Magnum, for the remainder of the film.\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 64\n\nDet. Frank Cruise (Ed O'Ross) carries a Smith & Wesson Model 64 during the club shootout. Cherry Ganz (Andrew Divoff) is also seen using the revolver.\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 66\n\nReggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) procures and uses a Snub-Nosed Smith & Wesson Model 66 to quiet down the bar fight and then shoot a guy in the knee.\n\nFreedom Arms Model 83\n\nHickok (David Anthony Marshall) uses a five inch .454 Casull Freedom Arms Model 83 as his main firearm. Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) later uses it in the motel shootout.\n\nDesert Eagle Mark I\n\nCherry Ganz (Andrew Divoff) uses a stainless Desert Eagle Mark I as his weapon. The bore indicates the gun is .357 Magnum caliber. An interesting note - The sound effect of this gun being fired had an unusual distinctive metallic ringing echo, not present in real-life.\n\nColt Python\n\nBiker boss Malcolm Price (Ted Markland) carries a six inch Colt Python. Hickok is shown using the gun during the final shootout in the Cage Club. Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) then aims it at Cherry Ganz.\n\nShotguns\n\nSWD/Cobray Street Sweeper\n\nThe SWD/Cobray Street Sweeper is used by Hickok on the bus carrying Reggie Hammond.\n\nSubmachine Guns\n\nMicro Uzi"
