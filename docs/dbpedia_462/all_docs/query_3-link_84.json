        "text": "It's almost unbelievable that 30 years ago today, Eddie Murphy went from being a famous-ish TV and movie actor to being a bona fide movie star. And it was all because of Beverly Hills Cop.\n\nBeverly Hills Cop was originally conceived as an action-drama for Sylvester Stallone, but when he backed out, Paramount and director Martin Brest took a risk and cast the wise-cracking Murphy as Axel Foley. They also hired the soon-to-be Oscar-nominated screenwriter Daniel Petrie Jr. to mainline comedy into the film, and of course Murphy added his own ribald improvisations. BHC remains a game-changer in comedies. It's still fresh, original, hilarious, and shocking—maybe even more so today than in 1984.\n\nThe movie grossed over $316 million worldwide (that's $723 million adjusted for inflation), topped the 1984 box office, received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, won a People's Choice award for Favorite Motion Picture, landed on AFI's 100 Funniest American Movies of All Time list, and had the distinction of being the highest-grossing R-rated film for 19 years and the highest-grossing comedy for almost 25 years (The Matrix Reloaded and The Hangover, respectively, shattered those records). Its subsequent sequels weren't as well-received or as good, but without BHC, we arguably wouldn't have hybrid-comedies like Crocodile Dundee, Bad Boys, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, and 22 Jump Street.\n\nIn honor of Beverly Hills Cop's anniversary, we talked to actors Judge Reinhold and Bronson Pinchot and writer Daniel Petrie Jr. about how the movie shaped Hollywood and comedy for years to come.\n\nIt made a genre of its own.\n\nWhen it came out, Beverly Hills Cop was a particularly unusual blend of buddy comedy, fish-out-of-water comedy, and straight cop action.\n\n\"I saw Beverly Hills Cop more as a comedy just because I had been a starving writer living and working in Beverly Hills, so I had the experience of walking down the street thinking, 'Oh, maybe I'll stop in here and get a tie,'\" Daniel Petrie Jr. remembers. \"'Oh wait, it's $4,000.' It seemed like a cop from a blue-collar area would be so struck with amusement about Beverly Hills and all the pretentiousness, that some great fish-out-of-water comedy could be mined from that.\"\n\nMurphy's 48 Hrs. was the progenitor of buddy-cop films, but BHC turned the genre on its head, making Axel Foley a lone wolf instead of partnering him up with another cop (which would predominate in the sequels).\n\n\"The action part of the action-comedy thing is important because for that kind of genre to work, it seems to me anyway, there has to be some level of reality to it,\" Petrie Jr. says. \"The bad guys are really bad. They're not goofy. They're not comic figures, and the police, although we make fun of them, they aren't ridiculous. They're more realistic. I think they did a great job capturing that.\"\n\nFoley's a hard-nosed Detroit cop who finds himself \"vacationing\" in Beverly Hills to avenge his childhood friend Mikey's (James Russo) murder. As a guest in 90210, Foley eschews playing by the rules. \"It's one thing to be a fish out of water, but it's another thing to be so audacious and outrageous where you don't belong,\" says Judge Reinhold, who played the role of Beverly Hills detective Billy Rosewood. \"And that's something Eddie brought. Axel is really his own guy.\"\n\nJudge Reinhold as Det. Billy Rosewood and Bronson Pinchot as Serge.\n\nIt may be a comedy, but its emotions are deep.\n\nBHC once imagined Sly Stallone as Foley, who avenges his friend's death with immense bloodshed. In fact, Billy Rosewood was supposed to die midway through the movie. During a serious scene, Mikey reveals to Foley his involvement with shady Beverly Hills businessmen and soon after gets shot in the head, which becomes the film's inciting incident.\n\n\"James Russo, when he turns to Eddie in the bar and he says, 'You know why I didn't take the rap? Because I love you, man.' That moment was so genuine,\" Reinhold says. \"I also thought even though it was such a small role, James Russo really created such an emotional through line. He blew the doors off of that moment. You really do feel Eddie's loss.\"\n\nAgain, the reality of the story reeled people in. \"When Jimmy Russo gets shot in the back of the head in that long shot of the hallway, you don't get more real than that,\" Reinhold says. \"And Marty [Brest]—that was a real risk to think he could have that tonal change. It was this really happy accident between having a really strong foundation, a really strong action storyline, and then having nuclear comic power like Eddie.\"\n\nFoley doesn't bend to anyone.\n\nFrom the moment Foley arrives in Beverly Hills to the time he wraps up the case, he doesn't experience much of a character arc. He's still the same sardonic, rule-bashing cop who uses outlaw techniques to investigate the murder of his friend. \"Eddie Murphy's character comes to Beverly Hills and he doesn't change, but Beverly Hills changes, if you will,\" Petrie Jr. says. \"The Beverly Hills cops—he changes them. That was very much a conscious choice.\" The supporting characters Billy Rosewood and John Taggart (John Ashton) go from being unable to tell a single lie to watching their lieutenant (Ronny Cox) fib to his boss about how the police department took down the villain, Victor Maitland. Those character transformations filter into Beverly Hills Cop II.\n\nSo he can punish Maitland, Foley's gambit is to twist Rosewood's arm until he relents in performing illegal activities with him. Foley's ballsy, meddling, hunch-driven, suave demeanor is juxtaposed with his by-the-book, conservative cohorts.\n\n\"I remember Billy is described in the script as an 'eager young detective craving the action,'\" Reinhold says. \"With the exception of the dumb way we tried to scale the wall in the final shootout scene, John Taggart is a salt-of-the-earth, experienced sergeant, which means he had to make that rank by being a good cop. I remember circling Billy's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid reference in the script and thinking, 'This is the key to this guy. He wants to be in the movie that Axel seems to live in.'\"\n\nIt has a non-stereotypical gay character.\n\nIn the script, Bronson Pinchot's art dealer Serge was a gay American named Jacques.\"He was a very stock character,\" Pinchot explains. \"He was just the gay shop boy who Eddie's character just hammered. In the script he was this period set piece from the '80s of 'now we bash the gay character,' and I, without mentally or consciously planning to, made it into not 'we bash,' but 'we play with.' Possibly that's why it made such an impact, because I think you would never look at that character and say, well, now we're going to bash him, which was perfectly acceptable in 1984, 1985. He seemed like, 'We're going to have fun, and you're going to accept me as a person.'\"\n\nThe producers gave Pinchot free reign to create his own version of the character. Inspired by his blasé Israeli makeup artist friend Lilly Benyair—\"I not only did her accent but I also did her bones, because she didn't have any\"—Pinchot melded her mannerisms into Serge. Murphy and Pinchot did 36 improvised takes, mainly because Brest wanted to see what would happen.\n\n\"[Serge] is very innocent and he's very approachable and he's very friendly,\" Pinchot says. \"I thought when I was doing it that he was something else. He's a very sweet character. I didn't see that for decades. They said to me at the time, 'We love the sweetness and the innocence in the character.' I said, 'I don't know where you saw that,' but then you look back later, and you say 'Oh yeah, he's very open.'\"\n\nEven though Serge is only onscreen for two minutes, it made Pinchot so famous that he escaped to Greece in order to cope with the sudden attention. The role also got him cast as yet another accented character: Balki from Perfect Strangers. In 1994, he reprised the Serge role in Beverly Hills Cop III, but it wasn't funny. Pinchot noticed a couple of movies after BHC ripping off Serge, and he turned down other Serge-like parts. He eventually found more range in 1993's True Romance.\n\nEddie Murphy's role opened doors for black comedians.\n\nBy the time BHC was released, Murphy had been cracking people up on SNL for four seasons and had co-starred in hit comedies Trading Places and 48 Hrs., but he had yet to carry his own film. Before Murphy, Richard Pryor had led a successful box-office career, but not to the caliber of what Murphy would bring. BHC was just the start of what became $6 billion in worldwide box-office receipts for Murphy's films. More importantly, BHC made Murphy the highest-grossing black box-office champ for a decade, until 1995, when Will Smith starred in Bad Boys (an action-comedy indebted to BHC in several ways).\n\n\"It was important for black folks. I was welcomed into some nightclubs in Chicago that no white man's ever been in,\" Reinhold says. \"I still enjoy a lot of support from the black community. They don't even know my name. They say, 'Hey, Billy.' They just know me as Billy. That's important in terms of culture, when you think about how that helped change perception and what a milestone it was for black Americans.\"\n\nDamon Wayans has a brief yet memorable scene with Murphy in BHC. He's the one who gives Axel the tailpipe bananas. Two years after the film, in 1986, Murphy discovered an early-twenties Chris Rock doing standup and got him a small role in 1987's Beverly Hills Cop II,as a valet who parks Rosewood's pilfered cement mixer truck. \"It always makes me laugh that Chris Rock valeted my truck, because he's my favorite comic now,\" Reinhold says.\n\nBeverly Hills Cop had a lot of F-bombs.\n\nMurphy's vulgar standup routine trickled into the film, which is why there are about 13 curse words within the first few minutes and why he utters \"Get the fuck out of here\" a lot. Plus, cops always curse. Petrie Jr. summed up the cursing with this anecdote:\n\n\"I remember my wife's sister came to visit me in my office. I had just gotten a new computer. I was trying to show her how word processing worked on the computer because she'd never seen it. So I was calling up scenes from the script I was writing, Beverly Hills Cop. My wife's sister is very religious and on every page all I could see was 'fuck, fuck, fuck.' So I quickly said, 'Well, let me find another scene.' I couldn't find a scene that I could really show off.\"\n\nIt's unclear if BHC is exactly responsible for the deluge of four-letter words in comedies and other films that followed, but it certainly set a new bar for acceptability. In 1987's Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, Steve Martin's character drops 18 F-bombs in one minute, just to prove a point. Eddie Murphy's Raw comedy film the same year has over 200 uses of \"fuck,\" a word that would come to dominate everything from the work of Quentin Tarantino to Hot Tub Time Machine and Martin Scorsese's all-things-in-excess The Wolf of Wall Street, the current record-holder for most F-bombs thrown in a non-documentary film, with over 500 mentions. A fine legacy, indeed."
