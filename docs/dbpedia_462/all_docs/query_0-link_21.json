        "text": "48 Hrs. is a 1982 American buddy cop action comedy movie directed by Walter Hill. It is Joel Silver's first movie as a movie producer. The screenplay was written by Hill, Roger Spottiswoode, Larry Gross, Steven E. de Souza, and Jeb Stuart. The movie stars Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy (in his movie debut and Golden Globe Award-nominated role) as a cop and convict, respectively, who team up to catch two cop-killers, Albert Ganz and Billy Bear, played respectively by James Remar and Sonny Landham. The title refers to the amount of time they have to solve the crime.\n\nIt is often credited as being the first movie in the \"buddy cop\" genre, which included the subsequent films Beverly Hills Cop (also starring Murphy), Lethal Weapon, Bad Boys and Rush Hour.\n\nA sequel, Another 48 Hrs., was released on June 8, 1990."
