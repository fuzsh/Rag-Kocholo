        "text": "Eddie Murphy is undeniably one of the most influential and beloved figures in the world of comedy. From his breakout role on Saturday Night Live to his iconic performances in blockbuster films, Murphy has consistently delivered laughter and entertainment. Here we look at the best Eddie Murphy movies and we ranked them in order of our favorites. See if you agree with us.\n\n14. Norbit (2007): Eddie Murphy Movies\n\nDirected by Brian Robbins, Norbit is a comedy focusing on a mild-mannered man (Eddie Murphy) who must deal with the antics of his overbearing wife (also played by Murphy). Murphy not only starred as both characters, but he also wrote the screenplay (with Charlie Murphy and Jay Sherick).

Boomerang (1992): Eddie Murphy Movies\n\nDirected by Reginald Hudlin, Boomerang follows a successful executive and womanizer (Eddie Murphy) who discovers a lot about love and relationships when his new female boss is an even bigger player than he is. Boomerang showcases Murphy’s charm and comedic timing in a romantic comedy setting. We also love the performances given by Halle Berry and Robin Givens.\n\nWatch this now on Sling.\n\n11. The Nutty Professor (1996)\n\nThe Nutty Professor, directed by Tom Shadyac, is a comedy where a professor (Eddie Murphy) develops a potion that turns him into a slim, suave ladies’ man but also brings out his alter ego, Buddy Love.

Dr. Dolittle was a commercial success and spawned several sequels, cementing Murphy’s status as a bankable star.\n\nWatch this now on Starz.\n\n9. Bowfinger (1999)\n\nWe love Bowfinger because it stars two of our favorite comedians together: Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy. The plot follows an aspiring filmmaker Bobby Bowfinger (Martin) on the verge of bankruptcy.\n\nDesperate for his big break, he concocts a crazy plan to make his ultimate dream movie. Rallying a ragtag team that includes a starry-eyed ingenue (Heather Graham), a has-been diva (Christine Baranski) and a film studio gofer (Jamie Kennedy), he sets out to shoot a blockbuster featuring the biggest star in Hollywood, Kit Ramsey (Murphy), only without letting Ramsey know he’s in the picture.\n\nWatch this now on Starz.\n\n8. Dreamgirls (2006): Eddie Murphy Movies\n\nDreamgirls is based on the Broadway musical of the same name, following the rise of a fictional 1960s girl group inspired by The Supremes. With a star-studded cast including Eddie Murphy, Beyoncé Knowles, Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Hudson and Danny Glover, this movie showed Murphy can do drama just as well as comedy.\n\nWatch this now on Paramount Plus.\n\n7. Tower Heist (2011)\n\nTower Heist follows a group of employees who plan to rob the wealthy businessman who defrauded them.

Dolemite Is My Name (2019): Eddie Murphy Movies\n\nDolemite Is My Name, directed by Craig Brewer, is a biographical comedy-drama based on the life of filmmaker Rudy Ray Moore (played by Eddie Murphy), who created the iconic blaxploitation character Dolemite. The movie also has guest appearances by Snoop Dogg, Chris Rock and Wesley Snipes.\n\nWatch this now on Netflix.\n\n5. 48 Hrs. (1982)\n\nDirected by Walter Hill, 48 Hrs. follows a cop (Nick Nolte) who teams up with a convict (Eddie Murphy) to catch a pair of cop killers within 48 hours. This was one of Eddie Murphy’s earlier movies and his on-screen antics with Nick Nolte make it one of our favorites.\n\nWatch this now on PlutoTV.\n\n4. Coming to America (1988): Eddie Murphy Movies\n\nComing to America tells the story of an African prince (Eddie Murphy) who travels to America to find a wife who will love him for who he is, not his royal status. Also starring Arsenio Hall and James Earl Jones, this comedy is Murphy at his best.\n\nWatch this now on Sling.\n\n3. Trading Places (1983)\n\nThis movie has a huge cult following and for good reason. Eddie Murphy is hilarious. In this comedy directed by John Landis, a streetwise con artist (Eddie Murphy) and a wealthy stockbroker (Dan Aykroyd) unknowingly switch lives as part of a bet. The movie also stars Jamie Lee Curtis.\n\nWatch this now on PlutoTV.\n\n2. Beverly Hills Cop (1984): Eddie Murphy Movies\n\nAnother of our all-time favorite Eddie Murphy movies is Beverly Hills Cop.

Shrek (2001)\n\nIn this animated comedy directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, a grumpy ogre named Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) embarks on a quest to rescue Princess Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz) with the help of a talkative donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy). Murphy is the stand-out star in this movie and his part as Donkey made Shrek a box office success and earned widespread acclaim. It also launched a successful and very profitable franchise.\n\nWatch this now on Peacock."
