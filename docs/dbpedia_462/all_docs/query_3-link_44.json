        "text": "In 1984, comedian Eddie Murphy starred as quick-witted Detroit detective Axel Foley in “Beverly Hills Cop,” launching his career into the stratosphere and defining the buddy cop film genre. With banana-in-the-tailpipe gags and one of the most recognizable theme songs of all time, the film was a box office smash and soon turned into a full-blown action-comedy franchise. Forty years later, Murphy reprises his role for the fourth installment, “Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F,” which streams on Netflix July 3.\n\nMurphy – along with his family, castmates and filmmakers of the upcoming movie – celebrated in Beverly Gardens Park on June 20 as the Beverly Hills City Council declared the date as “Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F” Day.\n\nMayor Lester Friedman read an official proclamation honoring the film series.\n\n“The city of Beverly Hills proudly acknowledges the cultural impact of the ‘Beverly Hills Cop’ franchise, which has delighted audiences globally since its debut in 1984,” Friedman said. “The ‘Beverly Hills Cop’ movies have significantly contributed to the positive image and global recognition of Beverly Hills, highlighting its beauty, sophistication and vibrant community … The City Council of the city of Beverly Hills do hereby declare June 20, 2024, as ‘Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F Day.’”\n\nThe franchise’s longtime producer Jerry Bruckheimer accepted the proclamation on behalf of the film.\n\nBruckheimer and Murphy were joined by “Axel F” stars Judge Reinhold and John Ashton, who are reprising their roles as Foley’s old police friends Lt. Billy Rosewood and BHPD Chief John Taggart, respectively. The cast stood alongside director Mark Molloy, who is making his feature film directorial debut. Additionally, Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos attended the event.\n\nThe cast and filmmakers met and shook hands with members of the Beverly Hills City Council and real-life Beverly Hills cop, BHPD Chief Mark Stainbrook.\n\nOn his way out, Murphy stopped by a crowd of fans to sign autographs and pose for pictures.\n\nThe film also stars Kevin Bacon and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as BHPD officers. “Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F” will stream exclusively on Netflix beginning July 3.
