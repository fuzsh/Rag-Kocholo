        "text": "Beverly Hills Cop (1984) is Eddie Murphy’s cleverly disguised story of racial discrimination, which comes from real life experiences. An early scene features Murphy’s character Axel Foley being thrown out a ground-floor window for pushing an (evil) businessman too far, a situation that gets him arrested. The (white) cops show up and arrest him. For getting thrown out a window. Sure, the cops make up some dumb cover story, but Foley knows what’s really going on, and that’s the comedy of the situation. Murphy raises his voice and shouts the punchline so as to drive the discrimination home, because it really is funny, and that’s the kind of situational humor Beverly Hills Cop presents. One of the reasons the movie was so successful is because it has edge, much like Murphy’s stand-up when he first started, an act that is severely underrated.\n\nThe movie turns into a murder mystery buddy cop drama. Judge Reinhold and John Ashton complement the movie and stand-in as the bumbling sidekicks like Watson to Sherlock Holmes, if Holmes was brought up in the inner city and was heavily sarcastic. Eddie Murphy has this charm that makes him instantly likeable on screen, but it helps that the character is as grounded as he is. He’s an experienced cop from Detroit, which is in itself a stereotype but it works.\n\nAxel has the characteristics of a true hero. He continues to save the day and humbly put off praise, poking fun at real life situations and dumb circumstances that are really funny when pointed out. He makes it his business to make fun of rich people, and it works for the character, which makes the villain work even better. Steven Berkoff plays Victor Maitland, a notorious scumlord. Murphy uses his R-rating to sneak into Maitland’s elite club and threaten him, rotating acts between mad black man, outrageous gay guy and honest cop, which is all from his stand up. It’s a great performance and great script writing.\n\nSo I can’t decide if the hotel scene is supposed to be funny or not. I find it funny because it’s over-the-top but many people have shot holes into this scene and called it absurd, because the desk clerk looks like he was born yesterday. Axel interrogates the clerk and pulls the race card, which is supposed to be the funny part. He goes way over-the-top and it’s funny because we know it’s not true, because the innocent (white) desk clerk is just a poor sod trying to do his job. Most of the racial jokes in the movie work best with people completely unaware or inexperienced, which is why Roger Ebert found these situations offensive. He claimed that the movie should have had more outward satire but honestly, it’s there under the surface, Ebert just chose to ignore it because the movie had action too.\n\nOverall, I can’t decide if Ebert is right and this movie doesn’t go far enough or if it’s funny enough just the way it is. I think it does have good touches of Eddie Murphy in its DNA, like the discrimination highlighted in the glass-window scene I mentioned earlier. There’s tons of that in Beverly Hills Cop. The cast is good, the dialogue is good, so I don’t have much to complain about unlike Roger Ebert, who doesn’t like a lot of the characters. I don’t get it. It’s a mainstream movie with thematic elements bordering on heavy-handed, so I disagree with Ebert this time. Many people argue Beverly Hills Cop is the best movie of the 80s and it’s certainly up there, right next to Ninja Force (1984) and Howard the Duck (1986). Just joking."
