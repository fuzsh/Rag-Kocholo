        "text": "Not a lot of films can lay claim to having created an entire genre, but the fact is that action-comedy as we know and love it simply didn’t exist before Beverly Hills Cop showed just how much fun that combination can be.\n\nIt’s not that action movies didn’t have humor before Beverly Hills Cop, but the particular balance achieved by Martin Brest’s 1984 megahit (it was the highest-grossing R-rated film of all-time until Fatal Attraction dethroned it in 1987) demonstrated an intoxicating alchemy that umpteen movies (everything from Tango & Cash to Bad Boys) would subsequently strive to capture.\n\nAs much as it was undoubtedly a team effort, the main reason the film works as well as it does is thanks to its then-nascent leading man, Eddie Murphy, playing a Detroit cop named Axel Foley, navigating the perilous waters of Los Angeles’ famously affluent suburb.\n\n“The whole damn film works because of the charm, comedy chops, and screen presence of Eddie Murphy,” says William. Anna celebrates how Murphy created “an undisputed classic comedy character and a complete human being out of whole cloth, granting the man interiority in just about every situation as he carefully modulates his personality based on the other players’ age, sex, race, or position.” Or, as Jade simply puts it, “I swear Eddie Murphy must’ve been the coolest guy back in the ’80s.”\n\nHe’s still pretty cool now, as I experienced firsthand when getting on a Zoom call with Murphy to discuss the new sequel Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F and the legacy of the original film. Before he got on board, Murphy explains that the 1984 feature was developed as a more straightforward police thriller. The structure was there: it always concerned a street-smart Detroit cop schooling Beverly Hills law enforcement—but it lacked the critical Eddie Murphy factor.\n\n“The original Beverly Hills Cop was written for Sylvester Stallone,” Murphy tells me. “It was supposed to be one of those serious cop movies. When I came in, it turned into [something with] comedy mixed in with it, and then that became this new thing.”\n\nMainstream cinema was never the same again. Murphy’s unstoppable charisma and agile comedic chops shook up a genre known for self-serious macho posturing, and the moviegoing public couldn’t get enough. “It’s the start of a genre,” Murphy theorizes about the first film’s massive success. “Before Beverly Hills Cop, there was no movie like Beverly Hills Cop. The cop movies and action movies were serious, with people like Clint Eastwood, Charles Bronson. And there was nothing funny in the movies. The movie has been around all these years because it’s the beginning of the action-comedy genre.”\n\nAs Nick says, Beverly Hills Cop “set benchmarks for all the buddy cop, action comedy, and Eddie Murphy movies to come.” “Maybe the definitive ’80s comedy action cop film,” concurs Barry.\n\nMany have chased the action-comedy benchmark Nick refers to, but few have cleared it. Today, it can be difficult to imagine just how bold it seemed back then. “When we were doing it at that time, it felt pretty edgy to fuse comedy and dangerous elements together,” Judge Reinhold reflects. The actor, who played local cop and unofficial babysitter Rosewood in the original film, and subsequently appeared in all the sequels, including the new one, adds: “I wasn’t sure it would work. I didn’t think we were gonna bomb, but it was a new feeling. If we didn’t create the action-comedy genre, we certainly helped define it. I’m proud of that legacy.”\n\nJohn Ashton, who plays Rosewood’s more seasoned partner Taggart in the first, second and now fourth movies, also attributes the enduring success of the original to the contagious dynamic between his, Reinhold’s and Murphy’s characters—the heart and soul of the story. “Our relationships with one another during the film, I think the audience caught on to that. They enjoyed our relationship,” Ashton comments. “Eddie was the fish out of water, coming to Beverly Hills. I’m very, very proud of it. We created a genre that will live forever, which is a pretty good feeling.”\n\nDaniel agrees, writing that “although Murphy is a one-man-army comedian, the chemistry between Foley, Rosewood, and Taggart is what makes this film truly hilarious.” Josh adds, “Whenever the film is focused on these [three] characters, it’s an absolute blast.”\n\nKevin Bacon, who plays antagonist Captain Cade Grant in Axel F, agrees with Ashton that the out-of-towner element of the original was also key to its success. “I think that ‘fish out of water’ is one of the great concepts,” Bacon says. “You’re getting a chance to look at a place that is paradise from some peoples’ point of view, or really bizarre from another person’s point of view. Of course, you had Eddie’s comic genius and action and a great supporting cast, but the fish out of water piece of it is what really made it sail.”\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt, who joins the franchise as a Beverly Hills detective assigned to handle Foley in the new film, credits both the premise and Murphy himself. “He’s just an extraordinary performer,” Gordon-Levitt tells me. “I also think that Beverly Hills deserves to be made fun of. These neighborhoods where people flaunt their wealth. Seeing Eddie as a Detroit cop getting to come in and wreak havoc, and show these people what for, is satisfying and funny.”\n\nMark Molloy, the Australian filmmaker who makes his feature directing debut with Axel F, is very conscious of the legacy that he’s now part of. “[Beverly Hills Cop] was hugely influential in shaping that whole generation,” he says. “[Producer] Jerry Bruckheimer has his finger on the pulse and how he put those elements together like that for the first time, he changed cinema.”\n\nThere’s a scene early on in the new film where Gordon-Levitt’s Detective Bobby Abbott is processing Foley, who has been arrested in Beverly Hills after causing chaos while attempting to help his estranged lawyer daughter Jane (Taylour Paige). As Abbott goes through Foley’s file, the movie offers some meta commentary on the preceding entries in the franchise. “Disturbing the peace, various shoot-outs, evading the police. This is from ’84,” says Abbott while looking at photos from the first film. “Then there’s one from ’87. And then ’94… not your finest hour.”\n\nAs suggested by Abbott’s aside, 1994’s Beverly Hills Cop III (which saw Murphy reunite with his Trading Places and Coming to America director John Landis) is less fondly recalled. But the undeniably flawed film has its fans. (I am not ashamed to say I am one of them.) “Needlessly shrugs off the formula that made the prior two films so effective, but it is an undeniable pleasure to see Eddie Murphy’s Axel Foley in action once again,” asserts Travis. “While a noticeable drop down from the first two I still had a load of fun with it,” says Helen. “Unpopular opinion, but I enjoyed this more than the second one,” whispers Tom.\n\nThe film’s detractors are mostly unhappy with how relatively mellow Foley is in Murphy’s third outing, which came at a time in the actor’s trajectory where he was displaying less interest in leaning on his fast-talking comedic persona, and more in expanding his repertoire with varied performances in films like Boomerang, as a suave romantic lead, and Vampire in Brooklyn, playing the vampire in question.\n\n“Way too silly a premise for Murphy to decide the character should become more serious and mature,” Keith says of the amusement park-set movie. “There is something fun about spoofing Disneyland, but it doesn't make sense for this franchise,” concludes Neal. “The fast-talking energy he brought to the role of Axel in I and II is just NOT THERE,” complains Geoff.\n\nThese comments highlight what is, perhaps, most remarkable about Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F, which arrives 30 years later: the Axel Foley in it has aged, of course, but it’s still the same Axel Foley we know and love. Murphy says it was a priority to acknowledge the passage of time in the new film. “I’m doing the age-appropriate version of Axel Foley,” he says. “Axel Foley is 21 in the first movie, and has no kids and is a legal adult just recently. Now I’m a grandpa, in my 60s. It’s a whole different person.”\n\nAge-appropriate or not, Murphy is positively firing on all cylinders as Axel. Demonstrating clear affection for the man over many of the others he has played over the years, Murphy says reinhabiting the character was a breeze because he never got a chance to leave Axel behind.\n\n“[It was] easy for me because Beverly Hills Cop is always on,” he explains. “It’s always on TV, it’s always on cable. It’s in the background, it’s part of the lexicon. It’s around. So it was really easy to go and do the character again.” Considering it’s the character he is arguably most associated with (for people who didn’t grow up on the Shrek movies), I am tempted to ask how close Axel Foley is to Eddie Murphy. “I’m not like anybody in my movies,” responds Murphy. “[It’s] a persona. I play extroverts on-screen, but I’m an introverted person.”\n\nMurphy’s improvisational skills were famously deployed throughout the original to great comedic effect. Axel’s interactions with Bronson Pinchot’s snooty art gallery worker Serge, are an oft-cited example, and the loose, organic dynamic Axel builds with Taggart and Rosewood rings wonderfully true, with Murphy ready to riff. Those skills are on full display in the new one, and I ask Murphy what preparation is required to improvise in character. It turns out, none. “It just kind of happens,” he says, casually betraying his genius. “I’m always saying I’m not a method actor, but I have my method: my method is an off/on switch. I don’t do prep, I don’t read the scene before we do it. I come out to the set and be like, ‘What scene are we shooting?’”\n\nHe continues: “I was watching 48 Hrs. [Murphy’s first movie] the other day, and it was a scene where we were walking and I was like, ‘Wow, I came up with that!’ I came up with it in my very first movie. I’ve always tried to make it feel like the dialogue and the interactions are real.”\n\nGordon-Levitt says Murphy improvised in almost every scene they shared in the new movie. “That’s where it gets fun,” he explains, grinning widely. “The script was great, of course. But when Eddie starts making stuff up, that’s when everything would really come to life.”\n\nThe actor says he loves improvising, but tries not to be a comedian in those moments. “My instinct with improvisation is to be real and give the honest response of whatever would actually happen in that situation. I think Eddie actually really likes that. That’s why he and I worked well together, because as big and bombastic as he can be, there’s always something really real about all his performances.”\n\nOne scene between Gordon-Levitt and Murphy sees Abbott having a panic attack as Foley forces him to fly a helicopter against his will. It’s not only an interesting indication that the film was made in 2024 (not a lot of panic attacks in older action movies) but the resultant interaction speaks to the realness Gordon-Levitt is referring to. “There’s a human core,” the actor continues, “So with the improvisation, rather than reaching for a joke or trying to make the audience laugh, being real is where the scenes would come to life. And then, lo and behold, that’s often where the funniest moments would also emerge.”\n\nAs indicated by the title of the new film, music plays a key role in these movies. Beverly Hills Cop score composer Harold Faltermeyer’s legendary synthwave banger ‘Axel F’ (which the Shrek generation may know better as… shudder… Crazy Frog) has proved almost as iconic as the movie itself. Indeed, the most popular Letterboxd review of Beverly Hills Cop is solely about the infectious earworm. “Me when the theme song plays for the 200th time: oh hey I love this song I hope they play it again in the next scene,” admits Patrick.\n\n“Brb just going to hum the theme tune for the rest of eternity…” confesses Fred, speaking for us all. “The ‘Axel F’ theme song is going to be stuck in my head for the rest of the year now,” says Sophie, not indicating whether she considers this a good thing or a bad thing. “‘Axel F’ might be the greatest theme song to any movie ever made,” observes Todd, correctly.\n\nThanks to the depressingly ubiquitous, cellphone-adjacent Crazy Frog version of ‘Axel F’, the song has become something of a punchline over the years (did you notice the ringtone in Talk to Me?), but Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is here to reclaim it for the Faltermeyer hive. ‘Axel F’ isn’t a joke anymore.\n\nBoth songs—and a whole lot of ‘Axel F’, natch, including new remixes—feature prominently in Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F. Molloy says it was key to recapture the feel of the original film. “Music was such a huge part of the franchise,” the director explains. “The fact that I got to use not just ‘Axel F’ but that whole soundtrack, I was like a kid in a candy store. It’s been 40 years since the first Beverly Hills Cop, which allows us to take some of those songs from the old films and play with them again, because so much of that is what the people remember from those films.”\n\nThe presence of these songs helps Axel F achieve something very difficult in the year of our Lord 2024: it actually, properly, genuinely evokes the ’80s action-comedy vibes of the original. Which is to say, it succeeds where Stuber tried and failed. “My pitch to [Producer] Jerry [Bruckheimer] and to Netflix and everyone was: ‘I want to go back to the well. I want a contemporary version of an ’80s action-comedy,’” says Molloy. “I wanted to take what I felt made Beverly Hills Cop and Beverly Hills Cop II so special and pull that into a modern world.”\n\n“They were pretty gritty films back in the day,” he continues. “They were really funny, but they were also really grounded. They had a very innate sense of stakes and danger there, but still allowed for the comedy.” Even the action in the film feels old school. Molloy says that was achieved by keeping things as practical as possible.\n\n“I did everything in-camera that I could do in-camera. Which is much harder these days, as opposed to pulling out a green screen,” the director explains. “With modern films, everything’s become so choreographed and designed that there’s no mistakes, everything feels almost too perfect. [Shooting in-camera], we make mistakes and allow for spontaneity to happen. Luckily, we shot in LA, where there are so many wonderful craftsmen that we could really build these action sequences for real.”\n\nOne such sequence sees Gordon-Levitt and Murphy haphazardly “flying” a helicopter around the Beverly Hills streets. “The scene where the helicopter is doing all this insane looking stuff, there was a ‘really insane helicopter stuff’ pilot that really did that stuff with a helicopter, and they just shot it with a camera,” adds Gordon-Levitt. “It’s not an animated helicopter. I think you can feel that when you watch it.” He’s right—even though it can be difficult to pinpoint which shots do and don’t have special effects, an overall sense of tangibility permeates the set piece, and indeed Axel F as a whole, which helps connect it to the obvious ’80s feeling of the original.\n\nThose vibes were easily accessed for Bacon: he helped create them with his lead performance in the 1984 classic Footloose, among many other roles. “It definitely evokes that era, but at the same time it feels updated,” says Bacon. “Is it the fact that you have the original cast there? And you throw me into the mix, who was actually from the ’80s…”\n\nMurphy himself even dipped his toe back into the action-comedy waters with 1997’s Metro, which, with its (soft) R-rating and Michael Wincott villain, is better than you might expect, as well as two 2002 team-up movies: Showtime with Robert De Niro and I Spy alongside Owen Wilson. And yet, neither was allowed more than one F-word utterance. Meanwhile, the action franchises that were aimed at an adult audience—like, say, the John Wick movies—weren’t overly concerned with having a comedic tone.\n\nAlong the way, there were some notable outliers—I happen to believe that 2 Fast 2 Furious is a particularly successful throwback (watch it again, Tyrese Gibson is hilarious), and exempt from the dourness that defines the rest of the films in that series. Shane Black, who wrote the original Lethal Weapon (and helped define the genre) and The Last Boy Scout (which I consider its high point), directed a couple of great nostalgic action comedies in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and The Nice Guys.\n\nBut very few of the many attempts to capture the ’80s tone do as good a job as Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F. Case closed. Eddie Murphy agrees: “Yeah, man, it came together good.”"
