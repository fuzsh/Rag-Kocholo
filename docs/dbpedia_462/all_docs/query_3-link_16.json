        "text": "#10 – “Bon Cop, Bad Cop” (2006)\n\nKicking off our list is the good cop-bad cop flick with the bilingual twist. This Canadian film follows Bouchard and Ward, two cops from the provinces of Quebec and Ontario. When a body ends up on the border between their jurisdictions, the two reluctantly join forces despite their cultural differences. The result is a memorable match-up that includes just as much bickering as it does investigating.\n\n#9 – “Running Scared” (1986)\n\nNext up, Billy Crystal and Gregory Hines play Chicago detectives Danny and Ray. These best friends and partners are incredibly childish, notorious for their unorthodox policing methods, and are regularly reprimanded as a result. They’re a joy to watch because of their witty exchanges and unusual retirement plan. Seriously though, who can blame them after having their car and pants stolen on the job?\n\n#8 – “Tango & Cash” (1989)\n\nSylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell play rival LAPD narcotics detectives who are framed for murder and sent to prison. Forced to survive together while working towards the truth, they’re fun to watch for several reasons: 1) their deep hatred of each other, 2) their ultra-competitive nature, and 3) their painful one-liners. But ultimately, their friendship blossoms over the course of prison beatings and communal showers. Awwwww.\n\n#7 – “Starsky and Hutch” (2004)\n\nBen Stiller and Owen Wilson take on the roles of the iconic streetwise cops from the 1970s TV show in this big-screen adaptation. Swapping the original character traits, Stiller’s Starsky is the serious afro-clad cop with the Ford Gran Torino, while Wilson’s Hutch a tad too laidback. This comedic pairing works on so many levels, from their ill-fated arrests, to their interrogations, and willingness to do whatever it takes!\n\n#6 – “21 Jump Street” (2012)\n\nIn another hilarious adaptation of a classic series, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum play former classmates who reunite at the police academy. One is an out-of-shape brainiac, the other is a dim-witted jock. But these partners make it work, and cover for each other’s shortcomings while working undercover to bust a drug ring. All in all, these unconventional cops share one hell of an outrageously immature bromance.\n\n#5 – “Rush Hour” (1998)\n\nIt’s east meets west! A Hong Kong police inspector and an LAPD detective are paired off to rescue a kidnapped girl. Jackie Chan brings the thrilling martial arts as a super cop of few words, while Chris Tucker plays the wild loudmouthed buffoon. Despite some major cultural and maturity hurdles, which are hilarious to witness, these guys grow to love each other and genuinely light up the screen!\n\n#4 – “Hot Fuzz” (2007)\n\nThis is what happens when London’s most dedicated police officer is sent to a crime-free town and assigned to work alongside the chief’s dimwitted son. Simon Pegg’s Sgt. Angel sees trouble everywhere and is unable to switch off, while Nick Frost’s Sgt. Butterman is all about taking it easy. But somehow, these opposites attract, uncover a deadly plot, and live out one hell of an action fantasy!\n\n#3 – “Beverly Hills Cop” (1984)\n\nIn this classic, Eddie Murphy plays reckless, street-wise Detroit detective Axel Foley. While in California solving the murder of his friend, he is tailed by two other officers, detective Rosewood and Sgt. Taggart, who have been assigned to keep him out of trouble. However, after several hilarious clashes, they form a memorable trio that works together to take out the trash, and have a few laughs!\n\n#2 – “Bad Boys” (1995)\n\nWhat’cha gonna do when they come for you? This Bay-tastic buddy cop film features Martin Lawrence and Will Smith as two Miami PD narcotics officers who happen to be best friends. Their deep chemistry is highlighted in every scene as they attempt to recover $100 million in stolen drugs. It’s impossible not to enjoy watching these two squabble, fight and make policing badass.\n\n#1 – “Lethal Weapon” (1987)\n\nTaking the top spot on our list is the duo that revamped everything we know and love about the genre! Mel Gibson’s Riggs takes the crazy – and in this case – suicidal partner persona to a new level, while Danny Glover’s Murtaugh is the straight-faced veteran family man who’s counting down to retirement. They may not always see eye to eye, but they always share a laugh!\n\nDo you agree with our list? Which buddy cop partnership is your favorite?
