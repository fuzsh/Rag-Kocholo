        "text": "Multiple Crew Members Hospitalized On Set Of Eddie Murphy’s Film\n\nWhile shooting Eddie Murphy’s film The Pickup, multiple crew members were injured so badly they had to be hospitalized. According to the Associated Press, several members of the crew were injured, and two were hospitalized in Atlanta, Georgia, when a truck “locked up” and crashed unexpectedly into a car.\n\nWhat Were The Injuries?\n\nAccording to the report, the injuries ranged from bruises to broken bones during Saturday’s (April 20) accident, and one person remained in the hospital on Tuesday. All are expected to make a full recovery.\n\nAmazon MGM Studios said in a statement that the scene that led to the weekend’s accident in Georgia had been rehearsed and all safety precautions were taken. Neither Murphy, 63, nor the film’s other stars, including Keke Palmer and Pete Davidson, were on the set at the time.\n\nAmazon said it was still seeking further information and is still in the process of gathering facts on what happened and why. The spokesperson said, “The well-being of the entire crew and cast is our first priority, and we will continue to insist on the highest industry standards of safety while filming.”\n\nRELATED: Eddie Murphy: Netflix Releases Trailer For ‘Beverly Hills Cop 4’\n\nThe scene was being shot by a second unit on the production, which generally shoots less central scenes not involving the director or principal actors. The studio’s statement said: “Unfortunately, the sequence did not go as planned, and several members of the crew were injured as a result.” They added that the scene was rehearsed prior and was a “completely freak accident. It wasn’t even a complicated or dangerous stunt.”\n\nThe International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, the union representing most film crew members in the US, told AP that they have begun an inquiry but could not yet provide further details.\n\nAbout Eddie Murphy’s Film\n\nThe Pickup is directed by Tim Story, whose filmography includes Barbershop, Ride Along, Taxi, and Think Like A Man. It has been shooting in and around Atlanta since February. It does not yet have a release date, but the accident is not expected to delay production.\n\nSources called The Pickup a heist comedy with Murphy playing a guy who becomes smitten with a woman and finds himself mixed up in a heist attempt.\n\nMurphy’s last roles were two back-to-back film releases in 2023: the family-friendly Christmas movie Candy Cane Lane and the cheeky, rated-R rom-com You People, starring opposite Jonah Hill.\n\nAmerica’s 50 Favorite Actors Of All Time Ranked By Positive Opinion\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
