        "text": "PRINTER FRIENDLY VIEW\n\n(inverts site colors)\n\nBuy it... if you have an established affinity for James Horner's steel drum-led thriller action scores of the 1980's, this entry offering the sound in perhaps its most mature recording quality.\n\nAvoid it... if you found little attractive about the composer's music for 48 Hrs., Commando, and Red Heat, these scores all highly redundant.\n\nEDITORIAL REVIEW\n\nFILMTRACKS TRAFFIC RANK: #2,199 WRITTEN 3/15/22\n\nHorner\n\nAnother 48 Hrs.: (James Horner) Despite extremely low studio expectations, the 1982 action comedy 48 Hrs. became such a monumental hit that it launched the \"buddy cop\" subgenre of movies and made an instant star of newcomer Eddie Murphy. While veteran action director Walter Hill and lead actor Nick Nolte had little interest in making a sequel, Murphy eventually changed their minds. In 1990's Another 48 Hrs., the roles are switched, Murphy's character the straight and legitimate law enforcement officer and Nolte the corrupt one given two days to take down a drug lord or lose his job. The hard-edged humor of the concept remains from the previous film, but the increased budget allowed for longer and more elaborate action sequences. While the movie wasn't as well received as the prior entry, it did ultimately gross more for the studio against stiff competition. The soundtrack for 48 Hrs. utilized only a marginal amount of original score, leaning heavily on source-like songs by The BusBoys, including the hit \"(The Boys Are) Back in Town\" that became famous. The songs in the sequel are less heralded, three performed by Curio of little appeal and a cover of the aforementioned \"(The Boys Are) Back in Town\" unnecessary. The director was still keen on minimizing the amount of music heard in the picture, and a fair amount of James Horner's score for Another 48 Hrs. was ultimately dialed out. The composer's work for the prior film had significantly impressed Hill, however, and the two enjoyed a robust collaboration throughout the rest of the 1980's. With the higher budget and consequently more complicated action scenes, Horner responded with a better-rounded composition for the sequel. The general demeanor remained very similar, however, all of the instrumental and stylistic techniques from 48 Hrs. carrying over. The most interesting aspect of the second score is the maturation of Horner's sound in terms of recording sophistication. Each element in the mix sound better, even if those performances aren't necessarily attractive.\n\nThe raw edge of the score for 48 Hrs. is lost with the improvements in recording quality, though the slightly wetter ambience and better distancing of instruments gives this work an advantage on album. Horner's instrumental palette for these 1980's thrillers never made much sense, especially the involvement of steel drums that sounded particularly out of place given their popular ethnic connotations. They return, along with harmonica, saxophone, drum kit, electric guitars, and a marginal orchestra that rarely uses its strings at the forefront and drops high brass in favor of trombones and tubas that typically perform lines in unison. Percussion and synthetics are better realized in Another 48 Hrs., especially in the lighter metallic tones. The one major addition for the sequel is the Japanese shakuhachi flute that the composer had become enamored with a few years earlier. By this time in Horner's career, the shakuhachi was applied all over his music, even when it made absolutely no intellectual sense. In this film, he applies it to the outlaw biker gang involved in the story, which doesn't work even when you try to squeeze in some Japanese mythos into the equation. The instrument's performances are never meant to augment tonal melodic aspects, layered mostly as a stinger device. Many of these shakuhachi stingers are totally insufferable, joined by dissonant thrashing or simply wailing on their own. Some Horner collectors will find the instrument comforting, but it cannot compete with the effectiveness of the sax performances. These contributions explore the main theme of the two films and do so here with far more elegance in the mix than had existed in 48 Hrs. Horner's themes for this concept have never been memorable, a combination of a seven-note motif and meandering sax lines representing the primary theme. Even with the additional performances here, these main themes are simply too elusive to be effective, forcing their mere tone to suffice. A descending figure to key (mostly on steel drums) was typical of the composer at the time, and its use is excessive in this score. Blurting lines from the low brass sometimes accompany this descending phrase but stand on their own at others.\n\nA new villain identity for Another 48 Hrs. exists in a full octave span on guitar and is sometimes more acoustic while elsewhere droning like a sound effect. Its use at 0:25 into \"King Mei Shootout\" (and again later in the cue) sounds like an electric guitar attempting to emulate the sound of a giant millhouse saw. It's not exactly pleasant listening. The melodic passages of the score are much improved when they are allowed to develop, from \"Main Title From Another 48 Hrs.\" to \"Diner Ambush\" and \"Backwards Drive.\" The mass of sparse thriller music is without much merit, however, and the action portions are generic extensions of similarly dated sounds from the first score. The narrative of the score for Another 48 Hrs. is particularly poor, and not just because Hill opted to rearrange or drop major portions of the work. The last third completely loses all momentum, \"Birdcage Battle\" among Horner's weakest major action cues and the final \"Killing Kehoe\" cue offering no sense of catharsis or resolution whatsoever. Ultimately, the selling point of Another 48 Hrs. for Horner collectors is that it's a more sophisticated and better sounding version of the first score. But that inspiration was pretty awful to begin with, so be careful what you wish for. On album, the Scotti Bros. label provided a sufficient commercial album in 1990 with just under 20 minutes of Horner's score in four tracks sandwiched in between songs from the film. Not all of this material matched what was heard in the movie, however, as the album was set prior to Horner's final alterations. It took until 2022 before Horner's full score was released by Intrada Records as a limited product, taking superior masters and arranging the film-oriented presentation that had been originally intended by the composer. This 47-minute experience will test your patience with its redundancies, but for concept enthusiasts, Intrada appends four alternate takes. Unlike the label's albums for 48 Hrs., the songs are not included with the sequel score on this one. Still, there can be no quibbles with Intrada's treatment of the work, even if Horner's recording doesn't offer much attraction to those without an established affinity for this mode within the composer's career. Thankfully, those ever-awkward steel drums were on the way out the door for Horner. ** @Amazon.com: CD or Download\n\nBias Check: For James Horner reviews at Filmtracks, the average editorial rating is 3.16 (in 107 reviews)\n\nand the average viewer rating is 3.23 (in 197,000 votes).
