The latest classic Eddie Murphy movie to get a reboot is 48 Hours.

The 1982 original buddy comedy was a breakout hit for then-Saturday Night Live star Murphy, who proved to be a thorn in detective Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) as a thief helping him catch two cop-killers. Watch the original trailer below:

Now, Paramount Pictures has turned to sibling filmmaking team Ben and Josh Safdie — who scored a recent hit with Robert Pattinson's Good Time — to re-envision 48 Hours for a new generation.

The directors will be working off a script from their Good Time collaborator Ronald Bronstein and comedian Jerrod Carmichael — who is best known for his critically-acclaimed NBC series and memorable appearances in Bad Neighbours and Transformers: The Last Knight.

This new 48 Hours is being backed by War for the Planet of the Apes, Red Sparrow and Snatched production company Chernin Entertainment, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

As mentioned, Eddie Murphy's signature films have been ripe for reinvention recently. Earlier in the year, Paramount inked a deal with Eddie's long-time collaborators David Sheffield and Barry W. Blaustein to work on a Coming to America sequel.

Beverly Hills Cop has at various times over the last few years spawned development on a TV spin-off or a film sequel, although neither has made the screen.

The most recent update on the proposed Beverly Hills Cop 4 came in the summer of 2016 when Belgian directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah signed on to produce Jerry Bruckheimer's long-awaited sequel.
