        "text": "Let me take you back nearly two years to explain how Dr. Dre changed my life.\n\nThere have been a lot of questions that have redirected my life over the years.\n\nBut I never would’ve dreamed that the most recent would involve the record producer.\n\nIf you’ve ever heard me rap or sing, you’d sure know why.\n\nBut Dr. Dre did start a new journey for me. For nearly 20 years I’d been interviewing the icons who’ve shaped world history for Esquire Magazine. Then, I was asked to give a speech about what I’d learned from these conversations on a cruise ship filled with 4,000 entrepreneurs: Summit at Sea.\n\nI’d never really given a long talk. There were many other speakers stepping on stage at the same time around the ship, and I figured with all that competition I might attract an audience of about 17. But, hey, it was a few days in the Caribbean, and I never turn down a hot tub.\n\nThe talk was scheduled for Happy Hour with free wine being poured. It was smartly marketed as Drinking Wine and Decoding The Art of the Interview with Mikhail Gorbachev, Robert DeNiro and Donald Trump.\n\nI’m not sure if it was the wine or the marketing, but every seat was quickly filled. Not only that, but there were CEOs and billionaires sitting cross-legged in the aisles. It was Standing Room Only to the back wall. And there was a long line of people outside the door who couldn’t get in.\n\nMy eyes widened and I felt my heartbeat accelerate when I looked at the expectant crowd.\n\nSheeyit . . . What am I gonna do now?\n\nI started to speak. When I was done, the crowd burst to its feet in applause. That was a little stunning. But the real surprise for me came afterward, when a long line of people formed to ask me questions about the way I ask questions.\n\nThese were people who owned or ran businesses — and they all had a problem. They felt they weren’t hiring the best people, and they feared it was because they weren’t interviewing as well as they should.\n\nTwo business owners stepped up and vented their frustrations. “We’re really passionate,” they said. “And we can’t seem to hire people who are as passionate about what we do as we are. Do you know what questions we can ask?”\n\n“Sure,” I said, “Tell ’em the Dr. Dre story.”\n\n“The Dr. Dre story?”\n\n“Yeah, when I was interviewing Dr. Dre, I asked him what was the longest he’d ever gone working on a project without sleep.\n\n“ ‘Oh, man,’ ” Dre said, “ ‘when I’m in the zone, I can go 79 hours without sleep. I don’t want to miss anything. I don’t even know sleep exists until we’re done.’ ”\n\nThe application was very clear to me. “Just tell the candidate the Dr. Dre story,” I said. “Then ask this question: ‘What’s the longest you’ve ever gone without sleep to finish a project you were passionate about?’ ”\n\nThere’s no right answer or wrong answer. But the answer could sure lead to the right hire.\n\nThe two business owners looked at each other, then at me, then back at each other. Good idea!\n\nI was soon asked by a company to give a workshop on interviewing for hiring. Other companies and conferences began to book me to speak about the power of questions, about making deep connections quickly through conversation to improve sales, and about storytelling for marketing.\n\nThe chain reaction set off by Dr. Dre is the reason I’ll be speaking at USC on Thursday to Krista Parkinson’s class about getting into the entertainment industry. Krista is renowned for her blog: My Grads Get Jobs.\n\nIf there’s one word that I’d like to resonate with the students in Krista’s class it would be passion.\n\nAs the chef Mario Batali once told me, “I can tell in two minutes if I should hire someone in the kitchen. Two minutes. It’s his (her) desire. It’s that open-eyed, attentive expression. If he (she) doesn’t have it . . . I mean, I can teach a chimp how to cook dinner. But I cannot teach a chimp how to love it.”\n\nSelf-awareness of your passion helps you while seeking a job in two very distinct ways. It will attract an employer. But it can also stop you from seeking a job that you’re really not interested in. This may seem obvious. But when you get into deep conversations with people who’ve been in the workforce for a while, you quickly find out how many of them aren’t truly happy in what they’re doing.\n\nKnowing your passion is like seeing the North Star on a clear night. You can go on many different journeys throughout your life. But the North Star is always there to point to the right direction.\n\nI know this from years of experience. When I step out in front of Krista’s class, I’ll do so with the same exuberance I had when I graduated from college and headed off for my first job as a writer for The Miami Herald. That was a long time ago.\n\nThere have been many journeys since. So a huge thanks to Dr. Dre for setting me off on this next one with passion, and an even greater sense of purpose to help others.\n\nSee you next week.\n\nCal"
