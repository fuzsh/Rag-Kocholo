        "text": "I still can’t believe this album actually exists. If you have just started listening to Hip Hop like three hours ago and you don’t know the history behind this album allow me to explain. Dr. Dre is arguably the greatest producer of all time. He has been behind countless hits and is one of the most important and influential figures in music history. He helped the careers of everyone in NWA, Snoop Dogg, Kurupt, Xzibit, EMINƎM, Kendrick Lamar & a fuck load of others. His first two solo albums are considered to be classics by most. We have been waiting for over a decade and a half for an album by Dr. Dre called Detox. Sixteen fucking years. We waited sixteen fucking years for a Dr. Dre album called Detox. Guess what? Out of nowhere… Well, actually it wasn’t really out of nowhere, but it was still somewhat of a surprise. About one week before this album dropped Dr. Dre was just like “Hey guys. Detox is cancelled because it’s wack af. I hope you enjoy the new NWA movie. Oh by the way I’m droppin’ my album in a week. Alright, peace.” What the fuck? I cannot believe this shit. I’m glad we got a new album, but… Detox is done? For real? Just like that? Fuck. He said it was wack. I’d still kinda like to hear it. At first I was thinkin’ that Compton might just be Detox with a different name, but that’s apparently not true. This is the soundtrack to the new NWA movie. I’m not sure if I’m gonna see that movie. I kinda want to see it, but I have a low attention span. I can’t really get into movies. This will be the first Marathon that I actually finish. Who would’ve thought the first COMPLETE discography that I reviewed would be that of Dr. Dre. I just can’t believe this happened. This has been an unrealistically good year for Hip Hop. Okay. Let’s go ahead and listen to Dr. Dre’s third and final solo album, Compton.\n\nTrack 1: Intro (Co-Prod. Focus…)\n\nThis sounds like the music they play at the beginning of a movie where they show the name of the studio that made it. Kinda similar to the intro of 2001. This is just what sounds like some white guy giving a short historical description of Compton. “White’s don’t buy houses in Compton anymore.” This kinda sounds like a news report. Kinda. I guess there isn’t really any actual news here. This isn’t a song, so I’m not gonna give it a rating. It does it’s job tho.\n\nTrack 2: Talk About It Feat. King Mez & Justus (Co-Prod. DJ Dahi)\n\nWow. Dr. Dre & DJ fucking Dahi on the same track? This is a dream collab right here. I haven’t heard any of King Mez’s music before, but I know that he’s from North Carolina and he’s been cool with Dre for a minute. The only thing I know about Justus is that he signed with Aftermath early this year. Woah. This is weird… This sounds like it has a very heavy trap inspiration. It’s kinda hard, but I don’t know. This is a weird way to start the album off. This is a dope ass beat tho. King Mez is… “Rapping” I guess. He’s just yelling. He sounds like Young Thug with a much less annoying voice. Why is he yelling like that? Is this a joke? The beat’s dope af, but… This just isn’t really what I expected. The hook is dope af. To be honest it kinda sounds like some Drake shit. That’s Justus tho. “Ima have everything.” This hook is nice. The way the beat switched up to this airy production for the hook was a little jarring, but you get used to it. What the FUCK? Now Dre is yelling with that stereotypical Trap inspired delivery & flow. What the hell… Goddamn… This is so fucking dope. It really just isn’t what I expected. I am enjoying this, but I’m just so confused. I hope the whole album doesn’t have this sound. I don’t expect it to sound like fuckin’ Nuthin’ But A ‘G’ Thang, but I didn’t expect it to sound like Travi$ Scott either. Thankfully his bars aren’t on the level of Travi$ Scott. “I was getting money ‘fore the internet / Still got EMINƎM checks I ain’t opened yet.” I can’t explain why I’m so shocked by this. This is like if Tupac came back and sounded like YG, ya know? It’s still gangsta as fuck and the music is very enjoyable… But it really isn’t what you wanted. Dre did his thing tho. He had some really dope lines in there. He even made fun of himself for being old. I wasn’t sold on King Mez at first, but his second verse is pretty goddamn dope. He dissed Drake so hard on this shit (It’s a fucking joke; I know he’s not actually dissing Drake). “Ain’t no new rap in my ear, too many depressed niggas / Emotional every song, deserve to have breast niggas / Crying bout my old girl, funny how I left niggas / Trying to get my ex box, Red Ring of Death niggas.” I definitely fuck with this song, but if the whole album is like this tho… I will be fucking LIVID. I don’t know if it was the best way to start the album off, but either way it’s dope to me. 4/5\n\nTrack 3: Genocide Feat. Kendrick Lamar, Marsha Ambrosius & Candice Pillay (Co-Prod. Dem Jointz)\n\nKendrick Lamar. Dr. Dre. I’m so fuckin’ ready for this song. I’m not familiar with Candice Pillay. God. Damn. This fucking beat is fucking incredible. Yooo. This shit is so good I didn’t even do the Cosby face. My eyes just bugged out of my face.\n\nThat’s what I looked like when this fucking beat came on. This beat is absolutely fucking incredible. I can’t believe it. Goddamn. Fuuuck. This shit… Alright Marsha Ambrosius is reciting the hook. Wow. She’s not even singing. This is fucking great. Oh my fuck. She sounds so fuckin’ awesome on this shit. I’m so fucking happy right now. This is more like it. Candice Pillay is on the first verse. I don’t know where she’s from, but it sounds like she’s tryna do a reggae verse. It sounds really fuckin’ cool over this beat. Yes. This is so fuckin’ dope. She’s talkin’ a lot about her “daddy” who is killing everyone. I’m probably reaching for things that don’t exist here, but what if her “daddy” is her pimp? …Yeah I’m probably reaching. This isn’t a Lupe Fiasco verse after all. It’s still dope tho. Goddamn. This fucking beat. This motherfucker Andre just made me do the fucking bug eyes AGAIN. I don’t even know what fucking instrument that is. It sounds like a piano with a bunch of reverb on it. It comes in when Marsha does the hook for the second time. It’s fucking amazing. Dr. Dre’s goin’ in now. His delivery is fucking great. He sounds younger on this shit than he did on the fuckin’ Chronic. Speaking of The Chronic, he had a dope reference to Let Me Ride on his verse. “I’m very aware Hip Hop needed somethin’ to carry it, so I married that bitch and swung down in that chariot.” This is so fuckin’ hard. This is fucking amazing. Dr. Dre’s verse was so fucking dope. I don’t even know why, but hearing Dre rap like this is making me so motherfucking happy right now. Aaaaaah shit… Kendrick’s finna go in now. Yes. He fucking killed that shit. “My discretion, fuck your blessing, fuck your life / Fuck your hope, fuck your mama / Fuck your daddy, fuck your dead homie / Fuck the world up when we came up, that’s Compton homie.” You can really tell that being on this album was important to him. You can tell just from his delivery. A lot of people might disagree with this, but as far as his delivery goes he kinda sounds like an early Snoop Dogg mixed with early EMINƎM to me. “Our stadium’s packed, raiders in black / Curls drippin’, silver bullet, palladium in my strap / I lie on the side of a one way street / Nowhere to go, death all I can see.” This is so fuckin’ dope, man. This song actually reminds me of The Purge by ScHoolboy Q, except the beat & hook are less shitty. This outro is smooth as hell too. I cannot believe this shit. This is fucking incredible. I definitely fuck with this. This shit right here is fucking dope af. 5/5\n\nTrack 4: It’s All On Me Feat. Justus & BJ The Chicago Kid (Co-Prod. Bink)\n\nGoddamn, they got BJ on this bitch? Fuck, man. This beat is smooth as fuck. Dr. Dre spits a few bars at the beginning of the song and then BJ comes in for the hook. This is so motherfucking smooth. This is a fucking song. That probably doesn’t mean shit to y’all, but this feels like a fucking piece of art. For real, people say that shit about Kanye’s shit, but Kanye is nothing compared to this. This is fuckin’… This just feels right. It feels complete. There is nothing that they could’ve added to this shit. This hook is fucking great. Goddamn. This fucking song. This is smoother than a motherfucker, and Dr. Dre’s doing his fuckin’ thing too. He’s talkin’ about his life and he’s mentioning everything. I guess that makes sense since this is for the NWA movie, but goddamn. This is just so fucking great. “This one of those dreams you don’t wake up from / Then again, you don’t sleep if you come from where I come from.” This is so fuckin’ Compton. The beat is so fucking smooth. BJ did an amazing ass job with that hook too. It’s so fucking smooth. Dr. Dre’s verses were actually were pretty dope. They could’ve been better, but they weren’t bad. That part in the first verse where he said “yeeaaaaaaaaah” kinda reminded me of Young Thug. I don’t know what the fuck he thought he was doing there… I definitely fuck with this song tho. It’s dope. 4/5\n\nTrack 5: All In A Day’s Work Feat. Anderson .Paak & Marsha Ambrosius (Co-Prod. DJ Dahi & DJ Khalil)\n\nOh my God. DJ Dahi, DJ Khalil & Dr. Dre all on one fucking song. This is like a dream come true. I don’t know who this Anderson .Paak guy is, but I’m sure he isn’t bad. Oh my fuck… This beat is just crazy. I don’t even know what to say anymore. What else can I say? What can I say about this production that I haven’t said about any other beat on this album so far. Do I even need to keep telling you that the production is fucking immaculate? It fucking is. This Anderson .Paak guy is going in first. He’s kinda singin’. He has a really interesting voice. It sounds so fucking good tho. He sounds so fucking smooth on this motherfucker. How the fuck… This shit is so smooth. Yoooo. This fucking shit right here is so motherfucking smooth I cannot even believe it. This is some of the smoothest shit I have ever heard in my life. Anderson .Paak’s delivery is fucking perfect. Y’all know how when Jadakiss & Styles P rap together they sorta finish each other’s bars? That’s what .Paak & Dre are doing right now. It’s fantastic. This is so fucking good. Dr. Dre sounds great over this shit. He sounds gangsta as hell and his flow is dope too. Oh my GOD. I cannot believe this shit. Fuck. This hook is great. This beat is fucking crazy. This shit right here is fucking amazing. God damnit. I do not believe this. I fucking love this shit. Anderson .Paak kinda stole the show, but this is still fantastic. This shit right here is dope as fuck. 5/5\n\nTrack 6: Darkside / Gone Feat. King Mez, Marsha Ambrosius & Kendrick Lamar (Co-Prod. Best Kept Secret)\n\nFuck yes. Kendrick fucking Lamar and Dr. Dre. You cannot fucking go wrong with Kendrick Lamar & Dr. Dre. Mez is goin’ in right now. Oh my FUCK, man. His fucking delivery on this shit is perfect. He has kind of a melodic flow and I think that’s autotune, but he uses it so perfectly that it still sounds natural. He doesn’t overdo it like T-Pain or Future. His flow is great too. Okay, Dre is going in now. He sounds pretty fucking good on this shit. Damn. Darkside just ended. It’s only about one minute and thirty seconds long. It’s so fucking good. It ends with a few words from Eazy-E. Goddamn. Okay, Gone is starting now. Marsha Ambrosius is singing her motherfucking ass off on this hook. Oh… Oh my…\n\nThis fucking piano. The fucking piano on this bitch… I’m sorry for cussing so much, but GODDAMN. Seriously the production is fucking impeccable. I guess this is really the first beat on here that really sounds like Dre tho. It has the piano. The other beats (not Genocide tho) just sound like super incredible beats that could show up on anyone elses project. Genocide is really the only one that sounded that creative. This one too tho. Oh my goodness. I do not believe this fucking shit right here. Okay Kendrick is going in now. “You scared of my heights now, but still I got enemies giving me energy / I don’t wanna fight now / Subliminally sent to me all of this hate / I thought I was holding the mic down.” Okay, y’all might’ve heard about this line in the news recently. A lot of people are saying that this is a diss towards Drake since it’s very reminiscent of that song Energy that Drake made. I don’t know if it is, but I really hope it is to be honest. I want an MC that doesn’t suck to go at Drake. Someone on RapGenius also pointed out that Darkside is an anagram for “Drakedis.” I don’t know if I believe this shit, but I really wouldn’t put it passed Kendrick. I don’t know if Dre would choose to be a part of that. I’m just gonna tell myself that it isn’t a Drake diss just so I’m not disappointed in the future. I’m not gonna believe anything until Kendrick says Drake’s name. Anyway, Kendrick fucking murdered this shit. This fucking song is great. Kendrick fucking snapped on this shit. “With or without all the diamonds though to you I’m just another nigga.” Yes. This is fucking incredible. I definitely fuck with this shit right here. This shit is dope af. 5/5\n\nTrack 7: Loose Cannons Feat. Xzibit & Cold 187um (Co-Prod. Focus…)\n\nXzibit? Oh my Lord. Fucking Xzibit is on this shit. I’m so fucking happy. Dr. Dre you have made me so fucking happy. Thank you. Thank you for existing, Dr. Dre. Fucking Xzibit is on this shit. I don’t believe it. Oh my Lord. This fucking beat is huge. This beat sounds gigantic. This sounds just as triumphant as a Just Blaze beat. This is fucking crazy tho. I don’t believe this fucking shit. I cannot believe it. This beat… It’s like every fucking beat is better than the last. This shit just keeps getting better and better. Dr. fucking Dre. Dr. Dre went in on that first verse. His flow & delivery were perfect. This shit… FUCK, man. I need to calm down. I need to do some fuckin’ yoga or something. This fucking music is so amazing. Oh my FUCKKKKKK. The fucking beat just switched up. I’m about to have a fucking heart attack. The fucking beat just switched up. This shit… Oh my fucking… I don’t even know what to say anymore. The fucking beat just got so fucking hard and Cold 187um came outta nowhere. This is amazing. X just came outta nowhere and the beat switched up a third time. Eh. I don’t really like this third beat as much, and the transition was a little abrupt. “I’m just over here cozy holdin’ these double D’s / She book smart with pornographic abilities.” Xzibit did a pretty good job. Then Sly Pyper comes through on the last verse. This outro reminds me of some MMLP shit too. I honestly wasn’t really feelin’ the outro. It was just awkward to listen to. It doesn’t really work for an actual song. I still really like this song tho. It’s dope. 4/5\n\nTrack 8: Issues Feat. Ice Cube, Anderson .Paak & Dem Jointz (Co-Prod. Focus…)\n\nNo way. No fucking way. I don’t believe this fucking shit. I don’t believe it. Ice. Fucking. Cube. Ice Cube is rapping on a fucking song in 2015. I do not believe this. What if every song on here after Loose Cannons was fucking horrible? That would ruin my fucking life. Just kidding, but can you imagine? Alright, lemme quit dickin’ around and start the song. Okay, Anderson .Paak is spittin’ on the intro. This beat is cool I guess. It’s definitely not as amazing as the others. Alright, Cube is goin’ in. “Think I’m quiet cause I’m actin’, but my bank account gon’ say ‘Fuck you!’ / Respected from SoCal out to the Bay / Cashed a lot of checks this mornin’, guess today was a good day.” Hearing Ice Cube fucking rapping just made my fucking day. It’s not an amazing verse or anything, but it was just great to hear him rap again. It is so fucking hot in my room right now. Dem Jointz is on the hook and it’s actually pretty fuckin’ dope. I still can’t believe Ice Cube was really rapping tho… Fuck, man. That was amazing. Okay, Dre is going in now. “My city crazy, school girls used to play with that chalk / Same chalk police used to outline niggas we lost.” This is dope. “I’m just havin’ some fuckin’ fun with this rap shit / Nigga with an attitude, still gettin’ active / Man this industry to me, it feels a little plastic / I ain’t heard nothin’ that I can consider classic.” This song is dope. I definitely fuck with this shit. 4/5\n\nTrack 9: Deep Water Feat. Kendrick Lamar, Anderson .Paak & Justus (Co-Prod. Cardiak, DJ Dahi, Dem Jointz & Focus…)\n\nThis Justus guy is fucking dope af. I need to check this guy out. Well, actually… I probably will never check him out unless he works with more rappers that I like… The shit he’s done on this album is fucking great tho. Alright lemme go ahead and start this song. It opens up with the sound of Anderson .Paak drowning and screaming “help me.” There’s a chick talking, but I was distracted by .Paak. This fucking beat is… Well, you know… It’s dope af. This hook from Justus is dope. I’m not in love with the way they have the beat go off and that guy yelling “COMPTON!” mixed in. It just sounds kinda choppy. Justus’ part was dope tho. Dr. Dre is going the fuck in. Anderson .Paak spit a few bars during an interlude and now Kendrick is about to go in. Goddamn. Kendrick went the fuck off on that shit. He said some shit about how he started from the bottom. Again, I’m not gonna think anything of it until he says the name. Okay, .Paak is drowning again. This fucking production is incredible. Dre & Kendrick both killed this shit. Yes. I fuck with this song. Anderson .Paak’s screaming got kind of annoying after a while, but other than that this shit is dope af. Oh yeah, the hook too… Still, it’s dope af. 5/5\n\nTrack 10: One Shot One Kill Feat. Jon Connor & Snoop Dogg (Co-Prod. Focus…)\n\nWow. I almost forgot about Jon Connor. Where the fuck has this motherfucker been? I haven’t heard about him since he was on that XXL Freshman cover and he released that song Take Off (that song is fucking dope af). I’m glad I finally get to hear from him again. Oh I almost forgot; he was on that Statik Selektah album. That was dope af too. Alright, it’s starting now. Hahaha. This actually sounds like the music that plays during the first action scene in a movie. This beat is dope. What… What the… Fuck? Is that Snoop? Is that SNOOP fucking DOGG? He’s rapping. I mean he’s actually rapping for real. This motherfucker is actually going the fuck in like he’s serious about this shit. “Guess who’s back, it ain’t a fuckin’ question / They know the name, bow in the presence of a living legend.” Well, I guess if he was gonna get serious it would be on a Dr. Dre album, but this… This is fucking incredible. I do not believe this shit. I cannot fucking believe this shit. This motherfucker is going the fuck in. He sounds like a fucking monster on this shit. This fucking shit right here… Snoop actually killed a verse. Snoop Dogg killed a rap verse. Well… He did that on the Raekwon album, but… He REALLY did it here. The hook is cool I guess. “You are now not in the presence of nice guys.” Okay, Jon Connor is about to go in now. Goddamn. This fucking shit… Jon Connor fucking killed this shit. Goddamn. Whatever my mama’s cookin’ smells fuckin’ delicious. Anyway, this shit right here is absolutely dope af. Jon Connor fucking killed this shit. Dr. Dre didn’t have a verse he just handled the production. Bars. That’s what this shit is. Bars. From fucking Snoop Dogg tho? Snoop Dogg? I cannot believe this shit. Snoop Dogg actually ripped the fuckin’ verse to shreds. I cannot believe it. The beat wasn’t amazing and the hook could’ve been better, but both MC’s killed it. This is dope. 4/5\n\nTrack 11: Just Another Day Feat. The Game & Asia Bryant (Co-Prod. Neff-U)\n\nOkay, The Game… I definitely fuck with The Game (he was actually one of my favorite rappers at one point), but I just feel like he never really reaches his full potential. I know that sounds like some Dragon Ball Z shit, but I’m serious. He can fucking rap, but his songs just… The shit he chooses to rap about just doesn’t work for me a lot of the time. Hopefully he fucking murders this shit. I know he can, and I don’t think Dr. Dre would let anything else happen. I fuck with Game. I’m sure this will be dope af. It better be… He better not fuck up The Documentary 2 either. I’m actually excited for that shit, but the singles aren’t really giving me a lot of confidence… “IT’S MOTHERFUCKIN’ GAME TIME.” That was kinda corny… Ah shit. This motherfucking BEAT.\n\nAlright he’s goin’ in now. Damn. This motherfucker is a monster… He is fucking ripping this shit apart. “My city a trap me; been shot, robbed, stabbed, chased home, socked out / Jabbed by esse’s, cops, degenerate niggas with rags / Disintegrate niggas went into me, dome shots like Kennedy.” This motherfucker is just goin’ the fuck in on this shit… “Scarface, car chase, tell me how your blood taste / Ask your baby mama, she’ll tell you how a Blood taste.” Damn. I don’t even know what to say. The Game fucking destroyed this shit. About halfway through his verse he takes some steroids and his flow takes off like Lance Armstrong. This shit is crazy. Asia Bryant was singin’ like a motherfucker on that outro too. I definitely fuck with this. This shit is dope af. 5/5\n\nTrack 12: For The Love Of Money Feat. Jill Scott, Jon Connor & Anderson .Paak (Co-Prod. Cardiak)\n\nOkay. Jill Scott. How famous is she? Is she considered a legend? She’s worked with a shit load of rappers. I’m not really familiar with her as an artist tho. I only ever hear her on features. I’m just gonna go ahead and assume she’s a legend. She must be really well respected since she’s always working with dope rappers. Good lord. This beat. Dr. Dre. I do not believe this shit. This fucking beat. Oh my God. The fucking beat… These vocals are fucking angelic. Is that Jill Scott? Damn. Jon Connor’s goin’ the fuck in now. Jesus Christ. Jon Connor went the fuck off. Jill Scott’s voice is fucking amazing over this shit too. Dr. Dre’s goin in now. Anderson .Paak sounds so motherfucking smooth on this shit too. This is so fucking great. Good God. This fucking beat. It’s so fucking incredible. The outro… The beat is… I fuck with this. I don’t… I fuck with this shit man. This shit is fucking incredible. Jill Scott’s vocals were perfect, and Jon Connor went the fuck off. I honestly wasn’t really feelin’ Dre’s verse. It was kinda lame to me. Well, I really only disliked the last four bars… “Damn, look at that body / She come along with the territories / Turn around; move it for me / Bend it over; end of story.” Nah. Cardiak did a good ass job with that beat tho. This is dope af. 5/5\n\nTrack 13: Satisfiction Feat. Snoop Dogg, Marsha Ambrosius & King Mez (Co-Prod. Dem Jointz)\n\nI still can’t believe how good Snoop’s verse was on that Jon Connor song. Goodness. That shit… If he spits half as hard as that on this fucking track I will be amazed. I’m so happy right now. Snoop fucking Dogg really went the fuck off… Please do it again. Goddamn. This beat is dope. It sounds like it could’ve been on Snoop’s latest album. It’s honestly kinda annoying. The vocal sample in the background is just… I don’t know. It’s too high pitched or something. It just gets annoying after a while. Marsha did her thing on this hook tho. Dr. Dre did his thing and now King Mez is goin’ in. They’re rappin’ about motherfuckers who be frontin’ like they own everything. “Why your name always in these rental records / Spendin’ rent money gettin’ that bottle service into your section / You leased your car, leased your house, leased your spouse / Know she leavin’ if you run outta paper and might be smashin’ your neighbor.” Alright Snoop’s finna go in. “These labels always ask me to do a song with these niggas.” I guess that explains the songs that Snoop did with Katy Perry and fucking Psy. Snoop went the fuck in. I can’t believe he’s really rapping for real. He sounds like he cares. I don’t believe this shit. I fuck with this song. The beat was annoying, but it didn’t completely ruin the song. I still enjoyed it. This shit is dope. 4/5\n\nTrack 14: Animals Feat. Anderson .Paak (Co-Prod. DJ Premier & BMB Spacekid)\n\nWait a minute… WHAT???? DJ fucking Premier did a song with Dr. Dre? Are you fucking shitting me? I do not believe you. I do not fucking believe any of this shit… Dr. Dre & DJ Premier. I cannot believe it. I cannot fucking believe this shit. Alright… I need to fucking hear this shit. It’s starting… Oh my God… Production. This is fucking production. Anderson .Paak is goin’ in right now. Oh my goodness. Animals. This song is about stereotypes. This song is about the way black people are viewed… “Please don’t come around these parts and tell me that we all a bunch of animals / The only time they wanna turn the cameras on is when we’re fuckin’ shit up.” This fucking shit right here. Dr. Dre is going in now. “Not all of us criminals, but cops be yelling ‘stay back nigga!’ / We need a little bit of payback / Don’t treat me like an animal ’cause all this shit is flammable / Don’t fuck around ’cause when it’s done it’s done / Fuck you.” This fucking song. I don’t even know what to say. “And the white folks tell me all the looting and the shooting’s insane, but you don’t know our pain.” I fucking love this song. This is fucking incredible. Dre’s verse wasn’t amazing, but it was cool. The fucking scratches from Primo at the end… This is fucking dope af. I absolutely fuck with this shit. 5/5\n\nTrack 15: Medicine Man Feat. EMINƎM, Candice Pillay & Anderson .Paak (Co-Prod. Dem Jointz & Focus…)\n\nWow. I’m actually surprised that this is the only song with EMINƎM on this motherfucker. I’m not really complaining to be honest. I’m not the biggest EMINƎM fan. We all know he can rap, but his recent shit has been pure dog shit and that’s putting it lightly. You know he did a song with Gwen Stefani? Why does that exist? Who the fuck thought that was a good idea? Who wanted that shit? Who wanted to hear a song with EMINƎM & Gwen Stefani? Nah. Fuck that shit. Hopefully he doesn’t fuck shit up here. If Snoop Dogg can come back for this album, then EMINƎM can too. Alright. It’s starting now. Damn. Candice Pillay is singin’ like a motherfucker. She did a great ass job with this hook. “Doctor’s orders: go fuck yourself / Take two of these in the morning, overdose and kill yourself.” HAHAHAHAHA! That’s so fucking dope, man. That’s definitely one of the best hooks on this shit. Dr. Dre is going the fuck in on this shit too. His fucking flow is great. This fucking beat sounds like some triumphant Disney shit. Whoever made the Kingdom Hearts music must’ve been involved in the creation of this beat because it’s that fucking good. Dr. Dre is straight shitting on this generation of mainstream Hip Hop. “This is my evaluation / This shit over saturated / Y’all can get evacuated / Kids sipping Actavis and they ain’t even activated.” DAMN! He just dissed the fuck outta Tyga & Kylie Jenner too! “Girls be thirteen acting twenty-two / Niggas be forty-four acting half they ages / Somebody tell me, what the fuck is going on?” This shit is fucking incredible. It sounds fucking gigantic. This production is immaculate. Oh fucking shit. The beat switched up and EMINƎM is goin’ in now. Oh fucking shit. OH MY FUCK! THIS FUCKING BASS. WHEN EMINƎM GETS SERIOUS, AND THE FUCKIN’ BASS COMES IN. OOOOOOOOOH. When the bass came in I yelled and my sister said “It’s not THAT good.” It fucking is tho. This fucking shit is incredible. I cannot befuckinglieve this shit. EMINƎM‘S FUCKING FLOW OH MY GOD. WHAT THE FUCK? HAHAHAHA I’M SO FUCKING HAPPY. I cannot believe this shit. EMINƎM fucking destroyed this shit. I never thought I would say this shit, but EMINƎM had one of the greatest fucking verses on this whole fucking album. EMINƎM. I don’t even really like this motherfucker, but this verse is undeniable. EMINƎM fucking ripped this shit to shreds. This song is definitely dope af. I fuck with this. 5/5\n\nTrack 16: Talking To My Diary (Co-Prod. DJ Silk & Mista Choc)\n\nI cannot believe this shit even exists. I can’t believe I can even be writing this shit right now. Dr. Fucking Dre. Alright, fuck it. Lemme just go ahead and finish this shit. Okay this beat is fucking incredible. This shit… The… Yes. This beat is exactly how it should be. What the fuck is there to say? Dr. Dre went the fuck in. This is the perfect song to end his career. The bridge to this song is obviously inspired by Nate Dogg. “It gets the hardest when I think about the dearly departed / Like the nigga I started with / I know Eazy can see me now, looking down through the clouds and regardless, I know my nigga still proud.” Dre pretty much does his best Nate Dogg impression. It’s really great to hear him talkin’ about Eazy-E too. “Now I remember when we used to do all-nighters / You in the booth and Cube in the corner writing / Where Ren at? Shout out to my nigga Yella / Damn, I miss that… Shit, a nigga having flashbacks.” I don’t know how anyone could disagree that this shit is dope af. The fucking trumpet outro is immaculate too. It’s crazy to think that this is probably the last Dr. Dre song ever. Fuck. Well, it’s probably the best possible way to end this shit. This is fucking incredible. 5/5\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nI do not believe this shit. I know I’ve already said it like a million times, but… I just cannot believe it. I’m fucking speechless. There are no words. I don’t know what to say. I still do not believe this shit. The production on this shit is fucking immaculate. How is this… Is this shit even real? This is like a dream come true. How is it even possible that Dr. Dre released a NEW album with Kendrick Lamar, Jon Connor, EMINƎM, Ice Cube, Xzibit, The Game, Jill Scott, DJ Premier, Snoop Dogg, DJ Dahi & fucking DJ Khalil? Disbelief. Pure disbelief. I wonder why Kurupt isn’t on here. Does he have a problem with Dre or something? Maybe Dre couldn’t get a good verse outta him. Either way, this album is amazing. There is no fucking way that Kanye West can compete with Kendrick Lamar or Dr. Dre. Dr. Dre fucking worked his ass off. You can tell that everyone involved with this project was ecstatic to be a part of this. He didn’t only work with established legends like Ice Cube & EMINƎM, but he did shit with fucking King Mez & Anderson .Paak (who the fuck?). He really cares about Hip Hop. He doesn’t care who you are. He just needs dope artists to work with. It doesn’t matter how famous you are, or how much money you have. All Dre needs is talent. That’s what makes this shit incredible. This is one of the first times that a legendary Hip Hop artist has had a proper ending to his career instead of just passing away. This is one of the first times that I can say that a Hip Hop artist’s discography is legitimately complete. It’s over. I cannot believe it. I still do not believe it. This man has done so much for Hip Hop and now it’s actually over. I wasn’t so sure about it before, but now I need to see Straight Outta Compton. This album is dope af.\n\nFavorite Song: All In A Day’s Work\n\nLeast Favorite Song: Loose Cannons\n\nVerdict:\n\n92%\n\nTell me if I’m trippin’ in the comments below\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, share it on Twitter & Facebook\n\nWatch the videos below for more thoughts on the album"
