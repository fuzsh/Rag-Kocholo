        "text": "Music icons Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine have stepped up to support Compton residents during the coronavirus pandemic with a donation that will fund meals, medical testing and supplies.\n\nThe donation will provide more than 145,000 free meals for residents in need as well as pay for coronavirus tests, the city announced Thursday, April 23.\n\n“Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine have always been great advocates and supporters of the City of Compton,” Compton Mayor Aja Brown said in a statement. “Increasing access to food and vital healthcare are some of the most important ways we can make an impact for our community in this time of need.”\n\nThere have been 156 confirmed cases of Compton residents testing positive for COVID-19, according to the city officials.\n\n“As issues like unemployment, food insecurity and lack of COVID-19 testing sweep the nation, I hope that this contribution will inspire others to take action, get involved and support their neighborhoods in any way they can,” Brown said in a statement. “Even in a time of social distancing, this contribution is a strong testament to how we can still come together to support the communities we love.”\n\nRap legend Dre is a respected music performer, producer, writer, arranger and executive, as well as a founding member of N.W.A. Iovine is a renowned music executive and entrepreneur who co-founded Interscope Records.\n\nBoth Dre, born and raised in Compton, and Iovine have a long history of contributing to the community. In 2015, Dre announced that the he would donate the proceeds from his first album in 16 years, “Compton: A Soundtrack,” to build a performing arts center at the Compton High. He donated $10 million in 2017 and the center is set to break ground this year.\n\n“Dr. Dre is a gamechanger, a constant source of support for our community seen and unseen. He’s always there for our community, each and every time I call and for that I am eternally thankful,” Brown said. “Whether he’s donating behind the scenes to ensure that Compton treasures like the Compton Cowboys’ Jr. Equestrian Center remain intact during this crisis or funding a state of the art youth performing arts center, Dr. Dre is a champion for our city.”"
