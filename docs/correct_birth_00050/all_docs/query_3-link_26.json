        "text": "Dr. Dre has often been called the greatest producer in the history of rap and is considered partly responsible for popularizing the West Coast sound and “Gangsta rap.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe has produced some of the most recognizable songs in the history of music and elevated the careers of some of the greatest and most successful rappers of all time including Snoop Dogg, Eminem, 50 Cent, and Kendrick Lamar.\n\nHere is the evolution of Dr. Dre.\n\nIn 1987, Dr. Dre along with Eazy-E, Ice Cube, MC Ren, DJ Yella, and Arabian Prince formed the group N.W.A, which stands for “Niggaz Wit Attitudez,” under Ruthless Records. Their first album, Straight Outta Compton, became a major success despite not being played on the radio because of its lyrics. The group popularized gangsta rap and often rapped about violence in the inner city and police brutality.\n\nDr. Dre left the group in 1991 after problems with Eazy-E and founded Death Row Records along with Suge Knight. A year later, Dre released his first single since leaving N.W.A. It was the title track for the movie Deep Cover and introduced rapper Snoop Dogg. Dr. Dre’s debut solo album The Chronic, was the first album released under Death Row and heavily featured Snoop Dogg, turning him into a star. The Chronic is considered one of the best rap albums of all time and is credited with introducing a new style of rap called West Coast G-funk.\n\nBecause of his work with Dr. Dre on The Chronic, the anticipation for Snoop Dogg’s solo release was at an all-time high, and with the production of Dr. Dre and Daz Dillinger, Snoop released his debut album Doggystyle, which is also considered one of the best rap albums of all time.\n\nThe album that never was. For a LONG time, it was rumored that Dr. Dre would be releasing his third and final studio album Detox. It was rumored to feature hip-hop heavyweights and producing legends all over the album. For years, artists would say it’s done but because of producing other artists’ work, the album never came out.\n\nFounded by Dr.Dre and frequent business partner Jimmy Iovine in 2006, the two founded Beats Electronics LLC, better known as Beats By Dre. The company focuses on manufacturing and selling headphones and speakers. The headphones became not only a good way for you to listen to your music but also a fashion statement. NBA superstar LeBron James became an investor in the company.\n\nBeats by Dre was acquired by Apple in 2014 for $3 billion dollars in a cash and stock deal, making it the biggest Apple acquisition in its history. The deal was rumored to make Dre hip-hop’s first billionaire. The deal was prematurely leaked in a YouTube video by Tyrese Gibson where Gibson and Dre were celebrating and making multiple comments about Apple buying the company. In the video, you can hear Dre saying, “the first billionaire in hip-hop.”"
