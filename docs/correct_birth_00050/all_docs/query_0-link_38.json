        "text": "COMPTON, Calif. (KABC) -- A performing arts center at Compton High School that's being built with the help of music mogul Dr. Dre is one step closer to becoming a reality.\n\nThe Compton native - who donated $10 million to the project - joined city and school leaders for a groundbreaking ceremony to celebrate the first step in getting the center up and running.\n\nThe facility will include a 1,200-seat theater and will be a place for young people to be creative in a way that will help further their education and positively define their future.\n\n\"When I was approached about funding a performing arts center that would provide an arts and technological education to students and be accessible for the community at large, I was all in,\" said Dr. Dre. \"I wanted to give the young people of Compton something I never had.\"\n\nDr. Dre - born Andre Young - grew up in Compton and first rose to fame as a member of NWA, whose debut album was titled \"Straight Outta Compton.\"\n\nHe later found success as a solo artist, producer and businessman.\n\nThe performing arts center will be the first new high school facility to be built in almost a decade in the greater Los Angeles area.\n\nCompton High School is more than 100 years old.\n\n\"This is very historical for Compton,\" said Compton Unified School District Board President Micah Ali."
