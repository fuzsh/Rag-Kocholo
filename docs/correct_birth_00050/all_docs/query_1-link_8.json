        "text": "(born 1965). American rapper and hip-hop producer Dr. Dre helped to popularize gangsta rap, a form of rap that depicts inner-city street violence and drug dealing. Dre was known for layering slick beats and melodies beneath harsh, often vulgar lyrics.\n\nAndré Romelle Young was born on February 18, 1965, in Los Angeles, California, to teenage parents who dreamed of becoming professional singers. He adopted the stage name of Dr. Dre in the early 1980s and began performing as a hip-hop deejay and as part of the group World Class Wreckin’ Cru. In 1986 he founded N.W.A. (Niggaz with Attitude) with fellow rappers Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The group’s second album, Straight Outta Compton (1988), was a breakthrough for the new gangsta rap movement. Dre not only contributed as a rapper in N.W.A., but he also gained fame as a producer, designing noisy, multilayered sonic collages to back the group’s inflammatory lyrics.\n\nDre left N.W.A. in 1992 and cofounded Death Row Records with Marion (“Suge”) Knight. That same year he introduced the “G-funk” production style in his solo debut album, The Chronic. This style was characterized by plodding tempos, synthesizer washes, and copious musical “sampling” of 1970s funk records, especially those by Parliament/Funkadelic. The Chronic achieved multiplatinum success and helped make this sound dominant in mainstream hip-hop in the mid-1990s. In 1996 Dre left Death Row Records to form Aftermath Records, where he focused on producing other artists’ work. Some of his most notable protégés include rappers Snoop Dogg and Eminem. Among the artists he collaborated with in the early years of the 21st century were Mary J. Blige, Jay Z, and 50 Cent.\n\nIn 1999 Dr. Dre released a second hit solo album, 2001. He soon began working on a follow-up, but it was many years in the making. Dre’s third album, Compton, was finally released in 2015. The album was reportedly inspired by the film Straight Outta Compton (2015), which told the story of N.W.A.\n\nOutside of the recording studio, Dr. Dre found success as a businessman. In 2008 he and Jimmy Iovine, a music executive, formally established Beats Electronics, which sold headphones, earphones, and speakers, among other items. Six years later they launched Beats Music, a music-streaming service. The two companies were purchased by Apple for $3 billion in 2014."
