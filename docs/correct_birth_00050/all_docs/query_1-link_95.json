        "text": "\"The Forbes list just changed.\"\n\nThat is the boast made by singer-songwriter Tyrese Gibson in a video posted on Facebook (and later removed), before he is pushed aside by Dr Dre, the co-founder of the Beats Electronics firm.\n\nThe list of the richest people on the planet, says Dre, the 49-year-old hip-hop star and entrepreneur, has changed \"in a big way\".\n\n\"The first billionaire in hip hop right here from the... West Coast, believe me,\" he said, before the video abruptly ends.\n\nBy most accounts, Apple's $3bn (Â£1.8bn) acquisition of the Beats headphone and music streaming service will increase Dre's net worth from an estimated $550m to almost $800m - making him, if not hip-hop's first billionaire, certainly hip-hop's wealthiest man.\n\nSo how did Dr Dre, born Andre Romelle Young in inner-city Los Angeles, build his fortune?\n\nDan Charnas, a former hip-hop record producer and author of The Big Payback: The History of the Business of Hip-Hop, says that Dr Dre's business acumen was shaped by the culture of hip-hop in the 1980s, which was by necessity more entrepreneurial.\n\n\"There's a long tradition of entrepreneurship for artists in the hip-hop business because there was no other way they were going to get out there,\" says Charnas, noting that in the 1980s, major record labels and radio stations were hesitant to invest in and promote hip-hop music.\n\n\"Russell Simmons [and Rick Rubin] had to start their own music company if people were going to hear these records,\" he adds, referring to Def Jam records, one of the first and most successful hip-hop labels.\n\n\"The hustle of that extended to everything.\"\n\nJust a year after he released his debut album, The Chronic, in 1992 - which sold three million copies and won a Grammy award - Dr Dre also helped produce Snoop Dogg's first album, Doggystyle, which sold an astonishing five million copies.\n\nLike many hip-hop stars of the era, Dre also made sure that he earned a cut of his own sales as a producer - eventually becoming \"the single most influential producer in hip-hop history\", according to Rolling Stone magazine, external.\n\nAfter a falling out with his label, Death Row Records, due to a contract dispute (among other concerns), Dre negotiated a deal with Interscope to start his own label, Aftermath Entertainment, in 1996.\n\nHe then signed and helped produce albums by young hip-hop artists, most notably Eminem, before selling his share of the label back to Interscope in 2001 for a reported $35m.\n\n\"Why beg Adidas for an endorsement deal and make them all the money when you could put your own clothing out and do it yourself?\" says Mr Charnas of the entrepreneurial spirit which pervaded hip-hop at the time.\n\nDr Dre was similarly pushed into consumer branding, but he took a slightly different route.\n\nAs the possibly apocryphal story goes, Dre's lawyers had asked him to endorse sneakers.\n\nHe ran into then-Interscope chairman Jimmy Iovine on the beach, who said something along the lines of: \"[Expletive] sneakers, let's sell speakers.\"\n\nThe Monster reputation helped - but so did celebrity endorsements, which included Lady Gaga, as well as prominent placement within music videos.\n\n\"Beats is viewed as a triumph of marketing more than it is a fantastic product - there are a lot of people who feel there are better headphones to be bought in the market,\" says Mr Charnas.\n\nDr Dre used his reputation as a producer to market the product, saying: \"Hear what the artists hear, and listen to the music the way they should, the way I do.\"\n\nBut the hip-hop artist has previously maintained that for him, it isn't all about the cash.\n\nIn an interview with Esquire last year, external, he talked about turning down potential investors by telling them he doesn't need any more money.\n\n\"That part is entertaining, because people look at you like you're crazy when you say you don't need any more money. Who says that?\" he said.\n\nPerhaps hip-hop's richest man did used to say that. At least until Apple came knocking."
