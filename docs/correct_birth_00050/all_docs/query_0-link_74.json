        "text": "The greatest people in history have been failures. Certainly, we remember these individuals as successes--success stories--and we treat those stories as legends and those individuals as gods. But each of them failed epically and repeatedly, more so than the combined successes of all of humanity.\n\nFailure should not be overlooked in anyone, especially not those we admire. It is through failure that these individuals were able to learn, grow and ultimately succeed. We know this about ourselves but even as we learn to accept our own failures, sometimes we don’t recognize that the most successful people in the world have had an abundance of failure.\n\nOur heroes need to be held to the same standard as the ancient Greek gods: awesome but not infallible. Failure is a humbling exercise, both for the observer and the observed. But learning is a humbling process. Once we realize that our heroes are just like us, we can examine how failure drives success. So I’ve started collecting stories about the failures of successful people, as a reminder that if you’re making mistakes and learning from them, you’re actually on the path to success.\n\nAndre Young, better known as Dr. Dre, grew up in Compton, California at a time when gangs controlled much of the city and drugs were a primary source of income for young men. He may have been tempted to be part of that lifestyle, but his mother was adamant that Young make something of himself. His mother moved the kids around regularly so that they weren’t persuaded to join a gang or bothered or bullied. Young also dressed in black at school so that there could be no gang color association or confusion. But by junior high school, the situation was so out of control that his mother had Young bussed to a safer school in the suburbs. That decision alone was likely to have changed his life, as just a few years later, Young’s brother was killed as a result of gang violence.\n\nBy high school, Young was deeply into music. His mother bought him a turntable and his focus increasingly moved to rap, funk, and hip-hop. He worked tirelessly on his craft, which ironically hurt his grades in school. Young became part of a number of rap groups and eventually dropped out of school to pursue music full time. He took on the stage name Dr. Dre (a play off the legendary Philadelphia 76ers basketball player Dr. J) and took to wearing lab coats at his performances.\n\nLife was not easy early on. His music career stumbled and he struggled to make money. Dr. Dre had two kids out of wedlock and numerous run-ins with the police that landed him in jail. On one such occasion in 1987, he was arrested for unpaid parking tickets. He called a friend to help, but the friend couldn’t cover bail. So he reached out to the only other option he could think of, a local drug dealer he knew. The dealer, Eric Wright, was willing to bail Dr. Dre out, but he had a condition.\n\nWright happened to own a fledgling music label, and he told Dr. Dre that he could pay off his debt by helping produce a record. This wasn’t just a lucky break; it was a virtual miracle of circumstance. Dr. Dre and Wright put together a group of people to create a record. Dr. Dre created the sound, they brought in another friend, O'Shea Jackson (known now as Ice Cube), to write lyrics, and they pulled in a group of rappers to sing. After some turmoil, they had Wright do the rapping under the stage name Eazy-E. After the success of their first single, they added three others to their group and named the band N.W.A.\n\nEvery member of N.W.A. was from the poor inner city of Compton and most of them had a history of trouble with the law. Their lyrics were aggressive, emotional, and filled with rage. They called their genre of music Gangsta Rap. Parents hated them, the police wanted them in jail, the FBI had a file on them, and the US government considered them a public nuisance. The FBI even sent a letter to the group stating that N.W.A. “encourages violence against and disrespect for the law enforcement officer...I wanted you to be aware of the FBI's position...Advocating violence and assault is wrong and we in the law enforcement community take exception to such action.”\n\nBut the group was not engaged in any gang activity. They did not recruit kids, deal drugs, or kill people; they simply made music. However, in one very real way, N.W.A. was indeed a gang. They were a gang in the sense that they provided a home and family for each other. They pushed themselves and they mentored each other to greatness. And Dr. Dre was at the helm.\n\nDr. Dre spent five years with N.W.A., but left when he felt the producers weren’t giving a fair percentage of the royalties to the entire group. In what became a pattern, Dre left quietly, without asking for anything special, taking nothing and no one with him, and without harboring resentment. All he asked for was to be free from any further obligations. His contract was probably worth millions, but to Dre, his freedom and integrity were worth more.\n\nHe went on to partner with Suge Knight, another producer looking to start a new record label. Together they formed Death Row Records and began building the business. Dre believed that his pattern of success at N.W.A. came from a combination of hard work, grit, and building the right team, so he set out to do that again.\n\nWorking on his own solo album, he partnered with dozens of writers, other rappers, even other producers. So much so, in fact, that some people criticized the work as not being authentically from Dr. Dre. But Dre knew better: collaboration was an important part of his creative process, a process he perfected through countless hours of trial and error. In an age of egoism, Dr. Dre realized that a team is far stronger than an individual artist ever could be. His debut album, The Chronic, was an immediate success and went triple platinum, selling 5.7 million records.\n\nTo put the album’s collaborative spirit into perspective, Dr. Dre had over 10 writers, including Snoop Dogg, Colin Wolfe, RBX, Dat Nigga Daz, The D.O.C., Nate Dogg, Kurupt, The Lady of Rage, Kevin Lewis, and Jewell; nearly 15 performers, including Snoop Dogg, RBX, Jewell, Ruben, Warren G, Dat Nigga Daz, BJ, Samara, The D.O.C., Kurupt, The Lady of Rage, Bushwick Bill, and Emmage; and borrowed samples from over 40 different artists as diverse as George Clinton, James Brown, and Led Zeppelin.\n\nThis type of deep collaboration was truly unprecedented. The result was equally unprecedented. The New York Times heralded the album as:\n\n\"simultaneously relaxed and menacing. The bottom register is swampy synthesizer bass lines that openly emulate Parliament-Funkadelic; the upper end is often a lone keyboard line, whistling or blipping insouciantly. In between are wide-open spaces that hold just a rhythm guitar, sparse keyboard chords and perhaps a singalong chorus between a rapper's unhurried rhymes. It's a hermetic sound, sealed off from street noise as if behind the windows of a limousine or a jacked-up jeep; it's the sound of the player, enjoying ill-gotten gains but always watching his back.\"\n\nThe music was complex, and so too was the message. Dr. Dre established himself not as a musician, but as a producer capable of creating a finely tuned symphony. With N.W.A. and The Chronic, he became successful through teamwork. His next act was to do so through mentoring.\n\nAfter The Chronic, Dr. Dre put his own recording ambitions on hold and turned toward mentoring and producing other artists including Snoop Doggy Dogg, Tupac Shukar, Warren G, Nate Dogg and numerous others. In each case, Dre produced, co-wrote, and gave each artist what they needed to succeed and grow. But it wasn’t until Dre met up with a little known white rapper from Detriot that he truly felt his calling as a mentor.\n\nMarshall Mathers, better known as Eminem, didn’t have many people to look up to as a child. Born in 1972 to a teenaged mother, his father left the family shortly thereafter, and Eminem and his mother lived in a low-class inner city neighborhood in Detroit. Eminem was repeatedly beat up at school, and frequently fought with his mother in what is best described as an unstable home.\n\nAfter spending three years in the 9th grade, 17-year old Eminem dropped out of school. His only interests were comic books, storytelling, and hip-hop. He had begun to write his own songs at 14, and participated in freestyle rap battles and open mic contests any time he got the chance. After years of making the rounds, he attracted the interest of several rap groups with whom he released albums, although none achieved any commercial success.\n\nEminem had a tumultuous, on-again off-again relationship with runaway Kimberly Scott, who Eminem’s mother had invited to stay in their home from the time Kim was 13. Eventually, Kim Scott and Eminem moved in together, and Scott gave birth to their child, Hailie, in 1995. After her birth, Eminem worked 60 hours a week cooking and washing dishes at a Detroit restaurant. It wasn’t enough to make ends meet, and to make matters worse, Eminem and Kim’s home was robbed several times. They moved back in to Eminem’s mother’s mobile home, where Eminem struggled with drug abuse and severe depression. During this tough time he created an alter ego, Slim Shady, through whom he was able to express some of his darkest thoughts and feelings. In 1997, he released a record called the Slim Shady EP, which broached controversial topics including violence, poverty, sex, and marital discord.\n\nLater that year Eminem went to Los Angeles to participate in a rap contest, and he placed second. Interscope Records staff noticed him and sent a copy of the Slim Shady EP to the label CEO Jimmy Iovine, who played it for Dr. Dre who was immediately hooked. He later said that he had never before found talent by listening to a demo tape, but when he heard Eminem’s EP, all he had to say was “Find him. Now.”\n\nFor Eminem, it was a dream come true. Dr. Dre was one of his idols. “I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much,” recalls Eminem. “I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre.” The doctor took Eminem under his wing and produced The Slim Shady LP, which was released in February 1999 and sold almost half a million copies in the first two weeks, was certified triple platinum by the end of the year, and ultimately became quadruple platinum. Eminem went from rags to riches in the span of a few short months, all thanks to Dr. Dre.\n\nIn 2000, Eminem told MTV News that he knew he would be successful once he started working with Dr. Dre.\n\nThe point where I actually knew that I made it was the first day I went to Dre’s house and we recorded three songs in less than six hours. I was really out to impress him, to show him what I could do. And when I saw Dre nodding his head and laughing at some of the things that I was saying…that’s finally when I realized, “This is my big break.”\n\nIn Dr. Dre’s song “I Need a Doctor,” Eminem raps “All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest. You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you.”\n\nThe respect is certainly mutual. Dr. Dre said:\n\n\"There’s nothing that I wouldn’t do for Eminem. I have to give him as much props as he gives me. The way he puts together his lyrics, the writing process, the way he records, how particular he is about the way he sounds.\"\n\nEminem isn’t the only artist who credits Dr. Dre with changing his life. Dre has since mentored dozens of artists, many of whom have achieved commercial success as recording artists including Warren G, Kurupt, Nas, and Nate Dogg. Others had success in different ways, such as producers Sam Sneed and Neff-U. And a few become worldwide superstars, such as Snoop Dogg, The Game, Kendrick Lamar, 2Pac, and, of course, Eminem. For seven years after his first album, in fact, Dr. Dre exclusively helped other artists, before finally releasing his second personal album in 1999, confusingly titled 2001.\n\nDr. Dre helped his artists succeed as individual performers, but also taught them the personal and professional benefits of helping others to succeed. For his part, Eminem has paid it forward by mentoring new artists himself. Curtis Jackson, who has sold over 30 million records under the stage name 50 Cent, credits Eminem with believing in him when no one else would and getting his career off the ground. “I credit a huge portion of my success to Em because if it wasn't for him being excited about the project, no one else would have rallied around it,” 50 Cent says. “At a point where you desperately need help, and a person comes and lends you a hand, I don't see how you could forget what that person did for you.” Eminem has reminded people that what he did for 50 Cent is exactly what Dr. Dre once did for him.\n\nSuccess for these artists came from teaming up and helping each other. Teamwork has also allowed Dr. Dre and his protégés to transfer their success into other fields. It is probably worth more than a passing reference that Dre and his team also created headphone company Beats by Dr. Dre, which sold to Apple in 2014 for $3 billion, making Dre and his partners billionaires.\n\nOccasionally it seems that an artist or entrepreneur has “made it” all on his own. But more often than not, if you dig beneath the surface, you’ll see that he or she has been helped along by a mentor, someone who has been there before and has gained the knowledge and experience to help the next person in line. This is not uncommon. But in the case of Dr. Dre and his gang of musicians, mentorship has been transformed into both an art and a science, one that has created generations of artists and will likely continue to do so for years to come.\n\nBe sure to check out the other articles in the failure series:"
