One Love!!\" Picture: Getty\n\n3.

He told Vibe; \"That made me want to DJ. It made me want to know what hip-hop was. That was the song that did it. I immediately went home and called some friends and we were taking apart one of my friend's mother's stereo sets.. We figured out how to make a mixer from the balance button and got it cracking—started making mixtapes.\"\n\n16.

Nobody cares what kind of sneakers you wear, but they would care about the speakers you use.' And speakers turned into headphones.”\n\n20.
