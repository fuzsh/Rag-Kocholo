        "text": "Dr. Dre might be a music mogul, but the rapper, producer, and Beats founder is steadily approaching real estate mogul status as well. Five years after buying a massive compound in L.A.’s Brentwood neighborhood from Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen for $40 million, the former N.W.A. member is looking to offload his longtime Woodland Hills mansion, and has listed it for $5.25 million.\n\nThe Grammy winner purchased the French country–style manor home 20 years ago for $2.35 million, according to reports, and has since updated it to attract a modern buyer.\n\nThe three-story, 16,200-square-foot house was built in 1987 and is situated in a gated community, set on over half an acre. With Dre’s additions, it also boasts two kitchens, a wine cellar that can hold up to 250 bottles, a barre studio, a movie theater, and a 150-gallon fish tank. Large folding-glass doors line most of the living room and wet bar, allowing for seamless indoor-outdoor living. There’s even an indoor hot tub that sits just behind the glass doors.\n\nElsewhere in the home are eight bedrooms, 13 bathrooms, two powder rooms, formal living and dining areas, an office, and a sitting area with a pool table. Fireplaces and wraparound balconies can be found throughout the house. The master suite is, not surprisingly, quite impressive, with a sitting area, dressing room, windowed bathroom, and dry sauna. Outside the dwelling, there’s a saltwater swimming pool, multiple patios, and a fire pit—and there’s even a flat-screen TV near the pool area.\n\nDr. Dre is clearly ready to move on from this home, as he’s purchased two other residences in the Los Angeles area over the past couple of years, in addition to the Brentwood estate.\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nInside LeBron James’s Houses: A Peek Into His Sizable Real Estate Portfolio\n\nThe NBA star owns properties in his home state of Ohio, in Florida, and in California\n\nAD Pro\n\n37 of the Brightest and Best Kitchens in AD\n\nBecause we adore spending time in our kitchens too\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nElon Musk Now Lives in a $50,000 Prefab Tiny House in Texas\n\nAfter selling most of his real estate portfolio, the multibillionaire is now living in a 400-square-foot unit on his SpaceX Texas site\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nInside Russell Wilson and Ciara’s Showstopping Properties\n\nThe NFL champion and the R&B superstar maintain abodes in California, Colorado, and Washington State"
