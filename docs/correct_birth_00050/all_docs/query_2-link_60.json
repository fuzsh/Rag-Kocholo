The rapper and record producer was a pioneer in the emergence of hyphy, bringing it mainstream. Hyphy culture started in Oakland in the late 1990s, its music played in clubs off Broadway like Mingles and Geoffrey’s, and spread throughout the Bay Area in the early 2000s. Mac Dre’s songs, with fast-paced rhymes and basslines, inspired a new style of dance.\n\nAt 21, he served time in prison for conspiracy to commit robbery, although there was no robbery and he was not near. After his release, in 1998, he founded the independent record label Thizz Entertainment (now managed by his mother Wanda Salvatto) recording albums and giving aspiring rappers an outlet to release albums locally. In 2004, after a show in Kansas City, MO, Hicks was killed when an unknown gunman shot at his van. He is buried in Oakland at Mountain View Cemetery.\n\n“Hyphy” was first coined by Oakland rapper Keak da Sneak in 1994. He told Complex it came about “‘cause I used to eat a lot of candy. I was thinking hyper, like when a kid eats a lot of candy and they can’t be still and they just runnin’ around. Hyphy is energy, a lifestyle.“ In East Oakland, and throughout the Bay Area, there are regular hyphy car parties called “sideshows” that include ghost-riding, (when a car is put in neutral and the driver walks alongside or on top of it as it rolls), donuts, racing, and dancing. E-40, Mistah F.A.B., Too $hort, and Keak Da Sneak have crystallized hyphy, finishing Mac Dre’s work.\n\nThis mural by Amend TDK  featuring Mac Dre is located at 5th Ave and E 18th St, on the side of 3 Rings Liquors. @amendtdk @thizznationbiz @officialkeakdasneak @e40 @tooshort @fabbydavisjr1 #secretoakland\n\nResearch Sources:\nwikipedia.org (Mac Dre), rap.fandom.com (Mac Dre), complex.com (An Oral History of Hyphy)\".",
