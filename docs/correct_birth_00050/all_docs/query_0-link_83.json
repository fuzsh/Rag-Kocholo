        "text": "LOS ANGELES – Andre Young is Compton’s own hometown hero. Rising to fame and celebrated to today as Dr. Dre, Young continues to make noise in the music industry. Dr. Dre is on a roll. The hip hop superstar put on a sterling Super Bowl LVI halftime show with fellow Compton musicians Snoop Dogg and Kendrick Lamar.\n\nA little more than year later, Young, the former N.W.A. (Niggers With Attitude) member and Death Row Records composer received one of the highest honors from his peers.\n\nASCAP, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, presented its inaugural ASCAP Hip-Hop Icon Award to Young at a private party on the rooftop of the London West Hollywood. The award was presented by rap star Snoop Dogg.\n\nDr. Dre was honored for his musical contributions that have made an indelible impact on the art and culture of hip-hop. He is an eight-time Grammy Award-winning artist, producer, entrepreneur, philanthropist and founder and CEO of Aftermath Entertainment and Beats Electronics.\n\nHis groundbreaking solo debut album, The Chronic, has been certified triple platinum by the RIAA, reached the top 10 on the Billboard 200 and won a Grammy for Best Rap Solo Performance (“Let Me Ride”).\n\nAs head of Aftermath Entertainment, Dre discovered hip-hop superstars such as 50 Cent, Kendrick Lamar, Anderson .Paak and Eminem. He went on to establish Beats Electronics in 2008, and later Beats Music, both acquired by Apple in 2014.\n\nCelebrities in attendance included hip-hop luminaries, platinum-selling rapper Snoop Dogg, and hip-hop veteran Big Daddy Kane. Other notable attendees included singer-songwriter Varren Wade, Grammy Award-winning producer Warryn Campbell and gospel superstar Erica Campbell, Grammy Award-winning songwriter and artist Joelle James, Chicago legend George Daniels, television industry maverick Mona Scott-Young, Grammy-nominated rapper Wale, and songwriter artist Muni Long."
