        "text": "Andre Romelle Young (born 18 February 1965), known professionally as Dr. Dre, is an American rapper and entrepreneur who was most famous for co-founding and serving as president of Death Row Records, for his involvement with the gangsta rap group N.W.A. during the 1980s and 1990s, and for his highly successful solo career.\n\nBiography[]\n\nAndre Romelle Young was born in Compton, California in 1965, and he was raised in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, with his grandmother in Compton caring for him for most of his upbringing. He dropped out of high school to perform at Eve's After Dark nightclub starting in 1985, and he joined World Class Wreckin' Cru that same year. In 1986, he joined Ice Cube, Eazy-E, and a few other rappers in forming N.W.A., which popularized the use of explicit lyrics to detail the violence of street life in crime-ridden Los Angeles. In 1992, he released his debut solo album, and he had a highly successful career during the 1990s befoore focusing on producing other artists during the 2000s as founder of Aftermath Entertainment. By 2018, he was the second-richest figure in hip-hop with a net worth of $800 million. However, his reputation was marred by many allegations of assaulting women, including his former partners Michel'le and Lisa Johnson."
