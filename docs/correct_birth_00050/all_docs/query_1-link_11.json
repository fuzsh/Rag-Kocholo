He is the founder and current CEO of Aftermath Entertainment and Beats Electronics. Dre was previously the co-owner and artist of Death Row Records. He has produced albums for and supervised the careers of many rappers, including Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Knoc-turn'al, Xzibit, 50 Cent, The Game and more recently Kendrick Lamar. He is credited as a key figure in the popularisation of West Coast G-funk.\n\nDre began his career as a member of the World Class Wreckin' Cru and later found fame with the influential gangsta rap group N.W.A with Eazy-E, Ice Cube, MC Ren, and DJ Yella, which popularised the use of explicit lyrics in rap to detail the violence of street life. He released his solo debut album The Chronic in 1992, released under Death Row Records, which led him to become one of the best-selling American performing artists of 1993 and to win a Grammy Award for the single \"Let Me Ride\". The same year he produced Death Row labelmate Snoop Dogg's quadruple platinum debut Doggystyle.\n\nIn 1996, he left Death Row to establish his own label, Aftermath Entertainment. He produced a compilation album titled Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath in 1996, and released a solo album titled 2001 in 1999. Dr. Dre signed Eminem and 50 Cent to his record label in 1998 and 2002 respectively, while contributing production on their albums. His latest album, Compton, was released in 2015. Dr. Dre has won six Grammy Awards, including Producer of the Year. He has also had acting roles in movies such as Set It Off, The Wash and Training Day.\n\nDiscography[]"
