Born Andre Romelle Young, Dr. Dre is a record producer, rapper, actor and entrepreneur from Compton, California. Dr. Dre is the founder and CEO of Beats Electronics, Aftermath Entertainment, and the former president and co-founder of Death Row Records. One of Dr. Dre’s biggest contribution to the hip hop genre is the creation of West Coast G-Funk, with it’s slow, heavy beats and synthesizer baseline. Dr. Dre has worked with and helped produce music for artists like 2Pac, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, 50 Cent, The Game, Kendrick Lamar, and Anderson. Paak to name a few. He has won 6 Grammys, and in 2016, he was inducted into the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame for his work with legendary rap group N.W.A. With hip hop being one of America’s most popular genres of music, it makes sense that this year, 2022, the NFL finally decided to put on a Hip Hop centered Half-time show with Dr. Dre Leading the performance. This year’s halftime show serves as a reminder to all those who forgot, it’s “Still D.R.E.”.
