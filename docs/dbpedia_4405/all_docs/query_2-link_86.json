These cover an even wider range of cuisines, as well as baking and drink pairing lessons.\n\nLearn More about Cook Street School of Culinary Arts >>\n\n​​Sip and Savor on a Cocktails or Wine Tour\n\nRather than the standard after-work happy hour, opt for a private drink tour of downtown Denver! Sip and savor on our top-rated Cocktail Tasting Tour, or join our Denver Wine Walk which visits some of the city’s best wine bars and tasting rooms.\n\nAn experienced local guide will walk you from spot to spot, explaining what’s special about each food and drink pairing.

Local foodie guides accompany groups, but you can choose the level of information shared. Opt for basic restaurant introductions to maximize team bonding time, or request a full tour with dining insights and city history.\n\nThis 2-hour experience requires a minimum of 50 guests and can accommodate up to 150. Tours are available daily with start times between 11:30 am and 8 pm. Pricing is $99 per guest and includes all five food tastings (a full dinner), two cocktail pairings, private foodie guides, and all taxes, fees, and gratuities.\n\nLearn More about Market and Food Hall Tours >>\n\nTake a Mixology Class at Deviation Distilling\n\nPhoto: Deviation Distilling Facebook\n\nTreat your team to an outing at Deviation Distilling, downtown Denver’s only gin distillery. Its botanical-forward, innovative spirits include options like the pink Citrus Rosé gin and Spice Trade gin made with malted rye and an Asian-inspired infusion of Szechuan peppercorns, cardamom, Thai basil, and ginger.\n\nBut that’s not all — its Barista Spirits blend whiskey and coffee, and its cocktails take this cafe idea a step further. Deviation’s chai old fashioned is truly one of my favorite drinks in the city.\n\nExperience the creativity for yourself with a visit to its Dairy Block lounge. Groups are sure to love its monthly cocktail class series, featuring seasonal gin, whiskey, and bourbon-based beverages. For a customized menu, you can book a private cocktails experience.

James Blanchard, formally in the Air Force, was stationed in California’s Central Coast wine region and would tour vineyards to learn about winemaking. Meanwhile, his brother, Mark, was a manager and wine buyer for a specialty liquor store, which then led him to work at wineries throughout Napa and Sonoma County.\n\nTheir shared backgrounds and interests eventually led them to start their own operation in Denver’s swanky Dairy Block micro-district. Blanchard Family Wines blends California and Colorado-grown grapes to produce a variety of prized vinos, which are thoughtfully paired with local products. These include m2 Confections handmade chocolates, Kettle Head gourmet popcorns, and Bella French macarons.\n\nOur local businesses support each other, too, as Blanchard Family Wines is a stop on our Denver Wine Walk!

Drinks are not included in its event fee, but all painting materials are provided. Select the demonstrated art piece, pick your preferred playlist, and leave the rest of the party planning to the venue. This near-effortless team outing idea is sure to be a win with creative groups.\n\nLearn More about Whimsy Studios >>"
