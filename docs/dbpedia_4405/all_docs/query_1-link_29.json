        "text": "The Hardware Research and Technology Lab develops climate solutions to combat climate change aimed at reducing emissions, conserving energy, and mitigating environmental impact; advances sensor technologies and analytics at the edge; and pushes the limits of materials science to engineer innovative substances that address big challenges. We also explore interdisciplinary efforts to develop bio-inspired devices tailored for applications in healthcare, ranging from diagnostics to therapeutic interventions.\n\nWe offer our fully developed cleanroom to provide a comprehensive support infrastructure available for the entire device development lifecycle, from conception to large-scale manufacturing. Working with partners to bring technologies to market, we have a collaborative approach to innovation, involving partnerships to accelerate the commercialization and widespread adoption of transformative technologies.\n\nThe Intelligent Systems Lab embeds resilience into autonomous systems, enables cooperation between humans and machines (particularly in guiding physical tasks), integrates AI with physics-based models to enhance decision-making, and assists experts across a variety of domains. Our lab provides a comprehensive approach to safeguarding distributed systems in the physical and cyber worlds on a large scale, and it democratizes design and manufacturing â€” making the systems and tools accessible to a broader audience."
