        "text": "Martin Kleckner III, PhD MBA\n\nDirector, EPIC SBDC\n\nEntrepreneurship & Innovation\n\n619-892-2565\n\nmartin.kleckner@ucr.edu\n\nMr. Kleckner has 28 years experience in operations and business development in life sciences, healthcare, oil & gas, and cable television. He has advised over 115 emerging and Fortune 100 companies with corporate planning and strategy, commercialization and public policy throughout Europe, Asia & the Americas. He participated as founder or early-stage employee in five venture start-ups with two successful exits. Mr. Kleckner has been instrumental in supporting faculty and small businesses submit winning SBIR/STTR proposals through the EPIC SBDC SBIR/STTR Resource Center.\n\nEPIC SBDC advisors worked closely with Rejoule, Inc. as it was awarded $10,000,000 in grant funding from the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) within the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). This was part of the DOE's Long-Duration Energy Storage Demonstrations Funding Opportunity. Rejoule additionally won the $500,000 Grand Prize from American Solar Prize Round 6 and $50,000 from the Justice, Equity, Diversity And Inclusion (Jedi) Contest. Rejoule also was a winner of DOE's EPIC Prize. Rejoule was one of five (5) winners of the second DOE EPIC Prize Pitch Competition.\n\nEPIC SBDC advisors are helping Rejoule expand its operations and establish a made-in-California battery repurposing supply chain, putting it in position to process hundreds of MWh of repurposed batteries in 2024. Moreover, EPIC SBDC advisors are providing guidance on opportunities or incentives programs to establish clean energy manufacturing facilities for the LA, OC, and Riverside county areas.\n\nEdge Sound Research attained a venture capital Pre-Seed Round investment of $525,000.00 followed by a seed round of $1.9 million (for a total $2,425,000). EPIC SBDC made over 32 investor introductions for this deal over a one-year period. Edge Sound technology offers suite or premium seating at live sporting events by attaching its ResonX Core transducer to a seat, wiring it to a venue’s sound system and, using proprietary software, configuring it to align its vibrations with the seat’s material, creating flat, master-grade audio. The ensuing sensation is that of feeling sound radiate from oneself, as opposed to blasting at you from a speaker. And the sound transmitted can be as intimate as the bounce of a basketball. Edge now works with two NBA teams, the Pacers and Cavaliers.\n\nVisiCELL Medical secured an angel/private investment: $900,000.00 from multiple investors. This investment was part of its note-to-round capital bridge raise of $1.5 million. VisiCELL Medical, a long-standing EPIC SBDC client, further made business and market development traction with clinical trial partnerships (Astra Zeneca, Takeda, et al.) plus the hiring of its Chief Operations Officer. We are now supporting them in a search for a Chief Business Development Officer in concert with a next round investment capital raise.\n\nWater Illumination Inc.\n\nWater Illumination, with rigorous support from EPIC SBDC advisors, was awarded an SBIR Phase I Grant: $275,000.00 from the National Science Foundation. The technology addresses global contamination issues of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in water resources through their efficient destruction and will ensure safe drinking water supplies. The project team aims for technical innovation via this Phase I project which will focus on discovery and early development of a highly efficient vacuum ultraviolet light (VUV)-based water ionization treatment system for degradation of PFAS in impacted water. EPIC SBDC advisors are also supporting the Water Illumination team for an EPA Phase I project (an additional scope of work on PFAS)."
