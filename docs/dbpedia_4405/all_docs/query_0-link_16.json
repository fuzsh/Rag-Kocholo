        "text": "I remember my very first time witnessing the power of a branded culture team. I was working in a sister company to the company that had created a detailed process to establish and sustain their team. They had a recruitment process, they had a unique name, they had a clear focus and they had executive support. I could see the excitement around the members of the team and those who wanted to be on the team. They seemed all put together and fully brought into the change that they wanted to see in their workplace. They didn‚Äôt need to wait for permission.\n\nDo you believe that employees are valuable resources in shaping and maintaining a positive organizational culture? That is what caring leadership is all about!\n\nGreat cultures don‚Äôt happen by accident; you must get employee buy-in.\n\nIf you‚Äôve struggled with maintaining a great culture in the past, let me introduce you to the concept of Culture teams.\n\nAn employee-led culture team is a group of employees who come together voluntarily to help shape and promote the organization‚Äôs workplace culture.\n\nThis team is typically composed of individuals from various departments and levels within the company, and their primary responsibility is to foster a positive and inclusive workplace culture.\n\nThe key responsibilities and functions of an employee-led culture team often include:\n\nCulture advocacy,\n\nEmployee Engagement,\n\nDiversity and Inclusion,\n\nFeedback Communication,\n\nOrganizational values,\n\nCulture initiatives,\n\nChange management,\n\nRecognition and celebration.\n\nCulture advocacy\n\nThe members of the team act as champions for the organization‚Äôs core values, mission, and vision to help reinforce these principles throughout the workplace. Even if new initiatives have some up in arms, the culture team stands in allegiance with said initiatives because they had a say in the initiative‚Äôs formation.\n\nEmployee Engagement\n\nThey work on initiatives and activities that enhance employee engagement, satisfaction, and well-being, such as organizing team-building events, social activities, and recognition programs. This is one of the team‚Äôs core objectives.\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\nThese teams often play a crucial role in promoting diversity and inclusion within the organization. They may lead efforts to create a more diverse workforce and foster an inclusive workplace culture where everyone feels like they belong.\n\nFeedback Communication\n\nThe culture team serves as a conduit for communication between employees and management. They gather feedback on cultural issues and suggest improvements. They ensure that they are the voice for the majority of employees inside the company.\n\nOrganizational values\n\nThey help ensure that the organization‚Äôs core values are integrated into daily operations and decision-making processes. So, if they see others act in conflict with those values, they speak up.\n\nCulture initiatives\n\nThey plan and implement initiatives, such as training programs, workshops, and communication campaigns, to reinforce the desired culture. They do this by continually including their coworkers in ideation.\n\nChange Management\n\nWhen the organization goes through significant changes, the employee-led culture team can help manage and support the transition by aligning the culture with the new direction. They make sure that more voices are heard through the change process, gathering greater buy-in.\n\nRecognition and Celebration\n\nOrganizing events and celebrations to acknowledge and appreciate employees‚Äô contributions and achievements. This could be birthdays, anniversaries, customer celebrations, cultural celebrations, or setting up team celebrations.\n\nOverall, what you should take from all of this is that without having these eight different components and responsibilities for creating an employee-led culture team, there would be no structure and less positive results. In order for an employee-led culture team to work, you need to address the diversity and inclusion aspects, the communication aspects, the values, and the engagement.\n\nPodcast\n\nIn this episode, Heather explores the pivotal role of employees in shaping and preserving a positive organizational culture. She introduces Culture Teams, emphasizing the intentional effort and employee buy-in required for great cultures. Heather highlights the responsibilities of employee-led culture teams, spanning cultural advocacy, employee engagement, diversity and inclusion, feedback communication, and more. These teams play a vital role in aligning organizational values, managing change, and celebrating employee contributions.\n\nListen to the audio version here\n\nBecome a Certified Art of Active Listening Facilitator\n\nWhat sets a good company apart from a GREAT one?\n\nIt comes down to three things... üí≠\n\n1. Ability: Every company needs a solid idea, function, or product. Capable individuals bring these to life, and voila, money starts flowing! Simple, right?\n\n2. Resources: Adequate resources keep the wheels turning. Money in, money out. This is a standard for a successful company.\n\n3. Culture: Now, here's the game-changer. The word to remember is \"GREAT.\" A good company functions, but a GREAT company thrives on culture. It's what turns a workplace from a job into a passion.\n\nWhether you sell office supplies or groundbreaking tech, ALL great companies share one thing ‚Äì a GREAT culture. It's not a one-size-fits-all concept; culture must adapt to the industry, the people, and their needs.\n\nAnd what's the key? Listening!\n\nI've spent years traveling, working with big companies, teaching them the power of LISTENING.\n\nIt's something often overlooked in communication, and it's the key to understanding what your employees truly want and need.\n\nI've taken my experience and created a Certification program. This program teaches you the art of asking the right questions, listening, responding, and acting on employee feedback. üí°\n\nThe next Cohort is on March 1-2, in Denver, CO üóìÔ∏è\n\nVisit https://heatheryounger.com/certification/ for more details.\n\nInvest in Culture, Build Greatness: Don't just be good; be GREAT. üåü\n\nAbout Heather R Younger\n\nHeather R Younger is a highly sought-after speaker, 2x-TEDx speaker, diversity, equity, and inclusion strategist, and contributor to leading news outlets. She is also the Founder and CEO of Employee Fanatix, a leading employee engagement and consulting firm.\n\nAfter over 25,000 employee engagement surveys and years of working with organizations to transform employee engagement, here‚Äôs what Heather has seen over and over:\n\nWhen you know how to listen, employees will tell you exactly what they need to bring their full selves to work."
