        "text": "Sales meetings are essential for any sales operation, but too often they are seen more as a necessary evil than an opportunity to improve.\n\nBy effectively planning and setting team meeting agendas, your discussions will be more productive. Your reps will be excited and ready to contribute to your sales meetings as a result.\n\nIn this definitive guide, you’ll learn exactly how to plan and prepare effective team meetings that drive strategic results. We’ll show you how to prepare sales team meeting agendas that:\n\nMotivate your team\n\nYield productive insights\n\nGenerate new ideas\n\nGet your reps to contribute to your sales process\n\nImprove your sales forecasting\n\nPart 1: Planning and preparing effective sales meeting agendas\n\nBefore you plan your meeting, ask yourself, “Do I even need one in the first place?”\n\nIf you can resolve issues, gather information or answer questions in less than 10 minutes, you probably don’t need to hold a meeting. Instead, you can reach out on Slack for a one-on-one chat or hop on a quick Zoom call with the team members you need answers from rather than holding an all-hands meeting.\n\nMark Hunter of The Sales Hunter shines a light on one particular motivator behind unnecessary sales meetings:\n\nThere are too many weekly sales meetings that are nothing more than a way for a sales manager to check something off their task list. If this is the motivation behind the meeting, I’d bet my last dollar that the meeting is NOT helpful to the people in it.\n\nAs a result, you could be wasting everyone’s time and losing respect from your reps. Avoid these types of meetings as much as possible.\n\nAssuming you’ve conducted this check, you can go ahead and prepare for your sales meeting.\n\nThe lessons in this guide apply to weekly meetings as well as one-off sessions. We’ll share ideas for the latter at the end.\n\nFour elements of a successful sales meeting\n\nIn fact, Doodle State of Meetings report found that ineffective meetings cost businesses in the U.S. $399 million. Crucially, when asked what makes an effective meeting, setting clear objectives was the overwhelming winner (72%), followed by setting a clear agenda (67%) and not having too many people in the room (35%).\n\nThat said, research is showing that the frequency of meetings has increased since the start of the pandemic. In the National Bureau of Research’s 2020 study, remote teams reported a 13% increase in the number of meetings held. While the average length of remote meetings decreased by 20% compared to face-to-face meetings, remote workers are reporting that the length of the average work day has increased by 48.5 minutes.\n\nWhat does all of this data mean? The shift to remote work has led to an increase in meetings, and while they are shorter, they’re occurring more frequently. This is leading to increased reports of burnout.\n\nThe solution? Absolutely still hold sales meetings, but only if you are sure they are necessary and will be meaningful.\n\nWhen putting together meaningful meetings, follow these principles:\n\nUse standardized agendas. Don’t reinvent the wheel for every meeting. Create “recurring” agendas and use these as templates. Team meeting agenda templates help your team know what to expect. Not only does this reduce the amount of time wasted trying to figure out agenda items, but it also means that the meeting attendees are better prepared with status updates, last meeting’s notes, docs and other pertinent information.\n\nProvide value. Every meeting should give your team value. In other words, provide them with something they can use to close more deals. This can be something as basic as training or even feedback from customers.\n\nTeam participation. Reps will get bored if you don’t get them involved. Generate “buy-in” by setting expectations before the meeting. Encourage interaction throughout the meeting with Q&As and brainstorming sessions.\n\nBe consistent. Speaking of expectations, make sure recurring meetings are always held on the same day of the month or week, and time of the day. This will build a rhythm that sets expectations for your team members.\n\nThis might seem overwhelming, especially when finding new ways to motivate your team – which is why having a consistent agenda will make life easier.\n\nItems for your sales meeting agenda\n\nSo, what exactly should you include in your team meeting agenda?\n\nThe best meetings focus on data, feedback and specific action items.\n\nHere are some meeting topics that should be on your sales meeting agenda:\n\nCelebrate the big wins. Start on a positive note. Kick your meetings off on a high note to set the tone for the rest of the session. Insights, progress on sales targets and new strategic accounts are all calls for a celebration. Having a well-organized CRM will help you collect the data behind these wins.\n\nUpdates on the pipeline. Get a quick status check from each team member. This keeps them accountable while shining a light on where you need to contribute – on both an individual and team-wide basis.\n\nUncover obstacles. Are there any bottlenecks holding your team up from making progress? These can often come in the form of travel plans or even roadblocks from other departments. A good staff meeting agenda template should have the team’s needs front and center.\n\nShare prospect insights. Allow your reps to share the feedback they receive from prospects. What are they saying about your value proposition, company and sales pitches?\n\nDive into the metrics. Focus on monthly targets, as well as the metrics that lead to closed deals. Focus on collective numbers and save any feedback for one-to-one discussions. Nobody likes being called out in front of their peers.\n\nShare organizational information. As a sales leader, you’ll have unique insights on what’s happening elsewhere in the business. Share noteworthy insights with your reps, especially anything related to product updates and marketing team activities.\n\nPick apart the competition. This is an opportunity for your reps to share anything they’ve learned about your competition, including why prospects chose them over you. Share as many insights as you can to get a bigger picture of the competitive landscape.\n\nInclude any other topics that are relevant to your industry or organization. Remember, standardization helps create consistency.\n\nBut don’t be afraid to test new sessions in your meetings over time.\n\nThis includes things like role-play and micro-training sessions. In other words, anything that adds value to your team members, their careers or your organization.\n\nOf course, you’ll need to document your agenda to distribute to your teams beforehand. You can make this yourself from scratch, or use a template like those at Template.net.\n\nHow to prepare for your sales meetings\n\nPreparation makes for a rich and well-informed meeting.\n\nStart by collecting the necessary metrics and insights. This includes numbers on win rates, average deal size, opportunities and response time.\n\nSales dashboards can help you collect and monitor this data on an ongoing basis.\n\nUse dashboards as the centerpiece of your sales meetings. This allows you to view metrics in real time without having to collect and organize data for every meeting.\n\nDelegate and assign roles to your reps, giving them a job for the meeting. For example, each sales team member can be appointed in turns to take notes. The official notetaker can also be tasked with distributing the agenda topics and the next meeting time.\n\nYou can also have reps give a demonstration of their pitch for each meeting. The rest of the team then provides feedback, allowing reps to optimize their presentation. That rep would then report back on prospect feedback in the next meeting.\n\nHere are a few other “housekeeping” items to keep in mind:\n\nChoose the decision-making process. Will actions and decisions be made based on group consensus, majority vote or leader’s choice?\n\nFinalize and distribute the agenda to your team ahead of time. Again, this is easier when using standardized templates.\n\nSend any necessary materials or reports ahead of time. If it’s a one-off meeting, you may need to pull these metrics together yourself. Otherwise, use your sales dashboards.\n\nMake sure everything is prepared. This includes equipment, software, previous meeting notes and your own information.\n\nTurn Maybe Into Yes With These Killer Follow Up Email Templates\n\nThese customizable follow up email templates will help you boost your chances of breaking through to your busiest prospects.\n\nWork email\n\nTick for more of our best how-to guides, templates and ebooks via email\n\nYour data is processed according to our privacy notice.

They’re often seen as a pain that prevents reps from doing their best work.\n\nSo make your sales meetings something they look forward to.\n\nAs sales author Mike Weinberg puts it:\n\n\"Do your people leave the meeting more aligned, more energized to sell, and better equipped to do their jobs?”\n\nIf the answer is no, then it’s time to make significant adjustments. In fact, I’d go as far as saying that until you get that figured out, I would suggest you stop meeting.\n\nIf you’re serious about upgrading your meetings, ask your best salespeople what they would like to see covered in team meetings, and inquire about what they have seen work well elsewhere.”\n\nOn top of removing the stigma around meetings, you’ll help reps feel comfortable to approach you with their challenges. They’ll feel more supported.\n\nThis means you must end every meeting with reps feeling pumped and ready to sell.\n\nHere are a few ways to do this.\n\nSharpen skills by reviewing sales training\n\nAs a sales manager, you know the importance of regularly training your reps. Coaching them on their strengths and sticking points is an ongoing job.\n\nSo, provide more value by adding a team-building element to your training regime.\n\nFor example, identify common sticking points within your sales process as a group, and then brainstorm ideas on how you can overcome those sticking points.\n\nYou can then vote on the best ideas and test them out over the course of the week. Report back on results in the following meeting and roll out successful approaches as part of your training and sales process.\n\nEven better, encourage each team member to bring their own lessons and insights to the table. Foster a culture of “crowdfunding” new sales approaches.\n\nYou’d be surprised what you can learn, even from novice salespeople.\n\nKeep brains sharp with current events\n\nYour reps know all the ins and outs of your products and services, but when it comes to other business topics, they might be less knowledgeable.\n\nThis usually happens when salespeople spend all their time learning about your product, organization, differentiators, features and benefits.\n\nAs a result, they may be less aware of what’s happening in the broader industry space, which can make sales conversations appear less authentic.\n\nSo, make this “small talk” a part of your sales meetings. Reserve a small amount of time discussing what’s happening in your industry.\n\nHere’s how you can keep on top of business news:\n\nRead industry publications and keep an eye on trends\n\nLook out for new studies and data that impact your prospect’s jobs\n\nUse social listening tools to understand what your audience is talking about\n\nFollow influencers on social media and keep an eye on interesting/trending content they create\n\nJeb Blount even goes as far as suggesting you treat this segment like a sales book club:\n\n“Have your team read a book. Before each meeting assign a chapter to discuss – and appoint a salesperson to lead/facilitate the discussion. Or rotate through each seller selecting a blog post relevant to a topic your team is facing and have the person send out the link with some primer question so reps come to the meeting prepared to discuss takeaways from the article.”\n\nCome to the sales meeting with a bullet-pointed list of new industry insights. Include links to relevant content in the meeting minutes.\n\nWhile it’s up to you to lead your salespeople, make sure they’re being proactive in keeping up to date with your industry.\n\nRole-play pitches and share stories\n\nStanding in front of the entire team can be intimidating for reps.\n\nIt’s also an opportunity for them to improve.\n\nThis not only makes your sales meetings more exciting, but also allows sales reps to tighten their pitch and improve how they communicate to prospects.\n\nHave each rep take it in turns to role-play their pitch week-by-week. Assign who will play the prospect and make sure both parties know in advance.\n\nWant to get buy-in from your salespeople quickly?\n\nDo this exercise yourself first.\n\nIntroduce the idea in a meeting and role-play your pitch to a rep on your team.\n\nOnce the pitch has been given, each team member provides their thoughts. The idea is to collect honest feedback on sticking points that reps might not be able to see.\n\nThis is also an opportunity to share case studies and success stories that reps can use in their pitches. You may not be seated around a campfire, but it’s important that you encourage reps to share ‘scary’ stories as well – those stories where you may not have followed the right process or made a mistake, but you learned and improved at the end.\n\nInvite subject matter experts\n\nWhat’s the best source of product and industry knowledge from within your company?\n\nAnswer: subject matter experts.\n\nSubject matter experts include product leaders, founders, and executives who have worked in the space for many years.\n\nOnce in a while, invite these experts to your meetings. Ask them to share insights on:\n\nTheir journey in the business and industry as a whole\n\nWhat their day-to-day work involves\n\nTheir thoughts on the future of your industry\n\nYou could even organize monthly sessions dedicated to subject matter expert sessions. If you’re part of a wider sales organization, speak to directors and stakeholders to get them on board. Share the benefits of running these sessions.\n\nWhether it’s a panel or speaker session, these insights will be invaluable to any sales rep.\n\nFive tips to motivate your teams\n\nThe principles above will keep your team energized and motivated.\n\nAdding these elements to your meetings will keep reps looking forward to those scheduled get-togethers.\n\nRemember, there’s a difference between energy and morale. What we’ve covered in this section will get your team members pumped, but you must also keep them motivated.\n\nWith that in mind, let’s explore some approaches you can use in your meetings to keep reps in good spirits.\n\nShow appreciation. It’s important to show recognition for the work salespeople are doing. Even the most minute of improvements is worth celebrating. Thanking them and demonstrating trust, both as a group and one-to-one, will have them feeling good and ready to crush their quotas.\n\nCreate a sense of team collaboration. Remove the borders between boss and employee. Offer the responsibility for new projects to team members, giving them a chance to shine and develop their personal skills at the same time.\n\nEnable autonomy. Along that same vein, remind reps they have complete autonomy over their results. Can you identify and highlight any privileges they’re not taking advantage of?\n\nFoster a culture of transparency. Small acts of sharing can go a long way. This includes explaining your reasoning behind a new process or sharing the data that informed your decision for a big change.\n\nUnderstand personality traits. All reps are motivated by different things and, similarly, react to various situations differently. Knowing the personality traits of your team members will help you tailor your management approach while being conscious of their values/beliefs during team meetings.\n\nPrevent failure with your guide to handling tricky sales situations\n\nLearn how to prevent and overcome failure for your sales team.

You may unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThe principles shared in this section will get your reps excited and motivated about your meetings before and after they happen. The next step is to get them to collaborate and contribute.\n\nPart 3: Generating strategic value from sales reps\n\nNow you know how to get reps to buy in and feel engaged during sales meetings.\n\nThe question is, how do you turn that engagement into strategic value?\n\nPeople want to find ways to add value. Top performers are especially keen to share new ideas to make their own jobs easier and generate more results. Ultimately when they bring these ideas to the table, everyone benefits.\n\nFor reps that don’t see the value in sharing their perspective, Anthony Iannarino of The Sales Blog provides some compelling motivation:\n\n“Engagement is a sign of professionalism.\n\n“Some of your peers won’t be engaged in the meeting or the topic, unless it is, say, compensation or something about which they can commiserate and complain.\n\n“Your engagement, your questions, your comments, your thoughts, and your experiences will also benefit others. It demonstrates your professionalism, and it demonstrates your leadership.”\n\nLet’s take a look at five techniques to encourage participation and drive more value from your reps during sales meetings.\n\nWork the room\n\nThat’s right, sell collaboration to your reps just like you would a prospect. Use your own sales skills to demonstrate the value they’ll receive by bringing value themselves.\n\nStart by having them make micro-investments. This could be as simple as saying “yes” to a question.\n\nAnother way is to introduce new concepts and let them own these ideas. Do this by providing a “seed” idea, encouraging feedback. Then, ask questions that drive them to the idea you want them to “own”.\n\nFor example, you may want them to own the concept of bringing new sales lead generation ideas to each weekly meeting. The seed for this idea might be, “how can we generate more of our own highly qualified leads?”\n\nAs people provide their own ideas, begin creating the processes around them and delegate accordingly.\n\nBake interactivity into your meetings\n\nA great way to encourage reps to bring value is by getting them involved in the entire process.\n\nThis includes the preparation of the meeting as well as the team meeting agendas. By doing this, they’ll take full ownership of their “segment” of the meeting.\n\nAnother approach is to get people working in pairs or groups. Build a workshop format into your meeting and get each team working on a specific problem.\n\nAllocate a segment of your meeting to this challenge. Once completed, get each team to share their own ideas.\n\nBefore you know it, you’ll have people discussing and contributing to each other’s ideas.\n\nOf course, you could always keep it simple with a Q&A session. Lead reps to a specific idea or challenge. Ask questions around them and encourage feedback.\n\nPrepare for negotiation\n\nNegotiation is simply part of life as a salesperson.\n\nIt’s also going to happen in your sales meetings.\n\nDon’t just prepare for negotiation, encourage it.\n\nDo this by starting off with smaller issues. These are the things that require little debate. This will get your reps primed for tackling more major issues as you get to them.\n\nWhen reaching those larger issues, make sure you have prepared your “big idea”. Don’t start off small, go straight in for the bigger ideas. But make it clear that compromise is inevitable and everyone will leave satisfied with the end result.\n\nWith that in mind, make sure you’re prepared with data and insights that fuel these decisions. This will allow you to lead sales reps towards the most logical idea that leads to the best results.\n\nNo matter what, always be prepared to compromise.\n\nLead to inclusive decisions\n\nFinally, make sure any decisions are made as a majority.\n\nIf you don’t believe everyone is on board, then take a vote. This will encourage further participation and prime reps to continue this behavior in future, productive meetings.\n\nWhen holding a vote, only offer a handful of options. The fewer the options, the less your reps will have to think, which will lead to speedy decision-making.\n\nPart 4: The anatomy of weekly and bi-weekly meetings\n\nMany of the ideas presented in this guide only apply to one-off or training-oriented sales meeting topics.\n\nBut what about the all-important forecast and pipeline health meetings?\n\nAs Jeff Gitomer says:\n\nSales meetings should be a forum for reporting, goal achievement assistance, encouragement, problem solving, training, sharing, and communication. The purpose of a sales meeting is to get the sales staff primed and pumped to sell.\n\nLet’s look closer at the two most common sales meetings: the weekly forecast and bi-weekly pipeline meetings.\n\nRunning weekly forecast meetings\n\nTypically, your weekly forecast meeting agenda should include:\n\nDeal stage progress\n\nThe previous week deals closed\n\nCurrent week forecasted deals to close\n\nEach of your sales reps must go through these three steps. The purpose of the meeting is for each attendee to share what they achieved the previous week, which includes deals closed and sales activities that moved other deals further “down the line”.\n\nSales activity updates should be “input-based”. In other words, the number of calls, emails, and follow-ups each rep achieved the previous week.\n\nYour forecast meetings should occur on the same day and time every week. Ideally, you’ll hold these face to face. Video conference calls can also work, especially if you work within an “inside sales” organization or you’re managing a remote sales team.\n\nFor those with long sales cycles, weekly meetings may be too much. For example, if your sales cycle is between 6 to 12 months, a bi-weekly or even monthly forecast meeting may be more appropriate.\n\nSales forecast metrics\n\nFor your weekly meetings, keep reviewable KPIs to a minimum.\n\nHere are the three key metrics that your teams should be reporting on:\n\nDeal activities. Each rep gives an update on activities that are moving leads to the next deal stage. For example, an update on follow-up email activity that will take deals from the proposal stage to negotiation.\n\nConversion metrics. These provide insights on conversion rates that lead opportunities from one stage of the funnel to another. For example, the number of cold emails that lead to appointments.\n\nDeals won and lost. Each rep provides an update on which deals were closed the previous week, including the total value of each deal and total deals. They should also provide an update on why certain deals were lost, an area that can be used to brainstorm new ideas for future meetings.\n\nThe importance of a bi-weekly pipeline meeting\n\nYour weekly sales meeting provides an update on what’s at the end of the pipeline. The bi-weekly pipeline meeting, in contrast, covers overall pipeline health.\n\nThis includes ensuring a healthy number of qualified leads entering the top of the pipeline.\n\nHere, it’s your job as the sales manager to lead the meeting. It’s advised that you invite sales reps, account managers and marketers to this meeting, as the overall activity affects their day-to-day roles.\n\nIf you’re using an external agency to generate new leads and sales opportunities, get them involved in this process. Depending on your organizational structure, a conference video call might be more convenient for all involved.\n\nThere’s only one “true north” objective for these meetings: generating new leads.\n\nWithout new leads, the first stage of your sales pipeline will look empty. It’s up to everyone involved to ensure there’s a regular, fresh batch of leads entering your pipeline.\n\nHere’s how everyone can contribute:\n\nSales reps. Focus on the lead-generating activities they already have power over. This can include cold calling, email outreach, and social selling. Hold separate meetings to brainstorm and review processes. Make sure everyone is empowered and enabled to do their best work.\n\nMarketing executives. What new initiatives are they testing and which marketing activities are bringing in the highest quality leads? Integrate your marketing automation and sales stack to help you double down on your most profitable channels.\n\nAccount managers. Account managers are talking to your customers on a daily basis. Are there opportunities to generate new leads from existing customers? Account managers are in a perfect situation to generate referrals. Help them do this as effectively as possible.\n\nAs for your agenda, start with marketing’s contribution to the pipeline. This should measure the number of fresh sales leads generated over the last two weeks against your target.\n\nAsk them to segment these results by each of their marketing activities. This includes paid media, content marketing and social media channels.\n\nYour reps should also cover the number of leads they’ve added to the pipeline against their target. These include cold calling and any referrals they’ve received from their customer-facing relationships.\n\nFrom here, cover the overall health of the pipeline. Do this by reporting on metrics such as average deal size, win rate and average sales cycle.\n\nFinally, allow each party to bring new ideas to the table. Before your meeting, talk to your reps about any ideas they have that involve collaboration with marketing or account managers. Collect these ideas and present them in this bi-weekly meeting, giving credit where it’s due.\n\nFour Steps to Finding the Right Leads Fast\n\nMake instant improvements to your lead qualification process with this four-step guide full of actionable sales advice.\n\nWork email\n\nTick for more of our best how-to guides, templates and ebooks via email\n\nYour data is processed according to our privacy notice.

It’s a great sales strategy.\n\nAs Alice Heiman puts it:\n\nSales role-play offers the only way to practice positioning, presenting and moving a sale forward in a controlled environment. Because of this, it is a critical aspect of skill improvement. Sales managers can help to alleviate much of the dislike that salespeople feel for role-playing by joining in, and fostering an environment of constructive feedback.\n\nBefore the meeting itself, provide a scenario that reps should be prepared to role-play. For example, dealing with argumentative prospects or embarrassing sales moments.\n\nEven better, ask reps to prepare as both the salesperson and the prospect. Then, pair reps up together and have them take turns to give their pitch.\n\nNot only is this a fun way of encouraging interaction, but everyone comes away with fresh ideas on how to improve their pitch.\n\nIdea 2: Provide mini training sessions\n\nAdd value to your teams by training them on specific skills or ideas.\n\nDemonstrate how to improve in a certain area with the following approaches:\n\nCreate a framework. Every training program needs a structure. Create a three- to five-step framework that shows reps how to take action on what you’re teaching.\n\nProvide examples. Share stories from your own experiences, as well as third-party examples that demonstrate these concepts in action.\n\nRole-play. Get your reps to experiment and practice these new skills on each other.\n\nSales careers are always evolving and expanding. Ensure you’re providing your reps with the best support by holding regular training sessions.\n\nIdea 3: Setting career goals\n\nOn that note, your salespeople should have a strong idea of where they want to take their career.\n\nHelp them build this clarity by holding goal-setting sessions. Show them what their options are and provide insights and feedback on the path to achieving them.\n\nFor example, they may want to become a sales manager themselves someday. Show them what you did to achieve this, how the landscape has changed and what they must prepare to get there.\n\nOf course, goals can be extremely personal. Don’t force anyone to share any dreams they’re not comfortable making public.
