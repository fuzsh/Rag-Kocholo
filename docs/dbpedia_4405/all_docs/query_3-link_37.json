        "text": "Founders Factory was launched in 2015 with a mission to power founders to go further, faster. To date we have built more than 60 startups and invested in a further 150 across offices in London, Johannesburg and New York. FF has a team of over 100 full-time operators and its portfolio has raised more than $600m in capital.\n\nIn our Studio, we partner up with our corporate backers to create entirely new venture-backable concepts from scratch, always bringing an unfair advantage. Once investment is released into a concept, we start looking for promising and passionate founders to turn the concept into a fully fledged MVP and ultimately spin out into a fully fledged business.\n\nProject Kevin is one of the first concepts in the Mission Studio. In partnership with Nesta, our goal in the Mission Studio is to build the next generation of mission-led startups.\n\nWhatâ€™s Project Kevin?\n\nThere are ~26 million leaky properties in the UK, of which ~3.2 million are owned by private landlords. RENEW will help solve this problem by:\n\n1) Buying leaky properties (EPC D or less) for cash or option to trade in property for credits to purchase a more energy efficient property.\n\n2) Renew then retrofits properties, instals smart-tech and upgrades to have a sought after modern feel.\n\nðŸ‘€ The Impact\n\n1) Driving the pace of carbon reduction.\n\nWe will set the pace for retrofitting UK housing stock; ensuring quality â€˜whole houseâ€™ retrofits that maximise rapid carbon reduction more cost effectively. We estimate that at scale; 64K+ houses we will save ~442m kgCO2/year. Renew will act as a the catalyst for:\n\na) Creating market for low carbon homes\n\nb)Creating the sustained demand to develop the supply chain and infrastructure to retrofit at scale\n\nc)Enabling manufactures to ramp up and reduce cost\n\n2) Improving the quality of private rental housing.\n\nThe private rental sector homes make up a disproportionate number of fuel poor households (18% v 9% owner-occupied)*. Through renewing leaky rental housing stock we will be targeting two of the root causes of fuel poverty: high energy bills and energy inefficient homes.\n\nThe Role\n\nAs the Founder & CEO you will be responsible for:\n\nLeading the investment story for this capital-intensive business Attracting and leading a world-class founding team Identifying and activating partnerships that will enable us to scale rapidly Setting a clear vision for the business and executing on it\n\nAs the Founder & CEO weâ€™ll look to assess on:\n\nObsession towards contributing toward decarbonising UK homes Experience of raising capital (doesnâ€™t have to be VC) Passion for building & leading a venture-backable business Desire to make an impact and do so through entrepreneurship Ability to inspire and lead effectively Communication & Storytelling to diverse audiences Grittiness - ability to stay the course when it gets hard and know when to pivot at pace Experience thriving in ambiguous environments Empathy and Self Reflection - able to understand the perspective of others and evaluate own thinking Coachability - you have strong opinions loosely held\n\nNice to haves:\n\nYou know the real estate industry well & can quickly navigate it Youâ€™ve successfully taken something from idea to market Youâ€™ve had an operational role in a well-capitalised startup\n\nWhatâ€™s in it for you?\n\nWe have spent years perfecting a platform that shortcuts and de-risks building a business from scratch. We bring together bold ideas, exceptional operators, capital, a directly invested corporate partner plus our network to give you the best chance of building the next Unicorn (that matters!).\n\nYou'll get:\n\nIn 6 months, we'll help you validate, build and launch an MVP. You'll be allocated a Â£50K budget to cover your salary Once we've launched your product, we'll incorporate your venture as an independent company and invest Â£200K into your new business Youâ€™ll get dedicated hands-on operational support from a team of smart and passionate people across design, engineering, product, growth marketing, talent, fundraising, legal, and strategic partnerships Unparalleled access to our corporate partners and wider network (for life!) Office space, co-located with other companies and our team A unique opportunity to build a business that will scale and make an impact\n\nWe are committed to building a diverse culture and are eager to receive applications from all backgrounds.
