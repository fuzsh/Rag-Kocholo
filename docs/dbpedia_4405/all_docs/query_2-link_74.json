In collaboration with the Conceptboard team, I can design new processes and structures for my customers in an appealing way – whether in face-to-face, online or hybrid concepts.\n\nUrsula Hesselmann\n\nBased in the Allgäu, Ursula Hesselmann supports companies during change and is an expert in interpersonal relationships.\n\nHesselmann Consulting & Training\n\nConceptboard has become the virtual space where we meet for collaboration. Thanks to the impulses from the individual teams, it is now the central platform for creative collaboration and efficient teamwork in our company, and it is indispensable.\n\nRead Case Study\n\nHandan Kartal\n\nLead Product Owner Digital Workplace & Smart Collaboration\n\nEnBW\n\nWith the introduction of Conceptboard, we have taken a significant step towards achieving our goals for the Ki:GO movement: participation, self-learning, and new non-hierarchical forms of work. We can advance the digitalization of administration both internally and together with the citizens of Kiel.\n\nRead Case Study\n\nJesko-Alexander Zychski\n\nDeputy Chief Digital Officer\n\nCity of Kiel\n\nConceptboard, as a digital whiteboard, best supports the digital cultural transformation in administrations with its functionality and provided templates.\n\nRead Case Study\n\nFranziska Rimmele\n\nDigital Coach Ki:Go Initiative\n\nCity of Kiel\n\nThe partner program is a great opportunity to incorporate my experience from supporting my customers into the further development of Conceptboard. Conceptboard is the ideal program for creating teamwork online and hybrid. Trainings, workshops and project work can be implemented perfectly.\n\nUwe Schettler\n\nBorn in Kiel, he accompanies teams during change processes and is an expert for (visual) moderation of online workshops.\n\nConsultant and Illustrator | MODERATIO Business Moderation\n\nWe were surprised with how quickly our teams were able to seamlessly adopt Conceptboard into their workflow. Conceptboard makes the entire collaboration process fluid, saving us time and resources so we can be as environmentally sustainable as possible.\n\nRead case study\n\nIsaac Korn\n\nDirector of Innovation\n\nPerry Ellis International\n\nConceptboard makes it easy and simple to manage our packaging review process. It quickly became our favorite Marcom tool; it allowed us to collaborate with the different departments involved, and it helped improve the quality and consistency of our brand.\n\nElianne Garay\n\nSr. Marketing Operations Manager\n\nCorsair\n\nAfter many tests of similar apps, Conceptboard is the clear winner for me. Thanks to the “infinite” screen, it enables me to present complex projects of large and small customers in a perfectly clear manner.\n\nDominic Pfeffer\n\nFounder\n\nHeldenmacher.at"
