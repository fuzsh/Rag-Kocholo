        "text": "Overview\n\nAt CISA, partnership and collaboration are our foundation and the lifeblood of what we do. Information sharing and cooperative action – across both public and private sectors – is essential to our goal of raising the nation’s collective defense. The private sector owns and operates a majority of our nation's critical infrastructure, and partnerships between the public and private sectors that foster trust and effective coordination are essential to maintaining critical infrastructure security and resilience. Through these partnerships, we facilitate a team environment where two-way information sharing of critical threat information, risk mitigation, and other vital information and resources is quick, seamless and actionable. This mutual commitment to information sharing through our trusted partnerships is essential to the protection of critical infrastructure and to furthering cybersecurity for the nation.\n\nCISA’s Role\n\nAs the national coordinator for critical infrastructure security and resilience, CISA has developed and implemented numerous information sharing programs to promote resources and tools that help our partners build security and resilience. These programs include awareness and outreach campaigns like the annual Cybersecurity Awareness Month (CAM) and broader national awareness programs that offer partner toolkits. Through these programs, CISA develops and shares substantive information with the private sector and with state, local, tribal, and territorial governments.\n\nRecognizing cybersecurity threat actors are not constrained by geographic boundaries, CISA fosters relationships with international partners to promote collaborative information sharing, cybersecurity best practices, and partnership models across the globe."
