        "text": "Anyone involved in the government contracting process can tell you that bid protests cause a great deal of anxiety. From the stress caused by the ding on performance evaluations to the automatic stay and the loss of revenue, neither the government nor private industry view a bid protest as a positive.\n\nChange is inevitable in any organization, and federal agencies are no exception. From budget cuts to technological advancements, many factors can significantly change how a federal agency operates.\n\nIn this post, we will explore what change management is, how it can enable individual change, and how federal managers can effectively lead their teams through change. We will also discuss how Management Concepts’ federal training and professional development programs can help managers navigate change management more efficiently.\n\nWhat’s changed for you in the last year? A boss or colleague left your organization? New government restrictions changed how you do your job? Your team implemented a new process? It wouldn’t matter if you read those lines today, ten years ago, or even a century ago. Largely, they’re the same concerns we face virtually every year. Humans don’t react well to change, so these concerns mean that we have foreboding cultural angst that manifests itself as plain old worry."
