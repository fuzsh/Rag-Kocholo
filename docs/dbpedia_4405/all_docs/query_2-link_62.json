        "text": "Today’s business leaders want to empower their organizations with an ability to constantly innovate new offerings to get to market, drive continuous operational improvement, and speed growth across the entire breadth of their enterprises.\n\nIn AWS 2022 C-Suite Report: Cloud Enabled Growth, a comprehensive survey of 1,500 executives across 15 markets and 10 industries, it was found that more than half of today’s executives report prioritizing business growth in their corporate strategy. This includes rapidly innovating across their existing business as well as creating new customer value, revenue streams, and growth opportunity.\n\nEnsuring agility and speed across teams is crucial for successful growth and digital transformation, but is often difficult to realize. Legacy organizational structures may not lend themselves to a pace aimed at accelerating innovation. Enterprises that are initially agile can also strain as the scope of their business grows, becoming bogged down in process and decision-making as the business expands and becomes more complex.\n\nCompanies are becoming increasingly global. Products and services are becoming completely digital. Through it all, customer expectations are getting higher as they gain the power of information and choice.\n\nHaving the ability to keep up with this pace of change while at the same time responding to market opportunities and disruptions requires business agility. IT leaders who take a customer centric approach can create the conditions in which that can happen.\n\nThe concept of Amazon’s two-pizza teams is straightforward: no team should be big enough that it would take more than two pizzas to feed them. Putting aside the number or the nature of toppings (we don’t have time and space to solve the “does pineapple belong on pizza?” debate here), ideally, this is a team of less than 10 people: smaller teams minimize lines of communication and decrease overhead of bureaucracy and decision-making. This allows two-pizza teams to spend more time focusing on their customers, and constantly experimenting and innovating on their behalf – the biggest priority of high-performing teams at Amazon.\n\nThe governance and management of teams must provide “guardrails” – mechanisms that allow teams to run fast and make high-quality, high-velocity decisions – rather than “tollgates” that impede speed by swelling lines of approval or coordination before allowing teams to progress with innovative experiments.\n\nAt Amazon and AWS, the role of single-threaded leaders is vital in instituting the right level of oversight to retain a team’s empowerment to innovate independently on behalf of their customers, while creating consistent mechanisms that allow the right level of inspection and directional vision. Single-threaded leaders help provide a strategic vision – and then get out of their team’s way. Team leaders need to help remove obstacles as opposed to being a barrier through which all decisions need to pass through. Small, agile, autonomous teams who obsess over their customers every day are the foremost subject matter experts on their service and customer segment.\n\nSingle-threaded leaders need to preserve their team’s autonomy to make the best decisions for the business. Single-threaded leaders’ involvement in their team’s decision-making is most often to help guide the team in situations where, even with the right data instrumentation and highest judgement, the path forward may not be clear.\n\nOne mechanism used at Amazon to facilitate a single-threaded leader’s oversight at these checkpoints are written narratives. Narratives in these circumstances help outline the customer-facing problem that has surfaced; brings information from deep analysis and data that the team gathered to inform next steps; and articulates the decision the team recommends, along with alternate paths considered and the risks and benefits of each of those paths.\n\nWhile taking the time to write a narrative may seem counterintuitive to maintaining speed and constant execution, the use of narratives across Amazon and AWS has driven extraordinary benefits. One is that these documents are often highly debated and refined by the team, its stakeholders, and subject matter experts of the team’s offering and customer segment even before it lands on an executive’s desk. This fosters collaboration and diverse perspectives, challenges assumptions, and serves to refine the ideas and recommendations within the document. Ultimately, this often leads to higher quality decisions.\n\nBeing deliberate about team structure, and how that structure optimizes teams’ ability to leverage its technical architecture (and vice versa) can help drive flexibility, agility, and speed to market of new innovations that meet customer need. Cloud microservices leveraged by teams that are more decoupled from dependencies and constraint (both technical and administrative) allow them to respond more rapidly to changes in the market, and iterate based on lessons learned.\n\nSeeking to drive more single-threaded focus for teams by simplifying and rationalizing the problems each team is asked to solve can accelerate innovation and allow teams to spend more time understanding their customers and inventing on their behalf."
