Founded a decade ago by Jeff Zalaznick, Mario Carbone, and Rich Torrisi, MFG has established a global empire that today exceeds forty restaurants, private clubs, bars, and hotels, along the way setting a new standard for the industry.\n\nAmong the brand’s numerous iconic concepts—which represent the pinnacle of experiential luxury in cities from New York and Las Vegas to Paris and Hong Kong—are Carbone, The Grill, Torrisi, ZZ’s Club, The Newbury Hotel, Villa Miami, etc. While each brand this creative force brings to life is distinct, they all reflect MFG’s refined, celebratory, and thoroughly contemporary approach to its craft."
