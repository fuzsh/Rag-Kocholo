        "text": "Tell us a bit about yourself & Dance Concepts.\n\nI started Dance Concepts about 8 years ago because I had this huge passion for dance and wanted to share it with as many people as possible. I knew there was space in rural Ireland for creative dance classes that taught children new skills and provided them with a safe and supported environment to be creative, make friends and have fun! In the past 8 years we have expanded into new communities in Galway and Cork with many more openings in the next few months. I have stepped away from the teaching roll and more into the business management side of things which definitely has it's challenges.\n\nDance Concepts believes in inspiring confidence & creativity through movement. Can you tell us a bit more about this approach and the positive effect you’ve seen in your students as a result?\n\nOur approach is child-centred. Everyone you meet will learn things a little differently but the majority of children will learn and gain confidence from praise. We focus on the good, we tell them when they are doing something well, we encourage them to push themselves and celebrate each and every win! We have had children who suffer from anxiety and won't attend school come to our classes and return to school within a couple of days, other children come to us so shy and self-conscious but within a couple of months are up on stage beaming!\n\nRunning a dance school that puts emphasis on a building a love of movement within it’s students must come from having a love of movement and dance yourself. Can you tell us about how your love of dance inspired you to start your own dance school?\n\nI have loved dancing for as long as I can remember! I began classes at the age of 3, I have tried every style but my favourite has to be Musical Theatre. Something about being up on stage and performing always brings a certain buzz with it. I love the energy rush of the nerves and excitement that comes from putting something that you have created out into the world. The best way to do that was to share it with others, to have others experience that rush and to help them achieve that and put out their best selves into the world.\n\nInstilling confidence in your students is a big part of the Dance Concepts approach, what is your advice on gaining confidence as a business owner?\n\nI think the most important thing is to gain self confidence in yourself too. It is something I struggle with and some days you feel like you are on top of the world, your vision is super clear, you can see you are on the right path and everything makes sense, other days you can feel like the world is against you, the smallest thing can knock you and nothing makes sense. I think if you can make your vision clear and lean into the powerful days, try to stay consistent with healthy habits (fresh air, drink water, exercise, meditate) hopefully the darker days will become less and less. When they do arrive, accept that it is going to be a slower day, set aside a few tasks and get them done and know that the stronger days will come.\n\nWhat is your favourite part about running Dance Concepts?\n\nMy favourite part is when I see that what we do has made a difference in people's lives. When a child who struggles with anxiety gets up and performs for people, and feels amazing afterwards, when another child, who has had physical health struggles, masters that one step they've been focused on. When a community comes together to move and stays afterwards for the cup of tea and chats. When a group of teenagers works together to create a piece of art to put out into the world. Seeing the small changes in people from week to week within our classes. It is such a fulfilling job."
