Subscribe now.\n\nArt Basel Switzerland will debut a concept shop with Colette founder Sarah Andelman.\n\nArt Basel is launching a new concept store at its 2024 Swiss edition in collaboration with Sarah Andelman, co-founder of the former Parisian store Colette. Opening on June 11, the Art Basel Shop will feature a curated selection of limited-edition lifestyle products and collectibles that celebrate Art Basel’s visual history. This venture marks Art Basel’s first foray into owned product design and distribution, which aims to enhance engagement with its community and create more opportunities for artists. The store will showcase items developed with artists like Christine Sun Kim and offer exclusive products such as artist-themed baby rattles and jigsaw puzzles.\n\nHawaii’s Turtle Bay Resort sells for $725 million with plans to become a Ritz-Carlton.\n\nHawaii’s Turtle Bay Resort, famous for its appearances in more than 150 films and TV shows, will soon become a Ritz-Carlton. Host Hotels & Resorts purchased the resort from Blackstone Real Estate for $680 million, with plans to transition management to Marriott. The sale includes the 450-room resort and 1,300 acres of beachfront property. Blackstone, which bought Turtle Bay for $332 million in 2018 and renovated it extensively, has also completed a separate deal for 65 acres with Areté Collective for new development.\n\nThe Marlboro Agricultural Education Center by Studio Gang breaks ground in Brooklyn.\n\nConstruction has started on the $18.2 million Marlboro Agricultural Education Center (MAEC) in Gravesend, Brooklyn, designed by Studio Gang. The 9,900-square-foot building will include community gathering spaces and a rooftop greenhouse for raising fish and plants, aiming to improve food security. Partners in the project include NYCHA, NYC Department of Design and Construction, The Campaign Against Hunger, and city officials. The MAEC, which is targeting LEED Gold certification, will offer education, job training, and sustainable food production programs, while utilizing the new Design-Build project delivery method to expedite construction.\n\nZero Bond has been facing resistance in its attempt to open a branch in East Hampton.\n\nZero Bond, a members-only club in Lower Manhattan, is facing resistance in its attempt to open a branch in East Hampton, Long Island. Founder Scott Sartiano aims to lease the Hedges Inn, but town officials and residents are opposing the move due to potential noise and exclusivity concerns. East Hampton Village recently enacted a law requiring restaurants in the historic district to close by 11 PM, which would impact Zero Bond’s business. Despite ongoing negotiations, Sartiano has not yet signed a lease or obtained a liquor license, and local sentiment remains largely against the club’s presence.\n\nChristie’s faces a class action lawsuit after hackers leaked its clients’ personal data.\n\nA cyberattack on Christie’s auction house has led to a class action lawsuit filed in the Southern District of New York, alleging failure to protect the personal data of at least 500,000 bidders. Plaintiff Efstathios Maroulis is seeking damages and demands improved data security measures from Christie’s. The hackers, RansomHub, threatened to release stolen data unless paid, but the deadline passed without action. The lawsuit highlights potential identity theft risks and criticizes Christie’s inadequate response and communication following the breach."
