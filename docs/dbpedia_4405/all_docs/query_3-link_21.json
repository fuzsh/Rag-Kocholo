        "text": "I am the founder of Concept Discovery learning centre. I am passionate about nurturing young minds and fostering a love for learning. My education background is diverse and robust, equipping me with a unique blend of skills to support and inspire my students.\n\nMy business degree offers a strategic perspective on education management and curriculum development, allowing me to implement innovative and efficient teaching methodologies.\n\n​\n\nAdditionally, I hold certification in phonics and creative writing, enabling me to create engaging and effective literacy programs. My training in child psychology and basic counselling provides me with the tools to understand and support the emotional and developmental needs of my students, ensuring a nuturing and inclusive learning environment.\n\n​\n\nMy approach to teaching is holistic and student-centered, focusing on building not just academic skills but also confidence, creativity, and emotional well-being. I believe in the power of personalized learning experiences that cater to each child’s unique needs and strengths.\n\nMy teaching journey begins from 2011. I had taught in several well-known learning centres and helped small-medium enterprises to manage their learning centres. Till date, I have helped over 70+ students and never looked back since then!\n\nThe decision to pursue the education industry was purely due to the love of interacting with young children. Soon, this love of mine grew stronger when I came to realise how fulfilling it is to educate the younger generation. I get to craft my own lesson plans and witnessed the impact of injecting fun and joy during lesson time.\n\nAfter becoming a mother in the year 2017, it affirms my decision to stay in the education line. I wanted to reach out to more children to create positive impact in their studies. At the same time, I would be able to share these experiences with my child. My aim is to make sure they grow to love learning and reduce stress in learning.\n\nBeing able to educate the children in their growing years is truly meaningful to me when the students have benefitted from my teaching. One of my greatest moments was when the students are able to understand what they have learnt and use the strategies which I have taught them.\n\nThrough my 13 years of experience in the education industry, I have helped students to thrive in their academics in smaller class size groups. Having smaller class size truly allows me to have greater control of time and the flexibility to use a wide range of teaching strategies to cater to different students with varied learning abilities."
