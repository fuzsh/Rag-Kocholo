This diversified operating model allows for the effective management and coordination of the Virgin Group’s portfolio of investments. Virgin Management provides shared administrative functions across Investment Management and Brand Licensing, and also provides the services of a head office and central support for the Virgin Group and Virgin Unite.\n\nBrand Licensing\n\nVEL Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries, principally Virgin Enterprises Limited, license the Virgin brand through trademark license agreements with companies to use the Virgin brand. These include both companies which form part of the Virgin Group (Investee Businesses), as well as companies in which the Virgin Group holds no ownership interest (Licensees). The infographic below summarises the Investee Businesses and Licensees and where they are based.\n\nFor over 50 years, the Virgin brand has been renowned for providing unique and exceptional customer experiences. Each Virgin branded company brings a fresh, innovative and distinctive consumer proposition, shaking up the status quo to create businesses that lift experiences out of the ordinary. This clear focus on the consumer has given the brand the ability to expand into new sectors and new geographies. From Virgin Money’s unique customer store concepts to Virgin Red’s fresh perspective on rewards and how Virgin Voyages is set to re-invent the cruising experience - each Investee Business and Licensee strives to put the customer experience at its heart.\n\nVirgin’s brand purpose is Changing Business For Good."
