        "text": "Ever since she was little, Helah was following in her father’s footsteps. She followed him around his restaurants in Manhattan, along with his passion for food, people, and community. Those who worked for him were more than employees—they were family. Through them, she learned the importance of belonging and creating a place for people to call their own.\n\nAfter earning her business degree from Boston University and years of working in both nonprofit and for-profit organizations, she had found her passion. From coordinating fundraising events for Comedy Cures to boutique photo shoots for fashion editorials, the common thread was logistics. She loved everything that went into organizing an event: connecting people, discovering new locations, and putting her all into making the impossible happen.\n\nNaturally, a light bulb flickered above her head—literally. Her father had been an avid collector of Edison bulbs. The transparent bulb was found throughout his restaurants because he loved the warm vibe it created and was fascinated by the mechanics. Every single function was visible, indispensable, and working in perfect harmony. After his passing, Helah knew she wanted to continue his legacy by creating a lightbulb of her own. A place where people can truly belong, while shedding light on their individual talents, beliefs, and personalities.\n\nWhat began as a home business has now grown into a million-dollar company that owns and operates event spaces across Manhattan and employs a dedicated team of experts, including some of those who have worked for her father. Offering catering, event planning and production services in-house, JPO has quickly gained a reputation as a down to earth event company with a single mission in mind: ensuring people enjoy the planning process and the people they work with, as much as the event itself."
