        "text": "The Playa Bowls™ concept is the vision of founders Robert Giuliani & Abby Taylor — both Jersey Shore natives & long time surfers. Abby grew up in Ocean Township surfing the beaches of Monmouth County, while Rob grew up surfing in Ocean County. They were inspired by chasing summer on surf trips to Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico, California & Hawaii. Almost every exotic surf town they visited offered their own unique version of an acai or pitaya bowl. They decided to recreate their favorite recipes with their own twist at home at the Jersey Shore.\n\nThey made a deal with the owner of the pizza shop they lived above on 8th Avenue in Belmar, NJ. They bought a blender, a patio table, a fridge & a freezer and set up a makeshift pop up stand on the sidewalk in front of the pizza shop. They spent a lot of time & effort telling their story and educating customers on the benefits of acai. As word spread of this creative & intuitive pop up stand, more & more people stood in line on the side of Ocean Avenue to see what Playa Bowls was all about. Rob & Abby realized it was time to take their growing business to the next level. Fast forward nine years & here we are, sharing our story & passion at over 200 stores nation wide."
