The ACI staff, from the president to the customer service team is approachable, available and extremely responsive to our needs. In summary, their superior customer service and personalized attention has allowed us to meet and exceed our business goals.”\n\n“It is the people at ACI that really set them apart from other administrators. They are trustworthy, knowledgeable, innovative, astute, technical, highly responsive and above all … caring. We hold our partnership with ACI in the highest regard. In all honesty, we could write a book on our admiration for you all.”\n\n“We are extremely satisfied with our working relationship with ACI. ACI has provided helpful, reliable, and efficient service during our partnership, and we are continually impressed with ACI employees' prompt communication on a wide variety of matters. ACI has provided excellent service to our team and staff and students.”\n\n“ACI is a true business partner. They’ve taken the time to understand our business and have immersed themselves as part of our team. This partnership has allowed us to grow and thrive in our business.”\n\n“We had ACI step in on a large block of accident medical customers under difficult circumstances, and they exceeded every expectation we had. Payment accuracy, timeliness, and outstanding customer service turned what we expected to be a stressful service transition into a major customer plus for us. I have been in this business for a little over 40 years, and would recommend ACI to anyone without hesitation.“\n\n“…my personal thanks for all of the support ACI has provided over these many years. You have once again cemented a loyal relationship due to your first rate service.”\n\n“I just want to let you both know how much I appreciate the job ACI has done in getting our claims straightened out! I know it has not been easy, and we are still not finished, but you have both been responsive and patient and I believe I am seeing that light at the end of the tunnel and it is not an oncoming train!”\n\n‘We've worked with countless clients and TPAs to provide COBRA Administration to companies over the last 19 years. ACI stands at the top of our business partner list for professionalism and integrity. ACI provides easy implementation procedures and work flows for the clients and vendors. Their reporting of information is always timely and accurate. The element of ACI that is most impressive to us is the staff. Every person at ACI that we have dealt with truly cares about doing the right thing, producing the best outcome and providing great service. Dedicated people make a good Company great and ACI is a great company.”"
