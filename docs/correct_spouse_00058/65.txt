Isabella Leong, who parented three children out of wedlock with Hong Kong-based Internet and telecom tycoon Richard Li, said in a statement on Saturday that she had broken up with Li.

Leong added she and Li will "raise our children together."

The statement, issued to Hong Kong media and reported by Sina.com, began by saying "My life has entered a new period with the arrival of 2011... We had a wonderful time together. Our children will be raised by us together."

The statement did not mention a monetary settlement.

In July, the former Hong Kong actress gave birth to twin boys in San Francisco. Li's eldest son Ethan, also with Leong, was born in 2009 in Canada.

Richard Li is the youngest son of Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's richest person.

According to Forbes Rich List 2010, Li Ka-shing is the 14th richest person worldwide with assets of US$21 billion. His son was estimated to have assets of US$1.4 billion.
