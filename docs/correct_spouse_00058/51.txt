Isabella Leong (梁洛施) is most remembered for her four-years relationship with the businessman and the mogul Li Ka Shing’s (李嘉誠) second son, Richard Li (李澤楷). Isabella and Richard gave birth to three children, but the couple separated before getting married. Never having been accepted by the Li family, Isabella and her children reportedly will not be receiving any of Li Ka Shing’s inheritance.

According to Hong Kong’s media, Li Ka Shing’s $300 billion Hong Kong dollar assets will be split between his eldest son Victor Li and second son Richard, while the remainder will reside in a family trust. While Victor’s family was also named as the beneficiary, Isabella’s children are left out of the inheritance and they will not be receiving a single cent.

Many Hong Kong netizens expressed their pity that Isabella was treated so harshly. Other netizens suggested that Isabella would not have to worry about her standard of living because Richard was rumored to have gifted Isabella $100 million HKD for each of their children.

Despite the situation, Isabella revealed that she never regretted having children with someone she loved. Instead, Isabella is living her life on her own terms and returned to acting in 2020’s film Love After Love <第一爐香>. As the single mother keeps a low profile on her private life, she would not share pictures of her children and would only post tidbits of her daily life.
