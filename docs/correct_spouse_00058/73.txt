Isabella Leong and Her Children Are Excluded from Li Ka Shing’s Inheritance

Isabella Leong (梁洛施) is most remembered for her four-years relationship with the businessman and the mogul Li Ka Shing’s (李嘉誠) second son, Richard Li (李澤楷). Isabella and Richard gave birth to three children, but the couple separated before getting married. Never having been accepted by the Li family, Isabella and her children reportedly will not be receiving any of Li Ka Shing’s inheritance.

According to Hong Kong’s media, Li Ka Shing’s $300 billion Hong Kong dollar assets will be split between his eldest son Victor Li and second son Richard, while the remainder will reside in a family trust. While Victor’s family was also named as the beneficiary, Isabella’s children are left out of the inheritance and they will not be receiving a single cent.

Many Hong Kong netizens expressed their pity that Isabella was treated so harshly. Other netizens suggested that Isabella would not have to worry about her standard of living because Richard was rumored to have gifted Isabella $100 million HKD for each of their children.

Despite the situation, Isabella revealed that she never regretted having children with someone she loved. Instead, Isabella is living her life on her own terms and returned to acting in 2020’s film Love After Love <第一爐香>. As the single mother keeps a low profile on her private life, she would not share pictures of her children and would only post tidbits of her daily life.

Already said in HK that is not alot. Some upper class apartment also cost more than that. Not even talking about landed property. You want to agree or disagree up to you.

Knowing HK people, they probably can't speak any other language fluently beside Cantonese and maybe Mandarin.

Only maybe if they are like T1 then maybe their parents send them oversea to study in other countries, they can speak other language.

People forgot that the money is given to Richard Li.

Richard Li's sons are from Isabella Leong only.

So, even if Li Kashing did not put them in his will, they will still inherit them from Richard Li.

If not, who is Richard Li going to give his money?

Isabella Leong can live comfortably until she die.

No matter what, his sons will inherit Li Kashing's empire indirectly.
