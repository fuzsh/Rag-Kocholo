        "text": "(Photo : Isabella Leong)\n\nSeptember 3rd, Taiwanese director Sylvia Chang held a press conference for her new film \"Niannian\" in Taipei. Three mysterious actors and actresses are officially unveiled finally. Zhang Xiaoquan, Ke Yulun and Isabella Leong will act the leading roles in the film as a powerful pugilist, a tour guide and an artist respectively.\n\nLike Us on Facebook\n\nIsabella Leong's comeback has drawn great attentions of Taiwanese media. She seems extremely nervous when being interviewed about her children and her feelings. Isabella Leong replied simply, saying her parents will take care of the babies during filming. Isabella Leong added she didn't quit acting. Then, there was an awkward silence in the press conference. Director Sylvia Chang broke the long silence and told the journalists that Isabella Leong was a wonderful mom. She not only loves acting, but also is a brave woman who is able to move forward from the past.\n\nIt is known a decade has passed since last time Director Sylvia Chang shot a film in Taiwan. This time, her new film \"Niannian\" is estimated to hit the big screen in next year's spring.\n\nReview: Isabella Leong's breakup with Richard Li two years ago\n\nIn 2008, when Isabella Leong began dating with Hong Kong magnate Richard Li, their relationship was likened to \"Prince and Cinderella\". One is the second son of the richest man in Asia, while the other is a poor girl who lost her father from childhood. They are two persons living in two different worlds. Though Isabella Leong gave birth to three babies for Richard Li, she still failed to marry into the rich family. Breakup is the only ending for their fairytale love story."
