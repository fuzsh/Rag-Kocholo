Isabella Leong and Richard Li broke up!\n\nB: Yeah. The end of another Cinderella fairy tale.\n\nA: Even if she married into the purple, she wouldnât be promised happiness. There are heaps of stories out there. Hollywood stars often marry singers, co-stars or other people who share their interest. That could make a happy marriage.\n\nB: I totally agree. By the way, âmarry into the purple?â\n\nA: You must have heard another saying â âborn into the purple,â which means âborn into a reigning family or privileged class.â\n\nB: So âmarry into the purpleâ means âmarry into a wealthy and privileged family?â\n\nA: Right. People also say âmarry into moneyâ or âmarry a fortune.â\n\nè®°ä½äºåï¼Marry into the purpleå°±æ¯âå«å ¥è±ªé¨âã"
