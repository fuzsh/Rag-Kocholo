        "text": "2.25 11:24 How is everybody? I am starting a microblog.\n\n2.25 14:37 I am Hu Xijin, chief editor of <Huanqiu Shibao>. I was in the army for 11 years. As a reporter, I covered the Serbian war and the Iraq war in the frontlines. I love my motherland. I know the hardship faced by this nation. As chief editor, I hope that <Huanqiu Shibao> can report the truth and not evade the sensitive issues. We want to use the sum total of all our reporting to show a complex world and an authentic, complex China.\n\n2.25 19:01 I thank you for your support. I say hello to you. Having lived for fifty years over various periods and places in China, even many foreign places, I came to know this nation of ours through the expressions and feelings of others. Today I have come to \"Weibo China.\" I was just thinking about what an interesting extension of Chinese civilization this is.\n\n2.26 00:11 I just finished work. I get off work every day around this time. I opened my new Sina.com Weibo page and I saw that I had more than 5,000 followers in half a day. This was truly astounding to me. I saw many comments, most of which are critical of me. Frankly, I was less shocked about the latter than about the number of followers. Someone told me this morning that I must be more open-minded on Weibo or else I should not bother coming. I thank every one of my commentators.\n\n2.26 00:13 I hope that Weibo can be a place for exchanging ideas and feelings.\n\n2.26 00:24 I respect the world of Weibo. Therefore I have come here to learn and to enrich my life. I also want to say to the people here that the \"world\" formed by the <Huanqiu Shibao> editors and reporters and their readers is one that is respected in the west. Many people in the world want to understand it. Therefore I recommend that people should learn more about it before they launch into their criticism of <Huanqiu Shibao>. I especially recommend that people who think that they are smart should learn to do that.\n\n2.26 00:35 I am the person who has the final say on every <Huanqiu Shibao> editorial essay. We have a small group. Everyday we set the topics for the editorial essays. The drafter has to call many experts to ask for their opinons. After the essay is drafted, it will be sent to different experts for their opinions. <Huanqiu Shibao> has several hundred special reporters and correspondents all over the world. Their knowledge and experiences are worthy for a whole book. Do you think that a newspaper like this is \"light weight\"?\n\n2.26 00:53 I am the chief editor of the Chinese edition of <Huanqiu Shibao>. At the same time, I am also the chief editor of the English version <Global Times>. Both newspapers are guided by the principle of telling the truth and not evading the sensitive issues. <Huanqiu Shibao> is moving forth. The reason why we have so many readers is that we seek the \"largest common denominator> among various ideas in Chinese society. We may not be doing great work, but we are sincerely trying. We never try to appease the public.\n\n2.26 01:00 Once again I thank those people who care about <Huanqiu Shibao>. I have read most of the criticisms which will give me thought. I believe that most of my critics would not want only supporting voices alone in Weibo and that they will tolerate \"differences\" and \"diversity\" in Weibo. It is late tonight, but I will come back often. Good night!\n\n2.26 13:00 I am a patriot. Right now people are attacking patriotism. They equate patriotism with \"loving the government.\" This is wrong. The China that I love is the one that the Americans and the Japanese know exists and are wary about. It is not just the Chinese government. It also includes the economic successes and social progress of China, it includes the exploration of the Chinese model of development. This \"China\" really exists, and it deserves our love and protection.\n\n2.26 13:01 I believe that most people here are patriots.\n\n2.26 13:40 \"Nationalism\" is the derogatory term that foreigners use to condemn China with. When the Chinese people accept this charge and conduct self-criticism, they must seriously take into account the international political significance. Right now, people criticize <Huanqiu Shibao> while this term. I think that they are just sloppy and they have not thought it through carefully. No matter what, we live in one nation and we have the same \"national interests.\" We cannot turn our nation into an '-ism' and fight each other.\n\n2.26 14:12 I was in the army for 11 years. I have seen how some nations were torn apart. Those experiences are bound to affect my views about the significance of \"nationhood.\" I believe that the nation is the outermost wall to defend the rights of each and every citizen. We don't normally feel the existence of this wall but it is very important. A strong and rising China is a positive environment for the well-being of the people, not a negative one.\n\n2.26 16:42 The masses can decide whether <Huanqiu Shibao> is serving the interests of the people. <Huanqiu Shibao> is one of the newspapers with the largest circulations in China. We have several million readers each day. They trust <Huanqiu Shibao> and they have broad representativeness of Chinese society. This representativeness already has the respect of the west. I hope that the new friends that I meet here will not overlook this fact.\n\n2.26 18:19 I have been here only one day and I have learned a lot already. It is a totally new feeling. In particular, it does not matter what I say or how sincerely I say it, there will always be someone who \"throw bricks\" at me. This is far too interesting. I think that I need to accustom myself to Weibo culture. I should also say that I didn't delete any comments. This is my first day here and I don't know the operations well enough. Perhaps someone went too far and even the Weibo editors had to intervene.\n\nBefore the Spring Festival, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Rural Development Research Institute professor Yu Jianrong launched a \"Take Chance Photos To Liberate Child Beggars\" campaign at the Sina.com Weibo. This campaign drew broad attention. Netizens actively joined in and the mainstream media followed up quickly. \"Taking Chance Photos\" became the top search term at Sina.com in the initial stage. Yet, things did not go smoothly afterwards. During this period, Peng Gaofeng was able to be reunited with his son who was missing for three years. While this was miraculous, the son Peng Wenle was not a street beggar and his rescue had nothing to do with any chance photos.\n\nUp to the moment when this essay was completed, there was not a single instance in which a child was liberated via the \"Take Chance Photos\" campaign. On the contrary, the actions of these photographers raised the ire of the beggars. People began to ponder whether \"taking chance photos\" was a violation of human rights. The \"Take Chance Photos\" campaign began to fade. This was the second stage. Because the Two Congresses were upcoming, the campaign launcher Yu Jianrong used the \"anti-abduction\" imperative to propose legislation for a \"total ban on child begging.\" This was opposed by many participants in the initial \"Take Chance Photos To Liberate Abducted Children.\" A vigorous debate followed. This was the third stage.\n\nThese three stages of the \"Take Chance Photos To Liberate Child Beggars\" showed that there are internal rifts inside Chinese society. The rifts are increasing and point to the emergence of two clearly defined camps.\n\nAccording to Professor Yu Jianrong, the campaign began after the parent of an abducted child asked for help. There must be a certain socio-psychological groundswell in order for the campaign to take off so quickly. According to the columnist/commentator Hecaitou, the emotional trigger point for the anti-abduction campaign was a single sentence: \"Uncle, use the knife to slash me because the acid hurts too much.\" This sentence showed the barbarity wrought upon the abducted children and the psychological hurt to the families of the abductees. The combination allowed the campaign to take off explosively. Unfortunately, this combination did not have a firm factual basis.\n\nIf you walk around city streets, you can easily see child beggars. Some of them are physically handicapped, which may be either real or simulated. According to statistical data, as many as 200,000 children are abducted in China each year. So it is easy to link the two pieces of information together. This linkage is reinforced by the frequent news stories about how begging creates wealth.\n\nUnder the current welfare system in China, the grassroots citizens are forced to rely on their children to take care of them in their old age. This is where the abducted children are going. According to the most recent news reports, it is a myth to say that beggars get rich. As for the physical mutilation, it is rare because of the medical knowledge required.\n\nAccording to the statistics from the Baby Come Home Volunteers Association, 5 out of 180 rescued abducted children were found to be begging and none of them were mutilated. The inability of the \"Take Chance Photos\" campaign to liberate even a single abducted child is further proof.\n\nSo a mass social movement turned out to be based upon non-existent facts. This is incredible, but it is the inevitable product of the state of information communication and the ineffectiveness of spontaneous self-organization in Chinese society. In China, the media are not independent because they are directly supervised and controlled by the propaganda departments. Therefore all the released information have to serve political needs.\n\nIn order to play up the great achievements of the economic reforms and to show the progress made in this flourishing era, the lives of the grassroots are usually kept out of the mainstream media. The occasion reports are usually about panorama views, or curiosities, or sympathy applied from above.\n\nIn this information environment, everybody only have their personal experiences and a small island of filtered information. They don't understand how the others live. Netizens think that beggars form a foreign nation.\n\nAlso, the Chinese society lacks self-organization and self-management. They don't have an effective public place. They are alienated from each other in an increasingly fragmented society.\n\nTherefore, the \"Take Chance Photos To Liberate Child Beggars\" took off on the basis of tender loving concern and sympathy. But it also showed that because the Chinese people live fragmented lives, this campaign was able to emerge based upon speculations.\n\nAfter Professor Yu Jiangrong announced the key points about the \"total ban on child begging\" in his blog, there were many opposing views. Generally speaking, the Yu Jianrong camp emphasized the role of legal restraint and looked forward to use legislation to form a social consensus.\n\nYu Jianrong himself said: \"The government and the society can only accomplish breakthroughs when a goal exists. So why not?\" But Xiao Shu, Xiao Han and others formed an opposite camp. They emphasized that the current social welfare system is inadequate with scant attention to grassroots administration. To ban child begging is to chase all those people who are trying to survive by begging away from the cities. This will not necessarily improve the well-being of poor rural children. Xiao Shu wrote: \"I don't disagree with a total ban on child begging. But the primary mission should be to establish a children welfare system. It is hard to accept that the primary mission should be banning child beggars.\"\n\nSuperficially, the two sides have the same goals and they are merely arguing about priorities. But behind these priorities are different attitudes and understandings about the system.\n\nTo emphasize legislation in the expectation of achievements being made is a positive view of the present system; to be concerned about children welfare first is a deep skepticism about the present system. After incidents such as the collapsed schools in the earthquake area, the Tan Zuoren case, the Sanlu milk powder scandal, the Zhao Lianhe case and so on, more and more people are inclined that the system does not care about children. The opposing camp definitely incorporates this view.\n\nAnd it goes even further than that as the opposing camp has even deeper worries. A \"total ban on child begging\" will necessarily include a system of compulsory custody of child beggars as well as compulsory classification of the adults who accompany the child beggars.\n\nAlthough only a special group of people is being targeted here, it may re-open the back door for the previously eliminated system of compulsory custody. This is not necessarily far-fetched given the current emphasis on maintaining stability. The commentator Wen Kejian described his worry: \"Although we want the same thing, we have different narratives. We may end up with something that is completely opposite.\"\n\nAccording to the \"total ban on child begging\" narrative, the powers of the government will be enhanced with respect to private space. Under the present power structure, this effort will ultimately be opposite to the stated goal.\"\n\nSo this was how the debate shifted from a specific issue to the present power structure: Do you trust the existing administrative system, or are you wary? Do you expect it to produce results, or are you wary about its interference into private space? This choice also exists for the reform of the existing system itself. Do you want some minor changes, or do you want a complete reform?\n\nIn recent years, almost all the similar kinds of debates carried this hidden theme. On one hand, this theme causes divisiveness among people. On the other hand, people also form camps on the basis of their positions with respect to this theme. After the repeated debates, two clearly defined camps have surfaced. The controversy about the \"Take Chance Photos To Liberate Child Beggars\" campaign on Sina.com Weibo is merely one part of this long process.\n\nIt's 1pm. I changed my clothes and got ready to proceed to the Starbucks Plaza in People's Park at the heart of Guangzhou city. Today, there just might be the first Jasmine Revolution in China. I don't know who issued the call, but I am going to carry out my ideas of freedom and democracy. I am not going to miss this opportunity for a peaceful revolution. I am going to do this no matter the hardship. I also put on some of my better clothes, because if I should lose my freedom for the first time in my life, I would like to do so with dignity.\n\nThere was an interesting sideshow from the very start. After I got out of my home and walked for about ten minutes, I remembered that I left something home. So I turned around and walked back. I spotted eight uniformed police officers who were following me. When I turned around, they immediately dispersed and pretended that they were doing something or the other. I tried to establish eye contact, but they avoided looking at me and they scattered. I laughed. Why? If they were coming after me, why didn't they act directly? If they were not coming after me, why did they disperse? It was amusing to see eight uniformed police officers following me; it was even more amusing to see them scatter. Ho ho, it was fun. I am thinking: Am I the only person in China who publicly stated beforehand that I was going to participate in the Jasmine Revolution? This is interesting in itself.\n\nIt is exactly 2pm. I arrived at the Starbucks Plaza in People's Park. My initial visual impression was that there was a large group of police officers! This small plaza just 1,000 square meters in area had more than 100 police officers, more than the passersby. Several dozen of them stood in the middle of the plaza, creating an invisible atmosphere of oppression. Uniformed police officers were everywhere. There were probably even more plainclothes police officers. Isn't this normal? The call to assemble went out openly on the Internet. So the police must have known immediately and got prepared. Maybe they were here last night already. What will happen? We will have to wait and see. Whatever happens, I am psychologically prepared.\n\nSo I entered the plaza and I began to assess the people that I see. I was trying to find fellow travelers. Since this is an assembly, I need to find my fellow travelers and then see what we can do. There were quite a few people in the plaza. Some were passersby and some were standing or sitting with unknown motives. I looked at them one by one and attempted to establish eye contact. Everybody was avoiding eye contact. My eyes were tired after looking for more than ten minutes. I have never stared at people for such a long time. So I decided to walk towards the police and look at them. One of them glanced at me with a look that is not hostile, but he quickly turned his eyes away.\n\nSo I was foiled. I began to stroll around. If I can't find a fellow traveler, then whom am I assembling with? It is not true that these people were here for no purpose. Some of them were looking at their mobile phones or reading books. Or they were just looking around. But nobody wanted to establish communication. Yes, there are many police officers around. So it is possible that people are wary. So I entered Starbucks. I walked down one level and then the next level. But I was still unable to find anyone who looked like a fellow traveler.\n\nI wondered if we needed a herald to make the call? I went back to the center of the plaza. I looked around again and I still could not find anyone who looked ready to answer my call. Should I shout aloud in the plaza: \"Is anyone here for the assembly?\" Should I start shouting slogans? That seemed too embarrassing. I couldn't do it on my own. So I went and bought a newspaper. I pretended to be reading the newspaper and I looked around. Many people keep coming over and taking photos of the Starbucks sign with their mobile phone cameras and then they left quickly. Meanwhile quite a few people around me were looking at their mobile phones or reading books without any attempt to make eye contact.\n\n2:30pm, 2:40pm, 2:50pm. The pedestrian traffic was thinning out. All those people like my type have left. I knew that there would be no show today. That was all there was today. So I strolled around the park. I spotted some signs. The police were everywhere in the park. During my walk in less than half the park, I saw several hundred police officers and several dozen police vehicles. My former company was located in a building by the park. One morning, I saw a large group of police officers in the building lobby. I asked my colleague who told me quietly that there was a sit-in demonstration. I realized that we were right next to city hall and the police were reserve forces who were staying out of sight. So I figured that there must be over one thousand police officers in the surrounding buildings.\n\nI went back to the plaza. Apart from park tourists, there was hardly anyone around. So I had to go home. On the subway, I began to think about why the jasmine flowers didn't bloom today. Fang Bingxing is the main perpetrator. The Great Firewall kept all the news out of China. The news was originally posted at the Boxun website, which has been inaccessible for several days already. Even a veteran wall-climber like myself only saw it at Epoch Times in the middle of the night. So others are even less likely to know. Not many people in Guangzhou would know, unless they work for the government. How many people can come? If too few people show up, nobody dares to take the lead. So this bastard Fang Bingxing is evil. Someday we will hold a public trial for this old bastard and send him off to jail for the rest of his life.\n\nSome people say that the Chinese are cowardly and feeble. This is an excuse. If you read the Twenty-Four Histories, there is nothing except for rebellions. The entire history of China is about rebellions. We have five thousand years of rebellions. Xiang Tang started it, and Liu Bang, Xiang Yu, Zhu Ruanzhang, Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong were all rebels. There are far too many Chinese persons who are unafraid to die. The key is whether they can be mobilized and organized. We don't want a violent revolution that will smash everything. We want a peaceful revolution.\n\nOn this day, the jasmine flowers did not bloom in Guangzhou. That is okay. I will be returning next Sunday at 2pm. And the week after that. As the news spreads, more and more fellow travelers will come. There will be more and more of us.\n\nThe People of Guangzhou, see you next week at Starbucks Plaza, People's Park.\n\nOn Sunday, police took at least three people away in Beijing, one of whom tried to lay down white jasmine flowers while hundreds of people milled about the protest gathering spot, outside a McDonald's on the capital's busiest shopping street. In Shanghai, police led away three people near the planned protest spot after they scuffled in an apparent bid to grab the attention of passers-by.\n\nMany activists said they didn't know who was behind the campaign and weren't sure what to make of the call to protest, which first circulated Saturday on the U.S.-based, Chinese-language news website Boxun.com.\n\nThe unsigned notice called for a \"Jasmine revolution\"  the name given to the Tunisian protest movement  and urged people \"to take responsibility for the future.\" Participants were urged to shout, \"We want food, we want work, we want housing, we want fairness\"  a slogan that highlights common complaints among Chinese.\n\nThe call is likely to fuel anxiety among China's authoritarian government, which is ever alert for domestic discontent and has appeared unnerved by recent protests in Egypt, Tunisia, Bahrain, Yemen, Algeria and Libya. It has limited media reports about them, stressing the instability caused by the protests, and restricted Internet searches to keep Chinese uninformed about Middle Easterners' grievances against their autocratic rulers.\n\nOn Saturday in a speech to national and provincial officials, President Hu Jintao ordered them to \"solve prominent problems which might harm the harmony and stability of the society.\"\n\nChina's extensive filtering and monitoring of the Internet meant that most Chinese were unlikely to know about Saturday's call to protest. Boxun.com, for example, is blocked as are Twitter and Facebook, which were instrumental in Egypt's protest movement. Still, young tech-smart Chinese are savvy about getting around controls.\n\nOne person sitting in the McDonald's after the brief protest in Beijing said he saw Sunday's gathering as a dry run.\n\n\"Lots of people in here are Twitter users and came to watch like me,\" said 42-year-old Hu Di. \"Actually this didn't have much organization, but it's a chance to meet each other. It's like preparing for the future.\"\n\nWith foot traffic always heavy at the Wangfujing pedestrian mall, it was difficult to discern who showed up to protest, who came to watch and who was out shopping. Rubberneckers outnumbered any potential protesters. Many wondered if there was a celebrity in the area because of the heavy police presence and dozens of foreign reporters and news cameras.\n\nAs the crowd swelled back and forth and police urged people to move on, 25-year-old Liu Xiaobai placed a white jasmine flower on a planter in front of the McDonald's and took some photos with his cell phone.\n\n\"I'm quite scared because they took away my phone. I just put down some white flowers, what's wrong with that?\" Liu said afterward. \"I'm just a normal citizen and I just want peace.\"\n\nSecurity agents tried to take away Liu, but he was swarmed by journalists and eventually was seen walking away with a friend.\n\nTwo other people were taken away by police, including a shabbily dressed old man who was cursing and shouting, though it wasn't clear if he was there because of the online call to protest.\n\nIn Shanghai, three young men were taken away from outside a Starbucks coffee shop in People's Square by police, who refused to answer reporters' questions about why they were detained. They trio had been shouting complaints about the government and that food prices are too high.\n\nA couple dozen older people were drawn to the commotion and started voicing their own complaints and saying they wanted democracy and the right to vote. One woman jumped up on a roadside cement block to shout, \"The government are all hooligans,\" then ran off, only to return a bit later and shout again at the police and others crowded in the area before once again scampering away.\n\nSecurity officials were relaxed toward the retirees and the crowd eventually drifted away.\n\nThere were no reports of protests in other cities where people were urged to gather, such as Guangzhou, Tianjin, Wuhan and Chengdu.\n\nAt first there was this microblog campaign against child abduction. That is, we want to save abducted children. This was a righteous and reasonable rallying call. We can fully imagine the pain and despair of the parents of abducted children. There is no worse human tragedy than this. It would be a great thing to help these unfortunate people!\n\nThe convenors put forward some very concrete ideas -- whenever you spot a possibly abducted child, you use your mobile phone camera to take photos and post them on microblogs. At the same time, we build a database of the photos of missing children. By comparing the photos, we will find the clues to liberate the abducted children.\n\nI thought that this was a good idea and I forwarded those microblog posts to others.\n\nThen came a piece of encouraging news. A certain civil charity foundation indicated that it would support this campaign financially. Money is needed to hire professionals to build and manage this database. If financial support is present, things will move faster. We who have been encouraging civil charity foundations are encouraged by this quick response.\n\nCivil charity foundations are one part of the broad market system. The quick response here show that the market system works very quickly. If we have many different kinds of civil charity foundations in China, then all sorts of charity work will be done by the specialized foundations -- just like all kinds of businesses will have specialized companies to cater to them. Our society will be so much better for it.\n\nSo far everything is normal and proper. I was very delighted to see the civil society grow through these steps. Microblogs and other new technologies play important roles, and that is encouraging. As technologies grow rapidly in China today, how far can a true civil society be away?\n\nBut I didn't imagine that things would change.\n\nBased up some logic that I still cannot fully comprehend, the campaign to liberate abducted children suddenly became the campaign to liberate child beggars.\n\nThe superficial reason is: Many child beggars were kidnapped and even intentionally mutilated to garner public sympathy and hence maximize returns.\n\nIn a world where conspiracy theories abound, this small theory got a high level of credibility. The public was immediately awash in righteousness. So the campaign to take photos of abducted children became the campaign to take photos of child beggars.\n\nSome sensible people pointed out: It is very unlikely for someone to abduct, maim and sell children as beggars because it is not worth the effort. There has always been a strong market for healthy children. If you abduct a healthy child, the normal \"profiteering\" channel is to immediately sell it to some family as adopted children. To maim an abducted child for begging is to forsake the immediate payout and take on huge future risks instead. Nobody is so stupid. People who intentionally abduct children aren't that stupid.\n\nAt the same time, it is not hard to find children with various physical and/or mental handicaps. If someone wants to use such children to garner public sympathy, it won't be hard to find or rent them.\n\nThese are plausible analyses. The ensuing police investigations support these analyses. Under the pressure of this photo-taking campaign, the police investigated the relationships between a number of beggars and the accompanying children and found them to be biological parents begging with their biological children. So far, there has not been a single case of anyone maiming children for begging.\n\nBut the mass movement has been pumped up. Once that happens, there is no room left for dispassionate objective analyses.\n\nEven though some people keep pointing out that abducting children is not the same as bringing one's own children to beg, the campaign went ahead to change the goal from liberating abducted children to liberating child beggars regardless. It is one thing for the masses to ignore logic, but the original convenors also change the campaign to \"liberation of child beggars\" without explanation.\n\nIt is inexplicable that these convenors want to introduce legislation to criminalize child begging. They want to use public authority to eradicate the phenomenon of child begging. They were not content to be charity workers -- they want to become politicians.\n\nNobody thinks that it is a joy to be a beggar. Nobody thinks that the experience would be good for the mental and physical health for children. Everybody agrees on these points. The disagreement is: Do people have the right to beg? Do they have the right to bring their children along when they beg?\n\nIt is a frightening proposal to insist that people have no right to beg, or that they have no right to bring their children along when they beg. If they criminalize such activities for whatever reasons, there can only be one of two outcomes.\n\nFirstly, the previously eliminated system of compulsory custody will be revived. The police and other authorities will find \"customers\" for these custodial centers. Obviously the taxpayers will be paying the bill. These custodial centers will become the hell-on-earth for poor people. The \"customers\" will be bullied by the \"service workers\" and other more vicious \"customers.\" It will come as no surprise if many terrible things happen there.\n\nSecondly, many people will be separated from their families just because they were poor or too lazy to work. The children will be send to government-run child welfare institutions which are no better than the custodial centers for adult beggars. Those institutions will become the breeding grounds for future generations of criminals. When that time comes, the media reports about the dark truths of these child welfare institutions will once again \"shock\" all of China.\n\nOf course, there can be a third outcome: the law is enacted, but nobody enforces it in a serious manner and nobody obeys it either. This \"third way\" may be good for the beggars but it hurts the rule of law. Also, since the law exists on the books, any government official can invoke it at any time just to harass a beggar.\n\nWouldn't that be a tremendous irony for the charity foundations and civil organizations! The police are chasing and arresting beggars in the streets, children are painfully separated from their parents and the custodial centers are replete with dark evil. We only see the brutality of the state apparatus and we don't see any charitable purpose; we only see the tiny people writhing under the big boots of the state and we don't see any civil society emerging.\n\nThis is a boring process that is repeated again and again. Every time that we have a social issue or crisis, it is turned into an opportunity for the government to expand its authority. The major reason is that we have infinite trust in the government and infinite distrust in society.\n\nI wish the \"charitable people\" would stop turning into politicians; I wish the public would calm down and shift the focus back to the abducted children. If we want to combat child abduction, we should adhere to the rule of law. We should avoid these superficially passionate but actually chaotic mass movements because the outcomes may be messy. In this aspect, China is the country which has learned the deepest lessons in history -- nobody in the world can match us.\n\nDuring the Spring Festival, there was a \"Take Chance Photos To Liberate Child Beggars\" campaign on the Internet. From the beginning, this campaign muddled \"child beggars\" with \"abducted beggars\" and triggered certain ill consequences involving human right violations. The police are reminding the campaign activists to be cautious in what they do.\n\nShortly after the \"Take Chance Photos To Liberate Child Beggars\" campaign began, some famous microbloggers were forwarding a post about the famous \"beggar village\" Gongxiao village, Taihe county, Anhui province. Many people there became rich courtesy of begging and now own brand new houses. These people even deliberately maimed and mutilated child beggars. When I saw this microblog post, I immediately replied: This is an old report from seven or eight years ago and the situation today needs to be verified. Several days later, I was going to a friend's place and I turned on the car radio to hear a Voice of China report. A reporter named Wang Jing made a field investigation. She spoke live from the field to describe the awful things going on in Gongxiao village. The two studio hosts made righteous denunciations. At the time, I wondered if the reporter really went to the village during Chinese New Year? If so, that this is not easy and deserves respect. If the report is true, then nothing has changed in Gongxiao village over the past seven or eight years. If anything, things have gotten worse.\n\nOn February 7, the written Voice of China article appeared on the Internet. I read it carefully. The reporter was Wang Jing, which was a very usual name. The reporter said: \"Recently the stories of abducting, maiming and coercing children to beg has been widely spread around the microblogs and websites. People are paying attention. Gongxiao village, Taihe county, Fuyang city, Anhui province and the surrounding area are well-known as the strongholds for large-scale child abduction and coerced begging. Where do these children come from? What kind of cruel torture were given to them? How come nobody cares about these appalling acts for such a long period of time? Our reporter conducted a field investigation.\"\n\nThe report was followed by a large number of statements like \"the old people in the village said,\" \"information from a relevant person,\" \"the tip provided by an informant\" and so on. It is not going too far to say that this is hearsay. There was another error in the report, because the article used xiang (=town) as the term for the physically handicapped child beggars instead of the correct xiang (= joss stick). That is not a big problem, because all it says is that the reporter and editors were not knowledgeable enough.\n\nBut the report also contained certain shocking descriptions that would raise make the problems in Gongxiao village truly appalling. How so? The reporter said, \"At night the children are locked inside cages like cats and pigs. This is called 'training the xiang.' The training period for a xiang depends on the results. According to information, the most important goal is to make the xiang obey the master. A disobedient child during training will be beaten. In order to make the physically handicapped children look even more pitiful, the trainer would demand that they wrap their legs around their heads. Many children can't perform this feat. The trainer uses force to bend their legs so that many children become maimed. In order to make the children look more pitiful, some masters will use knifes to slash the limbs, body and faces of the children, even pouring acid on them.\"\n\nIf this report is truthful, then Gongxiao village is hell on earth. On February 9, the <East Day> reporter filed a report from Taihe county. The local police had conducted door-to-door canvassing about the phenomena described in the Voice of China report. This report said that the police has not yet released their results.\n\nOn February 14, <Information Times> special correspondent Xiong Xiangfan published <Gongxiao village (Anhui) was once reported to lead child beggars, villagers sigh that a bad reputation is hard to eliminate>. This report is more fact-based as the reporter stated that he \"re-visited\" Gongxiao village \"several years later.\" [In other words, his report was based upon something that he did before the current microblog campaign began.] With respect to the social criticisms, the villagers complained: \"That was a long time ago. Nowadays nobody does this anymore.\" When the reporter got there, a villager sighed and said: \"This is a joke to outsiders, right? It has been many years ago. Who is still going to perform these evil deeds now!\" The report pointed out that the \"Taihe county government organized almost 100 police officers and more than 60 town/village cadres to canvass and investigate everybody in Gongxiao village and surrounding areas. ... To date, they have been unable to find any child abduction organizations or strongholds. They have not come across any children tortured by means of acid, knife slashings, confinement in cages, etc.\" Clearly the contents of this report are very different from the Voice of China report.\n\nWe have two explanations. Firstly, the Taihe county government says \"so far\" so they may yet come across the shocking events in the Voice of China report. Secondly, the Taihe county government is unable to come up with anything after an extended period. In that case, we have to ask which is true -- the Voice of China report or the Taihe county government's statement? I hope that the Voice of China report can confront the Taihe county government. Instead of vague statements such as \"the old people in the village said,\" \"information from a relevant person,\" \"the tip provided by an informant\" and so on, the Voice of China reporter should bring out ironclad evidence to show that the cages, acid and maiming are true. This will shut the Taihe county government officials up.\n\nBut I think that the Voice of China reporter won't be able to come up with the evidence. She only had hearsay. In the Voice of China report, there was one noteworthy sentence: \"During the several months of investigation of the xiang in Gongxiao village, this reporter noticed ..\" When I read this, I realized that I was fooled. At first, I had doubted whether the Voice of China reporter Wang Jing hurried over to Gongxiao village during the Chinese New Year. But the \"several months\" showed that this reporter was there during other times. What other time? I think the Voice of China should tell us. Was it several years ago, just like the <Information Times> reporter did?\n\nYet this has been a sensational story. The Voice of China was able to immediately release a report which looked suspiciously like an old story but the audience got the impression that the reporter went into the field after the Internet discussion began just before the Chinese New Year. This report confirmed the allegations that had been going around the Internet. I think the Voice of China should conduct an internal investigation. Otherwise, either the Taihe county government or the Voice of China is lying. Who do we believe? Either way, it would be shameful to lie. If the Taihe government is lying, the reporter ought to expose their lie without any hesitation. If Voice of China is lying, they should apologize to the people and sanction those responsible.\n\nThe initial news report went something like this: \"At 10:30 that day, about 20 relatives of the patient Liu Yonghua charged into the thoracic surgery department director's office. When they found nobody there, they turned to attack the deputy director in the office next door. Without allowing any explanation to be given, the attacker stabbed the doctor twice in the left chest. The doctor fell down on the ground. The attacker then hauled the doctor to the eighth floor window and tried to throw him out. At the same time, other medical workers who were on duty at the hospital were also assaulted. Ten medical workers were injured, including six doctors whose conditions are serious enough to require hospitalization ...\"\n\nAccording to the Thoracic Surgery Department director Mei Ju, this is what he saw:\n\nPatient Liu Yonghua was hospitalized at the Xinhua Hospital for more than a month. On the evening of January 28, he died in spite of medical efforts to save him. This was a \"normal death.\" The family may have their doubts, but they did not go through the normal complaint channels. Instead, they \"inexplicably\" set up a mourning hall outside the next morning and unfolded a banner. There were about twenty to thirty people. Most of them were \"professional hospital troublemakers\" and only a small number of them were relatives. So the news reports were wrong to cite \"about twenty relatives.\" They caused trouble on January 29 and 30. The incident took place on January 31. Afterwards, the very experienced \"professional hospital troublemakers\" fled.\n\nMei Ju said: \"They came in several groups. One group proceeded to the administrative building and blockaded the place. Another group came over here. They began to look for people in the offices. They kicked open my door. I wasn't in. Another group came in ...\"\n\nHe said that some of those were relatives, some were \"reserves\" and someone was taking a video. The hospital had called the police earlier that day. Because there were so many of them, the police were divided. When the attacks began, the police were downstairs either at the administrative building or the main lobby.\n\nMei Ju said that there were \"professional medical troublemakers\" hanging around the hospital. They usually wait around the morgue. Whenever some patient dies, they would say: \"We can help you take care of this.\" After they get money, they divide it with the relatives. These people offer full services including wreaths and elegiac couplets.\n\nHe speculated that the knife-wielding son Liu Peng of the patient must have lost his mind. Mei does not know why he acted this way. He thinks that Liu Peng may have been incited by the \"professional hospital troublemakers.\"\n\nAccording to the anonymous relative of a different patient, this was not what happened at all:\n\nThe relatives of Liu Yonghua did not start trouble \"without cause.\" The family had spent all its savings to pay for the hospital bills. Liu Peng had pleaded the hospital to allow for delayed payment, but the hospital unilaterally cut off further treatment. Two days later, Liu Yonghua died. That was why the relatives went to the hospital seeking justice.\n\nThe hospital representatives were cold and indifferent, and the deputy director Ding Fangbao did not say any nice words. That was why a quarrel ensued leading to a fight. A relative stabbed Dr. Ding who ordered the other staff to \"beat them up.\" The other male doctors then joined in the melee.\n\nBefore the melee, the son of Liu Yonghua grabbed the wounded Ding Fangbao and charged to the eighth floor window saying: \"You treat us this way! Let us jump down together!\" This was not the same as the news report about \"the attacker hauling him in front of the eighth floor window and tried to throw him out.\"\n\nAt the same time, this source was skeptical about the news report that \"ten medical workers were injured, six of whom were serious enough to be hospitalized.\"\n\nSeveral questions were posed to the Shanghai police. Here are the answers from the Shanghai Public Security Bureau Information Office.\n\n1. There were no \"professional hospital troublemakers.\" Only family relatives were involved.\n\n2. Our police officers arrived at the scene as soon as we received the call. After we apprise ourselves about the situation, we did not apply any extreme compulsory procedures because we found out that there were reasons. Our initial role is to persuade and mediate. The family relatives do not cause trouble \"without reason.\" They are regular people. We must consider the positions of both sides and enforce the law in a humane manner.\n\n3. What caused so many injuries? The simplest answer is to read our injury reports. It was nowhere as serious as the news reports say.\n\nA police officer told our reporter: \"Maybe what I say is not too polite. The Xinhua hospital ought to find out the reasons themselves. Why did the family relatives resort to such extreme actions? If you are a truly white guardian angel, they couldn't thank you enough? Why did they do this then? The family relatives were extremely emotional and they did not act rationally. But what was the reason behind that.\"\n\nHe said: \"Normally the police has good relations with the hospital. Do they have to say that we didn't do anything in this case? That we only went there to watch? This is impossible. I don't know if Xinhua Hospital told you why these family relatives would want to cause trouble. This is because Xinhua Hospital unilaterally cut off the medications for two days due to lack of payment ... do you think that the hospital can do that?\"\n\nAccording to the Yangpu Police Precinct which handled the case itself:\n\nThe number of family relatives was at most 12 or 13. According to the surveillance video taken at the entrance of the Xinhua Hospital as well as the witness statements, only six family relatives took place in the incident: two sons, one daughter, one younger brother, one nephew and one young sister of the deceased. The son has been arrested, three others are detained and two were admonished before being freed.\n\nAccording to police officer Gao Jun, the second son Liu Ming of the patient runs a small restaurant in Fuyang city (Anhui province). His father sometimes help out with carrying and washing dishes. This time, he sold his home to pay for the medical bills. So far he has spent more than 300,000 yuan. The family can be said to be bankrupt.\n\nThe elder son Liu Peng stayed with his father while at the Anhui Hospital. Then he asked Xinhua Hospital doctor Mei Ju to operate on his father in Anhui. The operation was not successful, so the father was moved to Xinhua Hospital for further operations. Liu Peng also stayed with his father everyday. But in the end, he was even told that his father was in dire conditions and he did not get to say farewell.\n\n\"For us, we can understand how he felt. His father had just died and he couldn't take it. For them, they don't necessarily understand that the matter can be handled through legal and other channels. Afterwards I spoke to them. They said that they understood nothing else other than the fact that their father was gone. I told them: Compared to the hospital, you are weak and vulnerable; you must learn to protect your own rights; you must learn how to follow normal procedure to resolve the matter. They cried and said: We don't know anything about protection ... we only know that we did this out of filial piety ...\"\n\nAccording to the family relatives:\n\nThe family relatives only want to get an explanation for the death of their father. The hospital refused to receive them. They went to see the case doctor, but he was not there.\n\nAt around 10:30am on January 31, four of them went upstairs to find the doctor. There was a quarrel. Two more of them went upstairs as well. After the stabbing occurred, they did not flee. They just went down on the street and blocked traffic. Two of them held out a banner and two of them blocked the road. The son knelt on the road holding the portrait of his father. The daughter sustained injuries in her leg and could not even kneel down.\n\n1. My initial skepticism about \"taking chance photos\"\n\nI have been restless over the past few days because of the anxiety that I feel about the \"anti-abduction microblog campaign.\"\n\nYu Jianrong started the \"anti-abduction microblog campaign.\" He is known for organizing a civilian investigation team to look into the case of Qian Yunhui. Reportedly, this campaign began after a Fujian woman asked Yu for help. She said that her child was abducted, crippled and forced to become a beggar. So Yu Jianrong started a microblog to ask netizens to use their cameras to take photos of child beggars. These photos are posted on the Internet so that parents can look for their missing children. Yu also called on netizens to call the police immediately if they see a child beggar.\n\nI was immediately skeptical about this kind of call from Yu Jianrong -- if a child voluntarily wants to beg without any coercion, is it a violation of his/her rights to take his photo and post on the Internet?\n\nWhen I stated this doubt, people cursed me out immediately. One netizen said that I was a \"fundamentalist liberal.\" They say that children should not be begging and that there is no such thing as \"voluntary begging.\" If a child cannot survive, it will be up to the state to provide for him instead of letting him roam the streets and beg.\n\nThese arguments from netizens are very reasonable. They are even totally correct. Their very correct argument not only failed to dispel my doubts but it also offered no justification for the photo taking. Consider a child who finds it hard to survive and has to beg in the streets. He receives no help from the government. Instead, his minimal dignity is being violated by netizens. What kind of humanitarianism is this? If netizens think that there should not be any beggars in society and that the government has failed in fulfilling its responsibilities, they should not be taking photos without permission and posting onto the Internet. Instead, they should be demanding the government carry out its responsibilities. But the reality is that it is far easier to trample on weak and vulnerable people than supervising the authorities. Righteous netizens prefer to do the easier things.\n\nEven with these doubts, I still wanted the \"anti-abduction microblog campaign\" to have some positive effects. This is not an issue about how many children are saved by netizens. Rather, this kind of campaign will pressure the government, and make the Civil Affairs Bureau to build a perfect system of assistance and the Ministry of Public Security Bureau to go after child abduction/trafficking.\n\nBut I am finding that the \"anti-abduction microblog campaign\" is gradually being taken over by a certain fanaticism. The media and Yu Jianrong speak delightfully about \"liberating\" six children who were reconciled with their families. This type of news report increases news readership and earns Yu Jianrong a fine social reputation. But it also ignored the rights of the weak and vulnerable. If these types of sentiments are allowed to foster, there will be even more hurt to the weak and vulnerable.\n\nFirst of all, is it true that six children have been rescued? If six children were rescued over such a short span of time, then Yu Jianrong and others have accomplished something significant. But if you pay close attention to this piece of news, you will note that only one of the six children is named. This is Peng Wenle, who was found because his father persisted on trying to locate him for years and a website carrying the information on his missing child brought in a tip. This has nothing to do with the current campaign. Who are the other five rescued children? How were they rescued? The news does not provide any explanation.\n\n2. Fanaticism leads to persecution\n\nIn fact, the developments over the past few days show that the persecution has begun.\n\nCase #1: Some righteous netizens found an adult male begging with a child. They posted the photos onto the Internet. A woman thought that the child resembled her missing child. So the righteous netizens went to take the father-and-son beggars to the police who forced them to undergo DNA testing. The results showed that the man and the child were father and son. After the truth came out, the woman thanked the police, the netizens and the media, but she did not have any words of apology for the father and the son. The netizen who posted the photos on the Internet simply said afterwards: I let everybody down, yes.\n\nCase #1: In the \"Anti-abduction campaign\" in Xian city, a police was seen wrestling a child from the \"human trafficker.\" Afterwards it was found that the child and the \"suspected human trafficker\" were daughter and mother. Do you see her pain, her terror and her tears?\n\nCase #3. In Shanghai, the subway police found three male and one female beggars. Through checking ID's and household registration information, they determined that these children had not been abducted. Instead the children had been taken to beg by their parents and relatives. The police lectured the parents/relatives and then had to release everybody because the law does not provide for any penalties.\n\nCase #4: On February 9, the \"Take Chance Photos To Liberate Children\" campaign set up a Shaanxi website. A reporter took a photo of an adult woman begging with two children. When the woman saw the reporter taking her photo, she threw an iron bowl hard on the ground in anger. The police took the woman down to the station for investigation. Afterwards, the police confirmed that the woman was the mother of the two children and they came from Minxian county, Gansu province.\n\nCase #5: A Shenzhen reporter found that child beggars have vanished in the streets where they use to roam. Not only were there no child beggars, but adult ones were gone too. A citizen said when she stopped her car at a road intersection, a woman with a child in her arms came over to beg. The citizen took out her camera to take a photo. The woman fled with her child.\n\nBegging is one of the oldest professions in human history. When some people become desperate and before they resort to crime, there is at least one profession that can bring them food. That is begging. Today, these fanatic people can make beggars disappear completely. What kind of terrifying force is this?\n\nA netizen said: You have not lost a child yourself, so you don't know how much pain it is to lose a child. But I have to ask: Because of your pain, you are willing to ignore the rights of weak and vulnerable people?\n\n3. Can we take the child beggars away from their parents?\n\nThe \"anti-abduction microblog campaign\" was based upon an assumption: Most child beggars were abducted and sold, and most physically handicapped beggars were crippled/disfigured by these evil human traffickers. I ask a friend who subscribes to this view: What is the proportion of this among all child beggars? This friend said: At least 90%. I ask: What is the basis of your number? He said: Commonsense.\n\nIn fact, the \"anti-abduction microblog campaign\" is based upon this self-evident \"commonsense judgment.\" Yu Jianrong and them have not actually investigated the proportion of abducted/coerced children among child beggars. That is why this campaign has quickly run into trouble. According to the news reports over the past several days, not a single instance of coerced child begging has been uncovered. They were all cases about parents taking their children to beg. At present, the law does not prohibit parents from taking their children to beg. Therefore the police are unable to mete out any penalties.\n\nThere is a certain viewpoint that is close to the Nazis. They say that if people cannot spare their children from hunger, then they should not be allowed to have children. I would like to tell you that it is a natural right for a human to have children. People should not be deprived of this right just because they are poor. There are many reasons why people are poor. We form societies and we endure governments just so we can live better. But in our society, there are still people who cannot spare their children from hunger and live dignified lives. We ought to contemplating just what has gone wrong with our society. We ought not to treat poor people even more harshly!\n\nThere is another extremely arrogant viewpoint. They say that when beggars beg along with their children, it is tragic for the children. Such parents have failed and the children ought to be removed to given to families which can bring them up capably. Then everything will be alright. Based upon this arrogance, many netizens are calling for the People's Congress to legislate a total prohibition of child begging; any parents begging with their children will have their children taken into compulsory custody.\n\nThis reminds me of what Mr. Yang Hengjun told about an episode in Australian history. At one time, the Australian government thought that the aborigines treated their children like cattle. That is, the children did not go to school and they did not lead civilized lives. Therefore the government decided to take the children away by force and give them to families with better conditions and better civilization to bring up. When these children grew up, they became \"the Stolen Generation.\" This generation was better developed but the price that they paid was separation from their natural parents. For a long time, the Australian government refused to apologize to \"the Stolen Generation.\" When Kevin Rudd became Prime Minister, the first thing he did was to apologize solemnly to that generation. He said that the Australian government had erred in this affair.\n\nThose people who advocate taking away the children of beggars ought to remember that even though the affluent Australian families could provide a leisurely life and a good future to these aboriginal children, they were never able to make up for the mental hurt of \"the Stolen Generation.\" Are you presumptuous enough to think that the \"affluent families\" of China can bring happiness to these forcibly removed children?\n\nAs for the system of compulsory custody, Sun Zhigang paid with this life to eliminate this malevolent system. Why do you want to bring it back again? Are you so easily forgetful? ...\n\nRecently, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences professor Yu Jianrong set up a \"Take Chance Photos To Liberate Beggar Children\" microblog to call for netizens and police to pay attention to abducted children.\n\nOn January 26, the netizen \"Stinky Egg Egg\" posted at the Xian Mother website about suspicious activity that she observed that day. \"Today, I saw this man on the Route 106 bus. There was an empty seat so I let him sit. The boy got on the bus and refused to let the man embrace him or let the man sit. So the man hit the boy in the face and head. He hit him fiercely until there was swelling. The boy began to cry. People couldn't stand it. But he kept cursing the child (\"I am going to kill you. If you don't obey me and you talk nonsense, I am going to beat you to death\"). I asked, \"Who is this child in relation to you?\" He said that he was the uncle of the child. The parents are away, so the grandfather asked him to look after the boy. The boy does not have a grandmother. He is disobedient and naughty. Therefore the man has to hit him.\n\n\"Stinky Egg Egg\" posted two photos taken with her mobile phone camera. In the photo, there was a thin man wearing a blue knit hat holding a boy in his arms. The boy wore a white surgical mask and a yellow-white hat.\n\nOn January 29, our reporter contacted \"Stinky Egg Egg.\" She said that they came across each other at 1am on January 26. The man was in his 50's, about 1.7 meters tall and somewhat lanky; the boy was around 4 years old, spoke putonghua clearly, pale and seemed to have a scalding injury between the right thumb and middle finger.\n\n\"I suspect that he is a 'human trafficker' because he was shabbily dressed whereas the boy was cleanly dressed. The boy spoke putonghua and said in a low voice that he was looking for someone ...\" She said with regret that she was very busy at the time as her phone kept ringing. She did not know what to do so she only took two photos. The man and the boy got off at the Mingdemen station. \"... Afterwards, the more I thought about it, the more worried I got. So I posted the photos on the Internet to see if people can held.\" \"Stinky Egg Egg\" was sorry about her inaction at the time.\n\nThe Internet forum post drew a lot of attention. Most people thought that \"Stinky Egg Egg\"'s analysis was reasonable and they were worried about the boy:\n\n\"Little Little Snow Snow\": This man does not appear to be the uncle of the boy. The boy was clean and wearing a surgical mask, but the uncle was filthy ...\n\n\"Yuyoo\": This is heartbreaking. Please don't let the man be a human trafficker. We ought to think about calling the police when we spot suspicious situations. Even if we are wrong, it was a mere misunderstanding. But if we are right, it would be unthinkable ...\n\nThe photos by \"Stinky Egg Egg\" were posted to the specialized \"Baby Come Home\" website. On January 31, the information was posted onto the microblogs and drew nationwide attention.\n\n\"Stinky Egg Egg\" forwarded her information to the Anti-Abduction Office of the Xian City Public Security Bureau. The police said that it is impossible to decide whether someone is an abductor based upon clothes and actions. Further confirmation would be required.\n\nLate night on January 31, the Xian public security bureau's \"Xian Public Security Bureau\" microblog posted the results of the initial police efforts: \"On January 25, 26 and 27, there was only one case of missing children reported in the whole city. This happened on January 26 when the police found a 5-year-old boy who got lost. The police located his family and they were reunited.\"\n\nOn February 2, the police microblog said: \"The Xian Public Security Bureau's Anti-Abduction Office has forwarded the information to the 'Baby Come Home' website to solicit further information. The various police stations, GPS patrol cars and police posts along the bus route 106 have been notified to look out. The photo of the man has been distributed to the various departments to seek further information. The Xian public security bureau is actively conducting various investigations.\"\n\nIn late January, our reporter saw a heart-rending photo on Sina.com Weibo taken by a concerned citizen at the Number One Market in the Hexi district of Sanya city. This Weibo-driven campaign to locate missing children has taken off all across China.\n\nCao Yu, male, 9 years old, Taikong county, Zhoukou city, Henan province\n\nYu Kai, male, 15 years old, Taikong county, Zhoukou city, Henan province\n\nZhai Wudi, male, 15-years-old, Taikong county, Zhoukou city, Henan province\n\nZhang Weibing, male, 10 years old, Taikong county, Zhoukou city, Henan province\n\nLi Weifang, female, born December 17, 1991, Taikong county, Zhoukou city, Henan province\n\nZhai Changchang, female, 8-years-old, Taikong county, Zhoukou city, Henan province\n\nXu Yuchao, male, 8-years-old, Taikong county, Zhoukou city, Henan province\n\nXu Yufeng, female, 6-years-old, Taikong county, Zhoukou city, Henan province\n\nOn the morning of February 10, our reporter walked from Liberation Number Four Road to Liberation Number One Road in Sanya city, and found that the child beggars have suddenly disappeared. Only several physically handicapped men were begging. These beggars told our reporter that the news reports about the microblog campaign has had a tremendous impact and the child beggars have moved away.\n\nOur reporter went to the Number One Market to investigate. The renowned local writer Lu Xiaohua told our reporter that the market had a large number of child beggars whose ages are from 5 to more than 10. With Lu Xiaohua leading the way, our reporter spotted three children doing a street performance to beg for money. When the reporter began to take photos, a somewhat older boy stopped him. He said that the newspapers are reporting the anti-abduction campaign on the microblogs and he did not want themselves publicized. Our reporter retreated back and took photos from afar. A 5-year-old boy approached the spectators to ask for money. The reporter also observed two young girls singing. In all, there were 12 child beggars at the Number One Market split up into four groups.\n\nLu Xiaohua told the reporter that he has been paying attention to these children for a while. They have been in Sanya city for more than a month. He has been watching the 5-year-old children performing every day from morning to night. The spectators gave money, but where is the money going? Based upon his investigation, the children may be controlled by certain people. Some of the children may have been forced to live in the streets due to poverty.\n\nOur reporter contacted the Hexi police station to approach the four groups of children and take them down to the station to assist in the investigation.\n\nThere was one girl who was wearing a school uniform with the words \"Kaili Number Three Middle School 2008\" on it. When she saw the police coming, she folded up her musical equipment and got ready to leave. The police stopped her but let her go after they found that she was 20 years old. In another group, one child merged into the crowd and fled. In the end, the police took 10 child beggars down to the police station.\n\nThe police tried to verify the names, ages and addresses of these children. Apart from the leader Li Weifang who had an ID, none of the other children know their home address or carried ID's.\n\nThe investigation by our reporter revealed that Li Weifang brought 6 children (the youngest being 6 years old and the oldest being 12 years old) along. She said that the children belong either to her elder brother or other relatives, and she had the permission of their guardians. They were presently trying to earn money to pay for tuition. When the Spring Festival holidays end, she will bring the children home. So far they have been in Sanya for more than 10 days and they have wired more than 1,000 yuan home. Do these children have telephones at home for verification? Li Weifang declined to answer.\n\nWhile the police were interrogating these children, a man showed up. He claimed that he was the father of two of the child beggars and he wanted to take them away. Apart from providing his own ID, he was unable to produce proof that the two children were his.\n\nThis man said that his name is Liang, he is from Guizhou province and he is 35 years old. He has four children at home. Due to poverty, he took his eldest daughter and his third daughter to beg in Sanya. He left his two sons at home. The eldest daughter Liang Qiuyan and the third daughter Liang Lilai have been in Sanya for more than 10 days and they have made more than 1,000 yuan. He had been staying at a nearby hostel which charges 40 yuan per day. He is usually by his children's side. On this occasion, he was doing laundry for the children who were taken down to the police station.\n\nAccording to the police, two of the \"children\" were adults but the other 8 minors have been handed over to the aid station. The police said that the children have not stated that they were abducted. So the truth will have to wait for further investigation. Based upon the information provided by the children, the police will contact their counterparts in the places of origin and confirm their identities and guardianship.\n\nUnless beggars are prohibited from having children, parents who beg will bring their children along. What else can they do? Can they afford to send their children to daycare centers that charge 1,000 yuan per month? Therefore, most beggar-parents will bring a number of shabbily dressed children with them. How do you propose to prohibit that?\n\nSo you say: \"If I cannot ban those snot-driveling tots from trailing behind their parents, I can ban those pitiful little ones who actually stick their hands out and ask for money.\" In order to do that, you decide to monitor these beggars 24 hours a day. As soon as you spot the children begging, you rush up and stop them.\n\nDon't forget that the children love their parents too and they know how to imitate. Perhaps the parents did not order the children to beg. But the children have observed enough to know to stick out their hands. What do you expect the parents to do? Sternly admonish the children? Or suffer the pain and ignominy reluctantly, and earn a living together? When you see the begging, how do you know that this was ordered by the parents? Or the outcome of imitation from example?\n\nYou say: \"Yes, I cannot tell between the two. But that is unimportant. I will stop all children who beg. I don't care what the reason is.\"\n\nWe city dwellers will have most likely visited small restaurants, snack shops and fruit stands operated by migrants from out of town. Their children will often hang out at the \"work places.\" The parents cannot afford to place the children in daycare centers. Sometimes the children will help out to collect money, sweep the floor, carry plates ... they may even work full-time to help out. There are many of such instances when rural people come to the city. What is the difference between these child laborers and the child beggars? The difference is that they work in different kinds of jobs and they imitate different kinds of behavior. So why don't you also ban these child laborers too?\n\nYou say: \"That is right. Child beggars are like all other child laborers. They must all be banned. The children of migrants must not be allowed to do perform any kind of labor. Child labor is the shame of society. It is a tumor in society. It must be banned.\"\n\nThere once was a country. The rich people ate meat. The poor people ate rice. The poorest of the poor could not lower themselves to steal or rob, and they wound up eating feces. Scientists discovered later that eating feces was not only bad for digestion, but it also polluted the air and was unsightly. Eating feces was the shame of a civilized society, it was a tumor in society and it had to be prohibited. The poorest of the poor soon starved to death, and the problem was solved. Nobody ate feces anymore.\n\nChild laborers and child beggars are not shames. They are not tumors. It is poverty which is a tumor in society. You cannot fix poverty, so you want to use legal means to prevent these children from being able to make a living. What are your moral views based upon?\n\nYou want to ban children from begging. Fine, let us suppose that you succeed. What next? Their parents will continue to beg and the children will continue to go hungry. What now? According to a key opinion leader on Sina.com Weibo: \"The Civil Affairs Bureau will follow up with their minimum social security coverage and free education.\"\n\nExcuse me for being dense. I think that it makes more sense to recommend directly for the beggars to immigrate to the United States of America. Are there more people who are willing to believe the Government/Party nowadays? Or are these Sina.com VIP's actually foreign guests who can write Chinese?\n\nThis key opinion leader also wrote: \"When children beg in the streets, it is violating the law and it can be reported. Also, the child beggar has come out to beg the public. Therefore, there can be no privacy or image rights involved. If they are taken down to the police station and even if they are found not to be abducted, the process will cost the parent beggars and make them not to take their children out begging anymore. If there is actual hardship, the Civil Affairs Bureau will follow up with their minimum social security and free education.\"\n\nIt is a great that this will \"cost\" the parent beggars. Let me add some more: \"Confiscate all the money earned via begging.\" Or actually ban all beggars from having children.\n\n\"If there is actual hardship ...\" Tsk tsk ... What is 'actual hardship'? The money from minimum social security is enough to allow them to eat feces. They beg because they want to eat rice occasionally or even have a piece of meat once in a very rare while. Is that 'actual hardship'?\n\nAlso, this key opinion leader wrote: \"From now on, we must steel our hearts and not give them even one cent.\" Tsk tsk ... this is truly the most brilliantly wonderful formula to relieve poverty.\n\nI don't doubt your kindheartedness for one moment; but after putting your heart in the right place, can you free your brain and give a thought? Have you thought about anything else besides \"Let them eat cake\"?\n\nAs for the righteous and frenzied so-called VIPS and key opinion leaders, are you stupid? Or are you just being plain bastards?\n\n[Note: this essay is solely about parents taking their children to beg in the streets. It has nothing to do with the problem of human trafficking, which is a different subject altogether. At present, there are several news reports about beggars being taken down to police station, found to be families and released -- in other words, the parents are 'incurring' costs just like the key opinion leader wants.]\n\nWhat tune did the pied piper of Hamelin forest play in Germany? How was he able to lead all the children in town away? I don't know the answer.\n\nI only know that all it takes is one sentence to lead all the adults away. For example, \"She pleaded: 'Uncle, don't use acid! Just cut me up with the knife!\" With this sentence, everybody can visualize a small girl who was abducted, crippled and disfigured for begging purposes. So everybody sets out to fight human trafficking with their hearts filled with righteousness and lofty sentiments, as they rushed towards the fortresses or windmills.\n\nThere is no need for sophistry here: Commonsense alone will allow you to deduce that the abduction/selling of children is not the same as begging.\n\nWhy do people abduct/sell children? Because certain people do not have offsprings. Why do people beg? Because they have no other means of earning a living. To abduct and cripple/disfigure a child for the purpose of begging is highly improbable due to the very high risks and costs. Right now, the Chinese people are going bat-crazy because they think there is a group of people who are willing to spend several years of their time to come up with physically handicapped children to beg all over China. This line of business must pay very high dividends because these people are willing to risk execution to do it. Rationally speaking, these people are better off selling drugs because they can earn a lot more money and waste a lot less time.\n\nRight now the Internet is bloodthirsty for these people. There is a nationwide campaign to take photos of child beggars to put on the Internet in order to help parents with missing children. So far, two beggar parents and their son have been forced to undergo DNA testing merely because someone thought that the little beggar resembled her own missing son. Many people applauded this activity as a tremendous public good -- action is better than talk.\n\nI cannot help but raise some minor issues:\n\n1. Is there any society without beggars?\n\nBeggars are in the lowest stratum in society. Such a stratum exists in all societies. Due to illness, luck, setbacks, etc, some people are bound to be pushed beyond the fringes of society. If parents have to beg, their children are beggars too.\n\n2. What kind of person do you consider yourself?\n\nYou think that you have a regular job, you can get on the Internet and therefore you are like the parents with missing children. In other words, a normal person. Therefore you don't see a problem when one of your kind demands the beggars to undergo DNA testing on the basis of a photo alone. One of these days, someone else will think that your land looks just perfect for their future factory/shopping mall and you are forcibly evicted. How come you get angry? How come you want to talk about your rights?\n\n3. Do you think that you have solved any practical problems?\n\nAbductions and human trafficking occur due to market demand. Who is buying these abducted children? What are their purposes? After taking the photos of all child beggars in China and posting them on the Internet, will child trafficking cease? Will there be no more child abductions?\n\nPeople become beggars because they need to earn a living. Who would choose this undignified way of living if they have a choice? Why can't they find a job? After registering all the beggars in China and taking down their DNA information, will they get jobs? Will they live decently and respectably? Will they improve their living conditions? Will the adult beggars not give birth to child beggars?\n\n4. What is your world view?\n\nWhat is your world like? Full of blooming flowers and sweet chocolates? Therefore, you don't understand why some people need to have male offspring? Therefore, you don't understand why some parents would let their own natural born children beg? Therefore, in order to preserve your perfect world, you are willing to apply some surgical operations on the imperfect real world? You are willing to take photos and set up databases for the young beggars as if they are criminals? You are willing to take the young beggars away from their parents and send them off to child welfare institutions? ... The reason is that because you can get on the Internet and you can have your say -- that is, you are a fucking middle-class person -- but the beggars cannot. Is this how it is?\n\nWhat do you want next? So far, the fist step has been to take street photos and force the beggar parents/children to undergo DNA testing. The next step will be to carry out illegal punishment of beggar parents and administer the death penalty to child abductors. The third step is to arrest all beggars and send them off for labor re-education. The ultimate solution would be to forcibly sterilize all beggars and to execute those beggars over 50 years old on humanitarian grounds. Yes, congratulations to you! This is exactly what the Nazis did back then ...\n\nFirst thing:\n\nAt 13:35, Feburary 2, 2011, Mr. Ming wrote at Fanfou:\n\nI just called 10086. The customer service girl asked me how she can help me. I told her: \"Nothing. I only wanted to say Happy New Year to you.\" I could tell that the customer service girl was almost ready to cry.\n\nI forwarded this Fanfou post to Twitter and Weibo. Very quickly, I received a series of condemnations. Although I noted clearly that I was only forwarding what Mr. Ming wrote, these criticisms were directed at me. They said that my actions were meaningless and futile, and merely added to the workload of the customer service people. Someone bluntly said that such calls will jam up the telephone lines. Why not send them 'red envelops' directly? Some professional person even said that such calls decrease the \"completion rates\" for the customer service people and thus reduce their monthly pay which is based upon performance.\n\nIs that so?\n\nOver the next few days, I received more than 700 replies. Several dozens came from front-line customer service people, including more than a dozen from 10086 workrs. They expressed their gratitude; they were happy that some people still remember them during the holidays. One of them said that she personally got such a call while on duty and she was deeply touched. None of them discussed \"completion rates\" with me; none of them complained about the increased work load; they were all happy because someone remembered that they had to work overtime during the holidays.\n\nSecond thing:\n\nDuring the Chinese New Year of 2010, I recommended a video titled: <The journey of Cai Ying-mei>.\n\nThis was the story of an ordinary Taiwanese mother who traveled several thousand miles overseas to visit her daughter. The advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather used this true story to make a television commercial for the Ta Chong Bank of Taiwan. At Weibo, the video was forwarded several tens of thousands of times. At the time, many people asked me: What kind of trashy commercial is this? What has this got to the do with the business activities of the Ta Chong Bank? Who is going to remember the Ta Chong Bank as a result of seeing this video? What is the point of spending so much money to make this commercial?\n\nOn the second day of the Chinese New Year in 2011, the Ta Chong Bank released another commercial titled: <Why do people live? -- Dream riders>.\n\nThis is another true story about several ordinary 81-year-old men traveling around Taiwan on motorcycles. A netizen friend SoPhia Pan Ming told me:\n\nThis is based upon a true story coming from the Taiwan Hong Tao Senior Citizens Welfare Foundation. This NGO specializes in helping senior citizens to carry out their final wishes which are otherwise impossible to accomplish. During the period when the commercial aired, two of the old men passed away. The photo of the late wife in her youth was placed in the front of the motorcycle and they carried the photos of their late friends on their backs, as they sped towards the sea and the red sun. Heroes never grow old.\n\nThis year, this commercial was just as hot as netizens began to discuss Ogilvy & Mather and the Ta Chong Bank.\n\nWhat is the point about doing this? What is the point of sending Chinese New Year greetings to the 10086 customer service representatives? It is to express your good will, it is to let them feel that some people care about them. That is the point. This cannot be attained by bonuses and KPI (Key Performance Indicators). At least, they didn't write me because of their bonuses and KPI. What is the point about these exquisite commercials from Ogilvy & Mather? There are no drawings for prizes, no hard sell and no corporate feel-good image placement. So what is the point? Well, this bank is insisting on telling us a wonderful human story on the second day of the Chinese New Year. That is all there is. I have zero business dealings with this particular bank before or (most likely) after, but I now have an appreciation and trust in this bank that goes beyond any business dealings. The bank told me these stories, and I approve of the ideas related to human lives in these stories. I agree with the values that are being communicated and affirmed.\n\nWhen someone thinks that anything without material payout is meaningless, that person is no different from a tadpole, right? He lives from dawn to night, always calculating the gains and losses on all his actions. Any payout has to be immediately realized. Like a skit by Zhao Benshan or a movie segment by Feng Xiaogang, the laughter and applause have to appear instantaneously. As for me, I intend to live many more years in this world. So I elect to make a few phone calls that have no payouts. Like the Ta Chong Bank, I will wait for the second day of the Chinese New Year next year, the year after, the year after the year after ... and I think somebody will eventually get the point.\n\nOn January 9, 2004 we published the report: <Female child used to beg in streets>. The fate of Xiao Xuanxuan drew a lot of reader attention. During our investigation, we found almost 30 physically handicapped child beggars around Beijing Road, Zhongshan Number Four Road and Zhongshan Number Five Road who all came from Gongxiao village and Wangda village in Taihuo county, Fuyang city, Anhui province. Why is that place so prolific in producing physically handicapped children?\n\nIn order to sort out the reasons, our reporter traveled there ... On January 11, 2004, our reporter got to Taihuo county, Fuyang city, Anhui province. At the taxi stand, our reporter said that he wanted to go to Gongxiao village. A driver rushed over and said: \"Gongxiao? The village of cripples? I know it well. There are no buses going there. You hire my car and the roundtrip will take five hours. This is the Spring Festival. I won't charge you too much. 300 yuan will do.\" After some bargaining back and forth, our reporter got into the taxi driven by this man who also happened to be named Gong.\n\nAs soon as our reporter got in, the taxi driver began to talk. He said: \"Gongxiao village has plenty of cripples. Each year, they move out in groups and then they return in groups.\" \"Why are there so many cripples in that village? Do they inter-marry among themselves too often?\" Our reporter asked. The driver replied: \"The cripples don't come from the village. They are either bought or rented. When they go outside with the cripples, they say that these are their children. But everybody knows that these are not their children. It is very common to take crippled children to beg in the big cities. The greater the physical handicap, the more money made. The fact that Gongxiao villagers have crippled child beggars is known not just in Gongji town, but all around Taihuo county.\"\n\nHow were the cripples bought or sold? The driver said that he wasn't sure because this was a \"commercial secret.\" But he knew that it was possible to become rich this way. In the last seven or eight years, Gongxiao village has become a wealthy village within the township ...\n\n... It was around 6pm when our reporter got to the village ... he saw that the people entering the village were dressed fashionably -- the men wore western jackets with fur coats and the girls wore brand name down jackets and high-heeled leather boots. This seemed incongruous with the motor tricycles that they came in on.\n\nJust then another tricycle came and people began to unload the 75cm color television set down. The reporter went up and asked: \"This is a remote village. Are you sure that you can get clear reception.\" One of the persons glanced at the reporter and said contemptuously: \"The entire village is hooked up to cable television.\"\n\nIn Gongxiao village, an old man named Wang told our reporter about some inside information:\n\nHe said that Gongxiao village is known as a village of cripples, because its wealth was created by the cripples. These crippled children are their money-makers. When things go well, a child can earn several tens of thousands of yuan. In the beginning, they search for crippled children in the village, then they expand to the entire province, and now they are all over the nation -- Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Gansu, Shaanxi ... the more impoverished places the better the chances. What parent would give away their child? Old Man Wang said that a physically handicapped child is a burden to a peasant family and they couldn't wait to get rid of the child. Sometimes, the parents don't want to give the child away. So they hired their child out as a worker -- the child is given room and board and even remits some money back home. Nowadays, these recruiters of \"crippled children\" are often well-dressed and show up with briefcases and forged letters of introduction to the Association of Physically Handicapped Persons to obtain the lists of physically handicapped children ...\n\nThe police in Gongji town are vexed by these business people. In Gongxiao village, people vie for the more productive cripples. If someone's cripple makes a lot of money, someone might seek out the family and pay double the rental fee. When a \"transfer\" occurs, the old and new renters may come to blows. The police have to deal with these clashes which frequently end in physical injuries.\n\nAccording to information, there are two ways to find physically handicapped children. One way is to rent them with both sides signing a rental agreement. A deposit is paid up front. The price varies: if your hand is crippled, the price is lower at 2,000 yuan per year; if your foot is crippled, the price is higher at 3,000 to 4,000 yuan per year. Generally speaking, the greater the physical handicap, the higher the price; the greater the deformity, the higher the price. This is because the greater the sympathy evoked, the more people are likely to donate.\n\nThe other way is to buy a child outright. This is more expensive. You can take the child away for 6,000 to 7,000 yuan and you make your money back gradually. But this is seldom done. As the children grow older, they are harder to deal with: First, he may go on strike and refuse to work; if his handler beats him, he will call the police, say that this is not his parent, claim physical abuse and kidnapping! Therefore, they will typically rent for a certain time. If the child is any good, he can then go on his own.\n\nAccording to a local resident named Gong, the people who lead cripples outside to beg don't necessarily abandon their farming activities. Each year, they come back during harvest time and they hire people to reap the corn and soya beans. They plant the maize and they go out again with their cripples. They don't tend to the fields themselves but they hire people to look after them at 25 yuan per mu of land (and 35 yuan to harvest the crop). Ordinarily the husband and the wife take one crippled child each and they make 30,000 yuan per year. This is a lot better than farming which will only bring about 4,000 yuan per year. Therefore, many Gongxiao villagers don't farm anymore because they are much better off taking crippled children out to beg. But this does not mean that they have it easy. They have to pay money up front to the parents of the crippled children; they have to take several of them; if something happens (such as a child dying), they have to pay the parents. But most of the time, they will make money. Why else would so many people become wealth? ...\n\n... On the morning of December 25, 2010, Zhejiang province Wenzhou City Yueqing City Puqi Town Zhaiqiao Village former village director Qian Yunhui died after being hit by a construction truck. Afterwards several hundred villagers clashed with the police.\n\nAt around 12:50 on December 25, a netizen with nickname \"The Government Is Openly Killing People\" posted at the local \"Yueqing office workers forum\" under the title: \"(Zhejiang) a suffering Puqi village director, a good village director who served his people was murdered this morning.\" He claimed: \"The deceased is the director of Zhaiqiao village. At the time, someone asked him to go out. Five SWAT police officers held him down on the ground where he was crushed by a vehicle. I will be posting the photos soon. It was a case of government officials commanding a murder, but now it has been turned into a traffic accident.\" This post appeared later at the Tianya Forum. One hour later, it was also cross-posted at the local Wenzhou website \"703804.\"\n\nAt around 8:40 on December 26, the Tencent QQ chat service which has several hundreds of millions of users began to pop out a news story titled <A Zhejiang Yueqing village mayor died in a collision, rumored that he was held down by five persons to be run over>. The content of the news story was basically the same as that in the aforementioned post. The Qian Yunhui affair was quickly disseminated and gained popularity. Within one or two days, it became a red-hot popular discussion topic.\n\nThe Yueqing police conducted an investigation and determined that this was a traffic incident. They announced the finding on the Yueqing government website. But more netizens believed that it was murder. Between December 27 and 29, the Yueqing city public security bureau and the Wenzhou city public security bureau conducted three careful investigations. They excluded the possibility of murder and defined the matter as a traffic incident. Many netizens came to Yueqing to Puqi town, Yueqing city and conducted their own investigations, but they were unable to conclude that this was murder. However, there continued to be doubts on the Internet.\n\nThe \"murder theory\" on the Internet had two \"eyewitnesses.\" One of them is Zhaiqiao villager Qian Chengyu and the other is Huang Diyan, a villager in a neighboring village. According to the rumors, Qian Chengyu personally witnessed four persons holding Qian Yunhui down on the ground and ran over. In the subsequent investigation, Qian Chengyu said that he only saw four persons about 14 to 15 meters away. He never said that Qian Yunhui was held down and ran over. The investigation showed that the four persons were Yueqing Security Service Company security guards who were guarding the cable construction site nearby. They had come over after hearing the noise. As for Huang Diyan, she later admitted that someone convinced her to claim to be an eyewitness when she was in fact not at the scene.\n\nThe Qian Yunhui case was heard in a Yueqing court on February 1, 2011. The Yueqing People's Court sentenced the driver Fei Liangyu to 42 months in prison for causing a traffic incident.\n\nAt around 19:30 on December 6, 2010, it was rumored on the Internet that the master of martial arts novels Jin Yong had passed away. From 20:00 on, the rumors quickly disseminated over the microblogs. By 20:30, the \"death of Jin Yong\" had been forwarded several tens of thousands of times. At 20:40, the rumor was dispelled. Nevertheless many netizens continued to \"pay condolences\" to Mr. Jin Yong.\n\nThe renowned web editor Ying Jianjun told our reporter that \"acts of Internet violence\" such as human flesh search, Internet insults, Internet spoofs and so on are become more and more vicious because of the difficulty in holding the instigator to account. In the name of justice, people pass moral judgment, infringe on other people's freedom of expression, smear their reputations, invade their privacy, etc. At the same time, this also damages the public interest. Within this \"culture of hooliganism,\" someone leads the way to detonate a topic and countless numbers of blind followers rush in. The result is a situation in which public opinion becomes misdirected.\n\nIn October 2009, an Internet post: \"Hebei Rongcheng 'AIDS girl' had sex with 279 'patrons'\" rapidly became popular in Chinese and overseas web forums. The post published the telephone numbers of more than 200 people \"who had sexual contact with the AIDS girl.\" On the morning of October 18, the \"AIDS girl\" named Yan voluntarily went to the Rongcheng Centre for Disease COntrol and asked to be tested for HIV. The centre tested two samples and found both of them to be HIV-negative.\n\nOn October 21, 2009, the Rongcheng police went to Beijing to arrest the propagator of the AIDS girl story Yang Yong. They charged him with libel. According to the police, Yan met Yang Yong in Beijing in March 2008. The two moved in together. During this period, Yang Yong took nude photos of Yan as well as videos of sexual intercourse between the two of them. In June 2009, Yan asked to separate but Yang disagreed. In late August 2009, Yang Yong set up a Sina.com blog and a QQ space in Yan's name. He also uploaded photos and texts to say that Yan now has AIDS, that she was raped by her stepfather, etc. Yang also posted Yan's mobile phone number as well as the telephone numbers of more than 200 persons alleged to be 'patrons' of Yan. Later he also uploaded sex videos. In 2010, the Rongcheng People's Court sentenced Yang Yong to three years in prison for insulting/smearing others.\n\nIn July 14, 2010, the \"Future Star\" brand manager An Yong and the Bosse PR Consultancy met to discuss how to launch an assault on the competitive brand \"QQ Star Infant Milk.\" They decided on an Internet campaign which included: hiring Internet writers to create posts that will appear in almost one hundred different forums; pay popular bloggers to write posts; pay websites to put these posts as recommendations and \"most popular\"; pose as parents and pregnant mothers to discuss and forward these posts. The budget for this campaign was set at 280,000 yuan. According to these posts, \"deep sea fish oil\" is even worse than \"recycled cooking oil\" and warned people to be careful about consuming \"deep sea fish oil\" because the children could develop premature sexual characteristics, etc. For this reason, products such as \"QQ Star Infant Milk\" which contains \"deep sea fish oil\" should be boycotted. This campaign went on for one month. The most popular posts in this lot was viewed more than 200,000 times. The exposure of this incident made netizens more aware of how the hired \"Internet navy\" can control public opinion and turn wrong into right.\n\nAccording to Beijing City Public Security Bureau Network Security Protection Office Network Management Office deputy director Zhang Jun, they have found during the course of their investigations that as many as 50% of the posts at some of the larger Internet forums were artificial \"hypes.\" The so-called \"hot posts\" and \"excellent posts\" are seldom spontaneously written and commented upon. Instead, they almost always have \"Internet promoters\" actively pushing them behind the scene.\n\nInternet media experts say that many netizens were often led by these malicious Internet promoters to ignore the truth and form unreasonable opinions instead. As a result, Internet public opinion is becoming further and further away from the truth.\n\n\"My dad is Li Gang\" was hyped up on the Internet. A netizen then disclosed that Li Gang owns five houses in Baoding city. The first one is at Baoding city Nanshi district Mediterranean Villas third section unit D01; the second one is at Diamond Gala Garden in Nanshi district; the third one is at Gelingmantou on Northern Sunshine Street; the fourth one is a 80-square-meter commercial shop at number 357 Gingko Road, Gaoxin District, Baoding City; the fifth is a commercial space on the eighth floor of the Bank of China building at number 59, Chaoyang Road, Baoding City. The Baoding city public security bureau disciplinary committee and the Baoding city Communist Party disciplinary committee sent a joint investigation team to check these five locations. They found the Internet information to be inaccurate. Three of the units were owned by other persons. The highest street number on Gingko Road is 285, so number 357 doesn't exist; the Bank of China said that the eighth floor of their building is their own office space which has never been rented out or sold.\n\nIn late 2010, someone on the Internet said that \"a lawyer has disclosed that the Heibei University traffic incident has been settled\" and \"Li Qiming was sentenced to 3 years in prison served at home.\" The Baoding City Public Security Bureau Political Department deputy director Guo Lei said that the case was a criminal case in which the procuratorate has filed charges. As a result, there is no such thing as a settlement. It may be that Li Qiming's representative has reached a civil settlement with the family of the victim. But Li Qiming will still have to face a court trial because he was suspected of breaking the law. According to the police, Li Qiming was still in detention awaiting trial. On January 26, the case was heard in the Wangdu county People's Court. On January 30, the court sentenced Li Qiming to six years in prison.\n\nAccording to Shanghai City Public Security Bureau Network Security Protection Division captain Chen Chao: \"Some people have the erroneous belief that you can do anything you want on the Internet. They neglect to find out what can and what cannot be done. All these harmful things on the Internet will eventually create genuine social damage.\"\n\nChina Ethnic University School of Journalism and Communication professor Zhang Zhi said that anyone who spreads false information has legal responsibility regardless of the result. The Internet service providers also have legal responsibility because they provided service to spread the false information. All of these will depend on more precise and workable legal clarifications ...\n\nThe spreading of \"My dad is Li Gang\" is undoubtedly a joint victory for \"group-gazing\" in the microblog era and the relentless investigation by traditional media.\n\nRevolving around the phrase \"My dad is Li Gang,\" netizens used their imagination to create sayings, photographs, music, etc to highlight the dramatic nature while expressing their strong dissatisfaction against the children of senior government officials.\n\nThe dissemination of these messages also bears the special characteristics of the microblog era. That is to say, anything that matches current social sentiments will spread out faster; anything that is easier to turn into a symbol/icon will spread out faster; conversely anything th"
