Ask PCCW chairman Richard Li Tzar-kai.\n\nThe second son of Li Ka-shing gave Hong Kong's richest man a grandson with the help of the delightfully beautiful Isabella Leong Lok-si.\n\nThe hardest part was the name, of course, and the two tycoons kept it all in the family: Grandpa Li named the boy Li Chang-zhi while the father christened him Ethan.\n\nLeong's manager, Michelle Lo, said the big day was on April 26, with Ethan Li weighing in at seven pounds.\n\nThe actress, who will be 21 this month, opted for a natural birth and was ably supported throughout by Richard Li, pictured with Little Ethan and Isabella Leong.\n\nLeong is said to have no plans to return to work, and that may be just as well, given the actress was involved in a contractual dispute with Emperor Entertainment Group in April last year, when the Eurasian actress was accused of breaking a 10-year contract her mother struck for her when she was only 12 years old.\n\nThe legal battle ended in an out-of-court settlement eight months later.\n\nLittle Ethan is only the latest little bundle of joy for Li Ka-shing, who has been blessed with three granddaughters and a grandson from Victor Li Tzai-kuoi."
