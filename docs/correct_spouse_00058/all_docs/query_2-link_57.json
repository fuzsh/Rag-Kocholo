        "text": "This week has been incredibly busy but so fulfilling! I had the pleasure of meeting with remarkable individuals who each brought unique experiences and valuable perspectives. First, I had the chance to reconnect with Nicole Sierra Rolet, a wonderful friend who is currently spending a year at Harvard University as a Fellowship Partner with her husband, Xavier R. Rolet, the former CEO of the London Stock Exchange, whom I have known for years and who has always been a huge inspiration to me. It was great to hear about Nicole‚Äôs thriving wine company Ch√™ne Bleu Wines and beautiful vineyard and to catch up with her. Next, I visited J.P. Morgan and met with my good friend Patricia Brolly and her wonderful team‚ÄîKatherine F., Cecil Peters, and Hannah Carley-Broom. I am immensely grateful for their hosting and continued support of the Women of the Future Programme. Pat is a never-ending ray of sunshine in my life, and I am so thankful for her friendship over the years. I had a delightful lunch with Tetyana Antsupova, The British Academy Research Fellow from Ukraine. Her wisdom and graciousness were truly inspiring. It was lovely catching up with Simon Collins at the stunning Oswald Club. Simon, formerly with KPMG and now Chairs several Advisory Boards, including Kubrick Group and Big Technologies PLC, shared his incredible journey and accomplishments since we last met. I also met with Sunil Nayak, Zone President Europe at Sodexo. He has steadfastly supported the Women of the Future Programme, and it is always a privilege to spend time with him and pick his brain. Sunil introduced me to Jean Renton the CFO of Sodexo UK & Ireland. It was great to meet her and learn about her work. The week concluded with a delightful garden party hosted by the Hilton London Bankside, where I had the opportunity to catch up with the lovely Cherrie Lo ÁõßÊõâÂ©∑ of Fortnum & Mason, Raoul De Souza and Amit Lamba, the owner of Laguna Catering. Meeting such inspiring people and hearing their different stories always reenergizes me. Networking truly is powerful ‚Äì it‚Äôs amazing how much we can learn from each other. If you met me, you know I always encourage everyone to speak to at least five people they don‚Äôt know at these gatherings, and it is because, in the words of Susan RoAne, ‚ÄúThe power of networking lies not just in who you know, but in who knows you.‚Äù #Networking #Leadership #WomenOfTheFuture #Inspiration #Connections\n\nLast week was extraordinary, brimming with opportunities to network, forge new connections, and rekindle old ones. I am thrilled to share some highlights with you! On Monday evening, we had the pleasure of hosting a wonderful reception and panel discussion for the Women of the Future Network, our first in association with Rio Tinto, at their stunning London venue. It was such a joy to witness so many extraordinary women come together, each bringing their unique energy and perspectives. Our phenomenal panellists‚ÄîSukki Menon, Josefa Gonzalez Blanco Ortiz Mena, Rhona Hunt, and Lucy Yurek‚Äîshared stories and wisdom. They spoke on the importance of letting our individuality shine brightly, embracing authenticity in everything we do, and taking time to look within to ensure our actions align with our beliefs. Authenticity is something I‚Äôve always admired in others and cultivated in myself. It was heartening to hear its importance recognised in the context of life, business, and leadership, as it is so often overlooked. I was not alone in leaving the event energised and uplifted by the powerful conversations and meaningful connections. Thank you to everyone who participated and made it unforgettable! A few days later, I had the immense honour of attending a special ceremony at the beautiful Goldsmiths‚Äô Hall, where my dear friend Richard Reid was announced as the Prime Warden of The Goldsmiths' Company, one of the oldest livery companies dedicated to the craft of goldsmithing and silversmithing. I was absolutely (and ironically!) speechless when he asked me to be the guest speaker. It was a privilege to visit such a historic venue and support Richard, one of the most humble and kind individuals I know. I couldn‚Äôt think of a better person to receive this honour. The decor was stunning, and there was a beautiful exhibition featuring silver pieces by Richard Fox, which were absolutely gorgeous. I was also struck by the tall, elaborate ceilings and the chairs, which featured the Company‚Äôs motto: ‚ÄúJustitia Virtutum Regina,‚Äù meaning ‚ÄúJustice is the Queen of Virtues.‚Äù In the spirit of authenticity earlier in the week, it reminded me that the importance of fairness and integrity in all our endeavours transcends all, even centuries! Thank you, Richard and Jane, for this incredible evening, and thanks to everyone who was there to celebrate this special occasion. Wishing you all the best in your new role as Prime Warden!

Bringing people together has always been my favourite, and spending one-on-one time with our amazing shortlist was such a joy. Learning about the incredible things they do left me feeling incredibly inspired. I couldn't be prouder of our 25th-anniversary cohort. The homecooked food, the atmosphere, and the beautiful sunshine made it a perfect day. I hope everyone enjoyed it as much as I did. The power of connections made this way is truly remarkable, and I encourage everyone to keep in touch with each other. The potential for future collaborations is boundless‚Äîyou never know what could come of it! Thank you all for making it so special. I'm so excited to see all the amazing things you will achieve in the future!

Last Thursday night at the AWA Awards at Hilton London Bankside was truly magical. Standing on the stage for my opening speech, surrounded by 420 incredible (and ever so glamorous!) guests, I could not help but feel a deep sense of pride and gratitude. When I founded the AWA Awards some 25 years ago, it was because I saw a glaring gap. There were no awards recognizing the incredible contributions of Asian women in the UK and no community of like-minded women for them to turn to, learn from and grow with. I knew we needed to change that. Seeing these remarkable women being spotlit for their achievements in various fields, from sports to legal to art and media, filled my heart with joy. I have long dreamed of creating a platform where Asian women are seen, heard and celebrated. Since 1999, we have had 269 award winners and 1188 shortlisted candidates, each incredibly deserving. These awards have always been about highlighting those often overshadowed, and it‚Äôs been a privilege to see our impact over the years. I am incredibly proud that young Asian girls in Britain today can look up to these fantastic role models and believe they can achieve anything they set their minds to. The diversity and strength of our community were on full display that night, showing everyone that when we believe in ourselves, we can accomplish incredible things. Congratulations to all the winners! Your achievements inspire us all. Please continue trailblazing and being unapologetically and unabashedly yourselves: Amina Khan, Tanuj Kapilashrami, Sukki Menon, Crystelle P., Dr Narisa Chauvidul-Aw, Arunima Misra, Jasmine Dotiwala, Charan Kaur Dhesi, Eleena Misra K.C., Manjinder Virk, Diana Chao, Fawzia Koofi, Sheherazad Kapadia I am also profoundly grateful to our sponsor NatWest Group, our award presenters and steadfast supporters who have been with us through the years: HRH Princess Badiya bint El Hassan, Cherie Blair CBE (Cherie Booth K.C.), Sir Nick Young, Chantel Moore ACMA, CGMA, Kaushik Guha, Judith McKenna, Farrah Qureshi, Riz Lateef, Kate Aldridge, Josefa Gonzalez Blanco Ortiz Mena, Baroness Susan Greenfield, Prini Pithouse, Kate Quilton, Marco Donzelli, Nikesh Mehta, Rukasana Bhaijee, Sir David Walker, Tamara Box, Harleen Deol, Alex Morgan-Moodie, Alastair King, Caroline Howarth, Baroness Valerie Amos, Sapna Dattani Without your support and belief in our mission, AWA would not be what it is today. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. Although the awards night is behind us, I cannot wait to see what is next for this year‚Äôs cohort of Asian Women of Achievement! Here‚Äôs to many more years of celebrating and empowering Asian women in the UK! #AWAAwards #AWA25 #WomenInLeadership #DiversityAndInclusion #BelieveInYourself\n\nWelcome to our latest newsletter! This year has already been incredibly eventful, filled with excitement and remarkable achievements. One such highlight for me is deeply personal, and it is the release of my new book, ‚ÄúSome Kind of Wonderful: The Magic Life Has Taught Me,‚Äù co-authored with the wonderful Rachel Murphy. This memoir is a heartfelt journey through my life, celebrating the remarkable stories and invaluable lessons learned along the way. From my early days in the UK, where my passion for cooking led to two culinary books, to the founding of the Women of the Future Programme, each chapter is a dive into the understanding of sustainable success, sprinkled with a pinch of humour and many insights on kindness, leadership, and friendship. I hope this book inspires you to reflect on the legacy you are leaving behind and how much value kindness has in your life. Don‚Äôt miss your chance to pre-order the book today at https://lnkd.in/eHGt6kUm While on the topic of new beginnings, I am excited to share that we have new sponsorships this year: Rio Tinto for the Women of the Future Network and Beazley for the Ambassadors Programme. Their support drives our initiatives forward, and we are thrilled to partner with them! In this edition, we will look back at the wonderful events that have taken place and share exciting upcoming ones as we look forward to the summer and the warm weather it will bring. I hope you enjoy this latest newsletter instalment and feel inspired by the incredible, vibrant community we are building together, thanks to all of you.

This week, I‚Äôm excited to share a short video where I talk about kindness - a principle dear to my heart and central to my work and my new book. In ‚ÄòSome Kind of Wonderful: The Magic Life Has Taught Me,‚Äô I delve into the profound impact acts of kindness can have on us and those around us. One of my favourite sayings, which has long become my mantra, is: ‚ÄòYou have not lived a perfect day unless you have done something for someone who can never repay you.‚Äô This philosophy is a guiding light in my life. Sometimes, when I leave home, I carry a few chocolate coins, handing them out to people I meet along the way, and their smiles never cease to brighten my day. Kindness doesn‚Äôt need to be grand or complex‚Äîit just needs to be heartfelt. I have been so blessed to have received immense kindness over the years that I continuously try to give back and encourage others to do the same. In my memoir, I reminisce on the stories from my past that blend lessons of generosity, connection, and self-reflection. From helping a stranger to offering a simple act of kindness to a friend to recognising the kindness of others, each story is there to encourage you never to underestimate its powerful ripple effects and its capacity to transform your actions, thoughts, and emotions. I invite you to pre-order your copy today and dive into the pages filled with personal anecdotes, insights and lessons learned from a life of embracing others with an open heart. I hope it inspires you to open your heart at home and work and be kinder to yourself and others. Visit https://lnkd.in/eHGt6kUm to secure your copy and discover more details. Thank you so much for your ongoing support! I would love to hear about acts of kindness that have touched your life recently.

The room was alive with the buzz of conversations, the clinking of glasses, and the shared pride for this incredible milestone. I can still hardly believe it! It was profoundly heartwarming to see so many faces that have been with me through different chapters of my life‚Äîclassmates from my school days in Calcutta, my lovely team, and my cherished supporters and friends, some of whom have stood by my side for over 30 years. Your support has been a constant in my life, helping me realize this project and so many other dreams along the way. A huge thank you to Alex Wallace, a Women of the Future alumna who won in our Sports Category in 2017, whose moving speech was so kind and the perfect way to open the evening. Seeing the copies of my book lined up, the story of my life laid out in black and white was a surreal moment for me. Each page reflects the challenges faced and overcome, a testament to the power of resilience and learning. It was a poignant reminder of how much life can challenge and transform us. ‚ÄúIn the end, we all become stories‚Äù (Margaret Atwood), and I hope my story, with all its ups and downs, helps others navigate their paths with kindness and humility. Having my grandchildren, my husband and two of my sons there made the evening all the more special. This book is part of the legacy I want to leave behind for them, and I hope that they, and perhaps you, too, will find inspiration in its pages. The book remains available on our website at https://lnkd.in/eHGt6kUm for those who could not join us on this occasion. Please take a moment to explore it and find your meaning in the wisdom I have shared, which was gathered from some of the most incredible people I met along the way and made my own through lived experience. To all who were there and those who were there in spirit, thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your presence in my life enriches me, and your support continues to make the impossible possible.
