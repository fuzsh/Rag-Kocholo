        "text": "In a recent episode of the Chinese talk show \"A Date With Luyu,\" actress Isabella Leong candidly revisited her relationship with Hong Kong billionaire Richard Li, more than a decade after their parting in 2011. Leong, 35, expressed her sentiments, stating that she holds no regrets about their past romance, despite the challenges they faced.\n\nLeong, who originally hails from Macau, disclosed her desire for a family of her own during the show. She shared, \"Looking back, I don't regret it... If I had to choose again, I'd still make the same choice. I really did long for a family of my own.\" This glimpse into Leong's perspective sheds light on the deep emotions and aspirations that guided her choices during that period.\n\nThe actress revealed that she had considered marrying Li, who is the younger son of Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka Shing and 57 years old at the time of their relationship. However, she ultimately decided to end the romance due to concerns about Li's popularity with women. \"I couldn't accept that. I needed more security in my life,\" Leong explained. This revelation provides a nuanced understanding of the personal struggles and expectations that can influence decisions in high-profile relationships."
