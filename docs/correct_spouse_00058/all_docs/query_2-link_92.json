        "text": "Totally pulled this off the net but I thought it was hilarious. Especially since I’m studying Finance and all that jazzzahh! *HAPPEHDANCE*\n\nAt the end of the day – the guy’s just saying that a good personality is a positive exponential that increases with age, whereas looks are a dire negative exponential that deteriorates with age. GETITGETITGETITGETIT?!?!\n\nSo here you go. READ IT!\n\nA reply from CEO of J.P. Morgan to a pretty girl seeking a rich husband\n\nA young and pretty lady posted this on a popular forum:\n\nTitle: What should I do to marry a rich guy?\n\nI’m going to be honest of what I’m going to say here.\n\nI’m 25 this year. I’m very pretty, have style and good taste. I wish to marry a guy with $500k annual salary or above.\n\nYou might say that I’m greedy, but an annual salary of $1M is considered only as middle class in New York.\n\nMy requirement is not high. Is there anyone in this forum who has an income of $500k annual salary? Are you all married?\n\nI wanted to ask: what should I do to marry rich persons like you?\n\nAmong those I’ve dated, the richest is $250k annual income, and it seems that this is my upper limit.\n\nIf someone is going to move into high cost residential area on the west of New York City Garden(?), $250k annual income is not enough.\n\nI’m here humbly to ask a few questions:\n\n1) Where do most rich bachelors hang out? (Please list down the names and addresses of bars, restaurant, gym)\n\n2) Which age group should I target?\n\n3) Why most wives of the riches are only average-looking? I’ve met a few girls who don’t have looks and are not interesting, but they are able to marry rich guys.\n\n4) How do you decide who can be your wife, and who can only be your girlfriend? (my target now is to get married)\n\nMs. Pretty\n\nA philosophical reply from CEO of J.P. Morgan:\n\nDear Ms. Pretty,\n\nI have read your post with great interest. Guess there are lots of girls out there who have similar questions like yours. Please allow me to analyse your situation as a professional investor.\n\nMy annual income is more than $500k, which meets your requirement, so I hope everyone believes that I’m not wasting time here.\n\nFrom the standpoint of a business person, it is a bad decision to marry you. The answer is very simple, so let me explain.\n\nPut the details aside, what you’re trying to do is an exchange of “beauty” and “money” : Person A provides beauty, and Person B pays for it, fair and square.\n\nHowever, there’s a deadly problem here, your beauty will fade, but my money will not be gone without any good reason. The fact is, my income might increase from year to year, but you can’t be prettier year after year.\n\nHence from the viewpoint of economics, I am an appreciation asset, and you are a depreciation asset. It’s not just normal depreciation, but exponential depreciation. If that is your only asset, your value will be much worse 10 years later.\n\nBy the terms we use in Wall Street, every trading has a position, dating with you is also a “trading position”.\n\nIf the trade value dropped we will sell it and it is not a good idea to keep it for long term – same goes with the marriage that you wanted. It might be cruel to say this, but in order to make a wiser decision any assets with great depreciation value will be sold or “leased”.\n\nAnyone with over $500k annual income is not a fool; we would only date you, but will not marry you. I would advice that you forget looking for any clues to marry a rich guy. And by the way, you could make yourself to become a rich person with $500k annual income.This has better chance than finding a rich fool.\n\nHope this reply helps.\n\nsigned,\n\nJ.P. Morgan CEO\n\nFUNNY YEH? I mean I agree to an extent but…………men are men and being a rich one doesn’t make you a wise man.\n\nBut please – you just have a look at the trillionaires in Hong Kong and their wives, a.k.a “FOOT TAIS” they’re all just pretty much looks. But I mean – who knows – they might have the most amazing personality too!\n\nLET’S HAVE A LOOK! (And trust me to know my Foot-Tais)\n\nI’m only going to name them – because their occupations are pretty much “Model/Pageant/Actress and Business Tycoon”.\n\nMichelle Reis and Julian Hui\n\nRandom Trivia: Julian and his ex-wife had a wedding banquet that went for 3 days and 3 nights. DAYUMMM.\n\nGigi Lai and Patrick Ma Ting-Kung\n\nIsabella Leong and Richard Li (SON OF LI KA SHING LOLOLOLOL) Had children together but they never actually married.\n\nCathy Tsui and Martin Lee.\n\nCOOLBEANS.\n\nBut personally I feel that if you do want to live the luxurious lifestyle – study a bit more and fulfill it yourself!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
