        "text": "2008 American adventure film, third installment in the \"Mummy\" series directed by Rob CohenTemplate:SHORTDESC:2008 American adventure film, third installment in the \"Mummy\" series directed by Rob Cohen\n\nThe Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor[2] is a 2008 American action-adventure fantasy film, directed by Rob Cohen, written by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, and produced by Stephen Sommers (director of the first two films), Bob Ducsay, Sean Daniel, and James Jacks.[3] The film is set in China, departing from the Egyptian setting, and focusses on the origins of the Terracotta Army. It is the sequel to The Mummy (1999) and The Mummy Returns (2001), and the third and final installment in The Mummy trilogy. The film stars Brendan Fraser, Jet Li, Maria Bello, John Hannah, Luke Ford, Anthony Wong and Michelle Yeoh.\n\nThe Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor premiered in Moscow on July 24, 2008 and was released in the United States on August 1, 2008. The film received mostly negative reviews from critics and grossed $403 million worldwide, the lowest-grossing film of the trilogy. A sequel was in the works, titled, The Mummy: Rise of the Aztec with Fraser, Hannah, Ford and Bello reprising their roles and Antonio Banderas to play the villain. However, the film was cancelled and Universal Pictures instead opted to release a reboot in 2017 as an attempt to start the Dark Universe franchise.\n\nPlot[]\n\nIn ancient China, a brutal and tyrannical warlord unites the country's kingdoms into an empire and becomes the Dragon Emperor. He orders the construction of the Great Wall of China to bury and curse his dead enemies, eventually learning power over the traditional Chinese Wu Xing elements of fire, water, earth, wood and metal. The Emperor soon grows fearful that his death will end all he has accomplished and summons Zi Yuan, a sorceress who is said to know the secret of immortality. He sends her with General Ming, his trusted friend to an ancient monastery. There, Ming and Yuan find a spellbook known as the Oracle Bones where love blossoms between them while the Emperor also lusts for the latter. There, the two sleep together without dress and have sex. Having witnessed this, the Emperor kills Ming after having Yuan perform the procedures and then stabs her with a dagger, but having foreseen this event, she immolates and imprisons the Emperor and his soldiers in clay, turning them into the Terracotta Army, and flees.\n\nIn 1946, Alex O'Connell, Rick and Evelyn O'Connell's son, and his archaeology professor Roger Wilson locate the emperor's tomb. Though attacked by a mysterious woman, they succeed in bringing the sarcophagus to Shanghai. Meanwhile, the British government entrusts the O'Connells to take the Eye of Shangri-La gemstone back to China. However, they learn that Wilson works for a rogue military faction led by General Yang, who had provided the financial backing of Alex's expedition. Yang believes that the Emperor is the one who can lead China out of the chaos following World War II and plans to resurrect him using the Eye, which contains the Elixir of Life. They open it, but it accidentally lands on the statue of the carriage driver, which is soon revealed to be the Emperor's mummified body. He accepts Yang's service but kills Wilson and escapes, despite the O'Connells' attempt to stop him in a pursuit.\n\nAlong with Evelyn's brother Jonathan Carnahan, the O'Connells and the mysterious woman, Lin, travel to a stupa in the Himalayas that will reveal the path to Shangri-La when the Eye is placed on top of it. With the help of Yetis summoned by Lin, the group hold off Yang's soldiers but the Emperor discovers Shangri-La's location. Alex attempts to trigger an avalanche. The Emperor throws a sword at him, but Rick shoves Alex aside and is stabbed instead. Lin takes the group to Shangri-La, where Zi Yuan still lives and heals Rick's wound. The group discovers that Lin is Zi Yuan's daughter, both rendered immortal due to the power of Shangri-La's waters. As Rick heals, Alex and Lin have grown attached to each other, but Lin refuses due to her immortality, unable to bear falling in love with Alex only to watch him grow old and die, just as Zi Yuan mourned for General Ming.\n\nThe Emperor and General Yang eventually arrive and attack them in Shangri-La and the Emperor bathes in the mystical waters, which not only restores his human form and youth, but also allows him to shapeshift. Transforming into a three-headed dragon, he kidnaps Lin and flies back to the tomb, raising his Terracota Army, and gives a speech declaring his intention to conquer the world before sending his soldiers to go past the Great Wall, after which they will be invincible. The O'Connells and Zi Yuan pursue their foe to the Great Wall where Zi Yuan sacrifices her and Lin's immortality to create an undead army from beneath The Great Wall, led by a revived General Ming. As Alex rescues Lin, Zi Yuan fights the Emperor and is mortally wounded, but secures the dagger. Zi Yuan gives the dagger to the group before dying. Meanwhile, the Emperor goes into the Great Wall to use his elemental powers to negate the undead spell. Rick and Alex attack him while Evelyn and Lin fight and kill Yang and Choi. The Emperor gains the upper hand over Rick, but Rick and Alex manage to stab him in his heart with the broken dagger, killing him and defeating the Terracotta Army. Ming's army briefly celebrates before turning into dust and disappearing into the air to rest in peace.\n\nThe O'Connells and Lin return to Shanghai, where Lin and Alex start a relationship, while Jonathan decides to move to Peru with the Eye of Shangri-La, as he wants to go somewhere with no mummies, only for credits on the screen to reveal that mummies were recently discovered there.\n\nCast[]\n\nMain article: List of The Mummy characters\n\nBrendan Fraser as Rick O'Connell, a retired adventurer, Evelyn's husband and Alex's father.\n\nJet Li as Emperor Han, a warlord who desired immortality.

(Incidentally, the Terracotta Army is actually mentioned at the end of the novelization as something that will be discovered in the future, although its relation to The Emperor's army, or rather how the destroyed army made it into the site, is left unexplained.)[6]\n\nWriting[]\n\nAn early version of Gough and Millar's script contained many callbacks to the previous films that went unused. The original prologue had Zi Yuan (Zohora) going to Hamunaptra and making a terracotta copy of the Book of the Dead, featuring the puzzle box key from the first film. Instead of the Oracle Bones, the book's terracotta copy was used to curse the Emperor and his army. The book would also be used to resurrect the Emperor instead of the Elixir of Life. Jonathan not only named his nightclub after Imhotep, but the barmaids were styled with Anck-Su-Namun's bodypaint. The Bembridge Scholars that Evy frequently mentioned in the first film would have returned in a minor role as the character Sir Colin Willoughby, the head of the society, would play a role in the Dragon Emperor's resurrection in Wilson's place. In the second film, Meela says three men will \"receive their [your] just rewards.\" The Emperor Mummy says Yang (Okumura) will get his reward when the Emperor conquers the larger world. During the final battle, Alex's slingshot would return to play a vital role in defeating the Emperor.\n\nLike the previous films, this early draft contained more body horror elements, including Okumura's arm being eaten by a crocodile, maggots, bone fragments, and fossilized guts seeping through the Emperor Mummy's wounds. Upon becoming immortal, the Emperor forms a new brain and eyeball, and skin grafts over his cracked body. In his mummy form, the Dragon Emperor shared a few similarities with Imhotep: They both drain people's lifeforce to heal themselves (in doing so, the Emperor, however, also turns his victims into terracotta and shatters them); after draining one character, the Emperor Mummy inherits his victim's blue eyes, like Imhotep did in one scene of the second movie; Just as Imhotep made impressions of his face in sand and water in the first and second films, respectively, the Emperor Mummy does the same during the avalanche, making his face appear in the snow. The mummification sequence was also more graphic as the Emperor's heart would've been made visible through his chest, pumping black blood through his veins and out of his pores. His clothes and body would then be covered by molten clay before being superheated and hardened by intense white light beams from within him.\n\nThe script showed the Emperor as having a more ruthless personality. He sends Zohora to Hamunaptra under the threat of killing her lover Ming Guo (Sun Tzu) if she fails to return within 90 days, only to present her with his head in a box when she does. When he becomes immortal, the Emperor puts a searing finger to Okumura's forehead, makes him kneel, and pledge his loyalty. He kisses Zohora to simultaneously spite her and curse her by turning her and the other immortals in Shangri-La to terracotta statues. Then, as he takes Lin (Lily Chen), the Emperor tells her that she will pay for her mother's sins by sharing his bed as his queen. During the climax, the Emperor punishes Okumura for his failure by encasing him in a giant brass lantern.\n\nThe script took place in 1940 during World War II instead of afterward. Rick and Evy are introduced in Agra, India, acting as spies for the British government, observing Okumura believing he has a secret weapon for the Japanese to win the war, later revealed to be the Emperor. With the backdrop of the war, the script shows the tensions between the Chinese and Japanese, with one scene in Imhotep's where Jonathan calms a dispute between the O'Connells' friend and Chinese resistance member, Chang, and Japanese Major Suki. Another later had the O'Connells reluctantly forced to stand back and watch Chang get captured by Japanese troops, who were previously noted to collect insurgents and send them on trains to work camps. It's revealed that despite Rick and Evy sending Alex to Yale to protect him, he left his freshman year without their knowledge and failed to enlist in the army before being called by Willoughby to work with him. Later, rather than Rick being mortally wounded by the Emperor Mummy, Alex would have taken the hit to save his dad.\n\nOther notable differences between the script and film include Shangri-La being depicted as a lush utopia filled with people from various eras. The Dragon Emperor showed more of his mastery over the five Chinese elements: freezing and unfreezing a river to escape, rapidly shooting fireballs from his hands, making \"snow arms\" to drag his enemies under, and making a raincloud with water from the Spring of Eternal Life to raise his army. He also doesn't gain the ability to shapeshift. No undead warriors are risen to fight the Terracotta Army; many Chinese slave workers and other prisoners the Japanese took, including Chang, ward off the Emperor's army. Instead of the one-on-one fight between Rick and the Dragon Emperor, the O'Connells try to complete a ritual involving the five elements to unlock the \"River of Spirits\" beneath the Great Wall to defeat the terracotta soldiers as the Emperor tries to stop them.\n\nCasting[]\n\nIn March 2006, actor Oded Fehr, who played Ardeth Bay in the first two films said Sommers had told him a third film was in development and being written, with only Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz's characters returning.[7] The following September, Universal Pictures offered director Joe Johnston the helm, instead of Jurassic World but Johnston declined.[8] Later in the month, Weisz expressed interest in reprising her role.[9]\n\nIn January 2007, Universal announced Sommers would not be attached to direct the third film. It was then announced that Universal entered talks with director Rob Cohen to take over directing duties.[10] Later in the month, the story was revealed to center around Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz's characters, as well as their adult son. Negotiations with the actors were in progress at that time.[11] In February, casting began for the role of Alex O'Connell. Additionally, John Hannah reprised his role as Jonathan.[2] Also in that month, Cohen mentioned that Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh would star in the film although the official confirmation wasn't published until May.[12][13]\n\nIn April, Brendan Fraser re-joined the cast for the film.[14] Weisz did not, citing \"problems with the script\" in addition to having just given birth to her son.[15][16] The film was shot in Montreal[17] and China. The film was originally reported to be titled The Mummy 3: Curse of the Dragon.[18] In April, Luke Ford was cast as Alex O'Connell,[19] replacing Freddie Boath in the role and in May, Maria Bello was cast to replace Weisz in the role of Evelyn. Bello commented during an interview that the new \"Evy\" is different from the original \"Evy\". \"She has the same name, but she is quite a different character,\" said Bello.[20] At a news conference in Shanghai, Bello told the audience that Rob Cohen has \"created a new Evelyn. In the first two Mummy movies she was all actiony and lovely, but this Evelyn might be a little more... forceful in terms of her martial art skills and shooting skills\".[21]\n\nFilming[]\n\nPrincipal photography started at Montreal's Mel's Cite du Cinéma. There, the Eye of Shangri-la scenes were shot by production designer Nigel Phelps. The team then shot on the courtyard set of gateway to Shangri-la. The courtyard was dressed with fake snow, created by effects supervisor Bruce Steinheimer's team.[22]\n\nAt the city's ADF stage, Phelps's team created sets of the Terra Cotta mausoleum. Set decorator Anne Kuljian designed 20 different statue heads that were sculpted by 3D Arts team and interchanged between shots. One soldier and horse statue was bought from China, and copies of it as well as \"The Dragon Emperor\" were made (Jet Li's statue was sculpted by Lucie Fournier, Tino Petronzio, and Nick Petronzio in a workshop in Montreal). Propmaster Kim Wai Chung supervised the making of the horses’ bridles and mausoleum ornaments in China. Meanwhile, at Mel's, the brutal battle between the Emperor and Rick was filmed, the first scene shot with Jet Li.[22][23]\n\nOn October 15, 2007, the team moved to China. At Shanghai Studios, a set depicting the city in the 1940s was used for the chase sequence and was shot in three weeks. General Yang's camp was filmed in a Ming village near Tian Mo. At the studio, Chinese cultural advisers aided Cohen in depicting the Qin Dynasty language and ceremonies.[22] The O'Connell family's drama scenes were shot in an Egyptian-themed nightclub suitably named \"Imhotep's\".[24]\n\nThe crew frequently had to halt in and near Shanghai when soldiers marched. The desert battlefield's setting was actually a training facility for the Chinese army that was leased.[25]\n\nEffects[]\n\nThe visual effects were done by two Los Angeles-based VFX houses. Rhythm and Hues Studios designed the Yetis and dragons, while Digital Domain handled the battle scenes with the Emperor's terracotta warriors. The pool of water resembling diamonds took Rhythm and Hues eleven months to complete.[26] The A.I. software Massive, used for the Lord of the Rings films, was used to create the undead battle scenes.\n\nDesign company Imaginary Forces created the opening title sequence and end titles. IF designers also shot real paint splatters and brushstrokes. To portray an \"accurate and historic China,\" they turned to calligrapher T.Z. Yuan for ink brush writing.[27]\n\nMusic[]\n\nTemplate:More citations needed section\n\nTemplate:Album ratings Most of the film's score was composed by Randy Edelman and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. The soundtrack features numerous different Chinese and Middle Eastern ethnic instruments along with classic British folklore. The soundtrack was released on July 29, 2008,[28] by Varèse Sarabande label, two days before the film's release. Composer John Debney (who had previously scored the music for the Mummy franchise's spin-off The Scorpion King) provided additional re-scored material for most of the bigger action sequences. The Hollywood Studio Symphony recorded 30 minutes of Debney's music in less than ten hours at the Fox Scoring Stage in July 2008, shortly before the film's release, however, the soundtrack album features Edelman's score and none of Debney's. The trailer prominently features the cues \"Armada\" by Two Steps From Hell and \"DNA Reactor\" by Pfeifer Broz. Music, the latter which also plays at the end of the Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix trailer. It also plays Vampire Hunters by Wojciech Kilar, which was used in the trailers of the first and second films.\n\nThe soundtrack features \"The Flower Duet\" by Léo Delibes from his opera Lakmé.\n\nReception[]\n\nMarketing[]\n\nThe Mummy Movie Prequel: The Rise & Fall of Xango's Ax, a comic book limited series by IDW Publishing, was published to promote the film. The comic explores the relationship between Rick and his son Alex.[29]\n\nSierra Entertainment made a game version of The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor for Wii, PlayStation 2, and Nintendo DS, which was released on July 22, 2008, in North America to mostly negative reviews.[30] Gameloft made game version of The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor for mobile phones.[31]\n\nBox office[]\n\nThe film premiered in Moscow on July 24, 2008, and had a wide release of 3,760 theatres in North America on August 1, 2008.[32]\n\nThe film was the top-grossing film the day it opened, earning $15.2 million (The Dark Knight was in second place with $12 million) on Friday. However, the film did not become number one overall in the box office on opening weekend, claiming only $40.4 million, which allowed The Dark Knight to claim the top spot for the third consecutive week with $42.6 million.[33]\n\nThe film however scored a bigger success at the international box office where it opened at the first position in 26 of the 28 released markets over the weekend and grossed over $59.5 million in the three-day period.[34] It substantially outpaced comparable openings for The Mummy ($16.7 million) and The Mummy Returns ($21.5 million) in the same markets.[35] The film also set opening records for the distributor in Korea (drawing $13.3 million), Russia ($12.7 million), Spain ($6.7 million), and Thailand.[35] As of October 10, 2008, the film's domestic total stands at $102,491,776, with a much stronger international intake of $298,636,863. This brings its worldwide total to $401,128,639.[36][37] It is the lowest-grossing film in The Mummy trilogy.[38]\n\nCritical response[]\n\nAs of October 2020, on Rotten Tomatoes, the film had an approval rating of 12%, based on 177 reviews, with an average rating of 3.69/10. The site's critical consensus read, \"With middling CG effects and a distinct lack of fun, The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor finds the series past its prime.\"[39] As of October 2020, on Metacritic, the film had a score of 31 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".[40] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B−\" on an A+ to F scale.[41]\n\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a positive review, awarding it three out of four stars. Ebert remarked, \"Now why did I like this movie? It was just plain dumb fun, is why.\" Ebert also stated that it is the best in the series.[42] Nathan Rabin of The Onion's A.V. Club stated that the film \"succeeds largely through sheer excess\", albeit within a context that \"plods along mechanically through its first hour.\"[43] William Arnold of Seattle Post-Intelligencer gave a mildly positive review, saying that \"anyone in the market for an overblown and totally mindless adventure-comedy will certainly get his money's worth.\"[44] Dallas movie reviewer Casey C. Corpier said that the film was almost as enjoyable as the original and liked the fact that it delivered what it advertised. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said the film \"has some good things [but] does not have enough of them to make the third time the charm.\"[45] Ken Fox of TV Guide called the film \"passable popcorn fare.\"[46] Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail said the film is \"kind of fun, but the twists and turns are all too familiar.\"[47] Michael Sragow of the Baltimore Sun said the film is \"like an Indiana Jones movie without rhythm, wit or personality, just a desperate, headlong pace.\"[48]\n\nAccolades[]\n\nAward Subject Nominee Result Saturn Awards Best Horror Film Nominated CDG Awards Best Costume Design - Fantasy Sanja Milkovic Hays Nominated Golden Reel Awards Best Sound Editing - Dialogue and ADR Becky Sullivan, Daniel S.
