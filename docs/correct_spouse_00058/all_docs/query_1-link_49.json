        "text": "HONG KONG tycoon Richard Li Tzar-kai wants to move on with his life following his breakup with actress Isabella Leong Lok-si.\n\nAnd he wants the curious to get on with their lives as well.\n\nâIsabella announced our split several days ago,â the PCCW chairman said. âItâs sad. But we will take good care of our three sons, ensuring they have the best upbringing.â\n\nTheir children are Ethan, born in Canada in April 2009, and twins born in San Francisco in June last year.\n\nThere has been talk that when Li, 44, and Leong, 22, were a couple they signed a contract specifying that if they broke up, the singer-actress would collect HK$3 billion. That was to cover her living expenses as well as those of the children.\n\nBut Li denied that.\n\nHe said the breakup settlement talk was purely speculation, and he hoped their relationship, though it turned sour, would not be associated with money.\n\nLi also denied other women â Malaysian-American model-actress Mandy Lieu in particular â came between him and Leong.\n\nâAll names mentioned by the press are people I have never met,â he said.\n\nThe reports, he insisted, âare not true.â(SD-Agencies)"
