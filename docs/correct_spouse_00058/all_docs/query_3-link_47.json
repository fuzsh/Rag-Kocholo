        "text": "In Monopoly Go, collecting stickers to complete albums is exciting and helpful. Although players can get a certain number of free dice, cash, tokens, etc. in the game to complete sets and albums, it is still very challenging.\n\nAlthough players can get a certain number of new stickers during events, it is still difficult to collect all the stickers to unlock albums. If you want more Monopoly Go Stickers, collecting them in the game alone is far from enough, and the number of dice in the inventory is also limited. If you want to get some hard-to-get stickers, trading is a better option.\n\nFortunately, Monopoly Go provides a feature called Safe Trade, which allows players to exchange stickers to complete their respective albums.\n\nHow to trade safely in Monopoly Go:\n\nPlayers can view stickers that are ready to be traded. Trades will only be made if both parties agree to the terms.\n\nLaunch the game and click the Album tab.\n\nSelect the album and find the stickers you want to trade. (Note that you can only trade extra stickers.)\n\nClick “Send to a Friend” and turn on the “Make a Trade!” toggle.\n\nSelect the friend you want to trade with.\n\nClick “Swap” to make the trade.\n\nAfter making the offer, click “OK”.\n\nThe other player will have 24 hours to respond to the trade.\n\nNote: You can trade up to 5 stickers per day.\n\nIf you don’t have enough friends to trade with on Monopoly Go and want to collect stickers, then buying Monopoly Go Stickers is a great option. And I happen to know that IGGM is a well-known game currency selling platform, where the Monopoly Go Stickers sold here are safe, legal and cheap enough, and are our best choice to buy stickers.\n\nI also know a good discount code “WATER”, which can get an additional 5% discount.\n\nI have 2 dotters that graduated from VJC in 2022 and 2023.\n\nWhy VJC?\n\nBoth my dotters from Cedar secondary. There is a through train IP program from Cedar to VJC.\n\nBoth did well in their A levels.\n\nSeeing how my dotters fared, I reckon\n\nVJC Science and Math standards are not low. In terms of preparing for overseas uni, both JCs are the same - geared towards A levels. VJC has structures to guide students to apply for Overseas uni.\n\nCultures and different:\n\nTJC has always lagged VJC in admission cut off points as far as I can remember. VJC has a rich tradition of producing abled people, dating back to my time 30 years ago. Culture wise, this is Singapore. Our social fabric is the same almost everywhere. There is not much difference between the schools, especially when it is only a 2 years period that your kid is going to spend there. It is not as though one school is going to encourage you neglect studies while the other encourages you to slog.\n\nNotes:\n\nAlmost half of every cohort in VJC are IP students. Something like 40-60 ratio. Why is this important? It means these students have already found friends and formed cliques, when entering the JC. It will be very hard for outsiders to break into these cliques to make friends. Friends are important for solace, companionship, comfort and inspiration especially when the child will be tested to extremes at the A levels. In JCs without affiliations, every student is on an equal footing when they admit - all have to make new friends.\n\nAlmost 90 students in each cohort in VJC got RP90. Perfect score. It is shy of RI and Hwa Chong’s results, but it still a sizeable number. Meaning the pace of study is quite fast.\n\nMy opinion:\n\nIf your child has DSA-ed into either, I think it will not be wise to put him into a class that is far superior to his academic ability. It is like putting an E student into a class full of A students. Your child will find the environment unsuitable, feel demoralized always and abhor school. Let him enjoy his JC days and his sport. There are many other pathways to success.\n\n@Infoseeker said in Review TJC Vs VJC:\n\nHi All - seek your kind advice.\n\nMy son is getting a DSA offer from Temasek JC. However we are confident that based on his O-Level results he would be able to get Victoria JC. What is the general perception for the 2 JC - TJC and VJC?\n\nWhich has better Science/Maths department? Which has better support structure/guidance for preparing for Overseas University Applications Whats the difference in cultures between the two Any other key difference between the two JCs\n\nAny guidance will be much appreciated\n\nalt text\n\nInternational Art Competition 2024\n\nFree Trial Duration: 1st lesson only from Thurs 8th August to Sun 11th August 2024.\n\nFree Trial Registration: https://www.artistori.com/event-details/fine-art-and-public-speaking-free-trial\n\nProject Duration: 6 sessions at 2 hours per session.\n\nProject Period: Thursday 8th August to Sunday 15th September 2024.\n\nThe time of the year has come for our junior artist to produce an art piece for submissions to international art competitions.

From designing fictional worlds to developing unique gameplay mechanics, creativity plays an integral role in every aspect of the game.\n\nContribution of Creativity in Games\n\nCreativity in the game is demonstrated through the development of complex storylines, multi-dimensional characters and expansive worlds. The games at slope game have opened up a vast world that players can explore anywhere without limitation. This encourages player creativity in approaching and solving challenges.\n\nContributions from the Gamer Community\n\nCreativity not only appears in the game development process but is also contributed by the gaming community through mods and custom content. Modders often create mods to change gameplay, add new elements and create unique experiences that are not available in the original version of the game.\n\nIn short, creativity plays an important and indispensable role in the gaming industry. From developing complex worlds to unique gameplay mechanics and contributions from the gaming community, creativity is at the core of what helps games attract and retain players around the world.\n\nHi All,\n\nRecently I have been thinking quite abit about my ds1 pri one admission for next year. Although i haven't really set my mind on anything yet but i'm thinking along the line like maybe will stop my current job when the time is nearer and stay home to help him with the transition, roughly plan to stop working for about 1 year or so. During that 1 year i will continue to put my younger son who is 19 months old in his cc now. Probably will go look for some 4-5 hrs part time in the morning to occupy myself and set to pick my ds1 after he end his school and spend the rest of the afternoon just with him to go through his work or bond with him? I believe many of you here will wonder why 1 year only? hmm..cos of a few reasons...\n\n- he has very short attention span i foresee he may need extra coaching at home until he settle down in his new school life?\n\n- We have went around scouting for student care unfortunately there are very few in Sengkang and already has long waiting list.\n\n-Although fil offers to look after but we are not keen cos we rather not want any conflict.\n\n- Also, I'm a little tired of working wanted to take a break for a short while and take this chance to look into another industry which my part time might give me some insights? so i thought why not?\n\ni'm considering if i'm doing the right thing? After all stopping work means we will only have single income to survive on..all the budgets have to tighten and use carefully.\n\nHaiz..still thinking... 😓"
