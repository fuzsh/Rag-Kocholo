        "text": "Richard Tzar-Kai Li Edit Profile\n\n李澤楷\n\nBusinessman philanthropist\n\nRichard Tzar-Kai Li is a Hong Kong businessman and philanthropist. Richard Li Tzar Kai is currently the chairman and chief executive of PCG, chairman of PCCW, HKT Trust and HKT Limited, and chairman of PCCW's and HKT's executive committee. He is also chairman of Pacific Century Premium Developments Limited (PCPD), chairman of PCPD's executive committee and chairman of Singapore-based Pacific Century Regional Developments Limited.\n\nBackground\n\nRichard Tzar-Kai Li was born on November 8, 1966 in Hong Kong.\n\nEducation\n\nRichard Tzar-Kai Li attended St. Paul's Co-educational College in Hong Kong and left at age thirteen to be educated at Menlo School in Atherton, California.\n\nTo earn money, he took shifts at McDonald's and also worked as a caddy at the local golf course. Richard Tzar-Kai Li attended Menlo College, studying computer engineering, but did not receive a degree.\n\nCareer\n\nRichard Li Tzar Kai founded Pacific Century Group (PCG) in 1993, an Asia-based long-term private investment group with interests across three core business pillars - financial services, technology, media & telecommunications (TMT), and property. In 1996, Pacific Century CyberWorks (PCCW) is founded, and was later renamed to PCCW Limited. Four years later, PCCW acquired Cable & Wireless HKT, formerly known as The Hong Kong Telephone Company Ltd., and formed the company with businesses in telecommunications, media, IT solutions, property development and investment, and other businesses.\n\nIn September 2009, Richard Li Tzar Kai bought the asset management operations of AIG, AIG Investments, for around $500 million. Renamed PineBridge Investments, the business currently has approximately $85.5 billion of assets under management as of 30 June 2017.\n\nIn June 2011, Hong Kong's stock exchange approved the carve-out of the telecommunications and mobile assets of PCCW, which also has broadband television, IT solutions and property businesses. In September 2011 the final hurdles were cleared by Hong Kong's stock exchange for PCCW to list its telecommunications assets as HKT Trust, the city's first publicly traded share stapled units.[13] On 12 October 2011 PCCW shareholders approved the plan. Li's involvement in the 2011 initial public offering of HKT Trust saw the company raise around $1.2 billion. In December 2013, HKT agreed to acquire CSL New World Mobility, a subsidiary of Australian network operator Telstra, for HK$18.8 billion. CSL currently runs the premium 1010 and mainstream CSL brands in Hong Kong. The transaction was completed in May 2014.\n\nIn March 2015, PCCW Media acquired mobile video provider VuClip and launched Viu. As of August 2017, Viu’s over-the-top (OTT) video service rolled out to 24 markets globally including Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, India and Thailand.\n\nPCCW OTT provides video streaming services under the \"Viu\" and \"Vuclip\" brands as well as a music streaming service under the \"MOOV\" brand. In August 2017, it secures new investors including Hony Capital, Foxconn Ventures and Temasek.\n\nAchievements\n\nMembership\n\nRichard Li Tzar Kai is a member of the Global Information Infrastructure Commission and a member of the Center for Strategic and International Studies' International Councillors Group in Washington DC.\n\nPersonality\n\nLi acquired Canadian citizenship in the 1980s. His Canadian citizenship has proven valuable to him in his financial dealings, allowing him to make bids for PCCW to purchase stakes in companies such as Air Canada and Bell Canada Enterprises without running afoul of restrictions on foreign ownership.\n\nDuring the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, PCCW under Li's direction aided victims by providing telecommunication services to patients, medical staff, and fundraisers. Richard Li and PCCW also donated $1 million to the Business Community Relief Fund for Victims of SARS.\n\nIn 2006, Richard Li Tzar Kai donated CA$1 million to the Canadian National Arts Centre Foundation, which led to the establishment of the Annual Richard Li Young Artist Chair, putting young musicians each year under the mentorship of musical maestros.\n\nLater, in 2007, under Li's direction PCCW volunteers participated in the District Elderly Campaign sponsored by the Oriental Daily News Charitable Fund, the Sun Charitable Fund, and Po Leung Kuk. The campaign' mission was to deliver gift packages to the elderly living in the Lower Ngau Tau Kok Estate.\n\nConnections\n\nIn April 2009, Isabella Leong, Li's girlfriend and a former Hong Kong singer, gave birth to his son, Ethan Li. In June 2010, Leong gave birth to Li's twin sons in San Francisco. In March 2011, Isabella announced to the media that the couple have ended their relationship. They have both announced that the split is amicable and that they will both take care of the children.\n\nFather:\n\nLi Ka-shing\n\nMother:\n\nChong Yuet Ming\n\nBrother:\n\nVictor Li Tzar-kuoi\n\ngirlfriend:\n\nIsabella Leong"
