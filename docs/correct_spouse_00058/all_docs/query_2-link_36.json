Tatsumi Scholarship for excellence in the study of Japanese\n\nHenry Saburō Tatsumi was born in San Francisco in 1896 and received his early education in Japan. During World War I he served in the U.S. Army. In 1932 he received a bachelor's degree in Oriental Studies from the University of Washington and a master's degree in 1935. In the same year he joined the faculty of the University and taught Japanese for more than thirty years until his retirement with the rank of associate professor, emeritus, in 1967. During World War II Professor Tatsumi taught Japanese at the U.S. Navy Language School located at the University of California, Berkeley, and, later, the University of Colorado, Boulder. Many of the founding figures of Japanese studies in the United States, such as Donald Keene, Edward Seidensticker, and William Theodore De Bary, were trained in Japanese by Professor Tatsumi and his colleagues.\n\nThe Henry S. Tatsumi Scholarship Fund was established with an initial gift by Professor Nobutaka Ike (1916-2006) and his wife, Tai (1918-2007). Nobutaka Ike, a Seattle native and graduate of the UW class of 1940, and Mrs. Ike were graduate students and UW employees when the U.S. declared war against Japan in 1941. They were dismissed from their positions and first sent to internment camps, then to the Navy Language School in Boulder. After the war Nobutaka Ike embarked on a scholarly career and eventually became a professor of political science at Stanford University.\n\nIn 1984 Professor and Mrs. Ike established the Tatsumi Scholarship fund in memory of their mentor, using reparation funds given to them by the state of Washington. Thanks to their generous gift and additional contributions by others who wished to honor Professor Tatsumi's legacy, each year this prize is awarded to one or more students at UW who demonstrate excellence in the study of Japanese and Japanese studies.\n\nIn this video, originally produced for the series \"California of the Past,\" Professor Tatsumi's daughter Miyo Tatsumi Harvey tells the story of his life and career.\n\nTatsumi Scholarship Recipients\n\n2023 Daniel Hance, Grayson Modica, Rory Eric James Weseloh\n\n2022 Caralee Casto, James Gray, Rebecca Victoria LeVeque\n\n2021 Michiko Hunter, Raechel Kundert, Nicholas Malik, Joanne Misenar, Emi Nakashima\n\n2020 Sammi Chan\n\n2019 Rhiannon Bowen, Mitchell Estberg\n\n2018 Peiyu Wu, Kaleo Chan, Valerie Owens\n\n2017 Zeke Stanislaus Hill, Suyoung Kim, Ching Yi (Hayley) Tung\n\n2016 Fairuz Aisyah Binti Ahmed Zamri, Christopher Kessler, Wilhelmina McMichael\n\n2015 Michelle Arima, Eunha Chong, Silver Yui\n\n2014 Zachary Lim\n\n2013 Hana Kim, Jessica Mao\n\n2012 Emily Keiko Ikeda, Megan Colette Korling, Abigail Julia Severson\n\n2011 Rebecca Dexter; Sarah Mortland\n\n2010 Clara Nadja Lawryniuk; Sin Yi (Cindy) Tsang\n\n2009 Chan Yang (Glory) Choe; Jessica Louise Leithem\n\n2008 Kei Hiyaki; Raeanna Kaylin Pierce Mason\n\n2007 Lindsey Dewitt; Brian Garcia\n\n2006 Kathryn E.
