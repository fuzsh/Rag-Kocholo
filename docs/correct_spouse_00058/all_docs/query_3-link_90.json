        "text": "(Chinese online news sources: here and here) Okay when I read this in the papers in this morning I was thinking, “no wonder mak calls EEG a triad.” Haha! But then again I wonder what the contract Johnny Juniors are made to sign as kids are like… hmmm.\n\nIn any case EEG has officially filed a lawsuit against rising star (or maybe already risen) Isabella Leong Lok Si, whom frankly I have never heard of until today but perhaps I’m just ulu. 19-year old Isabella Leong signed a 20-year long contract with EEG when she was only 12 (Straits Times Life! said 10-year contract, but I expect its a blooper).\n\nHer amorous relationship with 42-year old Richard Li however (HK tycoon Li Ka Shing’s son) must certainly have blossomed in recent months to such an extent that he has allegedly agreed to bail her out of this contract and send her to the States to study in some prestigious university — which by the way, will be handpicked by Michelle Yeoh, the matchmaker who had introduced the two. Isabella Leong was seen dining with Michelle Yeoh and her fiance Jean Todt and had apparently arrived in the States in Richard Li’s private jet.\n\nEEG’s suit contained 3 main points – 1) Isabella is not allowed to sign any other contract with any other company (but she supposedly has plans to join forces + synergies with Michelle Yeoh in her film company or something) 2) Isabella MUST fulfill all conditions in her contract 3) her departure will cause the company to incur losses hence she MUST make reparations. It is speculated that EEG must not let Isabella Leong off lightly as it may set a dangerous precedent for other artistes under their label.\n\nIsabella Leong is also reported to be studying English in New York currently and will have to return to Hong Kong in the near future to attend court-hearings for the case. In order to gain her freedom, she will have to face the unwelcome prospect of having to reveal (possibly dirty ) details of the working relationship between her and EEG for the past 8 years.\n\nOh well, lives of rich and famous, splashed on the net for all to oogle and vivisect. Let the hammer drop and the hearing start! ^_^"
