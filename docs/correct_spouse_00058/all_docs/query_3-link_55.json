        "text": "The latest photo spread featuring singer-actress Isabella Leong in a flattering curve was released online Tuesday, April 12.\n\nAccording to Taiwan's NOWnews, the photo shoot may be an attempt by the 22-year-old actress to return to the entertainment circle.\n\nThis February, Leong ended her relationship with wealthy Hong Kong bachelor Richard Li, son of billionaire Li Ka Shing. She gave birth to their eldest son Ethan Li in 2009 and a pair of twin boys in 2010.\n\nRumors never ended following their official split-up announcement earlier this year. Media reports say Leong will fly to Hong Kong this month to throw a birthday party for her eldest son and probably meet with Li to ask for an alimony payment.\n\nIt also has been reported that Leong will be the female lead in director Tsui Hark's new film project \"Detective Dee: The Prequel.\""
