        "text": "Isabella Leong, the 22-year-old âpartnerâ of 43-year-old Hong Kong billionaire Richard Li, gave birth to twins at the end of June, a little more than one year after delivering baby boy Ethan.\n\nVarious Hong Kong media reports are saying that Li, son of the ârichest man in Asiaâ Li Ka-shing, put aside work and flew to San Francisco in time for the latest delivery.\n\nA Sina article said Leong kept herself busy during her pregnancy by learning how to cook French cuisine for her extended family.Â\n\nMichelle Lo, Leongâs spokesperson, confirmed the news but said she had not received instructions to provide photos of the twins or mother.\n\nLeong has been in the entertainment industry since she was 12 years old and was reportedly introduced to Li by actress Michelle Yeoh.\n\nMeanwhile, in Taiwan, sisters Barbie Hsu and Dee Hsu have been having a war of words on weibo (microblog).\n\nA couple of months ago TV host Dee uploaded an unflattering photo of her older sister on her Sina Weibo site, which showed actress Barbie cross-eyed and apparently the worse for wear after drinking too much.\n\nBarbie got her own back this week by posting a shot of her younger sister eating a hamburger with her hands and looking around as if she was feeling guilty about it.\n\nâIâve been waiting for this moment,â Barbie chirped. âI love my sister, I love her character, her talent, her wit and her passion for food. Iâm a devil donât you know?â\n\nThese âugly photosâ have become quite a hit among fans and get a lot of comments, which just goes to prove the old adage: Thereâs no such thing as bad publicity.Â\n\nModel Pace Wu said the âugly photoâ of Dee was the âmost exciting I have ever seenâ, while actor Huang Xiaoming twitted: âI love you too. Your family is so lovely.â\n\nHuang has been putting himself about a bit since his relationship with Hong Kong model AngelaBaby became staple fodder for the tabloids (and us).\n\nHe has even become involved in a war of words between Chinaâs top young literary giants, Han Han and Guo Jingming, according to Southern Metropolitan Entertainment Weekly.\n\nThe two good-looking writers are like chalk and cheese. While Han excels in pithy social commentary, Guo specializes in fantasy and love stories. Han has been less than complimentary about Guo, and the lack of admiration appears to be mutual.\n\nHuang, handsome but daft as a brush, bought Guoâs story Fantasy City to make it into a movie and then asked Han whether he would like to play a role in it.\n\nGuo said in an interview that it was up to Huang who he cast and added, âI really donât careâ if Han appears in the movie.Â\n\nHan, obviously, refused. Duh!\n\nChina Daily"
