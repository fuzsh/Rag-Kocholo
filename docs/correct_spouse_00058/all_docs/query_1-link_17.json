        "text": "24 Jul â€“ Isabella Leong recently admitted that it was her three sons who encouraged her to return to showbiz again.\n\nAs reported on Mingpao, the actress, who appeared at a skincare event with new manager, Kim Chou, shared that the topic of her work came out when her eldest son invited his friends to come to the house to watch a movie.\n\n\"They happened to be watching \"The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor\" and recognised me. My son felt very proud and encouraged me to make another movie. If mummy is happy, they will all be happy!,\" she enthused.\n\nIsabella also shared that her sons wanted her to do superhero films like \"Superman\", while she would prefer to do similar style projects that empowers women.\n\n\"I plan to do some movies and variety shows. I have already received several film offers, which will be announced later,\" she said.\n\nHowever, the actress stressed that she will not do reality shows with her sons, as she would never expose her sons to the public.\n\nOn the other hand, when asked about her relationship status, Isabella said that she is not anxious to find a new partner after her relationship with baby daddy and billionaire Richard Li ended in 2011."
