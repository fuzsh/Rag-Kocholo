We had a wonderful time together. Our children will be raised by us together.\"\n\nThe statement did not mention a monetary settlement.\n\nIn July, the former Hong Kong actress gave birth to twin boys in San Francisco. Li's eldest son Ethan, also with Leong, was born in 2009 in Canada.\n\nRichard Li is the youngest son of Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's richest person.\n\nAccording to Forbes Rich List 2010, Li Ka-shing is the 14th richest person worldwide with assets of US$21 billion. His son was estimated to have assets of US$1.4 billion."
