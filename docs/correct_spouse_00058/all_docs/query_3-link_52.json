        "text": "Richard Li (李澤楷), son of Hong Kong billionaire, Li Ka-shing (李嘉誠), and Miss Hong Kong 2015 Second Runner Up, Karmen Kwok (郭嘉文), have been dating since 2016. Richard Li and Karmen Kwok’s relationship was exposed when they were spotted traveling in Japan during Valentine’s Day in 2016. It was reported in 2017, Karmen Kwok had bought a luxury property priced around 50,000 HKD per square foot. It was speculated the agent handling the transaction is Richard Li’s associate. Based on Karmen Kwok’s family background and TVB’s low salary, it has been widely speculated for years that this was gifted to her by Richard Li. After their relationship was revealed, Karmen Kwok had terminated her contract with TVB in 2017.\n\nIn 2019, Richard Li and Karmen Kwok were both in attendance at an event for the Hong Kong Jockey Club at the Shatin Racecourse. While Richard Li attended the event as one of the sponsors, this was the first time he and Karmen Kwok attended a public function together as a couple. Since then, the couple would frequently attend functions together.\n\nHowever, there have been rumors circulating that Richard Li and Karmen Kwok have recently split up after 5 years together. When the media reached out to Richard Li’s team, they responded that he’s busy with work and won’t respond to personal matters. There were rumors that former Malaysian TVB actress, Serene Lim, might have affected their relationship after she signed with Richard Li’s new entertainment management company, Noble Castle Asia.\n\nAs for Karmen Kwok, she has been leaving cryptic messages on her Instagram account. She also started uploading more pictures and promoting products on Instagram, suggesting that she’s working as a KOL (Key Opinion Leader). She has also updated her Instagram bio with a work contact.\n\nAside from Karmen Kwok, the 55 year old Richard Li’s other high profile relationship was with actress, Isabella Leong, with whom he has three sons.\n\nCredit: hk01 (1, 2), Karmen Kwok IG, Baidu"
