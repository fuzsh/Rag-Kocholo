        "text": "The Cherry Orchard is about the conflict between the past and the present, between aristocratic ideals and the values of the new middle class. Write a brief reflection on a similar conflict between the past and the present in contemporary society. What are some ways in which this conflict might be resolved?\n\nThe huge difference in value between the past generation’s concept of “family” and the present generation’s is very striking.\n\nIn the past, Westerners were religious and took monogamy very seriously. They truly believed that weddings are holy. Nowadays, weddings are treated as celebrations and couples can divorce any time they want. Divorce was not common for Chinese and Koreans in the past centuries, since family members need to take care of each other and survive with minimal means. They get through tough times together. Now, when couples have a small fight, they will get divorced.\n\nNowadays, people can have two or more families. Hong Kong Tycoon Stanely Ho for is the father of four families and Donald Trump is the father of three families. Richard Li Tzar Kai fathered three sons with actress Isabella Leong without marrying her and later broke up with her. It seems like in modern society, you can do whatever you want if you are rich. Rich men can indulge in women and father as many children as they like, without considering what impact their behavior have on their children’s growth.\n\nThis conflict is difficult to solve, because people are getting richer and more hedonistic. This is something even education cannot solve, because people usually become hedonistic after gaining wealth. They will stop caring about family, the basic unit of society. Instead, children are becoming a burden, and wives are there to annoy you.\n\nImagine that you will be directing a new production of The Importance of Being Earnest. Write a brief summary of where/when you would set the play and explain how this setting would help to further develop one of the key topics in the play.\n\nI will set the new production in China during the Qing dynasty, in the imperial palace. Lady Bracknell would be the queen of China, and Gwendolen would be the princess.\n\nThe theme of marriage can be developed and the tradition that one must marry another of similar family background is emphasized. Jack is now a respected chancellor after successfully passing the imperial exam. Everybody thinks he is a good match for Princess Gwendolen, but the queen will not allow the marriage because Jack was adopted by a commoner and his real family background is unknown. This shows that the queen firmly believes in the Chinese tradition that couples must be formed from similar family backgrounds. The way Lady Bracknell rejects Jack in Wilde’s original plot can fit in this context.\n\nSet in imperial palace, the new production is depicting the royal family, hence the upper class. Thus, the theme of class distinction can be shown, as the queen is seen discriminating against Jack’s common background.\n\nLeung Yu Yan Ruby\n\nWeek 8\n\nHow do the costumes, setting, and overall production of the film adaptation of The Importance of Being Earnest change, develop, or refine your understanding of the play?\n\nFirstly, since the play is set in Wilde’s time, Wilde did not mention how the characters dressed. The film shows us how people of the upper class dressed. Jack and Algernon are seen wearing bow ties for dinner, and this scene refined my understanding of daily lives of Victorian upper-class society, where dinner is seen as a highly respected occasion. Lady Bracknell’s elaborate fox fur coat, with an actual fox head on the coat, reaffirms her character as a calculating mother who tries to find the best match for her daughter. Her elaborate headwear and dresses show that she wants attention and respect from others.\n\nThe mise-en-scene of the film refined my understanding of the setting of the play. The film shows what a “manor house” in the countryside looks like, with an enormous and beautiful garden, where Cecily can have her lessons as well as have tea in. The interior setting of the living and dining rooms of Jack and Algernon’s houses also show us how the upper classes used to live at that time.\n\nThe film also added some elements that were not in the play. For instance, the piano scene was quite effective in deepening Cecily and Algernon’s relationship, as Cecily admires Algernon’s playfulness and ability to improvise and falls in love with him. The scene near the ends which suggests Lady Bracknell was a showgirl whom Lord Bracknell is forced to marry because of her pregnancy adds a comedic effect to the already hilarious play and explains why Lady Bracknell’s attention-seeking character and her huge regard for wealth and social class in her daughter and nephew’s potential spouses.\n\nLeung Yu Yan Ruby\n\nWeek 7\n\nMy Ex-Boyfriends and Why We Broke Up\n\na poem in iambic pentameter\n\nYou see, Eugene had thought I smoked a lot\n\nRaphael did not enjoy the toys I bought.\n\nPierre was like, “I’m sorry, you are too\n\nnaïve. I need a girl with more mature\n\nideas.” Okay, I thought. I understand.\n\nFidel McPosh, oh gosh, he hates my mum.\n\nFidel, my dear, I hate your mum as well.\n\nGustave Ramond Berlin was way too thin.\n\nI looked gigantic standing next to him.\n\nHe tried to lift me up, and fell and broke\n\nhis knees. Too thin, too thin, too thin, I shook\n\nmy head and sighed. I met Rishabh two weeks\n\nago. He’s handsome, tall and smart, but he\n\ndoes not adore my cats. Bye bye Rishabh.\n\nLeung Yu Yan Ruby (54391245)\n\nWeek 6\n\nSelect one of the four poems discussed in class today and write a Topic/Theme/Analysis critical reading. Remember to:\n\n1) Identify which topic you will examine,\n\n2) Articulate what you believe the poem is doing with or saying about that topic,\n\n3) Show how one or more of the elements of poetry are helping to support your analysis.\n\nPoem selected: So You Want To Be A Writer by Charles Bukowski\n\nThe topic that I would like to explore is writing as a profession. The speaker raises a very good question about whether being a “writer” can be an aspiration. He thinks that we cannot be a writer unless we have inspiration. He does not mean just an idea in our head, but one that that “burst” and “roars” out of the whole body, including the “heart”, “mind”, “mouth” and “gut”. That brilliant idea also has to make one uncomfortable NOT writing it, to the extent that one might commit murder or suicide if he cannot write on the idea. His use of hyperboles enforces his strong stance on this issue, that people cannot become writers just because they want to be one.\n\nHe also advices writers not to be “dull and pretentious and boring” or “consumed with self-love” because “the libraries of the world have yawned themselves to sleep”. This personification is very effective in articulating that he thinks many writers are producing dull and pretentious stories that are uninteresting to many people. We can infer that he is thinks a good writer should not only have an idea that is creative, but writes honestly too.\n\nLeung Yu Yan Ruby (54391245)\n\nWeek 5\n\nHow do the description of the Sun Temple at Konarak and its sculptures further develop or refine one of the main topics explored in ‘Interpreter of Maladies’?\n\nOne of the main topics in this story is failing marriage and familial relationships. This is hinted at the very first paragraph, where the ridiculous scenario of Mr and Mrs Das having to “bicker” about who should take their daughter to the toilet is depicted. It is also noted that Mrs Das does not hold her daughter’s hand, and we can infer that she is not a loving mother, which is confirmed in the story later on that the whole family is not very close, with the parents minding their own business and do not communicate much with their children or with each other.\n\nRonny comments that the temple looks like a desert, and the temple thus symbolizes the lack of enrichment and joy in the Das family, just like how a desert lacks water and fauna and flora. The dried Chandrabhaga River symbolizes Mr and Mrs Das’ marriage. Their passion for each other is lost, as seen in Mrs Das’s affair and the couple’s lack of communication throughout the whole story.\n\nThe description of the sculptures of “entwined naked bodies” is quite significant to the story, since they remind Mr Kapasi about not ever seeing his wife fully naked, and refined the details of Mr Kapasi’s unsuccessful marriage. They also foreshadow the affair that Mrs Das will later go on to tell Mr Kapasi about.\n\nIt is also quite ironic that Mr Kapasi would want the Astachala-Surya to witness him embracing Mrs Das because he is imagining a holy statue witnessing an extramarital affair. When he realizes that Mrs Das actually has an extramarital affair, all his wonderful fantasies “evaporated”. An imagined affair, beautiful, romantic, worthy of the witness of a god, is contrasted with the ugliness of a real one, when a real baby is conceived and secrets have to be kept forever.\n\nLeung Yu Yan Ruby (54391245)\n\nWeek 4\n\nThe topic I would like to explore is the idea of poverty. Although not a main theme in the story, the notion that poverty leads to less choices in life is prevalent in the story and makes the story a tragic one.\n\nEnnis is under huge pressure to take care of his family. Alma “dreaded another pregnancy”, because Ennis and Alma cannot afford to raise another child. The fact that Ennis goes “fishing” with Jack once or twice a year “but never a vacation with her and the girls” makes Alma uncomfortable. The lack of money is putting a huge strain on Alma, who “saw she would always have to work to keep ahead of the bills on what Ennis made”. She cannot do something fun herself since she spends all her money on raising her family. Her life is dull – Ennis will not take the family out for vacation and he has a “disinclination to step out and have any fun” because he believes that his life is unfulfilled without Jack. Eventually, Alma has to divorce him to get a better quality of life.\n\nEnnis’ poverty is also putting a strain on his relationship with Jack : “You ever hear a child support?” Their conversation turns bitter as Ennis explained why he cannot see Jack in August.\n\nOn the other hand, Jack has an unhappy marriage also because of a lack of wealth. His father- in -law “hates his guts”, since he depends on Lureen, and he has no say in his son’s education, since “Lureen had the money and called the shots”.\n\nEnnis and Jack’s life, as well as Alma’s, is made worse by their grim impoverishment, and this makes the already tragic story even more poignant. The boys’ lives cannot be worse – Jack having a father-in-law who despises him, and a son whom he doesn’t and cannot care for, and eventually being brutally killed; and Ennis, who has a broken family and lives in the fear of being discovered as a homosexual and now drinks leftover coffee in the morning and “urinates in a sink” while the love of his life is dead.\n\nLeung Yu Yan Ruby (54391245)\n\nWeek 3\n\nAnalyse why you believe a particular character who does not appear in the novella has been added to the stage adaptation.\n\nThe addition of Lucy, the prostitute, is quite effective. In the novella, it is said that “tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on the panel” next to Hyde’s door. This suggests that perhaps tramps are frequent visitors of Hyde’s home and the musical explores this idea further.\n\nThe musical explores more in depth of Hyde’s evilness – his lust and violence, which is apparent in the way he treats and kills Lucy. In the novella, it was suggested that Hyde is a rapist, and that the incident of him trampling over a young girl may be a “veiled account of a brutal rape”. (Gilbert 2014) The musical portrays Hyde as having very great sexual appetite, as he goes to see Lucy several times and hurts her. Finally, he kills Lucy as he does not want to share her with Dr Jekyll. The scene also lets the audience realizes that Jekyll is now completely separated from Hyde, because if Jekyll is still there inside Hyde, Hyde would have realized that he might hurt Lucy and will ask her to go.\n\nLucy’s role helps the musical portray the distinct gap between the upper and lower class in London. She represents the lower class, feels quite lost, and laments “no one knows who I am”. No one “gives a damn” about the people of the lower class. Her world represents the dark side of London as well as the dark world of sexual desires where Hyde ravishes in, which contrasts with the noble engagement between Jekyll and Emma Carew.\n\nArtistically, having female voices is essential for the musical, as it would be very dull if there are only male leads in a musical production. Lucy’s repertoire, such as her duet with Emma, “In His Eyes”, expresses her love for Jekyll and in “Dangerous Game”, she expresses her fear and disgust for Hyde. Her love and hatred for Jekyll and Hyde respectively serve an interesting contrast and irony – because Jekyll and Hyde are essentially the same person. Due to the presence of Lucy, Jekyll and Hyde’s difference is exemplified by how Jekyll and Hyde treats Lucy. It also raises the question of whether Jekyll and Hyde should be considered as a different or the same person.\n\nReference: Gilbert, F, 2014,Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde: The Study Guide Edition: Complete text & integrated study guide: Volume 2 (Creative Study Guide Editions), FGI Publishing, London\n\n— Leung Yu Yan Ruby (54391245)\n\nWeek 2\n\nDr Lanyon has died mysteriously from shock, and has left behind a letter. Why do you think Stevenson has chosen to reveal crucial information in the form of a letter, that is, what effect does this letter have on the plot development of the novella?\n\nWith the letter, the story switches to Dr. Lanyon’s point of view. Dr Lanyon, in his letter, becomes the narrator of the novella, as he vividly describes his experience seeing Hyde turn into Dr Jekyll.\n\nStevenson can then explain the mystery in one go through Dr. Lanyon’s writing. If Dr Lanyon had told Utterson the truth by conversation, Stevenson would have to describe Utterson’s reactions and this would affect the flow of the explanation. In the end, after reading both letters, Stevenson did not record Utterson’s reactions in any ways, so I think Stevenson’s intention was to switch points of view – first from the omnipresent narrator, to Dr Lanyon and finally to Dr Jekyll.\n\nFurthermore, to reveal crucial information in the form of a letter, Stevenson creates suspense. Readers expect the truth to be out soon, as Utterson opens the letter. However, to our dismay, it contains another letter which is not to be opened until Dr Jekyll’s death or disappearance. This adds a great amount suspense to the story, as we are so close to the truth, but Utterson, being a faithful friend, decided not to open the letter. From this incident, we can also see Utterson’s character. He is trained as a lawyer and is faithful to his friend and client’s wish and instructions, and successfully resists the temptation of opening the letter. I think it is amazing that he can do it , since this mystery made Utterson sleepless and very worried.\n\n— Leung Yu Yan Ruby (54391245)\n\nWeek 1\n\nDo you agree with the argument of the second speaker in “Terence, This is Stupid Stuff?” What is your view of literature?\n\nI agree with Terence that we should all “train for ill and not for good”. We should all prepare for rainy days, for example, for the death of a family member or separation with a spouse. We cannot expect life to go on according to our own will. Accidents can happen and husbands can cheat on wives and vice versa, so I hold the same attitude towards life as Terence, that is to anticipate the inevitable sorrows in life.\n\nHowever, I do not agree that poetry or literature should be solely created for the purpose of helping people “train for ill”. First of all, writers will not be able to come up with good ideas if they force themselves only to write create sad stories. Second, readers not only read to learn about life, but they read for pleasure as well. Books can bring readers on an adventure and help them relax at the end of the day or during the weekends, so they will enjoy lighthearted and humorous stories such as romantic comedies. If only dark and gloomy tales exist in the world of literature, people will start to hold a pessimistic view on life and lose hope and society will turn into those dark dystopian worlds that we read about in science fiction.\n\nTherefore, I believe literature should be made up of different genres, as literature reflects life, and life is not only about misery but is full of hope and happiness.\n\n— Leung Yu Yan Ruby (54391245)"
