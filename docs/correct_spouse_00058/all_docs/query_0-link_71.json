        "text": "This week we are not going to talk about shotgun marriages, and readers should in no way jump to conclusions about the \"flash\" engagement and now the \"lightning\" marriage of Taiwan actress Barbie Hsu to her beau, the heir to a restaurant fortune, Wang Xiaofei.\n\nRather, dear reader, we should focus on the very real possibility of love at first sight, the existence of Cupid leading his merry dance and the pair experiencing the full force of eros, the wisdom at the heart of love described by Plato. Or more appropriately perhaps, the filial piety prescribed by Confucius and how the pair will do what they're told by Xiaofei's matriarch, Zhan Lan, and get married quick.\n\nJust 49 days after their first date the couple registered their marriage in Beijing, on Tuesday. It took them only 10 minutes to receive their wedding license from the Civil Affairs Bureau in Chaoyang district, a decision that will last a lifetime. They plan to hold three wedding banquets, one in Hainan in March, then in Taipei and Beijing.\n\n\"They planned to register for a long time,\" commented a friend of Wang, putting aside the question of how that is possible. \"But the procedure was rather complicated due to Hsu's Taiwan household registration It turns out they cannot wait any longer.\"\n\nIn other Xiaofei-Barbie developments, the young man's ex, Kitty Zhang, spoke up at the beginning of this week to say she wasn't given 6 million yuan ($903,408) as a breakup fee. She also wished the couple future happiness.\n\nFurther proof that true love does exist are the birthday frolics of top-rated Chinese actor Huang Xiaoming, who met up with Hong Kong model Angelababy for a sexy sailor uniform party in Shenzhen. Recent gossip claiming the two were estranged was clearly wide of the mark.\n\nThe now 33-year-old actor was treated to a meal in a French restaurant where some hot model friends of Angelababy, all dressed in costumes, joined in the celebrations. Sailor-babe Angelababy, according to Southern Metropolis Daily, showered her lover with kisses, fed him sausages and stroked his manly chin. When the party finished about 11.30 pm the revelers caroused at a KTV bar until 3 am, after which the couple retired to their swanky hotel for some private pleasure.\n\nMore good news. According to Tomato Network, \"Hong Kong Cinderella\" Isabella Leong is hoping to have a girl in the coming Year of the Rabbit. The 22-year-old singer-actor has already given birth to three boys, including twins. Did Leong offer her hand in marriage to billionaire Richard Li after giving him three sons? Possibly, according to MSN.com, which is reporting the merry couple may have secretly got married and are returning to Hong Kong for Christmas among the bosom of their extended family.\n\nYou see, sometimes, it's not necessary to tell the whole world you love each other. Love just IS. It's a beautiful world out there, just rainbows on our celebrity horizon."
