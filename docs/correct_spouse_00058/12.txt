30 Jan - Isabella Leong has recently debunked yet again the rumours that she was paid heftily by former partner Richard Li in their breakup.

The actress, who sat down for an interview on the show, "A Date with Luyu", said that she has no regrets about her time with Richard, but that there is no such thing as "HKD 500 million breakup fee" as the media continuously reported.

"I have said it before in interviews and I will not say it again [after this]. That is not true," she stressed.

She also stated that her three sons have urged her to find somebody new, but that she would rather leave it all to fate.

"I want to concentrate on my work and not let myself be distracted for the time being. I stay home when I am not working, so there is no chance of dating," she said.

Isabella met Richard, the son of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka Shing when she was 20 and he was 41. She gave birth to their first child Ethan when she was 21, and welcomed the businessman's twin sons the next year.

The two, however, ended their relationship in 2011.
