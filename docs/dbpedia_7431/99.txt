Trivia

His most notable animated cameo appearance occurred in the Freakazoid! episode "The Freakazoid," where the titular hero argues with Wakko Warner and the Brain about who Steven favors the most. When they approach him at the Amblin headquarters, their argument proves to be in vain as he cannot recognize who any of them are.
