        "text": "Steven Spielberg Biography\n\nWho is Steven Spielberg?\n\nLet’s briefly touch on Steven Spielberg the person.\n\nSteven Spielberg was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. His mother owned restaurants and played concert piano while his father worked as an electrical engineer in the early years of computers.\n\nYoung Steven Spielberg\n\nSpielberg grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. He was a Boy Scout and earned his photography merit badge by making a short film. The family later moved to Saratoga, California where Spielberg graduated high school.\n\nSteven Spielberg College & Education\n\nHe moved to L.A. with his father and applied to USC film school. He was rejected “due to his poor grades.” He was accepted to Cal State Long Beach and then earned an unpaid internship at Universal Studios in the editing department. He then made a 34-minute short film, Amblin’.\n\nThe film was good enough to earn him a seven-year directing contract from Universal vice president, Sidney Sheinberg. This inspired Spielberg to drop out of college — though he would return and graduate in 2002.\n\nHBO Documentary • Spielberg\n\nSteven Spielberg Facts\n\nCollectively, his films have grossed more than any other director in history, and his net worth is $3.7 billion. His production company, Amblin Partners, oversees productions through shingles including DreamWorks Pictures, Participant Media and Amblin Entertainment.\n\nSo, let’s jump into his filmmaking style and cinematography techniques.\n\nSTEVEN SPIELBERG PRODUCTION DESIGN\n\nSet the scene with production design\n\nOne thing I’ve noticed about many scenes in the best Steven Spielberg films is that they very often begin with production design elements. In other words, the scene will start with a particular prop or piece of set dressing that helps contextualize the scene immediately.\n\nIt’s also a nice visual reset for the viewer, so that way we all know we’re beginning a new scene. Sometimes this opening shot can add context to the overall story, especially when combined with the previous scene.\n\nFor example, in this scene from Jurassic Park, the film transitions to a completely different setting but helps us focus on the essence of the scene first. This tells us very quickly where we are, who we’re about to meet, and what this scene is ultimately about.\n\nThat way, the audience is bombarded with new setting, new characters, and dialogue that might confuse or disorient them.\n\nDig Site • Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park\n\nIt’s nice to see little details as well, and it shows an appreciation for the work and for science in general. We get an establishing shot that shows us very little of the surrounding area, but we understand the purpose.\n\nSTEVEN SPIELBERG PERFORMANCE BLOCKING\n\nBuild kinetic and subtextual blocking\n\nSteven Spielberg movies use performance blocking that moves the actors through the scene. Spielberg mainly does this for two reasons:\n\nProvide kinetic energy\n\nInform on a subtextual level\n\nAs the mood and stakes of a scene change, so will the positioning of the actors. Visual choices are the lifeblood of a film director, and while sound and music can signal emotional information, the best visual tool is an actor’s physical movement and location relative to the camera.\n\nThis scene from Lincoln begins on the letter (which supports the previous example) but watch the blocking in the scene. Stephens (Jack Earle Haley) begins with his back turned to Grant, a sign of disrespect. When he turns, Grant (Jared Harris) is towering over him, and right in his face, but still polite.\n\nThere are more men on the Union side compared to the confederate side, which suggests that the war is not going well for the South. Grant walks away after relaying the ‘disappointing’ news to Stephens. Grant takes his tea and discusses peace. Then he explains how there is just one country — not two.\n\nTerms of Surrender • Lincoln\n\nSpielberg then breaks the 180 degree rule just as Grant finishes his point and gives Stephens a conciliatory pat on the shoulder.\n\nThen Grant crosses the room to sit down and drink his tea. He has made his point and is both confident and relaxed enough to sit down. Most would think that sitting down is a sign of weakness, but Spielberg knows that, in this case, it’s a sign of stability. It’s a sign of calm resolve.\n\nSTEVEN SPIELBERG SHOT COMPOSITION\n\nCreate shots with many compositions\n\nGreat directors don’t simply build a single shot. They build many shots within a single shot, alternating between compositions. This really is one of the best Steven Spielberg trademarks because the change in shot size:\n\nEvokes emotion\n\nDirects attention\n\nKeeps things interesting\n\nOften, the goal is to create a willing suspension of disbelief in the viewer, especially with the kind of movies directed by Steven Spielberg. He can’t risk pulling the viewer out of important moments with a jarring cut.\n\nThis fluid cinematography technique isn’t easy to achieve, and requires a lot of practice, rehearsals, and a talented film crew. That doesn’t mean it’s impossible, but you should plan composition shifts in a shot list.\n\nCheck out the storyboard below made using StudioBinder's storyboard software, where we split a single shot into the various compositions. This scene is from Munich, and this specific portion is the run up to the first assassination in the movie.\n\nAvner and his team follow this member of Black September before dispatching of him in an elevator lobby.\n\nInsisto Clara, Insisto • Steven Spielberg's Munich\n\nSpielberg uses zoom shots and fluid camera movement to shift shot composition throughout a single camera setup. It switches from a full shot, to a medium shot, to a medium close, to a long shot, and back to medium close — all without cutting.\n\nThis camera work is distinct to a style used in many 1970s espionage films and it transports the viewer. Spielberg's movies are truly amazing.\n\nIn this video, we look at how Spielberg shoots 'oners' in Jurassic Park. Again, they're not just long takes for their own sake. They help give the visuals energy while luring the audience into the scene.\n\nSpielberg's Oners Explained\n\nSteven Spielberg Filmmaking Style\n\nMove the camera in XYZ Space\n\nOne of the most important cinematography techniques used in Steven Spielberg movies is also one of the least discussed. Spielberg and his team find a way to move the camera in every direction.\n\nThey don’t track laterally, or dolly in, or crane up and down — they do all of these in a single shot. The movement is complemented by the performance blocking, production design, and background elements.\n\nFinal Battle Scene • Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan\n\nThis filmmaking style supports the sort of cinematic adventure film Spielberg makes, but also the mature and dramatic films as well.\n\nThe change in speed is a defining factor, as well as the equipment used to achieve the camera movement. He also builds a static lens plot, explained in the video below:\n\nSidney Lumet’s Lens Plot • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nSteven Spielberg built a static lens plot in Schindler’s List, and completely avoided using a techno-crane on the film because he wanted to ground the viewer inside the tragic events of the Holocaust.\n\nTo use fast and opulent camera sweeps across the ghettos and concentration camps would have been completely tone-deaf, and inadvertently glorified their use. Be thoughtful with your camera.\n\nSTEVEN SPIELBERG CAMERA MOVEMENT\n\nPerfect motivated camera movement\n\nTo continue on the topic of camera movement, Spielberg is the king of motivated camera movement. The operative word here is motivated.\n\nIf a character reaches down to grab something…Spielberg may tilt down to show us the action.\n\nIf a side character calls out to the main character...Spielberg may pan over to show who called out.\n\nPeter Confronts Hook • Steven Spielberg's Hook\n\nThe reason I say ‘may’ is because some moments won’t need this particular cinematography technique, but it’s a trademark of Steven Spielberg filmmaking that helps to define his special style.\n\nIf you want to incorporate the style used by Steven Spielberg movies, this is one trademark you can use in your next project. Consider finding moments in your script that call for motivated camera movement.\n\nSTEVEN SPIELBERG MOVIES\n\nUse eye trace to direct the viewer\n\nEye trace is the term for directing the viewer’s eyes through movement, light, color, and any other method that isn’t an actual cut. You can use eye trace to carry directing through a cut, but this is different than physically cutting to say, an insert shot of a scene element.\n\nReally pay attention as you take a look at this scene:\n\nSchindler’s List • That’s Oskar Schindler\n\nThis scene is a great example. The first half shows you, Schindler, getting ready to go out for the night. We get various cuts that tell us a story, but the second half of the scene is where eye trace is used to perfection.\n\nHow to Use Walter Murch’s Eye trace • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nGo back and really watch how every decision — the money, the blocking, the waiter moving through the room is strategically built to move our eyes (and the eyes of the characters) toward Oskar Schindler.\n\nThis is a classic Steven Spielberg trademark — directing your eyes.\n\nSTEVEN SPIELBERG TRADEMARKS\n\nHave characters enter and exit frame\n\nOne of the main things I notice about Steven Spielberg movies is how he constantly has actors entering and exiting the frame. He does this with important characters — not simply background actors.\n\nThis cinematography technique does a few things. It gives the scene visual variety, suggests a world outside the frame, and allows us to focus on fewer characters.\n\nA big part of this isn’t just beginning or ending scenes with characters entering and exiting the frame. But also doing it in the middle of the scenes. Filmmakers are often so fixated (as they should be) on the imagery that will be on screen that they almost psychologically block out the idea that the space around the characters even exists.\n\nIf you want to emulate the Steven Spielberg directing style, make sure to have characters enter and exit the frame to intro scenes, to punctuate scenes, but also everywhere in between.\n\nAuteur Theory Made Practical\n\nExplore directing techniques used by the greats\n\nCreate works like these iconic auteur directors. Explore practical directing tips you can immediately put into action on your next project\n\nEXPLORE Auteur Directors\n\nSteven Spielberg Cinematography Techniques\n\nBlow out the windows with light\n\nIn the early years when I would watch Spielberg films, I’d often notice the lighting. This isn’t always a good thing, mind you, but what I noticed was that the scenes often had windows that led to the outside world, and how the light coming through was almost blinding.\n\nMost cinematographers will admit that the windows are overexposed when considering conventional cinematography rules. But when paired with a soft key light and a large room the results are pretty magical.\n\nThis is one of the more technical cinematography techniques that Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski incorporate in their collaborative works. It can achieve a lot of things like building mystery, creating contrast, and an overall sci-fi look that supports these other-worldly situations.\n\nSpielberg and Kaminski will use this technique in multiple films even though they each fit inside totally separate movie genres.\n\nThey've used this cinematography technique in sci-fi films like A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Minority Report, but also in historical docudramas like Munich and Lincoln.\n\nThe Arrest of Howard Marks • Minority Report\n\nThese films have a lot of differences from tone and time period, but the technique is so versatile and stunning that it can be used throughout.\n\nWhen there is a harsh backlight, it often seeps into the under-lit room and wraps around objects and characters. This helps to amplify the three-dimensional space, and often creates a chiaroscuro effect. It also sets a really strong tone and mood — one that may suggest hope.\n\nBut it can also suggests mystery, because while light can illuminate a space, it can also blind the viewer and mask imagery through its sheer power. I tried to make sure all of the cinematography techniques on this list were about as practical as could be, and this is one of the more viable Steven Spielberg trademarks you can use to get a similar look in your film.\n\nSTEVEN SPIELBERG FILMMAKING\n\nSupport moments with visual choices\n\nWe touched a bit on this earlier, but Steven Spielberg movies always look for ways to support moments with visual choices.\n\nThink about the famous water ring scene in Jurassic Park. He uses a complimentary plastic cup of water to create suspense. The best part is how the water was introduced when Dr. Malcom describes the chaos theory, and in general, how water is the main source of life on earth.\n\nWater Cup Scene • Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park\n\nThe water theme was in the book, mind you, but what wasn’t in the book was the actual water ripples. And Spielberg uses visual techniques in his movies all the time. Sometimes it will be a reflection of something in the mirror, and other times it will be the way someone tosses their hat.\n\nSTEVEN SPIELBERG TRADEMARK ESSAY\n\nGuide emotion with views of the face\n\nThere is a Steven Spielberg trademark that has been previously dubbed as the ‘Spielberg face.’ This is where he shows a character experiencing an emotion, and then cuts to what they're looking at, which is often awe-inspiring.\n\nWelcome to Jurassic Park • The Steven Spielberg Face\n\nWhat these shots do is add an extra layer to the Kuleshov effect.\n\nYou’re directed and informed to feel the same as his character. Steven Spielberg builds vicarious emotion in his movies, and cutting from this shot also helps to make the VFX more effective.\n\nNow… does the John Williams score help? Of course it does! There is no doubt that John Williams music completely puts scenes like these over the top. But there are some serious visual skills at work when a computer-generated dinosaur grazing can make you well up a bit.\n\nSTEVEN SPIELBERG POINT OF THOUGHT\n\nUse ‘point of thought’ when needed\n\nWriter/Director Arnon Z. Shorr describes a technique he dubbed “Point of Thought.” Here's a video that explains this idea with a scene study from Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nPoint of Thought • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark • Basket Chase Storyboard\n\nAuteur Theory Made Practical\n\nLearn the directing techniques used by the greats\n\nCreate works like these iconic auteur directors. Explore practical directing tips you can immediately put into action on your next project\n\nExplore More Auteur Directors\n\nDarren Aronofsky\n\nMichael Bay\n\nSteven Spielberg Character Introductions\n\nCare about character introductions\n\nOur final trademark from Steven Spielberg’s filmmaking style are character introductions. Spielberg movies have some of the best character introductions, probably the best. And he knows that thoughtfully introducing a character isn’t exclusive to his protagonists.\n\nYou can use side characters to signal an apparent contrast in personality from your main character. It’s almost like a bully tactic or an ipso facto.\n\nOpening Scene of Raiders of the Lost Ark\n\nIf you have one character who is starving, you can show another character who is messily shoveling food down their gullet. This makes the hunger of the other character amplified, more apparent, and thus more effective. Think about this technique for your own movies.\n\nSTEVEN SPIELBERG FILMOGRAPHY\n\nSteven Spielberg movies list\n\nThe man has been making movies for a long time — he's about to enter his 6th decade, in fact.

He is hands down my favorite director. And I’m going to share with you what I think are the five best Steven Spielberg movies for aspiring filmmakers to watch:\n\nSchindler’s List\n\nThe visual choices in Schindler’s List support the experience of the event. The choice of black and white for the film helps transport us into the past, but also has a subtextual moral connotation. Oskar Schindler’s character arc is possibly the best ever created because we see the human motivation behind a man willing to exploit war before his turn towards heroism.\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nThis film also features Nazis, but the tone is markedly different. Raiders is the epitome of an adventure film. There are unforgettable moments that use production design and props to build excitement and create iconic visuals. The stunts featured in the Ark transport scene are, to this day, some of the most exciting and cinematic ever put on film.\n\nSaving Private Ryan\n\nIntelligent decisions like adding shutter blades and manipulating shutter speed during the Omaha Beach sequence show that Spielberg is always looking to visually innovate. The use of sound design and point of view during an early sniper scene is fantastic, and the use of reflections and implied narrative during the Mother Ryan scene is masterful.\n\nMunich\n\nMunich is one of the most suspenseful of Spielberg’s movies. You always have a reason for concern, and he supports this through camera placement and movement. Scenes are composed in a way that conveys good men who face questionable decisions, and show how every person can be pushed to their limits. It’s a masterclass in filming espionage.\n\nJurassic Park\n\nIn the age of mixing computer generated effects with recordings, Jurassic Park set the bar really high. A mixture of practical effects, sound design, visual motif, and intelligent source material created a franchise that has grossed over $5 billion in ticket sales alone.\n\nNow, you might not agree with the order of this list, but know that it is based around an attempt to objectively choose the best movies from which to learn Steven Spielberg’s filmmaking style, trademarks and cinematography techniques.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCreate your shot list in StudioBinder\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, you’re probably pretty pumped to start filming your next project.
