        "text": "BURBANK, CA (October 28, 2013) – Join animation’s favorite laboratory mice, Pinky and the Brain, as they continue their plot to take over the world on Steven Spielberg Presents: Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain The Complete Series, available January 28, 2014 from Warner Bros Home Entertainment (WBHE). Tiny Toon Adventures’ frenetic animal lover, Elymra Duff, is paired with the hilarious rodent duo when she inadvertently becomes the mice’s doting owner, following a trip to the pet shop to purchase a turtle. This must-own, two-disc set will feature all 13 episodes of the Daytime Emmy® Award-winning series (Outstanding Animated Children’s Program in 2000), which is released on DVD for the first time. Steven Spielberg Presents: Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain The Complete Series will retail for $19.98 SRP.\n\nIn Steven Spielberg Presents: Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain The Complete Series, Acme labs have closed, resulting in Pinky and the Brain ending up in a pet shop. Enthusiastic pet lover, Elmyra Duff, from the popular series Tiny Toon Adventures, purchases a turtle from the same shop, but does not realize the turtle is carrying Pinky and the Brain inside its shell. With eccentric Elmyra as their new owner, Pinky and the Brain must endure her torture-tinged affection, all the while continuing their plans for global domination.\n\nThirteen episodes featured on the DVD include, The Girl With Nothing Extra, in which Pinky and the Brain attempt to make Elmyra popular, so that they may have more time to take over the world. Brain organizes the neighborhood kids into a gang, so that when they grow up, they will view him as a leader in The Icky Mouse Club. Pinky and the Brain test the black hole theory in Elmyra’s room in Fun, Time, and Space. In the Christmas-themed Yule Be Sorry, Brain has a dream that shows him what his life would be like without Pinky. These and several other laugh-out-loud episodes are featured in this set.\n\nProduced by Amblin Entertainment and Warner Bros. Animation, Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain was executive produced by Steven Spielberg. The series originally aired from 1998 to 1999 on Kids’ WB!\n\n“If you’re a fan of Pinky & the Brain and Tiny Toon Adventures, or just love clever parodies told through great animation, this is a must-have DVD release for your collection,” commented Mary Ellen Thomas, Vice President of Family and Animation Marketing and Partner Brands.
