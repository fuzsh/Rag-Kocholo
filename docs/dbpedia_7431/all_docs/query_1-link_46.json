It's the last dance, the last roundup, the last train to a place called Clarksville. Pinky and the Brain Vol. 3, 22 world-conquering, never-before-on-DVD episodes strong, is the last release in the series. But never fear, fans of megalomaniacal merriment. Because the two genetically warped lab mice (One is a genius, the other's insane) are going out in grand style, seeking global conquest in one hilarious, glorious, gadget and genius-filled scheme after another. It's a big world. Somebody's got to run it. Are you pondering what I'm pondering?"
