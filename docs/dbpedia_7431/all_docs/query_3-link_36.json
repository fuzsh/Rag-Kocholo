        "text": "Spielberg’s opening film of the 1990s was Hook (1991), a retelling of J.M. Barrie’s Peter Pan. Despite a cast that included major stars Robin Williams and Julia Roberts, the movie was a critical and commercial failure. Spielberg, however, returned to form in dramatic fashion with not one but two enormously popular 1993 releases. The first, Jurassic Park, was an adaptation of Michael Crichton’s best-selling novel (1990) about dinosaurs re-created and running amok on a remote isle. Its scenes of peril are less deftly blended with character-focused downtime activity than in Jaws, but technology is employed to great effect, and there are enough potent shocks to indicate that Spielberg was still a master of Alfred Hitchcock-worthy suspense.\n\nSpielberg’s second film from 1993, Schindler’s List, tells the true story of a group of Polish Jews who avoided Nazi extermination camps with the aid of German industrialist Oskar Schindler during World War II. The drama—which featured notable performances by Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes—quieted many of Spielberg’s critics. It was shot with unflinching detail in black and white, and it won Spielberg his first Academy Award for best director. In addition, the film garnered six other Oscars, including best picture.\n\nIn 1994 Spielberg joined with multimedia moguls Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen to found a new studio, DreamWorks, which was particularly successful as a creator of such popular animated films as Antz (1998), the Shrek series (2001, 2004, 2007, and 2010), and Puss in Boots (2011). In 2006 the partners sold the company to Viacom for $1.6 billion.\n\nOn the directorial front, Spielberg’s The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) failed to attain the majesty of Jurassic Park, but it had many compelling moments. Based on a 1995 best seller by Crichton, who reportedly wrote the book at the behest of Spielberg himself, the film repeats the Jurassic Park formula with a largely new cast—Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, and Arliss Howard—and returnee Jeff Goldblum, who again plays a scientist who knows this manipulation of nature for profit is both crass and morally indefensible. There are numerous thrills, and the dinosaur special effects equal those of the earlier film.\n\nAmistad (1997) found Spielberg in social historian mode. The film centres on the slave revolt that took place aboard the Spanish slave ship Amistad in 1839 and the subsequent trial in the United States for which the slaves were tried for insurrection on the high seas only to be ruled by the court to have been kidnap victims. Matthew McConaughey was effective as a defense lawyer, and Anthony Hopkins earned an Academy Award nomination for his showy role as former U.S. president John Quincy Adams, who is importuned to defend the slaves before the Supreme Court. As Cinque, the leader of the Africans, Djimon Hounsou gave a memorable performance. The film was well received critically, but it did only modest business at the box-office."
