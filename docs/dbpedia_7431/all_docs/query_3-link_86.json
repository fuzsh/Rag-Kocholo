Recommended for all collections.\" — School Library Journal , starred review   Steven Spielberg is the legendary director and producer behind many of the most popular films of all time—now, discover where did it all began with this exclusive look into his life.   Before Steven made films, he watched them. Naturally inventive with a vivid imagination, he was known for creating stories inspired by the world around him.

He also suffered the pain of his parents’ divorce. Films, and the magic they contained, became a necessary escape.   From his younger years to his first days on a movie set, this biography captures the unique ways Steven’s memories influenced his career, helping him to become the celebrated filmmaker that he is today.",
