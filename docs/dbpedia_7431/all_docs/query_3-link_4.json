        "text": "Filmography of American filmmaker Steven Spielberg\n\nSteven Spielberg is an American director, producer and writer. He is considered one of the founding pioneers of the New Hollywood era, as well as one of the most popular directors and producers in film history.[1] He is also one of the co-founders of Amblin Entertainment, DreamWorks Pictures, and DreamWorks Animation.\n\nIn a career spanning more than five decades, Spielberg's films have spanned many themes and genres. Spielberg's early science-fiction and adventure films were seen as archetypes of modern Hollywood escapist filmmaking.[2] In later years, his films began addressing humanistic issues such as the Holocaust, the transatlantic slave trade, civil rights, war, and terrorism.\n\nSpielberg won the Academy Award for Best Director for Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, as well as receiving six other nominations.[3] Three of Spielberg's films—Jaws, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and Jurassic Park—achieved box office records, originated, and came to epitomize the blockbuster film.[4] The worldwide box office receipts of all Spielberg-directed films exceeds $10 billion, making him the highest-grossing director in cinematic history.\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nSpielberg has worked as a producer, executive producer, director, or in an otherwise creative capacity on several films where he was not credited.\n\nDirector and writer\n\n[edit]\n\nShort film\n\nYear Film Credited as Notes Director Producer Writer 1959 The Last Gun Yes Yes No 1961 Fighter Squad Yes Yes Yes Escape to Nowhere Yes Yes Yes 1967 Slipstream Yes Yes No Unfinished 1968 Amblin' Yes No Yes Also editor (Uncredited)\n\nFeature film\n\nYear Title Director Producer Writer Notes 1964 Firelight Yes Yes Yes Amateur film; also editor, cinematographer and composer 1971 Duel Yes No No Extended theatrical version of original TV movie 1973 Ace Eli and Rodger of the Skies No No Story [5] 1974 The Sugarland Express Yes No Story Theatrical film directing debut 1975 Jaws Yes No No Also uncredited voice of Amity Point Lifestation Worker and clarinetist in orchestra [6] 1977 Close Encounters of the Third Kind Yes No Yes Also visual effects concepts [7] 1979 1941 Yes No No [8] 1981 Raiders of the Lost Ark Yes No No [9] 1982 E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial Yes Yes No [10] Poltergeist No Yes Yes Co-writer with Michael Grais and Mark Victor.
