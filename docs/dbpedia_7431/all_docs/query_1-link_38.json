The Steven Spielberg Presents: Pinky, Elmyra & The Brain was a great show that developed from Animaniacs and I am happy that I can now share the fun with my boys.\n\nThe Steven Spielberg Presents: Pinky, Elmyra & The Brain Complete Series is now on DVD and includes 13 episodes of hilarious adventures. The series revolves around 2 mice that have been moved from the former Acme labs into a pet shop where pet lover, Elmyra Duff inadvertently becomes their owner. Pinky and The Brain continue their quest to take over the world while enduring the torture-like affection of Elmyra.\n\nPinky, Elmyra and The Brain are always sure to provide plenty of out-loud laughs for the whole family. What makes this show so special is that it provides much of the slap-stick comedy of the Looney Tunes and Tiny Toon Adventures that all children enjoy and combine it with the quick wit and pop culture references that adults can enjoy.\n\nMy boys loved watching Pinky, Elmyra and The Brain and I’m sure we’ll watch many more episodes.\n\nI received the featured DVD in exchange for my honest opinion. My opinions are not influenced by the company."
