And the guy in the oncoming car wants his half of the road. The middle half. But nobody can match what Pinky and the Brain want. They want the world. Now! If not before. Welcome back, cartoon brainiacs, for more tales of global megalomaniacal merriment. So, then, are you pondering what I'm pondering? No, not that. She didn't like you anyway. Ponder instead these 22, world-conquering, episodes from the Steven Spielberg Presents Pinky and the Brain series. Better yet, watch then ponder. Narf!"
