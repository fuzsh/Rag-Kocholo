He has been involved in television since the very start of his career, when he racked up credits on such TV shows as Marcus Welby, M.D. and Night Gallery, and his first film success was the made-for-TV movie Duel. Since his rise to success, he has been a driving creative force on everything from children's cartoons such as Tiny Toon Adventures and Animaniacs to the critically acclaimed HBO World War II miniseries Band of Brothers.\n\nRoles\n\nGuest Starring Roles\n\nSeries Role Episode Airdate The Tracey Ullman Show Himself 4x06 - The Gate November 5, 1989 Tiny Toons Adventures Himself 2x08 - Buster and Babs Go Hawaiian November 18, 1991 Biography of the Millennium: 100 People - 1000 Years 91 1x01 - Part One October 1, 1999 The Directors Himself 2x03 - Steven Spielberg August 1, 2002 Great Performances Himself 28x04 - Chuck Jones: Extremes and In-Betweens - Life in Animation November 22, 2000 The E!
