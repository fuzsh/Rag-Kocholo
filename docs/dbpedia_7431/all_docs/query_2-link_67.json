And yes, executive producer Steven Spielberg is along for the ride.\n\nHulu has picked up two brand-new seasons of Animaniacs, which will feature Yakko, Wakko, and Dot, along with side characters like Pinky and the Brain. Spielberg will executive produce with Warner Bros. president Sam Register and Amblin Televisionâs co-presidents. In a press release, Register said, âParents who grew up with the cartoon now have new episodes to share with their own families.â\n\nThis news comes with the announcement that the entire library of original-run Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain, Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain, and Tiny Toon Adventures are available now on Hulu. The new Animaniacs will debut in 2020."
