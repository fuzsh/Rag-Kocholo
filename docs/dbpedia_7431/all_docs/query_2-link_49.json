Parents can help introduce the youngins whoâ€™ve never seen it before with 13 episodes starring the Warner siblings: Yakko, Wakko, and Dot.\n\nIn the reboot, the siblings return to their home in the Warner Bros. water tower to wreak havoc as they run wild through the studio, turning the world into their personal playground. Pinky and the Brain â€” who originated on the Animaniacs series before receiving a spin-off of their own â€” will also return to pick up on their quest for world domination.\n\nSteven Spielberg is back as executive producer, along with Sam Register of Warner Bros. Animation and Cartoon Network Studios, Justin Falvey and Darryl Frank of Amblin Television, Wellesley Wild, and Gabe Swarr.\n\nGet a preview with the trailer below and check it out on Hulu on Friday, Nov. 20."
