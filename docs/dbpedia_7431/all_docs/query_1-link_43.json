        "text": "I was watching my old Animaniacs tapes the other day and was starting to wonder why Steven Spielberg doesn't present anything anymore? His shows brought a fresh clean look to animation with really enjoyable characters. There are not that many shows today that take a stab at pop culture like Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain, and Freakazoid, the closest ones that come to mind these days are The Simpson's and South Park.\n\nWatching Animaniacs I noticed the animation. It's great! The character designs are clean and smooth. Same with the background. And the thing is, this show started out on weekdays. Most of the weekend shows these days don't even come close to this kind of animation. Well, maybe Duck Dodgers.\n\nI miss all of the Steven Spielberg presents. I do enjoy todays Toons, Spoungebob, Ed Edd N' Eddy, Fairly Oddparents, they are great. Maybe it just because I have grown up. But I miss the old comedy toons of the nineteen ninety's. Not like the Mucha Lucha of today. Even though that El Rey cracks my (Nasty Stuff) up. (Grant it, when I was younger, all of the Fleas fart jokes and slock would make me laugh. When I was younger.)\n\nrobert said:\n\nThe WB produced all of his animated shows, and after they got control of Pokemon they stopped doing the kind of A!/PatB/Tiny Toons cartoons that they used to. So I guess they had no more room for Spielburg cartoons, and he was probably too busy with his movies to do any more cartoon producing. And his last produced cartoon was the failed \"Pinky, Elmyra, and the Brain\" where he failed to prevent one of his favorite characters from ruining Pinky and the Brain, so maybe at that point he'd had enough.\n\nHis shows were also cut short by WB. I don`t think any of his shows lated more then 3 seasons. Which is a shame cause freakazoid own.\n\nRAINMAN said:\n\nHis shows were also cut short by WB. I don`t think any of his shows lated more then 3 seasons. Which is a shame cause freakazoid own.\n\nThere's some truth to this, which I never really noticed before...and it's kind of disturbing. TTA did only last 3 years (the last season moving over to FOX), and honestly the 1st season was the best, IMO. Then the release of the video How I Spent My Summer Vacation, which was terrific. Since then, they've only done 3 specials: How I Spent My Spring Break Vacation, The Christmas Show, and Night Ghoulery - Night Ghoulery being my favorite of those.\n\nFreakazoid! lasted only 2 seasons, which the 1st season being the best again. This show had SO much potential, and I was one of the fans who was really upset to know that the show was cancelled, when very subpar shows (Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain, and Hysteria!) got the green light. Whoever said that F! should be brought back for Adult Swim has a point - though I'd rather it stick to the 1st season format more.\n\nAnimaniacs was the only Steven Spielberg production that lasted the longest. By my count, it lasted 5 yrs. (1993 - 1998). Final episode was the Star Wars spoof, which really wasn't much of a finale to me... This is yet another show that had so much MORE to offer. I would have loved to see the Warner kids make fun of the Spice Girls, George Bush, Mike Tyson vs Evander Holyfield, J-Lo, Scream, etc.\n\nI do remember Toonsylvania, but that was when Steven moved on over to DreamWorks. This show lasted only one full season - mainly because they kept switching the times around, as well as moving it from FOX over to FOX Family Channel. Can't really say the show had much potential, but the first couple of months of episodes were funny and somewhat entertaining (Dr. Vick's mouth was VERY animated).\n\nWell, if Steven did come out with something else, it would more than likely be under DreamWorks. I've often wondered whether he could take his \"presented\" cartoons (A!, F!, TTA, P&TB, or even Toonsylvania) and put new eps. out under DreamWorks - considering TTA, and P&TB were contracted to Nickelodeon, with the WB logo being etched and screened out in most scenes. Guess it's wishful thinking, but one can dream.\n\nFinal episode was the Star Wars spoof, which really wasn't much of a finale to me... This is yet another show that had so much MORE to offer. I would have loved to see the Warner kids make fun of the Spice Girls, George Bush, Mike Tyson vs Evander Holyfield, J-Lo, Scream, etc.\n\nActually, know what? \"Star Warners\" was a PINKY AND THE BRAIN episode. I know that's hard to believe, but it really was made as episode 65 of P&B. It makes sense...every one of these classic shows that made it to episode 65 always did something special and above-average for that particular episode. Tiny Toons did K-ACME TV, Animaniacs had the 65th Anniversary Spectacular, and Pinky and the Brain had a reunion with the A! characters in a Star Wars parody.\n\nSo actually, the final Animaniacs episode was the 99th episode, the tribute to Richard Stone. It's quite a whimper of an episode to go out on, but Stone needed the tribute...this was one of the last cartoons he scored and now he's dead.\n\nThe joke credit in episode 99 said, \"Just wait until episode #100! JUST WAIT! AND WAIT! AND WAIT!\"\n\nEvander Holyfield was mentioned in season 5....\n\nAnd \"Pinky, Elmyra and The Brain\" premiered the same year that Toonsylvania did, so I don't see why Spielberg couldn't have continued exec'ing Warner Bros. shows. They just didn't want him anymore.\n\nMartianinvader said:\n\nActually, know what? \"Star Warners\" was a PINKY AND THE BRAIN episode. I know that's hard to believe, but it really was made as episode 65 of P&B. It makes sense...\n\nIt was? I'm trying to remember the Star Warners episode completely, and I remember the first skit was about the entire A! cast trying to get the orchestra together for a performance. Then next came the Star Warners ep. That was supposed to be a P&TB episode? That seems odd to me, considering they definitely didn't have as many speaking roles as the Warner kids. Yeah, they had key roles because of who they were portraying, and Brain still on his take over mission, but it's kinda hard to believe that it was intentioned for the final P&TB ep, especially since after Star Warners, P&TB transformed to EP&TB, which we all cringe at the thought of...even though I too like Elmyra...but joining her with P&TB was just wrong on SO many levels....."
