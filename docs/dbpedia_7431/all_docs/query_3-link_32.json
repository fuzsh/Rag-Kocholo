        "text": "Adebiyi Gbenga\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n3 min read\n\n·\n\nOct 17, 2018\n\n--\n\nSteven Spielberg\n\nAs they say you are as rich as your 5 closest friends. So your Inner circle is important.\n\nI watched a 2hrs 30 mins documentary on Steven Spielberg and I learnt a whole lot on inner circles.\n\nFor those that don’t know who Steven Spielberg is;\n\nSteven Spielberg is one of the highest grossing directors in the history of Hollywood — This guy grossed more than $1 Billion by the early 80s from just 4 films. According to Forbes Steven Spielberg is worth $3.7 billion so you know how big a guy he is.\n\nHe’s the director of popular films like Indiana Jones, Jaws, Catch me if you can and Jurassic Park.\n\nSo back to the lessons I learnt from the Spielberg’s Docufilm;\n\nI realized he had a strong inner circle, I mean a very solid group of friends who were directors like him. The funny thing I got to know was that All 4 of them became Legendary directors, they are:\n\n•George Lucas (Star wars and Indiana Jones (Producer))\n\n•Martin Scorsese (Departed, Wolf of Wall Street)\n\n•Brian De Palma (Scarface and Mission Impossible 1)\n\nEven Frank Coppola was (The Godfather) was a close friend to these guys.\n\nLooking at all these names, it’s not a coincidence that they all became legendary directors,\n\nin the Docufilm, They all spoke about how they challenged each other, how they each critiqued the other persons film before it gets released.\n\nLook at those names above including Steven Spielberg, imagine as a film director or producer you have those 4 legendary guys critiquing you. That’s mind blowing.\n\nSome selected highlights from the docufilm on how INNER circle did a lot for this guys.\n\nFirst, when George Lucas finished Star Wars he didn’t even know how well it will do and he was dejected after the production. They all went to eat (George, Steven, Brian and Martin) and during the critiquing it was Brian that suggested he put a backstory on the fantasy world at the beginning of the movie.\n\nWe all know how Star Wars became a big franchise of Multibillions of dollars.\n\nSecondly, at a time when Steven Spielberg had a reputation for overblown film budgets, No studio wanted to give him films to direct. When George had the idea of Indiana Jones, he chose Steven to direct it and every Studio turned him down, some even said they will go ahead and finance it on the condition that he removes Steven. George stood by Steven and was assuring them that Steven won’t go above budget. That’s how Indiana Jones came to life and became a success.\n\nAt the end George jokingly said he was sure Steven didn’t go above budget because he didn’t want to disappoint him.\n\nThirdly, if you have watched Scarface, the popular ending scene where Tony Montana (Al Pacino) was ambushed by Sosa’s Men in the big Building was shot by Steven Spielberg. Brian mentioned that that’s how they allow each other direct scenes in their movies.\n\nThis and many more examples showed how they lifted each other up.\n\nOne of my mentors use to say the power of the Lion is the Pride (how they move in groups)\n\nAll in all ensure you actively select your inner circle because this is vital."
