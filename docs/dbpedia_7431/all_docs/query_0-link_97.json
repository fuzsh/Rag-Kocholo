        "text": "Where are all the mommies that grew up watching cartoons in the 90’s? I know you all are out there and that you have seen at least one episode of Pinky, Elmyra, & The Brain! I know that if I asked you “what are we going to do tonight?”, that your answer would be “We are going to be taking over the world Pinky!”. If you have no idea what I am talking about then you need to read this review and get a copy for your home right away! I was asked to review Pinky, Elmyra & The Brain: The Complete Series Now on DVD and I really could not say no because it was such a classic cartoon growing up. I think some of you readers may have gotten to know me a little by now and know that I really enjoy introducing my children to some of the shows that I enjoyed watching while growing up. So this was a review that was perfect for this mommy to accept.\n\nWhen Pinky, Elmyra & The Brain: The Complete Series On DVD arrived my kids were super excited until they opened up the packaging and realized that had no idea what this cartoon was or who the characters were. They were so boohoo faced. I sat them down and had to get them as hyped up as I was about having such an awesome DVD to add to our family collection. Lets start with Elmyra and explain a little about her character and what makes her so much fun to watch. She is a little red headed girl that absolutely loves animals to death. When I say to death I pretty much mean literally. When she hugs them or holds them she almost chokes them to heaven without any idea. She is a little slow to figure things out. Pinky & The Brain used to be held in a Lab and every night would make plans to escape and take over the world. They ended up with Elmyra when the Lab blew up and they hid inside the shell of a turtle. The turtle ended up in a pet store and well Elmyra had to bring him home to hug and love and never let go. So in a nut shell the two lab mice end up from being in a lab to being in the home of a crazed obsessive animal owner who is not the smartest kid in the world. Its really funny!\n\nSo after a little coercing and some funny imitations of Elmyra and The Brain, I convinced my children to give at least 2 episodes a chance and to watch Pinky, Elmyra & The Brain: The Complete Series with me. To be honest my younger 4 year old really enjoyed watching it with me but was trying to pretend he did not like it because he knew it would upset me. My 2 year old daughter just can not sit for long periods of time and was out of the room rather quick, BUT my 12 year old loved it! He thought the jokes were funny and that he liked seeing how the stupid plans that The Brain comes up with always gets spoiled. Either way I had fun sharing my childhood memories with my children and that is a win for this Mommy!\n\nTwo-Disc DVD Set Features Over Four Hours of Animated Fun!\n\nJoin animation’s favorite laboratory mice, Pinky and the Brain, as they continue their plot to take over the world on Steven Spielberg Presents: Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain The Complete Series, available January 28, 2014 from Warner Bros Home Entertainment (WBHE). Tiny Toon Adventures’ frenetic animal lover, Elymra Duff, is paired with the hilarious rodent duo when she inadvertently becomes the mice’s doting owner, following a trip to the pet shop to purchase a turtle. This must-own, two-disc set will feature all 13 episodes of the Daytime Emmy® Award-winning series (Outstanding Animated Children’s Program in 2000), which is released on DVD for the first time. Steven Spielberg Presents: Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain The Complete Series will retail for $19.98 SRP.\n\nIn Steven Spielberg Presents: Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain The Complete Series, Acme labs have closed, resulting in Pinky and the Brain ending up in a pet shop. Enthusiastic pet lover, Elmyra Duff, from the popular series Tiny Toon Adventures, purchases a turtle from the same shop, but does not realize the turtle is carrying Pinky and the Brain inside its shell. With eccentric Elmyra as their new owner, Pinky and the Brain must endure her torture-tinged affection, all the while continuing their plans for global domination.\n\nThirteen episodes featured on the DVD include, The Girl With Nothing Extra, in which Pinky and the Brain attempt to make Elmyra popular, so that they may have more time to take over the world. Brain organizes the neighborhood kids into a gang, so that when they grow up, they will view him as a leader in The Icky Mouse Club. Pinky and the Brain test the black hole theory in Elmyra’s room inFun, Time, and Space. In the Christmas-themed Yule Be Sorry, Brain has a dream that shows him what his life would be like without Pinky. These and several other laugh-out-loud episodes are featured in this set.\n\nProduced by Amblin Entertainment and Warner Bros. Animation, Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain was executive produced by Steven Spielberg.
