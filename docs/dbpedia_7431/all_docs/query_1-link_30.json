        "text": "During an interview I did with Conan O’Brien a while back, we drifted onto the topic of rules: when it was prudent, as a creative person, to flout conventions, and when it made sense to obey them. As O’Brien saw it, only ever flouting, without a healthy dose of obeying, was unsustainable and, on balance, unfunny. To illustrate, he told me a story, one that didn’t make it into the piece I wrote but stuck with me nonetheless: A well-known comedian with a raucous persona, interested in developing his own talk show, once sought O’Brien’s advice. “He showed me a prototype of what it would be: He comes out, he runs through the audience, he’s never in one place. He’s everywhere, he’s nowhere, he’s wearing different clothes, spray-painting on the walls — total anarchy,” O’Brien recalled. “And I said, O.K., here’s my take: You’re a brilliantly funny person, but you need to be constrained, because when you break those constraints, it’s enormously satisfying.”\n\nThe constraints in a late-night talk show — a hidebound format that O’Brien sabotages almost as fervently as he reveres it — are the desk, the almost-unbudging camera, the sidekick and the suit-and-tie wardrobe. But this principle holds firm, O’Brien believed, across the arts. “It’s the thing I love about rock ’n’ roll,” he said. “Three chords.”\n\n“Pinky and the Brain,” a cartoon that aired for half of the 1990s, is a three-chord kind of show, as bound by formal constraints as they come. Before spinning off into its own half-hour slot, the series began life as the best thing about “Animaniacs,” an exuberantly unhinged variety cartoon executive-produced by Steven Spielberg and packed with non-sequitur punch lines, meta-level laughs and so many showbiz in-jokes that you could forget this was a show nominally made for kids. “Pinky and the Brain” stood out for its ingenuity and extreme economy. The show has only two recurring characters to speak of — the talking lab mice of the title — and precisely one plot, set into motion in the opening moments of each installment with the same 23 words: “Gee, Brain, what do you want to do tonight?” “The same thing we do every night, Pinky. Try to take over the world.”"
