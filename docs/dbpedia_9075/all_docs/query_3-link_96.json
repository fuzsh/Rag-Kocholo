In this article we’ll take a close look at the best areas to stay in Malta so you can decide for yourself.\n\nIf you are short of time, the comparison table below gives a quick overview of each area in Malta and what you can expect.

But despite its cosiness, Valletta is the main hub for getting around Malta (it’s well connected to pretty much everywhere by bus or ferry) and is also the country’s centre of history and culture.\n\nA designated UNESCO World Heritage Site, Valletta stretches out into the sea between Grand and Marsamxett harbours, and is characterised by its sandstone walls and beautiful baroque architecture. The city’s cobbled and stone-stepped streets are packed with points of interest, including many museums, impressive churches, restaurants, bars and cafés.\n\nMost accommodation in Valletta consists of boutique and high-end hotels, with limited budget options to be found. It’s an excellent base for exploring if you can stretch your budget, or try booking well in advance to find a good deal.\n\nBest budget accommodation in Valletta\n\nBed in Valletta\n\nBudget backpacking options are few and far between in Valletta. But if you want to stay right in the heart of the capital in cheap, dorm-style accommodation, Bed in Valletta provides a solid basic option. Set in a typical old Maltese house close to Barrakka Gardens, you’re a short walk from many of the city’s attractions. It’s far from luxury but is a decent option for backpackers seeking an easy base in Valletta. | View prices on hostelworld\n\nBest mid-range accommodation in Valletta\n\nCasa Asti\n\nThis boutique inn is set in a traditional, 400-year-old Maltese house, and is close walking distance to all the main sites and attractions in Valletta.

It features an old townhouse salon where breakfast is served, and rooms overlooking city landmarks such as the opera house and parliament buildings. The location is perfect for delving into the city or getting out around Malta. | View prices on booking.com\n\nUrsulino Valletta\n\nThis post-war family townhouse has been transformed into a modern boutique hotel and B&B, featuring a roof terrace for breakfasting with 360 city views.

It’s a great option for a more laid-back trip. Here are three great options we found on Vrbo, ideal for couples or small groups:\n\nGrand Harbour duplex apartment – set in 400-year-old building\n\nGunpost Suite – beautiful apartment with Marsamxett Harbour views\n\nSpacious historic apartment – with views over old town and sea\n\nSliema and Gzira\n\nSliema is a popular district on the peninsula just north of Valletta. It is a convenient option for travellers looking to save on cost while still staying close to Valletta, and it’s also walking distance away from St Julian’s Bay, home of Malta’s best nightlife.\n\nNeighbouring Gzira is a smaller neighbourhood that extends along the seafront of Marsamxett Harbour south of Sliema ferry point. This is a slightly quieter area with some good budget hotels and apartments, and is well connected via several main bus routes on its main seafront road (Triq Ix-Xatt).\n\nSliema is characterised by shopping malls and coastal promenades, as well as plenty of nice places to eat and drink. We loved the food in Jubilee Café and the local vibe in Step Down Bar. We also found Sliema to be an ideal base for scuba diving in Malta.\n\nBest budget accommodation in Sliema and Gzira\n\nTwo Pillows Boutique Hostel\n\nThis place is about as classy and comfortable as a hostel gets. It offers a range of great value accommodation options from dorm rooms to luxury studios, and has a warm vibe for travellers to meet (without being a party hostel). It’s located in one of the most popular and convenient parts of Sliema just a couple of blocks away from the sea and the ferry port.\n\nView prices on booking.com | View prices on hostelworld\n\nGranny’s Inn Hostel\n\nGranny’s Inn is a friendly, family-run hostel on a quiet street at the heart of Sliema village. Cosy and welcoming, it’s just a short walk away from the promenade, beach, transport links, and the nightlife of Paceville. The dorm rooms include a female-only option, and private rooms are available too.\n\nView prices on booking.com | View prices on hostelworld\n\nCorner Hostel Malta\n\nJust 50 metres from the seafront, Corner Hostel is a friendly, sociable modern hostel in an old townhouse building. It has over 40 beds in dorms rooms across its three floors, including female only, male only and mixed options, while private twin rooms are also available. A bus stop is two minutes’ walk away with direct services to Valletta, the airport and other routes around the island.\n\nView prices on booking.com | View prices on hostelworld\n\nBest mid-range accommodation in Sliema and Gzira\n\nThe Maltese Sun\n\nTrue to its name, The Maltese Sun is a bright and colourful guest house located close to the seafront. A traditional bed and breakfast set-up, it’s a good value-for-money option in a great location for transport links and things to do around Sliema. | View prices on booking.com\n\nMr Todd Hotel\n\nLocated on the Gzira side of Sliema, Mr Todd Hotel is close to the area’s shopping centres, ferry port and Triq Ix-Xatt promenade. The urban-chic-style hotel has a cafeteria and bar on-site, with continental breakfast available every day. | View prices on booking.com\n\nBest luxury accommodation in Sliema and Gzira\n\nPalazzo Violetta\n\nCentrally located on the Sliema peninsula, Palazzo Violetta provides luxurious studios each kitted out with a kitchenette, balcony and 40-inch flat-screen television. Ten minutes’ walk from the sea at Balluta Bay, the building also has an outdoor pool and terrace open all year round. | View prices on booking.com\n\nAX The Victoria Hotel\n\nThis elegant boutique hotel combines a Victorian-style décor with a focus on wellness and relaxation. Its entire top floor is dedicated to self-care, including a luxury spa, gym, pool and rooftop terrace. It also features a Mediterranean-style restaurant and English-themed bar for teas and cocktails. | View prices on booking.com\n\nSelf-catered apartments in Sliema and Gzira\n\nSliema and Gzira have a great choice of self-catered apartments. Here are three of the best we found:\n\nBrand new duplex Sliema apartment – set across a first and second floor\n\nFabulous designer apartment with pool – in Sliema’s Fort Cambridge complex\n\nLuxurious seafront apartment – with a breathtaking view over Exiles beach\n\nSt Julian’s and Paceville\n\nIf you are looking for a party in Malta, St Julian’s is the place to be. It’s where you will find the best nightlife on the islands, with many bars and clubs open all year round until the small hours of the morning.\n\nThe Paceville area is at the epicentre of this scene, ideal as a base if you plan many late nights (but not if you don’t want the noise!). At Spinola Bay and further inland it gets a bit quieter, while still not being far away from the action. Make sure you have a drink in the City of London Pub, the oldest bar in Malta!\n\nSt Julian’s is a great option for backpackers looking to socialise, with a good choice of quality hostels, or outgoing couples in search of a suite or modern hotel. There are also some more luxurious accommodations, such as holiday resorts located at the north-west end of the district.\n\nBest budget accommodation in St Julian’s and Paceville\n\nInhawi Hostel\n\nWe rarely find a hostel that ticks all the boxes on our priority list, but Inhawi fits the bill. A boutique hostel set in a gorgeous building, it has a buzzing social vibe and friendly staff, without being a party hostel. Located on the border between St Julian’s and Sliema, it’s close enough to the nightlife without being affected by the noise, and there’s an outdoor pool to enjoy with sea views.\n\nView prices on booking.com | View prices on hostelworld\n\nMarco Polo Hostel\n\nIf you want to join the party in St Julian’s, Marco Polo Hostel is the place to stay.

Dorms and private rooms are available.\n\nView prices on booking.com | View prices on hostelworld\n\nHostel Malti\n\nRun by the same team as Marco Polo, Hostel Malti is an alternagive budget option set a little further away from the hubbub of Paceville. There’s still a lot going here though, with a rooftop chillout terrace (complete with jacuzzi) serving cocktails and hosting frequent BBQs. The staff team also organise tours and adventure activities around the Maltese islands.\n\nView prices on booking.com | View prices on hostelworld\n\nBest mid-range accommodation in St Julian’s and Paceville\n\nNumber 11 Urban Hotel\n\nAs you may suspect from the name, this is a modern contemporary-style hotel and is situated at the heart of the Paceville district, close to many bars, clubs and shopping outlets. A recent build, you can expect strong wifi and high-pressure showers among the quality facilities. The site features a rooftop pool with a bar open from May to October. | View prices on booking.com\n\nHoliday Inn Express – Malta\n\nThis colourful branch of the Holiday Inn chain is situated close to St George’s Bay beach towards the north of St Julian’s.

Here are three options we like:\n\nStudio in central location – close to Spinola Bay\n\nCentral three-bedroom apartment – ideal for families or groups\n\nSpacious two-bed apartment – in fantastic central location\n\nSt Paul’s Bay\n\nLocated on the north of the main island, about 15 kilometres from Valletta, St Paul’s Bay is a hotspot for resorts that gets busy in the summer season. Defined by modern hotels and apartment blocks, this area occupies a picturesque section of the coastline, although it lacks the sandstone baroque architecture that you will find elsewhere around Malta.\n\nThe two towns of Bugibba and Qawra are the focal points for activity around St Paul’s Bay. It’s tough to find any local cuisine among the scattering of international restaurants and chain establishments, but Acqua Marina is a gem of a seafood eatery.\n\nSt Paul’s Bay is mostly suitable for families looking for a resort getaway. There isn’t much history to be explored or nightlife to be experienced here, but there is no shortage of facilities for holiday stays on the azure Mediterrannean waterfront.\n\nBest budget accommodation in Bugibba and St Paul’s Bay\n\nPorto Azzurro Aparthotel\n\nPerched on Xemxija Bay next to the Simar Nature Reserve, Porto Azzurro Aparthotel combines an oceanside setting with some lovely countryside views.

Overlooking Salini Bay, the hotel has a stylish feel and great facilities for leisure, including tennis courts, a fitness centre, two outdoor pools and a wellness area. | View prices on booking.com\n\nGillieru Harbour Hotel\n\nWith roots dating back nearly a century, Gillieru Harbour Hotel has been run by the same family for over four generations.
