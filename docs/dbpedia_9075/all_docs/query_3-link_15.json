As Malta’s capital, Valletta is worth exploring! Imagine immersing yourself in a living museum that offers a blend of historical grandeur and vibrant modern culture. You’ll spend most of your time wandering through streets with stunning Baroque architecture, exploring centuries-old fortifications, and (literally) diving into the Mediterranean lifestyle.”\n\nHow much does it cost to go to Malta in July from Canadian cities?\n\nUsing Skyscanner search data for flights to Malta, roundtrip from Canadian airports, flights from Toronto from July 18 to July 25 start at $1,074.\n\nTravelling from Vancouver to Malta, roundtrip flights are around $1,300, and from Montreal flights are as low as $988.\n\nDon't forget to check the Skyscanner site for live pricing.\n\nSearch for your next vacation on Skyscanner\n\n3 expert tips on what to do in Valletta, Malta\n\nFor beach explorers, Valletta has a lot to offer, and it's a great destination for adventure-seeking travellers, particularly anyone interested in scuba diving.\n\n\"With crystal-clear waters, fascinating marine life, and a treasure trove of underwater wrecks and caves, you’ll want to add scuba diving in Malta to your bucket list,\" Lindsay advised. \"It’s a diver’s paradise with diverse dive sites and exceptional visibility meaning that each plunge promises a new and exhilarating discovery.\"\n\nTravellers who prioritize seeing a city's most impressive architecture when they travel, St. John's Co-Cathedral is a key landmark.

It's also the location of Italian artist Caravaggio’s \"The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist.\"\n\nIf you want the best view in Valletta, the Upper Barrakka Gardens is the place to go, originally built as a private garden for the Knights of St. John.\n\n\"Located at the highest point of the city walls, these gardens provide a panoramic view of the Grand Harbour and the Three Cities (Birgu, Senglea, and Cospicua),\" Lindsay shared. \"The gardens also feature a daily cannon firing ceremony at noon from the Saluting Battery, which is a unique and historical experience.\"\n\nWhere to stay in Valletta, Malta\n\nStay at The Phoenicia Malta, one of the most iconic hotels in Malta, located just on the edge of Valletta. The hotel celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2022 and previous visitors included Queen Elizabeth II.
