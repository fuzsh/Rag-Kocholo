        "text": "At some point in my life, I'd like to have a Maltese wooden balcony, or gallarija, to call my own. There are few finer places to watch the world go by. Cantilevered out over the street and painted bright, they line the sandstone town houses like multicolored cable cars, with enough space for a chair or two, a few ferns, a drink. They're places to play peekaboo, gossip with neighbors, watch fishermen mend their boats—nooks for drifting off in and dreaming of storm-tumbled seas, galleons with gull-white sails, and pirates with gleaming scimitars.\n\nMalta was British for a couple of centuries, and though it has been independent since 1964, it still has Whitehall-red telephone booths that are as startling as a lamppost in a snowy forest. Before the British arrived, waves of invaders and settlers—Phoenician, Arabic, Italian—left behind tidal flats of language, buildings, and food. Comprising the islands Malta, Gozo, and Comina, the nation lies on the periphery of Europe but at the heart of the Mediterranean, a palimpsest of mysterious standing stones and Roman remains, colonial sea battles and Parisian-­style shop signs, all stitched together by flinty drystone walls.\n\nThere are no lakes or rivers on Malta, but the ocean is never more than 15 minutes away. Nothing is very far away. The airport is just a five-minute walk from the farm village of Gudja, where goats are herded along the lanes. On a single day I can easily crisscross from the tiny capital of Valletta to the western cliffs of Dingli, where prehistoric temples huddle together facing the sea, then descend to Ghar Lapsi bay to join the congregation of women who trade stories as they bob in the water in beehive hairdos and necklaces. The waves off the beaches of Golden Bay and Gnejna are warm enough to swim in until Christmas, when the countryside turns from parchment to green and oranges still festoon the trees. In the evening, visit the old capital of Mdina, an unspoiled Baroque city rising above the fields like a painted backdrop from El Cid. Many of Malta's oldest families still live here, gathering at Fontanella café on the bastion walls for chocolate cake. One morning I take a bus south to a fishing village with the throat-­catching Arabic name of Marsaxlokk and walk past industrial chimneys and swirls of wildflowers to St. Peter's Pool, where teenagers jump off pancake splatters of rock into the water below.\n\nThere's a kind of natural brutalism to the sandstone landscape, which has long drawn castaways and dreamers. Parts of the bedrock are riddled like a termite nest with passageways and tunnels, bored over the centuries; I think of them as rabbit holes in time, out of which might stumble Christian knights and Turkish janissaries; the nonsense poet Edward Lear, who holidayed here with his sketch pad; Coleridge, who came to kick his opium habit; Odysseus and later Saint Paul, shipwrecked in A.D. 60, at least according to legend. Out of another tunnel mouth comes the cast of the Robin Williams movie Popeye, whose wooden set, built by Scandinavian carpenters on the main island's northern coast, is now a theme park.\n\n“It's like Beirut: You either get Malta, or you don't,” Suzanne Sharp tells me at Casa Bonavita, an 18th-century palazzo in the quiet town of Attard that she and her husband, Christopher, are in the process of transforming into a hotel—a place out of A Room With a View, with parterre hedges and a lawn for summer cocktails. “It's a hardworking place where you just don't know what will happen next. One minute you'll have a cove to yourself, the next an entire family will be setting up kitchen tables and chairs right next to you. There's a freedom here, in a way; some laws are rarely enforced.” Sharp, a textile designer who founded the Rug Company, comes from an old Maltese family and spent her early years on the island. She and Christopher have also just rescued a 1920s pottery studio in Attard, at the Baroque estate of Villa Bologna, and are restoring it, bringing back old designs: hand-painted pineapple lamps, artichoke-­shaped bowls.\n\nSharp is just old enough to remember a time when Malta's sunshine and slowness enticed such figures as the English abstract painter Victor Pasmore, who collected cats by the dozen and set up a studio in a crumbly farmhouse; the zoologist Desmond Morris, author of The Naked Ape, who promptly began sketching the Phoenician eyes painted on fishing boats for good luck; and Clockwork Orange polymath Anthony Burgess. It was a place of corduroy bohemians, a latter-­day Bloomsbury group in the lizard heat. I meet a survivor from that scene, the Maltese-born architect and poet Richard England, at his house in the eastern resort town of St. Julian's. Now in his 80s, with a halo of white hair like Gielgud's Prospero, he studied under the legendary architect Gio Ponti. His own buildings, candy-­colored modernist structures that resemble abstract paintings, are influenced by the materials and simplicity of Malta. He shows me drawings of imaginary cities, inspired by Italo Calvino and perhaps a need for order on this unpredictable island, and talks of the Neolithic temples, ancient wisdom, and the islet of Filfla, off the southwestern coast, which some say is a remnant of Atlantis and others believe was thrown there by the devil for being more sinful than even he could bear.\n\nSometimes I wander the island alone, meeting pale stone saints on street corners, hands raised in supplication; sometimes my companion is Duška Malešević, a friend who has lived on Malta for 20 years. An émigré from the former Yugoslavia with something of Schiaparelli about her, she has an outsider's perspective and an appreciation of island eccentricity. Trained as a psychologist, she picked up her camera and started documenting Malta's hole-in-the-wall café-bars, Catholic totems, and tangled doodles of electric wires. Many places no longer exist. “Malta was a lot emptier two decades ago,” she says. “Now visitors take photos of me smoking on my balcony. I give them the finger, but they only seem to like that more.”\n\nDuška leads me to a hall belonging to the local marching band—an organization that inspires football-­like devotion, whose brass-toting legions turn saint's day processions into Fat Tuesday-esque hootenannies. Few outsiders venture in, but it's open to all: a workingman's club of theatrical grandeur where a ruff-collared statue of de Valette—dogged savior of Malta during the Great Siege of 1565, vanquisher of the legendary Turkish corsair Dragut—looks out over plates of tuna sandwiches and potato chips. At the Crystal Palace café in the town of Rabat, the shelves are a Pop art riot of candies, and the tea is made in glasses with sweet Carnation milk, chai-style, and served with pastizzi, explosively flaky pastries filled with ricotta or mushy peas. The café is populated entirely by old men with Laurel and Hardy trousers and few words, save for the woman opposite us, a scream in Harlequin-romance pink, her pooch wearing a matching outfit and nail polish.\n\nI'm drawn back to Valletta again and again, to the sepia streets that unwind past scuffed doorways, the roads that fall and rise in parabolic curves for almost the entire length of the city. Vintage shop signs act as landmarks; it's a typographic urban safari to spot handmade designs from the city's heyday, the 1920s through the 1950s. Up under “His Master's Voice” on St. John's Street, an imaginary crackle of a gramophone spinning a ghost soundtrack, down to “Useful Bazaar” in gold leaf against coal-black wood. Stopping opposite “Carmelo Delia, House Furnisher”—­red-and-white on bottle green—I ask a shopkeeper when it was last open. He looks up, squints, and grins. “Not since the Falklands War!” Another tells of Bleak House-style family legal disputes that consign properties to perpetual emptiness. The city feels like Havana without the old Buicks, the signs evoking a prewar era of boat trains and Brylcreem, when superstitious carriage drivers shifted position in their seats after dark to keep the devil from sitting next to them.\n\nThe invaders who made the most resounding impression were the Knights of St. John, a roaming order of Catholic warriors who famously fought off a mighty fleet of Ottoman troops in 1565, raising cliff-size fortifications that survive to this day. Their Grand Harbour is a spectacle of golden-age drama, glowing at sunset like a votive candle. It's best crossed on a wooden luzzu, an eye of Osiris painted on the bow for good luck, as kohl-rimmed as Elizabeth Taylor's in Cleopatra. Opposite Valletta are the Three Cities, set on two fingers of land, a jumble of houses and church domes the color of a Da Vinci sketchbook. The city of Vittoriosa is the most appealing, tight lanes lined with potted plants leading to auberges of the French Knights and a Sunday flea market. I climb the stairs of the oldest house here, amateurishly restored to its 13th-century original and deserted. Back on the street, a grizzled man with a bare chest like a silverback peers over his saloon door and reminisces about flying old World War II planes with his friends to Sicily and back for pizza. “But then one crashed, then the other, and I knew I would be next, so I stopped,” he says sadly.\n\nShadows, as dark as Caravaggio's painting of the beheading of John the Baptist in St. John's Co-­Cathedral in Valletta, do flit over this sunlit rock. Some are cast by the still-unsolved killing, three years ago, of Daphne Caruana Galizia, a journalist who was investigating political corruption. But while the government is widely mistrusted, private individuals are replotting Malta's course. On an island whose identity has for so long been in the hands of others and whose history is defined by two events—the Great Siege of 1565 and the aerial siege during World War II that saw it bombed into rubble—people are finding and appreciating their own voices at last.\n\nNot long ago, as anyone will tell you, Valletta was dead after dark. Now there are natural wines at Cru and creative spins on island ingredients at Noni. Strait Street, once a beacon for brawling sailors, now has some nice cocktail bars—though none as fun as Café Society, on steps leading down to the waterfront. Blitz gallery opened in a town house, empty for three decades, belonging to founder Alexandra Pace's grandparents; shows have included shroud-like 3D sculptures by Maltese artist Kane Cali. Coming in 2021 is MICAS, a major art space embedded in a bastion built by the Knights, organized by Francis Sultana, Malta's ambassador of culture. It will sit near Renzo Piano's recently reimagined City Gate, a spectacle on the scale of Giza that turned Valletta's defensive wall into a welcoming, wide-open space.\n\nOne afternoon during my most recent visit, I am startled by the sudden sound of explosions. No one else seems concerned. Following the noise, I realize they are daytime fireworks, asterisks of smoke blooming in the sky. It's a saint's day parade, a church lit up with strings of lights, mounds of newspaper confetti like snowdrifts, a swaying procession of hooded medieval figures in Nikes—trumpeters hooting like Sidney Bechet, everyone happily oblivious to anything else. Malta is an island full of sounds and sweet airs, gunpowder and bells; an island intent on doing its own thing, no matter what the world throws at it.\n\nOn the ground\n\nValletta has wonderful palazzo hotels, like 66 Saint Paul's (doubles from $315), with a sweet rooftop pool, and Domus Zamittello (doubles from $236), in a renovated Baroque masterpiece. Across the harbor in Three Cities, Cugó Gran Macina Grand Harbour on Senglea (doubles from $259) offers one of the best waterfront views. For standout sit-down meals, book a table at Valletta's Under Grain (entrées from $20) or Noni (entrées from $23), whose rabbit confit is reason alone. More casual spots in town include Sotto for pizza and Da'Pippo for pasta. For a look at Malta's thriving art scene, visit the dynamic gallery Blitz and the multimedia space Spazju Kreattiv.\n\nThis article appeared in the May/June 2020 issue of Condé Nast Traveler.
