        "text": "It was a stressful summer for some of Rome’s most venerable institutions. Donald Trump barnstormed the Vatican—where one member of the Pope’s entourage succinctly labeled him “a complete cafone” [buffoon]—in a cloud of hair spray. “He goes through a can every other day!” marveled another source, leading local hairdresser Massimo Topo, who was called in to style for Ivanka and Melania. At City Hall—the Palazzo Senatorio, built in the 12th century atop the Capitoline Hill—the first female mayor in Rome’s 2,800-year history, Virginia Raggi, who took office in June 2016 promising major, much-needed reforms, became embattled as one of her closest aides faced corruption charges, while the city’s public transportation and sanitation departments deteriorated alarmingly. Then there were the struggles of two enduring Roman icons: Gina Lollobrigida, who turned 90 in July, and the Order of Malta, which in February 2013 celebrated its 900th birthday.\n\nFor Lollobrigida, the screen legend once known as “the most beautiful woman in the world,” troubles began brewing around 2013, by which time Andrea Piazzolla became the actress’s manager and the object of her adoration; concurrently, she launched a legal battle to prove that she had previously been tricked, in 2010, into a “fake marriage” by Javier Rigau y Rafols, her former Spanish boyfriend, who is 34 years her junior. This March, her estranged only child, Milko Skofic, 60, accused Piazzolla, 30, of swindling a good chunk of Lollobrigida’s estimated $50 million fortune and isolating her from her family and friends; at the same time, she lost her lawsuit against Rigau.\n\nA few years ago, I spent a day at Lollobrigida’s secluded villa, on the Via Appia Antica, interviewing her for this magazine (“Twilight of the Goddess,” February 2015). The encounter was an Italian version of Sunset Boulevard, as the screen star, resplendent in emeralds, made a dramatic entrance, descending a grand staircase while, outside in the driveway, the wavy-haired Piazzolla, wearing a snug polo shirt and tight jeans, showed off his $72,500 Ducati motorcycle. “Andrea is the best person I have ever found in my life until now,” she said. How long would the honeymoon last?, I then wondered.\n\n“It’s been years of nightmares,” Skofic told me by phone from Montpellier, France, where he lives and works. “I never cared about money. I am just trying to protect my mother from herself,” he said. “We are asking [the authorities] to investigate.” In May, a judge in Rome ordered that Lollobrigida be questioned by two court-appointed psychiatrists. In September they filed their report. They concluded, Il Messaggero reported, that Lollobrigida is “fragile” and “vulnerable to others’ suggestions.” According to Skofic, the judge will render his verdict later this fall. (Piazzolla did not respond to a request from Vanity Fair for comment.)\n\nAnother disturbing development: Lollobrigida’s only grandchild, Dimitri, has left the guesthouse on her property, where he had been living, and they are estranged. “She didn’t even wish me happy birthday,” said Dimitri, who is pursuing an acting career.\n\nOn a warm spring morning, I drove past Lollobrigida’s villa. The gate was very much closed, and all seemed silent behind it. Later, I reached her by phone. “He’s making a big mistake,” she said about her son’s legal actions. “He doesn’t have a brain anymore,” she added. “Don’t worry—he will continue to lose. Beyond that, I don’t have any other comment.”\n\nEarlier this year, Lollobrigida was hospitalized, reportedly with pneumonia, and her condition seemed serious. But on July 4, there was Lollobrigida—dripping in pearls and wearing a floor-length sequined pink gown—striding regally onto the red carpet with which the city of Rome covered the Via Condotti for a lavish celebration of her 90th birthday. Basking in the adulation of the assembled paparazzi and V.I.P.s, she gamely took a knife and sliced into the towering seven-tiered cake that had been hauled in for the occasion.\n\nThere was plenty of activity elsewhere along the splendid Appian Way. The cobbled, leafy thoroughfare (which dates to 312 B.C.) became a locus of La Dolce Vita in the 1950s with the rise of nearby Cinecittà as movie stars and other notables moved into the lush estates along it. For nearly 50 years, Lollobrigida’s neighbors have included the director Franco Zeffirelli and the designer Valentino Garavani. “We called it Hollywood in Rome,” says the couturier about the neighborhood, where he spends two months a year. “It still has that 60s charm.”\n\nJust a stone’s throw away from Valentino is the sprawling villa of a venerable duchessa, who invited me to a lunch in her manicured garden. The guest list included a principessa, a contessa, a diplomat, and two priests. Old Roman families traditionally maintained close social ties with the Vatican, and in houses like this, one is still liable to come across some very mondaine clergymen. This pair of prelates certainly seemed to be enjoying the good wine and chatter—much of which revolved around the drama at the Ordine di Malta.\n\nThe diplomat, an urbane French gentleman who is a Knight of Malta, leaned in to the table after I told him I had an upcoming appointment at the Order’s Magistral Palace, on the Via dei Condotti.\n\n“I wonder what version they will give you,” he said.\n\nDifferent accounts have indeed surrounded the recent upheaval at the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta, which was founded around 1048 to provide aid to pilgrims in the Holy Land, and later also became a military force defending Christianity during the Crusades. The Order operated from the Island of Malta from 1530 to 1798; it moved to its current headquarters, the Palazzo Malta in Rome, in 1834. Today, while a majority of its 13,500 Knights and Dames live in Europe and come from aristocratic families, the Order is a huge, modern, and very effective global organization that provides exemplary medical and humanitarian assistance in 120 countries on six continents. With a staff of about 25,000 medical personnel and another 80,000 volunteers, it dispenses about $1.5 billion a year in aid, often in areas that are war-torn or have been struck by disaster. Recently, it has been at the forefront of refugee and migrant assistance in the Middle East and Europe. The Order does not divulge its assets, but it is said to possess fantastic wealth, much of it coming from vast property holdings and trusts bestowed upon it over the centuries. “Billions,” a former Roman Catholic priest assured me. It receives substantial financial support, too, from its national associations, various governments, the European Union, the United Nations, and other international bodies.\n\nSince December 2016, the august organization has been in a battle with Pope Francis. It began with a dispute over the distribution of condoms, in Myanmar, of all places, but soon escalated into an existential conflict over the sovereignty of the Order, which does not have territory (the Italian Republic granted its quarters “extraterritoriality” in 1869) but does issue its own passports and stamps, and has observer status at the U.N. as well as bilateral diplomatic relations with 106 countries.\n\nA hierarchical organization, the Order is headed by the Grand Master, who, once elected, holds the office for life. In 2008, an Englishman, Matthew Festing, then 59, became the 79th Prince and Grand Master of the Sovereign Order of Malta. But on January 24, the Pope asked for his resignation, and after less than 10 years Festing was out of a job. What led the Holy Father to take such drastic action?\n\nOn December 6, Festing had tried to dismiss the Order’s third-in-command, the Grand Chancellor, Albrecht von Boeselager, a German, after it was discovered that, under his watch, a relief program in one of the poorest regions of Myanmar had distributed condoms and other contraceptives for H.I.V. prevention (Boeselager denied knowing about the program). Festing told Boeselager that he was being ousted on the Pope’s orders, but the Pope said he learned about the dismissal only when Boeselager informed him of it afterward. An unhappy Francis ultimately decided that Boeselager should be reinstated, and it was Festing who should go. He then appointed a “papal delegate” to the Order—which, some contend, amounts to a Vatican “takeover.” The situation seems to boil down to a primal struggle between the Church’s conservative and progressive wings.\n\nBut other explanations have been offered. “The condom story is bullshit—it’s about money,” one French knight said to me. The Vatican, low on cash per informed sources, covets the Order’s hefty coffers, which have recently swelled thanks to a bequest, reported on a number of Catholic news sites, from a secretive trust that the National Catholic Register estimates could be worth 120 million Swiss francs ($122 million). Most of the Order’s revenue for their humanitarian relief efforts, furthermore, comes from Germany, home to its wealthiest members—which could explain why Francis was so quick to reinstate Boeselager. (The Vatican did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nThen there is the Steve Bannon connection . . .\n\nIn 2014, Bannon came to Rome and arranged a meeting with Cardinal Raymond Burke, an American who has long been stationed at the Vatican, where he is about as far to the right as one can go, and is the Pope’s most outspoken critic. A few months later, Pope Francis removed Burke from his position at the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, and exiled him to the Order of Malta, where he became the Vatican’s liaison. (In February 2017, Burke was removed from this position; in September, the Pope reappointed him to the court.)\n\nNot surprisingly, Bannon and Burke were “immediately simpatico” in matters theological and political, according to one principessa, and have cultivated ties since then. They are united in their distaste for Francis, whom they consider probably a socialist, according to The New York Times. Divorce is an issue which Burke fulminates over particularly. (He’ll presumably look the other way at the marital history of Newt and Callista Gingrich, the latter of whom is Trump’s new ambassador to the Holy See.)\n\nFor all his conservative sanctimony, the Wisconsin-born Burke is Rome’s flashiest Prince of the Church. He is the only cardinal who customarily wears the cappa magna, a billowing red silk cape with a train that stretches at least 20 feet, and he also wears a bling-worthy cross encrusted with jewels.\n\n“You see him going around in his limousine, and he walks around with all these minions who carry his train,” scoffs the doyenne. “He has quite a lavish lifestyle—he acts like he’s a king.”\n\nAccording to this lady, and other sources, it was Burke who goaded the Grand Master to get rid of the Grand Chancellor. “He did the whole thing to put the Pope at odds with all those rich American right-wing Catholics” she says. (Burke did not reply to a request for comment.)\n\n“I think the Grand Master was ill-advised by some people who were close to him to let the Grand Chancellor go,” says Marianna Balfour, the Order’s elegant spokesperson, during a meeting at the Magistral Palace. “There was a power struggle between various bodies. In the end, the Pope stepped in. For the sake of . . . serenity, he asked the Grand Master to step down from his position and hold new elections.”\n\nBut there’s an upside to the weight of history. “The acceptance I’ve had among Nicolò’s childhood friends has been truly heartwarming,” she says. “Roman aristocrats have known where they come from for so long, they know exactly who they are—they don’t have anything to prove.” A refreshing change from other places where people are still “trying to grasp their places in society,” she adds.\n\nNeedless to say, most Romans are not knights, principessas, or screen legends. Last year, there was a fair amount of optimism among all classes when 67 percent of voters elected Virginia Raggi, 39, as mayor. She swept into office on the ticket of the surging, anti-Establishment Five Star Movement (M5S—co-founded in 2009 by the comedian Beppe Grillo), and on her promises to break the iron grip of cronyism that has long controlled life here. But hope has evaporated among many people, who feel that Raggi, a lawyer with a short political résumé, is too inexperienced to accomplish anything. In the view of many Romans I talked to, the Mafia’s influence remains undiminished, and the state of street repairs, garbage collection, and public transportation appears to be abysmal.\n\n“To say that the lady is unfit is an understatement,” says Roberto D’Agostino, whose news and celebrity site, dagospia.com, is must-reading in Italy. According to D’Agostino, her election and her performance must be looked at within a national context. “[Her] incompetence . . . stems from the speed at which M5S has gained power, with no ruling class prepared for the task.”\n\n“It’s the first political party generated by virtue of mouse clicks, a never-before-seen entity—a first in Western democracies—that wasn’t backed by any pre-existing party, a newspaper, or TV network,” he continues. “Pollsters predict the M5S will get close to 30 percent of the votes come the next general election.” Some of Raggi’s—and Rome’s—problems are generated, however, by the national government, which has, he contends, mandated cuts in the city budget “to undermine the Movement and avert at all costs the chance of seeing the five-star flag waving outside the Palazzo Chigi, the seat of Italy’s prime minister,” concludes D’Agostino.\n\nStill, Romans manage to enjoy life better than any others. “It’s just the most beautiful city in the world,” says Marie-Louise Scio, the brainy beauty who oversees La Posta Vecchia and Il Pellicano, two heavenly hotels on the Tyrrhenian coast. “You can walk your dogs in the Roman Forum and then be at the beach in 20 minutes. Romans are not such driven people. They’re not neurotic. They just enjoy life,” she added over prosecco on the rooftop of the Hotel Eden, with its drop-dead views of the city. The Eden’s reopening, in April—following a 17-month closure and no-expense-spared refurbishment by its new owner, the Sultan of Brunei’s Dorchester Collection—is the big news in the costliest end of Roman hostelry. Meanwhile, Sir Rocco Forte (whose Hotel de Russie, near the Piazza del Popolo, opened in 2000) has acquired the storied Hotel De La Ville, just next door to the Hassler, and plans to unveil its renovation in 2019. “Romans are among the most relaxed people in the world,” says Forte over an espresso. “The aristocrats, in particular, still think it’s sinful to work.”\n\nAll was certainly relaxed and stress-free back on the Appia during a visit with the great maestro Franco Zeffirelli. Innumerable framed photographs throughout his light-filled villa testify to his epic 94-year life. Among the faces: Maria Callas, Tennessee Williams, Luchino Visconti, Ava Gardner, Mia Farrow, Laurence Olivier, as well as “the Burtons,” as the director refers to Liz Taylor and Richard Burton, and “Lenny,” as in Bernstein. In October, Zeffirelli realized a lifelong dream, with the opening of the Franco Zeffirelli International Center for the Performing Arts. Located in a baroque palace in the center of his native Florence, it houses a museum of the bravura drawings and sketches that he created for his many operas, theatrical productions, and films, as well as a school for theatrical crafts. A gala preview party was held there in July, featuring a stirring concert given by Andrea Bocelli and a choir of 60 children. Zeffirelli was unable to attend. Now confined to a wheelchair, he speaks with difficulty, in a slow, whispery voice.\n\nBut he was in good spirits when a handsome young attendant wheeled him into the living room. “Buon giorno, amore,” he said, beaming to Contessa Maria Cicogna, who had brought me here. We are joined by Pippo and Luciano, his two sons, whom he adopted around 2000. Both of them dote upon their father.\n\nThey are not newcomers around here. “I met Franco when I was 18 and a half and in the navy,” says the Sicilian-born Pippo, 69. “I used to be very good-looking,” he adds with a laugh. “I brought him up,” says the director softly about Pippo as we sit together. “He invented me,” retorts Pippo, very sweetly.\n\nIt occurs to me that Zeffirelli, in his twilight years, has been much luckier in his choice of companions than Lollobrigida, who, in fact, lives right over the hedges. (This really is quite the street.) “She used to come walking through here all the time with her dogs,” says Pippo. “It’s been a long time since we’ve seen her.”\n\nBefore I depart, they offer to show me a real piece of Roman history. We stroll through the garden to the swimming pool. While Zeffirelli has lived in the villa for some 50 years, Elizabeth Taylor was its previous occupant. The house was rented for her while she filmed Cleopatra.\n\n“One day while her husband [Eddie Fisher] was away, she invited Richard Burton over,” explains Pippo. “They went for a swim. Here, in this pool, she told us, they had their very first kiss.”\n\n“They were so much in love,” the maestro whispers."
