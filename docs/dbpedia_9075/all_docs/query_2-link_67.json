        "text": "The Acquisition of Sovereignty by\n\nQuasi-States:\n\nThe case of the Order of Malta\n\nNoel Cox\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Sovereign Military Order of St John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta, also known as the Order of Malta, the Order of St John of Jerusalem, or simply the Hospitallers, is a unique international confraternity. It is the only organization currently recognized, albeit by a minority of states, as quasi-sovereign. In view of the claims which have been made from time to time by other orders of chivalry – or even pretended orders - to such status, it is worthwhile looking more closely at the claims made by or on behalf of the Order of Malta. In so doing we may help to locate the origin and nature of this so-called sovereignty, and answer the question of which orders of chivalry are likewise ‘sovereign’, or, indeed, whether the Order of Malta itself is truly sovereign. The article begins with a brief look at the concepts of sovereignty and statehood as traditionally understood. A survey is then made of the origins of what might be called anomalous entities - bodies which have some status at international law, but which are not traditional states. The special position of the Holy See is covered. The case of the Order of Malta is then examined in its historical context, and the basis for its claimed sovereignty assessed. The position of branches of the Order, and of other ancient religious orders is looked at. The lessons from the example of the Order of Malta for the relationship of territory and statehood are evaluated.\n\nSovereignty and statehood\n\nThe notions of sovereignty and statehood were once among the most important aspects of public international law. Its heyday was perhaps in the late nineteenth century, when sovereign states enjoyed almost unfettered independence of action. These were subject only to the regulation of their diplomatic and military action, principally by the Law of Armed Conflict, or the Laws of War. 1 The traditional juristic theory of territorial sovereignty, with the King being supreme ruler within the confines of his kingdom, originated as two distinct concepts. The King acknowledged no superior in temporal matters, and within his kingdom the King was emperor. 2 If the Holy Roman Emperor had legal supremacy within the terrae imperii, the confines of the empire, theories of the sovereignty of kings were not needed, for they had merely de facto power. 3 Sovereignty remained essentially de jure authority. 4 This was not merely power without legitimacy. 5 Mediæval jurists cared not whether the emperor had jurisdiction and authority over kings and princes, but\n\n1 International law has been called ‘the sum of the rules or usages which civilized states have agreed shall be binding upon them in their dealings with one another’; West Rand Central Gold Mining Co v The King [1905] 2 KB 391 quoting Lord Russell of Killowen in his address at Saratoga in 1876. See also Sir Michael Howard, G. J. Andreopoulos and M. R. Shulman (eds.), The Laws of War - Constraints on Warfare in the Western World (Yale University Press: New Haven, 1994); J. Gillingham and J. C. Holt (eds.), War and Government in the Middle Ages 2 (Boydell Press: Cambridge, 1984). W Ullmann, ‘This Realm of England is an Empire’ (1979) 30(2) Journal of Ecclesiastical History 175- 203. 3 In Roman law it was originally considered that the emperor’s power had been bestowed upon him by the people, but when Rome became a Christian State his power was regarded as coming from God. In America also God had been recognized as the source of government, although it is commonly thought in a republican or democratic government ‘all power is inherent in the people’. This dual basis of authority is symbolised by chapter 25 verse 10 of the Book of Leviticus, which was popular in the USA:\n\nAnd ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family. 4 J P Canning, ‘Law, sovereignty and corporation theory, 1300-1450’ in J. H. Burns (ed.), The Cambridge History of Mediæval Political Thought c.350-c (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 1988) 465- 467. Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa saw the advantages of Roman law and legal science for his ambitions and his inception of absolutism. This led to the growth of royal absolutism, and eventually to the emergence of opposition to this, throughout Europe; See K. Pennington, The Prince and the Law, 1200- 16005 (University of California Press: Berkeley, 1993) 12. J P Canning, ‘Law, sovereignty and corporation theory, 1300-1450’ in J. H.

As Hall has noted, primarily international law governs the relations of independent states, but ‘to a limited extent ... it may also govern the relations of certain communities of analogous character’. 14 Lawrence also wrote that the subjects of international law are sovereign states, ‘and those other political bodies which, though lacking many of the attributes of sovereign states, possess some to such an extent as to make them real, but imperfect, international persons’. 15 Whereas these scholars tended to define subjects of international law as states and certain unusual exceptions, there are others who go further in opening up the realm of reasonable subjects of the law of nations. Notable among them is Sir Hersch Lauterpacht. In his view:\n\nInternational practice shows that persons and bodies other than states are often made subjects of international rights and duties, that such developments are not inconsistent with the structure of international law and that in each particular case the question\n\n12125 Recueil des Cours Academie de Droit International 5, 9-15 (1968-III). See also J. Crawford, The Creation of States in International Law 13 (Clarendon Press: Oxford, 1979). Public International Law regulates the relations between nations. The basic sources of international law are written and unwritten rules, treaties, agreements, and customary law. Custom is general state practice accepted as law. The elements of custom are a generalised repetition of similar acts by competent state authorities and a sentiment that such acts are juridically necessary to maintain and develop international relations. The existence of custom, unlike treaty-law, depends upon general agreement, not unanimous agreement; G. von Glahn, Law Among Nations: An Introduction to Public International Law, 6th edn (Allyn and Bacon: Boston, 1992). 14 W. E. Hall, A Treatise on International Law, 8th edn (Clarendon Press: Oxford, 1924). Nor is he alone, similar views being expressed by other writers - G. Schwarzenberger, A Manual of International Law, 1 st edn (Stevens: London, 1947) 48; W. Friedmann, The Changing Structure of International Law (Columbia University Press: New York, 1964) 213-215. 15 T. J. Lawrence, The Principles of International Law, 7th edn (Macmillan: London, 1923) 69.\n\nwhether a person or a body is a subject of international law must be answered in a pragmatic manner by reference to actual experience and to the reason of the law as distinguished from the preconceived notion as to who can be the subjects of international law. 16\n\nThis paper involves a study of just such a case. The status of organizations in international law is less controversial than the assumption of rights and duties by individuals or groups of individuals. In 1949 the International Court of Justice recognized the United Nations as an international person, 17 thereby beginning the process whereby an ever increasing number of modern international organizations are recognized as having personality at international law. That is not the same thing as saying that it is a state, which it certainly is not, or that its legal personality and rights and duties are the same as those of a state. 18 While it is possible for organizations and individuals to be subjects of international law, states remain the dominant agents in world politics and the dominant actors in international law. This dominance has led some theorists to distinguish ‘subjects’ of the law from ‘objects’ of the law, suggesting that although entities other than states may have rights and duties in international law, these rights are conferred upon them by states and, presumably, may be taken away by states. 19 It is now more correct to regard international law as a body of rules which binds states and other agents in world politics in their relations with one another and is considered to have the status of law. 20\n\n16 Hersch Lauterpacht, ‘The Subjects of the Law of Nations’ (1947) 63 LQR 444. 17 Reparation for Injuries Suffered in the Service of the United Nations Advisory Opinion (April 11, 1949) 4 ICJ Rep 179. 18\n\n[The United Nations Organization] is a subject of international law and capable of possessing international rights and duties, and ... it has capacity to maintain its rights by bringing international claims.\n\n-Ibid 19.

Some sovereign states have chosen to relinquish certain aspects of their independence, such as the United Kingdom by joining the European Union. 26 Increasingly the scope of international law has extended well beyond the regulation of the relations of nations, and into what were traditionally purely domestic concerns. Indeed, the extent to which any country is now truly sovereign is debatable, given the growth in the scope and reach of international law. 27 At the same time, non-countries have increasingly become subjects of international law, most noticeably, the United Nations. 28 It was perhaps inevitable that as the traditional sovereign state lost ground, so newer types of international entities, enjoying powers and privileges recognized by the international community, should emerge. Yet it is ironic that the first of these international organizations should date, not from the twentieth century, but from the twelfth.\n\nThe Holy See\n\nThe Holy See, the parent jurisdiction or court of the Roman Catholic Church, was a person in international law even before the Lateran Treaty of 11 February 1929, 29 which restored to the papacy some of the lands lost in 1870. Its position is best explained by Hatschek:\n\nSince international law does not allow any one state to control the Pope in his character as head of the Catholic Church, he has to be put in a position of international independence, that is, even though he is not the head of a state ... he has to be made an independent subject of international law. 30\n\n25 Consideration of human rights obligations have become central to planning military operations; Felicity Rogers, ‘Australia’s Human Rights Obligations and ADF Operations’ (1998) 131 Australian Defence Force Journal 26 41-44.

O’Connell, International Law, 2nd edn (Stevens: London, 1970) 85-86.\n\nAs we shall see, the international personality of the Order itself was to derive, at least in part, from this functional approach to law - one which accords nicely with the much more modern ideas of Lauterpacht. Yet the position of the Holy See itself was controversial until it once again obtained actual physical territory in 1929. But the Holy See marks the transition from subject of international law with an essential territorial origin to those of an entirely different character. At times the Holy See has had a territorial basis, at other times it has not. Yet all the time, a considerable number of states have recognized the Holy See as a subject of international law. Though whether, in the absence of territory, it should be regarded as a state is another matter.\n\nThe Sovereign Military Order of Malta\n\nThe major features of the long history of the Order are well known. In the early eleventh century a hospice, served by a lay fraternity, was founded or restored in the city of Jerusalem. Its staff were bound by oath to serve the poor of the Holy Land. The hospital was later dedicated to St John the Baptist. In 1099, Brother Gerard, then head of the hospital, and who had aided the Crusaders in the capture of the Holy City, adopted the rule of the Augustinian canons in place of the former Benedictine rule. On 5 February 1113 the hospital was recognized by the Bull Pie Postulatio Voluntatis of Pope Paschal II as an autonomous religious Order, dedicated to serve the poor and sick. 31 This Bull was confirmed by Pope Calixtus II in 1120. Thereafter the Order spread outwards from Jerusalem, until there were hospitals, or houses of the Order, throughout Europe. 32 The Order had one convent (in the Holy Land), but they erected a hospital whenever they went. It is to the Order of Malta that we owe the survival of a public hospital service through the middle ages in Europe. 33\n\n31 J. C. Lünig, Codex Ital. Diplom. vol IV, 1451. It had previously been admitted as such by the King of Jerusalem; Above n. 10 ap 554. 32 In 1130 the Order was granted freedom from tolls (J. C. Lünig, Codex Ital. Diplom. vol IV, 1451); in 1144 it was placed under the protection of the Holy See (Magn. Bull., vol II, 471); and 1190 placed under the protection of the Emperor (J. C. Lünig, 33 Codex Ital. Diplom. vol IV, 1455). In England, the old Order was disbanded in 1540. It was revived by letters patent 2 April 1557, and never subsequently abolished. Titular grand priors were appointed from the 1560s till 1815. A new grand priory was established in 1994. For the history of the Order in England, see Sir Edwin King, The Knights of St John in the British Realm (London, 1967); E. J.

Only in 1879 did the Holy See authorise the election of a new Grand Master. 39 But throughout this time the Order maintained diplomatic relations with a number of countries, and, at least to some extent, preserved its sovereign status. 40 The Order of Malta is still recognized by many countries - though by no means all, as a sovereign entity in international law. 41 The Order is not a country, but it exhibits some aspects of a sovereign state. 42 How did this ambiguous situation arise? The key is in its long history, and in the dual nature of the Order, as both order of chivalry and religious order.\n\n37 Many formerly sovereign principalities were mediatised, or accorded equality of status with the surviving independent states of the former empire; this of itself does not amount to recognition of continuing sovereignty. 38\n\n39 § 32, sub 59. Since 1630 the Grand Master has ranked as a cardinal, since 1607 a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, and an Austrian Prince (styled Serene Highness) since 1880. Since the early seventeenth century they have been styled “Most Eminent Highness”, recognized by Italian royal decree 1927; Almanach de Gotha, 184 th edn (Almanach de Gotha: London, 2000). However, the former requirement that the election of a new Grand Master be approved by the Holy See has disappeared (Art. 13 Constitutional Charter and Code):\n\nBefore the assumption of the office, the election of the Grand Master is to be communicated by letter to the Holy Father by the person elected. 40 Although the United Kingdom does not now recognize the Order, Sir Alexander Ball, when Governor of Malta, was Minister to the Order in the late eighteenth century. 41 In the 1950s only five countries accorded it diplomatic recognition. But the numbers have increased since. In 1962 it was 30, in 1999 82 with full diplomatic relations and seven others with special status. Commonwealth countries which recognize the Order include Malta, the Cameroons, Mauritius, Guyana, the Seychelles, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and Mozambique; Letter to the author from Jose Antonio Linati-Bosch, Ambassador of the Order of Malta to the United Nations, 20 May 1999.

There is no military or police force, as there is no territory, or population, to defend or police.\n\nThe legal basis for the sovereignty of the Order\n\nThe Order of St John is generally held to have became a state in international law possibly as early as 1291, 43 when it settled in Cyprus, 44 and certainly by 1313, in its possession of the islands of Rhodes. 45 In 1523 the Order lost possession of Rhodes, but not its sovereign territorial character, as it shortly thereafter acquired Malta. Perpetual sovereignty over Malta was granted in 1530 by the Emperor Charles V, as a perpetual fief cum imperio of the Kingdom of Sicily. 46 Since 1834 the Order has been domiciled in Rome, where its headquarters, the Palazzo Malta, covers three acres. 47 As the rulers of Malta, the Order was regarded by contemporaries as a sovereign power. But did the loss of territory extinguish the independence, the sovereignty of the Order? Although sovereignty is not affected by loss of territory, complete loss would extinguish the state. 48 The principal question to be asked then is this: was it the Order which was an international person, or was it Malta? Thus, was the Grand Master a sovereign qua head of the Order, or qua head of the Maltese state? 49 If the Order itself was the international person, then this status should continue undiminished despite the loss of Malta. Cansacchi thought that it was arguable that there was a personal union akin to that of the Pope, as occupant of the Holy See and sovereign of\n\n43 It may previously have held certain rights within the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem which were analogous to those of sovereign states, but this is not certain; Above n. 10 ap 555. 44 The true nature of the authority exercised by the knights during their brief occupation of Cyprus should be regarded as less than true sovereignty, in that they acknowledged the suzerainty of the Kings of Cyprus. 45 In 1446 Pope Nicholas V recognized the Grand Master of the Order as sovereign prince of Rhodes; C A Pasini-Costadoat, ‘La personalidad internacional de la S.M. de Malta’ (September-December 1948) Revista Peruana de Derecho Internacional 46 231. Tripoli was also granted, though this was lost the following year; A Silenzi de Stagni, La S.O. de Malta (January-April, 1948) 47 Revista Peruana de Derecho Internacional 110 fn 10. 68 Via Condotti 00187, Rome. The Palazzo Malta and the Villa Malta in Rome are regarded as exterritorial property by the Italian Government. But the exterritorial status of the Order’s property in Rome does not however amount to possession of sovereign territory. 48 This is illustrated by the loss of the territory of the Holy See 20 September 1870, and its partial restoration 11 February 1929 by the Lateran Treaties. Nor does a state cease to be a state because it is occupied by a foreign power. An example is the survival as de jure states, later to become de facto states again, of the Baltic republics. 49 C D’Olivier Farran, ‘The Sovereign Order of Malta in international law’ (1954) 3 International and Comparative Law Quarterly 222.\n\nafter 1798. 60 This did not equal the sovereignty which they possessed as masters of Malta, and which they must have lost some time after 1798- though the distinction between the two sources of authority soon became blurred. This personality was based on the role of the Order as one of the few international humanitarian organization of its time. 61 Since the twelfth century the Order of Malta had been an international religious order or brotherhood. 62 It only gradually became an order of chivalry, 63 and the possession of sovereign powers over island territories came comparatively late in its history. 64 The term ecclesiastical orders of knighthood describes those knightly orders which, in one way or another, were connected with the Catholic Church. At the present time there are two different groups: the pontifical orders of knighthood in the strict sense and a group of chivalric orders which derive from mediæval military orders and continue to come under ecclesiastical jurisdiction. 65 The pontifical or papal orders of knighthood are conferred directly by the pope. They include the Supreme Order of Christ, 66 the Order of the Golden Spur, 67 the Order of Pius IX, 68 the Order of Saint Gregory the Great, 69 and the Order of Saint Sylvester. 70 The religious military orders include the Order of St John of Jerusalem, the Teutonic Order, 71\n\n60 The Order as such was prohibited by its rules from fighting on any side in conflicts between Christian Powers; Above n. 10 ap 555. 61 It might also be worth noting that the Order’s surviving military potential was not entirely forgotten either. In the Reichsdeputations-Hauptschluss of 25 February 1803 (G. F. Martens, Recueil de traits, 2nd edn (Gottingue, 1817-35) vol 7, 435 et seq., at 443) it was agreed that the Order should be exempted from secularisation ‘en considération des services militaires de ses membres’ (§ 26 at 485). 62 A brotherhood might be described as a body, usually of one sex, though sometimes mixed, dedicated to some religious object and subject to a rule of conduct and (usually) a communal life. The Knights of Justice of the Order are bound, like ordinary monks, by solemn vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. 63 An order of chivalry is a group of individuals, grouped for a primarily secular rather than a religious purpose, usually honorific. Sometimes a residual religious object survives, but the great majority of Orders are purely secular. Most are now what are usually called orders of merit. 64 Although the Order had been recognized by the King of Jerusalem as a distinct religious order even before the papacy approved it, it would be inappropriate to see this as recognition of ‘sovereignty’; Above n. 10 ap 554. 65 J.

Although it once possessed land in its own right, the Order of Malta was, and remains, essentially a religious order. 74 While the Templars were suppressed, due largely to jealousy of their wealth and privileges, the Hospitallers, always preserving an essential charitable function, survived. 75 The legal status of the Order of Malta within the Roman Catholic Church was defined with greater precision in 1951. Pope Pius XII, on 10th December of that year, appointed a special tribunal of five cardinals, presided over by the Dean of the Sacred College, Eugene Cardinal Tisserant, in order to determine the nature of the order and the extent of its competence both as a sovereign and as a religious institution, as well as its relationship to the Holy See. After long discussions the commission of cardinals on 24th January 1953 gave the following unanimous verdict: 76\n\nThe Order of Malta is a sovereign order, inasmuch as it enjoys certain prerogatives which, according to the principles of international law, are proper to sovereignty. These rights have been recognized by the Holy See and a number of states. However, these rights do not comprise all the powers and prerogatives that belong to sovereign states in full sense of the word. Insofar as the Order of Malta is composed of knights and chaplains, it is a ‘religio’ and more precisely a religious order,\n\n72 Founded 1099, re-organised 1496, revived 1868. 73 The Order of Alcantara (founded 1156, approved 1177), Order of Calatrava (founded 1158, recognized by the papacy 1164), Order of Santiago (or St James of Compostella) (founded 1170, canonically approved 1175), and the Order of Our Lady of Montesa (1317). The latter Order succeeded to the assets of the Templars in Spain, as well as to those of the Knights of Valencia. Each remains at least some religious attributes, though they were secularised from 1546. 74 Though the great majority of members are laymen. In some respects these members rather resembles the lay brothers of a monastery, or perhaps rather the corrodians, who obtained lodgings in a monastery in return for the payment of a suitable sum. Probably the most apposite comparisons however, is that of the lay abbots and similar creations of the post-Reformation Church. 75 To some extent, the Order of St John exercised powers akin to sovereignty prior to obtaining territory. But, as international law was somewhat fluid at that time, it cannot be regarded, on its own, as a sufficient basis for present-day aspirations of sovereignty by the Order. 76 Acta Apostolicae Sedis (1953) vol 20, 765-767.\n\nIn 1961 the Sovereign Military Order of Malta promulgated a new Constitutional Charter and Code. This was revised by an Extraordinary Chapter-General 28-30 April 1997. 79 Inter alia, this provides:\n\nThe Order is a subject of international law and exercises sovereign functions. 80\n\nThe religious nature of the Order does not prejudice the exercise of sovereign prerogatives pertaining to the Order in so far as it is recognized by States as a subject of International law. 81\n\nHowever, internal rules cannot of themselves make an otherwise non-sovereign body sovereign; though states can recognize only what the Order claims for itself. If the Order of Malta is sovereign, it is so only because of the recognition of international law. Such recognition is not generally accorded, but the Order is widely accepted as an international entity with unusually wide privileges. So far as canon law is concerned the Order remains sovereign. But canon law does not overrule the municipal laws of states. Sovereignty recognized by the papacy has canonical validity. 82 But it will lack validity in international law, since canon law is not universally accepted as a norm of international law. The international personality of the Order of Malta was however upheld by the Italian Court of Cassation in 1935:\n\nSovereignty is a complex notion, which international law, from the external standpoint, contemplates, so to speak, negatively, having only in view independence viz-à-viz other States ... It is impossible to deny to other international collective units a limited capacity of acting internationally within the ambit and the actual exercise of their own functions, with the resulting\n\n79 Letter to the author from Jose Antonio Linati-Bosch, Ambassador of the Order of Malta to the United Nations, 20 May 1999. 80 81 Article 3. 82 Article 4.

Cardinale, Orders of Knighthood Awards and the Holy See - A historical, juridical and practical Compendium (Van Duren: Gerrards Cross, 1983) 26.\n\ninternational juridical personality and capacity which is its necessary and natural corollary. 83\n\nAlthough it too uses the term sovereignty, the Court of Cassation seems to have meant merely that the Order had ‘international juridical personality’. 84 Neither the cardinalitial tribunal in 1953, nor the Court of Cassation in 1935 accorded recognition to the Order of Malta as a state. Both seem rather to be recognizing a precocious development of international personality. In 1959 the Office of the Legal Adviser of the US Government asserted that:\n\n[t]he United States, on its part, does not recognize the Order as a State. 85\n\nThe Office of the Legal Adviser of the US Government is right to assert that the Order is not a state. Although sovereignty is not affected by loss of territory, complete loss would extinguish the state. Many countries accord it diplomatic recognition, but, as with the United Nations, this does not amount to recognition of full sovereign status. But it can be recognized as a non-state entity subject to international law, which is what the Constitutional Charter and Code of the Order appears to indicate. The privileges actually claimed or exercise by the Order appear to confirm this. It exercises, to some extent, the privilege of treaty- making. 86 It issues passports, 87 but these also are not universally recognized. They do not, for instance, fall within the ambit of the New\n\n83 Nanni and Others v Pace and the Sovereign Order of Malta [1935-1937] Ann Dig 2, 4-6 [No. 2] (Cassation Court of Italy, 13 March 1935). 84 The Tribunal of the Republic, in Rome 26 July 1947 confirmed earlier decisions, especially that of the Court of Cassation 25 June 1945, which established the Order’s position in international law, as independent from Italian law; M.

A treaty is an agreement between entities, both or all of which are subjects of international law possessed of international personality and treaty-making capacity. All sovereign states enjoy the right to make treaties. Some self-governing colonies, protectorates, and international organizations have the capacity to enter into agreements, though their right to do so is usually limited. 87 As to His late Majesty King Umberto II of Italy and His Imperial and Royal Highness Archduke Otto of Austria.

The only comparable non-territorial body claiming a similar right is the Holy See, and that is now a territorial state as well as a world-wide religious body, 101 though it was without territory between 1870 and 1929. The status of the Order’s diplomats was confirmed in a wartime Hungarian case. 102 But even the right of legation is not conclusive evidence that an entity is sovereign, as any international organization can accredit representatives to other organizations or to states. What is unusual is the antiquity and continuity of the Order, and its existence in age in which the Church itself was the only truly international organization. Although the Sovereign Military Order of Malta maintains diplomatic relations with many countries, and has maintained such relations for centuries, this, of itself is no guarantee of sovereign status. Today many international organizations are recognized as personalities in international law, though they do not claim sovereign status. The Order of Malta is equivalent to such bodies. While the Order was ruling on Rhodes and Malta it was a sovereign Order because it possessed territory over which it exercised at least de facto sovereignty. After 1798 it became the first of the organizations recognized by\n\n99 He was listed as an observer (Count Ottino Caracciolo di Forino), along with those of the non- independent states of Hong Kong and Macao, and the international organizations such as the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).

It is however the City State, and not the Holy See, which possesses territoriality and is therefore a traditional sovereign state. The unique history of the papacy affords it this special privilege of ius legationis dissociated from direct territoriality. The nuncios represents the papacy to the local Church was well as to the sovereign of the country. If only appointed to the local Church, he is styled Apostolic Delegate. 102 Case No 798, May 12, 1943 (1949) 43 American JIL 537.

The Order itself is not however a state, nor can it be said to be sovereign, as that term is understood in traditional, nineteenth century, terms. Peculiarities of status can be explained by the ancient origins of the Order. 103 Any immunity enjoyed by the Grand Master of the Order, and by his diplomats, is akin to that now widely enjoyed by representatives of international organizations, rather than that of the princes of sovereign states.\n\nThe branches of the Order of Malta and other religious military orders\n\nA Convention 104 of Alliance in 1961 linked the Sovereign and Military Order of Malta, the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem, 105 the Johanniterorden, 106 and the Swedish and Dutch Orders of St John. 107 His Royal Highness The Duke of Gloucester, Grand Prior of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem, is President of the Alliance Orders of St John. Each member of the Alliance recognizes each other as historic successors of the ancient Order. As such, they must be considered the sole possessors to historic continuity, though only the Sovereign and Military Order of Malta can claim sovereignty in any sense by which that term may be used. Although the daughter Orders too operate beyond the territory of any one country, they do not, unlike the Order of Malta, enjoy the status at international law of being a legal person, or international organization. Neither the Templars, nor less well-known orders, such as the St Lazarus, ever achieved sovereign status, as they never obtained control of territory 108.

The term is usually applied to agreements for the regulation of matters of common interest, particularly of a technical nature. 105 106 The branch of the Order descended from that in England, and revived in the United Kingdom in 1831. The German branch, also called the Venerable Order of St John in Prussia, established 1812 and recognized 1852. 107 The Venerable Order of St John in the Netherlands was established in 1909, and recognized in 1946. The Venerable Order of St John in Sweden was established in 1920. 108 Upon its recovery from Muslim occupation during the Third Crusade, Cyprus was sold by King Richard I of England (on behalf of the crusade’s leaders) to the Knights Templars in 1192. However, unwilling to hold the territory, in the following year they sold it to Guy de Lusignan, who became King of Cyprus."
