        "text": "\"When a sick will come, lay him in a bed, and there, has Our Lord, provide him with your best care \" This sentence, synthesis of a deep spirituality, is contained in the first charter of the Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem, going back to nine centuries ago, and it encloses the essence of its humanitarian and charitable vocation. Today the Order, as the original military function of defence of populations and wayfarers from the infideles has disappeared, it continues its action in most charitable works in hospitals and other medical activities with its presence worldwide. The humanitarian engagement, guaranteed from the contribution of beyond a hundred thousand persons between effective, voluntary members and employees, is developed in the action of present Relief Corps in beyond 30 countries, other than Services of Ambulances, an immense network of hospitals, medical centres, institutes for disabled, aged people, children, drug addicts, homeless-also with the aid of the Order's Foundations – together with the sponsorship of numerous sanitary programs in favour of needy persons and activity of humanitarian aid, as well as in favour of the refugees. This peculiar mission of the Order is remarkably facilitated from the diplomatic relations with numerous countries where the Order is credited thanks to its traditional position of neutrality, impartiality and non-political nature. The Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta is a \" persona mixta \" which makes it a quite peculiar legal entity. It maintains the military tradition and recalls the chivalrous values, legacy of its ancient work in defence before of the pilgrims in the Holy Land, and after of the Christian people. The Constitutional charter 1 , which establishes that the Institution is a catholic religious order of knights – some of them bound by monastic Vows – and chaplains, with the aim of \" promoting the glory of God throughout the sanctification of its members, the service of the faith and the Holy Father together with support for the others.

The other face of the Order is the instrument with which it pursues its own institutional aim: it constitutes an independent and sovereign subject of international law and titular of the guarantees similar to the ones that belongs to a State. Such International legacy, heritage of the long period in which the same Order governed over territorial possession (Rhodes and Malta), has lasted till our days though without an effective national territory, thanks to the wide acknowledgement granted by several States. Thanks to its status of public entity, the Order is allowed to entertain diplomatic relations with numerous countries and is granted a seat in various international organisms, within the framework of a diplomacy that is functional to its charitable and humanitarian mission. The International policy of the Order is addressed solely to the observance of the principles as set out in its motto \" Tuitio fidei et obsequium pauperum \" , this is to say the defence of the faith and service to the poor and suffering people 3. For this goal, the Order administers hospitals, clinics, medical centres, home for aged people, disabled and terminally ill-patients. In various countries the Order is 1 about preparatory works, see General Chapter.
