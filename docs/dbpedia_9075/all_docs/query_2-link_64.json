        "text": "So what was it that Valdina did that made him so awful? It’s a long list but these are some of his more notable exploits:\n\nThe Ultimate Brawl\n\nArguably the most recognised incident occurred in April 1599. Valdina had sat down to watch a game of briglia (similar to bocci) and a clerk by the name of Giovanni Coralino dared take a seat in front of him. All hell broke loose. Valdina hurled abuse at Coralino and physically assaulted him, slapping and punching him in the face. One witness even swore that Valdina reached for his dagger and unsheathed it! Unbeknown to Carlo Valdina, however, Coralino was the secretary of the Inquisition of Malta (a system of tribunals developed by the jurisdiction of the Pope responsible for prosecuting individuals related to a wide range of crimes including sorcery, blasphemy, heresy and more) and so this was not at all well received by Inquisitor Antonio Ortensio, who took a very dim view of any harm caused to his staff.\n\nCriminal proceedings were immediately set in motion and whilst Valdina was languishing in the Inquisition prisons in Birgu, a unique uproar was breaking out amongst the Order who resented the Inquisition and wished for Valdina to be tried and punished by the Council of the Order. Unable to persuade the Inquisitor, however, and having an injunction made against them which prevented their involvement, matters escalated further. In order to prevent a point of no return, the matter made its way to Rome where Pope Clement VIII initially refused to meet with the ambassador that the Order had appointed. Eventually, in April 1600, the Pope relented and heard Valdina’s case personally, passing the judgment of one year’s exile from Malta. Far from teaching Valdina a lesson, he was investigated again, along with others, in 1607 for the grievous wounding of a nobleman, to which he was sentenced to four months imprisonment.\n\nConfrontation With a King\n\nA second notable incident stemmed from when Valdina gave King Philip IV of Spain 15,000 scudi on loan against a pledge and guarantee of two royal cities, Rometta and Santa Lucia del Mela, belonging to the king’s demesne. The king defaulted on his repayment, so Valdina decided to take the law into his own hands. With others, he marched on Rometta to take possession of the city but the inhabitants rose up against him, forcing him to retreat. Ultimately, the townsfolk ended up collecting the money owed to Valdina and offered it to the king on the condition that the monarchy never pledge the city to men like Carlo Valdina again.\n\nPiracy on The High Seas\n\nIt seems that Valdina spent and invested large amounts of the Order’s money to further his enterprises and greed. He was renowned for scheming and taking advantage of situations for his own personal gain.\n\nThis became especially apparent when he was appointed Captain-General of the knights’ navy in May 1633. During Valdina’s very first trip to Levant, four ships loaded with slaves surrendered to him without any shots being exchanged. There were comments made that it was not worthy of a knight of Malta to take loot without the slightest show of arms but, of course, Valdina took it anyway.\n\nHe also managed to secure a lucrative job when he became a contractor of the galleys. Grand Master Lascaris, in 1637, believing that the upkeep of the six galleys of the Order was absorbing most of its income, decided to farm them out separately on contract to wealthy knights, offering each taker 20,000 scudi yearly on each galley as a subsidy on the condition that the knights would be responsible for the maintenance of the ship and men. Valdina offered to take over all six galleys together if the Order gave him 123,000 scudi yearly for four years, renewable, at his choice, for another four years. He ended up pocketing around 1,184,000 scudi in all — a vast amount of money. To put this into context, Sir Peter Paul Rubens, a Flemish artist born in 1577, the same age as Valdina and known for his depiction of religious scenes and voluptuous women, was paid a stipend of just 25 scudi per month whilst in Rome. In addition, cardinal patrons were considered quite wealthy when they made 60,000 scudi per year.\n\nAn Unsavoury Legacy\n\nValdina, unlike many of the other knights, is not on record as having one single act of generosity or patronage under his belt. No foundations were set up for philanthropic purposes, he did not pay for any public building or service and was no redeemer of Christian slaves. It is therefore unsurprising that general opinion was less than favourable of him and none other than the Inquisitor of Malta, Fabio Chigi, who would later become Pope Alexander VII, referred to his conduct in such terms as:\n\nThe Order firstly needs respect for God and for His Holiness. Too many concubinarii, too much commerce in favours and in positions, not punishing the evil, not rewarding the just.\n\nHe is also quoted as calling Valdina “the most wretched member of the Order” and “a man given to vice without any good ability”, frequently writing about Valdina in encoded messages back and forth from Malta to Rome.\n\nIt was in April 1645 that this terrible man died, just six weeks after the Council of State appointed him a colonel. Suffering unremitting fevers and chills, it was a very painful way to go. Though it was not usual practice for a knight’s death to be recorded in the early seventeenth century, Valdina resurfaces in the writings of a well known Sicilian physician who was reporting on the observations of kidney and gall stones in Malta, especially among the knights. He had singled out Valdina as a clinically relevant case study, noting an autopsy had been performed and several kidney stones extracted. In a last bizarre turn of events, there is no record of a gravestone marking his last resting place and the usual files opened by the Order after the death of a knight have both gone missing in the case of Valdina. Strange to say the least."
