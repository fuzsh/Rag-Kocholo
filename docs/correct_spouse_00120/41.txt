Pop superstar Hamasaki Ayumi, 35, is now married to a 25-year-old medical student at the University of California, Los Angeles. In a blog post on 3 March, Hamasaki said “Just married☆ Today is the beginning of our life as a couple.”

The couple got engaged in December.

It is Hamasaki’s second marriage. She married an Austrian actor named Manuel Schwarz in Las Vegas on New Year’s Day of 2011, but filed for a divorce a year after. Her marriage to Schwarz was not registered in Japan so her upcoming marriage will be considered her first in Japan.

ご結婚おめでとう！
