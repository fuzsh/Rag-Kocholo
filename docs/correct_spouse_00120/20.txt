Pop singer Ayumi Hamasaki married Austrian actor Manuel Schwarz on Saturday in a church ceremony in the United States, her office said Sunday.

Hamasaki, 32, and Schwarz, 30, met last August in Los Angeles when she was making a promotional video for her song "Virgin Road," her office said.

Hamasaki, one of the country's most popular singers, sang "Virgin Road" in a white wedding dress on New Year's eve on NHK's popular yearend music show "Kohaku Utagassen," hours before her wedding announcement was issued.

Schwarz, who lives in Los Angeles, plays Hamasaki's bridegroom in the music video.
