Ayumi Hamasaki surprised the entertainment just over a year ago by announcing her sudden marriage to an Austrian model and actor who had starred in one of her music videos.

Hamasaki’s sales have ailed in recent years and we speculated that perhaps she might retire and start a family.

The latest twist is that Ayumi and Manuel Schwarz are already divorced! Less than a year is not a great length for any marriage, to be sure, but Ayumi officially blames the March 11th earthquake, which forced her to stay in Japan and remain close to her beloved fans. Rather than move to America with hubby, where he lives and works, she could not leave, thus they grew apart emotionally as well as physically.

Okay, sounds plausible. But then emerges this raunchy photo book by photographer Leslie Kee! In it Manuel is depicted in highly homoerotic poses that seem very much to be appealing to the Shinjuku Ni-chome crowd.

Could this be the real reason for why Ayumi went for a quick divorce? Her husband wasn’t quite what she expected him to be…?
