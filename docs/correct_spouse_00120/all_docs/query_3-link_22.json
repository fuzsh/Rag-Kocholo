        "text": "Pop singer Ayumi Hamasaki, 37, has announced she is getting divorced -- for the second time. According to an announcement posted on her members-only fan site “TeamAyu” (TA) on Sunday, the Japanese pop star hinted at an impending breakup with her 28-year-old American husband, with whom she currently resides with in Los Angeles.\n\nHamasaki met her husband, Tyson Bodkin, in January 2013 while she was in LA on vacation. At the time, Bodkin was a medical student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The two caused a frenzy among fans when Hamasaki took to her fan site to announce their whirlwind marriage on March 3, 2014. Fans expressed surprise that Bodkin was 10 years her junior.\n\nHamasaki wrote on her fan site: “There is something I have to tell you all. My partner — the man who has walked beside me on life’s road for three years — and I have decided to go our separate ways. He will follow his own road, as I, too, embark on my own path.”\n\nThe singer candidly confessed to fans, “I’m writing this message here because I wanted you to hear it from me first. I did not want the media to report on this first as the impending TA Tour kicks off [in late September].”\n\nWhile the divorce has not been finalized, an official representative has acknowledged, “The two have seemed to grow apart and divorce talks between the two are in the works.” Rumors suggest that the breakup was inevitable given the pop diva’s “back and forth” lifestyle between Japan and America, Sankei Shimbun reported.\n\nThis will not be the pop star’s first divorce. She previously tied the knot to Austrian actor Manuel Schwarz in Las Vegas back on New Year’s Day in 2011. After one year of marriage, news broke that the two had filed for divorce.\n\nHamasaki’s first marriage, however, was registered only in the U.S. — with no marriage license issued in Japan. Therefore, if a divorce is finalized between Hamasaki and her current husband, her Japanese family registry will only be marked as a “one-time divorcee.”\n\nThe pop star’s nationwide fan club tour (the TA Tour) will commence on Sept 30\n\nShe concluded her post by writing, “I hope to continue focusing on my rehearsals for the TA Tour and recording new songs.”\n\nOn Sept 19, Hamasaki is also scheduled to perform on TV Asahi’s “Music Station” 30th Anniversary show airing at noon.\n\n© Japan Today"
