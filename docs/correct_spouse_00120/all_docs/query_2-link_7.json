        "text": "On January 5th, Ayumi Hamasaki returned to Japan with her husband, Austrian actor Manuel Schwarz. Arriving at Narita Airport, the newlyweds were met by a swarm of reporters, who immediately spotted the big diamond rings they both sported.\n\nBoth the reporters and the onlookers shouted their congratulations to the couple, and while they smiled, Ayu did not answer the many questions the reporters were throwing her way. Instead, she bowed slightly to them, and her husband (aka, \"Many\") replied that he felt \"Great!!\".\n\nDespite the crush of people surrounding them, the couple didn't let that impact their happy aura, as they walked through the terminal, arms wrapped cozily around each other's waists.\n\nAs we reported�earlier, the couple will keep going back and forth between Japan and Los Angeles. Unfortunately, they will not be able to live together, and it's uncertain as to how long Many will stay in Japan during this time. �Since Ayu is taking some days off, however, they'll be able to enjoy their newlywed days together in Japan for a while.\n\n[gallery orderby=\"title\"]\n\nSource & Photo: Sanspo"
