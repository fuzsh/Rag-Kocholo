The Reason Why Singers’ Marriages Don’t Last!?\n\n24 January 2012. 15:30\n\nA few days ago, singer Hamasaki Ayumi terminated her married life with Austrian actor Manuel Schwarz with a speedy divorce after just a year. On the other hand, another singer, Koda Kumi, announced her marriage to fellow musician KENJI03, BACK-ON’s guitarist and vocal at the end of last year. Both are popular contrasting singers of this generation, and both presented their fans with a big shock at the end and beginning of the year.\n\nAnd so, as various complicated backstories come to light and Hamasaki Ayumi’s divorce is kept in the limelight, a review of celebrity couplings from marriage to divorce seems to indicate that “singers” like Hamasaki often do not remain married for long.\n\nFor example, Utada Hikaru and Kazuaki Kiriya, Amuro Namie and SAM, had marriages that lasted about 5 years. Sheena Ringo and Junji Yayoshi’s marriage lasted a year and two months. Misora Hibari and Kobayashi Akira’s marriage was plagued by a complicated domestic environment, and they divorced after 2 years. In all cases, the women never officially registered their marriages. For an international example, Britney Spears and childhood friend Jason Alexander held a wedding ceremony while drunk, then submitted an appeal to negate the wedding once they sobered up, setting the record for the fastest divorce. Although this last example was committed under the “influence of alcohol”, the same could not be said for the rest.\n\nAs such, all those who claim the title of singer often end up with dramatic, short-lived marriages. A journalist familiar with the entertainment business commented that “Singers and artistes put themselves into their songs and music, and they sing with their hearts to convey their message. In order to perform, their emotions are often pulled into the content of their music”. “The artiste world is full of sensitive people. When they are getting into the mood of performing a break-up song, they develop unnecessary anxiety and think about breaking up when the smallest trouble occurs. Songs dealing with first love and fated meetings cause them to fall for new friends easily. Maybe that is the mindset singers fall into?…”\n\nIf that is true, how about Koda Kumi…!? With the release of the commemorable 10th album “JAPONESQUE”, together with the blessing of a child, let us hope that she will not be jinxed as well.\n\nOriginal Article from here.\n\n—–\n\nayu Returns Without Comment… Fully Guarded, Concealing her Left Hand\n\n24 January 2012.\n\nHamasaki Ayumi (33), who announced her lightning divorce from Austrian actor Manuel Schwarz (31) late night on 16 Jan, returned to Japan via Seoul, after a work-related trip to UAE Dubai. This being her first public appearance since the divorce, Hamasaki nonetheless remained silent despite the press’ rapid-fire questions of “Have you talked with Manuel-san?” and “Is the divorce official?” On Twitter, she tweeted a message about having “no regrets” in English, implying that she is ready to move on.\n\nFor this first appearance after the divorce announcement, Hamasaki was fully guarded, dressed in a black coat with the hood up, black sunglasses and a mask. With her head bowed, her stance was stiff. About 40 press corps were gathered at the arrival gate, and though they fired many questions at her, she remained silent throughout.\n\nHamasaki also kept her left hand covered up with her coat sleeve, making it impossible to see if she still wore her wedding ring. Furthermore, she was surrounded by about 10 staff members who guarded her fiercely and fought against the press.\n\nHamasaki’s only response was to the question “Anything to say to the fans?”, to which she gave a nod. After she left the building, she turned and gave the press a small nod, but she still did not speak.\n\nLate night on the 16th, Hamasaki suddenly announced her decision to divorce. After that, she left for Dubai for work, and came back to Japan after a week overseas. She is preparing for the concert tour, which is planned to start off at Saitama Super Arena on 7/4/2012. On this day, Hamasaki updated her Twitter for the first time since the divorce announcement, with a deep message written in English, “Never regret anything coz at one time it was exactly what u wanted…”\n\nOriginal Article from here.\n\n—–\n\nHamasaki Ayumi on Twitter, “Never regret anything coz at one time it was exactly what u wanted…”\n\n24 January 2012. 13:11\n\nHamasaki Ayumi, who announced her divorce from Austrian actor Manuel Schwarz on 16 Jan, commented on Twitter that she had “no regrets”.\n\nOn the 23rd, Hamasaki updated her Twitter with the message “Never regret anything coz at one time it was exactly what u wanted…” in English. The tweet was accompanied by a fairytale-like photo of herself taken by the beach. Although she had updated her fanclub blog a few days ago, this was her first comment on Twitter after the divorce announcement.\n\nOn the night of the 23rd, Hamasaki returned to Japan from her work trip to Dubai via Haneda Airport. All are waiting to see her next move. Her concert tour 「ayumi hamasaki ARENA TOUR 2012～HOTEL Love songs～」 will begin on 7 April, with a total of 27 shows."
