In a blog post on 3 March, Hamasaki said “Just married☆ Today is the beginning of our life as a couple.”\n\nThe couple got engaged in December.\n\nIt is Hamasaki’s second marriage. She married an Austrian actor named Manuel Schwarz in Las Vegas on New Year’s Day of 2011, but filed for a divorce a year after. Her marriage to Schwarz was not registered in Japan so her upcoming marriage will be considered her first in Japan.\n\nご結婚おめでとう！"
