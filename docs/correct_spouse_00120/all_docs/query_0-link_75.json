        "text": "Re: The ULTIMATE J-Pop Queens Singles Rate, Part II: Ayumi Hamasaki (59 - 50)\n\n54. Trust\n\nHighest score - 9 (x2) / Lowest score - 4 (x1)\n\n\"Trust\" is the 3rd single by Ayumi Hamasaki, released on August 5, 1998, and later included on her debut album A Song for ×× (1999). \"Trust\" is an upbeat yet sad sounding pop number, which starts off slowly and progressively picks up as the song goes on. It incorporates elements of pop, rock and house. \"Trust\" was used as the Kao Sofina \"AUBE Rouge Filia\" CM song in 1998. The single reached #9 on the Oricon, becoming her first Top 10 hit, and charted for ten weeks selling a total of 181,820 copies.\n\nRe: The ULTIMATE J-Pop Queens Singles Rate, Part II: Ayumi Hamasaki (59 - 50)\n\n53. Virgin Road\n\nHighest score - 10 (x1) / Lowest score - 5 (x2)\n\n^this cover scares the shit out of me.\n\n\"Virgin Road\" is the 50th single by Ayumi Hamasaki, released as part of the triple A-side single \"L\" on September 29, 2010. It was the 3rd and final physical single preceding the release of Hamasaki's 12th studio album Love songs in late 2010, and was the concluding single in the \"road to the 50th single\" trilogy. \"Virgin Road\" is a orchestral ballad, with dramatic strings and piano forming the heart of the production, though Church-like Organ notes can also be heard near the end.\n\nThe PV for Virgin Road is one of Hamasaki's most elaborate to date, and features Austrian actor and model Manuel Schwarz (who would later to become Hamasaki's real-life husband). Virgin Road was Hamasaki's fifth-most expensive music video, behind Jewel, Green, Fairyland and My Name's Women. The video's production reportedly cost $1,000,000. The music video was shot in Los Angeles and features Hamasaki and Schwarz getting married. After that, they are seen robbing a bank and gas station before shooting up the place with large guns. A police chase ensues, and Hamasaki throws the stolen money out of the car. Resting somewhere on the hill, helicopter throw grenades at the couple, but they escape.\n\n\"Virgin Road\" has received a gold digital certification for paid downloads to cellphones, denoting 100,000 downloads.\n\nRe: The ULTIMATE J-Pop Queens Singles Rate, Part II: Ayumi Hamasaki (59 - 50)\n\nSomeone hold Aime back...\n\n52. YOU\n\nHighest score - 10 (x1) / Lowest score - 4 (x1)\n\n\"YOU\" is the 2nd single by Ayumi Hamasaki, released on June 10, 1998, and later included on her debut album A Song for ×× (1999). \"YOU\" is a mid-tempo ballad number with strong guitars and piano elements. \"YOU\" was used as the CIBAVision \"Focus Dailies\" CM song and ending theme for the TV Tokyo show ASAYAN.\n\nThe PV for YOU was directed by Takeishi Wataru. The video shows Hamasaki in different colored rooms. In each room something different is happening such as apples falling to the floor, Hamasaki playing a miniature piano, and her eating spaghetti. At the end of the video Hamasaki walks outside revealing a large house on the beach.\n\nThe single reached #20 on the Oricon, charted for ten weeks and sold a total of 78,260 copies.\n\nRe: The ULTIMATE J-Pop Queens Singles Rate, Part II: Ayumi Hamasaki (59 - 50)\n\n51. GREEN\n\nHighest score - 10 (x1) / Lowest score - 4 (x1)\n\n\"GREEN\" is the 44th single by Ayumi Hamasaki, released as part of the double A-side \"Days / GREEN\" on December 17, 2008. It was the 1st single released from Hamasaki's 10th studio album NEXT LEVEL (2009). \"GREEN\" is a dramatic ballad, using traditional Japanese shamisen, guitars and strings, giving it a unique feel from Ayumi's other ballads.\n\nThe music videos for \"GREEN\" and \"Days\" were shot during a tour stop in Shanghai, China. The PV for \"GREEN\" premiered on November 26, 2008 on MTV Japan. The music video depicts Hamasaki as a nightclub singer in 1930s Shanghai, styled after the Ang Lee film Lust, Caution. The video reportedly cost $1,600,000 and was directed by Kazuyoshi Shimomura. In the video, Ayumi rushes to a cabaret where she performs. As she is performing, a woman (played by Saito Midori) is enticed by her presence. Later on, the woman finally dances with her (te amo~~~)\n\n\"Days / GREEN\" charted at #1 on the Oricon, becoming her 19th consecutive #1 and her 31st overall. It sold 190,891 copies and charted for 14 weeks. \"GREEN\" is also certified Gold for full-song digital downloads, denoting sales of 100,000.\n\nRe: The ULTIMATE J-Pop Queens Singles Rate, Part II: Ayumi Hamasaki (59 - 50)\n\nFinal song for today...\n\n50. MOON\n\nHighest score - 10 (x1) / Lowest score - 6 (x3)\n\n............\n\n\"MOON\" is the 48th single by Ayumi Hamasaki, released as part of the double A-side \"MOON / blossom\" on July 14, 2010. It was the first single from Hamasaki's 12th studio album Love songs (2010), and the first in a trilogy of singles on the \"road to the 50th single\".\n\n\"MOON\" is a standard rock-ballad type song which Ayumi is well-know for. \"MOON\" was used as a CM theme song for Honda Zest Spark, and was first released as a Chaku-Uta sample for members of Ayu's official fanclub Team Ayu with the release of Hamasaki's Rock 'n' Roll Circus album.\n\nThe PV for \"MOON features Ayumi singing in a European aristocratic room setting. As the video progresses a strange, black, tar-like liquid begins dropping in the room, on random furniture. The video is also inter-cut with scenes of Ayumi smiling while holding one of her pet dogs. Ayumi is also shown with the black liquid falling down all over her face, near her chest and going onto her hands, depicting sorrow or despair, presumably of the dog shown towards the end of the video.\n\nOn the Oricon \"MOON / blossom\" debuted at #1 and sold 96,490 copies total. It was her first single not to break the 100,000 copies sold mark since 1998's \"YOU\", although it was certified Gold for shipments. This trend would continue with her following two singles.\n\nRe: The ULTIMATE J-Pop Queens Singles Rate, Part II: Ayumi Hamasaki (59 - 50)\n\nGreen is out!?!?!? That song is amazing and it has a great PV - can't believe I was the only one to give it a 10.\n\nSome other surprising songs out like Heaven and Days - I'm so used to them ranking high in Japanese polls. Heaven should have been higher for that little piano instrumental bit before the chorus alone! I also expected Bold & Delcious to rank higher. (And Far Away and Virgin Road out quite early)\n\nDays, I understand though. I thought it was generic as hell when I first heard it, and whilst it still is, I find it quite a sweet song and just nice and kinda comforting to listen to. Plus the PV is Wintery! (And I like her outift)\n\nAnd End Roll - love the guitars in that song!\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to see Trust ranking quite high in my opinion - gotta love that guitar solo in the end.\n\nThe ranking started off quite predictable with Nothing From Nothing and Happening Here making early exits but with Heaven and Days going, the rest of this rate will be interesting!\n\nWhere's Rmx - need to see what he thinks!\n\nmi|kshake~\n\nRe: The ULTIMATE J-Pop Queens Singles Rate, Part II: Ayumi Hamasaki (59 - 50)\n\n\"Trust\" should have been higher and I fear I scored it too low. I gave it an 8 when it should have been a 9 or a 10. Absolutely love that chorus and the song really builds up beautifully by the end. Defintiely one of her best early songs next to poker face and WHATEVER.\n\nRe: The ULTIMATE J-Pop Queens Singles Rate, Part II: Ayumi Hamasaki (49 - 40)\n\nAlright, 10 more eliminated songs today. Then starting Monday we'll slow it down to just 2 a day (or maybe 3 or 4, depending on how you guys feel).\n\nHere's the first...\n\n49. crossroad\n\nHighest score - 10 (x2) / Lowest score - 5 (x1)\n\nComing in at an appropriate 49 - \"crossroad\" is the 49th single by Ayumi Hamasaki, released on September 22, 2010. It was the second single in advance of Hamasaki's 12th studio album Love songs (2010) and the second in a trilogy of singles on the \"road to the 50th single\". \"crossroad\" is an epic sounding ballad with strong guitar and string elements, the song's lyrics portray someone at a 'crossroads' in life, looking to the past, pondering if they made the right decisions.\n\nThe PV for \"crossroad\" was directed by Masashi Muto, and begins with Ayumi in a dark room, by herself, wearing a red dress. Near the end of the video she burns herself and the sofa with a match and smiles.\n\n\"crossroad\" debuted at #1 on the Oricon with sales of 73,961 in the first week. It eventually sold 99,021 copies and charted for 8 weeks, making it the #66 single of 2010 in Japan.\n\nRe: The ULTIMATE J-Pop Queens Singles Rate, Part II: Ayumi Hamasaki (49 - 40)\n\n48. Voyage\n\nHighest score - 10 (x1) / Lowest score - 5 (x2)\n\n\"Voyage\" is the 28th single by Ayumi Hamasaki, released on September 22, 2002. It was the 3rd and final single in advance of Hamasaki's 5th studio album RAINBOW (2002). \"Voyage\" is a traditional ballad, utilizing heavy string arrangements and piano, the song's lyrics detail a journey to find love (\"Everyone is a traveler, wandering about in search of love\").\n\n\"Voyage\" was used as the theme song of the Japanese movie Tsuki ni Shizumu, which was created in lieu of a PV for the single. It was also used as the ending song of a Japanese television drama My Little Chef.\n\n\"Voyage\" was an extremely popular single, debuting at #1 on the Oricon singles chart, where it stayed for 3 consecutive weeks (a rarity on the Oricon), her first and only single to achieve this particular feat (\"A\" and \"H\" also spent 3 weeks at #1, though non-consecutively). It was also the last single by any female artist to spend 3 weeks at #1 until 2007, when Utada Hikaru's \"Flavor of Life\" spent 3 weeks on top. \"Voyage\" is the longest charting single of Hamasaki's career, staying on the Oricon for 28 weeks total, and selling 679,500 copies in all to become the #9 single of 2002 in Japan."
