        "text": "Re: Ayumi Hamasaki: In London for a month/New album 2012\n\nJawshx said:\n\nMonkey0 said:\n\nJawshx said:\n\nBy the way.. what's the single where it has some Americans in the beginning talking about Ayu.. then she drills a hole in the wall and is riding a motorbike in a Kill Bill esque ( I think) jumpsuit and kinda feels like a cheaper version of Toxic, or something?\n\nThat's Bold& Delicious (I think so..). I really don't like it. Which is wierd because I usually like Sweetbox, but that song doesn't do anything for me. I hate it at first, but now I'm quite indifferent about it. That was the point when I drifted away from Ayu. I was such a stan back in the day.\n\nNot the video I wanted.. but listening to it now, Bold And Delicious really doesn't sound like an Ayu song.. do not want.\n\nSorry. It's \"Startin'\" ! For sure.\n\nI'm listening to \"Rainbow\" right now. God it's absolutely gorgeous, one of her best tracks.\n\nRe: Ayumi Hamasaki: In London for a month/New album 2012\n\nOkay sorry to annoy everyone again, but I've just finished uploading every song for the singles rate up to tumblr (via a hole in the system which allows unlimited uploads, hehe...) The thread won't be up till the 1st or 2nd but if anyone wants to get a jump on listening, here ya go:\n\nhttp://jpopqueens.tumblr.com/\n\nThere's 8 pages of songs so just click through with the little button on the side to listen to all of them. They're uploaded in reverse chronological order of their release.\n\n(P.S. - Do you guys like the background I picked? hehe....)\n\nRe: Ayumi Hamasaki: In London for a month/New album 2012\n\nI'm actually shaken up by this news. She's my role model and she has a special place in my heart, I'm so sad for her! I'm sure she'll stay strong though, she is one of the strongest people I know. Whatever she does, she will continue to inspire me and give me strength. I know this sounds so dramatic but she's been there for me through stuff, y'know. Blasting 'M' right now!\n\nBeginnings come at random, but the ending always has a reason.\n\nRe: Ayumi Hamasaki: In London for a month/New album 2012\n\nTranslated message from her website:\n\nTA - To my overseas fans,\n\nI wish to inform you that I, Ayumi Hamasaki, instructed my lawyer today to file for divorce on my behalf in the United States.\n\nAt the time of our marriage, my husband and I decided to live in the United States. However, approximately two months later eastern Japan was struck by a huge earthquake. As a result of this tragedy, I felt an overwhelming need to stay in my home county, and was forced to leave my husband alone for a long time.\n\nMy husband and I have made every effort to reach a compromise; however, as time has passed we have grown apart. I no longer feel the same desire to move to the United States. Instead, I feel that I must ask myself what I can continue to do for my country, here in Japan. This has eclipsed the future I had originally envisaged with my husband, and it is for this reason that I have made this difficult decision.\n\nIt was with a grateful, but heavy heart that I read all the messages I received from my fans and the press congratulating me on my 1st wedding anniversary at the beginning of this month. It was then that I realized I had to face up to the inevitable truth that I had been avoiding.\n\nAt present, my husband is in Los Angeles pursuing his career as an actor in Hollywood. I would ask that my fans to respect his privacy and refrain from sending him messages or contacting him to ask for comment.\n\nThank you for your cooperation and understanding."
