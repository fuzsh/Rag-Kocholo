        "text": "Hello everyone! I’m Yuliana and even though I’ve been a member of the RE:me team ever since it was created, this is my first review here. I hope you enjoy it!\n\nI’m going to review “Feel the love / Merry-go-round” by Ayumi Hamasaki, released on 10.12.2013 digitally and on 25.12.2013 physically. This is Ayumi’s 51th single, which makes it the first physical single since L that was released three years ago. It was released in 6 different versions:\n\nCD only\n\nCD+DVD\n\nCD+DVD (TeamAyu fanclub limited edition)\n\nMUSIC CARD Feel the love / Merry-go-round ver.\n\nMUSIC CARD ayupan Xmas ver. (includes an ayupan Christmas cartoon)\n\nMUSIC CARD ayupan New Year ver. (includes an ayupan New Year cartoon)\n\nCD tracklist:\n\n01. Feel the love (Original mix)\n\n02. Merry-go-round (Original mix)\n\n03. Feel the love (DJ Hello Kitty remix)\n\n04. Feel the love (Blasterjaxx remix)\n\n05. Feel the love (Original mix -Instrumental-)\n\n06. Merry-go-round (Original mix -Instrumental-)\n\nDVD tracklist:\n\n01. Feel the love (video clip)\n\n02. Merry-go-round (video clip)\n\n03. A interview *TA ver. only\n\nThis single consists of dance songs. However, as anything else Mrs. Hamasaki (yes, “Mrs.” was intentional) does, they’re not some soulless generic EDM, but have the special Ayu touch in my opinion. Some might disagree with me, though. The main topic of both songs is love, but the message is different. This will be discussed more in details further.\n\nFeel the love\n\nThis is an uplifting song about being optimistic, looking forward to the future no matter how sad the past can be and keeping looking for true love despite others judging you. At least this is how I interpret it. I also believe that it can be viewed as Ayumi’s response to all haters and fans that judge her love life, i.e. shotgun wedding and divorce with Manuel Schwarz, dating her dancer Maro and now the engagement with an 25 y.o. Amercian student.\n\nThis is a dance song, which would be very good for parties. It was composed by Tetsuya Komuro and produced by DJ Hello Kitty. Jarzu, as well as quite a few other fans, has mentioned in his review that Feel the love is a “house dance track”. I can’t comment on that because I’m not very proficient in music genres.\n\nThe majority of the lyrics is in Japanese, but the chorus is completely in English. While her accent is not perfect, I will disagree with Jarzu and say that her English is very good in this song. I personally didn’t have any difficulty understanding what she sang and everything made sense. It also makes the song much catchier.\n\nFeel the love has a tie-up with an H.I.S. Christmas Fair CM and is also a CDTV opening theme for December/January.\n\nMerry-go-round\n\nWhile it is still pretty upbeat, this song has a more mysterious and bittersweet feel to it especially in the beginning. The verses can be described as mid-tempo (or at least it is slower than an average dance track), but then the rap part sung by Verbal kicks in and the song gets faster and more dance-y.\n\nAs for the lyrics, they are telling about a past relationship. A person who you used to love is not with you anymore. You fell in love very fast, but you split apart just as suddenly. You’re trying to move on, but you still miss him/her. And even though you know that you won’t be together any more, you still hope that you will see this person again someday.\n\nThere are barely any English lyrics in the song, and all of them are sung by Verbal. The pronunciation is good and English fits in the lyrics very well. While “No, it don’t matter now” irks me because it would’ve been more grammatically correct to use “doesn’t”, it is often used in spoken American English, especially in songs, so I can’t judge that.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this single a lot. I got addicted to “Feel the love” as soon as the very first preview came out and I couldn’t get the chorus out of my head for a really long time. I wasn’t as impressed with Merry-go-round at first when I listened to the preview (even though I still liked it), but it grew on me very fast. And after reading the translation and watching the full PV I fell in love with this track as well. I wouldn’t call this a musical masterpiece: both songs have quite simple arrangements with almost no real instruments, but the single is still very enjoyable. Even though some might say that it is a generic soulless EDM release, I personally disagree with this opinion. Both songs bring out certain emotions for me, which I find the most important thing in music, especially in Ayumi’s case. And she didn’t fail this, just as usual, so I’m extremely satisfied with this single. I even liked both remixes even though I normally don’t listen to remixes much.\n\nRating: 5/5"
