        "text": "Congratulations to Ayumi Hamasaki who got married on January 1st in Las Vegas to an Austrian actor named Manuel Schwarz. Now whilst I congratulate her, I’m actually questioning the wisdom behind this marriage as they barely know each other and haven’t really properly dated. Ayu met Manuel in August 2010 when he played her husband in the PV for Virgin Road. They began ‘dating’ and kept in touch by emailing and phone calls. 4 months later they decide to marry – if she’s not pregnant, why rush into things? The funny thing about this marriage is they won’t even live with each other – both will be on opposite sides of the world. Ayu has stated she’s going to be travelling a lot between Japan and the US to see her husband. I’d like Ayu to be happy but I’m giving this marriage 12 months at best before they’ll be an announcement that a divorce is on the cards. A long distance marriage won’t work.\n\nIt’s time to look back at what was the best J-pop album released in 2009. For me, these are the pick of the bunch:\n\nSWEET BLACK feat Maki Goto. It was a fantastic return for Gocchin and this album really rocks.\n\nStereopony – A Hydrangea Blooms. Debutants Stereopony burst onto the J-pop scene with a couple of great singles and the album delivered too.\n\nNana Mizuki – Ultimate Diamond\n\nMiliyah Kato – Ring\n\nAyumi Hamasaki – Next Level. Ayu’s new album continued her fine tradition of producing a solid album full of top tunes.\n\nKoda Kumi – Trick. Kumi came out with a brilliant new album. Actually this nearly came to be the best album of the year but as you’ll see somebody else pipped her to the title.\n\nAira Mitsuki – Plastic\n\nAyaka Ikio – Gossip. I was browsing through HMV in Center Gai, Shibuya during my holiday there in the Summer when I discovered this young woman.\n\nScandal – Best Scandal. Scandal just keeps getting better in my opinion. 2009 saw them releasing some great songs.\n\nHitomi – Love Life 2\n\nMichi – Up To You. British born Michi debuted in 2008 with Promise and in 2009 came out with the superb Change The World single. Her 2nd album came out in September which contained the singles Kiss Kiss xxx and You.\n\nNamie Amuro – Past < Future. As 2009 came to an end, Namie came out with her new album mid December which had some excellent tracks on it such as her single Wild.\n\nSo if none of them came out on top, which album was my favorite of the year?\n\nPerfume – Triangle. The 3rd and much anticipated album from Perfume has to be the best one for me as it contains my favorite song Dream Fighter plus Love The World, Edge and One Room Disco.\n\nThis is a live version of the song Night Flight which is also on the Triangle album.\n\nHaving watched Kngdmhrts55’s Top 200 J-pop PV’s (Part 2 of the Youtube videos coming up soon) I thought I’d make my own favorite Top 100 J-pop song countdown. Some of the songs are album tracks only (I’ll put an asterisk by the song title to differentiate from those that have been released as singles). It’s quite a varied list with idol groups, boybands, rock groups and so forth all featuring in it. So here we go with my all time fav J-pop songs starting with:\n\n100: Morning Musume – Kanashimi Twilight\n\n99: Yousui Inoue – Shonen Jidai\n\n98: Yamashita Tomohisa – Daite Senorita\n\n97: Aimmy – Blue Vibration\n\n96: AKB48 – Iiwake Maybe\n\n95: Sawa – Stars\n\n94: L’arc En Ciel – Forbidden Lover\n\n93: Thyme – Hello\n\n92: Perfume – GAME\n\n91: Mai Kuraki – Never Gonna Give You Up\n\n90: Southern All Stars – I Am Your Singer\n\n89: Exile – Fly Away\n\n88: Yui – Cherry\n\n87: Stereopony – Namida no Mukou\n\n86: Exile – Fireworks\n\n85: Wink – Ai Ga Tomaranai\n\n84: SweetS – Sky\n\n83: L’arc En Ciel – Driver’s High\n\n82: X-Japan – Tears\n\n81: Miho Fukuhara – Love!Winter Song\n\n80: KAT-TUN – Keep The Faith\n\n79: Dreams Come True – Sono Sake E\n\n78: Perfume – Electro World\n\n77: Rina Aiuchi – Navy Blue\n\n76: L’arc En Ciel – My Heart Draws A Dream\n\n75: Namie Amuro – Do Me More *\n\n74: Hyde – The Cape Of Storms\n\n73: Ami Suzuki – Potential Break Up Song\n\n72: Meisa Kuroki – Shock ~Unmei~\n\n71: UVERworld – Shamrock\n\n70: RSP – A Street Story\n\n69: Rie Tanaka – Fields Of Hope\n\n68: angela – Dear My Best Friend *\n\n67: Momoi Haruka – Mail Me\n\n66: The Possible – Shiawase no Katachi\n\n65: Perfume – Polyrhythm\n\n64: NEWS – Bambina\n\n63: My Little Lover – Otono nai Sekai\n\n62: Hitomi Shimatani – Camellia\n\n61: Olivia – Starless Night\n\n60: NEWS – Summer Time\n\n59: Dreams Come True – Goodbye My School Days\n\n58: alan – Sora Uta\n\n57: Buck Tick – Heaven\n\n56: Perfume – Take Me Take Me *\n\n55: Ai Otsuka – Yumekui\n\n54: marino – Flavor\n\n53: Maki Goto ft Sweet Black – Lady Rise\n\n52: Ayumi Hamasaki – Fairyland\n\n51: Koda Kumi – Taboo\n\n50: Aiko – Kabutomushi\n\n49: Hikaru Utada – Take 5 *\n\n48: Shuuchushin – Yowamushi Santa\n\n47: M.O.V.E – Romancing Train\n\n46: Chihiro Onitsuka – Memai\n\n45: Angela Aki – Tegami\n\n44: Tokio – Sorafune\n\n43: Lindberg – Believe In Love\n\n42: Yui – My Generation\n\n41: The Brilliant Green – Kuroi Tsubasa *\n\n40: Namie Amuro – Rock Steady\n\n39: Koda Kumi – No Tricks *\n\n38: Jasmine – Sad To Say\n\n37: Miki Fujimoto – Okitegami\n\n36: M.O.V.E – Dogfight\n\n35: MiCHi – Promise\n\n34: Takashi Sorimachi – Poison\n\n33: AKB48 – River\n\n32: K – Almost Human\n\n31: Erika Sawajiri – Free\n\n30: Ayumi Hamasaki – Days\n\n29: Yui – Tomorrow’s Way *\n\n28: Kotoko – We Survive\n\n27: Hikaru Utada – Passion\n\n26: Scandal – Space Ranger\n\n25: Namie Amuro/Double – Black Diamond\n\n24: Hikaru Utada – Prisoner Of Love\n\n23: Mr Children – Hanabi\n\n22: Dream – I Love Dream World\n\n21: Koda Kumi – Freaky\n\n20: Nana Mizuki – Heaven Knows\n\n19: MiCHi – Change The World\n\n18: AKB48 – Sakura no Hanabiratachi\n\n17: Perfume – Secret Secret\n\n16: Acid Black Cherry – Nemure Hime\n\n15: Mika Nakashima – Glamorous Sky\n\n14: Perfume x Momoi Haruko – Akihabalove *\n\n13: Ami Suzuki – True *\n\n12: D.D.D – Heart\n\n11: Zone – Secret Base\n\n10: Namie Amuro – Baby Don’t Cry\n\n9: Erika Sawajiri – Destination Nowhere\n\n8: Yuna Ito – Brand New World\n\n7: hitomi – Wish\n\n6: Yumi Matsutoya – Hello My Friend\n\n5: Hikaru Utada – Flavor Of Life\n\n4: Lindberg – Mine *\n\n3: Soulja feat Thelma Aoyoma – Koko ni Iruya\n\n2: Hikaru Utada – Heart Station\n\n1: Perfume – Dream Fighter\n\nYes, Perfume are at no.1 with Dream Fighter. I adore the song, listened to it so many times and I don’t think Perfume will ever top that song with whatever they release in the future.\n\nFeel free to tell me what you think about the countdown.\n\nCame across this video today of the Top 20 females that Japanese guys would like as their lover. A very strange selection in the Top 10 and what the hell is Koharu Kusumi doing in it!! Eri Kamei and even JunJun are prettier than her. There is no way in hell she’s more desirable than those ranked 11 – 20. I’m surprised that Kashiyuka and A-Chan from Perfume don’t make the list. If I had my way there’d be a spot for Maki Goto, May from Sweet Vacation and several girls from AKB48.\n\n1 Ayumi Hamasaki\n\n2 YUI\n\n3 Takahashi Ai (Morning Musume).\n\n4 Nakagawa Shoko\n\n5 Reina Tanaka (Morning Musume).\n\n6 Kaori Mochida\n\n7 Amuro Namie\n\n8 Kawashima Ai\n\n9 Nocchi (Perfume)\n\n10 Koharu Kusumi (Morning Musume).\n\n11 Aiko\n\n12 Kiyoe Yoshioka (Ikimono Gakari)\n\n13 Ai Otsuka\n\n14 Yui Aragaki\n\n15 Chisa (GIRL NEXT DOOR)\n\n16 Kimura Kaera\n\n17 Koda Kumi\n\n18 BoA\n\n19 Mizuki Nana\n\n20 Ayaka\n\nEDIT: Sony have taken the video down from Youtube. Sorry bout that.\n\nIn this post I’ll give you the release dates of notable singles/albums of artists that you might be interested in purchasing/downloading right up to the middle of April:\n\n25th February:\n\nAyumi Hamasaki’s double A-side single Rule/Sparkle comes out next week which is sure to be a big seller and go straight to No.1. On the same day the excellent Ami Suzuki releases her new single Reincarnation, Ai Otsuka with Bye Bye and misono who’s inconsistent at best with her songs releases her latest one Kyuukon. On the album side Tomoke Kawase releases 2 best of CD’s for her alter egos Tommy February6 and Tommy Heavenly6 named Strawberry Cream Soda Pop “Daydream” and Gothic Melting Ice Cream’s Darkness “Nightmare”. Quite a mouthful aren’t they!!\n\n4th March:\n\nThe underrated Chinese female soloist alan finally releases her debut album called Voice of EARTH. I’m really looking forward to this one. I’ve no idea why she’s overlooked by Japanese music fans. Also coming out will be the first collaboration between siblings Koda Kumi and misono with their song It’s All Love plus AKB48 release 10 Nen Sakura. Hope that does as well as their last song Oogoe Diamond.\n\n9th March:\n\nAKB48 sub-unit No Sleeves release their 2nd single Tane.\n\n14th March:\n\nHikaru Utada’s 2nd English album called This Is The One comes out. It’ll be interesting to see how this one fares in the US as Exodus bombed big style over there. I like her song Come Back To Me. I’m expecting good things from this album just as long as she doesn’t abandon the style that made Heart Station such a success.\n\n18th March:\n\nPlenty of good music coming out on this date including BoA’s Best&USA album plus another album simply called BoA. I think this is released on the 17th. An artist that I’ve started to get into lately Saori@destiny brings out her mini-album WOW WAR TECHNO. Morning Musume’s album Platinum 9 Disc also comes out. On the single side of things the highly anticipated new single by Namie Amuro called Wild/Dr will be released. I really like Namie so I can’t wait for this single from her.\n\n25th March:\n\nThe big release for me this week is Perfume’s 14th single One Room Disco. I’m waiting in anticipation for the preview and PV to this song. Gackt’s latest song which is also the OP for tokusatsu TV show Kamen Rider Decade called Journey Through The Decade also comes out plus Ayumi Hamasaki’s 12th album NEXT LEVEL. That should be great. One of my favorites from old skool Morning Musume – Mari Yaguchi releases her single which I mentioned sometime ago called Seishun Boku. In addition to the above, Koda Kumi gives us a double whammy with 2 CD’s – one’s a remix album called Koda Kumi’s Driving Hits and the other is a compilation called Out Work & Collaborations Best. My wallet is going to be hit hard on this date!!!\n\nApril 8th:\n\nalan comes out with yet another new single Kuon na Kawa\n\nApril 15th\n\nThe brilliant Girl Next Door after a busy end to 2008 with 4 singles and an album release their newest single Seeds of Dream. I really enjoyed their debut album.\n\nIMO 2008 was a vintage year for great J-pop music and this year many top albums were released. The candidate for best J-pop album depends on the individual – each person has different tastes. These were the ones I enjoyed the most:\n\nHikaru Utada – Heart Station\n\nPerfume – Game\n\nGirl Next Door – Girl Next Door\n\nKoda Kumi – Kingdom\n\nNamie Amuro – Best Fiction\n\nAyumi Hamasaki – A Complete~All Singles\n\nbut for me the best album to be released in 2008 is one which I listened to just this week and it’s Ami Suzuki’s Supreme Show. I’ve always thought that Perfume were the masters of electro-pop but I was wrong. Ami’s album blows Perfume’s Game out of the water. I can’t seem to find any weak songs on Ami’s album, they’re all killer tracks. It’s a shame the Japanese public don’t agree with me as just under 14k has been sold. This album deserved to sell a hell of a lot more than what it did. My favorite songs are TEN and TRUE – 2 fantastic tracks guaranteed to get everybody on the dance floor. Below you’ll find a video from Youtube with a melody of songs from the album. Enjoy.\n\nLet’s hear from you which album you considered to be the best last year."
