        "text": "Today I stumbled upon this awesome company who makes pampering products fun!!!\n\nWhat you‚Äôre seeing above isn‚Äôt the Really ice-cream, they are luxurious bath bombs for pedicures!! Aren‚Äôt they cool? Besides ice-cream bath bombs, Me! bath also has body icings and Ice Cream Sandwich callous treatment! All of their products are fat free and awesome!! Makes me happy just looking at the products üôÇ I can‚Äôt wait till my shipment comes so that I can pamper my clients even more.^-^\n\nSome of you may know by reading my blog that I have an obsession for things that look like real food. Think it all started when I first laid my eyes on a display of crepes in Japan!\n\nFrom appetizers to main course, sushi to dessert. All of the hand crafted works of art looks nothing artificial at all. I really want to travel back to Japan and take some classes and learn how it is made‚ô•\n\nThanks for reading! Till next time ‚ô•\n\nMy favorite shopping center in Japan! Shibuya 109.\n\nI have only been there once, but I won‚Äôt forget how busy it was and how cool the things were!! This mall has tons of little shops. You can never get bored here!! (Well, unless you‚Äôre the dad‚Ä¶you know, who has to wait and pay for everything? haha )\n\nThis mall has it all! Nails, hair, clothes, more clothes and shoes shoes shoes!!! Shop till you drop girlfriends!!\n\nMost of their store names are in English, so it shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to find the second time you go. Out of all the stores though, this name stood out:\n\nHaha, someone loves them so much they named their store after them.\n\nHopefully soon, I can have my own store üôÇ Bring the Japanesey to wherever I am‚ô•\n\nOn January 1st 2011, Hamasaki Ayumi has announced that she is getting married on her fan club site ‚ÄúTeamAyu.‚Äù According to the announcement on ‚ÄúTeamAyu‚Äù, her groom is Austrian actor, Manuel Schwarz who Ayu co-stared with in her PV‚Äôs for ‚ÄúVirgin Road‚Äú, ‚ÄúLast angel‚Äú, and ‚ÄúLove song.‚Äù\n\nTheir first encounter was during the shoot for ‚ÄúVirgin Road‚Äù held in L.A in August 2010, and Manuel appeared in her PV as Ayu‚Äôs husband. They met again at the shoot for ‚ÄúLast angel‚Äù and ‚ÄúLove song‚Äù, but it seems like they kept in touch with each other through emails and phone calls.\n\nAyu wrote, ‚ÄúI, Hamasaki Ayumi, met irreplaceable love, as a human being, and as a female. I am sure that we are at the closest place as eternity. Many who was my husband in the PV for ‚ÄòVirgin Road‚Äô, will be my husband in my real life!!!!!‚Äù\n\nAccording to her agency, they will register their marriage sometime soon, and Ayu is not pregnant. At this moment, there has not been any information about her future activities.\n\n‚ô•I‚Äôve always thought that Ayu would have the wedding of the century, kinda of a shocker to me for her getting married in Vegas. Anyhow, congratulations Ayu. Best of luck on your long-distance marriage.\n\n‚ô• How do you feel about this?\n\nWrite them all down below!\n\nHello there üòÄ I have just figured out the difference between WordPress.com/ WordPress.org~\n\nHaven‚Äôt done too much today, just turned on Big Bang Theory and let it play at the background while I blabb on the net~ haha. Some reason playing these DVDs in the background makes me feel smarter, haha.\n\nToday‚Äôs weather doesn‚Äôt look too good. The lack of sunshine is kinda bringing my mood down~ So I brewed some Premium Fair Trade coffee to lift my spirits up^-^ (Least that‚Äôs what it says on the packaging) I placed it on the side of my laptop and let my fingers fly, type-type-typing away on the keyboard.\n\nHalloween\n\nHow is everyone doing? Are you hung over chocolate like me? lol\n\nI went trick-or-treating this year, and trust me I wasn‚Äôt expecting much from it~ I know I‚Äôm too old for it~haha. Surprisingly we got quite a few candies! One of the houses we went to was so enthused about Halloween, not only they decorated the whole yard of the house, they had an open house for everyone to go inside to decorate cookies!!! I am truly amazed! You should have seen the faces on the trick-or-treaters üòÄ !!! When I have my own house, I shall do the same and bring happiness to the world ^-^\n\nWell that is all I have today my friends! Till next time~"
