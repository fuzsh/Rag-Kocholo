        "text": "J-pop superstar Ayumi Hamasaki has announced that she has given birth to her first child – despite her fans not knowing she was pregnant.\n\nThe 41-year-old confirmed the happy surprise with a post on her Team Ayu fanclub website, informing subscribers that she welcomed a baby at the ‘end of last year’.\n\nIn the post shared on 1 January, Hamasaki wrote: ‘I’d like you all to all to know that I gave birth to a beautiful angel last year. I’m still trying to juggle everything and not always managing it, but I would be so happy of you could support me and give me the time and space to do my best.\n\n‘I’m always grateful for your understanding for someone like me. Thank you so much! I now have even more respect for all mothers out there so much, starting with my own.’\n\nThe Poker Face singer’s fans are delighted with the news – but were also baffled as Hamasaki has been touring pretty solidly for the past year.\n\nShe even performed her traditional Countdown Live show on New Year’s Eve, and is going back on the road in February for the last leg of her Trouble tour.\n\nIt is unclear if Hamasaki is raising her baby with a partner, although many fans have speculated that she welcomed her child with dancer Junaki Araki, who is 21 years her junior.\n\nHamasaki has been married twice before – the ‘Empress of J-pop’ was first married to Austrian model Manuel Schwarz, who she met on the set of her Virgin Road video in August 2010 and tied the knot with five months later.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B6x1FMMBv8D/\n\nHowever, they split a year later after the popstar decided not to leave Japan for the United States.\n\nIn December 2013, Hamasaki got engaged to an American medical student 10 years her junior, and got married in March 2014 – but in September 2016, they had finalised their divorce.\n\nHamasaki is one of the biggest selling Japanese artists ever, thanks to songs including Boys & Girls, Endless Sorrow, Seasons, Sparkle and Crossroad.\n\nMORE : Gail Porter ‘quite likes’ being bald after losing hair to alopecia"
