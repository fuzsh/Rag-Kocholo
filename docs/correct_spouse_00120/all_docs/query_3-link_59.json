        "text": "Picture this: a girl frantically buying Valentine’s chocolates to give to her boss, male colleagues, classmates and male friends. Sounds weird? Not in Japan!\n\nIt is not an uncommon sight in Japan every year on Valentine’s Day. Women actually give out chocolates to the men in their lives. This was a marketing ploy developed by the confectionary industry to boost sales, and suffice to say, they have been very successful. Their sales shoot up during this ‘special’ time of the year.\n\nThere are two types of chocolates girls give out on V-day:\n\n義理チョコ (Giri-choko) – obligatory gift chocolates; usually given to superiors, colleagues, classmates and other male acquaintances. “Giri” is a very Japanese concept.\n\n本命チョコ (Honmei-choko) – “true love” chocolates; given to boyfriends together with something expensive like neck tie\n\nOn March 14th, White Day, men are supposed to return the favor by giving back to the women who ‘remembered’ them with chocolates on Valentine’s Day.\n\nGirls, why don’t you try this out this year? I know I will. I can guilt-trip my male teammates to giving me chocolates when March 14 comes around!\n\nA Japanese reporter went to Bangkok to cover the protests and elections, but probably did not expect being on the news himself.\n\nOn 2 February 2014, Thailand went to the polls to elect a new parliament amidst the ongoing political crisis involving the Thaksin administration.\n\nHowever, a Japanese reporter described in social media as “handsome”, “mouthwatering” and “yummy” has stolen the limelight. His name is Enami Daijiro, a 28-year-old reported from the Fuji TV Network covering the protests and elections.\n\nHe was covering the election in the district of Bung Kum, where caretaker Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra cast her vote. He has also interviewed protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban. His videos and pictures soon spread like wildfire on the internet.\n\nAccording to Thai Rath, Enami was born in Kanagawa Prefecture on 30 September 1985. He was in baseball club in high school and joined the swimming club when he was in university. He finished public law at Keio University. His hobbies include swimming, mountaineering and bowling. He has made several appearances in Japanese TV doramas like Ninkyo Helper and Room of King. He is 180 cm tall and his blood type is O. The Thai Rath report did not say if Enami is single or married.\n\nMy friend pointed to a news article online that Pinoys would be exempted from having a visa for a 15-day maximum stay in Japan. This is the link:\n\nhttp://www.worldbulletin.net/?aType=…ticleID=111902\n\n[Update: They rectified the error.]\n\nI thought that was strange since Japan just issued Pinoys a multiple-entry visa grant last 25 June 2013 which is last Tuesday. Announcing a new and significant policy two days later is not something you hear normally. Thus, I went to the Embassy website of Japan and they have confirmed that the news is false:\n\nhttp://www.ph.emb-japan.go.jp/pressa…mpt_false.html\n\nIn spite of that, we now have the multiple entry visa which is already a good news. You can stay at most 15 days and the visa is valid for three years. They made this policy to encourage more travellers in their country. For some, it is like having that Hong Kong or Singapore feeling that it is easy to go any time since applying at the embassy gives us a deterrent not to travel to Japan.\n\nWould this new policy encourage Pinoys to do a TNT?\n\nI have seen comments online that giving Pinoys multiple-entry visas would encourage them not to return and become an undocumented alien. This is not exactly true because a Pinoy who has the intention not to return does not really need a multiple visa. In the first instance of entering Japan with a single-entry visa one would not go back anymore. It is foolish to go there once, return to the Philippines, travel to Japan the second time then not return.\n\nThis issuance of multiple entries is long due I think. I have seen legitimate Pinoys who have had Japan visas in virtually every page of their passports and cannot apply multiple-entry because of the old rules. It looked like they were collecting those print-club stickers you find in game centres. They looked so messy. Good thing they do not need to apply multiple times anymore. Along with Vietnam, this new rule starts at 1 July 2013. Indonesia will enjoy a 30-day stay from 15-day for their multiple-entry visa starting from the same date too.\n\nWhy can’t we be visa-free?\n\nIn ASEAN, only Thailand and Malaysia will be visa-free starting 1 July. Malaysians can stay up to three consecutive months while the Thais can stay up to 15 consecutive days. It is evident that Japan wants to lure ASEAN tourists to pump up its economy as Chinese tourists are scarce because of the territorial dispute in the Senkaku Islands known in Japan or the Diaoyu in China.\n\nThe visa requirements limit foreigners to come to a country because there are a significant number of undocumented aliens (i.e., TNT) historically. Visas are not really imposed against citizens of relatively poorer countries. It is just that immigration has noticed that citizens of that country who are coming in are not equal to those who should be going out. Therefore, for Pinoys to be visa-free there should be little or no TNTs in Japan. I think that can only happen if Pinoys are comfortable to stay in the Philippines because of a stable job which is also indicative of a strong economy.\n\nOpen house 2007- Japinoy members in Kimono\n\n(The Kanji above reads: Huge Success)\n\nWoohoo! This year’s Open House of the Nihongo Center/PIJLC was the best ever! Since the first time I attended the Open House in 2004, this is the first time I encountered such a big crowd at school. Tons of activities for the visitors too like Origami, aikido, sumo (!), film showing, kimono no kitsuke (kimono wearing), free Nihongo class, trivia contest, karaoke contest, cosplay contest and many more.\n\nAbove is a pic of moeru-san and hirodayuy-san (both Japinoy.com members) in their yukata (summer kimono). Looking good, guys! Mr. and Mrs. Yakuza? But something is missing in this pic…Oh, right. Falling hearts. Oh-kay, moving on… I wasn’t able to go around much to the different rooms and activities (or even watch ‘Howl’s Moving Castle) because Keli-sensei asked me to assist with the Kimono room, which I gladly did. The last time I wore a yukata was December last year, for the company’s Christmas party, and all I could remember was how to tie an obi (Not Wan Kenobi) in the ‘chou musubi’ style (butterfly obi, which in my opinion, looks more of a ribbon than a butterfly). There are so many other ways of tying an obi, but I never bothered to learn all of them. At the Open House, there were also the ‘instant obi’, those that you just clip on the back. Convenient. ^_^\n\nRead More…"
