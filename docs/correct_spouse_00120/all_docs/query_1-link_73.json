        "text": "The official fan club of Ayumi Hamasaki announced on Friday that the 35-year-old singer is engaged to a 25-year-old male medical student at the University of California, Los Angeles. She added to her fans, “As my partner is an ordinary student, I would be very happy if you could watch over us quietly.”\n\nThe couple had gotten engaged on Thursday. According to a source linked to Hamasaki, she is not pregnant. The two had met during the New Year’s holidays through a friend, and began dating around spring.\n\nHamasaki had told fans that she had married Manuel Schwarz, an Austrian actor living in America, in Las Vegas on January 1, 2011 (about four months after meeting him). However, she announced a year later in January 2012 that she had gotten divorced. Hamasaki had not registered her marriage with Schwarz in Japan, so her upcoming marriage with the medical student would be considered her first in Japan.\n\nHamasaki is also writing and singing the “Pray” theme song for Buddha 2: Tezuka Osamu no Buddha ~Owarinaki Tabi~, the second film in the planned trilogy based on the late Osamu Tezuka‘s Buddha manga. It will be Hamasaki’s first theme song for an anime film since her “No More Words” song for Inuyasha the Movie: Affections Touching Across Time in 2001, and only her seventh theme song for any film, live-action or anime.\n\nHamasaki contributed theme songs to the Inuyasha television anime series, the live-action film SHINOBI – Heart Under Blade, and the live-action Dragonball: Evolution film.\n\nShe played Yuri Sakazaki in the original anime video Art of Fighting (Battle Spirits Ryuko no Ken), and her “Connected” song inspired an animated music video\n\nCheck out this link:"
