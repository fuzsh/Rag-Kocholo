        "text": "Manuel Schwarz\n\nAustria’s (and now Japan’s) Favorite Son\n\nHe’s married to one of Japan’s most famous pop stars, Ayumi Hamasaki. His face has graced the pages of countless magazines. He’s got a body that has literally stopped traffic. Still, model/actor/musician Manuel Schwarz has managed to take it all in stride. The Austrian-born talent recently sat down with The March Issue to discuss marriage, life as a celebrity and his latest venture–a gorgeous and rousing coffee table book shot by renowned fashion and entertainment photographer, Leslie Kee.\n\n“It was great,” says Schwarz (of the experience), in his Los Angeles apartment. “[Leslie] was definitely one of the most professional photographers I’ve ever worked with. We shot this whole book in a very short period of time.”\n\nThe book titled ‘Super Manuel’ is a project developed by Kee to showcase the Zeitgeist of fame and fashion in the modern age. Only a small handful of the world’s most glamorous monikers have been invited to participate in the endeavor. Schwarz was one of those rare names.\n\n“There’s eight books total in the series,” he notes. One of them is about Lady Gaga.”\n\nSchwarz reaches across the table and picks up the book and we thumb through it. Image after image is a testament to the model/actor’s hard work and–let’s face it–rocking good looks. There’s something for everyone in the book which was conceptualized as a gift to Schwarz’s wife, Hamasaki.\n\n“We shot in the studio. We shot at the beach. We shot in a hotel,” he says. “The book also features some of my favorite song lyrics.”\n\nThe project has also been well-received by Kee’s core fans, which is evident from its release in late 2011. The venue where the book was debuted was deluged by gawkers angling for a first-glimpse of the series.\n\n“The gallery opening was in Tokyo about a month ago or so. Eight hundred people showed up at the gallery,” says Schwarz, beaming.\n\nJapanese audiences have developed a fascination with Schwarz that stems largely from his marital union.\n\n“[My marriage has brought] a lot of change, of course. It’s a different way of living and a different way of traveling, especially in the Asian countries–especially in Japan. We can’t just go into a coffee shop and hang out. [Ayumi] has too many fans for that.”\n\nFunny thing is, so does Schwarz. In just a few short years, this former face of fashion lines like Von Dutch, Ed Hardy and Levi’s has gone from a virtual unknown to one of the most Googled male models working today. His twitter page boasts fans in the tens of thousands. As well, he has also been interviewed by countless news and media outlets in his wife’s country Japan as well as stateside. To date, one of his greatest professional accomplishments came when, in 2010, he appeared in the first spot for retail outlet Target’s “Life’s a Moving Target” campaign.\n\nBut don’t think this ambitious young man is content with where his career currently lies. He’s got his eyes set on loftier goals:\n\n“Right now, I’m focused more on acting,” he says confidently."
