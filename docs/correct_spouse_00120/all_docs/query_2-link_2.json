        "text": "Japanese pop princess Ayumi Hamasaki is to divorce her Austrian actor husband Manuel Schwarz after just a year of marriage, local media reported Tuesday. Hamasaki, 33, and Schwarz, 31, married on January 1 last year, and she had planned to move to the United States to live with her husband, according to news reports. But Hamasaki, better known as \"Ayu\" by her large fanbase in Asia, began to have second thoughts about leaving Japan after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, Kyodo News reported. Hamasaki, who met the actor in Los Angeles in August 2010 while making a promotional video for her song Virgin Road, intends to file for divorce in the United States through her lawyer, Kyodo said. The starlet, who started her career as a model and actress, became immensely popular among teenage girls -- and a not insignificant number of boys -- after making her debut as a singer in 1998. With unusually round eyes and fair hair, Hamasaki's fashions have repeatedly triggered nationwide fads, including for elaborate nail polish and large sunglasses."
