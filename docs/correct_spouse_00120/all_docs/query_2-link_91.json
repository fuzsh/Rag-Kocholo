        "text": "Shinoda Mariko (AKB48's Team A) tweeted that she had a circular loss of hair and that she was skipping an interview to see a doctor, but then it was quickly deleted. I thought it was odd, but I didn't want to jump to conclusions. I figured that if something was wrong that it would be announced sooner or later. Today, I watched a short documentary about Locks of Love. One of the girls they focused on had Alopecia. When they were talking about the first signs they said the very words 'circular loss of hair'. I'm not saying that Mariko has Alopecia, but I don't think she tweeted that on accident. I think her management had her quickly retract the statement and try to cover it up. She is a model and if something is wrong it could really damage her career. I'm going to wait till further news, but I'm prepared if there is bad news. (Again, don't jump to conclusions.)\n\nHere are the texts:\n\n“I’m at the rehearsal for ‘Kohaku’” at 9:16 a.m.\n\n“I’m gonna skip the interview, and go see a doctor.” at 1:59 p.m.\n\n“I’m going to the hospital now. I got a circular loss of hair.” at 2:25 p.m. → deleted\n\n“I tweeted by accident…” at 2:30 p.m.\n\n“I was just kidding.” at 2:34 p.m.\n\n“I’m going back to the rehearsal now. It’s gonna be a long day today.” at 2:57 p.m.\n\nOn other news tidbits there are two big stars possibly getting married. There is a rumor that Mari Yaguchi is marrying her boyfriend. Ayumi Hamasaki announced on her fan-club website that she will be marrying Austrian actor, Manuel Schwarz.\n\nSKE48's Team E's first stage will premiere on January 16th. Team KII's third stage will start on February 13th. Oh by the way, NMB48's Team N's first stage will be performed today."
