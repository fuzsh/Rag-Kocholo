        "text": "Singer Ayumi Hamasaki (35) recently announced news of her engagement to a 25 year-old American on her fansite. The fiance in question is a student of ULCA medical school in California. According to sources, the marriage application has already been completed in Los Angeles, but the singer herself claims she is “engaged”. In her previous marriage to Austrian actor Manuel Schwarz, it was revealed that she had not officially registered the marriage and so was therefore “single” throughout. People in the industry are speculating if she’s really getting married this time, or whether it’s simply a ploy to create fanfare.\n\nAccording to people related to Ayumi, she was introduced to her fiance in January this year, and they started dating in spring. Ayumi is currently residing in Los Angeles for work. As she has gotten engaged, she’s also received the “Fiancee Visa”(a permit which allows the fiance/fiancee to reside long term in the U.S) . As she wanted her fans to know as soon as possible, she revealed the news on her fansite.\n\nAnother spokesperson revealed that pictures of her fiance was actually exposed in a female magazine in June this year.Sporting a bald cut, he seems to be the macho type. The article also talked of them spending 5 nights in a suite room costing 700,000Yen a night in Bali, Indonesia. After travelling to Bali and Korea together in June, the guy also returned to Japan with Ayumi for her concerts, where he stayed in Ayumi’s residence.\n\n-Skip part about unregistered marriage to Manuel Schwarz-\n\n-Skip part about failed relationship to backup dancer-\n\nAs Ayumi is releasing her new single “Feel the Love” on 25th December, the timing of this announcement is interesting enough for people to think she’s creating a buzz for her comeback."
