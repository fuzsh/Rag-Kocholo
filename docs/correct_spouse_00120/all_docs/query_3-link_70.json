She touched down at Haneda Airport, after a trip to Dubai for work-related purposes.\n\nAt the arrivals gate, ayu was under the strict guard of about 10 staff members. Dressed in black sunglasses and a white mask, she kept her head bowed throughout, and maintained silence despite questions from the press. It was only at the arrival lobby exit that she gave a slight nod to acknowledge the press.\n\nayu left Japan for Dubai on the 16th for PV filming. On the 23rd, she updated her Twitter status for the first time since the divorce, with the message “Never regret anything coz at one time it was exactly what u wanted…” typed in English.\n\nOriginal Article from here.\n\n—–\n\nayu Returns to Japan Fully Guarded… 1 Week Since Divorce Announcement\n\n24 January 2012. 05:05\n\nHamasaki Ayumi (33), who announced her divorce from Austrian actor Manuel Schwarz (31) =living in Los Angeles= on the 17th, returned to Japan on the 23rd. Although this was her first public appearance after the divorce announcement, ayu maintained her silence in response to reporters’ questions. She may have tweeted “Never regret anything”, but this “scar” seems to run deep.\n\n10:20pm. Surrounded by about 10 staff members and bodyguards, ayu was spotted at Tokyo’s Haneda Airport. Dressed in huge sunglasses, mask and a black coat with its hood up, she was “fully guarded”. There was no way of guessing her expression, but a sign of weakness could be discerned from the way she leaned heavily on the staff member beside her.\n\nIn the jostle, about 40 members of the press rapidly fired questions at ayu, “Was the divorce sucessful?” “Have you talked to him?”, but she remained silent. Her only response was to bow her head at the request “Anything to say to the fans?” Knowing how much she treasures her fans, this gesture seemed to say “Sorry for making you worry”.\n\nOn the night of 16 Jan, during her stint overseas, ayu suddenly announced her divorce from Manuel Schwarz after one year of marriage through her member-limited fanclub site. According to her office, she would continue her travels in UAE Dubai before returning to Japan via a stopover in Seoul. This was her first public appearance after the divorce announcement.\n\nAccpording to a source, ayu’s representative filed for divorce on her behalf on the 17th (Japan Time), at Las Vegas, Nevada, where they held their wedding ceremony. The paperwork may take days and so the official decision is still not out, but the divorce has already been granted. As she did not register her marriage in Japan, she still remains as “unmarried” in the local family register.\n\nayu continued to travel to other countries for work as she went through with the divorce. Though she kept her head bowed and remained silent in the arrival lobby, she updated her Twitter the previous afternoon with the message,\n\n“Never regret anything coz at one time it was exactly what u wanted…”\n\nThis was submitted along with a photo of her running into the sea. It will not be long before ayu overcomes her divorce and returns to sing to her fans with a happy voice.\n\n—–\n\nGALLERY (click for larger images)\n\nOriginal Article from here.\n\n—–\n\nBeneath the Rumors, a Question Mark on ayu’s Divorce. Doomed From the Start…?\n\n19 January 2012. 15:30\n\nOn 16 Jan, Hamasaki Ayumi’s sudden divorce announcement shook the world of entertainment.\n\nHer announcement to marry Austrian actor Manuel Schwarz, who acted with her in her own PV, came on New Year’s Day last year. With consideration to his career, her initial plan was to migrate to the US, but her need to prepare for her concert tour, starting in May, required her to stay in Japan, and then the Tohoku Earthquake Disaster struck in March, causing a strong “feeling of reluctance to leave Japan” to grow within Hamasaki. In the end, her wish to stay together with her husband was hindered by “physical distance”, which soon became “emotional distance”, and she explained that she could not “see a future in the US with my husband” anymore.\n\nOn 17 Jan, the Nevada public office in the US announced that the divorce was successful. Regarding why she announced her decision before the divorce could even be finalized, Hamasaki explained that she “had to travel overseas for work, and wished to report to the fans as early as possible”. Now, some reports are claiming that she has denied the existence of a new lover.\n\nHowever, looking at all the divorce reports, it seems like most of the inside sources are calm and composed about the whole incident. One source claimed that “actually, stories about discord and disagreements between the two have already been floating around since middle of last year”.\n\n“There were many who doubted the existence of the marriage itself. That is because she has never registered the marriage in Japan”.\n\nFurthermore, the two met on the PV set for the song “Virgin Road”. When the marriage announcement closely followed the release of this song as a single, there were rumors of the marriage being “a publicity stunt”. The same source claimed that “ayu’s CD sales has been falling over the years, and the marriage was actually to generate publicity for that marriage-themed song. When the sales did not improve, the divorce happened”.\n\nAs ayu has never registered her marriage in Japan, she has no record of divorce as well. There is talk of how “ayu actually has someone she loves in Japan, and he is the reason why she did not register this marriage”. There are many rumors as to the identity of this lover, some claiming him to be the rumored favorite, others naming him as an ordinary man who works in another industry altogether.\n\n“In any case, with this story of divorce now, her next song should be dealing with broken hearts and separation,” a journalist commented. Just what will Hamasaki do from now on?\n\nOriginal Article from here.\n\n—–\n\nHamasaki Ayumi: Behind the Divorce, Ex-Husband’s Complicated Feelings Towards Nuclear Accident\n\n19 January 2012. 16:00\n\nHamasaki Ayumi (33) announced her decision to divorce Austrian actor husband Manuel Schwarz aka Mannie (31) on her Official Fanclub site. Within the announcement message, ayu explained that she was the main reason for the divorce.\n\nAt the start of the marriage, the two had decided to “stay in the US”, but the Tohoku Earthquake Disaster occurred soon after, and a strong “feeling of reluctance to leave Japan” started to grow within ayu. In the end, Mannie was left in the US alone as the days went by.\n\nRight after their marriage a year ago, the two went on a honeymoon to the Maldives. They returned to the US and stayed in Los Angeles for a while before ayu came back to Japan alone. Soon after, the disaster happened.\n\nAfter the incident, “what (she) can do for Japan” became ayu’s future plan. An entertainment authority explains,\n\n“Firstly, the tour start date was pushed back from April to May, and ayu’s team as a whole decided to create a new show from scratch. There was a time limit of just one month, and they probably did not even have the time to eat, much less to sleep.”\n\nIn those days, ayu cut her straight shoulder-length hair into an extremely short style, a very first for her.\n\n“Through music, I want to send out all of my heart.”\n\nA simple phrase, but full of passionate feelings, just like how she always does things.\n\nOn the other hand, Mannie followed ayu through TV and Internet news reports, learning about her through Twitter, and the two became a “long-distance couple” with no reality of married life. Surely ayu did not wish for such a marriage. However, Mannie did not have a reason to visit Japan. His life is based in Los Angeles, and aside from ayu, he has no kin or friend in Japan. Furthermore, his wife was too busy with work and constantly on the move.\n\nAlso, it has been said that Mannie, as an Austrian, had complicated feelings regarding nuclear power.\n\n“Austria has a horrid past with regard to nuclear accidents due to Chernobyl, and nuclear establishments within the country are now banned by law. When the Fukushima nuclear accident occurred, the Austrian government issued notices requesting their citizens to refrain from travelling. Mannie’s family and friends must have understood the danger of nuclear power, and probably dissuaded him from going to Japan to visit his wife if he had no reason to do so.” (Entertainment Authority)\n\nOriginal Article from here.\n\n—–\n\nHamasaki Ayumi Unregistered in Japan, Responsible by Law to Report\n\n19 January 2012.\n\nEarly morning on 17 Jan, Hamasaki Ayumi (33) announced her divorce on her Official fanclub site. Her marriage to Austrian actor husband Manuel Schwarz or Mannie (31) was just in January last year…..\n\nLas Vegas in the US is known as the “Marriage Capital of the World”. As long as a passport and a marriage registration is made at the public office, even applications from foreigners can easily be approved and a marriage certificate issued. There are also drive-thru wedding ceremonies, and churches are open 24-7.\n\nOn the evening of New Year’s Day last year, ayu and Mannie registered for marriage at a public office in Las Vegas. Then, they made their way to a small chapel along Main Street. It was a place called the Little White Chapel, where Britney Spears, Bruce Willis and Michael Jordan once held their wedding ceremonies.\n\nFor the ceremony, ayu ditched the gorgeous jewellry and traditional wedding dress, opting for a casual look with a rock T-shirt and mini-skirt instead.\n\nAfter registering for marriage in Las Vegas, the two came back to Japan for a short while before flying off to the Maldives for their honeymoon. Photos from that time show ayu clinging tightly onto 180-cm tall Mannie’s arm the entire time. Everyone could see the happiness between the couple, but even then, they were not truly husband and wife.\n\n“They may have registered their marriage with the Las Vegas public office, but if the correct procedure is not followed here in Japan, we will not recognize it as a legitimate marriage. For some reason, ayu did not do it.” (Entertainment Authority)\n\nThe procedure which ayu would have needed to do was to submit her section of the family register, the original and translated copy of the Las Vegas marriage certificate, and the original and translated copy of Mannie’s birth certificate and passport to the Japan public office within 90 days of the wedding ceremony.\n\nTanaka Atsushi from the Narashino Ministry of Justice Office explains.\n\n“By law, the marriage is legitimate at the place where the ceremony is held, but if Japan receives no report, the marriage partner will not be entered into the family register. That causes one’s status to remain as unmarried. While the marriage is recognized, since the family register lists one as unmarried, one can technically still marry a third party in Japan. However, if this happens, one can be charged with bigamy since the marriage is still valid. It is one’s reponsibility by law to report such registrations; infringement can be sentenced to a fine of up to 50,000yen.\n\nOriginal Article from here.\n\n—–\n\nReason for Ayu’s Divorce? Ex-Husband’s Steamy “Surprise” Photobook\n\n18 January 2012.\n\nA current hot topic is the photobook of Hamasaki Ayumi’s (33) ex-husband, Austrian-born model Manuel Schwarz (31), released without Hamasaki’s knowledge. The contents emphasized strongly on the male body in a sexual way, and it has been said that this photobook was the trigger for the divorce.\n\nTo summarize all the details, Hamasaki announced her marriage to Schwarz on 1 Jan 2011, after acting together in a PV shoot, and the two held their wedding ceremony in the US on the same day. However, just a year later, on 16 Jan 2012, she announced their divorce. On the 17th, Hamasaki filed for divorce with the US courthouse through a lawyer, and the application was accepted.\n\nPublishing a Nude Photobook Without Permission\n\nHamasaki personally explained on her website that the reason for divorce was the Tohoku Earthquake Disaster. The disaster made her develop a strong “reluctance to leave Japan”, and “since I cannot see a future in the US with my husband”, she decided to divorce.\n\nOn the other hand, some reports claimed that another reason for the divorce was the fact that Schwarz released a photobook of himself without Hamasaki’s knowledge. In November 2011, 1,000 limited copies of the book, titled “SUPER MANUEL”, were released.\n\nThe contents of the book soon leaked onto the Internet. On the cover, Schwarz posed half-naked, with a look of yearning on his face as he looked at the camera. There were also shots of him in the sea, the water making his pants wet and emphasizing his groin area, as well as some naked shots, with bubbles covering his groin. Full of male sex appeal, it was an intense book.\n\nAsking Price of 9,000yen on Yahoo! Auctions\n\nThis book was dedicated to “my beautiful wife”, to which Hamasaki replied “My heart was gonna almost STOP! LOL” on Twitter. However, reports claimed that Hamasaki was actually upset. Although the truth remains unknown, it is surely not unreasonable to get angry should someone you love “surprise” you by publishing a nude photobook.\n\nThis book has become a hot topic online, and there were comments such as “Is hubby gay?” circulating around on 2ch and Twitter.\n\nLeslie Kee, who shot the photobook, is a famous Singaporean photographer, and had worked on CD jacket covers for artists like Hamasaki and Koda Kumi. On his official website, most of his works deal with men as his subject, and are often as extreme as what he had done for Schwarz. This is Kee’s photography style.\n\nBy the way, one copy of “SUPER MANUEL” is being auctioned on Yahoo!Auctions currently. Instead of the original price of 6,300yen, this signed copy is going for 9,000yen.\n\nIt is now 18 Jan 2012, one night after the divorce application had been accepted. Fans have been tweeting Hamasaki with messages such as “There will be many complications until the divorce procedure is complete, but please continue to progress and be ayu-chan”.\n\nOriginal Article from here.\n\n—–\n\nAyu’s Divorce! However, without entry into the family register, she is not a divorcee in Japan!\n\n18 January 2012.\n\nSinger Hamasaki Ayumi (33), who got married on New Year’s Day last year to Austrian-born actor Manuel Schwarz (31), has successfully filed for divorce through a lawyer at Nevada’s courthouse on the 17th. She is expected to be granted divorce soon. As the two did not register their marriage at the Japan public office, Hamasaki still maintains her status as unmarried. Hamasaki has left Japan for the Middle East on the 16th for work, and is expected to return at the end of this month.\n\nThe divorce application was submitted this afternoon (16th night, Japan Time) through a lawyer, and has been accepted.\n\nThe two held a wedding ceremony in a church in Las Vegas, Nevada, on New Year’s Day last year, and obtained a wedding certificate. However, this was never submitted to the Japan public office. Regarding this, Hamasaki’s company avex commented that “All wedding proceedings were conducted in Nevada, in accordance to their system”. As such, Hamasaki’s status remained as unmarried in the local family register.\n\nBefore her marriage, Hamasaki spent long periods of time in the US, and her plan was to spend her married life together with Schwarz in Los Angeles. However, the Tohoku Earthquake Disaster in March last year swayed Hamasaki’s heart and decisions. On the 16th, she left a message on her fanclub site, stating that “a strong feeling of reluctance to leave Japan grew inside me, and I could not imagine myself living in the US. In the end, my husband was left by himself as the days went by”.\n\nBefore the wedding, Schwarz frequently came to Japan to meet with Hamasaki, and continued to do so several times after the disaster. However, the gap between them gradually widened. Last November, Schwarz released a shocking nude photobook, which invited much distrust. As of now, he has made no claim for settlement money. On the other hand, rumors started that Hamasaki had found a new boyfriend, though avex insisted that “this is not the case”. They claimed that there is no third party involved.\n\nThe two met while filming the PV for “Virgin Road”, Hamasaki’s single which was released on 8 October, and started dating. On New Year’s Eve of the same year, they announced their lightning marriage, and held their wedding ceremony at Las Vegas on New Year’s Day, attended by 10 or so close friends and staff.\n\nRight after the marriage, the two often exchanged tweets, but during the second half of last year, tweets about her husband decreased drastically. Hamasaki has now dropped Schwarz off her follow list, but Hamasaki is still currently on Schwarz’s list.\n\nBefore her divorce announcement on the night of the 16th, Hamasaki flew to the Middle East to shoot a PV for a new song. She has planned to return at the end of the month, and everyone is looking forward to hearing her comments on this issue.\n\n◆The procedure to get married in Las Vegas, Nevada, known as the “Marriage Capital of the World” is fairly simple. About 100,000 marriage applications are received per year. Two people can just head to the public office and apply for a marriage license. All that is needed are identification papers (such as passport), and a $60 handling fee. After agreeing to the marriage terms and signing on the papers, one can obtain a marriage license. After that, as long as a wedding ceremony is held in Nevada within a year, the couple will be officially married. The procedure is the same for both citizens and foreigners.\n\nAs for the ceremony, an exchange of vows is to be done before a priest, and that will earn the priest’s signature on the marriage license. After submission of the signed license to the public office, one can make copies of the marriage certificate. After application for marriage registration at the Japan public office, one is required to submit this copy of the certificate together with a translated copy within 3 months of the ceremony. Hamasaki did not follow through on this last step, and is thus not registered as married in Japan. She has no record of ever being married in the family register."
