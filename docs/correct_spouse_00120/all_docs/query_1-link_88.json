I have to say Paruru’s signature twintails are really cute! Many are calling Payuyu the strongest combi in AKB48.\n\nJohnny’s Family\n\nJohnny’s performances are quite fun this time around as we have live video footage of Arashi from their Miyagi concert, and medleys where the idols are grouped according to their generation. It is quite interesting to see for example, Nishikido Ryo standing next to NEWS, and KAT-TUN performing Real Face with just 4 members. *Heart pinch*\n\nWhich Johnny’s generation do you belong to?

In the blog post titled, “Just married☆,” Hamasaki wrote “Today is the beginning of our life as a couple.”\n\nAccording to Hamasaki’s agency, the two wed in Los Angeles at the end of February, but Hamasaki’s mother submitted their marriage registration in Japan today.\n\nThe couple had gotten engaged in December. According to a source linked to Hamasaki, she was not pregnant. The two had met during the 2012 New Year’s holidays through a friend, and began dating last spring.\n\nHamasaki has already returned to Los Angeles and plans to continue working and creating music from L.A.\n\nSource\n\nNewly engaged Ayumi Hamasaki has left Japan with her beau after a series of appearances in NHK’s annual Kouhaku Uta Gassen and TV Asahi’s Music Station Super Live. However, an increasing number of fans are now discussing whether she is already pregnant.\n\nThe rumors stem from the fact that she was often seen wearing low heels, and wrapped up in clothes. Indeed, during Kohaku she did appear to have a curvier body. She was also wearing flat shoes when she departed Japan later.\n\nHowever, a related personnel refuted the claims and said “I know about these rumours, but she is not pregnant. Even though we have not announced it, her schedule continues to be lined up with work.”\n\nSource\n\nSinger Ayumi Hamasaki (35) recently announced news of her engagement to a 25 year-old American on her fansite. The fiance in question is a student of ULCA medical school in California. According to sources, the marriage application has already been completed in Los Angeles, but the singer herself claims she is “engaged”. In her previous marriage to Austrian actor Manuel Schwarz, it was revealed that she had not officially registered the marriage and so was therefore “single” throughout. People in the industry are speculating if she’s really getting married this time, or whether it’s simply a ploy to create fanfare.\n\nAccording to people related to Ayumi, she was introduced to her fiance in January this year, and they started dating in spring. Ayumi is currently residing in Los Angeles for work. As she has gotten engaged, she’s also received the “Fiancee Visa”(a permit which allows the fiance/fiancee to reside long term in the U.S) . As she wanted her fans to know as soon as possible, she revealed the news on her fansite.\n\nAnother spokesperson revealed that pictures of her fiance was actually exposed in a female magazine in June this year.Sporting a bald cut, he seems to be the macho type. The article also talked of them spending 5 nights in a suite room costing 700,000Yen a night in Bali, Indonesia. After travelling to Bali and Korea together in June, the guy also returned to Japan with Ayumi for her concerts, where he stayed in Ayumi’s residence.\n\n-Skip part about unregistered marriage to Manuel Schwarz-\n\n-Skip part about failed relationship to backup dancer-\n\nAs Ayumi is releasing her new single “Feel the Love” on 25th December, the timing of this announcement is interesting enough for people to think she’s creating a buzz for her comeback.\n\nSource"
