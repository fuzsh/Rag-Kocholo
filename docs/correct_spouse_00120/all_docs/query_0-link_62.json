        "text": "Single no more\n\nWith barely an hour into 2011, the entertainment industry of Japan was striked with a surprise. 32 year old Japanese songstress Hamasaki Ayumi announced her marriage with Austrain male model Manual Schwarz. DIVA turned wife\n\n5 QUESTIONS ABOUT AYU’S MARRIAGE\n\n1. How did they meet?\n\nIn August last year, he was in Los Angeles to star in Ayu’s new track “Virgin Road” MV and it was through this collaboration they met and soon fell in love. Coincidentally, the two play lovers-on-the-run and also had a wedding scene in a church. Manual lives in Los Angeles and the two maintains the relationship via phone calls and emails.\n\n2. Ayu to retire and become a housewife?\n\nOn the eve of New Year’s Day, Ayu appeared in a wedding dress look on Kouhaku. As though hinting to the sudden marriage, she announced on that same night that “I, as a person, as a woman, has found an irreplacable love. We have decided to be together for life”. Rumours in the industry begun spouting that Ayu was to retire, but she denied saying “Nothing will change due to this. I will still be myself.” Ayu even revealed that she told her husband to “put my fans in first place”.\n\n3. What is the background of Ayu’s male model husband?\n\nManual Schwarz from Austria, 30 years old, 1.8m in height, and whose appearance has been likened to Keanu Reaves and Vincent Gallo. He was once a model working for Levi’s and Von Dutch. There is a large difference between Ayu’s and his popularity and income.\n\n4. How was the wedding done in 72 hours?\n\nAfter announcing the marriage, both aarrived at the airport the same afternoon surrounded by 9 bodyguards. They wore black and put on sunglasses to keep a low profile but were still recgonized by the public, which alerted the media. Despite all the interviews, Ayu did not respond and merely smiled to acknowledge, as she held her husband’s arm tightly throughout. They reached Los Angeless on 1st January, clad in casual wear and had a closed-door wedding ceremony without family and friends. Around 10 colleagues were present to witness the event. After the wedding, Manuel posted on Twitter a photo with the pair with their wedding rings gazing at each other in a sweet manner.\n\n5. Was is a real marriage?\n\nA number of reports have suggested that Ayu has had a shotgun marriage but her management company has denied such rumors. Also, some reports point that Ayu is using the wedding as a prmotional gimmick for her latest album “Love songs” released last month as her husband is also her onscreen boyfriend.\n\nPAGE TWO\n\nSharing the bliss on the web\n\nAyu, who has rarely publicized her love life, announced her marriage in a unique way and also had an overseas wedding. Morover, she has gladly posted photos of their couple phtos for everyone to see Ayu as a woman-in-love.\n\nWhen love has become history\n\nSine her debut, Ayu has had many rumours about her love life such has (sorry I have no idea who they are cept…) .. and Tohoshinki member Hero etc. The most looked upon was when she was with er ex-lover, Tomoya Nagase, TOKIO’s lead vocal, in a 7 year long secret relationship. They were so deeply in love, they even had tattoos to represent their love. However in 2007, they announced their breakup and each has found their new love.\n\nTranslation: Freedreamer @ AHS\n\nCredit: jiarongisme @ AHS\n\nOriginal source: i-Weekly\n\nShared by Ayu’s Story\n\nTake out with full credits!\n\nChina netizens on ayu’s marriage: “She was obviously cheated by the Westerner”\n\nA happily smiling Hamasaki Ayumi and Manuel Schwarz at Narita Airport, Chiba.\n\n2011 New Year’s Day. With regards to popular Japanese news, it would have been singer Hamasaki Ayumi’s sudden marriage announcement. China’s fans, like Japanese fans, were shocked at this development, and there were some who were ambivalent about the decision. Aside from the honest congratulatory comments like “Ayumi’s lifestyle is indeed cool”, “I hope she will be happy”, there was also dissatisfaction. There were comments like “Why was she taken by an Austrian? What are Japanese men doing?” and “she was obviously cheated by the Westerner”.\n\n…..\n\nHamasaki Ayumi is the only Japanese artist who has a large presence in China, just like how Yamaguchi Momoe was many years ago. Of note was an interview conducted last April in a hidden location in Tibet, 3,000m up in the mountains. When young Tibetans there were asked “Where would you most like to go?”, the answer was “Hamasaki Ayumi’s concert”. In the town’s old CD shop, among the many CDs teaching Buddhist scriptures, pirated Hamasaki Ayumi CDs could also be found.\n\nIn China, a survey was conducted in 2008 online, regarding “The most popular Japanese artist in China”. Hamasaki Ayumi received nearly 5% of total votes in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, achieving first place. Second and third were occupied by Utada Hikaru and Namie Amuro respectively.\n\nHamasaki Ayumi’s charm can be discerned from Chinese fan blogs. “She is always full of confidence”, “She doesn’t waver, and walks her own path”. Comments like “She works so hard” were also common. Just like in Japan, there seems to be more female than male fans. To understand Hamasaki Ayumi’s songs, many Chinese girls start to learn the Japanese language.\n\n“Like Yamaguchi Momoe, Japanese women tend to stop working when they get married, I want ayu not to marry just because of that.” Many Chinese fans are worried about the marriage because they fear not being able to hear new songs. Some wanted her to “give Asian women more power and charisma after getting married”. There were also many comments from male fans, such as “I don’t understand why so many great Japanese women marry Western men”, “She only knew him for 5 months, I’ve been her fan for years…” and “That husband has no reputation of his own. If he is using this marriage to exploit ayu’s fame, I will never forgive him”.\n\nTranslation: Misa-chan @ AHS\n\nOriginal source: Yahoo!

No family nor friends attended my wedding!”\n\n4 January 2011. 1:52pm\n\nSinger Hamasaki Ayumi, who married Austrian actor Manuel Schwarz in Las Vegas on New Years Day, have spoken up after reading some reports on her marriage ceremony. “Though some reports said that close friends attended my wedding ceremony, nobody went to Vegas with me. No family, no friends.”, Hamasaki clarified the situation to prevent misunderstanding.\n\nHamasaki Ayumi, a female singer and the pride of Japan, dealt out a big surprise this New Year! She announced her marriage on her fansite, and personally reported on Twitter that “There were only my beloved staff members there watching over us.” In response to the “close friends and staff members in attendance” reported, she happily clarified “Just to make this clear, for all my real family and friends who felt left out!! (laugh)”.\n\nThe announcement was made on her fansite, but not during the annual Countdown Live concert. As to why, Hamasaki explains on Twitter that “I want to keep my work and my private life separate.” Last year, her 3D movie 『Livespire 「A3D ayumi hamasaki ARENA TOUR 2009 A ～NEXT LEVEL～」』 showed in 12 cities across the country, exhibiting Hamasaki’s liveliness and energy. Having captured happiness in her private life, Hamasaki is sure to shine again this year.\n\nTranslation: Misa-chan\n\nOriginal source: Yahoo!

Hamasaki announced this on a member-restricted fan site, the same place where she earlier announced her sudden decision to marry. That same day, the couple left from Narita Airport. Sources say that the ceremony was extremely relaxed, with the couple in T-shirts and jackets instead of the traditional haori. ayu will probably continue to have her honeymoon overseas.\n\n◇ ◇\n\nA shotgun wedding on New Years Day. According to sources, the couple reached Los Angeles at around 10am on New Years Day (2/1/2011 3am JPN time) and went straight to Las Vegas. At 6pm, they registered their marriage at the local office. And at 7pm, they held the ceremony in a chapel, with only 10 close friends and staff members in attendance.\n\nLas Vegas isn’t just about casinos, it is also famous for its casual wedding ceremonies, including the “drive-thru wedding”. Cheap weddings costing several thousand yen and expensive ones costing several ten thousand yen can be held. Sources say that the ayu couple’s ceremony was extremely relaxed, with T-shirts and jackets worn instead of the traditional haori.\n\nThey also exchanged wedding rings. Photos of them wearing their rings have also been released. After the ceremony, ayu announced her marriage on member-restricted fansite [Read TA diary here]. The couple plan to use their New Year vacation to go on a honeymoon.\n\nAfter the two met up in Japan, they could be seen flirting openly on Twitter. Schwarz tweeted that 「I’m gonna have a beautiful wife」, while ayu replied with a wink.\n\nDuring CDL last year, which Schwarz attended, ayu said 「He says “Please put your fans as your first priority.” I’m not the one who says this, he said it himself」, demonstrating their closeness. As a result of the marriage, Schwarz’s Twitter gained about 10,000 followers within 2 days.\n\nSponichi’s article. Lots of errors here which ayu clarified on Twitter. The couple were not wearing jackets, no friends attended her ceremony, and she did not make any announcement during CDL (that quote came from Twitter replies)\n\nTranslation: Misa-chan\n\nOriginal source: Sponichi\n\nShared by Ayu’s Story\n\nTake out with full credits!\n\nJapan’s Biggest Pop Diva Returns To Video Games\n\nSelling over 50 million albums in Japan, Ayumi Hamasaki is one of Asia’s biggest popstars, posting a number one single every year since she debuted in 1998. Now she’s bringing her music to one of Japan’s biggest role-playing franchises.\n\nDuring the mid-1990s, she co-hosted a music program that was broadcasted on Nintendo Satellaview, which was the Nintendo developed satellite TV add-on for the Super Famicom game system. But it wasn’t until 1998 that she released her smash hit debut, launching her highly successful career.\n\nLike Madonna, Hamasaki continues to reinvent herself for her albums and is a national style icon, creating trend after trend. She’s a regular in ads, whether it be selling cameras, donuts or make-up. She’s spawned her own clothing label, cartoon and variety program.\n\nEven with the rising popularity of rivals like Kumi Koda, Hamasaki’s impact continues to be felt on fashion, music and culture. But there’s more to her than image. In early 2008, the popstar blogged (via the BBC) that her left ear “doesn’t work” anymore. Japan’s big pop icon was deaf in one ear.\n\n“Nevertheless, I would like to continue as a singer,” she continued. “That’s why I would like to continue singing until I reach the limit with my remaining right ear.”\n\n“I won’t stop. I won’t make excuses,” Hamasaki wrote. “As a professional, I would like to deliver the best performance for everyone.”\n\nThis came months after Hamasaki ended her long relationship with Tomoya Nagase, singer of the boy band Tokio, which might be best known to Kotaku readers for the Xbox 360 “Do! Do! Do!” commercials.\n\nNot one to slow down, Hamasaki continues to record, appear in concert and on television. She’s even providing the theme song for upcoming role-playing game Tales of Xillia. This won’t be her first game theme, as she previously provided songs for Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams.\n\nIn 1998, she burst on the scene from the clubs of Shibuya. Hamasaki isn’t the best singer, she isn’t even a great dancer. But rather, she is a talented lyricist, and in an industry filled with pre-packaged pop princesses, Hamasaki was encouraged early on to write her own songs. She’s since moved on to not just composing her own music, but overseeing her album art and music videos.\n\nAnd like Madonna or even Bowie, Hamasaki is hard to pin down: her music jumps from genre to genre — from ballads to techno to rock to, yes, video games. Next year, Tales of Xillia, complete with an Ayumi Hamasaki theme, will be released on the PS3. She won’t stop, she won’t quit, and she’s not making excuses.\n\nCulture Smash is a daily dose of things topical, interesting and sometimes even awesome — game related and beyond.\n\nCredit: njanjayrp @ AHS\n\nOriginal source: Kotaku\n\nShared by Ayu’s Story\n\nTake out with full credits!"
