Â Â Â Â Japanese pop singer Ayumi Hamasaki married Austrian actor Manuel Schwarz on Saturday in a church ceremony in the United States, her office said on Sunday.

Â Â Â Â Hamasaki, 32, and Schwarz, 30, met last August in Los Angeles when she was making a promotional video for her song âVirgin Road,â her office said.

Â Â Â Â Hamasaki, one of Japanâs most popular singers, sang âVirgin Roadâ in a white wedding dress on New Yearâs Eve on NHKâs popular yearend music show âKohaku Utagassen,â hours before her wedding announcement was issued.

Â Â Â Â Schwarz, who lives in Los Angeles, plays Hamasakiâs bridegroom in the music video.
