C. FOREWORD Research: A Record of Scholarship and Publication records the scholarly and creative activities of the faculty and graduate students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This forty -second issue covers the period from January 1, 1967 through December 31, 1968. The volume is divided into four sections. Part I, the largest section of the book, reports the activities of the regular academic staff. It is a record of the research publications and other activities of the academic faculty and of the dissertation and theses directed by the members of that faculty. Part II describes the nature of various research organizations in the University — specialized laboratories, institutes, and centers — which broaden the resources and enrich the research activities of the various academic departments and their faculties. In some cases, publications of members of institutes are included here rather than under a department. Part III summarizes the program of research societies in which members from a num- ber of different departments participate. Part IV records the contents of a number of publications sponsored wholly or in part by the University and also lists the publications of the University of North Carolina Press. This volume was prepared in the Office of Research Administration with the valuable assistance of Mrs. Susan Robertson. George R. Holcomb Dean of Research Administration Digitized by the Internet Archive in 2014 https://archive.org/details/recordofuniversi741univ_1 CONTENTS PAGE Part I.
