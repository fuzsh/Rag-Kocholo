        "text": "Georg Jellinek was one of the legal theorists who brought a new level of methodological sophistication to German public law scholarship at the turn of the twentieth century. Where previous research has called attention to his theory of conceptual “types” and his application of contemporary neo-Kantian epistemology to the law, this article explores his thinking on the nature of values and value judgments, and the possibilities for objectivity in the legal and political sciences. Jellinek sought to open an increasingly calcified legal positivism to the findings of the social sciences and to an inherently pluralistic, changing world of subjective values, but without abandoning the positivist ideals of legal certainty and the exclusion of political and other value judgments. Analyzing his response to this challenge opens a window onto his broader work in public law and political science, illuminating doctrines like the “two-sided” theory of the state and the “normative power of the factual,” which have achieved a lasting place in German legal and political theory. It also shows why Jellinek put aside the traditional ideal of bias-free objectivity for a surprisingly modern vision of a process of intersubjective agreement, driven by the institutions of free and open scholarly debate.\n\n4 Paulson, Stanley and Schulte, Martin, eds., Georg Jellinek: Beiträge zu Leben und Werk (Tübingen, 2000)Google Scholar; Kersten, Jens, Georg Jellinek und die klassische Staatslehre (Tübingen, 2000)Google Scholar; Anter, Andreas, ed., Die normative Kraft des Faktischen (Baden-Baden, 2004)Google Scholar; Hübinger, Gangolf, “Staatstheorie und Politik als Wissenschaft im Kaiserreich: Georg Jellinek, Otto Hintze, Max Weber,” in Maier, Hans, Matz, Ulrich, Sontheimer, Kurt, and Weinacht, Paul-Ludwig, eds., Politik, Philosophie, Praxis (Stuttgart, 1988), 143–61Google Scholar; Breuer, Stefan, “Fachmenschenfreundschaft II: Max Weber und Georg Jellinek,” in Breuer, Max Webers tragische Soziologie (Tübingen, 2006), 294–325 Google Scholar; Anter, Andreas, Max Weber's Theory of the Modern State (New York, 2014; first published 1995)CrossRefGoogle Scholar; see also two notable accounts by historians: Kelly, Duncan, The State of the Political (Oxford, 2003), chap. 3Google Scholar; Ghosh, Peter, “Max Weber and Georg Jellinek: Two Divergent Conceptions of Law,” Saeculum, 59/2 (2008), 299–347 Google Scholar. In the past decade, Jellinek's thought has also drawn increasing interest in the literature on rights theory and international law.\n\n14 This description of constructivism, or “conceptual jurisprudence,” necessarily simplifies a more complex tradition. On its origins in private law through the early Rudolf Jhering, and occasional coexistence with acceptance of historically and socially informed legal scholarship, see Haferkamp, Georg Friedrich Puchta; Losano, Mario, Studien zu Jhering und Gerber (Ebelsbach, 1984)Google Scholar; Somek, Alexander, “Legal Formality and Freedom of Choice: A Moral Perspective on Jhering's Constructivism,” Ratio Juris, 15/1 (2002), 52–62 CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Hofmann, Hasso, “From Jhering to Radbruch: On the Logic of Traditional Legal Concepts to the Social Theories of Law to the Renewal of Legal Idealism,” in Canale, Damiano, Grossi, Paolo, and Hofmann, Hasso, eds., A History of the Philosophy of Law in the Civil Law World, 1600–1900 (Dordrecht, 2009), 301–54Google Scholar; and Oertzen, Die soziale Funktion, 214–38, on Gerber. Kaufmann, Arthur and Hassemer, Winfried, “Enacted Law and Judicial Decision in German Jurisprudential Thought,” University of Toronto Law Journal, 19/4 (1969), 461–86CrossRefGoogle Scholar, remains a useful overview.\n\n26 Jellinek to Lujo Brentano, 28 May 1889, in Nachlass Brentano, Bundesarchiv Koblenz, 1001/29; Jellinek to Ludwig Felix, 20 June 1894, 2 July 1894, 8 Jan. 1895, 15 March 1895, 20 Oct. 1895, 14 May 1896, 16 May 1896, 24 May 1896, in NL Jellinek, 1136/43. During or before these years, Jellinek read the work of such “historical” political economists as Brentano, Heinrich Herkner, Werner Sombart, and Max Weber, and such “theorists” as G. F. Knapp, Albert Schäffle, Adolf Wagner, and Menger, among others, including socialist writers. For a sense of the scope of his reading, compare Weber, Max, Allgemeine (“theoretische”) Nationalökonomie: Vorlesungen 1894–1898 , in Max Weber Gesamtausgabe, ed. Mommsen, Wolfgang, section III, vol. 1 (Tübingen, 2009)Google Scholar.\n\n79 Here it may be useful to draw an analogy to the widespread model of a “core” of certainty and “penumbra” of uncertainty in the law later evolved by Hart, H. L. A., e.g. in his Essays in Jurisprudence and Philosophy (Oxford, 1983), 62–72 CrossRefGoogle Scholar, although Jellinek's and Hart's specific views, of course, differ.\n\n91 Ibid., esp. 8–46. For Max Weber's praise of this work and interest in the problem of connecting the legal and political “sides” see Weber to Jellinek, 27 Aug. 1906, in Briefe 1906–1908, in Max Weber Gesamtausgabe, ed. M. Rainer Lepsius and Wolfgang Mommsen, section II, vol. 5 (Tübingen, 1990), 149. Although he found Jellinek's approach to the study of politics too formalist and legalistic (Weber to Alfred Weber, 22 May 1907, in ibid., 311), Weber was actively interested in Jellinek's attempts in 1909 to gain funding from Andrew Carnegie for a German–American institute for comparative politics in Heidelberg, which would have been devoted to such political foundations of Staatsrecht. Weber was willing to participate provided that the institute emphasized studies of the sociopolitical rather than the legal “side” of the state. See Weber's letters to Jellinek of July, August, and September 1909 in Briefe 1909–1910, in Max Weber Gesamtausgabe, ed. M. Rainer Lepsius and Wolfgang Mommsen, section II, vol. 6 (Tübingen, 1994), 179 ff. Weber was also engaged enough with Jellinek's work to write a review of one of the latter's essays as late as 1909, which appears to have been lost prior to publication (ibid., 225).\n\n99 Ibid., 353 ff., on Jellinek's discussion of the tensions between conservative and progressive tendencies in the law, and the constant change it underwent in response to social changes. For an assessment of how well Jellinek actually employed social-scientific and especially sociological theories to these ends, see Kersten, Georg Jellinek, 151–6; the results are mixed, though this has no necessary bearing on his theory.\n\n102 A related criticism is that made by Stefan Korioth, “Shattering of Methods,” 46, who remarks that for Jellinek, “The theory of the law of the state can merely track the success or failure of transformative strivings of political forces,” and must acknowledge irrational political faits accomplis without any normative theory of why it must do so.\n\n122 Sinzheimer, Jüdische Klassiker, 228, points to Jellinek's use of historical appropriateness and “world history as judge” to suggest which self-contained Weltanschauungen might be most appropriate, though he leaves the mistaken impression that Jellinek regarded the judgments of world history as more definitive—oriented toward real, inevitable “progress”—than in fact he did. Other scholars, too, see in Jellinek a vision of “assured evolutionary progress” with little sense of historical contingency (Ghosh, “Max Weber and Georg Jellinek,” 329–30, 334). They are right that Jellinek believed in progress, but as a hope and ideal and not as an inevitability: he was quite clear that any attempts to see change as teleological development were speculative and made no claims to scientific status even if such speculations were difficult to eliminate entirely (Jellinek, AS, 7, 42–3, 262–3).\n\n129 Jellinek, “Ansprache des Prorektors in Frankfurt am Main bei der Eröffnung des Museums der Senckenbergischen Naturforschenden Gesellschaft,” 13 Oct. 1907, in Jellinek, ASR 1: 359–61, at 360. Jellinek always included science alongside the economy as areas that could not be directed by a single, planning will, even though he took note of the ability of the state and other associations to further or hinder it, e.g. in Jellinek, AS, 4."
