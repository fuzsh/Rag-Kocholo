        "text": "Citation preview\n\nThe German Historical School and European Economic Thought\n\nThe financial crisis of 2008 has revived interest in economic scholarship from a historical perspective. The most in-depth studies of the relationship between economics and history can be found in the work of the so-called German Historical School (GHS). The influence of the GHS in the US and Britain has been well documented, but far less has been written on the rest of Europe. This volume studies the interconnection between economic thought and economic policy from the mid-nineteenth century to the interwar period. It examines how the school’s ideas spread and were interpreted in different European countries between 1850 and 1930, analyzing its legacies in these countries. In doing so, the book is able to trace the interconnection between economic thought and economic policy, adding new voices to the debate on the diffusion of ideas and flow of knowledge. This book identifies issues related to topics such as nationalism and cosmopolitanism in the history of ideas and clarifies themes in policy making that are still currently debated. These include monetary policy and benefits of free trade for all parties involved in international exchanges. This book will be of great interest to those who study history of economic thought, economic theory and political economy.

Having laid for a long while emphasis on model building and general equilibrium approaches as tools to explain the workings of the economic system, economists are increasingly aware of the historical and evolutionary explanations of the workings of complex processes as economic meltdowns, economic policy making, the power of vested interests in the economy, the aims of political elites and the formation of institutions and public opinion (out of many examples, see Acemoglou & Robinson, 2012; Reinhart & Rogoff, 2009). Indeed, the historical approach to economic problems has yielded important insights, enriching knowledge and challenging perceived wisdom (see, among others, Burgin, 2012; Gorton, 2012; James, 2012; Reinert, 2011). For historians of economics the need to study economics as a social science, to use the history of their subject as a tool is a self-evident truth, their daily interest and preoccupation. This occurs despite the fact that the history of economic thought has long ceased to be of interest in the mainstream study of economics, as has economic history, with the possible exception of cliometrics and the “new institutionalism”. The interplay between economics and history has been discussed in many writings of economists. It is found in Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations, but mostly in the work of German economists from the midnineteenth century up to World War I (see Brandt, 1992; Winkel, 1977), the members of the so-called German Historical School (GHS), whose influence in the US (Bateman, 2011; Dorfman, 1955; Herbst, 1965; Myles, 1959) and in Britain (Koot, 1980, 2008) has already been documented, whereas for Japan and the rest of Europe, despite scattered references (see, e.g., Heinonen, 2002), there remains a void for a detailed study that waits to be filled. The purpose of the present volume is to address the question of the diffusion of ideas and teachings related to the GHS in a series of European countries and to search for the legacy of the GHS in these countries. In other words we aim to study the interconnection between economic thought and economic policy from the mid-nineteenth century to the interwar, with the aim to trace the influence of the GHS in a series of European countries that were not the focus of\n\nIntroduction xv scholarly attention until now. We aim to identify issues related to topics such as nationalism and cosmopolitanism in the history of ideas and clarify themes in policy making that are still currently debated, such as monetary policy and benefits of free trade for all parties involved in international exchanges. We will refer to major texts that influenced European economic thinking greatly, but we will not insist on textual exegesis and interpretation of theoretical transfers between Germany and the rest of Europe. Instead we will focus on processes of dissemination of economic ideas and circumstances advocating the adoption of certain economic paradigms. By using a comparative approach we hope to arrive at a new and fresh approach to debates about the flow of economic ideas and channels of dissemination as translations and the diffusion, the appropriation and the emulation of knowledge. Our approach presupposes familiarity with the study of liberalism in Europe in the nineteenth century (De Ruggiero, 1959) and the efforts of many European economists to blend their own version of liberalism with ideas related with protectionism, social reform, nation building and growth enhancing policies and so forth (see the papers in Psalidopoulos & Mata, 2002). The present introduction sets the stage of our project and is structured as follows. We first introduce our initial motivation and continue with a chapter on the clash between the GHS and classical political economy. We continue with a section on the relevance of our investigation for present-day historiography. In a further step we discuss recent debates about the GHS in literature. Finally we reflect on the dissemination of economic ideas and introduce our questions and the individual chapters of the book.\n\nRelevance German economists of the early nineteenth century espoused initially with enthusiasm Adam Smith’s teachings. When, however, the classical system was codified by Ricardo and his followers, dissent among the advocates of the cameralist and administrative tradition in Germany started getting articulated. This gave rise to the historical approach in economic reasoning, an approach related to German “Staatskunst”, the art of conducting the business of the state. The main objection of German authors to classicism was the dismissal of ethical judgments and values for the benefit of an analysis that narrowed down economic action to selfishness and egoism. Furthermore the fact that Germany became a customs union in 1834 and reached political unification under Prussia in 1871 encouraged until then disunity and particularism among German economists. The latter focused on the national past, through the study of the evolution of law at first, with the creation of a historical school of law as an outcome, and then through the push for empirical research that distinguished German research from the classical one as it offered empiricism and induction in place of deduction. This led to the formation of a distinct GHS in economics. The German economists of the late nineteenth century rejected in their majority the existence of universal laws in economics and accused the classical approach\n\nxvi\n\nJosé Luís Cardoso and Michalis Psalidopoulos\n\nof misusing abstract reasoning, and of promoting an inadequate psychological foundation of economic action. They were in favor of social reforms and accepted state intervention to a far larger extent than the classicals did. Finally they were in their vast majority not committed free traders. One can argue that for those economists who formed the core of the GHS, empirical investigations and economic history were more important than theoretical work and the promotion of economic analysis. Of course, the historical approach was not an entirely German phenomenon. Advocates of historical analysis, dissenters of the classical political economy tradition existed all over Europe. They also existed in Britain, but could not, however, reverse the dominance of classical and later neoclassical economics in academia and in public discourse there, whereas in Germany the historical approach remained dominant until 1914. Many studies have been published concerning the GHS as a whole or its individual authors, on its discourse and influence (out of many, see Backhaus, 1993; Balabkins, 1988; Grimmer-Solem, 2003; Hagemann, 2012a; Nau & Schefold, 2002; Shionoya, 2001, 2005). On the other hand these studies paid little attention to the interconnection between professionalization processes, public policy agendas and the institutional framework of the wide impact the GHS was able to create for many decades in countries outside Germany. Newborn countries that became independent in the nineteenth century in Northern as well as in Southern Europe, countries that needed economic theory and economic policy arguments that would assist them in their efforts to grow and prosper, showed sympathy with the German paradigm, and the aforementioned studies have not focused on these latecomer nations. They also tend to neglect the nowadays very relevant issue of European cultural identity, stemming among other things from a common approach in the history of ideas, a topic that has been very little scrutinized in current historical studies. Perceived wisdom in the history of economics says that the GHS had its distant roots in the work of Friedrich List and was dominant in academia and in public administration in Germany from the mid-nineteenth century to the immediate post–World War I period (Eisermann, 1956; Schumpeter, 1954; Screpanti & Zamagni, 1993; Spiegel, 1991). Although some interpreters have expressed reservations about a chronological distinction within the school (see Lindenfeld, 1993), there is a tacit agreement on the differentiation between two generations of the GHS, the “older” and the “younger”. Both personified the mainstream opposition to the British classical political economy and, later, to the neoclassical school, by taking the view that history was the key source of knowledge about human actions and on economic matters. Even Marxism, another opposing view to the classical paradigm, practiced “historical materialism” and shared with the GHS, despite major differences, a propensity to use history as the ultimate test of any economic theory. Historicism was a mental attitude in Europe, closely connected with growing nationalisms in many countries that put history at the center of a combination of all forms of intellectual life. According to this approach, classical\n\nIntroduction xvii economics was considered responsible for many social evils in Britain, such as pauperism, poverty and inhuman working conditions. These evils should not occur in other countries. The point of economists pursuing a historical inquiry in their investigations was not to take the situation that sprang out of the industrial revolution as natural and given, but to try to shape it. Economics had according to the critics of the abstract, classical method to be closer to existing realities and provide advice on how to change things. Economic man with his profit-maximizing behavior did not account for law, tradition, habits and national moods of thought. Therefore distance from abstract theory and an inclination towards empirical research that started mainly in Germany were welcome. Economic processes were studied here from an evolutionist perspective. State action was for this approach not an unwelcome evil but a must. In place of egoism, utilitarianism and causality, German economists took an ethical stance towards all things economic (Tribe, 1995). Indeed, the GHS was a resort of anticlassical economists of the period after 1850. If we look at this period in context we find John Stuart Mill recanting the wages fund theory in 1868, leaving his followers in limbo. Two years later, in 1870, in a famous lecture before the British Academy, William Stanley Jevons lamented the disarray of British economic science. In 1871 Prussia won the war against France and emerged as a major economic power in continental Europe. Its economic success was attributed to the qualities of its educational system with the result of an influx of foreign students in the country to study, among other sciences, economics. Then followed, in 1873, the Vienna crisis, the first global financial crisis, a crisis with contagious effects, for which the disintegrating classical school had no clear-cut explanation (Lindenfeld, 1997). In this climate of the rejection of the old and in the search for new principles, the first neoclassical treatises were written. But views espousing the historical method were also circulated and in fact won at that juncture hearts and minds of most European intellectuals for the following twenty years (Takebayashi, 2003), anticipating debates on the “soul of economics” that would become more accurate throughout the interwar period (see Yonay, 1998). The GHS pioneered social policy, as this particular policy concern gained international attention due to the emergence of universal male voting and of the growing presence of labor/ socialist parties in European parliaments. Its members founded a professional scientific association to discuss economic policy issues and to influence public opinion (out of the many existing histories see Hagemann, 2001). It is therefore fair to say that the GHS constituted an alternative for economic research, due to its openness in research and in policy advice. Furthermore, latecomers in development could find in the GHS a different agenda for research and economic reforms, different than the one based on the allegedly universal principles of classical political economy; these included, as is well-known, a condition known as the stationary state, an uninspiring vision for the less developed European economies.\n\nxviii José Luís Cardoso and Michalis Psalidopoulos In short, the GHS espoused the view that history was the key source of knowledge about human actions and economic matters. It offered an alternative to the existing classical doctrine on many fronts: on method, on the necessity of social reform and on the need of promoting economic growth and development. Fiscal, monetary and commercial policies were, for historical economists, instruments for the promotion of government aims and targets. GHS economists pioneered empirical work in economics and studied the business cycle. They also stressed the importance of statistics and conducted empirical economic investigations. They were hostile to Marxism, the other emerging economic doctrine of the period after 1883, and tended to underestimate from a scientific point of view what neoclassicism was about. Alfred Marshall on the opposing side rightly saw the GHS as an enemy for his “economics” and undermined it in Britain (Maloney, 1999). It is also worth mentioning the proximity of the GHS with economists belonging to the institutionalist tradition, especially as regards the awareness of the centrality of law and normative rules explaining the functioning of human societies and their political organization. In this sense, they contributed to building up a new approach to the legal environment and political context associated with the diversity of economic action (Pearson, 1997). Finally the GHS was open to social engineering for fast growth. It introduced for emerging economies a stages of development theory, an ideology of nation building and growth, addressing itself to the nation and to all social classes. It did not employ the analytical device of three antagonistic social classes in society. In this context protectionism was not simply a departure from free trade. It was in line with liberal principles of governance and a tool to shape society by fostering its developmental potential.\n\nReaction to classical economics The reaction against political economy in the three last decades of the nineteenth century cannot be dissociated from the historical national contexts that did not favor the acceptance of its main tenets and the rigidity of its assumptions. Furthermore, the intellectual milieu was favorable to the acceptance of a historical approach to economic phenomena, which was not in itself an exclusive prerogative of the German school. When using or quoting German authors in support of their arguments, European political economists were merely using rhetoric devices to make their proposals sound and acceptable. Three main lines of argument proved useful, as Bob Coats summed up for the English case: They [the historists] questioned the scientific status of political economy and the purpose of the subject; they protested against the narrowness of its scope; and they complained of the excessive reliance on the abstract-deductive method of reasoning, and the dogmatic application of conclusions to policy. (Coats, 1954: 221; see also Coats, 1993)\n\nIntroduction xix The questioning of the scientific status of political economy was largely motivated by the political implications of a laissez-faire program and strong individualistic beliefs that could not be welcome as proper science. Indeed, “the privileged standing of political economy was comprehensively called into doubt in the 1870s and 80s as a result of several intellectual as well as practical developments” (Collini, 1983: 249). The benefits of a closer relationship with other scientific disciplines were due to the very nature of economic phenomena that required for many authors a variety of angles and approaches, including noneconomic ones. As regards the underlying method of economic science, the criticism put forward was based on the refusal to accept that a same general theory and a same set of rigid conceptual categories could be applicable to different concrete situations, in terms of both time and place. Therefore, methodological disputes indicated that more attention should be given to the observation of facts and to the method of induction in order to conclude on the existence (or not) of regularities in economic and social life (Blaug, 1992). According to the defenders of the historical approach, political economy could not survive as confined to a logical, formal deductive enterprise with no relations with the actual facts of real economic life and with no concern with the discussion of current affairs. It had to be based on empirical data and subject to the examination of statistical regularities. By doing it, through attention given to both the historical background and the policy implications of facts observed, political economy was gaining a historical mood that invited an innovative approach to social phenomena. Political economy was making the best efforts to become “historical economics” (Tribe, 1995), or “historical political economy” (Grimmer-Solem & Romani, 1999). The comparative approach to societies that find themselves in different stages of development was a precondition for the application of any basic principles whose validity was taken for granted by the practitioners of economic science. Through that type of approach it would be possible to emphasize how different historical situations could call for diversified application of, allegedly, universal laws. The acceptance of economic doctrines and principles as appropriate to the historical conditions of a certain time should not mean that they kept being adequate and applicable to new circumstances and different kinds of practical problems. The fact that different critics shared a common ground as opponents to orthodox political economy did not mean that they were able to build together a new alternative scientific discipline, or a new and universal set of economic principles (cf. Koot, 1980). Though the outcome of the historicist approach did not result in a substantial change of the construction of mainstream economics, it gave stimulus to autonomous advances in economic history and in a global science of society grounded on positivist sociology. Economics did not become a historical science, but the historical school made important contributions to the understanding of the problems dealt with by politicians and economists (cf. Kadish, 1989).\n\nxx\n\nJosé Luís Cardoso and Michalis Psalidopoulos\n\nOne of the key issues at stake was to understand how the existing economic system, capitalism, that had created progress and contributed to economic welfare for the middle classes, could not spread out its beneficial effects to society as a whole and could not extend similar positive effects to other countries. Therefore, critics of cosmopolitan political economy were also defenders of a new approach to economic reforms and state intervention, considering that markets acting by themselves could not provide alone the riches needed to sustain basic equilibria in society (Beiser, 2012). The social question was obviously a key issue for the authors associated with the GHS, concerned as they were with the potential disruptive consequences of the rapid developments of industrial society and the radical changes at the workplace. Thus, the convergence of opinions of authors belonging to different doctrinal families or schools of thought was a consequence of the common problems serving as a starting point to justify the need of social and political reform in the national organization of economic life. The national element was only a part of a wider concern with the social question (cf. Nau, 2000). The same global convergence occurred with the interpretation of the enlarged functions of the state as the main provider and regulator of public policies aiming at social justice and a better distribution of wealth.\n\nDissemination of economics through German economics textbooks The presence of German authors in European economic literature was made possible by different cultural vehicles – namely, those fostered by the strong influence of the German literature on history and law (cf. Hagemann & Rösch, 2012; Tribe, 1995). It is also worth referring to the diffusion and acceptance of the standard economic textbooks produced in Germany throughout the period 1825–1875 – namely, those by Karl Rau (1832), Wilhelm Roscher (1843) and Albert Schäffle (1867). The French translations of Rau and Roscher were widespread in various European countries and proved essential for the institutionalization of the teaching of political economy, especially in law faculties. Theory, policy and public finance were the pillars of teaching economics as a social science. The key notions transmitted by these German textbooks were essential to build up a theoretical critique of traditional classical-Ricardian political economy, since they offered arguments to show that it was possible to harmonize the classical theory of production and growth with a theory of value and distribution explained by individual demand and utility. Furthermore, it was precisely this attention paid to subjective motivations that is at the heart of the development of political economy in Germany by the mid-nineteenth century. As well summed up by Keith Tribe, This conception of economic action arising from the process by which humans satisfy their wants and needs, and in so doing constitute a realm of goods\n\nIntroduction xxi out of a world of objects, is continuous with the standard definition of economic action that had emerged at the turn of the century in Germany. (Tribe, 1995: 70) Even though all European readers of Rau, Roscher and other members of the historical school may not have grasped the essential message that was well captured by Carl Menger and Alfred Marshall – as pointed out by Erich Streissler (1990), who labeled this influence as “the German protoneoclassical mood” – it is nevertheless clear that it was not necessary to fully adhere to the coherent program of the GHS in order to emphasize the weaknesses of classical political economy demonstrated by German authors at large. In this context, the scattered, circumstantial or even loose references in European economic literature to German schools and traditions – being those in history, law or economics – gain a stronger meaning, as they serve to demonstrate that there was a common concern with a multiplicity of practical problems that justify the development of new theoretical and methodological approaches. The GHS may have existed in its full strength only in Germany. But it served as a mirror where the same critical points could be addressed and reflected. It served as a landmark for the development of political economy in different European national contexts as documented in the essays that make up the present volume. Many scholars, attracted by German economics textbooks, made the decision to visit Germany for graduate studies in person. Thus they formed in their majority an “army” of sympathizers of induction and of government regulation in the economy.\n\nHistoriographical dialogues and relevant questions Although these issues underline the relevance of the GHS for current scholarship, there are further reasons to revisit the subject. Despite the fact that textbooks on the history of economics (Backhouse, 1985; Screpanti & Zamagni, 1993; Spiegel, 1991) have chapters of various lengths on the GHS, the standard things referred to by many scholars are grossly misleading. One example is the standard reference to GHS economists as “Kathedersozialisten”, socialists of the chair. This associates German economists with socialism, an economic doctrine they didn’t believe in; they simply sought a middle ground between pecuniary business interests demanding a laissez faire economic environment and Marxian revolutionary socialism. Another one is their identification with protectionism. But this is again very ambiguous, too. Whereas some of the GHS economists became protectionists and approved relevant legislation, having initially in their careers espoused free trade, others (e.g., Lujo Brentano) did not. It is therefore misleading and an oversimplification to label all German economists and the GHS as protectionist. Finally, and for reasons of taxonomic convenience, it is repeated that the GHS was important and dominant in Germany until 1933, whereas it had actually declined after 1918. A fresh look at the GHS influence in Europe is needed in order to analyze its legacy from a contemporary perspective and to contribute to a better\n\nxxii\n\nJosé Luís Cardoso and Michalis Psalidopoulos\n\nunderstanding of its relevance for policy making in various national contexts in the continent. This need stems out of contemporary debates surrounding the GHS. Erik Grimmer-Solem and Roberto Romani (1999) have argued, for instance, that there was no “school” based on German economic thinking, due to the diversity of approaches and the simultaneous existence of economists using history as an analytical tool of analysis in various non-German-speaking European countries. Similarly Heith Pearson (1999) dismissed the very idea of a GHS, on the basis of the lack of coherence and any spirit of community between German economists of the particular period. However, as it has been pointed out by Bruce Caldwell (2001) and others, certain schools in economics, like the mercantilists or the classical school of political economy, were not “schools” in the sense of closed “towers of faith” either. Were the Salamanca scholastics members of a school? What about the diversity and the difference between the members of the first neoclassical “school”? The fact that physiocracy may have been a school in the sense described earlier, with individual members promoting the same economic principles and promoting the same beliefs and values, can be attributed to the special cultural circumstances prevailing in prerevolutionary France at the time. These also explain the withering away of physiocracy after 1789. We side with Keith Tribe in his view that the GHS has multiple meanings stemming out of differences registered in economic thinking, when we consider the spread of the school outside Germany (Tribe, 2000). Historicism was a brand of economic study that was imitated in different national settings. In the following chapters we start by considering the notion of a GHS as a heuristic device for taxonomic purposes, and we aim to clearly define what the GHS was about in different European countries. By focusing on economic policy we attempt to shed new light on a series of open questions in the literature. For us the GHS did exist, but it was not a closed shop with committed members and a “faith” in all things economic; it was about a belief in the historical method and the possibility of extracting developmental laws from historical experience. We will, therefore, contribute with the present volume to a refinement of the definition about the existence of a “GHS” in the history of economics. Europe in the late nineteenth century was in a stage of continuous transformation. Great empires, such as the Russian, the Habsburg and the Ottoman, were trying to cope with the economic consequences of the expansion of the world capitalist system. Other countries had engaged in nation building, such as Greece after 1830, Italy after 1861 and Bulgaria after 1878. The diversity of country experiences and case studies makes it impossible to follow a rigid approach throughout the present volume. A not exhaustive list of variations of this broad theme, to be addressed in the individual chapters that follow, includes: • •\n\nThrough which channels did the process of dissemination from Germany to other places in Europe occur? What was disseminated? The method, the rationale, the policy message, aspects of certain policy endorsements?\n\nIntroduction xxiii • • • • •\n\nWho were the main characters involved in the receiving side, what did they write and how did they disseminate historicism? Were they academics, intellectuals, publicists? How long did the influence of the GHS remain strong? How did it come to dominate, if it did, and when did it start to decline? What were the main economic policy issues in the countries where the tradition of the GHS got hold? Was legislation in these countries influenced by the teaching of the GHS? Are there particular authors in each of the countries deserving special attention for the innovative character of their contributions to spreading the message of the GHS? How can the legacy of the GHS in Europe be best defined?\n\nOur case studies Throughout the second half of the nineteenth century and the early decades of the twentieth century, European countries were facing new economic problems whose resolution implied the challenge of the usual way of dealing with social realities. The references to historical and cultural backgrounds to understand economic reality, as well as to address policy responses to economic and financial problems, were taken as a condition to improve the knowledge of changing societies. The richness of debates and fights among historians, economists and sociologists alike was not only a proof of intellectual vitality. It was also the revelation of the need to definitely include a new dimension in the study of economic phenomena, one that could not avoid the mention of culture and history as a means to capture the essence of economic behavior at both the individual and the institutional levels (cf. Bruhns, 2004). The dialogue on values and traditions was a common feature of the development of economic reasoning in the countries considered in this volume. The book begins with Austria, more precisely the German-speaking parts of the Austrian monarchy, the closest German neighbor, where, despite Schumpeter’s claim to the contrary, a significant influence of the GHS can be said to have existed. As Günther Chaloupek explains, Catholicism, realism and logical positivism were the currents of thought, when academics as Karl-Theodor von Inama-Sternegg and Carl Grünberg plowed the seeds of historical-empirical inquiry. The study of economic history was promoted not least by well-known later liberal economists, such as Karl Pribram. Even Carl Menger was not hostile to economic history. As Chaloupek argues, it was Schmoller’s “extremism” in Menger’s eyes that he found worth fighting against, whereas Schumpeter was the great Austrian economist who managed to bridge economic history with economic theory in a way that led to the diminishing of any Austrian historical school of economics. The chapter on France, authored by Jean-Pierre Potier, shows that though not well grounded in methodological terms, the influence of the GHS was more relevant than traditionally admitted. In fact, the alleged hostility of French liberal\n\nxxiv\n\nJosé Luís Cardoso and Michalis Psalidopoulos\n\neconomists towards nationalist and protectionist ideas did not prevent a critical assimilation of economic policy orientations – namely, concerning labor legislation. The appeal to develop statistical, empirical elements supporting economic analysis should also be taken as one of the features developed by French economists in convergence with the efforts of the German school. The frequency of quotations and the high number of translations of canonical GHS texts prove at least that the French environment was receptive to the circulation of German economic literature. The intellectual milieu in Belgium was naturally open and favorable to the assimilation of political economy texts produced by French authors. It is therefore remarkable, as stressed by Guido Erreygers and Maarten Van Dijck, that Belgian economists took the GHS teachings as a main source for the development of economic analysis in their country throughout the period 1870–1914. The interest in empirical research using historical data and statistical tools was one of the features that Belgian economists and historians learned during their frequent stays at German universities. The inspiration for the development of an institutional framework with capacity to promote innovative research and policy orientations is also worth referring to as one of the most enduring legacies of the GHS in Belgium. The Netherlands provides another example of a country that due to Schumpeter’s far-reaching statement is supposed to have been immune to historical economics. As Bert Tieben and Evert Schoorl, however, convincingly show, Protestant social thought and the debate on poor relief elevated Professor H.P.G. Quack to the status of the first historical Dutch economist, almost before the historical school debate started up. Posts at the state universities remained in the hands of followers of the classical paradigm, because of the centralized appointing system. Historical economics was popular in public opinion and political debates. Tieben and Schoorl follow the debate between orthodox and historical economists as it evolved from its beginnings to its intensification and to a rift that was impossible to reconcile despite the efforts of academics, such as, among others, H. B. Greven in Leyden. In the political arena things were more pronounced: the younger liberal MP Sam van Houten, a follower of the historical school (and a rejected candidate for the Leyden chair), initiated the first bill regulating child labor. Economists like Nicolaas G. Pierson and C. A. Verrijn and the Protestant political leader Abraham Kuyper left their mark in heated debates around social reform and its necessity for Dutch society. Only after 1900, in the two Amsterdam universities (the one municipal, the other Protestant) followers of the historical school were appointed to economics chairs. A final stage of symbiosis set in, with historical economics losing ground to the rigid neoclassicism dominant at the university level in the interwar period. In Italy, important economists such as Ferrara, Pantaleoni and Pareto championed a militant opposition against the antitheoretical and antiliberal features of the GHS. However, there were also strong reasons to emulate the German model of economic growth and to develop new fields of economic inquiry. The new methodological and empirical tools were also acclaimed, as Vitantonio Gioia\n\nIntroduction xxv points out in the chapter on the Italian case. But maybe the main reason to explain a somehow reduced adherence to the GHS was the propensity offered by the Italian cultural and political environment to accept the role of historical and empirical facts to explain the real economy and the inadequacy of preconceived abstract models. The acknowledgment of the role of the state and the relevance of economic policies to foster economic growth complete the global framework to explain the assimilation of the GHS in Italy. Political motivation is a strong factor explaining also the reception of German authors in Spain. In their contribution to this volume Jesús Astigarraga and Juan Zabalza give particular emphasis to the roots of this influence going back to the success of the cameralist influence in Spain in the late eighteenth century. It is likely that this powerful influence is at the origin of a long-lasting presence of German influences in the discussion of public administration and public finance issues. But it was above all the influence of national political economy in the Listian vein that paved the way to the scattered, though meaningful, presence of the successive generations of the GHS in Spain, especially in Catalonia, and particularly in relation to the design of protectionist economic policies. Another intellectual condition explaining the spread of German traditions was the extraordinary impact that Karl Krause’s ethical critique of classical political economy had on Spanish authors of the second half of the nineteenth century. A similar process of adherence through a variety of German sources is to be found in Portugal, as explained by António Almodovar and José Luís Cardoso. German historicist and law traditions were particularly active at the University of Coimbra, where the main supporters of the GHS are to be found throughout the second half of the nineteenth century. The proximity of policy orientations shared by both historicists and supporters of Katheder socialism serves to explain the instrumental nature of influences that were operated to criticize the universal dogmas of classical political economy and the need to rely on history to understand the opportunities of economic development with strong state intervention. Here again, we find that the main motivation to accept some of the tenets of the GHS had a political nature. To complete the picture of the reception of GHS in Southern European countries, Greece offers another example of the use of economic doctrines for catching up and promoting economic modernization, especially during the first decades of the twentieth century. Michalis Psalidopoulos and Yorgos Stassinopoulos emphasize the role of German influences in the shaping of a national strategy of economic development put forward by Greek authors who had learned their economics at German universities. The influence of these economists was longlived as they dominated economic discourse in the country until the mid-1960s, whereas the historical method was seen as an important tool of analysis even by liberal economists, such as Andreas Andréadès and Xenophon Zolotas. The attention paid to historical factors, such as the warlike conditions in the 1910s, and to practical problems to be solved, such as the refugee problem after 1922, was, of course, another sign of sharing common concerns. But the use of German references of authority served the basic purpose of gradually escaping from\n\nxxvi\n\nJosé Luís Cardoso and Michalis Psalidopoulos\n\nliberal doctrines of the nineteenth century and smoothly moving to the defense of protectionism and state intervention as the chief conditions to promote economic sustainability and social tranquility in the long run. In the case of Turkey, as Eyüp Özveren demonstrates, historicism entered the scene through the intermediation of Russia and in direct relation to the national economy approach espoused by the father of Turkish nationalism Ziya Gökalp. The case of the journal Kadro in the 1920s and various authors therein is discussed, as is their affiliation with Istanbul University, which assisted them in attacking from an authority perspective the more liberal academics of schools for public servants. Then in 1933 German émigré economists, such as Fritz Neumark, Wilhelm Röpke, Alexander Rüstow and others, brought into the country their own versions of historicism and liberalism, interacting with Turkish economists in the search for industrialization plans for their country. Özveren discusses the legacy of these German refugees in Turkey with detailed reference of various existing sources. Their bottom line is a relativist plea for understanding processes of dissemination of economic ideas. When moving towards Northern European countries, one faces a comparable absence of a genuine school of thought faithful to the original precepts of the GHS. In the case of Sweden, presented in this volume by Benny Carlson, it is nevertheless clear that the permanence of Swedish authors in German universities, under the supervision of GHS disciples, was of an utmost importance to the development of new economic approaches during the three last decades of the nineteenth century. Not all of the Swedish authors of the period were thrilled by the advantages of the historical method. The fields of enquiry where they proved more receptive to the GHS lessons were those associated with the improvement of economic and social policies claiming for a stronger state intervention. The political message was a parallel motivation that could accommodate the conventional obedience to universally accepted principles of political economy. The chapter on Russia by Vladimir Avtonomov and Georgy Gloveli follows the import of political economy since the times of the older GHS when Ivan Babst and Alexander Korsak adopted evolutionary and historical patterns of economic reasoning. At the peak of fame for the younger GHS Alexander Chuprov and Ivan Yanzul undertook together with other younger economists the task of continuing and modernizing the historist tradition in Russia. Avtonomov and Gloveli turn then their attention to Russian ministers of finance and to social policy makers as they espoused a similar approach in their everyday decisions. They also discuss Russian Marxism as well as two authors at the dawn of the twentieth century, Iosif Kulisher, an industrial, and Nikolay Oganovsky, an agricultural expert on Russian development, and their respective contributions. Finally Nikolay Nenovsky and Pencho Penchev present the evolution of the GHS in Bulgaria. From independence to the end of World War I the most prominent Bulgarian economists were French-trained Grigor Nachovich, Englishtrained Ivan Geshov and German-trained Georgi Danailov, who brought in the\n\nIntroduction xxvii country various strands of thought and a concern for the development and welfare of the Bulgarian people. World War I and its devastating effects for the country brought pluralism in economic approaches to the forefront for ultraliberals and Marxists. The careers and publications of Konstantin Bobchev, Alexander Tsankov and Ivan Kinkel are discussed and their work put into perspective as it marks the heyday of the influence of the GHS in the country.\n\nConclusions The study of the dissemination and transmission of economic ideas is a complex issue (Cardoso, 2003; Goodwin & Holley, 1968; Spengler, 1970). Ideas are not commodities to be sold and bought for the purposes of trade, and their emergence does not simulate market processes where “[n]ew ideas are sold very much the way new automobiles are sold: by exaggerating their superiority over the older models” (Stigler, 1969: 222). Moreover, the logic of the history of ideas cannot entirely unfold by analyzing their meanings solely from a historical perspective (Bevir, 1999), since ideas are not only means for the comprehension and appreciation of reality founded on facts but also instruments and occasionally fighting devices against false perceptions of “reality”, for the interpretation and arrangement of socioeconomic and political conditions, acting hence as normative guiding rules for the preservation or the transformation of the real world. Furthermore, the international diffusion of theories requires a complex historical and doctrinal approach that focuses more on which ideas dominate the intellectual field and their effects on social and political processes “underlying the transmission of ideas from culture to culture and from nation to nation” (Spengler, 1970: 133). The foregoing reservations do not imply the impossibility of getting any historical meaning out of the emergence and propagation of ideas, but intend to demonstrate the limitations of the rationalist approaches that seek to reconstruct the birth and dissemination of historical objects and their true meaning on the basis of the available historical material, disregarding the inherent constraints that mine the field and make “any easy generalization difficult, even impossible” (Kurz, Nishizawa & Tribe, 2011: 3). The chapters in this volume, adopting a relativist stance, demonstrate that contrary to some existing sources, the GHS was quite influential even in countries that had a long academic tradition in abstract economic reasoning. Harald Hagemann’s final chapter reflects on this topic and provides an overall assessment of this set of contributions. As economic conditions prevailing in most less developed European countries were changing, it seems that the more in need of catching up, the more the historical method was put to use to work out strategies of deliberate industrialization and development in various countries. In the long run, however, neoclassicism prevailed, both on method and on the question of a value-free economics. This state of affairs was to be challenged after the Great Depression by Keynesianism. This is, however, a different chapter in the history of economic ideas and their diffusion.\n\nxxviii\n\nJosé Luís Cardoso and Michalis Psalidopoulos\n\nReferences Acemoglu, D. & Robinson J. A.

Being the largest and most powerful territorial state of the German Reich, the Habsburg monarchy was an attractive workplace for mercantilist economists from other parts of the Reich (Becher, Schröder, Hörnigk, Justi). In 1763 Joseph von Sonnenfels, author of the textbook Grundsätze der Polizey, Handlung und Finanz (3 vols., 1765–1776), was appointed to the newly established chair for administrative and cameral sciences at the University of Vienna. With strict state control over university teaching before 1848, reception of classical economics was delayed considerably, so that Austrian participation in the lively development of economics in Germany1 in the first half of the nineteenth century was rather weak and belated. Austria took a route different from Germany in the human sciences, not only in economics but also in philosophy and history. Whereas for many decades during the nineteenth century, German philosophy was dominated by Hegel’s idealism and historicism, and later by the anti-Hegelian reaction, in Austria Catholicism, realism and logical positivism were the prevailing currents of thought. In the same vein, Austria lacked anything comparable to the broad-based movement of Historismus that dominated human sciences in Germany in general (law – Savigny, history – Niebuhr, Ranke, Droysen) from the early 1800s.2 If the origins of the German Historical School (GHS) date back to the middle of the century, at that time in Austria the state of economics was clearly underdeveloped. The universities’ teaching staff consisted mostly of rather obscure scholars, except for Lorenz von Stein, who had been appointed to the chair at the University of Vienna (previously held by Sonnenfels and Josef Kudler) in 1855. Hence, there is no parallel movement to the older, so-called first-generation historical school (Roscher, Knies, Hildebrand) in Austria. After the appointment of Albert Schäffle (1868) and of Carl Menger (1871) at the University of Vienna, the historical school (HS) had a late start in Austria in 1868 with the call of Theodor Inama von Sternegg to the University of Innsbruck. Thereafter, the HS established itself and gained strength in the academic as well as in the political\n\n2\n\nGünther Chaloupek\n\nsphere under the influence of two leading figures: Karl Theodor von InamaSternegg and Carl Grünberg.\n\nThe leading scholars: Inama-Sternegg and Grünberg Inama-Sternegg3 In 1868, Karl Theodor von Inama-Sternegg was appointed to the chair of state science at the University of Innsbruck. Born 1843 in Augsburg, Bavaria, he had studied law and state sciences at the University of Munich, where he was habilitated in 1868. Descended from an old South Tyrolian family, he followed the call from his home country. At the University of Innsbruck the preferred subject of Inama’s economic studies was history of the medieval economy. His studies on the formation of manorial estates and its system of administration in the early Middle Ages (Inama-Sternegg 1872, 1878) were widely quoted and discussed in the economic history literature.4 Of Inama’s most encompassing work, Deutsche Wirtschaftsgeschichte, which covers the economic development of Germany during the Middle Ages, only the first volume was completed when he left Innsbruck; Volumes 2 and 3 were published in 1891 and 1901, respectively. He is credited for having coined the term Wirtschaftsgeschichte. From Innsbruck Inama moved to the more prestigious University of Prague in 1880. In 1881, Inama-Sternegg left his academic post and became director of the Bureau for Administrative Statistics. In 1884 he was elevated to the prestigious position of president of the Austrian Central Statistical Commission. At the same time he was honorary professor and director of statistical studies at the University of Vienna. In addition, he lectured on administrative sciences (Verwaltungslehre) after Lorenz von Stein’s retirement (1885). Without establishing a “school” of his own, Inama trained his students primarily for service in the statistical office, from which many advanced to important positions in the administration and in the universities. Inama retired from his post as president of the Statistical Commission in 1905 and died in 1908, just after having completed a revision of Volume 1 of his Deutsche Wirtschaftsgeschichte. As economist and statistician Inama represented the kind of unity of theory and practice which was so important to the German “socialists of the chair” (Kathedersozialisten). He acquired considerable reputation as the organizer of a modern statistical system in Austria. He was equally concerned with issues of social policy and engaged himself actively in the organization of poor relief by serving as president of an association against poverty and begging.5 Inama became an active politician when he was appointed member of the upper chamber of the Austrian parliament by the emperor in 1891, where he supported social reforms and the introduction of general franchise (for men) in 1907. For his general approach, Inama aimed at a synthesis between historicalempirical investigation and classical – that is the Smithian type of economic\n\nEvolution of economic thought in Austria 3 theory. He followed Lorenz von Stein6 in his high appreciation of Adam Smith’s achievements in the “investigation of the fundamental relationships in the world of goods (Güterwelt)” as a lasting contribution to economics as a social science. Like Stein, Inama accepted “self-interest as the guide for the best use of labour and capital.” However, Smith’s view of the economy suffered from a principal deficiency. If there are general economic laws rooted in the “immutable relationship between man and nature”, their effects vary according to changing social, institutional, legal and political circumstances. In his Wealth of Nations, Smith pays insufficient attention to the changeability of conditions under which goods production takes place. More importantly, he does not provide a viable starting point for analyzing what can be attributed to the nature of man or to human nature’s concrete manifestations under specific historically given conditions (Inama-Sternegg 1876: 13ff.). The HS deserves credit for correcting this onesidedness of classical economic theory. Inama is in agreement with Schmoller, who rightly demonstrates “the aberrations of the individualistic economic theory” – that is the Austrian Schools paradigm, which Schumpeter called “methodological individualism” (Inama-Sternegg 1908: 107). As “collective phenomena” economic facts and processes have a logic of their own, they are not “mere aggregates of individual actions” (ibidem: 97). Yet, in Inama’s view Schmoller goes too far in his attempt to demonstrate the social determinedness of man’s economic actions. In his endeavour to trace economic behaviour to varying psychological, biological, racial, ethnical, geographical and educational conditions, Schmoller puts too great a strain on economics, with the unsatisfactory result that he produces “only fragments of a general theory of society which are often superficial explanations of an immature sociology”, which tend to spoil the achievements of Schmoller’s Grundrisse (ibidem: 109). Instead, Inama pleads for sticking to the existing specialization among the social sciences. Whereas for Schmoller progress of economic knowledge is the product of detailed historical studies of concrete subjects, Inama points to the merits of the “method of isolation” – that is the formulation of abstract hypotheses, which has a major share in the achievements of economics as a social science (Inama-Sternegg 1876: 28). If, therefore, Inama’s understanding of economic method is different from Schmoller’s extreme inductivism, his views somehow anticipate the modification which Sombart and the members of the third generation of the GHS considered necessary for an appropriate application of the historical method. But with these qualifications, Inama thought that sound economic knowledge must be based on detailed historical research and the gathering of statistical data, in order to support hypothetical judgments based on scattered observations. In addition, “descriptive economics” is an important source of knowledge where representation in quantitative terms is impossible (Inama-Sternegg 1908: 105). As president of Austria’s statistical office, Inama emphasized that working with original historical data should meet the same technical and professional standards which apply to current statistics (Inama-Sternegg 1903: 275). As far as capacities permitted, he supported such efforts from members of the staff who published\n\n4\n\nGünther Chaloupek\n\na large number of historical statistics in the official media of the Central Commission as well as in personal publications. Inama had only limited ambitions in economic theorizing. As a consequence of his interest in the “Social Question” and his favourable attitude towards social policies, his main interest lay in the theory of rent formation.7 On the basis of the theoretical approaches of Ricardo and Schmoller, he extended the concept of rent beyond land to goods production, national and international trade and even to national economies, which he saw as collective economic entities competing with each other. He was also interested in monopoly theory and in the organization of markets, and in tendencies and determinants of long-term economic development. He used rather simple analytical concepts taken from classical economics, without being interested in subjecting them to critical discussion. Inama published two volumes of collected essays at the end of his career. He did not write a general tract containing his theoretical views in a systematized form. Inama’s duties as president of the statistical office did not permit him to write longer studies in economic history apart from the time-consuming completion of his work on the German economy during the Middle Ages. His statistical publications include studies on the possession of real property and on wages of workers in agriculture. Carl Grünberg8 By his date of birth Grünberg belongs to the age group of the authors of the third generation of the GHS. Born 1861 in a Jewish family in Focsany, Rumania, Grünberg moved to Austria. After having completed the gymnasium in Czernowitz, he studied law and state sciences under Lorenz von Stein and Anton Menger at the University of Vienna. Under the influence of Anton Menger Grünberg had come to sympathize with socialist ideas. While working in a private law firm, Grünberg started with extensive studies in agricultural history at the University of Strasbourg under the tutorship of G. F. Knapp. He was habilitated in Strasbourg in 1893. His appointment to extraordinary professor at the University of Vienna in 1899 was supported by Eugen von Philipovich, one of the few Kathedersozialisten among the Austrian School. A joint motion of Philipovich, Friedrich Wieser and Heinrich Lammasch to promote Grünberg to ordinary professor was turned down twice by the majority of the law faculty, but was finally accepted in 1909. Thus, Grünberg was the first avowed Marxist who obtained a full professorship at a university in Austria and Germany. Similar to Inama’s, Grünberg’s first subject of research was in agricultural history. In the tradition of the GHS, in particular of Knapp’s work on peasant emancipation and land reform in Prussia, he wrote a voluminous study on peasant emancipation and the dissolution of hereditary subjection in the Austrian crownlands Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia (Grünberg 1894). Grünberg’s continued interest in the process of peasant emancipation resulted in a variety of publications (see especially Grünberg 1899, 1922) in which he carefully described\n\nEvolution of economic thought in Austria 5 and analyzed the different forms of land tenure and the successive legislative steps that gave peasants full ownership of their property and changed their status from personal subjection to citizenship. Going beyond Menger’s “lawyers’ socialism” (“Juristensozialismus”) he created a distinctive version of Marxian historical materialism which, in its methodological orientation, adopts a teleological view of history, like the younger GHS. Grünberg defined himself as “Marxist”, yet he did not accept the truth of Marxist economic and social doctrines for deductive reasons, but emphasized the necessity of subjecting them to empirical validation. He was rightly characterized as “Kathedermarxist” (Marxist of the chair), as opposed to the Kathedersocialists, who rejected both Marxism and the socialist movement. Grünberg applied his historicist approach to socialism and the labour movement. In 1910 he founded the famous “Archiv für die Geschichte des Sozialismus und der Arbeiterbewegung”, to which he contributed many articles. The programmatic orientation of the journal was to encourage research that “enhances pragmatic knowledge” of the evolution of socialist thought and the labour movement, “its positive and negative influence on economic theory and policy, on the philosophy of law and state science, and the other way round” – that is the influence of the latter on socialism (Grünberg 1910: 11). Among Grünberg’s students are the most important representatives of Austro-Marxism (Karl Renner, Otto Bauer, Rudolf Hilferding, Max Adler, Friedrich Adler). He entertained a close relationship to Social Democratic Party and its leader Victor Adler, but he became a member only in 1919. In cooperation with Victor Adler and professors of the University of Vienna (among them Philippovich and the historian Ludo Hartmann) Grünberg founded the nonpartisan “Sozialwissenschaftlicher Bildungsverein”, in order to bridge the gap between the academic institutions and the labour movement. Grünberg also actively engaged himself in the formation of community colleges (Volkshochschulen) to improve levels of knowledge and education of the working population. After the war, Grünberg’s venia was augmented to include economic policy. He was appointed to director of the university’s institute for state sciences by the short-term social democratic minister of education Otto Glöckel. When Grünberg’s project to establish a “social museum” in combination with an institute for social research failed, he left Vienna in 1924, accepting a call from Frankfurt to become director of the newly established Institut für Sozialforschung, a position combined with a chair at the University of Frankfurt. He was forced to retire after a stroke in 1930, from which he never recovered. Grünberg died in 1940. Max Horkheimer became Grünberg’s successor as director of the Frankfurt institute, while Adolph Löwe took Grünberg’s chair at the university. Grünberg’s most visible impact in Austria stems from his role as mentor9 of the authors of the essential works of Austro-Marxist literature. But of the large number of studies of Grünberg’s students, many were written in the true spirit of the HS without being committed to Marxism.10\n\n6\n\nGünther Chaloupek\n\nStudies in economic history Monographs and sectoral studies Initiated mostly by Inama and later by Grünberg, an increasing number of studies in economic history were published starting in the 1880s, with the main body of this research coming forward after the turn of the century. There were two series which served the publication of these studies: the Wiener Staatswissenschaftliche Studien, starting in 1898, edited by Philippovich and the legal scholar Edmund Bernatzik, and the Studien zur Sozial-, Wirtschafts- und Verwaltungsgeschichte, starting in 1905, edited by Carl Grünberg. Besides that, there was the Zeitschrift für Volkswirtschaft, Sozialpolitik und Verwaltung (1892–1918), and after World War I Zeitschrift für Volkswirtschaft und Sozialpolitik (1921–1927), which was open for contributions from economists of various theoretical orientations. The special studies of the Austrian historicist economists were primarily devoted to subjects of Austria’s economic development during the eras of mercantilism and industrialization in the nineteenth century. Generally, economic modernization was considered a crucial prerequisite if the Habsburg monarchy wanted to solve the problems resulting from pronounced diversity and heterogeneity of its provinces, and to preserve its status as a major European power. Besides that, issues of social policy were favourite subjects of research. Compared to Western European countries, the Habsburg monarchy was a latecomer in economic development. Of the crownlands, Bohemia and Lower Austria (including the city of Vienna) were industrialized at the end of the nineteenth century, while agriculture was still dominant, especially in the eastern part of the empire. Progress in industrial development was the most important subject of the studies in economic history. Studies on commercial and industrial policies, like Max Adler’s11 (1903) book on the beginnings of mercantilist commercial policy before Empress Maria Theresia, show the efforts of the government to promote new industries and to remove the obstacles with which they were confronted, especially from traditional craft gilds. Helene Landau’s (1906) monograph, written under Grünberg’s supervision, describes and analyzes the policies aimed at creating a unified market within the Austrian part of the monarchy in order to facilitate the sale of industrial products across all provinces12 written under Grünberg’s supervision. Other studies focused on particular projects, such as Hans J. Hatschek’s (1886) monograph on Johann Joachim Becher’s Viennese manufacturing plant, and the monograph on the development of the silk industry in Vienna, Bohemia and in the southern provinces by Helene Deutsch (1909). Henryk Grossmann13 (1916) analyzes the development of population structure and the state of manufacturing in the light of early population and industrial surveys in the eighteenth century. Explicitly or implicitly, the authors of these studies take a positive attitude towards policies that promote protoindustrial enterprises and strengthen their competitive position vis á vis the craft gilds. The authors of the HS in Austria do not share the predilection of part of the GHS for medieval craft gilds and the economy of medieval towns as objects of\n\nEvolution of economic thought in Austria 7 research, nor their concern with the survival of the small crafts (Handwerk) in an industrializing economy. The reason behind this difference is that cities in the Habsburg crownlands were under the jurisdiction of the prince, without the independence of German Reichsstädte like Nürnberg or Hamburg. In his study on the situation of the crafts in Austria Emanuel Adler (1898) does not support the demands of the crafts’ movement (Handwerkerbewegung) to reintroduce restrictions for competition which had been abolished by the liberal Gewerbeordnung (small businesses act) of 1859. Instead, he suggests the crafts should improve their competitive position through the foundation of cooperatives to facilitate credit and cheaper purchase of materials. Rudolf Klimburg’s (1900) monograph on the development of vocational education demonstrates the important contribution of various forms of vocational schools at the secondary level for Austria’s industrial development. Studies in the agricultural economy are almost solely focused on the efforts to reform the system of land tenure, with the final step towards peasant emancipation and exoneration of their land from duties and obligation in 1848. Both the final law and its execution, which was a demanding exercise for the bureaucracy, were praised as successful operations by Grünberg (1899). In addition to the aforementioned studies by Grünberg and Inama, there is the massive study by Walther Schiff14 (1898) and the monograph on land tenure and peasant emancipation in Galicia by Ludwig von Mises (1902). In his memoirs Mises remarks that he has tried to not to follow Grünberg (1894), whose concentration on the legal side of peasant emancipation Mises considered too narrow (Mises 1978: 6–7). He says that in his essay on the early Austrian factory laws (Mises 1905) genuine economic history is still coming up short against administrative history. Remarkably, yet, in the latter essay Mises took a very favourable attitude towards social policy measures. In particular, he praised an edict of Emperor Joseph II of 1786 which imposed heavy requirements on child labour as a unique act, as it was enacted 16 years ahead of the Morals and Health Act in England (Mises 1905: 231). Schiff wrote historical studies on child labour (1913) and accident insurance. He was appointed director of the staff of the newly established office of labour statistics (Arbeitsstatistisches Amt) in 1908. There he prepared and executed the first consumption survey, which served as a basis for automatic wage adjustments during the postwar inflation period in Austria. Grünberg’s advice is respectfully recognized by the author of the first comprehensive history of the trade union movement in Austria, Julius Deutsch (1908). If Deutsch was a functionary of the Social Democratic Party, his book also breathes the spirit of historicist economics. Karl Pribram15 The most important monograph is Karl Pribram’s impressive Geschichte der österreichischen Gewerbepolitik 1740–1798 (1907), written under the supervision of Carl Grünberg. The book goes far beyond the description and analysis of commercial policy measures during the reign of Empress Maria Theresia and\n\n8\n\nGünther Chaloupek\n\nher successors. Pribram starts with a presentation of economic concepts that underlie the political strategies during the various phases of development. In dealing with the changing ideas upon which policies were built, Pribram discusses the teachings and recommendations not only of major mercantilist economists, like J.H.G. Justi and J. von Sonnenfels, but also of forgotten authors who introduced Adam Smith’s economic liberalism into the debate that took place among Austrian bureaucrats and businessmen. Based on meticulous archival studies, Pribram gives an account of the political endeavours of the administration to create an economic base capable of sustaining the aspirations of the Habsburg monarchy as a European imperial power. Pribram is always careful to give a balanced judgment when he evaluates successes and failures of approaches and measures, which oscillated between tight interventionism and more reliance on market forces. Pribram did not follow his original intention to write a second part covering the remaining period until 1860. At least partially Johann Slokar’s16 voluminous Geschichte der österreichischen Industrie und ihrer Förderung unter Kaiser Franz I is a continuation of Pribram’s work (until 1835). The book was commissioned by a group of Austrian industrialists with the intention to demonstrate Austria’s industrial traditions and capacities in historical perspective. Slokar’s book does not have the wide scope and multidimensional approach of Pribram’s, concentrating primarily on detailed sectoral developments and concrete policy measures. Karl Pribram’s later work is divided between social policy, statistics, history of economic theory and social philosophy. In his brochure on the origins of the individualistic social philosophy (Pribram 1912) he juxtaposed nominalism and universalism as basic paradigms not only in epistemology but also for political theory, with nominalism corresponding to liberalism, and universalism corresponding to collectivism and organicism. Thus, in the debate between Menger and Schmoller, Pribram stands firmly on the side of the Austrian School, rejecting Schmoller’s inductivism as well as his emphasis on an “organic” relationship between economic and social phenomena (Pribram 1983: 220). And yet, Pribram had a higher appreciation of the significance of historical and empirical work for economic theory than Menger and his followers. By this, he developed his own synthesis between historicism and economics of the Austrian School. As director of the legislative division of the Austrian ministry for social affairs, Pribram played an important role in the wave of social policy legislation after World War I (Pribram 1921).\n\nStudies in the history of economic theory Most studies on economic development of the Habsburg monarchy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries contain parts on the concepts of mercantilist authors which they proposed to the Austrian authorities. Except for Sonnenfels, they came from other states of the German empire, eager to see their ideas implemented in the greatest territorial state of the Reich.\n\nEvolution of economic thought in Austria 9 Encouraged by Grünberg, Louise Sommer (1920, 1925) wrote a comprehensive study about the work of mercantilist (cameralist) economists in their service to the Habsburg monarchy in the seventeenth and ei"
