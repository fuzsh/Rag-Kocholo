Professor Johannes Winckelmann, the editor of Weber’s works, accorded me the hospitality of the Max Weber Institute in Munich for two periods in 1971-2, to study the extensive secondary literature on Weber. Professor Wolfgang Mommsen, well known for his writings on Weber’s political thought, gave me the opportunity of discussing Weber with him, and made helpful comments on Chapter 5 of the present study. Although in the following pages I am critical of both scholars, this does not lessen my debt to their work. I am grateful to colleagues in Manchester, in particular to Geraint Parry and Norman Geras, for their comments and criticisms on various drafts of this work. Mrs Thelma Wright did a splendid job in typing the manuscript, and my wife Margaret gave me untiring support in the course of its production.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nThe following abbreviations are used in the text.

As a political commentator and propagandist, he is less well known to English readers. Besides his work as an academic sociologist, Weber involved himself actively in the politics of his time. In her biography of her husband, Marianne Weber devotes as much space to his political views and activities as she does to an account of his academic work.1 At the outset of his career, she tells us, he expressed a clear preference for the active over the contemplative life;2 on more than one occasion politics beckoned as a serious possible alternative to scholarship;3 on the last of these occasions, at the end of the war, it was only the shortsightedness of others that prevented him attaining the position of national leadership that his gifts of statesmanship merited.4 Admittedly, here as elsewhere, Marianne Weber carries her devotion too far. Her husband’s commitment to academic values was too deeply rooted for a transition to the role of politician to have been a natural one. As he explained himself in a letter to Karl Petersen at the time of his resignation from the national committee of the German Democratic Party in 1920: The politician has to make compromises; that is his job. But my calling is that of a scholar. . . . The scholar may not compromise, or allow ‘nonsense’ to remain unexposed.5 Yet if Weber regarded the values of the scholar and the role of the politician as incompatible, he was nevertheless active throughout his life as a political commentator and polemicist, an ‘exposer of nonsense’. The scope of his writings in this field is remarkable, ranging from his early analyses of social and political change in East Prussia, through book-length articles on the 1905 Russian revolution, to his sustained polemics on the reform of the German\n\n14\n\nMAX WEBER AND THE THEORY OF MODERN POLITICS\n\nconstitution in the wartime and postwar period. These writings remain mostly untranslated, yet they are important to any complete assessment of Weber as a social and political theorist. The purpose of this book is to provide a systematic account of Weber’s theory of modern politics, in which primacy of emphasis is given to these writings on contemporary politics and political issues, rather than to the more familiar sociological work of Economy and Society. These writings have received close attention in the German literature on Weber, where they have been the subject of considerable controversy. Wolfgang Mommsen’s book on Max Weber and German politics,6 published in 1959, provoked a sharp reaction to its emphasis on the nationalist and elitist elements in Weber’s political thought.7 This disagreement was reinforced at the Weber centenary meeting of the German Sociological Association in 1964, in response to Raymond Aron’s paper ‘Max Weber und die Machtpolitik’,8 and it has continued ever since. The issues involved in this debate are of some importance, and will be discussed at various points in the present work; indeed, it is impossible to write about Weber’s political thought without taking up a position on the genuineness of his commitment to parliamentary democracy, and on the relative strengths of the liberal and nationalist element in his political philosophy. In relation to this controversy the present study will argue that both sides to the debate suffer from being over-simplistic. The character of Weber’s nationalism was more subtle than Mommsen allows, while on the other side Weber’s defenders fail to make clear what kind of ‘liberalism’ he was committed to, and ignore the tension between this liberalism and his other values. At the same time it should be said that this controversy over Weber’s political values has had the effect of concentrating attention on one aspect only of his political writings: on what they reveal of his political outlook, and of the particular standpoints he adopted on the changing issues of German politics. In the process their significance as examples of political analysis, and for what they show of Weber as an empirical theorist of politics, has been largely ignored. No systematic study of Weber’s political writings from this point of view has yet been made, to show how he analyses the interplay of social forces in a particular society, and to elucidate the general assumptions embodied in this analysis: assumptions about the possible forms of government and political activity, about the relationship between society and state, about the character of modern politics in general. It is this aspect of the political writings that is especially relevant to a total assessment of Weber\n\nMAX WEBER AS POLITICAL THEORIST\n\n15\n\nas a political theorist, since it transcends the particular issues of German politics that he was concerned with. Just as Karl Marx’s occasional writings (The Eighteenth Brumaire,’ etc) provide important evidence about his method of political analysis and the character of his political theory, the same is true of Weber also. The significance of Weber’s political writings gains additional emphasis in view of the limited framework within which politics is considered in his major work on sociological theory, Economy and Society. This work is broadly historical in conception, and its treatment of politics is dominated by two contrasting models which Weber regarded as being of fundamental historical significance: first, the contrast between traditional and rational forms of social structure, which served to define the characteristic uniqueness of modern society; secondly, the more universal contrast between the ‘Alltag’ (everyday) and the ‘Ausseralltag’ (exceptional), between the routine structures of everyday administration on the one hand, and the innovative power of charisma on the other. From both sets of perspectives, bureaucratic administration is defined as the central phenomenon of modern society, and understanding its character as a central issue in sociological theory. There is no wish here to deny the importance of Weber’s analysis of bureaucracy in Economy and Society, but at least it can be said that it does not amount to a theory of politics. In the whole work there is little about politics as Weber himself defined it (‘the struggle to share or influence the distribution of power, whether between states or among the groups within a state’),9 little about social conflict or the way this is mediated or suppressed by different systems of government. There is little even about the wider social and political context in which modern bureaucracy operates. It is here that the significance of Weber’s political writings is most apparent. They are rich in themes that are absent from his sociological work: on the struggle for power within society; on the development of political leadership; on the character of modern democracy; on the effects of international conflict on national political structures and vice versa. Above all, Weber’s writings on the politics of Germany and Russia offer an analysis, unique in Weber, of the interaction between society and state. The importance of this can be readily shown in his treatment of bureaucracy. In Economy and Society bureaucracy is presented as an abstract model, considered largely in isolation from the social and political process. In the political writings bureaucracy is set in its social and political context, and in so doing Weber develops a theory of its inherent limitations and of its interaction with other social\n\n16\n\nMAX WEBER AND THE THEORY OF MODERN POLITICS\n\nforces and groups. Such material can not only be seen as complementary to Weber’s academic work; it also raises questions about the nature and limitations of his sociology, and emphasises the different view of society he held, when seen from the standpoint of political practice. In order to demonstrate the theoretical significance of Weber’s political writings, their treatment in the present work will be thematic, rather than historical, as in Mommsen’s book, or anecdotal, as in the books by J P Mayer and Ilse Dronberger.10 This does not mean that questions of historical context or of the development in Weber’s thought will be ignored, only that such questions will be treated within an overall synoptic framework. The central theme of the book will be that of modern politics itself: what Weber considered its distinctive features and problems to be. If it may seem odd to look to his political as much as his academic writings for such a theory, it is important to remember that, for Weber, knowledge was not merely the preserve of a scientific context; it also formed a necessary basis for effective action. A reiterated concern of his political writings was the necessity of achieving a clear understanding of the character of modern politics as a prerequisite to realistic policy and practice. In what follows, central elements in Weber’s conception of the modern state and modern politics will be considered in turn from this standpoint: bureaucratic administration; mass political involvement; national conflict; the social context of capitalism and class. Separate chapters will be devoted to each of these themes. They will not, however, be treated solely on an empirical level, as if they could be divorced from the explicitly evaluative framework of Weber’s political concerns. It is not only what Weber saw as characteristic of modern politics that will be considered, but what he saw as problematic about it from the standpoint of his own values. In this work, then, we are interested in Weber’s political writings, not primarily as a chronicle of the successive positions he took up on the issues of German politics, but for what they reveal of Weber as a political theorist. We are interested in them as examples of political analysis, and for what that analysis shows about Weber’s conception of modern politics and what he conceived to be problematic about it. The book will aim to discuss these themes in a systematic way, so as to facilitate comparison with Weber’s more familiar treatment of politics in his sociological work. The last chapter will offer a critique of Weber’s sociology on the basis of that comparison.\n\nMAX WEBER AS POLITICAL THEORIST\n\n17\n\nBefore proceeding, however, it is necessary to answer a number of preliminary questions. First, what are the political writings which are being discussed here? Secondly, how far can they be treated in the theoretical manner outlined ? Thirdly, what kind of relationship is being argued for here between Weber’s political and academic writings? These questions will be considered briefly in the remainder of this chapter. WEBER’S POLITICAL WRITINGS\n\nThe political writings which form the main subject of this book embrace a diversity of types of writing, from brief items of correspondence to extended articles of book length. There is no simple principle of classification in terms of which they can be considered. One distinction commonly made in German is between issues of ‘Sozialpolitik’ and ‘Staatspolitik’, between writings on the ‘social question’ (the condition of the working class) and those on political subjects proper, involving the interests and structure of the state. The collected volumes of Weber’s works, edited posthumously by his wife, are ordered according to this distinction. It was, however, a characteristic of Weber’s approach, that issues which others regarded as exclusively social became for him essentially political, so the distinction can at best be only a rough and ready one. The overlap between the two kinds of question is evident in Weber’s writings on East Prussia, and these will provide a convenient starting point. The two sets of investigations Weber completed in the early 1890s for the Verein fur Sozialpolitik (Association for Social Policy) and the Evangelisch-soziale Kongress (Protestant Social Congress) were decisive for establishing his academic reputation.11 Conceived initially as studies on social policy—the condition of agricultural labourers—they developed into a wide-ranging socio-political analysis of the changing relationship between landowners and labourers under the influence of capitalism, and the consequences of this change for the structure of the state and for national interests in the face of Polish immigration. The amount of material Weber derived from these investigations is impressive. Besides the publication of the massive Verein study itself, he devoted a succession of academic articles to setting out its wider implications;12 and the material also formed the basis for a number of weighty political speeches, ranging from an address to the Protestant Social Congress on the nature of capitalism and the aspirations of the working class,13 to\n\n18\n\nMAX WEBER AND THE THEORY OF MODERN POLITICS\n\nhis inaugural lecture at Freiburg on the significance of the national interest as a goal for political economy.14 As examples of sociopolitical analysis, as well as an expression of Weber’s political values, these early articles and speeches are important, and will be considered at various points in the present study. At the same time, something should be said here about the two organisations which provided the context for Weber’s early work, the Verein fiir Sozialpolitik and the Evangelisch-soziale Kongress respectively. Weber’s association with the Verein fiir Sozialpolitik and his concern with the ‘social question’ date from 1887, and mark a decisive break with the National-liberal orientation of his father.15 The Verein was an association dominated by academics, whose purpose was to promote peaceful social reform by research and propaganda for a social policy which lay midway between the ‘extremes’ of laissez-faire Manchesterism and revolutionary Marxism.16 It prided itself on being above class and party, though its members showed a general commitment to improving the lot of the working class, as being the only means to close the gap between the social strata and avoid the dangerous alienation of the workers from society. Its chosen instrument was the research monograph, and over the years its members produced an impressive documentation of social conditions in Germany, an ‘enormous sandheap of social knowledge’ as Rosa Luxemburg unkindly described it.17 The biennial conferences, besides providing a forum for discussing the weighty volumes of research, were also the scene of intense political debate. In the words of Gustav Schmoller, a founder and father figure of the association, the Verein existed ‘to bring the truth to light, to create a greater awareness of social affairs among all parties and classes ... to smooth the way for those ideals of practicable social reform that are so eminently justifiable’.18 The history of the Verein was one of some tension between its academic and propagandist purposes. In practice, the refusal of the association to ally itself with any party or class denied it the political effectiveness such as the Fabians achieved in Britain, while its practical orientation offended those, like Max Weber in his later period, who believed that an academic association should not be confined to people who shared one political viewpoint, however broadly defined. Weber’s disaffection with the Verein in his later years, which culminated in his helping to found the German Sociological Society in 1909 and in the famous debate on value freedom, are the best known aspects of his relationship with\n\nMAX WEBER AS POLITICAL THEORIST\n\n19\n\nthe association.19 Yet the Verein also served as an important context for the development and expression of Weber’s political views. Some of his most significant pronouncements on bureaucracy, on socialism and social democracy, on industrial relations and the character of the German state, were made in speeches to meetings of the Verein between 1905 and 1911.20 The memorandum he sent to members of the Verein in 1912, seeking to stimulate a new initiative in welfare legislation, forms his most complete statement on social policy.21 And other articles he wrote on aspects of social affairs, even where not under the aegis of the Verein itself, can best be understood against the background of the association and the controversy between its different political groupings. These controversies have been analysed in a book by Dieter Lindenlaub, which is accepted as the definitive work on the Verein fur Sozialpolitik in Weber’s period, and is important for understanding the background to his political theory.22 Lindenlaub distinguishes two main lines of controversy in the Verein. The first was within the older generation of founder members, between a dominant ‘conservative’ wing, whose chief exponents were Gustav Schmoller and Adolf Wagner, and a ‘liberal’ wing led by Lujo Brentano.23 Although agreed on the broad aim of improvement for the working class, they disagreed about what this meant and how it could be achieved. The conservatives favoured a policy of protection for agriculture, and believed a balance between the classes could best be secured from above by bureaucratic control over industry and industrial relations. The liberals sought to free the expanding German industry from state regulation; the central plank of social policy for them was the removal of legal obstructions to the operation and effectiveness of the trade unions, and, to a lesser extent, the reform of the suffrage. The liberals wanted the workers to achieve by their own efforts what the conservatives sought to achieve for them by state regulation. Of the two wings, the conservatives remained dominant in the Verein until the late 1890s.24 At that point the emergence of a younger generation (including Sombart, Toennies, Alfred and Max Weber), who were more sympathetic to the liberal direction, brought a sharpening of political controversy within the association.25 They also raised a fresh issue—that of the correct attitude to Marx’s work—which united them against the older generation, Brentano included. The younger generation agreed in taking Marx seriously, and held that capitalism and the class conflict it generated formed the constitutive element of modern social rela-\n\n20\n\nMAX WEBER AND THE THEORY OF MODERN POLITICS\n\ntions. The refusal of their elders to accept the concept of capitalism, except for the analysis of some marginal economic problems, meant that, in the eyes of the younger generation, their social analysis was at best superficial. Modern society could only be understood by those who had come to terms with Marx.26 Both these controversies are important in providing the context for Weber’s political thought. The views of the older generation of conservatives, particularly their idealisation of Prussian bureaucracy and their acceptance of paternalism in society and state, provided a focal point in opposition to which Weber’s own political views came to be defined. At the same time he was in the forefront of the younger generation in accepting capitalism as ‘the most fateful force’27 of modern life, a view which, though partly obscured in his later sociology, he never in fact seriously departed from. Both sets of issues are central to the subject of this book. The other organisation Weber was involved in at the time of his studies on East Prussia, the Protestant Social Congress, was in the long term less important to him, though its meetings in the mid 1890s provided the scene for his most forthright speeches on the nature of capitalism and the need for German industrialisation and imperial expansion.28 The first meeting of the Congress was called in 1890 to press for the recognition of the ‘legitimate demands of the working class’ in both church and state.29 Its membership overlapped considerably with that of the Verein,30 but it had a more single-mindedly agitational purpose. Weber, never a committed Christian, became involved through friendship with two of its leading figures, Pastors Gohre and Naumann, and he contributed frequently to Naumann’s journal, Die Hilfe, and to Christliche Welt. Friedrich Naumann was to become a politician of some consideration, and his career was strongly influenced by Weber; to some extent he reflected in practical activity Weber’s own political thinking. It is generally accepted, for instance, that Weber’s inaugural speech at Freiburg was a decisive factor in Naumann’s shift from a Christian to a more nationalist brand of socialism, which culminated in the formation of the National Social Party in 1897.31 Although Weber was critically disposed towards this project,32 he attended its inaugural meeting, while his mother put up the money for Naumann’s candidacy for the Reichstag.33 On the collapse of the party in 1903 and Naumann’s subsequent election as a left liberal deputy, Weber became his ‘constant adviser’.34 His letters to Naumann in this period contain his earliest systematic critique of the German system of\n\nMAX WEBER AS POLITICAL THEORIST\n\n21\n\ngovernment and its limitations.35 Weber brought to questions of social policy a strongly political approach derived from his family tradition, and there remained a difference of emphasis between Naumann and himself, summarised by Marianne Weber in her statement that ‘for Naumann, the national power state was a means to social reform, whereas, on the contrary, for Weber social and political justice were a means to the security of the nation state.’36 How far this is a fair assessment will be discussed later. Weber’s speeches and writings for the Verein fur Sozialpolitik, then, and to a lesser extent for the Evangelisch-soziale Kongress, form one important body of material that will be considered here. Alongside this, there are writings of a more exclusively political character, dating from the wartime and postwar period, most of which were published initially as articles in the Frankfurter Zeitung. These are of two kinds. First, up to 1917, are a number of articles and papers on German foreign relations, critical both of prewar policy and of the conduct of the war itself, in particular the government’s definition of war aims.37 These are significant for Weber’s conception of the nation state and of the international context of national politics. Then, from 1917 onwards, Weber turned his attention to questions of internal political reform. The two extended series of articles he wrote on the democratisation of the constitution, which received wide circulation in pamphlet form, are among the most weighty of his political writings.38 Although part of a general movement for democratisation current at the time, these articles are distinctive both in the character of their argument for democracy and for the wide range of issues handled. Weber’s political activity was not confined to the writing of articles, however. He formulated specific proposals for reform to put before the Parliamentary commission in 1917,39 and was himself a member of the committee that advised on the new constitution at the end of the war.40 He also campaigned vigorously for the newly formed Democratic Party in the winter elections of 1918-19, making speeches throughout the country, and after the elections kept up his campaign for a presidential system of government.41 These many articles and speeches from the period after 1915 comprise the main bulk of the German editions of Weber’s collected political writings, and form a second important body of material for this study. Weber’s political interests were not confined to issues of German politics alone. He visited both the USA and Britain, and studied the workings of their politics from Ostrogorski and others. The systems of government of both countries served him in different\n\n22\n\nMAX WEBER AND THE THEORY OF MODERN POLITICS\n\nways as models for his critique of German politics, and references to both abound in his writings.42 It was Russia, however, that of all foreign countries attracted his most sustained interest. He wrote two extensive studies of the Russian revolution in 1905-6 for the Archiv fur Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik,43 as well as a short article on the February revolution in 1917.44 These studies have been universally ignored in all discussions on Weber, yet together they constitute his most substantial exercise in political analysis. They will be given corresponding emphasis in this book.45 Apart from these articles, there are also a number of writings on general political themes to be considered, the most important being the two lectures he gave in the winter of 1918-19, the first to a group of army officers in Vienna on ‘Socialism’, the second to a student association in Munich on ‘Politics as a Vocation’. The latter, which combines an empirical analysis of the conditions of modern politics with an explicitly normative account of the politician’s role, is justly one of the most famous of Weber’s political writings. The writings briefly sketched out above, together with Weber’s voluminous correspondence on politics,46 amount to a substantial body of political comment and analysis. The term used to describe them in German—writings on ‘Tagespolitik’, or occasional writings—aptly expresses their character. They were mostly written in response to a specific occasion, whether a political event, such as the Russian revolution, or some momentary request for a talk from a specific group. They are also for the most part explicitly evaluative and critical. This brings us to the second question raised above: how far is it possible to treat such writings in a theoretical manner, as providing material for a theory of politics ? POLITICS AND THEORY\n\nA common, though superficial, view of Weber’s political writings is that, in contrast to the ‘scientific objectivity’ of his sociological work, they contain nothing but a tissue of subjective value judgements. Hans Maier, for example, sees the increasing objectivity of Weber’s scientific work after the early period as balanced by the corresponding irrationality of his political valuations. ‘It is impossible,’ he writes, ‘to find any continuity amidst the strudel of [his] highly emotional utterances on the politics of the day.’47 This is not only an inadequate assessment of these writings; it also misconceives the relationship Weber himself posited between empirical analysis and political practice. Although he strove to\n\nMAX WEBER AS POLITICAL THEORIST\n\n23\n\nprevent a subordination of social science to practical goals, and to maintain a clear distinction between the activities of analysis and propaganda, at the same time he always insisted that a correct apprehension of reality was a precondition of successful political practice. Correct empirical analysis was as important for politics as for science; the ability to recognise inconvenient facts as much a virtue in the politician as in the academic. This is pointed out clearly by von Schelting, in what is still the most comprehensive analysis of Weber’s methodology. The attainment of responsible political action, he writes, ‘stands or falls with the possibility of achieving objectively valid knowledge of the empirical relationships pertaining in those areas of social and economic life which are relevant for the standpoint of the actor. . . . No one knew this better than Max Weber.’48 The political virtue most frequently emphasised by Weber was thus that of ‘Sachlichkeit’—matter of factness, realism.49 The ideal politician of ‘Politics as a Vocation’ is one who combines passion with objectivity.50 A frequent target of his political writings are those Weber scornfully terms ‘Literati’, ideologists, whether of Right or Left, who showed a profound ignorance of the political facts of life.51 Weber’s writings themselves are as much aimed to awaken others to these realities as to propagate his own values—whether it be instructing a gathering of socially committed Christians that the development of capitalism had rendered the individual personal relationships of the religious ethic obsolete,52 or pronouncing certain socialist ideals inconsistent with modern bureaucracy,53 or urging the Right that great power status was incompatible with Germany’s authoritarian political system.54 Of course, Weber’s brand of realism needs to be treated with some scepticism. It was reality presented so as to persuade. At times realism itself became elevated into a principle which was destructive of all ideals.55 Nevertheless, it remains true that for Weber political advocacy involved empirical analysis as much as moral exhortation; the starting point of political argument was an informed awareness of social reality. This being so, it is not surprising that we can find in Weber’s political writings a good deal of material of an analytical kind. In the first instance it is analysis of the particular social and political structure of Germany or Russia. However, as one would expect with someone of Weber’s sociological insight, wider theoretical implications are never far from the surface. Thus his concern with the problem of political leadership in Germany involved the problem of how leadership was possible at all in the face of bureau-\n\n24\n\nMAX WEBER AND THE THEORY OF MODERN POLITICS\n\ncratic administration; and the attainment of freedom in Russia was linked with the question of its attainment in societies characterised by large-scale capitalism in general. Even where his concern was with the distinctive features of German or Russian politics, these are often defined by contrast with political arrangements elsewhere. Weber demonstrates a theoretical grasp even in the most ‘occasional’ of contexts, and this makes it possible to use such writings as evidence for a theory of politics, particularly where the material has been carefully worked over, as in his more extended articles. An interesting illustration of the theoretical content of Weber’s political writings is provided by Winckelmann’s edition of the Staatssoziologie.56 Starting from the recognition that Weber never lived to complete his sociology of the state, Winckelmann argues that there is firm evidence available of the topics he intended to treat in such a work.57 He then proceeds to make good the gap with extracts from Weber’s political writings, in particular ‘Politics as a Vocation’ and the articles on ‘Parliament and Government in a Reconstructed Germany’; these extracts are reorganised according to topics—political leadership, democracy, parliamentary government, etc—and ‘all value judgements are eliminated’.58 The finished product is then published as Weber’s posthumous ‘Sociology of the State’, and it appears as such in the fourth and fifth German editions of Economy and Society.59 Such a project serves to emphasise the extent of theoretical content in Weber’s political writings. It also illustrates the possible dangers of treating Weber’s work in this way. In the first place, in eliminating Weber’s value judgements Winckelmann is not removing an extraneous irrelevance, but that which sets the context and gives the analysis its whole significance. However rich in theoretical content it may be, a polemic such as ‘Parliament and Government’ cannot simply be treated as a preliminary sketch for Economy and Society—as a ‘preparation for the completion of the manuscript of his great sociological work’60—without fundamentally changing its character. Secondly, Weber was himself explicit that what he was engaged in in his political articles was not science, and should not be accorded the authority of science. In the introduction to the articles on Germany’s future constitution, for instance, he wrote that they were ‘purely political works of the moment, without any pretensions at all to “scientific” validity,’61 a judgement which applied also to the articles on ‘Parliament and Government’.62 This was not only a question of their occasional character, but also of their context being a\n\nMAX WEBER AS POLITICAL THEORIST\n\n25\n\npractical political one, rather than an academic. ‘Science,’ for Weber, meant more than merely empirical analysis; it involved a particular way of organising empirical material, a particular sophistication in the definition and use of concepts; it meant also that the problems for inquiry were mediated, if no more, through the tradition and perspective of a scientific community. Weber’s political writings do not meet these criteria, even if all the value judgements could somehow be spirited away. Winckelmann is surely right to emphasise the important theoretical elements in Weber’s political writings. The present study will explore these elements, but at the same time seek to avoid the difficulties of Winckelmann’s approach. First, Weber’s value concerns will be regarded as an integral part of his theory, and not extraneous to it. Discussion will remain within the context of Weber’s values and the problems posed for these values by his understanding of contemporary society. Secondly, although it will be argued that Weber’s writing has a significance beyond the immediate historical context, this context will not be ignored, especially where it is important to the development of Weber’s theory.63 Thirdly, there can be no suggestion that the theory discussed here was, or might have been, Weber’s ‘scientific’ sociology of politics. Indeed it will be argued that the aspects of politics which Weber found significant from the academic and practical standpoints diverged as much as they coincided. What is meant then by ‘theory’ in this book, and by Weber’s ‘theory’ of politics, is something more than a mere succession of particular analyses and evaluations, but something less than ‘science’. This brings us to the final question to be considered in the present chapter: what relationship do Weber’s political writings hold to his academic sociology? POLITICS AND ACADEMIC SOCIOLOGY\n\nThe question of the relationship between Weber’s political and sociological writings has received a good deal of attention in the literature on Weber. It has usually been treated as a question of what light knowledge about Weber’s political situation and standpoint can throw on the character and purpose of his academic writings. One of the earliest and most thoroughgoing attempts to deduce conclusions about Weber’s sociology from his political situation is a work by Christoph Steding, Politik und Wissenschaft bei Max Weber (Politics and Science in Max Weber), published in 1932.64 Steding argues that the key to Weber’s academic work is\n\n26\n\nMAX WEBER AND THE THEORY OF MODERN POLITICS\n\nto be found in the dilemma of bourgeois liberalism in an age when its individualist ideals had been overtaken in the economic sphere by the carteilisation of industry, and in the political sphere by the advent of mass democracy and socialism. According to Steding, this dilemma is the key both to Weber’s failure in politics and to a proper understanding of his sociological work, which reveals him as a politician manque, an academic ‘against his will’.65 Thus The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism is an expression of ‘the bourgeoisie come to self-consciousness’—but too late, because its spirit belongs to a past world.66 The concept of charisma embodies Weber’s own ideal of ‘independence from all constraints except those of one’s inner calling.’67 His account of Judaic prophecy in the sociology of religion reflects his own prophecies of doom against the Kaiser during the war, and so on.68 On Steding’s view, all Weber’s sociology finds its proper interpretation in his political situation and values; indeed, the distinction between politics and sociology disappears. Few critics since Steding have been as thoroughgoing in their attempt to derive Weber’s sociology from his politics, though on a different level Arthur Mitzman has attempted to show that the key to Weber’s academic work lies in his family situation: the struggle for independence from his father, and his supposed failure to consummate his marriage.69 Most critics have been more modest in their approach, contenting themselves with drawing out parallels in a few specific areas. Thus Mommsen shows how the purely instrumental approach to constitutional issues of Weber’s political thought is reflected in his sociological category of legal authority, and how the emphasis on leadership in his political writings is reflected in the central place assigned to charisma in his sociology70 —the latter also a theme in a recent study by Anthony Giddens.71 The weakness of all these approaches is that they rarely spell out exactly what they are claiming to have shown about Weber’s scientific work, by evidence adduced from his political context or standpoint. The cruder versions depend upon the implausible assumption that, when Weber was writing about the Protestant ethic or about emigration from the estates of East Prussia, he was really writing about something else: the pathos of the modern bourgeoisie, or his desire to be free of his father’s household. The more restrained versions, while avoiding such crudities, remain less than explicit about the purpose of the connections they are making, or how knowledge about Weber’s political position can help our assessment of his scientific conclusions or categories. As is often pointed out, questions about the origin and the validity of\n\nMAX WEBER AS POLITICAL THEORIST\n\n27\n\nscientific work are separate questions; knowledge about the first does not entitle us to conclude the second. Only where we already have independent evidence for challenging the validity of a scientific conclusion or category does it become illuminating to refer to the author’s political views or context for an explanation. But the latter kind of inquiry, while useful in its proper place, is not a substitute for the former.72 The same considerations apply to the account of Weber’s work given by Georg Lukacs, who locates it within the context of a general critique of sociology in Wilhelmine Germany.73 The main problem of sociology in this period, he argues, was how to provide an account of the origins and structure of capitalism which would challenge the Marxist position. This Weber does in The Protestant Ethic with an account of the development of capitalism in which the economic motives for capital accumulation are played down, and in his other works with an analysis of contemporary capitalism according to the general categories of rationality and calculability, which obscure what is problematic about it: the phenomena of exploitation and class conflict. From this point of view the whole methodological basis of Weber’s sociology—the separation of science from practical commitment, the ideal type method, the development of abstract categories— can be seen as a way of evading the problems posed by the ‘dialectic of social reality’.74 At the same time, however, Weber’s categories cannot help reflecting this reality. Thus his general categories of social action ‘are nothing more than the abstractly formulated psychology of the calculating individual of the capitalist system’, and his account of the irreconcilability of the different value spheres shows him ‘stumbling on the problem of the Communist Manifesto, that history is the history of class struggle’.75 Although parts of what Lukacs says have plausibility, his account in general rests on the assumption that the arguments Weber himself uses, for example to justify his methodological position, can be happily ignored, and that his intentions can be assumed without question to be primarily political rather than academic.76 But for this Lukacs offers no sustained evidence. A different approach to Weber’s academic and political writings, which at the same time offers some account of the logic of their relationship, is provided by writers such as Karl Lowith77 and Gunter Abramowski.78 Their approach is much more sympathetic to Weber. They claim to discover, behind all the variety of his academic work, a self-conscious unity of purpose of an ethical or existential kind. The character of this purpose is then clarified\n\n28\n\nMAX WEBER AND THE THEORY OF MODERN POLITICS\n\nby appeal to his non-academic writings, where these value issues are discussed more explicitly. A justification for this approach can be given in terms of Weber’s own methodology. For Weber, the activity of the social scientist was only possible within a context of values which both provided the criterion for what was worth studying and also gave the object of investigation its significance. One implication of this is that the critique of a social scientist’s work will involve not only an examination of its empirical claims, but also an elucidation of its underlying ‘existential’ purpose.79 Both Lowith and Abramowski discern the unifying principle of Weber’s academic work in the theme of rationalisation. Lowith’s 1932 articles on Weber and Marx have had a special influence on subsequent interpretation. Central to his argument is the parallel he draws between Weber’s concept of rationalisation and Marx’s analysis of capitalism through the concept of alienation. Where Marx, argues Lowith, saw the dilemma of modern man in the alienating power of capitalism—whereby the products of man’s creation came to dominate man the producer—Weber located this ‘perversion’ in the process of rationalisation as such. Wherever men seek to increase their freedom by making life more predictable, the structures they create take on a life of their own and come to limit that freedom.80 Lowith’s argument is that, in their scientific writings, both Marx and Weber transcended the purely scientific to embrace questions of human existence and dignity, and were in this sense philosophical writers. But whereas the terms of Marx’s analysis enabled him to offer a transformation of man’s situation through revolution, Weber could only provide an understanding of the dilemma so that men could come to terms with it. ‘Where Marx offered a therapy, Weber offered only a diagnosis.’81 Abramowski follows Lowith82 in arguing that behind all Weber’s scientific analyses, behind all his researches into universal history, stands an existential question: what does this process of rationalisation signify for our humanity? ‘How, under the conditions of increasing . . . bureaucratisation, of the scientific disenchantment of the world, are human freedom, responsible action and meaningful existence possible?’83 Abramowski accepts with Lowith that it was only from a value standpoint, that of ‘the freedom of independent decision and action for the individual’, that this process of rationalisation took its significance for Weber.84 The attraction of this approach is that it appears to provide a way of treating Weber’s academic and political writings together, which can find justification in terms of Weber’s own methodology.\n\nMAX WEBER AS POLITICAL THEORIST\n\n29\n\nOn this view knowledge of Weber’s political values is not merely interesting additional information, but integral to understanding the existential purpose of his academic work. However, it must be questioned how far the interpretation of Weber’s methodological position which underlies this approach is in fact correct. Although the issues raised here are too complex to be dealt with satisfactorily in a brief space, one simple point can be emphasised. It is true that, for Weber, knowledge in the sphere of the ‘cultural’ sciences had to meet a criterion of significance as well as of validity, and that this significance was determined by ‘the values which dominate the investigator and his age.’85 But it does not follow from this that the significance of Weber’s academic work is to be found in his own personal hierarchy of values. In his article on ‘Objectivity’ Weber identified a spectrum of value significance, from an interest in a family chronicle at one extreme to ‘the greatest cultural phenomena, common to a nation and mankind over long epochs,’ at the other.86 The characteristic of his own work was that he was concerned with the latter kind (capitalism, bureaucracy, etc), that is with phenomena to which his own society as a whole attached significance, and not merely a contemporary or transient significance, but a universal one.87 The fact that he drew sharply articulated conclusions from these phenomena for his own value standpoint in his political speeches, and even in asides in his academic writing, does not entitle us to conclude that these personal judgements defined the real significance of his academic work.88 What holds for the subjects of Weber’s work, applies also to the concepts in terms of which he treated them. Abramowski is right to say that the concept of ‘rationalisation’ formed a central preoccupation of Weber’s work. But it is not true, as he claims, that it gained its ‘real significance’ from the problem it posed to human freedom.89 For Weber, the concept of rationalisation defined a constitutive element of modern society in contrast with traditional societies, and thus had a significance which transcended the particular value orientation of the individual sociologist. Indeed, in the preface to the first volume of the Grundriss der Sozialokonomik, of which Weber’s own Economy and Society formed but a part, he was explicit that, despite the variety of value standpoints and methodological positions of the different contributors, they were united in the view that ‘the development of economic activity must be conceived before all else as a special manifestation of the universal rationalisation of life.’90 One can only be sceptical therefore of attempts to treat Weber’s academic\n\n30\n\nMAX WEBER AND THE THEORY OF MODERN POLITICS\n\nwork from within the framework of his own personal political values. There is no doubt that Lowith and Abramowski provide illuminating insights into Weber’s conception of his own society; but at the same time they offer a less than adequate account of his academic work and its purposes.91 As can be seen, attempts to draw connections between Weber’s political situation and values on the one hand, and his academic sociology on the other, tend to prove unsatisfactory. This is because they are based on inadequate methodological premises. Either, as in the case of Steding, they fail to specify how a knowledge about the origins of a writer’s work can provide a test for the adequacy of its conclusions. Or else, as in the case of Lukacs, they make assumptions about the intentions of Weber’s academic work which far outrun any evidence. Or else, finally, as in the case of Lowith and Abramowski, their argument rests on a mistaken interpretation of Weber’s method and his concept of ‘value relevance’. The result is thus to reduce Weber’s work to a specious unity, which does justice neither to the variety of his academic purposes, nor to the complexity of his value position. This is not to deny that such approaches can produce useful insights. It is a contention of the present study that the question of the relationship between Weber’s political writings and his academic sociology is an important one, and that significant features of the latter can be shown to be ‘ideological’. But the duty of the critic who seeks to characterise aspects of Weber’s work in this way is to be thoroughly explicit about what he is claiming by doing so, and his methodological justification for claiming it. To adapt a phrase of Weber’s, such a judgement is only acceptable if it forms the conclusion, and not the starting point, of analysis. The starting point must be the recognition that, at any rate after his early period, Weber drew a self-conscious distinction between doing science and engaging in political propaganda, between his academic and political roles. Any account of Weber’s work which is to make sense must at least begin by taking this distinction seriously. This means that the point of his political writings is to be sought in a political context, and that of his sociology, in the first instance at least, within a particular scientific tradition. Only in this way can a clear understanding be gained of each. If it is misleading to look for the key to Weber’s academic work in his bourgeois political standpoint, it is equally misleading to treat his political writings as a kind of preliminary to the achievements of his systematic sociology. The present study will therefore seek to maintain a clear distinc-\n\nMAX WEBER AS POLITICAL THEORIST\n\n31\n\ntion between Weber’s scientific and non-scientific work, on the assumption that each is to be considered on its own terms. The main part of the book will explore systematically the conception of modern society and politics that is to be found in his political writings. Material from Economy and Society used here will be mainly for the purpose of conceptual clarification only. When, however, this account of Weber’s political theory has been given, the final chapter will return to the question of its relationship to his academic sociology. On the one hand, a contrast will be drawn between the questions, content and methods of analysis in the two types of writing, which will help to clarify what kind of activity Weber understood social science to involve. On the other hand, a number of features in his academic sociology will be identified which acted as a support to his political standpoint, and these will be examined to see in what sense they can be characterised as ‘ideological’. This must wait till the end. The first task is to gain a clear understanding of Weber’s social and political values, since these will provide a framework for the discussion of his political theory. This will form the subject of the following chapter.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1 Marianne Weber, Ein Lebensbild (Tubingen, 1926), hereafter cited as Lebensbitd. 2 ibid, pp 173-6.

Their interpretation also overlooks the development in Weber’s later work of a conception of sociology as a generalising science, and begs the question of how far the concept of value relevance, designed to meet the problem of the uniqueness of historical phenomena, is applicable to a science which ‘seeks general laws of events’ (WG, p 9).\n\nChapter 2\n\nWeber as Protagonist of Bourgeois Values\n\n‘After long experience,’ Weber wrote to a friend in 1918, \\ . . I am convinced that the individual can only come to know what his own will really is through testing his supposed “ultimate” convictions by his attitude to thoroughly specific problems, in which the issues are sharply accentuated.’1 The present chapter will follow this approach, by looking at examples of Weber’s writing on specific problems, as the best means to defining his general political standpoint and values. Three works will be discussed, each typical of a different period of his life. From the early period of the 1890s comes the Inaugural Address at Freiburg, ‘Economic Policy and the Nation State,’ which combines a summary of Weber’s researches on the conditions of East Prussian agriculture with an expression of his nationalist conviction typical of this time. Second will be considered the two extended articles he wrote on the Russian revolution of 1905-6. These belong to the new phase of his writing after his illness, and are representative of the more universalist character of his outlook in this period, expressed in his concern with the problem of freedom in an increasingly rationalised world. Third is the most substantial example of his wartime polemics, ‘Parliament and Government in a Reconstructed Germany,’ which is again typical of its period in his return to a preoccupation with the problems of German politics, and in the greater emphasis given to the analysis of political institutions. After a brief summary of each of these works, their wider significance will be discussed. In this way it is hoped to provide a representative view of Weber’s political values, as well as some idea of the development in his thinking. ECONOMIC CHANGE AND THE NATIONAL INTEREST\n\nThe Freiburg Inaugural Address is the most important statement of\n\nWEBER AS PROTAGONIST OF BOURGEOIS VALUES\n\n37\n\nWeber’s political ideas in his early period.2 It begins with a brief summary of his main findings on agricultural conditions in East Prussia. Weber wrote numerous different accounts of these findings, all with slightly different emphases, but the situation he found was broadly as follows.3 The recent intensification of international market competition had threatened the economy of the large estates in East Prussia, particularly those on poor soil, and accelerated the introduction of mechanisation and of crops such as sugar beet which could be cultivated intensively. Instead of a feudal patriarch the landowner became a capitalist entrepreneur.4 The agricultural worker changed correspondingly from a tied cottager, who shared in the produce of the harvest and thus had a common interest with the landowner, to a ‘potato-eating proletarian’ whose interests were in direct conflict with those of his employer.5 The introduction of capitalism brought not only class conflict, but also competition among the workers themselves. It was generally cheaper for the landowner to import Polish casual labourers for the summer season than to employ German workers who had to be paid all the year round. The result was a largescale emigration of German workers to the towns or abroad, particularly of the more enterprising, who saw no chance of achieving economic independence under existing conditions. In some of his accounts, particularly to the Protestant Social Congress, Weber emphasised the more positive aspects of this process: the ‘deep-felt’ desire of the German worker for freedom from his traditional subservience.6 In the Inaugural Address, however, it was the displacement of Germans by Polish immigrants that he concentrated on.7 The competition among the workers, introduced by capitalism, favoured those whose standard of living and expectations were lower. The same was also true in the independent smallholdings, as well as on the large estates. The German smallholders, who produced for the market, were unable to make the best use of the land in the circumstances of increased competition, and were replaced by Polish peasants who operated a subsistence economy. In each case, that of labourers and of independent farmers, the process of economic development favoured the Poles precisely because their economic needs were lower than their German counterparts, because they represented a ‘less developed cultural type’.8 From this situation Weber drew a number of general conclusions in his Inaugural Address. First was to question the assumption that economic development could serve as a self-evident goal for economic policy.9 Economic development could produce\n\n38\n\nMAX WEBER AND THE THEORY OF MODERN POLITICS\n\nthe triumph of an inferior type of man. The Poles were able to survive, and drive out the Germans, because their standard of living, their economic and cultural demands, were lower than those of their German counterparts. What happened was the survival of the ^fittest. This threatened the basis of German culture in the east, and the national security of the eastern frontier. Such a threat could only be overcome and the ‘Slavic flood stemmed’ by a policy of state support for the re-colonisation of German farmers, and by closing the eastern frontier.10 However, it was not so much the specific remedy as the general lesson that Weber was concerned to develop in his Address. This was that the maximisation of production could never serve as the unquestioned goal for economic policy, but must be subordinate to national and cultural values. Weber poured scorn on the ‘Endaimonisten’, who believed that economic development would effortlessly produce a general increase in happiness. What such people overlooked was the universality of conflict and struggle, between groups and between nations, which economic development only intensified, as the situation on the eastern frontier showed. In such a context'of struggle, the promotion of German national and cultural values was all-important. So, he concludes this section of the Address, the goal of German economic policy as well as the standards of German economic theory could only be national, German ones. ‘The science of economic policy is a political science; it is the servant of politics ... of the long-term great power interests of the nation.’11 If one consequence of the economic situation in the east was the threat to German culture and national interests, a second was the crisis of political leadership brought about by the economic decline of the Junkers, and the movement of the centre of economic power from the rural estates to the towns.12 The Junkers were an economically declining class, and such a class could not provide strong national leadership since they were primarily concerned to use their political power to bolster up their declining economic position. ‘They have performed their task,’ said Weber, ‘and now lie in an economic struggle to the death, from which no economic policy on the part of the state can restore them to their traditional social character.’13 However, although economic power had passed to the towns, the bourgeoisie were politically immature and uneducated. One of the chief reasons for this was the dominance exercised by Bismarck. Bismarck had stifled all political talent, and the bourgeoisie had become accustomed to having a great man take the initiative. As a result they had had no\n\nWEBER AS PROTAGONIST OF BOURGEOIS VALUES\n\n39\n\nchance to develop politically.14 Germany was thus in the position where a declining class wielded political power in its own narrowly conceived interest, whereas the economically developing class was unfitted for wielding political power at all. Weber summarised the position succinctly: It is dangerous . . . when an economically declining class holds political power. But it is even more dangerous when classes, to whom economic power and with it the expectation of political supremacy are passing, are politically too immature to take on the leadership of the state. Both these threaten Germany at the moment, and this is the key to our present dangers.15 The crucial question was how the bourgeoisie could become fit to rule. At least part of the answer lay, according to Weber, in political education; and what more worth-while task could there be for a national economist than that? For the immediate future one thing stands out: there is a huge task of political education to be accomplished. No more serious duty faces us than ... to play our part in the work of educating the nation politically, which must remain the final goal of our science.16 Weber’s Inaugural Address has been dismissed by some critics as a youthful excess. It is true that some views were expressed here with a crudity not found later, and others came to be substantially modified, most notably Weber’s assertion of the subordination of economic science to political goals.17 Yet even on the question of value freedom there were seeds of his mature doctrine here in his repeated insistence that the mere fact of economic development could not provide any self-evident value or standard, whether for practical policy or for science; values could not be deduced from facts.18 And in general the Address expresses attitudes which are repeated in Weber’s mature works, and can be regarded as characteristic of his political thought. The most important of these will be considered briefly. Most obviously typical of the attitudes expressed in the Address is its explicit affirmation of Germany’s national interest as the decisive value for political and economic policy. This was affirmed repeatedly by Weber in his later life. In a speech in 1909 he said: ‘Many of us take the view that the ultimate definitive value ... is the power position of a nation in the world.’19 And again in 1916 he wrote that he had ‘always viewed policy from a national standpoint alone.’20 As will be explored in a later chapter, Weber’s\n\n40\n\nMAX WEBER AND THE THEORY OF MODERN POLITICS\n\nnationalism was more complex than has frequently been made out by critics. A central part of it was his commitment to the value of ‘Kultur’, the cultural uniqueness embodied in national communities in general and the German nation in particular, which could only be protected under modern conditions by means of the power state. At the same time there was an important economic element. The pressure on land and resources brought about by the growth of population and industrial development—the ‘harsh gravity of the population problem’, as he called it in the Address21 —made the assertion of national economic self-interest paramount. Germany, in particular, now that national unification had set her firmly in the arena of the great powers, could not opt out of the international struggle. To do so, as he said in the Address, would be to make a mockery of German unification. It was the fate of his generation to live under the shadow of the great generation who had established the Reich, to be ‘Epigoni’, mere descendants of the great. At least they should see to it that the achievements of their predecessors did not mark the end of German history, but rather the beginning.22 Thus the protection of German culture (particularly against the Slavs), the assertion of economic self-interest, the satisfaction of a new generation’s honour and responsibility to the future, all formed part of the nationalism expressed in the Inaugural Address. Chapter 5 will show how far this mellowed, particularly after Weber’s Russian studies had awakened him to the problem of national minorities. Nevertheless, nationalism in some form was to remain central among his political values. A second theme of the Inaugural Address, equally typical, was its criticism of the absence in Germany of any political leadership which could give adequate expression to her national purpose and promote it effectively. Emphasis on the central importance of political leadership was a constant preoccupation of Weber’s political writings, as much in his later as his earlier period. Throughout he was convinced that such leadership could only come from a strong economic class—the bourgeoisie. If, however, a strong economic class was a necessary condition for political leadership, it was not a sufficient one; it required also political capacity and political consciousness. ‘We forget,’ said Weber in the Address, ‘that economic power and a calling for political leadership of the nation do not necessarily coincide’.23 How to instill a political consciousness in the bourgeoisie and wean them from habits of political subservience remained a constant question of German politics for Weber. It was a question he answered differently in different periods. In his early writing the answer lay\n\nWEBER AS PROTAGONIST OF BOURGEOIS VALUES\n\n41\n\nin calls for political education and in the development of a vigorous bourgeois democratic party as a means to this;24 in the wartime period his attention concentrated on the reform of political institutions, particularly of the subordinate position of Parliament, to encourage qualities of political will and responsibility.25 In each case the role of class remained indispensable in providing the social basis and support for political leadership. If a commitment to national values and to the importance of political leadership form the main political themes of the Inaugural Address, the speech is also important for the explicitness with which it gives expression to certain more general assumptions central to Weber’s conception of society. The most important of these is the theme that struggle and conflict form a central and permanent feature of social life—struggle between groups, classes, nations, as well as the conflict between differing values. Even where such a conflict is not apparent, it is still going on under the surface. ‘There is no peace in the economic struggle for existence’, says Weber in the Address, ‘only . . . the illusion of peace’.26 A similar statement from one of his last writings demonstrates the continuity of this theme: ‘Conflict cannot be excluded from social life ... “peace” is nothing more than a change in the character of conflict.’27 The Inaugural Address demonstrates clearly the conclusions Weber derived from this fact of struggle and conflict both for empirical analysis and for political values. As to the first, a central feature in the analysis of social structures became the question of what qualities, what types of individual were selected out by the particular character of the conflict taking place within these structures. How did they so shape the character of struggle that they brought certain qualities to supremacy at the expense of others? This concept of ‘Auslese’ (selection) reappears as a central feature in nearly all Weber’s writings on contemporary society. Thus one theme of his studies on East Prussia was how the terms of economic conflict favoured a particular cultural type, the Polish seasonal worker, at the expense of the Germans.28 The theme of the massive study he supervised for the Verein in 1907-9 on conditions in large-scale industry, indeed its explicit title, was what particular psycho-physical qualities and types of worker were ‘selected’ by the conditions and pressures of modern factory life.29 The theme of two of the major projects he outlined to the first meeting of the German Sociological Society in 1910—systematic studies of voluntary associations and of elites—centred on the process whereby certain qualities came to be selected and rein-\n\n42\n\nMAX WEBER AND THE THEORY OF MODERN POLITICS\n\nforced by the character of the association or the requirements of the elite role.30 In the political sphere, also, Weber was concerned with the qualities and types of politician selected by different kinds of political system.31 This emphasis on the process of selection through conflict and competition, whether open or concealed, not only provided a focus for empirical analysis; Weber also derived conclusions from it for the sphere of values, as the Inaugural Address shows. Recognition of the inevitability of conflict ruled out certain kinds of value position as untenable. If values themselves were in irreducible conflict, then those who believed that all good things could somehow coincide in some future Utopia and refused to admit the necessity for choices between them, were too naive to be taken seriously. More specifically, the inevitability of conflict between groups and individuals ruled out that range of ideals for mankind in which peace and happiness formed a substantial part; such ideals could only be illusory, because they were based on a false conception of reality. ‘For the dreamers of peace and happiness’, said Weber, ‘there stands written over the door of mankind’s unknown future “surrender all hope”.’32 However, in the process of seeking to shatter such illusions, Weber’s position showed a subtle shift from regarding conflict as simply a fact of life against which the ideals and values of others should be tested for their realism, to regarding it as something to be positively welcomed, even encouraged. This is implicit in the tone of the Inaugural Address, but is made much more explicit in a speech Weber made to the Protestant Social Congress, also on the problems of East Prussia. Here he expanded on his proposed policy of re-colonisation, which he admitted could only promise German farmers at best a hard struggle to maintain their livelihood. Was this a brutal policy? he asked. They were not involved in ‘Sozialpolitik’ to increase human happiness: Our aim is ... so to create conditions, not that men may feel happier, but that under the necessity of the unavoidable struggle for existence the best in them—those physical and spiritual characteristics which we want to preserve for the nation—will remain protected.33 Here conditions of struggle were to be welcomed because they fostered qualities of independence that Weber regarded as desirable. Indeed, for Weber the highest values could only be developed through conflict—conflict with other individuals, or with other values, or ‘struggle against the difficulties which life presents’.34\n\nWEBER AS PROTAGONIST OF BOURGEOIS VALUES\n\n43\n\nIt was partly in such terms that he justified the risk-taking activity of the entrepreneur in a context of market competition, in contrast to the bureaucratic ‘order’ of a planned economy, and a social policy which puts the emphasis on extending the effective rights of trade unions to pursue improvements for themselves, in preference to a paternalist system of industrial relations and welfare provision.35 It should be said that the concept of ‘Kampf’ was one of the least specific of Weber’s concepts, ranging from open conflict between people to an unconscious process of selection within social structures. In the section devoted to the term in Economy and Society, written at the end of his life, Weber was much more careful than in the Inaugural Address to distinguish between the different types of ‘Kampf’, and their widely differing significance.36 Although he uses the concept more indiscriminately in his political writings, it is mistaken to call his position a Social Darwinist one, as is often done.37 First, even in the Inaugural Address Weber explicitly rejected as metaphysical any belief in the survival of superior types in the process of historical development. It was precisely the higher cultural types who might be least adapted to new environmental circumstances and social arrangements.38 The concept of ‘selection’ provided Weber with a perspective and a tool for analysis, rather than with a dogma. Secondly, his belief in the value of struggle and competition was nowhere related to a theory of the transmission of favourable characteristics through heredity. The personal qualities developed by such conditions were sufficient justification in themselves. Thus a heightened awareness of‘selection’ at work within social processes, and a readiness to ascribe value to struggle and conflict (albeit within limits not clearly defined) formed central aspects of Weber’s social outlook, and the Inaugural Address is typical of these. This brings us to a final point about his political values for which the Address provides evidence, and that is their nonmaterialist character. For Weber it was non-material values that were important, as opposed to ‘bread and butter’ questions. Not that he underestimated the practical significance of the latter. But such questions should not form the end of politics. Hence his insistence on German cultural values in face of the assumption that the maximisation of production formed a self-evident goal; and his conviction that the end of ‘Sozialpolitik’ could never be merely improving the material position of the working class, but the ‘development of those characteristics . . . which make for human greatness’.39 ‘It is what seems to us valuable in man’,\n\n44\n\nMAX WEBER AND THE THEORY OF MODERN POLITICS\n\nhe told the Protestant Social Congress, ‘that we seek to protect: personal responsibility, the deep aspiration for the moral and spiritual goods of mankind . . .’40-—qualities whose possession Weber argued was in inverse proportion to ‘a subjective feeling of happiness’. Politics for Weber was a sphere for the assertion and pursuit of non-material values. While the attainment of power and the satisfaction of material interests were necessary means for the politician, they should not form ends in themselves; the true politician was one who committed himself to a cause.41 The problem of how such a conception of the politician could be realised in practice will be considered in later chapters. For the present we shall turn to look at a different order of values from those expressed in the Inaugural Address, that of freedom.\n\nFREEDOM AND THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION\n\nThe tone of all Weber’s writings of the 1890s was one of selfconfidence, of self-assertiveness. Although he set out to shatter illusions, and in this sense called himself a pessimist,42 the illusions were not his own, but those of his fellow members of the Verein fur Sozialpolitik and the Protestant Social Congress. In contrast, the character of the writings of the new phase after his illness is very different. Not only is the perspective more universal—it is not Germany that is the theme, but modern society in general; not capitalism as it affected Germany’s political structure and standing as a world power, but capitalism as a universal institution— his outlook also is much less self-confident, more genuinely pessimistic. His own ideals had now come up against the limitations of empirical reality. This is particularly apparent in the theme which occurs in one form or another in most of his writings and speeches in the years 1904-10, that of the decline of human freedom in the face of the increasing rationalisation of life, and the bureaucratisation of economic and political structures. It would be wrong to suggest that all Weber’s writing in this period was ‘really’ about this theme. But the fact that it occurs, even by way of digression, in works as diverse as those on the ‘Protestant Ethic’ and the ‘Agricultural Conditions in the Ancient World’ is evidence that it was a constant preoccupation. The theme of freedom was dealt with most explicitly in Weber’s writings on the Russian revolution of 1905-6. In her biography Marianne Weber describes the impact the revolution made on her husband. He learnt Russian so that he could read reports of\n\nWEBER AS PROTAGONIST OF BOURGEOIS VALUES\n\n45\n\nthe happenings in the Russian newspapers, and he ‘followed the . . . drama for months on end in breathless excitement’.43 The two articles he wrote for the Archiv fur Sozialpolitik und Sozialwissenschaft,44 intended initially as a review of literature, developed into his most substantial work on politics in this period. They contain a great deal of detailed analysis of the Russian social structure and the course of the political conflict, which will be discussed in a later chapter in the context of Weber’s theory of the relationship between society and state. What is of interest here is their underlying theme, the question of what were the chances for freedom in Russia, and in modern society more generally. Only the main outline of Weber’s answer will be sketched in here. The question which forms the main theme of Weber’s analysis, particularly in his first article (‘The Outlook for Bourgeois Democracy in Russia’), was what social forces existed in Russia which could act as a vehicle and support for the various liberal programmes being put forward.45 Weber’s assumption was that the ideological movement to establish personal and civil liberties and constitutional government was insufficient to make headway on its own, unless it could harness important social interests in its cause. But what were these social interests? Weber’s conclusion was pessimistic. Of the ‘historical’ institutions of Russia, the Church hierarchy formed one of the main social supports of absolutism, despite the existence of liberal elements among the clergy. Any threat to the Tsar was also a threat to its own hierarchy.46 The other ‘historical’ force, the peasantry, was not interested in any reforms going beyond the redistribution of land. It would support a revolution only to the point where its hunger for land was satisfied, and no further.47 Even this much, involving a reform of the land system, could only be achieved with a measure of dictatorial imposition, such was the conflict of interests among the peasants themselves.48 If the historical institutions of Russian society thus promised little real support for liberalism, the outlook from its more modern social forces was no brighter. Of these, capitalism, having been ‘superimposed in its most advanced form’ on top of an ‘archaic peasant communism’, received direct encouragement from the state, and was able to satisfy its needs through direct liaison with the Tsarist bureaucracy.44 The urban proletariat, on the other hand, had been recruited into a social democratic movement of a particularly authoritarian temper; they were drilled by their leaders ‘into a spiritual parade march’ altogether foreign to liberal ideas or practice.50 None of these forces, therefore, offered any permanent support for liberalism\n\n46\n\nMAX WEBER AND THE THEORY OF MODERN POLITICS\n\nas such, whatever temporary alliance they might form in opposition to Tsarist repression. This pessimistic analysis led Weber to reflect on the unique constellation of factors which had given rise to European liberalism, factors which were not present in Russia and which were no longer repeatable. This passage is worth quoting at some length: The historical development of modern ‘freedom’ presupposed a unique and unrepeatable constellation of factors, of which the following are the most important: first, overseas expansion . . . secondly, the characteristic economic and social structure of the ‘early capitalist’ period in Western Europe; thirdly, the conquest of life through science . . . finally, certain ideal conceptions which grew out of the concrete historical uniqueness of a particular religious viewpoint, and which, working together with numerous unique political circumstances and the material preconditions mentioned above, combined to fashion the ‘ethical’ and ‘cultural’ character of modern man. The question, whether any process of material development, in particular that of present-day advanced capitalism, could of itself maintain these unique historical circumstances in being or even create them anew, has only to be asked for the answer to.be obvious.51 A central feature of Weber’s analysis here was the observation that modern advanced capitalism was a completely different creature from the early capitalism described, for example, in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. It was increasingly subject to that outward rationalisation of life whose development it had helped initially to promote. Modern production was typically standardised, cartellised, bureaucratised production. Such a development left little scope for economic individualism, nor did it share any particular relationship with liberalism in the area of politics: All the economic weather signs point in the direction of increasing ‘unfreedom’. It is ridiculous in the extreme to ascribe to modern high capitalism, as currently being imported into Russia . . . any inner affinity with ‘democracy’ or even ‘freedom’ (in any sense of the word). The question is rather ‘How are any of these at all possible in the long run under its domination?’52 Weber’s conclusion about the chances for the freedom movement in Russia was thus a pessimistic one. A society which had not achieved a tradition of liberalism before the arrival of the modern rationalised form of capitalism, had only a slim chance of de-\n\nWEBER AS PROTAGONIST OF BOURGEOIS VALUES\n\n47\n\nveloping it then. In missing the moment in history when a unique series of factors combined to provide the impetus for liberal ideas, it had conceivably missed it for good. ‘All the forms of development are excluded which in the West put the strong economic interests of the possessing classes in the service of the movement for bourgeois liberty . .. Never has a struggle for freedom been carried out under such difficult circumstances.’53 Weber could only express his admiration for an attempt which seemed so doomed to failure. Though the subject of Weber’s articles was specifically Russia, with its peculiar social structure and history, yet he clearly regarded his analysis as having a wider significance for modern society in general. Even for societies which had an established tradition of liberalism, the increasing rationalisation of the external conditions of life was progressively eliminating the social structures and areas of independent action which could support that tradition. ‘We are individualists against the stream of material constellations . . .’ wrote Weber in his first article.54 This sounds defiant, but it is also touched with pessimism, as many references in other works of this period show. At the end of The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism Weber turns aside from his main theme to contrast the free spirit of the early capitalists with the ‘iron cage’ of modern industrial life, in which material goods have ‘achieved an inexorable power over the lives of men’.55 In his studies on ‘Agriculture in the Ancient World’ (somewhat misleadingly titled), the total bureaucratisation of life which was a central feature of ancient Egypt and the late Roman Empire is used as an explicit paradigm for the unfreedom progressively developing in the modern world, ‘only on a technically more perfect basis’. Such unfreedom would be at its extreme in a society in which all independent sources of economic activity were removed through the expropriation of private capitalism by the state.56 This is also the theme of Weber’s speech to the Verein meeting in 1909, in which he depicts a time not far distant when every worker would be simply a small cog in the vast bureaucratic machinery, his only interest being how to become a bigger cog. ‘The central question’, said Weber, ‘is what we can oppose to this machinery, so as to keep a portion of humanity free from this parcelling out of the soul’.57 This concern with the diminution of freedom in face of the rationalisation of life was thus a constant preoccupation in this period, and the conclusions he drew were largely pessimistic. We need to be clear, however, about precisely what Weber meant by ‘freedom’. At least three different concepts can be distinguished in his writings. First, there is economic individual-\n\n48\n\nMAX WEBER AND THE THEORY OF MODERN POLITICS\n\nism: the possession of an independent sphere of activity, guaranteed by private property, over which the individual is master.58 Secondly, there are civil and political freedoms: guaranteed rights for the individual and the constitutional rule of law.59 Thirdly, there is a more internal concept of personal autonomy or responsibility, the capacity not to ‘let life run on as a natural event’ but to treat it ‘as a series of ultimate decisions in which the soul. . . chooses the meaning of its own existence’.60 Of the three, it was particularly the first that Weber saw as being progressively eliminated in modern society, with the expropriation of the small producer. Of course he exaggerated even this; he himself was well aware of the scope which still remained within industry, and even more within agriculture, for individualism of the old kind. It was one of his frequent assertions that the desire for economic independence on the part of the German peasant and small farmer made him unavailable for socialism, and that most socialists failed to perceive the difference in mentality between the urban and the rural worker.61 Equally there remained a scope for entrepreneurial skills and the exercise of individual responsibility in even the largest economic concerns. Nevertheless the trend against economic individualism was clearly established, and its analysis is a characteristic Weberian theme. The diminution of one kind of freedom, however, did not necessarily rule out all others as well. "
