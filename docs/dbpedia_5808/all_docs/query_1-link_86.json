Hardly any book has since moved me so deeply. Weber became the great experience of my period of study in Göttingen. Teachers whom I would like to thank with this book Rudolf Smend, Hans Heinrich Schaeder, Georg Weippert - kindled my enthusiasm, while at the same time knowing how to keep it within bounds. Later, seeking to orient a newly established political science, I distanced myself from Weber. This shift away is marked by a few pages in an essay of1959.1 never had a clear conscience about that, and I was never freed of Weber. I am therefore grateful for the various circumstances that have led me once more to a thorough consideration of his work. I hope that I now understand Weber better. After the publication of the first of the essays collected here, Wolfgang Schluchter wrote that he awaited with eagerness the possibility that I might be able ‘to present a thoroughly new interpretation ofWeber, one that decisively marks an advance on the prevailing state of discussion’. My interpretation does not seek to be ‘thoroughly new’! It merely re-establishes that which was still relatively clear to the earlier interpreters: Marianne Weber, Karl Lö with, Siegfried Landshut and Albert Salomon. The reader will have to decide whether this interpretation advances on the ‘prevailing state of discussion’. Whatever this reader may conclude, I believe that a direct resumption of Weber’s work will only be possible when his ‘central\n\nquestion’\n\n(formulated\n\nmost concisely in the hitherto\n\nunpublished‘Preliminary Report’to the survey of the press, cf. Essay 1, pp. 55-57 below) is recognized to be his central idea; perhaps then it would even be possible to begin constituting something like a ‘School’. These essays could not have been written without a grant from the Volkswagenwerk Stiftung. From the many whom I have to thank for\n\nX\n\nMax Weber: Essays in Reconstruction\n\nassistance and encouragement I would like to name here onlyjoaqum Abelian, Pasquale Pasquino and Keith Tribe. I also owe especial thanks to the staff of the Max Weber Arbeitsstelle in Munich and the custodians of the Weber papers in Merseburg. W.H. Freiburg i.Br., October 1986\n\nTranslator's Note\n\nOnly the third of the following five essays has been published in English in a form comparable to the one which appears here.

First published in the Jahrbuch der Akademie der Wissenschafien in\n\nMax Weber: Essays in Reconstruction\n\n2\n\nfor the existence of these problems in the identification and compre¬ hension of Max Weber’s ‘problematic’. The key to this lies in the circumstances and processes governing the manner in which Weber’s work has come down to us in its present form: that is, how it has come to be propagated in the form that it is in today. Having established a more precise conception of the structure of this legacy, the necessity for the kind of reconstruction that Hennis proposes will become more evident. The ‘reception process’ is best considered as a series of literary events - events which effect a transformation upon the material that is ‘transmitted’. As is sometimes remarked, on his death Weber left no ‘school’ that could assure the institutionalized diffusion of an ‘authorized version’ ofhis thought. In this regard he failed to stamp his mark on the development of the social sciences in interwar Germany. But it must be borne in mind that it is not obvious what such a ‘school’ would have looked like, or with which discipline it would have been associated.\n\nProfessionally, Weber was an economist; his early\n\ntraining and qualification was in law, in which he had written a number ofhistorical essays; he was a founding member of the German Sociology Society; he was active in a number of political issues and associations, so that his death was felt by many to have robbed Germany of one of its leading political figures. In none of these areas was his contribution that of a dilettante; it was taken seriously by leading scholars, intellectuals and politicians. Although Weber is today commonly regarded as a ‘founding father of sociological thought’, this was neither his intention nor the understanding ofhis contemporaries. This is not to say that his work did not have relevance to the development of a sociological tradition, but it was much more than simply this. Albert Salomon, writing ofWeber’s Freiburg Inaugural Address in the socialist monthly Die Gesellschaß, suggested that: it is a curious form of economics that is put forward here; its object is neither laws, nor theories, but man as a social being conditioned by the given social and historical circumstances ofhis existence.1 If this ‘curious form of economics’ fitted into any one discipline then it was into the German sociology of the 1920s. Weber did not regard his project as an essentially sociological one, but it was to this discipline that his work was principally assigned after his death. The fit,\n\n3\n\nTranslator’s Introduction\n\nhowever, was not a good one, leading to an over-emphasis on some aspects ofWeber’s programme and a total neglect of some others. It is from the question of this ‘fit’ that we can perhaps gain access to the reception process following Weber’s death. In 1920 there were no professorial chairs for sociology in Germany. Tönnies and Simmel (who died in 1918) held positions in philosophy, von Wiese in Cologne held a joint appointment in sociology and economics. During 1919 there had been a vigorous debate on this issue, Becker on one side arguing that sociology as a ‘synthesizing’ science required independent representation in all institutions of higher education, while von Below on the other dismissed this as ‘sheer dilettantism’, arguing that sociological work should always be conducted within the framework of another discipline.2 However, during the next few years new chairs in sociology were established, beginning with the installation of Hans Freyer at Leipzig (1925); this was followed by posts at the new universities: Andreas Walther at Hamburg (1927), Alfred Meusel at Aachen (1926), and Theodor Geiger at Brunswick (1928).3 Generally speaking, the sociology that was\n\npromoted\n\nin\n\nthis\n\nfashion\n\nwas\n\nformalized\n\nand\n\nabstract,\n\nemphasizing problems of theory and methodology. Schad in her study of Weimar social research4 concludes that this was the outcome of an aspiration on the part of sociologists for an identifiable academic niche.\n\nEmpirical survey work,\n\nstatistical\n\nevaluation and social policy research had all been conducted before 1914 by economists, historians, psychologists and lawyers. Weber was himself involved in several of these projects, whether on behalf of the Verein für Sozialpolitik or the Evangelisch-soziale Kongreß, and it was this kind of research that he wished to promote with the German Sociological Society, framed with the specific problems that Hennis discloses below. But if sociology was to forge a distinct academic identity in the 1920s, it had to appropriate a domain not already occupied by established academic scholarship. This imperative was lent especial force by the conservative view, represented by von Below, that sociology should always co-exist institutionally with related disciplines. Given the range of social issues and problems confronting Germany in the postwar years, there was ample scope for the development of empirical research on ‘problems of modernity’. And yet in 1930 there was not one ‘authoritative empirical study’ dealing with such problems which was written by a sociologist. The\n\n4\n\nMax Weber: Essays in Reconstruction\n\nwork of Emil Lederer, for many years editorial secretary and then editor of the Archiv far Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik, is one example among many of this. Having conducted research on the situation of salaried employees before the First World W ar, during the 1920s he devoted a great deal of attention to the relation ofunemployment and capitalist development, to the role of unions, the social implications of technological change and the emergent class structure of Weimar Germany.5 Yet Lederer’s appointment was as a full professor of economics in Heidelberg, and his interest in such issues by no means marginalized him in the economics profession; in 1931 he was appointed Professor of Economics at Berlin in succession to Werner Sombart. In 1909 Weber had helped to found the German Sociological Society, initially seeing in it a means of complementing the research of the Verein fur Sozialpolitik with an organization devoted to more rigorous scientific canons and which was not so dedicated to the state socialistic ideas of Schmoller and other ‘older members’ of the Historical School. Unlike the Verein’s inclination to propagate specific ideals, the Society was to embody the neutrality of‘entirely objective research aims’.6 This soon led to a vigorous debate within the Society, since the first meeting in 1910 exemplified the contem¬ porary power of Social Darwinism and perspectives on ‘racial hygiene’ that were anything other than ‘neutral’.7 At the second meeting in 1912 the situation was if anything rather worse, especially in the dis¬ cussion of‘race’ and ‘nation’. It was in the context of these discussions that Weber composed his essay on ‘value neutrality’;1\"' as Käsler points out, this demand for ‘value freedom’ was in this context not merely a methodological principle, but also a strategy for the creation of academic ‘respect’.9 The Society did not meet again until 1922, by which time many of its prominent founders had died, and throughout the 1920s the membership of the Society continued to be substantially composed ofeconomists and other social scientists, hence forming no secure basis for the development of a professional identity.10 Salomon summed up the situation in his survey of interwar German sociology with the words: ‘in Germany, there is no sociology, only sociologists’.11 By the early 1930s, sociology had yet to achieve the institutional standing that the discipline had attained in France and the United States, and remained a matter of significant individuals (who were themselves professionally economists or\n\n5\n\nTranslator’s Introduction\n\nlawyers) and books. With the National Socialist seizure of power and the subsequent purge of the universities that began in April 1933 many of these individuals lost their positions, and it has been estimated that by 1938 about two-thirds of principal and subsidiary teachers of sociology in institutions of higher education had lost their posts.12 Many, on the other hand, had survived and adapted - it should not be assumed that German sociologists were as a body especially ‘social’ or leftist, and there is still in Germany a sociological tradition whose tenets are avowedly conservative. None the less, it was German sociology that formed the principal potential ‘recipient’ and propagator of Weber’s work in the years following his death, although those like Walther, Landshut and Lederer, who devoted major texts to the discussion of Weber’s methodology, were well aware of the range of related writings by Weber that could not be subsumed by the terms of reference German sociological work was writing for itself at this time. Although no ‘school’ was constituted around Weber’s work in the years following his death, this did not mean that his work fell into obscurity. Indeed, Lepsius has argued that the major developmental trend for German sociology in this period did not take place in universities, but rather in popular educational initiatives such as the Hochschule fur Politik in Berlin or the Volkshochschule in Cologne, of which Honigsheim (a student of Weber) was president from 1919 to 1933.13 Weber’s consequent influence on contemporary discussions of social science methodology and the nature of parliamentary democracy was marked, despite the fact that his teaching found no institutional basis. This diffuse influence was, however, fatally shattered in the early years of the National Socialist regime. Those liberal and socialist circles to which Weber’s ideas had appealed were fragmented by persecution and emigration. German sociology had failed to establish the kind of institutional base typical of other social sciences such as politics, economics and psychology; the manner in which it had developed,\n\nas\n\na\n\nmethodological\n\nand\n\nformalized\n\nappraisal\n\nof\n\nmodernity - an intellectual current rather than a pedagogical enter¬ prise - meant that, under attack in the mid-1930s, it survived the period ofNational Socialist rule in a form that was not to be congenial to the reconstructors of postwar Germany, either in East or West. The Weber which we know today has not passed to us through this route.\n\n14\n\nMax Weber: Essays in Reconstruction\n\n6\n\nInstead, as Hennis observes, he joined the emigration and returned to Germany in the late 1940s renewed, reinvigorated - and American¬ ized. The flow of economists, political scientists and sociologists to America in the early 1930s was to have a significant impact on the postwar development of the social sciences, if only because these Central European emigres henceforth addressed the academic world in English, which was to become the language of internationalism.15 Furthermore, by 1933 Max Weber was the most well-known ‘German sociologist’, for the American social sciences had themselves leant heavily upon German academic traditions in their years of foundation. True, up to about 1920 it was Simmel who, via the Chicago Department of Sociology and the work of Albion Small and Robert Park,\n\nexercized great influence on the constitution of\n\nproblems and methods for research. Paradoxically, however, the very success of Small and Park in establishing a coherent research programme meant that their students increasingly ignored the German heritage of this programme. By the mid-1930s, it was Weber rather than Simmel who was regarded as the major German con¬ tributor to the sociological tradition: Maclver’s Society, published in 1937, dealt in some detail with the idea of the Protestant Ethic, and employed Weber in the definition of classes and castes.16 There we have the makings of a Weber we can recognize: the proponent of a ‘thesis’ concerning the relation of Protestantism to capitalism, and a theorist of stratification. The second phase of the Weber reception, then, is one that takes place in the United States, adopting a ‘sociological’ version of Weber already shaped by the German reception of the 1920s, which is then underwritten by the existence of a sociological institutional basis in the United States. It is in this phase that the existence of translations assumes such importance, both making Weber’s writings available to a growing readership and, by virtue of both the selection of texts for translation and the norms of translation applied, conveying a particular appreciation of‘Weber’s sociology’. Here we can see the initial shaping of Weber’s work into a sociological mould being hardened into a received tradition. An early appreciation of Weber published in the United States appeared in the Quarterly Journal of Economics,17 and it was the economist Frank Knight who translated the first text by Weber to appear in English, the General Economic History.18 Again, Parsons’s\n\n7\n\nTranslator’s Introduction\n\nfirst substantial article on Weber was published in the Journal of Political Economy, an established journal for professional economists. This economic filiation is not, however, of any great subsequent signifi¬ cance. The substance of the General Economic History did not lend itself to any obvious generalization concerning economic development and capitalism, while Parsons described the purpose of his essay on Sombart and Weber as placing their theories ‘before American readers in a more condensed and systematic form than that in which they are available in German, and to project them on to the background of their relations\n\nto\n\nthe\n\ngeneral\n\ndevelopment\n\nof\n\nsocial\n\nthought’.19\n\nAccordingly, Parsons first outlined Weber’s use of the concept of ‘ideal type’, before turning to Weber’s primary interest- the nature of modern capitalism conceived in ideal-typical fashion. He then states: The common characteristic of all the principal features of modern society, non-economic as well as economic, Weber sees in their peculiar type of rationality. Its principal institutions belong to his general type of‘rational organisation’, or what he calls in a special sense ‘bureaucracy’.20 On this basis Parsons then introduces the Protestant Ethic, which is placed in the frame of an antithesis between charisma and routinization - and hence in the terms already set up of capitalism, rationality and bureaucracy. This is certainly one reading of the Protestant Ethic\\ but what is important here is the agenda-setting nature of this reading, reinforced by the publication in London in 1930 of Parsons’s trans¬ lation of the Protestant Ethic. Later, writing in his introduction to The Theory of Social and Economic Organisation, Parsons acknowledged that Weber ‘explicitly repudiated the desire to set up a “system” of scientific theory, and never completed a systematic work’. But then he immediately went on: There are, however, exceedingly important systematic elements in his thought, and the volume herewith presented to the world of English-speaking scholarship has been selected for translation precisely because it contains the nearest approach to a comprehen¬ sive statement of those elements of all his published work.21 In this way, Part I of Economy and Society was presented to the Englishspeaking world as a summary of Max Weber’s ‘theory of social and\n\nMax Weber: Essays in Reconstruction\n\n8\n\neconomic organization’. Although by all accounts Parsons’s own Structure of Social Action, originally published in 1937, at first sold very slowly, the version of Weber that it promoted gradually became widely accepted in the United States and,\n\nby extension, was\n\ninfluential in the rest of the English-speaking world. This Max Weber, the theorist of social action, rationality and sociological methodology, was in 1937 unsupported by any substantial translation of original writings. Parsons had set up the proposition that a Weberian ‘system’ existed; he then went about the substantiation of this proposition through the publication of translations that could be read in support of it, although this ‘programme’ took some time to realize. It was not until 1949 that the Methodology of the Social Sciences was published, and the Gerth and Mills selection From Max Weher was first published in 1946. The writings on religion were published during the 1950s, and the Sociology of Law (extracted from Economy and Society) was published in 1954. There appears to besomejustification for concluding that it was the ‘agenda-setting’ activities of Parsons and his associates that played the greatest role in establishing Weber as\n\na classical\n\nsociologist,\n\nan agenda which\n\nwas\n\nthen\n\nsupplemented by the teachings of emigres and the appearance of translations. Representing Weber in this way, Parsons set forth in the world a construction that was based on a set of assumptions, which were then employed in the reading of selected ‘central’ texts. This ‘agenda’ for Weber was then re-imported into Germany with the reconstruction of the postwar years. The German Sociology Society was re-introduced in April 1946 at the instigation of von Wiese: out of the thirty who attended, only ten had belonged to the Society before 1933. The chair in sociology and economics at Cologne was divided, Rene König becoming the incumbent in 1949, from which position in the 1950s he was to be extremely influential in the shaping of a new sociological discipline. Further chairs were founded in Berlin, Frankfurt, Freiburg and Göttingen. Sociology began to assume the shape of a university discipline; the idea of sociology as a ‘synthesizing science’ was discarded, and the emergent discipline did not play a significant role in the political tasks of reconstruction.22 Re¬ education and democratization were for the most part perceived to be the province of political science - the development of an institutional basis for sociology did not imply the adoption of political commit¬ ment ora ‘critical’ profile. König instead sought to lay the emphasis on\n\n9\n\nTranslator’s Introduction\n\nempirical research, with an international orientation. This, of course, meant an orientation to the sociological research promoted in the United States and, consequently, the promotion of Weber as a socio¬ logical theorist of a particular kind. It might be thought that the existence of Weber’s German writings would serve to modify this, recourse being made to texts that did not sit easily within the tradition that had been formed. During the 1920s ‘collected writings’ of a kind had been published: in 1920-21 the three volumes of the writings on religion; in 1921 the political writings; in 1922 the Wissenschafislehre and Economy and Society, finally, in 1924 two collections of social and economic essays. But the last have never since then been\n\nrepublished,\n\nthe political\n\nwritings\n\nwere not\n\nrepublished until 1958, while Economy and Society involves particular problems that will be discussed below. It is perhaps significant that it was Economy and Society, and then the Wissenschafislehre that first appeared after the war, in 1947 and 1951 respectively: texts that could most easily fit into the American version of Weber. For it is not enough to have the texts available in a library or even a bookshop; they have to be readable, that is, an intellectual, cultural or institutional framework has to exist within whose protocols this or that text has a relevance ofsome kind. This is confirmed by the relative obscurity, in academic terms, of the translations of the religious writings that were published in the course of the 1950s; since these do not fit easily with the agenda of Weber as theorist of action and value free science, they have, until a recent revival in interest, had relatively little impact on subsequent general evaluations of Weber. Or, more precisely, they have played a significant role as blocks ofwriting in the propagation of Weber\n\nthe\n\ncomparative\n\nsociologist\n\nand\n\ntheorist\n\nof Western\n\nrationalism, a version that Parsons also did much to promote in later life. The fact that, despite the destruction of the war and the postwar dislocation of archives and libraries, Weber’s writings were more or less accessible in their original form to German readers weighs but little against the selectivity imposed by that which Weber had come to mean to German students and intellectuals. We cannot altogether blame those who put together Weber as a modern sociologist.\n\nAs many have remarked,\n\nhis work was\n\nfragmentary, and it seems logical to seek to make sense of this fragmentation by seeking a common thread. This is what Wilhelm Hennis has done, as many have before him. But, as he so graphically\n\n10\n\nMax Weber: Essays in Reconstruction\n\nargues, it does make a difference how this work is done: with what assumptions, with what material, with what evidence. As he notes in passing, it was characteristic of Weber to promise completions and clarifications that in fact never materialized. Economy and Society is generally agreed to be a torso - or as Wolfgang Mommsen has written, ‘a mixture ofseveral torsos’.23 But this fragmentary nature of Weber’s work is concealed from later readers by the format in which it is presented. Protestant Ethic in its English form consists of two linked essays without the subsequent debate; it is not a book, as so many might assume from the 1930 translation. The final essay in Method¬ ology of the Social Sciences, ‘Critical studies in the logic of the cultural sciences’, first appeared as an essay in the Archiv Jur Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik in 1906. If this issue of the journal is consulted, we find the essay included under the section ‘Surveys of literature’ and, at the end of the piece, an announcement that a further part will follow. Likewise with the critique of Stammler: this exists as a book in trans¬ lation, as an essay in the Wissenschaftslehre, and in the Archiv for 1907 it ends with the words: ‘a further part follows’. As with the ‘Critical Studies’, there never was a further part; but the fact that, at the time he completed the essay for that issue of the journal, Weber had in mind a continuation - this certainly alters our perception of the intentions represented by the texts we have before us today. Weber’s work is not only fragmentary in the sense that his efforts were spread over several fields, any one ofwhich was usually the defining province of a scholar; much of his published work was radically incomplete, hastily written, unrevised, proofed at speed, after publication the manu¬ scripts discarded. For the most part, we do not have before us carefully crafted and considered essays, the results of prolonged reflection on the part of an author who, in intention at least, sought to condense a particular idea into this particular narrative vehicle. Weber got an idea, wrote a paper on it, and before he could completely finish it got distracted by something else, and wrote on that. A notable exception to this is the Inaugural Address of 1895; read against the unpolished prose of the pieces that precede it, this speech certainly bears the marks of some thought and calculated effect. But, for such an event, this is perhaps what we would expect. Speeches at congresses, reviews of literature and books - these were the sorts of thing turned out without great regard for style or presentation. This is an important aspect of Weber’s work, one that has never\n\nTranslator’s Introduction\n\n11\n\nbeen properly explored. In fact, if we are in the business of comparing Marx and Weber, here is perhaps the most significant difference between them: as writers. Karl Marx formulated his ideas by writing, rewriting, and rewriting again. It is our misfortune that much of the material produced in this process has been preserved. Importantly, Capital as a three-volume work is the outcome of this process. It is, of course, known that Engels composed Volumes 2 and 3 of Capital out of Marx’s notes; but scant attention has been paid to the question of how he did this. Recent research indicates that Marx in fact was thinking of one further volume, not two, and that Engels simply inflated the material by combining separate drafts and rewriting material himself. Likewise with the Grundrisse: this enjoyed a vogue as a hitherto unknown ‘central work’, which in fact bore all the signs of what it was: a draft written at speed out of a variety of notebooks, the resulting text having no coherent argument or noticeable structure. Marx discarded it and started again. The work is not without value, but, if we are to draw anything of substance from it, we require a far greater degree of sophistication in philological analysis than that hitherto displayed by Marx scholarship. The difficulty with Marx, for present-day scholarship, is that we require sophisticated analytical techniques and textual knowledge of intimidating proportions for the lengthy work of sifting through repetitions, revisions, deviations and red-herrings. Hitherto such techniques and knowledge have been applied only to small sections of the work, with striking success; but there is real doubt that the considerable effort needed to extend this further could be sustained. With Weber we enter a different world. With the exception of Economy and Society, for which typescripts revised in Weber’s hand exist for those sections on the sociology of law, Weber’s ‘work’ coincides with what he published; the original manuscripts are lost. In any case, they would only serve to correct an existing text that was published in Weber’s lifetime, for there are no hidden projects, no undiscovered ‘central texts’. Even some of the notable ‘unpublished’ texts, such as his lecture outline from 1898, are set up in print. He wrote for publication, and the bibliography appears to be more or less complete. With Marx, extending our gaze beyond the published work confronts us with a mountain of material whose pertinence cannot simply be assumed. With Weber, there is only the printed page.24 The exception to this is Economy and Society, and the problems\n\nMax Weber: Essays in Reconstruction\n\n12\n\nthat this text presents can serve to conclude these remarks on the reception of Weber and the problems of his writing. Wolfgang Mommsen presents a summary of the genesis of the various sections of the work and their associated problems,23 and Essay 2 below also clarifies aspects of the background to the work. A monograph could be written on the construction of the text we have before us today; here, a few observations will have to do. When Weber died in June 1920 he left behind Part 1 (pp. 3-307 of the English edition) as a corrected proof. Marianne Weber assumed editorship, publishing this Part in 1921 as a section of the Grundriß. She then added material from the early drafts dating from 1911-13, and published them separately, all four parts then appearing in 1922 as the first edition of Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft in two volumes. The second edition of 1925 was augmented with a section on the sociology of music, and in 1947 the third edition appeared unchanged. Marianne Weber imposed a tripartite division on the material, seeking to lend the incomplete work as much coherence as possible - and the work was widely recognized to be incomplete and uncompletable. In 1949 Johannes Winckelmann published an article that threw doubt on the form in which Marianne Weber had cast the work. He argued that the first outline of the Grundriß, published in 1914, contained Weber’s ‘original plan’ for the work, from which he did not deviate. On the basis of this ‘plan’, Winckelmann proposed that the text be reorganized as a bipartite work, a form of organization that he suggested was closer to the original intention and that would permit completion of the work. This ‘genuine’ plan involved an initial formal and typological section, followed by dynamic, special sociologies.26 In 1956 the fourth edition, edited by Winckelmann appeared, followed in 1976 by the fifth, which had been reworked yet again. The English translation is based on revisions to the fourth edition, some of which were then incorporated in the fifth.27 The\n\nprocedures\n\nadopted\n\nby\n\nboth\n\nMarianne\n\nWeber\n\nand\n\nWinckelmann have been heavily criticized by Tenbruck - it is suggested that Marianne sought to provide Weber posthumously with a ‘proper book’ as his principal scholarly achievement, although Tenbruck does at the same time argue that, until the appearance of the 1956 edition, readers were aware that they were confronted with unrelated papers from an incomplete project. More seriously, he suggests that the result of Winckelmann’s efforts has been to lend\n\nTranslator’s Introduction\n\n13\n\nthese papers the veneer of a complete work, a veneer imposed by the hand of Winckelmann, not that of Weber.28 He goes so far as to assert that: Foreword, index, text and supplementary notes do not diminish and hide the fact that Economy and Society is not a work of Max Weber, but rather a conjecture on the part of Winckelmann, brought into being by means of re-ordering, summary and the provision of new headings to new divisions.29 Although certain aspects of Tenbruck’s argument are certainly exaggerated, there can be little doubt that serious difficulties exist in judging the status of the text Economy and Society as an expression of the intentions of Weber at the time of his death. Furthermore, it seems doubtful if a ‘more reliable’ text could ever be assembled - those manuscripts that exist are in parts so overwritten that editorial choice is required to make any sense of it at all. And yet at issue is what many have come to regard as Max Weber’s ‘central text’. If this is the case with a work for which, unusually, manuscripts do in part exist, and in a condition that is indicative of Weber’s interest in their revision, where does this leave our appreciation of the bulk of his writing where there are no manuscripts? The project of composing a Gesamtausgabe has been dogged by this very problem: how can we exercise measured and precise editorial judgement if only published writings are available? Put another way, how far is extensive editorial effort justified when the scope of such work is limited to proof¬ reading without manuscript and adding on explanatory notes?30 At the very least, the disputes over the textual status of Economy and Society should make us more circumspect when dealing with texts whose alteration, revision and recasting has been obliterated by the printed word. More circumspect, to be sure; but all the more necessary to reconstruct a body of writing in terms of an intention that has been obliterated by the canonization of Weber as a ‘classical sociologist’. Max Weber certainly seems to need reconstructing; but do we have to learn to read Weber ‘anew’, as Hennis so forcefully argues at the beginning of Essay 1 ? And why should we regard Hennis’s reading as a novel, productive and authoritative turning point in the maze of Weberiana? As Hennis argues below, Weber’s work was not characterized by\n\n14\n\nMax Weber: Essays in Reconstruction\n\nthe presence of a specific field of material proper to one particular academic discipline and which thereby lent it coherence; we rather encounter in his writings a set of questions, which remain a constant through the most diverse material. The purpose of the following essays is to seek out and expose these questions in a manner that is consistent with the intentions of the work. These ‘intentions’ are to be recovered through the examination of the work as a whole, not through the elevation of certain writings to the status of key texts in whose terms the remainder are then read. Hennis certainly believes that Weber’s work can be understood in terms of central themes and questions that were Weber’s own; but the reader of the following essays cannot help but be struck by the variety of sources upon which he draws. We do not have here the promulgation of an intention that has to be ‘constructed’ out of privileged sources or imputed on the basis of a commentator’s ‘insight’. Hennis’s contention that Weber’s central interest is fundamentally anthropological is one that can be supported by a variety of sources, and it is striking that those passages and statements that are cited in evidence are by no means single instances. This recognized, it is all the more baffling that this central interest has never before been recognized for what it is. The persistence and thoroughness with which Hennis presses his argument is also quite unusual for Weber scholarship. Quite literally, Hennis is an advocate for Weber. Hennis came to political science from an academic training in law, like so many German political scientists. The manner in which problems are posed, evidence advanced and arguments constructed in the following essays recalls the style of the courtroom: a defence is being mounted with eloquence and learning, in which simple assertion, prevarication or duplicity would merely undermine the case. Point after point is relentlessly hammered home - but with wit, tenacity and, crucially, relevant evidence. The arguments put in the following essays display an exemplary rigour. In addition to this,\n\nas a political scientist Hennis naturally\n\napproaches Weber through the traditions of political theory. This is not only a long tradition, one ‘as old as civilization itself; the history of political thought is perhaps the most sophisticated branch of intellectual history, in which methods and procedures are established and well-founded. This cannot be said of the history of sociological theory, a form of writing that is not only limited in extent but also in\n\nTranslator’s Introduction\n\n15\n\nsophistication. It is not only that much of the writing on Weber is of a low standard, in which writers feel free to make any and every association or imputation; the discipline to which Weber has been assigned is itself ill-equipped to conduct coherent discussion of its theoretical foundations. This problem could be corrected, of course, but until now sociological writers have not shown a ready command of the historical, methodological, linguistic and philological skills needed to appreciate Weber’s intentions adequately. Hennis does not claim to have written the definitive work of Weber studies; this could only be initiated after the publication of correspon¬ dence at present still in archives. What he has done is to redefine the nature of Weber’s contribution to our understanding of the modern world, and present compelling arguments against those who would have us see Weber as a theorist of universal rationalization, or as a cultural critic of capitalism, or even as a bourgeois response to the ‘challenge of Marxism’. Weber is in need of reconstruction; but not, Hennis argues, as a theorist of society, or of capitalism, or of modernism. According to Hennis, the work of Max Weber belongs in a long tradition of political thought whose focus is on ‘human natures’ - the nature ofhuman personality and that of the forces which mould it. The questions that flow from this - of ‘life orders’, Lebensfiihrung, and the nature of personality in the modern world - are questions that belong to a philosophical anthropology. Recognizing this to be an accurate assessment of Weber’s fundamental orientation by no means reduces the contribution of Weber to our consideration of culture and politics in the late twentieth century; it rather opens up a series of new questions, both about Weber and about the world in which we are placed.\n\nNotes to Translator’s Introduction 1\n\nA.

Except, of course, for the unpublished correspondence, which Wilhelm Hennis uses to great effect in these essays. Although Weber’s ‘writing’ was primarily for publication, there is a body of his work that takes the form of the records of congresses and meetings, in part in direct speech, but also, of course, more or less detailed reports of speeches and contri¬ butions made orally at such gatherings. Essay 2 brings this out. One of the problems in assembling a complete bibliography of Weber’s work has been in tracking down this ‘printed word’ in newspapers, proceedings of meetings, and ephemeral printed material.

But any translator working between the English edition and the German fifth edition of Economy and Society will note substantial differences in paragraphing, and the organization of chapter and section.

Any concern with Weber’s work unavoidably courts debate on the character of modern social science. Whatever might be the ‘spirit’ animating modern social science, its domination has for many years rested upon a mechanical foundation. Never before in the history of the sciences has an orthodoxy (a ‘paradigm’) been able to establish itself so powerfully and decisively and yet with a minimum of intellectual effort. Seldom today challenged, and certain of its utility, modern social science requires only occasional recourse to authority. The greatest, most venerated and silently respected figure of authority is that of Max Weber. Whoever dares to throw doubt on the legitimacy of established social science must direct himself to this figure. For thirty years professional opinion on Weber has been divided. The only significant disputes about Weber’s authority as the intellectual leader of modern social science coincided with its rise to prominence.\n\nWhoever\n\nfound\n\nthis\n\nemergent\n\nand\n\nincreasingly\n\ndominating science empty or futile — despite, or precisely because of, its socio-technical utility - had to break with Weber, turn away from him. Georg Lukäcs and Herbert Marcuse did this in their own way, while Leo Strauss and Eric Voegelin did it in another. Quite clearly each case involved ‘disengagements’ of the most painful sort2 - but in both cases Weber was left the laughing victor. Since then, he has adorned modern social science’s temple of victory as a treasured ancestor and domestic idol. Is this Weber’s proper place? I would like to take up this question. In so doing I am not seeking some new and ‘original’ viewpoint. All engagement with Weber must begin with the contemporary state of\n\n22\n\nMax Weber: Essays in Reconstruction\n\ninquiry. General agreement exists in Weber scholarship on the most pressing desiderata. The wish for a suitable biography capable of replacing Marianne Weber’s Lebensbild has to be put off until we have a complete edition of the plainly enormous collection of letters. Study of Weber must for a long time also make do with the editions of his writings that are to hand. A deeper understanding than that which we have today is in any case to be expected only from the augmentation and correction - quite possibly drastic in nature - that the correspon¬ dence might offer. Nothing, however, stands in the way of an approach to the perhaps most important desideratum in a really thorough investigation of Weber. Not only does the socio-political and cultural background of his generation await study, but the Weltanschauung and the scientific problems in which Weber’s generation so passionately engaged are even further removed from us. We know far too little about these factors, or at any rate not enough for an understanding of Weber’s work in this context.3 The fixation of previous research upon Weber’s epistemological trustees, and his alleged dependency on, or even ‘determination’ by southwest German neo-Kantianism, has brought us not one step closer to an understanding of his work.4 Attempts to distinguish clearly between person and work have proved to be as questionable as the ‘derivation’ of the work from Weber’s psyche. He was a man of genius and a person sensitive to the problems of the world in which we live. Genius and sensibility were expressed, however, in a work that strove to be an academic science. This work as such grew out of the questions that determined the particular sciences with which Weber was occupied. To be able to understand Weber’s own questions and answers we must be familiar with the con¬ temporary questions of Nationalökonomie, Staatswissenschaß, law, history, philosophy, and naturally also ‘sociology’.5 A consensus exists on the point that, after protracted dissection, fragmentation and reduction of the work to a few canonical master¬ pieces and key texts, serious effort must be directed to ascertaining which leading question and intention might lie at the foundation of the work as a whole.6 Hence Weber has to be read afresh and ‘without prejudice’. And that means the entire corpus of his work. No one who becomes really involved with Weber can escape the impression that there is a question that runs through this monumental endeavour - be it in embryo or\n\nMax Weber’s ‘Central Question’\n\n23\n\nhidden in digressions - which makes possible recognition of the work’s unity. Up to now this question has not been disclosed. If on the basis of this question the work is to be genuinely made intelligible and interpretable as a whole, then it should be quite evident that this question must be contained in the work and must be discoverable; and thus may not be introduced from elsewhere, or be the result of inter¬ pretation of an isolated fragment of the work, however significant. Tenbruck’s striking and enduringly authoritative proposition that Weber’s work must be approached as a whole had to miscarry when the theme of disenchantment was identified as this question. While the theme can perhaps be shown to be central to the Economic Ethic of World Religions (WEWR), it has no relevance for an analysis of the Protestant Ethic or even Economy and Society. Only with the assistance of a constructed ‘later work’ - in truth only WEWR — is it possible to maintain ‘rationalization’/‘disenchantment’ as a leading problem.7 Since Tenbruck categorically maintains that Weber developed an ‘anthropological theory’ set down exclusively in the ‘Einleitung’ to WEWR - for (only?) here is to be found how ‘Weber conceives of action and man’s relation to the world’, and not in ‘the more meagre Basic Concepts’relating to this8-hehas, in spite of himself, made the ‘Einleitung’ and ‘Zwischenbetrachtung’ the culmination of Weber’s work without, however, throwing as a result any light on the remaining work. ‘Max Weber’s work’ was not rendered in this fashion ‘as a whole readable and intelligible’ at all.9 I share with Tenbruck and others10 a certainty that ‘Weber’s works are dominated by the unravelling of a fundamental problem which he pursued even in his occasional writings’. But which is it? Tenbruck’s answer coincides with a general opinion that has become a conventional view, seeing Weber’s Lebensthema in the question: ‘what is the meaning of rationality?’11 But does the process of rationalization help us to under¬ stand Economy and Society, its introductory chapter or the body of the text? Does it help to explain the methodology, the planned and completed surveys, the early economic works, the political options? Certainly not. Does it make the sociology of religion intelligible? That I doubt as well. However central the problem of rationalization might have been for Weber, it must, if it is to become the key to his work, be placed in a far wider context - a context in which the reason for this question being so important to Weber will become apparent. Among the first\n\n24\n\nMax Weber: Essays in Reconstruction\n\ninfluential interpreters of Weber’s work, Siegfried Landshut and Karl Löwith were still aware of this context, if only in outline;12 but even they, fascinated by the relation of Weber to Marx, neglected this context in favour of a fixation on the problem of rationality, which was in fact the link between Marx and Weber. To see the process of rationalization as Weber’s fundamental theme is certainly not incorrect. But, as is quite apparent from the state of research on Weber, it is misleading to read everything in its terms and to see it everywhere. Following Bendix, Schluchter has sought to ‘impute’ to Weber’s sociology ‘an explicit decision for the cultural tradition of modern Western rationalism.’13 Why then did Weber write such a corpus? He could have saved himself the trouble and let it go at the ‘explicit decision’.\n\nUnderstanding of his work is not merely\n\nobstructed by the difficulty and ambiguity of the texts. Alongside the difficulty and misunderstanding of Weber’s work there is also unintelligibility at work. It is not so much the complexity, but rather the simplicity of Weber’s problematic - confronting us in our modernity, poised upon our intellectual heights - that is an obstacle to its comprehension.\n\nMax Weber’s ‘Central Question’: The ‘Development of Mensch en turn ’ If we want to understand Weber’s work we must first of all be able to read it. Is it in fact readable? But read it must be, if a ‘decoding of the work at the level of the texts’ - the task set so urgently by Tenbruck can be taken up. The projected Gesamtausgabe is estimated to run to thirty-three hefty volumes. But comprehension of this work is rendered difficult not only by its massive extent, but also by its curious character. In his lifetime Weber only published two ‘proper’ books, and these were the dissertation and Habilitationsschrifi indispensable for an academic career. The entirety of the remaining work consists of survey reports and essays that were, for the most part, hurriedly composed. It was only after his death that these appeared as collections in book form: the collected writings on methodology, on sociology and social policy, on the sociology of religion, on social and economic history, the economic history constructed from student’s notes, the political\n\nMax Weber’s ‘Central Question’\n\n25\n\nwritings, and finally Economy and Society. If we wish to understand adequately an important contribution to the history of learning, there is no proven alternative to an attempt at the establishment of the nature of the academic controversy unleashed among contem¬ poraries . What set of scientific problems did the author treat as given, how did he formulate new questions, how did his colleagues react? This is really nothing other than the understanding of a scholarly author in terms of his ‘historical situation’. The thought of a scholar is not directly determined by social and structural history but, at most, by the manner in which this history finds expression in thought, in the range of scientific problems forming the object of academic concern. In part, Weber’s work is so hard to understand because we are hardly aware of its controversial character.14 Economy and Society has no footnotes, WEWR hardly engaged with other approaches, and articles are usually not reviewed: Weber thus never found it necessary to defend the problematic of his writing and make it in this way more intelligible. In addition, we quite probably know less about the social sciences at the turn of the century than about the state of political theory at the time of Hobbes. For Weber, no book exists that might be compared with Robert Derathe’s Jean Jacques Rousseau et la science politique de son temps. Max Weber was a professional scholar who was in touch with his time; but we hardly know the state of social science in his time, what its central questions were and which - as can be supposed- would thereby enter into his central questions.15 If we wish to read and understand Weber’s scientific work, then we must begin with the work, and try to understand it on the basis of contemporary controversies and in terms of the context of the scientific problems of the time. This provides us with the method for our approach. We have to see whether Weber did not after all once reveal his central preoccupation, and then see if we can detect the red thread that runs from there through all his work. Max Weber always took great trouble - with whatever success - to specify his current ‘problematic’. This resulted from his fundamental view that ‘It is not the “actual” interconnections of “things” but the conceptual interconnections of problems that define the scope of the various sciences’.16 If Weber, because of the curious format of his work, never had cause in general to define his problematic more exactly, there is nevertheless one exception in his writings. The most\n\nMax Weber: Essays in Reconstruction\n\n26\n\nfamous of all his works,\n\nThe Protestant Ethic and the ‘Spirit’ of\n\nCapitalism, involved him, for a number of years, in a polemic conducted with great passion. Here, and only here, he saw himself forced, or grudgingly induced, to render his problematic more exact where it was misunderstood. Until recently the study of Weber has paid little attention to these supplementary essays; only through Winckelmann’s\n\n1968\n\nedition\n\nof Kritiken\n\nund Antikritiken\n\nzur\n\nProtestantischen Ethik have they found a wider audience.17 Just as the decoding of unfamiliar writings is possible only when at least a few syllables are legible, so we create a basis for the understanding of Weber when we might hope that we have at least properly understood one piece of the work. It is only in the case of the Protestant Ethic that Weber himself can help us, as far as is possible, to correct misunder¬ standings of his problematic. The content of this well-known study does not have to be recounted here. The ‘Weber-thesis’ has long been misunderstood as a causal hypothesis on the origin of capitalism. This no longer happens among German scholars.18 Today, the prevailing view runs as follows: Weber sought to establish the mental orientation ‘adequate’ to the rise of modern capitalism in the form of a repeatedly emphasised ‘elective affinity’ between the ‘spirit of capitalism’ and the ‘protestant ethic’ .But this also misrecognizes the stake as Weber saw it—although he often enough wrote as if this were sufficient as a research object, consequently distorting the radical nature of his ‘problematic’ through a constant emphasis on the ‘restricted nature’ ofhis object of research. This ‘problematic’ will be our sole concern in the following. The renowned investigation of the Protestant Ethic is available to us today in two versions: as the articles of 1904—5 and in the version revised for GARS I by Weber in 1920, the latter version being supplemented and in part taking note of criticism. If we take the second version, the most elaborated investigative objective of these essays is represented as: the establishment of‘the rational conduct of life (Lebensfiihrung) on the basis of the idea of calling as one of the ‘constitutive elements of the modern capitalist spirit, and not this alone, but of the spirit of modern culture’.19 Why should we stop at this sentence? Is the author really only interested - it could be read in this way - in understanding, if not capitalism, then ‘the modern capitalist spirit’? Or are we concerned with the historical origins of the ‘rational Lebensführung’ of the modem ‘professional man’, or Berufemensch?\n\n27\n\nMax Weber’s ‘Central Question’\n\nFor a more precise grasp of the sentence, let us reduce it to its essence by the use of emphasis: ‘One of the fundamental elements of the spirit of modern capitalism, and not only of that but of all modern culture: rational conduct on the basis of the idea of the calling, was born - that is what this discussion has sought to demonstrate - out of the spirit of Christian asceticism.’ Read in this way, it would appear that Weber’s real concern was with the historical genesis of the ‘rational Lebens¬ führung . If we compare the version from 1920 with that of 1905 we find that, apart from a tiny editorial alteration, Weber found nothing on which he could improve. Generally speaking, no changes were made above the line to the text’s dramatic closing passages that begin with this\n\nparagraph,\n\nexcept for minor clarifications; and the\n\nsupplementary material in the notes (apart from more recent biblio¬ graphic additions) exclusively serves the purpose of making quite clear that, with regard to the 1905 edition, ‘no ground’ existed for any correction.2'1 If we may be allowed to see in the emphasized passages above the essence of Weber’s problematic, we can conclude that Weber remained true to it fifteen years later. The theme of 1905, just like that of 1920, would be the genealogy of the modern ‘rational Lebensführung’ by a ‘historical representation’. Let us see whether we cannot,\n\nwith\n\nthe\n\nassistance\n\nof the\n\n‘Antikritiken’,\n\nmake\n\nthis\n\nproblematic clearer. Weber’s ‘Antikritiken’ (in fact, four pieces altogether, which took up 85 closely printed pages of the Archiv, representing then a ‘reinforcement’ a good three-quarters(l) the length of the original, normally printed 164 pages) exclusively address the criticisms of H. Karl Fischer and Felix Rachfahl. In the 1920 version, Fischer - this presumptuous ‘incompetent’, this ‘Herr Kritiker’21 - was granted not a single mention, while Rachfahl on the other hand gained one in the first note, which in effect simply dismissed him. Weber has ‘in this edition added nothing from the unavoidably rather unprofitable polemic against Rachfahl, only taking account of the (very few) additional references in his Antikritik, and by means of extra sentences or remarks sought to rule out all future conceivable misunder¬ standing’.22 We could be permitted to say: seldom has anyone had such bad fortune in the avoidance of misunderstanding. The libraries written on the ‘Weber thesis’ would otherwise never ever have been written. Close examination shows that Weber in fact takes up virtually\n\n28\n\nMax Weber: Essays in Reconstruction\n\nnothing from the debates with Rachfahl in the 1920 edition. The critical discussion is here directed towards Sombart, and above all Brentano. It therefore seems worth while to subject the Antikritiken to a thorough study, these writings which were thought so unprofitable that they were subsequently disregarded in GARS. It is worth seeing whether they might yield up something that could ‘rule out in future’, if not all, then at least ‘further misunderstanding’ of Weber’s problematic. For these anti-critical essays were exclusively concerned with the clearing up of misunderstandings of his ‘problematic’, rebutting and if possible securing freedom from such misunder¬ standings for the future. It is for this reason that these writings should in fact have been regarded for the past 75 years as the most important supplementary texts for argument on the Weber ‘thesis’! Together with the additions and clarifications included in the GARS version, Weber hoped to have permanently clarified further ‘misunder¬ standings’. We know that he failed in the most fantastic manner. But is there nothing for our questioning of Weber’s ‘problematic’ that can be found in these ‘unprofitable’ anticritical essays? We had seen that the quintessence that the ‘exposition’ of the PE essays should ‘demonstrate’ must be perceived as the birth of the ‘rational Lebensfiihrung' from the spirit of Christian asceticism. In his first reply to Fischer, Weber stated his intention of taking each point of criticism, ‘no matter how misconceived’, and using them to identify ‘at which point in the discussion misconceptions could arise, which the author, whether himself at fault or not, had insufficiently taken into account.’23 Which points had Weber ‘insufficiently taken into account’? This is what the replies are all about. ‘The points’ are made unmistakably clear in the following passage: I therefore take no responsibility for those misconceptions upon which, in my opinion, the foregoing criticism is based. I will, however, on the occasion of a separate edition of the essays (which for technical publishing reasons cannot be long postponed), try once more to remove each expression which could be understood in terms of a derivation of economic forms from religious motives - a derivation which I in fact never make - and therefore make it even clearer, if possible, that it is the spirit of a ‘methodical’ Lebens¬ führung, which should be ‘derived’ from ‘asceticism’ in its Protestant transformation, and which even then stands in a cultural-historical\n\nMax Weber’s ‘Central Question\n\n29\n\nrelation of ‘adequacy—equivalence’ (Adäquanz) which is very important in my opinion. For this stimulus I must thank mv ■ • 04 J critic. . The impulse to a new and separate edition relates plainly to making ‘even clearer’ the point that the issue in the PE essays was ‘the derivation of the spirit of a “methodical” Lebensfiihrung’. On the immediately following page in this first anticritical essay, Weber again emphasizes that ‘Jakob Fugger and similar economic supermen’ were precisely ‘not characteristic’ of ‘that spirit of sober methodic existence (Lebensmethodik), the analysis of which concerns me here’.25 What does concern him becomes clearer when he informs the ‘Herr Kritiker’ that it ‘would definitely be a great deal easier for the discovery of the chain of historical causality (kausalen Regressus) if we could deduce the emergence of specific characteristic styles of life simply from the abstractions ofa “psychology” \\26 Weber could not help having another go at Fischer, following the first reply of July 1907 with another, in January 1908. Fischer’s brief, polite five and a halfpage contribution, which left it ‘to the thoughtful reader to decide’ whether the objections brought forward by his ‘Herr Gegenkritiker’ were valid, was met with a cannonade of more than twice the length from Weber: ‘Here specialist knowledge is lacking. He simply does not realise that the decisive sources for my treatment of the way in which the conduct oßife is influenced. . . have nothing to do with “edificatory” or “dogmatic” purposes, they are concerned rather with the problems of everyday living (Lebensgestaltung), and which they therefore illuminate. ’27 The very same ‘point’ is thus again at issue: the influences on Lebensfiihrung, the changes in ‘everyday life’. He was not trying to ‘get at motive factors in historical affairs’ in a particular epoch, nor trying to find Weal motive forces ’ - ‘such spectres in history do not exist for me’ - he has instead investigated ‘exactly according to [his] declared purpose’: ‘in what way (Richtung) the specific religious forms of the diverse Protestant ascetic tendencies (these forms themselves decisively co-determined by fundamental metaphysical presuppositions) have influenced the conduct of life, there, where such influence in fact existed. ’28 He was concerned - here is a further formulation of his views - with ‘the clarification of the “characterological” effects of specific forms of piety, in so far as such effects are here relevant’.29 ‘Evidently’ he is talking of a ‘methodical\n\n30\n\nMax Weber: Essays in Reconstruction\n\nLebensführung' ‘in the sense in which it is analysed over several dozen pages of my articles, that is, how as a component of the modern “ethic of calling” (Berufsethik) it has influenced life’.30 Weber makes his concern more precise in his counter to the ‘Sombartian problematic’ (‘what is the origin of the modern economic significance of capitalist economic forms?’). ‘For my problematic, which addresses itself to the rise of the ethical Lebensstil spiritually adequate to the economic stage of capitalism and which signifies its triumph in the “souls” of men his terminology is appropriate, in his view.31 (It might be noted here in passing that Weber’s novel and, until today, so puzzling ‘problematic’ first becomes immediately intelligible if comparison is made with the first volume of Sombart’s monumental work Modern Capitalism-, published in 1902, this folio was entitled ‘The genesis of capitalism’, the third section, ‘The genesis of the capitalist spirit’ being of relevance here. If Weber wished to present something new then it could not be in terms of the significance of Protestantism for the rise of capitalism. That Protestantism ‘particularly in its Calvinist and Quaker varieties has materially advanced the development of capitalism’ had just been characterized by Sombart as a ‘too wellknown fact’ and one that ‘was in no need of further substantiation’.32 Weber’s own problematic has therefore to be something quite different.) We must remember: the replies to Fischer sought to clarify the ‘problematic’. At issue-and quite distinct from Sombart’s approachis the ‘influencing of Lebensfiihrung', the ‘characterological’ effects of particular kinds of piety and - somewhat more ‘emphatically’ Weber’s ‘problematic’ in its ‘portentousness’ ( - for it is ‘a segment from the path of humanity’s destiny’ -); and plainer, ultimately the triumph of the ‘ethical Lebensstil' which signified the triumph of capitalism in the ‘souls’ of men. Even such a liberal use of inverted commas cannot hide how radical the question is, whose ‘Lebens¬ führung’ is at stake here, whose ‘roots’ are being grubbed up with a ‘purely historical mode of presentation’. The dispute with Rachfahl revealed these roots completely. Two years passed after the reply to Fischer, and then injanuary 1910 it was Rachfahl’s turn. It cannot be said that Weber’s replies to queries and formulations on the part of his critics are distinguished by great lucidity. For the reader with average demands - seeking an intro¬ ductory sketch of the problem, a rough outline ofthe object ofinvesti-\n\nMax Weber’s ‘Central Question ’\n\n31\n\ngation, an indication of the mode of procedure — these essays constituting the Protestant Ethic are a didactic catastrophe; this is perhaps the basis of their indestructible attraction. Nothing should have prevented Weber —friend to clear concepts —from stating clearly right at the beginning what he meant by the ‘spirit of capitalism’. All miscomprehension follows from this unholy baptismal act. Why ‘christen’ a style of regulating life, a ‘Habitus’, a particular form of conducting one’s life (Lebensfiihrung), as the ‘ “Spirit” of Capi¬ talism’33 - when it is ‘quite obvious’ that there are cases of capitalism without this Habitus and cases where the Habitus exists without capitalism?34 What sort of ‘spirit’ is that, and why the spirit of ‘capitalism’? Now, in the meantime, we know what Weber meant, but Rachfahl was quite right in pressing his request for clarification: competently, in no way ‘derisively’,35 nevertheless with ‘collegial’ though not at all unfriendly irony. Weber’s aggressive and arrogant polemic appears out of place and unprepossessing. In any case, we must be lastingly grateful to Felix Rachfahl that he, by virtue of his undiminishing insistence, forced Weber to a precise exposition of his scientific intentions. In his first reply to Rachfahl, Weber repeats the well-known positions: he ‘has hitherto sought to make intelligible only one particular phenomenon of Lebensfiihrung in its (original) religious specificity’.36 (‘Hitherto . . . only one’! - we shall see later that Weber’s ‘research programme’ at the end of PE, whose clarification we principally owe to the debate with Rachfahl, exclusively relates to further factors of Lebensfiihrung and not to some obscure ‘process of Occidental rationalism’!) He details what the ‘capitalist spirit’ is about: ‘For the development of that particular Habitus, which I (ad hoc and purely for my own purposes) called the “capitalist spirit”.’37 A small alteration to the title could have saved himself and his readers many misunderstandings: The Protestant Ethic and the ‘Capitalist’ Habitus-it sounds less mysterious and describes what is meant! That ‘Spirit’ as a motive force is (or can be) behind every human Habitus, and Habitus can in turn form the Spirit - a clarificatory footnote would have sufficed. Consequently, the whole investigation does not involve a ‘spirit’ at all, but rather a Habitus, in concrete terms the unfolding of a particular kind of Lebensfiihrung ‘within the orders of the world: family, economic life (Erwerbsleben), social community’38 for which the puritan ‘saints’ were the pacemakers. Weber’s chosen task was\n\n32\n\nMax Weber: Essays in Reconstruction\n\n‘intially to establish . . . how, through which spiritual motivational connections, specific formations of Protestant belief were enabled to function in the way that they did’.39 Whoever found ‘this entire “psychology” ’ ofno interest ‘but was only [interested in] the external forms of economic systems’ were politely requested ‘to leave these essays unread, but also do me the favour of allowing me my interest in this spiritual side of modem economic development.’40 In the continuation ofthis sentence-this is still the first Rachhhl-AntikritikWeber finally allows a glimpse of his real concern. He is interested in ‘the spiritual side of modem economic development . . . which in Puritanism displays a state of characteristic equilibrium in the great inner tensions and conflicts between “vocation”, “life” (as we freely say today), and “ethics”, an equilibrium which existed in this form neither before nor afterwards’.41 To continue: ‘and indeed in a domain where the traditions of antiquity and the Middle Ages disclose other paths, and within which we today live in the midst of renewed tensions which - far beyond the bounds of the sphere which I have stressed - develop into cultural problems of the first order known, in this form, only to our “bourgeois” world’. The ‘sphere’ that Weber ‘stressed’ was that of the ‘vocation’, of acquisitive activity (Erwerbsleben). The Puritans had brought the great ‘internal tensions’ between vocation, life and ethics into a ‘character¬ istic equilibrium’; for them there was no ‘on the one hand and on the other’, ‘theory and practice’, they rather conducted their lives ‘totally’, harnessed, consciously, ‘methodically’, at one with God and themselves - presupposing the corresponding Lebensführung. Today we live ‘within renewed tensions’ and now they reach ‘far beyond the bounds ofthe sphere which I have stressed’ and these tensions lavishly grow today into ‘cultural problems of the first order’, as they ‘in this form’\n\nare only\n\n‘known\n\nto\n\nour\n\n“bourgeois”\n\nworld’.\n\nAscetic\n\nPuritanism has helped in the creation of ‘the soul of the Berufs¬ mensch’ ,42 a specific component part of the lifestyle ‘that stood at the cradle of modern capitalism.’43 Since Weber’s investigations were never completed - ‘my constant handicap’ - only ‘an initial part of the historical development of the idea of the “vocation” and its engage¬ ment with acquisitive activity was as such properly presented’.44 ‘My essays neither sought nor claimed more than this.’45 Really? Weber resorts repeatedly, in both replies to Rachfahl, to the thesis of Adäquanz as the sole epistemological objective. But does the matter\n\nMax Weber’s ‘Central Question’\n\n33\n\nend there? No! For: ‘Those components of capitalist “spirit” in modernity which I analysed especially: the idea of the “duty of the vocation” with all that depends upon it [W. H.]. . .reaches. . .beyond the domain of the economic into quite heterogeneous spheres of human action [W. H.].’46 Which ones? The author does not tell us, but rather creeps back into his shell, proceeding right away to state that: ‘The development of Berufsmenschentum in its significance as a component of the capitalist “spirit” - my analyses have initially limited themselves expressly and intentionally to this theme. I cannot help it if careless readers take a price in ignoring this.,47 From time to time our patience with Weber is really strained! What is the meaning of this haughtiness, these disdainful mannerisms? ‘Initially’, ‘expressly’ and ‘intentionally’, ‘limited’. But we calm down again, and can proceed. So ‘initially’: Berw/smenschentum’. Rachfahl’s criticism must have deeply wounded Weber; nothing else can account for his aggravated tone. The fact of being no further forward with the matter, that it showed no sign of completion,48 the whole undisclosed-petty jealousy with Troeltsch over priority - he could free himself from none of this; he repeatedly refers to the essay on sects, in which however he deals with the problem from a completely different direction. His repeated protestation that he has ‘intentionally’ approached the problem ‘from the aspect most difficult to grasp and “prove”, relating to the inner Habitus’,49 is not free of professorial coquetry - and he displays, by the confusion thereby created, a low level of ability in questions of ‘didactic’ sensitivity. Why did he only ‘indicate’ the ‘powerful influence of education’, ‘discipline in the sects, etc.’ instead of, if his interest was addressed to the factors most difficult to grasp and ‘prove’, at least tabulating them at the beginning and thus conceding the significance of the more transparent ‘factors’, and then turning to those ‘factors’ that were particularly hard to ‘grasp’, the ‘factors’ that were remodelling the ‘soul’ of modern man ‘from within’?50 We do not know, and leave this question to the biographers. At the end of the first reply to Rachfahl, Weber characterized the ‘sects’ as ‘archetypes’ of those formations that today mould ‘public opinion’, ‘cultural values’ and ‘individuality’. He thus lines up, not in so many words but substantially, that great complex of problems upon which his whole sociology turns, as we shall see later. But to\n\n34\n\nMax Weber: Essays in Reconstruction\n\n‘elaborate on this’, or to examine more closely the ‘array of filiations connecting the puritanical lifestyle to the present’,51 is not possible on this occasion. The ‘array offiliations connecting the puritanical lifestyle to the present’ - a closer examination of this was the purpose behind the ‘research programme’ announced at the end ofPE. But in what sense, or what the cognitive intention might be that lay behind this research programme - Weber does not betray this in 1905, and in the GARS version of 1920 he again keeps it to himself. But he allows us to take a look in the second reply to Rachfahl. This reply, which was the ‘Anticritical Last Word’ in this ‘laborious business of debate’52 was published in September 1910. It is almost double the length of the first, and is divided into two sections, the first presenting ‘a discussion which is unavoidably rather tedious’, Weber suggesting that this ‘might be passed over by the non-specialist reader’ - a suggestion that we gladly go along with. But the nerveracking polemic of the first section must be dealt with, for two reasons. Once again, Weber proclaims that he is only concerned with the Adäquanz problem. As he states: in the earlier debate with Fischer he had established that ‘my investigations concern only the analysis of the development of an ethical lifestyle adequate to emergent modern capitalism’.53 We shall soon seen whether this self-interpretation can still be maintained a few pages later in the text. Secondly: this section opens up a perspective on the deeper, human, ‘personal’ meaning of the ‘power of the ascetic Lebensmethodik which I have analysed’ - whether the Lebensstil growing out of this is still suffused with religious conditions, or whether it has emancipated itself from them. If the latter is the case, then this Lebensstil lacks ‘a decisive foundation in personal life’. For the moment, however, we will set a closer inter¬ pretation of these passages54 to one side, important as they are for understanding the whole Weber and his deepest motives. We now turn to the second section, ‘enough at last of such lengthy polemic’.55 Right at the beginning of his second reply to Rachfahl, Weber announces that in the second section he will summarize ‘his actual theses once more in a few pages’;56 this was for the sake of clarity following the confusion that had been created by Rachfahl. Leaving aside the notes, he takes all of 24 pages.57 Taking Rachfahl’s wellmeant indication of how Weber ‘should have been able to do it’ (this will not be dealt with here) Weber argued that Rachfahl had oriented the problem in a manner ‘that in no way corresponded with my\n\nMax Weber’s ‘Central Question’\n\n35\n\nintentions’, then at last proceeding to a concise summary of his intentions: ‘for my central interest was not the promotion of the expansion of capitalism,\n\nbut rather the development of that\n\nMenschentum, which was created by the conjunction of religious and economic components: that was clearly stated at the close of my essays’.58 Here at last we have Weber’s ‘central’ concern, and he appears to have noticed that it was he and not Rachfahl who is to blame for all the confusion, since he continues: ‘As became apparent eventually (obviously on account of the prevailing confusion, W. H.], I should moreover have placed, right at the beginning of the discussion, so that I could develop the programme as far as is possible, a definition of the complexity which can be contained in the concept “spirit of capitalism” ’. It is difficult to follow Weber at this point, and one can only admire Rachfahl’s patience, which bore so well the hideand-seek and intentional or non-intentional confusion of these ‘central’ intentions. What Max Weber now in the autumn of 1910 reveals, in all innocence - that his ‘central interest’ was the ‘develop¬ ment of Menschentum’ created by elective affinity - he could have stated this (‘as a favour’ one could say in his tones) in November 1904 at the beginning of his first essay, rather than winding his way towards it through the Baden statistics on occupation, taxation and confession. It borders on impudence now, some six years later, to state clearly for the first time that what interested him ‘centrally’ was the ‘development of Menschentum’, but that this had however been ‘clearly stated’ ‘at the close of my essays’. At the close of these essays the reader was informed that‘we are forced. . . to work in a calling’,59 that the ‘universality of man’ was a thing of the past, that a departure must be made from an age of‘full and beautiful humanity’, etc., etc. But then the author had immediately closed the curtain again: ‘But this brings us to the world ofjudgements of value and of faith, with which this purely historical discussion need not be burdened. ’60 There is nothing at the end of the 1905 edition that intimates to the reader that the‘programme’, ‘more, the task’in hand, relates to the‘development of Menschentum’. How else could we have been blind to this for 77 years, from 1905 to the present? With the sentence (‘But this brings us . . . ’) cited above, the reader is brought once again, in the familiar and forced emphasis on the ‘limited nature of the objectives’, down to the level of empirical research, of ‘historical discussion’. For directly following is the‘programme’:‘The next task would be . . .’\n\n36\n\nMax Weber: Essays in Reconstruction\n\nIf words mean anything, then we might now at any rate be permitted to establish unambiguously Weber’s ‘central’ interest in the essays on the Protestant Ethic: the ‘development of Menschentum’ and how it was most deeply influenced by a particular ‘concatenation of circumstances’:61 The‘elective’conjunction of‘ascetic Protestantism’ (expressed in the idea of vocation) with early bourgeois capitalism, forming together a new mode of rational Lebensführung for Berufs- und Fachmenschen. Asceticism had assisted in ‘constructing the mighty cosmos of the modern economic order’ ‘which today determines the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism'. Out of a ‘light cloak’, ‘fate decreed’ that an ‘iron cage’ should develop. Since asceticism undertook to remodel the world and to work out its ideals in the world, material goods have gained an increasing and finally inexorable power over the lives of men as at no previous period in history. T oday the spirit of religious asceticism - whether finally, who knows? - has escaped from the cage. But victorious capitalism, since it rests on mechanical foundations, needs its support no longer. . . Where the fulfilment of the calling cannot be directly related to the highest cultural and spiritual values . . . the individual generally abandons the attempt tojustify it at all.1'2 The ‘world of judgements of value and of faith’ in which Weber so ‘clearly’ at ‘the close of his essays’ became involved - is this part of his ‘person’? Or is it after all to do with his ‘works’? Menschentum is certainly the issue here: ‘all individuals’, ‘men’, ‘the individual’, and the ‘ “last beings” in this cultural development’.63 No one might know here ‘who’ (decoded into the terms of the ‘central interest’ this can only mean: which Menschentum) ‘will live in this cage in the future, or whether at the end of this tremendous development entirely new prophets will arise, or there will be a great rebirth of old ideas and ideals. . .’ None the less: might not these statements belong to those that Tenbruck believes the majority of sociologists will treat quite simply as nonsense? We cannot therefore declare ourselves satisfied with the assumption that these obscure closing passages ofPE refer to Weber’s ‘central’ interest, and thereby that the ‘programme’ is related to the ‘development of Menschentum’. We would like to convince every reader that this is by no means ‘nonsense’, and so we will renew our approach to the issue.\n\nMax Weber’s ‘Central Question\n\n37\n\nIf Weber was telling the truth at the end of the ‘Anticritical Last Word’, that in the 1904—5 essays he was really ‘centrally’ interested in the ‘development of Menschentum', the pages taken unchanged from this edition (GARS I, middle ofp. 202 to foot of p. 204) can serve the open-minded reader as a useful key to this special ‘interest’, this ‘value relation’, this scientific research interest in the ‘development of Menschentum’ which is to be ‘problematized’ and made into an ‘object’ ofinvestigation. Weber treated these questions in part in the PE essays and in the article on sects for the Christliche Welt, those ‘two older essays’ placed at the beginning of GARS I ‘which attempt, at one important point, to approach the side of the problem which is generally the most difficult to grasp: the influence of certain religious ideas on the development of an economic spirit, or the ethos of an economic system’.64 But this is in the ‘Introduction’ written for GARS I in 1920. However interested the author of 1904-5 was in the ‘development of Menschentum’, we know quite well that the one in 1920 who wrote the ‘Vorbemerkung’, or the one who wrote WEWR, had quite different and much more specific ‘cognitive interests’ - this much has been corroborated by more than two generations of scholarly endeavour (but I am reluctant to simply repeat this, and refer it to that which has cost so many so much shoe-leather, a footnote).65 Weber’s ‘research programme’, outlined at the end of PE, has provided the strongest inspiration for all the ‘interpretations’, reformulations’ and ‘explications’, etc.,66 of Weber’s intentions concerning the more detailed working-out of what is generally accepted as his ‘central interest’: the ‘development of Occidental rationalism’. But this ‘research programme’ from the summer of 1905 is taken over unaltered — apart from a single explicatory editorial insertion - in the 1920 text. In historical-philological terms, there¬ fore, strictly speaking Weber’s ‘central’ interest as expressed in this programme can only be that of 1905. It is conceivable that his interest was the same in 1920, it is also possible that despite variant formulations of this interest the actual substance was the same in 1905 and 1920; but what cannot be accepted is the possibility of attributing to the 1905 ‘research programme’ a ‘cognitive interest’ from 1920 which does not in turn coincide with that formulated in 1905. Did Weber develop somewhere a ‘research programme’ in 1920, or between 1905 and 1920, that could be compared with that of 1905? Clearly not, with one exception, however, to which we shall shortly\n\nMax Weber: Essays in Reconstruction\n\n38\n\nturn. His generally accepted all-embracing research interest - in Tenbruck’s formulation, ‘what does rationality mean?’, or in the more usual terms, ‘the development of Occidental rationalism —is at best the outcome of interpretation, at most a hypothesis introduced into the work from elsewhere. The‘classical’, one might say sole, text read for this interpretation is the ‘Vorbemerkung’ to GARS;67 here it is indeed stated that it ‘is our first concern to work out and to explain genetically the special peculiarity of Occidental rationalism’68 and the introduction to WEWR is enthusiastically cited to the effect that it seeks by its presentation to be itself a contribution to the casuistry of ‘processes of rationalization’.69 But to what kind of ‘processes of rationalization’? In fact, only to those which related to ‘all forms of practical ethics' and to the ‘rationalisation of Lebensßihrung' ,7I] But we are getting ahead of ourselves. To clarify the nature of the 1905 ‘research programme’, to see whether it perhaps does refer to the ‘Occidental rationalization process’ and not to the ‘central’ interest in the ‘development of Menschentum' first made explicit in 1910, we had best return to the earlier versions of the essays composing PE. Maybe somewhere here there is a statement concerning the ‘Occidental rationalization process’ or somesuch. For on what else could the research programme be based? In the GARS version the first time that the concept of rationalization appears is n. 1 to p. 35. 1 Brentano takes Franklin’s ethic, reported by Weber in 1904 as ‘the earning of more and more money. . . thought ofso purely as an end in itself, that from the point of view of the happiness of, or utility to, the single individual,\n\nit\n\nappears\n\nentirely\n\ntranscendental\n\nand\n\nabsolutely\n\nirrational’ as the occasion ‘to criticize the later discussion of “rationali¬ zation and discipline” to which worldly asceticism has subjected men. That, he says, is a “rationalization” for an irrational Lebensßihrung'. This remark cannot be examined in closer detail here - we are plainly dealing with an insertion from 1920. Where then does the concept first occur in the 1904-5 edition? On p. 61,72 where it is stated: ‘It might thus seem that the development of the spirit of capitalism is best understood as part of the development of rationalism as a whole, and could be deduced from the fundamental posture of rationalism on the basic problems of life.’ Protestantism would therefore only be considered historically in so far as it had played a role as a ‘stage prior to the development of a purely rationalist philosophy’. But it only ‘seems’ to be this way. For, as Weber goes on to say, ‘any serious\n\nMax Weber’s ‘Central Question’\n\n39\n\nattempt to carry this thesis through makes it evident that such a simple way of posing the question will not work, simply because of the fact that the history of rationalism shows a development which by no means follows parallel lines in the individual areas of life.’ A number of examples are then introduced, before proceeding as follows: ifunder practical rationalism is understood the type of attitude (jene Art Lebensfiihrung) which sees and judges the world consciously in terms of the worldly interests of the individual ego, then this view of life (Lebenstil) was and is the special peculiarity of the peoples of the liberum arbitrium, such as the Italians and the French are in very flesh and blood. But we have already convinced ourselves that this is by no means the soil in which that relationship of a man to his calling as a task, which is necessary to capitalism, has pre-eminently grown. In fact one may [and here the author inserts in the 1920 version an incisive clarification] - this simple proposition, which is often forgotten, should be placed at the beginning of every study which seeks to deal with rationalism - rationalise life from fundamentally different basic points of view and in very different directions. Rationalism is a historical concept which covers a whole world of different things . . . We are here particularly interested in the origin of precisely the irrational element which lies in this, as in every concept of a calling.73 The ‘rationalism’ or rather ‘rationalization’ to which Weber solely devotes himself in PE is therefore the particular transformation, Disziplinierung and Methodisierung of everyday (i.e. in particular but not exclusively) economic Lebensfiihrung. ‘The ethical practice of everyday men will thus stand revealed in its lack of plan and system and elaborated as a deliberate method of Lebensfihrung.’ PE is about this, and only this; not one subordinate clause, nothing in PE warrants the assumption that the investigation is conceived as one of Weber’s contributions to the explanation of the ‘universal historical process of development of Occidental rationalism’ or however this Weberian ‘cognitive interest’, now become a routinized formulation, might be known. Let us return again to the author’s own description of what ‘this discussion has sought to demonstrate’: One of the fundamental elements of the spirit of capitalism and not\n\n40\n\nMax Weber: Essays in Reconstruction\n\nonly of that but of all modern culture: rational conduct on the basis of the idea of the calling, was born - that is what this discussion has sought to demonstrate-from the spirit of Christian asceticism.74 Nothing in the closing pages ofPE gives us a firm indication of the allembracing problematic in which this result can be placed. We are still the patient reader is here reminded of this and requested to excuse all complications-in search of Weber’s ‘problematic’ and thus also ofthe ‘value-relevance’\n\n(Wertbeziehung)\n\non\n\nthe\n\nbasis\n\nof which\n\nthis\n\nproblematic can be explained and justified. We might recall that Weber’s debates with the critics ofPE should help us in our search. Do they do so, or must we come to terms with the fact that the PE essays represent a ‘purely historical discussion’,\n\nwhich need not be\n\n‘burdened’ with judgements of value and of faith’? There is no doubt that we are confronted with a ‘purely historical discussion’. But why did Weber devote a ‘purely historical discussion’ to these questions and not to a ‘scuffle between two tribes of Kaffirs or Indians’?73 After all these diversions we stand again before the declaration of 1910 with empty hands: he was interested ‘centrally’ in the ‘develop¬ ment of Menschentum’ and this was ‘stated clearly’ at the end of his essays. He refers in this way to the ‘programme’ that can be found there. Since he never suggested that he wished to write the universal history of the penetration of Occidental rationalism, we resist attempts to relate the 1905 programme to any such unannounced cognitive interest. He had declared a ‘central’ interest in the ‘development of Menschentum’ and in the sentence directly following this declaration of interest he refers to this programme (‘so that I could as far as possible develop this programme’).76 If Weber’s ‘central’ interest was the ‘development of Menschentum’ and had, with the essays on the Protestant Ethic, completed a part of this programme (a partial illumination of the genesis of Berufsmenschentum) we must look again more closely at this ‘programme’ so that we might see how he himself conceived its further elaboration- ‘in so far as it is meaningful’. Perhaps from this point more light can be cast on the intentions lying behind the already completed ‘purely historical investigation’, but also on those that he had from the very beginning. For Weber wrote his ‘ Anticritical Last Word’ in the autumn of 1910, and thus almost exactly at the end of what Tenbruck and Küenzlen have called the ‘dark years’;77 he also wrote at a time which coincides\n\nMax Weber’s ‘Central Question’\n\n41\n\nwith the beginning of the work on WEWR. In one of the skirmishes in the debate with Rachfahl that is hidden in a footnote, Weber bragged about his knowledge of Dutch culture at Rachfahl’s expense, relevant here because of the‘wider concept of “culture” that was at stake’-that is, its constitution in terms of‘typical problems of Lebensjuhrung’. Anyone who has worked on this [‘the typical problems of LebensJuhrung', W. H.] can see that he knows nothing about it, for the most part has no idea of the literary character of the printed literature, not even the tiny fragment which I cite in my criticised essay’. To proceed, and I emphasize, as written in 1910: ‘For my part I have not given up hope of being able to pursue this section [i.e. the influence of religious factors on Lebensjuhrung, W. H.] of my work (and hence to further elaborate it), but this will certainly require another visit to America. ’78 We know how we should treat Weber’s announcement: for the journey was not to America, but first to China, then to India, then back to ancie"
