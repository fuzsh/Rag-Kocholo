It discusses studies on the impact of statistics and historical economics on empirical social research and the emergence of sociology, and the influence of the ‘Historical School’ on American academic disciplines and the social question as a methodological and epistemological problem in German social science The chapter also considers relevance of Gustav Schmoller and historical economics to the history of Imperial Germany. An overview of the subsequent chapters is presented. Keywords: Historical School, Imperial Germany, Gustav Schmoller, historical economics, social science\n\nEach man is given a scientific heritage plus a continuing barrage of sensory stimulation; and the considerations which guide him in warping his scientific heritage to fit his continuing sensory promptings are, where rational, pragmatic. (Willard Van Orman Quine1)\n\nPage 1 of 21\n\nIntroduction In 1857 the historian and philosopher Rudolf Haym (1821–1901) remarked that one of the most enlightening processes was to emulate history backwards by pursuing a thing to its origins, thereby historicizing and bringing into motion that which seemed dogmatic, objective, ideal, or fixed.2 As he wrote in the introduction to his owe influential historical critique of Hegelian philosophy, ‘[I]t would seem something grand to me if this pragmatization of thought would be pursued first and with proper seriousness in all fields.’3 Some 150 years on, Haym might have been disappointed with the pace of this enlightening process had he lived to see it: while the critical history of thought flourished in religion and philosophy,4 in the biological and physical sciences it only got going well into the twentieth century;5 in the social sciences, and in particular in economics, it is still in its infancy.6 Despite this lag, a tension between theory, empirical observation, and policy has been ongoing in economics since at least as early (p.2) as Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations (1776). Since then the acceleration of social change has continually raised new problems and political demands, keeping the pendulum of thinking swinging. Assumptions have repeatedly been adjusted, new tools devised, and policy recommendations modified, altering the legal and institutional relationship between states and markets. As with the rise of the New Deal and Keynesian economics during the Great Depression, particularly dramatic modifications of economic policy and theory have come in the wake of economic crisis or rapid structural change.7\n\nPage 2 of 21\n\nIntroduction Before the Great Depression, one of the most important of such swings in thinking took place between roughly 1860 and 1890. These decades witnessed the demise of orthodox classical economics. Rapid urbanization, a second wave of industrialization, and the democratization of European polities gave rise to massive cities, gigantic industrial enterprises, trusts and cartels, large trade union movements, and wider political participation. At the same time, a crisis began in European farming. In liurope and America various ‘social questions’ relating to these developments arose, and the demand for social reform and government involvement in the economy grew. In scholarship, critical historiography, Darwinism, probability theory, positivism, and the empirical methods of the natural sciences gained ground, displacing axiomatic, deterministic, metaphysical, and idealistic systems of thought.8 Core classical economic doctrines were discredited, and alternative forms of economic enquiry arose in response, among them historical, statistical, institutional, and Marxian variants of economics.9 In turn these heterodoxies were countervailed by updated and revised foundational orthodoxy commonly brought under the rubric ‘marginalism’: British neoclassical, Walrasian and Austrian economics.10 Economics became professionalized through standard curricula and teaching, coordinated research, journals, monographs, and professional associations.11 (p. 3) For the history of the social sciences, therefore, the years 1860 to 1890 were of fundamental importance in shaping novel approaches to theory and policy based on a fuller awareness of social complexity, defining the scope of the subject and creating its supporting institutions. But more significant even than this, the limits of state action were tested as never before, and the policies and institutions then created—among them the welfare state—have had an immense and lasting impact on western society. Measured by its influence between German unification and the First World War, one of the most important of the heterodox variants of economics was the socalled ‘Historical School’. Historical economics and closely related approaches such as institutionalism thrived in most European countries, the United States, and Japan until the First World War, In America, Japan, and Germany such movements survived in parallel with neoclassical economics until well into the 1940s, and in some cases even beyond. The broad appeal of this heterodox approach was its strong statistical and empirical-factual emphasis, its focus on organizational processes and institutional structures, and close connection to social reform and progressive movements. In Germany a so-called ‘younger Historical School’ arose and came to prominence at a time of unprecedented demographic expansion, industrialization, and urbanization between roughly 1860 and 1890, and the problems the historical economists addressed related\n\nPage 3 of 21\n\nIntroduction to reducing the tensions and risks accompanying industrialization and urbanization, making a transition from an agrarian to a more interdependent industrial economy, and integrating a growing working class into civil society through social policy.12 As laws, institutions, urban areas, and the workplace were adapted to accommodate these changes, the problems with which historical economists had grappled gradually declined in importance, and with it the ‘School’. But just as it has been true of American social science since 1945, what also sustained the attraction of historical economics was the international prestige of German universities, the many foreign students who studied in them, the progress of German scholarship and research methods, as well as the rapid technological and economic advances in that country between 1870 and 1914. The outbreak of the (p.4) First World War and the resulting isolation and loss of prestige of German scholarship was therefore a further important factor in the demise of historical economics. Gustav Friedrich Schmoller (1838–1917), who was its leading light in Germany, was closely identified with the Hohenzollern state, and this and his cautious historical-statistical empiricism were after 1918 out of fashion, though as Terence Hutchison once noted, the discredit into which his work subsequently fell went further than was deserved.13 It is therefore worthwhile to be reminded of the close intellectual relationship between German and Anglophone social scientists before the First World War, Edmund J. James (1855–1925), president of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, wrote in the 1890s of the great service that Schmoller and his colleagues had rendered the cause of political economy in America: We Americans are under a special obligation to you, not merely for the fact that as a class you have contributed such a large part of what is available to the literature of our subject, but especially for the liberal, indeed, one may say munificent way in which you have placed at our disposal the unparalleled opportunities for instruction offered by your system of universities.14 The British economist Sir William Ashley (1860–1927) would express similar sentiments in the first decade of the twentieth century.15 The Great War would give these men and their compatriots plenty of encouragement to forget.\n\nPage 4 of 21\n\nIntroduction Following Germany’s defeat and throughout the inter-war period to the Second World War, the origins, development, and international impact of historical economics were obscured, something encouraged by the need to apportion blame for the war, defeat, and financial mismanagement that accompanied and followed it. As time went on, the failings of Weimar economic policy and the rise of Nazism also needed explaining. The ‘Historical School’, and particularly its most prominent members, became convenient scapegoats for a wide range of problems: the perpetuation of the authoritarian imperial German state; the rise of protectionism and state intervention; the inflation and monetary problems of the war and the early Weimar Republic; the rise of cartels and trusts; the growth of socialism; the rise of Nazism; the alleged failure of German theoretical economics; and (p.5) the rise of historical fatalism and determinism in law and economics.16 Schmoller, allegedly controlling most of the players on the academic stage, was blamed for getting German economics on a dead-end track that neglected abstraction and theory, A few notable exceptions to the dismissive and condemnatory tenor of the scholarship of the inter-war period were Joseph Schumpeter’s (1883–1950) article on Schmoller, in which Schmoller’s importance was gauged to be comparable to Alfred Marshall’s (1842–1924), Wilhelm Stieda’s (1852–1933) recollections of Schmoller at the University of Strasbourg, and Albion Small’s (1854–1926) history of sociology, which underscored the importance of German historical economics in the development of American social science.17 Shortly before and during the Second World War a number of reassessments were undertaken which, while illuminating important aspects of Schmoller’s work and the development and contribution of historical economics, nevertheless remained either incomplete, inaccurate, or uncritical, and many were to varying degrees coloured by political opportunism.18 Some notable exceptions were the valuable history of the Verein für Sozialpolitik (Association for Social Policy) by Franz Boese, publication of some early correspondences of Schmoller by Wilhelm Biermann, and the partial publication of the correspondences of Lujo Brentano (p.6) (1844–1931) and Gustav Schraoller by Walter Goetz.19 After the war, relatively little was written about Schmoller or the ‘Historical School’. Indeed, by the early 1960s neglect of this tradition of thought had gone far enough for Schmoller to be dismissively declared a ‘dead dog’.20 Nevertheless the role of historicism in German economies was studied, and minor works on the labour question in the early work of Schmoller and on the ‘youngest Historical School’ that succeeded him were writte.21\n\nPage 5 of 21\n\nIntroduction In the mid-1960s to the early 1970s novel scholarship emerged that analysed the impact of statistics and historical economics on empirical social research and the emergence of sociology.22 Others focused on the influence of the ‘Historical School’ on American academic disciplines and the social question as a methodological and epistemological problem in German social science.23 The epistemological differences at the root of the dispute over methods (Methodenstreit) between Schmoller and the Austrian economist Carl Menger (1840–1920) were also incisively investigated, and short but valuable sketches of Schmoller’s involvement in social reform and contributions as a historian were written.24 Easily the two most (p.7) important archivally-based studies relating to historical economics that emerged in those years were James Sheehan’s biography of Lujo Brentano and Dieter Lindenlaub’s history of the disputes within the Verein fur Sozialpolitik during the Wilhelmine period.25 Others assessed the social question within the ‘Historical School’, largely reaffirming an older narrative of it as a typically German phenomenon growing out of philosophical idealism.26 With reference to historical research on Schmoller and the so-called ‘younger Historical School’, progress has been made since the early 1980s through a number of valuable archivally-based studies, among them a dissertation on the intellectual influences on Schmoller,27’’ a critique of the notion of an ‘older Historical School’,28 and articles exploring the relationship between Schmoller and the sociologists Max Weber (1864–1920) and Georg Simmel (1858–1918).29 Schmoller’s contribution to coordinated historical research in Prussia has also been very fruitfully investigated.30 In closely related areas, Keith Tribe has underscored the importance of cameralism to the development of German economics, and other contributions have been made to the history of the institutionalization of Staatswissenschaften (state or political sciences, including economics) in Germany.31 Theodore Porter’s examination of early statistical thought and David Lindenfeld’s illuminating history of Staatswissenschaften in the nineteenth (p.8) century represent particularly important contributions to this scholarship.32 A survey of the impact of various socio-economic and political developments on the research of the Verein fur Sozialpolitik has also advanced scholarship on the development of German empirical social research,33 while a number of other works have substantially deepened and extended knowledge of Wilhelmine and Weimar economics and sociology, of which Friedrich Lenger’s biography of Werner Sombart (1863–1941) stands out.34 Writings on the intellectual origins of Austrian economics have revealed that the relationship between Austrian and German economics was much closer than was previously thought,35 and works on English and European historical economics, American Institutionalism and Progressivism, and Japanese social science have shown that historical economics was a phenomenon that hardly remained isolated to Germany.36\n\nPage 6 of 21\n\nIntroduction Research on Gustav Schmoller as an economist with contemporary relevance has seen since the late 1980s something of a renaissance, especially as a consequence of conferences and tributes marking his 150th birthday in 1988, resulting in a number of books and articles.37 Since then an increased (p.9) interest among economists in institutional, evolutionary, and ethical approaches to economics has generated a steadily growing body of literature on the ‘Historical School’.38 A conclusion underscored by much of this literature is nevertheless that there is still a major gap in the history of the development of German economics from the founding of the Empire up to the Weimar period, especially the impact of Schmoller and other historical economists on the institutionalization and professionalization of their discipline in Germany.39 The methodological and practical relationship between historical economics and social reform in Bismarckian Germany has also not yet been adequately studied,40 and the inherent problems of interpreting Schmoller’s policy proposals from a limited base of sources and a shallow historical context have been noted.41 Because Gustav Schmoller and the ‘younger Historical School’ were tackling problems that were never only economic but also social and political, Schmoller and historical economics also have a considerable broader (p.10) relevance to the history of Imperial Germany. In 1984 Geoff Eley pointed out that ‘the area of social policy in the broadest sense’ poses ‘a problem of rather surprising neglect amongst German historians’, a finding reiterated more recently by Lothar Machtan, who claims that it is in fact an example of a conspicuous lapse by the historical profession.42 This is confirmed surveying the use of the term ‘social reform’, which has been reduced in German historiography to an ideological term devoid of much substantive historical content.43 It is revealing, for example, that the terms ‘social reform’ and ‘social policy’ never found their way into the most important German historical reference work, and ‘socialism of the chair’ (Katheder-sozialismus) was treated only cursorily under the rubric ‘socialism’.44 This is partly explained by the ideological and political nature of history in Germany, which has produced a divide between the historians of the working-class movement and those of bourgeois society.45’ An example of this is Hans-Ulrich Wehler’s third volume of his massive Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte covering the period 1849–1914, in which social reform is only treated briefly under ‘state social policy’ and ‘social imperialism’, both of which are quickly skimmed in 14 and 11 pages, respectively, in a volume of more than 1,500 pages; the term ‘social reform’ did not even find its way into the index.46 Yet as Thomas Nipperdey wrote shortly before his death, social reform was one of the main political themes preoccupying the German middle classes before 1914.47\n\nPage 7 of 21\n\nIntroduction Where social reform has been studied, the Bismarckian period has been investigated, if at all, only superficially,48 with scholarship heavily focused on the Wilhelmine era, where important contributions have certainly been (p.11) made.49 Some exceptions to the neglect of the Bismarckian era are Heinrich Volkmann’s valuable study of the labour question in Prussia between 1848 and 1869, and two contributions to a 1985 volume on German social reform,, which while not breaking new ground or making use of unpublished materials, nevertheless provided a sound basis for further study.50 More recently Geoff Eley has noted that archivally-based social history is conspicuously lacking for the Bismarckian period, or that it has been too dominated by autonomous socioeconomic forces or the Iron Chancellor as arch-manipulator.51 This is in some measure the product of the hegemony of Hans Rothfels’s dubious interpretation of the origins of German social insurance in Bismarck’s time.52 Yet since the late 1970s a steady body of literature has come to question aspects of this interpretation,53 Moreover, in recent years the historiography of German social policy has seen the publication of key primary sources for the Bismarckian era, calling into question the received wisdom on the rise of the welfare state and greatly aiding research on this period.54 Likewise, sociological reinterpretations (p.12) of the origins and motivations of German social policy have seriously questioned prevailing assumptions about the role of the Prussian state and bureaucracy in the German welfare state.55 A recurring problem scholars have pointed to is that Scbmoller’s thought has so far only been treated in isolated compartments, and consequently\n\nPage 8 of 21\n\nIntroduction sight has been lost of the important common themes tying this work together; Schmoller was responding in his writings to rapid processes of social and economic change, and almost all of his thought was based upon or contained a vision of social progress.56 Schmoller literally spoke and wrote volumes about the economic, political, and social affairs of Imperial Germany and sought throughout his life to influence events. Far from being isolated in an ivory tower, Schmoller kept his finger on his nation’s pulse. His continual public evaluations and comments made him very much a public figure enmeshed in controversies until he died in 1917. He was therefore never only an economist and social reformer but, as Friedrich Meinecke once noted, also a figure whose life and work closely reflected the history of the Empire,57 The Verein für Sozialpolitik that he and his colleagues founded was the most important private fact-finding body within the Empire, often making up for the Reichstag’s own investigative deficiencies. Schmoller and his colleagues played an important role in bringing to light social injustice, popularizing social reform, and in developing the notion of the progressive social regulation of the economy and the formation of a classless Mittelstandsgesellschaft (society of the middle estate). These activities were pivotal in defining for the German Bürgertum the political, legal, and institutional responses to the rise of an urban and industrial society. The ideas, language, and institutions that emerged in this response, such as the idea of the Mittelstand, are, along with nationalism, among the most potent political and social ideals in modern German history, of direct relevance to contemporary Germany. Schmoller, his colleagues, and their social reform movement thus have a direct bearing not only on the history of economic thought, but also on the development of (p.13) German liberalism and the much-debated Sondermeg thesis, the notion that Germany’s path of historical development in the nineteenth century deviated sharply from that of its western neighbours. It was not coincidental that the valuable biographical study of Lujo Brentano’s career written by James Sheehan in the 1960s, which filled in some of the gaps of Brentano’s own autobiography, later blossomed into one of the most important studies of German liberalism.58 Yet as many have pointed out, there is still a conspicuous gap in the literature assessing the role of Gustav Schmoller as one of the most important scholars and public figures in Imperial Germany.59\n\nPage 9 of 21\n\nIntroduction The fact that historical economics, the German social reform movement, and Gustav Schmoller himself all represent conspicuous gaps in scholarship make an archivally-based study of the links between historical economics and social reform in the imperial era and Schmoller’s role in this timely, desirable, and necessary. Filling a space so large is obviously beyond the scope of this book. It will therefore restrict itself to the activities of Schmoller and his closest colleagues Lujo Brentano, Adolf Held, and Georg Friedrich Knapp over the thirty years from the first war of German unification in 1864 to Caprivi’s resignation and the end of the ‘New Course’ in 1894. These years are chosen because they represent the period about which the least is known and because it was in these years that the historical economists began their careers, first engaged with the problems of their day, and enjoyed the zenith of their influence as academics and social reformers. As suggested, social reform and historical economics were closely related and complimentary phenomena difficult to understand in isolation yet holding the promise of being vividly illuminated when explored in conjunction. While many aspects of this book touch on the history and philosophy of economic thought, it is important to state clearly that this is very much a work of social history, seeking as it does to reconstruct an era of thought and policy, not from the categories, concepts, and theoretical constructs of the history of ideas, but as much as possible from published and unpublished primary sources linked to the individuals and institutions that are the subjects of this book. Ultimately this means asserting the priority (although not primacy) of what can be established through such sources over concepts and theory. Giving priority to the sources hardly means that this investigation (p.14) starts without assumptions. It begins from, the premiss that the production of knowledge is a social process continually shaped by the problems it engages; the culture and institutions within which problems are defined and the production of knowledge takes place thus take on central importance in this investigation. For the purposes of this study, economic and social ideas are assumed to be tools with which people try to solve problems through policy. Both the culture and institutions of the production of knowledge and the context of problems shape and constrain the methods employed to generate knowledge for policy. As such, emphasis will be placed on the historical reconstruction of the set of problems historical economists engaged and how they responded.\n\nPage 10 of 21\n\nIntroduction This investigation assumes that policy relevance is a good measure of the value of economic and social thought. Since it follows from this assumption that economics should be seen as a normative policy science with an inherently public dimension, such an approach serves to encourage an informed evaluation of both past and present social and economic thinking, thereby facilitating not only a critical awareness of the obvious differences, but also an appreciation of the continuity of some of this thinking, its relevant set of problems, and their broader implications. Central to this study is the question of how it was that Schmoller and his colleagues responded to the social tensions in PrussiaGermany and what the implications of this response were. It is hoped that this will shed needed light on an important but neglected era, the development of an influential strand of modern economic and social thought, as well as the origins of the German social reform, movement. If successful, a much clearer picture should also emerge of German society in the 1860s and first two decades of the Second Empire. The book is broken down into three parts and seven chapters whose sequence and structure closely reflect the premisses just outlined. Part I (Structures) critically investigates the various perceptions and interpretations of German historical economics and the actual institutional structures that sustained it. Chapter 1 is a critical reassessment of the ‘German Historical School’, testing the validity of this rubric in the history of economic thought by evaluating how it has been used and abused over time, what it has come to mean, and some of the problems this raises. Chapter 2 is an empirical reconstruction of German economics as a university discipline during the era in question and the place in this of the historical economists. It investigates the university and non-university institutions, academic culture, professional bodies, publishers, monographs, and journals that enabled their scholarly output. It also evaluates the influence of (p.15) Schmoller and his colleagues on this mode of production and the dynamics of Its change over time. These two chapters lay an indispensable critical and empirical foundation for the rest of the book, yet the more general reader can proceed directly to Part II without loss of coherence. Part II (Context, Ideas, and Methods) is devoted to the links between ethics, empirical-historical methods, statistics, and social reform, focusing on the alternative insights and tools these provided both economics and the social reform movement. Chapter 3 defines and traces the social question and its salient attributes for Schmoller and his colleagues by relating it to the rapid processes of social and economic change in Prussia during the 1860s and 1870s, It also traces the rise and spread of contemporaneous social thought and the simultaneous demise of classical economics between roughly 1850 and 1870. Following this, Chapter 4 evaluates the closely related ascent of a new historicalstatistical empiricism and social reform. It explores the strong links between empiricism, statistics, and historical scholarship in historical economics within the context of the labour question and German unification. Page 11 of 21\n\nIntroduction Part III (Policy) investigates the interaction between Schmoller and his colleagues and the public, as well as the involvement of historical economists in policy. It investigates how historical economists and their variety of social reform were received, what challenges and problems they faced, and how they responded. Chapter 5 evaluates their involvement in the rise of an organized social reform, movement by analysing the dynamics that gave rise to the Verein für Sozialpolitik, what the place of the historical economists was in this organization, what disputes and controversies this sparked, and how Schmoller and his colleagues in turn responded to these challenges. Chapter 6 addresses the historical economists’ reaction to and impact upon social and economic policy by evaluating their role in the social insurance legislation of the 1880s, as well as in agricultural and industrial policy up to the mid-1890s. Chapter 7 investigates how the historical economists’ commitment to social reform led to the famous Methodenstreit (dispute over methods) between Schmoller and the Austrian economist Carl Menger. It traces and evaluates their relationship from the early 1870s, placing this dispute within the context of academic professionalization and the rise of social reform in Austria between roughly 1870 and 1894. The arguments and evidence presented in this book represent a necessary corrective to a number of persistent misconceptions about the historical economics of Gustav Schmoller and his colleagues. It contends that, viewed in its context, historical economics represented a subtle, timely, and (p.16) effective empirical alternative to classical economics, Schmoller and his colleagues were guided by a critical epistemology that was coherent, sophisticated, and informed of the latest developments in other scientific disciplines and philosophy. They were at the vanguard of a new awareness of social complexity and of the need to investigate this complexity empirically. By setting an empirical standard for the truth claims of deductive propositions, they helped to establish a fruitful and enduring tension between theory and factual evidence.\n\nPage 12 of 21\n\nIntroduction As importantly, Schmoller and his colleagues sought to consciously and deliberately shape their world by means of a social ethic to achieve a more egalitarian society. They took a position, had a vision, and successfully worked to put it into practice. Theirs was an alternative with explicit and direct policy relevance driven by an awareness of the unavoidable ethical dimension of economic and social questions. The historical economist’s empirical and problem-oriented approach bore fruit not only as social policy addressing specific social questions but also generated a large body of social knowledge and an enduring set of questions that incisively grappled with the fundamental structures, processes, and dilemmas of an evolving, complex division of labour and its supporting institutions. In doing so, theoretical insights into social and economic processes were generated which were far ahead of their time, ones which, while not always acknowledged, were later heavily borrowed and to prove remarkably fertile for the development of economics and sociology in the twentieth century. Schmoller and his colleagues thereby contributed fundamentally to what has proven to be an enduring understanding of the relationship between economy and society in the West.

Keywords: Historical School, economic thought, critical assessment\n\nIt would be difficult to overrate the importance of the work that has been done by the great leaders of this [modern ‘real’ or historical] school [of economists] in tracing the history of economic habits and institutions. It is one of the chief achievements of our age, and is an addition of the highest value to the wealth of the world. It has done more than almost anything else to broaden our ideas, to increase our knowledge of ourselves, and to help us to understand the central plan, as it were, of the divine government of the world. (Alfred Marshall2)\n\nPage 1 of 20\n\nWhat was the Historical School? A Critical Reassessment 1 The history of economic thought is strewn with landmarks of various schools of economics. Some are credited as important milestones, others appear only as obstacles that had to be overcome. The geology of this landscape has continually shifted over time, raising some features and burying others. One of the older and familiar obstructing landmarks in this landscape is the German Historical School of Economics, and yet for various reasons it remains something of an enigma. In the interest of clarity, it is necessary to test the validity of this term by critically investigating the scope of meaning of’the Historical School’ as it has been used in the economic literature, by historical economists themselves, as well as by their scholarly contemporaries, critics, and the public. This done, it may be possible to come to some kind of judgement regarding this rubric’s analytical usefulness and, if needed, to propose a working definition. Surveying some of the older and more recent literature reveals at least four related ways that the term, ‘Historical School’ has been put to use. Most familiar will be its ordering function: introducing various approaches and methodologies in roughly chronological order under the rubric (p.20) ‘school’, thereby also arranging economic ideas into a tidy narrative. In such accounts the ‘Historical School’ is described as a somewhat amorphous, largely contrarian tradition of thought—a transitionary hiccup in the progression of economic theory.3 Closely related to this ordering function is the use of ‘Historical School’ in grouping together into uniformity what would otherwise be an unwieldy clutter of heterodox opinions and methods. There is a long history of such conglomerations being divided into national camps (i.e. German versus British, and later Austrian ‘schools’ of economics), implying that there was something akin to national consensus on such matters, national rivalries thereby gaining an economic microcosm.4 Invariably, many such accounts tend to stress German peculiarity, emphasizing romantic, nationalist, and Hegelian idealist antecedents.5\n\nPage 2 of 20\n\nWhat was the Historical School? A Critical Reassessment 1 Another, sometimes concurrent, use of the term. ‘Historical School’ has been to describe a positivist Zeitgeist, strongly implying progress. Typical in this regard would be Ingram’s History of Political Economy or Gide and Eist’s History of Economic Doctrines in which the ‘Historical School’ is seen as a broad reforming movement that swept through much of Europe, introducing a new undogmatic, realistic, and empirical ethos to economics.6 Other uses of the term have served as ways of discrediting some and legitimating other economic approaches and methods. For example, Gustav Schraoller was himself prone to caricature analytical-deductive economists as the ‘Manchester School’—a selfish political doctrine masquerading as economic science—while virtuously labelling the ‘Historical (p.21) School’ ‘realistic research’ and ‘scientific economics’.7 In Carl Menger’s account, by contrast, the ‘German Historical School of Economics’ was an amorphous object of derision, which at times included the whole German economics profession, at others merely a group of ‘historians’.8 The ‘Historical School’ he accused of ‘one-sidedness’ and a litany of methodological ‘errors’, while he claimed his own approach was ‘exact’.9 Inasmuch as such usages are still employed—loaded as they are with varying images and associations, both historical and contemporary—the ‘Historical School’, whatever it was, seems real enough, and attempts to dismiss it would appear to be both fruitless and unnecessary. After all, numerous economists themselves made references to or claims of belonging to such a school. The ‘Historical School’ is therefore a landmark which, while somewhat submerged by the shifting sands of time, nonetheless appears familiar. Yet, what justifies the collective rubric ‘school’? The term ‘school’, to be of any use, might refer to a category that (rightly or wrongly) was used with some consistency and precision to describe the group of people in question. It might also refer to a group that shared a method, principles, or closely collaborated in research. The term ‘school’ could in addition refer to a group that was taught by or were followers of one person. More broadly, ‘German Historical School’ can be used as a term emphasizing the adjective ‘German’ and thereby an intellectual Sonderweg of Romanticism, idealism, Hegelianism, and historicism in economics. As it turns out, there is scant evidence to justify any of these deinitions and uses. These points will be examined one at a time.\n\nPage 3 of 20\n\nWhat was the Historical School? A Critical Reassessment 1 In a 1926 article, Joseph Schumpeter himself admitted the inappro-priateness of the term ‘younger Historical School’ as he had used it in his Epochen der Dogmen- und Methodengeschichte (1914), but this was never translated into English,10 and his chapter ‘Sozialpolitik and the Historical Method’ in his posthumously published and extremely influential History of Economic Analysis remained unfinished when he died. There is little question that this helped to standardize an uncritical use of the term ‘Historical School’, and it should not come as too much of a surprise that the German and Austrian economists Schumpeter referred to as making up the ‘Historical School’ form a highly heterogeneous group: Wilhelm (p.22) Roscher (1817–1894), Bruno Hildebrand (1812–1878), Karl Keies (1821–1898), August Meitzen (1822–1910), Georg Hanssen (1809–1894), Karl Theodor von Inama–Sternegg (1843–1908), Gustav Schmoller (1838–1917), Lujo Brerttano (1844–1931), Karl Biicher (1847–1930), Adolf Held (1844–1880), Georg Friedrich Knapp (1842–1926), Werner Sombart (1863–1941), Max Weber (1864–1920), and Arthur Spiethoff (1873– 1957),11 This heterogeneity is increased when a few others, who were for some reason omitted or mentioned in a different context by Schumpeter, are added to make a more comprehensive list of ‘historical’ economists: Siegmund Adler (1853– 1920), Gustav Cohn (1840–1919), Karl von Eheberg (1855–1941), Eberhard Gothein (1853–1923), Wilhelm Hasbach (1849–1920), Heinrich Herkner (1863– 1932), Ignaz Jastrow (1856–1937), Wilhelm Lexis (1837–1914), August von Miaskowski (1838–1899), Karl Oldenberg (1864–1936), Eugen von Philippovich (1858–1917), Karl Rathgen (1856–1921), August Sartorius von Waltershausen (1852–1938), Georg von Schanz (1853–1931), Gustav von Scbönberg (1839ö1908), Max. Sering (1857–1939), Gerhart von Schulze–Gaevernitz (1864– 1943), Wilhelm Stieda (1852–1933), and Otto von Zwiedineck-Sudenhorst (1871– I957).12 This vagueness of the rubric ‘German Historical School’ has a long histon. Use of this term in newspapers, journals, books, and government reports of the time was (not surprisingly) highh unsystematic. Often the name ‘Historical School’ was used interchangeably with the ‘socialists of the chair’’ (kathedersozialisten) and the Verein für Sozialpoltik. For example, in a famous debate in the Prussian Chamber of Deputies in 1897 the ‘Historical School’ was referred to as both ‘,die Kathedersozialistische Richtung’ (direction of the socialists of the chair) and ‘neuhistorische Sclule’ (neo–Historical School).13 Newspaper articles commemorating Schmoller’s 70th birthday variously refer to the ‘Hlistorical School’ as ‘die historiche Schule der Nationalökonomie’ (the Historical School of Economics), ‘geschichtkicheMethode der Nationalökonomie’ Historical Method of Economics), and’neupreiBische Nationalökonomie’ (Nco-Prussian Economics).14 Other contemporaries wrote of a ‘real-historischen Richtung’ (p. 23) (real–historical direction) when referring to the social reformers who founded the Verein für Sozizlpolitik.15\n\nPage 4 of 20\n\nWhat was the Historical School? A Critical Reassessment 1 While ‘kathedersozialist’ and ‘neuhistorische Schule’ were to some extent oxerlapping terms, they were by no means interchangeable. The term kathedersozialist’ was itself a journalistic term of derision originating in a polemical exchange between leading figures of theFreihändlerpartei (Free Trade Party) such as Heinrich liernhard Oppenheim (1819–1880) and Viktor Böhmert (1829–1918) and the young economists Brcntano, Cohn, Schmoller, Schönberg, and Adolph Wagner (1835–1917) who came to be called ‘kathedersozialist’ after publicly criticizing the views of the libcrally inclined Volkswirtschaflicher Kongress (Economic Congress).16 These differcnces were heightened by the decision of Schmoller and his colleagues to found the rival Verein für Sozialpolitik in 1873, with which the Kathedersozilisten thereafter became identified. Yet as the names Eugen von Böhm–Bawerk (1851–1914), Johannes Conrad (1839–1915), Karl Diehl (1864–1943), Erwin Nasse (1829–1890), Joseph Schumpeter, Adolph Wagner, and Friedrich von Wieser (1851–1926) confirm, many leading figures in the Verein were not historical economists. And a number of historical economists (Adler, Herkner, Inama–Sternegg, Philippovich, Stieda, and Zwiedineck–Südenhorst) were not from Germany.\n\nPage 5 of 20\n\nWhat was the Historical School? A Critical Reassessment 1 Some of the confusion arising with the use of the term ‘German Historical School’ must be blamed on Wilhelm Roscher’s idiosyncratic History of Economics in Germany (1874).17 In a chapter outlining recent developments in German economics, Roscher referred to these collectively as a ‘realistische Richtung’ (realistic direction or tendency). At the same time, however, the term Schule (school) featured on Roscher’s page headings.18 Yet even before the publication of Roscher’s book, Schmoller and other historical economists made broad and varying usage of the term, ‘school’. In an important 1873 speech, for example, Gustav Schönberg juxtaposed the ‘Manchester School’ to the ‘historical–ethical direction winning victory in German universities’.19 At the Eisenach congress of (p.24) 1872, which led to the founding of the Verein fiir Sozialpolitik, Schmollermentioned the existence of’ abweichende Richtungen’ (divergent directions) in German economics, namely historical, philosophical, and statistical ‘schools’ without going into any detail as to the membership of these.20 Later sources only increase the confusion: in an 1897 letter to Friedrich Althoff (1839–1908, then director of Prussian university affairs) in response to newspaper accusations of bias towards the t Kathedersozialistische Richtung’ in university appointments within the Prussian Ministry of Culture,21 Schmoller made a list of those academic economists whom he considered belonging to his ‘school’, which few today would recognize.22 This is because when Schmoller referred to his ‘school’ he meant those whom he had taught. Other German economists of the time made fast and loose use of the term ‘school’. For example, G. F. Knapp together with Werner Wittich (1867– 1937) and others supposedly formed the ‘Strasbourg School’ of historical economics, and Johannes Conrad himself wrote of a ‘Brentano School’.23 On the other hand, Wilhelm Lexis spoke of the ‘realistic German School’ when collectively referring to the followers of Gustav Schmoller and Adolph Wagner.24\n\nPage 6 of 20\n\nWhat was the Historical School? A Critical Reassessment 1 Even assuming the validity of Schumpeter’s delnition of the ‘German Historical School’, attempting to find a common set of themes, commitments, or programme of the ‘School’ is highly frustrating.25 One of the few common themes uniting the alleged ‘School’ was research in economic history, but this alone was hardly a sufficient basis for scholarly unity. While the interest in economic history was strong in Germany, it was nothing particularly novel.26 After all, an interest in economic history was especially solid in Britain, and it is revealing that Wilhelm Roscher himself considered the work of Adam Smith (1723–1790), James Steuart (1712– 1780), and Thomas Malthus (1766–1834) (together with Karl Heinrich Rau [1792–1870] and Christian Kraus [1753–1807]) to have been the most significant impulses for the development of a historical method in (p.25) economics,27 Similarly, Adolf Held considered Adam, Smith ‘the excellent paragon’ of the ‘so–called historical school’,28 It is revealing that when Francis Y. Edgeworth (1845–1926) wrote Schmoller in 1890 asking for an article on ‘the progress which the historical method has recently made in Germany’ for the new Economic Journal, instead of taking the opportunity to wave the banner of his alleged ‘school’, Schmoller deferred to his student Wilhelm Hasbach, who wrote an article on the great diversity of descriptive and historical monographic research in Germany and the coordinated activity contributing to Johannes Conrad’s Handworterbuch der Staats-wissenschaften,29 That the political and especially historical components were so prominent within German economics at this time was related to the fact that one of the most important issues of economic policy in Imperial Germany, social reform, demanded historical, political, and ethical justifications. Social reform was, after all, not only a matter of party politics but also a process of nation–building, of finding historically and culturally legitimated policies. Yet historical economists did not have common political opinions and disagreed widely in their historical interpretations. And economic history was itself used to legitimate a variety of policies: Brentano used it to justify English–inspired cooperatives and trade unions; Schmoller employed it to advocate state-initiated social reform.30\n\nPage 7 of 20\n\nWhat was the Historical School? A Critical Reassessment 1 As it turns out, no single method, research subject, or political orientation united the scholarship of the so-called ‘German Historical School’. Schmoller was a liberal in his early years and later became more conservative. He was empirically oriented and devoted much of his research to Prussian administrative and economic history. Brentano was more open to theory, a lifelong liberal, and wrote widely on trade unionism and the cooperative movement. Knapp, also a liberal, worked on agrarian history as well as in theory, becoming famous for his state theory of money. Biicher, a left-wing liberal, devised a theory of stages of economic development and sided with Menger against Schmoller in the famous dispute over methods, the Methodenstreit. Sombart, on the other hand, had socialist leanings and was sympathetic to Marxist theory. He wrote extensively on the origins of (p.26) capitalism, Adolf Held was a conservatively inclined liberal free–trader who strongly opposed deductive theory and was best known for a pioneering study of the Industrial Revolution in England. Finally, Schanz was a liberal known mainly for his contribution to the history and theory of public finance. With the ‘School’ made up of researchers of such wide–ranging approaches, research interests, and political orientations it should not be surprising that cooperation was not one of their strong suits. Coordinated research, if it did occur at all, took place not in the ‘School’ but instead within the confines of individual professors’ seminars. Indeed, the influence of Schmoller’s seminar on lines of research was particularly strong.31 It is noteworthy that some of Schmoller’s largest coordinated historical research projects, the Acta Borussica and Forschungen zur brandenburgischen und preußischen Geschichte, were founded and managed without other members of the ‘Historical School’.32 In fact, relations between members of the alleged ‘School’ were often aloof and full of rivalry, as the three–year row between Brentano and Schmoller and a lengthy dispute over value freedom in economics revealed.33\n\nPage 8 of 20\n\nWhat was the Historical School? A Critical Reassessment 1 Members of the ‘Historical School’ were also not trained by, or the followers of, one particular person or group. For example, none of those Schumpeter labelled as forming the ‘younger Historical School’ were taught or the followers of either Roscher, Hildebrand, or Knies, who made up the ‘older School’.34 On the other hand, the so-called Austrian ‘marginalists’ Bohm–Bawerk and Wieser, so often contrasted with the ‘Historical School’, were sent to Germany by their teacher Carl Menger to study under all three of these older historical economists. Historical scholarship has shown that neither Roscher, Knies, nor Hildebrand actually established an ‘older Historical School’.35’ Schumpeter himself admitted it was ‘not good practice to speak of an Older Historical School’, since Roscher, Hildebrand, and Knies, ‘do not, in any useful sense, form a group, let alone a school’.36 Knies was predominantly an economic theorist, Roscher essentially a classical economist who amended theory with historical insights, and Hildebrand a historian and statistician who sought a stadial theory of economic development and was an early advocate of social reforms. As Max (p.27) Weber later noted, of the three, really only Hildebrand worked with what could be called a distinctly historical method.37 Members of the supposed ‘younger Historical School’ were in am case olien rather critical of these older ‘founders’. For example, Knapp had a very low opinion ot Roscher, with whom he had taught at Leipzig. He once wrote Schmoller that he found Roscher unsystematic, superficial, and lack ing historical ability.38 He also wrote that he thought it shameful for Germain that volume one of Roscher’s text, thc.System der Volkswirtschaft (1854), had been allowed to go through twenty editions.39 There were great methodological differences between the younger and older historical economists, particularly the differences between Schmoller and Knies on the principle of teleology.40 The only real intellectual link, as will be discussed later, was between Hildebrand and Schmoller, and this one was primarily in statistics and its links to social reform, as well as in organizing the Verein für Sozialpolitik.41 Schmoller himself actually rejected laws of historical development and a unified law of economic phenomena of the kind espoused by Hildebrand, admitting only statistical and economic (i.e. empirical) laws.42 While appreciating their contributions, Schmoller would write of Roscher and the ‘Older Historical School’ that they were too idealistic, universal−historical and speculative, lacked depth, were too rash to generalize, and that many of their conclusions were untenable.43\n\nPage 9 of 20\n\nWhat was the Historical School? A Critical Reassessment 1 There are also problems with the assumption that the ‘School’ had its locus in Berlin. While Schmoller was certainly an influential teacher who had an immense impact in Berlin and Prussia, there was in fact no geographical centre of the ‘School’; unlike the Austrians at the University of Vienna, the ‘Historical School’ was scattered throughout Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Brentano worked in Berlin, Breslau, Strasbourg, Vienna, and Leipzig before settling down in Munich; Schmoller began his career in Halle and then Strasbourg, eventually moving to Berlin; Held taught at Bonn and briefly at Berlin but died two years before Schmoller (p.28) arrived there; Knapp taught at Leipzig and then Strasbourg; Bücher, after teaching in Munich, Dorpat, and Basle spent most of his career in Leipzig, as did Stieda after leaving Rostock; Schanz’s career was spent at Würzburg and Schönberg’s in Freiburg and Tübingen; Philippovich taught in Freiburg and then moved to Vienna, where Inama–Sternegg worked; Weber took over Philippovich’s post in Freiburg but spent most of his career in Heidelberg; Miaskowski’s career was spent at Basle, Breslau, Vienna, and Leipzig; and Sombart, after years at Breslau and the Berlin Handelhochschule, moved to Berlin University the year Schmoller died. Schmoller was not a particularly avid ‘school builder’ narrowly prejudiced towards one methodology or political orientation, as is frequently claimed.44 There is little evidence to suggest that Schmoller, as confidant to Friedrich Althoff, was narrowly prejudiced for historical economists in his suggestions for appointment to Prussian universities. For example, while he severely criticized Ferdinand Toennies’s (1855–1936) methods in a review and disagreed with his politics, this did not hinder Schmoller from later proposing him over the historical economist Schulze–Gaevernitz for appointment to Kiel University.45 It is also worth noting that Schmoller was himself a champion of persecuted academics, such as the physicist Leo Martin Arons (1860–1919), officially harassed because of his Social Democratic politics, and the philosopher and social theorist Georg Simmel, whose career was hindered because of antiSemitism.46 In any case, the Althoff papers show that Johannes Conrad, Adolph Wagner, and Wilhelm Lexis were equally influential confidants of Althoff, and of these only Schmoller and Lexis could be considered ‘historical’ economists.47\n\nPage 10 of 20\n\nWhat was the Historical School? A Critical Reassessment 1 The ‘Historical School’ also lacked an organ. The editors of German economics journals of the time showed a penchant for variety, and while historical investigations were pervasively published in almost all of these journals, so were non–historical, empirical, and theoretical tracts, and those dealing with contemporary economic policy. It is particularly noteworthy that Austrian theorists published extensively in these journals, especially in (p.29) the fahrbücher für Nationalökonomie und Statistikk, two highlights being kev works by Böhm–Bawerk and Carl Menger.48 Historical economists were themselves editors of a number of these journals, and no one journal bad a claim lo being the journal of the ‘School’. Hildebrand founded and edited theJahrbücher für Nationalökonomie und Statistik; Bücher edited the Zeit schrift für die Gesamte Staatswissenschaft; Brentano and then Schmoller edited the Jahrbueh für Gesetzgebung, Verwaltung und Volkswirtschaft Deutschen Reich (after 1913, formally renamed Schmollers Jahrbuch); Georg von Schanz edited Finanzarchiv; Sombart and Weber together with Edgar Jaffè (1866–1921) edited the Archiv für Sozialwissenschaften und Sozialpolitik. Even Schmoller’s Jahrbuch, which is often assumed to have a onesided historical bias, was open to variety and not exclusively oriented towards the scholarly preoccupations of the alleged ‘Historical School’. Schmoller explicitly stated in the editorial preface he did not want the Jahrbuch to become primarily a scholarly economic journal, but one that dealt instead with the ‘greater questions that currently preoccupy public opinion, parliament and the German government’.49 The journal was therefore to coyer subjects and issues of interest to a broader academic as well as non– academic audience. It is in this regard revealing that the Jahrbuch also published theoretical articles by Austrian economists.50 This is not to deny, however, that high theory was less dominant in the German economics profession and underrepresented in its journals before the First World War.51 But this, too, hardly forms a ‘school’.\n\nPage 11 of 20\n\nWhat was the Historical School? A Critical Reassessment 1 More broadly, the ‘German Historical School’ has been cited as evidence of Germany’s intellectual Sonderweg (special historical path) in economics and the other social sciences, according to which romantic, idealist, Hegelian, and nationalist antecedents predominate. The continuity between ‘older’ and ‘younger’ Historical Schools is also often emphasized, stressing the peculiarity of these German intellectual antecedents.52 The uncritical (p.30) reiterations of this supposed German intellectual pedigree began with Roseller’s own history of German economics. In his teleological treatment, the historical ‘direction’ (Richtung) in economics became the historical culmination of Germany’s peculiar intellectual traditions.53 It is interesting that Schmoller, Knapp, and especially Brentano were all critical of Roseher’s history. Knapp had no regard for it, and Schmoller wrote Roscher in a letter with his review of Reseller’s book mentioning a ‘mass of problems’ and ‘differences of opinion’, hoping that his criticisms would not harm their friendship.54 Most tellingly, Brentano wrote Schmoller that Roscher’s history of economics ‘does not describe theories on the basis of the times in which they emerged [and therefore] adhere to the demands of modern scholarship. If anyone, Roscher should be up to those demands.’55 Names like the ‘Historical School’, ‘Historical–Ethical School’, ‘Realistic German School’, ‘Neo–Prussian School’, and other variants served the purpose of exaggerating the differences between German and foreign economics. Foreign (especially British) economics and its adherents in Germany—derisively labelled Manchesterturn—were often caricatured as reductive, dogmatic, speculative, and metaphysical.56 Sometimes ‘historical’ implied nothing more than a vague commitment to history, ethical issues, or policy in economics. More often ‘historical’ expressed a commitment to homespun, historically derived ideas reflecting the peculiarities of German conditions. A good example of such views in Imperial Germany were the many hagiographic tributes to Schmoller in German newspapers, particularly the debt owed to Schmoller by Germany for having made a wider circle aware of and appreciate ‘indigenous economic institutions’ and ‘their historical development’.57 By contrast, the Social Democratic newspaper, the Berlin Vorwärts, assessed Schmoller’s history of Prussian social policy, while not a forgery of the ‘Prussian schnapps’, as an attempt to paste a new label on the bottle, making the ‘bad (p.31) potato spirits’ (Kartoffelfuel) seem like the finest Rüdesheim wine.58 The ‘Historical School’ was also conveniently blamed for various failings or commandeered for causes: conservatives considered the ‘Historical School’ an incestuous clique that was soft on socialism;59 Nazis liked to lay special claim to the distinctively ‘German’ character of the ‘Historical School’, though they were quick to point to its deficiencies, notably that it lacked a racial–organic ideology, and unlike the ‘Austrian School’, did not apply concepts like Volksgeistf;60 liberals blamed the ‘Historical School’ and Marxists for determinism and the decline of classical economic theory in Germany.61\n\nPage 12 of 20\n\nWhat was the Historical School? A Critical Reassessment 1 All such interpretations must be approached critically. Careful investigation reveals that historical positivism, natural scientific methods, the development of modern psychology, the ‘back to Kant’ movement, and the development of statistics were all important impulses for the historical economics of Schmoller and his colleagues.62 Evidence seems to point to an aversion to speculative and idealistic German philosophy and a wholehearted embrace of a critical empiricism. Schmoller himself had little regard for Romanticism, idealism, and speculation in economics, and with reference to Adam Miiller and others wrote: The whole of post–Kantian philosophy (Schleietmacber, Fichte. Schelling, Hegel) rests in contrast to Kant, in following the heuristic principle of teleology and inbelieving this to be the only justified method, and declaring their results to be exact science. In connection with this, the philosophical–political economic theories of Germany took a speculative path that separated it ever more from the rest of legal and economic studies in Gcrmam and abroad. If this div ision was never fully completed, it was bad enough.63 Indeed, the period between the 1850s and 1890s in Germany was one of hostility to Hegelian philosophy, a sceptical receptiveness to positivism, a turn towards Rankean history and the natural sciences, as well as a rebirth of interest in Kant in reconciling empiricism and rationalism.64 Not surprisingly, (p.32) Schmoller, Brentano, and many others identified with the so-called ‘younger Historical School’ were influenced more profoundly by statistical methods than by Romanticism or Hegelian philosophy. For Schmoller and Brentano the statisticians Gustav Rumelin (1815–1888)and Ernst Engel (1821–1896), respectively, were decisive teachers and mentors.65 Bücher, Knapp, Held, Inama–Sternegg, and Lexis, like Hilde– brand and Knies before them, were active in statistical offices, which in Germany were closely linked to the development of both empirical social research and historical economics.66\n\nPage 13 of 20\n\nWhat was the Historical School? A Critical Reassessment 1 Further calling into question the uniquely German and idealistic origins of historical economics, Erich Streissler has pointed out that the development of economics in Germany in the nineteenth century was influenced in large measure by important German classical and ‘proton–neoclassical’ economists who developed marginal valuation, such as F. B. W. Hermann (1795–1868), K. E. Mangoldt (1824–1868), K. H. Rau, and Roseher, who were, incidentally, significant influences not only on Carl Menger and other Austrian economists, but also on Alfred Marshall.67 Both Held and Knapp trained with Hermann in Munich, and Schmoller under Hermann’s student and follower J. A. R. Helferich (1817–1892) in Tubingen.68 Brentano and Knapp later wrote their doctoral theses under Helferich after he moved to Gottingen University.69 The intellectual gulf that supposedly separated German and Austrian economics has therefore been exaggerated, particularly in the case of key German historical economists, and pedagogic links between an ‘older School’ and these prominent younger historical economists simply do not exist.70 Those who would seek to emphasize the peculiar influence of economic nationalism, and specifically Friedrich List (1789–1846), on the ‘Historical School’ must contend with the fact that List’s ideas have their origins in the United States; indeed, List’s economic doctrines were drawn directly from American economic thinkers such as Alexander Hamilton (1755–1804) (p.33) and Daniel Raymond (1786–1849) and from economic policy precedents observed while in America—List became a US citizen in 1825. These would be a major source of inspiration for his National System of Political Economy (1840), which, rather revealingly, grew out of an earlier piece called Outlines of American Political Economy (1827).71 Finally, what of the normative socio-political preoccupations of the ‘Historical School’? Was this distinctive and therefore a basis for a ‘School’, or was German historical economics, as Max Weber’s colleague Robert Wilbrand (1875–1954) once remarked, just ‘historical sauce on a classical dish’?72 There is little doubt that the centrality of the ‘social question’ in German public affairs meant that economics in Germany continued to be political economy encompassing a broad range of social phenomena and political questions. But this too was not particularly novel to the alleged ‘Historical School’. After all, classical, Marxian, and nationalist economics were tied to discrete political programmes—Smith, Ricardo, Marx, and List’s economics were analytical foundations upon which their respective programmes for political change were built.\n\nPage 14 of 20\n\nWhat was the Historical School? A Critical Reassessment 1 A critical historical evaluation of the meaning of the term ‘Historical School’ thus reveals a highly complicated, confusing picture that would suggest the abandonment of the term ‘School’ altogether. At the same time ‘Historical’ refers to so much that it seems in danger of losing all meaning, its various overlapping uses and vague associations spawning more confusion than clarity. This does not deny that the ‘Historical School’, to which some economists felt they belonged, was a claim to intellectual identity commonly made in the era in question. The point is not to dispute this, but instead to show that a vague and overburdened rubric of this kind is of little use to a systematic, critical investigation of the use of history as a tool of economic inquiry and the place of this in the broader context of the rise of social reform in Germany between the 1860s and 1890s. For these reasons this investigation will be referring more appropriately to ‘historical economics’, by which is meant historical-statistical (i.e. empirical or realistic) economics, focusing on the most important of these: Gustav Schmoller and his colleagues Lujo Brentano, Adolf Held and Georg Friedrich Knapp.73 (p.34) As will be shown in the chapters following, these men were a pragmatic, empirically inclined group of statistically trained economists who, having directly observed the effects of rapid urbanization, industrialization, the rise of labour movements and socialism in Germany and abroad in the 1860s, became dissatisfied with orthodox classical economic doctrines, subjecting these to empirical tests and criticism. Historical economists like Schmoller sought a new base of knowledge through empiricism, emphasizing factuality and realism. Using history as a critical and analytical tool and combining it with statistics, they sought practical solutions to economic and social problems and to advance projects of social reform by disseminating social and economic information to their colleagues, the general public, bureaucratic officials, and governments. In order to move beyond the conceptual and analytical confusion of the history of economic thought and to begin to fully understand these historical economists and their relationship to social reform, their mode of scholarly production needs detailed investigation, providing an informed foundation upon which the rest of the book can be based.
