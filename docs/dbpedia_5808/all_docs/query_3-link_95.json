        "text": "HOW ECONOMICS FORGOT HISTORY\n\nEconomics today has been widely criticised as being more concerned with mathematical technique than the understanding and explanation of real world phenomena. However, one hundred years ago, in Europe and America, economics was fused with the study of history and its practitioners emphasised the importance of the understanding of speciﬁc institutions. How Economics Forgot History shows how the German historical school addressed a key problem in social science and concerned themselves with the historical speciﬁc character of economic phenomena and the need to make economic theory more sensitive to the historical and geographical variety of different socioeconomic systems. Examining the nature and evolution of the problem of historical speciﬁcity, it shows how this issue was tackled by Karl Marx, Gustav Schmoller, Carl Menger, Werner Sombart, Max Weber, Alfred Marshall, John Rogers Commons and Frank Knight. It is also argued that alongside Lionel Robbins, leading ﬁgures such as John Maynard Keynes, Joseph Schumpeter and Talcott Parsons also helped to divert the social sciences away from this problem. Geoffrey M. Hodgson concludes with some suggestions as to how modern economics can once again begin to take this problem on board, and become more sensitive to the great structural and institutional changes in history, as well as those we have witnessed in recent decades. He argues that disciplinary boundaries have to be re-evaluated, in an effort to re-introduce an adequate historical vision to the social sciences. Geoffrey M. Hodgson is a Research Professor in Business Studies at the University of Hertfordshire. He has published widely in the academic journals and his previous books include Economics and Utopia (Routledge, 1999).\n\n© 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\nThis is a splendid piece of intellectual history. Hodgson breathes new life into past ideas and the issues surrounding them. These revived ideas are terribly important for the current generation of economists, both mainstream and heterodox. It is the first book I have seen that gets the complex story of historismus into a proper intellectual context. A major contribution is the demonstration that the victory of the Austrians in the Methodenstreit was apparent only and how the problem of historical speciﬁcity continues to haunt the literature of economics. Paul Dale Bush California State University at Fresno, USA With How Economics Forgot History Geoff Hodgson has gone considerable distance toward closing an important gap in methodological thinking about economics: how to explain the concrete, historically speciﬁc dimensions of economic life. Many have criticized the flaws of general theorizing. Many have called for a more historically speciﬁc economics. But Hodgson delivers a well thought-out account of how to go forward that recommends judicious recourse to universal concepts with ideas from evolutionary and complexity theory. Building on a careful examination of the German historical school and American institutionalism, Hodgson produces an original contribution that will be important to progress in thinking about economics as a social science. John B. Davis Marquette University, USA In this outstanding, thought-provoking and lucidly written book, Geoffrey Hodgson explores the important relationship between economic theory and history, challenging the universalistic doctrine of neoclassical economics. He succeeds impressively in developing a meta-theoretic platform that integrates general principles with historical speciﬁcities as they result from particular spatio-temporal contexts. The book provides effective guidance for economists who are prepared to rethink theory formation in a novel way. Kurt Dopfer University of St Gallen, Switzerland Professor Hodgson is showing the way towards something that has scarcely existed since Marx: a historical economics that reaches beyond mere economic history. John Maloney University of Exeter, UK Hodgson’s erudition is deeply impressive. Overall, he must know more than anyone in the world about the roots of historical and institutional economics. In this volume the importance of thinking about institutions comes across extremely clearly, as does the contribution of the old institutional economics to this endeavour. This book clears the ground for a new, constructive approach to economics that can contribute to a deeper understanding of the world in which we live. Paul Ormerod Volterra Ltd, UK\n\n© 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\nThis is a book that needed to be written, and Hodgson has done a ﬁne job in ensuring that it will be read. It is an intriguing and fascinating account of the rise and fall of a fundamental question in economics, that of the role and nature of historical speciﬁcity. I learnt a great deal about the historically dependent nature of economic theory from this comprehensive and thoroughly researched account of the characters and context of those who made it. Were Umberto Eco to turn to economics, he might write something like this. A fascinating narrative of deception, lost trails, personal intrigue, serendipity and turpitude with a dash of world war and shifting power relations. And, in the ﬁnal analysis, it is a moral story. Economics cannot have universality without history, nor history without universality. They must learn to co-exist. Hodgson has explained this beautifully. Jason Potts University of Brisbane, Australia Economics has two modes of thought and analysis. In one, the economy is examined as a pure, abstract, a-institutional, transcendent system. In the other, the economy is examined in terms of institutions which have history. In his newest book, Geoff Hodgson explores the history, content and conceptual problems of the latter approach. It is a brilliant presentation and interpretation of very important materials.

Hodgson\n\nECONOMICS AS SOCIAL THEORY Series edited by Tony Lawson University of Cambridge Social Theory is experiencing something of a revival within economics. Critical analyses of the particular nature of the subject matter of social studies and of the types of method, categories and modes of explanation that can legitimately be endorsed for the scientiﬁc study of social objects, are re-emerging. Economists are again addressing such issues as the relationship between agency and structure, between economy and the rest of society, and between the enquirer and the object of enquiry. There is a renewed interest in elaborating basic categories such as causation, competition, culture, discrimination, evolution, money, need, order, organization, power probability, process, rationality, technology, time, truth, uncertainty, value etc. The objective for this series is to facilitate this revival further. In contemporary economics the label ‘theory’ has been appropriated by a group that conﬁnes itself to largely asocial, ahistorical, mathematical ‘modelling’. Economics as Social Theory thus reclaims the ‘Theory’ label, offering a platform for alternative rigorous, but broader and more critical conceptions of theorizing.

Hodgson\n\nPREFACE\n\nThis book has had a very long inception. It concerns a central problem in social science and some steps towards its resolution. I have believed for over thirty years that the problem of historical speciﬁcity was one of the key questions in the social sciences. This problem starts from the presumption that different socioeconomic phenomena may require theories that are in some respects different from each other. Essential variation among objects of enquiry may impose limits on successful explanatory unification. An adequate theory of (say) the feudal system may differ from an adequate theory of (say) capitalism. Any common aspects of these theories will reﬂect common features of the real systems involved. Nevertheless, differences between different systems could be so important that the theories and concepts used to analyse them must also be substantially different, even if they share some common precepts. A fundamentally different reality may require a different theory. This, in rough outline, is the problem of historical speciﬁcity. Karl Marx made this argument in the 1840s and it was the starting point of his own economic theory. Although my own ﬂirtation with Marxism was relatively brief, and I became a resolute critic of several of his ideas, I remained convinced of the importance of this insight. In particular, for a long time I have also thought that the recklessly over-general postulates of mainstream economics have weakened, rather than strengthened it as a theoretical system. Universal theories are based on the maxim: ‘one theory ﬁts all’. Universal theories can have limitations in dealing with speciﬁc, concrete phenomena. As in the case of much mainstream economics, they can be insufﬁciently sensitive to historical and geographic variations. In the 1980s I became more familiar with the works of the German historical school. For well over a hundred years, they too had tackled and debated this problem. Furthermore, I realised that Carl Menger’s famous attack on the German historical school in the 1880s had not been successful in brushing the problem of historical speciﬁcity aside. Moreover, the inﬂuence of the German historical school had been so wide that leading British economists, including Alfred Marshall, had taken much of their argument on board. In addition, similar concerns had inspired the emerging American institutional economists in the early part of the twentieth century. I discovered that there was a Lost Continent of theoretical, methodological and empirical studies in economics, largely hidden under the twentieth-century © 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\nrubble of fascism and war. It contained important thinkers who should in justice rank among the most important social scientists of the twentieth century. Yet they have no memorials in the technocratic domain of modern mainstream economics. Few from the Lost Continent have escaped this oblivion. Many are absent from the classrooms and the textbooks of modern, global academia. Today, many pay due credit to a few German-speaking authors such as Joseph Schumpeter, Max Weber and Karl Marx. But these authors were part of a great milieu, and many around them were similar in stature. The few are praised but the majority is forgotten. Yet many of the ideas of the few were borrowed or developed from others who lack the credit. Some examples are given in the present work. I began making substantial notes for this book in about 1994, when I was at the University of Cambridge. Originally, I planned to write a history of institutional economics. A brief discussion of Marxism and the German historical school was to be the ﬁrst part of the work. It quickly became clear that the neglected German historical school, and those inﬂuenced by them, had much more to say on the problem than others had given them credit. The project expanded and it became clear that the planned work on the history of institutional economics could not be conﬁned to a single volume. Discussion of the German historical school, their successors and the problem of historical speciﬁcity would occupy a single volume in itself. The book evolved into a historical and analytical study in which the problem of historical specificity is the dominant theme. However, no more than three chapters focus directly on the German historical school. This book does not attempt to provide an adequate summary of either the historical school or of institutionalism. Both these schools of economic thought are addressed in terms of their engagement with the problem of historical speciﬁcity. The argument here is largely at the level of meta-theory; an attempt is made to explore how different theories relate to each other and mesh together and whether each may be useful as a means to understand a particular segment of reality. Meta-theory occupies the debatable ground between philosophy and theory itself. Accordingly, there is less detailed discussion here of specific theories. Writing a book of this kind where every theory was elaborated in detail would have been impossible. The reader is referred to appropriate sources where necessary. In facing the thematic problem of this book, the establishment of metatheoretical co-ordinates is a primary and substantial task. While the contemporary ﬁxation on general theoretical systems is criticised, it is also argued here that some general principles are indispensable. What are also required are additional levels of theorising, guided by broad, general principles but rooted, both conceptually and empirically, in historically and geographically speciﬁc phenomena. It is my strong conviction that the task of development and reconstruction in economics and the other social sciences cannot be fulfilled without a more adequate knowledge of past intellectual history. Without this knowledge we are condemned to repeat the mistakes of the past. Moreover, the thoughts and debates of past economists form a rich quarry of inspiration and ideas. © 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\nRegrettably, however, the history of economic thought is an unpopular subdiscipline. It is widely regarded as irrelevant and arcane. Frank Hahn (1992, p. 165) expressed a prevalent view among economists when he wrote: ‘What the dead had to say, when of value, has long since been absorbed, and when we need to say it again we can generally say it much better.’ Hahn ignored the possibility that much of value has simply been forgotten. If we consider the problem of historical speciﬁcity then we can see how wrong his attitude can be. In fact, discussion of the problem dominated economics for about a hundred years. Yet neither the problem nor any adequate solution to it has been ‘absorbed’. Today, we do not ‘say it much better’. On the contrary, economists are silent on this topic: the problem is widely forgotten and ignored. Not only is history of ideas an unfashionable and neglected subject, but even the standard history of economics textbooks do not do justice to the problem of historical speciﬁcity. The historical school is typically and hastily dismissed for its alleged ‘atheoretical’ descriptivism and naïveté.1 This assessment is not only disproportionately brief but also it is inaccurate. While an over-emphasis on the power of empirical work can be found in the writings of some of its members, the historical school contained theorists such as Friedrich List, Thomas Cliffe Leslie, Gustav von Schmoller, Werner Sombart and Max Weber. All of these made a signiﬁcant theoretical contribution: they attempted to explain or understand the world, as well as to describe it. Part II is devoted to the attempts of the historical school to deal with the problem of historical specificity. The action takes place mainly in Germany, Austria and the British Isles. When the history of economic thought is revisited, with the problem of historical specificity in mind, new perspectives emerge. The historical school is revealed as grappling, for a hundred years, with one of the central methodological and theoretical problems of social science. Even Alfred Marshall – too often wrongly depicted as an antagonist of historicism – is unveiled as being highly sensitive to this methodological problem. He aligned himself with Schmoller and was rightly critical of some of the English historicists in their empiricist excesses. Nevertheless, this is much more a story of failure than success. While important insights have been neglected, treatments of the problem were much impaired by the empiricist illusion that the facts could speak for themselves. It was only with the later historical school that this misconception was dropped and substantial theoretical progress began. But these efforts were overwhelmed with the real historical events of fascism and war. An understanding of the sources of this failure and the reasons why attempts to rectify the situation were terminated, can strengthen any modern effort to deal with the problem. Even out of error, ideas can evolve. Part III discusses the overall fate and eventual neglect of the problem, as both economics and sociology became immersed in ahistorical generalities. The\n\n1 Notable exceptions include Schumpeter (1954), Pribram (1983) and Perlman and McCann (1998). In addition, Hutchison (1953, pp. 293–8) pointed out that the modern Austrian criticism of socialist central planning was anticipated in the work of members of the German historical school.\n\n© 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\nnarrative switches to the United States as well as Britain. Again, the central motif of historical speciﬁcity changes previous depictions of the intellectual scene. For example, despite his revolutionary contribution to macroeconomics, John Maynard Keynes is revealed as fostering a neglect of the problem and helping to promote a postwar fashion for general theorising in economics. At about the same time, Lionel Robbins attempted to place microeconomics on ahistorical foundations and Talcott Parsons did much the same for sociology. What is revealed in parts II and III is a tragi-comedy of errors. The narrative involves misunderstandings, shortcomings, complacency, untimely deaths, suicides, personal rivalries, moral deﬁciencies, careerist ambitions and deliberate attempts to ignore or rewrite history. It also tells of the accidents and speciﬁc historical contexts that led to the claimed universality of modern economic theory. We see the effects of foreign invasion, of crises and famine, of two devastating world wars, of the academic milieus of great universities, of ideologies such as liberalism and totalitarianism, of nationalist movements, of immigration ﬂows, of the rise of English as a world language, and of the changing balance of world power. In truth, there is historical speciﬁcity written all over the entire history of ideas, as well as over economic and social theories that acknowledge no real historical speciﬁcity. Part IV departs from the historical narrative. I attempt some provisional and incomplete answers to the thematic questions of this volume. I suggest a conceptual framework in which the problem of historical specificity might begin to be resolved. Overall, an attempt is made to move forward the discussion of the problem of historical speciﬁcity from a point where it had been abandoned, more than sixty years ago. In abandoning its former historical orientation, economics as a whole was radically transformed. It lost its emphasis on the study of real, socio-economic systems, instead to become a deductivist exploration of ‘individual choice’. The task of explanation of the choosing agent was consigned to psychology. At the same time, sociology found territory adjacent to the new economics, and then soared skywards in generalising abstraction. This book explores some of the causes and consequences of these developments. Although the historical and theoretical narrative here centres on economics, there is some discussion of sociology and other social sciences. The problems addressed here are so central and important for social theory as a whole that they are hopefully of interest to all social scientists. This book is written with this wider audience in mind. It is not the intention of this book to provide a new theory. That would be a major task, requiring several further volumes. Those who expect one will surely be disappointed. They will also be misinformed. Economics has grappled with the problem of historical specificity for more than 160 years and it would be very naïve to expect a single author, in a single part of a single volume, to sort out the problem once and for all. Part IV offers some preliminary suggestions towards a future solution – nothing more. Instead, the main objective is to restore discussion of the problem of historical speciﬁcity to its rightful place, to learn from the achievements and mistakes of © 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\nthe past, and to make some suggestions for reconstruction of the social science agenda. In the view of its author, the book will be a success simply if puts some of these issues in the limelight. Due to increasing loads of administration and teaching, I was not able to make much progress on this book until I left the University of Cambridge at the end of 1998. I obtained a Research Chair at the University of Hertfordshire and I was then able to devote almost all my time to research. This was a wonderful opportunity. I plan further volumes on the economic thought of American institutionalism, as well as other works on the development of the methodology and theory of institutional economics. My Economics and Utopia (1999a) also raised the question of historical speciﬁcity. I expand here considerably upon some of the arguments in that book. There are also links here with some of my earlier works, such as The Democratic Economy (1984), Economics and Institutions (1988), Economics and Evolution (1993) and Evolution and Institutions (1999b). The argument here builds on several of my earlier books and a few passages repeat arguments made elsewhere. I have done my best to present a ﬂuent and complete argument and at the same time to reduce such repetition to an absolute minimum.\n\n© 2001 Geoffrey M.

Hodgson\n\n1\n\nPart I INTRODUCTION\n\n© 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n2\n\n1 THE LIMITATIONS OF GENERAL THEORY\n\nScience must begin with myths, and with the criticism of myths. (Sir Karl Popper, ‘The Philosophy of Science’ (1957))\n\nHistory is important, partly because every complex organism, every human being and every society carries the baggage of its past. Evolution builds on past survivals that encumber actions in the present. Choices made by our ancestors can be difﬁcult to undo. For example, the standard railway gauge used by modern high-speed trains has its origins in the axle dimensions of horse-drawn carts of over two thousand years ago. We travel on railways that were designed with some dimensions inherited from an ancient and inappropriate means of transport. Other examples of lock-in and path dependence in the evolution of technology and conventions are well known in the social sciences.1 If history matters – at least in the sense of social development being path dependent – then our analyses must explore the particularities of the past. While we may retain general principles or guidelines, detailed analyses of particular events, structures and circumstances are required. If history matters in this sense, then general theories have their limits. That is one reason why some of the quoted examples of technological lock-in have been controversial: path dependence dulls the lure of a general theory.2 In contrast, if we were to possess an adequate general theory of socio-economic structure and change, then we would use it to understand every kind of circumstance within its broad domain of application. Speciﬁc circumstances would enter the theory merely as data. Particular theories would no longer be required. The achievement of a general theory of economic behaviour would make the construction of a historically delimited theory redundant. A single theoretical framework would encompass all possibilities. That is the lure of a general theory.3 1 See, for example, David (1985, 1994), Dosi et al. (1988), Arthur (1989, 1994), North (1990), Hodgson (1993a), H. P. Young (1996). 2 Note the discussion of network externalities, and the controversy over whether the QWERTY keyboard and the VHS video system were in some sense optimal or not (David, 1985; Katz and Shapiro, 1985, 1986, 1994; Liebowitz and Margolis, 1990, 1994). 3 There is a slight difference of meaning between the terms ‘general theory’ and ‘universal theory’ in that the latter connotes a wider domain of applicability than the former. Both terms are used in this book. Different possible levels of generality emerge after the introduction of different levels of abstraction. See chapter 21 below.\n\n© 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n3\n\nNevertheless, it is argued here that such a goal is impossible, at least in the social sciences. The desire for a general theory obliges scientists to simplify and to overturn the very generality for which they strive. The lure of a general theory is in part responsible for a degree of neglect of history in contemporary economics and sociology. This chapter considers the basis of this lure. It argues that general theories can be only of limited use in social science. A place for historically speciﬁc theories must remain. For centuries, however, scientists have admired general theories. The Ancient Greeks sought common patterns and symmetries in nature. Pythagoras observed a blacksmith at work and noticed that iron bars of different lengths gave out sounds of different pitch under the strokes of the hammer. Conceptions of sound and length, of music and measure, were amalgamated. Centuries later, at the beginning of the modern world, Isaac Newton formulated his general laws of motion, explaining both the motion of earthly projectiles and the movements of the planets. In 1820 Hans Christian Oersted saw that an electric current ﬂowing through a wire deflected a nearby compass. He thus discovered the hitherto unrecognised link between magnetism and electricity and inspired the development of the electric motor. Michael Faraday set himself the problem of ﬁnding the connections between light, heat, magnetism and electricity, and developed a uniﬁed theory of electromagnetic radiation. Energy and matter became later uniﬁed in Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity. Physics still struggles to capture diverse phenomena within a common explanatory framework. Science tries to unify: it strives for general theories. The goal of uniﬁcation has endured in the history of science and has inspired many of its achievements. Much innovation in science comes from combining different phenomena in a more general scientiﬁc framework. Philosophers of science have rightly identiﬁed the power and value of explanatory uniﬁcation. For example, Paul Thagard (1978) and Philip Kitcher (1981, 1989) have correctly pointed out that explanatory unification has played a significant role in the development of the natural sciences. Likewise, Clark Glymour (1980, p. 31) has argued that successful explanations in science have the feature that they ‘eliminate contingency and they unify’. The importance and possible value of explanatory uniﬁcations should not be underestimated. However, the quest for explanatory uniﬁcation should not be pushed to the point where the nature and value of the particular explanation adopted are given weak scrutiny. Some explanations may unify, but be of little worth. A theory that every event is caused by the gods is an explanatory uniﬁcation, but it is of little scientiﬁc signiﬁcance. Likewise, as discussed in chapter 16 below, a non-falsiﬁable general theory such as ‘everyone is a utility maximiser’ is also of little explanatory value. This book addresses the limits of explanatory uniﬁcation in the social sciences. Some claims of explanatory uniﬁcation are defective in their failure to consider their ontological presuppositions. Others fail, similarly, to question what is meant by ‘explanation’, being merely satisﬁed to point to a theory that seemingly ‘ﬁts’ every eventuality. The ideas that everyone maximises their utility, or that every event is caused by gods, come into this category. However, once we attempt to build more careful and meaningful explanations, then we are faced with the © 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n4\n\nproblem that economic reality changes in a way that physical reality does not. Yet the lure of a general theory has often overcome such critical reﬂections. The lure of a general theory pervades the social as well as the natural sciences. Again it is believed that a general theory is always better than one with a narrower domain of analysis. Consequently, it is upheld that to become respectable, economics, sociology and anthropology must also uncover general principles or laws – much in the manner of the natural sciences. The aim is for one theory that ﬁts all circumstances.4 This notion emerged in the heyday of classical economics. While Adam Smith attempted judiciously to blend induction with deduction, at the same time he sought general principles and laws. However, his classical successors such as David Ricardo and especially Nassau Senior went much further. They pursued more and more an axiomatic and deductivist method, attempting to derive universal conclusions from a few professedly general and fundamental propositions. Ranged against this Ricardian tendency was Thomas Robert Malthus. Malthus criticised the over-emphasis on deduction and generalisation. He wrote in 1819: ‘The principal cause of error, and of the differences which prevail at present among the scientiﬁc writers on political economy, appears to me to be a precipitate attempt to simplify and generalize’ (Malthus, 1836, p. 4). Signiﬁcantly, John Maynard Keynes (1972, pp. 100–1) wrote in his 1933 essay on Malthus: ‘If only Malthus, instead of Ricardo, had been the parent stem from which nineteenth-century economics proceeded, what a much wiser and richer place the world would be today!’ However, Keynes himself made two crucial mistakes. Both helped the Ricardian rather than the Malthusian stem to triumph and spread across the world. One error was to neglect the German historical school and its alternative to Ricardian deductivism. The other mistake was to recommend a ‘general theory’ of his own. The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936) is one of the most famous cases of an attempted general theory in economics. Keynes’s perceptions in his Malthus essay were right, but – as argued in chapter 15 of this work – he did not do enough to prevent a strain of deductivist general theorising that dominated economics for forty years after his death. The case of Keynes is an object lesson. The search for a general theory is not conﬁned to mainstream or neoclassical economics. All sorts of economists have revered a ‘general theory’.5 For much of the postwar period, ‘general equilibrium analysis’ has been in vogue in economics. It has attempted to elaborate the general conditions for the existence and stability of market equilibria (Debreu, 1959; Arrow and Hahn, 1971). This work was at the cutting edge of theoretical economics until it ran into analytical difﬁculties in the 1970s. It was eclipsed by the rising interest in game theory in the 1980s. 4 The classic account of the growth of ‘physics envy’ in economics is Mirowski (1989). However, some reservations concerning Mirowski’s thesis are expressed below and in Hodgson (1999b). Overall, economics suffers perhaps more from mathematics envy rather than physics envy (McCloskey, 1991; Blaug, 1999). 5 For example, a ‘general theory’ is proclaimed in the titles of Roemer (1982), Nell (1998) and Ormerod (1998).\n\n© 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n5\n\nLikewise, in sociology, there has been a similar reverence for general theory of social action, interaction and structure. Twentieth-century milestones in sociological theory – such as Talcott Parsons (1937a), Robert Merton (1949), George Homans (1961), Peter Blau (1964), Jeffrey Alexander (1982–3), Anthony Giddens (1984), James Coleman (1990), Harrison White (1992) and Niklas Luhmann (1995) – are all general attempts to understand ‘society’, largely unconﬁned to any historically speciﬁc epoch or type of social structure.6 Overall, general theories have pervaded economics and sociology for the second half of the twentieth century. General principles are assumed and their logical consequences are explored. In this respect, at least, the social sciences look to physics and other natural sciences as their role models. The more general and inclusive the theory, the greater its prestige. Universalisations take the accolade. What characterises a general theory in the social sciences? Here we shall take the term ‘general theory’ to mean the following: It is any substantial explanation or model of the principal characteristics and behaviour of human economies or societies, largely or wholly in terms of features that are assumed to be common to most conceivable social or economic systems. It is true that modern mainstream economists attempt to tailor their theories to specific situations. There are theories of perfect competition, theories of monopoly, theories of oligopoly, theories of labour markets and so on. Such theories may claim to apply to a speciﬁc set of circumstances. In some of their assumptions, these theories differ from one another. Nevertheless, some of their features are like those of a general theory. First, some presumptions – such as rationality, scarcity and fixed preferences – are common to all these theories. These core assumptions are held to apply to all socio-economic systems. Second, it is rarely claimed that the theory involved applies to a speciﬁc type of socioeconomic system or a limited historical period. In these two senses, ahistorical and acultural generalities pervade even speciﬁc modes of theorising in modern mainstream economics. The goal of a general theory has been pursued to the greatest extent in the type of general equilibrium theory developed by Léon Walras, Kenneth Arrow, Gerard Debreu and others. Significantly, from the 1930s to the 1980s, general equilibrium was one of the most prestigious areas of research in economic theory. Of course, the word ‘general’ in ‘general equilibrium theory’ applies to the word ‘equilibrium’ rather than ‘theory’. General equilibrium is thereby distinguished from partial equilibrium. Nevertheless, general equilibrium theorists have used the rhetoric and appeal of general theorising as well, often using the term ‘general theory of economic equilibrium’. Attempts have been made to apply this general equilibrium approach to feudalism and socialism, as well as to capitalism (Lange and Taylor, 1938; Rader, 1971). In particular, both Oskar Lange and Joseph\n\n6 For overviews and discussions of the character of these general theories in sociology, see, for example, Fararo (1989), Holmwood (1996) and Mouzelis (1995). Notably, several of names of sociological general theorists mentioned here were strongly influenced by Parsons, including Merton and Luhmann (who were his students) and Homans (who was a colleague of Parsons at Harvard).\n\n© 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n6\n\nSchumpeter lauded Walras as the architect of a ‘truly general theory’ in economics.7 Abstraction and simpliﬁcation are necessary for any theory. General theorists, however, build upon features that are taken as common or universal, rather than historically or culturally specific. Their guiding examples in this respect are the successful explanatory uniﬁcations and general theories that are found in the natural sciences. For example, in economics, general equilibrium theorists have made ostensibly general assumptions concerning human agents, their endowments and their interactions. With these they attempt to deduce some general results concerning economic equilibria. Likewise, in social theory, general assumptions are made about social agents, their ‘exchanges’ and the social structures that they inhabit.\n\nGENERAL THEORISTS, NIHILISTS AND EMPIRICISTS Nevertheless, general theorising is not universally popular. Ranged against the proponents of general theory, in both economics and sociology, are those that are critical of its operational usefulness, explanatory adequacy and universal claims. For instance, ‘post-modernism’ is a major assault on general theorising in the social sciences. Post-modernists emphatically reject grand narratives and totalising theory (Lyotard, 1984). The problem is that they can do this only by means of a totalising, meta-narrative of their own. There is no means by which to dispense with a grand narrative other than by an even grander, universal story. Hence the post-modernists fall into a paradox of their own making. As Andrew Sayer (1995, p. 223) puts it: ‘Those who are sceptical of meta-narratives should turn their suspicions on “modernism” and “postmodernism” ﬁrst.’ There is no way of avoiding this paradox: grand theory cannot be dismissed by yet another grand, general discourse, whatever its rhetorical appeal. Post-modernism is further weakened by its abandonment of the search for truth. Post-modernism is a symptomatic but nihilistic reaction against the excessive claims for general theorising in social science. Logically, any argument against general theories must involve general statements or narratives. Although these statements are not necessarily general theories, in the sense deﬁned above, they are nevertheless general in their scope. The rejection of general theories must itself involve generalities. There is no escape. Post-modernism rightly detects some of the limits of general theorising but veers off in a largely unwarranted and unacceptable direction. These mistakes might have been avoided if post-modernists had some awareness of past debates concerning the limits of general theory in the social sciences. We shall briefly\n\n7 See Lange (1938), Schumpeter (1954, p. 1082).\n\n© 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n7\n\ndiscuss post-modernism again in the next chapter, after the problem of historical speciﬁcity has been introduced in more detail. Other critics of general theories take refuge in empirical work. Empiricism is defined as the broad notion that knowledge is based primarily on experience rather than on any body of theory.8 Empiricists hold that reality can be understood only by detailed, empirical engagement. It is believed that the search for truth is an empirical matter; it involves the gathering of data rather than the unsupported erection of theoretical postulates. If any theoretical generalisation is possible, empiricists believe that it must emerge on the basis of extensive empirical enquiry. Today, we find both empiricists and general theorists in university social science departments. For centuries, a version of empiricism has been a haven for critics of general theorising. This type of empiricism is antithetical to all theory. We also ﬁnd empiricist hybrids, who accept some universal propositions, but also believe that further truths are established on the basis of data alone. These hybrids accept the desirability of universal assumptions and then immerse themselves in empirical work, believing that universal truths can eventually be established by induction.9 Over time, the balance of debate has shifted back and forth between these various positions. Intellectual fashions come and go. As both economics and sociology go through periods of theoretical crisis, empiricism is seen as the salvation. Even further, the inadequacies of general theorising sometimes create a reaction against all theory. Theory is abandoned in search of the facts. The anti-theoretical empiricists march forth with their clipboards and computers. But as some cohorts of these empiricists get lost in the analytical swamplands of questionnaires and statistics, new groups of general theorists emerge, promising order and deliverance. And so it goes on, each group ascending then descending. The truth is that both empiricism and general theorising have their intellectual limitations, as does any hybrid combination of the two. Both empiricists and general theorists place their conceptual weight on universal assumptions, placing less emphasis on concepts and theories that are more appropriate to the speciﬁc situation at hand. Although empiricists may sometimes fail to champion an explicit general theory, empiricism always has a hidden general theory of its own. This is because, in attempting to measure any quantity, or trying to establish any empirical regularity, acts of classiﬁcation or taxonomy are unavoidable. For empirical enquiry, entities are placed into groups. The most important properties\n\n8 This is a standard deﬁnition of the term. Inductivism and positivism are particular versions of empiricism. Positivism is a version of empiricism that emphasises empirical conﬁrmation – rather than falsification – by observation or experiment. Empiricism has a long history and exists in several different forms. Nevertheless, they all have in common the notion that knowledge is based primarily on experience. 9 Induction refers to the method of generalising from a ﬁnite sample. If we observe a large number of white swans we may presume, by induction, that all swans are white. However, it is difﬁcult to be sure that we have observed all existing swans, no matter how many we have seen. Indeed, in this case it turns out that in Australia there are black swans, and the presumption of universality is false.\n\n© 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n8\n\nand relations are identiﬁed. Connections are made. Accordingly, all empirical investigation involves prior judgements of sameness and difference. For example, we cannot examine transaction costs in firms without first having a notion of what is, and what is not, a transaction cost and a ﬁrm. Classiﬁcation, by bringing together entities in discrete groups, must refer to common qualities. These qualities themselves have generality: they must be assumed to endure through space and time. All empirical work thus relies on the principle known as ‘the uniformity of nature’. For some types, entities or qualities, it has to be assumed that the type, entity or quality in one place in space and time remains the same type, entity or quality at another place in space and time. Otherwise we are faced with an immense collection of disconnected entities and qualities, and no meaningful empirical or other scientific investigation is possible. This supposition of the uniformity of nature is a highly general theoretical principle. Although empirical work depends upon it, the principle cannot be proven or disproven by the data. It must be assumed at the outset. The idea that empirical data are sufﬁcient for all knowledge thus founders. The empirical researcher must classify, and classification depends on the metaphysical principle of the uniformity of nature. Any empirical investigation depends on the assumptions of identity, continuity and measurability. These assumptions cannot themselves be derived from empirical data. Pure empiricism is thus incoherent. In addition, a principal goal of any science is explanation. Explanation involves the suggestion of relationships of cause and effect. Without a presumption of causality, there can be no convincing scientiﬁc explanation of any phenomenon. However, no empirical enquiry can itself establish a causal relation. No cause can be perceived. Data cannot show us cause and effect. Correlations between sets of events are not necessarily indications of cause and effect. Correlation is not causation. Since David Hume’s discussion of this problem, it has been widely accepted by philosophers that causal relations cannot be discerned in the data themselves. Accordingly, any scientiﬁc explanation involves the assumption of causal relationships that are themselves absent in the empirical data: they must be assumed. Empirical data cannot on their own provide causal explanations.10 Theory has primacy over facts, because concepts and theories are required to formulate any factual statement. However, this does not mean that science always works by ﬁrst formulating a theoretical explanation and then testing it. There are many cases in the history of science where facts have ﬁrst emerged without a theory that explains them. Science may subsequently triumph by supplying a theoretical explanation. In this manner, facts may inform or impel the formation of theories. But this does not negate the proposition that all facts depend upon some theoretical grounding. Consider, for example, the professedly anomalous fact, noted by Wassily Leontief (1953), that the more developed countries have imported relatively more 10 The assumption that every event has a cause is a special postulate concerning the uniformity of nature. Hence the problems of causality and uniformity of nature are closely related.\n\n© 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n9\n\ncapital-intensive products than they have exported. Recognition of this ‘fact’ requires prior theoretical concepts such as ‘developed’, ‘capital-intensity’ and ‘import’. Second, any explanation of this phenomenon requires a theory that cannot spring from the facts alone. For these reasons an empiricist epistemology is ﬂawed. However, this does not deny the possibility, as in the case of the socalled Leontief paradox, that facts may stimulate the search for new theories.11\n\nTHE LIMITS TO EXPLANATORY UNIFICATION By its nature, a general theory achieves some explanatory uniﬁcation. However, as Uskali Mäki (1990a, 1990b, forthcoming) has shown, there are explanatory uniﬁcations of different types. First, logical or derivational uniﬁcation means that ‘more and more statements within a discipline become derivable from the same set of axioms, or when the same set of statements becomes derivable from a smaller set of axioms’ (Mäki 1990b, p. 331). This notion of uniﬁcation involves purely deductive connections between axioms and derived statements. Many of the claims of explanatory uniﬁcation within economics are of this derivational type. They are deductive accomplishments without ontological grounding. While derivational uniﬁcation is based on the inferential capabilities of theories, the contrasting idea of ontological uniﬁcation is based on their referential and representational capabilities. If an ontological explanatory uniﬁcation is possible, then it must be based on some underlying, ontological unity among a set of phenomena; they must share some substantial ontic foundations. Any explanatory unity among phenomena must result from investigation and discovery, rather than the mere imposition of assumptions. Priority is given to entities rather than propositions (Mäki, forthcoming). Accordingly, the nature and location of the limits of general theorising vary in each case. The limits of general theorising by derivational uniﬁcation result from the lack of ontological grounding to its claims. These limits concern neither the boundaries of uniﬁcation, nor the number of items that can be uniﬁed, but the adequacy of the explanation. A derivational uniﬁcation may be achieved, but on its own it cannot constitute a causal explanation of real phenomena. On the other hand, the limits of ontological explanatory uniﬁcation depend upon existence or otherwise of underlying unities among the phenomena under investigation. While the search for underlying unities behind the diverse appearances of real phenomena is rightly a central aim of science, any absence of recurring elements or similarities poses limits to ontological unification. Ontological explanatory uniﬁcation requires the identiﬁcation of similar structures or causal mechanisms. The capacity of a theory to unify in this ontological sense depends not on its axioms or propositions, but on the degree of real, underlying unity or similarity in its domain of application. It is primarily these\n\n11 A good critique of positivism and empiricism in the social sciences is Hindess (1977). Bunge (1959) provided an excellent discussion of causality.\n\n© 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n10\n\npossible limits to ontological explanatory unification that concern us in the present work.12 We can conceive of reality as consisting of different ontological levels. There may be a level relating to matter addressed by physics, a level relating to molecules addressed by chemistry, a level relating to living organisms addressed by biology, and so on. These levels may themselves be subdivided. Within physics, for example, quantum physics and mechanics address different levels. Accordingly, different scientific theories may relate to different levels of reality. Although universal laws have both scientific appeal and some explanatory power, they are often of limited use when it comes to the detail of speciﬁc contexts and situations, operating at a different ontological level. Einstein’s theory of relativity may rule the universe, and its domain of application applies to all physical phenomena, but it tells us little of tomorrow’s weather or of the carrying capacity of the Golden Gate suspension bridge. In achieving uniﬁcation, general theories have an awesome appeal. But neither uniﬁcation nor generality mean that the theory is sufﬁcient for particular, contingent circumstances at a different ontological level. Arguably, within the social sciences, there are differences among the real items to be explained that place limits on the scope for any general theory. Long ago, Max Weber reached a similar conclusion. In 1904, Weber (1949, pp. 72–80) wrote that ‘the most general laws’ are ‘the least valuable’ because ‘the more comprehensive their scope’ the more they ‘lead away’ from the task of explaining the particular phenomenon in question. This argument is similar to Ernest Nagel’s (1961, p. 575) ‘principle of the inverse variation of extension with intension’. This principle alleges that there is a trade-off between the generality and the informative content of a theory. This argument, developed further by Lars Udéhn (1992), has some force against the claimed universality of some of the assumptions of modern mainstream economics.13 It has been suggested that a similar problem may apply to the natural sciences. Physicists are now in hot pursuit of the TOE (Theory of Everything) or the GUT (Grand Uniﬁed Theory) that will marry quantum theory with the general theory of relativity. Superstring theory is part of this project. But as Jack Cohen and Ian Stewart (1994, p. 365) put it: ‘A Theory of Everything would have the whole universe wrapped up. And that’s precisely what would make it useless.’14 12 Although T. Lawson (1997) provides no extensive discussion of the place, types and limits of explanatory uniﬁcation, his stress on the need for open-minded investigation into underlying causal mechanisms and structures is also valuable in this context. 13 However, while I concur with much of Udéhn’s argument, he credits neoclassical economics with some relative success in explaining market, as opposed to non-market, phenomena. While the genuine achievements of neoclassical economics should not be denied, as Clower (1994, 1999) and others have noted, it concedes too much to suggest that it has an adequate deﬁnition and analysis of market institutions. 14 See Cartwright (1994) for a stimulating discussion of the role of allegedly general theories in physics and elsewhere. She argued that physical laws (such as Newton’s) would hold only insofar as nothing (such as a wind) interferes with the motion of a body in space (p. 282). However, the wind itself could be regarded as a mass of separate particles, each subject to the same (Newtonian)\n\n© 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n11\n\nAnother set of problems arise with some types of general theory that arise in the social sciences. Some of these problems are discussed in more detail in chapter 16 and elsewhere. The general theory that individual behaviour results from the maximisation of individual utility is a case in point. It is argued in chapter 16 that this theory is non-falsiﬁable and it can apply, in principle, to any behaviour, including the behaviour of non-human organisms. If this argument is valid then there is a crucial difference between theories like Newton’s or Einstein’s, on the one hand, and the theory of utility maximisation, on the other. The difference is that the laws of physics impose restrictions on the type of supplementary theory that can be accommodated. This is not the case with utility maximisation: any behaviour is compatible with it. The reckless pursuit of generality in the social sciences has created theories that are compatible with any possible behaviour by any possible organism. The same cannot be said for prominent theories in the natural sciences. Accordingly, much explanatory uniﬁcation in the social sciences is achieved without a search for recurring elements or similarities in reality. The theory of utility maximisation is a case in point. Instead of the successful identification of similar, underlying causal mechanisms and structures, its proponents simply manipulate this theory to fit any phenomenon. Hence, this theory achieves derivational uniﬁcation but not ontological uniﬁcation. In contrast, the Newtonian and Einsteinian theories achieved a high degree of ontological uniﬁcation. All sciences have to deal with both sameness and difference. As biologists Richard Levins and Richard Lewontin (1985, p. 141) have put it: ‘Things are similar: this makes science possible. Things are different: this makes science necessary.’ General theorists sometimes over-emphasise the similarities, neglecting the differences. These problems are particularly acute in the social sciences. A general theory can clumsily obscure all historical and geographical differences between different socio-economic systems. Nevertheless, there are some important examples of successful general theories concerning complex systems. Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution is the most important. However, without diminishing the importance of this great achievement, biology does not conﬁne itself to such generalities. Evolutionary biology has a few laws or general principles by which origin and development can be explained. Analysis of the evolution of a specific organism requires detailed data concerning the organism and its environment, and also specific explanations relevant to the species under consideration. Evolutionary biology requires theories that have both speciﬁc and general domains. As Lewontin (1991, pp. 142–3) has argued, the notion that ‘science consists of universal claims as opposed to mere historical statements is rubbish’ and ‘a great deal of the body\n\nlaws. Contrary to Cartwright, the laws would then remain universal. The problem is that this universal formulation is for practical purposes intractable. To deal with wind friction, we have to focus not on the multitude of wafting particles but on the emergent properties and different laws of wind itself. Only in this way is a tractable solution possible. Universal laws may exist in physics (and even in economics) but if we found them they may for this reason be of limited use.\n\n© 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n12\n\nof biological research and knowledge consists of narrative statements’. Likewise, in economics and the other social sciences, there is a place for both. Similarly, complex systems theory has established a few general principles. W. Ross Ashby’s (1952) ‘law of requisite variety’ is an example. However, once again, systems theory is unable to deliver very much more than this kind of thing at the general level. It ‘works’ only when it is augmented by much more speciﬁc assumptions. The limited but potentially positive role of such general principles and theories is discussed further in chapter 18 of this work. In chapter 21 an attempt is made to show how a limited general theory can supplement more speciﬁc theories and explanations. To this end, some ideas from evolutionary biology and systems theory are applied in chapter 22. But it is recognised these principles are far from sufﬁcient on their own. GENERAL THEORY AND COMPLEXITY There are strong reasons why the quest for a substantial, richly textured, general theory of complex systems will always be elusive. Simpliﬁcation has to be radical, stripping any general theory of its comprehensive, explanatory ambitions. Even with a limited number of assumptions, the chain of deductive reasoning cannot take us very far. Kurt Gödel is famous for his demonstration that the axiomatic method has inherent limitations (Nagel and Newman, 1959). He proved that it is impossible to establish the internal logical consistency of a very large class of deductive systems. It is widely believed that this impossibility result is even more pervasive than Gödel was able to reveal. Proofs may be computationally out of reach. Hence Jack Cohen and Ian Stewart (1994, p. 439) argue: sufﬁciently rich formal systems do obey Gödel’s theorem, so they must contain true statements whose proofs are a thousand times as long, or a billion times as long, as the statements are. That is, such systems necessarily possess properties that are far simpler than any route by which you could establish them. Christopher Cherniak (1986, pp. 79–80) has noted the limits of computation in logical systems. It has been shown that all the possible calculation resources of the entire universe, computing for all of the time that the universe has existed, would be insufﬁcient to determine the logical consistency of more than 138 welldeﬁned propositions. Clearly, the computational capacities of a human agent are much more limited than this. The number of propositions that we can process logically must be much less than 138. Claude Shannon (1950) pointed out that there are about 30 chess moves that can be made from each position on the chess board. In a typical game each play makes an average of 40 moves. Accordingly, there are about (302)40 or 10120 possible chess moves in a single game. This number is greater than the number of particles in the universe, professedly 1080. Any attempt at a general analysis of chess strategy is thwarted by this problem of combinatorial explosion, despite the fact that the rules of chess are relatively simple. © 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n13\n\nConsider an attempt to develop a general theory of network structures. A general theory of n points in space would have to embrace the possibility of n(n – 1)/2 connections between any two points in that space. If n is 1000, then the number of possible connections is close to half a million. If a connection is either present or absent, then each may be represented – as a simple ﬁrst step – by a binary value. Accordingly, the number of possible structures in this simple model is:\n\n2 n(n–1)/2 If n is 1000, then the value of this expression is greater than 10150000. The philosopher Willard van Orman Quine (1987) has coined the word ‘hyperastronomic’ to describe numbers greater than the number of particles in the universe. The number we are concerned with is much greater: a simple general model of a network, with binary-valued connections and 1000 nodes, has to cover an indescribable scale of mega-hyperastronomic variety.15 Combinatorial explosions such as these paralyse attempts to place complex phenomena within a richly textured general theory. Adding new dimensions to the space of possibilities, or new branches to a decision tree, increases the scope of the theory. But the computational mass explodes with devastating effect. To deal with complexity even on this relatively modest scale, simplifying assumptions have to be made. Either we are confined to broad principles governing all such structures, or the theory has to confine itself to a manageable and relatively tiny subset of all possible structures. Indeed, such a small subset may represent the most important or relevant phenomena in the real world. In this case the theory has to cease to be general. Otherwise, the analysis is conﬁned to broad statements that do not explain very much.\n\nGENERAL THEORISING IN ECONOMICS A central problem with all models in the social sciences is that they have to consider not only the structured relations between agents, but also the computations of the agents themselves, as they react to their changing circumstances. Both the system and the agents must be modelled, where the model of the agent includes its perception of the system. This is a level of tangled complexity that is difﬁcult to put in a general model, at least without the imposition of severe simplifying assumptions. For example, how does the individual agent deal with multiple markets in a general equilibrium model? Roy Radner (1968) has considered the computational problems involved. The general equilibrium models of the type of Kenneth Arrow and Gerard Debreu assumed that a ‘market’ existed for the exchange\n\n15 Accordingly, general theories of graphs or networks have to concentrate on structural or system level properties rather than detailed comparisons of speciﬁc network structures.\n\n© 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n14\n\nof every possible commodity, on every possible date, in every possible state of nature. Hence if there are a thousand types of commodity, a thousand possible ‘dates’ and a thousand possible ‘states’ then there will be a billion different markets. Assuming all possibilities and connections, the number of markets explodes beyond the calculating engagement of any human agent. Radner (1968, p. 32) concluded that ‘there is a basic difﬁculty in incorporating computational limitations in . . . equilibrium theory based on optimizing behaviour.’ Overall, general equilibrium theorists have had great difficulty deriving general explanatory principles. As Arrow (1986, p. S388) declared: ‘In the aggregate, the hypothesis of rational behaviour has in general no implications.’ Within general equilibrium theory, the aggregated excess demand functions can take almost any form (Sonnenschein, 1972, 1973a, 1973b; Debreu, 1974; Mantel, 1974).16 As S. Abu Turab Rizvi pointed out, the conclusions of Sonnenschein, Debreu, and Mantel are general and devastating. The main result is that the hypothesis of individual rationality, and other assumptions made at the micro level, gives no guidance to an analysis of macro-level phenomena: the assumption of rationality or utility maximisation is not enough to talk about social regularities. (Rizvi, 1994a, p. 363) Facing such problems, Alan Kirman (1992, p. 118) wrote that ‘there is no plausible formal justification for the assumption that the aggregate of individuals, even maximizers, acts itself like an individual maximizer.’ Research into the problems of the uniqueness and stability of general equilibria has shown that they may be indeterminate and unstable unless very strong assumptions are made, such as the supposition that society as a whole behaves as if it were a single individual (Arrow, 1986; Coricelli and Dosi, 1988). Not only is it assumed that preference functions are exogenously given, it is also assumed that all these preference functions are exactly the same. Because general theories become overwhelmed by explosive complexity, all attempts at general theorising have ultimately to abandon many generalities. They simplify, declaring that ‘more work remains to be done’ to generalise the model. The principal theoretical results of general equilibrium theory have depended on such restrictive assumptions. Truly general theorising has proved to be difﬁcult, if not impossible. It is widely accepted that the only truly general explanatory principle that has been derived from general equilibrium theory is ‘everything depends on everything else’. The weakness of the theory derives in part from its wanton pursuit of universality, as well as from the limitations of its basic axioms.17 16 See also Lavoie (1992, pp. 36–41), Rizvi (1994a), Screpanti and Zamagni (1993, pp. 344–53). 17 Mirowski (1989) and Potts (2000) have characterised general equilibrium analysis as a mathematical ‘ﬁeld theory’ where every point in space is connected with every other. Potts argued that, on the contrary, economic reality is characterised by limited interconnectedness, as in a lattice or network. Following the precedents of Kirman (1983, 1987), Bush (1983), Ellerman (1984) and Mirowski (1991), Potts saw mathematical techniques such as graph theory as an appropriate formalisation of the limited interconnectedness of this reality.\n\n© 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n15\n\nIn practice, all attempts to erect an all-embracing general theory in economics have been highly limited or have led to failure. Leading general equilibrium theorists have latterly accepted the limitations of their project. For example, Frank Hahn (1980, p. 132) has candidly admitted that the typical Walrasian type of theory excludes time, because it collapses the future into the present. It also excludes money, which is essentially a means of dealing with an uncertain future (Hahn, 1988, p. 972). Robert Clower (1994, 1999) passed a similarly negative verdict. He argued, on similar lines, that the Walrasian theory actually excludes production, markets, competition and real trade. Crucially, Walrasian theory concentrates on the logical existence of equilibrium states, at the expense of the mechanisms of market operation (Costa, 1998). Overall, theories of complex phenomena that aim to be general, typically turn out to be very narrow in their scope. Nevertheless, Hahn (1984) and others have tried to legitimise general equilibrium theory as an attempt to show ‘what the world would have to look like’ if markets were to operate properly. The declared aim was to demonstrate that real markets could work only at best under highly restrictive conditions. However, this legitimation of general equilibrium theory is unconvincing, because it is only one of many possible theoretical attempts to represent market mechanisms in the real world. It cannot simply be assumed that general equilibrium theory is the only possible theory. Another (perhaps undiscovered) theory might demonstrate that markets can always operate perfectly. To demonstrate that real world markets could ‘work’ only under highly restrictive conditions, we would have to look at all possible theoretical representations and formalisations of the market system and show that they too all ‘worked’ at best only under restrictive conditions. This, of course, is an impossible task for mere mortals. Hahn’s argument is invalid. Once again, the problem of intractability confounds the general theorist. In practice, attempts at general theorising in economics, and in other sciences dealing with complex phenomena, turn out to be restricted in their sweep, and thereby fail to be truly general. Although general principles or laws may exist, general theories are either not so general, or of very limited explanatory value. The elaboration of a truly general theory of complex phenomena can be confounded by severe problems of computation and tractability. WHY A GENERAL THEORY OF BARTER WOULD LOSE MONEY To recapitulate: it has been argued above that there are several problems with general theorising in the social sciences. One is of analytical and computational intractability. Facing such computational limits, general theorists typically simplify their models, thus abandoning the generality of the theory. Another related problem with a general theory is that we are conﬁned to broad principles governing all possible structures within the domain of analysis. In practice, a manageable theory has to conﬁne itself to a relatively tiny subset of all possible structures. Furthermore, the cost of excessive generality is to miss out on key features common to a subset of phenomena. © 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n16\n\nTo illustrate the latter argument, we shall consider two very simple ‘models’, of respectively a barter and a monetary economy, and consider which involves fewer assumptions and which is more general. Robert Clower’s (1967) theoretical framework is the starting point. In a barter economy, every commodity can in principle be traded for every other commodity. By contrast, in a money economy without barter, commodities are traded for money only. Hence, for Clower (1967, pp. 5–7) in a monetary economy: the peculiar feature of money as contrasted with a barter economy is precisely that some commodities in a money economy cannot be traded directly for all other commodities. . . . Money buys goods and goods buy money; but goods do not buy goods. The following diagrams – taken and amended slightly from Clower (1967) – represent these two contrasting arrangements:\n\nM\n\nC2\n\nC3\n\nC4\n\nM\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nC2\n\nX\n\nX\n\n0\n\n0\n\nX\n\nX\n\nC3\n\nX\n\n0\n\nX\n\n0\n\nX\n\nX\n\nC4\n\nX\n\n0\n\n0\n\nX\n\nC1\n\nC2\n\nC3\n\nC4\n\nC1\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nC2\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nC3\n\nX\n\nX\n\nC4\n\nX\n\nX\n\nExchange relations in a barter economy\n\nExchange relations in a monetary economy\n\nFigure 1.1 Exchange relations under money and barter\n\nIn Figure 1.1, C1, C2, C3 and C4 each represent commodities. M is money. The presence of symbol ‘x’ indicates that an exchange between two commodities is possible; a ‘0’ indicates that no such exchange normally takes place. This restrictive structure of an exchange economy is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the existence of money. In addition, money has other special attributes – such as a store of value and means of dealing with an uncertain future – that are not represented here.18 18 Accordingly, Clower (1967, p. 5) was wrong to suggest that ‘a barter economy is one in which all commodities are money commodities.’ On the contrary, commodities under barter do not possess all the characteristics of money. Clower stressed universal exchangeability to the exclusion of other characteristics. But his identification of the contrasting exchange structures of a barter and a monetary economy was nevertheless correct. It was notably endorsed by Davidson (1978, p. 142 n.). For further discussions of Clower’s exchange framework see Hodgson (1982, ch. 12), Mirowski (1986, pp. 212–19) and Potts (2000).\n\n© 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n17\n\nAt least at first sight, a barter economy model in which all exchanges are possible involves fewer restrictive assumptions than a model in which there is money. A model of a monetary economy must include additional restrictive assumptions in order to obtain the special structure of a monetary economy in Figure 1.1 above. The theoretical representation of a monetary economy requires more rather than fewer restrictive assumptions. Which model is ‘more general’? Of the two models in Figure 1.1, in a sense the barter economy model is more general. The presence of an ‘x ’ in any cell in a matrix in Figure 1.1 indicates that an exchange is possible, not that the exchange has to take place. In this sense, therefore, a monetary economy is a special case of a barter economy: the barter economy model is more general. However, this gives us a partial and potentially misleading picture and the statement needs to be qualiﬁed. Crucially, the very process of apparent ‘generalisation’ – from a monetary to a barter model – means that some essential features of a monetary economy are lost. Because everything in a barter economy has the money-like property of being able to exchange with everything else, then nothing has the property of money. If all men are kings, then there are no kings, because kingship implies the existence of non-regal inferiors. Money exists only because some exchanges are admitted and some are excluded. If all exchanges are admitted, then money is excluded. In this sense the barter model is not general: it excludes money. Hence, from this point of view, neither a barter model nor Walrasian-type theory (which excludes money) is an adequate representation of a monetary economy. For a theory to accommodate money, it has to incorporate the special qualities of money, with some forms of exchange being excluded. This example shows that, while seeming more general in scope, the barter economy model loses key features of the monetary economy. A general theory of barter would not include money. Greater generality in some respects can be gained at the cost of an ability to discriminate between and explain concrete particulars.\n\nGAME THEORY AND THE ESCAPE FROM GENERALITIES Without much discussion, mainstream economics quietly dropped the search for a general theory in the 1980s. The general equilibrium theory project had broken down (Kirman, 1989; Rizvi, 1994a, 1994b). Game theory had originally been developed and applied to economics by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in 1944. But it did not become popular until after the general equilibrium project had stumbled upon intractable problems in the 1970s. The eventual turn to game theory was an abandonment of a general theory of market behaviour. This 1980s’ bonﬁre of former generalities meant an important shift in preoccupation – to use the terms of Franklin Fisher (1989) – from ‘generalising’ to ‘exemplifying’ theory. Exemplifying theories are theories that say what might © 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n18\n\nhappen under speciﬁc conditions; generalising theories are ones that attempt to say what must happen. In game theory there are few general results. Outcomes depend on the assumed structure and parameters of the game itself. Such theoretical constructions exemplify rather than generalise. However, most game theorists retain ahistorical models of human motivation and agency. The individual remains a payoff or utility maximiser. Payoff maximisation is a general theory of individual behaviour but it does not constitute a complete theory of socio-economic dynamics. Game theory mixes payoff or utility maximisation with speciﬁc game structures. Many other generalities have disappeared. Robert Aumann (1985, p. 35) has claimed that the achievement of game theory would lie in ‘organizing in a single framework many disparate phenomena and many disparate ideas’. This amounts to the claim that game theory involves a limited form of derivational unification involving a ‘single framework’ being used to organise ‘many disparate ideas’. But this is a much weaker claim of derivational uniﬁcation than that of general equilibrium theory. Exponents of the latter made the claim that it was possible to explain or predict many economic phenomena with a single, unifying theory. The shift from the general equilibrium to the game theoretic research programme was thus the replacement of a purportedly unifying theory by a purportedly unifying framework, and the replacement of claims of explanation or prediction by the looser claim of a capacity to organise phenomena or ideas. With the exception of Fisher (1989), the abandonment by game theorists of the historical quest for a comprehensive general theory has occurred with remarkably little comment or reﬂection by mainstream economists. Nevertheless, the big message behind the abandonment of general equilibrium theory should not be overlooked. The true achievement of all the efforts behind the development of the Walrasian and Arrow–Debreu models is to show the severe limits of general theorising in economics. In addition, developments in computability theory in the 1980s and 1990s have shown that optimisation problems typically involve difﬁculties not only of speciﬁcation but also of computability.19 Perhaps the greatest overall achievement of mainstream economic theory in the last half of the twentieth century has been to conﬁrm the suspicion that substantive general theorising in economics will always bring highly limited and inadequate results. All substantive general theories in complex systems are characterised by shortcomings. If we put together the results of Gödel and the computability theorists, and combine these with insights gained from complexity theory and the failure of the general equilibrium project, then there is every reason to suppose that attainable general theories in the social sciences, even if important, are always of limited value. While there is no proof of this proposition, the balance of argument has now shifted. We have very strong reasons to believe that attainable and 19 For general statements see, for example, Cutland (1980), M. Davis et al. (1984) and Bennett and Landauer (1985). For applications to decision theory and economics see Gottinger (1982), Lewis (1985), Spear (1989), Anderlini and Sabourian (1995) and Velupillai (1996).\n\n© 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n19\n\nsubstantive general theorising will not take us very far; the onus on any remaining general theorists is to show how the immense problems that have been encountered in the past can be overcome. By embracing game theory, economic theorists have seemingly declined this challenge: they have abandoned generalising theories for speciﬁc games that serve as exemplars. With this statute of limitations we may move on. But our route does not at ﬁrst take us to the future. Instead, we ﬁrst turn back to nineteenth century, and move forward from there, in order to retrieve what we have lost from the past – to recover what has been long crushed and discarded by the reckless juggernaut of general theorising in social science.\n\n© 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n20\n\n2 THE PROBLEM OF HISTORICAL SPECIFICITY\n\nIt takes a great deal of history to produce a little literature. (Henry James, Hawthorne (1879))\n\nEmphatically, the argument in this book is not against the power or value of generalisation. While general theorising can never be enough, general statements are not only necessary but also unavoidable. Nor does this book underestimate the value of empirical work. The concern, however, is that both empiricism and deductive generalisation have their flaws, and some faulty presumptions are shared in common. Accordingly, any attempt to steer a middle way between these poles is likely to share the limitations of each. A more sophisticated position has to be found, recognising a signiﬁcant role for general theories but also their limitations. Some kind of middle-range theorising – to use Robert Merton’s (1968) term – is required to bridge the general with the empirical. Much valuable work in the modern social sciences is broadly of this kind. The problem, however, is that the methodological underpinnings and meta-theoretical justiﬁcations are relatively unexplored.\n\nTHE IDIOGRAPHIC AND THE NOMOTHETIC At the end of the nineteenth century, an attempt was made to resolve some of the problems raised here, by demarcating the sciences. One group of sciences was deemed to deal with universals or generalities, the rest with individuals or particulars. The German philosophers Wilhelm Windelband and Heinrich Rickert thus made a distinction between the idiographic and the nomothetic sciences. Nomothetic sciences are said to look for unifying laws. In contrast, an idiographic approach attempts to gain knowledge of concrete particulars. For Rickert (1899) the natural sciences were nomothetic. But he also placed political economy (economics) and psychology in the nomothetic group. Other social and human sciences were said to be idiographic, studying individual phenomena by empirical, descriptive and comparative methods. It was claimed that the distinction between these two groups of sciences led to very different epistemologies. © 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n21\n\nThe German philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey criticised the division of the sciences between the idiographic and the nomothetic, arguing that any science might usefully combine both methods (Holborn, 1950). Dilthey argued that the cultural and social sciences were not confined to individual cases, but included as their main problem the relationship between the individual and the general. For Dilthey, the real distinction was between the natural and the cultural sciences, and he made a sharp distinction between the two. He argued that the latter are not simply concerned with causal explanation but also with the understanding of the meanings and symbolic signiﬁcance of the subject matter. Rickert’s distinction between the idiographic and the nomothetic mirrors the modern division between the general theorists and the anti-generalising empiricists. Each reaches a stalemate. The problem, as always, is that all sciences address both the general and the speciﬁc. As the philosopher Mario Bunge (1998, p. 23) put it: ‘The nomothetic/idiographic dichotomy is untenable because all sciences are nomothetic as well as idiographic.’ Human society is ‘a patterned mess’. General frameworks of ideas may help us discern the pattern, but something more is required to deal with the messy details.\n\nTHE NEGLECTED PROBLEM We have set the stage for a methodological problem, of vital significance for the social sciences. The domination of economics and sociology by general theorists, plus a minority of atheoretical empiricists, has excluded this problem. Methodology has become unfashionable in many quarters. The methodological discussion of the general and the speciﬁc, of sameness and difference, is forgotten. I say ‘forgotten’ not ‘unexplored’. For much of the nineteenth century, economists were concerned with a central theoretical and methodological problem. It continued to be discussed by several leading economists, up until the outbreak of the Second World War. Many pages were ﬁlled with thoughts on this topic. It engaged the minds of Karl Marx, Carl Menger, Alfred Marshall, Gustav von Schmoller, Werner Sombart, Max Weber, John Commons, Frank Knight and many others. Today, however, the problem is largely ignored.1 Most social scientists are unaware of it. It is absent from the textbooks. Neither neoclassical economists nor post-Keynesians seem conscious of the problem. Although earlier theorists such as Karl Marx and John Commons addressed it, contemporary Marxists and\n\n1 A notable modern exception is Hutchison’s (1981, ch. 8) discussion of the limitations of general theories in macroeconomics. In philosophy there has been a discussion of the possibility and role of general historical explanations or laws (Hempel, 1942; Popper, 1960; Weingartner, 1961). But this earlier debate concentrated on the question of historical prediction, rather than the identiﬁcation and explanation of different historical phenomena. More recently, however, the philosophy of science has devoted substantial attention to the limits of explanatory uniﬁcation in the face of diverse (historical) phenomena (Cartwright, 1994; Dupré, 1993; Kitcher, 1989). Some of this discussion has made its way into the philosophy of economics (Boylan and O’Gorman, 1995; Mäki, 1990a, 1990b, forthcoming).\n\n© 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n22\n\ninstitutionalists give it little attention. Although Max Weber was preoccupied with the problem, it is absent within much of modern theoretical sociology, except in the shadow play of the modern discourse on ideal types. Yet for about one hundred years this issue preoccupied some of the greatest minds in the social sciences and was central to much social and economic analysis. This book is devoted to this problem. What is it? I call it the problem of historical speciﬁcity. It ﬁrst acknowledges the fact that there are different types of socio-economic system, in historical time and geographic space. The problem of historical speciﬁcity addresses the limits of explanatory uniﬁcation in social science: substantially different socio-economic phenomena may require theories that are in some respects different. If different socio-economic systems have features in common, then, to some extent, the different theories required to analyse different systems might reasonably share some common characteristics. But sometimes there will be important differences as well. Concepts and theoretical frameworks appropriate for one real object may not be best suited for another. The problem of historical specificity starts from a recognition of significant underlying differences between different objects of analysis. One theory may not ﬁt all. For instance, the socio-economic system of today is very different from the systems of ﬁve hundred, one thousand or two thousand years ago. Even today, despite having some important features in common, existing socio-economic systems in different countries are substantially different from each other in key particulars. There are important variations in the structures, rules and mechanisms of production and allocation. Individual purposes and social norms also vary, relating to differences in culture. These differences may be so substantial that they place limits on ontological explanatory unification. As a result, to some degree, different types of socio-economic system may require different conceptual and theoretical tools. A fundamentally different object of analysis may require a different theory. To repeat: any common aspects of these different theories might reasonably reflect common features of the systems involved. Historically common phenomena – such as the scarcity of physical resources – may exist. However, when we compare socio-economic systems, there are important differences as well as similarities. Arguably, the theories used to analyse them may also have to be different to a signiﬁcant degree. Many such differences cannot be captured by mere differences in parameter values. The complexity of economic phenomena suggests that much more than particular applications of a single, general theory would be required. The problem of historical specificity is concerned with the development of distinctive, particularistic theories, each applicable to a particular kind of socio-economic system. An adequate theory of (say) feudalism may not be completely adequate for (say) capitalism as well. An essentially different reality may require a substantially different theory. An adequate theory of capitalism must the address the pervasiveness of markets and employment contracts and explain the behaviour of market-oriented, proﬁt-seeking ﬁrms. However, markets and market-engaged corporations had © 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n23\n\na much less signiﬁcant role under feudalism. Accordingly, concepts that relate exclusively to the market – such as market supply, market demand and market competition – would have much less relevance for a theory of feudalism. Instead, a theory of feudalism would have to be centred on another set of essential phenomena. Other concepts, concerning the nature of feudal hierarchy and power, would assume greater relevance. Of course, there is a possibility that a theory of feudalism and a theory of capitalism may share common features and an underlying theoretical framework. The extent of this possibility is explored in part IV of this work. But it would be mistaken to assume that the common underlying framework would necessarily constitute an adequate or complete theory. The essential differences between capitalism and feudalism place limits on the scope of explanatory uniﬁcations that embrace them both. Note that there is a great deal of openness and ﬂexibility here as to what, for example, may constitute an ‘essential’ difference between one reality and another, or in what ways a theory may ‘differ’ from another. There may be different understandings of the ways in which systems ‘vary in essence’ or of what constitutes a ‘core concept’ of a theory. These questions cannot be answered without some elaboration of a methodology and a social ontology. But it is neither possible nor necessary at this initial stage to achieve absolute precision in these terms. The point being made is that there is a prima facie case to answer, covering a wide range of meanings of phrases such as ‘reality may differ in essential respects’ and ‘core concepts and categories of a theory may have to differ’. Acceptance of the prima facie case then requires us, necessarily, to try to be more precise about these statements. Indeed, much of the important detail of the debate concerns these very questions of further examination and precision. But we are unlikely to raise these questions unless we accept the prima facie case. This book is largely about raising these questions. It provides no more than a few tentative answers, principally in part IV. The whole point about the long excursion into the history of economic thought in this volume is to show how some of these questions have been raised in the past and obscured and forgotten in the present. In attempting precision and intellectual progress now, we can learn from those that have raised and debated these questions in the past. As argued in the preceding chapter, there are problems of complexity and tractability involved in formulating any general model, spanning complex and very different cases. The problem of tractability forces many theorists to make speciﬁc assumptions. As a consequence, most theorising that claims to be general is in fact specific in its scope. Furthermore, as the comparison of a barter and a monetary economy shows, a move towards seemingly greater generality can sometimes lose the emphasis on the speciﬁc connections and linkages that are important features of specific socio-economic structures. Any attempted resolution to the problem of historical speciﬁcity should address this possible trade-off between generality and engagement with speciﬁc detail. However, more accurately, the problem could be rephrased as ‘the problem of historical and geographical specificity’ as there are differences in socioeconomic systems across space as well as time. Particular kinds are not in principle restricted in space or time. It is possible – but unlikely in the social © 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n24\n\ncontext – that two instances of one kind of socio-economic system could appear in different times or places. Hence it could be rephrased as ‘the problem of speciﬁcity’. However, the phrase ‘problem of historical speciﬁcity’ is retained here because, in the historical discussions of the problem over more than a century, the consideration of differences of type has been placed principally – but not entirely – in an historical context. Nevertheless, geographical differences are as important as historical ones and the discussion in this book applies to all variations, ranged across terrain as well as time. Let T represent a theoretical analysis that is in some sense adequate and appropriate in explaining the set of socio-economic phenomena in some real domain of enquiry D. Any adequate and appropriate theory T must address underlying causal mechanisms and structures within the phenomena in D. Of course, the criteria of adequacy and appropriateness are themselves part of the problem, but we do not need to address these at this stage of the examination. D is a set of different – historically and spatially located – socio-economic phenomena that can be explained (adequately and appropriately) in terms of T. Technically, T refers to the explanantia and D the explananda. It is possible for the individual phenomena in D to be historically specific and the theoretical analysis T to be historically sensitive. To be clear: T is never a simple reﬂection of D. The construction of any T always requires a process of abstraction and simpliﬁcation, so that details closely related to D are inevitably ignored. Furthermore, there is no a priori reason why T should not also be capable of explaining some additional phenomena that are not included in the original set D. For this reason, it is not the theories, but the individual phenomena, that generally may be described as historically speciﬁc. A principal and befitting aim of science is to find T that cover as large as possible a domain D. However, the main claim being made here is that there are limits to the expansion of D as the domain of any single T. If possible, some expansion of D may occur in different ways. We may distinguish between an extensive and an intensive expansion. An extensive expansion of D typically involves the expansion of the boundaries of the set D in time or space, by introducing a greater variety of essential types of things to be explained. An intensive expansion of D involves bringing more ‘detail and outcomes’ of existing items into the set of things to be explained. The distinction between an extensive and intensive expansion would depend upon a distinction between essential phenomena, on the one hand, and more superﬁcial and detailed phenomena, on the other. Again, these terms require further clariﬁcation, and this must be attempted at some later stage. Crucially, while unification is an important goal of science, the diverse, complex and changing character of socio-economic phenomena means that reckless attempts to make T universal over all possible D may undermine the adequacy of T. By themselves, the existence of diversity and complexity do not undermine the worthiness and importance of explanatory uniﬁcation in science. Complexity and uniﬁcation can go together. But the varieties of structure and causal mechanism involved in the diversity of real phenomena may place real limits on attempts at explanatory uniﬁcation. An adequate theory T to cover an © 2001 Geoffrey M. Hodgson\n\n25\n\nextensive or universal D may be elusive. In this context, groundless attempts to pursue a general theory at all costs might abandon any focus on underlying structures and causal mechanisms. This doe"
