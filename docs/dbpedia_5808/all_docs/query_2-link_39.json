Rhenish-Westphalian furnaces have also entered this section, some with the assistance of the banks. Here, too, the activity of the coal syndicate has led to the establishment of larger and larger furnaces in combination with mines. The same tendency resulted also in the formation on October 27, 1894, of the association for the sale of Siegerland pig iron (Verein fur den Verkauf von Siegerldnder Roheisen), which in the very same year established secure relations to the Rhenish-Westphalian Pig Iron Syndicate.18 In other districts, the small blast furnaces and rolling mills were more and more consoli­ dated with the help of the banks, and transformed into “ mixed” works. The small concerns in the Sieg district which did not follow their example, and still survive as “ pure” works, are engaged in a desperate struggle for mere existence, hovering between life and death. Similar conditions are found in the Eahn and Dill district con­ sisting of parts of Upper Hessia, the administrative dis­ tricts of Wiesbaden, and the circuit of Wetzlar.1 9 The large coal production of the Aix-la-Chapelle region affords a strong basis for the iron furnaces of this region. These, however, draw part of their coal supply also from the Ruhr district. Adjoining the Aix-la-Chapelle district on the east is the Eschweiler coal district, and on the north the Wurm district, the latter, however, presenting less advantages for furnaces. The adoption of the Bessemer process at the close of the seventies led to the rapid development of the Aachener Hiltten-Aktienverein Rote Erde into a powerful “ mixed” 733 National M o n et a r y Commission steel-making establishment. On the other hand the Hoesch Iron and Steel Company of Dortmund abandoned its plants in the district almost entirely and transferred the main part of its works to Dortmund. In the same way the Phoenix made no progress with its furnace in the Aix-la-Chapelle district. Under the direction of the A. Schaaffhausen’seller Bankverein both works were amal­ gamated into one establishment in 1903.2 0 With the continuous assistance of the banks, coal mining in the Ruhr district has developed from small beginnings to a dominant industry in the Rhenish-Westphalian territory, a section well provided both with industrial establishments and banks. Here, as elsewhere, the higher prices, established by the coal and coke syndi­ cates and particularly by the Rhenish-Westphalian coal syndicate founded March 1, 1893, were the immediate occasion for the furnaces to acquire their own coal mines, a movement which won for them their increasing su­ premacy over the concerns which have remained “ pure” iron works. In 1896 the Phoenix acquired the Westende mine; the Dortmunder Union— the Adolf von Hansemann mine (Mengeder Bergwerksgesellschajt); in 1897 the Gelsenkirchener Bergwerksaktiengesellschaft, the leader of the coal syndicate, acquired the Westhausen mine; the Aktiengesellschaft Kannengiesser— the Roland mine. All these mines had been independent of the syndicate. Hoesch, Krupp, and the Rhenish Steel Works followed suit by buying up syndicate mines, a movement in which the banks were often the intermediaries. At first they attempted to secure through legal proceedings the right to divert the coal production of their newly acquired 734 The G e r m a n G r e a t B a n k s properties for their own use. When this proved inef­ fective they were soon able to secure this right by agree­ ment. The syndicate had to yield, for these works were in a position to cause it great annoyance. When the coal syndicate agreement was renewed in 1903— a result brought about largely by the activity of the banks in the open and behind the scenes— all the mines owned by the iron and steel works, except those belonging to the Government, joined the syndicate. The former, however, arranged it so that under the new agreement the syndicate provisions did not apply to their entire output but only to the portion over and above that which was consumed in their own works. On the other hand, however, the owners of the coal mines were prohibited from selling coal fields or pits to other than members of the syndicate without first securing permission from the general convention of coal mine owners. There remained, however, a point in dispute as to what should be done in the case of the sale of coal mines to fur­ nace owners, for the purpose of supplementing the inade­ quate supply of coal for use of their own furnaces. The contention of the syndicate was that in such cases the entire output of the newly purchased mines was to be subject to the regulations of the syndicate. The GermanTuxemburg Mine and Smelting Stock Company, having bought the Kaiser Friedrich mine for its own use, brought suit against the coal syndicate, and the contention of the syndicate was not upheld by the imperial supreme court. The court took the position of the company, namely, that as much of the output of the newly acquired mine as was needed by the furnace proper might be used without 735 restriction. Another case, not regulated directly, is that of a mining company erecting a furnace “ in order to find a more profitable use for its coal in the manufacture of pig iron or steel than in the sale of its product to the syndicate.” 2 1 It should be mentioned, however, that when the syndi­ cate was extended it itself included among its purposes the acquisition of coal fields and mining shares. On the other hand, the syndicate was protected against the sale of coal fields or mining shares to outsiders by the International Exploration Company, through the “ benevolent neutral­ ity ” of the A. Schaaffhausen’scher Bankverein, which con­ trolled this corporation, a policy which the bank had to adopt, on account of its relations to the companies which dominated the syndicate. There are no coal deposits of any importance in the district which are not held by the International Exploration Company, nor any sites to be had for new plants or for extensions, not even at fanciful prices. Furthermore, for a long time most of the ore has had to be imported from abroad. Here, again, the Ger­ man banks have repeatedly tried to procure for friendly industrial interests ore mines or ore deliveries at reasonable prices, as, for example, from Sweden. In the same fashion the banks were active in many ways in the consolidations, out of which sprang the great “ mixed” works that to-day dominate the Ruhr district, though some of these, such as Krupp, Bochumer Verein, Phoenix, Horder Bergwerks-und-Hiittenverein, and the Gute Hoffnungshiitte, were founded as early as the fifties. In the early seventies the Dortmunder Union, which enjoyed the patronage of the Disconto-Gesellschaft, absorbed the 736 The G e r m a n G r e a t B a n k s Heinrichshiitte and the Neu-Schottland works, which even then were mixed works. Similarly, it absorbed the Strousberg Works, in which the Disconto-Gesellschaft was likewise interested. In the same way the Westjdlische Union and the Westjalischer Drahtindustrie-Verein ab­ sorbed a number of wire works of this district. The part played by the banks in these consolidations had not been unimportant, but around the middle and toward the end of the seventies their services were called in on a much larger scale. The iron industry was then in a state of prostration, and for years not even the Phoenix and the Bochumer Union paid dividends. The Horder Verein became involved in great difficulties, and both the Gute Hoffnungshiitte and the Rheinische Stahlwerke had to resort to a heavy reduction of their capital. The Westfalische Union was saved from extinction only by the assistance of banks and a reorganization. In Upper Silesia capitalist production did not begin to make progress before the fifties, and even then its advance was slow. For the most part the land and the iron ores were in the hands of the large feudal landowners. Here Borsig was the pioneer in evolving a machine factory into enormous mixed steel works by acquiring or erect­ ing blast furnaces and rolling mills. This example was followed later by the machine factory of Hendschel & Son, in Kassel. In the seventies the Vereinigte Konigs-und Laurahutte and the Donnersmarck-Hiitte passed out of the ownership of the magnates, who continued, however, to hold by far the larger proportion of the iron furnaces and coal mines. With the aid of the banks, the newly ac­ quired furnace works were organized as stock companies. 9 0 3 1 1 ° — i i ------ 48 737 I National Monetary Commission In the same manner “ pure ” rolling mills were started, as, for instance, the Bismarckhutte. A t present the center of gravity of the industry in Upper Silesia is not in its iron production, but in its output of coal and coke.2 This is regulated by the Upper Silesian 2 Coal Convention of 1890. Of the total product approxi­ mately two-thirds is sold by two Berlin firms, Caesar Wollheim, intimately connected with the Dresdner Bank, and Emanuel Friedlander & Co., closely allied with the Berliner Handels-Gesellschaft. In this district, too, it is scarcely possible to-day to acquire coal mines or coal fields. Free competition has been well-nigh “ banished from Upper Silesia.” 2 Here 3 the mining and metallurgical concerns have always been mixed works. It is therefore only in the works recently established that the movement toward concentration and combination has been closely interwoven with the cartel movement. The concentration and cartel movements have been on a smaller scale in this region than in the Rhenish-Westphalian district, but here, too, the stimulus has come from the banks, which are behind the different establishments. Of these the Borsig Works is the only undertaking still owned privately. Of the concerns established in recent times the one deserving special mention is the Upper Silesian Iron Manufacturing Stock Company (Caro Hegenscheidt). This company developed in 1887 out of the Caro Works, and is closely related to the Berliner Handels-Gesellschaft. In 1899 it absorbed the Upper Silesian Wire Manufacturing Stock Company, from which it had hitherto been obliged to purchase 25,000 tons of pig iron. Thereafter it was 738 The G e r m a n G r e a t B a n k s able to obtain its pig iron more cheaply, for the wire com­ pany had in 1888 contracted for the entire output of the Count Henckel-Siemianowitz Works for a period of twenty years. Since 1889 the Upper Silesian Iron Manufacturing Company has been closely allied by contract with the Oberschlesische Eisenbahnbedarfs-Gesellschaft (Upper Sile­ sian Railroad Equipment Company), which is on intimate terms with the Breslauer Disconto-Bank, and through it with the Darmstadter Bank. This equipment company (the so-called Oberbedarfs-Gesellschaft) in turn united in 1904 with the Huldchinsky furnaces. To all appearances the alliance was made for purely business and technical reasons, and did not call for any significant help from the banks. Similar business policies and technical reasons seem to have been the determining factors in bringing about the community of interest in 1903 between the Bismarckhiitte and the Upper Silesian Iron Manufacturing Company, extended in 1904 so as to include the Donnersmarck Bethlen-Falva Hiitte. The same may be said of the community of interest founded in 1904 between the Konigs-und Eaurahiitte (with which are affiliated the banking house of S. Bleichroder and the Dresdner Bank), the Upper Silesian Railway Equipment Company (Friedenshutte) (closely related to the Breslauer Disconto-Bank and the Darmstadter Bank), and the Kattowitzer (Tiele-Winckler'sche) Aktiengesellschajt fur Bergbau- und Hilttenbetrieb (Marthahiitte). In such cases the services of the friendly banks often take but the form of removing obstacles and hindrances, or refrain­ ing from interference when the interests of other clients might call for such interference. 739 N a t io n a l M on e t a r y Commission Occurrences of this kind are, however, to be regarded as exceptional. Moreover, it is not a matter of chance that they have happened in the district of Upper Silesia. For here there was little room for banks or their initiative and assistance, for the reason that the land, the coal mines, and the ore rights were in the hands of feudal owners, and that from early times mixed works predominated. The conditions in the Saar district are similar. There the family ownership of the iron furnaces by the Stumm, the de Wendel, and the Rochling families held back bank domination, which usually asserts itself in connection with stock companies. Furthermore, here the Govern­ ment was in control of the coal, and the entire district gradually became dependent on Lorraine for its coke and ore. More and more it is becoming clear, in all essentials, that the fate of the mining and metallurgical industries as a whole will be decided not in Upper Silesia or on the, Saar, but in the two districts in which primarily the great banks are contending .for financial control— the Rhenish-West­ phalian and the Uorraine-Luxemburg districts. Between the latter and the former there are close connections. Largely through the help of the banks the LorraineLuxemburg district has recently attained a position of more dominating importance, its extensive ownership of mines in the Ruhr section giving it large influence also in the Rhenish-Westphalian territory. In the main it was the mixed iron works of the two districts which were able to impose their will upon and have their interests taken care of by a syndicate primarily devoted to the interests of coal at the time when the second coal syndicate was formed (in September, 1903). Coal had to yield to iron. 740 The G e r m a n G r e a t B a n k s These two districts, which may be regarded the cap­ ital seats of the mining and iron industries, witness at present the great struggle for industrial supremacy between the leading mining concerns and for financial supremacy between the leading banks. It is highly interesting to watch the turns in this battle, the numer­ ous ups and downs, surprises, and combinations which present themselves in varied and exciting array to the attentive observer as the contending parties maneuver and clash in the combat. There is no lack of either large and comprehensive plans or of scenes of petty jealousy in these campaigns. Here a great part is played by two captains of industry whose power is constantly growing in the two opposing camps contending for mas­ tery— August Thyssen, of the firm of Thyssen & Co., in Mulheim on-the-Rhine, and Hugo Stinnes, of the firm of Mathias Stinnes, of Mulheim on-the-Rhine. Thus far both have, as far as possible, pursued the policy of maintaining the friendliest relations with a number of banks without wedding themselves to any one. It is not, however, the first time that such captains of industry have played the leading role in the indus­ trial evolution of Germany. One need only recall the names of Strousberg and Friedrich Grillo, whose enter­ prises either failed or were dispersed on their death and were liquidated or sold by the Disconto-Gesellschaft. Part of the Grillo works passed into the hands of August Thyssen, of whom we shall have more to say here. The modest steel and rolling mill of Thyssen & Co., in Mulheim on-the-Rhine, founded in the early seventies, has gradually grown into the very important Thomas and Martin Steel 741 r T \" ''' National Monetary Commission and Rolling Mills of that firm. It annexed first the Gewerkschajt Deutscher Kaiser, a mine and furnace company in Bruckhausen-Hamborn, and developed it into powerful mixed steel works especially noteworthy for its highly effi­ cient blast furnaces. In 1903 the latter works joined the Rhenish-Westphalian Pig Iron Syndicate. The two es­ tablishments employ more than 17,000 men and insure Thyssen an important place both in the pig iron syn­ dicate and in the Steel Works Union. Thyssen has also a controlling interest in the Schalker Gruben-und Huttenverein, which owns large coal mines and blast furnaces and operates the largest iron foundry in ex­ istence in Germany. He also controls the Victor Mining Company, which was organized by the former concern. In Lorraine he owns the Minette mines and holds a con­ siderable interest in the mixed steel works of the Sambre et Moselle Mining Corporation. In the coal territory his control is even wider than in the iron region. This is due as much to the extensive coal properties of the Gewerkschaft Deutscher Kaiser as to his large interests in the Mulheim Coal Company which is jointly controlled by him and Stinnes. With Stinnes he shares also in the control of the Friedlicher Nachbar Mining Company. Early in 1904 he joined the supervisory board of the Gelsenkirchner Bergwerksgesellschaft, the coal properties of which adjoin those of the Schalker Gruben-und Hiittenverein, having acquired a large part, perhaps a majority, of the shares of that company, either individually or through the Miilheimer Bergwerksverein (3,000,000 marks). Finally, in 1903, he acquired the development company Bohrge742 The G e r m a n G r e a t B a n k s sellschaft Lippermulde and thereby extended and rounded out his coal properties, until they reached on the east of the Rhine as far as the government mines and on the south as far as the properties of the Gewerkschajt Deutscher Kaiser and Gute-Hoffnungshutte. After the pur­ chase of the development company Tiefbohrgesellschaft Lubisch his holdings extended east of the Rhine as far north as the Dutch border. His present ownership of coal properties is about twice as large as that of the Government in the same region. While Stinnes is closely allied with Thyssen, as is evident from the above, and owns jointly with him the Mulheimer and the Sambre et Mosselle mining compa­ nies, he owns also in his own right the coal mines Ma­ thias Stinnes, Victoria Mathias, Graf Beust, Carolus Magnus, Friedrich, and Ernestine. He owned also the Friedlicher Nachbar mine (transferred in 1904 to the Deutsch-Luxemburgische Bergwerks-und Hiittenaktiengesellschaft). In the southern part of the Ruhr district he is almost in sole control; in the rest of this territory he shares control with Thyssen. Stinnes likewise joined the supervisory board of the Gelsenkirchener Bergwerksgesellschaft. In addition he is on the board of the Nordstern and of the Mittelrheinische Bank in Koblenz and Duisburg. The latter is closely related to Spaeter & Co., in Koblenz. The supremacy of Thyssen and Stinnes in the Ruhr district is disputed in the main only by the Haniel family and by Karl Funke, of Essen. The Haniel family owns the Rheinpreussen Mines and the Gute Hoffnungs Mines, adjoining the Thyssen coal mines. Karl Funke owns the 743 t N at ion a l M on e t a r y Commission Konig Ludwig mines. The Haniel family is allied with the Duisburg-Ruhrorter Bank, and Funke with the Essener Bankverein. As both of these banks have communities of interest with the Deutsche Bank, both Haniel and Funke are now in close touch with the Deutsche Bank. Stinnes’s relations with the firm of Spaeter & Co., of Koblenz, are particularly close through their common shipping interests on the Rhine, both of them being large river carriers of coal. In some cases both Thyssen and Stinnes have been fighting the syndicates. In the majority of cases, how­ ever, their attitude toward them was more friendly, resembling their attitude toward the banks, maintained successfully for a number of years. From the beginning the Schalker Gruben-und Hiittenverein controlled by Thyssen, was a member of the Rhenish-Westphalian Pig Iron Syndicate, while his Gewerkschaft Deutscher Kaiser with its blast furnaces did not join this syndicate until 1903. The Schalker Verein with its Pluto mines, and its subsidiary company Victor, as well as the Mulheimer Bergwerksverein, in which Stinnes was also interested, were members of the coal syndicate, while at the same time Thyssen’s Deut­ scher Kaiser mines were most active in fighting the syndicate. Stinnes, on the contrary, joined the coal syndicate with nearly all his mines. However, he kept outside of the syndicate his Friedlicher Nachbar mines. The intoler­ able conditions thus produced have, however, in the main, been ended by the syndicate regulations. 744 The G e r m a n G r e a t B a n k s Their relations to the banks we have characterized before. Thus Thyssen was at first on close terms with the Disconto-Gesellschaft. Particularly in the eighties and nineties it was this bank which floated the securities of the Schalker Gruben- und Hiittenverein and of the Gewerkschajt Deutscher Kaiser. Later his relations be­ came intimate with the Dresdner Bank, after it had reorganized in 1902 and entered into a community of interest with the Rheinische Bank in Miilheim, an insti­ tution with which Thyssen was affiliated. Hugo Stinnes had some relations with the Dresdner Bank, having participated with it in the reorganization of the Saar- und Moselle Mining Company. He estab­ lished relations also with the A. Schaaffhausen’scher Bankverein, after the latter had founded a community of in­ terest with the Mittelrheinische Bank in Koblenz, of which Stinnes was a board member. In 1901 Stinnes established relations also with the Darmstadter Bank, when he became vice-president of the board of the Deutsch-Luxemburgische Bergwerks- und Hutten-AktienGesellschaft, which owes its financial strength and high technical standing to the Darmstadter Bank. The con­ cern combined both mining and smelting operations after the acquisition in 1904 of the Stinnes mines, Friedlicher Nachbar. On January 1, 1905, a community of interest was entered into between the Gelsenkirchener BergwerksAktiengesellschaft, the Aachener Hiittenverein Rote Erde and the Thyssen concern Schalker Gruben- und Hiittenverein. By this step a group of competing banks, viz, 745 N ational M on et a r y Commission the Disconto-Gesellschaft, the Deutsche Bank, the Dresdner Bank and the A. Schaaffhausen’scher Bankverein were brought together in a joint undertaking, This event served also to enhance the power of Hugo Stinnes and August Thyssen, who became members of the “ joint committee” of this community of interests. This combination seems to have brought about some sort of equilibrium in the Rhenish-Westphalian indus­ trial territory, and simplified certain complex relation­ ships in the banking and industrial field. On the other hand, there are already evident the beginnings of new conflicts in another field. As we saw, the Lorraine-Tuxemburg iron industry has in recent times been coming to the front more and more and is beginning to overshadow even the Rhenish-West­ phalian industry. One reason of this development is the far lower cost at which it can produce pig iron as com­ pared with the Rhenish-Westphalian district. Another reason is that owing to the electrical process recently introduced in the manufacture of steel the value of Luxemburg-Lorraine ores, which formerly were hard to work, because they were rich in phosphorus, has been greatly enhanced. These can be utilized most cheaply and advantageously by the works located close to the ore beds.2 The quantity of such ore is estimated at about 4 2,000,000,000 tons. Realizing that a serious movement of the German pig iron industry toward the southwest has set in, the leading captains of industry and the leading banks alike have felt obliged to increase their influence in the LorraineLuxemburg region. 74 6 The G e r m a n G r e a t B a n k s In this territory the position of the firm,Spaeter & Co., in Koblenz, is very powerful. It is the founder of the Rombacher Hilttenwerke, which have bought up the Moselhuttenwerke and dominate the blast furnaces in Rodingen, Rumelingen, and the Eisenhiittenaktienverein Diidelingen. In this district Thyssen has thus far gained a foothold practically only through his interest in the Hiittenverein Sambre et Moselle, while Stinnes’s hold in this territory is only through his membership in the Supervisory board of what is now a very important company— the DeutschLuxemburgische Bergwerks- und Hutten-Aktiengesellschaft, and his rather unimportant connection with Spaeter & Co.2 5 As recently as April, 1909, a step was taken which is certain to affect deeply the relations of the different industrial groups and their relative positions. In all likelihood it will also exert a powerful influence on the relations of the different bank groups which are dependent on these industrial groupings, and on the general movement toward concentration. An enormous increase was made in the capitalization of the Gelsenkirchener BergwerksGesellschaft. Its capital stock was increased by 26.000. 000 marks to a nominal amount of 156,000,000 marks, and its bonded debt by 20,000,000 marks to 70.000.000 marks. The latter increase was made in spite of the fact that there was still available an unissued amount of 9,325,000 marks in 4 per cent bonds authorized in 1906. This move attracted attention not only by the size of the capital increase but also because it was made at a time of money stringency and unfavorable market condi­ tions. The company justified this step on the ground that 747 % National Monetary Commission the additional resources were indispensable for the erection of new blast furnaces and steel works in Esch and in Deutsch-Oth. It was also given out officially that the measure was necessary to insure an “ adequate position” for the company in case the Steel Works’ Union, which ter.minates June 30, 1912, were not renewed. Doubtless this had reference to an increase of its quota in the syndi­ cate. The Gelsenkirchener Bergwerksgesellschaft had originally been a producer of coal and coke only. After it had entered into a community of interest with the Rote Erde and the Schalke Works it became also a pro­ ducer of pig iron, steel, semimanufactures of iron and steel, beams and rails, but it nevertheless continued to hold the largest production quota in the coal syndicate. Through its action of April, 1909, however, it entirely shifted its center of gravity away from the production of coal to that of iron and steel. This step was in keeping with the movement of the iron industry to the southwest. The new resources were to be expended for the purpose of operating its steel and rolling mills in combination with its blast furnaces, where conditions made possible the cheapest cost of production, i. e., in the heart of the Lorraine-Luxemburg Minette district, where it owned extensive ore beds. Through this action, however, the Gelsenkirchener Bergwerksgesellschaft became a direct competitor of August Thyssen, who had been a member of its board. He at once accepted the logical consequence of the situa­ tion and resigned from the board. Earlier he had with­ drawn also from the board of the Phoenix. The Thyssen 748 Th e G e r m a n G r e a t B a n k s concern Deutscher Kaiser owns very important ore rights in the Lorraine-Luxemburg district, and he himself, as was shown above,is interested in the Saar-und Moselbergwerksgesellschaft in Karlingen. Moreover, early in 1909 he invested several million marks in land in this section and acquired the oatent rights to produce electro-steel in all his works. In the near future the struggle for supremacy is likely to be fought out in the Lorraine-Luxemburg district. The trial of strength between the leading interests will come as soon as negotiations begin with a view to renew­ ing the Steel Works’ Union at the expiration of the pres­ ent agreement. The progress of the conflict and its outcome and the industrial concentration that is likely to precede or follow it will undoubtedly be influenced by the banks and groups of banks that stand back of the captains of industry and their enterprises. This influence may indeed not be de­ cisive, but it is likely to be in the direction of new com­ binations and the avoidance of further conflicts which must prove harmful to all. So far as we can foresee, the important part will be taken by those banks which now possess, or by that time will have attained, a controlling influence over the industrial concerns which dominate the Lorraine-Luxemburg district. It will be of the utmost interest to watch further developments. These will reveal many different combinations and changes in indus­ trial and banking concentration, and new group align­ ments in both fields. 749 » National Monetary III. T he I nfluence centration on of I ndustry Commission and Concentration I ndustrial Con­ in B anking . A detailed account of the tremendous effects which industrial development and concentration have exerted on the growth of the great banks and on concentration in banking would involve a repetition of practically every­ thing discussed in previous chapters of this book. At every step in the development of the banks and at every stage of their growth the mighty influence of industrial progress may be seen. We showed this connection par­ ticularly in discussing the current business of the banks as well as their activity in the field of floating securities, forming new corporations, and converting firms into corporations. This influence is equally apparent in the activities of the banks both at home and abroad. The far-reaching influence of the cartel movement in industry and of the national export policy on the extent and the rapidity of the movement of concentration in banking, also the ways in which concentration in banking was brought about and the forms it assumed, have been shown in great detail. The reader is therefore referred to the previous chapters for an account of these subjects. 75 ° PART VI. THE SITUATION RESULTING FROM CONCENTRATION; ADVANTAGES AND DAN­ GERS OF CONCENTRATION— THE OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE. By far the most serviceable of the tools employed by modern capitalism have been first the machine and second the corporation. Machinery made possible the elimina­ tion of the personal element of labor and the utmost con­ centration of mechanical forces. The corporation elimi­ nated the personal element of the entrepreneur, and led to the utmost concentration of the forces of capital. The cooperation of these two factors, i. e., machine pro­ duction and the corporation, has made possible the culmination of capitalist development in the shape of cen­ tralized management of combined forces and enterprises. The abundance and variety of detail revealed in the history of the development of concentration may, on superficial observation, fill one with dismay. On closer inspection we find, however, that the successive stages of this development are subject to remarkable regularity, partaking almost of the character of natural law. At first sight there is a confused mass of complicated events, so intricately interlaced that it seems impossible to grasp them in their entirety. Upon closer examination three stages of development become discernible. In the first stage we find a large number of weak, independent enterprises, incapable of much resistance. In the second stage we notice the transition to a large number of far 7Si National Monetary Commission more complicated enterprises, better organized and capable of greater resistance. In the third stage we have the situation again simplified by the formation of a small number of powerful groups of enterprises. In the economic struggle for existence, as shown in the movement toward industrial concentration, we see first a large number of weak individual establishments. Out of these by a thousand devices and in seemingly roundabout ways, and through as many types and forms, there emerges gradually the fewest practicable number of strong and unified groups of enterprises, i. e., increasingly simple industrial formations. This process of evolution can be traced in every domain of industry. In the most modern of industries, the electrical industry, the process is revealed most clearly. At the outset numerous companies wrere organ­ ized in feverish haste. By 1900, as we saw (p. 715 et seq.), there had developed out of them seven groups, which dominated the field, comprising in all 28 allied companies. After some of these groups had lost much of their power and others had been absorbed, two groups remained more powerful than the others— the Siemens-Schuckert group and the General Electric (A. E. G.). From present indi­ cations these will be able to ally with themselves the re­ maining groups or companies either through price agree­ ments or by more efficient means. They will also be in a position to hold in check international competition by means of mutual understandings, the beginnings of which may be seen even at present. In the chemical industry we see the same development. There is on the one side the union of the Hochst Dye 75 2 The G e r m a n G r e a t B a n k s Works and the firm of Leopold Cassella & Co. in the form of a community of interest, and on the other a similar community of interest among the Badische Anilin-und Sodafabrik, the dye works formerly Friedrich Bayer & Co., and the Aktiengesellschaft fiir Anilinfabrikation. These are in a position to bring about a consolidation of all the remaining dye works, as far as it may become neces­ sary, and to enable the German aniline dye industry to meet successfully foreign competition. In the mining and metallurgical industry a light has ap­ peared in the darkness of the “ cartel chaos” since the organization of the Steel Works’ Union. The latter com­ bines establishments engaged in every stage of the process of production. It is, therefore, in a better position to carry out a sound cartel policy at home and to arrange for the elimination of international competition by bringing about agreements for a division of the export trade to im­ portant foreign markets among the competing countries on the basis of the amount of their past sales in these markets. Meanwhile, more rapidly than ever, there is going on in the mining and iron industries a movement of concentration and consolidation among the different groups of enterprises, and in this process the weaker and smaller establishments are being absorbed or eliminated. The shipping industry is dominated by two companies, the Hamburg-American Packet Line Company and the North German Lloyd. These are united by agreement between themselves and also with a British - American combination. Finally, in banking, out of a large number of independ­ ent banks, there have been developed five powerful groups, 903 i i °— i i ------49 \"I 753 National Monetary Commission comprising, in all, 41 “ concern” banks (Konzernbankeri). In this field, however, the process of concentration has byno means yet ended. It will, in all probability, not stop until it has come nearer its goal than to-day, by develop­ ing the smallest number of bank groups practicable, each embracing the largest possible number of “ concern” banks, under centralized management. Until the groups of banks shall have reached a point of fairly equal strength, so that each one will respect the other’s domain, we can not look to a halt in the movement of concentration. However, even now it is possible to realize many of its advantages and dangers. To begin with the advantages of concentration. Un­ questionably the business policy of a great bank, and not­ ably of one standing at the head of a chain of banks (Konzernbanken) , can and will be carried out more in accordance with a uniform program, which takes into account the gen­ eral economic interests including those of the nation and of the Government. Such a business policy can be pursued by it much more readily than by a moderate-size or small bank or by a large number of small scattered banks, which are compelled by the increasing struggle for existence to shape their policy merely with a view to dividends. E x­ perience has taught that the great German banks realized the necessity of supporting a vigorous policy in encourag­ ing the exports of manufactures (see p. 527 et seq.). They accepted the logical demands of the situation and acted accordingly, as shown by their attitude toward industry and the export trade, the investment of German capital in foreign commercial and industrial enterprises and securi­ ties1, and in promoting actively the national policies in 754 The G e r m a n G r e a t B a n k s regard to shipping, colonies, the building of canals, and the laying of cables. Neither will it be denied that the administration of the great German banks is far more subject to control by the special press and the public than a large number of isolated small or moderately large banks. Furthermore, it is clear that powerful banks and groups of banks of this kind, under centralized control, can serve the German Em­ pire as one of its most potent agencies in both its economic and world policies. This is true, at least so long as the leaders of the banks continue, as they have done, to regard their duty to the state as one of their important obligations. The Government and its various organs, moreover,regard it as a great help to carry on negotiations with a few great banks, having their center in Berlin, when it is a question of measures the execution of which is to be intrusted to private capital, or such as require haste or confidential treatment, or, as in the case of cable lines or colonial en­ terprises, such as necessitate the tying up of large amounts of capital for a considerable period. Greater concentration of banking capital facilitates a more elastic extension of credit by eliminating to a large extent reckless granting of credit, on the one hand, and “ panic sales’’ (Angstverkaufe), on the other. Through their better knowledge of the general economic and financial situation the great banks are often able to prognosticate the approach of industrial, commercial, and bourse crises. While powerless to ward off such crises, they may, by timely warnings and preventive measures, lessen the effects and duration of the calamity. Concentration of banking carries with it also the 755 National Monetary Commission extension of check, giro, and clearing operations— i. i., those factors which lessen the need of cash for payments, and thus broaden the basis for credit transactions. In turn, concentration results in a number of important advantages to the private economic interests of the banks. This is true alike of that form of concentration which is attained through control of other enterprises or the creation of communities of interest (through the acqui­ sition of stock, the establishment of subsidiary companies, and trust companies, through agreement or the inter­ change of stock), as of the other form attained by means of decentralization of operations through the establishment of commandites, branches, agencies, and deposit offices. All these, forms of concentration of capital and power secure to the central institution a more complete view of the general industrial situation and of the varying needs and conditions in the different branches of industry, and a detailed knowledge of the financial standing of a large number of clients, their trustworthiness in general, and with regard to credit in particular. This information is based on the objective expert advices of reporting agen­ cies which are thoroughly familiar with local conditions and, on the other hand, intimately related to the central institution and acting in its interests. From such a com­ prehensive and accurate survey of the general situation and the detailed information, the central institution derives in an ever-increasing manner the following advantages: (a) It is able to find a wider and safer market for the sale of securities which it proposes to float. It can, there­ fore, acquire such securities on a larger scale and with greater confidence, knowing beforehand that such securi­ ties will go into good hands as permanent investments, 756 The G e r m a n G r e a t B a n k s and not be thrown back at once upon the market, to be taken up again by the bank. (6) Its current banking business is extended. This extension usually means increased dividends. This leads to the enhancing of its own credit both at home and abroad, particularly of its acceptance credit. It also means greater power of intervention in critical times and larger freedom of action in the money market. (c) Its deposit business is increased in proportion as those of its clients, who belong to the class of small capi­ talists and tradesmen, are becoming accustomed to leave on deposit with the bank even small amounts of available funds to be applied to productive uses. In this way a stimulus is afforded to such clients to save and accumulate reserves— which is highly desirable from the point of view of business— and to turn over to the bank the receiv­ ing and making of payments on their account (geordnete Kassenfilhrung). The effect of this development is an improvement of conditions attending settlements by the more extensive and intensive use of checks. Credit transactions are facilitated, the circulation of cash is diminished, the bank’s freedom of action is increased, and its dividends become more stable. (d) The bank is enabled to furnish its clients with reliable information and to help them in every way in their business undertakings, especially with regard to bills, foreign exchange, and payments. As against these advantages, the movement of concentra­ tion in Germany2 has thus far not brought with it a reduc­ tion of the cost of conducting business or of the expenses of administration, such as was often the case when foreign trusts and analogous combinations were formed. 757 National Monetary Commission One reason for this lies in the fact that, unlike the situation produced where trusts were formed, the inde­ pendence of the original establishments was maintained, except in case of mergers. As a result, there could hardly be any saving in the cost of operation or administration. On the contrary, we were able to show (on p. 467 et seq.) that as a general rule both the absolute amounts of expenses of operation and the percentage of expenses to gross profits have steadily risen among the banks that have been in the forefront in the movement toward concentration.3 Jorgens has pointed out the increase in taxes, due to the per­ manent ownership of stock in one corporation by another.4 Attention has also been called to the various dangers arising from concentration in banking. With reference to this subject the following points may be made: Thus far there has been no manifestation of a monopolistic ten­ dency, as regards the treatment of the public in the so-called current business, and this in spite of what would seem to be the natural tendency in view of the extent to which concentration has gone. On the contrary, in their competi­ tion the banks have undertaken the greatest services and responsibilities for the lowest commissions ever known in German banking, commissions so slight as to fall below the point of fair remuneration. On the other hand, there are unmistakable signs of such tendencies in the com­ petitive struggle against private bankers; also within the domain of underwriting and of tenders for the taking over of public loans or of securities of public or private under­ takings. As we saw before (p. 407 et seq.), outside compe­ tition in this field may occasionally underbid the tenders of large banks or groups of banks, but must fail in the long 758 The G e r m a n G r e a t B a n k s run unless it is in a position to offer the same security for making payment, for taking over the securities, or for carry­ ing out the undertaking. Many of the syndicates in this field have been in the nature of price conventions and have often assumed a monopolistic character. It is, furthermore, undeniable that concentration in German banking has been accompanied by marked injury to the sound and vigorous elements among the class of the smaller private bankers. I am convinced that even to­ day, as I shall show further on, this class performs eco­ nomically useful and even necessary functions, and that the decline of the private banker class represents one of the dark sides of the progress of concentration. As we saw (p. 618 et seq.), the decline of this class was hastened and intensified by faulty stock exchange and stamp-tax legislation; essentially, however, it was due to the movement of concentration. It may, indeed, be said that the decline of private bank­ ing, which showed itself in very acute form before the passing of the supplementary bourse act, is only one phase of the modern struggle for existence, which had its origin in the capitalist system, and will come to an end only with the triumph of large-scale enterprise and concentration. It is part of the same conflict in which, it seems, the small farmer and the small miller are succumbing before the large landowner and large miller, the craftsmen and the home in­ dustries before the factory, the retail store before the large dealer and particularly before the department store. How­ ever, in the other branches of industrial life it has been policy to protect the middle class in every possible way the and to prevent its decline. Where this was manifestly 75 9 t N at ion a l M o n et a r y Commission unavoidable, the effort has been to retard it and to miti­ gate its effects, so as to allow those injured gradually to change their economic position and to prepare them to face the new problems presented by the altered situation. In the attitude taken toward the middle class and small banker an opposite policy was apparently followed both in the various provisions of the bank-deposit law and in the stock exchange and the imperial stamp-tax legislation. (See p. 618 et seq.) As a result of these measures the rapidity of the concentration movement was greatly enhanced and the situation resulting from this tendency was made much harder for the private banker. What is even worse, the vitality of this class was regrettably low­ ered. There seems, however, to be no good reason why the decline of private banking should have been permitted to assume the proportions that it really did. There are to-day, as much as ever, certain necessary and legitimate economic functions for the smaller banker, and there is still a broad field of profitable activity open to him.5 The situation here is similar to that among the handicrafts, where the reasons for the decay are similar.6 The latter can maintain themselves where the bond between producer and consumer is not dis­ solved and where local or individual adaptation is still necessary.7 In the same way the small banker can hope to compete successfully wherever he may operate, if he will adopt from the outset as his motto in business specialization and adaptation to local conditions and needs. He has here an advantage over the decentralized banks in the fact that his expenses of operation are rela­ tively smaller. Such specialization has already set in 760 The G e r m a n G r e a t B a n k s in several fields, although it is not of a kind altogether desirable, in case, for instance, the smaller bankers devote themselves particularly to the purchase and sale of mining stocks or unlisted securities. The primary and normal function of the small banker will always continue to be that of adviser to the large public in their financial affairs in general, and more par­ ticularly in the matter of investments. This, of course, presupposes that he will continue to give the necessary time and study to this function. In his capacity of gen­ eral adviser he may be able to carry on dealings in securi­ ties for customers’ account, where the latter give special security, in accordance with the provisions of the stockexchange law. On the other hand, in view of the low commissions and the taxes imposed on the contango business, it would be better policy for the small bankers to engage less in security business on own account, to which they seem to have been giving special attention during recent years. Knowing intimately the personal standing of his clients, the smaller banker will always be professionally best fitted to foster personal credit, and more particularly blank credit a field of banking that calls for specialization, based on knowledge of individual conditions. Where there are no deposit offices or general banks, the smaller banker is in a position to carry on success­ fully also a general banking business with the smaller tradesmen, extending to them the facilities of check accounts, current accounts, and bill discounting. On the bourse his legitimate functions are trading in unlisted securities (Kulisse), the arbitrage business, and 761 National Monetary Commission profiting by the fluctuation of daily quotations on the different exchanges whenever bid and ask prices do not accord. He is in a position best to understand the needs of small manufacturers and to know thoroughly the intrinsic value of solid securities, both stocks and bonds, issued by them, and to find a wide market for them. Under this head belong also debentures of smaller industrial estab­ lishments, which, while of undoubted solidity, are issued in amounts too small to be listed on German exchanges (in case the amount is less than 1,000,000 or 500,000 marks, respectively).8 On the other hand the recent practice, due to the faults of the stock exchange legislation, of the smaller banker assuming the functions of industrial entrepreneur by means of permanent acquisitions on a large scale of stock or of other participations, seems to us of rather doubtful wisdom. Finally there is no reason why the development toward more powerful enterprises in the shape of joint-stock or limited liability companies, large beginnings of which may be seen even at present by cooperation with the great banks, and even independently of them, should not prove successful on an equally large scale in the case of other provincial banking concerns either singly or in combina­ tion with others of the same class. A few recent examples of this development are the following: Thus with the assistance of the Hannoversche Bank and its subsidiaries, the Osnabriicker and Hildesheimer banks, the private banking firm of Ludwig Peters Nachfolger was transformed in 1905 into the Braunschweiger Privatbank •4 762 The G e r m a n G r e a t B a n k s Aktiengesellschaft (with a total capital of 6,000,000 marks). In the same way, with the cooperation of the DiscontoGesellschaft and the Berliner Handels-Gesellschaft, the banking firm of Peris & Co. in Breslau was transformed into the Schlesische Handelsbank Aktiengesellschaft, Bres­ lau, which in 1909 opened in turn a branch in Beuthen and one in Striegau. In 1906 the banking house Johann Ohligschlaeger of Aix-la-Chapelle, of the Rheinisch-Westfalische Disconto-Gesellschaft group, was converted into a limited liability association, with a capital of 5,500,000 marks. In 1908 the banking house of Doertenbach & Co., Stuttgart, was changed to a limited liability association with a capital of 4,000,000 marks. In 1908 the Hessischer Bankverein Aktiengesellschaft in Kassel was organized through the merger of the banking firm of Leopold Plaut & Co., of Kassel, and J. C. Plaut & Co. in Eschwege. In 1907 the Berlin banking firm Carl Neuburger was transformed into a stock company en commandite, and by the end of 1908 the latter had established eight branches m different localities besides five deposit offices. In addition it had absorbed two banking firms (C. Fahndrich & Co. in Fiirstenwalde and the Westfalische Bank M. Hirschfeld in Iserlohn). Early in 1909 it added a branch in Deutsch-Krone. I he banking house of L. & E. Wertheimber, of Frankforton the Main, adopted an original procedure. It founded a separate enterprise under the name of Bank- und Wechselstuben-Gesellschaft m. b. H ., to operate exchange offices in Frankfort. The entire capital stock of the con­ cern, 2,000,000 marks, was retained by the banking house of L. & E. Wertheimber, which continued operations as before. 76 3 National Monetary Commission Finally there is no doubt that what has been done successfully in other countries is also possible in Ger­ many (9 viz: To unite smaller bankers into syndicates ), or groups which will act not only without any antagonism toward the great banks, but rather enter into definite agreements and thus act in concert with them. The future activity of private bankers in receiving deposits is indeed threatened by the voluntary publica­ tion of periodic financial statements by the joint-stock banks since 1909. In order to save this branch of business for the private banker, we might well resort to the joint liability idea of the Roman societas argentariorum, i. e., bankers’ associations with unlimited liability, adapting, of course, the principle to present day conditions.® So much for the effect of concentration on the smaller banker. We have repeatedly called attention to certain disad­ vantages of concentration for the central banks. There is on the one hand danger that their ability to maintain their assets in liquid form may be impaired particularly at critical times by excessive demands for credit and funds, on the part of subsidiary companies, trust companies, branches, commandites, agencies, and institutions joined with them in a community of interest. It was also pointed out that it is becoming increasingly more difficult for the central banks to control the proper use of their credit and funds. As we saw, with the progress of concentration the condition of the banks from the point of view of the liquidity of their assets has steadily grown worse to an extent that can no “ There are some indications that since the enactm ent of the supple­ mentary bourse law (May 8, 1908) an improvement in the condition of private banking has set in, which finds expression also in a considerable increase in the number of n ew ly founded private banking firms. 764 The G e r m a n G r e a t B a n k s longer be lightly passed over. Unless an improvement is brought about by natural causes or by criticism either from within or by the general public, a situation might be created in which the banks’ freedom of action would be impaired in critical periods, particularly in the event of war, and the institutions placed in a perilous condition at a most critical moment. Public attention has been drawn to this situation particularly since 1908, when the great banks of their own accord began the publication of bi­ monthly financial statements which indicate but a slow improvement in this regard. Furthermore, it must be admitted that with the growth and decentralization of the operations of the great banks and their groups it becomes increasingly difficult to gain an adequate com­ prehension of the financial reports and balance sheets issued, as these no longer represent a clear and full picture of the condition of the banks. The effects of concentration on the bank employees may be summed up as follows: It goes without saying that in the course of the concentration movement both the abso­ lute number of employees in the large banks as well as their proportion to those in the smaller establishments has increased greatly— a tendency which is, however, common to other branches of business. According to the census of 1882, there were 28 banks employing 50 or more persons, with a total number of 2,697 employed by them. Thir­ teen years later the census of 1895 showed 66 banks em­ ploying each 50 or more persons, with a total force of 7,802. In the thirteen years the number of employees in the large banks had increased 189.3 Per cent. On the other hand the number employed in banking establishments 765 with less than 5 employees had increased only 59.9 per cent, and in middle-sized institutions, with 6 to 50 employees, only 34.5 per cent.1 0 The data of the 1907 census are not yet available on this point, but it is probable that the number employed in the large banks in 1907 represented one-third of all gainfully employed in “ financial and credit’’ institutions, while in 1895 this number still constituted but a little over onefifth (21.60 per cent), and in 1882 only a little over onetenth (11.8 per cent) of the persons so employed. From these figures we may conclude that with the progress of concentration there has been a great increase in the number of persons who have but slight prospects of ever being able to start an independent banking business of their own. With the increasing domination of banks with huge capital on the one hand and the diminishing power and sphere of activity of the private banker, the opportunities of building up a private banking business have now become considerably smaller. In many respects the standing of the bank employee, as such, has not improved with the growth of concentration. This is true particularly of his position within the bank. The number of employees in the large banks is steadily growing. Thus, for instance, at the close of 1908 the Deutsche Bank had a force of 4,860 as compared with 4,439 at the end of 1907. As the number of bank clerks increases and the bank’s duties become more manifold, there is naturally introduced a greater specialization in the work of each employee. As a result there is no chance for a rounded development or a general training in the pro­ fession. This involves a twofold danger. The situation Th e G e r m a n G r e a t B a n k s may result in a gradual loss of interest in the work, and may also rob the employee of the broader view of things which in turn makes it harder for him to enter another department or profession. It is only a relatively small number of banks which have introduced a periodic change of work for their employees, a practice highly desirable not only in the interest of the employees, but also of the banks themselves. Furthermore, whenever an employee is discharged it is harder for him to find employment in another bank, particularly in one of the ever-increasing number be­ longing to the same group. This is in the nature of things, and not due to any mutual agreement among the banks. This does not apply, however, to the free­ dom of bank officials of voluntarily changing employ­ ment from one bank to another. After the removal of temporary doubts and objections this freedom has been generally conceded, though even at present it is subject to certain limitations in the interests of both parties. It was feared that the numerous bank mergers and absorptions of private banks would make it possible to dispense with the services of many employees and lead to their discharge. This fear has fortunately proved unfounded, there having been no reduction of the force worth mentioning. This I can say on reliable authority, having made inquiry also of the leaders of the associa tions of bank employees. On the contrary, in all such cases the common rule has been to take over undiminished the entire available force. Where mergers took place or where branches were established in place of absorbed pri­ vate banks, there was usually an extension of the business 767 » National Monetary Commission which made it necessary to increase rather than to reduce the existing personnel. As the power and capital of the banks have grown, the cases have become increasingly rare where a com­ plete prostration of business or a crisis has resulted in the discharge of employees. Moreover, in the course of the concentration movement more and more attention is paid by the banks to the social obligations toward their employees. The measures taken in this field are due to the common labors of banks, bankers, and the Central Federation of German Banks and Bankers (Centraherband des Deutschen Bank-und Bankier-gewerbes). The federation began an extensive and laborious investigation of the question of pensions and death benefits11 for bank employees as early as 1903, i. e., before the Imperial Government undertook a similar inquiry with regard to all salaried persons in private employ. Through the cooperation of many persons in banking circles and among the bank employees them­ selves there was organized in Berlin, on July 11, 1909, the Beamtenversickerungsverein des deutschen Bank- und Bankiergewerbes (a. G.) (Insurance Association of the employees of German Banks and Bankers). The asso­ ciation assures to all employees, members of the asso­ ciation, a pension in case they become incapacitated after ten years’ service, and provides benefits for widows and pensions for orphans in case of death. This asso­ ciation is the first of its kind in Germany, and on its board of honorary directors there are both the heads of banks and bank employees. The author of this book is chairman of the supervisory board. In the case of the German great banks such insurance had been instituted 768 The G e r m a n G r e a t B a n k s even before, in the form of independent funds, funds controlled by the bank, or special insurance. The same is true also of many other credit banks and likewise of a number of the larger private banking houses. On the subject of salaries authentic data have been collected for the first time in a paper of the business manager of the Centralverband Wittner, so far as it was possible to secure this information through the inquiry instituted by the Centralverband. For a proper appre­ ciation of the following figures it is well to bear in mind that they refer only to the regular salaries and do not include the customary incidental income of the employees, such as Christmas’, or New Year’s bonuses, which usually amount to several times the monthly salary. In the following table there are given the average salaries of bank employees, exclusive of minor employees, according to the investigation of the Central Federation of German Banks and Bankers, of March, 1906. For the sake of comparison, there are shown also the corre­ sponding average yearly incomes of all salaried employ­ ees in private employment. Age.

Their present level was reached gradually during the progress of concentra­ tion. On the average they are also higher than the salaries paid to the clerical help in the smaller private banks. Whether the increase in salaries has only kept pace with the increased cost of living and expenditures of the employees of the banks, or whether it has gone beyond this point and means a real improvement in their con­ ditions, this question can not be answered even with an approximate degree of assurance. So far as my experience and knowledge go, there has never been among the German credit banks any exploitation of unpaid help through the use of appren­ tices, as the Berlin great banks take in apprentices only in exceptional cases. As in all large establishments advancement of em­ ployees to independent positions within the bank has on the whole been slow. In this respect, however, concen­ tration has brought about a marked improvement. The establishment of numerous branches, commandites, de­ posit offices, agencies, and subsidiary banks at home and abroad has created opportunities for the promotion of efficient employees more numerous than before. The Central Federation of German Banks and Bankers has ever been in sympathy with the efforts to bring about certain improvements in the conditions of the working 770 The G e r m a n G r e a t B a n k s staff, as, for example, the extension of Sunday rest, early closing on Saturday, and better regulation of vacations. The reforms proposed, while not yet commonly adopted, are, however, nearer realization, as the result of progressive concentration and the introduction of greater uniformity in the internal management of banks. The part of the heads and leading personalities in the banks has now become much more important, since the former under certain circumstances are called upon to determine uniform business policies for entire groups of banks. It is primarily they who must decide whether the banks entrusted to their management shall pursue other and higher aims than merely those of large dividends. With the growth of the large establishments on the one hand and the disappearance of so many important pri­ vate banking houses, it will be increasingly difficult to fill these positions with men who possess the necessary breadth of view, the powerful initiative, and the organizmg ability to which Germany’s great enterprises in trade, industry and banking are so greatly indebted. Failure to find and recognize the work of such men would involve serious consequences not only for the concentration move­ ment, but for our entire economic development.1 3 It remains now to consider the effect of concentration on the development of the stock exchange. There is a large number of buying and selling orders coming to the great banks which they can offset against each other, thus taking over the function of the exchange. Only such orders as can not be offset are taken to the stock ex­ change. This applies equally to the business in securities, 771 Commission i. e., the capital market and to the discount business, i. e., the money market. The result has been that the bourse, in addition to the disorganizing effects of the stock exchange legislation, has suffered also the loss of ever increasing amounts of busi­ ness. This impaired its most vital function, that of proper price determination, and led to most serious con­ sequences, especially during critical times, as may be proved by very lamentable examples. There is danger that the bourse may gradually cease to serve as the most sensitive instrument for measuring the movements of trade or to act as “ the almost automatic regulator of the economic currents converging toward it.” 1 It is also becoming evident that more and more 5 it is losing its capacity by means of its quotations to reflect or influence public opinion as regards the credit and man­ agement of the large majority of States, communes, stock companies, and other corporations, all of which functions were regarded as indispensable for the business community as a whole and the trade in securities in particular. The system of price determinations and quotations pre­ vailing at the bourses, which in former years represented the fullest and truest possible reflex of existing supply and demand as well as other “ economic factors, which nowhere else were subject to such comprehensive perception and accurate measurement,” is bound to lose much of its former accuracy, steadiness, and reliability, all of which is highly regrettable from the point of view ol public in­ terests. There is furthermore ground for apprehension that this movement which also involves the elimination of iniddle772 . The G e r m a n G r e a t B a n k s men (brokers, etc.) may develop a state of constantly growing differences between bank and bourse. These dif­ ferences may express themselves in more than a certain tension between banking and bourse interests, which is frequently noticeable even at present. They may also come to affect the most characteristic function of the bourse, the determination of prices. As a matter of fact, in the opinion of some recent writers, there is a direct antithesis between bank and bourse.1 I regard this view 6 as erroneous, but not more so than that of other writers, who seem to regard the two as practically identical.1 7 Certain socialists contend that the inevitable result of the concentration movement now manifest in all branches of trade and industry will be to cumulate in an increasing volume on one side all the capital and income and on the other all the misery and poverty. Such has not been the outcome, nor is it likely to be. On the contrary, the social­ istic theory of the progressive impoverishment of the masses has been completely refuted by the progress of concentration in industry and banking. The purchasing power and the standard of living of the laboring classes have improved, the income of the middle and of the lower classes has risen relatively more than that of the upper classes, and to an increasing extent members of the lower classes have joined the ranks of the upper classes.1 8 We have now a valuable work on the “ Development of wages in industry since the establishment of the German Empire. Under this title R. Kuczynski, the director of the statistical bureau of the city of Schoneberg (Berlin, George Reiner, 1909), presents an extremely valuable col­ lection of comprehensive and reliable data covering wages 773 mm i s s ton paid during this period in Germany in mining (coal, lig­ nite, salt, and ore), in the building trades (masons, carpen­ ters, painters, fitters), in the stone and woodworking trades (joiners, cabinet makers, pattern makers, and makers of window blinds), in the metal trades, the book trade, and finally in transportation (vehicular, railroad, and sea transportation). It is impracticable here to reproduce even the leading features of a work which is bound to retain a permanent place in the literature of the subject. Suffice it to say, that the movement of all wages paid during the second period shows a strong upward tendency, more or less marked according to the branch of industry, the state of general prosperity, the location of the enterprise, the dif­ ference between city and country, the kind of product, and the hours of work. In the case of corporate undertakings the movement of wages manifestly is also influenced by the variations in dividends. A tabular statement show­ ing the influence of the last named factor in each particu­ lar instance would be of special interest. I therefore re­ frain from citing typical instances from the mass of mate­ rial presented, since it might always be objected that they had been chosen arbitrarily. Even more important would be complementary tables on the movement of prices of necessaries of life during the same period. For one thing this would serve to test the theory, which I believe to be correct, that “ every increase in the prices of the necessaries of life gives rise to an effort on the part of the workers to secure higher wages.” 1 9 To be sure these efforts do not always overcome the just or unjust opposition offered, and hence it may be 774 u * The Ge r man Gr e at Banks difficult to prove the theory satisfactorily by statistical evidence.2 0 Such complementary tables would also enable us to answer the further question whether and to what extent the gain to the workmen through higher wages has been offset by the simultaneous or preceding rise in the cost of living. This much is certain, that the increase of wages in general and in most trades has been greater than the increase since 1879 in the prices of necessaries caused by the import duties on foodstuffs, such as cereals, flour, animals, meat, bacon, and lard. In the absence of such parallel investigations, the con­ clusions drawn from the wage statistics must necessarily be incomplete and open to attack. They have to be sup­ plemented by reliable investigations of the growth of prosperity and of the changes in the condition of the working classes. On this point valuable information is available in the shape of the Materialien zur Beurteilung der Wohlstandsentwicklung Deutschlands im letzten Menschenalter (materials for estimating the growth of prosperity in Germany during the past generation), constituting Part III of the appendices to the draft of the imperial financial reforms act of 1908. Evidence in the same direction is furnished by Troeltsch.2 Taking the contributions due from those 1 who come under the old-age and disability insurance pro­ visions, he points out that there has been a relative decrease in the contributions collected from the lowest wage classes. This is especially noteworthy in view of the fact that any wage increases within the lowest wage groups do not at all affect the rate of contribution, while wage 775 National Monetary Commission increases in the higher wage groups either do not result in correspondingly larger contributions or do so only after some delay. It is noteworthy, moreover, that the lowest wage group has grown by the accession of a large number of low-paid home workers who during that period first became liable to insurance contributions. Another fact of some importance is cited by Troeltsch,2 2 viz, that 25 per cent of all workmen have deposits in the Wurttemberg district savings banks, the average deposits for each depositor belonging to that class amounting to 525.1 marks in 1892 and 571.7 marks in 1896. Another prediction made by socialists is that the final outcome of concentration will be the socialization of the means of production, for which they are striving and which is to be consummated in the “ state of the future.” This prediction has not been realized in Germany, nor is it likely to be realized, if only for the one reason that individual independence still constitutes a cherished ideal in the minds of most Germans. It was this sentiment chiefly which prevented German cartels from assuming the form of trusts proper, despite the great technical advantages which go with this type of organization. Finally, the movement of concentration has thus far not resulted in a comprehensive system of state-owned industries, a policy regarded by many as necessary and highly desirable; nor is this likely to happen unless wholly unforeseen developments take place. Nationalization of industry is practicable only in case of industries in which operation is more or less automatic. Unless demanded by imperative reasons in some special branch of industry in the interests of national self-preservation, or of the safety, 776 The G e r m a n G r e a t B a n k s rapidity, and extension of traffic, such nationalization represents but a backward step from the economic point of view. Government operation does not leave adequate scope for personal initiative, which is indispensable for general economic progress, nor for the needful spirit of enterprise on the part of the managers. The taking over by the Government of private enterprises beyond the bounds mentioned above is in keeping with the tenets of collectiv­ ist industrial organization advocated by social democracy. It would tend to weaken the motive of private gain, the most powerful stimulus of all economic progress. More­ over, it would make impossible the free development of the enterprising, efficient, and far-sighted personalities to whose energetic and untrammeled initiative Germany owes so much. The tendency toward state socialism, represented par­ ticularly by Adolph Wagner, which advocates state mo­ nopolies and the tightening of the screws of taxation to the point of expropriation, in my opinion is likely to do more harm to Germany than could ever be done by the purely individualistic tendency, little as I am disposed to favor the latter. In Germany, particularly, where the mere possibility of danger or of excesses2 is sufficient to create a demand 3 for state interference, one thing above all should be borne in mind. What holds good for the cartels is also true of all movements toward concentration— all of them are, if not the products of distress, at any rate products of neces­ sity. It is the general opinion in industrial circles that they are the most effective weapons in the struggle for 777 N at ion a l M on e t a r y Commission existence, especially in competition with foreign countries. The coincidence of similar movements in nearly all civil­ ized countries on the same level of economic development of itself makes it probable that this view is correct and that legislative interference, which is urged at times with­ out any definite purpose in view, merely to impede the movement toward concentration, represents a one-sided economic disarmament, a policy highly profitable— to other countries. In Germany we have special cause for holding our weap­ ons ready. We know that our agriculture is far from able to supply our rapidly growing population with the necessary food. This remains true even after allowance is made for the improvement in its position through the recent commeicial treaties and for a considerable increase both of the pro­ ductivity of the land and of the area under cultivation. We know, further, that we depend at present and shall de­ pend in the future on importation for a large part of our raw material, both in the shape of tropical products and of iron ore, lumber, fodder, and fertilizers.2 Finally, 4 we know that in many branches of industry our exports have declined, though only temporarily, let us hope, and that the general field for export is seriously threatened, one example being our sugar exports, in which agriculture is directly interested. Some foreign countries which here­ tofore were among our best customers are developing indus­ tries of their own, which make them more and more inde­ pendent of our manufactures. Again, w have to reckon re with the possible introduction of high import duties or preferential duties in favor of the mother country, or, 778 The G e r m a n G r e a t B a n k s finally, with more intense and dangerous competition on the part of other countries, such as the United States in the South American markets. Meanwhile the growth of our investments of capital abroad, with the income from which we have to pay an important part of our unfavor­ able trade balance, has not kept pace with that of the ex­ cess of our imports over exports. In view of these facts, and of the greater extent and strength of concentration abroad, I do not believe that we in Germany are as yet justified in putting a check on the further progress of con­ centration, except so far as relates to measures aiming merely at greater publicity2 in the case of cartels, or such 5 as are dictated by considerations of social policy under conditions mentioned above. The view expressed is confirmed by another considera­ tion. Up to 1907 the movement of concentration in Ger­ man industry and banking was continuously upward. We must, however, reckon also with unfavorable conditions in German trade and industry. Reasonable dividends on the greatly increased capital of the banks depend on gen­ eral prosperity in trade and industry, and it is inevitable that the banks will suffer from adverse conditions in the branches of industries with which they are allied. Unfa­ vorable trade conditions must result in bringing concen­ tration to a standstill. This happened, indeed, in 1907 and 1908 in the case of the great banks for this and other reasons. The movement may even be reversed, as hap­ pened more than once in the history of banking, a recent example being the dissolution of the community of interest between the Dresdner Bank and the A. Schaaffhausen’scher Bankverein.2 0 779 Exceptional legislation of the kind mentioned can best be avoided if the leaders of our great enterprises will keep more and more in close touch with the active social con­ science of our people. At a general meeting of the Verein fur Sozialpolitik2 7 Brentano reported that when in December, 1903, one of the largest English mine owners proposed to consoli­ date all English coal mines into a single trust he accom­ panied this plan with the proposal that representatives of the labor organizations should be called in and given a place not merely in the discussion of wages and condi­ tions of labor, but even as regular members of the board of directors. This idea was certainly in accord with the true conception that such a policy would not only confer rights but also impose duties on the workmen, and that we cannot justly hold anyone responsible for his conduct in economic matters so long as we have not given him an opportunity to develop a sense of personal responsi­ bility. This proposal was expressive alike of business shrewd­ ness and socio-political insight, and represents an attitude from which we are still far removed in Germany. Ger­ man employers still largely cling to the belief that they can indefinitely postpone the recognition of the right of workmen to combine and to bargain with them through representatives, whereas a more liberal policy is called for in view of the combinations that have taken place among the employers. It is my conviction that even mere passive resistance to these demands tends both to sharpen the antagonism and to increase the number and vehemence of the demands. Th e G e r m a n Gr e at Banks Our economic development in many respects will depend on the degree of socio-political insight possessed by the leaders of our great enterprises, the extent to which they appreciate the social duties and obligations that devolve upon them, and the economic self-restraint which they will impose upon themselves. A state within the state can not and will not be tolerated. The future of German banking will depend essentially on the character of the men at the head of the leading enterprises. All will be well if these leaders possess the necessary caution, knowing that it is not safe to over­ strain the bow or overheat the boilers. I feel confident that German banking by its own efforts will prove strong enough to keep out of leading positions men who have what W aentig2 calls “ robust con­ 8 sciences,” and who cast overboard, as useless ballast, all ethical and social considerations. Should, however, the contrary come to pass, in spite of our hopes and expecta­ tions, public opinion watching, as it does, our largest enterprises with the greatest attention, will surely react more quickly and effectively than it ever did in any other period of our economic development. One of the most hopeful features characteristic of our economic development has been a growth of public senti­ ment and sensitiveness against encroachments of any kind, a growth which in extent and rapidity has equaled, nay, exceeded, the movement of concentration. 781 http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/ L Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis NOTES. 7 83 N O TES. Part I. 1. “ Capitalistic economics,” in the popular sense of the expression, sig­ nifies not only production tending toward the formation of capital goods, but also production “ carried on under the rule and direction of the owner of the capital, or the capitalist” (E. von Bohm-Bawerk, “ K apital,” in the Handworterbuch der Staatswissenschaften, 2d ed., vol. 5, p .,25). Ruhland, it is true, in his “ System der Politischen Okonomie ” (Berlin, 1908), Vol. I l l , p.302, ventures to say that “ the word capitalism denotes to-day a social sys­ tem in which the liberty to practice usury is more or less completely legalized.” Capitalists are to him “ usurers in the widest sense of the word,” and b y usury he, like Franz Schaub, understands “ every contractual appropria­ tion of an evident surplus value.” The symptoms of such capitalism, according to Ruhland, are “ that money interests predominate, and that trade and robbery, gain, usury, and extortion merge into each other” (ibid., p. n 6 , No. 7aa). 2.

On this subject the following works should be consulted: Michael von Tugan-Baranowsky, Studien zur Theorie und Geschichte der Handelskrisen in England (Jena, 1901, G ustav Fischer), and Ludw ig Pohle, Bevolkerungsbewegung, Kapitalbildung und periodische Wirtschaftskrisen (Goet­ tingen, 1902, Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht), as well as the criticism of both theories b y Arthur Spiethoff (Schmoller’s Jahrbiicher fur Gesetzgebung, etc., Vol. X X V I I , No. 2, p. 331 et seq.). For a very detailed list of works published up to 1899 on the subject of crises, see Theodore E- Burton, Financial Crises and Periods of Industrial and Commercial Depression (New York, 1902, D. Appleton & Co.), pp. 3 4 7377. Unfortunately that list includes a number of perfectly worthless works. 18. See the very instructive book b y J. W. Gilbart (a former director of the London and Westminster Bank): “ The History, Principles, and Prac­ tice of Banking ” (ed. 1901, London, George Bell & Sons); concerning the crisis of 1825, ibid., 1, pp. 310 -3 11; the crisis of 1836, ibid., I, p. 311 seq.; the crisis of 1857, ibid., II, p. 361, seq., and the crisis of 1866, ibid., II, p. 342 seq. In 1836 over 70 new companies of every possible description were founded in three months, in Liverpool and Manchester alone. T he facility with which credit was obtained, and the encouragement thus given to specula­ tion, led to increases of from 25 to 100 per cent in the prices of all the chief articles of consumption, and of the raw materials of industry. In July, 1836, the Bank of England raised its rate of discount to \\]/2 per cent and in September to 5 per cent. Simultaneously it refused to discount a large number of American bills on first-rate houses, a proceeding that caused some excitement. houses, failed. crisis. Prices fell, and a number of firms, m ostly second-class T he banks withheld their resources, and thus increased the The joint stock banks had increased enormously, had raised their capitals considerably, and promoted speculation. This was referred to in very harsh terms in a “ Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons,” which, in conjunction with the prevalent depression, awakened the suspicion of the general public. and Commercial Bank of In November, 1836, the Agricultural Ireland suspended payments, which caused restrictive measures to be taken against the jo:nt stock banks, which were accustomed to rediscount their bills in London. In December, 1836, the Northern and Central Bank of Manchester, with a paid-up capital of £800,000, had to apply to the Bank of England for assistance. One London private bank, three large branches of American firms, and m any respectable trading firms followed suit. In 1857 (ibid., II, p. 361), 30 houses failed in England •with liabilities of about £9,080,000. First of all the Borough Bank at Liverpool (October, 1857), with deposits amounting to £1,200,000, whereof £800,000 were at 787 n etary mmission call; then on November 9, 1857, the Western Bank of Scotland, a very important Scotch deposit bank with 161 branches in Scotland, which had paid a dividend of 9 per cent in 1856. I t had claims of £1,603,000 on 4 trading firms that had become insolvent, whereas its entire nominal capital amounted to £1,500,000 only, and an item of £260,000 had figured in its published balance sheet under “ good assets,” which the managers them­ selves, according to notes found afterwards, had described as bad. T he bills of one of the 4 insolvent firms had been accepted b y 124 different persons; inquiries had been made b y the bank only concerning 37 of these persons, and of these latter 21 had been found either unsatisfactory or positively bad. In 1864, that is to say, shortly before the credit and speculation crisis of 1866 (ibid., II, pp. 3 4 2 - 3 5 7 ). 263 companies with a nominal capital of £78,135,000 had been formed in England, including 27 banks and 15 “ discount companies.” The rate of bank discount, which up to the middle of 1865 stood at 3 per cent, went up on October 2, 1865, to 5 per cent and on October 7, 1865, to 7 per cent, the Bank of France at the same time raising its discount rate from 4 per cent to 5 per cent. The Joint Stock Discount Company failed in the beginning of 1866; in April, 1866, B am ed’s Bank at Liverpool, with liabilities amounting to £3,500,000, a failure that caused a panic. The Bank of England raised its discount rate on M ay 8, 1866, to 8 per cent, and on the 9th to 9 per cent. On M ay 10, 1866, the great discount house of Messrs. Overend, Gurney & Co. failed with liabilities amounting to £10,000,000; the bank rate was raised to 10 per cent. Then, in rapid succession, came the failures of the Bank of London, the Con­ solidated Bank, the Agrar and Masterman’s Bank— all deposit banks; further, the English Joint-Stock Bank, the Imperial Mercantile Credit Company, the European Bank, etc. Within a period of ten days the Bank of England had granted advances on bills and discounted bills to the extent of £12,225,000; permission was granted to it to issue notes in excess of the legal limit. The doors of the most respectable banking firms were besieged, and the reports circulating did not stop at the most respectable names, and augmented the evil. Credit had been granted without discrimination, and the banks had either favored or themselves carried on speculation in every direction. “ Men are in haste to become rich. it has been so at all times and in all countries. now than ever. p. 356).

Recollec­ tions of such crises, however, seem to disappear more rapidly than the in­ juries they inflict. This remarkable but firmly established fact, however, should not apply to the directors of banks, who should and must gain experience from every crisis. 788 T h e G e r m a n G r e a t B a n k s 19.

All the equipment for future production was increasing at a more rapid pace than ever before. In these expenditures we have the effect of capital in­ vested for objects not immediately remunerative.” 20.
