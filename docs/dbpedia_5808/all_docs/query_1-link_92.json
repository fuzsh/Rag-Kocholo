The common theme of these meetings was to investigate the various uses of the ubiquitous but ill-deﬁned term ‘civil society’, and its applicability (if any) to the understanding of British ideas, institutions, and relations with other cultures, over the past several hundred years. Participants in those meetings included a number of friends and colleagues who do not appear in the ﬁnal volume, but whose thoughts contributed substantially to its ﬁnal shape. The authors would particularly like to thank Ewen Green, Janet Howarth, Ross Mckibbin, and John Robertson for their input at various stages. Our late colleague, Colin Matthew, was also an active participant in early discussions, and it will be a matter of regret to many that his projected contribution on ‘Civil Society and the Union of England and Wales, Scotland, and Ireland’ was never written. Another person who deserves mention is Asa Briggs, who for many years fostered conviviality and argument among Oxford historians of modern Britain. With Asa’s retirement conviviality declined, but the legacy of argument fortunately remains. Ruth Parr and Anne Gelling gave helpful advice about the ﬁnal shape of the project and its conversion into a book. After the project was complete, the contributors had the good fortune to be invited to share their ideas with a number of Japanese historians at two international research seminars, held at the Kobe Institute, and at the International Research Center for Japanese Studies attached to the University of Kyoto. Although these two seminars came too late to affect the text of the completed work, their very lively discussions strongly conﬁrmed what had become a central theme of an otherwise very diverse project—that conceptions of ‘civil society’, both in theory and in institutional practice, varied widely according to historical and cultural context. The authors would especially like to acknowledge the help of Professor Kumie Inose, Professor Haita Kawakatsu, and Professor Minoru Takada in arranging these seminars. The editor of the volume, Jose Harris, would personally like to thank the Leverhulme Foundation, whose generous support while she was a research professor opened up the possibility of thinking about long-term perspectives that often get obscured by the pressures of research specialization. Grateful thanks also to St Catherine’s College, the Queen’s College, and the Oxford Modern History faculty, for the occasional ‘beer and sandwiches’ lunches that kept the project going.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nContents List of Contributors Introduction: Civil Society in British History: Paradigm or Peculiarity? 1.

(J. N. Figgis, Studies of Political Thought from Gerson to Grotius 1907)\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nIntroduction: Civil Society in British History: Paradigm or Peculiarity? The ancient concept of ‘civil society’ largely disappeared from Anglo-American and European political discourse for much of the twentieth century.1 It resurfaced in two seminal German works of the 1960s, Habermas’s The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere (1962) and Dahrendorf’s Society and Democracy in Germany (1965), each of which slowly percolated into Englishlanguage discussion of social and political history over subsequent decades.2 Both these authors, otherwise very unalike in their political and philosophical views, portrayed ‘civil society’—by which they meant autonomous social and economic institutions outside the sphere of government—as a central arena of the historical transition to ‘modernity’. For Dahrendorf a ﬂourishing civil society was the practical embodiment of the legal, economic, political, and personal freedoms set out in F. A. Hayek’s ‘constitution of liberty’; while for Habermas civil society had been the ‘precondition’ for the emergence of a new kind of ‘bourgeois public sphere’, which since the late-seventeenth century had increasingly replaced the cultural, sociable, normative, and taste-creating roles once performed by royal courts and kingly governments. Both accounts portrayed the evolution of civil society as closely linked to the growth of markets and cities, the rise of ‘public opinion’, the genesis of new forms of privacy and selfawareness, and the burgeoning of a multitude of self-generating free associations that performed a ‘public’ function but operated largely without reference to the realm of the state.3 Place of publication is London, unless otherwise speciﬁed, throughout the notes. 1 It was wholly unmentioned, for example, in such major reference works as Gould and Kolb (eds.), A Dictionary of the Social Sciences (1964); The Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences (New York, 1968 edn.); The Encyclopaedia of Philosophy (1968 edn.); and David Walker (ed.), The Oxford Companion to Law (Oxford, 1980). By contrast, the New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics and the Law (1998) devoted no less than fourteen columns to ‘civil society’. 2 Jürgen Habermas, Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit. Untersuchungen zu einer Kategorie der Bürgerlichen Gesellschaft (Berlin, 1962); Ralf Dahrendorf, Gesellschaft und Demokratie in Deutschland (Munich, 1965). Whereas Dahrendorf’s study rapidly appeared in English, Habermas’s book was not translated until 1989; but both works were highly inﬂuential in the wider debate that took shape in the 1970s (see Ch. 4, below). 3 Ralf Dahrendorf, Society and Democracy in Germany (English edn., 1968), 128–9, 200–10; Jürgen Habermas, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere (English edn., 1989), 19–20, 23, 30–43, 51–6.\n\n2 Jose Harris Use of the term ‘civil society’ gathered momentum in the 1970s and early 1980s in the German Sonderweg debates, where the imperfect formation of ‘civil society’ in nineteenth-century Germany was widely portrayed (along lines suggested by Dahrendorf) as a major cause of subsequent ‘pathological’ developments in that country’s national history.4 Not until the end of the cold war in the late-1980s, however, did the term ‘civil society’ burst into the public arena as a commanding theme in contemporary political debate.5 Since 1989 it has enjoyed a remarkable renaissance, not just in academic political thought but in the language of popular politics, moral persuasion, markets, and the mass media. Over the past two decades, literally thousands of titles on ‘civil society’ have been published in Eastern and Western Europe, Britain and North America—some of them detached and analytical, some actively critical, but many more extolling the beneﬁts of civil society, and urging its promotion and extension. Portrayed initially as a societal counterweight to excessive state power (in both authoritarian regimes and ‘over-governed’ democratic ones), it has more recently come to be seen in a rather different light as a means of reconstituting civic peace in places where state authority seems to have lost general legitimacy (as in Ulster, Kosova, Afghanistan, southern Africa, and other areas of multi-ethnic conﬂict).6 And, concurrently with these hoped-for practical applications in the present, ‘civil society’ has been increasingly invoked in scholarly reinterpretations of the past, where it has supplemented and in some contexts even displaced the more familiar categories of state, party, nation, mass movement, and social class. In much recent historical writing ‘civil society’ has been identiﬁed as present or latent in many earlier historical structures, even where the human participants in those structures had rarely if ever made explicit use of the term.7 In much of this discussion, the social and institutional history of Britain has frequently been cited as a paradigm example. Both Habermas and Dahrendorf, in their rather different accounts of the growth of liberal institutions and a ‘bourgeois public sphere’, portrayed developments in Britain from the early eighteenth century as the pattern and pioneer of an ever-expanding civil society (its citizens linked together by contract, choice, ‘civility’, and self-interest, rather than by the organic, sacramental, and interpersonal ties typical of more 4\n\nCh. 4, below. John Keane (ed.), Civil Society and the State: New European Perspectives (1988), both recorded and helped to shape the international revival of the term. Other inﬂuential works included Jean L. Cohen and Andrew Arato, Civil Society and Political Theory (Cambridge, Mass., 1992); Ernest Gellner, Conditions of Liberty: Civil Society and its Rivals (1994); and Michael Walzer (ed.), Towards a Global Civil Society (Oxford, 1995). 6 e.g. J. W. de Gruchy and S. Martin (eds.), Religion and the Reconstruction of Civil Society (University of South Africa, 1995); Commonwealth Foundation, Democratic Government in Zimbabwe: Citizen Power (Harare, Zimbabwe, 2000). 7 e.g., Urban History, 25: 3, Dec. 1998, Special Issue on ‘Civil Society in Britain’; John Garrard, Democratisation in Britain: Elites, Civil Society and Reform since 1800 (2002); Nancy Bermeo and Philip Nord, Civil Society before Democracy: Lessons from Nineteenth-century Europe (2000): Kathleen D. McCarthy (ed.), Women, Philanthropy, and Civil Society (Bloomington, Ind., 2001). 5\n\nIntroduction 3 traditional polities).8 Similarly in the Sonderweg debates Britain was frequently cited as an exemplar of a ‘free and civil country’ which had steered its way from ‘feudalism’ to ‘modernity’, without the excesses of civil violence, ethnic and class antagonisms, and overweening concentrations of state power, often experienced by its continental neighbours and by Germany in particular.9 And to many other commentators it appeared that, despite the stresses of industrialization, mass urbanization, empire, and two world wars, British political and legal institutions had been markedly more successful than those elsewhere in Europe at containing and ‘including’ the new interest groups, classes, and potentially disintegrative social forces generated by capitalism and economic change. Moreover, even when accompanied by large-scale expansion of state power, the processes of containment and absorption in Britain seemed to have occurred in tandem with continuous expansion of personal freedom and of civil and constitutional rights. Above all, Britain was perceived as being (along with the United States) one of the classic heartlands of ‘civil association’. It was seen as a society where social relations largely took the form of partnerships, fraternities, groups, and congregations freely entered into by entrepreneurs, workmates, neighbours, and fellow-citizens, and which were regulated only very lightly by parliament and common law—in marked contrast to the much more ‘corporatist’ or ‘holistic’ traditions of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Germany, or the heavy-handed state dirigisme of post-revolutionary France.10 All of this is in many ways a very familiar, long-established, even conventional, narrative to students of the last three centuries of British history. It has much in common with the understanding of Britain’s national character and identity generated by the Second World War (a time when very few people used the actual language of ‘civil society’).11 But for the historian who wants to go beyond the level of grand generalization, the picture of Britain as an archetypal civil society poses a number of questions and difﬁculties. The most obvious of these is: how far is the story true? Was the path of social and institutional growth in Britain quite so gradualist, peaceable, pluralist, spontaneous, ‘civic’, and inclusive as many theorists and proponents of civil society have suggested, or is this simply a more ‘theorized’ and updated version of the earlier Whiggish national myth? How far does the grand narrative propounded by present-day civil society theorists bear any relation to real historical structures, institutions, ideas, individuals, and events? Paradoxically, the characterization of Britain by theorists of ‘civil society’ as the classic arena of peaceful and inclusive societal change coincided with a moment when detailed research by social and political historians, rooted in archival and other primary sources, was increasingly pointing in a rather different direction. 8 Habermas, Public Sphere, 17, 57–67, 78–9, 93–4, 167–8, et passim; Dahrendorf, Society and Democracy, 53–4, 70, 272–4. 9 Below, Ch. 5. 10 Below, Ch. 1. 11 For classic accounts of this national self-awareness, see Richard Titmuss, Problems of Social Policy (1951); Paul Addison, The Road to 1945 (1975).\n\n4 Jose Harris Several major historical studies of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s drew attention to the many failures of inclusion within mainstream British institutions of various minority and even majority groups (for example, the very late arrival of formal democracy, the prolonged life-span of aristocratic and quasi-feudal power, the absence of women from the public sphere, the very limited popular access to courts of law, and the chronically fraught condition and ultimate failure of the union between Britain and Ireland). Such studies highlighted certain historic acts of violence perpetrated both domestically and imperially by agents of the British state; and they gave prominence to the fact that the state itself (albeit a relatively slimline and semi-invisible state) had played a much more powerful role in the shaping of economic, ﬁnancial, social, and cultural relations than had often been supposed. Studies of the ‘ﬁscal-military state’, the ‘policeman-state’, the ‘overextended state’, and many aspects of the mid-twentieth century ‘welfare state’ all cautioned against underestimating the discretionary, coercive, and interventionist powers of British governing institutions, not simply since the Second World War, but over much longer periods of time.12 And this questioning of the identity of Britain’s past coincided with a degree of disenchantment about the present time as institutions forged in the cross-currents of earlier eras were increasingly perceived as failing to adjust to the post-industrial, multicultural, egalitarian, and ‘globalizing’ pressures of the later twentieth century. By the mid-1990s some of the very same voices that only a few years earlier had been to the fore in identifying Britain as an archetypal ‘civil society’ were now equally prominent in commenting adversely on Britain’s collapse of ‘civility’ and widespread civic decline.13 At the end of the twentieth century many enthusiasts for the revival of ‘civil society’ appeared to have shifted away from the Anglo-centric narratives of mainstream British history; they were looking instead for its embodiment either in the more concrete and intimate sphere of local communities and ‘voluntary association’ or in the more abstract, legalistic, and impersonal sphere of institutions campaigning for universal ‘human rights’.14 By a strange reversal of fortunes normative ideas about ‘civil society’, long seen as inspired by the evolutionary political culture of the Anglo-Saxon countries, now began to emanate from a quite different cultural\n\n12 J.

What have its numerous theorists and protagonists understood by the term, both in past epochs and at the present time, and what have they had in common? In current debates many who talk and write about civil society, both as a theoretical concept and as a desirable programme or goal, appear to assume that its content and frame of reference are self-evidently clear and exact. Yet the idea of ‘civil society’ has had an immense variety of complex and often arcane intellectual roots—in Roman law, in medieval Christian theology, in earlymodern positivist jurisprudence, in classical political economy, and in different strands of idealism, liberalism, and Marxism.16 Resonances of all of these ancestries can be heard in current uses of the term, but often in forms very remote from those intended by their original authors. Some of these lineages overlap or are closely linked together, whereas others entail totally different, even antithetical, outlooks on such basic issues as the role and character of states, communities, markets, religion, families, and self-governing private associations. Many nuances of meaning have been both lost and added in translation, with the Latin terms Societas and Civitas, the German bürgerliche Gesellschaft and staatliche Gesellschaft, and the French société civile, all being anglicized and homogenized as ‘civil society’. The result has been that commentators in Britain and elsewhere have differed widely on the scope and deﬁnition of civil society—on whether it refers primarily to institutions in the public sphere, to arrangements in the private sphere, or to a special area of interaction or ‘interface’ between the two. Many classic English and Scottish writers on the subject (Hobbes, Locke, Adam Ferguson, Henry Maine) portrayed the state itself as the fundamental institution of civil society; whereas most nineteenth-century German authors (Hegel, Marx, Riehl, Emminghaus) used the term to refer to various institutions and processes distinct from the state (among them markets, vocational corporations, and the organs of municipal government).17 Despite the widespread perception of Britain as a classic civil society, recent commentators have more often followed the German usage in applying the term to ‘non-governmental’ bodies outside the state, including both those which act in partnership with the state (such as 15 Colin Crouch and David Marquand (eds.), Re-inventing Collective Action. From the Global to the Local (Oxford, 1995); G. Teubner (ed.), Global Law Without a State (Aldershot, 1997). 16 J. N.

Some authorities (such as the American sociologist Amitai Etzioni) have used ‘civil society’ more or less interchangeably with the idea of ‘community’; whereas for others (such as Dahrendorf) the two concepts are deeply antithetical (‘civil society’ entailing free-standing individuals, contractual relations, and impersonal legal rules; while ‘community’ implies close-knit kinship, ethnic, neighbourhood, and confessional ties that are often ‘given’ rather than ‘chosen’).18 Similar ambiguity surrounds the role of markets. To many commentators ‘civil society’ is closely identiﬁed, for better or worse, with capitalism and ‘market society’. But within this approach there are many different shades of understanding about whether it is markets themselves that form the core of civil society—or whether it refers rather to the framework of laws, regulations, and moral restraints that make markets to some degree publicly accountable.19 And, at the same time, there are others who treat civil society as though it were the very opposite of market society—as a sector in which social exchanges take place, for a variety of reasons and motives, outside the economic context of prices, payment, and proﬁt. This latter view again embraces a very wide spectrum of theory and opinion, ranging from those ethically and ideologically committed to non-proﬁt-making ‘public service’, through to those within the Gramscian strand of Marxism, for whom ‘civil society’ means non-economic cultural and social institutions that nevertheless implicitly support a wider framework of capitalist domination.20 In the sphere of law, the technical language of ‘civil society’ has been much more conspicuous in the Roman-based civil law systems of continental Europe and of Scotland than in the common law systems of England and Wales, the British Commonwealth, and the United States: a fact which makes it all the more remarkable that, until very recently, it has often been common-law countries in which observers of civil society have perceived its principles as being most concretely and historically embodied. Over many centuries theorists both high and low have largely concurred in linking civil society to ideas about voluntarism, individual autonomy, and rational choice; but a very long history of conceptual mutation lies behind the evolution of ‘voluntarism’ in the sense used by medieval moral theology (the Augustinian 18 Amitai Etzioni, The Spirit of Community: Rights, Responsibilities and the Communitarian Agenda (New York, 1993) (though see the same author’s much more critical approach to civil society from a communitarian perspective, in Etzioni, The Monochrome Society (Princeton, NJ, 2001); Dahrendorf, Society and Democracy, 120–32. 19 Habermas, Public Sphere, 29–31; Antonio Estache, Politics, Transaction Costs, and the Design of Regulatory Institutions (Washington, 1999); Sandra van Thiel, Quangos: Trends, Causes, and Consequences (Aldershot, 2001). 20 For a wide variety of such views, see Lester M.

In the mélange of prescriptive ideas, social theories, and historical perspectives that swarmed around in British, European, North American, and post-colonial public cultures at the turn of the twenty-ﬁrst century, civil society was clearly a powerful and compelling theme that captured the imaginations of many, but its precise meaning and provenance have remained obstinately obscure. In a British context, prominent political ﬁgures as various in outlook as William Hague, David Willetts, Chris Patten, David Blunkett, and Gordon Brown have all concurred in prescribing a renewal of Britain’s unique historic legacy of ‘civil society’ as a remedy for the country’s current social ills; but whether they mean the same thing by this appeal to earlier ideas and practices seems doubtful.23 Similar diversity has prevailed in the sphere of public persuasion. While the Institute for the Study of Civil Society (founded as an offshoot of a free-market think-tank, the Institute of Economic Affairs, in 1998) has interpreted its remit as being primarily the historical analysis and practical promotion of voluntary self-help, the Centre for Global Civil Society (founded at the London School of Economics in 2000) focuses on crossnational promulgation of universal human rights (to be imposed ‘preferably by consent, but by force if required’).24 Likewise in academic and media debate, many who thirty years ago were stern critics of bourgeois society have now become no less powerful advocates of civil society (regardless of the fact that, in one strand of linguistic origin and in the usage of many both past and present, the two concepts are one and the same). The present collection of studies has arisen out of a shared sense of dissatisfaction among its authors with all this ambiguity and muddle. The collection is\n\n21\n\nSee below, Ch. 1.

The discussion drew upon the very diverse research interests of the group’s members, in such areas as political thought, social policy, imperialism, urban and military history, voluntary associations, rational choice theory, class relations, and constructions of gender. The participants embarked upon these discussions united only by their sense that ‘civil society’ appeared to have some bearing upon many historical settings—but that its usefulness and cutting edge as an historical concept were often fatally undermined, not just by vagueness in uses of the term, but by the fact that, wherever it was sharply deﬁned, it meant quite different and mutually contradictory things in different intellectual, national, temporal, and cultural contexts. There seemed little point, for example, in discussing whether Britain over several centuries had been the ‘unique exemplar’ of civil society in respect to its traditions of grass-roots association and voluntary philanthropy, if what civil society really meant was (as some authorities maintained) the universalization of free markets or (as others maintained) an over-arching regulatory ‘impartial state’. Was there any connection, other than an arbitrary freak of language, between the ideas of the grand theorists and the recent claim by a spokesman of the British Football Association that the game he represents should have its own public regulator because ‘football has become a unique institution of our civil society’ (a statement interesting both in its own right, and as evidence of the far-reaching popular resonance of the term in the early twenty-ﬁrst century)?25 In the end, the decision was taken to eschew any single unitary model, but to explore different aspects of social, intellectual, and institutional life in Britain over several centuries, with a view to ﬁnding out where— if anywhere—the various off-the-peg models of civil society seemed to ﬁt (or, alternatively, where they seemed irrelevant or historically inappropriate). The results, as suggested below, came up with some perhaps rather surprising conclusions about how a supposedly ‘classic’ civil society operated in real life. They indicate that certain assumptions about the deﬁnitive attributes of civil society often ascribed to it by its current theorists and protagonists are—at least in the case of the history of Britain—often inapplicable or false. From the eighteenth century there certainly developed in Britain a large layer of dynamic social interaction that closely resembled Habermas’s ‘bourgeois public sphere’ in being distinct both from purely private life and from courtly or ‘high’ politics; but this intermediate social layer was both much more actively involved in the various organs of government and public administration than Habermas had suggested, and also much less uniformly ‘bourgeois’ (at least in the English understanding of that malleable term).26 Civil society as it was understood in Britain was never a pure form, but coexisted at different times and in different ways with many other forms of social organization and identity, based on such 25\n\nBBC interview, Sport on Four, 24 Nov. 2001.\n\n26\n\nBelow, Chs. 3, 5, and 6.\n\nIntroduction 9 factors as family, ethnicity, gender, locality, inheritance, patriotism, and religious belief. Virtually nobody, for example, after the end of the seventeenth century thought that patriarchalism (arguably the extreme obverse of civil society) was an adequate basis for constitutional rights and governmental power; but this did not preclude the persistence of many residues of patriarchy in the spheres of property relations, gender, professional organizations, and family life. The civic peace of ‘civil society’ (based on law, contract, and guarantees of personal freedom) was often favourably compared with the supposed disorders of ‘natural society’ (the latter based on personal protection networks, tribalism, and maﬁa-like extended families). But again this did not prevent patronage and kinship connections, or the lack of them, from having a powerful impact on an individual’s prospects in the arena of ‘open competition’ promoted by civil society. The operation of markets (seen by some as a sine qua non of civil society) could stimulate the activities of voluntarism, self-help, and self-governing associations, but it might also in certain circumstances frustrate and undermine them; as could be seen in the ‘crisis of voluntarism’ among Edwardian and inter-war friendly societies, or in the ‘bowling-alone’ phenomenon of the later twentieth century. (‘Bowling alone’ itself, seen by Putnam and others as a signal of the recent decline of civil society, would be seen by some as its deﬁning characteristic—embodied in the person of the free-standing, freely choosing, rational individual, ‘unencumbered’ by societal ties other than transient and tradable ones).27 On the other hand, several of the essays included here seem to demonstrate very clearly certain institutional and cultural traits and practices that corresponded to some past and present deﬁnitions of civil society; and they may help us to piece together a picture of how far the term may or may not be applicable to the history of Britain. They suggest, for example, that there was no necessary incompatibility between voluntary action and strong central government—that an active and ﬂourishing civil society could on occasion be the precondition of highly effective collaboration between the two.28 Voluntarism per se, however, was never directly equated with civil society by any British commentators before the 1980s, and there seems reason to doubt how far it is appropriate to do so now.29 Civil society is often assumed, and was assumed in the past, to be categorically ‘secular’ in outlook (with religious practice either occupying its own separate public sphere, or being deemed inherently personal and private). But several of the theorists and advocates of civil society studied in this collection maintained exactly the opposite view—that only a cultural framework linked to some form of publicly organized religion could make modern mass society genuinely both ‘social’ and ‘civil’, and that religious practice in its this-worldly manifestations might in itself be a component of civil society.30 In this respect 27 Robert Putnam, Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community (2000); Ferdinand Tönnies, Community and Civil Society, ed. Jose Harris (Cambridge, 2001); Patrick Joyce, The Social in Question: New Bearings in History and the Social Sciences (2002); below, Chs. 4 and 7. 28 29 30 Below, Chs. 4 and 9. Below, Chs. 1 and 4. Below, Chs. 1, 2, and 12.\n\n10 Jose Harris much eighteenth–century Anglican thought bore a close resemblance to certain strands of moderate Islamic thought on civil society at the present day.31 Another point which emerged was that the role of particular groups within civil society ebbed and ﬂowed in different periods and contexts; women, for example, were sometimes acknowledged as active participants and fellow-citizens, at other times were demoted and obscured; they were promoted by some variants of civil society (such as philanthropy, sociability, and voluntary action), while being simultaneously sidelined by others (such as entrepreneurship and political representation).32 Religious dissenters were seen in some contexts as potential subverters of civil society, in others as its supporters and beneﬁciaries. Similarly, there was little evidence to support the commonly held view that civil society was a quintessentially ‘urban’ phenomenon, dependent on the close contacts and information networks of city life. This might have been true in the early eighteenth century, when communications and ‘publicity’ were relatively localized and limited; but by the second quarter of the twentieth century rural communities in many parts of Britain appeared to have established an associational, participatory, and self-regulatory culture that was no whit less active, multifaceted, and ‘public’ than its equivalent in cities and towns (while recent debate on the erosion of civil society has identiﬁed symptoms of its structural decline in both urban areas and rural ones).33 A general conclusion is, not that the term is so protean as to be meaningless, but that it makes much more sense if seen as locally variable and culturally speciﬁc; as a phenomenon shaped and modiﬁed by different historical contexts, rather than as a universal and predeﬁned analytical model. Many of the classic British theorists of civil society (Hooker and Hobbes, Ferguson and Smith, even the historically minded Sir Henry Maine) conceived of their ideas as having some kind of general or ‘universal’ application. But universalism often clashed with stubborn historic reality, as manifested in the romantic and corporatist conceptions of ‘civil society’ (quite different from those of Victorian liberalism) that British observers encountered in nineteenth-century Germany; or in the civic revival of family, village, religion, and nation that secular missionaries for British-style ‘modernity’ discovered in early twentieth-century India. Similarly, the centuries-old saga of relations between European settlers and indigenous peoples—investigated here through colonial and post-colonial treatment of Australian Aborigines—suggests that what appear to be fundamental tenets of civil society may in certain circumstances be in deep tension and contradiction with each other.34 And even within very similar frameworks of language, liberalism, and the common law, conceptions of the ‘regulatory’ aspects of civil society could evolve quite differently in different institutional settings (as suggested\n\n31 M. Khatani, Islam, Dialogue, and Civil Society (Canberra: Australian National University, 2000); S. H. Hashmi (ed.), Islamic Political Ethics: Civil Society, Pluralism and Conﬂict (Princeton, NJ, 2002). 32 Below, Chs. 3 and 11. 33 Below, Chs. 2 and 10. 34 Below, Chs. 5, 7, and 15.\n\nIntroduction 11 by comparison of public/private economic partnerships in Edwardian London and New York).35 Within Britain itself the late nineteenth-century trade-union movement—if judged by the criterion of active, self-governing, ‘voluntary association’—appeared to represent the very essence of a vital civil society; but nevertheless trade unionists resolutely resisted the other face of civil society, in the form of public regulation of their collective activities by statute and common law.36 Similarly middle-class pressure groups might act as the disinterested moral conscience of the public sphere; but they could also lapse on occasion into something remarkably like the networks of ‘sinister interest’ and ‘old corruption’ that civil society was widely supposed to have discredited and displaced.37 There appeared to be no single path to ‘civil society’, not one single prototype but many, even within the public culture identiﬁed by Habermas and Dahrendorf as its classic historical site. The chapters of this book are all derived from the ongoing research interests of the contributors, and contain historical materials and intepretative arguments unpublished anywhere else. However, each chapter is written in a way designed to be accessible to readers outside a particular area of technical research, and to engage with issues that are current not just in academic history and the social sciences but in wider public debate in Britain, Europe, Japan, North America, and elsewhere. Although the chapters stretch over several centuries and address a wide range of historical contexts (including comparative material on Germany, Ireland, India, Australia, and the United States), they are fused together by the common theme of exploring and deﬁning the multiple meanings of ‘civil society’ and their relevance or otherwise to particular events and institutions in the history of Britain. Although each chapter has been written by a separate author, the whole work has beneﬁted from the comments and suggestions of other contributors. As will become apparent, there was some diversity of opinion about how ‘civil society’ should be conceived and deﬁned, but an overall consensus that—at least in the context of British history—the state itself had been an important element in either shaping or actually constituting civil society, and could not be left out of the reckoning. Quite apart from the centrality of the theme of ‘civil society’ in current historical and social-science debate, the collection highlights the importance of linking broad conceptual interpretations of history to primary archival and textual research, and offers a series of case-studies showing how this may be done in practice. These studies also demonstrate many ways in which key aspects of current (and apparently novel) debate were replicated or anticipated in many earlier historical settings. The book is in no sense exhaustive in its coverage: indeed the contributors became acutely conscious of how much more work 35\n\nBelow, Ch. 7. Thus, most British civil society theorists who considered the issue of trade unions thought that they should accept the status of legally deﬁned corporations, as giving them ultimately greater independence from the powers of the state (below, Ch. 1). 37 Below, Chs. 4, 6, and 13. 36\n\n12 Jose Harris might have been done on civil society in such contexts as the empire, Ireland, law and public order, commercial relations, ethnic diversity, and changing conceptions of subjective human identity—to name but a few. But it points towards many ways in which further historically rooted investigations into ‘civil society’ might clarify, extend, and possibly even redeﬁne our understanding of this much used (and much abused!) term.\n\n1\n\nFrom Richard Hooker to Harold Laski: Changing Perceptions of Civil Society in British Political Thought, Late Sixteenth to Early Twentieth Centuries JOSE HARRIS\n\nI Current discussion of ‘civil society’ in Britain and elsewhere draws extensively though often unconsciously upon two distinct intellectual lineages that are in certain respects deeply antithetical. One is a tradition that evolved in Germany during the late eighteenth/early nineteenth century, which saw ‘civil society’ as consisting of a range of semi-private and corporate institutions (including economic production and markets) separate from and outside the state.1 In much nineteenth-century German thought a central problem for law and government was how to harmonize and incorporate those often dissonant lesser institutions into a larger political whole; but more recent variants of that tradition have reemphasized the autonomy of ‘civil society’ and its distinctness from formal governing institutions. The second tradition that continues to inform current debate was set in train by the French Revolution. Deriving from Rousseau and reﬁned by Kant, it saw civil society as embodying the equal and identical political and legal rights of citizens, purged of any qualifying reference to kinship, status, religious confession, and inherited privilege (and to other forms of\n\n1 Hegel’s Philosophy of Right, trans. with notes by T. M. Knox (1952), paras. 182–256; W. H. von Riehl, Die bürgerliche Gesellschaft (Stuttgart, 1851); Karl Marx, Early Writings, ed. by L.Colletti (Harmondsworth , 1975), passim. It should be noted that, with the exception of the essay ‘On the Jewish Question’ (1843), Marx’s most important comments on civil society, such as The German Ideology, were not available even in German till the mid-twentieth century.\n\n14 Jose Harris ‘difference’ that came to be seen over the course of time as similarly arbitrary).2 This latter tradition was in the past implicitly, and often explicitly, hostile to intermediate, particularist, semi-private bodies except where these were directly licensed and endorsed by the state (or by some more universal sovereign authority in a hypothetical ‘internationalist’ polity of the future).3 Nineteenth-century Britons detected both these ways of thinking in the respective institutions of their continental neighbours—in the ‘incorporating’ policies of Prussia and Wilhelmine Germany, and in the centralizing, codifying, ‘macadamizing’ tendencies of post-revolutionary and post-Napoleonic France—and they were conscious of living in Britain under a set of social arrangements that was distinctively different from either.4 British society as it had evolved over many centuries was full of a vast and burgeoning array of ‘spontaneous’ self-governing voluntary associations—religious, commercial, educational, charitable, scientiﬁc, local, or merely peculiar—whose existence was either wholly unknown to the law and public authorities, or only very lightly regulated by them.5 Many of these voluntary bodies—like the London Stock Exchange, the ancient universities, and major philanthropic organizations—performed functions that in France and Germany would have been closely monitored by government and public law, but that in Britain for long remained subject only to private laws relating to companies, trusts, or charities (and then to a large extent only if they speciﬁcally chose to be so). Contrary to what is often supposed, however, this plethora of voluntary arrangements, distinct from government or ‘the state’, was not what Victorians and Edwardians or their forebears had in mind when they talked (as they did from time to time) about ‘civil society’. There was an Anglophone tradition of thinking about civil society, that developed spasmodically over the course of time from the sixteenth through to the early twentieth centuries, but it was only indirectly concerned with the many and various kinds of private voluntary association. Language of course is plastic and dynamic, and the fact that people used a term in the past to mean something quite different from what they mean by it in the present does not thereby invalidate current usage. But because this shift has been largely overlooked or glossed over, there is some danger that in current narratives of civil society those earlier resonances and frame of reference will be misinterpreted or lost. This chapter will attempt to trace the shifting 2 Jean Jacques Rousseau, The Social Contract and the Discourses, ed. by G. D. H.

This was doubtless a misleading ﬁgure, but it reﬂected a widely held nineteenth-century view that England was the Mecca of voluntary association.\n\nPolitical Thought, Hooker to Laski 15 contours of that earlier tradition, and to identify ways in which civil society (or its close synonyms) was imagined, theorized, and written about by political commentators in different contexts and periods of British history. No suggestion is intended here that ‘ideas’ about civil society necessarily shaped the ways in which society behaved, but simply that the expression of such ideas is a major clue to what people at the time thought was true and important. Unsurprisingly, over several centuries nuances of language and perceptions of social reality changed, and a way of conceptualizing social relations that was central to political thought in some generations lapsed into largely redundant cliché in others. It will be suggested, however, that despite wide diversity in their immediate concerns, British theorists of civil society over the course of four centuries held certain distinctive core assumptions in common. Moreover, although it shared many ancient roots with conceptions of civil society on the continent, this British tradition parted company at a certain point from both German and French understandings of the term (or, perhaps more accurately, all three diverged from what had hitherto been a common tradition throughout Western Europe).6 And, even more markedly, past understanding of civil society in Britain signiﬁcantly differed from many current Anglo-American uses of ‘civil society’ at the start of the twenty-ﬁrst century.\n\nII ‘Civil society’ ﬁrst emerged in vernacular languages in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, in response to controversies about religious diversity, the role of monarchy, relations between church and state, the dismantling of personal ﬁefdoms and private armies, and the endemic threat of civil war. In both Britain and Europe writers drew heavily on earlier Latin uses of the term— on the Ciceronian idea of the civitas as an arena of neutral public space above private family and tribal connections; on Roman law notions of contract (obligatio) and partnership (societas); and on the attempts of late medieval theorists to deﬁne and demarcate the respective spheres of divine, natural, and positive law.7 Throughout early modern Europe the idea of a ‘civil society’, meaning a collective public identity shaped by shared political and legal institutions, long preceded any conception of ‘society’ in the more modern sense, as a totality of self-sustaining social relationships distinct from any such politico-legal 6 Anthony Black, Guilds and Civil Society in European Political Thought from the Twelfth Century to the Present (Cambridge, 1984), xi–xii, 32–43, 76–8, 93–4, 96–109, 203–5; Anthony Black, ‘Concepts of Civil Society in Pre-modern Europe’, in Sudipta Kaviraj and Sunil Khilnani (eds.), Civil Society: History and Possibilities (Cambridge, 2001), 33–8; Fania Oz-Salzburger, ‘Civil Society in the Scottish Enlightenment’, in Kaviraj and Khilnani, 61, 78–83. 7 Otto Gierke, Political Theories of the Middle Age, trans. by F.

Much of the meaning of ‘civil society’ evolved negatively, from attempts to deﬁne what it was not: it was not the rule of clans, or patriarchs, or private militias, or the universal church, or charismatic personal leaders, though in practice it might contain and coexist with large residues of any or all of those forms of power. It was also typically couched in largely abstract terms, as a set of model principles often illustrated by historical examples, rather than a description of actual social arrangements at a particular moment of time. The ﬁrst systematic invocation of civil society in English came from the ‘Anglican’ theologian Richard Hooker, who at the end of the sixteenth century made use of the term in his attempt to construct an institutional via media between the theocratic claims of Calvinists and the Papacy, the ‘separatist’ claims of religious independents, and the ‘absolutist’ claims of secular kingship.8 Drawing upon the ideas of Aquinas and of late medieval ‘conciliar’ thought, Hooker’s Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity used the term ‘civill society’ interchangeably with ‘politique society’, ‘publique society’, and ‘civil regiment’,9 and made it clear that what he was referring to was a set of governing institutions exercising authority over a given national community. Such institutions were ‘voluntary’ only in the sense that all persons living under them were deemed to be doing so, not by force majeure or even force of habit, but by their own willed and rational ‘consent’. In the prior sphere of nature, ‘natural law’ was morally binding but in practice unenforceable: all were ‘defenders of themselves’, partial to their own interests, and judges in their own causes, with the result that ‘strife and troubles’ were ‘endless’. Dwellers in ‘natural society’ therefore agreed (tacitly or explicitly) to transfer defence of their persons and their interests to ‘some kind of regiment’ in the form of ‘civill society’.10 Civil society was thus the system of ‘public government’ that men were deemed to have placed themselves under for personal security, impartial judgement of disputes, material prosperity, and the enhancement of ‘sociability’ (the latter an attribute that Hooker believed to be latent in all mankind).11 The task of civil society was enforcement both of universal ‘natural laws’ and of ‘positive laws’ belonging to a particular time and polity. Such laws required an executive ‘prince or potentate’, but the ‘lawful power of making laws to command whole politique societies of men belongeth . . . properly to the same entire societies’.12 8 Richard Hooker, Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity, Book I (1593) in Folger Library Edition of the Works of Richard Hooker, ed. by W.

Among his own opponents he discerned many ‘whose betters amongst men would be hardly found’, but whose obsession with personal piety rendered them unﬁt and ‘unframable’ to perform their civic duties.16 In an ecclesiastical civil society no less than in a secular one, Hooker distinguished between immutable divine laws, and lesser matters of ceremonial taste and administrative convenience (permitting a degree of variation and ‘inclusion’ that was intended to reconcile religious pluralists both to the union of ‘politic society’ with the Church of England, and to the monarch’s governorship of the latter).17 This was a very ‘national’ view of civil society; but in Hooker’s account of both religious and secular civil societies there were nevertheless hints of a broader, more ‘internationalist’ dimension. As a remedy for contention over ‘polity, order, and regiment in the church’ he recommended a revival of the ‘general councils’ of churches throughout Christendom, that had lapsed since the later middle ages. And his account of secular civil society likewise stressed the advantages of sociability, not just between neighbours and fellow-countrymen, but in the form of ‘courteous entertainment of foreigners and strangers’, ‘commerce between grand societies’, ‘a kind of mutual society and fellowship even with all mankind’, and a citizenship ‘not of this or that commonwealth, but of the world’.18\n\nIII Hooker’s discussion of civil society was clearly addressed at least in part to the immediate Realpolitik of the Elizabethan church settlement.19 Nevertheless, his 13\n\n14 Ibid., i. 104. 15 Ibid., i. 137–9. 16 Ibid., i. 139–40.

Among them were the contrast between civil and natural society, the link of the former to the rise of ‘trafﬁc’ and ‘commerce’, the distinction between good men and good citizens, the search for a form of ﬂexible but structured ‘inclusion’, and his portrayal of natural human sociability as not just a psychological trait but something catalysed by ‘civil society’ into a powerful force for historical and socio-political change. Thomas Hobbes, writing half a century later in the context of the English civil wars, echoed several of Hooker’s central assumptions,20 though drawing from them starker, or more starkly expressed, conclusions. Like Hooker, Hobbes’s Leviathan and De Cive portrayed civil society as coterminous with effective governing institutions, embodied in the ‘Commonwealth’, the ‘Civitas’, the ‘City’, or the ‘civil state’.21 And, like Hooker, Hobbes portrayed ‘civil society’ as the obverse of a disorderly ‘state of nature’ in which men lived untrammelled by government. But, whereas in Hooker’s account clusters of small family groups might gradually evolve into civil societies, in Hobbes’s view ‘in all places, where men have lived by small families, to rob and spoil one another has been a trade’.22 Similarly Hobbes allowed much less room than Hooker for conscientious dissent. There could be no appeal to any ‘ghostly authority against the civil’; ‘private men’ who pretended to be ‘supernaturally inspired’ caused the ‘dissolution of all civil government’; and it was a ‘doctrine repugnant to civil society . . . that whatsoever a man does against his conscience, is sin’.23 Hobbes like Hooker portrayed the route out of natural conﬂict into civil society as embodied in a compact or contract; but the parties to Hobbes’s compact were driven by no admixture of Hooker’s ‘convenience’ and ‘sociability’, simply by fear, or acquiescence in physical force. There was also a marked difference in the status of Hobbes’s sovereign authority: whereas Hooker’s prince was himself subject to positive law, and his subjects gave such law their continuing consent, Hobbes’s sovereign (whether a prince or a popular assembly) was no party to the compact that brought civil society into being, nor was he (or it) bound by civil society’s laws.24 Hobbes’s ‘civil society’ may therefore sound like an obtuse parody of what many of its protagonists were to understand by the term at the end of the twentieth century. The whole thrust of his argument was deeply opposed to any suggestion that there could be an independent societal counterweight to sovereign 20 Though it is unlikely that Hooker was a direct inﬂuence on Hobbes, who would have found societas civilis in Bodin, Grotius, and other writers on Roman and civil law. 21 Both Leviathan and De Cive made many references to ‘civil society’. The Latin version of De Cive (The Citizen), published in Paris in 1642, appeared in translation in 1651, then was not republished in English until the 1840s. It reveals even more than Leviathan the extent to which Hobbes equated ‘civil society’ with governing institutions, and his debt to Roman civil law (Thomas Hobbes, De Cive; or, Philosophicall Rudiments concerning Government and Society, ed. by Howard Warrender (Oxford, 1983). The term ‘City’ was frequently used by civil society theorists throughout the 17th and 18th centuries to mean not an urban community but a polity or polis. 22 Leviathan, ed. by M. Oakeshott (Oxford, 1957), 109, 155. 23 Ibid., 211, 212, 214–15. 24 Ibid., 212.\n\nPolitical Thought, Hooker to Laski 19 power. The role of intermediate, self-governing corporations (such as universities and chartered trading companies) was viewed with deep suspicion, as a form of incipient conspiracy against the public interest;25 and ‘civil society’ itself was embedded in, indeed largely synonymous with, the overarching structures of law, government, and public administration. The element of consent had no reference to ongoing popular endorsement of laws, merely to tacit acceptance of the original compact.26 Hobbes’s system not merely favoured an Erastian church establishment but saw any deviation from outward conformity as a menace to civil peace; the main practical purpose of religion was to make men ‘the more apt to obedience, laws, peace, charity and civil society’.27 There were, nevertheless, certain features of Hobbes’s polity that suggested a rather different slant, and which did not altogether foreclose upon the kind of diversity and autonomy that many later authorities were to look for in civil society. One of these was ‘the silence of the laws’, by which men were deemed free to do anything that their sovereign had not explicitly forbidden (which might in practice allow for almost unlimited associational life below the political sphere).28 Another was Hobbes’s claim that civil society was concerned only with ‘the conservation of men in multitudes’: in other words, self-destructive private acts might be forbidden by the law of nature, but civil institutions were not concerned with enforcement of personal virtue or enhancement of private good.29\n\nIV The version of civil society set out in John Locke’s Two Treatises of Government (composed as an oblique contribution to the royal succession debates of the 1670s and 1680s) contained many resonances of the earlier models of both Hooker and Hobbes.30 It was none the less more complex and multi-layered than either, particularly in the fact that Locke’s account addressed not just the threat of conﬂict among warring individuals but the possible abuse of power by the civil authority set up to mediate between them.31 A group of men who in a state of nature were free, equal, and had a right to acquire whatever they could in the way of material goods, were deemed to have entered voluntarily into a pact or agreement, to protect their persons and possessions from each other and from external aggression. This agreement transformed a mere ‘number’ or ‘aggregate’ of men into ‘one People, one Body Politick under one Supreme Government’— the latter consisting of a legislature, an executive, and a system of ‘Law and Judicature’ for settling disputes by ‘standing rules’ that applied equally to all 25\n\n26 De Cive, 135–6. 27 Leviathan, 73.

Wherever such a transformation took place, wrote Locke, ‘there and there only is a Political, or Civil Society’.33 Thus far, Locke’s account largely coincided with the story set out by Hobbes, but it then diverged in a number of fundamental ways. Unlike Hobbes, Locke was very far from allowing that all forms of government which effectively maintained civil peace automatically constituted civil societies. On the contrary, absolute governments not bound by positive law could not be seen as genuine civil societies, even where they did successfully keep the peace. This was because of the lurking danger that the sovereign power itself, if unanswerable to any process of legal appeal and popular consent, might threaten the property and persons of its subjects: people could ‘never be safe nor at rest, nor think themselves in Civil Society, till the Legislature was placed in collective Bodies of Men, call them Senate, Parliament, or what you please’.34 Locke would have nothing to do with Hobbes’s view that an individual’s goods and services were legitimately at the disposal of the sovereign at any time; on the contrary ‘the chief end’ of civil society was precisely the protection of those ‘Lives, Liberties and Estates, which I call by the general Name, Property’.35 On both consent and property rights, Locke’s account was much closer to that of Hooker than of Hobbes; but there was a third point on which he differed from them both, and that was the relation of civil society to the organs of ‘civil government’. That Locke, no less than his predecessors, viewed civil society as coterminous with ‘political society’ and as embodied in the different branches of government, cannot be doubted;36 but nevertheless, while the dissolution of civil society automatically brought about the collapse of governing institutions, Locke denied that the opposite was necessarily true. Where breakdown of government led to anarchy, or where ‘Conquerours Swords . . . cut up Governments by the Roots, and mangle Societies to pieces’, then there was little point in pretending that civil society survived.37 But Locke seemed to envisage that there might well be cases where a mere temporary hiatus in government occurred, arising either from a ruler’s abuse of trust or simply from the fact that a particular legislature was of limited duration. In such a case, there was no instantaneous reversion to nature, and the ‘Body of the People’ remained a ‘Society’ able to act as its own ‘proper Umpire’.38 The ﬁrst act of such a ‘Society’, Locke believed, would be to\n\n32\n\nLocke, Two Treaties, 367–8. Ibid., 368. 34 Ibid., 373. Thus Locke believed that France under Louis XIV, perceived by many as the epitome of ‘civilized’ society, was nevertheless not a ‘civil society’ because of the large element of arbitrary royal power, and attacks on the rights of Huguenot subjects. 35 Leviathan, 213; Two Treatises, 366, 395. 36 John Dunn, ‘The Contemporary Signiﬁcance of John Locke’s Conception of Civil Society’, in Kaviraj and Khilnani, Civil Society: History and Possibilities, 39–47. 37 Two Treatises, 454, 459. 38 Ibid., 476. 33\n\nPolitical Thought, Hooker to Laski 21 set up new political institutions, particularly a legislative body, without which social life could not survive. But there was an interesting sleight of language here between ‘civil government’, ‘civil society’, and mere ‘society’; suggesting perhaps the dawn of an idea that, conceptually if not in practice, there might be a ﬁne distinction to be drawn between ‘Society’ (as a group of people with a communal identity) and ‘Civil Society’ (as the institutional framework of legislation, government, and enforcement of rights).39\n\nV Many recent interpreters have identiﬁed the eighteenth century as the period in which civil society (in many of its ‘modern’ connotations) ﬁrst materialized in many parts of Western Europe, and particularly in England and Scotland. Markets and communications, urban living and ‘policing’, conversation and good manners, philanthropic and voluntary associations, and ideas about civil equality—all have been seen as hallmarks of a new kind of self-regulating ‘public sphere’, distinct from family and private life but distinct also from the seats of government and royal courts which had deﬁned and dominated national life in earlier eras.40 Such changes manifested themselves rather more patchily than is often supposed, but none the less there is overwhelming evidence that alert contemporaries were themselves conscious of living within a new kind of social order. Many of those who commented on such changes at the time also made use of the language of civil society, which ceased to be conﬁned to the realm of high theory and became part of the everyday currency of sermons, salons, poetry, journalism, morality, and the market-place.41 In the process of popularization, civil society took on certain new meanings, with manuals on polite behaviour (often translated or adapted from the French) offering ‘Maxims for Civil Society’, ‘Reﬂexions on the ridiculous in civil society’, and model anecdotes on ‘morality, history, politics and the various events of life’ as affording ‘inexhaustible sources of Polite Conversation’.42 A denizen of civil society in this new sense of the term should avoid jesting ‘with Country Folks and Fools’, practise ‘vertuous Celibacy’ as against ‘the fashionable and barefac’d example of the Grand Monde’, and facilitate rational intercourse by cultivating ‘Discretion’, ‘Complaisance’, ‘Good Humour’, and ‘Sincerity’ (though opinion differed on\n\n39\n\n40 See Introduction, above, pp. 2–3, 8–9.

Nevertheless, although the new politeness certainly impinged upon the language of political thought, it was never its main constituent. On the contrary, political and legal theorists, economists and philosophers in eighteenth-century Britain continued to identify civil society as the ‘frame’ or ‘framework’ of legal and governing institutions that made private and voluntaristic social and commercial developments conceivable and possible. Despite a slowly emerging, somewhat hazy awareness of a new thing called ‘society’, in these more systematic writings ‘civil’ society meant, as it had done in earlier thought, not private life nor the new extra-governmental public sphere, but the organs and powers of the state as the indispensable progenitor and guardian of those lesser afﬁliations. Nor was it seen as something peculiar to the new commercial age; it was detected wherever there was a settled polity ruled by impartial laws (thus China, for example, was seen as a civil society because it had been governed for many centuries by a rational bureaucracy and a uniﬁed system of law, despite its social and commercial stagnation).44 This traditional, constitution-centred, understanding of civil society was evident even in the writings of those most acutely conscious of the onset of powerful self-generating forces of social change. Bernard de Mandeville’s inﬂuential The Fable of the Bees (1714) notoriously conjured up a picture of ‘the Social System’ as a vast interlocking network of mutual exchange relationships, in which even pathological pressures such as vice, vanity, and greed all contributed to the functioning of the social whole: ‘the whole Superstructure is made up of the reciprocal services which men do to each other’. This may sound like the description of a new kind of ‘spontaneous social order’ independent of government, but Mandeville was very insistent that this was not what was meant. On the contrary, civil society was explicitly a ‘Body Politick’. ‘Laws and Government are to the Political Bodies of Civil Societies, what the Vital Spirits and Life itself are to the Natural Bodies of Animated Creatures’: and ‘no species of Animals is, without the Curb of Government, less capable of agreeing long together in Multitudes than that of Man’.45 David Hume, writing in the lowlands of Scotland a generation later, poured scorn on the stereotype of distinguishing ‘civil’ from ‘natural’ institutions—both were equally the invention of men, and ‘civil society’ was the product not of abstractions like ‘consent’ and\n\n43 Reﬂexions upon . . .

He argued that ‘civil society’ had evolved historically and incrementally from a mixture of sociability, selfinterest, and family life; but once again its deﬁning medium was the emergence of formal governing and law-making institutions.48 A rather different perspective appeared to be suggested by Adam Smith, who went further than any of his contemporaries in elaborating the idea that a ‘society’ might have internal relations and dynamics that could be steered only very remotely by government and politics—‘in the great chess-board of human society, every single piece has a principle of motion of its own, altogether different from that which the legislature might chuse to impress upon it’.49 But by ‘society’ (a term that he employed frequently and loosely) Smith usually meant something quite different from ‘civil society’ (a term that he employed very sparingly and always in conjunction with government and law-enforcement).50 ‘The public magistrate is under a necessity of employing the power of the commonwealth to enforce the practice of . . . [justice]. Without this precaution, civil society would become a scene of bloodshed and disorder, every man revenging himself at his own hand whenever he fancied he was injured . . . the magistrate, in all governments that have acquired any considerable authority, undertakes to do justice to all.’51 As a rule, Smith maintained, the growth of civil society (i.e. government) and the growth of society were mutually reinforcing; but there was also a recurrent hint in Smith’s writings of civil society acting as a form of moral safety-net against the dangerous exuberance of mere ‘society’. It was a means by which the genuine ‘citizen’ (‘disposed to respect the laws and to obey the civil magistrate’) might stand out against the transiently ‘fashionable and popular’ and promote thereby ‘the welfare of the whole society of his fellow-citizens’.52\n\n46 David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature (1739) ed. by Ernest C.

A much stronger version of this stress on civic morality came from Smith’s Scottish contemporary Adam Ferguson, whose An Essay on the History of Civil Society (1767) tried to fuse together the new language of sociability and commerce with an older ideal of ‘active and strenuous’ personal loyalty and service to a small close-knit community.53 Ferguson rejected the ‘atomistic’ model of man latent in Smith and the ‘social compact’ theorists. Instead, human beings were born to live in groups and were far more likely to become isolated and fearful in advanced commercial societies than in more intimate and primitive ones.54 The genesis of civil society came not from competition and fear between neighbours, but from common defence against an external enemy; it was organization for war that gave rise initially to obedience to a personal leader, and thence to the specialized structures of the legalistic modern state. It was not inclusiveness and universalism but differentiation against an external ‘other’ that gave the inhabitants of civil society, particularly its menfolk, their sense of purpose and cohesion; and throughout Ferguson’s narrative there ran a powerful thread of the ‘civic republican’ tradition in political thought which many commentators have seen as the obverse of civil society.55 Property, trade, competition, and specialization of functions—all brought about by civil society and government—were in Ferguson’s view essential to the advance of prosperity, knowledge, and the arts: but there was also an everpresent danger that civil society might become the victim of its own success, that security and luxury would sap the sources of civic patriotism and virtue and ‘the occasion of farther exertion be removed’.56 More than any other writer on civil society, Ferguson rejected the distinction made by earlier theorists between the law-abiding citizen and the good man; the strength of a nation, he argued, depended above all on ‘the character of its people’, and ‘the most important lesson of civil society’ was the habit of ‘implicit obedience’ to a leader in times of danger.57 Ferguson’s Essay was to be published in seven editions over the course of the eighteenth century, and was translated into several European languages. It was particularly popular in Germany, where it has been credited with inﬂuencing the semantic migration of the concept of civil society away from state and government into the arena of competitive private interests (the bürgerliche Gesellschaft\n\n53 Adam Ferguson, An Essay on the History of Civil Society, ed. by Fania Oz-Salzburger (Cambridge, 1995). 54 History of Civil Society, 23–4. 55 Ibid., 24–9, 45–50, 246–7. 56 Ibid., 168, 212, 241; for a critique of the frequent confusion between ‘civil society’ and ‘civic republican’ ideas in recent thought, see Adam B.

In British discourse civil society remained ﬁrmly attached to ideas about law, government, and the constitution—with the main theoretical debate coming to rest on whether civil society and its institutions were rooted in contract, utility, or natural rights.59 Throughout the eighteenth century the concept was frequently invoked on ceremonial public occasions, such as assize sermons, loyal addresses, and patriotic celebrations, to remind audiences of the legitimacy of ‘limited’ monarchy, the links of government with natural and divine as well as positive law, and the moral duty of both civil and religious obedience.60 Such resonances were reinforced after 1789 by the onset of revolutionary upheaval in France. More explicitly than ever before ‘Albion’ was depicted as the locus classicus of civil society, France as the unhappy victim of deluded notions of primordial rights, and George III himself was portrayed in some quarters as civil society’s ideal ‘impartial magistrate’, revered for his slogan of ‘My Ofﬁce before my Person’.61 It would be a mistake to suggest, however, that such developments were uniformly uncritical and conformist in tone; indeed a striking feature of the civil society theme in late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Britain was its invocation in support of a very wide spectrum of political causes and beliefs. Although it was used to defend property and obedience, the idea of a civil society—embodying popular consent, and an entitlement to have certain inalienable rights defended by civil government—was also employed in radical rhetoric to attack slavery and the slave-trade, to defend habeas corpus, and to champion the claims of the destitute to statutory public relief.62 This latter theme was a 58 Ibid., introduction, xvii; Fania Oz-Salzberger, ‘Civil Society in the Scottish Enlightenment’; Kaviraj and Khilnani, Civil Society, History and Possibilities, 78–9. Ferguson’s German inﬂuence was particularly marked, however, in Tönnies’s famous dichotomy of ‘Gemeinschaft’ and ‘Gesellschaft’, which adhered to the traditional view that civil society included the institutions of the state (Ferdinand Tönnies, Community and Civil Society, ed. by Jose Harris (Cambridge, 2001), xxi, xxxvi, 64). 59 Thomas Gisborne, The Principles of Moral Philosophy investigated, and brieﬂy applied to the Constitution of Civil Society (1795). 60 Robert Burrow, Civil Society and Government vindicated from the charge of being founded on, and preserv’d by, dishonest arts (1723); George Fothergill, ‘The Importance of Religion to Civil Societies’, in Nine Sermons on Severall Occasions (Oxford, 1734–5); Richard Green, The Beneﬁt of Oaths to Civil Society considered (1744); George Horne, The Inﬂuence of Christianity on Civil Society (Oxford, 1773); William Langford, Obedience to the established Laws and respect to the person of the Administrator are the joint support of Civil Society (1793). 61 Gisborne, Principles of Moral Philosophy, 307; Langford, Obedience to the established laws, 5–7; Payne Knight, Progress of Civil Society, 150–1; Ode on the Fluctuations of Civil Society; W.

George III was reputed to have uttered these words when insisting that an assize procession headed by a judge should take precedence over the royal coach. 62 Thomas Gisborne, Remarks on the late decision of the House of Commons, respecting ABOLITION of the SLAVE TRADE (1792), and below, Ch. 3; Frederick Page, The Principle of the English Poor Laws Illustrated and Defended, by an Historical View of Indigence in Civil Society (Bath, 1822).\n\n26 Jose Harris recurrent strand in debate on the English Poor Laws, with Tom Paine in the 1790s and William Cobbett in the 1820s arguing that a public relief system was a necessary corollary to that ‘safeguarding of private property’ which many viewed as civil society’s primary rationale. Such communal protection in time of need was ‘essential to the lawfulness of civil society’, wrote Cobbett in The Poor Man’s Friend, since it was inconceivable that rational beings would have relinquished their natural right to fend for themselves on any other terms. ‘Before this state of civil society, the starving, the hungry, the naked man, had a right to go and provide himself with necessaries wherever he could ﬁnd them . . . When civil society was established, it is impossible to believe that it had not in view some provision for these destitute persons . . . The contrary supposition would argue, that fraud was committed upon the mass of the people in forming this civil society . . . It is impossible to believe this. Men never gave their assent to enter into society on terms like these.’63\n\nVI ‘Civil society’ was thus a commonplace in much social and political discourse of eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Britain, widely used both in writings on high theory and in pulpits, drawing-rooms, and popular oratory. From the 1820s onwards, however, its currency began to dwindle in all these contexts, surviving often as little more than a conventional synonym for civilization, the constitution, or the ‘rule of law’. The reasons for this decline are not fully clear, though it may have been linked to the emergence of new and more precise conceptions of ‘the state’, ‘government’, ‘local government’, and their respective public roles.64 The term was avoided by Jeremy Bentham and John Austin, who preferred to speak of ‘political society’ (‘political’ being perhaps less imbued with non-utilitarian notions of social contract and natural rights).65 Despite certain similarities of language, ‘civil society’ was not used by the disciples of Dr Thomas Chalmers and other early Victorian proponents of civic philanthropy and voluntary self-help.66 Nor, despite their debt to the broad-based labour and 63 William Cobbett, The Poor Man’s Friend (1829), paras. 10–11; Thomas A. Horne, Property Rights and Poverty. Political Argument in Britain 1605–1834 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1990), 201–51. 64 See Ch. 2, below. Other possibilities are that ‘civil society’ became associated with postrevolutionary French uses of the term, and with the spread on the continent of Roman law-based civil codes, perceived by English commentators at this time as inimical to personal liberties—a large theme, beyond the scope of this chapter. 65 Jeremy Bentham, A Fragment on Government, 2nd edn. (1823), in The Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham, ed. by J. H. Burns (1977), 425–48; John Austin, The Province of Jurisprudence Determined (1832), ed. and intro. by H. L. A. Hart (1965), 193–202, 211–12, 217–18. 66 Chalmers had used ‘civic economy’ to describe ‘voluntarist’ assistance to poor families, and ‘civil government’ to describe what many of his contemporaries referred to as civil society, i.e. government and law-enforcement (Thomas Chalmers, The Importance of Civil Government to Society, and the Duty of Christians in regard to it (Glasgow, 1820); The Christian and Civil Economy of Large Towns (Liverpool, 1823).\n\nPolitical Thought, Hooker to Laski 27 property theories of Locke, was civil society part of the vocabulary of Owenite socialists, the co-operative movement, early trades unionists, or the Chartists. Similarly it played little explicit part in the new language of colonization and empire, where earlier discussions that had assumed the timeless universality of civil societies, or at least their universally latent possibility, gave way to a much more relativist sense that they were fragile and historically unusual.67 This did not mean that civil society wholly vanished from British political thought, but that for many Victorian thinkers it was a much less potent theme than it had been in earlier periods. Evidence both of what was understood by the term and its diminishing purchase may be noted in the writings of John Stuart Mill. Mill was closely familiar with civil society debates of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (familiar not merely with their political substance but with the various philosophical and theological nuances that lay behind them). His essay on Coleridge, composed in the late 1830s, contained a brief but suggestive digression on the origins of civil societies and the problems involved in maintaining them. In Mill’s view, civil society—which he deﬁned as ‘the very ﬁrst element of the social union, obedience to a government of some sort’—was much more difﬁcult to establish and much easier to fall away from than was usually supposed. So great was the repugnance of ‘brave and warlike’ men to submitting their natural freedom to a ‘common umpire’ that early civil societies had always been ascribed to a divine origin. In more complex cultures, the survival of civil society depended on maintaining a ﬁne-tuned balance between ‘habitual submission to law and government’ and the ‘vigour and manliness of character’ that would initially have resisted any such submission (a clear echo here of the civil society/civic republican paradox of Adam Ferguson). Such a conjunction was in turn dependent on what Mill identiﬁed as three ‘essential requisites’. These were, ﬁrst, ‘a system of education . . . of which . . . one main and incessant ingredient was restraining discipline’. The second was a ‘feeling of allegiance, or loyalty’ to some transcendent idea—be it God, a constitution, or a set of laws or principles, ‘which men agreed in holding sacred’. And the third was a sense of common national identity—not ‘vulgar’ nationalism, but ‘a strong and active principle of cohesion among the members of the same community or state’, whereby no part of the inhabitants ‘consider[ed] themselves as foreigners with regard to another part’. Institutions which embodied these core principles, even in an antiquated form, ‘could not without great peril be left vacant’—as could be discerned from the disastrous policies of the French Revolution, which had thrown away ‘the shell without preserving the kernel’ and attempted to ‘new-model society without the binding forces which hold society together’.68 Mill was sufﬁciently pleased with this passage to reproduce it some years later in A System of Logic, where he used it to demonstrate the importance of an understanding of history to a ‘general science of society’.69 Yet ‘civil society’ was 67 68\n\nJ. S. Mill, Collected Works (Toronto, 1969), x. 136; xviii. 119–47; Ch. 15, below. 69 J. S. Mill, A System of Logic (1843), in Collected Works, viii. 921–4. Ibid., x. 132–8.\n\n28 Jose Harris not a term that Mill invoked in his later more overtly political writings, and at no time did he identify it with pluralism, voluntary association, franchise extension, or secularization of public institutions—though all these causes were closely linked with his name, and were to feature prominently in historical portrayals of Victorian civil society a hundred and ﬁfty years later.70 Mill’s analysis seemed to conﬁrm that civil society per se was still understood in a British context as referring to the realm of government and the state (and as such was simply taken for granted by most people). But it also implied that it was coming to be seen as part of the much larger and more elusive entity to which it had given birth—i.e. the totality of human relationships, or ‘society in general’. A similar emphasis on civil society as ‘ultimate political authority’, but with hints of further subsidiary meanings, appeared spasmodically in other writings of the Victorian era. Henry Maine in Ancient Law (1861) brieﬂy reverted to the subject in order to expound a cyclical interpretation of economic history. In Maine’s account, ‘civil society’ had surfaced wherever large-scale, multicultural, trading polities had superseded and swallowed up small-scale patriarchal ones—the prime example being the absorption of such petty communities, including the city of Rome itself, into the Roman empire. The motor behind civil society was not mutual fear but the imperative of harmonizing and legally regulating the processes of international trade. Its central principle was to lay down general rules, which treated individuals as subjects and agents rather than as members of tribal or status groups; and its characteristic device was the contract—not the ‘social contract’ of Hooker, Hobbes, and Locke, but the mutual exchange of"
