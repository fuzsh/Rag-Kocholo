Without her devotion and generous support this collection could not have been. We are fortunate in having found in Irving Louis Horowitz a knowledgeable and appreciative colleague and publisher. Anita Stock’s and Esther M. Luckett’s careful attention to the editorial process at every stage was crucial in bringing the manuscript to its final form. The Editors\n\nvii\n\nIntroduction: Werner J. Cahnman on the Historical Sociology of the Jews In 1935, two years into his self-exile from Nazi Germany and settled temporarily in Zurich before his permanent exile in America, Thomas Mann made the following entry in his diary: Had a visitor this afternoon, a Dr. Cahnman from Munich, young Jew, of delightful southern German disposition, and very smart to boot. We had some interesting but depressing discussions about the goings-on in Germany which lasted until almost 8 o ’clock in the evening.1\n\nThe young Jew of Bavarian charm and keen intelligence who thus impressed the world-famous writer was Werner J. Cahnman. He went on to become a fellow refugee and sociologist in America, a proponent of comparative historical sociology, ethnicity, and intercultural relations, and a Tönnies scholar. After Hitler’s ascent to power in 1933, Cahnman had undertaken several clandestine missions on behalf of his beleaguered people, especially the Jewish communities of the southern German region. It was probably on one such occasion that he payed a visit to Mann. Werner Cahnman would have been the first to admit that such a friendly get-together and man-to-man talk would hardly have taken place under normal circumstances back in Munich. By 1935, though, things were anything but normal, and the same social rules applied no more. Albeit for different reasons, both Thomas Mann and Werner Cahnman found themselves excluded from the “ New Order,’’ and both, in turn, did what the order of the day demanded of them. All things considered, Cahnman was for Mann a source of reliable information about what was happening in Germany in general, and in Munich—erstwhile hometown of Thomas Mann—in particular. The unfolding political and social crises in Germany led to young Cahnman’s ever more intense absorption in Jewish learning and Jewish political and social activities. As Syndikus to the Central verein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens, teacher at the Jüdisches Lehrhaus, voluntary “ social worker’’ (as he called himself at the time), and, after 1934, as “ a leader of an illegal organization” who was briefly thrown into the Munich police prison, he gained first-hand experience with the “ New Order,’’ its ideologies and its ix\n\nх\n\nGerman Jewry\n\npraxis. Cahnman was, however, more than a social worker and man of intense community concern; he was also a shrewd participant-observer and astute analyst. What he said about himself some forty-odd years later may go a long way toward explaining and evaluating Werner Cahnman’s concerns and writings from the 1930s on. In his review of Mario Cuomo’s book Forest Hills Diary—The Crisis of Low Income Housing (1975), in which he figures as Cuomo’s “ sociologist friend from Forest Hills,’’ Cahnman states: I am a Forest Hills [instead of Munich] resident, a sociologist who is a race and intercultural relations specialist, and I am active in Jewish life. It goes without saying that I am aware of the complexities of urban living. I believe I know of the needs [of the newcomers] as well as of the aspirations of the neighbors in the midst of whom I live.2\n\nIndeed, Cahnman’s essays, studies, and monographs—published and unpublished -dealing with Jewish history, community and family history, JewishGentile relations, Jewish leaders and thinkers, and, last but not least, the once-existing German-Jewish symbiosis, attest to his awareness and deep understanding of the complexities and problems inherent in his chosen themes. As to why he devoted a great part of his life and scholarship to the examination of the various facets of Jewish Diaspora life, Cahnman’s most likely answer would have been that it was the times and themes that chose him. Scattered throughout his related writings we find the sense of urgency to record, to document, to tell, and to elevate to ideal-typical status the tribulations and ultimate fate of big-city and small-town Jewish communities, including his own family. Werner Cahnman looked at the late 1920s of the Weimar Republic as the time when exciting things happened, full of “ intellectual controversy,’’ but also the time when “ public affairs’’ took a discouraging turn. The 1920s also witnessed—at least in Germany—an abandonment of hope for meaningful political action and the collectivities’ inward turn. As far as the Jewish communities were concerned, he noted that “ Jewish themes pure and simple came to the fore,’’ as the 1920s in general saw a revival of Jewish consciousness. For example, there was a large increase in the membership of the Centralverein, the principal Jewish civic defense organization; the Jewish Lehrhaus movement gained momentum, and there were many books on the essence of Judaism, the meaning of Jewish history, and Jewish philosophy and mysticism by Leo Baeck, Franz Rosenzweig, Martin Buber, and others. All the while, there was in Bavaria a concoction of separatist, nationalist, clerical, and racial sentiments that put its stamp on post-World War I Munich life and made the city appear more antisemitic than ever before. It was only in the late 1920s that the Catholic Church and its party recognized that Hitler’s movement stood against Christian values as well as against popular govern-\n\nIntroduction\n\nxi\n\nment and Bavarian autonomy, but by that time it was too late to halt the tide. Thus Cahnman felt a special urgency to collect data and describe Jewish life in order to preserve what otherwise would be irretrievably lost. His efforts were facilitated by his fatherly “ inheritance,” namely, a “ historical enthusiasm” that made him collect family- and community-related data “ since early youth, partly by consulting archives,” interviewing older relatives, and so on.3 It is safe to say that one of his last full-scale works, Jews and Gentiles: The Historical Sociology of Their Relations (unpublished manuscript), had been germinating ever since. Werner Cahnman’s concise statement on the whys and hows of this study also describes his lifelong preoccupations: I have been working on a comprehensive, yet concentrated, account of JewishGentile relations for a long time. I believe that a scholarly conceived yet fluidly written account of [these] relations is essential for the self-understanding of the present generation. The topic of the Jewish experience among the peoples in the midst of whom Jews live is not identical, although it is overlapping, with the usual histories of antisemitism. If the focus is on antisemitism, Jewish history is made to appear as if it were a record of unmitigated hostility against the Jewish people and of passivity on the part of the Jews. Jewish-Gentile relations refer to the mutuality of contacts, positive as well as antagonistic, even if conflict situations continue to require particular attention. [This account follows] a historical sequence, [but it] is sociological in concep tion. [It looks at the] patterns [that] are recognizable as common to all, or almost all, ages and places in which Jewish history has been enacted.4\n\nWerner Cahnman’s life came full circle in the 1970s, when he branched out from scholarship to promote intercultural relations and preservation of the Jewish past in a direct, practical way: Acting on his deeply felt conviction that after the obliteration of Jewish communities and institutions all around Europe, it was imperative that still-remaining, visible testimonies of the past be saved, he called upon his peers to establish the Rashi Association for the Preservation of Jewish Cultural Monuments in Europe. He designated Germany as the first and foremost place of activity because “ the aim of Hitler to obliterate all traces of Jewish life from German soil must be frustrated.” 5 Just as importantly, the sites which will be thus salvaged—places where Jews have lived and prayed and gone to school and buried their dead—will serve the future. As he wrote: “ They must serve as pillars of the new Jewish consciousness which is to arise out of the memories of the past.” Moreover, Cahnman thought that visible signs of Jewish continuity would have a significant psychological and educational impact: Gentiles in all these countries\n\nxii\n\nGerman Jewry\n\nwould be made to realize that Jewish history was part and parcel of their own, their country’s history. Just as in his hometown back in the 1930s, with Werner Cahnman community concerns, scholarly endeavors, and Jewish activism always and everywhere went hand-in-hand. The Man Werner Jacob Cahnman was bom in Munich on 30 September 1902 into an upper-middle-class Jewish family. His father, by then director of a chemical factory, was bom in a small village, Rheinbischofsheim. He had come to Munich to get an education and finally settled there. The family of Cahnman’s mother, on the other hand, belonged to the Munich haute bourgeoisie. His uncle, Anton SchUlein, was a famous Munich painter; other members of the family were bankers, jurists, or industrialists. As recounted in an (unpublished) autobiographical essay,6 Cahnman was exposed to two very different kinds of Judaism. His father’s people held on to family and community values and displayed a somewhat rustic and folksy Judaism but no Jewish learning. The learned and highly cultured members of his mother’s family were Jewish in a declaratory sense only; their free-thinking Judaism had a strong ethical bent. His mother was well-versed in Spinoza and Mendelssohn, but she had no use for dietary laws; nevertheless, she respected her husband’s traditional values and helped to observe the Friday eve and Passover rituals. Cahnman’s poignant summary of her fate shows the fragility of the position, and even the very existence, of the assimilated German-Jewish bourgeoisie: “ The main idea of my mother was,’’ said Cahnman, “ that everybody, but especially the Jews, should promote justice in the world. She died in Piaski, Poland in unimaginably terrible circumstances and in a situation of utmost injustice.’’7 Werner Cahnman received his secondary education in the classical atmosphere of a Munich Gymnasium. He said he could recall no disagreeable experience in school; he thought his classmates liked him but were aware that he was Jewish, and he was “ aware of their awareness.’’ Cahnman grew up in an environment that put Kultur above everything else, where artists, intellectuals, professionals, and businessmen met and discussed the most diverse ideas, issues, and problems of the day, ranging from literature and the arts to socialism, Zionism, and women’s issues. From a father, who was a traditionalist, a vice president and later president of the local chapter of B’nai B’rith, and an aunt, a well-known writer of stories about everyday Jewish life, Cahnman also learned to appreciate the feeling of belonging to a Gemeinschaft. Such diverse exposures put their indelible stamp on his views, scholarship, and preoccupations. From 1921 to 1927, Cahnman studied economics, history, political science, and sociology at Berlin and at Munich universities. He wrote his dis-\n\nIntroduction\n\nxiii\n\nsertation, Der ökonomische Pessimismus und das Ricardo'sehe System (1927; published in 1929), under the sponsorship of the noted exponent of Sozial· politik, Professor Zwiedineck-Südenhorst. It may be of some historical interest that one of Cahnman’s fellow students at the latter’s seminars was Rudolf Hess. Cahnman’s impressions of Hess, written up in an (unpublished) essay entitled “ Rudolf Hess as a Symbol,’’8 portray the future deputy of the Führer as the prototype of a war-tom generation, now dipping into old-time romanticism and about to conceive an imperialist dream; Hess was a symbol of the forces that were operating and foreshadowing the catastrophe that was to follow. Parallel with his university studies went Cahnman’s abiding interest in the tribulations of the Jewish Diaspora in general, and in present-day concerns in particular. Still a teenager, he read widely and indiscriminately everything relating to things Jewish. The most profound influence on his thinking at the time was made by Arthur Ruppin’s Juden der Gegenwart (English version: The Jews in the Modern World, London, 1934) and by Theodor Herzl’s Zionist writings along with Davis Trietsch’s Palästina-Handbuch. As a consequence, he developed a strong interest in demography and started to collect data on conversion, intermarriage, declining birthrates, and other matters relating to the continuity and vitality of the Jewish community; at the same time he made himself an expert of sorts on the early settlements in Palestine. During his university years, his interests shifted increasingly towards Jewish learning, philosophy, and direct political activity. He thoroughly absorbed the writings of Leo Baeck, Franz Rosenzweig, Martin Buber, Graetz, Dubnow, Achad Haam, and Edmond Fleg, among others. He also mastered the antisemetic as well as the philo-Semitic literature of his time. His very first article, “ Judentum und Volksgemeinschaft,’’ published in Der Morgen in 1926, was a characteristic combination of elements: historiography, romantic philosophy, political democracy, and Jewish ethnicity. He met Buber in Munich and through his influence became first a student and later a lecturer at the Jüdisches Lehrhaus of Munich. After completing his university studies, Cahnman worked for a short time at his father’s chemical factory but soon moved on to Berlin where he became a research associate of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce (1928-29). For 1929-30 he was offered a research position at the Institute of World Economics in Kiel. The greatest challenge for Cahnman came when he was offered the position of Syndikus for Bavaria of the Centralverein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens, the major defense organization for German Jewry. Considering the situation of German Jewry in the year 1930, such a position obviously demanded maturity, experience, and confidence, to say nothing of considerable cunning and political savvy. The fact that the elder statesmen of the organization chose the 28-year-old Werner Cahnman shows how apt Thomas Mann\n\nxiv\n\nGerman Jewry\n\nwas in his appraisal of his young Jewish visitor. From day one, Cahnman was aware of the seriousness of the situation and the need for good defensive tactics on the part of the Central verein. Soon enough, it was a matter of survival, first of the organization itself—its offices were first ransacked and ultimately closed in the wake of the 1933 Machtergreifung— and increasingly of the Munich Jewish community. Cahnman was imprisoned for having continued his Centralverein work illegally but was soon freed thanks to the intervention of his one-time fellow student, Rudolf Hess. He described and analyzed his work and the events leading up to and following the closing of the Centralverein in Munich in his essay, “ The Jews in Munich: 1918— 1943,“ published in this volume. Until his escape from Germany in June 1939, Cahnman was working full-time for his beleaguered people in Munich and in the whole southern region. He often spoke of this period as his “ social worker“ years, although he was far more than that. These years saw several studies, beginning with the 1937 article, “ Warum Hebräisch lernen?“ in the Frankfurter Israelitisches Gemeindeblatt, and including “ Village and Small-Town Jews of Germany,” and “ Role and Significance of the Jewish Artisan Class,“ published many years later in America.9 But his main efforts, and most of his energies, were invested in saving records, keeping statistics, and doing battle with German officialdom to shore up Jewish community resources. Officially, he was the statistician of the Israelitische Kultusgemeinde of Munich, ostensibly a clerical position. The nature and scope of his activities, however, went far beyond that. He made common cause with, and sought to forge alliance among, the most diverse groups of people—Zionists, anti-Zionists, a variety of youth associations, and the Ostjuden—because he perceived the abiding need for strengthening bonds to face the advancing Nazi threat. In due course, he even became a severe critic of the Berlin leadership of the Centralverein because he considered its hyperpatriotic stance to be both unrealistic and undignified. By then, Cahnman had considerable experience as a liaison man; already in 1932 he had been charged by the Central verein with maintaining contact with Austrian sister organizations; in 1937, he visited Austria illegally in order to discuss the situation with religious leaders and scholars. In the spring of 1937, he went to Palestine where he met with—among others—Judah Magnes, president of the Hebrew University. But he abandoned plans for eventual settlement there, because he felt that his place was in Munich where help was badly needed. “ I was a Jewish official, after all,“ he explained. In that capacity, he organized the Berufsumschichtung (retraining) of young Jews who had lost their jobs; he participated in securing the food supply to the Jewish community and in counseling those embarking on emigration. His activities, legal and illegal, came to an abrupt end when in November 1938 he was sent to the Dachau concentration camp. He was released two months later\n\nIntroduction\n\nXV\n\non the condition that he emigrate. On 20 June 1939 Cahnman left Germany10 for England with a transit visa secured for him by the sponsorship of a distant relative and Bloomsbury House. In April 1940 Cahnman emigrated into the United States. His Americanization began almost immediately with a summer seminar for foreign scholars and teachers at the Brewster Free Academy, the Quaker School in Wolfboro, New Hampshire. Herbert A. Miller, the resident scholar, had evaluated Cahnman’s background and intellectual interests and declared him to be a “ race and culture specialist in sociology.’’ At Miller’s recommendation he then went to study as a visiting Ph.D. in the Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago. His teachers and later mentors were Everett Hughes, Herbert Blumer, Robert Redfield, and, above all, Robert E. Park. With the latter, Cahnman established a long relationship and friendship. Things did not work out that well with Louis Wirth, another Chicago sociologist and Jewish sociologist to boot. This was probably due to Cahnman’s survivalist perspective, projecting the survival of ethnic groups for both normative and empirical reasons. Wirth, on the other hand, held an assimilationist viewpoint. It was in Chicago, too, that Werner met and married Dr. Gisella Levi, a former Fermi student in Turin, Italy (and cousin of recent Nobel prize winner Dr. Rita Levi-Montalcini)11 who taught physics at that time in Chicago. In the years 1943-45, Cahnman was teaching sociology at Fisk and Vanderbilt universities in Nashville, Tennessee, followed by a short stretch at the University of Atlanta when Louis Wirth recommended him for the position of researcher at the National Jewish Welfare Board beginning in 1946. “ In a way, I was thus relegated to an [academic] backwater,’’ he wistfully remarked. It was the friendship and scholarly solidarity of such Jewish academics as Salo Baron or Mark Wischnitzer that sustained him in those trying years. There were others, such as Chaim Greenberg, editor of the (Labor Zionist) Jewish Frontier, who published many of his papers, or Henry Hurwitz, editor of the Menorah Journal, who did likewise. In the mid-1950s, Rabbi Mordecai M. Kaplan and Eugen Kohn asked Cahnman to join the editorial board of The Reconstructionist magazine although he could not be considered a proper Reconstructionist. Thus, somewhat belatedly, Cahnman did find his home in American Jewish life. Until his death, he fulfilled his editorial duties faithfully and also published extensively in that magazine. At the same time he held other positions, which helped him to ease into American life, such as senior evaluation analyst at the International Broadcasting Division of the State Department, and executive secretary of the Conference on Jewish Social Studies. No doubt the greatest satisfaction of the remaining two decades of his life was his finally making it in academia. First, he was a lecturer in sociology at\n\nχνί\n\nGerman Jewry\n\nHunter College (1956-59) and at Yeshiva University (1958-62). According to Cahnman, he was “ finally rescued for sociology” when Joseph B. Maier, then chairman of the Department of Sociology at the Newark College of Arts & Sciences, brought him to Rutgers University in 1961. He retired from Rutgers as full professor in 1968. He had also lectured at the New School for Social Research in New York City and was a visiting professor at his old alma mater in Munich as well as at the University of Michigan. Just as at the beginning of his career, the last years of Werner Cahnman’s life were filled with varied scholarly, professional and political-social activities. At this time too he tried to do justice to all of them. For sociology, he charted a new way as a founding member of the (first) Historical Sociology Section of the American Sociological Association and by publishing (with Alvin Boskoff) the seminal volume, Sociology and History (1964). It signified the final emergence of his systematic concern with the historical perspective in sociology. At the same time, Cahnman garnered recognition as a leading Tönnies scholar. In fact, he was already terminally ill with cancer when he delivered the principal address at the Tönnies Symposium in Kiel, West Germany (1980). All along, he was preoccupied with the conceptual clarification of the term stranger as used by many German scholars from Brentano to Tönnies to Simmel. Passionately, and at times somewhat cantankerously, he argued for the validity of the term Vermittler (as against pariah, used sociologically by Max Weber and psychologically by Hannah Arendt) in the case of the Jews of Europe; like Simmel, another German Jew, Cahnman thought of himself as an “ intermediary.” From a research trip to Israel, Cahnman brought back much archival data both for his ongoing project “ Jews and Gentiles” (completed before his death and hitherto unpublished) and other historical accounts he planned to write on Jewish life in Germany and Austria. He prominently participated in the work of Columbia’s “ University Seminar on Content and Methods of the Social Sciences,” and just as prominently organized and conducted the Conference on Intermarriage and Jewish Life, the proceedings of which were published under his editorship.12 Much of his remaining time he devoted to the establishment and work of the above-mentioned Rashi Association, playing an important role in the restoration of the Rashi Lehrhaus in Worms, Germany. Along with the four books he published in the last two decades of his life, Cahnman contributed dozens of articles in the field of general and Jewish sociology to journals in America and West Germany. His work on problems of ethnicity, and Jewish ethnicity in particular, were in some instances pathbreaking. When Jewish sociologists organized an Association for the Sociological Study of Jewry, Cahman served on the editorial board of its own organ, Contemporary Jewry. Shortly before his death, he published another\n\nIntroduction\n\nxvii\n\nsignificant contribution in the field, entitled “ Nature and Varieties of Ethnicity” (1980). Werner Jacob Cahnman died of cancer in Forest Hills, New York on 27 September 1980. He left behind two completed manuscripts, the abovementioned “ Jews and Gentiles: The Historical Sociology of Their Relation,” and an even more ambitious work on “ The History of Sociology,” both still awaiting publication.13 The Theme With the present volume, the editors present a representative anthology of Werner J. Cahnman’s research papers and scholarly essays on Jews and Judaism. Though diverse in thought and style, they share a common theme. Indeed, whether he explores the stratification of pre-Emancipation German Jewry, the rise of the Jewish national movement in Austria, or such an esoteric issue as the influence of the kabbalistic tradition on German idealist philosophy, or whether he muses on the writing of Jewish history or reports on his firsthand experience in the Dachau concentration camp, the bulk of Cahnman’s work reflects this central concern of his personal and scholarly existence. Because he often combines extensive empirical data with accounts drawing on his own background and personal experience, the result is a penetrating approach to the recent history of Jewish life in Central Europe. Cahnman’s concern and interest go beyond the descriptive analysis of the life and structure of the Jewish community he knew so intimately. He wanted to add one more piece to the large mosaic of Jewish Diaspora. He believed that the “ writing of history is vital for the continued cultural identity of the human kind.” The recorded story of its past, he thought, provides a people with that “ consciousness of the self which links the present and future generations to the preceding.” The importance of the writing of history becomes all the more obvious “ when a people is in the process of estrangement from the heritage of beliefs and customs and ceremonies which once sustained its existence.” 14 Clearly, Cahnman believed that at certain historical junctures history can serve as a “ lucid guide.” Moreover, if the upheavals and changes in a dialectical process of disintegration and reintegration through many generations effect a state of affairs when “instability becomes . . . the only stable factor” in a people’s experience, history must be reinterpreted to the new generation’s needs and outlook. “ In such times as ours,” he said, “ history must be rewritten in every generation,” and this “ applies with particular force to the Jewish people.” 15 As a scholar, eyewitness, and survivor, Cahnman felt a communal and\n\nxviii\n\nGerman Jewry\n\nintellectual responsibility, and a tragic one at that, to chronicle the “ disintegration” of his own community. In due course, he recorded faithfully the assault on, the uprooting, the migrational moves, and the final destruction of his people, the first victims of Hitler’s genocidai plans. At the same time, he never lost sight of what he considered the historian’s duty: to provide an account of certain relations and configurations in terms that may help the self-understanding of future generations.16 At a more personal level, Cahnman experienced and then explored the relation of his immediate environment to Jewish reality here and now. Starting with his family, he discovered that it was one characterized by the acknowledgment of “ being Jewish” and by generous contributions to Jewish charities. Reminiscing about what he and his generation believed, he noted they were aware of Judaism “ as an idea, hovering . . . over the vastness of a bustling world” in which they were preoccupied with “ striving for material success and social responsibility.” 17 To be sure, decades before GermanJewish history drew to a violent close, several movements had sprung up — among them the Reform and Neo-Orthodoxy—but they did not have a wide appeal, and certainly not to Cahnman, who thought them to be individualistic and purely denominational. A far greater impact on him and his peers was effected by another movement of faith and devotion, the Freies Jüdisches Lehrhaus, founded by Franz Rosenzweig in Frankfurt in 1920. They responded to Rozenzweig’s appeal for “ a reintegrated Judaism, above parties and sections.” 18 Decisive for Cahnman, however, was the towering figure of Martin Buber. When the “ mighty socialist movement” on the one hand, and the escapist individualism of the artist and youth movements on the other, presented themselves as viable alternatives to a sizeable segment of postWorld War I Jewish youth, Cahnman and many of his peers discovered Buber as “ one of the greatest sages of all times.” Anxious and disillusioned, they listened to Buber as he spoke about the “ renewal of Jewish existence and the need for a new approach to human existence, as two aspects of one and the same thing.” From that time dates Cahnman’s firm belief in “ openness to the world, confrontation, . . . activity, responsibility, mutuality,” that is, a life “ lived not in isolation of contemplation but in the togetherness of a common task.” Buber at that moment in history had turned upside down the meaning and direction of the German-Jewish symbiosis: Moses Mendelssohn had introduced “ the Jews of the Ghetto to the idiom of German culture,” and Buber (and Rosenzweig) sought to “ lead the heirs of the Emancipation back to the recognition of their Hebrew origin.” 19 After 1933, Buber’s direct role as teacher and comforter even reinforced the original impact; his Biblical exegeses, Cahnman recalled, compelled him and other young people to become “ strong and of good courage.” We have Cahnman’s word for it that Martin Buber, the author of I and Thou, whom he considered an “ inspired sociolo-\n\nIntroduction\n\nxix\n\ngist” (and socialist of sorts), had colored his own sociological perception as well as his affinity to Tönnies’s work, especially the latter’s view of Gemeinschaft. It was recently noted20 that the history of post-Emancipation German Jewry and of the Holocaust aftermath has received considerable scholarly attention. The study of Jewish life in the 1930s and the subsequent migrational movements, on the other hand, has been somewhat neglected. Cahnman’s studies and his research data, we believe, go a long way to fill this gap and will constitute an important element in any future large-scale historical account: I shall try to testify . . . in the belief that what I have to say will stand for the truth which, while it becomes manifest only in personal experience, nevertheless transcends it.21\n\nApproach and Perspectives The essays here assembled, whether written or published in Germany or America, all deal with the Jewish scene in Europe. During an interview on the occasion of his seventieth birthday, Werner Cahnman was asked about his approach to Jewish history.22 His reply at the time is still the best summation of his approach to Jewish history, that is, from the vantage point of the historical sociologist, and as a scholar who is not chiefly concerned with “ isolated phenomena but with relations between phenomena.’’ As he explained: Already as a young man I was dissatisfied with the manner in which a romantic nationalist such as the historian Heinrich Graetz would depict conflict, with the “ people of thinkers and sufferers’’ as an innocent victim of malice and cruelty. This did not seem to me to be realistic. When I came to understand that [for example] the trader and the peasant live in symbiosis and conflict, I was re lieved. . . . The Jewish people dwells among the nations, whether in Israel or in the Diaspora, and the tensions between intimate symbiosis and bitter conflict remains a guiding theme of Jewish history. In recognizing this fact, I would say, we are all post-Zionists.23\n\nCahnman was advocating not only a post-Zionist but also a post-liberal approach. What did he mean by that? He came from a straight liberal environment. But his more earthy and common sense inclinations, reinforced by Adolf Fischof’s notion of cultural nationalism, made him increasingly adopt a view that, “ as you cannot occupy a country from the air, so you cannot come to grips with Jewish life without envisaging the Jewish people in the flesh. Consequently, post-liberal thought did not return to the Law, but moved forward to peoplehood.” 24 Indeed, Cahnman’s early paper on “ Judentum und Volksgemeinschaft” (1926) already revealed this post-liberal position.\n\nXX\n\nGerman Jewry\n\nCahnman’s examination of the “ Jewish people that dwells among the nations” is focused on Germany because it was the country “ where in modem times the symbiosis . . . has been most intimate and it also has been the country where the conflict degenerated into the monstrosity of the Holocaust.” 25 The description of the cultural contours of Germany as the framework in which modem Jewish history takes place is of importance to Cahnman, for no other reason than that his views on some matters run counter to some commonly assumed positions. Thus, the opening essay of the present volume Part One, “ The Three Regions of German-Jewish History,” elaborates on certain typological and historical differentiations in order to prove his point, namely, that there is no such thing as a “ distinctive and unified German-Jewish history.” Rather, it is divided into two major epochs, the German-French and the German-Polish, and into different geographical regions. The following essays attempt to view “ the Jewish people in the flesh.” “ Pariahs, Strangers, and Court Jews: A Conceptual Clarification” scmtinizes the relation of Jews to governments in the changed circumstances of the post-emancipatory period by taking a closer look at some concepts introduced into the sociological vocabulary by Max Weber, but also used by Tönnies, Brentano, Simmel, and eventually taken up by Lewis Coser and Hannah Arendt. “ The Role and Significance of the Jewish Artisan Class” and “ Village and Small-Town Jews of Germany” again take issue with some commonly held views on the homogeneity and structural characteristics of post-Exilic Jewry. In a rather sweeping historical overview, yet not without basis in some hard data to prove the point, Cahnman demonstrates that the reality of Jewish artisanship and craft guilds is at complete variance with certain biased images of Jewish economic activities. He also establishes that, contrary to widely shared notions about the thoroughly urbanized Jewish communities of Central Europe, over 50 percent of the German Jews still resided in rural communities at the turn of the century, and according to the last census of Munich Jews (1938!), only 34 percent of the Jews were natives of the city. The typological study “ Village and SmallTown Jews of Germany” is a sociological tour de force validating his proven method of merging historical overview with personal/family history and empirical research. “ Socioeconomic Causes of Antisemitism” provides the elements of a sociological theory of antisemitism by examining the nature of Jewish-Gentile relations in the era of industrial society in the light of the fact that from the ninth to the nineteenth century Jews were members of an interstitial class and as such were exposed to many more contact, and conflict, situations than other sectors of the population. The three essays of Part II reflect in an extraordinarily direct way Cahnman’s personal and professional experiences in the Munich of the 1930s. As the Syndikus for Bavaria of the Central verein, and later as the social worker\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxi\n\nserving his own embattled and diminishing community, Cahnman conducted censuses, guarded files, and counseled emigrating Jews. “ The Decline of the Munich Jewish Community, 1933-38” and “ The Jews of Munich, 1918-43” amount to statistical reports on the effects of Nazi policy on the demographic structure of this group, and as such are important research documents. While the two essays constitute the sociological harvesting of Cahnman’s years as a Jewish activist, the story of his two months in Dachau in the winter of 1938 is a moving document about Cahnman’s trials and tribulations as a concentration camp inmate, and more striking at that because it shows how “ the system was supposed to work.” Part III offers “ Profiles in Jewish Courage and Vision,” with essays on Theodor Herzl and Ludwig Gumplowicz; on Clementine Kraemer, the Jewish writer and Cahnman’s favorite aunt; and on Martin Buber, the “ great sage,” and his idol. All these individuals are examined as representing ways of being Jewish at a certain historical juncture. In “ Scholar and Visionary: The Correspondence between Ludwig Gumplowicz and Theodor Herzl,” we first glimpse the ideas and (foolish?) optimism of a classical liberal, Gumplowicz, in contrast to the prophetic vision of the father of political Zionism and the Jewish state; then Cahnman highlights their diametrically opposing stance against their immediate environment, the multinational state of the Habsburg monarchy, to explain their respective positions. “ The Life of Clementine Kraemer” portrays no star on the political stage. What that fine woman stands for, how she lived, and how she came to her end was of no mean importance to Cahnman, as she symbolized the thriving existence and savage destruction of the community of which they were both a part. To be sure, she was a public figure in Munich, one of the initiators of Jewish social work; she was well known as an author of children’s books and short stories. But first and foremost, she was a repository of traditional Jewish values, a link between the warmth and folksiness of rural Jewish family life (an ideal Gemeinschaft) and the urbanizing and intellectualizing liberal bourgeois Jewish life of the city. And just as her way of life was representative of her people, so was her death in Theresienstadt in 1942. In “ Martin Buber: A Reminiscence,” Cahnman tells of how and why Buber brought home a different meaning of Jewish existence. It was a “ new interpretation not so much of Judaism as of Jewish existence, and not of Jewish existence of and by itself, but as a call to all men.” It was when the “ enemy was at the gate” that Buber spoke to a whole generation “ about the renewal” of this very Jewish existence and “ about the need for a new approach to human existence, as the two aspects of one and the same thing.” The last, most elaborate, and most philosophical of Cahnman’s writings is devoted to the “ old” theme: the German-Jewish symbiosis. “ Friedrich Wilhelm Schelling and the New Thinking of Judaism” addresses the problem of the\n\nxxii\n\nGerman Jewry\n\n“ elective affinity” or the state of affairs when “ the Jews achieved some sort of synthesis between Judaism and European culture,” as Selma Stem put it.26 As the title indicates, Cahnman goes back to the early nineteenth century and traces the line of development up to the early twentieth century. Cahnman’s reconstruction involves close textual reading and exegesis: After kabbalistic beliefs fell into disrepute in the German-speaking areas of Central Europe during the eighteenth century with the collapse of the carriers, the Sabbatian and Frankist movements, the subterranean continuation of these beliefs commenced in Germany. It came to the fore in the “ garb of romantic philosophy,” as the combination of that Jewish tradition with “ national-cultural” ideas, meaning that it continued but in a new language. Cahnman identifies Schelling as the catalyst of this new trend in Jewish thought and illustrates his point with Schelling’s 1815 lectures on the “ Philosophy of Mythology” and the “ Philosophy of Revelation.” The Schellingian influence on the thinking of the representatives of the second Emancipation in Germany is known to have emanated from kabbalistic sources. The line, in fact, stretches up to the twentieth century, to Franz Rosenzweig and the neo-Kantian Hermann Cohen, according to Cahnman—and, we may add, to the writings of Max Horkheimer and his Frankfurt School, where Schelling’s Naturphilosophie shows through their critique of science and technology.27 All of the papers here collected were preserved by Dr. Gisella Cahnman, widow of Werner, who shares the literary executorship with Joseph B.

Each period of this history is regarded as issuing naturally from its predecessor, the modem Jewish population of the country is seen as the lineal and spiritual descendant of its medieval Jewry, and the House of Rothschild an outgrowth of the Mendelssohn era. No types, regional or otherwise, are delineated. It is the thesis of this paper that such an approach is erroneous and that there is no such thing as a distinctive and unified German-Jewish history.1 What is usually so described is actually a series of disparate chapters belonging properly to the Jewish history of such contiguous areas as (in chronological order) France and the Rhineland, Bohemia and Austria, Hungary and Galicia, Poland and Lithuania. Interwoven with the story of Germany in a variety of ways, among all these different chapters there has been neither uniformity nor conformity until recently; while both the German and the Jewish elements have undergone significant mutations and transformations, fusing and blending into the most complex and diversified patterns. To sustain this point of view, it will be advisable to consider first what may be described as the cultural contours of Germany. The pivotal point of all German history perhaps, indeed, of all European history is the fact that Roman penetration stopped short at a line extending from the middle Rhine, north of Mayence, to the upper Danube, west of Regensburg. This line, the limes Romanus, bisected the country into two distinct culture areas. West of the wall, where a number of new, territorially conceived nations were bom, Roman influence prevailed, symbolized especially by the introduction of a jus soli and of Latinized forms of speech. East of this line the ancient tribal societies survived, preserving their traditional jus sanguinis and continuing to speak their native tongues. Until the time of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, in the 3\n\nDOI: 10.4324/9781003419099-2\n\n4\n\nGerman Jewry\n\ntwelfth century, all of the leading centers of Germany lay to the west of the wall. Only later did they shift to the South-East, and, still later, to the North-East.2 Berlin emerged very late as a capital city in Germany. But the limes was not the only cultural frontier in Germany. Scarcely less significant was the line which marked the western-most limit of Slavic penetration. This line ran transversally through Bavaria and Thuringia and crossed the lower Elbe in the vicinity of Hamburg, dividing the area of large estates from one of peasant holdings. Again, if we adopt the distinction between oceanic and continental areas suggested by such political geographers as Friedrich Ratzel3 and Sir Halford Mackinder,4 the drainage basin of the Elbe will constitute another important line of demarcation between the West and the North-East, while the Danube valley will form the connecting link between Southern Germany and the countries to its South-East. Jewish history follows along strikingly similar lines. From Palestine and Egypt a western wing of migration proceeded along the shores of the Mediterranean, first to Italy and Spain and thence to France and the Rhine valley, while an eastern wing moved partly through Byzantium to the Russian steppes, and partly along the Danube valley as far as Prague.5 In the early Middle Ages, these two widely separated worlds were represented, respectively, by Hasdai ibn Shaprut (915-75) in Spain and the Judaized King of the Chazars on the banks of the Volga. Central Europe was an interstitial area between the two. It originated as the Eastern terminal of the Western drive but derived its significance from the fact that, in the course of time, East and West met and merged there and contended for supremacy. In the heart of this area lies Germany. Its Jewish history is therefore neither eastern nor western, nor, indeed, uniform or independent. Its character is different in each epoch and is conditioned by the particular cultural currents which happened to sweep across it, now from the one direction and now from the other. It divides into two major epochs separated by what is, really, no more than a breathing-spell. Each can be correlated with one of the contiguous areas. The German-French Epoch The first epoch was a German-French epoch. Its characteristic figure is Rashi (1040-1105). Its center was located at the Rhine, the highroad of the medieval empire.6 This is shown by the fact that the liturgical rite (minhag) current in the Rhenish communities of Speyer, Worms and Mayence (SHUM) was recognized as the official German rite. The rite obtaining east of the Elbe and Saale was regarded as foreign and termed, by contrast, the rite of PolandBohemia-Hungary, while in Bavaria and Franconia the German rite fused with the Italian rite. The Jewish population of this area was neither Sephardic\n\nThe Three Regions of German-Jewish History\n\n5\n\nnor Ashkenazic, but existed before this classic division originated. It went back to the days of the late Roman Empire, the third and fourth centuries. The ultimate origin of the first settlers may be established through the ancestral traditions followed by their more illustrious descendants. Thus, the family of Kalonymus, prominent communal leaders in Mayence, is said to have come from Lucca, Italy; Gershom ben Judah (960-1040), one of the foremost scholars of the Middle Ages, who established his academy in the same city, hailed from Metz. Rashi, who is reputed to have taught at Worms, was a native of Troyes, deep in the heart of France. Conversely, it was the Germanbom Meir of Rothenburg (1215-93) who composed the famous poem Shaali Serufah, commemorating the burning of the Talmud in Paris in 1242. Not until the time of the First Crusade did an unmixed German idiom gain currency in the settlement. Earlier rabbinic records and responses are full of French expressions and idioms, regardless of whether their authors lived in France proper, in the Rhineland, or as far east as Regensburg.7 The tragic events of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and the persecutions of 1348, the year of the Black Death, all but destroyed this early settlement between the Rhine and the Elbe, while the expulsion of the Jews from France, in 1394, added the crowning touch to this period of tribulation. The cultural tradition embodied in the so-called hassidei Ashkenaz, or “ pious men of Germany,” thereupon shifted eastward, with Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia as stepping stones.8 Its influence survived for many centuries. Indeed, the mystical and moral teachings of Isaiah Horowitz of Moravia (ca. 1555-1630) and the Hassidic pietist, Israel Baal Shem Tov of Podolia (ca. 1700-1760), may be regarded as in direct line of succession to those expounded some three or four hundred years earlier, in the Sefer Hassidim of Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg. The German-Polish Epoch Not until 1648, exactly three centuries after the close of the Jewish medieval period, did the second epoch of German-Jewish history begin. This was to be the German-Polish epoch, characterized by a mass migration back to the West. In the wake of the Chmielnicki massacres, thousands of Polish Jews whose ancestors had previously moved eastwards, there to mix with the Tartaric brethren and to develop the Yiddish language, now retraced their steps—forerunners of the large-scale exodus from the same quarter in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Indigent Polish Jews thronged the highways and flooded the hospices, but with them there came to the West a marked regeneration of Hebrew and rabbinical scholarship. Indeed, since the middle of the seventeenth century, a large proportion of rabbis throughout the German-speaking areas of Middle Europe has been of Eastern European\n\n6\n\nGerman Jewry\n\nprovenance,9 while many of the lay leaders of modem Jewry have been their descendants. Thus, both Jonathan Eybeschlitz (1690-1767) and Jacob Emden (1697-1776), the two great controversialists, were of eastern origin, the former a native of Cracow and the latter a son of the famous Hakham Zevi of Amsterdam, who was bom in Moravia as the son of a refugee from the Chmielnicki pograms. Likewise of eastern European origin, to cite but a single typical example, was Gabriel Riesser (1806-63), vice president of both the Hamburg Bürgerschaft and the National Assembly at Frankfort in 1848. His maternal grandfather was Rabbi Raphael ben Yekuthiel Cohen, who had come to Hamburg from Lithuania, while his father, Lažams Riesser (alias Eliezer Katzenellenbogen) was the son of Rabbi Jacob Katzenellenbogen of Oettingen, Bavaria, himself of Polish descent.10 Around 1800, the overwhelming majority of Ashkenazic Jews lived in the East, beyond the borders of the Reich, at the fringes of the German culture area, and among Slavic-speaking populations. Hungary and the BohemianMoravian-Silesian region formed interstitial areas. Only a small remnant of medieval German Jewry remained in the West. They clustered around the Rhine and Main, separated from their brethren by wide areas which at that time were still almost judenrein. Regions like East Prussia, Mecklenburg, Saxony, and Old-Bavaria had no Jewish settlement prior to the eighteenth century, while Berlin and Vienna, which lay right between the Western outposts and the Eastern centers, had but recently begun to assume major importance, Berlin already during the eighteenth century, Vienna only around the year 1800. The Modern Period Out of this original configuration developed the three main regions which characterize German-Je wish history in the nineteenth century, the North-East, the old West and South, and the South-East, with Berlin, Frankfurt, and Vienna as their respective centers. Even a century later, on the eve of the Hitler regime, these areas had still preserved their sharp differences, although migration and intermarriage had begun to blur the lines of demarcation. The modem history of German Jewry begins in the North-East. Moses Mendelssohn’s translation of the Hebrew Bible (1780-83) divided Ashkenazic Jewry into German-speaking and Yiddish-speaking wings, but their social and cultural relations became even more pronounced than before. Both the Emancipation and the Haskalah movements started in Berlin, at the time the capital of a semi-Polish territory exposed to the influences of both West and East; and the movement linked with Mendelssohn made itself felt in that city and in Koenigsberg long before a similar development took place elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe. Many of the philosopher’s friends and disci-\n\nThe Three Regions of German-Jewish History\n\n7\n\npies were immigrants from the East, as were his ancestors. Through his mother’s family, he was related to Rabbi Moses Isserles of Cracow (151072), a commentator of the Shulhan Arukh. His father’s family was likewise of Polish origin.11 With the conquests of Frederick II and the successive partitions of Poland (in 1772, 1793, and 1795) the Jews in Eastern Germany gained preponderance over the older groups of their brethren in the West and South. As a consequence of the king’s successful campaigns, there had emerged a single large territorial unit, unifying the Jews with their Gentile neighbors, stimulating contacts between communities previously separated and generally broadening their outlook. At the same time, the partition of Poland had resulted in the incorporation into the Prussian state of the provinces of Poznan and West Prussia, each of which harbored a considerable Jewish population. The significance of the new influx can scarcely be exaggerated. Even in 1816, after the annexation of the Rhineland had brought an additional group of WestGerman Jews under Prussian domination, almost 54 percent of Jews in Prussia and more than 25 percent of Jews in all Germany (excluding Austria) lived in previously Polish or semi-Polish provinces or districts of Poznan, East and West Prussia.12 The addition of such a substantial minority effected a profound change in the composition of German Jewry,13 though intermarriages between the older and newer strata, or between West and East, were rare before the close of the nineteenth century. The Jews of the East were not only more numerous, they were different. At the time of the incorporation, those of Poznan had formed an economically poor but socially well-integrated Yiddish-speaking community in the midst of a larger and predominantly Polish-speaking peasantry. As late as 1873, more than 84 percent of all the Jews in the eastern districts of Posen, Bromberg, Marienwerder, and Oppeln lived in townships, as against only 9 percent in the western provinces of the Rhineland and Westphalia. Further, in the abovenamed eastern districts, there were 20 Jewish communities with over 1,000 inhabitants each, and 33 with over 500 inhabitants, whereas in the Rhineland and Westphalia not a single Jewish community counted more than 500 members.14 As might be expected, rabbinic culture was more at home in the semi-urban communities of the East than among the scattered villages of the West, Jews of the former region being imbued with the time-honored tradition of Talmudic learning. Moritz Lazarus’s father, who made the small boy listen to learned discussions early in the morning, was as typical of the sophisticated eastern Jew as Berthold Auerbach’s mother—who endowed her emigre nephew with a sacred amulet—was of the unlearned village Jews in the South and West.15 The intellectual proclivities of eastern Jewry were channelled later on into\n\n8\n\nGerman Jewry\n\nmore secular departments of life. In the German-Polish cultural conflicts of the nineteenth century, the newly assimilated Jews of Posen, with the zeal of neophytes, rushed to the support of German-language schools and other German institutions. Their descendants formed the core of the Berlin Jewish community, gained positions of influence in commercial and professional life, in the sciences and in journalism, and provided the leadership of local and national organizations. Representative examples are: Moritz Lazarus (18241903) of the Deutsch-Israelitischer Gemeindebund; Marcus Horowitz (18441910) and Paul Nathan (1857-1927) of the Hilfsverein der Deutschen Juden; and Eugen Fuchs (1856-1923) and Julius Brodnitz (1866-1936) of the Centralverein Deutscher Staatsbürger Jüdischen Glaubens. Thus Prussia, the paramount power of Protestant Germany during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, at the same time became the power center of Germany’s modem Jewish communities. Their cultural complexion was influenced from the outset by the authoritarian rationalism of Frederick II, the tolerant optimism of Lessing, and the critical philosophy of Kant. A typical offspring of this atmosphere was the philosopher Hermann Cohen (18421918), whose presentation of Judaism as a “ religion of reason’’ completed the attempt of the Lithuanian immigrant Solomon Maimon (1754-1800) to interpret his traditional faith through the medium of Kantian ethics and metaphysics. Cohen was the son of a cantor in Coswig-Anhalt and was married to a daughter of the composer Louis Lewandowski (1823-94), who hailed from Wreschen in Posen. Cohen had a distinguished university career as a philosophic expounder of Judaism. Rationalism, however, was not the only trend which characterized the Jewry of the North-East. In the same area rose also the Romantic movement,16 which found its Jewish expression in the “ Science of Judaism’’ of Leopold Zunz (1794 -1886),17 the “ Historic Judaism’’ of Zacharias Frankel (1801— 75), and the sentimental and nationalistic approach to Jewish history which marked the work of Heinrich Graetz (1819-91). All of these men were of eastern origin; Zunz (who lived in Berlin) came from Detmold, Frankel from Prague, and Graetz from Xions, in Posen. Characteristic of the cultural atmosphere which pervaded the area is the fact that in the three German rabbinical seminaries, located in Berlin and Breslau, the curriculum took equal account of both the romantic and the rationalistic schools of Jewish scholarship.18 Quite different was the situation in the South and West. There, in compact family groups, lived the descendants of those Jews who had not migrated eastwards in the late Middle Ages, but who, when driven from the cities by commercial envy, had sought refuge in smaller towns and villages controlled by petty princes. Thoroughly integrated into the rural communities where their ancestors had appeared as “ wandering Jews,’’ they were an inseparable, though segregated, part of the environment, and did not constitute a distine-\n\nThe Three Regions of German-Jewish History\n\n9\n\ntive society. Socially hidebound and slow to change, they were at the same time determined individualists. From humble peddler.to court Jew, they professed no other group loyalties than those to their own families or immediate neighbors. The court Jews and their successors, the great capitalists and shtadlanim of the past two-and-a-half centuries, such as the Oppenheimers, Wertheimers, Rothschilds, Hirsches, Bischofsheims, Guggenheims, Schiffs, Kahns, Lehmans, Monds, Morgenthaus, and Warburgs, were the most significant contribution of the region to the gallery of Jewish types. Their influence was felt not only in Europe but also in America. Both culturally and commercially, the Jews of South and West Germany were closer to Paris than to Berlin or the despised “ colonial’’ regions of the East. Unlike their “ enlightened” brethren across the Elbe, they had been emancipated by France, when the armies of Napoleon split the old Reich asunder. Consequently, it was not philosophical reason but political liberty that became the watchword of an entire generation of Jewish writers from the Rhineland. For more than a century Paris served as a secondary center of South-West German Jewry and as a haven for its refugee artists and authors, of whom Boeme, Heine, Offenbach, Hess, Marx, and Bamberger may be regarded as typical. Similarly, Alsace and Lorraine, because of their political ties with France, became favored centers of emigration, developing, as it were, into the equivalents of Posen and Silesia, for Paris. Nevertheless, despite these Francophile tendencies, the main center of South-Western Jewry remained Frankfurt. Here, its peculiar character and temper, a combination of individualism and emotionality, received full expression. Every intellectual approach to Jewish problems and every nationalistic program for concerted action was foreign to the Jews of that area. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, they distrusted rabbinical casuistry and educational techniques; in the nineteenth, the radical Reform movement; and, in the twentieth, political Zionism.19 It is not without significance that, while many North-German congregations supported the religious liberalism of Abraham Geiger (1810-74), Frankfurt am Main became the seat of the NeoOrthodox movement founded by Samson Raphael Hirsch (1808 -88).20 The most tragic representative of West- and South-German Jewry, apart from Heinrich Heine, was the novelist Jacob Wassermann., The conflict between Jewish “ blood” and German “ soil” tore him, and others, asunder. A third center of Jewish life in Middle Europe grew in the Danube basin. Here were revealed all the traits and characteristics of an interstitial area. The Austrian Alpine countries contained only a tiny Jewish population. The Jews in Bohemia and Moravia were distributed in the same way as those of NorthWestern and South-Western Germany, village and small-town settlements being grouped around a time-honored central community—in the one case Frankfurt, in the other Prague. Further East, in Slovakia, however, 5 percent\n\n10\n\nGerman Jewry\n\nof the total population was Jewish, as against 1 percent in Bohemia; while in Carpatho-Russia (which later belonged to the Republic of Czechoslovakia, and was incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1946) the percentage of Jews was as high as 14 percent, thus indicating the unmistakable pattern of the East. The character and temperament of these Jewries was well expressed in Czechoslovak census returns. Given the choice of declaring themselves of Jewish rather than German, Czech, or Hungarian nationality, only 20 percent of the Jews of Bohemia availed themselves of this opportunity, whereas over 50 percent did so in Moravia and as many as 95 percent in Carpatho-Russia. Seeing that in the two former areas (where Yiddish culture played a minor role) this declaration entailed endorsement of Czech-language schools, and in the latter of Yiddish and Hebrew schools, these figures would tend to suggest that a nationalistic conception of Judaism was more congenial to the spirit of the East and a religio-cultural conception to that of the West. Nevertheless, throughout the Danubian area, clear-cut lines of demarcation were lacking. In fact, almost every type of nineteenth-century Jew was represented there in extreme forms. Thus, while the wave of baptism and escapism rose to phenomenal heights in Vienna, that city was also the center of an intransigent nationalism, both among Jews and Gentiles. Similarly, while Jews nowhere participated as freely in the life of the community as in the Austrian capital, it is equally true that antisemitism was nowhere more malicious and more militant. The Jewish mass settlements in Hungary and Galicia poured an inexhaustable stream of immigrants from the East into Vienna, where they met with a highly sophisticated community of longer standing. The Jewish “ Fortyeighter” Adolf Fischhof (1816-93), bom in Budapest, became the protagonist of democratic cooperation between the entangled nationalities of the Habsburg monarchy. A little later, a follower of Fischhof, Rabbi Joseph S. Bloch of Floridsdorf (1850-1923), of Galician origin, admonished his fellow Jews to be neither Germans nor Czechs nor Poles, but simply Jews and Austrian patriots. To establish a nationality of their own seemed natural to many Jews in an area where every problem developed into a nationality conflict.21 The general atmosphere in Germany led to an advocacy among Jews of institutionalized religion within the framework of a unified nation, while the political temper in Austria was bound to become increasingly nationalistic as soon as the dream of unconditional assimilation was shattered. This, more than any other factor, accounts for the similarity of attitude with which Austrian Jews of seemingly diverse outlook approached the problem of their environment. Thus, at the same time as Joseph Samuel Bloch was busy establishing the Oesterreichisch-Israelitische Union as a bulwark against the rising tide of antisemitism, Nathan Birnbaum (1864-1937) and his friends\n\nThe Three Regions of German-Jewish History\n\n11\n\nwere founding the first fraternity of Zionist students in the West, Kadimah, a still more pronounced answer to antisemitism.22 In retrospect, the difference between the two organizations appears negligible, a matter of degree rather than kind. Intellectuals of Hungarian, Galician, and Russian origin preached the doctrine of national independence as missionaries to an unbelieving Jewish West. They conceived of the Jewish people as an ancient “ folk” which was to be transformed into a militant nationality. In later years, their faithful disciples spread these tenets throughout the entire German-speaking area, but, according to the different environment, the stimulation turned cultural where originally it had been political. The standard-bearers were not Herzl and Nordau (both bom in Budapest, Hungary) but the Bohemian writers Brod, Weltsch, Beer-Hofmann and, above all, Martin Buber,23 the magician who combined East and West in his work and whose personality left its imprint upon two generations of German-Jewish intellectuals and the entire GermanJewish youth movement. The influence of Sigmund Freud reached still further: He translated Viennese frustrations into universal anxieties. Conclusions The three regional groups crossed and blended in several ways and in varied degrees. Nevertheless, typological and historical differentiations should be recognized. Typologically, the North-Eastern and South-Eastern groups, being somewhat in the order of compact societies, belong together, as against the more isolated sector to the South and West. Each represents, although in different degrees, the Western frontier of Eastern Jewry gradually moving from Slavic and Magyar soil into the environment of German culture and, during the nineteenth century, in turn, transmitting German classical literature to the settlements of the Russian pale. Berlin and Vienna and, to a lesser degree, Koenigsberg and Breslau shared in that task. Jews from Poznan penetrated Silesia and flooded Berlin and Hamburg. East Prussia was settled largely by early Russian arrivals, Saxonia by recent immigrants from Poland. Bohemia and Moravia remained a meeting-ground. Vienna was dominated by Bohemian, Moravian, Hungarian, and, finally, Galician strains, in that order. On the other hand, the West- and South-German sections preserved much of their old-established peculiarities. Traditions there were more deeply rooted, and, by virtue of the isolation and numerical weakness of the communities, had already become petrified by the time emancipation dawned. Historically, commercial and organizational relations and, finally, intermarriages, developed between North-East and South-West during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, while the separation of the Habsburg monarchy from the Prussianized Reich cast the Jews of the former region upon a life of their own, although they were destined to exert a marked\n\n12\n\nGerman Jewry\n\ninfluence over their brethren in Germany proper through literature and music. The Jews of Alsace-Lorraine underwent a development which led them far away from their previous affiliations. So, too, did those numerous German, and especially South-German, Jews who migrated to the United States. Among the Jews in the Reich, however, a common middle-of-the-road type of Judaism, equally removed from Orthodoxy and Reform, gradually emerged. This type was fostered by common institutions and was reinforced rather than shattered in the first years of the Hitler regime. By 1938, however, at the latest, the work of separation from the larger society and of atomization to the point of dissolution which had begun even prior to 1933 had been completed, and physical extinction was imminent.24 The second epoch of German-Jewish history has ended as catastrophically as the first. Yet its seeds are scattered over the face of the earth and will surely blossom in God’s good time. And a third epoch is about to begin. 1943; 1969 Notes 1.

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, this line marked a further important division: areas west and south of it remained largely Catholic, or adhered to the Western, Calvinistic branch of Protestantism, while those to the east and north became overwhelmingly Lutheran. It should also be observed that the northern and eastern frontiers of vine cultivation coincide largely with the same line. 3.

It should be noted, however, that Geiger was himself a native of Frankfurt am Main. Actually, his and Hirsch ’s movement exhibit more similarities than partisans from either side are ready to admit. Hirsch ’s definition of Israel as a Religionsfolk seems strikingly akin to Geiger ’s notion of Jewish survival as due to Israel’s supposed “ genius for religion.” Both movements used different techniques against the background of related philosophies. The Reform movement attempted to reduce Judaism to the semblance of a modernistic sect, while Neo-Orthodoxy tried to ossify it as a rigidly defined religious code in compensation for the loss of a total and political conception of Jewish life. Yet both movements were strictly individualistic and purely denominational and, for that reason, both seem somewhat out of place in a growingly collectivist environment. Nevertheless, both sprang up naturally out of their place and time. So much, indeed, was this the case, that it was not before German-Jewish history drew to a close that another movement of faith and devotion arose in the same region: the Freie Jüdische Lehrhaus was founded in Frankfurt in 1920. The leading spirit of the Lehrhaus\n\n14\n\n21. 22.\n\n23. 24.\n\nGerman Jewry was Franz Rosenzweig, a philosopher who later devoted his attention to Jewish studies and proclaimed a reintegrated Judaism, above parties and sections. Shall we regard it as symbolic that Franz Rosenzweig ’s Jewish teachers had been the Liberal Herman Cohen and the Orthodox Jeremiah Nobel? Liberal or Orthodox, both came from the East. Refer to my paper, “ Adolf Fischhof and his Jewish Followers,’’ in the Leo Baeck Yearbook, 4 (1959): 111 -42.

In this context, the relations between Jews and sovereigns are of particular importance. At the same time, the question is raised as to how and to what extent sociological concepts are applicable to historical reality. It will be shown that it is the nature of historical phenomena that they have another side. A comparative analysis serves this multiple purpose. A further reason for engaging in the evaluation is a 1972 paper by Professor Lewis A. Coser. In his paper, Coser elaborates on the topic of “ The Alien as a Servant of Power,“ 1 using as examples the court Jews of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and the Christian boys that were pressed in the corps of the Janissaries in the Ottoman Empire. Coser considers the Jews of the Middle Ages as well as those of the absolutistic era as “ wholly unprotected . . . communities of pariahs“ and characterizes them simultaneously as “ prototypical strangers.” About the court Jews he says further that they had been “ raised from the depths” by the ruling princes of the time and, in an analogous passus, that they had been “ lifted by the princes from their status as pariahs.” Regarding the ex-Christian boys in the corps of the Jannissaries, Coser uses the term renegade; for the totality of the phenomena under investigation he uses the term alien which he does not distinguish from the commonly used sociological concept of the stranger. The ex-Christian boys and the Court-Jews are then subsumed under the concept of aliens. Equipped with a vaguely indicated conceptual Instrumentarium of this kind, Coser engages in “ sociology with the hard work left out.” Concrete phenomena are not critically investigated because they are not endowed with intrinsic interest: they are used to verify a hypothesis. In such a manner, Coser, while emphasizing superficial similarities, overlooks essential dissimilarities and is likely to spread 15\n\nDOI: 10.4324/9781003419099-3\n\n16\n\nGerman Jewry\n\nconfusion among his readers. The relations between Jewish subjects and Gentile sovereigns are part of the entire complex of Jewish-Gentile relations and must be pursued throughout the length and breadth of European history. If one intends to grasp their significance, he must analyze the concepts of the pariah and the stranger, as well as a number of related concepts, and scrutinize them regarding their applicability to such phenomena as the shtadlan, the court Jew, and the state banker. The Concepts of the Pariah, the Millet, and the Stranger I am starting with Max Weber’s concept of the pariah which, not unlike other so-called ideal types of Weberian coinage, has been widely quoted and used without much deliberation as to its significance or its applicability. As one looks at the pertinent passages more closely, he will find that the concept is by no means unambiguous, namely: 1. The concept has been interpreted by Max Weber differently in different passages of his writings; 2. The concept has not been sufficiently clarified by Max Weber as far as the initial Indian context is concerned; 3. The applicability of the concept to the Jewish situation and possibly to other extra-Indian situations is open to doubt. The third point is decisive in the present context, but the two preceding points cannot be entirely disregarded either. Weber’s position is most clearly expressed in Ancient Judaism, where he says that a Pariavolk is “ a guest people that is ritually, formally or factually, separated from its environment.” 2 In The Religion of India, he adds that pariah peoples are “ migratory peoples that are ‘excluded from connubium and commensality’ and considered as ‘ritually unclean.’” 3 Not only the “ separateness” but also the “ uncleanness” is emphasized at this point. In Economy and Society Weber designates a Pariavolk as “ a distinctive hereditary social group lacking autonomous political organization and characterized by internal prohibitions against commensality and intermarriage originally founded upon magical, tabooistic, and ritual functioning on the one hand, and political and social disprivilege on the other hand.” 4 In the same volume he speaks of “ specific occupational traditions,” “ belief in the ethnic community,” “ strict segregation from any avoidable personal intercourse” and a “ legally precarious situation” ; Weber continues that, by virtue of their economic indispensability, pariah peoples are tolerated, indeed “ frequently privileged,” and that they live “ interspersed” in political communities. The Jews, he says, “ are the most impressive historical example.” 5 The last quotation indicates the nature of Weber’s interest because one can hardly maintain that the Indian pariahs are “ privileged.”\n\nPariahs, Strangers, and Court Jews\n\n17\n\nSigrist6 has pointed out that Weber does not restrict his attention to a few attributes and that he seems to consider an attribute at one time as necessary, at another time as dispensable. One might add that Weber is not even sure as to whether he wishes to use the term pariah “ in the usual European sense“ 7 or with reference to “ what we know from India.“ 8 It appears that he leans toward the former interpretation because he designates the Jews as a pariah people, with the further comment that the designation “ has little to do with the particular situation of the pariah caste in India.“ 9 Nevertheless, the comparison with the Indian pariah caste can hardly be avoided, or else, the term should not have been chosen. I agree with Sigrist that it is hardly admissible to say that what we have here before us is an “ ideal type” which rests on the imagined summation of attributes that need not be present in their totality in a concrete case. The concepts of pariah and Pariavolk obviously are not so much an “ ideal-type” concept but a “ historical totality concept” or a “ relatively historical concept” in Schelling’s sense. One might even go further and agree with Hempel when he says that impure ideal types of his kind are not concepts, properly speaking, but theories.10 It is not within my intention or competence to analyze the place of the pariahs, or Parayan, within the social structure of India. However, the older as well as the newer literature which I have consulted11 agrees that the Parayan are a low and despised caste within the Hinduistic social system—not necessarily the lowest caste, as Weber already observed. They engage in low and menial tasks against a puny compensation, live from hand to mouth and in dirt and misery, and their character and living conditions are believed to be immutably fixed. One can say that the designation of these people as ritually unclean is a mirror and consequence of the actual situation; the actual situation is subsequently sanctioned by ritual segregation. Fuchs considers it unlikely, for anthropological and anthropometric reasons, that the Parayan are the remnant of a subjected aboriginal population. That amounts to saying that the Parayan are not ethnic or religious strangers; they are included in the ethnoreligious universe of Hinduism. Strangers in India are the Parsis. One gains the impression that the Parayan are a degraded proletariat, possibly representing a prototype of what Oscar Lewis has called “ the culture of poverty.” I must leave further elaboration at this point to the Indologists. I would, however, complement the diffuse formulations of Max Weber by the following definition: The pariahs are: 1) a low, despised and exploited caste, 2) which is considered unclean factually and ritually and 3) which therefore is excluded from connubium, commensality, and each and every kind of personal contact, and 4) whose members accept the exclusion as legitimate. What we have before us, then, is not an ideal type, but a relatively historical real type. It would seem more appropriate to refer to a mideastem model rather than to apply a phenomenon which is indigenous to India when it comes to the\n\n18\n\nGerman Jewry\n\nsocial history of the Jews of Europe. At the same time, such a model will serve to evaluate Coser’s attempt to use the ex-Christian boys that were pressed into military service in the Ottoman Empire as a prime example for what may be meant by “ aliens as servants of power.’’ I am referring here to the concept of the Millet, as I have elaborated in the paper “ Religion and Nationality.’’ The Millet may be defined as the peculiar political organization which gave to non-Moslem subjects of the Ottoman Empire the right to organize into communities possessing delegated political power under their own ecclesiastical chiefs. The head of the Millet was directly responsible to the state for the administration of all its subjects. Although the Millet lacked territorial cohesion and military power and had therefore to be protected by the ruling warrior caste, it formed in many respects an autonomous unit within the state. Yet, the mem bers of the Millet were limited in their general citizenship by the fact that the laws of personal stature were based on religious sanctions.12\n\nThus, the Greek Patriarch of Constantinople was the political head of the Greek Millet—the most important of them all because it represented the continuity with the Byzantine Empire that was now under Turkish sovereignty. The Greeks were not only indispensable commercially; the Phanaroite families of Constantinople were the administrators and diplomats of the Ottoman Empire, while military positions, to be sure, were closed to them. That hits closer to home than the example of the ex-Christian boys in the corps of the Janissaries. Things go further back as far as the Jews are concerned. The Rosh-Galuta (Prince of the Exile) was recognized as the legitimate head of the Jewish community by the Sassanid rulers and Arab caliphs in Babylonia and Persia, and the basic idea that religion and ethnicity are merely two sides of the same thing harks back to models of the ancient Orient and to Biblical documentation. This model was congenial to the Jews, it was accepted (if ever so reluctantly) by the emperors of Rome, and it provided the underlying principle for the legal construction of Jewish existence in the Middle Ages. Included in the concept of the Millet is the concept of the stranger. The concept of the stranger has been elaborated upon repeatedly in the classic sociological literature, especially in Germany. It is to be found by Ludwig Gumplowicz, by Lujo Brentano, by Ferdinand Tönnies, and by Georg Simmel.13 I am referring here chiefly to Tönnies and Simmel. According to Tönnies, the trader is always a stranger; he adds that even if he is not a stranger, strictly speaking, he will be considered as one. The trader who leaves his own clan-community because he is prevented from trading among brothers, Tönnies continues, is “ the first thinking and free human being to appear in the normal development of human life’’;14 he is the protagonist of Gesellschaft, weighing advantage and disadvantage, separating means and ends. Simmel has added a\n\nPariahs, Strangers, and Court Jews\n\n19\n\npsychological dimension to the sociological concept of the stranger when he says that in him “ distance becomes proximity” ; the stranger is not so much “ the wanderer who comes today and leaves tomorrow.” The stranger who, as Tönnies indicates15 does not need to be a recent migrant, lives in the midst of the native population but belongs to another class and serves another God. He becomes a neighbor but one who maintains his extended relations, so that proximity is indeed merged with distance: he turns out to be the intermediary. I am using the term intermediary not exclusively microsociologically in Simmel’s sense—he refers to a third person as intermediary between two others— but rather macrosociologically in the sense of Tönnies, that is, as a commercial and cultural intermediary within a social structure. To be sure, others have also fulfilled these functions, but none as exclusively as the Jew, who without support from a political homeland has lived always and everywhere on the periphery and consequently in mediation. The function of mediation has its two sides: on the one hand, the intermediary as an outsider is looked upon with suspicion; on the other hand, because he is an outsider, he is welcomed as a friend, a counsellor, and an impartial judge. He is a neighbor, but he has the advantage of remoteness. The Pariavolk in Antiquity and in the Middle Ages We must now return to the simplest of Max Weber’s definitions of a Pariavolk, namely that of “ a guest people that is ritually formally or factually separated from its environment.” In this restricted sense, the concept may be applicable to the Jewish situation, but it does not carry our understanding very far. To speak, as Max Weber does, of a “ Pariavolk that lives in a casteless environment,” 16 would be equivalent to talking of pariahs who are no pariahs; historically speaking, the pariah situation remains suspended in midair without the matrix of a caste society. Consequently, Max Weber admits that ritual separation, as distinguished from physical segregation, that is, exclusion from connubium and commensality, was at no time imposed on the Jews from the outside, as it was on the pariahs in India. Rather the Jews enjoyed the status of an autonomous community, or a politeuma, in the Roman Empire. Theodor Mommsen17 sees in this fact the main reason for the aversion against them. Max Weber sees the main reason in Jewish exclusivity, that is, in their selfsegregation: the Jews refused to participate in the meals of the Gentiles as they refused to participate in the cult of the divine emperor. That earned them the reputation of indulging in odium generis humani. But the Gentiles participated in the meals of the Jews and many joined Judaism as proselytes. What one can say is that the pagan authors whose diatribes have been preserved were ‘‘viewing with alarm” what was going on, namely, the attraction which Judaism held to\n\n20\n\nGerman Jewry\n\nmany a searching mind among their contemporaries. The spectacle was irritating for a variety of reasons, not least, as Seneca put it, because it seemed that “ the vanquished [had] given laws to the victors.” Moreover, if one disregards ad hoc definitions and adopts a more common understanding of the term pariah which, by the way, is subtly implied in Max Weber’s own argument, namely, that of a population of low position and prestige that is shunned and held in contempt by the remainder of the population, the name antedates the reality to which it refers by about a millennium. Far from considering themselves, or being considered by others, as persons of low caste, the Jews of late antiquity called themselves “ the People of God,” and this all the more so as the Church proclaimed itself as “ the true Israel.” If a Jewish trait bothered the Gentiles, it was overweening pride rather than impotent resentment of servile submissiveness. One must agree with Julius Guttman when he says that a “ plebeian or Pariavolk ethic vis-á-vis native or foreign potentates can be observed neither among the prophets nor among the pharisees.” 18 Hans Gerth feels that Weber’s terminology is “ unfortunately lending itself to misconceptions” ;19 Guttman considers the designation of the Jews as a Pariavolk as factually incorrect. I happen to agree with both critics. The degradation of the Jews—not in ritual but in socioeconomic terms—to the lowly occupations of small-scale money lending, pawnbroking, and to the trade in used goods is a phenomenon of the high Middle Ages and was deepened in more recent centuries. The occupational structure of the Jewish communities remained diversified in the countries of the first Diaspora, that is, in the Mediterranean area, until the late fifteenth century.20 The occupational structure was more lopsided in the countries of the second Diaspora, that is, in western and northern Europe, yet the function which the Jews served in commerce and finance was highly appreciated until the period of the Crusades. In the core area of emerging Europe, the Carolingian Empire, the social position of the Jews was so elevated that the aggressive anti-Jewish campaign of Bishop Agobard of Lyon came to naught on account of the influence which the Jews wielded at the court of Emperor Louis the Pious. The bishop objected that the faithful accepted invitations to Jewish homes, that they preferred rabbinic sermons to those of their own clergy, that they celebrated the Jewish Sabbath rather than the Christian Sunday, and that they accepted employment with Jews, especially in Jewish homes and vineyards. Agobard’s Church looked upon the Jews not as despised pariahs but as dangerous competitors.21 The situation was slow to change. The Gothic statue of the Synagogue over the portal of the southern transept of the Münster at Strasbourg is veiled with blindness and her power is broken, but her bearing is noble, in stark contrast to the Judas Iscariot of the baroque passion plays, who haggles for his silver coins. It is dubious whether the concept of the Pariavolk can be applied even to\n\nPariahs, Strangers, and Court Jews\n\n21\n\nthe period from the twelfth century onward. The term refers to untouchables and in a certain sense to unredeemables; redemption by means of an anticipated migration of souls in the hereafter can be disregarded in the present context. The Jews were in contact with all strata of the population; Jewish hospitality was eagerly sought and finally made impossible only by strict ecclesiastical ordinances. In the Jewish view, the Jews were ready for the coming of the redeemer at any time; in the Christian view, they were redeemable by conversion. However, conversion was a long way off; individual Jews converted by their own choice, others were converted under duress, but the bulk of the Jews preferred death at their own hands or the hands of killers to surrendering to what in their eyes was an inferior faith. The conclusion from our deliberations thus far is that the concept of the pariah, outside of its Indian con"
