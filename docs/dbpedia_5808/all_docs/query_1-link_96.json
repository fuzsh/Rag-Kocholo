New Perspectives on the History of Political Economy brings together a select group of young and established scholars from a wide variety of disciplinary backgrounds—history, economics, law, and political science—in an effort to begin a re-conceptualization of the origins and history of political economy through a variety of still largely distinct but complementary historical approaches—legal and intellectual, literary and philosophical, political and economic—and from a variety of related perspectives: debt and state finance, tariffs and tax policy, the encouragement and discouragement of trade, merchant communities and companies, smuggling and illicit trades, mercantile and colonial systems, economic cultures, and the history of economic doctrines more narrowly construed.\n\nThe first decade of the twenty-first century, bookended by 9/11 and a global financial crisis, witnessed the clamorous and urgent return of both 'the political' and 'the economic' to historiographical debates. It is becoming more important than ever to rethink the historical role of politics (and, indeed, of government) in business, economic production, distribution, and exchange. The artefacts of pre-modern and modern political economy, from the fourteenth through the twentieth centuries, remain monuments of perennial importance for understanding how human beings grappled with and overcame material hardship, organized their political and economic communities, won great wealth and lost it, conquered and were conquered.\n\nThe present volume, assembling some of the brightest lights in the field, eloquently testifies to the rich and powerful lessons to be had from such a historical understanding of political economy and of power in an economic age.\n\nE-Book Content\n\nNEW PERSPECTIVES ON THE HISTORY OF POLITICAL ECONOMY\n\nEdited by\n\nRobert Fredona and Sophus A.

Reinert\n\nThe first decade of the twenty-first century, bookended by the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and by a global financial crisis with aftershocks still resonating throughout the world, witnessed the clamorous and urgent return of both “the political” and “the economic” to historiographical debates. For some, this return could not have come sooner. Economics (both academic and “popular”) had, many argued, largely embraced increasingly abstract formal methods in the preceding decades. So much so that one economic historian could recently argue that the debate about the role of mathematics in economic theory can hardly be said to be of much significance in the modern literature, since there are no longer any leading economists who believe that academic economics can be a nonmathematical discipline.1\n\nYet, even if this debate is truly closed, an unanswered question remains: is mathematics enough? Whatever their role within economics as an academic field, these deracinated methods, for intrinsic but also complex sociological and political reasons, have tended to buttress clusters of interrelated ideological programs and proposals favoring xi\n\nxii Introduction: History and Political Economy\n\nlaissez-faire policies and their global institutionalization. And these policies, associated with the so-called “Washington Consensus‚” had been implemented with decidedly varying results.2 At the same time, the historical profession—ideally well positioned to provide realist grounding for theoretical extremes—undertook (or fell under the sway of ) its “cultural turn‚” generally leaving historical economic analysis behind and relegating it to an arid subfield of economics in the academic establishment.3 The sheer consequentiality of subsequent events, and what many—including, remarkably, even the rather partial The Economist magazine [Fig. 1]—have seen as the manifest crisis of economic theory as such, reopened the eyes of scholars and laymen alike to the need for a more historical (or at least more historically aware) approach to economic phenomena.4 And, although far from moribund, the so-called “free trade” paradigm in Anglo-American economic thought on the one hand and the wider dominance of cultural concerns in the academic study of history on the other are at last beginning to fragment. As the cracks and fissures in their foundations continue to grow, it is becoming more important than ever to rethink the historical role of politics (and, indeed, of government) in business, economic production, (re)distribution, and exchange, not to mention in the complex array of processes brought together under the umbrella of globalization.5 Indeed, although career prospects for young historians remain challenging at best, leading universities are increasingly hiring scholars working on “the history of political economy” in addition to “the history of capitalism‚” elevating the historical analysis of economic ideas and practices to new heights.6 To be blunt, “political economy” has again become something of an academic catchphrase, and it is now seen to offer an important vantage point on the turmoil of our time.\n\nIntroduction: History and Political Economy xiii\n\nFig. 1 The Economist, July 18–24, 2009. Jon Berkeley for The Economist\n\nNew Perspectives on the History of Political Economy contributes to this resurgent historiography and suggests new avenues and agendas for research on the political-economic nexus as it has developed in the Western world since the end of the Middle Ages. Far from procrustean,\n\nxiv Introduction: History and Political Economy\n\nthe volume brings together purposefully selected young and established scholars from a wide variety of disciplinary backgrounds—history, economics, law, and political science—in an effort to continue the ongoing reconceptualization of the origins and history of political economy through a variety of still largely distinct but complementary approaches—legal and intellectual, literary and philosophical, political and economic—and from a variety of related perspectives: debt and state finance, tariffs and tax policy, the encouragement and discouragement of trade, accounting and bookkeeping, merchant communities and companies, smuggling and illicit trades, mercantile and colonial systems, empires and special economic zones, economic cultures, and the history of doctrines more traditionally construed. There are, of course, many ways of engaging with the history of political economy, and it is purposefully not our wish to suggest that there are right and wrong ways of so doing: Herodotus’ house can, happily, be as vast and sprawling as Borges’ “Library of Babel.” Historiographically speaking, it seems important to us, not only given recent trends but also recent events, to purposefully encourage a widening of historical perspectives. There is a time for tightly focalized volumes, surely, but an argument can now be made for broader temporal approaches and looser disciplinary boundaries. Though such an approach may lose something in the way of coherence, this is, we believe, a price worth paying when the ultimate dividend is a richness of detail and variety of insight unlikely if not impossible inside the “box” of strict chronological and essentialist disciplinary bounds. As varied as they are, all of the essays in this volume nonetheless share some crucial points of convergence and the area of conceptual overlap is greater than the areas of disparateness. And John Maynard Keynes was right, during the Great Depression that marked the end of the last major period of laissezfaire globalization, to warn against “the silliness of the doctrinaire.”7 That said, different approaches to the history of political economy serve divergent purposes, inviting different possibilities and challenges alike. As many have pointed out before, historians of economic analysis have frequently pursued internalized economic genealogies, essentially approaching the history of economics from the perspective of contemporary theory.8 Though the influence of the history of science and\n\nIntroduction: History and Political Economy xv\n\nother traditions has certainly broadened the historiography of economics in recent years, it remains that the history of economic analysis has often been approached as a purely intellectualized trajectory from analytical falsity to truth.9 Mark Blaug, after all, called his major work Economic Theory in Retrospect, and even as erudite and wide-ranging a scholar as the MIT economist Paul Samuelson gave a keynote lecture to the History of Economics Society towards the end of the Cold War in which he forcefully argued that the history of economics [should] more purposefully reorient itself towards studying the past from the standpoint of the present state of economic science. To use a pejorative word unpejoratively, I am suggesting a Whig Economic History of Economic Analysis.10\n\nAs Sir William J. Ashley, something of a British envoy of the German Historical School of Economics almost a century earlier, memorably opined of such methods, they ran the risk of making the history of economics little but “a museum of intellectual odds and ends, where every opinion is labelled as either a surprising anticipation of the correct modern theory or an instance of the extraordinary folly of the dark ages.”11 Quentin Skinner has rightly argued that such intellectual endeavors can be “labelled the mythology of prolepsis, the type of mythology we are prone to generate when we are more interested in the retrospective significance of a given episode than in its meaning for the agent of the time.”12 Such proleptic thinking is at best idealistic (in the philosophical sense) and at worst hopelessly anachronistic, so we might be wise to always keep in mind the historian Carlo Ginzburg’s obiter dictum that anticipations (or precorrimenti as they are called in Italian) should always be interpreted as questions rather than answers.13 The essays that follow are preponderantly externalizing rather than internalizing, and if at times they do explore the “odds and ends” of the historical record, they uniformly do so to understand rather than to pass judgment. Beyond these caveats, however, the internalist approach, which of course can be illuminating and which to this day has many brilliant followers, risks being dismissive of the real causes as well as consequences of past political economy almost by default, particularly\n\nxvi Introduction: History and Political Economy\n\nas born from or applied in policy.14 Uniquely vulnerable to charges of anachronism, as we have suggested, the method furthermore courts teleology; it risks, in other words, completely losing hold of the very historical axis it purportedly seeks to embrace.15 Even the Austrian Harvard economist Joseph A. Schumpeter, whose seminal History of Economic Analysis in many ways remains unsurpassed, could be quick to dismiss a long dead economist who did not pass his theoretical muster as owing “his survival” merely to the refutations of a more famous thinker, completely ignoring that the “bad” theories in question might have had unfortunate consequences.16 That was simply not his interest, though there are good reasons to argue it should be ours. Of course economic ideas often have had disastrous effects on people when translated into policy, from François Quesnay’s failed physiocratic reforms in eighteenth-century France all the way through Stalinist communism to the famous “flaw” Alan Greenspan identified in his approach to regulation that allowed the 2008 financial crisis to occur and the ways in which tentative (and miscalculated) connections between public debt and low economic growth were used to justify austerity measures in its wake, by some accounts negatively influencing the lives of quite literally hundreds of millions of people.17 This lattermost was, perhaps, a moment when in the face of uncertain equilibria it would have been humane to remember (and not only figuratively) Oscar Wilde’s admonition that “to recommend thrift to the poor is both grotesque and insulting. It is like advising a man who is starving to eat less.”18 Indeed, as several of the following essays point out, we may have just as much to learn from the history of “bad” political economy as we do from charting the genealogies of currently fashionable ideas, and quite possibly much more. Such studies may point to the quintessentially contingent and political nature of much economic thinking, and, as the Columbia economist Joseph Dorfman long ago put it, since in the final analysis men’s minds may be read most clearly in their actions, the practical ambitions and political interests of the molders of economic thought must constantly be kept in view by those who seek to understand what successive generations have put into the public record.19\n\nIntroduction: History and Political Economy xvii\n\nAn openness to the variety of approaches and justifications currently characterizing the history of political economy, and a rejection of the theoretical dogmatism that has characterized much thinking about economic matters and their history in recent decades does not mean the volume completely lacks a central coherence. Instead, the contributors different approaches represent complementary perspectives on some of the central questions of economic and political life, and particularly so regarding the nature, legitimation, contention, and neutralization of power in a world increasingly driven by economic concerns. From Jeffrey Miner’s opening chapter on Medieval Genoese debates regarding public debt to Erik Grimmer Solem’s analysis of Germany’s violent call for a “place in the sun” on the eve of the Great War and Bernard Harcourt’s exploration of the genealogy of morals in the history of political economy, the chapters offer compelling alternate narratives of power—economic, political, military, territorial, and cultural—as they relate to the theories and practices of political economy in the period since economic matters first became a question of political survival. Since, in the Scottish philosopher David Hume’s celebrated phraseology, “trade” first became “an affair of state.”20 For Hume that moment occurred in the seventeenth century, and he was confounded by the lack of engagement with trade by political writers in antiquity and among the “Italians.”21 We to the contrary suspect that trade has been inextricably and momentously linked with politics from the beginnings of recorded history, but privilege two historical moments in Europe, the height of the so-called “commercial revolution” of the late Middle Ages and the “Economic Turn” of the mid-eighteenth century, which saw an explosion of printed texts and translations of a political-economic character and which quantitatively and qualitatively changed the scale of political-economic discussions.22 All told, trade’s life-or-death centrality to “the state” seems as old as the state itself, however we choose to understand that term. Pierre Bourdieu’s understanding of the genesis of the (modern) state as a process of the accumulation or concentration of different species of “capital” is especially compelling, but where Bourdieu sees taxation and levies at the heart of the “economic capital” subsumed by the emergent state, we prefer to look\n\nxviii Introduction: History and Political Economy\n\nat the ways the state managed commerce, giving (through privileges and protection) as much as taking, or even liberated it.23 Financial and corporate structures in the European world developed alongside governmental ones, and the story of the origins of political economy is not a one-sided one, in which states or proto-states simply regulated production and trade. Nor is it a teleological one, with the neoliberal internationalist state waiting for us at the end. Rather, it is a dynamic and contentious story in which the power of creditors and of capital, and of economic ideas and practices, shaped and were shaped by political communities. It is, in short, the story of wealth and power in the West and the world it often violently created; of how human beings thought about, grappled with, and overcame material hardship; organized their political and economic communities, and struggled for dominance on an increasingly larger global stage. With the rise of China as an economic superpower, “state capitalism” has rushed to the center of the economic discourse.24 But this is nothing new—the history of state capitalism, of truly political economy, is also the history of the global hegemony of the West over the past 700 years as well as of the rise of the proverbial rest.25 We maintain that a good way of gaining greater clarity with regards to this vital history—its manifest successes and egregious limitations—is to examine the intricate ways in which politico-economic ideas and practice intertwined in the city-states of late medieval Italy as much as in the oceanic empires that birthed the vexed geopolitical world in which we live. In fact, the essays contained in this volume help tell precisely this story, through snapshots from a truly global array of individuals, business enterprises, states, empires, and from the idealized domain of theories themselves. In his classic American Capitalism (1952), John Kenneth Galbraith presented a suggestive theory of “countervailing powers” in market societies, arguing that the United States had ceased to be (if it ever had been) a perfectly competitive market because of oligopolistic business practices, suggesting a solution in the countervailing influences of corporations, states, and trade unions.26 These would be the de facto building blocks of much subsequent historiography, even in fields and for periods far distant from Galbraith’s own, to the extent that they eventually came to be taken for granted: the world was made up of firms, states, and\n\nIntroduction: History and Political Economy xix\n\nworkers.27 Today, however, these categories of analysis are increasingly being questioned and indeed exploded, allowing for the reconstruction of a far richer—and more nuanced—history of power in which an array of state and non-state actors, not to mention theories, dogmas, and ideologies, vie for supremacy in a world characterized by relentless economic competition. The fact that something close to the Weberian “State” for a time gained a near monopoly on the legitimacy of power should, as many of the following essays make clear, not blind us to the contentious process that gave birth to our world, the many sources of its regulation, or the continuing relevance of non-state and trans-state power in shaping it.28 The state, then, need not be the central actor in a sophisticated history of political economy, and perhaps, some day in the future, glancing at the grim outlines of international capital in a world of diminished nation-states and diminished discourses of legitimacy, one redolent of an earlier and formative age, we can begin to sketch a new and compelling metaphor for power, one that is plural where the state is singular: as Herman Melville wrote to Nathaniel Hawthorne, “Leviathan is not the biggest fish;—I have heard of Krakens.”29 For the sake of clarity, it must be said that this volume’s use of the term “political economy” does not reflect current sectarian uses of it, whether by Marxists or by Chicago-school public choice theorists.30 Rather, it is a conscious resurrection of “political economy” in its original designation and a glimpse at its prehistory (and perhaps future). Adam Smith famously defined the discipline as a “branch of the science of a statesman or legislator” in his 1776 Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, forever linking politics, economics, and law to the legitimacy of power.31 The term ‘legitimate’ is related to the Latin legitimus, or “lawful‚” itself in turn emerging from the etymological varieties of “law‚” meaning “rule‚” perhaps in the earliest instance derived from Proto-Germanic or Indo-European roots signifying “putting” or “laying.” So fitting is the widespread historical phraseology of “giving” or “laying down the law” as a metaphor for conquest and a way of conceptualizing hierarchies of power in a variety of contexts from the commercial to the cultural. Linguistically speaking, then, law is power, and political economy was long considered its pre-eminent “science.”32\n\nxx Introduction: History and Political Economy\n\nThe questions posed, in a variety of ways, by the contributors to this volume regard the nature, legality, and consequences of such power in historical time, as well as attempts to navigate, manage, project, usurp, and neutralize it. Needless to say, this process is, and must be, ongoing, but the intellectual history of such political economy is a topic too important to be left to policy makers and economists unaware of this past. This raises, however obliquely, the perennial questions of intentionality and relevance in—and of—the history of political economy. On the one hand, historians find themselves scrambling for “relevance” in the face of the proverbial “crisis of the humanities‚” and have, perhaps naturally, turned to the histories of capitalism and political economy en masse in the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown, not unlike how the study of economic history came into being and has since been strengthened during previous periods of economic crisis—theoretical as well as practical.33 On the other hand, many historians remain deeply vexed by such calls for “relevance‚” the pressures of “presentism‚” and their collateral danger of “anachronism.”34 We do not pretend to speak for the contributors to this volume, and respect deeply their individual approaches and perspectives, but we believe that their works—independently but particularly in concert—simultaneously elucidate our complex past, clarify the problems of the present, and adumbrate future concerns. As Skinner has argued, “if they simply ply their trade‚” intellectual historians help “prevent us from becoming too readily bewitched.”35 And bewitched we have been. Yet we would venture to argue that, in the vast constellation of the history of ideas, the past plays an even more organic and integral role for the study of political economy than for many other intellectual endeavors. Already at its very outset as an academic enterprise in the eighteenth century, “history” was considered one of the principal sources of authority in economic debates because it grounded theories in what many might still consider the realm of “facts.”36 As Italy’s third professor of political economy taught his students in the early 1770s, “There is no better way of understanding the uses of a machine‚” in his example the politics of the world economy, “than to observe the process of its construction.”37 Similar sentiments have frequently resurfaced in the labyrinthine history of the subject, and the Cambridge historian\n\nIntroduction: History and Political Economy xxi\n\nand political philosopher Istvan Hont, one of the principal architects of the history of political economy over the past four decades, was utterly unapologetic about writing “with eyes firmly fixed on the challenges of today‚” justifying his work on the grounds that “the globalization debate of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries lack[ed] conceptual novelty.”38 To study the history of political economy was, in his opinion, to engage with the principal political and economic questions of the day; as he once asked, “why else would you do it?.”39 Nor by any means was Hont the first to suggest this: “A careful study of economic history,” wrote business historian Edmond E. Lincoln in the vexed early years of the 1930s, “reveals surprisingly few new ‘problems’.”40 Even Schumpeter himself, late in life, expressed hope that the historical study of political economy would “result in a new wing being added to the economist’s house.”41 Though it may be an architectural pipe dream, it remains one worthy of our attention. For, since economics cannot but be political, its history should be considered not merely a foil against bewitchment but the ballast of its very endeavor.42 There can be no doubt that we find ourselves now at a proverbial crossroads of capitalism, and that many central assumptions regarding the nature, purpose, and future of political economy are being actively rethought across the world.43 Whether with respect to long-term dynamics, like the recent peaking of international trade and subsequent decline of aggregate trade flows, or to singular yet momentous events such as Britain’s decision by popular referendum to leave the European Union and the election of Donald Trump to the US Presidency— symptoms and causes of what some have come to call “the Rage of 2016”—everything suggests we are living through a period of long unprecedented change as neglected economic forces, which scientism failed to identify and address, trigger surprising political results with real and widespread social consequences.44 Yet this is hardly the first time we find ourselves in this position, nor, bar the direst of recent predictions coming to pass, will it be the last.45 In a classic study of the history of economic thought, the economist and economic historian William J. Barber proudly proclaimed that “few things on this earth approach immortality so closely as a taut set of economic ideas.”46 When we are no longer so certain about the certainties,\n\nxxii Introduction: History and Political Economy\n\nwhen ideologies have failed, our only lodestar is and must be history. The artifacts of pre- and early modern political economy, not to mention of the postwar period, remain monuments of perennial importance for understanding how human beings organized their political and economic communities, won great wealth and lost it, conquered and were conquered. We must understand this past, the history of business, politics, and economics, on its own terms and, indeed, in its own terms, not for reasons of antiquarianism but because they shed precious light on some of the most pressing challenges of our own time, including how we got “here‚” wherever that happens to be. The following essays testify to the rich and powerful lessons to be had from such a historical understanding of political economy, and will hopefully serve as inspiration for further work on the role of power in our long economic age. *** Although the road was winding and somewhat bumpy, this volume emerged from a conference we organized at Harvard Business School in the fall of 2013, and we are grateful to that institution, and particularly to the Faculty Chair of its Business History Initiative, Geoffrey Jones, for making the event possible. In addition to the contributors represented here, the success of that conference owed to the extraordinary participation of S.M. Amadae, David Armitage, Lawrin Armstrong, Ed Balleisen, Paul Cheney, Rebecca Henderson, Geoffrey Jones, Julius Kirshner, Michael Kwass, Sreemati Mitter, Isaac Nakhimovsky, Emma Rothschild, Jacob Soll, Anoush Terjanian, and Richard Tuck. Kate Jenkins and Jayanthi Narayanaswamy also provided invaluable assistance during the editing of this volume. In December of 1941, just weeks after the United States entered World War Two and while the Great Depression was still spurring new investigations of the economy and its history, N.S.B. Gras, the “father of business history” and the school’s first Isidor Straus Professor of Business History, presented a paper titled “Capitalism—Concepts and History” at the American Historical Association’s annual meeting. As his respondent, Gras personally chose Raymond de Roover, his former M.B.A. student, who was then a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Chicago. De Roover’s reply played with one of Gras’s central economic-historical conceits—the transition from petty capitalism to commercial capitalism, and a corresponding shift from the central\n\nIntroduction: History and Political Economy xxiii\n\nimportance of the traveling to the sedentary merchant—and laid out the remarkable case for a “commercial revolution” in the thirteenth century, first among the Italians and then in the Low Countries.47 De Roover, especially with his 1963 magnum opus The Rise and Decline of the Medici Bank, would go on to become one of the driving forces in the economic historiography of the late Middle Ages and Renaissance. When Wallace K. Ferguson surveyed the field of Renaissance economic history in 1960, he made a point of mentioning Gras’s importance in the development of the field. Business history, “in the sense in which Professor Gras envisaged it‚” he argued, encompassed works from Armando Sapori’s seminal studies of the medieval Bardi, Peruzzi, and del Bene firms; to most of De Roover’s work; to Frederic Lane’s study of the Renaissance Venetian merchant Andrea Barbarigo; and even Iris Origo’s Merchant of Prato.48 That this volume should have originated at Harvard Business School is, then, more than a happy coincidence. We have brought together “Business Historians” and historians of many other stripes precisely because we share the broadness of vision that brought together Gras and De Roover, one we believe still remains fruitful for historical research to this day. And it is also important that this volume begins in the commercial republics of premodern Italy. According to Emma Rothschild, David Hume’s well-known 1754 essay “On Refinement in the Arts” proposed nothing less than a “Florentine Model” of political economy; Florence, whose history Hume loved, represented for him a paradigmatic form of the “opulent republic” in which democracy and commerce were united.49 Whether or not this is actually true of the historical Florence, Enlightenment thinkers found in the Renaissance (and especially in the commercial and industrial cities of Northern and Central Italy) models for understanding how wealth and virtue, luxury and political moderation could coexist. Hume’s essay was just one entry in the then raging debate over luxury and its presumably deleterious effects on public virtue. We are again faced with questions, as pressing as ever in human history, about the corrupting influence of wealth and the practices that produce it on our polities. These are civilizational questions and, indeed, existential ones. And they are also personal and moral questions. When so many ask simply how do we get rich, we should again\n\nxxiv Introduction: History and Political Economy\n\nbe asking what it means for us to be both rich and good. With Hume we assert that wealth and virtue are not incompatible, and with him we look to the past in order to understand where we are and where we might be headed. Robert Fredona Sophus A.

Across this formative period, the various individual debts were periodically consolidated, occasionally reformed, and very rarely paid down. Then, between 1407 and around 1450, the lion’s share of the remaining capital was consolidated into a single mass, administered by an institution that would come to be known as the Casa di San Giorgio. A marvel of premodern public finance and political economy, the Casa was a kind of shareholders’ consortium that would play the lynchpin role in Genoa’s communal finances for nearly four hundred years, until it was abolished by Napoleon around the turn of the nineteenth century. The precocity, scale, and endurance of premodern Genoa’s communal debt attracted the notice of contemporaries. It continues to draw modern and scholarly interest as well. Commentators and opinions have run the gamut from Machiavelli, who famously praised the Casa di San Giorgio by calling it a “state within a state,” to Karl Marx, who saw in\n\nJ.

Miner\n\nGenoa’s and Venice’s experiments with public credit the birth of “one of the most powerful levers of primitive accumulation.”1 Sovereign debt and lending to states continue to be major, if contentious, features of the modern political economy, and scholarship on the subject continues to generate new questions and lines of research.2 For those interested in the historical roots of modern political and economic conditions, the experiences of the independent city-states of premodern Italy (Genoa, Venice, and Florence) continue to be a popular starting point.3 However, it remains an open question whether or not we should take medieval and Renaissance Italy seriously as the origin point of “modern” political economy or as a major stage in the development of public finance in particular. On the one hand, Italy remains a major point of reference in symposia, general syntheses, and new research.4 On the other hand, scholars of Italy have voiced some of the strongest objections to broad lines of interpretation, preferring to emphasize diversity and discontinuity over general similarities or common patterns of development.5 Of these objections, the most significant was raised by Anthony Molho.6 A detailed reconstruction of the Florentine case in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Molho argued, showed two things. First, that Florentine experiments in public finance were less modern than they initially appeared. Second, that the transition to a supposedly more bureaucratic and modern (and therefore powerful and effective) fiscal regime under republican government was undone more or less completely by the Medici, indicating that progress in public finance was neither inevitable nor irreversible. On the back of this analysis, he concluded that change in public finance depended on complex internal political developments, a conclusion that ran counter to much of what had been previously accepted—that all European states faced what amounted to evolutionary pressures from warfare, pressures that resulted in either modernization or elimination.7 This chapter considers Genoa’s experience from roughly 1200 to 1450, alongside recent research on other cities, both Italian and nonItalian. It argues that the modernity of late medieval Italian political economy is both more and less real than it seems. Over the course of the fourteenth century, the Genoese created what amounted to a permanent public debt for their republic. In line with the findings of social\n\nGenoa, Liguria, and the Regional … 3\n\nscientific literature, this does seem to have amounted to a revolution in the realm of political economy, as the commune of Genoa shifted permanently and heavily to debt as a means of communal finance, resulting in the creation of a permanent public debt. However, this major transition enshrined practices, principles, and ideas that ran precisely counter to what we might expect a modernizing state to have sought— relative autonomy for regional subjects, a basically contractual notion of Genoese sovereignty over Liguria. This counter-intuitive consequence of the invention of permanent public indebtedness was a result of the distinctive contours of Genoa’s political regime and its position in the Mediterranean. At the same time, a shift to permanent indebtedness did move Genoese ideas about citizenship and political membership closer to ideas we would recognize as familiar—a citizen body as the set of taxpayers, rather than a citizen body as all adult males eligible to bear arms. In light of Genoa’s unique position between regional and panMediterranean circuits of exchange, the chapter will close with a brief comparative consideration of the importance of regional economies to different cities’ experiences with medieval public finance.\n\nWhat Were the Compere? It is critically important to start with the medieval vocabulary. Otherwise thoughtful scholars have at times put forward explanations of Genoa and its public finances that are flawed, because they have been led astray by modern vocabularies that only partially approximate the past they purport to describe. This is particularly true for social scientists who have most often used Genoese history as part of a longer-term investigation of the connection between property rights, political institutions, and economic change. Compere, what scholars usually mean by Genoa’s “public debt,” appear in historical records as early as the mid-twelfth century.8 In this period, a compera referred to a short-term purchase of communal fortresses or taxes to be collected. Over time, however, the Genoese adapted the compera, changing it into the instrument that would eventually form the basis of a permanent communal debt. In the late twelfth century, partly\n\n4 J. Miner\n\ndue to imperial pressure and influence, Genoa and other northern Italian cities began to experiment with new taxes, especially direct taxes based on assessments of propertied wealth (called an estimo elsewhere, but more often an avaria in Genoa).9 Everywhere direct taxation was tried, it provoked serious social tensions. In Genoa, these were resolved by combining a forced one-time contribution to the commune (the avaria ) with a compera: The new compera required individuals to pay a given amount, but compensated contributors with an annual percentage (usually 10%, sometimes lower) of their contribution until the original sum was repaid. This annual percentage was obtained from the income of one or more communal taxes, which were specifically assigned to participants (partecipes in the Latin). Unlike earlier versions of a compera, this new form allowed participants to freely transfer their shares and the associated income to a third party, and a lively secondary market in compera shares quickly developed. This combination of contribution, compensation, and market proved fruitful and expedient for the commune, which was able to raise much larger sums of ready cash than by other available means. As has often been the case, the need for immediate funds quickly outstripped the income or funds assigned for repayment.10 In a few bursts of acute need from the late thirteenth through late fourteenth centuries, Genoa created so many compere that the city was effectively left with a permanent communal debt, despite the fact that legal documents creating new compere continued to optimistically include clauses allowing for eventual repayment.11 By 1400, the mass of compere, now totaling over 3 million Genoese lire in face value, had become unwieldy and burdensome. For a variety of political and economic reasons, the commune of Genoa and the administrators of the compere consolidated the vast majority into a single body, the compere of San Giorgio, later called the Casa di San Giorgio or simply “San Giorgio.” This not only simplified the administration of tax collection, but it also standardized the compensation promised to participants at 8%.12 Borrowing, however, continued apace and by the mid-fifteenth century, the commune was borrowing against future paghe, or interest payments and issuing lire di paghe, a kind of promissory note for the seized payments. Here, too, a lively secondary market developed and lire di paghe\n\nGenoa, Liguria, and the Regional … 5\n\n(deferred payments on the commune’s consolidated debt) could also be used as a kind of substitute currency in the regional economy. In fact, exactly what terms should be used to describe the compere is a matter of disagreement among scholars.13 Traditionally, the compere have simply been called the “debito pubblico” or public debt. At times, they are more specifically designed as Genoa’s “funded debt,” because specific incomes were assigned to service the debt, or at others the “long-term debt,” which distinguishes the compere from short-term loans at interest contracted with individual bankers.14 These terms have not proven satisfying to all, and some scholars have advocated avoiding the term “public debt” altogether, preferring to refer to the compere as “forced loans” instead.15 These scholars would prefer to reserve the term public debt for voluntary loans to the state. This has the advantage of highlighting the fact that the compere were not bonds, as much contemporary public debt is, and shares in a compera were not usually initially acquired voluntarily. Instead, a sum of money was demanded by the commune, which then could require payment from the citizens, often in proportion to an estimate of their propertied wealth.16 Yet while “forced loan” is mostly correct, it still fails to capture the full diversity and flexibility of the compera instrument. In some cases, contributions actually were voluntary. In one case, communal officers took out a regular, voluntary loan. Lenders were to be exempted from an upcoming direct tax (an avaria ) in exchange for their contribution. When the direct tax failed to be collected, the voluntary loan was converted into a compera.17 In other cases, the commune assigned shares in a new compera directly to individuals who armed or constructed galleys for a communal fleet, compensating armed service directly and omitting altogether the forced loan portion of the transaction.18 So although public debt, forced loan, bond and other modern terms cover part of the Genoese fiscal system, none is a perfect fit and, to make matters more complicated, what term fits best changes depending on what period one considers. The problem is less the possibility for miscommunication between scholars using different vocabularies, but rather assumptions that are brought in the wake of identifying the compere too closely with a neat modern concept. This has been most often true in social scientific\n\n6 J. Miner\n\nliterature that looks to use the late medieval or Renaissance past as a laboratory in which to explore commitment problems between sovereigns and their lenders.19 These studies often begin from a highly stylized hypothetical problem (in this case, how lenders can safely extend credit to an absolute sovereign with the power to repudiate all debts with impunity) and a solution that is known to exist in advance (some form of constraint on the sovereign), and then try to work backward.20 This opens up the road to problems raised by subtle differences between complicated premodern realities and simplifying modern vocabularies. One such case is the use of the term “interest” to describe income to shareholders in the compere. In the modern world, the interest rate on sovereign debt reflects the workings of international markets for credit and debt, so that states that are better creditors pay lower interest rates on their debt than those who are relatively worse. Thus, the rate of interest charged on public debt can be used as a measure of how credibly states commit to repay their debts.21 The compere paid a percentage of their value to participants every year, which does look like a rate of interest. However, the rate of return on a share in a compera (whether before or after the consolidation of the Casa di San Giorgio) was not an interest rate in the way scholars have assumed.22 The rate of return was theoretically fixed, but varied in practice every year, depending on the income from the various taxes assigned to the debt. In effect, when scholars look at declining rates of return and see declining interest rates, they assume that what they are looking at is a successful accommodation between the state and its creditors. Although that is possible, what this declining rate more directly reflects is the declining importance of Genoa’s port and, possibly, the ineffectiveness of taxation.23 Treating Genoa’s public debt as a commitment problem also assumes a clearer distinction between the “public” and “private” portions of the institutions than the sources warrant. It is necessary analytically for the two to be separated so one can act as a “check” on the other, but the compere and the Casa are not necessarily easy to categorize in this way.24 Medieval Genoa was a city that, even more than its peers, organized communal life in ways that are extremely difficult to disentangle. Unlike nearly all modern public debts, in Genoa the commune did not directly collect the taxes it used to pay the creditors. Instead, it farmed\n\nGenoa, Liguria, and the Regional … 7\n\nthe collection of taxes out to private individuals or groups in exchange for a flat fee up front.25 This is particularly the case after the founding of the Casa di San Giorgio, when the compere passed into a single body administered by a group of creditors, and then as the Casa came to collect taxes on behalf of the republic, and at times also operate like a public bank.26 Occasionally, the Casa, as in previous arrangements such as the two maone of Chios, took over the administration of Genoese territory directly.27 For some, the compere look less like a public debt (retained and administered by the state) than a consortium of individuals sucking away resources that properly belonged to the state (with all the moral judgment this implies).28 Rather than a public debt that enhanced the borrowing power of the state, the compere were, in this reading, a tool for exploitation by private interests. How one distinguishes the private from public elements of the system is critical for longer-term analyses, many of which focus on trying to establish how external bodies can constrain sovereigns not to default on their debts, thus enabling stable long-term borrowing.29 But as with the issues of labeling the compere as forced loans and their annual payments as interest, the historical reality is too complex for easy analytical clarity. Careful attention to the individuals involved shows series interpenetration and relations that belie any sense of the compere as “privatized” or separate from the commune. To pick only one example: Tommaso Ottone was a Genoese notary who became the collector of a compera in the 1360s, as the culmination of a career that appears first in documents when he was the scribe of a communal war fleet. Later, he obtained a significant stake in the compere, used his shares as security to purchase a tax farm, served for a time on the doge’s governing council, and even represented a Genoese inhabitant of the Byzantine Empire in a dispute with the commune regarding taxes.30 Thus, whatever institutional mechanisms may on paper have secured Genoa’s compere, the practical reality is that default was prevented by multiple, overlapping social bonds as much as by any formal institutional structure. In light of these difficulties, what should be made of the compere? Were they a public debt? I would argue that they were, for in all their various configurations, they were long-term, interest-bearing communal obligations. Granted, it is essential to avoid anachronism if we are\n\n8 J. Miner\n\nto understand properly how medieval Genoa’s debt practices developed in response to its particular historical circumstances. But given that the compere fulfilled many of the same political and economic functions for the Genoese commune as modern public debts do for nationstates (providing access to credit for the commune, allowing short-term cash to be raised based on longer-term tax receipts), it seems unhelpful to stand so firmly on semantic differences. Whether or not “revolution” is the appropriate term for what took place, a major transition occurred in Genoa across the long fourteenth century.31 The capacity of the commune to commit itself to long-term financial arrangements with individuals in exchange for a share of its take from taxation led to a permanent state of indebtedness as a normal and (mostly) acceptable part of the regional political economy. Genoa did undergo something like a financial revolution, but it was not driven by changes in property rights, nor did it result in a massive expansion of communal power. Instead, the transition to permanent public indebtedness had its origins in the distinctive intersection between the political economy of Genoa’s dominions in Liguria and the demands of long-distance trade in the Mediterranean.\n\nCommunal Debt, Regional Subjects, Taxation, and Membership The transition from a commune that paid its debts to a commune that lived in a permanent state of arrears was significant. However, the effects on Genoa and its dominions was not the creation of a modern or centralized state. Those who caution against anachronism are correct in general, even if the move to cut the medieval and early modern past off semantically from later experiments in public indebtedness is probably not the correct one. Interestingly, Genoa seems to undercut the assumption that strong states and stable debts are closely linked. In fact, Genoa’s greatest expansion of its public debt took place in a period known rather for the weakness than the strength of central authority.32 In order to understand the relationship between Genoa’s communal debt and its political economy, it is necessary to step outside the city\n\nGenoa, Liguria, and the Regional … 9\n\nwalls and think about the place of Genoa’s port in its regional (Ligurian) and Mediterranean contexts. The effectiveness of the compere stemmed at least as much, if not more, from the taxes and income that paid the participants than it did from Genoese cleverness in figuring out that short-term cash could be obtained in exchange for long-term streams of income. What makes the Genoese experiment in borrowing interesting is that it shows clearly how a set of pressures common to many cities in the period (military expenditure), though met with a broadly similar response (borrowing against future tax revenue), ultimately produced such a highly distinctive outcome.33 The basic structures that shaped the power and potential of longterm debt in Genoa lay in its districtus or regional state. A major watershed moment in the creation of a regional dominion came in the period from 1199 to 1204.34 Although the Genoese had made efforts to exert influence and control over their regional neighbors before, both along the coast and in the mountains, during this period a major segment of its regional dominion was crystallized in a series of pacts between Genoa and the other towns of the Riviere. Although the specific terms of the treaties varied somewhat, the key provisions were all basically identical: Subject towns were to provide military aid, to pay collecte (extraordinary taxes), to contribute to the maintaining of a garrison at Bonifacio on Corsica, and to allow legal disputes between men of the town to be judged in Genoa, according to Genoese law.35 The most important element for Genoa’s future political economy, however, was the requirement that subjects obey Genoese regulations concerning navigation, particularly the requirement to visit Genoa first, before traveling beyond Barcelona or Sardinia. This last was critical as it meant all Ligurian ships would pay Genoese port taxes before engaging in longdistance trade. After the turn of the thirteenth century, although it took another couple of generations to firm up the boundaries of Genoa’s dominion, the essential configuration of Genoa’s regional dominion remained stable. One of the most remarkable things about this configuration was that it did not attempt to exclude Genoa’s regional subjects from the privileges, exemptions, and other trading advantages that the Genoese fought so hard to extract from sovereigns around the Mediterranean,\n\n10 J. Miner\n\nbeginning in the period after the first crusade (ca. 1100).36 Agreements with smaller towns in Liguria frequently offered regional subjects the right to enjoy any “honors, immunities, franchises, graces, privileges and benefits of all kinds conceded to the commune of Genoa or the men of Genoa, now and in the future.”37 When treaties secured advantageous terms, they often applied to, “every Genoese or person who is held or reputed to be Genoese, is ruled by the Genoese or who enjoys the benefits of the Genoese.”38 When this status was restricted, it was at the behest of local rulers jealous of their tax receipts, not that of the Genoese. In the thirteenth century Treaty of Nymphaeum between Genoa and the Byzantine emperor, any Genoese in Pera or Constantinople were required to present some kind of documentation in order to enjoy the tax exemptions conceded to their community.39 Interestingly, this was not included at the instigation of the Genoese, but of the emperor, who was well aware of how merchants might strategically position themselves as members of this or that community depending on the rules of the customs house.40 This state of affairs seems to have continued, for we know that Venetian representatives in Constantinople in the fourteenth century worried that restricting access to Venice’s privileges would induce many merchants to “turn Genoese.”41 One of the key goals of Genoese rule, then, was to co-opt its regional subjects into a subordinate position in Mediterranean trade, eliminating them as rivals but also subjecting them to the port taxes that were essential to its system of political economy. Without this system, and its capacity to extract labor and value from long-distance commerce, Genoa’s experiment with long-term debt would never have begun. The ability to borrow successfully did not spring into being from abstract fiscal know-how or political will. Instead, it depended on the capacity of taxes to meet the demands of compere participants. This capacity was, in turn, secured by a Mediterranean-wide system of privileged trade. Genoa’s fiscal innovations were not produced by a “capitalist” attitude to wealth, but by a set of political, demographic, and economic circumstances which focused Genoa’s fiscal system on its own port above all else.42 The insistence that regional subjects put into port in Genoa was absolutely essential to the city’s Mediterranean ambitions, though it was less\n\nGenoa, Liguria, and the Regional … 11\n\nabout eliminating competitors than it was about ensuring that as many people as possible paid the all-important port taxes. By diverting more traffic to Genoa itself, the architects of Genoa’s dominions ensured that their city would be poised to capitalize on their region’s most abundant resource—knowledge of navigation and the sea.43 Those regional subjects who did wish to travel abroad could do so safely, at least relatively so, under the umbrella of the mother city’s military, diplomatic, and legal protections. This political and economic blurring of boundaries was expressed in cultural and ideological terms as well.44 That Genoa sucked up a greater share of its region’s population than its peers elsewhere in Italy is another sign of the underlying limits of the economy and the way the Genoese actively shaped their region to focus economically on the capital.45 Focusing traffic on the capital city and taxing, it was a sensible choice, born of the basic problem that Liguria produced only a very few products for export. Small ports along the western coast produced various agricultural goods. Sanremo, for example, had about a thousand hearths in its whole territory in the sixteenth century, when it was known as a grower and exporter of a variety of citrus products.46 The eastern Riviera was known already in the Middle Ages for its wines. Vernazza wine was praised by Boccaccio, Dante, and Petrarch.47 Unsurprisingly, it was singled out for high export duties.48 Nevertheless, there was not a great deal of underlying productivity to tap in order to finance long-term public debt.49 Instead, the Genoese fiscal system focused on controlling key points of intersection in broader economic networks. The profits from most of Genoa’s possessions in the region seem to have been meager, and the amount of income they brought in was often far outweighed by the costs of acquiring them.50 Tighter fiscal and economic controls on the hinterland, then, would have cost more time and effort than could be recouped in tax or tribute. The effort spent focusing Liguria on Genoa created a strong and interconnected web of economic and political relations. When the commune began to create more debts, and thus more taxes to pay the interest, this web was critically important in shaping the outcome. Although the growth of debt was closely connected with the demands of warfare in the fourteenth century as traditional accounts have it, when Genoa\n\n12 J. Miner\n\ntransitioned to a political economy based on permanent indebtedness, the result was not simply a strengthening of the state. It had the effect of intensifying certain relationships at the expense of others. This can be most clearly seen by considering two major periods of challenge to Genoa’s regional dominion in the fourteenth century, one in the late 1360s and another in the early 1380s. These challenges were important enough to merit recording in the city’s Libri Iurium or books of privileges.51 Both disputes were direct responses to decisions about war finance, and they were significant for two reasons. First, they forced the Genoese and their subjects to articulate explicitly the benefits and obligations attendant on both subjects and rulers in the regional state. Second, they show how and why the rising tide of debt pushed the Genoese commune to intensify its fiscal attention in the capital instead of trying to intensify its controls in Liguria more broadly. Here, the analysis will focus on one town, Sanremo, because it was a key protagonist in both periods and the documents bear witness to the issues most clearly.52 In 1361, Sanremo was one of the several towns to protest against what they saw as excessive demands by the commune of Genoa, in this case for military support against a different rebellious town in the hinterland.53 Their argument was particularist—it depended on a close reading of the specific terms of the lordship Genoa had purchased over the town.54 Essentially, they argued that their specific relationship to the dominant city did not include the right to demand military service in the mountains. The representatives of Genoa, by contrast, based a key part of their argument on what we might consider general or statelevel terms: Because Sanremo and its men enjoyed the privileges of the Genoese “in diverse parts of the world,” they could thus reasonably be expected to defend Genoese interests wherever they might be.55 The result was ultimately a compromise—while it recognized that Genoa’s representatives were correct in principle, the legal officials charged with the case limited what could be demanded of the subject town and reaffirmed that they were not, in fact, to be subjected to taxes or impositions not covered in their earlier submission to Genoa. The compromise that preserved the status quo ante of Genoa’s Ligurian dominions in 1361 itself became a bone of contention in\n\nGenoa, Liguria, and the Regional … 13\n\n1381. In the meantime, fiscal matters had changed substantially. The second round of dispute took place under strained circumstances, shortly after Genoa snatched crushing defeat from the jaws of nearly certain victory in the War of Chioggia (1378–1381). During this conflict, the Genoese had shifted heavily toward financing war using compere, rather than the sorts of direct impositions that had caused the earlier controversy with Sanremo and other subject towns.56 In the 1350s, just after being decimated by the plague, the commune had created about 450,000 lire worth of compere, also fighting Venice. Around 1380, the commune mustered the astronomical sum of 1.2 million lire, increasing the face value of the commune’s public debt by something between a third and half in the space of 3 years. In part, the legal disputes of the 1360s likely played a role in this shift, as they indicated the difficulty that could arise in compelling or even requesting subject cities to contribute manpower to Genoese military endeavors. The compere may have been nominally a “forced” loan, but the possibility of compensation meant that the amount of passive and active resistance would be lessened. As a result, the Genoese preferred to raise taxes in the port itself and reinforce communal monopolies over commodities like salt, which needed to be imported.57 In part, this no doubt also reflects the long-term influences of the plague. As in Florence, the effect of the plague must have meant that coin, rather than labor, was relatively plentiful and thus encouraged the use of compere, rather than attempting to force subject cities to provide (military) labor, when preparing a communal fleet or army.58 As a result, when the men of Sanremo returned to court in the early 1380s, arguing that the specific terms of the 1361 settlement had exempted them from Genoese taxation everywhere in the world because of specific terms in the earlier treaty, the arbitrators sided decisively with the representatives of Genoa. In a clever, if tendentious, reading of the previous dispute, the men of Sanremo argued that when the arbitrators had declared them free from “new impositions” in 1361, this, in combination with the earliest treaty between the communities, made them immune from Genoese taxation throughout the world.59 Not only that, but they also argued that the arbitrators’ sentence had absolved them of the need to put into port at Genoa before sailing out of the district.60\n\n14 J. Miner\n\nThese arguments, if accepted, would have preserved the rights of the Sanremesi to benefit from the Genoese system, while exempting them from contributing to it in any way. Unsurprisingly, the hand-picked representatives of Genoa’s commune put in charge of the case disagreed. In the 1380s, the cumulative effect of generations of pressure on the other cities of Liguria—political and military pressure at first, but also the politically reinforced economic gravity of the dominant city—created a situation in which aid in kind was both resented and less effective than it had been in 1200. Sanremo had been effective at resisting the requirement to contribute men and arms. Attempting to avoid port taxes was another matter entirely. Yet the transition toward debt finance and away from levies of men and arms took place within the long-established framework of relations and pattern of interactions. This emerges clearly from the content of a burst of legal activity undertaken by Genoa in the same years, as a special commission was appointed to review the cases of individuals, towns, and corporations claiming exemptions of any kind from the many different forms of communal taxation.61 In a little over a year from spring 1384 through the summer of 1385, this group, clearly responding to pressures created by the massive increase in taxation that had taken place in 1378–1381, reviewed about fifty cases, rejecting, revising, and approving exemptions claimed by feudal nobles, subject communities, men with more than 12 children, and those granted exemptions for exemplary military service to the commune. Because of the moment in which it took place, we might expect this to have been a move to rationalize the collection of taxes by eliminating exemptions and pushing subjects toward paying port taxes rather than making direct contributions to military activity. Instead, what took place was a careful review of existing treaties, bargains, and privileges to make sure that the letter of the law was respected.62 The committee seems to have paid particularly close attention to commercial taxes, dating carefully each exemption granted and limiting its scope to taxes already in existence, taking care to preserve the reach of the most recently imposed duties, and thus the income of the city’s creditors. Inside the city, the long-term consequences of this system had helped push the wealth of the Genoese abroad, into Mediterranean commerce.\n\nGenoa, Liguria, and the Regional … 15\n\nBy encouraging and supporting its own citizens’ Mediterranean ambitions, the commune of Genoa had enhanced the shaping force of Liguria’s marginal agricultural productivity on the city’s economy and fiscal policies. As one of Genoa’s own rulers noted in 1363, the wealth of the Genoese was so deeply invested in trade that even an assessment of their goods and property was a far from a simple matter.63 This made measures like Florence’s famous catasto, which inventoried the goods of its subjects down to the last cow, both difficult practically and unpopular politically.64 Not only that, but even in the weakened economic conjuncture of the later fourteenth century, with the lingering effects of the plague and multiple expensive and inconclusive wars with Venice, Genoa’s port was still profitable enough to support a huge burst of borrowing against its taxes.65 The need to tap the wealth of the capital’s citizens in order to perpetuate the system itself encouraged changes in the nature of citizenship and membership in the community. Membership in the community continued to entail the legal protection of the commune, but it came increasingly to be identified with supporting the burden of taxation and borrowing imposed by the city in times of need. In one well-documented case, a man from Lucca who had obtained Genoese citizenship was kidnapped and held for ransom by members of the Spinola clan, one of Genoa’s feudal lineages living in the hinterland.66 He was able to secure communal sanctions against his attackers, who had challenged his citizenship, because he was able to produce physical documentation of his having paid the avaria.67 The quality of his legal representation and social network was clearly inferior to that of his opponents, but participating in public finance was enough to call the commune to his defense and secure its judgment against his opponents. Interestingly, the damages he was able to recover from the Spinola came in the form of shares in the compere, suggesting another way in which public debt may have affected social and economic relations in Liguria.68 The reverse side of this linking of citizenship with public finance was that communal officials increasingly attempted to revoke or withdraw the privileges of citizenship from those individuals who attempted to flout the law and, especially, to avoid communal taxation. When, in 1372, Genoa’s doge heard that there were ships avoiding the port\n\n16 J. Miner\n\nbecause they did not wish to pay taxes, he wrote in no uncertain terms to condemn their attitude. He and his council threatened that, the ships and their passengers will not be treated as Genoese, they will not enjoy the benefits or immunities which the Genoese enjoy, neither will justice be done for them by any Genoese magistrate in Genoa or any part of the world whatsoever. If they are attacked or suffer damage from any person, Genoese or not, they will not receive justice and no such legal case will be heard.69\n\nThis was the corollary of the tighter nexus between fisc and citizen—if citizenship was a status predicated on certain economic arrangements, then refusal to participate might invalidate that status.70 Although the pressure of rising public debt did not transform Liguria into a more recognizably modern state, the effects within Genoa do seem to have exerted pressure to transform an older model of citizenship, predicated on active military service, into one that looks more familiar—a taxbased and economic model of citizenship.71 In sum, the expansion of Genoa’s temporary debts into a permanent public debt across the later Middle Ages had multiple causes and effects. Despite what can be identified in retrospect as pointillist “progress” away from something that looks like a “domain state” (finance based on communal possessions, and impositions of service) toward a “tax state,” longterm transitions of this kind are not discernable in particular moments like Genoa’s reform of privileges in the 1380s. The capacity of Genoa’s commune to sustain a remarkable amount of permanent debt was a product of two logics that intersected in the city’s port: military support of privileged trade abroad in the Mediterranean and a local dominion that focused Ligurian patterns of political and economic life on Genoa as much as possible. The burden of debt was sustainable, or at least serviceable because of the tight nexus between these two. The expansion of the compere enhanced the commune’s military capability, but it also led to a tightening of bonds between the commune and its Genoese creditors. In Genoa’s dominion, by contrast, the capital city’s debts ultimately reinforced existing relations and the system of individual privileges and treaties of a patchwork dominion, rather than driving a search for a reformed or intensified regional state. In subsequent centuries, the Genoese elite\n\nGenoa, Liguria, and the Regional … 17\n\nwould use the Casa di San Giorgio to try and tighten fiscal control, and to rationalize tax collection in the city and its territory. However, this was more a response to the weakening economic foundations of Genoa’s port than anything else. The lowered rate of return on the compere, then, should be first attributed to an erosion of revenue as opposed to strengthening bonds of fidelity between the commune and its creditors.\n\nFiscal Change and Regional Dynamics Medieval Genoa’s state of permanent indebtedness was the result of a combination of factors. Most notably, these were a distinctive regional geography and the political choice of its civic elite to invest heavily, politically, and economically, in long-distance trade. As broad models of fiscal change have suggested, warfare was critically important in driving borrowing. The specific configurations of that borrowing, however, had a distinctively Genoese cast, linking urban creditors, regional taxation, and Mediterranean exchange in ways that do not fit neatly into modern analytical vocabularies. Rather than a property of Genoa’s urban environment alone, the compere suggest the critical effect of public finance on the late medieval political economy should be sought in regional interactions, even if the region in question was not always politically independent (as in Iberia or the Low Countries) or unified politically. In line with what has been suggested by other scholars, the Genoese experience suggests that changes in medieval political economy may be better understood as the outcome of regional dynamics, more so as the outcome of either the strictly internal dynamics of a particular city or the generalized fiscal pressure generated by warfare. As Genoa did in adapting a known credit instrument, the compera, to shifting circumstances, Valencia modeled its civic debt on the censal, the most widely used form of personal credit in its region.72 When the cities in the Low Countries began selling voluntary annuities called rentes or renten, this was, unsurprisingly, an extension of an already popular form of agricultural credit, the census contract.73 In city after city, a link can be found between the demands of war finance and changes in public credit. At the same time, civic public debts were expressions of pre-existing and underlying practices typical of regional economies than strictly urban novelties.74\n\n18 J. Miner\n\nThe regional dimension is even more critical in trying to understand the subsequent effects of this broad move to urban public credit. In Liguria, Genoa’s rising indebtedness in the fourteenth century tended to reaffirm its relatively decentralized and privilege-based configuration. This was, in no small part, due to the fact that the regional economy had already been shaped by multiple generations worth of political choices to focus relatively intensely on the port of Genoa. Tuscany, by contrast, was home to multiple powerful urban centers jockeying among themselves and each developing its own civic finances in competition and comparison with each other.75 Here, Genoa, like Venice, may prove to be even more of an outlier, for neither of the two Italian maritime republics possessed a substantial agrarian base, making both dependent on and invested in a long-distance trade to an extent unmatched by any other community in Europe.76 The medieval Genoese set up institutions of credit and debt that retain a very familiar cast, despite the centuries that have passed. The problem with teleological readings of late medieval public finance, readings that either trace an evolutionary genealogy to the present or set up abstract and ahistorical “problems” to be solved by reaching an alreadygiven endpoint, is not simply that they make a vocabulary mistake, using “public debt” when it is inappropriate. The problem with teleological readings is that they misunderstand the meaning of the institutions they analyze, because they assume that the phenomena that are most familiar to us must be those phenomena that led to us. Instead, what emerges from a more detailed consideration of premodern public finance is a renewed sense for the divergent ways complexes of institutions, especially regional complexes, rather than single specific traits or practices, shaped historical outcomes.\n\nNotes 1.
