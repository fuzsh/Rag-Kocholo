        "text": "★★★☆\n\n“All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the Lord weigheth the spirits.”\n\n“Ex Machina” is quite cognizant of Hollywood’s predisposition to incorporate memorable lines into its films for creative reasons or otherwise more financially motivated ones. (Does “I’m gonna make him an offer he can’t refuse” come to mind? Oh, no? How about “Toto, I’ve got a feeling we’re not in Kansas anymore?”) In spirit with the industry and, of course “Ex Machina,” I decided to throw in a line of my own from Proverbs 16:2. I admit I have my own monotheistic leanings, but I nevertheless feel it brings the film to a full 360-degree circle.\n\nEx Machina is one of the best sci-fi films I have seen. The ultimate measure of how well any film holds up under both critical and the general movie-goers’ reception is whether or not it resonates with them on a personal, emotional and logically satisfying level. Ex Machina does. The entire movie with its many original renditions of conventions plucked from the genres of mystery, sci-fi, drama and monster-in-a-house is much more complex than your typical run-of-the-mill version of cat-and-mouse. Though the ending is a bit trippy and shocking, it is indeed the logical conclusion of the film’s central dramatic question that Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) asks of Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac) at one point during the movie: what purpose does AI (short for artificial intelligence) serve? Honestly, I don’t have an answer. Frankly I don’t think it needs one just as Stanley Kubrick’s “2001: A Space Odyssey” leaves its meaning open to interpretation. But there are some particularly attractive ideas that the movie ponders."
