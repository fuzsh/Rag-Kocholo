        "text": "By: Jenna Moloney\n\nEx Machina is a science-fiction movie about a scientist that built a robot so similar to a\n\nhuman that, aside from her appearance, it could be mistaken for one. The scientist, Nathan, is\n\nvery intelligent and he takes every precautionary measure in his experiment, but alcohol\n\nsometimes diminishes his alertness. The robot fakes emotion to get Caleb, the subject being\n\ntested, to help it escape. In the end, the robot kills Nathan and locks Caleb in the building,\n\nleaving him behind as it disguises itself as a human and flies to the city in the helicopter meant\n\nfor Caleb. The conclusion suggests that the robot lives its “life” as a human, and Caleb is left in\n\nthe scientist’s house to die.\n\nThis movie was very interesting. The actress that played the robot (Alicia Vikander)\n\nportrayed the reactions of a robot very well. The motion picture overall discussed genuine and\n\nfalse emotion, the art of deceiving, alcoholism, the wonder of scientific discoveries, and what it\n\nmeans to be a human. Although it did not end in the way I would have liked, I enjoyed the movie\n\nholistically.\n\nThere were a lot of scenes in the movie in which the frame was moving. In the scene\n\nwhen Caleb is waiting for Nathan to fall asleep, the camera is continuously zooming out as\n\nNathan talks pointlessly in his intoxicated form. The movement of the frame backward as Caleb\n\nstares forward adds to the thought process of Caleb: slowly and cautiously waiting. When a\n\ncharacter realizes something, such as when Caleb realizes the robot controls the system failures,\n\nthe camera zooms in, making the realization more dramatic. There were a few long shots taken\n\nfrom the “security cameras,” making the room and the people in the room look small. Close up\n\nshots were used in dialogue where the director wanted the audience to pay close attention to,\n\nspecifically important intellectual discussion that was valuable in understanding the scientific\n\npoints of the movie.\n\nIn short, the cinematography was very carefully thought out and contributed\n\nto the movie plot quite well."
