        "text": "The chair was plush, tall, and regal. It was the kind of throne you could sink into and never want to get up from, and it was quickly rejected by Alex Garland.\n\n“Too comfortable,” he said, eyeing that chair like an enemy.\n\nWe were in an anodyne Four Seasons conference room searching for a place to sit down and discuss Garland’s provocative new film, Ex Machina, and a soft perch simply didn’t seem fitting. Eventually, we landed on two stiff-backed chairs — the dingy, floral-upholstered kind that hotels stack in bulk — and spent the next half-hour sitting on the edge of them, locked in spirited debate.\n\nOver the next few weeks, I expect many more people will join the conversation. Ex Machina has been a bona fide blockbuster in limited release, taking in over $1 million while playing on no more than 39 screens, and an aggressive nationwide expansion is planned for this Friday. The movie’s stars, Oscar Isaac and Domhnall Gleeson, are not yet household names (though they’ll both be seen in the highly anticipated Star Wars: The Force Awakens), but the sense of mystery around them suits Ex Machina, where Isaac plays Nathan, a wealthy, eccentric inventor who invites office drone Caleb (Gleeson) to examine his latest invention, a robot named Ava (Alicia Vikander). Ava is imbued with a sophisticated brain and a beguiling female form, and as Caleb tests Ava for signs of artificial intelligence, the teasing Nathan also endeavors to push Caleb’s buttons; meanwhile, Ava is sizing up both her creator and visitor, and a mysterious agenda starts to form behind those almost-human eyes.\n\nEx Machina’s characters thrive on challenging each other, and audience members will surely find themselves tested, too: Underneath its smooth surface, the film is packed with the kind of potent, thorny themes designed to keep people arguing on their way out of the theater. “My express intention is to make an ideas movie, and it is deliberately setting up questions — not all of which have answers,” Garland told me, rattling off just a few of those provocative prompts: “Where does gender reside? Is it in the brain? Is it in appearance, a physical thing? If it is in the brain, what is the difference between a male consciousness and a female consciousness? And is it in any way a reasonable thing to say that there might be a difference?”\n\nHe leaned back in his chair. “Now, of course, I’m not stupid: I know that even by posing the question, I’m in a sort of danger zone. But film is a medium that has such a hard pushback against asking difficult questions, and I just don’t want to play that game.”\n\nStill, he may have to. The very premise of Ex Machina sets up a battle of the sexes that has quickly proved to be controversial: As Caleb examines Ava, he begins to fall in love with her, and he’s increasingly horrified by the notion that Nathan is keeping this feminine creature as his prisoner and potential sex slave. Certainly, men don’t come off so well in the movie, which links their desire to create with the more primal male desire to procreate: In other words, it posits that the tech-bros who are driven to design humanlike robots may be thinking less with their brains and more with their … well, you know. It’s Ex Machina’s treatment of women, though, that has already spurred the most think pieces. After catching the film at its South by Southwest premiere, Daily Beast journalist Jen Yamato tweeted, “We’ll just talk about Ex Machina’s woman problem a little bit later”; not long after, Wired’s Angela Watercutter laid into the movie’s sexualized “fembot,” asking, “Why doesn’t Chappie have to put up with this bullshit?”"
