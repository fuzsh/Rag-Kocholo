        "text": "I'll just say it: Ex Machina is one of the best science-fiction movies in years, and the robot Ava is one of the most memorable on-screen realizations in recent memory. The movie, which debuted at South By Southwest and hits American theaters on April 10, is the latest in a recent wave of A.I.-centric sci-fi movies (I'm looking at you: Big Hero 6, Chappie, and Avengers: Age Of Ultron). Ex Machina takes many of the same ideas put forth in Her—are we capable of developing affection for a machine?—and takes them in a darker, slightly more Philip K. Dick-esque direction. It also doubles as a biting critique of modern tech culture—particularly via its portrayal of Oscar Isaac's hard-drinking bro-ed out search mogul—and a post-Snowden surveillance world. Yeah, there's a lot going on here.\n\nBut enough of that. A review this is not. Since this is a movie best seen with minimal knowledge of the plot—I'd suggest skipping any proper reviews, if you can—I thought it'd be fun to instead shake the filmmakers for some behind-the-scenes nuggets or Easter eggs that might give eagle-eyed or curious viewers something special to look for.\n\n1) Domnhall Gleeson previously played his own Ava-like character\n\nDomnhall Gleeson may play a human this time around, but he previously had a chance to show off his robot chops: The actor starred in an episode of the British sci-fi anthology Black Mirror as a man who dies and is sort-of-kind-of resurrected into an artificial body, with an A.I. populated by all the data he left online and on his social channels. Without spoiling too much, this will ring a few bells to viewers of Ex Machina.\n\n2) Where the story's inspiration came from\n\nWriter and director Alex Garland (he previously wrote the Danny Boyle movies 28 Days Later and Sunshine) got the inspiration for Ex Machina from the book Embodiment and the Inner Life: Cognition and Consciousness in the Space of Possible Minds, by cognitive roboticist Murray Shanahan. Shanahan even served as a scientific advisor to the production.\n\n3) You may want to brush up on your Klimt and Wittgenstein\n\nAt one point in the movie, Ava puts on a white dress before walking past a Gustav Klimt painting depicting a woman in a white dress. The painting is actually a portrait of the sister of Ludwig Wittgenstein—a philosopher who is referenced numerous times in the film (pay attention!). Neat Easter egg, but it didn't come from Garland. Rather, set director Michelle Day placed the painting on the wall and Garland only saw it when he first visited the set.\n\n4) There's A Star Wars Connection\n\nEx Machina may mark the first time Domnhall Gleeson and Oscaar Isaac share the screen, but it won't be the last: The two actors both appear in the upcoming Star Wars: The Force Awakens. And in case you're wondering just where you've seen Domnhall's familiar face before, I'll save you a trip to IMDB: He played Bill Weasley in the last two Harry Potter movies."
