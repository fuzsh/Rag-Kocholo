        "text": "Alex Garland forced me to confront my own mortality.\n\nEarly on a dreary Friday morning, the writer-director of Ex Machina and I sit in an overheated hotel room talking about our future robot overlords. It's intense—bikram futurology. By the end, he's asking me questions. Am I interested in artificial intelligence because I want to live forever? I let out a Keanu Reeves, \"whoa.\" and spend the next 48 hours mulling it all over. Not a great feeling, existentially speaking. But there's no denying it: my brain digs the excursion.\n\nThis is Garland's specialty. The son of a psychoanalyst and a political cartoonist, Garland started his career as novelist before penning the scripts for provocative science fiction movies like 28 Days Later, Sunshine, Never Let Me Go, and Dredd (yes, it's way smarter than you think). With Ex Machina, his taut robo-thriller starring Oscar Isaac, Domhnall Gleeson, and Alicia Vikander, the writer upgrades to the role of director, enabling him to drill sci-minded queries and hypotheticals into his audiences' brains with even more force. Mine included; Ex Machina's educated and undiluted rumination on artificial intelligence takes a base question—what is consciousness?—and wanders down every theoretical avenue. Isaac's tech-bro character traces a line from Google Search to sentient A.I., Gleeson's office drone imagines inventors as God replacements, and Vikander, as the graceful robot Ava, challenges the human identity with her mere existence. Ex Machina isn't essayistic, snapping and swerving like a futuristic Harold Pinter play, but it is brainy. Let's just say Garland's library card got serious milage during the ten years he spent researching the film.\n\nThis weekend, Ex Machina finally opens across the country. If you're like us, you'll leave the movie with a contact high, heading straight to the nearest computer for a Wikipedia binge. Well, how about a head start? Here, Esquire mines Garland's influences for reading material, the movies, books, and articles A.I. amateurs can turn to for even deeper takes. And you'll want to read up quickly—your computer already knows all this stuff.\n\nMachine Language for Beginners, Richard Mansfield (1983)\n\nAn early interest in programming spurred Garland's current interest in artificial intelligence. Personal computers were in vogue during his 1980s childhood. \"These science fiction machines were arriving in people's homes,\" he recalls. He wanted in. First, he taught himself the BASIC programming language. Simple stuff. Then Garland dove into Mansfield's bestselling tome, a how-to guide for tinkering with their Apple IIs, Commodore 64s, and Atari 2600s. For the future writer, it didn't compute.\n\n\"It was a book written for children aimed at children and I had no idea what it was talking about. I couldn't get past page one and a half. I think what happened was I realized that I had an interest in it but I had an intellectual failing as well at the same time. And so then I could play out the interest via fiction, rather than the thing itself.\" Machine Language is obsolete in that wouldn't help any budding programmers work with today's machines, but as the seedling for future artificial intelligence discussions, Garland says it was essential. \"On some level I'm a bit like a sort of frustrated race car driver who ends up making a film about race car drivers rather than actually driving NASCAR.\"\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey, Stanley Kubrick (1968)\n\nThis methodical journey through time and space is a classic for a reason. Watching it again through the lens of Ex Machina reveals how prescient Kubrick was when it came to artificial intelligence. \"It's a thought out examination of, not just sort of issues surrounding A.I.s, but the slightly different way an A.I. might be in comparison to our excessive voice,\" Garland says. He wishes he felt the same way about Steven Spielberg's A.I., a project originally conceived by Kubrick. \"I remember feeling that the film didn't address some of the things I thought it was going to address. And it became more about things like capacity to love and rather sort of nebulous, abstract, spiritual or sort of quasi-philosophical type things.\"\n\nThe Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds and The Laws of Physics, Roger Penrose (1989)\n\nGarland began imagining a contemplative, artificial intelligence-centric film about a decade ago, after arguing with a close friend over a machine's capacity to blow past the \"technological singularity.\" What, that's not what you do with your Saturday nights?\n\nThe neuroscientist friend aligned with famed physicist Roger Penrose, whose published writings suggests there's a facet to human consciousness that we don't yet understand. When man eventually uncovers that unique quality of the brain, the discovery will preclude the possibility of a machine being sentient. Garland didn't have a basis to argue. In order to keep up with the argument, the writer poorer over Penrose and other likeminded A.I. researchers. His friend gave him persuasive recommendations. \"He'd put me on to things and I'd start reading and I never came 'round to his way of thinking,\" he says. \"I still haven't.\" Garland adds that there's an increasing number of scientists aligned with this fatalistic outlook because there haven't been any \"seismic, fundamental [A.I. breakthroughs] that would really address the kinds of things that Penrose is saying.\"\n\nPhilosophical Investigations, Ludwig Wittgenstein (1953)\n\nEmbodiment and the Inner Life, Murray Shanahan (2010)\n\nShanahan's book was \"epiphany-like\" for Garland. In the text, Imperial College London's Cognitive Robotics Professor brings the studies of mathematical philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein into the foreground. Wittgenstein believed that to confront mind-body problems, one had to drop philosophy from the conversation. Shanahan believes that's the path to digging deep into human and artificial consciousness. In Embodiment, he writes, \"A fog of metaphysical confusion is liable to obscure a proper view of the mind. We cannot hope to find the desired scientific explanations amid this fog, forever wandering from one -ism to another (dualism, materialism, cognitivism, …).\" So if you want to talk robots, talk about how they work.\n\nFor Garland, reading Shanahan's reexamination of Wittgenstein was like a reverse religious experience. Wondering where, how, and if \"machine\"could blur into \"man,\" and what being the latter even meant, wasn't vital. \"Stuff like qualia and the nature of subjectivity and that kind of thing… [Shanahan] says forget about that. Just progress in a physicalist type way until you hit a brick wall. And he says, effectively, I don't think we're going to hit a brick wall. So let's just keep going until we find that.\"\n\nHow to Create a Mind\n\nThe Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology, Ray Kurzweil (2005)\n\nHow to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed, Ray Kurzweil (2012)\n\nAny philosophy embedded in Ex Machina grows organically out of its human characters. There are Bhagavad Gita references and parallels to the Adam and Eve story. That's Oscar Isaac's megalomaniac, predatory persona patting himself on the back, not a grand metaphor. \"When you have a creation-type story with a religious sort of adjunct to it, it typically becomes a cautionary tale which is man,\" he says. \"'Do not mess with God's work, right? And don't presume to mess with God's work. I wasn't interested in that. I think for me the creation act in this was a parental act and to an extent that it's not a parental act, it's an evolutionary act. Neither of which require God.\"\n\nGarland says he writes from the position of an atheist fascinated by religion and religious people. And through researching the field of A.I., he's discovered a digital spirituality. \"The people who are dropping a lot of money into this, it's for their own mortality,\" he says. \"That's why they're doing it. And in private circles, as it were, they're pretty open about it [uploading consciousness into a computer] is without a doubt one of the incentives for financing this stuff.\" This is one of Google Director of Engineering and leading A.I. researcher Ray Kurzweil's pervading points. Kurzweil believes that by 2050, scientists could create new \"virtual bodies\" with nanobots allowing our consciousnesses to escape death. As the futurist told the New York Times in 2013: \"My plan is to stick around. We'll get to a point about 15 years from now where we're adding more than a year every year to your life expectancy.\"\n\n\"The Deep Mind of Demis Hassabis,\" Steven Levy, Medium.com (2015)\n\nDuring our conversation, Garland name drops Hassabis, a child chess prodigy who started the Google's artificial intelligence company DeepMind. If you want a glimpse into the future—and a better understanding of how Isaac's Silicon Valleyer logically straddles the line between search engine guru and robot inventor—you'll want to keep an eye on Hassabis' career.\n\nAltered States, Ken Russell (1980)\n\nTo package Ex Machina for laymen consumption, Garland turned not to movies but modern television. He wanted to shoot a drama where two humans and a robot could stand around in a room and talk, the type of drama that defined the 1970s. \"Taxi Driver these days is Breaking Bad,\" he says. \"That's where you find it. And so I was consciously influenced by that. I could see what television was doing. I was seeing the kind of object lesson it was providing film. What it was saying was if you are not going to pick up the slack, we will and we're going to sort of show you how to do it. And so I was consciously being influence by that and trying to aspire to that.\"\n\nIf you're going to talk talky '70s dramas you're going to talk Paddy Chayefsky. And if you're going to mention Chayefsky and science fiction in the same breath, you're going to mention Altered States, the legendary writer's final film. In Ken Russell's drama, a university psychologists believes that our dream states are as real as our waking ones. A series of sensory tests unleashes unimaginable terror. Garland rewatched Altered States because before filming Ex Machina. \"It has is some pretty heavy ideas in a story that I found gripping when I first watched it,\" he says."
