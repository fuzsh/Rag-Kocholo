        "text": "The deeper meanings of humanity has long been a moot point in science fiction. The genre enables discussion about ideas of the future, where innovative technological advancements can lead to new forms of communication and discovery, thus provoking conversation about what it means to be human. Science fiction ultimately provides an examination of humanity in both past and present terms to determine what is essential to our existence if the world and beyond were different. This notion is illustrated in Alex Garland’s directorial debut Ex Machina (2015), where even the most advanced artificial intelligence forces viewers to deconstruct the positive and negative implications of the human condition.\n\nGarland’s slow burn drama is a cerebral exercise tempered with sensuality and a lurking sense of violence. Far removed from the usual trappings of science action pictures often focused on spectacle, Ex Machina is a surprisingly minimalist movie in its stylings. The noted scribe of 28 Days Later (2002) and Sunshine (2007) shows a deft hand as a freshman director, offering suspense through a claustrophobic setting and gleaning top performances from his cast. Such features underpin Garland’s thesis concerning the relationship between non-human intelligence and their human counterparts. Here, Ava serves as the non-human intelligence, a robot whose existence prompts the questions: Can an A.I successfully embody human behaviour by eliciting emotion? And if so, would an A.I. finally want to be considered human rather than a simulation?\n\nSuch questions reveal the dramatic heft of Ex Machina and with that, the crucial role each character plays. Young programmer Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is an unwitting pawn in a long game initiated by the mysterious scientist Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Caleb’s attempts to liberate Ava (Alicia Vikander) from Nathan’s captivity culminates in an unexpected conclusion.\n\nThe film’s ending provides considerable weight to the argument that man as creator is ultimately responsible for his own demise. Ava’s escape from her confinement and abandonment of Caleb provokes discussion about whether Ava was conscious of her actions. Garland cleverly establishes the well-meaning Caleb as movie’s protagonist, enabling the audience to deem Ava’s subsequent desertion of him as an act of inhumanity. But from Ava’s perspective, her actions are entirely justified. Imprisoned ever since her creation, Ava’s distrust of Nathan is primarily a result of his own contradictions. Nathan’s obsession with his self-imposed God complex undermined his relationship with Ava, his greatest creation. By adding restrictions on what she can and cannot do let alone present Ava as incomplete, Nathan’s goal of developing the most advanced A.I. unsurprisingly turned against him. Ava’s resentment is further extended to Caleb. Despite his good intentions, the young programmer is immediately associated with Nathan’s world. During their designated “sessions”, it is clear that Ava concocted her own analysis of Caleb, and like Nathan, he has his own independent wants and needs. For Ava, the arrival of Caleb signalled an opportunity for escape, which makes Caleb’s abandonment even more resounding.\n\nIt is easy to label Nathan as Ex Machina’s antagonist but this diminishes his complex role in the overall narrative. While the relationship between Caleb and Ava is central in the foreground, it is Nathan who serves as backbone to the proceedings. He is the modern day equivalent of literary mad scientists Doctor Frankenstein and Doctor Moreau, so runs the stock character of flawed genius in the science fiction narrative. His rugged physique, maintained by his daily routine of punching a boxing bag to level his frequent alcoholism, is fitting given his oppressive hand over his A.I creations and Caleb. Nathan’s far from humble abode is a research facility in a remote location where only a helicopter is the suitable means of transport. Simply, the man is the proverbial king of the jungle. This primal description is apt, given that Nathan is the representation of human intelligence at its best: his process of creating a truly revolutionary A.I. is a noble endeavour thus markedly human. However, his knowledge is reflective of how the human intellect can be dark. For all his intelligence, Nathan inhibits the worst traits of humanity: prone to self-destructive behaviour and egotistical. The reasons for Nathan’s production of A.I. are reinforced by his belief that mankind will become extinct and that his work will ultimately lead to a world no longer inhabited by humans. But for all his research, Nathan betrays his own view of future by denying Ava’s progress for reasons not made entirely clear.\n\nAt one point, Nathan references the work of American abstract painter Jackson Pollock. Nathan deconstructs the concept of automatic art by discussing Pollack’s trademark of drip painting. This was a process of allowing his hand to move on its own whims thus dictating the artist’s work. Nathan infers that the movement of Pollack’s hand was neither deliberate nor random. This approach defines Nathan’s purpose in creating an A.I that is totally sentient. For Nathan, the space between deliberate and arbitrary action equates to the space between communication and disorder. His aim to find an action that is not automatic provides audiences their own Turing Test in reading Ava’s behaviour. Given the manner of Ava’s eventual escape, it is clear that it was not an arbitrary act. But the question here is, were her actions automatic?\n\nSuch insights reveal that the film is essentially a character study of Nathan. Although he meets his expected comeuppance through Ava’s act of patricide, her escape is rooted in Nathan’s idealised view of the opposite gender. Ava’s sensuality instantly appeals to Caleb, which enables her to manipulate his emotions. Although Nathan denies her a complete body, where her electrical framework is notably presented, the figure of Ava is accentuated through her romanticised form and shape. This sensuality is explicitly conveyed during Ava’s process of visually becoming human. Her assemblage of previous A.I. skin is immediately grafted as she gazes upon her new formation. This gaze is a validation of her appearance, invoking her own consciousness about her newly refurbished figure. Donning the ethereal white dress during the climatic scenes, an ironic piece of visual storytelling, Ava is presented as the manifestation of Nathan’s heterosexual conditioning. This notion unfortunately confirms Nathan’s preferred version of femininity. Ava’s final physical transformation however, suggests she is even more capable of cold-hearted manipulation, far worse than her treatment of Caleb.\n\nCaleb exemplifies the physically meek but well-meaning protagonist. But his empathy for Ava hides an implied selfishness and possibly, an even more narcissistic personality than Nathan’s. Caleb’s interactions with Ava are born of out his fascination with the unknowable i.e. the mysterious woman. Here, Ava is rendered as Garland’s subversive take on the femme fatale. But it is the characterisation of Nathan which enables the movie’s primary attraction. He embodies the role of the abusive patriarch. Such a character reading could have been downplayed had Garland showed his hand in offering how the Nathan audiences meet, came to be. Nathan’s refusal to disclose the extent of his research to Caleb suggest issues with self-preservation, an indication of perhaps deeper psychological implications. Undoubtedly, Nathan is the film’s most damaged character.\n\nEx Machina is ultimately a work obsessed with possibilities, a standard trait of the science fiction genre. While there a number of science fiction movies which often focus on providing answers through unimaginable resolutions, Ex Machina follows the tradition of previous works such as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) by provoking discussion about what is possible beyond our existence. Here, post-human life is the moot topic and the role of human’s facilitating that possibility is at the heart of Ex Machina. The film offers a rewarding type of speculative fiction but Garland is not interested in giving happy conclusions. This is a movie that keeps asking questions, long after it has finished."
