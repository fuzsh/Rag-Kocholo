        "text": "Screenwriter and novelist Alex Garland upgrades to full auteur status, directing his own original script. It’s a futurist thriller with classic generic antecedents, all about artificial intelligence becoming creepily indistinguishable from the human kind. Ex Machina feels like an elegant SF short story with a droll twist that has been pumped up and sexed up into an over-bulky feature film. But it’s managed with confidence.\n\nDomhnall Gleeson is Caleb, the geeky coder working for a software giant called Bluebook (like Google, but bigger and more important); imagine Caleb’s excitement and fear when he wins an in-house competition to spend a week alone with the firm’s reclusive, scarily Kurtzian founder, Nathan (bullishly played by Oscar Isaac), in his gigantic fortress of solitude on a private island – it looks like the one where they built Jurassic Park. The mindgames begin when Nathan tells Caleb his job is to interview the state-of-the-art female AI robot he has invented and see if he can detect any artificiality in her intelligence."
