        "text": "Geoff Barrow & Ben Salisbury’s Ivor Novello winning score to Alex Garland’s ‘Ex Machina’.\n\n\"It's this sort of a mix of organic and electronic sounds, which is very appropriate in terms of the subject matter of the film,\" Salisbury tells Rolling Stone. In the film, a programmer played by Domhnall Gleeson enters a complex relationship with a robot named Ava, played by Alicia Vikander. \"We did realize that it would need organic instruments as well as electronic instruments to bring that sort of human element.”"
