        "text": "With thanks to Scottie Savalick on our Facebook group, he has pointed out that the Eelgrass label have copied the EV release, ‘Deus Ex Machine’ as expected.\n\nThis release is the ‘budget’ version of the deluxe Japanese release and so will make for the more democratic version of this set. I see no reason why Eelgrass wouldn’t attempt to remaster this release to suit their own ears and still retain the provenance for those that sank their money into the original set, however, it bears remembering, without EV going pocket deep, we wouldn’t have this show in this quality at all."
