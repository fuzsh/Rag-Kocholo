        "text": "Deus Ex Machina Today & Into The Future\n\nThe concept of Deus holds true to this day. It is a vision of taking the path less travelled - be it Deus Ex Machina jackets, hoodies, tees or iconic Deus caps; motorbikes or surfboards; leathers or wetsuits; food, cafe culture or art.\n\n‍\n\nAs a global brand focusing on local trends, Deus Ex Machina is a unique combination of polished and down to earth. With each different flagship offering its own blend of local culture and international design and philosophy, the core company values of inclusiveness, authenticity and enthusiasm help to make Deus the brand it is today. With annual revenue of $13 million in 2021 alone, this is a brand to watch if you love the retro side of surf and motorbike culture.\n\n‍\n\nWho is Deus Ex Machina designed for? Once exclusively a lifestyle brand, Deus now has a global reach as a culturally focused apparel label. Many of their designs are relatively understated but with just the right amount of flair, making it easy to mix and match their clothing for every day, while the price point reflects the genuine quality of their products.\n\n‍\n\nWhether you're passionate about surfing or excited about motorcycling culture, Deus Ex Machina captures the golden age of nostalgia with designs that are relevant anywhere in the world. From Deus Ex Machina’s t-shirts, in its trademark laid back style, to comfortable Deus trousers which are well suited for skating and casual wear, the brand has a casual meets grungy approach with a few statement pieces to stand out as and when needed.\n\n‍\n\nWhere once gangs of hard core enthusiasts paid their respects to vintage bikes in the original showroom in which Jennings and Tuckwell plotted their next move, they have been joined by kids who had barely yet to pick up a spanner, a surfboard or a can of gasoline.\n\n‍\n\nWhere surfers once patrolled the big brand items in major beach stores, Deus has instilled a new vogue of riding waves for fun in laid back apparel, rather than ripped clean lines displaying clean-cut muscle.\n\n‍\n\nWhere Deus Ex Machina goes next will only reflect their handle. The “God from the machine” literary and theatre device resolves stories that even defy the suspension of belief. Rarely has there been a more apt appellative, maxim or doctrine for how a brand continues to upend the norm.\n\nShop Deus ex machina"
