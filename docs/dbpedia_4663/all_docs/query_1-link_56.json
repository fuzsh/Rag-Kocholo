        "text": "I’ve seen Ex Machina four times now, and every time it felt like a completely different movie. Alex Garland has created a new favorite of mine in the sci-fi genre...\n\nFull Review | Aug 2, 2024\n\nAlex Garland’s cerebral sci-fi feels a lot like an Asimov novel—ironic, considering the movie actively defies Asimov’s own rules of robotics.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4.5/5 | Jul 9, 2024\n\n...the brilliance of the film is the way we become Garland’s Turing Test subjects.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4.5/5 | Apr 5, 2024\n\n“Ex Machina” works as a study of what it means to be conscious/human...I’m convinced more than ever that we are in the midst of a British New Wave in science fiction cinema.\n\nFull Review | Jan 3, 2024\n\nA commanding first directorial effort from Alex Garland, Ex Machina is the product of a perfectly-tuned collaborative endeavor, much like the mind of its artificial centerpiece.\n\nFull Review | Aug 3, 2023\n\nAll the doubts we've harbored through the film hit us like a hammer at the end, leaving us chilled. [Full review in Spanish]\n\nFull Review | Apr 5, 2023\n\nEx Machina\" has much more good than bad and much more surprise than contrivance when it comes to traversing the mine field that can be the science fiction topic of artificial intelligence, especially with a potentially damning title like that.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Aug 14, 2022\n\nBy considering such ideas in an enclosed environment with so few characters, Garland has made Ex Machina an intense, engaging film that plays with the viewer's head and, as the best films often do, demands an exceptional degree of time to process.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/4 | Jun 21, 2022\n\nA fascinating sci-fi study of A.I. with incredible performances all around.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4.5/5 | Nov 20, 2021\n\nEx Machina is a smart, literate and occasionally quite brilliant film, which will upend a few of your expectations for where this story will end and how it will get there.\n\nFull Review | Oct 29, 2021\n\nIt's uncomfortable to consider that Ava might in fact be the heroine of this movie, but it's hard for me to find sympathy for men who only see her as an object to be abused or pitied.\n\nFull Review | Mar 19, 2021\n\nA high tech thriller that by and large ignores the tech to get down to the nitty gritty.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Feb 3, 2021"
