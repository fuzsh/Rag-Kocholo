French filmmaker Maurice Cloche was better known in 1950 as the founder of the Institute of Advanced Film Studies than the fact that he was as a director of stature. Most of Cloche's own films were merely potboilers, with such notable exceptions as La Cage Aux Filles. Daniele Delorme, who'd been discovered the previous year as the star of Gigi, plays Micheline, an unhappy young woman entrapped by circumstances. After a desultory romance with a married man, Micheline is slapped into a girl's reformatory by her brutish stepfather. Her she is given a crash course on petty crime, which serves only to get her thrown back into the institution shortly after her release. Only through the guidance of an understanding matron is Micheline able to get her life in order. La Cage Aux Filles would seem to owe some of its inspiration to G. W. Pabst's Diary of a Lost Girl (1929).
