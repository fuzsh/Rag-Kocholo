        "text": "Pierre Fresnay (4 April 1897 – 9 January 1975) was a French stage and film actor.\n\nBiography[]\n\nBorn Pierre Jules Louis Laudenbach, he was encouraged by his uncle, actor Claude Garry, to pursue a career in theater and film. During the 1920s, Fresnay appeared in many popular stage productions, most notably in the title role of Marcel Pagnol’s Marius (1929), which ran for over 500 performances. His first great screen role was as Marius in the 1931 film adaptation of the play of the same name. He replayed the role in the next two parts of Marcel Pagnol's Marseilles Trilogy, Fanny (1932) and César (1936).[1]\n\nHe appeared in more than 60 films, eight of which were with Yvonne Printemps, with whom he lived since 1934. In that same year, he appeared in Alfred Hitchcock's first version of The Man Who Knew Too Much. In 1937, he portrayed the aristocratic French military officer Captain de Boeldieu in Jean Renoir's masterpiece La Grande Illusion.[1]\n\nIn 1947, he played Vincent de Paul in Monsieur Vincent, for which he won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival. He also portrayed Nobel Peace Prize laureate Albert Schweitzer in Il est minuit, Docteur Schweitzer (1952).[citation needed]\n\nSoldier[]\n\nA soldier in the French Army during World War I, he returned to his career a hero. However, under the German occupation of World War II, he worked for the Franco-German film company Continental, making Henri-Georges Clouzot's Le Corbeau and other films.[1]\n\nAfter the war, he was detained in prison while allegations of collaboration were investigated. After being held for six weeks, he was released as a result of a lack of evidence. Despite Fresnay's declarations that he worked in films to help save the French film industry in a period of crisis, the move damaged his popularity with the public.[citation needed]\n\nLater years[]\n\nIn 1954, he published his memoirs, Je suis comédien (Eng. I am an actor). Fresnay continued to perform regularly in film and on stage through to the 1960s. In the 1970s, he appeared in a few films for television. From then on, he lived with the French actress and singer Yvonne Printemps for the rest of his life, co-directing the Théâtre de la Michodière in Paris with her until his death in 1975.[1]\n\nDeath[]\n\nHe died of respiratory problems, aged 77, on 9 January 1975, at Neuilly-sur-Seine and he is interred alongside Printemps in the local cemetery. In his autobiography (My Name Escapes Me), Alec Guinness states that Fresnay was his favourite actor.[2]\n\nOther[]\n\nAsked how to say his name, he told The Literary Digest \"I think my name is to be pronounced fray-nay. At least, it is the way I pronounce it.\" (Charles Earle Funk, What's the Name, Please?, Funk & Wagnalls, 1936).\n\nSelected filmography[]\n\nYear Title Role Director 1931 Marius Marius Olivier, César's son Alexander Korda 1932 Fanny Marius Olivier, César's son Marc Allégret 1934 The Man Who Knew Too Much Louis Bernard Alfred Hitchcock 1935 Kœnigsmark Raoul Vignerte, French teacher Maurice Tourneur 1936 César Marius Olivier, César's son Marcel Pagnol 1937 Street of Shadows Captain Georges Carrère Georg Wilhelm Pabst La Grande Illusion Captain Boeldieu Jean Renoir 1938 Adrienne Lecouvreur Maurice de Saxe Marcel L'Herbier 1939 Le Duel Father Daniel Maurey Pierre Fresnay himself 1939 La Charrette fantôme David Holm Julien Duvivier 1942 The Murderer Lives at Number 21 \"Monsieur Wens Henri-Georges Clouzot 1943 Le Corbeau Doctor Rémy Germain Henri-Georges Clouzot 1943 La Main du diable Roland Brissot Maurice Tourneur 1944 Traveling Light Gaston Jean Anouilh 1947 Monsieur Vincent Vincent de Paul Maurice Cloche 1949 The Paris Waltz Jacques Offenbach Marcel Achard Vient de paraître Moscat Jacques Houssin Au grand balcon Gilbert Carbot Henri Decoin 1950 Justice Is Done narrator André Cayatte Dieu a besoin des hommes Thomas Gourvennec Jean Delannoy 1951 Le Voyage en Amérique Gaston Fournier Henri Lavorel 1953 Napoleon Road Édouard Martel Jean Delannoy 1954 The Unfrocked One Maurice Morand Léo Joannon 1955 If All the Guys in the World narrator Christian Jaque 1956 The Hunchback of Notre Dame narrator Jean Delannoy 1957 Les Fanatiques Luis Vargas Alex Joffé\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
