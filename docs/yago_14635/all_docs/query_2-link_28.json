        "text": "Aymon Xavier de Montépin (1827-1902) was a prolific novelist, author of endless and colorful stories, initially published in installments in high circulation newspapers, then represented on stages throughout Europe. They became true battle horses for many amateur drama societies. Cinema, of course, couldn’t ignore such a subject, and it must be said that it was Italy, during the silent film period, that brought many of these works to the screen. The works were for the most part followed by a popular audience that was sensitive to the vicissitudes of the protagonists but indifferent both to plot consistency, which was at times truly muddled, as well as to stylistic qualities of the films. Of films such as Portatrice di pane (E. Vidali, 1916), S.E. l’Amore (A. Borgato, 1918), Il medico delle pazze (M. Roncoroni, 1919), Il ventriloquo (G. Brignone, 1920), Tre milioni di dote (C. De Riso, 1920), Canaglia dorata (A. Consalvi, 1921), which were all made by small production houses, one that stands out is Fiacre n. 13. As one of the most important feuilletons written by Montépin, the Turin film company Ambrosio employed ample means to make it, as well as its biggest stars: Capozzi, Makowska, Gigetta Morano, Fernanda Negri-Pouget, Vasco Creti and Diana Karenne in a cameo role. Unfortunately the film, which was divided into four episodes, got caught in the cogs of censorship and did not receive the go ahead for its first episode. As a result, when it appeared onscreen in quite a mutilated state it was met with very modest feedback from critics, though the public, emotionally enthralled by the quests for virtue and the final comeuppance for the bad guys, greeted the film warmly.\n\nVittorio Martinelli"
