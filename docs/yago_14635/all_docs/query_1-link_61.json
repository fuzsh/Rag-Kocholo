        "text": "Lee Broughton's DVD Reviews\n\nAnthony Ghidra Double Feature. Wild East, USA. Format NTSC Region 0.\n\nAnthony Ghidra only made a handful of Spaghetti Westerns but he's now fairly well known amongst genre fans thanks to Wild East's earlier DVD releases of Pistoleros and Django the Last Killer. Both films were low budget but entertaining genre entries in which Ghidra managed to make something of an impression. It's great to report that Ghidra makes an even bigger impression in the two surprisingly good films featured on this new double bill disc, Tequila Joe and A Hole Between the Eyes. Indeed, the overall quality of the two films presented here make this one of Wild East's most significant releases yet.\n\nTequila Joe Directed by Vincent Eagle. 1968. Widescreen (1.85: 1 anamorphic). 91 minutes.\n\nA sharp-shooting young stranger, Burt (Jean Sobieski), arrives in a troubled town and tells the drunken sheriff, Tequila Joe (Anthony Ghidra), that he's his new deputy. Joe is a broken man who has lost his nerve and his inclination to uphold the law: he's quite happy to simply get drunk and live a quiet life while the vicious gangs that are controlled by two rival bad guys, Trianas (Furio Meniconi) and Mulligan (Dick Palmer), cause murderous mayhem around town. Burt sets about forcing Joe to clean up his act and when Joe witnesses the bloody aftermath of one of Trianas and Mulligan's violent shootouts he starts making an effort to pull himself together. However, Trianas and Mulligan both refuse to curb their unlawful activities and pressure from Burt ensures that local tensions escalate to a point where Joe is finally forced to take action.\n\nThis is a middle to lower tier genre entry but it's a great little film that largely manages to transcend the limitations of its budget. It features a fairly standard mix of generic elements (the town held under siege by rival gangs, the stranger guided by mysterious motivations, the broken lawman, etc) but it mixes them up in a pleasing and thoroughly entertaining way. This is an action-packed show and, towards its end, the film features some pretty wild and unexpected narrative twists that lead into an exciting finale. There are some quite stylishly staged scenes present here and director Vincent Eagle's (AKA Enzo Dell'Aquila) consistently sure-handed approach works just fine. The show features a number of familiar faces and the quality of the acting on display is pretty good for the most part. Anthony Ghidra provides one of the best performances seen in a Spaghetti Western, period. He is completely convincing as the self-pitying and hopelessly drunk lawman and his quite brilliant performance brings a lot of depth to the character of Joe. When the details of the tragedy that prompted Joe to hit the bottle are revealed, Eagle forgoes a flashback and simply lets Joe relate his dramatic backstory to Burt verbally. It's a testament to the quality of Ghidra's acting in this show that this scene works so well. Francesco De Masi's soundtrack score isn't his best work but it gets the job done well enough. Picture quality here is just about excellent: there's next to nothing in the way of scratches or print damage. The presentation's sound quality is pretty good too.\n\nExtras: image gallery, English trailer and Italian trailer.\n\nA Hole Between the Eyes Directed by Joseph Warren. 1968. Widescreen (2.35: 1 anamorphic). 85 minutes.\n\nBounty killer Bill Blood (Anthony Ghidra) is tracking down three Mexican bandits who each hold a very special playing card. When the three playing cards are brought together, the cryptic writing scrawled on each one of them will reveal the whereabouts of the $100,000 in gold that the three Mexicans stole from General de Santa Anna's army. Having secured one of the cards, Blood next sets about getting the card that belongs to a fearsome and ruthless bandit leader, General Munguya (Robert Hundar). However, things get complicated when the holder of the third card, Garrincha (Luigi Marturano), teams up with an unscrupulous businessman, Tedder (Giorgio Gargiullo), and the pair devise a plan that has the potential to cause both Blood and Munguya a whole lot of trouble.\n\nThe big news here is that this hitherto little-seen film actually looks and plays like an expensive A grade Spaghetti Western for much of its runtime. It's a little unusual in as much as it is set in unfamiliar locations and features few familiar faces. The lack of big name acting talent suggests that the film perhaps had a medium-sized budget at best. However, the show's production values are really top notch and it remains a great-looking film that compares well visually to the genre's best entries. Stylish cinematography and impressive set designs and costumes that feature lots of finely observed details help this show to punch well above its own weight. The quality of the film's acting is very good and the show features an abundance of interesting characters who deliver some fantastic dialogue. Roberto Pregadio's beautiful soundtrack score -- which sounds a bit like Procol Harum playing excerpts from Ennio Morricone's score for The Grand Silence in places -- is also quite unusual but excellent. The show's writer Adriano Bolzoni helped to script some great Spaghetti Westerns and he continues his good work here by adding an original and refreshing spin to the genre's now familiar \"hunt for a hidden treasure\" narrative variant. The film is quite short at 85 minutes but it is perfectly paced. There are so many moments of intrigue and so many well executed set pieces present here that the film has the feel of a longer, more epic-like production. If you're a Spaghetti Western fan and you haven't seen this show yet, you're in for a real treat as the film surely rates as one of the best genre entries of the late 1960s. For an obscure film the picture quality here is pretty good for the most part. There are odd outbreaks of scratches and the like present from time to time but these don't pose a major problem. The presentation's sound quality is a little flat in places but, again, this isn't a major problem.\n\nExtras: image gallery and German trailer.\n\n© 2011 Copyright Lee Broughton.\n\nRIP Michael Sarrazin\n\nCanadian actor Michael Sarrazin, best known for starring opposite Jane Fonda in 1969's \"They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?\" died in Montreal after a brief battle with cancer on Sunday April 17, 2011 in Montreal, Canada. He was 70. Among Sarrazin's other memorable roles were Irvin Kershner's 1967 con-artist movie \"The Flim-Flam Man\", in which he played the reluctant apprentice to grifter George C. Scott, and the Paul Newman-directed 1970 film \"Sometimes a Great Notion\", playing Newman's misunderstood half-brother. \"Michael was one of the most talented, generous and committed actors I have ever worked with,\" George Mihalka, who directed Sarrazin in 1993's La Florida, told the Montreal Gazette. \"He never stopped surprising me with his wit, charm and, above all, his humility and simple decency.\" Added his brother, Pierre Sarrazin, who produced \"La Florida:\". He wasn’t a particularly good student. But he was a great actor. His first high school role was in \"The Bishop’s Candlestick\", and he was very upset when he came offstage and everyone in the crowd was laughing. He thought they were laughing at him. They were laughing with him.\"\n\nSarrazin was born Jacques Michel André Sarrazin in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada on May 22, 1940 and later moved with his family to Montreal. In 1965, Sarrazin signed with Universal, becoming one of the last actors to come up through the old studio system. After a series of small roles in TV, his film career took off with the 1967 Western \"Gunfight in Abilene\", starring Bobby Darin and Leslie Nielsen. He went on to land a slew of roles, including playing a Confederate soldier 1968's \"Journey to Shiloh\", opposite Harrison Ford, and earned a Golden Globe nom for his role as a slacker surfer in 1968's \"The Sweet Ride\". That movie also starred Jacqueline Bisset, with whom Sarrazin began a 14-year relationship. Other credits included 1972's \"The Life and Times of George Roy Bean\" and 1976's Gumball Rally. In recent years, he primarily took on guest-starring roles in TV series. His last onscreen role was in Hallmark Channel's 2008 telefilm \"The Christmas Choir\". Sarazzin appeared in a guest appearance role in one Euro-western TV mini-series \"The Adventures of Smoke Bellew\" (1995).\n\nHe moved to Montreal from the West Coast a decade ago to be closer to his daughters, Catherine and Michelle.\n\nDan Van Husen recalls his films in Almeria on a private visit\n\nAt 66 years of age, actor Dan Van Husen has returned to Almeria, where he was a regular feature in half a dozen films, mostly westerns. He does not remember what his first film was but he worked with Klaus Kinsky. In 1968, he came under the direction of Duccio Tesari, then came \"El Condor\" with Lee Van Cleef, films with Enzo Castellari, Sergio Corbucci, along with Faye Dunaway, Franco Nero and Yul Bryner, among others. \"We ate pancakes in Yul's trailer and then when I went to Munich for the premiere of \"Catlow\" he helped introduce me to the press. He gave me his address and phone number\", remembering the bald actor.\n\nFrom his first contact with this land he's retained its image. \"I was impressed by the desert. Three weeks ago I was in Arizona and I sincerely believe that this is much better.\" Part of the Almeria landscape has been revived today by Jesus Contreras, Almeria nature specialist of the company Oz Nature.\n\nMemories\n\nvan Husen on Almeria states that, \"The people were very decent and the faces of the Gypsies were delightful. The horsemen and Spanish stunt experts were the best. Rafael Albaicín, Luis Barboo, José Canalejas ... there were many. \" He remember that the Gypsy stutnmen charged for each fall and every pirouette, so \"The first time was not very good, then the second was better and the third better yet.\"\n\n\"I did not speak Spanish and we were so busy. We were just so tired because we were working all day since early morning. We spent the evenings at the Grand Hotel bar without changing our film clothes. We showered and at ten we went to bed\", he recalls.\n\nvan Husen witnessed the density of film shooting in our land. \"The day that we ended \"Catlow \" we started on \"The Ron Boulevard. \" They were trying to kill Lino Ventura and clearly in the end it is why he died. With his hard face worthy of Sam Pekimpah, Dan was almost always a villain and, therefore, was seldom alive at the end of a film. This happened in \"Catlow\", whose last scene was shot without him in today's House of Cinema. Dan's visit with his friend Alex remembering old friends. \"It's a good start but Almería needs a major film festival like Berlin. Everyone knows Almería and its movie history. I was recently at the First Los Angeles Spaghetti Western Festival in the United States where three films were screened which were shot in Almeria. The history of cinema in Almeria has to be more present in the world\". Dan has tried in vain to donate to Almeria, documents of his career but found no official response."
