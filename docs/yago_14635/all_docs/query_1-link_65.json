        "text": "By Criteria: The Catholic Film Podcast ( bio - articles - email ) | Jun 27, 2023 | In Criteria: The Catholic Film Podcast\n\nListen to this podcast on: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | RSS feed | YouTube Channel\n\nThis is a listener-supported podcast! Thanks for your help!\n\nSince starting Criteria: The Catholic Film Podcast in May 2020, we’ve been hosting in-depth discussions of movies from the Vatican’s 1995 list of important films. Now, after three years, we’ve finished discussing all 45 films—and in this episode, together with Catholic filmmaker Nathan Douglas, we’re taking a look back at the list as a whole.\n\nAfter discussing how and why the Vatican film list (actually titled “Some Important Films”) was made, and putting it in the context of several decades of concern from the highest levels of the Vatican about the social and moral influence of cinema, we talk about our favorite and least favorite films on the Vatican’s list, as well as the movies we think should be added in a hypothetical future update of the list.\n\nUltimately, watching through the entire Vatican film list is not only an education in the classics of world cinema, but also gives important perspective on the strengths and weaknesses of past cinematic engagement with religion, allowing us to see both the potential fruit that could be borne and the dead ends that should be avoided in the Catholic cinema of the future.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n\n11:31 History behind the Vatican film list\n\n43:34 What films should be removed from the list?\n\n1:24:10 Our favorite films on the list\n\n1:55:30 What films should have been included that weren’t?\n\n2:34:09 What post-1995 films would we add?\n\n3:00:19 The most Catholic/edifying films on the list\n\nLinks\n\nPope St. John Paul II’s address on the 100th birthday of cinema https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/speeches/1995/march/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19950317_plen-pccs.html\n\n“100 Years of Cinema” document from the Pontifical Council of Social Communications with model curriculum\n\nhttps://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/pccs/documents/rc_pc_pccs_doc_19960101_100-cinema_en.html\n\nBelow is the 1995 list by the Pontifical Council for Social Communications, “Some Important Films” (with links to our episode on each film):\n\nReligion\n\nAndrei Rublev, Andrei Tarkovsky (1969, USSR)\n\nThe Mission, Roland Joffé (1986, UK)\n\nThe Passion of Joan of Arc, Carl T.
