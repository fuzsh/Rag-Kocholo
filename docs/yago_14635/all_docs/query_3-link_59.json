        "text": "Born to Add to the World\n\nFounder and CEO of Armelle Productions, creator of Super Immigrant: a fashion BRAND with purpose, Armelle Studio: a new way to take portrait and tell your story, Friends Hosting Friends: an exclusive home exchange community, and My Wize Book to keep your world super organized.\n\n​\n\nThe core of my work is simple: how can I be part of building a better world and life for all of us? How can I impact the world positively?\n\nTied to the Silver Screen\n\nMy grandfather, Maurice Cloche, was the first director to receive the Academy Award for best foreign language film in 1947. He inspired me to become a storyteller, but it is throughout my own unique approach to life, visions and style, that I built my brand. Whether I’m writing fantasy, science fiction, or romance; attempting to improve reality; or creating something purely new, my stories are a blend of pure entertainment with a spiritual twist.\n\nFrench / American\n\nAfter 25 long years, I became American and I rejoice every day ever since. I hold two powerful passports and I believe it comes with responsibilities. I find myself in that dual citizenship. I love my two countries dearly. I could not dissociate myself from one or the other.\n\nUpbringing in Paradise\n\nBorn on the French island of La Reunion, near Madagascar, and raised in Africa, New Caledonia and the South of France, I started to embody, at the age of eight, all the businesses I would create several years later, and all the stories I was meant to tell.\n\nHardship\n\nI came to the U.S. with nothing more than a suitcase in hand, a strong French accent and diplomas I couldn’t use. But I felt home in the U.S., and I was determined to find my way."
