        "text": "Life and career\n\nHaneke is the son of German actor and director Fritz Haneke and Austrian actress Beatrix von Degenschild. His stepfather, the composer Alexander Steinbrecher, had later married the mother of actor Christoph Waltz.[3] Haneke was raised in the city of Wiener Neustadt, Austria.\n\nHaneke showed a strong interest in literature and music, but as an adolescent developed a \"downright contempt for any form of school\".[4] During this period of his life, he has later described himself as a \"rebel\". He had ambitions of becoming an actor in his youth, later abandoning these plans after failing an entrance examination at the Max Reinhardt Seminar in Vienna.[5] He later attended the University of Vienna to study philosophy, psychology and drama. Not a committed student, he would spend most of his time attending local movie theatres.[6] After leaving university, he began working odd jobs, before working as an editor and dramaturge at the southwestern German television station SÃ¼dwestfunk from 1967 to 1970, a time during which he also worked as a film critic. He made his debut as a television director in 1974.\n\nHaneke's feature film debut was 1989's The Seventh Continent, which served to trace out the violent and bold style that would bloom in later years. Three years later, the controversial Benny's Video put Haneke's name on the map. Haneke achieved great success in 2001 with the critically successful French film The Piano Teacher. It won the prestigious Grand Prize at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival and also won its stars, BenoÃ®t Magimel and Isabelle Huppert, the Best Actor and Actress awards. He has worked with Juliette Binoche (Code Unknown in 2000 and CachÃ© in 2005), after she expressed interest in working with him.[7] Haneke frequently worked with real-life couple Ulrich MÃ¼he and Susanne Lothar â thrice each.\n\nHis film, The White Ribbon, premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival and won the Palme d'Or. The film is set in 1913 and deals with strange incidents in a small town in Northern Germany, depicting an authoritarian, fascist-like atmosphere, where children are subjected to rigid rules and suffer harsh punishments, and where strange deaths occur. In 2012, his film Amour also won the Palme d'Or.\n\nHaneke says that films should offer viewers more space for imagination and self-reflection. Films that have too much detail and moral clarity, Haneke says, are used for mindless consumption by their viewers.[8]\n\nHis 2012 film Amour won the Best Foreign Language Oscar and was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards.[9] In 2013, he was the subject of the documentary film Michael H â Profession: Director.[10][11] That year, Haneke won the Prince of Asturias Award for the arts.\n\nIn 2017, his twelfth film, Happy End, was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 70th Cannes Film Festival.\n\nStage work\n\nHaneke has directed a number of stage productions in German, which include works by Strindberg, Goethe, and Heinrich von Kleist in Berlin, Munich and Vienna. In 2006 he gave his debut as an opera director, staging Mozart's Don Giovanni for the OpÃ©ra National de Paris at Palais Garnier when the theater's general manager was Gerard Mortier. In 2012, he was to direct CosÃ¬ fan tutte for the New York City Opera.[12] This production had originally been commissioned by JÃ¼rgen Flimm for the Salzburg Festival 2009, but Haneke had to resign due to an illness preventing him from preparing the work. Haneke realized this production at Madrid's Teatro Real in 2013.[13]"
