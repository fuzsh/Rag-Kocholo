        "text": "Maurice Cloche, a director best known for his Oscar-winning film ''Monsieur Vincent,'' died on Tuesday at his home in Bordeaux after a long illness. He was 82 years old and had Parkinson's disease.\n\n''Monsieur Vincent,'' a dramatization of the life of St. Vincent de Paul that starred Pierre Fresnay, won the Academy Award in 1947 for best foreign film. It also was honored as the best film in France that year.\n\nMr. Cloche, whose career spanned more than a half-century, also made spy thrillers and films with religious and social themes.\n\nHis best-known films include ''La Cage aux Oiseaux'' (''The Bird Cage''); ''Le Docteur Laennec,'' the story of the inventor of the stethoscope; ''Ne de Pere Inconnu'' (''Father Unknown'') and ''La Cage aux Filles (''The Girl Cage'')."
