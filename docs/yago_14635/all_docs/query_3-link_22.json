The film's sets were designed by the art director Jacques Paris.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nMarc-Antoine, a garbage truck driver in Arles, lives a quiet life with his wife, Mélanie, and their two children. When the local petanque club's mascot is stolen, Marc-Antoine suggests painting a new one. His artwork makes him a local sensation, leading him to leave his family for a painting venture with a young waitress named Hélène.
