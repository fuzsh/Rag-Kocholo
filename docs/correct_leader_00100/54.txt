(CS) Luxembourg's former Prime Minister and former EU Commission President Jacques Santer turns 75 on Friday.

Born in Wasserbillig in 1937, Santer studied law in Paris, taking political office in 1972 as state secretary. Between 1979 and 1984 he took over as Finance Minister, Employment Minister and Social Minister.

Becoming Luxembourg's 22nd Prime Minister in 1984, Santer handed over his duty as Finance Minister to Jean-Claude Juncker, who would succeed him as Prime Minister in 1995. Santer was also Culture Minister.

In 1995 Santer became EU Commission President. Following a corruption scandal involving several EU officials, the entire Commission under Santer resigned four years later. Between 1999 and 2004 Santer represented Luxembourg at the EU Parliament.

Earlier in 2012, Santer was appointed to the board of the Special Purpose Investment Vehicle (SPIV), designed to boost the firepower of the ESFS rescue fund.
