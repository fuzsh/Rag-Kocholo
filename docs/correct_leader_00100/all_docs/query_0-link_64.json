        "text": "Norbert Niederkofler: taking you behind the scenes I have an interview with Norbert Niederkofler on Thursday. Let me explain how I proceed: Step1: I read the press release Step2: I dig online and watch everything I can find: interviews, videos... Each piece of information is collected religiously on a piece of paper. Step3: I formulate between 6 and 10 sharp questions. The name of the game is to never ask a question that has already been answered. The process takes between 4 and 8 days. Why? It is a matter of mutual respect. Star Chefs like Mr Niederkofler give hundreds of interviews each year. By demonstrating a very high level of preparation, you show that you respect his work and receive answers that will benefit the whole community. I use another important key: I always start my interviews by asking how long the Chef has for the interview and I finish the interview exactly on time. Same idea. Show respect. There are only 145 three-Michelin-star restaurants in the world. They are in contact with each other and share extremely sharp cultures. So if you want Chefs to take time off their busy schedule to talk to you, you'd better make sure that all the Chefs you met in the past were happy with your work. Below is the best video I found about what is going on at \"Atelier Moessmer Norbert Niederkofler ***\". Soooooo looking forward to it! Enjoy this video!\n\nLuxembourg's FANTASTIC 4. These 4 won big!: - L√©a Linster won a \"Bocuse d'Or\", the Olympic title for Chefs. - Andy Schleck won the Tour de France - Gast Waltzing won a Grammy Award - Laurent Witz won an Oscar for the short movie \"Mr Hublot\" A few comments: - I know these 4 personally. As a trained Golf professional, I admire their \"no-nonse\" culture, their incredible capacity to endure hard-work during a long period of time, their wisdom and their generosity. - When I ran the New York marathon, I had a red lion on the front of my shirt with \"Luxembourg\" in big letters. During 3h30, I kept hearing \"Go Andy Schleck\". - When I interviewed Ferran Adri√† and a few months later Paul Bocuse, they asked me about Lea Linster which they both deeply admire. And in Germany, she is a superstar. - I had the pleasure to attend a philharmonic concert where Gast Waltzing was conducting the music he composed. Insanely great! On the other hand, ask any Luxembourger what he thinks about these 4 and you will get a weird, often suspicious answer. I am tired of this nonsense. ü§ó This is 2024: we need to celebrate these heroes and benefit from their massive media reach. Dear Mr Gilles Feith, could we get their pictures on a huge wall in Luxembourg's airport? Dear Mrs Beryl Koltz, could we start using them for our nation branding efforts? (Check this 3.4m views/54k likes video: https://lnkd.in/eAK7d88u) Dear Mr Luc Frieden, could we celebrate these global champions properly? Involve them in our Ministries, invite them when we have international guests. I get it, other people have huge merits: Ren√© Mathieu (Best Vegetal restaurant), Francois Valentiny (Cruz Europea de Oro), Su Mei Tse (Lion d'Or), Beryl Koltz herself (Melies d'Or), etc. I just picked the 4 awards that everyone can relate to :-) These are our heavyweight champions. üí™üèª Let's make it happen.\n\nHow to Turn Entrepreneurs into Heroes in Luxembourg? Let me ask you: \"Which entrepreneur(s) do you admire in Luxembourg?\" (Please indicate their name(s) in the comments) Then ask yourself: \"Why do I struggle to name any of them?\" Because they exist: From Xavier Buck (EuroDNS) to Marchiol Cyril (Tsume Art), Claude Wagner, Artyom Yukhin, Gosia Kramer, Genna Elvin, Bob Kneip, Thibaut Britz, Robert Glaesener, Nicolas Buck, St√©phanie JAUQUET, Julien De Mayer, David Goldrake, Davide Martucci, Bert Boerman, Georges Bock, Matthieu Bracchetti, etc The list goes on and on and on! So what is the problem? Let me explain the 3 simple causes: 1. Culture The country's recent rural origins still show when one of us becomes highly successful. Just look at L√©a Linster (Bocuse d'Or), Gast Waltzing (Grammy Award), Laurent Witz (Oscar) or Andy Schleck (Tour de France). They never received the LOCAL recognition that they deserve. But it is never too late: put them on a huge display at the Airport! 2. Nonsense For as far as I remember - I arrived in 1996 - Luxembourg has a sick tendency to put obvious guys in the spotlight (Think \"Very early stage weird idea by a lazy team\") and to carefully avoid celebrating successful ones (Think \"The guys who made more money than public servants will ever do\" or \"The rockstars in the making\"). This of course is a by-product of the lack of entrepreneurial culture and reinforces the idea that entrepreneurs are not 'significant' for our economy. 3. The bankers' Paradox Well, the irony is that Finance, by essence, originates in entrepreneurship. Behind every bank, there are wild people following a dream, working 18 hours a day, changing the world with code or new products, taking risks, hiring employees, paying taxes... and generating wealth. (that needs to be protected, structured or invested by banks, lawyers and accountants) 3 ideas to fix this massive issue: - RECOGNISING HEROES Just like in San Francisco, Tel Aviv or Singapore, let's turn successful entrepreneurs into heroes that will motivate young people to start their company, instead of accepting a boring job. (And let's STOP celebrating the ones that have achieved nothing so far) - JOINING FORCES We need more \"early adopters\" like Serge Krancenblum, Rene Beltjens or Martin Vogel who are willing to support talented entrepreneurs by adopting an early version of their solution and sometimes invest in them. - BRIDGING THE GAP WITH PUBLIC SERVANTS We all know that Luxembourg is way behind in its digitisation efforts. Please start giving CONTRACTS to talented start-ups instead of absurd subsidies. It is a win-win game. (And we will get rid of \"Zombie start-ups\" who only survive as long as subsidies are paid) Let's make it happen.\n\nUnderstanding Luxembourg Politics in 3 minutes. Historically, Luxembourg makes huge progress when it is in big trouble. 1929 üò± was a memorable year with the invention of the \"Holding 29\" and the December 19th law unleashed the radio transmission business which gave birth to RTL. (Source: Legilux: https://lnkd.in/e5FUkJAF) The next disaster struck in 1973 with the oil crisis in a country that relied on agriculture and the steel industry. This shock led to the invention of Banking Secrecy (1981). Luxembourg's population went from poor to really rich in 40 years. (Source: Worldbank https://lnkd.in/epvHtBjc) This sudden wealth was triggered first by a Private Banking industry, followed by an Investment funds giant. As of April 2024, more than ‚Ç¨5.485.200.000.000 (or ‚Ç¨5.48tn) of net assets under management sit in Luxembourg (Source: CSSF/ALFI), feeding a whole ecosystem of Custodians, Corporate servicers, lawyers, IT vendors, Big4, etc... and public servants ü§ó This makes Politics here very special for three main reasons. #1 Representativity issues The private sector, which generates the wealth is largely in the hands of foreign companies. Xavier Bettel did try to improve this representativity in his 2015 referendum by suggesting a right for foreigners to vote. This did not work. #2 Real economy vs Public service Public servants represent here between 55 and 70% of voters üò± depending on the method that you use to measure. This has a negative influence on political campaigns, where \"whoever speaks loses\". Voters want \"More of the same\" which is delusional in our fast changing world. #3 The Socrates conundrum Luc Frieden and Xavier Bettel know what is best for the country, but they are always under heavy pressure to do what their voters want, instead. A prime example is provided by the law focusing on rents, which just got - FINALLY - voted. Everyone knew that slamming newcomers with 100% agency commission and 3 months of guarantees was insane and hurting the country's attractiveness. But with so many voters owning property, the vote was delayed multiple times. It took years to get it done. Long story short: - Luxembourg has always been blessed with fantastic politicians, from Joseph Bech to Pierre Werner to Gaston Thorn to Jacques Santer. Jean-Claude Juncker was in charge when money was falling from the sky and he clearly lacked a long term vision, which led Luxembourg in difficulties that could have easily been avoided. (as in \"Unsustainable economy in 2024\") - I believe that the current government understands exactly what it has to do. But to \"make things happen\" in the current context, it needs a very strong leadership, able to explain why reforms are necessary and beneficial for all. - But let's all keep in mind that Luxembourg is small. Posting on Linkedin, contacting politicians and advocating for good policies can have a rapid impact. Let's make it happen.\n\n6 Posts that made me Proud. I started posting 14 months ago to advocate for 3 things: - Election campaigns with real \"programmes\" - Help citizens and residents get REAL with prime DATA (as in \"fight ignorance\") - A healthy accountability at every level 420 posts and 10.9 million views later, here is why the posts below made me proud: - Who works in Luxembourg? This one helped everyone understand WHO the Luxembourg economy actually is. Who wakes up at 6 a.m, creates value and generates taxes. (Thank you Statec) - Opening a bank account Yeah, I was the first to point out at this massive issue a year ago. It was picked up by Laurent Mosar and became a major topic at national level. This is why I post: Luxembourg is small enough to have a REAL IMPACT with Linkedin. - Freedom of speech I survived a year of vicious attacks, most of the time performed in the background by people who would do anything to avoid facing their responsibilities. But I also received an overwhelming support from private, public, political people and journalists. This is Luxembourg in all its beauty: a few weak people largely overpowered by smart and well intentioned people. ‚ù§Ô∏è - CSSF Who is regulating our regulators? Yeah. No-one. Many of you worried for me when I posted about accountability route d'Arlon, which is really odd in a democratic country like Luxembourg. I am in contact with CSSF and the Minister of Justice to evaluate what is acceptable or not when CSSF interacts with journalists, citizens and companies. - Start-up nation I used to be invited to Lhoft parties. Not anymore. Fair enough. But I see how its narrative is changing and how its interactions with start-ups sharpen. I said it many times: Lhoft is a good idea, with great people but an absolute lack of accountability in the past clearly had a negative impact on its performance. I am also trying to get more transparency from Luxinnovation to track the performance of start-ups who received public money. Work in progress! - Housing This is clearly my favorite, since the law has just been voted (Source: Government:https://lnkd.in/ex8rSSx5) As of August 1st, a person renting an apartment will only pay 50% of the agency commission and 2 months of guarantee. This is huge in terms of attractiveness. Clearly, this did not happen \"because of my post\", but I believe it had an influence. This is how politics go in Luxembourg. Everyone knows what to do, but you need to create a sense of urgency to 'make things happen'. ü§£ Long story short: - Let's all unite our efforts to make Luxembourg's economy sustainable again, one post at a time. (I encourage you to post too) - Trust me, everyone - companies, politicians and public servants - want the same thing: a great future for Luxembourg. But bridges of communication between those silos are broken. Linkedin builds powerful bridges! - The absolute priority lies in establishing - by law - a healthy freedom of speech, for citizens and journalists. Let's make it happen!"
