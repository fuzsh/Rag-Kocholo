        "text": "Europe was left decapitated last night as the entire European Commission resigned en masse after a devastating report by an independent committee of inquiry which found that they had \"lost control of the administration\".\n\nThe commission's president, Jacques Santer, came from an emotional commission meeting just after midnight and said: \"In the light of the report from the committee, the members of the commission have unanimously agreed to resign collectively.\"\n\nThe first to go was the Austrian farm commissioner, Franz Fischler. Shortly after 12.30am Brussels time, he walked out of the debate and declared: \"I've resigned. I'm going for a drink.\"\n\nWith one week to go before a crucial European summit in Berlin which is supposed to resolve a bitter budget dispute and prepare the European Union for enlargement to the east, there is now no executive authority left at Brussels to manage the process.\n\nA number of commissioners who were not criticised in the report on fraud and mismanagement, led by Britain's Neil Kinnock, Hans van den Broek of the Netherlands and Austria's Franz Fischler, said they were prepared to put themselves forward again to serve out the remainder of this comission's term.\n\n\"I stand on my record of work which has not been criticised by this committee or anybody else,\" Mr Kinnock said as he left the commission's offices early this morning. \"I accept collective responsibility, although obviously I don't accept collective guilt.\"\n\nBritain's second commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, is now expected to take over the temporary presidency of the commission, most of whose members will continue in caretaker status until European heads of government can agree a new team at the Berlin summit next week.\n\nDowning Street said this morning that the British government would press for the immediate reappointment of Britain's two commissioners. A spokesman said: \"While we have said all along that fraud must be tackled, there is no evidence that Leon Brittan and Neil Kinnock were involved in this in any way.\"\n\nBut under no circumstances will the European Parliament permit the French commissioner and former prime minister, Edith Cresson, who was savaged by the report, to return to office. And Mr Santer was so criticised by the committee of inquiry that it would be difficult for him to be reinstated.\n\n\"Santer must go\", said the Labour MEPs' leader, Alan Donnelly, last night. \"We can no longer have confidence in him, nor in his ability to restore public confidence and bring about the reforms and the fundamental change in the culture of the commission that are clearly required.\"\n\nA fundamental shift in the balance of power of the European Union's institutions has now taken place. The parliament, acting in the name of democratic accountability, has now ended the life of an unelected commission. This has never happened before and it amounts to the passing of Europe's ancien regime, and could presage the dawning of a genuine European democracy.\n\n\"Perhaps now we can move on to a new European culture of transparency and honesty,\" the leader of the Socialist Group of MEPS, Labour MEP Pauline Green, said last night. The night of drama and political bloodshed followed the report by the \"Committee of the Wise\" - five jurists and expert auditors from across Europe - into fraud and mismanagement at the commission.\n\nLast night's decision by the commissioners to quit was taken after an ultimatum from outraged MEPs to resign or be sacked. \"They either go tonight with honour or they are forced out tomorrow without honour,\" one of the leaders of the Socialist Group - the largest in the parliament - had warned.\n\nMs Green said that the commission whistle-blower, Paul van Buitenen, who alerted the parliament to the mismanagement and fraud, had been effectively vindicated, and his suspension by the commission should now be reviewed.\n\nThe devastating inquiry reported that Ms Cresson was guilty of \"a clear-cut case of favouritism\", for employing her home-town friend and dentist. The dentist, Dr Rene Berthelot, was awarded European Union contracts for jobs for which he was unqualified and on which he did little work.\n\nMs Cresson was also accused of \"unacceptable behaviour\" in misleading the European Parliament and her fellow commissioners by failing, \"though in full possession of the facts\", to inform them of serious irregularities within the Leonardo youth training project she oversaw.\n\nThe report said that Mr Santer's answers to the committee of inquiry's questions were \"evasive to an extent which can only be qualified as misleading\". He had deliberately misled the parliament in its inquiries into misconduct at Ms Cresson's department.\n\n\"It is imperative for those working in the community institutions to understand that no strategy of cover-up may ever be considered accaptable,\" the report said. \"No information may be withheld from other institutions, such as parliament.\"\n\n\"It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility,\" it said of the commission's staff.\n\n\"Internal audit and control mechanisms failed to work. Commissioners allowed or encouraged conduct which... was not acceptable. Contracts for services were often awarded under questionable circumstances.\"\n\nThe inquiry found no instance of any commissioner being guilty of personal fraud, but Ms Cresson was repeatedly found to have behaved \"unacceptably\" by showing favouritism, and by misleading the parliament and the commision about fraud inquiries in her department.\n\nThe German commissioner, Monika Wulf-Mathies, and the Portuguese commisioner, Jo Pinheiro, were mildly criticised over the employment of friends and relatives, and the Spanish commissioner, Manuel Marin, was said to have \"exposed Echo [the humanitarian department which he ran] to fraud and irregularities.\""
