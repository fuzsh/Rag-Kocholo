        "text": "Her school, she explained, had no official name and the board of governors had organised a competition inviting pupils to put forward appropriate suggestions. There were, however, strict parameters. The name should be that of a woman, now deceased, whose background and life bore testament to her contribution to the European ideal.\n\nWhat better source of inspiration for the children than the current president of the European Commission? So pen was put to paper in an attempt to elicit Santer’s help.\n\nTaking time out from trying to update the EU’s treaties and calming financial markets’ fears about the viability of the euro, Santer replied to the request. He suggested the former French author Louise Weiss, who had died 13 years earlier and who, as the oldest MEP at the time, had presided over the inaugural session of the first directly elected European Parliament in 1979.\n\n“When he receives personal letters or is contacted by young people, then the president likes to reply to them himself. When he was Luxembourg prime minister, he used to have an open-door policy for people. That is not really possible now, but he enjoys contact with citizens and this can be achieved through letters,” explains a member of Santer’s entourage.\n\nGiven the size of his postbag, the president has plenty of opportunities for such contacts. He may now be more remote from the man or woman in the street than in his Luxembourg days, but that is partly compensated for by a torrent of mail.\n\nOn average, he receives 8,000 personally addressed letters every year, and that figure does not include formal correspondence between EU institutions or from governments. Nor does it take into account petitions, standard letters or ready-printed postcards sent by lobby groups as they canvass support on a particularly emotive issue – a tactic which was prominently used during recent debates on leghold traps and animal testing.\n\nIncoming mail is transported from the Commission’s sorting office to the institution’s Breydel headquarters. Under the well-calibrated system Santer’s team has put in place, every letter is carefully recorded and then filed in the president’s archives on the 12th floor.\n\n“Each letter is registered in a computer and given a reference number so that we can quickly check if an answer has been given or not. We try to reply very quickly and we acknowledge every letter, informing the sender that we have received it and, if necessary, explaining that we have passed it on to the relevant Commission department which will give its own reply in due course,” explains an official.\n\nA large percentage of letters from individuals focus on problems they encounter when trying to exercise their legitimate rights within the Union. The delivery of residence permits, transfer of pension rights, mutual recognition of diplomas and the right to vote in local and European elections are themes which regularly emerge from the postbag.\n\nMany of these are dealt with by Commission officials specialising in the area concerned or by advising correspondents to raise their problems with the relevant national authorities.\n\nBut each complaint is carefully examined in case it might provide grounds for infringement proceedings against member states ignoring EU rules and regulations.\n\nNot surprisingly, a significant proportion of the letters received by Santer overestimate his, the Commission’s and even the European Union’s powers, as the authors beseech him to intervene directly in their personal dramas. To them, the Commission represents a court of last resort through which to appeal against a particular injustice.\n\nSome letters are heart-rending, but more often than not there is little the Commission president can do apart from expressing sympathy and sometimes conveying a certain frustration.\n\nSanter had to give just such a response to a French national who appealed to him shortly before Christmas after his Moroccan mother’s request for a visa to allow her to be present when her daughter-in-law gave birth in France had twice been turned down.\n\nThe reply was considerately drafted, but pointed out clearly that the Commission was unable to intervene in individual visa cases. It also underlined that it was up to the French authorities alone to decide who could reside in France.\n\nA similar response emphasising national responsibility was given more than a year ago to a British couple who were moved to complain about the level of their pensions. Pointing to the role of the European Court of Justice and the Commission as enforcers of Union legislation, the petitioners specifically asked why the latter had not directed the UK government to pay better pensions and provide extra allowances such as free television licences, free phone rental and free travel for the over-65s.\n\nNot all letter writers are motivated by personal hardship or financial considerations. One British citizen struck an unexpected note by inquiring how – as a demonstration of his support for full EU integration – he could annul his UK citizenship and register as a citizen of the Union.\n\nThe diplomatically couched reply confirmed that the Maastricht Treaty had introduced the concept of citizenship of the Union, but pointed out that it could only apply to individuals who were nationals of a member state.\n\nLetters come from across the Union, but the largest number is from the UK, which is not entirely surprising given that writing letters to the press is a national pastime there.\n\nThe issues which prompt citizens to put pen to paper vary noticeably from country to country. While the French tend to write in expressing their concern about unemployment, it is a subject rarely raised in letters from the British.\n\nEnlargement is another theme which now crops up regularly in the postbag, as Santer finds himself being lobbied from all sides.\n\nOne day, it might be a letter from eastern Europeans in the United States calling for accession negotiations to start as soon as possible. The next, it may be a plea from someone whose property was expropriated by a former Communist regime insisting that compensation be made a precondition for any enlargement talks.\n\nEuro MPs also use letters to try to float ideas informally with Santer, rather than use the formal route of written and oral questions. Some, especially British members, enjoy forwarding mail from their constituents and inviting him to reply.\n\nOther delights in the postbag include regular requests from students for help with their theses or school projects on economic and monetary union, and the occasional application for an EU grant. The more musical and linguistically inclined send in ideas for a European anthem or a single language.\n\nSanter is also a target for letter writers from outside the Union, and it is far from unusual for him to receive mail bearing stamps from North Africa or from the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.\n\nThis constant flow of letters provides a useful way of gauging the contradictions of public sentiment, as two recent letters revealed. The first noted: “Mr Santer, like Mr Delors before him, seeks to rule like an absolute monarch, while accepting none of the democratic limitations of a constitutional monarchy.” The second described the president as “a man for whom I felt esteem, then admiration and finally respect”.\n\nWhatever the author’s nationality, Santer’s team already ensures the reply is always given in the appropriate EU language, as will soon be formally required under the terms of the Amsterdam Treaty. Between them, Santer’s own advisers can cope with virtually all the Union’s official languages, only having to go outside for help with Swedish and Finnish.\n\nWhile the exercise is certainly time-consuming, there is little doubt that it fits in with Santer’s firm belief that the Union and its institutions should be accessible to ordinary citizens. And what more natural way than by the humble letter?"
