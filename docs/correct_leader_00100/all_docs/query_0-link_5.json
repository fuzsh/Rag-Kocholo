        "text": "The Santer Commission held office from 1995 to 1999 (15 March). It managed the period which preceded the Treaty of Nice (2000-2001) and the EU’s enlargement to 25 Member States (2004). Its mandate was marked by the Amsterdam Treaty’s signature (1997) and the birth of the single currency (Euro) (1998) (source: European Commission, archived webpage, accessed on 3 April 2024).\n\nThe European Commission until the year 2000\n\nThis video introduces the twenty members of the new Commission under the presidency of Jacques Santer. It also explains the responsabilities of each member of the team, which is to remain in office until the year 2000."
