        "text": "In response to requests from MEPs for a statement, Santer will seek to draw a line under the recent controversy over Economics Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy’s announcement that he intended to run for political office in his native Brittany in France’s forthcoming regional elections.\n\nOfficials said that Santer would make a statement to the European Parliament even though De Silguy declared this week that he was pulling out of the race.\n\nThe French Commissioner said the publicity surrounding his decision had led to “misunderstandings” and he wanted to make it clear that he was committed first and foremost to the introduction of the single currency.\n\nIn an interview with European Voice, De Silguy insisted that he had not been asked by the Commission president to choose between his role as a Commissioner and his political ambitions. “Jacques Santer never said to me, never, that there was an incompatibility between the two,” he said.\n\nThe president himself said that he was delighted with De Silguy’s decision to concentrate on the euro until the end of his Brussels mandate.\n\nThe Commission would make no official comment on whether the president had any direct influence over the Frenchman’s change of heart.\n\nHowever, well-informed sources close to Santer argued that this week’s events spoke for themselves. “As soon as it was clear that this issue was going to be a story, the two men spoke to each other everyday. I don’t know what they said, but the result is there,” said one.\n\nWhatever the reasons behind De Silguy’s decision, the episode has once again raised the question of what outside work Commissioners may take on.\n\nDe Silguy himself said he would welcome a clarification of the rules, although he insisted that he saw no conflict of interest between working as a Commissioner and holding elected office in local or regional government.\n\n“If there are doubts, if this question has shown that there are differences of interpretation, I can only see an advantage in clarifying matters,” he said. “If it is made clear what you must do, what you must not do, what you can do, what you cannot do, that seems like a good thing to me.”\n\nDe Silguy added that he believed cultural differences between the northern and southern EU countries over what a Commissioner should be allowed to do had also played a part in the recent furore.\n\n“The southern countries and the northern countries do not have the same idea of what a Commissioner is and what a Commissioner’s role is,” he argued, adding: “I think that if you say that Commissioners are politicians, it is important that they are able to work ‘on the ground’.”\n\nDe Silguy also pointed out that, if elected, he would not have been the first Commissioner to hold down political office and a Brussels job. His colleague Edith Cresson was mayor of the French town of Châtellerault for three years while serving as Research Commissioner."
