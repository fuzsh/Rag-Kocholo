The Belgian newspaper <i>Le Soir</i> proclaimed on Saturday (30 May): <i>“Nouveau scandale à l’Union européene.”</i> The European Union’s anti-fraud office OLAF has disclosed that it is investigating allegations of irregularities in the performance of a contract for cleaning Commission buildings.",

        "text": "What will add to the discomfort of the Commission is that two months ago OLAF said that, with the help of the Italian and Belgian authorities, it was investigating allegations of corruption in the leasing and procurement of buildings for Commission delegations outside Brussels.\n\nSuch reports are grist to the mill of those convinced that the EU institutions are a breeding-ground for venality, staffed by corrupt officials whose primary skill is to cheat the European taxpayer.\n\nFor them, every allegation of fraud reawakens memories of that heady night on 15 March 1999 when the Commission of Jacques Santer resigned, brought low by a succession of scandals, collected together in one media-friendly report by ‘independent experts’. Arguably the credibility of the Commission has still not recovered.\n\nBut even those of a slightly less hostile persuasion, those ready to concede that some EU officials might mean well, should reflect on the latest allegations – and despair.\n\nSome incurable optimists might point to these allegations as evidence that the fight against fraud is making progress: the investigators are doing their work and the rogues are being rooted out.\n\nBut such optimism is misplaced. The sticking point is what happens next. OLAF investigates; it does not prosecute. How long does it take for a case to be brought to court and with what result? The EU institutions are at the mercy of the offices of the public prosecutors, in whichever country any mishap has occurred – generally either Belgium or Luxembourg.\n\nThe track-record is not encouraging. It takes years for the public prosecutor to bring even relatively simple cases to trial – and fraud cases are not often simple. The priorities of the Belgian prosecutors are not necessarily the same as those of the EU institutions. A fraud case involving a few thousand pounds, though it can be hugely important for an EU institution, may not matter to a Brussels prosecutor who is spoilt for choice of crimes to pursue. Take the case of Giacomo Regaldo, who was in line to become president of the European Economic and Social Committee. He was accused of fiddling his expenses – not a huge crime on the Belgian scale of things, but of importance to the credibility of one particular EU institution. The case has still not come to court, though the committee in the meantime chose someone else to be its new president and the Italian government chose not to nominate him for a further term.\n\nOLAF has also passed to the public prosecutor a file on officials at the Committee of the Regions accused of making irregular claims for remuneration. When, if ever, it might see the light of day, is anybody’s guess.\n\nThe delays and the waiting are a nightmare for those who are supposed to be managing a European public service. In the first place, they may be managing staff not knowing that those officials are under investigation by OLAF. Later they may be notified of an OLAF investigation but, at the risk of litigation, the management has to treat the staff as innocent until proven guilty. And the timetable rests with the Belgian public prosecutor rather than the EU. For their part, the staff, who may be falsely accused, have to wait ages for a chance to clear their name. Even if they do resort to the EU’s courts for redress, the process is just as drawn out. The civil service tribunal delivered a ruling in May on the case of Jean-Louis Giraudy, who was removed from his post at the Commission’s delegation in Paris in 2002, having been falsely implicated in fraud allegations. Five years is too long to wait. Similarly it took too long for the European Court of Justice to reach the laughable conclusion in July 2006 that Edith Cresson, whose favouritism had contributed mightily to the downfall of the Santer Commission, should not have her pension rights cut because its ruling that she had breached her duties as a commissioner was punishment enough.\n\nA verdict is a healthy outcome – it clears the air, it disperses the accumulated layers of rumour and innuendo. In the limbo period, information of dubious reliability can cause further problems. In the cleaning contract case, Le Soir suggested that the company concerned had a contract to clean the headquarters of the Council of Ministers, the Justus Lipsius building. Commission officials latched on to this information – it suggested that the Commission was not alone in this case, but the company had never had a contract to clean Justus Lipsius. From early 2004 to August 2005 it had a contract to clean a Council warehouse in Overijse – a contract that paid €1,400 per month, not enough to maintain the interest of the company which handed in its notice in May 2005.\n\nA court verdict, as well as clarifying who was in the right and who in the wrong, also has the merit of sending out a message of deterrence to those who might be tempted to stray: they run the risk of being caught and punished. That is one of various ways of improving the ethical culture in the European public service. Sadly the wheels of justice grind so slowly in Belgium that no one hears that message.\n\nThere are solutions. The Commission has since 2000 been asking for the creation of a European public prosecutor – an idea that would have been permitted by the (rejected) EU constitution. It is an idea that should not be abandoned, even though it offends those national governments which jealously guard the superiority of common law.\n\nAn alternative solution – one that will not be uppermost in the minds of those voting in the Belgian elections on Sunday – is for the Belgian prosecution service to improve its act, recruit more staff and clear its backlog of cases. Don’t hold your breath."
