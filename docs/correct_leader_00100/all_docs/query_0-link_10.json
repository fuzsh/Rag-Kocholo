        "text": "Anglo-German plans for 'root and branch reform' of the European Commission could be blocked by the EU's smallest member, Luxembourg, whose prime minister has vowed to veto any interim commission which does not include the disgraced Jacques Santer.\n\nLuxembourg's prime minister Jean-Claude Juncker last night warned fellow EU states that they must either appoint a wholly new commission or reinstate Mr Santer.\n\n'The Duchy of Luxembourg will exercise its right of veto if Europe tries to opt for the solution of a temporary commission without Jacques Santer,' he said on Luxembourg TV yesterday.\n\n'It is absolutely essential that nobody tries to equate Jacques Santer with Edith Cresson.'\n\nMr Juncker, prime minister of a country with only 470,000 people, has promised to send his predecessor Mr Santer back to Brussels as a member of the European parliament.\n\nHe is now threatening to block this week's EU summit in Berlin, which is expected to nominate an interim commission to serve for the rest of the year. The European Parliament has already said it will block such a commission if it includes Mr Santer.\n\nLuxembourg's defiance has overshadowed the commission reform plan put forward last night by the Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook.\n\nThe plan, which would make the Brussels bureaucracy more flexible and responsive to the European parliament and council, has strong backing from Germany and Scandinavian members.\n\nBritain is also preparing a far more ambitious set of reforms which would require changes in the European treaties and would permanently clip the commission's wings by removing its current monopoly right to initiate EU legislation.\n\nMr Cook proposed an 'external audit' system by outside management consultants which would suggest sweeping changes. It would also stop the commission monitoring its own spending, by calling in independent outside experts to oversee how the money is used.\n\n'Europe needs a transparent and efficient management structure,' he told the EU general affairs council.\n\n'We need to create a truly European administrative culture based on the best we all can offer.'\n\nBut his proposals threaten to bring about a confrontation with the powerful trade unions of the commission staff, which last year staged a one-day strike to block a modest reform plan put forward by the commission led by Mr Santer.\n\nThe Foreign Secretary suggested giving the next commission president a mandate to make promotions 'transparent and based on proven ability', to cut back on senior staff, and to hold regular staff performance reviews, making it easier to sack 'unsuitable staff'."
