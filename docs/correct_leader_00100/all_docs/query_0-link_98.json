        "text": "The 144-page report of the committee of experts into allegations of fraud, mismanagement and nepotism in the European Commission lists a devastating catalogue of lax management at the heart of the European Commission, reaching up to the highest level.\n\nWorse, it claims the Commission - the European Union's 14,000-member executive civil service - is reluctant to take responsibility for its actions.\n\nIt concludes: 'The studies carried out by the committee have too often revealed a growing reluctance among the members of the hierarchy to acknowledge responsibility.\n\n'It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility. The temptation to deprive the concept of responsibility of all substance is a dangerous one. That concept is the ultimate manifestation of democracy.'\n\nThe criticism is so strong because the 20 commissioners at the head of the organisation are all appointed by their member state, and many are former politicians or ministers, even heads of government. They have been subject to no political control and few constraints, with no code of conduct, a vestigial register of interests and no power of sanction within the organisation.\n\nThe targets of most condemnation are Edith Cresson, the former French prime minister who is responsible for education and research, and Jacques Santer, the former prime minister of Luxembourg and current president of the Commission.\n\nJacques Delors, his predecessor, is criticised, too, for not following up allegations of fraud in the Commission's own security service.\n\nThe report's conclusions state that the eight commissioners called before the wise men's committee sometimes argued that they were not aware of what was happening in their own departments: 'Undoubted instances of fraud and corruption in the Commission have thus passed unnoticed at the level of the commissioners themselves.'\n\nThe committee acknowledges that it did not uncover any instances of individual fraud by commissioners, but it adds that it found 'instances where commissioners or the Commission as a whole bear responsibility for instances of fraud, irregularities or mismanagement in their services or areas of responsibility'.\n\nThe report examines a number of cases of alleged misconduct, or mismanagement, and the irregular appointment of friends and relatives, all of them previously publicised.\n\nIt finds Ms Cresson's appointment of her septuagenarian dentist, Rene Berthelot, from her home town of Chatelleraut to head the EU Aids research project was a clear instance of favouritism, noting that most of his missions out of the office were to go home.\n\nIt criticises Monika Wulf-Mathies, the German former trade union leader now in charge of the Commission's regional policy, for using an inappropriate procedure to appoint an associate to her personal staff.\n\nAnd it says that although the Portuguese commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro used correct procedures to appoint his brother-in-law as an adviser, no commissioner should appoint 'a close relative to work in his or her private office'.\n\nThe report criticises Manuel Marin, the Spanish vice-president of the Commission, for responding too slowly to accusations of fraud within the Med project, directing EU aid to the poorer parts of the Mediterranean area.\n\nOf the Leonardo youth training programme supervised by Ms Cresson, it says '[She] failed to act in response to known serious and continuing irregularities over several years... Ms Cresson further bears serious responsibility for having failed, though in full possession of the facts, to inform the president of the Commission and through him the European Parliament of the problems.' The committee is highly critical of Mr Santer. Regarding allegations of fraud in the Commission's security office, for which he was responsible, it says: 'Neither he nor his private office took any meaningful interest in the way it operated. No supervision was exercised, and a state within a state was allowed to develop.'\n\nWhile it clears the president of allegations of favouritism, the committee claims that Mr Santer was evasive to the European Parliament last November, in particular to questions from the British Labour MEP for Leicester, Sue Waddington, about the allegations concerning the Leonardo programme. It says his answers can only be qualified as misleading.\n\nThe report says: 'Bad management stems from repeated failure to comply with [financial regulations]. It has produced a powerful tendency towards negligence and... a willingness to dispense with procedures and even to forget fundamental principles concerning the award of contracts.'\n\nIt concludes: 'Contracts for the provision of services were often awarded under questionable circumstances, a situation encouraged by the vagueness and the scattered nature of the texts governing the award of contracts... Internal audit and control mechanisms failed to work effectively.'\n\nIt says disciplinary proceedings against members were rare, and often too late and too lenient.\n\nJaques Santer\n\nThe genial and rubicund 61-year-old former prime minister of Luxembourg, surprisingly chosen in 1994 to be the Commission president as 'the right man in the right place at the right time', has proved a great contrast to his hyperactive predecessor, Jacques Delors. That is partly why John Major was able to persuade fellow leaders to pick him.\n\nBut Mr Santer - known in Luxembourg as 'Jacques Digestif' because of his liking for the good life - has been unable to impose his authority.\n\nHis slogan, 'Doing less but better', has proved only half-true, which is why the likes of Tony Blair and Gerhard Schroder have little time for him.\n\nHis hopes of a second five-year term appear doomed and he is expected to return to well-paid executive jobs in Luxembourg.\n\nPersonally scrupulous, he is dismayed that his commission will be remembered for sleaze rather than the launch of the euro.\n\nEdith Cresson\n\nThe 65-year-old former French Socialist prime minister, and the chief victim of the report, was seconded to Brussels four years ago.\n\nHer arrogance and obvious distaste for her job as commissioner in charge of research and education gained her few friends among MEPs or bureaucrats even before the crisis over the decision to appoint her former dentist to an EU advisory post for which he was not qualified.\n\nShe has so far refused to accept that she has done anything wrong, either in allowing her advisers to recruit relatives and friends to Commission posts or in the lack of supervision of the EU's Leonardo training project which permitted an outside company to cream off funds and is now subject to a police investigation.\n\nBefore the report, Ms Cresson maintained she had the support of both the French government and President Chirac - once a fellow MEP - and that Paris would not stand for the national humiliation that would follow if she were to become the first commissioner in 40 years to be forced out of office.\n\nJoao De Deus Pinheiro\n\nThe 53-year-old Portuguese commissioner, in charge of relations with the African, Pacific and Caribbean countries, was criticised for appointing his brother-in-law as his chief adviser, even though he followed procedures. His wife is also on the Commission staff.\n\nA bearded, genial figure and former Portuguese foreign minister, he has gained a reputation for spending as much time on the golf course as behind his desk. Golf, he says, is an excellent way of clearing the mind.\n\n'Let's face it, I've always been politically incorrect. I like good jokes, fast cars and pretty women, and I smoke a packet of cigarettes a day. Life's more fun when you are a bon vivant,' he said in an interview in 1997.\n\nMr Pinheiro trained as a chemical engineer and was formerly a lecturer at Mozambique University. He confesses to being a country music fan and nightclubber but he maintains a low profile in the Commission. 'His department exists despite his presence,' one observer told a French magazine recently."
