        "text": "Jean-Claude Juncker (born December 9, 1954, Redange-sur-Attert, Luxembourg) is a Luxembourgian politician who served as prime minister of Luxembourg (1995–2013) and later was president of the European Commission (EC; 2014–19).\n\nJuncker grew up in southern Luxembourg and attended boarding school in Belgium. He joined the Christian Social People’s Party (Chrëschtlech Sozial Vollekspartei; CSV) in 1974, and the following year he enrolled at the University of Strasbourg, France. In 1979 he earned a law degree and was named parliamentary secretary for the CSV. He received his first government post in 1982, when he was named secretary of state for employment and social security under CSV Prime Minister Pierre Werner. Juncker was elected to the legislature in 1984, and he was appointed to the cabinet of Prime Minister Jacques Santer as labour minister. In 1989 he was named finance minister and took a seat on the board of governors of the World Bank. He was elected chairman of the CSV in January 1990, and throughout 1991–92 he served as one of the chief architects and proponents of the Maastricht Treaty, the foundational document for the European Union.\n\nWhen Santer became president of the EC in January 1995, Juncker succeeded him as prime minister. Juncker’s term in office was characterized by robust economic performance—Luxembourg boasted a per capita GDP that was among the world’s highest—and he remained a prominent fixture in the upper echelons of European politics. His government collapsed in 2013 when it was revealed that Luxembourg’s intelligence service had engaged in widespread abuses, including bribery and the unauthorized surveillance of political figures.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2013 Juncker helmed the Eurogroup—a body consisting of the finance ministers from all of the euro-zone countries. In that role he helped shape the response to the sovereign debt crisis that had crippled economies within the euro zone beginning in 2009. In March 2014 the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) selected Juncker to succeed José Manuel Barroso as president of the EC. Juncker was an ardent proponent of greater European integration, and his nomination was championed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. However, British Prime Minister David Cameron, spurred by a strong Euroskeptic current within both his own Conservative Party and the United Kingdom Independence Party, led a concerted effort to oppose Juncker’s candidacy. Over the objections of Cameron and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Juncker was approved for the EU’s top job on June 27, and he was officially elected to the position by the European Parliament on July 15.\n\nWhen Juncker took office on November 1, he was confronted with the myriad challenges facing the EU, including a sluggish economy, a Russian-backed insurgency in Ukraine, and welling Euroskeptic sentiment that called into question the very purpose of the EU. He also faced accusations from Euroskeptic members of Parliament, who claimed that Juncker had orchestrated a tax-avoidance scheme involving hundreds of multinational companies during his tenure as prime minister of Luxembourg; Juncker denied the allegations."
