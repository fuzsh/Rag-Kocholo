        "text": "Jacques Santer (born May 18, 1937, Wasserbillig, Luxembourg) is a Luxembourgian politician who served as prime minister of Luxembourg (1984–95) and president of the European Commission (1995–99).\n\nSanter graduated from the Athénée de Luxembourg, earned a certificate from the Paris Institute of Political Studies in 1959, and studied law at the Universities of Strasbourg and Paris, completing a degree from the latter in 1960. Shortly after beginning his law career, he entered politics, serving the Christian Social People’s Party as its parliamentary secretary (1966–72; becoming Luxembourg’s secretary of state for social and cultural affairs in the last year), secretary-general (1972–74), and, ultimately, president (1974–82). In 1975 he became a member of the European Parliament and served there until 1979.\n\nSanter was first elected Luxembourg’s prime minister in 1984; he was reelected in 1989 and 1994. At different times during his three terms, he took on the additional portfolios of Finance and Communications, Treasury, and Cultural Affairs. Essential agreements concerning a single economic market and the Maastricht Treaty were reached under Santer’s guidance in 1985 and 1991, respectively, during Luxembourg’s six-month stewardships of the rotating presidency of the Council of Ministers (the main decision-making institution of the European Economic Community, later renamed the Council of the European Union [EU]). From 1987 to 1990 Santer assumed the leadership of the European People’s Party, a coalition that united Christian Democratic and other conservative parties in the European Parliament.\n\nIn July 1994, just weeks after his reelection as Luxembourg’s prime minister, Santer was named the next president of the European Commission, the executive organ of the EU. A compromise choice, he was selected at a special meeting of the heads of government of the member countries of the EU. Although Santer lacked the commanding presence of his predecessor, France’s Jacques Delors, he was known for his skills as a quiet conciliator. Santer’s vision of a federalized, “non-Napoleonic” Europe also contrasted with that of Delors, who for 10 years had been the voice of EU centralization. “The more Europe is decentralized, the stronger it is,” Santer remarked.\n\nHe assumed the reins of the EU administration in January 1995, at a crucial time in the EU’s movement toward political and economic integration. During his term Santer presided over the opening of membership negotiations with several countries of eastern and central Europe. He also oversaw the introduction of the euro, the monetary unit and currency of the EU, in most member countries on January 1, 1999. The successful currency transition, which took years of planning, ultimately was overshadowed by a report instigated by the European Parliament that accused the entire European Commission of fraud and mismanagement. On March 16, 1999, in an unprecedented response to the allegations, all 20 European commissioners, including Santer, resigned.\n\nFollowing his resignation, Santer returned to the European Parliament, where he served as a member until 2004. From 2003 to 2005 he was also the president of the SME Union (Small and Medium Entrepreneurs Union), a network of probusiness conservative political organizations overseen by the European People’s Party. After stepping down from that post, he maintained the title of honorary president of the SME Union."
