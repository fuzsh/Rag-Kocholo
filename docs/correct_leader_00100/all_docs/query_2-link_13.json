        "text": "The crisis in Brussels deepened yesterday when the president of the European Commission, Jacques Santer, became embroiled in political warfare with German MEPs.\n\nThe commission - which is at loggerheads with the European Parliament over reports of fraud and mismanagement in commission projects - faces further flak after the release of a confidential audit report accusing senior managers working for the education commissioner, Edith Cresson, of 'a lack of integrity'.\n\nThe report alleges irregularities in the management of the Â£240 million education and training budget.\n\nIt is increasingly likely that a majority of MEPs will now vote to censure the commission next week; a move which will plunge Europe's institutions into crisis and derail reforms of the EU budget and common agricultural policy.\n\nThe German MEPs are outraged at what they see as threats by Mr Santer to attack the record of Germany's former finance commissioner Peter Schmidhuber unless the Germans back away from parliament's threatened vote of censure.The leader of Germany's Christian Social Union group of MEPs, Ingo Friedrich, said yesterday that Mr Santer's behaviour had been 'totally unacceptable'.\n\n'Santer made a direct connection between our activities and our votes as MEPs and the work of the former finance commissioner Schmidhuber,' he said.\n\nMr Schmidhuber, now a senior figure at the Bundesbank, has written to Mr Santer accusing him of 'bizarre behaviour' and 'unfounded allegations', and demanding a formal retraction.\n\nBut the president's spokeswoman denied that he had threatened the German MEPs.\n\nShe insisted that the commission had no allegations to make against Mr Schmidhuber but neither he nor the German MEPs were prepared to let the matter drop.\n\nIn a letter sent to all 27,000 commission staff yesterday, Mr Santer said that the events of the past few days had affected him personally.\n\n'The criticism of the commission has some basis . . . we are confronted by a certain number of serious irregularities and even of cases of fraud,' he admitted\n\nThere is a mood close to panic at the commission as it awaits the censure vote, which will take place in Strasbourg next week.\n\nThe leaders of the various political groupings will meet today to decide their strategy, with the greens, liberals, conservatives, nationalists and a growing number of socialist defectors bracing themselves to vote for censure.\n\nLast month a confident Mr Santer dared MEPs to hold a vote of censure against him, but such is parliament's anger and loss of confidence in the commission that this now threatens to be the most spectacular own goal in the history of Brussels politics.\n\nSocialist commissioners like Neil Kinnock, Monika Wulf-Mathies of Germany and Erkki Liikanen of Finland, who had counted on solidarity from Social Democrats, are now finding that MEPs across party lines are determined that the commission should be brought to book.\n\nTwo-thirds of German Social Democrat MEPs voted last month against approving the commission's stewardship of the budget, and the vice-president of the Socialist group, Renate Schmidt, has joined British and German conservatives in demanding the resignations of key commissioners.\n\nPauline Green, the Labour MEP who leads the Socialist group in parliament, tabled the vote of censure in the hope that the commission would be vindicated. She now finds that not all Socialists will be toeing the party line.\n\nA two-thirds majority is required to pass a vote of censure. It now looks as though at least half the MEPs will vote for it, leaving the commission in office but disgraced.\n\nThe pressure on individual commissioners to resign would then become intense."
