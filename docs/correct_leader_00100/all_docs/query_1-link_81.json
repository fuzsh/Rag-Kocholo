        "text": "A culture of cronyism, nepotism, mismanagement and fraud inside the European Commission is to be laid bare in an official report tomorrow - but it is expected to recommend that no heads should roll among the European Commissioners. The five 'wise men' appointed in January to investigate fraud allegations in the EU are expected to say the staff regulations drawn up by French civil servants in the 1950s are so rigid that they prevent Commissioners from administering their departments effectively. But their 150-page report is unlikely to silence calls for the sacking of at least two Commissioners, including the former French Prime Minister, Edith Cresson, accused of knowing what was going on but failing to prevent it. Cresson, an elegant but arrogant figure, was previously famous, at least in anglophone circles, for her assertion that most Englishmen are homosexual.\n\nRight-wing MEPs, including British Tories, have been demanding her dismissal for months, but Socialists, among them Labour MEPs, accused the Right of targeting Socialist Commissioners while ignoring allegations against Commissioners from their own side. However, North London MEP Pauline Green, leader of the European Parliament's 214-strong Socialist group, hinted yesterday that her group was now prepared to call for the sacking of Cresson if there was enough evidence. She warned Commission President Jacques Santer: 'If you don't act, we will.' But Tory MEP leader Edward McMillan-Scott accused Green and the British Government of shielding Cresson by resisting a move last January to censure individual Commissioners. 'If Edith Cresson had been a British Minister, or Prime Minister of France, she would have been called to account, as Peter Mandelson and many others have been,' he said. 'But the British Socialists are afraid of upsetting the French, so they settle for the lowest common denominator, and Tony Blair hasn't lifted a finger in the present crisis, except to endorse the appalling behaviour of Pauline Green.' Cresson is under scrutiny for appointing her septuagenarian dentist to a prime research position in the EU and for allowing close advisers to appoint their relatives to the EU gravy train. Also in the frame is Manuel Marin, the Spanish Commissioner, held responsible for the mismanagement of EU humanitarian funds which saw millions of pounds being lost, unaccounted for, in aid programmes, chiefly in Africa in the mid-1990s. The infighting could be bloody this week. Expressing thinly veiled contempt for Santer and her other accusers, Cresson insists she has the backing of the French government. Paris, it is said, will not allow her to be made a scapegoat for long-standing managerial problems in Brussels. The crisis has exposed a lack of effective control over the Commissioners, all appointed by their member states without having any obligation to the President, especially to one who has proved as ineffectual as Santer, the former Prime Minister of Luxembourg.\n\nCommissioners may choose how many non-Commission officials may be imported, or what influence may be brought to secure them top jobs in the next Commission.\n\nThe lack of measures threatened a new row with the European parliament, which came close to sacking the entire Commission in January over fraud, mismanagement and nepotism.\n\nThe Commission president, Jacques Santer, announcing the new code yesterday, made it clear that he expected Edith Cresson, the commissioner most under attack in Brussels, to resign, if she were condemned by the 'Committee of the Wise', the independent experts whose report on the behaviour of commissioners is due on March 15.'Conclusions will be drawn on the basis of the committee's report, and if they conclude that the position of certain commissioners is in question, then I think those commissioners should behave as politicians - they all know, from their former duties, what they should do,' Mr Santer said.\n\nBut last night, Ms Cresson, whose close friend and dentist Rene Berthelot and his various favours in Brussels provoked the current controversy over commission ethics, told French journalists that she would not be resigning and that she had the backing of both President Jacques Chirac and the French prime minister, Lionel Jospin.\n\nMs Cresson claimed her colleagues could not adopt a new code of conduct in mid-term and that they should be sticking by her. 'I cannot believe the president of the Commission is no longer in favour of collegiality.\n\nThe Commission is the guardian of the EU treaty, it cannot just change the rules,' she said.\n\nMs Cresson has accused the German government and media of a conspiracy to discredit her by fabricating allegations of EU corruption as part of Germany's current campaign to reduce its payments to the European budget - charges dismissed by Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, as 'absolute codswallop'.\n\nIf Ms Cresson were to be forced out she would be the first commissioner in the EU's 40-year history to be made to resign in such a humiliating fashion. The EU treaty says that to do so would require a petition by the Commission president to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.\n\nAs well as failing to agree measures to tackle the celebrated 'affaire Cresson', the Commission's failure to introduce a new code of conduct for the commissioners' cabinets, the teams of six or more staff that run their departments, drew strong criticism.\n\n'Anybody who knows how Brussels works knows that any serious reform has to start with the cabinets,' said the Tory MEP James Elles, a central figure in Parliament's bid to hold the Commission accountable.\n\nAmong the rules that were announced, more questions seemed to be raised than answered. While it was agreed that the wives and partners of commissioners would have to declare their professional activities, it was not clear whether they would be published, or be a private declaration to the Commission president. It was also not clear whether a commissioner's spouse would be allowed to hold Commission jobs or contracts, as at least three do now.\n\nNor were any new rules established for the children or other relatives of commissioners. Mr Santer had tried hard to persuade other commissioners to agree a sweeping set of reforms, including rules on the cabinets, but he was unable to secure agreement yesterday, as the 20 commissioners wrangled way beyond the time set for their usual weekly meeting.\n\nNew rules for old problems o No commissioner may exercise any other professional activity, paid or unpaid o Commissioners may not hold any elective office o Any honorific posts must not show a conflict of interest o Commissioners must declare their financial interests and those of their spouse o Professional activities of spouses must be declared o No gift of more than 150 euros (Â£98) can be accepted"
