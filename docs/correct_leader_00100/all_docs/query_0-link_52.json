        "text": "The 1994 parliamentary elections were held simultaneously with those for Luxembourg's representatives to the European Parliament.\n\nDuring the campaign, emphasis was placed on the issues of the social welfare and the status of foreigners in the country, who constitute a sizeable percentage of the work force. Despite the particular efforts of the liberal Democratic Party (PD/DP) and the Greens, polling results saw little change in the relative strengths of the parties represented in the Chamber of Deputies, none of them gaining or losing more than one seat. With this outcome, the Christian Social Party (PCS/CSV) and the Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party (POSL/LSAP), in alliance since 1984 and together having a comfortable majority in the Chamber, agreed on 17 June to renew their governing coalition, which is headed by Prime Minister Jacques Santer (PCS/CSV)."
