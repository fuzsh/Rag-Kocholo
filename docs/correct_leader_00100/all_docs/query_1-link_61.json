        "text": "Born on\n\n05 January 1921\n\nat Berg Castle, Luxembourg\n\nBiography\n\nGrand Duke Jean Benoît Guillaume Robert Antoine Louis Marie Adolphe Marc d'Aviano de Luxembourg, Duke of Nassau, Prince of Bourbon-Parma, was the eldest son of Grand Duchess Charlotte and Prince Félix of Bourbon-Parma. His godfather was His Holiness Pope Benedict XV.\n\nPrince Jean spent most of his childhood at Berg Castle. He started his primary and secondary education in Luxembourg and completed it at Ampleforth College (Yorkshire) in Great Britain from 1934 to 1938. When he came of age on 5 January 1939, he received the title of Crown Prince of Luxembourg in his capacity as Heir Apparent to the Crown of the Grand Duchy.\n\nThe Crown Prince married Princess Joséphine-Charlotte of Belgium on 9 April 1953.\n\nFor more information on H.R.H. Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte\n\nRead her biography\n\nTheir Royal Highnesses Grand Duchess Charlotte, Prince Felix and Prince Jean\n\nYears of exile and war\n\nOn 10 May 1940, Prince Jean left Luxembourg with his parents to escape German occupation. The family took refuge first in France, then in Spain and finally in Portugal. The next stage took them to the United States, Canada and Great Britain. In Quebec, Prince Jean studied law and political science at Laval University.\n\nGoodwill Tour\n\nBetween 1941 and 1942, Prince Jean went on a Goodwill Tour to meet the Luxemburgish diaspora in the United States and in Brazil on behalf of his mother H.R.H. Grand Duchess Charlotte and with the support of the government of Prime Minister Pierre Dupong. The objective of the tour was to create a solidarity movement and to set up a support fund for the reconstruction of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the National Relief Fund.\n\nThis Goodwill Tour took him to major cities in the American Midwest, where a large community of Luxembourgers and their descendants lived: Chicago, Aurora, Dubuque, Luxemburg, Remsen, Milwaukee, Saint Paul, Minneapolis and Port Washington. During the Goodwill Tour, the Prince condemned the invasion of the Grand Duchy:\n\n“ We did not want to become either French or German, we wish to remain Luxembourgers and live in peace with the whole world. ”\n\nIn his speeches, Prince Jean denounced the actions in Germany and Europe of Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler and called on the Americans and the Luxemburgish diaspora to show solidarity with the Grand Duchy.\n\nBetween 19 June and 8 July 1942, Prince Jean continued his tour in Brazil, where large colonies of Luxembourgers had settled as well.\n\nPrince Jean's military service in the British army\n\nOn 6 October 1942, the Crown Prince and his father, Prince Félix, left Canada for Great Britain to join the British army. Following the advice of King George VI, Prince Jean joined the Irish Guards. The first few months of training took the Prince to Caterham and Pirbright and eventually to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, established in Mons Barracks, Aldershot, which he left with the rank of Second Lieutenant on 28 July 1943. On the same day, he addressed the Luxembourg people on the BBC.\n\nIn August 1943, the Prince joined the Guards training battalion at Lingfield. During this period, he was sometimes on guard outside Buckingham Palace and he always vividly remembered the 'visit' of his mother and sisters when he was supposed to remain completely still.\n\nIn February 1944, he joined the 3rd Battalion Irish Guards in the Guards Armoured Division stationed at Malton, Yorkshire. There, the battalion received training in preparation for the Normandy landings. On 3 March 1944, Prince Jean was promoted to lieutenant. At the end of April, the battalion moved to Eastbourne in great secrecy.\n\nLieutenant 'Jean de Luxembourg' and J. 'Busty' Kevill pose for a picture in front of their service vehicle\n\nLanding and liberation\n\nOn 11 June 1944, Prince Jean landed in Normandy as part of a reinforcement unit. His unit preceded the 3rd Battalion which did not land near Arromanches until 23 June. He subsequently served in Normandy in the 32nd Brigade of the Guards Armoured Division, taking part in the Battle of Caen (Operation Goodwood). Having suffered heavy losses, the Guards Armoured Division was then placed under the command of XXX Corps and was ordered to advance towards the Belgian border.\n\nOn 25 August (the day of the liberation of Paris), the soldiers of the Division crossed the Seine near Vernon; on 29 August, they were on the Somme. Liberating Arras and Douai in the process, they reached Brussels on the evening of 3 September. The next day, the division took part in the military ceremonies in front of the monument of the Unknown Soldier and in front of the Hôtel de Ville, then continued towards the east. On 7 September in Bourg-Léopold, Prince Jean received the order to join his father, Prince Félix, with the 5th American armoured division (Victory Division).\n\nOn 10 September 1944, a few hours after his father, he crossed the Luxembourg border with the American troops who liberated the Grand Duchy. In the afternoon, he arrived in Luxembourg City, where a large crowd greeted him with great enthusiasm.\n\nOn 10 September 1944, Prince Félix and Prince Jean victoriously enter Luxembourg\n\nEnd of hostilities\n\nAfter spending a few days in liberated Luxembourg, Prince Jean joined his unit engaged in Operation Market Garden (liberation of Arnhem) on 17 September. During the Battle of the Bulge, the Guards Armoured Division was stationed between Tienen and Namur with the mission of blocking the road to Antwerp.\n\nOn February 11th, 1945, the 32nd Brigade was engaged in the Reichswald attacks (south of Nijmegen) against the Siegfried Line. It participated in the capture of the Reichswald northwest of Wesel and continued the campaign with the Allied forces in Germany until the end of hostilities.\n\nOnce the German resistance in this sector was broken, the Guards Armoured Division moved towards Bremen and Hamburg. At the beginning of April 1945, Prince Jean was ordered to go to Luxembourg, where the return of Grand Duchess Charlotte was expected. On 14 April 1945, the Crown Prince returned to Luxembourg to witness the triumphant return of his mother.\n\nTT.RR.HH. the Grand Duchess, Prince Félix and the Crown Prince attend the grand military parade celebrating the first anniversary of the liberation of the Luxembourg capital\n\nA few days after the capitulation of Germany, he was seconded, with the rank of Captain of the Irish Guards, to the allied military mission in Luxembourg. He was sent to Berlin, where he took a particular interest in the fate of deported Luxembourgers and their repatriation. He was appointed Colonel of the newly created Luxembourgish army on 17 July 1945 and later assisted Prince Félix in the general inspection.\n\nPrince Jean was demobilised from the Irish Guards in June 1947.\n\nOfficial portrait of H.R.H. the Crown Prince in the uniform of the Luxembourg army, promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel\n\nOn 21 August 1984, he was promoted to Colonel of the Irish Guards and on 17 March 1995, he was appointed Honorary General of the British Army.\n\nGrand Duke Jean holds a large number of Luxembourgish and foreign honours, including the following military decorations:\n\nLuxembourg Croix de Guerre avec Palme\n\nSilver Star Medal (USA)\n\nFrench Croix de Guerre\n\nBelgian Croix de Guerre 1940 avec Palme\n\nOorlogsherinneringskruis (Netherlands)\n\n1939–1945 Star (UK)\n\nFrance and Germany Star (UK)\n\nDefence Medal (GB)\n\nWar Medal 1939–1945 (GB)\n\nGrand Duke Jean gave an account of his involvement in World War II in an article entitled 'A Colonel's Story', which appeared in the Irish Guards Journal No 58 in 1999.\n\nHe accepted the honorary presidency of the Veterans' Association and the honorary presidency of Unio'n (Union des mouvements de la Résistance luxembourgeoise – Union of the Luxembourgish resistance movements) and also became the honorary president of the Pupilles de la Nation (Wards of the Nation).\n\nMarriage to Princess Joséphine-Charlotte of Belgium\n\nOn 9 April 1953, the Crown Prince married Princess Joséphine-Charlotte of Belgium in the Notre-Dame Cathedral of Luxembourg. The couple settled down in in Betzdorf Castle, where their children Princess Marie-Astrid (1954), Prince Henri (1955), Prince Jean (1957), Princess Margaretha (1957) and Prince Guillaume (1963) were born.\n\nPortrait – Wedding of H.R.H. Prince Jean and Princess Joséphine-Charlotte of Belgium\n\nRead the biography of H.R.H. Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte\n\nAccession to the Throne\n\nFrom 1951 to 1961, the Crown Prince was a member of the Council of State, which enabled him to perfect his knowledge of the political life of the country.\n\nOn 28 April 1961, Grand Duchess Charlotte appointed Prince Jean as Lieutenant-Représentant.\n\nH.R.H. Grand Duchess Charlotte signs the acts of abdication and accession to the Throne of H.R.H. Grand Duke Jean on 14 November 1964\n\nOn 12 November 1964, during a ceremony at the Grand Ducal Palace, Grand Duchess Charlotte signed the declaration of abdication by which she renounced the Crown of the Grand Duchy in favour of her son after 45 years of reign. On the same day, the solemn swearing-in ceremony of Grand Duke Jean took place in the Chamber of Deputies. He declared:\n\n“ My greatest purpose and my noblest duty is to be and to feel that I take on the role of the guarantor of national continuity, around whom political passions are appeased and good will is united and ready to act. ”\n\nOfficial ceremony during the State visit of Queen Elizabeth II to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg\n\nThe Grand Duke and Grand Duchess made numerous State visits, notably to the Vatican (1965), Brazil (1965), United Kingdom (1972), the USSR (1975), Tunisia (1975), Senegal (1977), China (1979) and the United States of America (1984), to mention but a few.\n\nFor Grand Duke Jean, the official visit to the United States in November 1984 was a 'foreign policy event of exceptional significance'. The couple thus contributed to strengthening ties with many countries, also receiving 39 state visits to Luxembourg.\n\nDuring the 36 years of his reign, Grand Duke Jean fulfilled his role as Head of State with dedication.\n\nIn addition to his representative functions abroad, Grand Duke Jean and Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte constantly sought contact with the population in Luxembourg. While the Head of State's duty was to be conscious of the challenges and opportunities facing Luxembourg, Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte was very active in the cultural and social sectors.\n\nGrand Duke Jean was awarded honorary doctorates from the University of Strasbourg and the University of Miami on 22 November 1957 and 6 May 1979. He was also Honorary President of the Luxembourg Olympic and Sports Committee as well as a Member, and after 1998 Honorary Dean, of the International Olympic Committee.\n\nH.M. Emperor Akihito and H.R.H Grand Duke Jean\n\nCommitment to scouting\n\nThe Grand Duke's connection with the scouts movement lasted over 80 years. He was appointed Chief Scout on 28 October 1945, in the aftermath of World War II. A few years earlier, on 12 February 1939, Prince Jean had become Grand Ducal Commissioner of Luxembourgish Scouting.\n\nHe presided over numerous meetings of the LBSA council and participated in many Scout events and activities, including Jubica 82, an international camp that brought together more than 3,300 Scouts from 24 countries and four continents in Betzdorf. In 1995, he was awarded the Bronze Wolf, the highest distinction awarded by the World Scout Committee 'in recognition of outstanding service'.\n\nA few weeks before his death in 2019, Grand Duke Jean made a point of participating in the academic session celebrating the centenary of the Luxembourg Guides and Scouts on 1 March, alongside his son, Grand Duke Henri.\n\nA tribute to the 25-year reign of Grand Duke Jean\n\nOn 13, 14 and 15 November 1989, the Luxembourg population celebrated the 25th anniversary of Grand Duke Jean's accession to the Throne. The ceremony took place on 14 November 1989 in the Chamber of Deputies. Prime Minister Jacques Santer stated that:\n\n'Our Dynasty is one of the pillars of our existence and one of the solid guarantees of the country's sovereignty.'\n\n'The constitutional monarchy that we have freely given ourselves has proved to be a blessing for Luxembourg, since the Family that has been entrusted with this fundamental choice has shown itself, in every respect, to be equal to a task that is noble, of course, but difficult to assume.'\n\nThe reign of Grand Duke Jean was one of the most prosperous periods ever experienced by the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Although his reign may be considered less eventful than that of his mother, Grand Duchess Charlotte, it was marked by the development of unprecedented stability in the political, economic and social spheres. Grand Duke Jean and Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte confirmed the dynasty's fundamental contribution to the unity and stability of Luxembourg.\n\nIn honour of the 25th anniversary of the ascension to the Throne of HRH Grand Duke Jean, the Luxembourg Members of Parliament organise a formal ceremony.\n\nAbdication of Grand Duke Jean\n\nFollowing the example of his mother, Grand Duke Jean appointed his son Henri as Lieutenant-Représentant on 4 March 1998. On 24 December 1999, after almost 36 years of reign, Grand Duke Jean announced his abdication in favour of his son, Prince Henri.\n\nH.R.H. Grand Duke Jean gave a speech on the eve of the abdication ceremony:\n\n“ When I assumed the office of Lieutenant-Représentant in 1961 and that of Grand Duke in 1964, you wished me luck in turning Luxembourg into a modern country, together with you. Together we succeeded. Never before in its history had our country enjoyed the worldwide recognition it enjoys today. Never before has our standard of living been as high and our social security system as efficient as it is today. Never before have so many people worked and lived in our country and never before has our country been so culturally rich. However, all these achievements would not have been possible without our participation in the construction of Europe. ”\n\nH.R.H. Grand Duke Jean delivers a speech on the eve of his abdication\n\nAfter the signing of the abdication decree on 7 October 2000, Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker gave a particularly moving speech paying tribute to HRH Grand Duke Jean and his wife. He said: 'You have had a faultless career' and 'the Grand Duchess has been your most faithful collaborator.' Addressing Grand Duke Jean in particular, the Prime Minister said: 'You are one of us and you have never given us the impression that you are different from us. (…) We have been and remain proud of you.'\n\nRetired life in Fischbach castle\n\nGrand Duke Jean and Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte spent their retirement at Fischbach Castle. However, just five years after Grand Duke Jean's abdication, Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte died after a long illness in 2005 at the age of 77. In the same year, the Philharmonie de Luxembourg was inaugurated with the official name Salle de concerts Grande-Duchesse Joséphine-Charlotte.\n\nFuneral of H.R.H. Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte\n\nEven after his abdication, Grand Duke Jean continued to take part in important events, such as the 70th commemoration of the anniversary of the Normandy Landings on 6 June 2014 in Ouistreham. He was the only one among the Heads of State and former Heads of State present to have fought in the war.\n\nHis 95th birthday was celebrated with great pomp and ceremony; several hundred personalities, representatives of the world of politics, business and culture, and other royal houses attended the gala concert at the Philharmonie in 2016.\n\nGrand Duke Jean also continued to receive guests at Fischbach Castle, such as ministers from the Luxembourg Government, or a delegation from the National Museum of Military History in 2016.\n\nHe was also present at the exchange of views at the Grand Ducal Palace with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in January 2017, and he had no intention of missing the celebration of the centenary in March 2019 of the scout movement in Luxembourg, which has always been very close to his heart.\n\nAs he got older, he no longer travelled very often, except to join the Grand Ducal Family in Cabasson during the summer holidays.\n\nAs a nature lover, the Grand Duke was particularly interested in environmental issues and the protection of flora and fauna. In his retirement, he travelled around the country to visit churches and chapels, to walk in the vineyards along the Moselle and in the forests. His favourite places were the nature reserve in Remerschen, where observing wildlife and especially waterfowl fascinated him, and the Misery Bridge in Esch-sur-Sûre, with its magnificent view of the lake. The Misärsbréck marshland was also a national nature and bird reserve that he enjoyed visiting. He was a keen follower of the Tour de Luxembourg and an avid photographer and painter.\n\nGrand Duke Jean had 21 grandchildren and 20 great-grandchildren.\n\nIn mid-April 2019 he fell ill with pneumonia. He died on 23 April.\n\nFuneral\n\nIn a letter addressed to the people of Luxembourg on 4 May 2019, Grand Duke Henri paid tribute to 'a person of eminently positive character', to his father who 'remained very attentive to his family, despite the heavy burden he carried with wisdom and a great sense of duty'. He spoke of 'the deep love [Grand Duke Jean] had for his country and the great affection he had for his compatriots in their unity and diversity' and that his father 'felt an intense pride in seeing his country's progress over the last few decades'.\n\nThe Government declared ten days of national mourning, culminating in the official funeral on 4 May at Notre-Dame Cathedral of Luxembourg, which was attended by many national and international authorities and members of the royal families from Europe and elsewhere.\n\nThe remains of Grand Duke Jean were carried in a funeral procession from Berg Castle to the Grand Ducal Palace, where they were displayed until the day before the funeral. Thousands of citizens came to say a final farewell to Grand Duke Jean.\n\nGrand Duke Jean in pictures\n\n© Ed Kutter\n\nThe Grand Ducal children in 1934\n\n© Aloyse Anen\n\n1936: The Grand Ducal Family\n\n© Bertogne\n\nPrince Félix, Sir Winston Churchill and Prince Jean in 1946\n\n© Private collection\n\nSkiing holidays in 1947\n\n© Albert Becker / Pol Aschman\n\nPrince Jean and Princess Joséphine-Charlotte in 1953\n\n© Pol Aschman\n\nPrince Jean, Princess Joséphine-Charlotte and Princess Marie-Astrid in 1954\n\n© Pol Aschman\n\n1955: Birth of Prince Henri\n\n© Ed Kutter\n\n1957: Grand Duke Jean and Prince Henri\n\n© Private collection\n\nPrince Jean in Scouts uniform in 1958 at Betzdorf Castle\n\n© Tony Krier\n\nGrand Duke Jean with the twins, Prince Jean and Princess Margaretha, in 1958\n\n© Private collection\n\nGrand Duchess Charlotte surrounded by her children in Cabasson in 1959\n\n© Private collection\n\nGrand Duke Jean with Prince Jean and Prince Henri in 1962\n\n© Paris Match\n\nFamily photo in 1962\n\n© Tony Krier\n\n1967: Family photo at Berg Castle\n\n© Tony Krier / Albert Becker\n\nThe Grand Ducal Family\n\n© Private collection\n\nGrand Duchess Charlotte, Grand Duke Jean, Prince Henri and Princess Maria Teresa\n\n© Jubica FNEL\n\nGrand Duke Jean in 1982\n\n© Private collection\n\nGrand Duke Jean with his dog Bronco\n\n© Jochen Herling\n\nFamily day\n\n© Jochen Herling\n\nGrand Duke Jean and Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte in 1989\n\n© Reginald Davis\n\nThe Grand Ducal Couple, Prince Henri and Princess Maria Teresa\n\n© Luxpress\n\nSt Patrick's Day in 2000\n\n© Private collection\n\nVisit to the exhibition on the life of Grand Duchess Charlotte in 2010\n\n© SIP / Jean-Christophe Verhaegen\n\n95th birthday of HRH Grand Duke Jean\n\n© Guy Wolff\n\nGrand Duke Jean on his terrace at Fischbach Castle\n\nSee also:\n\nTo find out more about H.R.H.
