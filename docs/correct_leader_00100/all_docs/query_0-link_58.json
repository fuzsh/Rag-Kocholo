        "text": "Year 2008 has been marked by several positive events at Bank of China (Luxembourg).\n\nIn the midst of the recent financial turmoil, the Bank has successfully passed a vital test. The Bank increased its capital six fold, and achieved the highest recorded profit since it first set foot in Luxembourg in 1979, whilst maintaining at the same time its traditional policy of prudence, stability and reliability.\n\nAs part of its strategy of strengthening its administrative structure, Bank of China (Luxembourg) S.A. has engaged a new Independent Non-Executive Director Dr. Jacques POOS to join its Board (see the list of members below) which is presently chaired by Mr. HUANG Yangxin. Mr. HUANG Hong, CEO, who is also a member of the Board, will continue to lead the Bank at management¡¯s level.\n\nAt the same time, in order to ensure sufficient prudence and greater efficiency, the Bank improved its services to customers, its IT infrastructure and its risk control management.\n\nRenovation of its office building, located at 37-39 Boulevard Prince Henri L-1724 Luxembourg (Tel. No. +352 466 7911), is also approaching final completion as the Bank welcomes the 30th Anniversary of its presence in the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg. The newly-improved banking hall now offers greater comfort and privacy to customers conducting personal and private banking business at the Bank.\n\nWhile the world economy is experiencing a significant slowdown, Bank of China (Luxembourg) is well prepared to face the new challenges of 2009.\n\nBoard of Directors as at 1st January 2009\n\nMr. HUANG Yangxin (Chairman)\n\nMr. HUANG Hong (CEO & Executive Director)\n\nDr. Jacques POOS (Independent Non-Executive Director)\n\nMr. HONG Xinsheng (Non-Executive Director)\n\nMr. HUANG Yangxin\n\nChairman of the Board of Directors\n\nAs a young graduate from The University of International Business and Economics, Mr. HUANG Yangxin first joined Bank of China in 1976. During the past 33 years of his service at Bank of China, Mr. HUANG Yangxin has acquired vast knowledge and experience in many different banking areas which range from commercial lending, syndicated loans, mortgage loans, international trade finance, trade settlement, correspondent banking, to other areas including legal, audit and human resource. His leadership has not only covered different business areas, but has also spanned through different overseas offices of Bank of China, namely in Beijing, Hong Kong, New York and Panama. At the same time, he continued self-development through different training courses, and further obtained a master degree in financial law from the Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of London.\n\nOver the years, Mr. HUANG Yangxin was also a member of the Chinese Delegation in the negotiation in Paris for China¡¯s joining the International Chamber of Commerce (¡°ICC¡±) and participating in meetings of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, elected as Chairman of ICC China¡¯s Banking Committee, selected by ICC in Paris as Appointed Expert for Documentary Instruments Dispute Resolution Expertise (DOCDEX), and invited as anti-financial crime expert for West District Procurators in Beijing City. Since 1993, Mr. HUANG has been arbitrator of the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission.\n\nToday, Mr. HUANG Yangxin continues to serve Bank of China Limited with his expertise, and it is with great honour that he now also acts as Chairman of the Board of Directors for Bank of China (Luxembourg) S.A.\n\nDr. Jacques POOS\n\nIndependent Non-Executive Director\n\nDr. Jacques POOS first graduated from the University of Lausanne with a doctorate degree in commercial and economic science, and in later years further earned an honorary doctorate degree in law.\n\nAfter his initial professional years working as researcher at STATEC in Luxembourg and as editor-in-chief of newspaper ¡°Tageblatt¡±, Dr. POOS held his first public office as member of the Economic and Social Council in 1966. From there, he pursued his political career, starting from being a Town Council member of the City of Esch, a member of the Parliament, to being Chairman of the Socialist Parliamentary Group (POSL). Over the years, he then acted as Minister of Finance, Minister for Treasury, Minister for Economy, and Minister for Armed Forces. Dr. POOS became Deputy Prime Minister in the governments of both Mr. Jacques SANTER (from 1984 to 1994) and Mr. Jean-Claude JUNCKER (from 1994 to 1999) in charge of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade and Development, thereby making him the longest-serving Foreign Minister in Europe during the late 1990s.\n\nAt European level, Dr. POOS took part in the negotiations of the European Monetary System (EMS) launched in 1979. He also exercised the semi-annual Presidency of the EU Council on three occasions, held twice the Presidency of the Western European Union (WEU) Council, chaired the Council of Europe¡¯s Committee of Ministers, and acted as Luxembourg¡¯s negotiator for three major European Treaties: the Single Act, the Maastricht Treaty and the Treaty of Amsterdam. From 1999 to 2004, he was a member of the European Parliament.\n\nHaving resumed his work in the private sector, Dr. POOS presently holds posts as board member within various companies and organizations of the economic and the financial sectors. It is therefore the distinct privilege of Bank of China (Luxembourg) S.A. to have Dr. POOS acting as an independent non-executive member of its Board of Directors."
