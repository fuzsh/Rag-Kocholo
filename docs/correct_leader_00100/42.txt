(ADW) Happy birthday to former Luxembourg prime minister Jacques Santer who celebrates his 80th birthday on Thursday.

Born in Wasserbillig in 1937, Santer worked his way up the ranks of the country's CSV party and in 1974 became its leader.

It was in 1984 when he became the country's Prime Minister, taking over from Pierre Werner, who retired, and held the position until 1995.

From 1995, Jacques Santer was President of the European Commission until 1999, a move that Jean-Claude Juncker has since simulated.

Since that time, Santer has also been the Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Mudam Foundation, and CLT-UFA. He left both roles in 2016.

The CSV party will organise a reception on Thursday evening in his honour.
