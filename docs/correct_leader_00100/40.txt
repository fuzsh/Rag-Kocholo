The Santer Commission was the European Commission in office between 23 January 1995 and 15 March 1999.

The administration was led by Jacques Santer (former Prime Minister of Luxembourg). The body had 20 members and oversaw the introduction of the euro. It was cut short when the Commission became the first to resign en masse due to allegations of corruption. Some members continued under Manuel Mar√≠n until the Prodi Commission was appointed.
