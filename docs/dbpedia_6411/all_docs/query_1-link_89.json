The beets were enormous, the size of softballs, but she loved the leaves best: sautéed with oil and garlic and finished with ponzu sauce.\n\n“My kids don’t eat them,” she said with a sigh. “But they do eat borscht. They like puréed things. Squeezles!” This, her family’s name for those ubiquitous fruit and veggie pouches."
