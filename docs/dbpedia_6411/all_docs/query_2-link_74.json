        "text": "Danny Masterson’s mugshot has been released as the convicted rapist was transferred to North Kern State Prison in Delano, Calif., on Wednesday, The Post can confirm.\n\nMasterson, 47, shows no emotion in the new snap. His curly hair and beard are also overgrown.\n\nThe “That 70’s Show” alum, is going through the classification and reception process in his new living quarters, which is also where Tory Lanez is serving his 10-year sentence for allegedly shooting fellow rapper Megan Thee Stallion in the feet back in 2020.\n\nIn that same year, Masterson was charged with two counts of forcible rape for sexually assaulting Jen B. and N. Trout in his Hollywood-area home.\n\nHe was sentenced to 30 years behind bars in September and was previously being held at the LA County Men’s Central Jail.\n\nThe Post has contacted a rep for Masterson for comment.\n\nMasterson’s former “70s Show” co-stars Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis faced backlash for writing letters in support of their friend before his sentencing.\n\n“As a friend, Danny has been nothing but a positive influence on me,” Kutcher wrote in a letter obtained by The Post.\n\n“He’s an extraordinarily honest and intentional human being.”\n\nKunis added, “Danny’s role as a husband and father to his daughter has been nothing short of extraordinary. Witnessing his interactions with his daughter has been heartwarming and enlightening.”\n\nThe couple quickly recanted their statements and posted a video on social media acknowledging “the pain that has been caused by the character letters that we wrote on behalf of Danny Masterson” and pledging their support for sexual assault victims.\n\nQuickly after his sentencing, Masterson’s wife, Bijou Phillips, 43, filed for divorce and now has full custody of their daughter, Fianna, 9.\n\n“Ms. Phillips has decided to file for divorce from her husband during this unfortunate time. Her priority remains with her daughter,” her attorney, Peter A. Lauzon, reportedly said in legal docs.\n\n“This period has been unimaginably hard on the marriage and the family. Mr. Masterson was always present for Ms. Phillips during her most difficult times of her life,” the statement continued. “Ms. Phillips acknowledges that Mr. Masterson is a wonderful father to their daughter.”\n\nPhillips claimed she would allow Fianna to visit her incarcerated father throughout his sentence, per the docs.\n\nOn Tuesday, Phillips shared snaps from her “much needed” Caribbean vacation to social media."
