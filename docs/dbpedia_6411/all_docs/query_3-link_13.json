        "text": "Became a father for 1st time, at age 37, when his wife Bijou Phillips gave birth to their daughter, Fianna Frances Masterson, on February 14, 2014.\n\nHe paid $2,995,000 to purchase a 4,323-square-foot house, in Los Angeles' Los Feliz area, that was once owned by rock and roll legend, Chuck Berry.\n\nWhen I was 15, my parents left town for a month. They hid the keys to the car, but I found them. That month, I drove my stepdad's Thunderbird Super Coupe into Manhattan every day, and I would crank Cypress Hill as I flew around the city, racing the taxis.\n\nIf I could make millions of dollars being a softball player, I would quit acting in a second."
