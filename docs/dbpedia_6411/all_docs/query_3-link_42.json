        "text": "After Danny Masterson was charged in 2020 with forcibly raping three women in separate incidents between 2001 and 2003, a verdict was reached on May 31, 2023.\n\nThe That '70s Show actor pleaded not guilty to all three charges in January 2021, and a Los Angeles judge ordered him to stand trial last year. All of the alleged crimes occurred at Masterson's home, prosecutors say, and all three accusers took the stand to detail their allegations in May 2021 in a preliminary hearing.\n\nOn Oct. 19, 2022, Masterson's sexual assault trial began when opening statements were delivered at the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center in downtown Los Angeles, California. Masterson, who has been married to actress and model Bijou Phillips since 2011, is facing a maximum sentence of 30 years to life in state prison, per Deadline.\n\nThree of the alleged victims were Scientologists, a church Masterson has been a part of for years. The Church of Scientology has become a key theme in the case, despite the judge's efforts to keep the focus on the alleged rape. \"This is not going to become a trial on Scientology,\" Judge Charlaine Olmedo said at a pre-trial hearing.\n\nSince Masterson was first accused of sexual assault in 2017, his career in the entertainment industry has been largely impacted. Specifically, Netflix fired him from the series The Ranch and United Talent Agencies cut ties with him after 20 years of representing the actor.\n\nKeep scrolling for a timeline of Masterson's controversies.\n\nMarch 3, 2017: Los Angeles Police Department conducts investigation over three Danny Masterson sexual assault claims\n\nIt was first reported that Masterson was under investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department over sexual assault allegations by journalist Tony Ortega on his blog about Scientology, The Underground Bunker.\n\nThe LAPD's Robbery Homicide Division later confirmed the news in the following statement to PEOPLE: \"The Los Angeles Police Department Robbery Homicide Division, Sexual Assault Section, is conducting an investigation involving the actor Danny Masterson. Three women have come forward and disclosed that they were sexually assaulted by Masterson during the early 2000's.\"\n\nAccording to documents obtained by Ortega, the three women — who were reportedly also Scientologists — claimed that the Church of Scientology pressured them not to contact authorities about their claims. (The Church of Scientology has denied that it pressured victims.)\n\nAccording to one woman's alleged police report obtained by Ortega, she accused Masterson of having sex with or without her consent while she was asleep. A second woman alleged that Masterson \"sexually assaulted the victim while she was passed out,\" per a report obtained by Ortega.\n\nIn a statement to PEOPLE at the time, Masterson's rep refuted the claims. The rep said one alleged incident occurred when the actor was in a six-year relationship with the alleged victim.\n\nNov. 2, 2017: Danny Masterson's fourth sexual assault accuser is reported\n\nIn November 2017, the Huffington Post's Yashar Ali reported that a fourth woman accused Masterson of raping her in the early 2000s.\n\nAccording to Ali, the LAPD began interviewing accusers in late 2016, and police referred the case to the district attorney in April 2017. Ali reported at the time that the investigation had stalled, and that \"despite compelling ― what one law enforcement source described as 'overwhelming' — evidence, the charges have not been approved for filing.\" (A spokesperson for the D.A.'s office declined to comment to Ali at the time.)\n\nNov. 16, 2017: Chrissie Carnell Bixler comes forward as one of Danny Masterson's sexual assault accusers\n\nLater that month, one of Masterson's accusers, Chrissie Carnell Bixler, came forward publicly. She told The Daily Beast at the time that she could \"no longer be silent,\" adding, \"the only way to protect ourselves is to speak.\"\n\nIn her statement, she blasted Netflix for continuing its working relationship with Masterson on the scripted comedy The Ranch, which Masterson co-starred in and co-produced with his former That '70s Show costar Ashton Kutcher.\n\n\"I'm going to be an amazing woman who will NOT shut my mouth when I find out my rapist raped countless other women. I will NOT shut my mouth when Netflix tries to make us feel like we don't matter,\" Bixler said. \"We DO matter. We ARE important. We will see justice for what was done to us, and is continuing to be done to us...and for all those who knew/know and are either actively helping this serial rapist or are choosing to stay silent...YOU don't matter.\"\n\nDec. 4, 2017: One Danny Masterson's accusers reveals that a Netflix executive told her he didn't believe the accusations against the actor\n\nIn December, the Huffington Post reported that a Netflix executive unknowingly told one of Masterson's accusers that higher-ups at the company didn't think the allegations were credible.\n\nNetflix later confirmed to the outlet that Andy Yeatman, then director of global kids content, made those \"careless\" and \"uninformed\" comments, but noted that he was not initially aware that the woman he was speaking to had accused Masterson of rape. Yeatman was later fired.\n\nDec. 5, 2017: Netflix fires Danny Masterson from The Ranch\n\nShortly after, Netflix announced that it had cut ties with Masterson amid mounting pressure over the allegations.\n\n\"After discussing with the producers, we've decided to write Danny Masterson off of The Ranch. Yesterday was his last day of work, and we'll make new episodes in 2018 without him,\" the streaming service said in a statement.\n\nMasterson said in a statement via his rep at the time that he was \"very disappointed\" in Netflix's decision and reiterated his denial of the \"outrageous allegations\" against him.\n\nDec. 20, 2017: Bobette Riales comes forward as one of Danny Masterson's accusers\n\nA month later, actress Bobette Riales — who dated Masterson in the early 2000s — joined Bixler in coming forward.\n\n\"I stayed quiet long enough,\" she tweeted. \"Danny Masterson repeatedly raped me. All I seek is justice and to prevent this from ever happening to anyone else as it has for some time. My truth will be heard. I applaud her strength as well. @ChrissieBixler #metoo #sisters.\" (A rep for Masterson did not respond to PEOPLE's request for comment at the time.)\n\nBixler responded to Riales, tweeting, \"You are amazing. I'm so proud of you. He will never do this to another human being ever again. He's a thief in the night, but he overlooked some incredibly valuable things we still possess. Our voice.\"\n\nJan. 4, 2018: United Talent Agency cuts ties with Danny Masterson\n\nA month after Netflix ousted Masterson, United Talent Agency, a top Hollywood agency, confirmed to the Huffington Post that it no longer represented Masterson. The agency had previously worked with the actor for 20 years, according to the outlet.\n\nAug. 12, 2019: Four accusers sue Danny Masterson and the Church of Scientology\n\nIn August, four women filed a lawsuit against Masterson and the Church of Scientology, alleging they were stalked and intimidated after accusing the actor of raping them in the early 2000s.\n\nIn the complaint obtained by PEOPLE, Bixler, Riales and two anonymous Jane Does accused Masterson and the church of engaging in stalking, physical invasion of privacy and a conspiracy to obstruct justice, among other allegations, claiming they and their families were harassed in an effort to silence them. Bixler's husband was also a plaintiff.\n\nThe four women claimed in the lawsuit that they were systematically stalked and subsequently suffered emotional distress after filing reports with the LAPD. They sought unspecified damages and demanded a trial by jury.\n\n\"This is beyond ridiculous,\" Masterson said in a statement to PEOPLE through his attorney at the time. \"I'm not going to fight my ex-girlfriend in the media like she's been baiting me to do for more than two years. I will beat her in court — and look forward to it because the public will finally be able to learn the truth and see how I've been railroaded by this woman. And once her lawsuit is thrown out, I intend to sue her and the others who jumped on the bandwagon for the damage they caused me and my family.\"\n\nIn a statement at the time, a litigation counsel for the Church of Scientology told PEOPLE: \"From everything we have read in the press, this baseless lawsuit will go nowhere because the claims are ludicrous and a sham. It's a dishonest and hallucinatory publicity stunt. Leah Remini is taking advantage of these people as pawns in her money-making scam.\" (Remini was a member of the church for 35 years before making her split public in 2013. Since she left, she's been an outspoken critic of Scientology.)\n\nJune 17, 2020: Danny Masterson is charged with raping 3 women\n\nThe Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office announced that Masterson had been charged with three counts of rape by force or fear.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Masterson raped a 23-year-old woman sometime in 2001; a 28-year-old woman in April 2003; and a 23-year-old woman between October and December 2003. Deputy District Attorney Reinhold Mueller of the Sex Crimes Division said all of the alleged crimes occurred at Masterson's home.\n\nJune 17, 2020: Danny Masterson is arrested and then released\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, per jail records, Masterson was arrested later that morning. He was released a few hours later after posting bond and was scheduled to be arraigned on Sept. 18.\n\nProsecutors declined to file sexual assault charges against Masterson in two other cases: one for insufficient evidence and the other based upon the statute of limitations for the alleged crime.\n\nIn a statement to PEOPLE, Masterson's attorney Tom Mesereau said, \"Mr. Masterson is innocent, and we're confident that he will be exonerated when all the evidence finally comes to light and witnesses have the opportunity to testify.\"\n\n\"Obviously, Mr. Masterson and his wife are in complete shock considering that these nearly 20-year old allegations are suddenly resulting in charges being filed, but they and their family are comforted knowing that ultimately the truth will come out,\" the statement continued. \"The people who know Mr. Masterson know his character and know the allegations to be false.\"\n\nIn a statement issued via one of their lawyers and obtained by PEOPLE, the women who sued Masterson in 2019 said they were \"thankful that the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office is finally seeking criminal justice against Masterson after a three-year investigation.\"\n\n\"We are confident that the truth will be known and hope that the charges filed today are the first steps in this long journey of healing, justice, and holding those that victimized us accountable,\" the statement continued.\n\nOct. 19, 2020: A Los Angeles judge rules that Danny Masterson's rape case will move forward\n\nIn October 2020, a Los Angeles judge ruled that Masterson's rape case will move forward — rejecting a defense argument that the case should be thrown out because the alleged rapes occurred outside the statute of limitations, reported Variety. According to Deadline, the judge also rejected a move by the defense to keep the media out of the courtroom.\n\n\"Arraignment was continued until November 2 and a judge denied a defense motion,\" a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office told PEOPLE.\n\nMasterson did not attend the hearing, remaining free on $3.3 million bail at the time. Furthermore, he had yet to enter a plea in the case, per Deadline.\n\nNov. 2, 2020: Danny Masterson's arraignment is pushed to 2021\n\nThe That '70s Show actor's attorney, Mesereau, appeared before a Los Angeles judge, who agreed to postpone Masterson's arraignment to Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\"We think this case has already had enough publicity sufficient to prejudice any jury pool that might have to be picked at some point,\" said Mesereau, who asked that media outlets be removed from the courtroom before the hearing, reported New York Daily News.\n\n\"There's been politics behind the case, in our opinion,\" Mesereau said. \"We think it's a politically motivated case.\"\n\nJan. 20, 2021: Danny Masterson pleads not guilty to rape charges\n\nMasterson pleaded not guilty to raping the three women during the early 2000s. The actor's attorney Mesereau entered the plea on behalf of Masterson, who was not present in court, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office confirmed to PEOPLE.\n\nMay 18, 2021: Danny Masterson posts on Instagram from a court house\n\nThe actor shared a smiling selfie with his wife, Phillips, in a now-deleted Instagram post. \"Had the most beautiful Uber driver drop me off at school today,\" he wrote in the caption, tagging his location as \"Court House.\"\n\nMay 18, 2021: The first of Danny Masterson's accusers takes the stand to describe their alleged rape\n\nDuring the preliminary hearing in Los Angeles, one of Masterson's accusers shared an emotional testimony of her alleged rape in court. Per the Associated Press, the woman told the judge that she was drugged at Masterson's house and woke up to the actor raping her 18 years ago.\n\nThe woman tearfully explained that she went to his house to pick up a pair of keys from him on April 25, 2003, but was waylaid and decided to join in on drinks with mutual friends.\n\nShe said that about 20 minutes after she accepted a vodka mixed drink from Masterson, her vision became \"blurry\" and the actor pushed her into a jacuzzi, the outlet reported.\n\nThe woman went on to detail her alleged rape experience after he brought her upstairs, put her in the shower (where she vomitted) and put her on his bed where it happened. She said she was too weak to fight him off.\n\nShe said her memory is only in flashes, but said he pulled her hair and threatened her with a gun after she made attempts to push him off, the outlet reported.\n\nMay 19, 2021: The second of Danny Masterson's accusers delivers testimony to the court about her alleged rape\n\nA day after Masterson's first accuser took the stand, another woman detailed her alleged rape in court. She claimed she was drugged and raped 18 years ago by the actor, five years into their relationship together in November 2001.\n\n\"I tried pushing him off me and saying no I don't want to have sex with you,\" the woman said, per the Associated Press. \"He wouldn't stop. So I did something that I knew would make him angry and likely to get off me. I pulled his hair. He has these rules, 'no touch hair rule,' 'no touch face rule.' He had this thing about his hair, so I knew if I pulled it really, really hard, he would get off me. But what he did was he hit me.\"\n\nThe woman went on to claim that Masterson had raped her while she was unconscious a month later, according to the outlet. Although she reported the alleged incident to the Church of Scientology, she said in court that the officials allegedly told her she was not raped and she did not report the incident to police until 15 years later. Furthermore, the Church of Scientology denied all of the women's allegations.\n\nMay 20, 2021: The third of Danny Masterson's accusers delivers a testimony to the court about her alleged rape\n\nMasterson's third accuser spoke in court on May 20, alleging that the actor demanded she come over to his home one night and later raped her, as reported by AP. When he told her to take her clothes off, she said she listened because \"I didn't want any violence to take place, I didn't want things to escalate. I was giggling, trying to say, 'No, I don't want to.'\"\n\nShe said that she listened to what he asked of her that night partly because of his position of authority he held based on the high level he had reached in the Church of Scientology, the outlet reported.\n\nMay 21, 2021: Los Angeles judge says Danny Masterson must stand trial\n\nFollowing the preliminary hearing, a Los Angeles judge tweeted, \" 'That '70s Show' actor Danny Masterson must stand trial on 3 counts of rape.\"\n\nOct. 11, 2022: Jury selection begins in Danny Masterson case\n\nJury selection began on Oct. 11 for the case of Masterson, who is facing 45 years to life on three charges of rape.
