        "text": "DANNY Masterson, best known for his role as Steven Hyde in That '70s Show, has been moved to a minimum security prison.\n\nMasterson has been transferred from Corcoran State Prison to California's Men's Colony due to concerns for his \"well-being\".\n\nWho is Danny Masterson?\n\nDaniel Peter Masterson is an actor who was born on March 13, 1976, in Albertson, New York.\n\nWhile he might be known for starring alongside Ashton Kutcher on That '70s Show from 1998 to 2006, he has also been seen in Men at Work, The Ranch, and Beethoven's 2nd, among other productions.\n\nOutside of acting, Masterson is known for his religious views and is a follower of Scientology - a religion that was founded in the 1950s by L Ron Hubbard.\n\nOver the years, the religion has been heavily criticized by many around the world, but fellow celebrity followers, including Tom Cruise and John Travolta, have joined the church.\n\nWhat was Danny Masterson convicted of?\n\nOn June 17, 2020, Masterson was charged with raping three women between 2001 and 2003.\n\nAt the time of the alleged attacks, all three women were members of the Scientology church.\n\nMasterson has continuously denied all of the allegations and went to court to fight them in October 2022. After a weeks-long trial, jurors were \"hopelessly deadlocked,\" causing a mistrial.\n\n\"While we are disappointed with the outcome in this trial, we thank the jurors for their service,\" the Los Angeles County District Attorneyâ€™s office said in a statement, via Fox News.\n\n\"We also want to give our heartfelt appreciation to the victims for bravely stepping forward and recounting their harrowing experiences.\"\n\nMasterson was tried again after a judge rejected the defense's motion to dismiss the charges, according to CBS News.\n\nThe jury selection for Masterson's retrial began on April 17, 2023.\n\nDeputy District Attorney Reinhold Mueller said he \"intends to introduce additional evidence at the retrial,\" adding that the court could expect to see new witnesses take the stand.\n\nMasterson faced a sentence of 45 years to life.\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Masterson was found guilty by a jury on two of the three rape counts against him.\n\nOn September 7, Masterson was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison.\n\nA mug shot was also released by the California Department of Corrections, showing Masterson emotionless with unkempt hair and beard as he moved to a new state prison.\n\nHe was moved to Corcoran State Prison, a maximum security prison that once held cult leader Charles Manson, in late January - but has already been transferred out.\n\nMoving Masterson to a minimum security prison was reportedly decided due to concerns over his safety.\n\nAlso in January, a state judge denied Masterson bail over fears that the convicted rapist is a flight risk.\n\nThe actor will be eligible for parole in 2042.\n\nDid Danny Masterson return as Hyde in That '90s Show?\n\nBetween 1998 and 2006, Masterson portrayed the role of Steven Hyde in the popular television series That '70s Show.\n\nIn January 2023, the show was brought back to life with the spin-off sitcom That '90s Show.\n\nThe show brought back many beloved characters, including Red (Kurtwood Smith), Kitty (Debra Jo Rupp), Donna (Laura Prepon), Fez (Wilmer Valderrama), Eric (Topher Grace), Michael (Ashton Kutcher), and Jackie (Mila Kunis), among others, causing fans to question if Masterson would return.\n\nHe was noticeably absent from the show's first 10 episodes when they were released on Netflix on January 19, 2023.\n\nWhile an exact reason was not revealed, many believe that it was due to Masterson's trial.\n\nIs Danny Masterson married?\n\nMasterson married actress, model, and singer Bijou Phillips on October 18, 2011.\n\nPhillips has appeared in several productions, including Almost Famous, Bully, Havoc, and Raising Hope.\n\nPhillips and Masterson welcomed one child, a daughter named Fianna, who was born in February 2014.\n\nOn Tuesday, September 19, 2023, TMZ reported that Phillips had filed for divorce in a California court in a bid to end their marriage.\n\nIt has since emerged that Masterson agreed to give his estranged wife legal and physical custody over their daughter."
