        "text": "A woman testified that she was five years into a relationship with actor Danny Masterson when he began having sex with her while she slept, as he often did.\n\nAttorney Tom Mesereau entered the plea for the 44-year-old actor, who was not in court, to three charges of rape by force or fear. Prosecutors allege that he raped a 23-year-old woman sometime in 2001, a 28-year-old woman in April of 2003, and a 23-year-old woman between October and December of 2003, all at his Hollywood Hills home. Defense lawyer Tom Mesereau entered the plea for Masterson, who was not present in court, to three charges of rape by force or fear in Los Angeles County Superior Court. All of the alleged rapes happened at his Hollywood Hills home. The alleged rapes happened at the height of Masterson’s fame as he starred as Steven Hyde on Fox TV’s retro sitcom “That ’70s Show” from 1998 to 2006 alongside Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis and Topher Grace.\n\nActor Danny Masterson, left, stands with his attorney, Thomas Mesereau as he is arraigned on rape charges at Los Angeles Superior Court, in Los Angeles, Calif. on Friday, Sept. 18, 2020. “There have been repeated attempts to politicize this case,” said Mesereau, who also represented Bill Cosby and Michael Jackson in their sexual misconduct cases. “We want to do anything we can to tone down the cameras and the circus-like atmosphere that have pervaded this case,\" the attorney said. Despite dozens of investigations, most have led to no charges based on lack of evidence or too much time passing. He was removed from the Netflix show “The Ranch” in 2017 over the allegations that would eventually lead to the charges.\n\n(CNN) Actor Danny Masterson, best known for his role on \"That '70s Show,\" was charged with three counts of rape, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey announced Wednesday. Masterson is charged with forcibly raping three women in separate incidents occurring between 2001 and 2003, a press release from the District Attorney's Office said. The people who know Mr. Masterson know his character and know the allegations to be false.\" Authorities say Masterson, who is charged by his full name Daniel Peter Masterson, is accused of raping a 23-year-old woman between January and December 2001. Law enforcement investigated these claims more than 15 years ago and determined them to be without merit,\" Masterson's statement said in the 2017 statement.\n\nFILE - In this March 24, 2014 file photo, actor Danny Masterson arrives at Youth for Human Rights International Celebrity Benefit in Los Angeles. Masterson, known for his roles in \"That '70s Show\" and \"The Ranch,\" has been charged with raping three women, Los Angeles County District Attorney's officials announced Wednesday. (Annie I.
