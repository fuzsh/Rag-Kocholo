        "text": "Neil Masterson Appointed Chief Executive Officer\n\nNew York, NY—April 10, 2024—Vialto Partners, a leader in global mobility, tax and immigration services, today announced a leadership transition to accelerate the next stage of the company’s growth. The Board of Directors has appointed Neil Masterson as Chief Executive Officer and as a member of the Board of Directors, effective immediately. Mr. Masterson brings a wealth of executive and operational experience to Vialto, having most recently served as CEO of OneWeb following over two decades at Thomson Reuters in a variety of positions, including as co-Chief Operating Officer and Chief Transformation Officer. Mr. Masterson succeeds Peter Clarke, who has decided to retire. Mr. Clarke will remain with the company through June 30, 2024, to ensure a smooth transition.\n\n“With Vialto firmly established as an independent company, the Board and Peter have mutually determined that this is the right time for a leadership transition,” said Russell P. Fradin, Vialto Board Director. “Neil is an accomplished and transformational leader in the professional services industry and beyond. His proven track record of building and leading strong, resilient global businesses with best-in-class operations will serve our clients and team members well. The Board is confident that he is the right person to lead Vialto’s next chapter and accelerate the growth of our differentiated, tech-enabled mobility platform.”\n\nMr. Fradin continued, “Peter has provided very strong leadership through Vialto’s evolution over the last two years into an independent company. We thank him for his leadership and contributions that helped position Vialto as the leading independent global mobility leader it is today with a compelling market opportunity and strong client momentum.”\n\nNeil Masterson said, “Vialto’s mission to provide end-to-end global mobility solutions for customers has become ever more important as employers seek integrated and specialized services to navigate a complex global hiring environment. Now we will further capitalize on the strong demand for our services, while optimizing our operating platform to most effectively drive value for our clients and partners. I look forward to collaborating with the talented team at Vialto and leading the company in this next phase of growth.”\n\nPeter Clarke, said, “After a long career with PwC and two years leading Vialto, it is the right time for me to retire and hand over the reins to Neil and our amazing leadership team. It has been an honor and a privilege to lead the dynamic and innovative Vialto team through a complex separation and stand up of Vialto as an independent company. I am confident that under Neil, Vialto will continue its strong track record of delivering differentiated solutions for customers. I wish them and the team continued success.”\n\nAbout Neil Masterson\n\nMr. Masterson is a long-tenured professional with a wealth of executive and operational experience. Mr. Masterson most recently served as CEO of OneWeb, now Eutelsat OneWeb, a broadband satellite internet services provider, from 2020 through 2023. During his time there, he helped build and deploy a space-based global communications network amid a complex geo-political and regulatory environment.\n\nPrior to joining OneWeb, Mr. Masterson spent over two decades at Thomson Reuters, a leading global provider of news and information-based tools to professionals, where he served in a variety of roles including as co-COO and as Chief Transformation Officer.
