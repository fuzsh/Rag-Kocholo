Ahead of his sentencing, several people close to the actor, including his wife, Bijou Phillips, penned letters to Judge Charlaine Olmedo advocating for Masterson’s character. In her letter, Phillips called Masterson an “amazing father” to their daughter Fianna, whom they welcomed in 2014. Phillips isn’t the only person who vouched for her husband to the judge; two of Masterson’s half-siblings and one brother-in-law were among the others who wrote letters of support on his behalf. Weeks after his sentencing, however, Phillips filed for divorce from the actor after 12 years of marriage. Keep scrolling to see all the people on Masterson’s family tree, including those who supported him amid his sexual assault trial:\n\nCredit: Paul Archuleta/FilmMagic/Getty Images\n\nChristopher Masterson\n\nDanny’s younger brother Christopher is also an actor, best known for his role as Francis on Malcolm in the Middle. Like Danny, he is a Scientologist. Christopher was in a relationship with Danny’s That ‘70s Show costar Laura Prepon from 1999 to 2007. He went on to marry actress Yolanda Pecoraro in 2019. The pair share daughter Chiara, born in 2021.\n\nChristopher has not publicly commented on the allegations against his brother or Danny’s conviction.\n\nCredit: Paul Archuleta/FilmMagic/Getty Images\n\nJordan Masterson\n\nJordan is Danny’s half-brother, whom Carol welcomed with her second husband, Australian former rugby player Joe Reaiche, in 1986. Jordan is also an actor, best known for the film The 40-Year-Old Virgin and the television shows Greek and Last Man Standing.\n\nJordan was seen comforting sister-in-law Phillips days after Danny was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison, according to photos obtained by the Daily Mail.\n\nCredit: Unique Nicole/FilmMagic/Getty Images\n\nAlanna Masterson\n\nAlanna is Danny’s half-sister and the second child of Carol and Reaiche. She is an actress best known for her role as Tara on The Walking Dead. She shares daughter Marlowe, born in 2015, with ex-boyfriend Brick Stowell.\n\nBoth Alanna and Jordan are Scientologists and are estranged from their father, who was expelled from the church in 2005 for alleged financial misconduct, which he has denied.\n\nCredit: Amanda Edwards/Getty Images\n\nJoe Reaiche\n\nReaiche met Danny’s mother when they were both involved with the Church of Scientology. The pair tied the knot in 1985 and divorced 10 years later, after welcoming Jordan and Alanna. Reaiche has been estranged from his children and stepchildren since he was expelled from the church in 2005.\n\nThe Australia native slammed his children after Jordan and Alanna penned letters of support requesting leniency in Danny’s September 2023 sentencing. In the letters, the siblings characterized Danny as a father figure who stepped up when Reaiche wasn’t around.\n\n“They make it sound like I walked out and abandoned them and that Danny was the hero,” Reaiche told The Daily Beast in September 2023. “If they had said our parents divorced when we were 9 and 7, that would be one thing. But they say I left like I abandoned them. It’s bulls—t. They perjure themselves.”\n\nHe added that he was “going to have to sue my children, unfortunately,” calling legal action “the only way I can clear my name.”\n\nCredit: Todd Williamson/Getty Images\n\nBijou Phillips\n\nDanny wed Phillips in 2011 and the pair welcomed Fianna in 2014. Phillips was present at Danny’s conviction in May 2023 and at his sentencing that September. According to the Los Angeles Times, the actress “began sobbing” and let out a “pained cry” as the verdict was read.\n\nYears after Danny was accused of sexual assault by multiple women in March 2017, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that Phillips had been “a total rock” for her husband amid the controversy.\n\n“She fully supports him and says they’ll get through this nightmare together and come out stronger,” the insider shared in January 2022.\n\nPhillips ultimately split from Danny in September 2023, filing for divorce just weeks after his sentencing — and her letter to the judge in support of him.\n\nCredit: Allen Berezovsky/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nChynna Phillips\n\nChynna is Bijou’s half-sister, making her Danny’s sister-in-law. Her and Bijou’s father is John Phillips, the lead singer of the Mamas & the Papas, who died at age 65 in 2001. Chynna is a singer and actress and a member of the vocal group Wilson Phillips.\n\nAfter Danny’s sentencing, Chynna shared a message about prayers via her Instagram Story.\n\n“If you don’t feel like Praying, force it. Because something is also forcing you not to pray,” she wrote in a since-deleted post, which was met with mixed reactions in the comments section.\n\n“Yes please force yourself to pray for Danny mastersons victims instead of writing letters on his behalf,” one Instagram user wrote while another commenter said they would be praying for Danny and his family.\n\nChynna’s husband, Billy Baldwin, was among the people who wrote letters to the judge on Danny’s behalf ahead of his sentencing.\n\nBilly, who is the brother of Alec Baldwin, Stephen Baldwin and Daniel Baldwin, wrote in his letter that many people “have told me that [Danny] was there for them in ‘their greatest hour of need’ and ‘the darkest hour of their life.’”\n\nCredit: Jesse Grant/Getty Images\n\nMackenzie Phillips\n\nMackenzie is Bijou’s half-sister, making her Danny’s sister-in-law. She is an actress and singer best known for the film American Graffiti and the television shows One Day at a Time and So Weird.\n\nIn her 2009 memoir High on Arrival, Mackenzie claimed that she had a consensual incestuous relationship with her father, John, that lasted for 10 years.\n\nMackenzie’s half-sister Chynna has publicly said that she believes Mackenzie’s claims about John. “I do know there was a consensual relationship between my father and sister,\" she said during a 2009 ABC interview. \"I've known that for about 12 years.\""
