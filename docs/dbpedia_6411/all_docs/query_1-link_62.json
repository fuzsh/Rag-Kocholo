Like most new world settlers, the Irish initially settled on the eastern shores of the continent but began to move westward with the promise of owning land. The height of this Irish migration came during the Great Potato Famine of the late 1840s. With apparently nothing to lose, Irish people left on ships bound for North America and Australia. Unfortunately a great many of these passengers lost their lives - the only thing many had left - to disease, starvation, and accidents during the long and dangerous journey. Those who did safely arrive in \"the land of opportunities\" were often used for the hard labor of building railroads, coal mines, bridges, and canals. The Irish were critical to the quick development of the infrastructure of the United States and Canada. Passenger and immigration lists indicate that members of the Masterson family came to North America quite early:\n\nMasterson Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nMary Masterson and her husband settled in Plymouth in 1629\n\nMary, Nathaniel, Richard, and Sarah Masterson, who settled in Plymouth 1629\n\nRichard Masterson, who landed in Salem, Massachusetts in 1629 2\n\nElizabeth Masterson, who arrived in Virginia in 1655 2\n\nEliz Masterson, who landed in Virginia in 1658 2\n\nMasterson Settlers in United States in the 19th Century\n\nOwen Masterson, who landed in New York in 1801 2\n\nEdward Masterson, who arrived in New York, NY in 1811 2\n\nAnn Masterson, who landed in New York, NY in 1811 2\n\nHugh Masterson, who landed in New York, NY in 1815 2\n\nCharles Masterson, who landed in New York, NY in 1816 2\n\n...
