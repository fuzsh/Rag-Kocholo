        "text": "Convicted rapist Danny Masterson and his estranged wife, Bijou Phillips, were not living apart for five years prior to her filing for divorce, her attorney confirms to Page Six Saturday.\n\nCourt documents we obtained showed Phillips listed a second address for her and Masterson’s 9-year-old daughter, Fianna, from 2018 to present that specifically noted the child lives solely with her mother in Santa Ynez, Calif.\n\nHowever, Peter Lauzon explains to Page Six exclusively that the reason the “That ’70s Show” alum is not listed as living with his client and Fianna is simply because he is currently not living there “at this moment.”\n\nWhen asked if Masterson was living at the Santa Ynez location until he went to jail, the attorney responds, “Yes, of course he was.”\n\nThe court docs also show Fianna lived with both her mother and father in a Hollywood, Calif., home from 2014 to 2018.\n\nAccording to Zillow, the five-bedroom, four-bathroom Hollywood compound was sold in 2021 for $6.2 million.\n\nReps for Masterson did not immediately return our requests for comment.\n\nPhillips, 43, shockingly filed for divorce from the 47-year-old actor earlier this week, just days after he was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison for rape.\n\nThe mother of one cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split, but did not list a date of separation despite seemingly living apart for years.\n\nShe is seeking spousal support and requested that any financial support for Masterson be denied, per the docs.\n\nPrior to filing for divorce, the “Raising Hope” actress stood by Masterson’s side as he was found guilty of two counts of rape in May.\n\nIt was even recently reported that Phillips — who was photographed looking downcast as she left his sentencing — still believed the “Ranch” star was innocent.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“It is a nightmare, but she will be on his side moving forward and continue to be present for their daughter,” a source claimed just one day after his sentencing.\n\nPhillips even wrote a letter to the judge ahead of the sentencing vouching for his character, calling him an “amazing father.”\n\n“We need him more than you can imagine,” she wrote in the letter. “I know he has been convicted of serious crimes. But the man I married has only been an extraordinary husband to me and a devoted father to our daughter.”\n\nAfter the conviction, a source told People that Phillips was going through a “hard time” but reaffirmed she had no plans to divorce him.\n\nHowever on Tuesday, one day after the filing, her lawyer told TMZ she has decided to file as “her priority remains with her daughter.”\n\nSources then claimed to TMZ that Masterson was not surprised Phillips decided to end their 12-year marriage and knew it was coming.\n\nAnother source told Daily Mail that friends and family had been pushing her to consider divorce to show her daughter that “people need to be held accountable for what they do, even if it’s someone they love.”\n\nThe source added, “Bijou also is doing it to protect her assets and protect her future. She doesn’t want to lose money and land and housing over a future civil lawsuit against Danny.”"
