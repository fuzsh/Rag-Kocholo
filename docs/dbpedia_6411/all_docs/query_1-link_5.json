        "text": "Actor, writer, producer and director Peter Masterson is best known for his adaptation of Larry L. King's \"Playboy\" magazine article \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982)\" into a smash Broadway musical, for which he received two Tony nominations. He also was the screenwriter of the underwhelming 1982 film adaptation that starred Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton. Masterson complained that Reynolds, then in full-superstar status, had tinkered with the character and dialog of the sheriff to make him more like Reynolds' own persona, thus fatally flawing the film.\n\nBefore hitting it big with \"Whorehouse\", Masterson had an unspectacular career as an actor beginning in the mid-1960s and continuing through the mid-'80s, when he shifted his attentions towards directing with The Trip to Bountiful (1985). The film, which was adapted by Masterson's cousin Horton Foote from Foote's own play, was a success, earning Geraldine Page the Academy Award as Best Actress.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Masterson\n\nPeter Masterson (born June 1, 1934) is an American actor, director, producer and writer.\n\nMasterson often worked with his cousin, writer Horton Foote. Acting from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s,including 1975's The Stepford Wives as Walter Eberhart, since then he has concentrated mostly on directing and producing. His daughter is actress Mary Stuart Masterson, who appeared with her father in The Stepford Wives as one of the Eberhart's daughters.\n\nMasterson's most well known and critically recognized work is The Trip to Bountiful. He wrote the books for the hit musical The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas and its short-lived sequel The Best Little Whorehouse Goes Public. His most recent work in film includes Night Game (1989) Lost Junction (2003) and Whiskey School (2005). Masterson has also been responsible for some theatrical disasters including Convicts. Convicts, starring James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall, went straight to video.\n\nMasterson is also an accomplished sailor. In 1989, he won the Silver Medal in World Championships 5.5 metre class in Houston. He won the Silver Medal again for the 5.5 Metre Class in 1990 in Torquay. He won the Silver Medal a third time in the 5.5 Metre Class in 1992 in Nassau."
