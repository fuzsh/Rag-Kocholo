        "text": "Peter's father Patrick does appear to have been married twice.\n\nIt appears he married spinster Margaret Rigney 21/05/1882 at the RC Chapel, Fairview, Drumcondra.\n\nPatrick is stated as a labourer, and his father John is deceased.\n\nHe then married spinster Catherine Costigan on 22/04/1885 at St Laurence O'Toole Church.\n\nPatrick quoted as a Widower, a railway porter, and again his father John is deceased.\n\nIt should be noted, that so far I have not found a potential death for his first wife Margaret between 1882 and this second marriage in 1885. Also there appears to be no issue recorded with the first marriage.\n\nPatrick and Catherine, frequently referred to as Kate, had four children as I have previously posted.\n\nCatherine died 02/11/1898 of cardiac failure at North Dublin Union Workhouse, with the home address quoted as 7 Nixon Street.\n\nPatrick died 06/06/1901, senile phthisis 6 months, at 17 Newfoundland Street, his occupation stated as a gate porter.\n\nThis left the three remaining children, all boys including my Grandfather Peter, to be looked after by Patrick's unmarried sister Mary, who was quoted as 60 in the 1901 census and 75 in the 1911 census!!!.\n\nI have yet to positively find Patrick's and Mary's birth/baptism, as they were born around 1845-1849 to John and as yet an unknown mother. Also, the census states a birthplace as Co Dublin, and as their father John's occupation was a farmer, I cannot be sure of a parish in which they may have been born. Hopefully I will be able to keep digging in the hope that I can try and build on what I already know.\n\nPaul."
