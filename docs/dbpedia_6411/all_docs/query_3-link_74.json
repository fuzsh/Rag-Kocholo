        "text": "Former That ‘70s Show star and convicted rapist Danny Masterson has granted full custody of his child to his wife, Bijou Phillips, after she filed for divorce.\n\nThe 47-year-old actor responded to Phillips’ filing and agreed to give her physical and legal custody of their 9-year-old daughter, Fianna, according to documents obtained by TMZ. Masterson requested visitation with his daughter be granted, which would have to happen under the supervision of prison officials.\n\nRELATED: Actor Bijou Phillips Files for Divorce from Danny Masterson After Rape Convictions\n\nMasterson was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison in September after the actor was found guilty of two counts of rape in May.\n\nPhillips was present at the sentencing and reportedly cried as her now-estranged husband was led out of the courtroom. Days after the September 7 hearing, the Almost Famous actress filed for divorce after nearly 12 years of marriage to Masterson.\n\nWhat did Bijou Phillips ask for in her filing for divorce from Danny Masterson?\n\nIn her divorce filing, Phillips requested full custody of their daughter Fianna, that she receive spousal support and to \"terminate the court's ability to grant support\" to Masterson, People reported, citing court documents.\n\n\"Ms. Phillips has decided to file for divorce from her husband during this unfortunate time,” Phillips’ attorney Peter A. Lauzon told TMZ. “Her priority remains with her daughter.\"\n\nRELATED: Prosecutor in Danny Masterson Rape Trial Says Actor \"Thought He Was Going To Get Away with It\"\n\nHe continued, \"This period has been unimaginably hard on the marriage and the family. Mr. Masterson was always present for Ms. Phillips during her most difficult times of her life. Ms. Phillips acknowledges that Mr. Masterson is a wonderful father to their daughter.\"\n\nPhillips started dating Masterson in 2004 and the couple tied the knot in 2011. They welcomed their daughter in 2014.\n\nPrior to Masterson's sentencing, Phillips wrote a letter to the judge, calling her husband an “amazing father” and adding, “Our daughter and I are heartbroken that he is not home with us.”\n\n“I can say that Danny has literally been a life-saving partner to me,” she wrote.\n\nRELATED: \"That ’70s Show\" Actor Danny Masterson Gets 30 Years to Life in Prison for Rapes of 2 Women\n\nMasterson was charged in 2020 with raping three women he met through the Church of Scientology between 2001 and 2003. The jury failed to reach a verdict on the third rape charge involving the actor’s alleged longtime girlfriend\n\nThe incidents occurred at the height of Masterson’s stardom, while playing Steven Hyde on That ‘70s Show. His most famous co-stars on the show, Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher, were among many who wrote character letters in support of Masterson to the judge during his trial. Kunis and Kutcher, who are married, ended up posting an apology video to Instagram after receiving major backlash from the public for their support letters.\n\nPhillips, the daughter of The Mamas & the Papas frontman John Phillips, was reportedly reprimanded by the judge during Masterson’s conviction when she wept as he was taken away."
