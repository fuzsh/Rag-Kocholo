        "text": "Credit: John Shearer/Getty Images\n\nDanny Masterson’s Sexual Assault Allegations and Case: Everything to Know\n\nDanny Masterson made headlines in 2017 when he was first accused of sexual assault. He has since pleaded not guilty after being charged in June 2020 with allegedly raping three women. Four women claimed in March 2017 that Masterson sexually assaulted them in the early 2000s. A fifth woman came forward in December 2017, claiming that while she was dating the actor, he “repeatedly raped” her. Masterson maintained his innocence and pleaded not guilty in January 2021 to three counts of rape. His first trial began in fall 2022, which ended in a mistrial. Masterson went back on trial in spring 2023 when he was convicted of two counts of rape. The actor was sentenced in September 2023 to 30 years in prison. That same month, his wife Bijou Phillips filed for divorce. Scroll down for more details on Masterson’s sexual assault case, trial and his civil lawsuit: This is an ongoing article that was originally published in January 2022 and last updated in February 2024.\n\nCredit: Kcr/Shutterstock\n\nInitial Allegations\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department confirmed to Us in March 2017 that they were investigating claims that Masterson sexually assaulted multiple women in the early 2000s. No charges had been filed at the time.\n\nThe LAPD’s investigation was prompted by multiple police reports and journalist Tony Ortega’s report of three women’s alleged accounts of rape, sodomy or sexual assault, which he posted on his blog, The Underground Bunker. (Four women were on the record at the time, claiming they were assaulted by the actor.)\n\nIn one of Ortega’s posts, he claimed that one victim approached Leah Remini, who was a Scientologist like Masterson for decades, and told her what allegedly happened. The woman was then advised to file a police report by Remini, according to Ortega.\n\n“I met with the LAPD. I met with Detective Reyes [of the robbery-homicide division, who was assigned the case], and I told her these victims deserve to be heard,” Remini told Ortega at the time. “I asked her to do the right thing by these girls, and I told her that the world is watching.”\n\nThe Dracula 2000 actor’s rep issued a statement denying all claims of sexual assault that same month. “We are aware of [the victim]’s 16-year-old allegations. It was only after [the victim] was in contact with Leah Remini that she made allegations of sexual assault by Mr. Masterson,” the rep said at the time. “The alleged incident occurred in the middle of their six-year relationship, after which she continued to be his longtime girlfriend.”\n\nCredit: Tyler Golden/Netflix/Kobal/Shutterstock\n\nBreaks His Silence on Firing\n\nMasterson reacted to being ousted from The Ranch in December 2017, telling Us in a statement, “I am obviously very disappointed in Netflix’s decision to write my character off of The Ranch.”\n\nHe denied the “outrageous allegations” against him at the time, claiming, “Law enforcement investigated these claims more than 15 years ago and determined them to be without merit. I have never been charged with a crime, let alone convicted of one.”\n\nThe actor said he looked “forward to clearing my name once and for all,” before thanking his former castmates and the show’s crew for the time they spent together. “I wish them nothing but success. I am also so thankful to the fans that have supported me and continue to do so,” he added.\n\nCredit: Eric Charbonneau/Shutterstock\n\nDA Holds Off on Charges\n\nA source at the Los Angeles District Attorney’s office exclusively told Us in February 2018 that despite the “heinous” sexual misconduct claims against Masterson, the DA’s office was not ready to press charges.\n\n“Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey has asked the deputy district attorney Reinhold Mueller, handling the Danny Masterson rape investigation, for further investigation after the case was formally presented to her almost three months ago,” the source explained. “This case is being taken very seriously and does have top priority within the sex crimes division of the office. Not because of Mr. Masterson’s celebrity status, but because of the heinous allegations by the alleged victims.”\n\nThe insider added: “This is a high-profile case, and it needs to be airtight before any decision is made about charging Danny Masterson.”\n\nCredit: Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nChurch of Scientology Sued\n\nFour of the five women who accused Masterson of sexual assault filed a lawsuit against him, the Church of Scientology and the church’s leader, David Miscavige, in August 2019. His exes, Bixler and Riales, were reportedly identified in the lawsuit. The other two women were listed as Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2.\n\nThe accusers claimed that Masterson and the church engaged in stalking, physical invasion of privacy and conspiracy to obstruct justice after the women reported their allegations against the New York native to the Los Angeles Police Department in 2016 and 2017.\n\nMasterson denied the allegations in a statement to Us at the time, saying, “This is beyond ridiculous. I’m not going to fight my ex-girlfriend in the media like she’s been baiting me to do for more than two years. I will beat her in court— and look forward to it because the public will finally be able to learn the truth and see how I’ve been railroaded by this woman.”\n\nA litigation attorney for the Church of Scientology also reacted to the lawsuit, telling Us in a statement, “From everything we have read in the press, this baseless lawsuit will go nowhere because the claims are ludicrous and a sham. It’s a dishonest and hallucinatory publicity stunt.”\n\nCredit: Shutterstock\n\nThe Charges\n\nMasterson was charged with three counts of rape by force or fear, LA DA Jackie Lacey announced in June 2020, three years after he was first accused of sexual assault. The actor was arrested on June 17 and released later that day on $3.3 million bail. His arraignment hearing was set for September of that year and could face up to 45 years to life in a state prison if convicted.\n\nThe District Attorney’s Office declined to file charges for two of the five alleged assaults due to insufficient evidence and statute of limitations. Masterson was, however, accused of sexually assaulting a 23-year-old woman between January and December 2001, a 28-year-old woman in April 2003 and a 23-year-old woman between October and December 2003 in his home.\n\n“Mr. Masterson is innocent, and we’re confident that he will be exonerated when all the evidence finally comes to light and witnesses have the opportunity to testify,” his criminal defense attorney said in a statement to Us after he was charged.\n\nCredit: Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nThe Trial Begins\n\nOpening statements in the trial began in October 2022. Although the defense sought to have any mention of Scientology barred from the proceedings during a pre-trial hearing, the request was denied.\n\n\"Try as Masterson's team might to keep that evidence out, I think it's inevitable that it will become an element in the trial, and the prosecution will likely use this to their benefit to explain the extremely long delay in reporting these allegations to law enforcement,\" Joshua Ritter, a defense attorney and former Los Angeles County prosecutor, said in a statement to Us.\n\nAccording to Deadline, the first of Masterson's three accusers — whose names are not public — testified on October 19. Jane Doe No. 1 alleged that the actor forcibly raped her in 2002 and said that she \"couldn't breathe\" during the assault. \"I went unconscious. When I came to, he was still on top of me,\" she claimed.\n\nCredit:\n\nMistrial\n\nIn November 2022, the jury was unable to come to a unanimous vote on the three charges Masterson faced causing the judge to declare it a mistrial. The case will be retried in April 2023.\n\n“While we are disappointed with the outcome in this trial, we thank the jurors for their service,” a spokesperson for the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office said in a statement to Us at the time. “We also want to give our heartfelt appreciation to the victims for bravely stepping forward and recounting their harrowing experiences. We also are thankful for the hard work of the prosecution team and we will now consider our next steps as it relates to prosecuting this case.”"
