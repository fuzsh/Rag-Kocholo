        "text": "Peter Masterson, who co-wrote and co-directed the bawdy hit Broadway musical “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas” and later directed “The Trip to Bountiful” from a screenplay by Horton Foote, a distant cousin, died on Tuesday at his home in Kinderhook, N.Y. He was 84.\n\nThe actress Mary Stuart Masterson, his daughter, confirmed the death. He had received a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease 14 years ago.\n\nMr. Masterson had played various movie, television and stage roles when he read an article by Larry L. King in a 1974 issue of Playboy magazine about the shuttering of the Chicken Ranch bordello in Texas. When Mr. Masterson called Mr. King to suggest that the article had the makings of a musical, Mr. King laughed.\n\n“It seemed as incongruous as if someone had asked me to assist in open-heart surgery,” Mr. King wrote in The New York Times in 1978.\n\nMr. King’s doubts did not last long. He began collaborating with Mr. Masterson on the book of “The Best Little Whorehouse” while Carol Hall, a friend of both men (who died in October), wrote the songs. In late 1976, they presented several scenes in a workshop at the Actors Studio, of which Mr. Masterson was a longtime member.\n\n“Actors Studio is a tough place to play,” Mr. Masterson said in an interview with The Atlanta Constitution in 1980. “They look at a work like doctors, very clinically. No one laughs or cries. But that wasn’t true with ‘Whorehouse.’ They reacted, laughed a lot, and we knew we had something good right away.”"
