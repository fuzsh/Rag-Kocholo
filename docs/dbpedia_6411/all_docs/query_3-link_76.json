        "text": "üéâ DO NOT SAVE YOUR BUCKET LIST UNTIL YOU ARE ABOUT TO KICK THE BUCKET!!! Use your good china for a grilled cheese sandwich. Wear your favorite clothes to the grocery store. Get your hair, nails done just because. Get that massage after a rough week anyway. Buy it because you deserve it and YOU ARE WORTHY. Throw your favorite holey (insert the blank item here) because you don't have to keep it. Treat yourself as you would treat others. Love yourself completely and give this imperfect human grace from today on. Love to live, not to exist, get by and work hard to just pay bills. All lessons I am learning and trying to incorporate in my life. Disclaimer: the opinions I share are for you to be happy now and not to be taken as legal, financial, or sound advice. P.S. What bucket list, dream, new thing can you do tiday that you were waiting or saving for.a special day? I would love to know and add your inspiration to the list.üôèüèΩ"
