They range in height from 15hh-16.2hh with some ponies available. They are all in well rounded condition and beautifully polished on a daily basis with traditional flowing manes. They are mainly kept stabled and shod all round, and very well mannered.\n\nThey are ridden in traditional deep seated Spanish saddles with soft sheepskin covers and traditional big stirrups. The bridles are mainly curb bits and the horses are ridden loose reined and respond easily to weight shifts and subtle signals. This is a very easy and relaxing style of riding similar to Western, some instruction will be given if wanted.\n\nThe horses are all experienced and sure-footed trail horses with temperaments that vary from quiet and reliable through responsive to fiery and showy. With 35 horses to choose from, riders are sure to find the ideal partner for the week. The riding is mainly at a walk due to varying terrain, but there are plenty (4-6) of opportunities for long and fast canters every day. The guide is not too keen on trotting although this is possible if requested. The riding starts late morning, after 2-3 hours a break for lunch and a siesta, a similar length afternoon ride finishes late afternoon back at the accommodation. All saddling and grooming is provided, but riders are welcome to assist with their own horse.\n\nRider requirements\n\nRiders need to be able to walk, trot and canter. These horses are trained in the Spanish style and are used to being ridden with a loose rein when at walk and a light contact at canter. There are some large and strong horses, so there is a higher than usual weight limit of 105kg. Due to the long rides, it is not suitable for children under 12 and all children should be competent riders. There is no need to saddle or clean the horses unless wishing to. Assistance is available for mounting and dismounting and minimal walking next to the horses is required. Please bring your own riding helmet\n\nWeight Limit\n\nThe weight limit for this ride is 231 lb/105 kg, please enquire if you are an experienced rider exceeding this weight.\n\nThe hotels used en route are all very comfortable with twin or double rooms and en suite shower, toilet, bidet and basin in the bathrooms. They are always located in spots of particular interest and have a local character all of their own. The meals are taken at vineyards, fine restaurants and hotels along the way. The local specialities are based on meat (often lamb or beef), sausages, cheeses and the famous red wineries of Ribero del Duero valley. Everything is fresh and locally produced. The standard of food on this ride is excellent.\n\nUnfortunately vegetarian or other unusual dietary requests cannot be accommodated on this trip.\n\nDocuments - Visa and Consulate Info\n\nPlease note that it is your responsibility to ensure you have the correct documentation in place for your trip.\n\nNB: Be sure to check the COVID status of the country you plan to visit including entry procedures\n\nPassport and Visa requirements can change from year to year depending on diplomatic relations.

The official language is Castilian Spanish but Catalan, Galician and Basque are also spoken. Territory includes two island archipelagos â the Balearics and the Canaries â and two enclaves on the North African coast, bordering Morocco â Ceuta and Melilla. The African influence can be found throughout Spain but especially in the south, for example the guitar was invented by the Spanish when they added a sixth string to the Arab lute. Music and art permeates Spanish culture, most obviously displayed in the fire and passion of the Flamenco and the stunning modern architecture found in the cities.\n\nThe famous siesta is still enjoyed by the majority of Spaniards, most shops close at lunchtime for two or three hours so everyone can escape the often scorching afternoon sun. Evening meals are served late into the evening with plenty of wine or sangria. Often meals can last two or three hours, especially if your host is serving Tapas, small and varied dishes of meats, bread, vegetables. Paella is also a delight and very popular across the country.\n\nSpain is one hour ahead of GMT and they use the metric weights and measures system, so kilometres and kilograms instead of miles and pounds. There is approximately 1.6 kilometres in a mile and 2.2 pounds in a kilogram. The international dialling code for Spain is +34."
