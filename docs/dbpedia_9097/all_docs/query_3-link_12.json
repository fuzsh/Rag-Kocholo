        "text": "Passive bistatic radar analysis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nO'Hagan, Daniel W.; Kuschel, H.; Schiller, Joachim\n\n2009-06-01\n\nPassive Bistatic Radar (PBR) research is at its zenith with several notable PBR systems currently operational, or available for deployment. Such PBRs include the Manastash Ridge Radar (MRR) developed for and by academia; Silent Sentry developed as a commercial concern by Lockheed Martin; and Homeland Alerter (HA100) also a commercial system developed by Thales. However at present, despite the existence of numerous PBR prototypes, take up of commercial passive radar technology remains slow. This is due in part to technology immaturity, in part to politics, and particularly due to the fact that monostatic radars perform so well. If PBRs are to enjoy longevity as a viable technology then it is imperative that they address certain niche application areas, with the aforementioned MRR being one prime example of this. The focus of this paper will be an analysis of a PBR system that utilised FM radio signals of opportunity to detect aircraft targets with an RCS generally not lower than 20 m2. The paper will demonstrate the theoretical detection coverage of an FM based PBR operating in a severe interference environment.\n\nOptimum radars and filters for the passive sphere system\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLuers, J. K.; Soltes, A.\n\n1971-01-01\n\nStudies have been conducted to determine the influence of the tracking radar and data reduction technique on the accuracy of the meteorological measurements made in the 30 to 100 kilometer altitude region by the ROBIN passive falling sphere. A survey of accuracy requirements was made of agencies interested in data from this region of the atmosphere. In light of these requirements, various types of radars were evaluated to determine the tracking system most applicable to the ROBIN, and methods were developed to compute the errors in wind and density that arise from noise errors in the radar supplied data. The effects of launch conditions on the measurements were also examined. Conclusions and recommendations have been made concerning the optimum tracking and data reduction techniques for the ROBIN falling sphere system.\n\nAnalysis on Target Detection and Classification in LTE Based Passive Forward Scattering Radar.\n\nPubMed\n\nRaja Abdullah, Raja Syamsul Azmir; Abdul Aziz, Noor Hafizah; Abdul Rashid, Nur Emileen; Ahmad Salah, Asem; Hashim, Fazirulhisyam\n\n2016-09-29\n\nThe passive bistatic radar (PBR) system can utilize the illuminator of opportunity to enhance radar capability. By utilizing the forward scattering technique and procedure into the specific mode of PBR can provide an improvement in target detection and classification. The system is known as passive Forward Scattering Radar (FSR). The passive FSR system can exploit the peculiar advantage of the enhancement in forward scatter radar cross section (FSRCS) for target detection. Thus, the aim of this paper is to show the feasibility of passive FSR for moving target detection and classification by experimental analysis and results. The signal source is coming from the latest technology of 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) base station. A detailed explanation on the passive FSR receiver circuit, the detection scheme and the classification algorithm are given. In addition, the proposed passive FSR circuit employs the self-mixing technique at the receiver; hence the synchronization signal from the transmitter is not required. The experimental results confirm the passive FSR system's capability for ground target detection and classification. Furthermore, this paper illustrates the first classification result in the passive FSR system. The great potential in the passive FSR system provides a new research area in passive radar that can be used for diverse remote monitoring applications.\n\nAnalysis on Target Detection and Classification in LTE Based Passive Forward Scattering Radar\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRaja Abdullah, Raja Syamsul Azmir; Abdul Aziz, Noor Hafizah; Abdul Rashid, Nur Emileen; Ahmad Salah, Asem; Hashim, Fazirulhisyam\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe passive bistatic radar (PBR) system can utilize the illuminator of opportunity to enhance radar capability.

A passive radar imaging system uses small, mobile receivers that do not radiate any energy. For these reasons, passive imaging systems result in signicant cost, manufacturing, and stealth advantages. The received signals are obtained by multiple airborne receivers collecting scattered waves due to illuminating sources of opportunity such as commercial television, radio, and cell phone towers. We describe a novel forward model and a corresponding ltered-backprojection type image reconstruction method combined with entropy optimization. Our method determines the location and velocity of multiple targets moving at dierent velocities. Furthermore, it can accommodate arbitrary imaging geometries. we present numerical simulations to verify the imaging method.\n\nAutomated target recognition using passive radar and coordinated flight models\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEhrman, Lisa M.; Lanterman, Aaron D.\n\n2003-09-01\n\nRather than emitting pulses, passive radar systems rely on illuminators of opportunity, such as TV and FM radio, to illuminate potential targets. These systems are particularly attractive since they allow receivers to operate without emitting energy, rendering them covert. Many existing passive radar systems estimate the locations and velocities of targets. This paper focuses on adding an automatic target recognition (ATR) component to such systems. Our approach to ATR compares the Radar Cross Section (RCS) of targets detected by a passive radar system to the simulated RCS of known targets. To make the comparison as accurate as possible, the received signal model accounts for aircraft position and orientation, propagation losses, and antenna gain patterns. The estimated positions become inputs for an algorithm that uses a coordinated flight model to compute probable aircraft orientation angles. The Fast Illinois Solver Code (FISC) simulates the RCS of several potential target classes as they execute the estimated maneuvers. The RCS is then scaled by the Advanced Refractive Effects Prediction System (AREPS) code to account for propagation losses that occur as functions of altitude and range. The Numerical Electromagnetic Code (NEC2) computes the antenna gain pattern, so that the RCS can be further scaled. The Rician model compares the RCS of the illuminated aircraft with those of the potential targets. This comparison results in target identification.\n\nGlobal search and rescue - A new concept. [orbital digital radar system with passive reflectors\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSivertson, W. E., Jr.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nA new terrestrial search and rescue concept is defined embodying the use of simple passive radiofreqeuncy reflectors in conjunction with a low earth-orbiting, all-weather, synthetic aperture radar to detect, identify, and position locate earth-bound users in distress. Users include ships, aircraft, small boats, explorers, hikers, etc. Airborne radar tests were conducted to evaluate the basic concept. Both X-band and L-band, dual polarization radars were operated simultaneously. Simple, relatively small, corner-reflector targets were successfully imaged and digital data processing approaches were investigated. Study of the basic concept and evaluation of results obtained from aircraft flight tests indicate an all-weather, day or night, global search and rescue system is feasible.\n\nRadar Versus Stealth: Passive Radar and the Future of U.S. Military Power\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2009-01-01\n\nminimizing, if not nul- lifying , the advantages of the defensive.â3 Douhet did not envision the many sur- face-to-air threats that would evolve over the...is emerging, enabled by advances in networked computing and passive radar technology.

An idea of the proposed solution is based on analytic representation of transmitted direct signals and reflected echo signals. As a spatial filtering subsystem a beamforming network of ULA and UCA dipole configuration dedicated to bistatic radar concept is considered and computationally efficient procedures are presented in details. Finally, exemplary results of the computer simulations of the elaborated virtual simulator are provided and discussed.\n\nClutter isolation and cardiac monitoring using harmonic doppler radar with heterodyne receiver and passive RF tags.\n\nPubMed\n\nSingh, Aditya; Lubecke, Victor\n\n2010-01-01\n\nA harmonic radar employing the use of harmonic passive RF tags can be successfully used to isolate the human respiration from environmental clutter. This paper describes the successful use of heterodyne receiver architecture with Doppler radar to track the heart-rate of a human being using passive body-worn harmonic tags in presence of a controlled noise generator at distances up to 120 cm. The heterodyne system results have been compared with those of a conventional Doppler radar for cardiopulmonary monitoring that fails to isolate the noise from heart-rate in presence of a noise source.\n\nThe Planned Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Mission L-Band Radar/Radiometer Instrument\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSpencer, Michael; Wheeler, Kevin; Chan, Samuel; Piepmeier, Jeffrey; Hudson, Derek; Medeiros, James\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission is a NASA mission identified by the NRC 'decadal survey' to measure both soil moisture and freeze/thaw state from space. The mission will use both active radar and passive radiometer instruments at L-Band. In order to achieve a wide swath at sufficiently high resolution for both active and passive channels, an instrument architecture that uses a large rotating reflector is employed. The instrument system has completed the preliminary design review (PDR) stage, and detailed instrument design has begun. In addition to providing an overview of the instrument design, two recent design modifications are discussed: 1) The addition of active thermal control to the instrument spun side to provide a more stable, settable thermal environment for the radiometer electronics, and 2) A 'sequential transmit' strategy for the two radar polarization channels which allows a single high-power amplifier to be used.\n\nStudy to investigate and evaluate means of optimizing the radar function. [systems engineering of pulse radar for the space shuttle\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1975-01-01\n\nThe investigations for a rendezvous radar system design and an integrated radar/communication system design are presented. Based on these investigations, system block diagrams are given and system parameters are optimized for the noncoherent pulse and coherent pulse Doppler radar modulation types. Both cooperative (transponder) and passive radar operation are examined including the optimization of the corresponding transponder design for the cooperative mode of operation.\n\nAn algorithm for automatic target recognition using passive radar and an EKF for estimating aircraft orientation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEhrman, Lisa M.\n\n2005-07-01\n\nRather than emitting pulses, passive radar systems rely on \"illuminators of opportunity,\" such as TV and FM radio, to illuminate potential targets. These systems are attractive since they allow receivers to operate without emitting energy, rendering them covert. Until recently, most of the research regarding passive radar has focused on detecting and tracking targets. This dissertation focuses on extending the capabilities of passive radar systems to include automatic target recognition. The target recognition algorithm described in this dissertation uses the radar cross section (RCS) of potential targets, collected over a short period of time, as the key information for target recognition. To make the simulated RCS as accurate as possible, the received signal model accounts for aircraft position and orientation, propagation losses, and antenna gain patterns. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) estimates the target's orientation (and uncertainty in the estimate) from velocity measurements obtained from the passive radar tracker. Coupling the aircraft orientation and state with the known antenna locations permits computation of the incident and observed azimuth and elevation angles. The Fast Illinois Solver Code (FISC) simulates the RCS of potential target classes as a function of these angles. Thus, the approximated incident and observed angles allow the appropriate RCS to be extracted from a database of FISC results. Using this process, the RCS of each aircraft in the target class is simulated as though each is executing the same maneuver as the target detected by the system. Two additional scaling processes are required to transform the RCS into a power profile (magnitude only) simulating the signal in the receiver. First, the RCS is scaled by the Advanced Refractive Effects Prediction System (AREPS) code to account for propagation losses that occur as functions of altitude and range. Then, the Numerical Electromagnetic Code (NEC2) computes the antenna gain pattern\n\nPassive Bistatic Radar and Waveform Diversity\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2009-11-01\n\ntransmission, but these are significantly beyond the detection ranges of interest.

It is also an attractive addition to existing active radar stations because it has the potential to discover low-flying and low-observable targets. The CORA (Covert Radar) experimental passive radar system currently developed at Fraunhofer-FHR features a multi-channel digital radar receiver and a circular antenna array with separate elements for the VHF- and the UHF-range and is used to exploit alternatively Digital Audio (DAB) or Video Broadcasting (DVB-T) signals. For an extension of the system, a wideband antenna array is being designed for which a new discone antenna element has been developed covering the full DVB-T frequency range. The present paper describes the outline of the system and the numerical modelling and optimisation methods applied to solve the complex task of antenna array design: Electromagnetic full wave analysis is required for the parametric design of the antenna elements while combinatorial optimization methods are applied to find the best array positions and excitation coefficients for a regular omni-directional antenna performance. The different steps are combined in an iterative loop until the optimum array layout is found. Simulation and experimental results for the current system will be shown.\n\nMethods And System Suppressing Clutter In A Gain-Block, Radar-Responsive Tag System\n\nDOEpatents\n\nOrmesher, Richard C.; Axline, Robert M.\n\n2006-04-18\n\nMethods and systems reduce clutter interference in a radar-responsive tag system. A radar transmits a series of linear-frequency-modulated pulses and receives echo pulses from nearby terrain and from radar-responsive tags that may be in the imaged scene. Tags in the vicinity of the radar are activated by the radar's pulses. The tags receive and remodulate the radar pulses. Tag processing reverses the direction, in time, of the received waveform's linear frequency modulation. The tag retransmits the remodulated pulses. The radar uses a reversed-chirp de-ramp pulse to process the tag's echo. The invention applies to radar systems compatible with coherent gain-block tags. The invention provides a marked reduction in the strength of residual clutter echoes on each and every echo pulse received by the radar. SAR receiver processing effectively whitens passive-clutter signatures across the range dimension. Clutter suppression of approximately 14 dB is achievable for a typical radar system.\n\nThe Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP): Radar Measurements at High Latitudes and of Freeze/Thaw State\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSpencer, Michael; Dunbar, Scott; Chen, Curtis\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission is scheduled for a late 2014 launch date. The mission will use both active radar and passive radiometer instruments at L-Band. In order to achieve a wide swath at sufficiently high resolution for both active and passive channels, an instrument architecture that uses a large rotating reflector is employed. In this paper, a focus will be places on the radar design and associated data products at high latitudes. The radar will employ synthetic-aperture processing to achieve a \"moderate\" resolution dual-pol product over a 1000 km swath. Because the radar is operating continuously, very frequent temporal coverage will be achieved at high latitudes. This data will be used, among other things, to produce a surface freeze/thaw state data product.\n\nThe 4-8 GHz Microwave Active and Passive Spectrometer (MAPS). Volume 1: Radar section\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nUlaby, F. T.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nThe performance characteristics of the radar section of the prototype 4-8 GHz Microwave Active and Passive Spectrometer system are reported. Active and passive spectral responses were measured of natural, cultivated, and human-made surfaces over the 4-18 GHz region of frequencies for look angles between zero and 70 degrees and for all possible linear polarization combinations. Soil and plant samples were collected to measure their dielectric properties and moisture content. The FORTRAN program for area calculation is provided.\n\nJoint Optimization of Receiver Placement and Illuminator Selection for a Multiband Passive Radar Network.\n\nPubMed\n\nXie, Rui; Wan, Xianrong; Hong, Sheng; Yi, Jianxin\n\n2017-06-14\n\nThe performance of a passive radar network can be greatly improved by an optimal radar network structure. Generally, radar network structure optimization consists of two aspects, namely the placement of receivers in suitable places and selection of appropriate illuminators. The present study investigates issues concerning the joint optimization of receiver placement and illuminator selection for a passive radar network. Firstly, the required radar cross section (RCS) for target detection is chosen as the performance metric, and the joint optimization model boils down to the partition p -center problem (PPCP). The PPCP is then solved by a proposed bisection algorithm. The key of the bisection algorithm lies in solving the partition set covering problem (PSCP), which can be solved by a hybrid algorithm developed by coupling the convex optimization with the greedy dropping algorithm. In the end, the performance of the proposed algorithm is validated via numerical simulations.\n\nInfluence of RF channels mismatch and mutual coupling phenomenon on performance of a multistatic passive radar\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHossa, Robert; GÃ³rski, Maksymilian\n\n2010-09-01\n\nIn the paper we analyze the influence of RF channels mismatch and mutual coupling effect on the performance of the multistatic passive radar with Uniform Circular Array (UCA) configuration. The problem was tested intensively in numerous different scenarios with a reference virtual multistatic passive radar. Finally, exemplary results of the computer software simulations are provided and discussed.\n\nMulti-Frequency Radar/Passive Microwave retrievals of Cold Season Precipitation from OLYMPEX data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTridon, Frederic; Battaglia, Alessandro; Turk, Joe; Tanelli, Simone; Kneifel, Stefan; Leinonen, Jussi; Kollias, Pavlos\n\n2017-04-01\n\nDue to the large natural variability of its microphysical properties, the characterization of solid precipitation over the variety of Earth surface conditions remain a longstanding open issue for space-based radar and passive microwave (MW) observing systems, such those on board the current NASA-JAXA Global Precipitation measurement (GPM) core and constellation satellites. Observations from the NASA DC-8 including radar profiles from the triple frequency Advanced Precipitation Radar (APR-3) and brightness temperatures from PMW radiometers with frequencies ranging from 89 to 183 GHz were collected during November-December 2015 as part of the OLYMPEX-RADEX campaign in western Washington state. Observations cover orographically-driven precipitation events with flight transects over ocean, coastal areas, vegetated and snow-covered surfaces. This study presents results obtained by a retrieval optimal estimation technique capable of combining the various radar and radiometer measurements in order to retrieve the snow properties such as equivalent water mass and characteristic size. The retrieval is constrained by microphysical a-priori defined by in situ measurements whilst the most recent ice scattering models are used in the forward modelling. The vast dataset collected during OLYMPEX is particular valuable because it can provide very strong tests for the fidelity of ice scattering models deep in the non-Rayleigh regime. In addition, the various scattering tables of snow aggregates with different degrees of riming can be exploited to assess the potential of multi-wavelength active and passive microwave systems in identifying the primary ice growth process (i.e. aggregation vs riming vs deposition). First comparisons with in-situ observations from the coordinated flights of the Citation aircraft will also be presented.\n\nMethod of remote powering and detecting multiple UWB passive tags in an RFID system\n\nDOEpatents\n\nDowla, Farid U [Castro Valley, CA; Nekoogar, Faranak [San Ramon, CA; Benzel, David M [Livermore, CA; Dallum, Gregory E [Livermore, CA; Spiridon, Alex [Palo Alto, CA\n\n2012-05-29\n\nA new Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), tracking, powering apparatus/system and method using coded Ultra-wideband (UWB) signaling is introduced. The proposed hardware and techniques disclosed herein utilize a plurality of passive UWB transponders in a field of an RFID-radar system. The radar system itself enables multiple passive tags to be remotely powered (activated) at about the same time frame via predetermined frequency UWB pulsed formats. Once such tags are in an activated state, an UWB radar transmits specific \"interrogating codes\" to put predetermined tags in an awakened status. Such predetermined tags can then communicate by a unique \"response code\" so as to be detected by an UWB system using radar methods.\n\nThe Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Radar: Measurements at High Latitudes and of Surface Freeze/Thaw State\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSpencer, Michael; Dunbar, Scott; Chen, Curtis\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission is scheduled for a late 2014 launch date. The mission will use both active radar and passive radiometer instruments at L-Band in order to achieve the science objectives of measuring soil moisture and land surface freeze-thaw state. To achieve requirements for a wide swath at sufficiently high resolution for both active and passive channels, an instrument architecture that uses a large rotating reflector is employed. In this paper, focus will be placed on the radar design. The radar will employ synthetic-aperture processing to achieve a \"moderate\" resolution dual-pol product over a 1000 km swath. Because the radar is operating continuously, very frequent temporal coverage will be achieved at high latitudes. This data will be used to produce a surface freeze/thaw state data product.\n\nHigh Bandwidth, Multi-Purpose Passive Radar Receiver Design For Aerospace and Geoscience Targets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVertatschitsch, Laura\n\nuninterruptible power supply (UPS) for up to 1 hour of continuous operation. In this document we provide technical details of the hardware, firmware, and software of the system and design strategies and decisions. We cover the topic of coherent processing for passive radar, specifically an overview of the cross-ambiguity function as a detection mechanism. While the applications of a system like this are incredibly broad, the initial validation and performance analysis was applied specifically to detection of aircraft using Digital Television (DTV) broadcast as an illuminator. We present results of both stationary and mobile operation. In stationary operation, the same helicopter has been detected using two different DTV transmissions. Early mobile operation results show the Doppler-spread ground clutter and possible detection of aircraft. In addition to the fully-functional aircraft detection signal chain, alternative FPGA designs are presented with modes for fast sampling on two antennas or four antennas, with access to an aggregate 240 MHz of spectrum, with 8-bit samples. At these extremely high data rates, moderate data loss occurs while saving this data to disk, but as detailed within this document, it can be accounted for and the effects minimalized, still allowing for detection of aircraft. With these modes, FM transmission and DTV transmission can be captured synchronously from a single antenna and digitizer feed, an exciting result that offers promise for both aerospace and geoscience applications.\n\nTowards a Radar/Radiometer Mode on the Dual-Frequency, Dual-Polarized, Doppler Radar (D3R) System\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nVega, Manuel A.; Chandrasekar, V.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe dual-Â­frequency, dual-Â­polarized, Doppler radar (D3R) system was developed in support of the ground validation segment of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission. Although its main purpose is to provide active, Ku/KaÂ­-band, dualÂ­-polarized measurements of precipitation, the design presents an opportunity to study its operation in an active/passive mode. The opportunity arises from use of solid-Â­state transmitters employing a multiÂ­-frequency waveform and receiving system. Typically, a sequence of three pulses separated in frequency is transmitted to achieve its radar sensitivity and minimum range. However, one of the three pulses can be disabled with a tolerable decrease in sensitivity and its receive channel can be repurposed to support passive measurements. This work focuses on progress in the characterization of the Ku-Â­band H polarized passive channel operating simultaneously with two active as a step towards the provision of brightness temperatures along with the other radar derived products. The methodology developed will be applied to the V polarized channel and KaÂ­-band subsystem in the near future. The study consists on the analysis of the antenna performance, receiver architecture, transfer function and achievable number of independent samples, calibration method and preliminary observation analysis. All within the context of the instrument's current configuration and possible future improvements.\n\nMultitarget tracking in cluttered environment for a multistatic passive radar system under the DAB/DVB network\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShi, Yi Fang; Park, Seung Hyo; Song, Taek Lyul\n\n2017-12-01\n\nperformed to verify the superiority of the proposed SP-JIPDA algorithm over the MJIPDA in this multistatic passive radar system.\n\nRange resolution improvement in passive bistatic radars using nested FM channels and least squares approach\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nArslan, Musa T.; Tofighi, Mohammad; Sevimli, Rasim A.; Äetin, Ahmet E.\n\n2015-05-01\n\nOne of the main disadvantages of using commercial broadcasts in a Passive Bistatic Radar (PBR) system is the range resolution. Using multiple broadcast channels to improve the radar performance is offered as a solution to this problem. However, it suffers from detection performance due to the side-lobes that matched filter creates for using multiple channels. In this article, we introduce a deconvolution algorithm to suppress the side-lobes. The two-dimensional matched filter output of a PBR is further analyzed as a deconvolution problem. The deconvolution algorithm is based on making successive projections onto the hyperplanes representing the time delay of a target. Resulting iterative deconvolution algorithm is globally convergent because all constraint sets are closed and convex. Simulation results in an FM based PBR system are presented.\n\nA convenient technique for polarimetric calibration of single-antenna radar systems\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSarabandi, Kamal; Ulaby, Fawwaz T.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nA practical technique for calibrating single-antenna polarimetric radar systems is introduced. This technique requires only a single calibration target such as a conducting sphere or a trihedral corner reflector to calibrate the radar system, both in amplitude and phase, for all linear polarization configurations. By using a metal sphere, which is orientation independent, error in calibration measurement is minimized while simultaneously calibrating the crosspolarization channels. The antenna system and two orthogonal channels (in free space) are modeled as a four-port passive network. Upon using the reciprocity relations for the passive network and assuming the crosscoupling terms of the antenna to be equal, the crosstalk factors of the antenna system and the transmit and receive channel imbalances can be obtained from measurement of the backscatter from a metal sphere. For an X-band radar system with crosspolarization isolation of 25 dB, comparison of values measured for a sphere and a cylinder with theoretical values shows agreement within 0.4 dB in magnitude and 5 deg in phase. An effective polarization isolation of 50 dB is achieved using this calibration technique.\n\nTime-to-impact estimation in passive missile warning systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nÅahÄ±ngÄ±l, Mehmet Cihan\n\n2017-05-01\n\nA missile warning system can detect the incoming missile threat(s) and automatically cue the other Electronic Attack (EA) systems in the suit, such as Directed Infrared Counter Measure (DIRCM) system and/or Counter Measure Dispensing System (CMDS). Most missile warning systems are currently based on passive sensor technology operating in either Solar Blind Ultraviolet (SBUV) or Midwave Infrared (MWIR) bands on which there is an intensive emission from the exhaust plume of the threatening missile. Although passive missile warning systems have some clear advantages over pulse-Doppler radar (PDR) based active missile warning systems, they show poorer performance in terms of time-to-impact (TTI) estimation which is critical for optimizing the countermeasures and also \"passive kill assessment\". In this paper, we consider this problem, namely, TTI estimation from passive measurements and present a TTI estimation scheme which can be used in passive missile warning systems. Our problem formulation is based on Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The algorithm uses the area parameter of the threat plume which is derived from the used image frame.\n\nPerformance Analysis for Joint Target Parameter Estimation in UMTS-Based Passive Multistatic Radar with Antenna Arrays Using Modified CramÃ©r-Rao Lower Bounds\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Fei; Salous, Sana; Zhou, Jianjiang\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn this study, the modified CramÃ©r-Rao lower bounds (MCRLBs) on the joint estimation of target position and velocity is investigated for a universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS)-based passive multistatic radar system with antenna arrays. First, we analyze the log-likelihood redfunction of the received signal for a complex Gaussian extended target. Then, due to the non-deterministic transmitted data symbols, the analytically closed-form expressions of the MCRLBs on the Cartesian coordinates of target position and velocity are derived for a multistatic radar system with Nt UMTS-based transmit station of Lt antenna elements and Nr receive stations of Lr antenna elements. With the aid of numerical simulations, it is shown that increasing the number of receiving elements in each receive station can reduce the estimation errors. In addition, it is demonstrated that the MCRLB is not only a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the number of receiving antenna elements and the properties of the transmitted UMTS signals, but also a function of the relative geometric configuration between the target and the multistatic radar system.The analytical expressions for MCRLB will open up a new dimension for passive multistatic radar system by aiding the optimal placement of receive stations to improve the target parameter estimation performance.

The Ku-band radar system is designed to search for a target in a designated or undesignated mode, then track the detected target, which might be cooperative (active) or passive, providing accurate, estimates of the target range, range rate, angle and angle rate to enable the orbiter to rendezvous with this target. The radar mode is described along with a summary of its predicted performance. The principal sub-unit that implements the radar function is the electronics assembly 2(EA-2). The relationship of EA-2 to the remainder of the Ku-band system is shown. A block diagram of EA-2 is presented including the main command and status signals between EA-2 and the other Ku-band units.\n\nPredictability of GNSS signal observations in support of Space Situational Awareness using passive radar\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMahmud, M. S.; Lambert, A.; Benson, C.\n\n2015-07-01\n\nGNSS signals have been proposed as emitters of opportunity to enhance Space Situational Awareness (SSA) by tracking small items of space debris using bistatic radar. Although the scattered GNSS signal levels from small items of space debris are incredibly low, the dynamic disturbances of the observed object are very small, and the phase of the scattered signals is well behaved. It is therefore plausible that coherent integration periods on the order of many minutes could be achieved. However, even with long integration periods, very large receiver arrays with extensive, but probably viable, processing are required to recover the scattered signal. Such large arrays will be expensive, and smaller more affordable arrays will collect insufficient signal power to detect the small objects (relative to wavelength) that are necessary to maintain the necessary phase coherency. The investments necessary to build a large receiver array are unlikely without substantial risk reduction. Pini and Akos have previously reported on use of very large radio telescopes to analyse the short-term modulation performance of GNSS satellite signals. In this work we report on tracking of GPS satellites with a radio-astronomy VLBI antenna system to assess the stability of the observed GPS signal over a time period indicative of that proposed for passive radar. We also confirm some of the processing techniques that may be used in both demonstrations and the final system. We conclude from the limited data set that the signal stability when observed by a high-gain tracking antenna and compared against a high quality, low phase-noise clock is excellent, as expected. We conclude by framing further works to reduce risk for a passive radar SSA capability using GNSS signals. http://www.ignss.org/Conferences/PastConferencePapers/2015ConferencePastPapers/2015PeerReviewedPapers/tabid/147/Default.aspx\n\nPerformance Analysis for Joint Target Parameter Estimation in UMTS-Based Passive Multistatic Radar with Antenna Arrays Using Modified CramÃ©r-Rao Lower Bounds.\n\nPubMed\n\nShi, Chenguang; Wang, Fei; Salous, Sana; Zhou, Jianjiang\n\n2017-10-18\n\nIn this study, the modified CramÃ©r-Rao lower bounds (MCRLBs) on the joint estimation of target position and velocity is investigated for a universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS)-based passive multistatic radar system with antenna arrays.

Distributed micro-radar system is the next step in the development of passive monopulse direction finder proposed by Stephen E. Lipsky in the 80s. To extend high frequency limit and provide high sensitivity over the broadband of frequencies, multiple angularly spaced directional antennas are coupled with front end circuits and separately connected to a direction finder processor by a digital interface. Integration of antennas with front end circuits allows to exclude waveguide lines which limits system bandwidth and creates frequency dependent phase errors. Digitizing of received signals proximate to antennas allows loose distribution of antennas and dramatically decrease phase errors connected with waveguides. Accuracy of direction finding in proposed micro-radar in this case will be determined by time accuracy of digital processor and sampling frequency. Multi-band, multi-functional antennas can be distributed around the perimeter of a Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) and connected to the processor by digital interface or can be distributed between swarm/formation of mini/micro UAS and connected wirelessly. Expendable micro-radars can be distributed by perimeter of defense object and create multi-static radar network. Low-profile, lowaltitude, high speed targets, like small projectiles, create a Doppler shift in a narrow frequency band. This signal can be effectively filtrated and detected with high probability. Proposed micro-radar can work in passive, monostatic or bistatic regime.\n\nEquatorial radar system\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRukao, S.; Tsuda, T.; Sato, T.; Kato, S.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nA large clear air radar with the sensitivity of an incoherent scatter radar for observing the whole equatorial atmosphere up to 1000 km altitude is now being designed in Japan. The radar, called the Equatorial Radar, will be built in Pontianak, Kalimantan Island, Indonesia (0.03 N, 109.3 E). The system is a 47 MHz monostatic Doppler radar with an active phased array configuration similar to that of the MU radar in Japan, which has been in successful operation since 1983. It will have a PA product of more than 5 x 10(9) sq. Wm (P = average transmitter power, A = effective antenna aperture) with sensitivity more than 10 times that of the MU radar. This system configuration enables pulse-to-pulse beam steering within 25 deg from the zenith. As is the case of the MU radar, a variety of sophisticated operations will be made feasible under the supervision of the radar controller. A brief description of the system configuration is presented.\n\nInvestigating nearby exoplanets via interstellar radar\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nScheffer, Louis K.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nInterstellar radar is a potential intermediate step between passive observation of exoplanets and interstellar exploratory missions. Compared with passive observation, it has the traditional advantages of radar astronomy. It can measure surface characteristics, determine spin rates and axes, provide extremely accurate ranges, construct maps of planets, distinguish liquid from solid surfaces, find rings and moons, and penetrate clouds. It can do this even for planets close to the parent star. Compared with interstellar travel or probes, it also offers significant advantages. The technology required to build such a radar already exists, radar can return results within a human lifetime, and a single facility can investigate thousands of planetary systems. The cost, although too high for current implementation, is within the reach of Earth's economy.\n\nENSO Precipitation Variations as Seen by GPM and TRMM Radar and Passive Microwave Observations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAdler, R. F.; Wang, J. J.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nTropical precipitation variations related to ENSO are the largest-scale such variations both spatially and in magnitude and are also the main driver of surface temperature-surface rainfall relationships on the inter-annual scale. GPM (and TRMM before it) provide a unique capability to examine these relations with both the passive and active microwave approaches. Documenting the phase and magnitudes of these relationships are important to understand these large-scale processes and to validate climate models. However, as past research by the authors have shown, the results of these relations have been different for passive vs. radar retrievals. In this study we re-examine these relations with the new GPM Version 5 products, focusing on the 2015-2016 El Nino event. The recent El Nino peaked in Dec. 2015 through Feb. 2016 with the usual patterns of precipitation anomalies across the Tropics as evident in both the GPM GMI and the Near Surface (NS) DPR (single frequency) retrievals. Integrating both the rainfall anomalies and the SST anomalies over the entire tropical ocean area (25N-25S) and comparing how they vary as a function of time on a monthly scale during the GPM era (2014-2017), the radar-based results show contrasting results to those from the GMI-based (and GPCP) results. The passive microwave data (GMI and GPCP) indicates a slope of 17%/C for the precipitation variations, while the radar NS indicates about half that ( 8%/C). This NS slope is somewhat less than calculated before with GPM's V4 data, but is larger than obtained with TRMM PR data ( 0%/C) for an earlier period during the TRMM era. Very similar results as to the DPR NS calculations are also obtained for rainfall at 2km and 4km altitude and for the Combined (DPR + GMI) product. However, at 6km altitude, although the reflectivity and rainfall magnitudes are much less than at lower altitudes, the slope of the rainfall/SST relation is 17%/C, the same as calculated with the passive microwave data.

Radar systems exploit the non-invasive interaction between the matter and the electromagnetic waves at microwave frequencies. Such an interaction allows obtaining images of the region under test from which one can infer the presence of potential anomalies such as deformations, cracks, water infiltrations, etc. This information turns out to be of primary importance in practical scenarios where the probed structure is in a poor state of preservation and renovation works must be planned. In this framework, the aim of this contribution is to describe the potentialities of the holographic radar Rascan 4/4000, a holographic radar developed by Remote Sensing Laboratory of Bauman Moscow State Technical University, as a non-destructive diagnostic tool capable to provide, in real-time, high resolution subsurface images of the sounded structure [1]. This radar provides holograms of hidden anomalies from the amplitude of the interference signal arising between the backscattered signal and a reference signal. The performance of the holographic radar is appraised by means of several experiments. Preliminary tests concerning the imaging below the floor and inside wood structures are carried out in controlled conditions at the Electromagnetic Diagnostic Laboratory of IREA-CNR. After, with reference to bridge monitoring for security aim, the results of a measurement campaign performed on the Musmeci bridge are presented [2].

Lipsky in the 80s. In the proposed system the multibeam monopulse radar with an array of directional antennas is positioned on a small aircaraft or Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS). Radar signals are simultaneously transmitted and received by multiple angle shifted directional antennas with overlapping antenna patterns and the entire sky, 360Â° for both horizontal and vertical coverage. Digitizing of amplitude and phase of signals in separate directional antennas relative to reference signals provides high-accuracy high-resolution range and azimuth measurement and allows to record real time amplitude and phase of reflected from non-cooperative aircraft signals. High resolution range and azimuth measurement provides minimal tracking errors in both position and velocity of non-cooperative aircraft and determined by sampling frequency of the digitizer. High speed sampling with high-accuracy processor clock provides high resolution phase/time domain measurement even for directional antennas with wide Field of View (FOV). Fourier transform (frequency domain processing) of received radar signals provides signatures and dramatically increases probability of detection for non-cooperative aircraft. Steering of transmitting power and integration, correlation period of received reflected signals for separate antennas (directions) allows dramatically decreased ground clutter for low altitude flights. An open architecture, modular construction allows the combination of a radar sensor with Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B), electro-optic, acoustic sensors.\n\nAn Orbital \"Virtual Radar\" from TRMM Passive Microwave and Lightning Observations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBoccippio, Dennis J.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe retrieval of vertical structure from joint passive microwave and lightning observations is demonstrated. Three years of data from the TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) are used as a training dataset for regression and classification neural networks; the TMI (TRMM Microwave Imager) and LIS (Lightning Imaging Sensor) provide the inputs, the PR (Precipitation Radar) provides the training targets. Both vertical reflectivity profile categorization (into 9 convective, 7 stratiform, 2 mixed and 6 anvil types) and geophysical parameters (surface rainfall, vertically integrated liquid (VIL), ice water content (IWC) and echo tops) are retrieved. Retrievals are successful over both land and ocean surfaces. The benefit of using lightning observations as inputs to these retrievals is quantitatively demonstrated; lightning essentially provides an additional convective/stratiform discriminator, and is most important for isolation of midlevel (tops in the mixed phase region) convective profile types (this is because high frequency passive microwave observations already provide good convective/stratiform discrimination for deep convective profiles). This is highly relevant as midlevel convective profiles account for an extremely large fraction of tropical rainfall, and yet are most difficult to discriminate from comparable-depth stratiform profile types using passive microwave observations alone.\n\nDURIP: Integrated Sensing and Computation for Passive Covert Radar, Signals Intelligence, and Other Applications Driven by Moore’s Law\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2005-12-31\n\nspectrum. 20060405003 AIRCRAFT ... ..... ... .... . ./ / \"... ...... - - RECEIVER Passive radars are fundmentally bistatic (or multistatic), in nature... principle investigator has his main office, will not let us put any research equipment on their roof.)

While micro-UAV can be a powerful tool in several civil applications such as environmental monitoring and surveillance, unleashing their full potential for societal benefits requires augmenting their sensing capability beyond the realm of active/passive optical sensors [1]. In this frame, radar systems are drawing attention since they allow performing missions in all-weather and day/night conditions and, thanks to the microwave ability to penetrate opaque media, they enable the detection and localization not only of surface objects but also of sub-surface/hidden targets. However, micro-UAV-borne radar imaging represents still a new frontier, since it is much more than a matter of technology miniaturization or payload installation, which can take advantage of the newly developed ultralight systems. Indeed, micro-UAV-borne radar imaging entails scientific challenges in terms of electromagnetic modeling and knowledge of flight dynamics and control. As a consequence, despite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging is a traditional remote sensing tool, its adaptation to micro-UAV is an open issue and so far only few case studies concerning the integration of SAR and UAV technologies have been reported worldwide [2]. In addition, only early results concerning subsurface imaging by means of an UAV-mounted radar are available [3]. As a contribution to radar imaging via autonomous micro-UAV, this communication presents a proof-of-concept experiment. This experiment represents the first step towards the development of a general methodological approach that exploits expertise about (sub-)surface imaging and aerospace systems with the aim to provide high-resolution images of the surveyed scene.

A methodology has been developed to extract gait parameters including walking speed and step time using Doppler radar. The gait parameters have been validated with a Vicon motion capture system in the lab with 13 participants and 158 test runs. The study revealed that for an optimal step recognition and walking speed estimation, a dual radar set up with one radar placed at foot level and the other at torso level is necessary. An excellent absolute agreement with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.97 was found for step time estimation with the foot level radar. For walking speed, although both radars show excellent consistency they all have a system offset compared to the ground truth due to walking direction with respect to the radar beam. The torso level radar has a better performance (9% offset on average) in the speed estimation compared to the foot level radar (13%â18% offset). Quantitative analysis has been performed to compute the angles causing the systematic error. These lab results demonstrate the capability of the system to be used as a daily gait assessment tool in home environments, useful for fall risk assessment and other health care applications. The system is currently being tested in an unstructured home environment.

A new Doppler weather radar system at X band (9.6 GHz) called the ER-2 Doppler radar (EDOP) has been developed and flown on the ER-2 aircraft. EDOP is a fully coherent Doppler weather radar with fixed nadir and forward pointing (33?? off nadir) beams that map out Doppler winds and reflectivities in the vertical plane along the aircraft motion vector. Doppler winds from the two beams can be used to derive vertical and along-track air motions. In addition, the forward beam provides linear depolarization measurements that are useful in discriminating microphysical characteristics of the precipitation. This paper deals with a general description of the EDOP instrument including the measurement concept, the system configuration and hardware, and recently obtained data examples from the instrument. The combined remote sensing package on the ER-2, along with EDOP, provides a unique platform for simulating spaceborne remote sensing of precipitation.\n\nObstacle penetrating dynamic radar imaging system\n\nDOEpatents\n\nRomero, Carlos E [Livermore, CA; Zumstein, James E [Livermore, CA; Chang, John T [Danville, CA; Leach, Jr Richard R.

Firstly, optimal radar measurements' scheduling is obtained by the method of maximizing determinant of the Fisher information matrix of radar and IRST measurements, which is managed by the expert system. Then, suggested a \"pseudo sensor\" to predict the possible target position using the polynomial method based on the radar and IRST measurements, using \"pseudo sensor\" model to estimate the target position even if the radar is turned off. At last, based on the tracking performance and the state of target maneuver, fuzzy stochastic decision is used to adjust the optimal radar scheduling and retrieve the module parameter of \"pseudo sensor\". The experiment result indicates that the algorithm can not only limit Radar activity effectively but also keep the tracking accuracy of active/passive system well. And this algorithm eliminates the drawback of traditional Radar management methods that the Radar activity is fixed and not easy to control and protect.\n\nCoherent Laser Radar System Theory.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1987-11-05\n\nThis program is aimed at developing a system theory for the emerging technology of multifunction coherent CO2 laser radars.

(Technical Monitor)\n\n2003-01-01\n\nAn airborne weather radar system, the Enhanced Weather Radar (EWxR), with enhanced on-board weather radar data processing was developed and tested. The system features additional weather data that is uplinked from ground-based sources, specialized data processing, and limited automatic radar control to search for hazardous weather. National Weather Service (NWS) ground-based Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) information is used by the EWxR system to augment the on-board weather radar information. The system will simultaneously display NEXRAD and on-board weather radar information in a split-view format. The on-board weather radar includes an automated or hands-free storm-finding feature that optimizes the radar returns by automatically adjusting the tilt and range settings for the current altitude above the terrain and searches for storm cells near the atmospheric 0-degree isotherm. A rule-based decision aid was developed to automatically characterize cells as hazardous, possibly-hazardous, or non-hazardous based upon attributes of that cell. Cell attributes are determined based on data from the on-board radar and from ground-based radars. A flight path impact prediction algorithm was developed to help pilots to avoid hazardous weather along their flight plan and their mission. During development the system was tested on the NASA B757 aircraft and final tests were conducted on the Rockwell Collins Sabreliner.\n\nPlanetary benchmarks.

Offshoot applications include the use of radar corner reflectors as landing beacons on the planetary surfaces and some deep space applications that may yield a greatly enhanced knowledge of the gravitational and electromagnetic structure of the solar system. Passive retroreflectors with dimensions of about 4 meters and weighing about 10 kg are feasible for use with orbiting radar at Venus and Mars. Earth-based observation of passive reflectors, however, would require very large and complex structures to be delivered to the surfaces. For Earth-based measurements, surface transponders offer a distinct advantage in accuracy over passive reflectors. A conceptual design for a high temperature transponder is presented.

Ingestion of high concentrations of ice particles into aircraft engines is thought to cause these events, but it is clear that the use of current on-board weather radar systems alone is insufficient for detecting conditions that might cause ICI. Passive radiometers in geostationary orbit are valuable for monitoring systems that produce high ice water content (HIWC) and will play an important role in nowcasting, but are incapable of making vertically resolved measurements of ice particle concentration, i.e., ice water content (IWC). Combined radar, lidar, and in-situ measurements are essential for developing a skilled satellite-based HIWC nowcasting technique. The High Altitude Ice Crystals - High Ice Water Content (HAIC-HIWC) field campaigns in Darwin, Australia, and Cayenne, French Guiana, have produced a valuable dataset of in-situ total water content (TWC) measurements with which to study conditions that produce HIWC. The NASA Langley Satellite ClOud and Radiative Property retrieval System (SatCORPS) was used to derive cloud physical and optical properties such cloud top height, temperature, optical depth, and ice water path from multi-spectral satellite imagery acquired throughout the HAIC-HIWC campaigns. These cloud properties were collocated with the in-situ TWC measurements in order to characterize cloud properties in the vicinity of HIWC. Additionally, a database of satellite-derived overshooting cloud top (OT) detections was used to identify TWC measurements in close proximity to convective cores likely producing large concentrations of ice crystals. Certain cloud properties show some sensitivity to increasing TWC and a multivariate probabilistic indicator of HIWC was developed from these datasets.

L.; Berg, A. A.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite will provide a unique opportunity for the estimation of soil moisture by having simultaneous radar and radiometer measurements available. As with the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite, the soil moisture algorithms will need to account for the contribution of vegetation to the brightness temperature. Global maps of vegetation volumetric water content (VWC) are difficult to obtain, and the SMOS mission has opted to estimate the optical depth of standing vegetation by using a relationship between the VWC and the leaf area index (LAI). LAI is estimated from optical remote sensing or through soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer modeling. During the growing season, the VWC of agricultural crops can increase rapidly, and if cloud cover exists during an optical acquisition, the estimation of LAI may be delayed, resulting in an underestimation of the VWC and overestimation of the soil moisture. Alternatively, the radar vegetation index (RVI) has shown strong correlation and linear relationship with VWC for rice and soybeans. Using the SMAP radar to produce RVI values that are coincident to brightness temperature measurements may eliminate the need for LAI estimates. The SMAP Validation Experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12) was a cal/val campaign for the SMAP mission held in Manitoba, Canada, during a 6-week period in June and July, 2012. During this campaign, soil moisture measurements were obtained for 55 fields with varying soil texture and vegetation cover. Vegetation was sampled from each field weekly to determine the VWC. Soil moisture measurements were taken coincident to overpasses by an aircraft carrying the Passive and Active L-band System (PALS) instrumentation. The aircraft flew flight lines at both high and low altitudes. The low altitude flight lines provided a footprint size approximately equivalent to the size of the SMAPVEX12 field sites. Of the 55 field sites, the low altitude flight lines provided\n\nPassive roadside reflectors and communications systems for improvement of radar reliability\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n2006-06-01\n\nThe use of radar in automotive applications such as adaptive cruise control is limited to detecting : target vehicles directly in front of the host vehicle.

E.\n\n1988-04-01\n\nStepped-frequency waveforms are being considered for inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging from ship and airborne platforms and for detailed radar cross section (RCS) measurements of ships and aircraft. These waveforms make it possible to achieve resolutions of 1.0 foot by using existing radar designs and processing technology. One problem not yet fully resolved in using stepped-frequency waveform for ISAR imaging is the deterioration in signal level caused by random frequency error. Random frequency error of the stepped-frequency source results in reduced peak responses and increased null responses. The resulting reduced signal-to-noise ratio is range dependent. Two of the major concerns addressed in this report are radar range limitations for ISAR and the error in calibration for RCS measurements caused by differences in range between a passive reflector used for an RCS reference and the target to be measured. In addressing these concerns, NOSC developed an analysis to assess the tolerable frequency error in terms of resulting power loss in signal power and signal-to-phase noise.\n\nPenn State Radar Systems: Implementation and Observations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nUrbina, J.

P.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nSoftware Defined Radio/Radar (SDR) platforms have become increasingly popular as researchers, hobbyists, and military seek more efficient and cost-effective means for radar construction and operation. SDR platforms, by definition, utilize a software-based interface for configuration in contrast to traditional, hard-wired platforms. In an effort to provide new and improved radar sensing capabilities, Penn State has been developing advanced instruments and technologies for future radars, with primary objectives of making such instruments more capable, portable, and more cost effective. This paper will describe the design and implementation of two low-cost radar systems and their deployment in ionospheric research at both low and mid-latitudes. One radar has been installed near Penn State campus, University Park, Pennsylvania (77.97Â°W, 40.70Â°N), to make continuous meteor observations and mid-latitude plasma irregularities. The second radar is being installed in Huancayo (12.05Â°S, -75.33Â°E), Peru, which is capable of detecting E and F region plasma irregularities as well as meteor reflections. In this paper, we examine and compare the diurnal and seasonal variability of specular, non- specular, and head-echoes collected with these two new radar systems and discuss sampling biases of each meteor observation technique. We report our current efforts to validate and calibrate these radar systems with other VHF radars such as Jicamarca and SOUSY. We also present the general characteristics of continuous measurements of E-region and F-region coherent echoes using these modern radar systems and compare them with coherent radar events observed at other geographic mid-latitude radar stations.\n\nThreat radar system simulations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMiller, L.\n\nThe capabilities, requirements, and goals of radar emitter simulators are discussed.

Four currently available simulation techniques are summarized, noting the usefulness of developing modular software for fast controlled-cost upgrades of simulation capabilities.\n\nKharkiv Meteor Radar System (the XX Age)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKolomiyets, S. V.\n\n2012-09-01\n\nKharkiv meteor radar research are of historic value (Kolomiyets and Sidorov 2007). Kharkiv radar observations of meteors proved internationally as the best in the world, it was noted at the IAU General Assembly in 1958. In the 1970s Kharkiv meteor automated radar system (MARS) was recommended at the international level as a successful prototype for wide distribution. Until now, this radar system is one of the most sensitive instruments of meteor radars in the world for astronomical observations. In 2004 Kharkiv meteor radar system is included in the list of objects which compose the national property of Ukraine. Kharkiv meteor radar system has acquired the status of the important historical astronomical instrument in world history. Meteor Centre for researching meteors in Kharkiv is a analogue of the observatory and performs the same functions of a generator and a battery of special knowledge and skills (the world-famous studio). Kharkiv and the location of the instrument were brand points on the globe, as the place where the world-class meteor radar studies were carried out. They are inscribed in the history of meteor astronomy, in large letters and should be immortalized on a world-wide level.\n\nPassive Microwave Soil Moisture Retrieval through Combined Radar/Radiometer Ground Based Simulator with Special Reference to Dielectric Schemes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSrivastava, Prashant K., ,, Dr.; O'Neill, Peggy, ,, Dr.\n\n2014-05-01\n\nSoil moisture is an important element for weather and climate prediction, hydrological sciences, and applications. Hence, measurements of this hydrologic variable are required to improve our understanding of hydrological processes, ecosystem functions, and the linkages between the Earth's water, energy, and carbon cycles (Srivastava et al. 2013). The retrieval of soil moisture depends not only on parameterizations in the retrieval algorithm but also on the soil dielectric mixing models used (Behari 2005). Although a number of soil dielectric mixing models have been developed, testing these models for soil moisture retrieval has still not been fully explored, especially with SMAP-like simulators. The main objective of this work focuses on testing different dielectric models for soil moisture retrieval using the Combined Radar/Radiometer (ComRAD) ground-based L-band simulator developed jointly by NASA/GSFC and George Washington University (O'Neill et al., 2006). The ComRAD system was deployed during a field experiment in 2012 in order to provide long active/passive measurements of two crops under controlled conditions during an entire growing season. L-band passive data were acquired at a look angle of 40 degree from nadir at both horizontal & vertical polarization. Currently, there are many dielectric models available for soil moisture retrieval; however, four dielectric models (Mironov, Dobson, Wang & Schmugge and Hallikainen) were tested here and found to be promising for soil moisture retrieval (some with higher performances). All the above-mentioned dielectric models were integrated with Single Channel Algorithms using H (SCA-H) and V (SCA-V) polarizations for the soil moisture retrievals. All the ground-based observations were collected from test site-United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) OPE3, located a few miles away from NASA GSFC. Ground truth data were collected using a theta probe and in situ sensors which were then used for validation.

Radar performance in the presence of main lobe ground clutter is considered and candidate techniques for clutter suppression are discussed. Principal system parameter drivers are examined for the case of stationkeeping at ranges comparable to target dimension.

The logarithmic error discriminant utilized for range, range rate and angle tracking is formulated and applied to the quantitative analysis of radar subsystem tracking loops.\n\nPhased-array radar for airborne systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTahim, Raghbir S.; Foshee, James J.; Chang, Kai\n\n2003-09-01\n\nPhased array antenna systems, which support high pulse rates and high transmit power, are well suited for radar and large-scale surveillance. Sensors and communication systems can function as the eyes and ears for ballistic missile defense applications, providing early warning of attack, target detection and identification, target tracking, and countermeasure decision. In such applications, active array radar systems that contain solid-state transmitter sources and low-noise preamplifiers for transmission and reception are preferred over the conventional radar antennas, because the phased array radar offers the advantages of power management and efficiency, reliability, signal reception, beam steering target detection. The current phased array radar designs are very large, complex and expensive and less efficient because of high RF losses in the phase control circuits used for beam scan. Several thousands of phase shifters and drivers may be required for a single system thus making the system very complex and expensive. This paper describes the phased array radar system based on high power T/R modules, wide-band radiating planar antenna elements and very low loss wide-band phase control circuits (requiring reduced power levels) for beam scan. The phase shifter design is based on micro-strip feed lines perturbed by the proximity of voltage controlled piezoelectric transducer (PET). Measured results have shown an added insertion loss of less than 1 dB for a phase shift of 450 degrees from 2 to 20 GHz. The new wideband phased array radar design provides significant reduction in size cost and weight. Compared to the conventional phased array systems, the cost saving is more than 15 to 1.\n\nA new system model for radar polarimeters\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nFreeman, Anthony\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe validity of the 2 x 2 receive R and transmit T model for radar polarimeter systems, first proposed by Zebker et al. (1987), is questioned. The model is found to be invalid for many practical realizations of radar polarimeters, which can lead to significant errors in the calibration of polarimetric radar images. A more general model is put forward, which addresses the system defects which cause the 2 x 2 model to break down. By measuring one simple parameter from a polarimetric active radar calibration (PARC), it is possible to transform the scattering matrix measurements made by a radar polarimeter to a format compatible with a 2 x 2 R and T matrix model. Alternatively, the PARC can be used to verify the validity of the 2 x 2 model for any polarimetric radar system. Recommendations for the use of PARCs in polarimetric calibration and to measure the orientation angle of the horizontal (H) and vertical (V) coordinate system are also presented.\n\nA new system model for radar polarimeters\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFreeman, Anthony\n\n1991-09-01\n\nThe validity of the 2 x 2 receive R and transmit T model for radar polarimeter systems, first proposed by Zebker et al.

The requirement comes due to the distributed architecture of the active phased array radar, where each antenna element in the array is connected to a dedicated Transmit-Receive (TR) module. Controlling the TR modules, which are generally few hundreds in number, and functioning them in synchronisation, is a huge task during real time radar operation and should be handled with utmost care. Indian MST Radar, located at NARL, Gadanki, which is established during early 90's, as an outcome of the middle atmospheric program, is a remote sensing instrument for probing the atmosphere. This radar has a semi-active array, consisting of 1024 antenna elements, with limited beam steering, possible only along the principle planes. To overcome the limitations and difficulties, the radar is being augmented into fully active phased array, to accomplish beam agility and multi-mode operations. Each antenna element is excited with a dedicated 1 kW TR module, located in the field and enables to position the radar beam within 20Â° conical volume. A multi-channel receiver makes the radar to operate in various modes like Doppler Beam Swinging (DBS), Spaced Antenna (SA), Frequency Domain Interferometry (FDI) etc. Present work describes the real-time radar control (RC) system for the above described active phased array radar. The radar control system consists of a Spartan 6 FPGA based Timing and Control Signal Generator (TCSG), and a computer containing the software for controlling all the subsystems of the radar during real-time radar operation and also for calibrating the radar. The main function of the TCSG is to generate the control and timing waveforms required for various subsystems of the radar. Important components of the RC system software are (i) TR module configuring software which does programming, controlling and health parameter monitoring of the\n\nA SEASAT-A synthetic aperture imaging radar system\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJordan, R.

The basic requirement of this system is to generate continuous radar imagery with a 100 km swath with 25m resolution from an orbital altitude of 800 km. These requirements impose unique system design problems. The end to end data system described including interactions of the spacecraft, antenna, sensor, telemetry link, and data processor. The synthetic aperture radar system generates a large quantity of data requiring the use of an analog link with stable local oscillator encoding. The problems associated in telemetering the radar information with sufficient fidelity to synthesize an image on the ground is described as well as the selected solutions to the problems.\n\nPassive Microwave Rainfall Estimates from the GPM Mission\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKummerow, Christian; Petkovic, Veljko\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission was launched in February 2014 as a joint mission between JAXA from Japan and NASA from the United States. GPM carries a state of the art dual-frequency precipitation radar and a multi-channel passive microwave radiometer that acts not only to enhance the radar's retrieval capability, but also as a reference for a constellation of existing satellites carrying passive microwave sensors. In March of 2016, GPM released Version 4 of its precipitation products that consists of radar, radiometer, and combined radar/radiometer products. The precipitation products from these sensors or sensor combination are consistent by design and show relatively minor differences in the mean global sense. Closer examination of the biases, however, reveals regional biases between active and passive sensors that can be directly related top the nature of the convection. By looking at cloud systems instead of individual satellite pixels, the relationship between biases and the large scale environmental state become obvious. Organized convection, which occurs more readily in regimes with large Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) and shear tend to drive biases in different directions than isolated convection. This is true over both land and ocean. This talk will present the latest findings and explore these discrepancies from a physical perspective in order to gain some understanding between cloud structures, information content, and retrieval differences. This analysis will be used to then drive a bigger picture of how GPM's latest results inform the Global Water and Energy budgets.\n\nRadar systems for a polar mission, volume 1\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMoore, R.

K.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nThe application of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) in monitoring and managing earth resources is examined. Synthetic aperture radars form a class of side-looking airborne radar, often referred to as coherent SLAR, which permits fine-resolution radar imagery to be generated at long operating ranges by the use of signal processing techniques. By orienting the antenna beam orthogonal to the motion of the spacecraft carrying the radar, a one-dimensional imagery ray system is converted into a two-dimensional or terrain imaging system. The radar's ability to distinguish - or resolve - closely spaced transverse objects is determined by the length of the pulse. The transmitter components receivers, and the mixer are described in details.\n\nMiniaturized Ka-Band Dual-Channel Radar\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHoffman, James P.; Moussessian, Alina; Jenabi, Masud; Custodero, Brian\n\n2011-01-01\n\nSmaller (volume, mass, power) electronics for a Ka-band (36 GHz) radar interferometer were required. To reduce size and achieve better control over RFphase versus temperature, fully hybrid electronics were developed for the RF portion of the radar s two-channel receiver and single-channel transmitter. In this context, fully hybrid means that every active RF device was an open die, and all passives were directly attached to the subcarrier. Attachments were made using wire and ribbon bonding. In this way, every component, even small passives, was selected for the fabrication of the two radar receivers, and the devices were mounted relative to each other in order to make complementary components isothermal and to isolate other components from potential temperature gradients. This is critical for developing receivers that can track each other s phase over temperature, which is a key mission driver for obtaining ocean surface height. Fully hybrid, Ka-band (36 GHz) radar transmitter and dual-channel receiver were developed for spaceborne radar interferometry. The fully hybrid fabrication enables control over every aspect of the component selection, placement, and connection. Since the two receiver channels must track each other to better than 100 millidegrees of RF phase over several minutes, the hardware in the two receivers must be \"identical,\" routed the same (same line lengths), and as isothermal as possible. This level of design freedom is not possible with packaged components, which include many internal passive, unknown internal connection lengths/types, and often a single orientation of inputs and outputs.\n\nPassive MIMO Radar Detection\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2013-09-01\n\ninvestigated using recent results from random matrix theory.
