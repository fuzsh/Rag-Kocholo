The IB offers four high quality and challenging educational programmes for a worldwide community of schools, aiming to develop internationally minded people who, recognising their common humanity and shared guardianship of the planet, help to create a better, more peaceful world. Schools that have achieved the high standards required for authorisation to offer one or more of the IB programmes are known as IB World Schools."
