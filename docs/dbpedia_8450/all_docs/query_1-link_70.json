The Federal Chancellor appoints the federal ministers, and from among them a Deputy Chancellor.\n\nIn actual fact, however, it is the parties that make up the government that decide which persons will head the ministries they were allocated in the co­alition negotiations. If a coalition collapses, the Chancellor can also fall prior to the end of the electoral term, as the Federal Government has the right to vote the head of government out of office at any time. In such cases parliament must, however, name a successor at the same time in what is known as a “constructive vote of no confidence”. This means that there can be no period of time without an elected government in office.\n\nThe system of personalised proportional representation is decisive with regard to the character of the parliament.
