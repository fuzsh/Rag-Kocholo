        "text": "by | 18 Jan 2024\n\nWelcome to Alaska, a land of rugged wilderness and landscapes untamed. As much of the state is still left unexplored, it has earned the nickname of “The Last Frontier”. From jagged mountain ranges to dramatic glaciers, nature reigns supreme here, and man holds no dominion. This makes Alaska the dream destination for any budding explorer or nature enthusiast. This untamed wilderness holds many secrets, but allow us to help you navigate these lands with what we do know: 49 Alaska facts to pique your curiosity and inspire your next trip to the Last Frontier.\n\nExplore the Last Frontier on our 7-day Alaska adventure: Jewels of Alaska\n\nGeography and History\n\n1. Alaska is the largest US state, covering over 665,000 square miles\n\nThat makes it larger than the next three largest states (Texas, California, Montana) combined. If Alaska were an independent country, it would be the 18th largest in the world.\n\n2. Almost one-third of Alaska’s land is in the Arctic Circle\n\n3. It is home to the 17 tallest mountains in the United States\n\n4. Alaska’s Mount Denali is North America’s highest point at 6,190 meters (20,310 feet)\n\n5. There are eight national parks in Alaska\n\nThese are Denali, Gates of the Artic, Glacier Bay, Katmai, Kenai Fjords, Kobuk Valley, Lake Clark and Wrangell-St. Elias.\n\n6. Alaska has more coastline than the entire contiguous United States combined\n\n7. It is estimated that it has over 100,000 glaciers\n\nIt’s thought that about 3% of Alaska is covered by glaciers. That’s a lot of ice, when you consider how large Alaska is.\n\n8. There are more active glaciers and ice fields in Alaska than in the rest of the inhabited world\n\n9. There are over 3 million lakes in Alaska\n\n10. Alaska’s largest lake is Lake Iliamna\n\nAt 77 miles long, the lake is as wide as the state of Connecticut.\n\n11. Alaska is 14.2% water\n\nWith more than 3,000 rivers and 3 million lakes, it’s no surprise that Alaska is thought to have 94,743 square miles of water area.\n\n12. The United State’s two largest forests are in Alaska\n\nThe Chugach forest covers 4.8 million acres, while the mighty Tongass forest spans an inconceivable 16.8 million acres.\n\nM\n\nAlaska once belonged to Russia\n\n13. Alaska has more than 100 volcanoes, and some are still active, such as Mount Redoubt and Mount Spurr\n\n14. Alaska has the highest percentage of public lands of any U.S. state\n\n15. Much of Alaska is only accessible by air or water\n\n16. Juneau is the only state capital that is inaccessible by road\n\n17. Alaska has the lowest population density of any US state\n\nThere’s only one person per square mile. If this were applied to Manhattan, New York, there would be only 16 people living on the island.\n\n18. The four largest cities in the United States are in Alaska\n\nSitka, Juneau, Wrangell and Anchorage are the US’s largest cities by area, with Sitka at a massive 2,870 square miles (7,434). This makes it almost four times the size of the state of Rhode Island.\n\n19. The only WWII battle on US soil took place in Alaska\n\nIn 1943, Japan invaded the Aleutian Islands. The Battle of Attu took place, lasting from May 11 to May 30.\n\n20. There’s a place in Alaska where the rules of gravity don’t seem to apply\n\nOn Upper Huffman Road in Anchorage, you’ll find ‘Gravity Hill’. Here, if you put your car in neutral at the bottom of the hill, it mysteriously rolls up, instead of down.\n\n21. Alaska holds the northernmost, easternmost, and westernmost points in the whole United States\n\n22. Alaska is only 50 miles from Russia\n\n23. Russia once sold Alaska to the U.S. for $7.2 million\n\nAlaska used to be part of Imperial Russia, but they sold it to the US in 1867. The move was lampooned at the time, but the critics soon ate their words when the Klondike Gold Rush happened in 1899, proving the region to be rich with gold deposits.\n\nStatehood and culture\n\n24. Alaska was one of the last states to join the US\n\nAlaska only became a US state in 1959, along with Hawaii, making them the 49th and 50th states of America respectively.\n\n25.

Alaska’s official state flower is the forget-me-not\n\n27. Alaska’s state gem is jade, found in various regions of the state\n\n28. Sitka spruce, the state tree, is one of the world’s largest species of spruce\n\n29. The state fossil is the woolly mammoth, due to the many mammoth remains found in Alaska\n\n30. Alaska has more than 10,000 active pilots\n\nMore than 1% of the state’s population have some kind of flying certification. This might be due to the fact that much of Alaska is inaccessible by land.\n\n31. It has the highest male-to-female ratio in the United States\n\nAbout 52% of Alaskans are men – the highest percentage of any state. There are 107 men for every 100 women here.\n\n32. Alaska Natives make up 18% of the state’s population\n\n33. There are 224 federally recognized Alaskan Native tribes\n\n34. The state’s official language is English, but there are also 20 Indigenous languages spoken\n\n35. Alaska means “The Great Land”\n\nThe name comes from the Aleut, one of Alaska’s Indigenous people. It can also mean “mainland”, “great country”, or “great land”.\n\n36. There’s a sport called “Alaskan High Kick,” a traditional Native Alaskan game\n\nThis game has Indigenous origins, and the objective is to kick a hanging target. However, the player must hold one foot with one hand, balance on the other hand, and then use their remaining leg up to kick the target.\n\n37. Alaska’s official state sport is dog mushing\n\nIndigenous tribes have been using dogs and sleds for transportation and recreation in Alaska for millenium.

Alaska’s heroic dogs have statues made after them\n\nThe local Alaskan huskies are beloved companions for good reason. As well as aiding transportation and helping manage the harsh environment, the dogs have saved lives too. In 1925, in the village of Nome, some local children became ill with diphtheria. An epidemic was imminent, only preventable if a serum could be somehow transported to the remote village across hundreds of miles of brutal Alaskan wilderness. Coming to the rescue were volunteers and their trusty dogs, who delivered the serum via a gruelling relay across the wilderness. The lead dog Balto, was even immortalized in New York city with a bronze statue in Central Park.\n\n40.

Alaska is home to the largest population of bald eagles in the United States\n\n42. It has the largest bears in the world: the colossal Kodiak bear\n\nKodiak bears are unique subspecies that live only on the islands of the Kodiak Archipelago. Because of this, they have been isolated from other bear species for 12,000 years. They are the largest bears in the world, standing up to 11 feet tall on their hind legs and weighing up to 1,500 pounds.\n\n43. There is an estimated one bear to every 21 people in Alaska\n\n44. The state fish is the king salmon\n\n45. The largest salmon ever caught was in Alaska\n\nHow does a 97 pound king salmon sound? That’s what Les Anderson found at the end of his line while fishing at the Kenai River, setting the world record in 1985.\n\nClimate\n\n46. During summer in some parts of Alaska, the sun never sets\n\nEver heard the phrase ‘Eternal summer’? Well in Alaska, it comes true. Huge swathes of the country are located within the Arctic Circle, so at certain times of the year the sun never falls below the horizon. Giving some parts of the state the nickname, “The Land of the Midnight Sun”. In Utqiaġvik, Alaska’s northernmost city, the sun rises on May 10 and won’t set until August 2. That’s 85 straight days of sun! Because of this, you sometimes find people hiking, fishing, and gardening at all hours of the day (or night?), and locals sometimes lose track of time. Of course, with every yin, there’s a yang. In the depths of winter, the sun also never comes up, leading to months on end of pure darkness. Alaska: a land of extremes. .\n\n47. You can grow zucchinis to be as big as a daschund\n\nBecause of Alaska’s long summer days, you can grow incredible oversized vegetables.
