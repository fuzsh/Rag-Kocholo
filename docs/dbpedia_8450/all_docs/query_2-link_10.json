        "text": "Where is Alaska? Now, you’ve probably seen a few Netflix shows (Alone anyone??) that do a fantastic job misconstruing the 49th state’s true location. Of course, it is remote, but so is Australia, French Polynesia, Sri Lanka, and thousands of other destinations that bring in millions of tourists every year regardless. And Alaska is no different!\n\nAlaska is one of the most beautiful and wild places on earth, a land of towering mountains, icy glaciers, and pristine forests. It’s also home to an incredible array of wildlife including bears, moose, caribou, whales, and bald eagles (just to name a few). Whether you’re looking for adventure or relaxation, Alaska has a wide appeal.\n\nFrom its majestic national parks to its charming small fishing towns and rustic cities, there are plenty of opportunities to explore this majestic state.\n\nWith so much to see and do in Alaska’s vast wilderness that spans from the Arctic Ocean in the north all the way down to Prince William Sound in the south, it’s easy to understand why people come from all over the world just for a chance at experiencing a little bit of what makes up Alaska and The Last Frontier!\n\nIn this post, you’re going to learn all about where Alaska is, some interesting facts (such as “is Alaska in Canada?”), and even what this unique state is known for.\n\nWhere is Alaska?\n\nAlaska is located in the northwestern corner of the United States, bordered by Canada to the east and Russia to the west (though Russia is separated by the Bering Strait which can’t be crossed by ferry or car).\n\nIt is separated from the British Columbia Province to its southeast by the Rocky Mountains and is north of Washington State, Oregon, California, and Nevada. Covering over 663,000 square miles, it is the largest state in terms of area in both the U.S. and North America.\n\nWhere is Alaska on the World Map?\n\nFor an exact visual of Alaska’s location, check out the map below!\n\nAlaska Facts\n\nHere are some helpful and interesting facts about the Alaska state!\n\nAlaska Capital\n\nAlaska’s capital city is Juneau which lies along its southeastern coast on Gastineau Channel near Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve.\n\n🐋Check out these 10 Incredible Juneau Whale Watching Tours after your trip to the stunning Mendenhall Glacier!\n\nDespite Juneau being the capital, Anchorage, Alaska is the largest city and can be found in the southcentral part of the state where it tends to get a bit colder in the winter.\n\nAlaska Population\n\nThe state has a total estimated population of just over 733 thousand people (according to the U.S. Census Bureau) across five different regions: Southcentral Alaska (Anchorage), Interior Alaska (Fairbanks), Southeast Alaska (Juneau and the Pacific Ocean), Arctic/North Slope/Bering Sea Region, and the Southwest Region (Dillingham, Kodiak Island, and the Aleutian Islands).\n\nIt also includes many islands in both the Atlantic Ocean’s Bering Sea as well as the Pacific Ocean’s Aleutian Archipelago chain including Kodiak Island off its southern coast.\n\nAlaska People\n\nKnown as an Alaskan or Alaska native, the people in Alaska are a diverse group. Alaska is home to over 200 different native languages and dialects, making it one of the most linguistically diverse places in the world.\n\nIt’s also home to many different ethnicities including Native Americans, Eskimos, Aleuts (indigenous peoples of the islands), and immigrants from Russia and Asia.\n\nHaving visited Alaska on numerous occasions and lived all across the state, I can personally vouch for the genuine hospitality and kindness of Alaskan locals! This beautiful state and its people will always hold a special place in my heart, and I truly hope you get the chance to visit one day.\n\nFAQ: Where is Alaska?\n\nIn this next section, we’re going to answer some intriguing questions and really dive into Alaska’s location!\n\nIs Alaska in USA or Canada?\n\nDespite its border with the Yukon territory of Canada and its physical separation from the lower 48, Alaska is a U.S. state and is not in Canada.\n\nWhich country is Alaska in?\n\nAlaska is in the United States! It has never been owned by Canada, though it was once the property of Russia prior to 1867 when the Treaty of Cession was signed.\n\nIs the US part of Alaska?\n\nThe United States owns Alaska, as it is the 49th of 50 total states in the nation.\n\nWhere is Alaska from the United States?\n\nWhen compared to the lower 48 (what Alaska natives call the contiguous U.S.), Alaska is in the far northwest of the country.\n\nActually bordered by Canada for the majority of its land area, Alaska is a remote destination seemingly foreign to the rest of Americans.\n\nIs Alaska an Island?\n\nNo, Alaska is not an island. While it does border the Pacific and Arctic Oceans as well as the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska on nearly 75% of its borders, it is connected to land via its border with Canada.\n\nWhere is North Pole Alaska?\n\nNorth Pole, Alaska is about 13.5 miles southeast of the city of Fairbanks in interior Alaska.\n\nWhile the name suggests that you may find this city perched on the edge of the Arctic Ocean, it’s actually where you can find Santa’s Village, top-notch ice fishing, and some of the best northern lights tours in the state!\n\nDo I need a Passport to go to Alaska?\n\nIf you are a United States citizen, you do not need a passport to go to Alaska. However, since Alaska is a U.S. state, those traveling from a foreign country without U.S. citizenship will be required to have a valid passport before arriving in Alaska.\n\nOn a similar note, it’s good to keep in mind that Alaska uses the U.S. dollar and despite it being so close to Canada, does not accept Canadian dollars.\n\nWhere is Nome Alaska?\n\nMuch more remote than the city of North Pole, Nome is in the far western reaches of the state on the border of the Bering Sea.\n\nIts historical significance reigns high as it was the town that required the Diphtheria antitoxin to be delivered all the way from Seward (known for its picture-perfect coastal hotels) by a combination of train and sled dog teams to cure the younger population’s rapidly spreading (and fatal) infection.\n\nNome still marks the finish line for the infamous Iditarod Race that started during the Diptheria outbreak in February of 1925.\n\nCan you Drive a Car to Alaska?\n\nYes, you can absolutely drive a car to Alaska! I know because I’ve done it!\n\n27 days and nearly 8,000 miles later, my husband Sean, dog, and I traveled by car from Boston, Massachusetts all the way to Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. This marked the beginning of our 6-month adventure in the Alaskan wilderness.\n\nJust keep in mind that you will need to cross an international border to do this, so there are certain travel documents you will need.\n\nIs Alaska Nice to Live in?\n\nAlaska is easily one of the best states in North America to live in! From its stunning landscapes to its diverse wildlife, Alaska is jam-packed with natural wonders.\n\nIt’s a great place for outdoor enthusiasts, and those looking for a slower pace of life will surely appreciate the quiet forests and serene coastline of this beautiful state.\n\nIf you want to know more about why Alaska is nice to live in, be sure to check out Is Alaska a Good Place to Live? The Facts for 2024!\n\nWhat is Alaska Known For?\n\nAlaska is known for its oil and natural gas production, its abundant natural resources like fishing, forestry, mining, tourism, and of course for its breathtaking landscape.\n\nIt’s also known for its unique culture and traditions that you’ll find nowhere else on Earth. From the world-famous Iditarod to the mark of summer when the salmon hit the rivers in Ketchikan and even some of the world’s best marine wildlife tours on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.\n\nOther Exciting North American Resources\n\n10 BEST Victoria Whale Watching Tours for 2024\n\nVancouver vs Seattle: Which City is Right for You in 2024?\n\n13 Unbeatable Hotels in Homer Alaska in 2024\n\n25+ Authentic Alaska Souvenirs to Bring Home 2024\n\n13 Thrilling Alaska Helicopter Tours in 2024\n\n13 BEST Campgrounds in Seward Alaska: Tips from a Local!\n\nFerry from Ketchikan to Juneau: Routes, Schedule, & Tips!\n\nKatmai National Park vs Lake Clark National Park: Which is Better for Bear Viewing?\n\nCan You See Polar Bears in Alaska?
