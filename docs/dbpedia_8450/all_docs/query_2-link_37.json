Benny Benson, a fourteen-year-old orphan boy, designed the flag in 1927.\n\nAlaska’s State Seal was adopted before it officially became a state. During that period, it was known as the District of Alaska. Alaska’s first governor, William A. Egan, officially designated the district’s seal. It had pictures of glaciers, northern lights, igloos, and an Inuit person fishing in the ice.\n\nAlaska State Symbols\n\nAlaska’s Great Seal was designed in 1910. It symbolizes the state’s extraordinary wealth, economy, and natural resources.

It surrounds most of the Saint Elias Mountains.\n\nPerennial snowfields: Perennial snowfields are the heart of Alaska’s Arctic parks. However, global warming is rapidly shifting the Arctic, and perennial snowfields are moving back.\n\nAlpine glaciers: Around 25% of Alaska’s alpine glaciers are within the national parks. The Kenai Fjords National Park has many glaciers.\n\nValley glaciers: Valley glaciers are born on the high alpine mountains but meet their end on land. When the ice overflows from a valley glacier and spreads to form a lobe, it is called a piedmont glacier. The Malaspina glacier in Alaska is the biggest piedmont glacier in North America.
