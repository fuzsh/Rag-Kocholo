I liked the free fridges placed in both our rooms and the microwave. perfect when travelling with kids. I had asked for extra towels and pillows in making the reservation but they weren't included. That wasn't a huge deal though. Free wifi was confusing as we only got one code for one of the rooms and the other person that checked in to our other room, wasn't given a code. We weren't charged, but it was confusing. Front desk staff almost exclusively AWESOME. I had spoken with the asst. manager Joe prior to my arrival and i wish i would have tried to meet him to tell him personally what a great representative he is for the brand. Common areas were perfectly clean, rooms could have been a bit cleaner though. We found a coffee pod in the machine, a book under the bed and what looked like a used (for makeup)? Q tip. The facilities staff though, were awesome still, and i'm sure that is a hard job to have. Also, we were able to afford the hotel due to the buy one get one 50% off. Even though it was a bit farther from all the sites we wanted to see, I totally love it."
