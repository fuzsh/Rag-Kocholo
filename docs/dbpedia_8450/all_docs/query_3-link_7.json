        "text": "Key Takeaways\n\nWashington, D.C., is a federal district and not part of any U.S. state.\n\nThe capital city borders Maryland to the north, east and west, and Virginia to the south.\n\nResidents of Washington, D.C., lack full representation in Congress and do not have the same rights as residents of individual states.\n\nOn July 16, 1790, the Constitution of the United States established a territory 10 miles square (100 square miles/259 square kilometers) to serve as the permanent seat of the U.S. federal government and as the nation's capital. President George Washington selected a site along the Potomac River and Anacostia River after both Maryland and Virginia ceded land to create this new federal district.\n\nAt the time, the federal government was operating from New York City, but this act — known as the Residence Act — moved the national capital to Philadelphia until December 1800, when the new capital city would be ready. We know this today, of course, as Washington, D.C. But what state is Washington, D.C., in?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome might say Washington, D.C., is in a state of confusion. But if we're answering the geography question it's quite simple: Washington, D.C., is a district and not part of any U.S. state.\n\nThe capital city borders Maryland to the north, east and west, and the state of Virginia on the southern shore of the Potomac River. But Washington, D.C., is not a city in either state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames Madison explained that keeping the nation's capital as a district prevented any one state from holding too much power.\n\nInstead, when the newly formed federal district territory was named the District of Columbia Sept. 9, 1791, about 3,000 people lived there, which wasn't enough to make it a state. White men who owned property in D.C. kept voting in either Maryland or Virginia as they always had.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy 1847, the federal government retroceded the portion of D.C. in Arlington County back to Virginia. Why? Because the residents of Alexandria, which had previously been the county seat of Fairfax County, lost their Virginia state citizenship and could no longer vote in congressional or presidential elections. So they left D.C.\n\nBut despite this temporary population and land area loss, the federal government and civilian population continued to grow. And many of those coming to the area were formerly enslaved people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act became law and enslaved men and women there were freed April 16, 1862 — months before Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation — Washington, D.C., became a hub for newly freed men and women. This, and the establishment of Howard University in 1867, helped make it home to a substantial, vibrant African American community, including luminaries like Frederick Douglass.\n\nAll this U.S. history still does not make it part of a state, however. Originally intended only as the seat of federal government, D.C. didn't even have its own mayor or city council until 1974. And even though the residents pay federal taxes, they do not have representation in Congress, meaning they lack the full rights that residents of individual states enjoy. Plus, Congress still retains the power of veto over local laws enacted by city government, which is why some argue for statehood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if there's one thing Washington, D.C., is known for, it's being home to some of the nation's best museums and monuments about American history. Here are just a few of them:\n\nOn or Near the National Mall\n\nThe National Mall is home to the most iconic monuments in the country's capital, including the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument. At the eastern end is the U.S. Capitol, to the north is the White House, and the museums of the Smithsonian Institution are on its flanks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBureau of Engraving and Printing\n\nEisenhower Memorial\n\nFDR Memorial\n\nJefferson Memorial\n\nKorean War Veterans Memorial\n\nLincoln Memorial\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. Memorial\n\nNational Gallery of Art and Sculpture Gardens\n\nU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum\n\nU.S. Institute of Peace\n\nU.S. Navy Memorial and Visitors Center\n\nVietnam Veterans Memorial\n\nWashington Monument\n\nWorld War I Memorial\n\nWorld War II Memorial\n\nMajor Public Buildings\n\nLibrary of Congress\n\nNational Archives\n\nSupreme Court of the United States\n\nU.S. Botanic Garden\n\nU.S. Capitol\n\nWhite House\n\nWhite House Visitor Center\n\nBeyond the National Mall\n\nAfrican American Civil War Museum\n\nCultural Tourism DC\n\nDC History Center\n\nFord's Theatre National Historic Site\n\nFrederick Douglass National Historic Site\n\nInternational Spy Museum\n\nKennedy Center for the Performing Arts\n\nNational Building Museum\n\nNational Geographic Museum\n\nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial\n\nWashington National Cathedral\n\nIn Nearby Virginia\n\nAir Force Memorial\n\nArlington National Cemetery\n\nMt.
