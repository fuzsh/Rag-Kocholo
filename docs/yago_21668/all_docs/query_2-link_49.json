        "text": "Comic book author Paul Castiglia grew up watching slapstick comedies like Laurel & Hardy. Now, he’s made it his mission to introduce these films to wider audiences as a presenter at the West Orange Film Festival.\n\n“They were innocent characters set adrift in a world they didn’t fully understand, but they always had each other,” Castiglia said. “There is a lot of comedy that comes out of that.”\n\nThis year, he will lead a discussion on four Laurel & Hardy shorts — Busy Bodies, Hog Wild, Towed in a Hole, and Helpmates — that were recently remastered by archivist Jeff Joseph and the UCLA Film & Television Archive. These 20-minute films were all made in the 1930s, arguably some of the best years of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy’s career.\n\nThe last few decades have seen a major push to restore classic films. As late as the 1970s, Laurel & Hardy were still regularly shown on television. But in the decades that followed they became increasingly hard to find as independent television stations lost time slots to major networks. Fans of the genre had to buy copies of their favorites, which in turn created a demand for remastered editions, Castiglia said.\n\n“People want to see these films restored as pristinely as possible,” he said. “The computer technology today can really clean up audio and visuals.”\n\nAnother factor is that archivists have discovered many of the original negatives for Laurel & Hardy films in the Library of Congress. These restored versions improve more than just the content quality. In the case of Hog Wild, the version most people have seen is actually a cropped version of the original. Now, the frame is much wider, something archivists call “full aperture.” In others, such as The Battle of the Century, these newly released versions have never-before-seen footage.\n\nWhile it’s easier than ever to watch these movies at home on DVD or with streaming services, Ken Mandel, who founded the festival in 2005, said nothing beats the shared laughter of seeing movies like this on the big screen, as he did in his youth.\n\n“This is the way movies were meant to be seen — that’s one of our slogans,” Mandel said. “People like to go out and see things with other people — it’s a cultural and social experience.”\n\nStephen Whitty, former Star-Ledger film critic and a film festival volunteer, believes that these 1930s comedies are a great way for young viewers to gain appreciation for older movies. “Kids immediately plug into these films,” Whitty said. “It’s not an old movie anymore, it’s just something that makes them laugh.”"
