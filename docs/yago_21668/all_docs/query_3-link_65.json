        "text": "Have you ever been inspired to create a meal because you saw something? While hunting turkey in central Florida, I saw a swarm of bees on a post. For most people this swarm would be nothing more than a cool picture. But before I got back in the truck, my mind was racing with ideas. How awesome would it be to create a wild turkey meal using local Florida honey? That thought led me on a search for honey. As we drove to the honey stand, we passed tons of old Florida orange groves and again I felt inspired. Be fresh and simple.\n\nWe stopped at a roadside stand and picked up a bag full of fresh hand-picked oranges and the recipe created itself. After shooting my turkey, I now had the three main elements of my Florida-inspired recipe. This recipe may not come off as your typical recipe when you think of Florida, but the flavors and ingredients scream local and fresh.\n\nOver an open fire I added these simple ingredients to create a beautiful grilled wild turkey with a honey and orange sticky glaze. Eating off the land means something to me, and doing it while hunting means even more."
