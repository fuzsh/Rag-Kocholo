        "text": "While \"Happiness,\" the new film which is adorning the Rialto screen this week, is far from being an effort that will create any stir in the movie world, it has certain ideas that will make it entertaining to many of the younger element of cinema enthusiasts. This production was adapted from the play of the same name by J. Hartley Manners, and the theme deserves infinitely better treatment.Through her presence, and not always her acting, Miss Laurette Taylor, who plays the part of Jenny Wreary, saves the film from being a most ordinary picture. In many of the scenes she overdoes the part of the mischievous errand girl in a Fifth Avenue dressmaking establishment. Miss Taylor is too sophisticated to be kittenish, and therefore she does not always enlist sympathy for Jenny, especially when her antics reach riotous heights. One concludes that her employer is extremely lenient with her for all the trouble she causes.Mr. Manners wrote his own scenario, and King Vidor, who is responsible for \"Wild Oranges,\" is credited with the direction. Judging from the handling of some scenes in this picture, one surmises that Miss Taylor did part of her own directing.Throughout the first part of this film Jenny is preposterously impudent, but she possesses the saving grace of being thoroughly happy. The narrative endeavors to show that people who have to work for what they get enjoy it, while those born wealthy become unutterably bored with life. So far as the characters in this photoplay go, the moral is proved. But as one sits and watches this film unwinding, one remembers that there are a few persons who have great wealth who manage to demonstrate their love of life, and that there are others in the opposite sphere of existence who are not as joyful as Jenny would lead us to believe.Some of the pseudo-comedy notions are overdone, especially where the sniffing Jenny receives pocket-handkerchiefs to quiet her. She sniffs and a handkerchief is handed to her, and eventually she sniffs just to receive the gift of a delicate, lace-bordered affair. She is a cheeky little baggage, who unhesitatingly slaps men, and when carrying gowns and a hat to an important customer she lets the lot fall. We must say that here, in spite of the fact that it was only a picture, we felt relieved that the taxicab did not crush her boxes.Fermoy MacDonough, a budding inventor, officiates as the hero. He discovers the idea of a hard-boiled egg slicer, and a spoon that will not slip into the plate. He also invents an arrangement to facilitate sewing for his mother-in-law, and an electrical appliance whereby she can make her armchair more comfortable by pushing a button. Fermoy is played by Pat O'Malley, who is not outstandingly good in the part.Cyril Chadwick impersonates the bored Philip Chandos, and as usual he is clever, especially considering what he is called upon to do. Hedda Hopper has the rôle of Mrs. Chrystal Pole, in which she is capable and attractive. This is a photoplay which may teach many to be happy and ambitious. We wish that the story were told in a more plausible way so as to insure its success.\n\nThe Mischievous Poor Girl.\n\nHAPPINESS, with Laurette Taylor, Pat O'Malley, Hedda Hopper, Cyril Chadwick, Edith Yorke, Patterson Dial, Joan Standing, Laurence Grant, Charlotta Minneau and others, adapted from the play by J. Hartley Manners, directed by King Vidor; Rialto magazine; Thomy Georgi, tenor; \"Riesenfeld's Classical Jazz\", Ingeborg, danseuse; \"The Fraidy Cat,\" a comedy. At the Rialto.James Kirkwood has played in many pictures, some of which have been exaggerated, but we doubt if he has ever been called upon to act in such a glaring set of improbabilities as are hitched together under the title of \"Love's Whirlpool\" and now being shown at the Cameo.There is such a thing as a bad picture which is interesting. This belongs to that type. There is not a hope of following the story in \"Love's Whirlpool,\" but some of the reckless ideas are interesting, as is also the daring of the director, Bruce Mitchell. He nonchalantly places his puppets where it meets his convenience, regardless of whether the incident or the situation is plausible. Through the film he seems to thunder: \"There they are on the beach with the girl who was drowning. The camera does not lie! What have you got to say about it?\"It was marvelous that a girl could be for any length of time in the water and then turn up in the same gown, around which are three rows of fur, just as if it had come straight from the dressmaker's. The characters are invariably always where they wish to be, whether it is when they come ashore from the wreck or when the heroine wishes to find her sweetheart. There it little suspense in this picture, in which James Kirkwood plays the rôle of Jim Reagan, a crook, who wishes to get revenge on Milton, a banker, for having sent his brother to prison. A shipwreck gives Jim his chance, as he and his sweetheart, Molly, rescue Nadine (Madge Bellamy), the banker's daughter, from the water, discovering conveniently later that she is a victim of amnesia.The most interesting part of this film is where Jim and his girl plot to extort money from Milton through fake spiritualism, using the man's own daughter to talk to him, and to be flashed before a housemaid. This part of the production is really well done, except for the unnecessary introduction or a concealed radio apparatus.Lila Lee plays the rôle of Pansy, Jim's sweetheart, and as the medium she does very well. Mr. Kirkwood on the whole is efficient as the crook who wants revenge. This production is constructed on a false premise, but is to a certain extent mindful of the \"The Miracle Man.\""
