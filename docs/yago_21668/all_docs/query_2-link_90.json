        "text": "\"Who knew two families could get this close?\" ATO has debuted a trailer for Julian Farino's The Oranges, a comedy that debuted at TIFF last year. It's a kooky, wild, domestic drama with lots of funny moments. Alia Shawkat stars as one of the daughters of one family in a suburban neighborhood; her father, played by Hugh Laurie, falls for the daughter, Leighton Meester, of the other family that lives next door. All hell breaks loose, cue indie comedy shenanigans, now you get to meet them. The cast also includes Allison Janney, Adam Brody, Catherine Keener and Oliver Platt. I saw this at TIFF and it's fun, a solid film.\n\nWatch the full theatrical trailer for Julian Farino's The Oranges, originally from Yahoo:\n\nThe Ostroff and Walling families of West Orange, NJ, couldn't be closer - that is, until Walling patriarch David falls for Ostroff daughter Nina , making life just a bit awkward for both himself and the families.\n\nThe Oranges is directed by British filmmaker Julian Farino, of lots of TV work including \"Entourage\" and \"How to Make It in America\". The screenplay was written by newcomers Ian Helfer & Jay Reiss (\"Wainy Days\", Uber Alice) and showed up on the Blacklist a few years ago. The film premiered at the Toronto Film Fest last year. ATO Pictures will be releasing The Oranges in limited theaters starting October 5th this fall."
