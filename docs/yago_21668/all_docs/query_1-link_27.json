        "text": "The Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Jay Dratler, Samuel Hoffenstein & Elizabeth Reinhardt\n\nBased on the novel by Vera Caspary\n\nDirector: Otto Preminger\n\nCinematographer: Joseph LaShelle\n\nMusic: David Raksin\n\nCast: Gene Tierney, Dana Andrews, Clifton Webb, Vincent Price, Judith Anderson\n\nRelease: October 11, 1944\n\nStudio: 20th Century Fox\n\nAwards: Won an Oscar for Best Black & White Cinematography (also nominated were “Double Indemnity” & “Gaslight”). Nominated for Best Director (lost to Leo McCarey for “Going My Way. Also nominated was Billy Wilder for “Double Indemnity.), Best Supporting Actor for Webb (lost to Barry Fitzgerald in “Going My Way”), Best Screenplay (lost to “Going My Way.” Also nominated were “Double Indemnity” and “Gaslight”), and Best B&W Art Direction (lost to “Gaslight.”)\n\nPercent Noir: 90%\n\nWhen I was in undergrad, I took this class on film noir. For the life of me, I cannot remember a single film that was screened during that semester except for “Laura,” which my two instructors insisted was the first film noir. Even 19-year-old me was dubious about that statement. And they were unfortunately mistaken. “Laura” was not the first film noir (take your pick for candidates there…), nor was it the movie that perfected the genre (“Double Indemnity” was released a month earlier), but it is one of the transcendent examples of the genre. I don’t want to seem like I’m using hyperbole here, but I genuinely believe this is one of those rare films which is unforgettable.\n\nThe reasons for this are myriad, but on a macro level can be viewed thusly: it is a great mystery, and it is also a fascinating character study. Modern critics love to dive into the psychology of the film, which I’ll get to in a couple of paragraphs, but I want to focus on what a great damn murder mystery it is first.\n\nThe storyline involves the murder of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney), a New York socialite who is in equal amounts loved and obsessed over by every member of her inner circle. After she was shot in her apartment point blank in the face by a shotgun, Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) is brought in to investigate. Was it famous newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), who took Laura under his wing and helped establish her among Manhattan’s elite? Or perhaps it was her maybe-fiancé Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), who was probably cheating on her? But what about Ann Treadwell (Judith Anderson), who seems to love Shelby more than Laura ever did? And then there’s Laura’s maid Bessie (Dorothy Adams), who remains faithful to her employer even after her death…\n\nIt’s a trick question, of course, because Laura isn’t dead. It was a model Shelby was sleeping with who took the gunshot to the face. Laura’s return means she’s a suspect too, which sucks because Mark was becoming as obsessed with dead Laura as the others were with alive Laura.\n\nThis is one beautifully structured and composed mystery. The twist that Laura is alive is one of the best in film history – a twist so awesome that it hasn’t been ripped off countless times because it’s just that iconic. But more than that, the screenplay by Jay Dratler (“The Dark Corner”), Samuel Hoffenstein (“The Phantom of the Opera”) and Elizabeth Reinhardt (“Sentimental Journey”) sets up a beautiful maze of red herrings, misdirects and hiding things in plain sight. I mean, one of the first shots of the movie is one of the iconic clocks that is the key to the entire mystery!\n\nThe other genius move by the screenwriters is to give us voiceover from the beginning from Waldo’s character. It puts the audience at ease with him, tricking us into thinking he is our way into the film instead of Mark and subtly making us eliminate him as a suspect in our minds. Having the murdered woman be Laura’s rival immediately adds intrigue to Laura’s return – perhaps she’s not the saint everyone makes her out to be, and when she behaves as such, we suspect her even more.\n\nAnd then there is all that fucked-up psychology, which is a hallmark of director Otto Preminger’s films noir. Even the smallest of roles are fascinating. Take the maid Bessie, who keeps insisting on showing up for work despite that she has no one to clean up after now. From a mystery standpoint, we wonder if she’s coming back to ditch evidence, but from a personal standpoint, how messed up is she? It’s never explicitly hinted at, but Bessie is pretty obviously a lesbian who has been obsessed with Laura since she was hired, now unable to make peace with the fact that the woman she loved is dead and will never know.\n\nBut the trio of characters who will forever get the most attention from “Laura” are Waldo, Shelby and Ann. The three actors portraying them are having an absolute ball finding new ways to chew on the furniture, and the line between the characters relishing what is going on and the actors relishing the roles is a grey one. First we get Ann, inhabited by Anderson (Mrs. Danvers represent!) as a woman who desperately attempts to be above whatever drama is surrounding her, because to admit she is part of it would be to admit that she’s a broken woman, obsessed (there’s that word again) with a man who puts up with her, even likes her… but will never love her.\n\nPrice plays Shelby with an accent that is sorta kinda his own, but with a little whisp of… well, something else. He doesn’t quite sound like the Vincent Price we know and love, which leaves us immediately unbalanced when listening to Shelby speak. Shelby is a weak bastard – just about everyone in the movie (including him) talk about this, sometimes in front of him. And yet he seduces Laura enough to become engaged to her, and is the object of Ann’s every desire… despite being pretty bland. But while the character is purposely bland, Price’s performance is anything but, twisting every conversation the character has into something so innocent that you just know there are dark undertones somewhere in there.\n\nWaldo is not only the best character in the movie, but one of the best characters in film history. He makes a grand entrance, nude in his gigantic bathtub (I want one) with a typewriter over his junk in a way that prevents the audience from seeing it but not Mark. I suppose Waldo did this because, in his messed-up, elevated melodramatic mind he believed that he was revealing his “naked self” metaphorically and physically to the police dick (sorry, I had to) means he’ll not be as much of a suspect. Very gay but still super-pissy when Laura decides she needs more than just a BFF in her life, Waldo insists to Mark that she “melted his cold heart.” And perhaps she did… and since he could now feel affection, he could also feel obsession and hate, which is why he attempted to kill her. Waldo gets most of the best lines in the movie, all of the best reaction shots, and his death leaves the movie feeling like a tragedy even though he’s a straight-up killer.\n\nAnd then there’s the leading duo of Mark and Laura, who have historically been called the least interesting characters in the movie. I don’t know about that… just because the parts aren’t showy doesn’t mean that the characters aren’t interesting. Mark does get the most iconic sequence in the film, where he wanders through Laura’s empty apartment, searching through her belongings while almost pretending he’s on a date with the woman. Mark is a blunt object (Waldo says as much), and functions as the antidote to Waldo’s sophistication. He has no real power in any given situation with the characters… note how he always threatens to arrest them but never does… and is impotent in his love of Laura because first, she was dead and second, she was a suspect. I’ve run hot and cold on Andrews’ work in the last couple of films I’ve seen him in, and it’s not a great performance here. But then again, it’s not supposed to be… he does what he needs to do, stares in amusement/annoyance at all the other characters, looks handsome for Laura, and that’s all.\n\nTierney’s performance is fascinating to watch. The idea of Laura is that she is all things to all people all of the time, which is of course impossible to achieve. Tierney knows this, and though her character remains distinctly “Laura” in every scene, she recalibrates her performance slightly depending on which character she is interacting with. Note in the flashbacks with Waldo that Laura is spunkier, more combative. That is what Waldo wanted from her. Then with Mark she is more malleable, more feminine… which is what his character desires from her. There’s a lot of subtlety here many critics apparently haven’t picked up on.\n\nPreminger directs his actors well, and also gets grand work from all his technical partners. Cinematographer Joseph LaShelle (“Fallen Angel”) won an Oscar for his work, which goes wonderfully crazy with atmospherics at the film’s climax. David Raksin’s score has become as iconic as the film itself, not just because of the hit song birthed from it, but because it captures that mood of romance and uncertainty to perfection. This is one of Preminger’s first films, and the steady hand with which he guides the production is astounding.\n\nMany of our greatest films are about the obsession to capture an ideal… either through a want, a desire, an identity, a passion. But how often do these masterpieces actually clash that obsession – that idealization – with reality? Almost never. And that’s one of the reasons “Laura” remains one of the great masterpieces in all of film.\n\nScore: *****\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Edmund H. North & Andrew Solt\n\nBased on the 1947 novel “In a Lonely Place” by Dorothy B. Hughes\n\nDirector: Nicholas Ray\n\nCinematographer: Burnett Guffey\n\nMusic: George Anthiel\n\nCast: Humphrey Bogart, Gloria Grahame, Frank Lovejoy\n\nRelease: May 17, 1950\n\nStudio: Paramount Pictures\n\nPercent Noir: 90%\n\n“In a Lonely Place” is a movie that comes with a lot of baggage. So much so that it’s nearly impossible to separate discussion of the film itself with everything that went on behind the scenes. In case you somehow are not in the know: Nicholas Ray essentially made his then-wife Gloria Grahame relinquish any freedom from expression over the making of the film in the contract she signed, and then the marriage quickly dissolved thanks to Grahame sleeping with Ray’s 13-year-old son from an earlier marriage. Yep, pretty fucked up.\n\nBut was all of the suffering worth it? Many film buffs point to abusive sets like “Last Tango in Paris” or “Marnie” and call the films masterpieces because of the suffering inflicted during their creation… not in spite of it. To that I call bullshit — and also don’t think either of the above films are masterpieces, or anywhere close. Would I prefer that “In a Lonely Place” didn’t exist and its creators instead all found peace? Duh. But here it is, and so we shall discuss it.\n\nThis was the first film Humphrey Bogart made with his independent production company, and it’s not an overstatement to say that the film would not work without him as the lead. The plot involves a washed-up screenwriter named Dixon (Bogart) who one night invites a young woman (Martha Stewart, no not that one) home with him to tell him all above a novel he may be hired to adapt. The next morning the woman is dead and Dixon, with his history of alcoholism and physical abuse (at one point the cops show a file thicker than most Chandler novels), is the obvious suspect. But Dixon’s neighbor Laurel (Grahame) gives him an alibi – not because she actually saw him, but because she’s attracted to him. The attraction is mutual, and the duo fall deeply and madly in love, with the emphasis on the word madly. After all, if Dixon didn’t kill the woman, who did? And the more Laurel watches Dixon fly off the handle, the more concerned she becomes…\n\nThe reason only Bogart could have played Dixon is that he is the only actor who could have pulled off the tightrope of making us care about his character for as long as we do. Put the dialogue and actions in the lap of any other major Hollywood actor and the character fundamentally doesn’t work. But because we inherently love Bogie and want to root for him, we invest in his relationship with Laurel. After all, his first violent outburst in the film is defending a drunken actor’s honor… so he can’t be all bad, right? We root for them, despite the festering feeling that our hearts are going to be broken. And the one-two punch of the ending reveal that Dixon isn’t guilty of murder directly before he almost murders Laurel in fury is a total gobsmacker.\n\nBoth Dixon and Laurel are well-sketched characters dripping with history – you understand that they are both wounded from their pasts, and so it’s easier to believe that they fall so quickly and completely in love. Laurel has an unfortunate history with another man that ended very badly, and Dixon has several unfortunate histories with women that ended worse. Watching the film again, the most heartbreaking scene is when they are most happy, living in domestic bliss as Dixon pens his comeback script while Laurel fawns over him and types up his handwritten pages. Your heart breaks not because of the content of the scene, but because of what could have been.\n\nAnd yet, fundamentally, the two characters could never be happy. Despite their murky backgrounds, Laurel is essentially a good person while Dixon is essentially a bad guy. Not because he may or may not be a murderer, but because he’s an abuser. There’s a scene early in the second act where Dixon explains to two friends how the murder must have taken place, going into excruciating detail about how it happened and forcing the obviously uncomfortable couple to act it out in front of him. Co-screenwriters Edmund H. North and Andrew Solt inform the viewer very explicitly in that moment that Dixon, if not the actual murderer, is one of the dregs of humanity. It works as both a red herring and character building… but because it’s Bogie we try to forget. We try to forgive. Just like Laurel. Until you can’t…\n\nThis is perhaps the best of Bogie’s many fine performances – though it would seem impossible, he makes you both care for Dixon while also be terrified for Laurel’s life the entire time they are together. By the end of the film his performance has twisted your stomach in knots. And Grahame is all aces too, mixing vulnerability and hardness to perfection throughout. She’s famous for playing a live wire and does that well, but her more subdued work here is just as powerful. And those eyes!\n\nTogether they inhabit one of the most alive places in all of noir. The collection of small apartments seems idyllic at first, but the production designer is careful to create a series of gates and bars that can seem constricting once night falls. It underlines perfectly that Laurel truly can’t escape – the man she so loves but is so afraid of is only a few paces away.\n\nIn addition to being one of the best examples of film noir, “In a Lonely Place” also has dialogue, created by Dixon for the film he’s writing, which serves as a mantra for the genre: “I was born when she kissed me. I died when she left me. I lived a few weeks while she loved me.” I can think of a few quotes that may equal it, but none better. Writing doesn’t get much better than that, folks.\n\nScore: *****\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Frank Fenton, Jack Leonard, Earl Felton (uncredited)\n\nDirector: John Farrow, Richard Fleischer (uncredited)\n\nCinematographer: Harry J. Wild\n\nMusic: Leigh Harline\n\nCast: Robert Mitchum, Jane Russell, Vincent Price, Raymond Burr\n\nRelease: August 25, 1951\n\nStudio: RKO Pictures\n\nPercent Noir: 70%\n\n“His Kind of Woman” is the rarest of films noir – a comedy. Now, many a noir have dialogue that will leave you laughing until your sides ache, but it’s kind of a necessity of the genre to have shadows, darkness, moral ambiguity and the like. And the reason that this film works as well as it does is that would work perfectly with all the gags stripped away and just played straight. But those gags? Oooh, gurl.\n\nThe leading role could only be played by noir antihero supreme Robert Mitchum (sorry Bogie). He plays Dan Milner, who is given $50,000 by exiled drug lord Nick Ferraro (Raymond Burr) to hop on some planes and head…well… somewhere. Milner is completely in the dark, but at least he has a good sparring partner on his trip in the form of Lenore Brent (Jane Russell). They arrive at an idyllic beachfront resort in Mexico, where Lenore’s boyfriend is waiting for her – an A-list actor named Mark Cardigan (Vincent Price), and where Milner continues to try to figure out why he’s been hired and why he’s been brought there.\n\nThe movie starts off as hardboiled as they come – after Milner is beaten to a pulp by some thugs, he gets a phone call where someone asks how he is: “I’m about to take off my tie… and trying to decide is I should hang myself with it.” Russell is introduced singing a catchy ditty, but it’s up in the air for awhile if she’s a femme fatale or not. Then Vincent Price shows up and effectively steals the entire movie.\n\nCardigan is one of the best characters in all of noir because he desperately wants to be the type of film noir hero we expect – the tragic Shakespearean type… but he’s too busy being a narcissistic actor to pull it off. There’s a lot of crackling dialogue throughout the film, but no one sells it quite like Price. And the screenwriters Frank Fenton and Jack Leonard (with uncredited rewrites by Earl Felton) have a ball breaking down tough-guy stereotypes, romantic figures and Hollywood. When Cardigan shows his newest film to the hotel guests, one of the characters insults it and another comforts Cardigan by saying “You know, you can’t take his opinion on anything – he’s an intellectual.” Oh, how I laughed!\n\nIn the background of all this fun is the simmering mystery of why Milner is there. And the answer is legitimately cool, with Ferraro planning on getting plastic surgery to look like Milner, killing him and then heading back into America with his face. The final act manages to thread the needle of cutting back and forth between the hilarious action of Cardigan gathering the hotel guests and Mexican police to attack a yacht, and the aforementioned yacht where Milner is being held captive, tortured and repeatedly nearly killed. The Cardigan stuff is played totally for laughs and the Milner stuff completely straight… and yet contrasting the two next to one another makes them work better, which seems impossible until you actually see the movie.\n\nThe movie was famously shot, reshot and then reshot again at the behest of Howard Hughes, who was then the head of RKO. Original director John Farrow was out, and allegedly over 80 minutes of the two-hour feature were reshot by “The Narrow Margin” creative team of director Richard Fleischer and Felton. First, as possibly the biggest fan of “The Narrow Margin” there is, I applaud his choices. Then after most of the film was reshot, Hughes noticed Burr in a film, hired him as the villain and then reshot all those scenes as well. So yeah, basically the movie has no reason to work as well as it does. And I think the reason it’s regarded not as a masterpiece but as a “very good” noir is because the scattershot directing style isn’t a good story for critics and historians who prefer leaning into the auteur theory hard when considering anything “worthwhile.” That’s total bullshit, but also beside the point.\n\nMitchum and Russell were perfectly cast as the leads. Mitchum had been doing these types of movies for a decade now, and here he brings a jaded amusement to every scene he’s in – he doesn’t quite wink at the audience, but you can see the smile on his face as he recites dialogue about ironing his money. Russell, of course, is one of the most gifted comedians in film history, and brings a light, fun energy to every one of her scenes – and also manages to nail every punchline she’s given. She looks great in her myriad of beautiful clothing (I think the only comparable film noir is “Gilda”), and if the movie does have a problem, it’s that it eliminates her from the final act. That said, locking your heroine in a closet so she won’t sacrifice herself to save her true love made me giggle for almost a minute, so it’s hard to be mad.\n\nThe directors (it’s hard to tell who recruited who) did a great job at finding great character actors to fill out the supporting players. Burr is ruthless and his eyes reflect great intensity throughout, and there are aces performances by Tim Holt, Charles McGraw and Thurston Howell III. The movie even has fun with the “good girl” noir image – Jennie (Leslie Banning) is introduced as the new bride of a nice guy who gets in too deep gambling. Milner takes pity on her and helps the guy break even. Then Jennie shows up and kisses Milner for a beat (did I see tongue?!), telling him her husband okayed the make out sesh.\n\nI love “His Kind of Woman.” It’s as essential a noir for me as “Double Indemnity,” and it also happens to be one of my favorite comedies. There has never been a film before or since that quite managed to pull off the tight-rope walk of humor and crime. It’s my kind of movie.\n\nScore: *****\n\nThe Tarsem Odyssey\n\nWriter: Marc Klein and Jason Keller\n\nStory: Melisa Wallack\n\nCast: Lily Collins, Julia Roberts, Armie Hammer, Nathan Lane, Danny Woodburn, Martin Klebba, Sebastian Saraceno, Jordan Prentice, Mark Povinelli, Joe Gnoffo, Ronald Lee Clark\n\nProducer: Ryan Kavanaugh, Bernie Goldmann, Brett Ratner, Kevin Misher\n\nCinematography: Brendan Galvin\n\nMusic: Alen Menken\n\nCompany: Relativity Media\n\nRelease: March 30, 2012\n\nAwards: Eiko Ishioka was posthumously nominated for an Oscar for Best Costume Design, but lost to “Anna Karenina.”\n\nThe year was 2012 and the buzz words around all the studios were “dark,” “gritty” and “reinterpretation.” This was thanks to 2008’s masterpiece “The Dark Knight,” which was immediately heralded as one of the greatest blockbusters of all time and a sign of the new, “mature” tentpole feature. A slew of chestnuts both old and new were given the greenlight right after that, and as a result “Robin Hood” got muddy and rainy, “The Amazing Spider-Man” got alt rock, Harry Potter grew facial hair, “The Man of Steel” became a stone-cold killer, Star Trek trekked “Into Darkness,” and even sweet, innocent Snow White would don armor like Joan of Arc and battle against a CGI army of evildoers.\n\nHowever, that Snow White wasn’t in “Mirror Mirror.”\n\nEvery now and then, two films featuring the same subject are released within a few months of one another. “Deep Impact” and “Armageddon.” “Capote” and “Infamous.” “Dangerous Liaisons” and “Valmont.” And that happened here as well. Battle-scarred, emo Snow White was played by Kristen Stewart in “Snow White and the Huntsman,” which would be released several months later and gross $400 million.\n\nSo to say that Tarsem’s “Mirror Mirror,” which mixed the classic fairy tale with a screwball comedy, was not in touch with the zeitgeist would be an understatement. It must have been surreal for the film’s creators to read the reviews that compared their film negatively to another which hadn’t even been released yet. It’s especially annoying considering that, when “Snow White and the Huntsman” finally hit theaters, everyone realized quickly that it was awful.\n\nIs “Mirror Mirror” a better movie? Well, it’s an apples and oranges argument, but yes.\n\nThat said, it’s not great, either.\n\nThe film opens with the Evil Queen (Julia Roberts) narrating the origin of Snow White (Lily Collins), fiendishly boasting that “This is my story – not hers.” I would bet a small amount of money that line was written specifically to convince Roberts to do the movie. After a charming, shirtless Prince (Armie Hammer) is waylaid on the road by the seven dwarfs (Danny Woodburn, Martin Klebba, Sebastian Saraceno, Jordan Prentice, Mark Povinelli, Joe Gnoffo, Ronald Lee Clark), he takes refuge in the Queen’s castle, and immediately becomes her object of desire. But when the Prince sees Snow White, he is immediately smitten, so the Queen sends her right-hand cockroach Brighton (Nathan Lane) to kill Snow. Instead, Brighton releases Snow, who is taken in by the dwarfs and begins to plot a way to make things right.\n\nWhile the set-up is mostly the story we know, the screenplay begins to diverge in the second and third acts. Snow does not fall comatose, and she’s the one who has to bestow true love’s kiss on the Prince after he falls under one of the Queen’s spells. The climax is re-envisioned as a “Sleeping Beauty”-style battle between Snow and a flying creature, albeit with a twist. The poisoned apple doesn’t even make an appearance until the final seconds of the film. The changes feel natural enough that they don’t hinder our enjoyment of the story, and I especially appreciated the change-up with the kiss.\n\nThat said, the screenplay by Marc Klein and Jason Keller from a story by Melisa Wallack often seems adrift tonally, unsure of how much to lean into the screwball comedy and how much to exploit the fantastical elements of the story. The telling seems aimed squarely at children, with few winks and nudges to the adults in the audience, which is fine, but is confused at how modern it wants to be. I like to use this as my rule of thumb – if it’s genuinely funny or engaging, the audience won’t care if it’s out of place time-wise to the story you are telling. That’s why the queen’s beauty makeover, which features actual bees stinging her lips, works, and why the palace guards pinky-swearing does not.\n\nLuckily, the game cast really does well to help sell the often-subpar material. Roberts has a lot of fun camping it up as the Evil Queen, selling her snipes with great panache. This would be Collins’ breakthrough role, and she acquits herself well to both the innocence Snow must showcase in the first half and her gutsiness in the second. Lane does one hell of a lot with a thankless role, and the seven men portraying the dwarfs make their paper-thin characters much funnier than they should be. But the real revelation here is Hammer, who manages to perfectly toe the line between being a clown and a leading man. He shares an easy, sweet chemistry with Collins and has a ball sparring with Roberts.\n\nOne of the highlights of the film is a quiet scene of the Queen and the Prince eating. They are sitting at a long table and, in order to get the Prince closer, the Queen simply pulls the tablecloth until his plate is next to hers. She relishes telling him that Snow is dead, and when he reacts with shock, she asks him if he needs a second to process. He says yes. She looks at the nearby clock and gives him exactly one pendulum swing before she dives back in, which got a genuine belly laugh from me. “Mirror Mirror” needed more moments like this, and it could have been something great.\n\nIf scenes like that work perfectly, others groan and strain. I mentioned the planted line earlier, but there are signs everywhere of studio interference. For instance, an action sequence comes during the second half that involves a magical wooden mannequin attacking Snow and the Dwarfs. The scene has zero purpose and can be excised from the film without losing anything, and it’s obvious it’s only there because executives thought the pace was dragging. There’s also a subplot about taxes, and nothing will make children go to sleep faster than a subplot about taxes. Then, at the climax, Snow locks the Prince and her friends in her home to face the creature alone, then gives a speech about how she always read stories growing up where the Prince saved the Princess, and now wants to tell a different kind of story. It’s a lovely sentiment (that isn’t set up at all) but makes zero sense in context of the story and makes Snow seem stupid.\n\nThose scripted moments are too on-the-nose, especially because the natural feminism of the story is more than enough to impress. The strongest passage is a montage of Snow becoming an adult by learning from the Dwarfs a myriad of tricks and ways to defend herself. It’s a familiar trope, sure, but placing it in the context of a fairy tale where the main character is most known for being comatose speaks volumes about what the authors are trying to do.\n\nThe film is a visual orgasm – I don’t know how else to put it. Eiko Ishioka died shortly before the film was released, and this is the most extravagant and creative of her work for Tarsem, bar none. Every single gown is a stunner. That’s right – Every. Single. Gown. And her looks for the men, particularly the awesome stilts that the Dwarfs use to hide their height, are nearly as beautiful. Watching the film on Blu-ray, it is not an exaggeration to say that I paused every scene and got up close to the screen to drink in the details of those costumes. Is it one of the best costumed films of all time? I think so.\n\nThat’s not to say that the rest of the creatives were slacking. Tom Foden’s production design works in great harmony with Ishioka’s costumes, and he manages to come up with an original vision for a fairy tale castle, which is much harder to accomplish than one might think. He also sets the Queen’s abortive wedding in a magnificent tent on a frozen lake… which is wow.\n\nMaestro Alan Menken, who penned the scores (and wrote the songs) for some of Disney’s most iconic fairy tales, including “The Little Mermaid,” “Beauty and the Beast,” “Enchanted,” “Aladdin” and “The Hunchback of Notre Dame,” provides the music here, and gives us two stunning themes. I almost wish he had written several songs for the film to help get us through the more cringe-worthy dialogue scenes, but alas it was not to be.\n\nMenken did not write the song performed over the end credits, “I Believe,” which Tarsem stages as an opulent Bollywood number. It should be completely out-of-place, but considering the mess of everything around it, the song somehow works.\n\nReviews of “Mirror Mirror” were slightly better than Tarsem had for “Immortals,” but still mediocre. Aside from all the “Snow White and the Huntsman” comparisons (which, again, was not even out yet), critics attacked the tonal problems, which was fair, and Collins’ performance, which was less fair. Her work feels more of-the-moment today than I imagine it did when the film was released six years ago. I also can’t help but make note of the fact that multiple reviewers for major publications actually made snide comments about how feminist the film was. Variety’s Justin Chang used the phrase “unsparingly hip, politically correct girl-power sensibility,” which feels far outdated only a few years later. “Politically Correct” has thankfully become simply “correct” in this case.\n\nPerhaps the most blunt critique (which rings somewhat true) came from The New York Times’ Manohla Dargis, who wrote “While Mr. Singh knows how to make performers and sets look good, he has trouble putting them into vibrant, kinetic, meaningful play, which effectively means he’s a better window dresser than a movie director.”\n\nThen again, I feel like if “Mirror Mirror” was released today, the reviews would be kinder. I think it’s a fine film, far from terrible but also deeply flawed, but in general we seem to be much more welcoming of this style of storytelling in 2018. The darkness and grit I mentioned in the opening paragraphs is not “in” anymore, and we are loving our live action fairy tales now. “Malificent” would open big in 2014 and pave the way for a myriad of other retellings, including straight remakes of “The Jungle Book” and “Beauty and the Beast,” both of which grossed around a billion dollars each. Comparatively, “Mirror Mirror” grossed about $180 million off an $85 million budget, ensuring a small profit for the studio but not leaving the footprint it was expected to.\n\nThe best of the Disney remakes is Kenneth Branagh’s 2015 version of “Cinderella,” which offers all the same visual opulence in costumes and set design that “Mirror Mirror” does (okay, maybe it’s not quite as pretty, but it’s close). Instead of Roberts, we have Cate Blanchett as the Evil Stepmother, and for all the trouble “Mirror Mirror” goes through in its first act to reframe the story from her perspective, it never comes close to the quiet, astonishing monologue Blanchett gives to Cinderella reframing the entire fairy tale from her perspective.\n\nI can’t help but think that “Cinderella” is the movie “Mirror Mirror” was trying to be when it was originally envisioned. The two work surprisingly well as a double bill with one another, and not just because Collins and Lily James both have magnificent eyebrows.\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Jo Eisinger\n\nAdaptation: Marion Parsonnet\n\nStory: E.A. Ellington\n\nDirector: Charles Vidor\n\nCinematographer: Rudolph Mate\n\nMusic: Huge Friedhofer\n\nCast: Rita Hayworth, Glenn Ford, George Macready, Steven Geray\n\nRelease: February 14, 1946\n\nStudio: Columbia Pictures\n\nPercent Noir: 70%\n\n“Gilda” holds up a lot better than most other films noir from the ’40s and ‘50s for two reasons. First is that much of the subtext of the film has aged well and allows it to be examined in a way differently today than when it was first released. Second is the three-dimensional character of Gilda (Rita Hayworth), who could have been just another femme fatale or could have been just another good girl lost in her own movie, but instead comes alive as a human being – a rarity for this genre.\n\nThe film centers on a triangle between Gilda, her longtime love Johnny (Glenn Ford) and her husband Ballin (George Macready). What makes this triangle especially interesting is that Johnny and Ballin are obviously also in a romantic relationship with one another. The movie takes place in Argentina, and Johnny is a cheating gambler who wins a bunch of money from soldiers one night at the docks, and is immediately held at gunpoint for the cash. But that’s when Ballin intervenes, scaring the mugger away and introducing himself to Johnny. Without saying so, it’s clear that Ballin was cruising the docks, and he and Johnny have quite the homoerotic flirt session. They light each other’s cigarettes, and Ballin lets Johnny touch his cane, which has a knife that pops out of the end of it. No, I am not exaggerating. They both agree that dames aren’t good for “gambling,” and soon Johnny is the manager of Ballin’s casino.\n\nThe screenplay by Jo Eisinger isn’t exactly subtle when painting the men in a sexual relationship, but a wrench is thrown into things when Ballin leaves for two weeks and comes back with a wife – Gilda. She appears in perhaps the most iconic film entrance of all time (with apologies to Scarlett O’Hara, Harry Lime and Kate Winslet’s big hat), tossing her hair back in a strapless dress and responding to the question “Are you decent?” with a coy “Me?”\n\nGilda used to be with Johnny, and both are still deeply, madly (emphasis on “mad”) in love with one another, but Johnny is now with Ballin. Gilda is technically married to Ballin, but we get the sense that it’s a sexless marriage. The three characters take turns hating one another, loving one another, carrying out intricate revenge plots on one another… you know, the usual. In the background are Ballin’s criminal activities, which involve lightbulbs (or something) and matter to the plot only in the way that insurance mattered to the plot of “Double Indemnity.”\n\nThe trio of performances at the center of the film are aces, just aces. Ford, who gets the voiceover to help us continue to sympathize with him even when he is a complete asshole (which is usually), and has a wonderful, expressive face for jealous rages. He is handsome, but not so handsome that we believe he could do better than Gilda or Ballin, so we understand that this is life and death for him. Macready sells the psychopath thing well, especially the barely-contained anger at what’s going on under his nose. And Hayworth pulls off that impossible task of being everything to every man. She’s a sex kitten but a nun. She plays hard-to-get but is also a total romantic.\n\nGilda gets three singing bits in the film, and for once all three are essential to the narrative. I’m so exhausted by having the films shoehorn a musical number into the narrative for no purpose other than to stop the tension and exploit an actress’ beauty. The first, a quiet guitar-led scene where she sings softly to a casino employee, humanizes her for us. The second is a bombastic number that shows her completely in control of her sexuality and life, and the third (which is the most famous) is her heartbreaking/sexy striptease reprise of “Put the Blame on Mame,” which she had sung earlier in the guitar.\n\nAnother reason “Gilda” holds up so well is that director Charles Vidor has gone out of his way to create an entire world for his characters to inhabit. The club/casino is beautifully built and photographed (I totally want to visit there… preferably when people are not shooting one another), and Ballin’s office uses all the best parts of film noir (including mechanized venetian blinds!!!) to create atmosphere. Staircases are a big deal for the film, and there are two here that get big scenes and a major spotlight. From carnivals to parties to apartments, this is a movie that paints around the edges. You think you’ll walk away from the film just remembering Hayworth and those dresses (designed by Jean Louis), but it’s a credit to the filmmakers that you remember the places she inhabits just as much.\n\nVidor is one of those very good directors who seems to have unfortunately fallen through the cracks of history. Most of his filmography is quite impressive, but it’s hard for him to gain traction in the history books because he directed such a variety of genres. Aside from “Gilda,” he also directed the lesser-known great noir “Ladies in Retirement,” which features the best performance of Ida Lupino’s career. Hopefully his work will soon be rediscovered… it certainly merits a second (or, in many cases, first) look.\n\n“Gilda” remains a great film noir, even though it isn’t your standard noir in any way. Were I to give an introductory class on the genre, this would be one of the films I’d choose, and Hayworth’s work has remained in the zeitgeist since the film’s release (thanks more recently to her poster being in a much different masterpiece, “The Shawshank Redemption”). It’s such a pleasant surprise to find a film that feels fresher today than it did when it was first released, and “Gilda” does just that.\n\nScore: *****\n\nThe Tarsem Odyssey\n\nWriter: Vlas Parlapanides & Charley Parlapanides\n\nCast: Henry Cavill, Mickey Rourke, Freida Pinto, Luke Evans, Stephen Dorff\n\nProducer: Gianni Nunnari, Mark Canton, Ryan Kavanaugh\n\nCinematography: Brendan Galvin\n\nMusic: Trevor Morris\n\nCompany: Relativity Media\n\nRelease: November 11, 2011\n\n“Immortals” is two movies – one of them awful and one of them great. The great version happens if you turn the sound off and take in the film as a visual experience… a silent epic in the vein of “Intolerance” or “Cabiria.” Purely viewed as a visual tone poem, Tarsem succeeds in creating a mood that engages, stuns and is ultimately transcendent.\n\nThe awful version is if the sound is on. Which, unfortunately, is how you’re supposed to watch the film.\n\nOur main character is Theseus (Henry Cavill), who has been chosen by the god Zeus (Luke Evans) to fight for humanity since the gods cannot interfere with man. Or something. Theseus is trying to take down King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke), who needs some magical bow to unleash the Titans, who are vanquished gods held prisoner in a box. Or something. Theseus is teamed up with an Oracle named Phaedra (Frida Pinto) and Stavros (Stephen Dorff) because… stuff.\n\nLook, I’m going to be bluntly honest and say nothing in the movie makes sense. Not a single character motivation. Not a single decision by a major or supporting character. Not a single moment directly tied into the Greek mythology this story is purportedly based upon.\n\nNothing.\n\nAnd yet the screenplay keeps marching forward with purpose, hoping no one notices. And because Tarsem makes everything surrounding these awful characters so visually engaging and epic, it’s very easy to stop focusing on what’s happening onscreen and instead focusing on all the pretty. Yes, the only way it works is to approach every moment as an island unto itself, completely broken off from the rest of the film.\n\nThen again, even those individual moments sometimes aren’t great, thanks for the most part to a bunch of heinous dialogue by Vlas Parlapanides and Charley Parlapanides (who didn’t pen another film until 2017’s “Death Note.” Sounds about right.). Apparently ancient Greeks loved their puns, because seconds before Hyperion lights someone on fire, he says “Let me enlighten you, priest.” After a Monk chops off his tongue to prevent himself from telling Hyperion some important somethingorother, Hyperion says this howler: “A monk can be made to talk with or without his tongue.” Had this been a silent film, I wouldn’t have had to listen to lines like that. But alas…\n\nLet’s talk about the characters, I guess.\n\nTheseus is looked down on by his community because he is a bastard, and yet refuses to move from the very dangerous cliffside where he lives because…uh… He lives with his mother, who smiles early in the film, which seals her fate of dying horribly in front of Theseus. Even after that happens, Theseus’ motivation to avenge her death doesn’t really come into play until almost an hour into this two-hour film. That’s right, there is no narrative drive for our hero for an hour. Apparently Theseus is important because he’s Zeus’ favorite, and can protect humanity or whatever, and part of that means keeping this magical bow out of the hands of Hyperion. Is there any amazing quest to find said bow? Nope, Theseus literally just happens upon it by accident in a catacomb. Also, I think Zeus may have bet on the wrong horse, because Theseus seems physically incapable of not dropping the bow at very important moments. After he finds the bow, he drops it after 43 seconds of screentime. And that’s only the first of his gaffes. Maybe Theseus’ hands were extra slick from oiling up his eight pack?\n\nSpeaking of that eight pack, I really hope one day Cavill gets an opportunity to show that he is more than his rockin’ bod. His performance here is adrift, and his physicality in the action has no interest either. Understandable on both counts, but still a shame.\n\nTheseus still comes off way better than Pinto’s Phaedra, who is yikes. When we first meet her, she smiles devilishly and says “I’m stronger than I look.” Subsequently, she abandons her best friends to their death needlessly, does nothing remotely strong in any action sequence except be in danger, hands her virginity to a man she met two days before, then disappears for the entirety of the film’s third act. I bring up her having sex not to slut shame, but because as an oracle she can only see past the curtain when she is a virgin, and instead of waiting a week for the war to end… a week where she could have seen a lot of incredibly valuable information about the enemy… she hands away her gift to a man who may well end up teaming up with the enemy (according to one of her visions). Like I said, yikes.\n\nThat said, Pinto excels in the one human moment in the script, where she tells Theseus he must give his mother a proper burial “not because you believe, but because she believes.” It’s so sweet and Pinto gives such weight to it that you wish she had more (well, anything) to work with elsewhere.\n\nRourke was in the middle of his “cast as the villain in everything” era, just like Christoph Waltz, Michael Shannon and Javier Bardem. He must have watched Marlon Brando in “Apocalypse Now” forty times as his only research, because in literally every scene before the finale, he is either eating things in a disgusting manner or playing with water for no reason at all. Every. Single. Scene. I wish I could say he brings any real danger or menace to the role, but I can’t. All I got from it was that he was never taught proper table manners and liked going “splish splash” like a big boy.\n\nThe screenwriters aim to make Zeus dignified, making him appear to be a hero instead of the asshole cheating rapist douchebag he really is in Greek mythology, which is certainly a decision. Evans tries to conjure up a lot of power when he says things like “we must not interfere in the affairs of man!” even though his character has been doing just that for decades by training Theseus from childhood for battle. To do this, he dresses up as John Hurt (no one would guess!) and gives Theseus insight like the following: “It’s not about living as such, Theseus. It’s about living rightly.” Oy.\n\nOther characters are introduced with much fanfare to disappear for most of the film, only to be dispatched in seconds near the finale. The most egregious of these is Joseph Morgan’s Lysander, who is a soldier who betrays the Athenians to become one of Hyperion’s men. In thanks, Hyperion scratches his face open and takes a sledgehammer to his balls. Yes, you read that right. After this, Lysander all but disappears, coming back for approximately eight seconds in the final battle and barely getting a line out before he is murdered.\n\nLet’s talk about that finale. The Athenians are on one side of this big wall while Hyperion’s soldiers are on the other about to break through. Hyperion has the bow now and, instead of firing a bunch of arrows to bring down the wall, he fires a single arrow that opens up a tunnel about as wide as a two-car garage for his men to storm through and be picked off. If he was going to do this, why did he have his soldiers line up almost a mile wide across the horizon before the battle? Because it would look awesome in the trailer, of course!\n\nAll of the above said, I do not dislike “Immortals.” It has too many great things in it to be a bust. Do I wish that Tarsem had a different screenplay… written by anyone else… to interpret? Yes. But I don’t think Tarsem really cared about the story he was telling more than giving us amazing imagery along the way. I mean, just look at that opening, with the trapped Titans in their box, their jaws clamped down on metal, awake and eager to escape their prison. That’s an awesome way to open a movie… certainly the best of Tarsem’s filmography so far. And don’t even get me started on the Bronze Bull, which actually gave me a nightmare the first time I watched the movie. Tarsem frames almost every major sequence either on a cliff or on some high precipice. At a certain point our heroes wander through the desert for whole minutes of screen time to escape cliffs, and finally arrive at… different cliffs! That said, the way he and his cinematographer Brendan Galvin (who Tarsem would re-team with for “Mirror Mirror” and “Self/Less”) frame those cliffs is breathtaking at least for the first 20 times.\n\nAnd the final battle between the Titans and the gods is a stunning action set-piece, using CGI and 3D (I saw it in 3D in theaters opening weekend and it was one of the best iterations of the technology I’ve ever seen) brilliantly. Blood, gore and body-parts go everywhere in various combinations we have never seen before. It’s gross, but it’s weirdly a work of art too.\n\nAnd that final image of Theseus at war in the heavens, with all of the Immortals battling on different planes is one of the most indelible of his entire career – newer action films with mythological elements like “Wonder Woman” have tried similar things to lesser effect. It’s just a wow moment in the best possible way, and leaves you walking out of the theater on a high.\n\nTarsem’s muse Eiko Ishioka provides amazing costume work, per usual. Theseus and Phaedra are given pretty designs, but Ishioka really excels with the military uniforms, Hyperion’s crazy hat and the amazing, amazing (so amazing I said it twice) god work. Each god has a headpiece that helps define him or her and nothing much else, but that’s enough to make a huge impact.\n\nThis was also Tarsem’s first time collaborating with composer Trevor Morris, who he would re-team with for “Emerald City.” Morris was obviously given the missive to compose a score like one of the myriad of other interchangeable ones coming out from Hans Zimmer’s Remote Control Productions, but here exceeds all expectations with some great themes and wonderful action writing.\n\nWhen “Immortals” was released in 2011, most reviewers drew a straight line between it and 2006’s action blockbuster “300,” which retold the story of a small group of Spartans battling the entire Persian army with much visual bombast. And while I have written many words about how “The Cell” and “The Fall” were unfairly critically connected with other films, I make no such excuses for “Immortals.” It obviously only exists because of “300,” and several sequences and aspects were shoehorned in because they wanted to capture the same feel and get the same audience.\n\nI like “300” a lot, and must admit that it is a better film than “Immortals,” simply because the story is more engaging and straightforward. That film’s hero, Leonidas (Gerard Butler), has a clear motivation throughout, as opposed to Theseus, who flounders about looking for something to kill for most of the running time. That said, the special effects from “300” have not aged well, whereas the effects in “Immortals” still hold up better than most blockbusters released today.\n\nIt was a modest hit, grossing over $225 million on a $75 million budget, a number roughly half of what “300” earned several years prior. Talk of a sequel was bandied about for a few weeks before disappearing, and it seems as if the film has lived the rest of its life in those deep $3.50 DVD bins at Wal Mart. There’s no cult following to be found, and it doesn’t seem like it’s going to attract one any time soon.\n\nReviewers were understandably lukewarm. Reading them today, I’m actually surprised they didn’t go harder on the movie. The reviews are near-universal in their praise for Tarsem’s visuals (oh, and the costumes) and dismissive of just about everything else. Roger Ebert, who awarded Tarsem’s first two films four stars each gave this two stars, hilariously declaring in his opening line “’Immortals’ is without doubt the best-looking awful movie you will ever see.”\n\nWhat more can you add to that?"
