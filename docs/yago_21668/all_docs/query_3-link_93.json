        "text": "Osage orange, or Maclura pomifera, is a thorny tree found throughout the state of Missouri. Also referred to as horse apple, hedge apple, and Bois d'Arc, the Osage is easily recognized by its large, green, lumpy fruits. The controversial Osage orange has a long, valuable history with a potentially useful future for many property owners. Here's what to know about Osage orange trees.\n\nOsage Orange Trees Have a History of Friend and Foe\n\nThe Osage orange tree is not native to Missouri. Instead, it originates from southern Oklahoma, western Arkansas, and areas of east Texas. The tree came to grow in all parts of those states, but it was first found near Osage Native American settlements.\n\nOsage Orange Trees as Friend\n\nThe early Native Americans esteemed the tree for its excellent wood, which made superior hunting bows. The tree wood was useful for war clubs, tomahawk handles, rope, and tannin.\n\nEarly settlers and pioneers found the wood of the Osage orange tree incredibly useful as well. The strength of its wood helped create valuable wagon wheel rims and hubs. As the frontier expanded, so too did the knowledge of the famous tree wood. Soon Osage orange trees were made into railroad ties and telegraph poles.\n\nFinally, prairie settlers in the 1800s discovered Osage orange trees made the perfect hedge tree. Osage trees could grow into dense, thorny hedges to act as a fence to help keep cattle and other animals at bay. In 1879, Monroe County had an incredible 2,000 miles of Osage orange hedge rows.\n\nOsage Orange Trees as Foe\n\nBarbed wire became a cheap fence replacement in 1874, and the popularity of Osage trees quickly faded. Farmers and other property owners now viewed the tree as a liability rather than an asset. Osage orange trees needed trimming to help retain their hedge shape and to prevent uncontrolled spread. The trees also stole valuable water from crop land.\n\nLastly, the evolution of farming into a larger scale required the removal of the restrictive rows of Osage orange tree hedges.\n\nOsage Orange Trees Can Still Serve a Purpose\n\nOsage orange trees continue to grow in the wild and can be found in the few occasional remains of hedge rows. While some view the tree as an intruder to vast, open prairie lands, others feel their growth should be encouraged. Recent movements aim to plant more Osage orange trees.\n\nProperty owners may still find the trees to be useful. Many homeowners prefer to grow Osage orange trees in rows rather than shrubs to create a hedge. Their trunks are short and tend to branch off into multiple limbs. The right amount of trimming encourages the trees to grow in a thick, bushy manner — the ideal hedge. Additionally, the thorns of the Osage tree may halt unwanted intruders.\n\nOsage orange trees can grow in a variety of soil types but need full sun. The tree is a good choice for a hedge tree because of its relatively quick growth — up to two feet each year. If your property is larger, Osage oranges also make an effective wind barrier to help block frigid winter winds.\n\nOsage orange trees can be prickly to work with, and the fruit produces a white sap. You may want to have a professional deal with pruning and trimming if you don't want to tangle with this infamous tree. An expert will be better equipped to shape the trees to the desired hedge formation.\n\nBaumann Tree is your source for tree experts if you ever need to care for or remove Osage orange trees from your property.
