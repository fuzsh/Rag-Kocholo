        "text": "Refreshing and vibrant flavor bombs of juicy sweetness, oranges are a prized winter fruit. Enjoy them by the segment or wedge (and do your best Don Corleone impression), drink their juice, spin them into marmalade, bake or roast them...even eat their sunshine-colored peel! There's more than meets the eye when this beautiful fruit is ripe for the picking. Here's your comprehensive guide to oranges!\n\nScientific name: Citrus sinensis (sweet oranges) or Citrus aurantium (bitter oranges)\n\nFamily of fruit: Rutaceae\n\nHow did it get its name? The name of this citrus fruit comes from the Persian noun for orange trees, narang. It wasn't until 1600 that the word, which became orenge in old French, was used as an adjective to describe a color.\n\nHow many varietals are there? Over 400, including Blood, , , , Seville, and Valencia.\n\nWhere do oranges grow? Florida, California, Brazil, northern and eastern Mediterranean countries, Australia, and South Africa.\n\nWhen are they in season? December through March.\n\nHow to pick the perfect orange: Feel for a firm, heavy orange with brightly colored smooth skin.\n\nHow to ripen an orange: Once picked, oranges do not further ripen.\n\nStorage: Refrigerating oranges will extend their shelf life by about two weeks. Bringing them back to room temperature will yield the most juice, however.\n\nShould you wash them? Yes, this prevents any bacteria from seeping into the flesh once sliced.\n\nWhat should oranges taste like? Cultivated oranges taste sweet, or sweet-tart. Wild oranges are very bitter.\n\nCan you eat the skin? Yes, which is why you should wash an orange.
