        "text": "The Mark of Zorro, starring Douglas Fairbanks and directed by Fred Niblo in 1920, is a triumphant piece of film-making and a seminal turning point in moving making history. The film was based on the 1919 story, The Curse of Capistrano, by Johnston McCulley. The relation of Zorro to The Scarlet Pimpernel, is unmistakable, the similarities of plot devices for the respective story-lines are transparent. McCulley, using a formula of a masked avenger (which was a favorite depiction of his) from his own writing history and adding other elements of The Scarlet Pimpernel, he created a character that now is an icon of American fiction, movies and television.\n\nThe scenario for The Mark of Zorro was penned by Elton Thomas; and If not known before, by the general public or the exhibitors about the true identity of scenarist, Thomas, the cat was definitely let out of the bag in March of 1924. The Film Daily announced “By this you must guess that Elton Thomas, author of ‘The Thief of Bagdad,’ and Douglas Fairbanks are one and the same.”[1] And The Film Daily continued by listing Mr. Fairbanks in parenthesis after that of Elton Thomas, for writing credit for, The Thief of Bagdad.[2] With the production of The Gaucho, in 1927, the copyright holder was The Elton Corporation,[3] and Variety was quick to note for their readers that Elton Thomas was “none other than Doug,” as Fairbanks was affectionately known.[4]\n\nMany authorities on film history, ascribe nearly twenty scenarios, stories and screenplays to Douglas Fairbanks, gathered from his alter egos of Elton Thomas and Elton Banks; yet, according to a book by Frederic Lombardi, director-writer-producer, Allan Dawn, attributed works written by Elton Thomas as a collaborative effort by as many as twenty people, including Douglas Fairbanks.[5] It appears then that Elton Thomas functioned as a pseudonym for a ‘collective,’ whether they were assigned, or as Lombardi intimated, many times the writers were circumstantially involved, or in other words, whoever happened to be there was welcome to put their ‘two-cents’ in.\n\nThe Mark of Zorro came in at seven-thousand-eight-hundred feet, or eighty-seven minutes;[7] a torridly paced film, with the action sequences edited to full advantage. MOZ did great business, by all accounts a complete financial success, if not a total critical sensation. Yet, Doug must have been pleased, for the real the critics, the movie-goers, flocked to see, the masked-Fox, with all the tumbles, the flipping, the climbing, and the sword-fighting!\n\nThe film’s debut was chosen to be at the Capitol Theatre, in NYC, with the official premier on Saturday, November 27, 1920, although there is some confusion as to the opening date, for in a New York Tribune advertisement, dated November 27, for the Capitol Theatre, the ad clearly states beginning tomorrow, Sunday, November 28 [8]; this account agrees with box office information released stating that the opening day was November 28.\n\nAt the Capitol Theatre on Thanksgiving weekend, in New York City, on Sunday, November 28, 1920 (the general release was set for December 5, 1920), all house attendance records were broken. With nine-thousand-five-hundred-forty-seven seeing The Mark of Zorro, and collecting $11,706.23; by the way, not only was this considered the Capitol Theatre record, but a world’s record for any single theatre for any single day. November 28, was not the only record breaker, Monday, November 29, was the biggest, non-holiday Monday in the Capitol Theatre’s history.[9] But the box-office records were not done falling to the sway of The Mark of Zorro, for the one-week showing at the Capitol Theatre, MOZ had 94,501 paid admissions, while taking in $48,103.43, which was another world’s record.[10] One small ‘fly in the ointment’ for the celebration of the box-office phenomenon that was The Mark of Zorro, was a German release, entitled, Passion, starring Pola Negri; it quickly (by the middle of December) broke the records which MOZ had set.[11]\n\nThe Mark of Zorro, with its original musical score, is available on DVD. Have a great, rousing time!\n\nBy C. S. Williams\n\n[1] The Film Daily, March 20, 1924\n\n[2] The Film Daily, March 23, 1924\n\n[3] The Elton Corporation had their offices at 15 W. 42nd St., Manhattan, New York; The Brooklyn Daily Eagle\n\n(Brooklyn, New York) December 28, 1931\n\n[4] Variety (New York, New York) November 9, 1927\n\n[5] Allan Dawn and the Rise and Decline of the Holly Studios, by Frederic Lombardi, McFarland &\n\nCompany Inc., Publishers, 2013, pages, 90, 162, 163, 336, 338,\n\n[6] The Film Daily, March 23, 1924\n\n[7] Exhibitors Trade Review, December 3, 1921\n\n[8] New York Tribune (New York, New York) November 27, 1920\n\n[9] Exhibitors Herald, December 18, 1920\n\n[10] Exhibitors Herald, January 1, 1921\n\n[11] Exhibitors Herald, January 1, 1921\n\nAs far as the Golden-Age of Hollywood is concerned, Claudia, for me, is the best that Tinseltown has to offer, with regards to the relationship of marriage. Few films so brilliantly weave the marriage of the drama and comedy of life together any better than Claudia. My wife and I view this little masterpiece one or two times a year, and in each viewing is found a delicate dainty to savor, pleasing to the palette, offering new layers of experience with each and every offering.\n\nBehind the scenes:\n\nEdmund Goulding (Dark Victory, 1939, The Constant Nymph, 1943, Of Human Bondage, and The Razor’s Edge, 1946) took the director’s chair, Alfred Newman (with over five-hundred musical credits in film making: The Song of Bernadette, 1943, Call Northside 777, 1948, Anastasia, 1956 ) wrote the score. Morrie Ryskind (worked on four Marx Brother’s projects, had only twenty credits) adapted the play by Rose Franken, for the screen.\n\nLeon Shamroy who seemed to work very well (Made for Each Other, and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, 1939, Down Argentine Way, 1940, Moon over Miami, 1941) within the confines of a sound-stage, photographed the film; Claudia, needing little exterior footage and since the project did not utilize tracking shots, continuous scenes, or innovative camera work, Shamroy provided what cinematographic expertise was required. Whit his cinematography in, Leave Her to Heaven (Gene Tierney and Cornel Wilde at their best), Shamroy began a new portion of his photographic career, with longer, emotional establishing shots, which became very nice touches for such films as Twelve O’Clock High, 1949, The Snows of Kilimanjaro, 1952, The Robe, 1953 and Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing, 1955. Mr. Shamroy used his sound-stage knowledge and his ability to film intimacy from a distance in, There’s No Business Like Show Business, The King and I, 1956, and South Pacific in 1958.\n\nRobert L. Simpson, editor supreme, applied the razor-blade for Claudia, snipping here and there, keeping this filming of the stage-play, a nice tight package. Simpson, cut for director John Ford on, Drums Along the Mohawk, 1939, The Grapes of Wrath, 1940, he also polished up Miracle on 34th Street, 1947, A Man Called Peter, 1955. Often, cinematographer Leon Shamroy and Simpson worked on the same productions.\n\nOf course in a piece like Claudia, the art, settings and costumes are all important, all becoming characters in the movie. Such was the task assigned to art directors James Basevi and Albert Hogsett; Basevi worked in the film-industry for thirty years, Wuthering Heights, 1939, The Long Voyage Home, 1940, The Lodger, 1944. While Hogsett handled those duties in some of the Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto series-films, and such projects as, Western Union, 1941, The Enemy Below, 1957.\n\nPaul S. Fox and Thomas Little decorated the sets for Claudia; this was just Fox’s second movie, he added such classics as Gentleman’s Agreement, 1947, David and Bathsheba, 1951, Bus Stop, 1956, to his profile. Little, had his hand in almost five-hundred films in just over twenty years, including, King Kong [uncredited], 1933, Kidnapped, 1938, Boomerang!, 1947 and Don’t Bother to Knock, 1952. The costumes were by Bonnie Cashin and René Hubert; this was Cashin’s first work in Hollywood, later providing costumes for, Laura, 1944, Anna and the King of Siam, 1946, The Snake Pit, in 1948. Hubert designed for over one-hundred productions, a couple of standouts were: Heaven Can Wait, 1943 and My Darling Clementine, 1946.\n\nClaudia is available on DVD, by M. O. D. (manufactured on demand) from, Fox Connect.\n\nIn front of the camera:\n\nDorothy McGuire (Claudia Naughton; reprising her Broadway role, film debut)\n\nRobert Young (David Naughton; he and McGuire would star in The Enchanted Cottage, 1945)\n\nIna Claire (Mrs. Brown; her next to last film, she made just twelve)\n\nReginald Gardiner (Jerry Seymour; he appeared in twenty-three movies in the 1940’s)\n\nOlga Baclanova (Madame Daruschka; she and McGuire were the only Claudia on Broadway holdovers)\n\nJean Howard (Julia; she made just one more movie after Claudia)\n\nFrank Tweddell (Fritz; just eight films to his credit, two being Claudia and the sequel: Claudia and David)\n\nElsa Janssen (Bertha; a lot of maids and mommas roles, in her twenty-five flicks)\n\nBy C. S. Williams\n\nBlanche Galton was born in March of 1845 (she married actor Thomas Whiffen on July 11, 1868[1]), daughter of Mary Pyne-Galton, her sister was Susan (who married Alfred Kelleher) their aunt was Louisa Pyne .[2]\n\nThe whole family emigrated from England, and soon after their arrival, Mr. and Mrs. Whiffen (Mrs. Whiffen was still being billed as Blanch Galton, and this would continue as late as 1880, then taking her married name[3]) appeared in Offenbach’s opera, 56, the production included Susan Galton and the young ladies’ mother Mrs. Pyne-Galton.[4]\n\nIn 1878, Mrs. Whiffen had the distinction of playing the character of Buttercup in the original American (albeit pirated production) premier of Gilbert & Sullivan’s, H. M. S. Pinafore, in the Old Duff Opera Company, in New York City. Original might be too strong of a word, for Mrs. Whiffen recounted that there were six companies staging Pinafore at the same time as the Old Duff.[5]\n\nNovember of 1881 began the run of Esmeralda, by Francis Hodgson Burnett, adapted by W. H. Gillette, staged at the Madison Square Theater, in New York City; the play would last nigh unto a year and the couple would go with the road production as well.\n\nThe Grand Old Lady of the theater (as Mrs. Whiffen was known) was indeed just that, appearing with all the luminaries of that era: Annie Russell, De Wolfe Hopper, Georgia Cayvan and Effie Ellsler; just a small sampling of those of whom Whiffen shared the stage with.[6] In January of 1901, she was in support of Ethel Barrymore, in Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines, at the Lyceum Theatre in Scranton, Pennsylvania.[7] 1902, December, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Mrs. Wiffen appeared in The Wilderness, as the ‘stage mother.’[8] In Washington, D. C., in the month of February, 1911, Mrs. Wiffen was seen at the National Theatre, as Mrs. Bedloe, in U. S. Minister Bedloe.[9] On November 21, 1917, Mrs. Wiffen celebrated (while in Chicago) her Jubilee in acting ; her debut was in 1867, when she appeared in London, in Turco, The Terrible, in the role of a fairy.[10]\n\nMrs. Blanche Galton-Wiffen had roles in more than forty Broadway productions. Her first was Marriage by Lanterns, 1868, her last, Just Fancy, 1927.\n\nShe made just two films, Hearts and Flowers, 1914, and Barbara Frietchie, 1915, and great ado was made for these two ventures into photoplays by her. Both films were released at the end of November, separated by three-hundred-sixty-three days. Each film fits into the category of either lost or survival status unknown.\n\nFor a real pleasure of a ‘one of a kind life,’ before the footlights, read Mrs. Thomas Whiffen’s autobiography, Keeping Off the Shelf, E. P. Dutton & Company, INC., 1928; filled with wonderful anecdotes of her stage career and beautiful portraits of those people in her life. She included a marvelous chapter on Mr. Whiffen, who was acquainted with Charles Dickens, and how the two gentlemen met; quite a man, quite a woman, and most definitely an engrossing story.

Vultures was three-reels, and came in at 3,000 feet; about thirty-three minutes.[1] The Swedish release did not occur until January of 1916, it was a three-reel film, but it came in just a little longer than the American presentation, at 3,228 feet, almost thirty-six minutes.[2] On a casual internet search, the seeker will find differing lengths from as much as fifty-one minutes, forty-five minutes, and forty-eight minutes and every running time that does not match the actual footage.\n\nThe film saw numerous titles, including: Sea Eagle, Predators of the Sea, Seaside Secret, Mystery of Open Seas, and Sea Vultures. The script title was Smuggler’s Daughter or a Drama at Sea, based upon the 1842, novel, Rosen på Tistelön: Berättelse från skärgården (The Rose of Tistelon: a Tale of the Swedish Coast) by Emilie Flygare-Carlén, adapted for the screen by Fritz Magnussen. Famed director-actor Victor Sjöström, directed this thriller. Nils Elffors not only had a part (Anton) in the production but acted as the film’s unit-manager[3] and according to the Internet Movie Data Base provided the special-effects, as well.\n\nThe exterior filming was done on location in Sweden at Lidingö and Landsort.[4] Landsort, is on the island Öja, and a primary feature is a lighthouse. Lidingö is an island in the inner Stockholm archipelago and is situated just east of Stockholm.\n\nThe film saw its release in early January of 1915; unfortunately little or no advertising was afforded at the local level. Announcements typically were one line, no display ads, could I find. The critical reception in the States and in Sweden, was cool, of course the scenery was unanimously touted as beautiful (Henrik Jaenzon, was the cinematographer). According to the Washington Times, dated November 29, 2006, The Vultures of the Coast survives and was shown at the National Gallery of Art, Washington D. C., on December 30, 2006, at 2:00 PM.\n\nThe Vultures of the Coast, Synopsis:\n\nThe Vultures of the Coast – Apex – (Three Reels). – Robert Green, son of a poor fisherman, loves Eleanor, daughter of the owner of the ship Vennus, and the father, desiring to marry his daughter to another, persuades Robert to sign for a six months’ cruise aboard the Vennus. Some weeks later news is brought that the vessel has been lost with all hands, and at the same time Mr. Johnstone, pressing a bill for $10,000 against Eleanor’s father, offers to cancel the debt if Eleanor will marry his son. Believing Robert dead, she consents. Meanwhile, Robert, the only survivor of the Vennus, is discovered by some smugglers and taken to their cave on a desolate island. One day when the yacht of a millionaire visits the place, and his child is kidnapped by the smugglers, Robert rescues the child and receives a reward of $10,000. He arrives at home the day Eleanor is to be married, and at the sight of him the girl refuses to proceed with the wedding. Robert produces his check for $10,000, which he gives to Eleanor’s father, thereby enabling the latter to cancel his indebtedness to Johnstone, when Robert and Eleanor are happily married.[5]\n\nAs we can see from below, the Swedish synopsis is quite a bit different…\n\nOur story begins in a village on the west coast of Sweden, there we find Mr. Hornung, a merchant, who is not above smuggling to fill his coffers; the merchant has three children, Birger, Anton and Gabriele. He and his eldest son, Birger, offer ₤50,000 to smuggle precious cargo on the vessel: Vennus. His youngest son Anton overhears the deal and asks to go along; his father denies him. But Anton hides aboard the ship, defying the order of his father, Hornung.\n\nMeanwhile Lieutenant Tullöjtnant Arnold (he has a son named Arvid), the areas’ Customs Chief, becomes aware that something is not right on the ship, and investigates the strange goings-on. Arnold confronts Hornung and his son Birger when they return to port; with gun loaded, Arnold enters the Vennus, but is overcome by the two Hornungs, with Arnold going overboard, dead! Anton Hornung, from his secretive vantage point witnesses the murder, of which he will be haunted for years to come. The two men gather up Arnold’s gun, so as not to leave any evidence.\n\nFlash forward fifteen years and Mrs. Arnold and her son Arvid return from her childhood home, where they sought solace and peace after the loss of husband-father, Tullöjtnant Arnold. Mr. Hornung, Birger and Anton are all marked by the murder, in their own particular ways; Hornung’s daughter is now a beautiful young woman. Upon returning the Arnolds send a letter to Mr. Hornung, warning him that Arvid is seeking revenge for his father’s death.\n\nOne day while at the harbor Arvid Arnold and the merchant Hornung and his daughter, meet-up and the smuggler-murderer, faints straight away. Arvid and Gabriele tend to the old man; it seems to be love at first sight for Arvid and Gabriele. Later, while Hornung is recovering he sees the ghost of Tullöjtnant Arnold. Anton is also disturbed, for Arvid’s presence prods the memories of that horrible day for Anton.\n\nOld man Hornung and Birger Hornung are disgusted by Arvid being involved with Gabriele, clearly, the couple wants to marry. But Hornung has other plans, he wants Gabriele to wed their accomplice (Johnstone in the American version; un-named in the Swedish) in the smuggling venture, the man who arranges the missions.\n\nOne evening while Gabriele visited Arvid and Mrs. Arnold, Anton overhears his father and brother planning a new mission for contraband. Anton sneaks to the Arnold home to warn Arvid not to follow Hornung and Birger. But the warning falls on deaf ears and Arvid and Gabriele go aboard the ship. Arvid discovers the two men hiding smuggled goods on an island, yet, Arvid has no evidence; it is his word against theirs. Hornung and Birger force Gabriele to go home with them. Once Anton, understands what has happened, he decides to help his sister. In the Hornung attic, Anton locates Tullöjtnant Arnold’s gun, and writes a letter to the sheriff alerting the officials that they will find the weapon in the Hornung family loft.\n\nThe police and Arvid begin the search for the smuggler-murders, and they follow the trail back to the island. Hornung intends to burn the illegal goods, but first rolls a stone to cover the entrance to cave and conceal their doings. This in turn retains the smoke, and suffocates the two criminals. Gabriele not to be left out of the confrontation rows a dingy to the island, she, coming to the knowledge that her father and oldest brother are dead falls weeping on to Arvid’s shoulders. He takes her in his arms, caressing her; the screen darkens… the end.[6]\n\nThe Cast and the Characters:\n\nRichard Lund (appearing in two roles) (Lieutenant Tullöjtnant Arnold, the Customs Chief and Arvid Arnold/Robert Green, his son)\n\nRasmus Rasmussen (Hornung/Johns, a merchant)\n\nGreta Almroth (Gabriele/Eleanor Hornung, the merchant’s daughter)\n\nJohn Ekman (Birger, the merchant’s son)\n\nNils Elffors (Anton/ younger son of the merchant Hornung)\n\nJenny Tschernichin-Larsson (Mrs. Arnold/Mrs. Green mother of Robert Arnold/ Robert Green)\n\nThe following performers were uncredited:\n\nThure Holm (Sherriff)\n\nErland Colliander (Deputy Sherriff)[7]\n\nBy C.

S.\n\n[7] The Swedish Film Institute\n\nHugh Allan, AKA Hugh Allen, it is difficult to ascertain exactly when Allan was born, he listed his birth date differently throughout his life (hum, it’s as though this is a recurring theme in movie-land?), keeping the same date of November 5, but changing the year, as suited him, I guess? On different censuses, immigration lists for sailing, and publications he gave his birth-year as 1903, 1904, 1905… you get the picture. So we will simply go with what is on his headstone: 1903. In April of 1925, Allan was signed to play the leading man in Little Annie Rooney, starring Mary Pickford; not only signed, but Pickford personally selected him.[1] Clearly Allan missed the boat with Little Annie Rooney (mega hit for Pickford) and William Haines sailed away in the role of Joe Kelly. According to Allan himself, the following story of his broken arm was apocryphal,[2] and was issued to cover up a disagreement between Jack Pickford and himself: “Mr. Allan decided to celebrate the good news of being picked by Pickford, for Little Annie Rooney, by buying a new radio; while adjusting for a better signal on the roof (yes, those were the days), he fell off of the roof and broke his arm and changed casting history.”[3]\n\n1929 had ‘very special’ written all over it for Hugh Allan, he had met reporter Catherine (Cathryn) Hoffman (she was interviewing him) the summer before, in Miami, Florida;[4] the two hit it off and were engaged and planning a 1929, June wedding.[5] But for some un-announced reason the wedding did not happen. In the autumn of 1930 Hoffman landed a job with the Miami News, as an ‘imbedded-reporter’ in Hollywood.[6] Most of her articles were fluff-work with some diary reports added in; as well, Hoffman appears to have gotten walk-on (uncredited, unlisted) work on a few films, Only Saps Work, released December 6, 1930, is the subject of one piece.[7] And her hand was used in Three Rogues, 1931, starring Victor McLaglen and Fay Wray.[8] Probably this Hollywood correspondent got her real start with that Hugh Allan interview and romance; yet her fame was confined to the Miami area and was short-lived.\n\nOctober 26 of 1929 was the beginning of the end for Hugh Allan with regards to Hollywood. He had not married Catherine Hoffman, and now unbeknownst to him he was setting sail on a one way trip from the movie-making industry. Allan had contracted to film in Hawaii, with the S.S. Calawali being his transport. The ship arrived in Honolulu on November 2, 1929 and once there the production (Aloha) hit financial ‘rock-bottom;’ according to Allan, the director and producer put on a show for the actors by continuing the appearance of filming with no film in the cameras. This burnt Allan to the core, he went back to California on the S.S. City of Honolulu on November 30, 1929 and arrived in Los Angeles on December 4, promptly quitting the film business, thoroughly disturbed by the lack of character which he had seen.[9] Hugh Allan and co-star of Aloha, Gladys McConnell, filed a complaint against producer Eska Wilson; Wilson was arrested and released without bail.[10]\n\nWait a moment! If that is the truth, that Allan was through with films, then how do we explain a missing title? There is at the least one missing movie from Allan’s résumé and this is a post Hawaii production, which is the July 3, 1930 release, Holiday, directed by Edward H. Griffith.[11] The next unlisted (after the Hawaii disappointment) film is a two-reel comedy, Silence is Golden (announced at the same point as A Royal Flush), 1930.[12] Allan was shooting Silence is Golden in March of 1930, at Columbia Studios and was just one of a series of short-subjects being made.[13] One could make the assumption that when Aldous Huxley wrote his essay Silence is Golden, reprinted in Golden Book Magazine, for their April of 1930 edition, that he was writing a review (most refer to this piece as a specific-film commentary); Silence is Golden was originally published in a collection of essays with the title of: Do What You Will, 1929. That Huxley was writing a review of Silence is Golden is not likely, the piece is more about his dislike of talkies and that silent-movies are golden.[14] Silence is Golden not only is missing from Hugh Allan’s profile, but is not listed for Columbia. The short comedy is mentioned in an Indiana newspaper as Allan having the juvenile lead, and that he provoked laughs in both Silence is Golden and The Royal Flush.[15] This snippet about Silence is Golden was included in the Screen Gossip section, Hollywood, California, dated April 30, 1930.\n\nBut now I move beyond whether Allan ended his acting career in 1929 or 1930 and I want to introduce another possible film lost from Mr. Allan’s work history, the independently produced Love Harmony, 1930.[16] Shot at Tec-Art Studios and an Exeltone Productions project (possibly, Excellent Pictures Corporation?[17]), with director Dallas Fitzgerald at the helm and starring: Hugh Alan, Thelma Hill, Ethlyn Clarie and Lee Moran; they began filming on September 8, 1929.[18] This is a film that has completely dropped off the radar; there is not a trace in any of the film-histories of any of the principal players, nor in the production lists of Exeltone (I can find no information on this company), Tec-Art Studios (it’s main offices were located at 344 West 44th Street, New York City), nor anything in the profile of director Fitzgerald for this film. If Exeltone (Excellent) ran out of funding for this project and left it incomplete, then surly there would still be some further mention, yet, nothing; if this was an Excellent Pictures project, it appears nowhere on any current or upcoming release schedule from 1928-1930 . If you, dear reader, have any information regarding Love Harmony, please contact me at classicfilmaficionados@outlook.com\n\nNow, on to Allan’s post Hollywood career… with no announcement whatsoever, we find Hugh Allan married to Lois (Lou) Williamson, in 1932; they were living in Houston, Texas. By 1940 they had two children Carita (four years of age) and Hugh (one year old). Allan had landed a position as an executive with a whole-sale equipment business, making $5,000.00 per year. The couple lived in New York City, as late as 1935, (Carita was born in NYC) prior to moving to Memphis, Tennessee. This was home for Hugh Allan, the place of his birth. He seemed to thrive in Memphis and in 1943 he was the vice-president of the Rotary Lift Company. By 1954, fortunes turned and Allan was specializing in rebuilding clutches for elevators and eventually becoming the president of an elevator equipment company.[19] Finally, in 1993, Hugh Allan moved into his family’s old home in Memphis on Caraway Cove and spent his final years there.\n\nWith or without the other films that Allan worked on, his career was short and his film appearances can nearly be counted on your fingers and toes.\n\nNigh Unto Two-Bits of an Alan Filmography:\n\nThe Block Signal, 1926\n\nDress Parade, 1927\n\nWild Beauty, 1927\n\nAnnapolis, 1928\n\nThe Fire Detective, 1929\n\nBy C.

Not film royalty, but of stage royals, was Frederick Richard Sullivan (AKA: Frederic Sullivan, Fred Sullivan); son of Fred Sullivan, nephew of Sir Arthur Sullivan[1] of Gilbert and Sullivan comic-operetta fame! He was an actor both on stage and screen, a stock-company manager, writer, producer and he was a film and stage director. And for a candle on top of his birthday-cupcake, he was a composer; he set music to poems by Edgar Allen Poe.[2]\n\nPrior to stage and film work, Sullivan was a newspaper reporter, before spending the better part of fifteen years as stage director. He began his first job in films was with the Reliance Company, in 1912. A large portion of his film résumé is missing, this according to Wid’s Daily, in 1921, in their Director’s edition.[3] That one paragraph notation makes reference to two-hundred-fifty, one and two reel short-subjects. Yet, if we combined all of his known (modern vantage) work (features and shorts, directing, acting, producing and writing), we come up with less than ninety titles, sound and silent. What a loss of film-history.\n\nAs an actor on stage Sullivan found himself on Broadway a few times: Fedora, 1905, The House of a Thousand Candles, 1908, The Grain of Dust, 1912, Room of Dreams, 1930, Midnight, 1931 and Greater Love, 1931.\n\nIn 1900-01, he was part of the supporting cast in Rosemary and The Lottery of Love, and The Gilded Fool, in successive weeks (beginning in December of 1900), at the Lafayette, in Washington, D. C…[4] 1903 had Frederick Sullivan appearing in the role of Sir Horace Plumley, in, When We Were Twenty-one, by H. V. Esmond; the production was staged at the Majestic theatre in Boston, Mass.[5] Staying in Boston, Sullivan supported Nance O’Neil in her company, in the first English performance of The Fires of St. John, by Hermann Sudermann.[6]\n\nAlthough not listed on the Internet Broadway Data Base for The Reckoning, 1907, at the Berkeley Lyceum Theatre, New York City, yet from a playbill we see that he was indeed a co-director with Gustavo Von Seyffertitz. [7]Also he produced and directed, In the Bishop’s Carriage, 1907, which played at the Grand Opera House, NYC.[8]\n\nSullivan was a man with great attention to detail (much as, his uncle was), as is demonstrated on the serial, Zudora, 1914. Point one: Sullivan searched for a document (an integral plot device for the story) that was older and looked authentic; he combed New York City and could not find what he wanted. His solution was to look elsewhere, finally obtaining a portion of a will, which had been filed in Delaware County in 1876… an actual historic paper for a fictional letter. [9] Point two: even though the thread of his story-line involving a circus was but for one short scene, Sullivan, despite expense and time, hired an entire circus for the filming.[10]\n\nSullivan miscellany, in 1922, the Motion Picture Director’s Association, elected Sullivan to be their assistant director.[11]\n\nDuring the week prior to Thanksgiving, in November of1914, while directing Zudora, Frederick Sullivan earned the title of workhorse and taskmaster, in one concerted effort, when he established a Thanhouser production record whilst shooting thirty long-scenes in one work-day![12] I guess he wanted to work up an appetite for Turkey-day?\n\nSullivan partial Filmography as Director:\n\nThe Cat’s Paw, 1914\n\nThe Phantom Witness, 1916\n\nThe Cove of Missing Men, 1918\n\nThe Courtship of Myles Standish, 1923\n\nSullivan partial Filmography as Actor:\n\nThe White Terror, 1915\n\nThe Face on the Bar-Room Floor, 1923\n\nWinds of Chance, 1925\n\nBlind Adventure, 1933\n\nBy C.

The song “Look out for Jimmy Valentine is the reason that Augusta Appel, soon to be ‘Little Cuddles’ was discovered. “Jimmy Valentine” was published in October of 1910, and Edwards saw her outside of a theater, and it was not until he got inside and like a flash the idea of this little girl lying on a piano, while “Look out for Jimmy Valentine” was sung, came to him; he asked Miss Lee’s mother for consent, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nAll did not remain amenable between the Edwards and the Appel families; an April, 1920, legal battle ensued which lasted two weeks, finally awarding custody of Lila Lee once again to her parents, Charles and Augusta Appel of Chicago;[1] Augusta Cuddles Lila Edwards-Lee-Appel had lived with the Edwards for ten years. A month later, guardianship for Lee was appointed to Chicago attorney Philip Sultan.[2] As we explore the early career of Lila Lee we cannot forget that she was still a child, throughout those formative acting years, she learned the art of celluloid acting on the job.\n\nThe next subject I want to tackle is the Lila Lee conundrum: her age. FPL (Famous Players-Lasky) signed the then sixteen-year-old actress in June of 1918.[3] Yet, her given age to the press was fourteen-years, in 1918,[4] eh, I’m lost? Was she 16 or 14? If 14 then she was born in 1904, but her date of birth on file is 1901 or 1902? Any birth-date earlier than 1903 would have made the custody between the Edwards and Appels moot; we will consider 1901 and 1902 as Ms. Lee attempting to pass herself off as older. In a newspaper article in December of 1912 her age is listed as seven[5] and her discovery by Gus Edwards when she was five? If Lee was five when discovered in 1910, then she was born in 1905? Which would make her? Total confusion! Even her own personal statements (this could be a common trait in Hollywood) make the process of finding her true age difficult. In the 1930 Federal Census, she listed her birth year as 1906; we would continue confused as to her real age excepting that she married James Kirkwood July 25, 1905, on her eighteenth birthday.[6] She was a star from the get-go! Top billing amongst the children on the vaudeville circuit, was the norm. She continued her vaudeville appearances through April of 1918, and then as stated above, Ms. Appel contracted with FPL, no later than the first week of June, 1918;[7] taking the name of Lila Lee.\n\nAt first glance it appears Ms. Lee may have been in the pre-Broadway production of Common Clay (penned by Cleves Kinkead), which played in Atlantic City, in August of 1915,[8] but, it is more reasonable to believe that the actress was Ms. Lela Lee, and not Lila Lee, listed in the trial-run of the Harvard award-winning play; accepting this as a misprint jibes well with the Broadway run of Common Clay where Lela Lee is in the cast. Lela Lee retired from the stage in January of 1916, after marrying Samuel Hoffenstein; the new Mrs. Hoffenstein left the cast of Common Clay, being succeeded by Ruth Boyd.[9]\n\nIn July of 1918 the preparation for her first appearance was laid down, with a nice piece in Film Fun magazine, where The Cruise of the Make-Believes is not called her first movie but One Hundred Per Cent American (a WWI Bond-Campaign film);[10] obviously plans changed for Lee’s role in this Liberty Loan Drive[11] movie, we see not hide nor hair of her in this 1 ½ reel short-patriotic-subject.\n\nWhen taking notice of the advertising afforded Ms. Lee with her film debut, The Cruise of the Make-Believes, in 1918, it is clear that she had name recognition, which translated to a starring role for her first celluloid appearance. Adding to that the Paramount Pictures public-relations department was quick to connect the Little-Cuddles angle in every publicity-release, interview and photo-shoot and in nearly every ad seen; this was especially true, through 1919 (her name appeared over five-hundred times in entertainment magazines and papers, in those two years). Lila Cuddles Lee was remembered fondly when she made her mark in movies, by those that had seen her on stage.[12]\n\nSoon her star began to fade as bad reviews piled high; this became a concern with distributors and exhibitors, once they began looking at the box-office analysis. Their suggestion, to off-set lackluster performances and weak story-lines, was to direct the attention of the potential movie-goer back to Lila Cuddles Lee, reminding the audience of her vaudeville fame.[13] Although the poor reviews were not contained to the film-making industry; there were enough pans and lukewarm notices to damage the rise of the young star, albeit, a manufactured starlet by Paramount Pictures. The common complaint of Lee was that her airy, vivacious stage presence did not translate well on film.\n\nMiss Lee was set to take the lead role in Judy of Rogue’s Harbor, as of December, 1918,[14] further it was reported in April of 1919 that she had wrapped up shooting for Judy of Rogue’s Harbor.[15] Yet the final project was not produced by Paramount and the role was given to Mary Miles Minter;[16] a very perplexing mishmash of events.\n\nWith turns in the Cecil B. DeMille production of Male and Female, 1919, and under the direction of William C. De Mille and James Cruze, with her best work yet to come in 1922 in Blood and Sand (starring Rudolph Valentino, directed by Fred Niblo and Dorothy Arzner), it may have appeared that she at last had found her acting stride, but her contract with Famous Players-Lasky/Paramount was not renewed. Her last film for the company (for which she receives modern credit for; please see Lee miscellany, below for her true final FPL/Paramount flick) was The Ne’er-Do-Well, released in April of 1923. Lee was announced to play in the 1924 release of North of 36,[17] but she did not make the trail to North of 36; FPL canceled the project, (no sooner having announced it), then reversed their decision again in February, 1924, this time with Irvin Willat to direct instead of James Cruze, their original choice for the film.[18]\n\nLila Lee is a most interesting subject, a talented child brought along too quickly, attaining a certain celebrity, without reaching the stars.\n\nLee miscellany\n\nTwo films that are not included in Ms. Lee’s work history are Human Wreckage (produced by the Thomas H. Ince Corporation), 1923, and Pied Piper Malone (for Paramount), 1924.\n\nWith James Kirkwood, Lee married a man more than twice her age, twice divorced, his last divorce-decree coming just a week before the Kirkwood-Lee-nuptials (the grounds for the second Edwards divorce, granted to his wife was ‘other women’).[19] Lee defied her parents, by marrying Kirkwood, whom they opposed and her guardian Philip Sultan, was surprised at the wedding.[20] To add to the strain for Lila Lee, just a month later her husband came close to death, by fracturing his skull, when thrown from a horse.[21] Kirkwood was working on the King Vidor, film, Wild Oranges, and the entirety of the five reels required retakes, with Frank Mayo taking Kirkwood’s role.[22]\n\nLila Lee’s father, Charles Appel, must have been a constant embarrassment for the young lady, while everything at casual observation looked fine (he owned a special events facility in Chicago, Illinois[23]) Mr. Appel was walking the razor’s edge of criminality when at his best, and not only flirted with the wrong side of the law, but took up residence in the dark region; all the while maintaining the persona of a philanthropist.[24]\n\nIn autumn of 1919, Appel admitted that he purchased contraband beer from a Kenosha, Wisconsin, provider.[25] In the summer of 1920 one of Appel’s facilities was broken into and he had four-hundred cases of alcohol stolen; later Chicago Police detectives confiscated the remaining fifty-three cases of Appel’s stock, and began a watch on Appel, his truck and properties. This led them to a new hideout and police were able to apprehend seventy-five more cases of the illegal (prohibition) libation.[26]\n\n1923 saw Appel charged with embezzlement, larceny, and running a confidence game; the indictment totaled approximately $250,000 (of course all charges were denied by the family, and further that Appel would face his accusers [27]). Even the money that Appel made off with was to be used to buy intoxicants, (again reminding us that this was illegal).[28] The initial excuse for the absence of Appel from Chicago was that he went to visit his daughter in California, and would return to Chicago, which he did not; in January of 1924 a reward $500.00 was put out for the return of Appel.[29]\n\nLila Lee so much believed in her father that she had supplied $30,000, in an attempt to preclude action against him.[30] Lee faced accusations that she had funded some of the illegal transactions; she threatened to leave the film-industry altogether if the ‘cloud’ of suspicion was not cleared up immediately by the press, regarding her involvement.[31] The situation worsened when in May of 1924, Lee brought suit against her father and mother, seeking clear title to eight pieces of property in Hollywood.[32]\n\nAppel reportedly left the country in 1924, for Mexico City; [33] finally, he was located in Germany, in October of 1925, and the US State Department requested the German government to return Appel to the United States, as extradition was not possible under the provisions of the treaty between the two countries.[34] Appel died in November of 1935, in Elyria, Ohio; what happened between his stay in Germany and his death, I cannot ascertain.\n\nLila Lee and a non-lengthy Filmography:\n\nThe Secret Garden, 1919\n\nTerror Island, 1920\n\nLove’s Whirlpool, 1924\n\nThe Unholy Three, 1930\n\nThe Ex-Mrs. Bradford, 1936\n\nBy C.

A shock of red hair, a man of humor, and an a highly opinionated assistant-director; while some in authority want a ‘yes-man’ Tate fit perfectly with Cecil B. DeMille, who wanted anything but an obsequious AD. Tate makes for one of the most interesting résumés in Hollywood history. As we look back upon the career of Cullen Tate there are a good number of non-listed credits as well as listed (whether named-uncredited or credited). Tate made a career of being the assistant-director or the second-unit-director; most of his work in sound films went uncredited. Two films catch the eye as outstanding; he worked (as assistant-director) with Cecil B. DeMille on The Ten Commandments, 1923, and The Man in the Iron Mask, 1939 as the second-unit-director, with James Whale.\n\nIn addition to the thirty or more movies as ‘AD’ or ‘SUD,’ Tate also directed four films: Try and Get It, and Cheap Kisses, both released in 1924, The Carnival Girl, 1926 and his co-directing in My Heart Belongs to Daddy, 1942, went uncredited. And I do not want to neglect mentioning that Tate was a favorite of DeMille, assisting the master on both silent and sound projects. His specialty was properties, scouting for location shoots;[1] often, Tate handled mob or large crowd scenes for DeMille and other directors.[2]\n\nA perfect example of Tate’s normal duties was when for Manslaughter, 1922, he visited the women’s prison in Auburn, New York, and the Manhattan Detention Complex; while there Tate shot footage, gathered details on apparel, and other prison paraphernalia.[3] During his stay in New York he sat in on an actual manslaughter trial, from beginning to end; he obtained copies of the official documents, from the indictment to the commitment to prison.[4]\n\nThere are projects that Tate not only goes uncredited for, but some films are not listed in his work-history, the type which we see commonly (IMDB is a primary source for all of us cinephiles) on the internet. Here is the roll of Tate’s overlooked films that I have complied thus far: Joan the Woman, 1916, A Romance of the Redwoods, 1917, The Woman God Forgot, 1917,[5] What Happened to Jones, 1920,[6] The Affairs of Anatol, 1921,[7] Adam’s Rib, 1923,[8] The Dark Angel, 1925,[9] The Barker, 1928,[10] His Captive Woman, 1929,[11] The Crusades, 1935,[12] Virginia, 1942 (second-unit-director),[13] Tate again in each of these films was the assistant-director unless otherwise noted.\n\nTate miscellany: He sat in the director’s chair (at least as co-director) for The Follies Girl, 1924, AKA The Chorus Lady, starring Margaret Livingstone, but it was Ralph Ince that received the credit.[14] Tate was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Assistant Director, for Cleopatra, 1934. ‘Hezi’ Tate was the first person to fill the new industry position of short-wave-tech, for Captains Courageous, 1937.[15]\n\nA few more tasty Tate titles:\n\nThe Locked Door, 1929 (George Fitzmaurice, director)\n\nMata Hari, 1931 (again with George Fitzmaurice in the director’s chair, but on this production Tate was not credited )\n\nRasputin and the Empress, 1932 (working on the only film in which John, Lionel and Ethel Barrymore would appear together in; unfortunately Tate received no attribution)\n\nDinner at Eight, 1933 (this was an uncredited project for Hazi Tate; directed by George Cukor)\n\nTest Pilot, 1938, (another uncredited piece of work for Tate; Victor Fleming directing)\n\nBy C.
