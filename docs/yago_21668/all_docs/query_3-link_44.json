        "text": "Stunning flowers and gorgeous fruit too. It has many seeds like a passionfruit and ripens in summer. It is very high in vitamin C.\n\nIt is related to the commercial caper (Capparis spinosa), the young flower buds can also be pickled like capers and the edible fruit eaten without preparation.\n\nWhen the fruit ripens, the skin goes a dull purple to orange colour. The flesh becomes yellow to orange and soft, with a fragrant smell.\n\nWild Orange occurs naturally in the drier parts of inland Australia in open savannah forest and grassland, generally on heavier textured soils. Also growing in the Flinders Ranges of South Australia, where it is used by the Adnyamathanha people, a cultural tourism enterprise is named after its local name, Iga Warta.\n\n◎ Common Name: Native Orange, Wild Orange, Native Pomegranate, Bumble Tree\n\n◎ Scientific or Latin Name:Capparis mitchellii\n\n◎ Comparison: Passionfruit\n\n◎ Seasonality: Rare\n\n◎Region: Arid\n\n◎ Taste Profile: It is quite tasty, although a bit astringent. Some describe the flavour as like passion fruit with a kerosene after-taste. The seeds are peppery and should be removed from the flesh and the skin is bitter and inedible.\n\n◎ Types: The Wild Orange is not related to oranges, but to capers. There are about 250 species in the genus with approximately 16 native to Australia.\n\nBenefits\n\nWild Orange is highly valued as a bush-tucker food.\n\nIt contains high levels of nutritional value, especially Vitamin C, thiamine, antioxidants, and some minerals.\n\nIt has been identified by CSIRO as having significant economic potential – unique flavour and fragrance sought after by perfumery, skincare and confectionary industries.\n\nWild Orange is antimicrobial.\n\nTraditional Aboriginal Food and Uses\n\nThe fruits of many of the species were important to Aborigines as a food. Aboriginal people ate the raw fruit which is a good source of vitamin C and thiamine.\n\nMedicinally it was valued by indigenous communities in central Australia, and also features culturally as part of indigenous Dreaming heritage.\n\nWestern & Modern\n\nNative Wild Orange has a high level of Vitamin C and is considered as valuable in the confectionery, flavouring and preservative industries. The fruit can be eaten raw or can be stewed and can be used in desserts, cordials or savoury dishes like curries, casseroles, rice and couscous.\n\nThe best time for fruit tends to be mid to late summer and it is suggested that timing is critical for harvesting and consumption to get the flavour just right. It makes a delicious drink. The juice and pulp are consumed but not seeds or rind which are considered peppery or astringent.\n\nMedicinal\n\nDue to the high levels of Vitamin C in Native Wild Orange, it is starting to feature more heavily in skincare products. Vitamin C is a natural antioxidant which hydrates the skin and fights the signs of visible ageing. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties can aid in wound healing and blemish correction.\n\n◎\n\nNote: The term 'Bush Tucker' and 'Bush Food' are not Warndu's preferred terms for Australian Native Ingredients or Australian Botanicals."
