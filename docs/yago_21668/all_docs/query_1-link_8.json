        "text": "Leo D. Maloney, as late as 1910, our soon to be actor, stunt-coordinator, director, writer and producer was a produce dealer, in New York City. What a humble occupation for a summa cum laude graduate of Santa Clara College.[1] But the degree from the San Francisco Bay area school did little to help this young man, whose upbringing consisted of ranch living, replete with lariat practice, cattle-round-ups, line-riding, bronc-busting and bulldogging a steer.[2] All of this prepared Maloney for a successful career in films, especially in the action and western genres, where his natural and learned talents were best utilized. As with A Wild Ride, 1915, where Maloney performed a death-defying stunt, this according to the Moving Picture World;[3] his horsemanship was well known in the industry.[4]\n\nIn July of 1922, Maloney signed a distribution contract with Pathé for The Range Rider Series,[5] which lasted for twenty-six two-reel installments. The first Range Rider episode was His Own Law, released on September 3, 1922; the last of this series was Warned in Advance, which opened on August 19, 1923. The Range Rider series followed his work in another proposed Pathé character-cycle entitled: Santa Fe Mac. Santa Fe Mac was distributed by Clark-Cornelius Corp and was planned for twelve two-reel, weekly episodes.[6] But, it seems that this initial short-western was used as pilot, rather than the beginning of a series, for we have no other connection to any other film or character to Santa Fe Mac.\n\nIn the mid-1920’s Maloney purchased land in the San Bernardino Mountains, building a western-city for the purpose of making movies. The property was located in the Crestline, California, neighborhood ,[7] specifically in the Huston Flat[8] area, about a quarter of mile west of Lake Gregory. The property is now the very center of Lake Gregory Village on Lake Drive; beginning at Alder Lane, on the south side, stretching east toward the lake.[9] This movie was called Skyland, with fifty buildings, its own lake and stream, along with fifty head of horses. At the time Skyland was the only studio devoted only to the making of western-movies and cost $100,000.00 to construct.[10]\n\nUnfortunately Maloney and his second-wife (Genevieve) were not able to keep up the payments and they defaulted on the $1,500.00 promissory note, which was held by the Hellman Commercial Trust and Savings Bank, acting as Trustee for Charles S. Mann and H. W. Ramsey.[11] A very disturbing way to lose a $100.000.00 property, over a $1,500.00 note; all of this occurred just a half a year prior to his death.\n\nIn the early to mid 1920’s Maloney reached the pinnacle of his career. Pathé’s advertising for the thirty-something actor was “America’s Cowboy,” and in the same ad: “He knows the good old audience stuff the way Tiffany knows a watch.”\n\nOf course a cowboy hero needs his trusty side-kick, and Maloney had at least two of these Equus ferus caballus cohorts, Monty Cristo,[12] and Come and Get Me.[13]\n\nWhat saddens me is the premature loss of Leo Maloney, all because he could not put the bottle down, acute alcoholism topped off by one long binge was his downfall; what a shame for his family, for the movie-goers then, and for us now looking back at what could have been.\n\nMaloney, had thirteen writing credits, he produced thirteen films, coordinated the stunts for The Hazards of Helen, 1914, directed fifty movies and acted in almost two-hundred flicks.\n\nBy C.

M. S. Pinafore, in the Old Duff Opera Company, in New York City. Original might be too strong of a word, for Mrs. Whiffen recounted that there were six companies staging Pinafore at the same time as the Old Duff.[5]\n\nNovember of 1881 began the run of Esmeralda, by Francis Hodgson Burnett, adapted by W. H. Gillette, staged at the Madison Square Theater, in New York City; the play would last nigh unto a year and the couple would go with the road production as well.\n\nThe Grand Old Lady of the theater (as Mrs. Whiffen was known) was indeed just that, appearing with all the luminaries of that era: Annie Russell, De Wolfe Hopper, Georgia Cayvan and Effie Ellsler; just a small sampling of those of whom Whiffen shared the stage with.[6] In January of 1901, she was in support of Ethel Barrymore, in Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines, at the Lyceum Theatre in Scranton, Pennsylvania.[7] 1902, December, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Mrs. Wiffen appeared in The Wilderness, as the ‘stage mother.’[8] In Washington, D. C., in the month of February, 1911, Mrs. Wiffen was seen at the National Theatre, as Mrs. Bedloe, in U. S. Minister Bedloe.[9] On November 21, 1917, Mrs. Wiffen celebrated (while in Chicago) her Jubilee in acting ; her debut was in 1867, when she appeared in London, in Turco, The Terrible, in the role of a fairy.[10]\n\nMrs. Blanche Galton-Wiffen had roles in more than forty Broadway productions. Her first was Marriage by Lanterns, 1868, her last, Just Fancy, 1927.\n\nShe made just two films, Hearts and Flowers, 1914, and Barbara Frietchie, 1915, and great ado was made for these two ventures into photoplays by her. Both films were released at the end of November, separated by three-hundred-sixty-three days. Each film fits into the category of either lost or survival status unknown.\n\nFor a real pleasure of a ‘one of a kind life,’ before the footlights, read Mrs. Thomas Whiffen’s autobiography, Keeping Off the Shelf, E. P. Dutton & Company, INC., 1928; filled with wonderful anecdotes of her stage career and beautiful portraits of those people in her life. She included a marvelous chapter on Mr. Whiffen, who was acquainted with Charles Dickens, and how the two gentlemen met; quite a man, quite a woman, and most definitely an engrossing story.

On different censuses, immigration lists for sailing, and publications he gave his birth-year as 1903, 1904, 1905… you get the picture. So we will simply go with what is on his headstone: 1903. In April of 1925, Allan was signed to play the leading man in Little Annie Rooney, starring Mary Pickford; not only signed, but Pickford personally selected him.[1] Clearly Allan missed the boat with Little Annie Rooney (mega hit for Pickford) and William Haines sailed away in the role of Joe Kelly. According to Allan himself, the following story of his broken arm was apocryphal,[2] and was issued to cover up a disagreement between Jack Pickford and himself: “Mr. Allan decided to celebrate the good news of being picked by Pickford, for Little Annie Rooney, by buying a new radio; while adjusting for a better signal on the roof (yes, those were the days), he fell off of the roof and broke his arm and changed casting history.”[3]\n\n1929 had ‘very special’ written all over it for Hugh Allan, he had met reporter Catherine (Cathryn) Hoffman (she was interviewing him) the summer before, in Miami, Florida;[4] the two hit it off and were engaged and planning a 1929, June wedding.[5] But for some un-announced reason the wedding did not happen. In the autumn of 1930 Hoffman landed a job with the Miami News, as an ‘imbedded-reporter’ in Hollywood.[6] Most of her articles were fluff-work with some diary reports added in; as well, Hoffman appears to have gotten walk-on (uncredited, unlisted) work on a few films, Only Saps Work, released December 6, 1930, is the subject of one piece.[7] And her hand was used in Three Rogues, 1931, starring Victor McLaglen and Fay Wray.[8] Probably this Hollywood correspondent got her real start with that Hugh Allan interview and romance; yet her fame was confined to the Miami area and was short-lived.\n\nOctober 26 of 1929 was the beginning of the end for Hugh Allan with regards to Hollywood. He had not married Catherine Hoffman, and now unbeknownst to him he was setting sail on a one way trip from the movie-making industry. Allan had contracted to film in Hawaii, with the S.S. Calawali being his transport. The ship arrived in Honolulu on November 2, 1929 and once there the production (Aloha) hit financial ‘rock-bottom;’ according to Allan, the director and producer put on a show for the actors by continuing the appearance of filming with no film in the cameras. This burnt Allan to the core, he went back to California on the S.S. City of Honolulu on November 30, 1929 and arrived in Los Angeles on December 4, promptly quitting the film business, thoroughly disturbed by the lack of character which he had seen.[9] Hugh Allan and co-star of Aloha, Gladys McConnell, filed a complaint against producer Eska Wilson; Wilson was arrested and released without bail.[10]\n\nWait a moment! If that is the truth, that Allan was through with films, then how do we explain a missing title? There is at the least one missing movie from Allan’s résumé and this is a post Hawaii production, which is the July 3, 1930 release, Holiday, directed by Edward H. Griffith.[11] The next unlisted (after the Hawaii disappointment) film is a two-reel comedy, Silence is Golden (announced at the same point as A Royal Flush), 1930.[12] Allan was shooting Silence is Golden in March of 1930, at Columbia Studios and was just one of a series of short-subjects being made.[13] One could make the assumption that when Aldous Huxley wrote his essay Silence is Golden, reprinted in Golden Book Magazine, for their April of 1930 edition, that he was writing a review (most refer to this piece as a specific-film commentary); Silence is Golden was originally published in a collection of essays with the title of: Do What You Will, 1929. That Huxley was writing a review of Silence is Golden is not likely, the piece is more about his dislike of talkies and that silent-movies are golden.[14] Silence is Golden not only is missing from Hugh Allan’s profile, but is not listed for Columbia. The short comedy is mentioned in an Indiana newspaper as Allan having the juvenile lead, and that he provoked laughs in both Silence is Golden and The Royal Flush.[15] This snippet about Silence is Golden was included in the Screen Gossip section, Hollywood, California, dated April 30, 1930.\n\nBut now I move beyond whether Allan ended his acting career in 1929 or 1930 and I want to introduce another possible film lost from Mr. Allan’s work history, the independently produced Love Harmony, 1930.[16] Shot at Tec-Art Studios and an Exeltone Productions project (possibly, Excellent Pictures Corporation?[17]), with director Dallas Fitzgerald at the helm and starring: Hugh Alan, Thelma Hill, Ethlyn Clarie and Lee Moran; they began filming on September 8, 1929.[18] This is a film that has completely dropped off the radar; there is not a trace in any of the film-histories of any of the principal players, nor in the production lists of Exeltone (I can find no information on this company), Tec-Art Studios (it’s main offices were located at 344 West 44th Street, New York City), nor anything in the profile of director Fitzgerald for this film. If Exeltone (Excellent) ran out of funding for this project and left it incomplete, then surly there would still be some further mention, yet, nothing; if this was an Excellent Pictures project, it appears nowhere on any current or upcoming release schedule from 1928-1930 . If you, dear reader, have any information regarding Love Harmony, please contact me at classicfilmaficionados@outlook.com\n\nNow, on to Allan’s post Hollywood career… with no announcement whatsoever, we find Hugh Allan married to Lois (Lou) Williamson, in 1932; they were living in Houston, Texas. By 1940 they had two children Carita (four years of age) and Hugh (one year old). Allan had landed a position as an executive with a whole-sale equipment business, making $5,000.00 per year. The couple lived in New York City, as late as 1935, (Carita was born in NYC) prior to moving to Memphis, Tennessee. This was home for Hugh Allan, the place of his birth. He seemed to thrive in Memphis and in 1943 he was the vice-president of the Rotary Lift Company. By 1954, fortunes turned and Allan was specializing in rebuilding clutches for elevators and eventually becoming the president of an elevator equipment company.[19] Finally, in 1993, Hugh Allan moved into his family’s old home in Memphis on Caraway Cove and spent his final years there.\n\nWith or without the other films that Allan worked on, his career was short and his film appearances can nearly be counted on your fingers and toes.\n\nNigh Unto Two-Bits of an Alan Filmography:\n\nThe Block Signal, 1926\n\nDress Parade, 1927\n\nWild Beauty, 1927\n\nAnnapolis, 1928\n\nThe Fire Detective, 1929\n\nBy C.

Not film royalty, but of stage royals, was Frederick Richard Sullivan (AKA: Frederic Sullivan, Fred Sullivan); son of Fred Sullivan, nephew of Sir Arthur Sullivan[1] of Gilbert and Sullivan comic-operetta fame! He was an actor both on stage and screen, a stock-company manager, writer, producer and he was a film and stage director. And for a candle on top of his birthday-cupcake, he was a composer; he set music to poems by Edgar Allen Poe.[2]\n\nPrior to stage and film work, Sullivan was a newspaper reporter, before spending the better part of fifteen years as stage director. He began his first job in films was with the Reliance Company, in 1912. A large portion of his film résumé is missing, this according to Wid’s Daily, in 1921, in their Director’s edition.[3] That one paragraph notation makes reference to two-hundred-fifty, one and two reel short-subjects. Yet, if we combined all of his known (modern vantage) work (features and shorts, directing, acting, producing and writing), we come up with less than ninety titles, sound and silent. What a loss of film-history.\n\nAs an actor on stage Sullivan found himself on Broadway a few times: Fedora, 1905, The House of a Thousand Candles, 1908, The Grain of Dust, 1912, Room of Dreams, 1930, Midnight, 1931 and Greater Love, 1931.\n\nIn 1900-01, he was part of the supporting cast in Rosemary and The Lottery of Love, and The Gilded Fool, in successive weeks (beginning in December of 1900), at the Lafayette, in Washington, D. C…[4] 1903 had Frederick Sullivan appearing in the role of Sir Horace Plumley, in, When We Were Twenty-one, by H. V. Esmond; the production was staged at the Majestic theatre in Boston, Mass.[5] Staying in Boston, Sullivan supported Nance O’Neil in her company, in the first English performance of The Fires of St. John, by Hermann Sudermann.[6]\n\nAlthough not listed on the Internet Broadway Data Base for The Reckoning, 1907, at the Berkeley Lyceum Theatre, New York City, yet from a playbill we see that he was indeed a co-director with Gustavo Von Seyffertitz. [7]Also he produced and directed, In the Bishop’s Carriage, 1907, which played at the Grand Opera House, NYC.[8]\n\nSullivan was a man with great attention to detail (much as, his uncle was), as is demonstrated on the serial, Zudora, 1914. Point one: Sullivan searched for a document (an integral plot device for the story) that was older and looked authentic; he combed New York City and could not find what he wanted. His solution was to look elsewhere, finally obtaining a portion of a will, which had been filed in Delaware County in 1876… an actual historic paper for a fictional letter. [9] Point two: even though the thread of his story-line involving a circus was but for one short scene, Sullivan, despite expense and time, hired an entire circus for the filming.[10]\n\nSullivan miscellany, in 1922, the Motion Picture Director’s Association, elected Sullivan to be their assistant director.[11]\n\nDuring the week prior to Thanksgiving, in November of1914, while directing Zudora, Frederick Sullivan earned the title of workhorse and taskmaster, in one concerted effort, when he established a Thanhouser production record whilst shooting thirty long-scenes in one work-day![12] I guess he wanted to work up an appetite for Turkey-day?\n\nSullivan partial Filmography as Director:\n\nThe Cat’s Paw, 1914\n\nThe Phantom Witness, 1916\n\nThe Cove of Missing Men, 1918\n\nThe Courtship of Myles Standish, 1923\n\nSullivan partial Filmography as Actor:\n\nThe White Terror, 1915\n\nThe Face on the Bar-Room Floor, 1923\n\nWinds of Chance, 1925\n\nBlind Adventure, 1933\n\nBy C.

Her relationship was such with Mr. and Mrs. Edwards that she took the Edwards name professionally, Little Cuddles Edwards; this with full permission from her mother. The song “Look out for Jimmy Valentine is the reason that Augusta Appel, soon to be ‘Little Cuddles’ was discovered. “Jimmy Valentine” was published in October of 1910, and Edwards saw her outside of a theater, and it was not until he got inside and like a flash the idea of this little girl lying on a piano, while “Look out for Jimmy Valentine” was sung, came to him; he asked Miss Lee’s mother for consent, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nAll did not remain amenable between the Edwards and the Appel families; an April, 1920, legal battle ensued which lasted two weeks, finally awarding custody of Lila Lee once again to her parents, Charles and Augusta Appel of Chicago;[1] Augusta Cuddles Lila Edwards-Lee-Appel had lived with the Edwards for ten years. A month later, guardianship for Lee was appointed to Chicago attorney Philip Sultan.[2] As we explore the early career of Lila Lee we cannot forget that she was still a child, throughout those formative acting years, she learned the art of celluloid acting on the job.\n\nThe next subject I want to tackle is the Lila Lee conundrum: her age. FPL (Famous Players-Lasky) signed the then sixteen-year-old actress in June of 1918.[3] Yet, her given age to the press was fourteen-years, in 1918,[4] eh, I’m lost? Was she 16 or 14? If 14 then she was born in 1904, but her date of birth on file is 1901 or 1902? Any birth-date earlier than 1903 would have made the custody between the Edwards and Appels moot; we will consider 1901 and 1902 as Ms. Lee attempting to pass herself off as older. In a newspaper article in December of 1912 her age is listed as seven[5] and her discovery by Gus Edwards when she was five? If Lee was five when discovered in 1910, then she was born in 1905? Which would make her? Total confusion! Even her own personal statements (this could be a common trait in Hollywood) make the process of finding her true age difficult. In the 1930 Federal Census, she listed her birth year as 1906; we would continue confused as to her real age excepting that she married James Kirkwood July 25, 1905, on her eighteenth birthday.[6] She was a star from the get-go! Top billing amongst the children on the vaudeville circuit, was the norm. She continued her vaudeville appearances through April of 1918, and then as stated above, Ms. Appel contracted with FPL, no later than the first week of June, 1918;[7] taking the name of Lila Lee.\n\nAt first glance it appears Ms. Lee may have been in the pre-Broadway production of Common Clay (penned by Cleves Kinkead), which played in Atlantic City, in August of 1915,[8] but, it is more reasonable to believe that the actress was Ms. Lela Lee, and not Lila Lee, listed in the trial-run of the Harvard award-winning play; accepting this as a misprint jibes well with the Broadway run of Common Clay where Lela Lee is in the cast. Lela Lee retired from the stage in January of 1916, after marrying Samuel Hoffenstein; the new Mrs. Hoffenstein left the cast of Common Clay, being succeeded by Ruth Boyd.[9]\n\nIn July of 1918 the preparation for her first appearance was laid down, with a nice piece in Film Fun magazine, where The Cruise of the Make-Believes is not called her first movie but One Hundred Per Cent American (a WWI Bond-Campaign film);[10] obviously plans changed for Lee’s role in this Liberty Loan Drive[11] movie, we see not hide nor hair of her in this 1 ½ reel short-patriotic-subject.\n\nWhen taking notice of the advertising afforded Ms. Lee with her film debut, The Cruise of the Make-Believes, in 1918, it is clear that she had name recognition, which translated to a starring role for her first celluloid appearance. Adding to that the Paramount Pictures public-relations department was quick to connect the Little-Cuddles angle in every publicity-release, interview and photo-shoot and in nearly every ad seen; this was especially true, through 1919 (her name appeared over five-hundred times in entertainment magazines and papers, in those two years). Lila Cuddles Lee was remembered fondly when she made her mark in movies, by those that had seen her on stage.[12]\n\nSoon her star began to fade as bad reviews piled high; this became a concern with distributors and exhibitors, once they began looking at the box-office analysis. Their suggestion, to off-set lackluster performances and weak story-lines, was to direct the attention of the potential movie-goer back to Lila Cuddles Lee, reminding the audience of her vaudeville fame.[13] Although the poor reviews were not contained to the film-making industry; there were enough pans and lukewarm notices to damage the rise of the young star, albeit, a manufactured starlet by Paramount Pictures. The common complaint of Lee was that her airy, vivacious stage presence did not translate well on film.\n\nMiss Lee was set to take the lead role in Judy of Rogue’s Harbor, as of December, 1918,[14] further it was reported in April of 1919 that she had wrapped up shooting for Judy of Rogue’s Harbor.[15] Yet the final project was not produced by Paramount and the role was given to Mary Miles Minter;[16] a very perplexing mishmash of events.\n\nWith turns in the Cecil B. DeMille production of Male and Female, 1919, and under the direction of William C. De Mille and James Cruze, with her best work yet to come in 1922 in Blood and Sand (starring Rudolph Valentino, directed by Fred Niblo and Dorothy Arzner), it may have appeared that she at last had found her acting stride, but her contract with Famous Players-Lasky/Paramount was not renewed. Her last film for the company (for which she receives modern credit for; please see Lee miscellany, below for her true final FPL/Paramount flick) was The Ne’er-Do-Well, released in April of 1923. Lee was announced to play in the 1924 release of North of 36,[17] but she did not make the trail to North of 36; FPL canceled the project, (no sooner having announced it), then reversed their decision again in February, 1924, this time with Irvin Willat to direct instead of James Cruze, their original choice for the film.[18]\n\nLila Lee is a most interesting subject, a talented child brought along too quickly, attaining a certain celebrity, without reaching the stars.\n\nLee miscellany\n\nTwo films that are not included in Ms. Lee’s work history are Human Wreckage (produced by the Thomas H. Ince Corporation), 1923, and Pied Piper Malone (for Paramount), 1924.\n\nWith James Kirkwood, Lee married a man more than twice her age, twice divorced, his last divorce-decree coming just a week before the Kirkwood-Lee-nuptials (the grounds for the second Edwards divorce, granted to his wife was ‘other women’).[19] Lee defied her parents, by marrying Kirkwood, whom they opposed and her guardian Philip Sultan, was surprised at the wedding.[20] To add to the strain for Lila Lee, just a month later her husband came close to death, by fracturing his skull, when thrown from a horse.[21] Kirkwood was working on the King Vidor, film, Wild Oranges, and the entirety of the five reels required retakes, with Frank Mayo taking Kirkwood’s role.[22]\n\nLila Lee’s father, Charles Appel, must have been a constant embarrassment for the young lady, while everything at casual observation looked fine (he owned a special events facility in Chicago, Illinois[23]) Mr. Appel was walking the razor’s edge of criminality when at his best, and not only flirted with the wrong side of the law, but took up residence in the dark region; all the while maintaining the persona of a philanthropist.[24]\n\nIn autumn of 1919, Appel admitted that he purchased contraband beer from a Kenosha, Wisconsin, provider.[25] In the summer of 1920 one of Appel’s facilities was broken into and he had four-hundred cases of alcohol stolen; later Chicago Police detectives confiscated the remaining fifty-three cases of Appel’s stock, and began a watch on Appel, his truck and properties. This led them to a new hideout and police were able to apprehend seventy-five more cases of the illegal (prohibition) libation.[26]\n\n1923 saw Appel charged with embezzlement, larceny, and running a confidence game; the indictment totaled approximately $250,000 (of course all charges were denied by the family, and further that Appel would face his accusers [27]). Even the money that Appel made off with was to be used to buy intoxicants, (again reminding us that this was illegal).[28] The initial excuse for the absence of Appel from Chicago was that he went to visit his daughter in California, and would return to Chicago, which he did not; in January of 1924 a reward $500.00 was put out for the return of Appel.[29]\n\nLila Lee so much believed in her father that she had supplied $30,000, in an attempt to preclude action against him.[30] Lee faced accusations that she had funded some of the illegal transactions; she threatened to leave the film-industry altogether if the ‘cloud’ of suspicion was not cleared up immediately by the press, regarding her involvement.[31] The situation worsened when in May of 1924, Lee brought suit against her father and mother, seeking clear title to eight pieces of property in Hollywood.[32]\n\nAppel reportedly left the country in 1924, for Mexico City; [33] finally, he was located in Germany, in October of 1925, and the US State Department requested the German government to return Appel to the United States, as extradition was not possible under the provisions of the treaty between the two countries.[34] Appel died in November of 1935, in Elyria, Ohio; what happened between his stay in Germany and his death, I cannot ascertain.\n\nLila Lee and a non-lengthy Filmography:\n\nThe Secret Garden, 1919\n\nTerror Island, 1920\n\nLove’s Whirlpool, 1924\n\nThe Unholy Three, 1930\n\nThe Ex-Mrs. Bradford, 1936\n\nBy C.

A shock of red hair, a man of humor, and an a highly opinionated assistant-director; while some in authority want a ‘yes-man’ Tate fit perfectly with Cecil B. DeMille, who wanted anything but an obsequious AD. Tate makes for one of the most interesting résumés in Hollywood history. As we look back upon the career of Cullen Tate there are a good number of non-listed credits as well as listed (whether named-uncredited or credited). Tate made a career of being the assistant-director or the second-unit-director; most of his work in sound films went uncredited. Two films catch the eye as outstanding; he worked (as assistant-director) with Cecil B. DeMille on The Ten Commandments, 1923, and The Man in the Iron Mask, 1939 as the second-unit-director, with James Whale.\n\nIn addition to the thirty or more movies as ‘AD’ or ‘SUD,’ Tate also directed four films: Try and Get It, and Cheap Kisses, both released in 1924, The Carnival Girl, 1926 and his co-directing in My Heart Belongs to Daddy, 1942, went uncredited. And I do not want to neglect mentioning that Tate was a favorite of DeMille, assisting the master on both silent and sound projects. His specialty was properties, scouting for location shoots;[1] often, Tate handled mob or large crowd scenes for DeMille and other directors.[2]\n\nA perfect example of Tate’s normal duties was when for Manslaughter, 1922, he visited the women’s prison in Auburn, New York, and the Manhattan Detention Complex; while there Tate shot footage, gathered details on apparel, and other prison paraphernalia.[3] During his stay in New York he sat in on an actual manslaughter trial, from beginning to end; he obtained copies of the official documents, from the indictment to the commitment to prison.[4]\n\nThere are projects that Tate not only goes uncredited for, but some films are not listed in his work-history, the type which we see commonly (IMDB is a primary source for all of us cinephiles) on the internet. Here is the roll of Tate’s overlooked films that I have complied thus far: Joan the Woman, 1916, A Romance of the Redwoods, 1917, The Woman God Forgot, 1917,[5] What Happened to Jones, 1920,[6] The Affairs of Anatol, 1921,[7] Adam’s Rib, 1923,[8] The Dark Angel, 1925,[9] The Barker, 1928,[10] His Captive Woman, 1929,[11] The Crusades, 1935,[12] Virginia, 1942 (second-unit-director),[13] Tate again in each of these films was the assistant-director unless otherwise noted.\n\nTate miscellany: He sat in the director’s chair (at least as co-director) for The Follies Girl, 1924, AKA The Chorus Lady, starring Margaret Livingstone, but it was Ralph Ince that received the credit.[14] Tate was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Assistant Director, for Cleopatra, 1934. ‘Hezi’ Tate was the first person to fill the new industry position of short-wave-tech, for Captains Courageous, 1937.[15]\n\nA few more tasty Tate titles:\n\nThe Locked Door, 1929 (George Fitzmaurice, director)\n\nMata Hari, 1931 (again with George Fitzmaurice in the director’s chair, but on this production Tate was not credited )\n\nRasputin and the Empress, 1932 (working on the only film in which John, Lionel and Ethel Barrymore would appear together in; unfortunately Tate received no attribution)\n\nDinner at Eight, 1933 (this was an uncredited project for Hazi Tate; directed by George Cukor)\n\nTest Pilot, 1938, (another uncredited piece of work for Tate; Victor Fleming directing)\n\nBy C.

He was the son of Baird William Pallette, referred to as J. W. or Baird[1] the general-manager of The National life Insurance Company in St. Louis, Missouri,[2] and his mother was Elnora ‘Ella’ Jackson-Pallette. Baird Pallette was able to pass on his love and experience of having lived on a farm, and his time spent as cowboy, and his familiarity with the cattle business[3] to Eugene; Pallette had just one sibling, his older sister Beulah.\n\nAccording to Culver Military Academy (located in Culver, Indiana) Eugene Pallette graduated in 1912, which makes no sense, for Culver is a preparatory school, which would have made Pallette twenty-three when leaving Culver. Culver Academy was a boarding and educational institution, so we may assume that like everyone else Pallette graduated by the time he was eighteen, but that does not jibe with the fact that he was a clothing salesman, hailing from Sedalia, Missouri, in 1906.[4] Since Pallette is listed proudly as alumni of the Culver Military Academy, we may conjecture that he was not expelled; therefore he either left or graduated early.\n\nEugene Pallette made his first appearance on stage in Little Eva (yes, the title role), with his next performance being in East Lynne as Little Willie.[5] In fact in seems that his parents were in a tour of East Lynne, when young Eugene played ‘Little Willie’ in that production;[6] Pallette’s parents being actors is confirmed, according to an article by Robert Grandon.[7] Who’s Who on the Screen had Mr. Pallette’s first stage role in Alias Jimmy Valentine, which was written by Paul Armstrong, 1909 and began its Great White Way run in January of 1910; there is no record that Pallette was cast in the original Broadway production.[8] In 1909-10, Pallette traveled with a stock company to Portland, Oregon, maybe Alias Jimmy Valentine was the play that he went to Portland, Oregon for? Anyway, enough of that conjecture. When the acting troupe went broke in Portland,[9] he paid the bills by working as a streetcar motorman.[10] He acquired the position of motorman by circumventing the crowd of applicants ahead of him, slipping through a side window; the superintendent was impressed by Pallette’s enterprise, and hired him.[11] Trolley veterans who worked with Pallette recounted his solution to slow fares one day, saying that he took his trolley off route to the baseball park, but, even after he picked up more fares, Pallette was still instructed to stay on his own route.[12]\n\nHis hodgepodge of jobs did not end there, somewhere in between the years-who knows when, and pounds-300 of them, Pallette found time to be a jockey, a circus bareback rider and an aerialist;[13] with twelve years in front of live audiences, [14] Pallette arrived in Hollywood in 1910.[15]\n\nFrom the horse’s mouth is usually the best way to get the correct information or sometimes it may end up being an exaggeration, yet, Pallette claimed that in his first four years in Hollywood, he made one-hundred pictures per annum![16] Of course there is some allusion by Pallette that he was a stunt rider (which fits nicely when remembering his bare-back circus riding days) before he acted. It appears that a goodly amount of his traceable early work in Tinsel-Town is lost; if his start year is 1910, then that is a full three years before our earliest knowledge of any of his film work. Further, a 1932 report claims that Pallette had already worked in 640 motion pictures.[17] Some others have claimed as many as twelve-hundred movies to his credit.[18] These hundreds of extra titles would have to have been walk-ons, crowd-scenes and stunt work, or I would think we would have a little more evidence. And one piece of information that is often forgotten is that Pallette was also a supervisor of productions during his early stint in Hollywood,[19] and he worked with director Tom Ricketts at Universal in 1912;[20] this definitely could have rolled up the stats for young Pallette’s résumé. But with that said, it was in February, 1913 that we saw his official film debut (The Fugitive), at least it will remain official until someone somewhere, turns over a movie-stone and changes film and date.\n\nThere are so many classic films to make mention of, our first few selections are from the silent-era:\n\nThe Birth of a Nation, 1915\n\nIntolerance, 1916\n\nTarzan of the Apes, 1918\n\nThe Three Musketeers, 1921 (in the role of Aramis)\n\nThe Wolf Man, 1924 (a lost film)\n\nChicago, 1927\n\nAnd now for that froggy-voice we all are so familiar with from 1928 onward; listing just a few of his most memorable roles:\n\nMy Man Godfrey, 1936 (Alexander Bullock)\n\nTopper, 1937 (Mr. Casy)\n\nThe Adventures of Robin Hood, 1938 (Friar Tuck)\n\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington, 1939 (Chick McGann)\n\nThe Mark of Zorro, 1940 (Fray Felipe)\n\nThe Lady Eve, 1941 (Mr. Pike)\n\nThe Male Animal, 1942 (Ed Keller)\n\nHeaven Can Wait, 1943 (E. F. Strable)\n\nSuffice it to say that Pallette not only may be one of your favorite Hollywood supporting players, he is one of mine, but he was definitely a favorite of many producers, directors and his acting peers.\n\nPallette miscellany Pallette was a close friend of actor-director Raoul Walsh and shared an apartment with the Hollywood legend, somewhere around 1914-15.[21] Once Pallette gained his weight (which began creeping up in the 1920’s), it was constant fodder (pardon the food pun) for the press, nary an article was remiss in making reference to his portly state. In the 1920’s Pallette slowed down his acting assignments and concentrated on black-gold in Texas, gaining a fortune in oil and then losing it all.[22]\n\nOne drawback to this character actor supreme, at least according to Otto Preminger, is that he was a racist, which if true was a sad epitaph for such a talented actor.[23] Yet, still more confusion in the matter was supplied by Jet Magazine, reporting that Pallette was in attendance, at the banquet for Madame Sul-Te-Wan; at that time the oldest living black actress in the world. Sul-Te-Wan and Pallette had both appeared in The Birth of a Nation in 1915 and Intolerance in 1916.[24] Is this a contradiction to Preminger’s statements? Did Jet Magazine bow to the pressure of the Hollywood machine trying to rehabilitate Pallette or was this a ‘wink and nod’ from Jet to let everyone in Hollywood know that they knew the truth? Or, yet again, was this the real Pallette?\n\nIn 1937, as though Oregon was calling, Pallette begin to make regular journeys to the Beaver state beginning to acquire small parcels of land that would eventually add up to around thirty-five hundred acres. By those outside of Wallow County, Oregon, the retreat was labeled a compound, a fortress, but for those who knew Pallette, it was his home; a self-sustaining community was his goal.[25] To that end he developed (his retreat was located in the wilderness, in the eastern part of the state, along the Imnaha River)[26] the property with a ranch-house (constructed next to an old post-office), bombproof underground installations, a saw-mill, a gas station and he built a slaughter-house. He had bunk houses, a central kitchen and a mess-hall. Machine shops, stables, a cannery, water works were added to the mix and a 60×90 foot concrete warehouse to handle all of the foodstuffs.[27] Pallette ventured back to Hollywood in 1949,[28] (the world having not been blown-up, as he anticipated[29]) and according to some reports he sold the Oregon ranch in 1951; it included three-hundred head of cattle, and the foodstuffs in the sale.[30] But, in one obit, it makes mention that a 3,500 acre ranch in Oregon, was not affected by the probate proceedings.[31] Much of the preceding information was related by Claude Hall, in 1977. Mr. Hall was a retired Wallowa County, Oregon, judge and had been a former partner in the Pallette Ranch.\n\nBy C. S.

Cossar and Fanny Cohen (AKA Fannie Cohen, Fannie Cossar) were married on June 15, 1896.\n\nJohn Cossar was a well established actor long ere he first graced the silver-screen; as early as 1883 (he was 18), Cossar appeared in Pique, in the role of Arthur Standish,[1] which toured the Midwest. Then in 1885 he had good supporting work in Little Ferret, (playing, Howard, the detective) which played in Sedalia, Missouri.[2] While in 1886 Cossar was on a North American tour of Michael Strogoff (having replaced Frank C. Bangs, when he fell ill with severe bronchial trouble[3]), appearing in the title role.[4] By the time 1887 rolled around, audiences accepted Cossar as Michael Strogoff, with the production’s initial leading man Frank Bangs all but forgotten.[5] John Hay Cossar was considered a well-known actor, especially in the east, and in 1889, he was prominent in the touring company that presented Beacon Lights,[6] receiving accolades for his characterization.\n\nBy the middle of the next decade, Cossar was so well known that when local New York newspaper reports related that he and Miss Fanny Cohen were married, his replay (“simply engaged”) was printed in the New York Dramatic Mirror[7]; this a whole year prior to their nuptials and it speaks volumes to the popularity of the young actor in 1895.\n\nHe was in the tour of The Great Ruby in 1902;[8] The Great Ruby was written by Cecil Raleigh and Henry Hamilton, produced by Augustin Daly, at Daly’s Theatre, in New York. The original cast included Blanche Bates, Ada Rehan, Laura Burt, May Cargill, White Whittlesey, Marcia Von Dresser (replaced Miss Ada Rehan), which had a successful run on Broadway: February 9, 1899-.? That question-marked closing date need not be completely in the dark, for the play was still going strong (“unprecedented business”), as of April 8, 1899.[9] The play was scheduled to close on Sunday, June 18, but with the passing of Augustin Daly, on June 7, 1899, the manager of Daly’s Theatre, Richard Dorney, immediately closed the show; so the end date was either June 8 or June 9, bringing the total performances to over one-hundred-forty. [10] Also he appeared in Her Marriage Vow, in 1904,[11] and then we see the Cossar couple playing vaudeville in Montana, in early 1907; their act revolved around comedy-skits. For this trip to Anaconda, Montana the couple was included in a large advertisement.[12] On to Spokane for their next vaudeville stop, headlining the program;[13] moving south, they appeared at Empire Theatre, in Los Angeles, California. By September of the same year they had made the trek to Pennsylvania,[14] where they received a very warm welcome by the audiences for their interpretation of the skit Our Honeymoon (written, conceived, and originally performed by John C. Rice and Sally Cohen; the Cossars acquired the exclusive rights from Rice and Cohen, for their western-state tour).[15] By February 1909 and for the next two years, it was not uncommon to see the husband and wife team of Cossar and their sketch Our Honeymoon, at or near top bill;[16] John Cossar is made mention of in Variety-Weekly, more than 60 times from 1907-1912… a very busy man he was.\n\nIt was not John who first saw Cossar in flickering light, but Fanny who made the family’s first appearance in film, with The Love of Beauty, 1913 (Lubin Manufacturing Company). Fanny Cossar was only to make a handful of pictures and those numbered years apart; her last two movies were talkies: Girl Grief, 1932 and Opened by Mistake, 1934.\n\nWhen John Cossar made his film debut he was fifty-nine years old, not exactly matinee-idol material, yet, he quickly gained admirers for his realistic portrayals. In 1914, after J. H. Cossar’s eighteenth role (A Gentleman of Leisure), he made another picture with Francis X. Bushman (their tenth time working together), The Plum Tree, which Cossar is not credited with, another of those missing links.[17]\n\nLate summer through late autumn of 1915, causes us a little name identity problem for a Cossar film: The Whirlpool, which was released on September 4, 1915. But by December of 1915, Essanay had changed the title to The Vortex, with half-page advertising bought in Pictures and the Picturegoer magazine. Ah, the vagaries of AKA, one-hundred years removed.\n\nCossar often appeared along side of Bryant Washburn (who acted well into the sound era and had nearly four-hundred roles), especially during Cossar’s early years in film. The pair were first seen together in The Mystery of Room 643, in 1914 and the last time that they worked on the same project was, Love Insurance, 1919, although Cossar was nothing more than a bit player in the film. In 1915 John Cossar was riding high on the seas of celebrity, as we can see from this full page ad seen a Hollywood trade-magazine.\n\nAnother autumn, proved important to Cossar, this in November of 1916 saw the Cossar name upon the silver-screen six times in five productions; the last of these five short-subjects was released on November 21, a week ahead of Thanksgiving: Unto the Least of These. The film is special for the reason that Fanny Cossar appears (uncredited, unlisted) in the film. As far as we know, this is the only time they were on the screen together; what a change after such a strong vaudeville presence, that saw the husband and wife team, together on hundreds of occasions. John Cossar appeared in more than one-hundred-fifty motion pictures, his last role was The Fire Detective.\n\nFurther Cossar Films:\n\nThe Adventures and Emotions of Edgar Pomeroy, which was a series of twelve-two-reel comedies, 1920-1921 (status of these films is considered unknown)\n\nThe Hunchback of Notre Dame, 1923 (appeared in the role of the Judge of the Court)\n\nThe Sap, 1926\n\nBy C.
