        "text": "Stock silent melodrama with a Southern Gothic flavor. Film's split between two locations: the Yankee, our stoic widower hero's ship, which is anchored just off the Georgia coast, and a decaying old seaside estate choked with swampland and spiders. The hero and the owner's granddaughter meet, she dreams of following him to the freedom of the sea, but brutish handyman Nicholas (bluntly described as \"a Homicidal Maniac\") has other plans... you can see where this is going.\n\nI found this interesting largely because of its extremely limited scope—outside of a quick prologue, only five characters appear onscreen—and for how prominently the act of looking figures in its visual design. The granddaughter's constantly gazing out toward sea, the hero back toward…\n\nDirector King Vidor demonstrating craft and excellence in an early swamp melodrama, equipped with action thrills and performance, and climatic moments, with a stand out finale escape route out to sea, all of it anchored by a tense and eerie Southern Gothic love story setting along with it, which initially resists developing and expanding, with the backdrop of a decaying country state mansion, where time has now stood still through the seasons, standing as a haunted memory with a set of disturbed emotional shackles.\n\nBeautiful, grotesque and intriguing on location piece, that Vidor sets up nicely, in a way that makes us wanna appreciate it all fully, with a tone and mood reaching modest levels of drama.\n\nFrom its brooding…\n\n“If film is a search, or ‘research’, for Vidor, the neo-realists and other modern romantics, what area of research is more fertile with wonder than women? The topic enshrines all the themes of spirit and flesh in their most complex forms. Vidor would fall in love with the heroines of his movies while writing their parts, and then with the actresses incorporating them. Vidor’s sense of sexuality appealed to Italians and Frenchmen; its thrust is cosmological and sacramental, uniting everything that lives within the breath of God. Eric Rohmer’s movies, in particular, have a similar sense of sex, adventure and sacrament, and are similarly posed in images that manage to be both documentary realism and painting. But when we watch…\n\nThe kind of generic silent melodrama that wouldn't be worth much notice nowadays if it weren't elevated somewhat by the direction of King Vidor. Worth watching if you're a fan of his.\n\nThey shoulda gone back for the dog though."
