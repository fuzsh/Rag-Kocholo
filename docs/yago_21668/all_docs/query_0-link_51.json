Although Vidor's style and themes changed greatly over the decades, the magician of atmosphere remained loyal to marshes and bogs, and to glimpses of an empty rocking chair in motion on a deserted porch.\n\nOn the 100th anniversary of his birth (he died in 1982), Vidor's talent for sustaining fear or pain, for choreographing large groups of performers, along with his patriotism and his affectionate irreverence toward Hollywood, are being celebrated at the Joseph Papp Public Theater with a retrospective that starts today and continues through March 17.\n\n\"Rediscovering King Vidor\" enables us to immerse ourselves in the Texas-born director's silent films, a medium in which he excelled. \"The Big Parade\" (1925) plunges us into the maelstrom of World War I. At first, three American rookies -- a bartender, a city bumpkin and an elegant playboy (John Gilbert) -- enjoy bucolic larks in the French countryside; as they savor the local wine and pursue a pretty young Frenchwoman, there is little sense of the slaughter to come. In his autobiography, \"A Tree Is a Tree,\" Vidor wrote that he decided to follow a soldier \"who was neither overpatriotic nor a pacifist,\" who responded to everything that happened but had no \"power to create the situations\" engulfing him.\n\nIn his ill-fitting uniform and unwinding puttees, Gilbert displayed far more range than when he later played Garbo's obsessed lover. Here he's a lively innocent who is totally unprepared for war. As his company approaches the front and an officer shouts, \"Fix . . . bayonets!,\" Gilbert looks stunned, as if he hadn't actually foreseen killing. Surrounded by snipers and machine guns, dodging bullets from planes overhead, stepping over corpses, throwing grenades and crawling across an open battlefield, Gilbert reveals a vulnerability that makes you painfully conscious of wasted lives, and of how suddenly a life can be lost.\n\nHe nearly cuts a wounded German's throat -- then doesn't (a scene you remember during Vidor's \"Northwest Passage,\" where the gleeful massacre of Abenaki Indians indicates that no enemy deserves mercy). Vidor directed his troops to march toward the front in the measured rhythm of a funeral cortege -- accompanied by a bass drum -- to convey the danger and death awaiting them, and he filmed a line of 200 Army trucks on a straight road to heighten the feeling of inevitability.\n\nInfluenced by Lang\n\nBelieving that \"life is like a battle,\" Vidor focused \"The Crowd\" (1928) on an ordinary citizen whose existence resembled many others. Raised by a father who expected him to become \"somebody big,\" a young man gazes at the Manhattan skyline as though he will be welcome there. Selecting an unknown (James Murray) to play a clerk in a huge insurance company, Vidor showed him in the middle of hundreds of office workers hurrying through revolving doors and as one of 200 men sitting at a long row of desks. Much of the movie was shot in New York -- on Wall Street, at Coney Island, on avenues crowded with Model-T's and open-air double-decker buses -- and Vidor acknowledged that he had been influenced by Fritz Lang's \"Metropolis.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
