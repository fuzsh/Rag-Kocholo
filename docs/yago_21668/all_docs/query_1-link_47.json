        "text": "By Scott Ross\n\nAs ever, click on the highlighted text for links and fuller reviews.\n\nI Want to Live! (1958) As an Orson Welles partisan it’s almost impossible for me to enjoy a movie directed by Robert Wise. Welles believed that the one-time editor of Citizen Kane, in exchange for the opportunity to direct, eagerly butchered The Magnificent Ambersons for the management of RKO while its maker was in South America, and whether this is true or the justifiable paranoia of a man whose masterpiece was destroyed while he was unable to defend it is almost beside the point. In addition to his editorial malfeasance, Wise directed some of the terrible scenes in Ambersons re-shot by studio diktat, and he did become a director, eventually winning two Academy Awards (for the emotionally manipulative The Sound of Music and the appalling West Side Story). I admit to liking parts of some of his pictures: The Set-Up (largely for Robert Ryan’s superb performance), Executive Suite (sweaty capitalist melodrama somewhat redeemed by its cast, especially Nina Foch), Somebody Up There Likes Me (for Paul Newman), Run Silent Run Deep (for Gable and Lancaster), Odds Against Tomorrow (nowhere near as good as its source novel but watchable for Ryan and Harry Belafonte, and the picture’s ironic ending), The Haunting (not a patch on Shirley Jackson’s book but it is hard to forget that breathing door) and Star! (cynical and wildly overblown but fascinating, for all the wrong reasons). His two Val Lewton pictures (The Curse of the Cat People and The Body Snatcher) are memorable as much for what Lewton, their producer, brought to them as for anything Wise did. But there is absolutely no excuse for how badly Wise and Robert Anderson distorted and cheapened Richard McKenna’s wonderful novel The Sand Pebbles.\n\nMy distaste is not entirely centered around the matter of Wise v. Welles, however. Generally I find Wise the worst sort of obvious filmmaker, prone to symbols and to Expressionist camera angles, not for reasons of organic composition but merely to be smart, drawing attention to his cinematic “invention.” With I Want to Live! — note the gratuitous exclamation point — Wise was abetted in his emotional manipulation by the imprimatur of The Truth. Based by the screenwriters Nelson Gidding and Don Mankiewicz on newspaper pieces by Edward Montgomery concerning the guilt or innocence of the condemned Barbara Graham, and on Graham’s letters, the movie paints its subject as a smart-ass good-time girl railroaded by The System. (The reality may have been less sanguine, although Graham maintained that her confession was coerced.) Susan Hayward gives one of those performances, half-banal, half-inspired, that kept getting her Academy Award nominations and, finally, this time, won her the prize. What’s best about the picture are Lionel Lindon’s superb black and white photography, William Hornbeck’s intelligent editing, and the trend-setting score by Johnny Mandel. Other soundtracks of the period, including several splendid ones by Elmer Bernstein and Alex North, were jazz-oriented. But like Bernstein’s Sweet Smell of Success the year before (and Duke Ellington’s Anatomy of a Murder the year after) Mandel’s was jazz, performed by a remarkable aggregation that included Gerry Mulligan, Art Farmer, Bud Shank, Shelley Manne, Milt Bernhardt, Pete Jolly, Jack Sheldon and Red Mitchell.\n\nOne thing Wise did get absolutely right: The depiction of Graham’s gas-chamber execution, whose starkness emphasizes the calculated nature of capital punishment as it is carried out in this country; the gawking spectators, eager to catch the condemned’s last breath, are more cold-blooded than Barbara Graham ever was.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz (1939) The generations born and raised after 1990 will find it hard to credit how, from 1959 to 1991, this already well-loved musical fantasy became an institution, its annual network television airing (usually at Easter) an event looked forward to and savored by children, even those (like me) whose families did not own a color teevee and who didn’t discover until they were in their 20s that the Horse of a Different Color was just that. Once Ted Turner got his mitts on the picture you had to have a cable subscription to see it; now, of course, it’s shown only on TCM, which, considered a thing only the old are interested in, I suspect few young people ever watch without coercion.\n\nI may not be exactly happy to have reached my sixth decade but I wouldn’t trade the yearly excitement of tuning in to this imperishable product of the studio age for a few years chipped off my biography. Who, knowing their glories, would want to miss Harold Arlen’s felicitous melodies, “Yip” Harburg’s delicious lyrics, flying monkeys, dozens of midgets, a cranky apple tree who speaks in the voice of Candy Candido, Herbert Stothart’s background score with its instantly memorable theme for Miss Gulch on her bicycle and its menacing Winkie chorus, Judy Garland’s endearing performance as Dorothy (and her marvelous singing voice), Margaret Hamilton’s as The Wicked Witch of the West, Frank Morgan’s as The Wizard, Jack Haley’s as the Tin Man or Ray Bolger’s as the Scarecrow? Or, supremely, the great Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion, especially when, singing “If I Were King of the Forest” like a mad Met tenor with enlarged adenoids, he belts the immortal phrase, “Monarch of all I survey/Mah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haah-nuck!” It always slays me.\n\nThe Dybbuk [דער דיבוק] 1937 A beautiful Polish adaptation (direction by Michał Waszyński, screenplay by S. A. Kacyzna) of S. Ansky’s Yiddish folk play, exquisitely filmed by Albert Wywerka and with an effective musical score by Henryk Kon. The splendid cast includes, in the leading roles, Abraham Morewski, Ajzyk Samberg, Mojżesz Lipman, Lili Liliana and the superb Leon Liebgold as the thwarted lover whose imprecations have such disastrous results. One of the few major European Yiddish productions, The Dybbuk was made near the end of a decade that would see Poland subsumed by Nazi Germany and, presumably, most of its cast and creators destroyed in the Shoah.\n\nThe excellent restoration is part of the Kino Blu-ray collection Jewish Soul: Classics of Yiddish Cinema.\n\nThe Love God? (1969) This frequently riotous Nat Hiken-written and directed take on 1960s sexual mores was the first adult Don Knotts comedy, and died a miserable death on its release in 1969. It was also traduced by the critics, who either didn’t seem to comprehend that it was a satire or if they did, like Judith Crist, considered it “smutty.” If you’re open to it, there’s something just inherently funny about Don Knotts as a mousy bird magazine publisher being turned into a Hugh Hefner prototype by an unscrupulous flesh-peddler (Edmond O’Brien), an ambitious editor (Anne Francis) and a pretentious gangster (B.S. Pully) with a penchant for punching everyone, women included, who disagrees with him. Along the way there are funny bits by James Gregory as a crusading lawyer, Maureen Arthur as a nudie magazine model, Jesslyn Fax as a retired schoolteacher, Marjorie Bennett as an ancient small-town secretary who can’t wait to cut loose in New York, Herb Voland as the Attorney General and Ruth McDevitt as an outraged old bat. If Maggie Peterson, who plays Knotts’ virginal beloved, looks a little like a pretty horse surprised by a grass bouquet, Knotts himself is in fine fettle, especially when sporting his new “mod” wardrobe or, riotously, twice performing his medley of bird calls, the second time with a mouth gone dry from terror. The score is, as usual for a Knotts comedy, by Vic Mizzy. Sadly, Hiken died between the filming and release of this, his only feature film.\n\nThe Green Man (1956) Memory betrays us in peculiar ways. There was a scene in some movie comedy or other — I no longer recall which one — that for years I misremembered almost completely. When I finally saw the picture in question again, I was more than a bit taken aback because my false memory of that scene (whatever it was) was so much funnier than the reality. I was a victim of memory distortion; somehow in the intervening years between first exposure and second my brain had filled in the details in a way that was almost infinitely more satisfying than what my eyes had actually seen. This psuedomemory recurred to me while watching the British comedy The Green Man because I saw it on the strength of a recommendation by Stephen Fry, whose appreciation of it I now realize was as misguided as my own for that nameless, long-ago seen comedy. In “A Critical Condition,” one of the essays in his book Paperweight, Fry writes, “As a child I saw a film on television starring Alastair Sim called The Green Man. Like almost any picture featuring that incomparable genius it contains moments of as absolute a joy as one is ever permitted on this sublunary plain. There is one scene, in which he attempts to bustle a female palm court trio out of a room that he needs to be vacated, which remains as funny as anything committed to celluloid.” Well! It sounded like something Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond had unaccountably left out of Some Like it Hot. Who wouldn’t want to see that?\n\nI waited with great anticipation for the palm court sequence and when it arrived was utterly flummoxed to find the action consisted of little more than a somewhat anxious Sim asking the ladies of the trio to join him for drinks in the adjacent bar, and the women, after delightedly agreeing, following him out. That was it. Not that The Green Man was as puny a thing as the critic who offended Fry by deeming it “a thin, ultimately unsatisfactory vehicle for Sim” would have his readers believe. Sim, as a very successful middle-class assassin, is marvelous, as he nearly always was, the picture is cleverly constructed by Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat (based on their play), directed with assurance if not flair by Robert Day (and an uncredited Basil Dearden) and the supporting cast, which includes George Cole, Jill Adams, Avril Angers, John Chandos, Terry-Thomas, Raymond Huntley and Dora Bryan, performs with brio. But Stephen Fry, alas, appears to have been the victim of the same, unreliable memory distortion that also afflicted me.\n\nLove and Death (1975) At the time of its release, this was considered Woody Allen’s most pretentious movie, by critics who hadn’t yet lived. Considering that this satire on Russian literature includes take-offs on, and homages to, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky (an entire dialogue scene composed of his titles), Chekhov and, although he was not Russian, Ingmar Bergman, pretentious Love and Death certainly is. It is also extremely funny.\n\nIf Sleeper gave Diane Keaton her first exposure as a comedian of no small inspiration, her performance here delivers something very close to genius. As Sonja, the lifelong love of Boris Grushenko (Allen) Keaton skewers every pseudointellectual Barnard graduate who ever pontificated mindlessly and reactively, and, in the scene in which Allen and the man (Lloyd Batista) he’s about to impersonate take turns bopping her on the head with a wine bottle, she’s blissfully funny. Sleeper represented an enormous leap in Allen’s filmmaking, and Love and Death is even more impressive, enriched by Ghislain Cloquet’s fine-grained, deeply saturated cinematography. The movie also contains Allen’s first great ensemble cast, including James Tolkan (as Napoleon); Olga Georges-Picot in a role intended for Groucho Marx’s secretary and manager Erin Fleming who had appeared in everything… about sex but re-cast when that mentally unbalanced woman stormed off the set in outrage; Zvee Scooler as Boris’ idiot father; Despo Diamantidou as his disapproving mother; Jessica Harper as Sonja’s Chekhovianly depressed friend; Alfred Lutter as the young Boris; Frank Adu in a hilarious bit as a black drill sergeant during the French invasion of Russia; and the wonderful Harold Gould, who shares a side-splitting dueling sequence with Allen.\n\nSome of the set-pieces are uproarious, some merely wan, and a few of the jokes don’t work at all; hearing that Boris is seen leading a cheering squad during a battle, for example, is funnier than actually seeing him do it. Allen’s Bob Hope impersonation, honed in his earlier movies (Bananas, Sleeper and as the Jester in sex) gets a full workout here, and in some ways the picture is little but a remake of the 1946 Hope comedy Monsieur Beaucaire, right up to the hero’s surprise execution at the end. But it’s handsome looking, occasionally brilliant, and the lulls don’t last long. The score, comprised solely of music by Sergei Prokofiev, includes well-chosen excerpts from “The Lieutenant Kijé Suite,” “Alexander Nevsky,” “The Love for Three Oranges,” the String Quintet in E and “Scythian Suite” for Orchestra.\n\nThe Night of the Iguana (1964) After A Streetcar Named Desire, the finest of all Tennessee Williams screen adaptations. John Huston, the director and with Anthony Veiller co-scenarist, working in Gabriel Figueroa’s luminous black-and-white cinematography, enhanced what was effective in Williams’ 1961 drama (the characters, the situation, the dialogue and the jungle-like Mexican atmosphere) and removed what was superfluous (the 1940 time-frame and the German Nazi tourists), crafting a genuinely cinematic experience that is also a faithful interpretation of a great American dramatist’s last important play. Richard Burton has one of his best movie roles as the Reverend Dr. T. Lawrence Shannon, a disgraced minister driven by circumstance to shepherding a bus full of middle-aged church ladies around Mexico, drinking too much, fending off the advances of a hormonally unbalanced teenage girl, and being put into a blind panic by all of it. Shot largely in Puerto Vallarta, then little but “a remote fishing village” but which the unrelenting paparazzi fixation on The Liz and Dick Show eventually helped turned into an exclusive resort which I assume the fishermen and their families could no longer afford to live in, The Night of the Iguana exhibits throughout the sort of supple artistic control Huston lavished on material that really engaged him. Williams of course was continually drawn to his twin themes of the sacred versus the profane and the struggle of the sensitive to survive brutality; here he embodies the former in Shannon’s battle with his own nature (and the nature of the girl, and of the earthy widow who’s got her eye on him) and the latter through the character of the gentle spinster Hannah Jelkes, companion to her grandfather, an aged poet embarked on his last tour and hopeful of completing his latest poem before the little strokes that beset him carry his fragile spirit away.\n\nI hope I don’t make The Night of the Iguana sound deadly, because it’s the furthest thing from that, and not least because of Huston’s superb cast. As Maxine Faulk, the lusty widow of Shannon’s oldest friend, Ava Gardner gives what is probably her finest performance — dallying with two strange maraca-playing Mexican youths (Fidelmar Durán and Roberto Leyva) out of her anger at, and jealousy over, Shannon, laying out her disappointments in invective yet capable of great kindness. As Hannah, Deborah Kerr is an utterly transcendent figure, not fluttery and self-deluding as Blanche Du Bois or Alma Winemiller in Summer and Smoke are or driven to ruthlessness like Maggie the Cat but practical-minded and, despite her genteel poverty, filled with compassion for the sufferings of others, even those like Shannon whom she correctly suggests enjoy their own mental anguish. She, and Cyril Delevanti as the poet Nonno, are deeply moving; when Nonno recites his final poem while his granddaughter takes it down, it would take a stonier constitution than mine not to melt before the beauty both of the language and Delevanti’s becalmed, ancient face. Before that consummate event, during her long discussion with the immobilized Shannon, Miss Jelks observes, “Nothing human disgusts me, Mr. Shannon, unless it is unkind or violent.” This seems to me Williams’ response to the Roman playwright Terence’s “Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum puto.” (“I am human: I consider nothing human is alien to me.”) Interestingly, as Williams wrote it Hannah’s line concludes “unless it is unkind, violent.” Someone (Huston and Veiller, or perhaps Kerr herself) altered it slightly, and for the better. Poetic expression like that can work onstage but is not as easily digested in the more realistic medium of film.\n\nSue Lyon, the physically overripe Lolita of the Kubrick picture two years earlier, fully captures what Orson Welles once called the insanity of adolescence, careening from her lubricious crush on Shannon to suddenly hating him to switching her allegiance to the tour’s young bus driver (James “Skip” Ward). Mary Boylan does wonders with the brow-beaten tourist Miss Peebles, but Grayson Hall steals every scene she’s in as Lyons’ chaperone Miss Fellowes, a woman clearly in the thrall of her own Lesbian obsession but, as a convention-minded church choral director, unwilling or unable to see it for what it is. Although the movie could be seen as cruel toward the character, even her chief nemesis Shannon is at pains to protect her from the self-knowledge he correctly believes would destroy her. Benjamin Frankel composed a beautiful score for the picture, Huston’s best work between The African Queen and The Kremlin Letter. Yet in his infinite wisdom and renowned critical perspicacity, Leonard Maltin in his movie guide deems this poetic masterpiece a “plodding tale.” He would.\n\nBroadway Danny Rose (1984) I’ve never quite been able to reconcile the snideness and cynicism of Woody Allen with some of the pictures he’s made that suggest a sweeter soul than he generally displays. Are they the result of calculation merely? Broadway Danny Rose is one of those seemingly incongruous movies, an openhearted paean to the losers of show-biz that is both unexpectedly moving and sidesplittingly funny. Told as a long, shaggy-dog anecdote by Sandy Baron to a table of his fellow comedians at the Carnegie Deli, the picture doesn’t make fun of Danny’s acts, such as the stuttering ventriloquist or the balloon-folding couple, as much as it laughs at Danny’s unflappability — his unshakable belief that any one of his stable of barely employable clients could become wealthy and famous. It’s easy to laugh at a man who keeps reminding these pathetic acts to say to themselves, “Smile, star, strong,” yet Danny genuinely loves and care for these bottom-feeders, and the casual way he’s betrayed by his favorite, a washed-up singer called Lou Canova (Nick Apollo Forte) and Lou’s Mafia-connected mistress Tina (Mia Farrow) shatters him. For once in an Allen performance the pain isn’t just a story point indifferently acted; when near the end Tina unexpectedly shows up at the tatty Thanksgiving dinner Danny holds for his clients the look of deep hurt on Allen’s face is remarkable.\n\nGordon Willis shot the movie in thick-grained black-and-white, and the picture’s look renders the action as a modern fable, remembered not from a distant past but recounted at best a few months later. Among the comics at the Carnegie, in addition to Baron, are Jackie Gayle, Will Jordan (when people imitate Ed Sullivan, if indeed they still do, they’re really imitating Jordan’s impersonation of Sullivan) and Allen’s then-manager Jack Rollins, and Milton Berle, Howard Cosell and Joe Franklin also appear as themselves. Gina DeAngelis is marvelous as a vindictive Mob mother and Farrow, hiding behind smoked eyeglasses, gives a terrific comic performance as the sort of woman no one would ever mistake her for (or, up to the time of the movie, ever thought her capable of enacting.) Among the comic pleasures of Broadway Danny Rose is a hysterically funny sequence in the warehouse in which Macy’s Thanksgiving Day balloons are stored involving Danny, Tina, a gun-wielding hood and the unexpected release of helium.\n\nIt’s a Wonderful Life (1946) There has probably never been a more manipulative, counterfeit “populist” in American movies than Frank Capra, and this perennial holiday favorite (a dud in its time which only became popular through loss of its copyright) is the perfect illustration of that. What Capra did well, such as depicting the dark corners of American platitudes, he did exceptionally well here, as when James Stewart’s George Bailey rejects a weeping Donna Reed and marriage even as he’s embracing her in desperation, or when with his life in tatters he hugs his young son, or as with tears in his eyes he’s praying in a bar for a deliverance he doesn’t believe possible. (Capra realized too late that he needed to move the camera in and when Stewart said he couldn’t perform the scene again, resorted to a slow optical printer zoom.) Casting is half the battle here, and in James Stewart Capra got a man capable of both enormous charm and pitch-black despair; it was George Bailey that led the critic David Denby several years ago to claim that Stewart was the greatest actor in American movies, a sentiment with which I wholly concur.\n\nAlas, what Capra did badly is in even greater abundance in It’s a Wonderful Life: That cloying, mealy-mouthed (and patently phony) embrace of treacly platitudes that mars if it does not ruin every picture of his except It Happened One Night. It’s particularly galling when one knows that Capra, although he publicly proclaimed himself a populist, loathed and distrusted people, in groups or singly, and privately worshiped fascism, adopting the political traits and impulses of the natural-born reactionary. His “convictions” tended to be those of his principal screenwriter, Robert Riskin, from which he ran in terror during the Blacklist years. It’s telling that Capra is one of four scenarists credited on It’s a Wonderful Life, because George Bailey’s dilemma is his director’s as well, that of a man who hates what he believes he’s supposed to love. I don’t mind that Capra, along with the husband-and-wife team of Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett (and Jo Swerling, who also worked on the script) lards on the ironies with a trowel or even that he paints George’s antagonist Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) as an irredeemable villain whose fangs fairly drip with poison like the spider George compares him to so much as I do his concomitant wallowing in sentimentality; that bit about bells and angels’ wings makes my teeth ache.\n\nAlthough Capra was too profligate with money for the picture to ever show a profit, it must also be admitted that having built an entire town on the backlot, he used it effectively. The cinematography by his gifted director of photography Joseph Walker (with Joseph Biroc) is exceptional as well, and Dimitri Tiomkin’s music is less oppressively heavy than was his norm. The director also got, in addition to Stewart and Reed, lovely and/or thoroughly engaging performances from a large cast including Thomas Mitchell, Henry Travers, Beulah Bondi, Frank Faylen, Ward Bond, Gloria Grahame, H. B. Warner, Frank Albertson, Todd Karns, Sheldon Leonard, Charles Lane, Carl Switzer, Ellen Corby, Dick Elliott and Bobbie Anderson, who is extraordinary as the young George.\n\nEliot M. Camarena believes the movie depicts the final thoughts of a suicide, and although Capra certainly would have disagreed, it’s an avenue of interpretation worth pursuing.\n\nRadio Days (1987) Woody Allen’s sweetest movie, a loving tribute to the mass medium of his childhood refracted through a fictionalized depiction of his family. It’s also among the writer-director’s most beautiful pictures, shot with a burnished glow by the great Italian cinematographer Carlo Di Palma on Santo Loquasto’s richly designed and executed sets. One could, I suppose, accuse Radio Days of nostalgic excess but the tone is generally so light and amusing it’s a bit like Fellini’s Amarcord translated into American pop iconography. Allen narrates, and his youthful doppelgänger Joe is charmingly played by the young Seth Green, with Julie Kavner and Michael Tucker as his bickering parents. The large ensemble cast includes Joy Newman as Joe’s teenage sister, Josh Mostel as his quarrelsome uncle (“Take the gas pipe!”), Renée Lippin as his equally bovine wife, Mia Farrow as a talentless aspiring actress, Danny Aiello as her would-be mob assassin, Gina DeAngelis as his practical mother, Kenneth Mars as the family’s rabbi, Wallace Shawn as the hilariously incongruous radio voice of The Masked Avenger and Diane Keaton in a lovely New Year’s sequence as a nightclub singer crooning Cole Porter’s “You’d Be So Nice to Come Home To” (and incidentally wiping Farrow’s anemic rendition of “I Don’t Want to Walk Without You” off the screen and out of your memory.) Although Radio Days is a love-letter to Allen’s reminiscences of radio it’s also a Valentine to Dianne Wiest. As young Joe’s chic, marriage-minded Aunt Bea, Wiest is the movie’s vibrant human fulcrum, ever hopeful of romance yet nearly always thwarted; one of her suitors leaves her stranded on the road when he becomes convinced the Martians have landed, another is married and a third (Robert Joy), seemingly the most appropriate match for her, turns out to be grieving the death of his boyfriend.\n\nThe wonderful soundtrack of period recordings includes Benny Goodman’s “Body and Soul,” Glenn Miller’s “In the Mood,” Tommy Dorsey’s “Opus One” and “I’m Gettin’ Sentimental Over You,” Artie Shaw’s “Frenesi,” The Mills Brothers’ “Paper Doll,” Bing Crosby and The Andrews Sisters’ “Pistol Packin’ Mama,” Carmen Miranda’s “South American Way” (to which Newman joyously lip-synchs, accompanied by Tucker and Mostel), The Ink Spots’ “If I Didn’t Care,” Xavier Cugat’s “Babalu” and “One, Two, Three, Kick,” Guy Lombardo’s “That Old Feeling,” Duke Ellington’s “Take the ‘A’ Train” and, in a nice sequence, a then-living link to the past Allen was evoking: The aged Kitty Carlisle performing “They’re Either Too Young or Too Old” on the radio.\n\nThe Band Wagon (1953) Produced by MGM’s Freed Unit the year after Singin’ in the Rain, written (like Rain) by Betty Comden and Adolph Green and based (also like its predecessor) around an existing musical catalog — in this case the elegant songs of Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz — The Band Wagon is usually treated like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. But how fair is to compare any movie against what many people (myself included) regard as the best of all film musicals and find it wanting? For one thing, under the direction of the design-oriented Vincente Minnelli, it looks even better than Singin’ in the Rain. For another, it’s got Fred Astaire.\n\nI hope if you’re reading these pages you don’t need to be told that Astaire was the greatest performer in musicals, or why. Just watching him stroll beside a stationary train with his distinctive walk while softly singing in that inimitable voice the Dietz and Schwartz standard “By Myself” is joyous, and when he gets an opportunity to do what he did best, there is almost no one in movies who could, or can, touch him. Comden and Green used Astaire’s insecurities to flesh out his character, a faded movie star taking a chance on a Broadway show: His concern that Cyd Charisse, his dancing partner in the picture, was too tall for him, for example, or too much of a ballet dancer, or that he had no natural sympathy with or ability to perform Michael Kidd’s stylistic choreography. Despite his fears and as a result of his willingness to be persuaded by people with talent, Astaire gets to do more in The Band Wagon that he had in years, and in more different but related styles. He has a great number with an authentic shoe-shine man (Leroy Daniels) in “Shine on Your Shoes”; a breathtaking pas de deux with Charisse in “Dancing in the Dark“; a charming duet with the wonderful Nanette Fabray in “I Love Louisa” (which he originally performed with his sister Adele in the stage revue, also called The Bandwagon); an uproarious version of “Triplets” with Fabray and Jack Buchanan; a long, funny Mickey Spillane spoof (“The Girl Hunt Ballet,” written by Alan Jay Lerner) that also includes a sexy dance with Charisse which virtually defines the appeal of both partners; and, with Buchanan, an exquisite song-and-dance to one of the most sophisticated ballads ever written, “I Guess I’ll Have to Change My Plan,” gloriously designed by Oliver Smith. Watch the way Astaire slides out of his highchair in “Triplets” and seems to be moving to the floor in graceful slow motion, and marvel that such golden beings once walked the earth.\n\nStreamers (1983) During what I think of as his wilderness years, between the debacle of Popeye (1980) and the triumph of Vincent and Theo (1990), what Robert Altman mostly did was stage plays, and in a few instances, film them. The movie of David Rabe’s excoriating Vietnam-era drama Streamers came just before Altman’s superb condensation of Donald Freed and Arnold M. Stone’s Nixon fantasia Secret Honor (1984) and while neither was seen by nearly enough people (Streamers cost a mere $2 million to make but earned only $378,452) both represent a different way of looking at plays cinematically. Streamers doesn’t feel entirely real, the way McCabe and Mrs. Miller did, or California Split, but it also doesn’t look exactly like a stage play either. Some critics of the movie were bothered by that, and there are times (as with the lack of outside activity around the Army barracks in which it’s set) when the picture does feel hermetically sealed. Yet it’s so well directed, so beautifully lit (the cinematograper was Pierre Mignot) and so magnificently acted by its exceptional cast this slight air of neither-fish-nor-fowlness in no way detracts from the power of the drama.\n\nIn 1975 when Mike Nichols directed the premiere of the play at the Long Wharf, theatre in America was seldom as strong, as confrontational, as violent or as bloody as Streamers, and there were a lot of walk-outs and, in New Haven, Off-Broadway, on Broadway and in Los Angeles, reports of men and women fainting in their theater seats. I’ve always found it interesting that people can sit through all sorts of violence, gore and human viscera being spewed in a movie, the most realistic of all performing artforms, without demur yet are overcome by seeing it done by live actors on a stage. Perhaps the very artificiality of theatre, however heightened its reality, lulls them into such a state of comfortable alienation that the explosion of violence un-moors them. I also confess that I’ve never quite understood the essential situation of Rabe’s play, which primarily concerns sexual tensions in a stateside barracks. While the interior struggle of a draftee to come to grips with his homosexuality is one countless young soldiers have dealt with, in every nation, presumably for centuries, the way Ritchie (Mitchell Lichtenstein) flirts with the others, flaunting what he’s uncertain of himself, doesn’t ring true for 1965, when Streamers is set. Nor do the attitudes of his barracks-mates (Matthew Modine and David Alan Grier) who in a comparable situation would probably have beaten Richie up on a regular basis or otherwise have made him so miserable he would have asked for a transfer. Here they reject his being what they call a “faggot,” but don’t despise him. That, however dismissive, still seems a bit enlightened, if I may use the word, for that time.\n\nHowever, Rabe’s dialogue is so good, the acting here of so high a quality and Altman’s staging of it so effective as to sweep such cavils aside. All of the young men are splendid, but Lichtenstein and the terrifyingly mercurial Michael Wright as the outsider who deliberately stirs the tensions, are better than that, as are Guy Boyd and, especially, George Dzundza, as the veteran officers who float in and out of the action and whose generally drunken presence is a fearful reminder of what is about to happen to the boys when they are finally shipped to Vietnam. Dzundza has a long monologue at the end that, as written and acted, are pocket illustrations both of why American stage drama was once revered, and how much has been lost in the decades since Streamers premiered.\n\nthe birdcage (1996) The latest (and, so far, last) iteration of the popular French stage play by Jean Poiret that became an internationally record-breaking movie in 1978 and a Broadway musical which despite premiering in the age of Reagan, AIDS and rampant public and private bigotry against gay men and Lesbians,* became a long-running, Tony Award-winning hit. The musical La Cage Aux Folles kept its action in Europe (the original creators, who included Tommy Tune, Jay Presson Allen and Maury Yeston, had planned to set theirs in New Orleans); for the movie, wittily written by Elaine May and flavorsomely directed by Mike Nichols, the action was, wisely, moved to South Miami Beach and the central characters made American. (The sole exception is the Guatemalan houseboy Agador, portrayed by Hank Azaria in an achingly funny performance.) The basic plot remains the same: Middle-aged couple consisting of club owner (Robin Williams) and drag star (Nathan Lane) find their son (Dan Futterman) is getting married to the daughter (Calista Flockheart) of a Moral Majority-type Senator (Gene Hackman), himself fleeing the press over a sex-scandal involving his late political partner. Add in the politician’s convention-minded spouse (Dianne Wiest), a conniving National Enquirer reporter (Tom McGowan) and attempts to, variously, temporarily get rid of the drag queen or train him to pass, to remodel the couple’s apartment in Early Conservative and to inveigle the boy’s biological mother (Christine Baranski) to put in an appearance at the dinner party, and pandemonium naturally ensues.\n\nI like this edition of the material better than the original, and infinitely more than the stage musical. May has a way with a comic line that is as distinctive as Larry Gelbart’s or Woody Allen’s. In addition, that master of behavioral direction Mike Nichols was the perfect person to guide an enterprise that, although wildly funny, could if not kept on a believably human line become protracted and silly. Emmanuel Lubezki lit the movie to bring out the pastel surroundings, Jonathan Tunick contributed some characteristic melodies and orchestrations, Stephen Sondheim added a nifty number (“Little Dream”) for Williams to stage with Lane and a sullen dancer, Ann Roth contributed witty costumes, there is some splendid matte work by Robert Stromberg and Mike Wassel, and the cast performs the material with comedic gusto and fresh invention, especially Hackman and Lane. The latter’s beard is noticeable during his scenes as “Mother,” however, proving Billy Wilder right for shooting Some Like it Hot in black-and-white.\n\nYou Only Live Once (1937) A tough, nihilistic Fritz Lang picture starring Sylvia Sidney as an idealistic legal secretary and Henry Fonda as the ex-con she believes in. The screenplay by Gene Towne and Charles Graham Baker sets up Eddie Taylor (Fonda) as such a born loser that when he’s arrested for an armored car robbery and a batch of murders and sentenced to death you know that no matter what else happens, his story is not going to end well. Fonda pitches his soft tenor low, and gravelly, as if Eddie is in a constant state of fury and although the picture lost money his performance in it almost certainly led to better quality projects than he’d enjoyed during his first two years in Hollywood. 15 minutes of the movie were taken out of the original hour and forty minute cut, allegedly for then-extreme violence and it shows; some of the picture’s continuity is off as a result. (The deleted footage is lost and was likely destroyed.) The cinematography by Leon Shamroy, especially in the restored Classic Flix Blu-ray, is striking and Alfred Newman composed a strong score with a lovely main theme for the lovers. If you know and appreciate Newman, you can tell it’s him from the first notes of the main title.\n\nThe Romantic Englishwoman (1975) I don’t really know what to say about this British curio directed by the expatriate American blacklistee Joseph Losey except that it’s well acted (Glenda Jackson, Michael Caine and Helmut Berger are the leads), occasionally witty (the screenplay is by Tom Stoppard and Thomas Wiseman out of the latter’s novel), beautifully photographed (by Gerry Fisher, who at times almost makes Glenda Jackson look attractive) and engagingly scored (by Richard Hartley). But it’s such an elliptical chimera of a movie that with very few changes it could have been a Harold Pinter play, and I don’t mean that as a compliment. And while in real life Berger, who plays a sociopathic drug smuggler and pathological liar, identified as bisexual, his performance as a part-time heterosexual gigolo is, shall we say, less than convincing. What with his pronounced lisp and languid, piss-elegant walk we keep expecting him to come on to Caine rather than Jackson. Surely that’s not what was intended?\n\nMan’s Favorite Sport? (1963) An intermittently hilarious variation by Howard Hawks on Bringing Up Baby, with Rock Hudson in the unenviable position of working up a sub-par imitation of Cary Grant and Paula Prentiss not evoking Katharine Hepburn and thereby coming off much better. In John Fenton Murray and Steve McNeil’s screenplay, Hudson is a fishing expert at Abercrombie & Fitch who has never fished in his life and who is bedeviled by the determinedly wacky Prentiss, who enters him into a prominent fishing competition and then must teach him everything he needs to know in three days. The picture is buoyed by Hawks’ expert way with comic set-ups and dialogue, by Russell Harlan’s scrumptious color photography, by a bouncy main title song by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer, some very funny sight gags (the look a bear gives the camera as it rides by on a runaway motorbike is priceless) and by the sparkling supporting cast which includes John McGiver, Roscoe Karns, James Westerfield, Regis Toomey, Forrest Lewis and, as a phlegmatic professional Indian, Norman Alden. Prentiss can’t match Hepburn’s originality in Baby, but she is an original nonetheless, especially when she laughs, which is often. Hawks later said of her that she was fine but couldn’t remember what she’d done from take to take, creating continuity problems. Yet she’s so engaging you don’t notice the technical flaws. Why her performance here didn’t lead to better opportunities than What’s New, Pussycat? is one of those eternal mysteries. Hudson is in his own way a good comedian, but it’s almost impossible to watch him in this role and not think of Grant, to Hudson’s detriment. Cary Grant’s touch with a comedic line was nonpareil and, like Fred Astaire, when he walked across a room there was no mistaking him. Hudson walks like a former truck driver.\n\nLove Me Tonight (1932) This frothy, Lubitsch-like musical concoction is often regarded as one of the greatest of all movie musicals. It isn’t quite that, but it’s extremely entertaining, imaginatively directed, smartly written and beautifully scored. The director, Rouben Mamoulian, does some nice things, such as the way he hands off “Isn’t It Romantic?” from Maurice Chevalier — who sings it satirically — to various characters in Paris, on a train out of town and in the suburbs where in Jeanette MacDonald’s voice it becomes a soaring ballad. The songs are by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, and Hart also wrote some of the dialogue, in rhyming couplets, which sounds rather fey but, as staged and acted, is charming. (The score includes “Lover,” “Mimi” and the title song.) The script, by Samuel Hoffenstein, George Marion Jr. and Waldemar Young, is light and witty, built on Graustarkian implausibilities cleverly worked out. Victor Milner’s cinematography is extraordinary, and the delightful supporting cast includes the peerless Charles Ruggles as an impoverished vicomte; Charles Butterworth as MacDonald’s thwarted would-be swain; Myrna Loy as a man-mad comtesse; Elizabeth Patterson, Ethel Griffies and Blanche Friderici as a trio of dizzy aunts; Robert Greig as a major domo; and C. Aubrey Smith as the imperious duke who rules all of their lives. If you like Chevalier, as I do, you’ll be entranced by his performance as the exuberant Parisian tailor, but as the princess above his station MacDonald is a little tough to take at times, especially when we’re exhorted by the director to gaze upon those vaguely homely shopgirl’s features of hers and pretend she’s a great beauty.\n\nA Boy Named Charlie Brown (1969) The first Peanuts feature was wildly successful in its time, and broke Disney’s exclusive hold on big-screen animation. Charles M. Schulz’s screenplay, based on the notion of Charlie Brown being entered into a national spelling bee, is a charmer; it retains, and builds on, the characteristics of the strip that made it so unique and treasurable through the decades. Although I think that in his direction of the Peanuts features and TV specials Bill Melendez often flattened out the look of Schulz’s renderings, and occasionally made them downright ugly, his direction of the picture is assured, inventive (lots of split screens) and often very funny. While Snoopy’s skating/hockey fantasy at the Rockefeller Center rink is perfectly in keeping with his character the long Schroeder sequence set to his playing the Beethoven “Pathetique,” is a more puzzling inclusion, but most of what’s in the movie is entirely apt.\n\nThe musical score is variable, what with Rod McKuen’s typically gauzy ballad — why, during what is obviously the school year, does he twice invoke August afternoons, and what exactly is this “kind of magic that only little boys can do”? — vying with John Scott Trotter’s arrangements of the familiar Vince Guaraldi themes, but the vocal casting is not only just right it’s nearly definitive: Peter Robbins’ distinctive husky rendering of Charlie Brown, Pamelyn Ferdin’s conclusive Lucy van Pelt, Glenn Gilger’s gently philosophical Linus and Erin Sullivan’s entirely adorable Sally Brown.\n\nBelow, a newspaper advertisement for the weirdest movie coupling I think I’ve ever seen. It’s like an entry in one of those competitions to find the least (or most) appropriate double-feature.\n\nThis could be a satirical mock-up. I sincerely hope it is. We’re Hanging You from Your Nipples, Charlie Brown!\n\nThe Jungle Book (1967) I ended 2022 revisiting one of my earliest movie loves. I was the perfect age when this one was released to embrace a new Disney animated feature. As a cartoon-mad child, Walt Disney was at the center of my imaginative world; when he died in December of 1966, I was as stunned and saddened as I had been when my beloved maternal great-grandmother passed away in her sleep the year before. Remember, “The Wonderful World of Color” was a television fixture in those years, and the presence of Walt himself, although he appeared less often then than he had in the early days of its previous iteration (“Walt Disney Presents”) was still occasionally a part of that weekly experience.\n\nAlthough my sister and I saw Cinderella in 1965, the reissue of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, to which my mother took me on a memorable afternoon in 1967, made so marked an impression on me that I have for years mistakenly believed it was my first animated feature. I tended to obsession even then, and Snow White was the focus of my six-year-old’s ardor for several months… until The Jungle Book arrived and I went duly gaga over it: I had the special double-length Gold Key Giant Jungle Book comic (I wore the cover off that one through obsessive re-reading), Jungle Book Disneykins figurines from Royal Pudding, Jungle Book temporary tattoos, a Jungle Book oil-paint-by-numbers kit, the wonderful Joe Liptak-designed Jungle Book View Master pack, a Jungle Book Whitman frame-tray puzzle, a Jungle Book coloring book, Jungle Book books, and, of course, the Jungle Book soundtrack album, whose surface I eventually wore to the smooth consistency of a hockey-puck. (My poor parents.) Seeing the picture again in its 1990 re-release I was considerably less enthusiastic, and not merely due to being 20 years older. Yet it’s remarkable what an additional three decades can do for a picture, and to your perception of it. Seeing The Jungle Book again in 2022 I still think, as I did going to the 1978 and 1990 reissues, that it’s too self-consciously (and anachronistically) hip for its own good, especially in Phil Harris’ and Louis Prima’s likable but slangy vocal performances. The rich character designs (by Bill Peet and Ken Anderson) and backgrounds (Al Dempster), however, are superb and the animation wonderfully expressive, particularly that by Milt Kahl, John Lounsbery, Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, who animated most of the picture by themselves.\n\nCavils aside, although I’ve seen The Jungle Book numerous times since it was first released I don’t think I’ve enjoyed it as much since the age of six as I did watching it again on New Year’s Eve.\n\n*I have never, and will never, employ “LGBT” or any of its increasingly ludicrous (and increasingly wearisome) acronyms for the so-called gay community. You would think any politician who panders by routinely mouthing such barbarisms as “LGBTQIA2S+” would find the letters causing his or her tongue to cleave to the roof of his or her mouth. Further, I will not be a party to pushing transgenderism, either as a part of that “community” or otherwise, especially to the self-questioning young. My reasons are manifold. First, until relatively recently, transsexuals did not wish to be considered as having anything in common with Lesbians and gay men, and I am perfectly happy to honor their previous wishes indefinitely… especially when they push gay men entirely out of leadership positions at Pride events, as happened two summers ago in New York. Second, I resent the coopting for its own highly suspicious reasons by the unbalanced Woke of a movement that did so much, beginning in 1969, to make my life less anxious. Third, when I was a youth the term was simply “gay,” period, which always seemed entirely sufficient. Later the acronym was “GLB,” although few of us trusted bisexuals, for good reason; they may have affairs with us but they nearly always go back to safe, heterosexual pairings. Besides, no one asked me whether I minded taking the second seat to gay women, who make up a mere 16% of the self-identifying gay population. (I did, and I do. Is this a social movement, or imprecations for dealing with a shipwreck, where the women must be gotten to the lifeboats first?) Fourth, I do not see the advantage, aside perhaps from providing political comfort, of labeling oneself in any way. Fifth, and perhaps most important: These labels are not used to unite. They are intended to divide, and are being used to do just that. Did the veterans of the Stonewall riots really put their bodies on the line so that one day children could have their hormones blocked and their breasts and genitals removed and have know-nothing college students claim, without citing the slightest evidence, that evil white gay men removed blacks and Latinos from the movement?\n\nText copyright 2023 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nWhen it comes to which of Charles Chaplin’s masterworks seems the greater I generally take a leaf from the late John Simon, who once wrote that his favorite of these two “silent” classics was whichever one he’d watched most recently. I often think City Lights has the edge until I see Modern Times again, and then I’m not sure. The latter has the appealing Paulette Goddard, a beautifully composed finale, Charlie caught in the cogs of a factory machine, performing French and Italian-laced gibberish as a singing waiter and one of the greatest of all movie scores. But the former has, among other beauties, a final shot that James Agee deemed “the highest moment in movies.” Seeing them both again recently via their lovely Criterion editions I am even more firmly convinced that the tie is justified.\n\nI find it telling that City Lights received no nominations from the then-young Motion Picture Academy for its annual awards, especially since in 1928 that union-busting organization had given Chaplin a special citation for The Circus. (And even though this same august body found space on its 1931 “Best Picture” roster for the lively but hardly artistic Five-Star Final.) I strongly suspect the studio establishment was not best pleased by Charlie’s feature-length twitting of “talking pictures.” The satire begins immediately; in the opening sequence a statue is about to be unveiled and the “voices” of the mayor and the female dignitary on the soundtrack are obviously the sounds of a kazoo in the mouth of a jester. Chaplin is poking fun not merely at the empty platitudes of public speeches but at the very notion of recording sound and matching it to moving image. (The woman’s vocal dying fall at the end of her speech is especially funny.) The tripartite statue too seems to sneer at the industry’s self-imposed censorial standards: The figure on the left literally thumbs the Tramp’s nose at the audience while the one on the right, when Chaplin slides down the sword that has pierced his ragged trousers onto its face, almost seems to be rimming him. Such comic moments may have buttressed the arguments of the moralists who habitually sniffed that Chaplin was vulgar. There’s no Puritanism as strained as the Hollywood variety.\n\nChaplin spent nearly two years filming City Lights, junking footage and entire sequences, shutting down, rethinking his scenario when he wasn’t satisfied and starting over again. It was how he’d become accustomed to making his pictures, and how many of the great silent comedies were made, but Chaplin was virtually alone in continuing to work that way after the silent era ended. Then again, unlike almost everyone else, Charlie owned the studio. He could afford to be perfect. And while there is no recorded dialogue in the movie, it’s fully, and wonderfully, scored. One of the least discussed aspects of City Lights is the quality (and indeed the quantity) of Chaplin’s music. Most historians cite Max Steiner’s 1933 King Kong score as the first true landmark of the talkie era but two years earlier Chaplin, a musical amateur with no formal training, composed over 100 cues for a score that runs the length of the picture and is as beguiling to hear as City Lights itself is to see. Even granting that he utilized José Padilla’s “La Violetera” as the theme for the blind flower girl played by Virginia Cherrill with whom the Tramp is in love (and without that composer’s permission, which cost him later) and, further, that Arthur Johnston filled out his hummed compositions and orchestrated them, the music Chaplin created for the picture is astonishing. The score is a reflection of the Little Fellow’s soul: Elegant, romantic, buoyant, dynamic, wistful. And nowhere more than at the finale, which elevates and intensifies an already supernally moving moment.\n\nCity Lights isn’t a perfect work of art. As beautifully as Chaplin works out the reason, remarkable in a silent picture, the flower girl believes the Tramp to be a wealthy man, the subplot involving the dipsomaniacal millionaire (Harry Myers) who only remembers the Tramp is his friend when he’s plastered is purest hokum. Additionally, the notion that a young woman presumably blind from childhood will be able to see if she gets an expensive European operation is patently absurd. Yet both threads are absolutely essential to the picture, so you either take them as they are and enjoy the way a master filmmaker exercises them, or you give up on the whole thing. Like Spielberg with Close Encounters, Chaplin had un-credited co-scenarists (oh, but how much better does it look when the credits read, “Produced, written and directed by…”!); in this case, Harry Carr and Harry Crocker. Both ideas may for all I know have been theirs, although Chaplin himself clung to the outmoded narrative forms of his early years. But whereas in any other type of contemporary movie of the 1930s those two clichés, endemic to the storyline, would be insurmountable obstacles to success, this is a Chaplin picture, and Chaplin pictures existed in their own special, late Victorian strata.\n\nFortunately, for all its contrivance and sentiment, City Lights is full of Chaplin’s inspired comedy: The opening with the statuary; Charlie and the sidewalk elevator; the attempt to dissuade the millionaire from suicide that lands Charlie in the drink; the Tramp as a street-sweeper confronting the sight of an elephant; the hilarious boxing match against Hank Mann. Yet it’s the feeling of the picture we remember, and Chaplin’s extreme close-up at the end, which Agee deemed the “greatest single piece of acting ever committed to celluloid.” If that moment, and this movie, fail to move you, your heart may be a dishrag.\n\nI alluded earlier to the moralists for whom Chaplin was de trop. Those Puritans must have choked on their popcorn when they got a load of Modern Times, where the Little Fellow, his nerves destroyed by what would now rather prettily be called repetitive motion sickness (otherwise known as wage slavery) through repeatedly and mechanistically tightening two bolts on an endless succession of small boards becomes a fully human Pan, lasciviously turning his wrenches into satyr’s horns and chasing first a curvy secretary with large buttons on the back of her dress and then a matronly woman (Juana Sutton) on the street, two of whose dress buttons, uproariously and somewhat shockingly, are affixed over her breasts like enormous round areolae. When Charlie takes after her with, as the proprietor of Funk’s House of Geekery hilariously terms it, “the sole purpose of twisting her nipples off,” it’s side-splitting. (Although I imagine the entire sequence would now be decried by the professionally Woke as beyond the pale.)\n\nThere’s nothing amusing about a nervous breakdown, of course… unless it’s depicted by a genius.* It isn’t the fact that the briefly-employed Tramp is suffering that is hilarious, it’s how he suffers, and what happens when he does. And it’s all funny, even when the system inflicting the damage on him is operating at its most vicious, as when in an excruciatingly funny bit Charlie is made the guinea pig for an outlandish self-feeding machine designed to save the bosses money, or when he’s literally sucked into the capitalist maw. Like “legendary,” the word “iconic” is overused with such whorish abandon these days one hesitates ever to write it, but when Charlie is pulled into the machinery, the moment is both funny and an eternal metaphor for the worker who exists only as a cog in a rapacious corporate machine. Not for nothing did Chaplin use his own casting director Al Ernest Garcia, who resembled Henry Ford, as the oppressive factory owner who through a futuristic television apparatus barks out orders at his employees and even spies on them in the lavatory. Yet another reason Hollywood had a hard time with Charlie: He critiqued businessmen, something the studios were loath to do — and which the Production Code office clucked its Catholic tongue over. As with City Lights, Modern Times received no Academy Award nominations, either for Best Picture, Actor, Writer, Director or Score. (Quick: Name the winners!) It’s telling too that the only voices we hear in the picture come from sources of reproduction: That two-way television screen for example, and the self-satisfied recorded sales pitch for the feeding machine so pitilessly demonstrated on the Little Fellow. Charles Chaplin knew his onions.\n\nThat the filmmaker’s sympathies were with the working class was apparent long before City Lights. While the Tramp began as a convenient persona on which to build slapstick gags he had developed, by 1931, into a kind of symbol for the downtrodden — who are, as that word implies, constantly being trod upon by the larger society. It should also be remembered that Chaplin came from dire, Dickensian poverty. Sure as hell he never forgot it. It’s no accident that while he had no formal political allegiances one of the most striking scenes in Modern Times (a black-and-white movie) occurs when, seeing a red “danger” flag fall off the back of a lumber truck the Tramp picks it up and as he’s shouting at the driver and waving it in the air to attract his attention, a line of marchers comes around the corner and falls in behind him. Charlie suddenly appears to be leading a worker’s protest… which is promptly beaten into submission by the cops. Police were the bane of most stage and silent movie comics, of course, but lest anyone miss the point, Chaplin the composer accompanies the sequence with “Hallelujah, I’m a Bum,” that old marching anthem of the Wobblies.\n\nSpeaking of music: Modern Times has a score by Chaplin that is not only even better than the one he came up with for City Lights but one of the finest ever created for an American movie. I discovered the early ’70s United Artists label reissue of its 1950s soundtrack album in my local library when I was 10 and was absolutely knocked out by it. At the time all I really knew of movie scores, aside from some Disneys and a couple of musicals — and of course hearing music while seeing movies — was the Rózsa compilation LP in my parents’ small record collection (Great Movie Themes Composed by Miklós Rózsa, MGM Records, SE-4112) and the Chaplin didn’t sound like anything I’d ever heard. I couldn’t have explained my reaction, especially since I had yet to see Modern Times and wouldn’t until I was in my 20s but it felt somehow European in tone. Perhaps because it was written for a picture with almost no dialogue it was dense in a way that struck a deep chord in me. The factory music was so fast and so perfectly timed it was dizzying; Alfred Newman, who conducted it, cannot be praised highly enough. David Raksin, who served in the same capacity as Arthur Johnson on City Lights but who refused to be one of Chaplin’s yes-men, was surely largely responsible for the sound of the Modern Times score, the richest Charlie ever composed. I’m not suggesting Raksin came up with the tunes, merely that, as Chaplin’s arranger, he filtered them through his own strong sensibilities and enriched them the way only a great musician can.†\n\nCity Lights and Modern Times are very different movies but they’re very definitely Chaplin pictures, and not merely because Charlie is their star. They share his sensibilities and his sense of construction as well as that uncanny ability of his to build a comic situation and then to top it so that even the darkest of concepts can leave his audience helpless with laughter yet wholly cognizant of the humanity that lies beneath the gags. A number of comic technicians have been as funny as Chaplin, or even funnier. The way Keaton, for example, could amass a sequence of gags surpasses almost everyone else in the business, and sometimes eclipsed even Chaplin himself. But except in The General Buster lacked Charlie’s warmth and sense of pathos. Most of the time he didn’t need them, and when he tried to emulate what was innate in Chaplin but outside of himself, he was wholly at sea; the best he could come up with in the way of emotion in Go West, for example, was to sentimentally tether himself to a soulful moo-cow.\n\nAs I’ve said, neither picture is, strictly speaking, a silent movie. Both contain full musical scores and sound effects, often very funny in themselves, and while Modern Times does not include Charlie’s speaking voice, we do hear him sing Léo Daniderff’s “Je cherche après Titine” (usually abbreviated as “Titine”) with those gibberish lyrics, and thanks to Chaplin’s genius at pantomime we follow the action of the story-song through every made-up word. Alas, even Chaplin could not resist the permanent assault of talkies; Modern Times is the last time we will see the Tramp, who cannot exist as a dialogue character. It didn’t help that Chaplin’s own speaking voice comes across in his talking pictures as self-consciously cultivated, and over-emphatic. His narration, added to the 1942 reissue of The Gold Rush, all but ruins that masterpiece; it’s a pompous Victorian’s idea of how a narrative text should be read. Worse, when Chaplin turned to dialogue he caught Importantitis, leading to such horrors as that terrible, endless speech of his at the climax of The Great Dictator. Billy Wilder once likened Chaplin’s “ideas,” and his giving voice to them, to “a child of eight writing lyrics to Beethoven’s Ninth.”\n\nSo even Charlie Chaplin capitulated to the times, at least as regards the Little Fellow. When he walks with Paulette Goddard toward the camera at the end of Modern Times and the angle switches, showing as us their backs as they saunter arm-in-arm down the open road, it’s the end of the Tramp. The poem is over. He’s finally gotten the girl, and there’s nothing, really, left to say. Any words from his mouth after that would have been entirely unwelcome, and almost obscene.\n\nBoth pictures contain brilliant, beautifully planned and sustained set-pieces, more in Modern Times than in City Lights. The earlier picture has the great prizefight sequence, in which the Tramp cannily keeps the referee between himself and Mann, gets tangled up in the bell and through his movements causes it to ring repeatedly and, in what is arguably the high point, sails across the canvas like Popeye in a Fleischer cartoon. (If you watch closely you can see the cables used to fly him. You can also see him holding onto some sort of black lead when he’s being pulled into the cogs in Modern Times.) The later movie opens with the assembly line and continues with the Tramp’s riotous and at the same time elegant breakdown; Charlie thwarting an attempted jail-break; taking a leaf from Buster Keaton by accidentally launching the frame of a ship; takes him through a hair-raising roller-skating routine in the department store; and, finally, catches him up in a human maelstrom at the restaurant in which thanks to the patrons dancing he is unable to serve a diner his duck dinner.\n\nThere are also, in both movies, moments that no doubt still raise eyebrows today. The Production Code existed when City Lights was made but was not enforced; it was in full effect five years later, so some of what Chaplin gets away with is jaw-dropping. Aside from the nipple gag, in Modern Times the Tramp also accidentally ingests cocaine left by a fellow convict in a saltshaker and, later, both he and a minister’s wife experience flatulence while drinking tea.‡ Chaplin also had an odd tendency when the Tramp is trying to ingratiate himself with other men, especially those who frighten him, to interlace his fingers, pose his body somewhat seductively, and grin with his teeth. It’s meant as a sign of fear, defensiveness and desperation, but the men invariably interpret it as a come-on.§ (In City Lights the fighter played by Hank Mann gets up and disrobes behind a curtain in disgust, although the Tramp’s cellmate in Modern Times merely glares at him and goes back to his needlepoint.) It’s the sort of thing that decades later led a modestly talented comedian and future filmmaker to opine in a 1980s interview that he preferred Buster Keaton because Chaplin “acted like a fag.”\n\nSomeone on the Criterion City Lights extras suggests that, although Virginia Cherrill’s lack of experience as an actress and her casual attitude toward work drove Chaplin mad, her reactions onscreen are more candid and less formally “dramatic” than might have been the case had a more seasoned actress played the blind girl. This notion is borne out by watching Paulette Goddard’s performance in Modern Times. Chaplin photographs her with love (they had a common-law marriage at the time) and there are more close-ups of her in the picture than is the norm for him. But although she’s utterly charming, her big moments, of smiles or of tears, are too studied, and too overdone, to move the viewer the way the more amateurish (and perhaps more pliable?) Cherrill does at the end of City Lights.\n\nBut then, the climax of Modern Times is merely moving. The finale of City Lights shatters you.\n\n*The only comparably funny nervous collapses I can think of are Oliver Hardy’s in Saps at Sea, Walter Matthau’s brief one in The Odd Couple, Richard Mulligan’s in the Blake Edwards comedy S.O.B., Herbert Lom’s in Edwards’ Inspector Clouseau series, and a few in cartoons animated by Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng and Tex Avery. Geniuses all.\n\n†Edward B. Powell also contributed arrangements for the score, and received on-screen credit.\n\n‡I’m referring to borborygmi, not breaking wind. John Huston and James Agee gave Bogart the same gag 15 years later in The African Queen, also over tea.\n\n§These examples are mild compared to the moment in the 1915 Essanay short Shanghaied in which the Tramp has a highly suggestive encounter with a flirtatious cabin boy played by Lee Hill. Charlie guides the youth to another part of the boat, kisses his forehead, doffs his hat and cane and even begins removing his jacket before he’s distracted by something off-stage and walks away, leaving the shrugging boy behind.\n\nText copyright 2022 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nJanuary 2022\n\nCharade (1963) Peter Stone’s deliciously intricate (and wholly improbable) comic/romantic thriller paired the two most charming actors in American movies for a romp that turned out to be one of the best entertainments of its age and which remains completely entrancing today. Audrey Hepburn is the bright, and resolutely un-hysterical, damsel in distress and Cary Grant is her knight and protector… or is he? Although the May-September pairing here replicates the perennial problem Hepburn had in being so poised and mature in her person that only older men seemed right for her, she and Grant were the reigning charmers of their time, so their meeting on the screen was probably inevitable. Fortunately that event was cocooned in a witty script by Stone, stylish direction by Stanley Donen, a prototypically snazzy Henry Mancini score with dark undertones and a plangent theme song containing a set of lyrics by Johnny Mercer which reflect his increasingly searching outlook during the period; all of his and Mancini’s important songs — “Moon River,” “Days of Wine and Roses,” “Charade,” “Whistling in the Dark” — convey a misty philosophical yearning, wedded to exquisite metaphor. Although the violence (and when not seen, its aftermath) is occasionally grisly, especially for the early ’60s, it’s offset by the taut thriller elements, like the nerve-wracking climax at the Paris Opéra. There’s also a superbly staged, photographed and edited fight on a slanted Parisian rooftop between Grant and a one-armed, lethal hook-wielding George Kennedy as the most frightening of the men seeking a stolen treasure. (The others are James Coburn, Ned Glass and, if you’ll forgive me giving a bit of the game away, Walter Matthau.)\n\nAlthough Charade premiered just four years after North by Northwest, Cary Grant had aged perceptively in the interim: The distinctive jawline isn’t quite as firmly sculpted, and the hair is noticeably grayer. Despite the encroachments of the years, however, he remained the finest light comedian American movies ever produced, and one of its sexiest men. His lithe, feline physicality would be the envy of many males half his age, and his pleasing screen persona was entirely undiminished. When Hepburn asks, “Do you know what’s wrong with you?” and, smiling, answers her own question with a breathless, “Nothing,” it’s almost impossible to disagree.\n\nThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) Although at 68 he was still in full command of his material, John Ford faced studio cost-cutting on this picture which forced him to shoot on Paramount backlots, and in black-and-white. These limitations, added to his stars (John Wayne and James Stewart) being decades too old for their roles, impose an artificiality that this otherwise great, sad autumnal work has to struggle mightily to overcome. (Lee Van Cleef, who appears as one of Lee Marvin’s minions, claims that Paramount also imposed Wayne on Ford as box-office insurance, and that, probably as a result, Ford was even more cruel than usual toward his favorite star. Well, Stewart was still too old.) That it succeeds so well in spite of these compromises says something about Ford, about those two actors, and about the durability of the narrative. Based by the screenwriters James Warner Bellah and Willis Goldbeck on Dorothy M. Johnson’s terse, downbeat short story, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is very much a John Ford movie, concerned this time with truth vs illusion and meditating on the wounds of impossible love. It’s a beautifully observed picture, wonderfully acted and if we ache to see what Ford and his gifted director of photography William H. Clothier might have achieved in real locations, its themes are perfectly plain. Anyone who thinks Ford is endorsing the “Print the legend” philosophy spoken by the Western editor at the end misses the point: Stewart comes clean about his own (in the literal sense) legendary past, and people would rather believe the lie than accept the heartbreakingly ironic truth. You’ve only to open a newspaper today to see how much Americans still need to believe in mythology.\n\nDespite his superannuated appearance, Stewart gives his customary rich performance, and Vera Miles, as the young woman of interest to both men, is exquisite. She was obviously growing as an actress; why the hell did her subsequent career not reflect how good she’d become? It’s bracing to see the usually triumphant John Wayne playing, not a loser exactly but a man who loses what he loves through an act designed to bring happiness to the object of his desire, and he does it with an almost shocking bitterness. Lee Marvin, as Valance, unleashes a psychotic energy that, when it breaks, is terrifying. Edmund O’Brien, as the newspaper publisher Peabody, is delicious, and that genial tub of guts Andy Devine provides comic relief as a cowardly schnorrer of a marshal. Among the generally splendid cast are the almost impossibly pulchritudinous Woody Strode, Jeanette Nolan, John Qualen, John Carradine, Carleton Young and Denver Pyle. The only jarring notes come from the usually reliable Strother Martin, who giggles with insane (and patently forced) glee every time Liberty Valance turns his violence on another innocent. Since Valance himself is a psychopath, why did either he or the movie require another sadistic wacko as a useless hanger-on? Cyril Mockridge’s score is effective, although it’s undercut by Ford’s use of Alfred Newman’s plangent theme for Ann Rutlege from Young Mr. Lincoln. Although I normally deplore interpolations of music from one picture to another, that theme is so moving it transcends its source and proves quietly, devastatingly right here. Its very rightness, and beauty, however, obliterate the more prosaic themes Mockridge came up with.\n\nRide the Pink Horse (1947) As with the half-baked In a Lonely Place of 1951, this is yet another cinematic adaptation of a superb Dorothy B. Hughes novel that flattens the source. Although it’s more faithful generally than the Nicholas Ray picture, it suffers from either Production Code interference or the timidity of the people involved (who include, as scenarists, the redoubtable Ben Hecht and Charles Lederer) in pushing the story to what should have been its grim conclusion. The studio-bound look of it doesn’t help much either; what should be by turns oppressive and banal becomes merely a prettified simulacrum of Hughes’ nightmare fiesta world. Even the motivations of the would-be blackmailer played by the director, Robert Montgomery, have been sweetened: Instead of intending to bleed a Senator who’s killed his wife — a woman, moreover, with whom the blackmailer was involved — Montgomery’s character is avenging a dead friend. To make us like him? Similarly, the children’s carousel run by the expansive Mexican who befriends the blackmailer has been altered; instead of being run entirely on the man’s physical labor, it’s mechanized. There’s a metaphor in that.\n\nThe maddening thing about all this is that Hughes’ specialized gift for depicting rot in the everyday should have been a perfect match for the makers of what would later be called film noir. Yet they kept softening her stories, or twisting them out of recognizable shape. Ride the Pink Horse is one of those pictures, like L.A. Confidential, that only those who have never read their source novels can love. What’s best about the movie is its supporting cast: Fred Clark as the mercurial, half-deaf Senator; Art Smith as a tough, weary and wonderfully expressive FBI agent; Wanda Hendrix as the solemn young Mexican girl who attaches herself to Montgomery; and Thomas Gomez as the loyal, utterly unimpeachable carousel operator. Gomez’s performance dances on the knife-edge of ethnic parody (it’s the same in the book.) Yet the character is so richly portrayed, and so ingratiating, that even as you may be thinking it’s too much you’re overwhelmed with affection for the man, and for the actor playing him.\n\nHoliday (1938) The wonderful adaptation of Philip Barry’s comedy, beautifully directed by George Cukor and acted with feeling and aplomb by Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant and Lew Ayres.\n\nClick on the link above for a fuller review.\n\nThe Quiet Man (1952) John Ford’s rhapsodic comedy; his most mature depiction of romantic love, and his sexiest work.\n\nClick on the link above for a fuller review.\n\nShe Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) The second of John Ford’s post-war “Cavalry Trilogy,” and in many ways the best although it’s marred by some heavy-handed comedy relief.\n\nClick on the link above for a fuller review.\n\nFebruary 2022\n\nAn American in Paris (1951) While flawed, this movie musical not only continues to look good; it looks better with every passing year.\n\nClick on the link above for a fuller review.\n\nHarold & Maude (1971) On the commentary for the Paramount Blu-ray of Colin Higgins’… is “offbeat” the word I am seeking?… comic romance the writer-director Cameron Crowe, who was in early adolescence when the picture was released, says he felt on seeing it that the movie was like a society he had not been asked to join. Even on multiple viewings, it’s still possible to feel that way about Harold & Maude, even as you’re enjoying the performances in it and the contours of Hal Ashby’s nearly perfect direction and editing of it. The picture can be a test of your tolerance for Ruth Gordon, who, like Maude herself, frequently teeters on the precipice of the deeply precious and some of the humor is strained — Harold’s one-armed military uncle comes to mind as an example of that — but much of the movie is winning, especially Cat Stevens’ songs and Harold’s hilarious fake suicides.\n\nAlthough neither Harold nor Maude is fully explicable, Bud Cort as Harold acts as if they were. (He’s said to have announced to Ashby during his audition that he was Harold.) Cort was hard to place an actor; typecast as social misfits he seemed ephemeral, and at times looked like an owl that had been starved and stretched on a rack. There are however moments in Harold & Maude when he seems ethereally beautiful and suggests, as the movie itself does, that there may be more here than meets the eye. (Then again, there may not.) Higgins initially wrote the screenplay as his master’s thesis; it’s probably the most famous post-graduate work in modern American movies, and has a grad student’s stretching for profundity that never quite makes it. Ashby’s direction is droll, and somewhat distanced, but you feel his heart was with the picture’s leads. This was one of the key cult movies of my youth, and it has a timelessness that is quite remarkable, especially in John Alonzo’s marvelous photography.\n\nVivian Pickles gives a superbly tailored comic performance as Harold’s unflappable mother; G. Wood and Eric Christmas provide perfect gems as, respectively, his psychiatrist (note the way when they are together Harold is always dressed identically to his doctor) and his priest; Ellen Geer, Judy Engles and Shari Summers are splendid as the computer dates Mother arranges for Harold; and Tom Skerritt (appearing as “M. Borman”) gives a very funny account of a frustrated martinet of a CHiPS officer.\n\nAmerican: The Bill Hicks Story (2009) The unquestioning adulation, since his obscenely early death, of Bill Hicks has often seemed to me emblematic of how American stand-up comedy has faltered and fizzled out since the 1970s. It isn’t just that almost no one is funny any longer, it’s that the few who are amusing are lionized to such a degree that they become gods, their status untouchable and inviolate. Hicks could occasionally be inspired, and his comic approach was clearly developing as he aged. But nothing either in his recorded work or in this hagiographic documentary persuades me that with his death America lost a comic genius on the order of a Richard Pryor or a George Carlin. (Or even a Bill Cosby who, whatever you think of him as a man, was often screamingly funny as a comedian.) Worse, the movie is put together in the most annoyingly trendy manner possible, with too much money and attention going to cute graphics and pointless animation and not enough to its thesis. We hear, repeatedly, that Bill Hicks was the comedians’ comedian, the ne plus ultra of the stand-up set, yet almost nothing he says or does in the source footage supports the contention. When someone tells me I have to take the genius of another on faith, that is when I politely ask the way to the exit.\n\nA Night at the Opera (1935) Groucho Marx always maintained that this was the best of the Marx Bros. movies. It would be nice to agree with him, but I have long thought his preference was based more on box office returns than creative merit. The Paramount movies are almost infinitely funnier, especially Animal Crackers and Horsefeathers, and in neither of those do we have to put up with the insipid (and un-ignorable, since they sing) lovers Irving Thalberg imposed on Groucho, Harpo and Chico in their MGM pictures and that others at the studio persisted on foisting on them after his death. A Night at the Opera has more laughs in it than Duck Soup, though, and the funny stuff in it is extremely funny: Groucho’s wooing of Margaret Dumont (and his aside to us, “If she figures that out, she’s good!”); the stateroom scene; Groucho and Chico debating the sanity clause; the detective’s search of the hotel suite; Groucho saying, “Boojie boojie boojie”; Harpo’s gookie; and the literal wreck of Il trovatore. I could do without the tenor villain whipping Harpo every chance he gets, but at least Allan Jones and Kitty Carlisle don’t sing as often as they threaten to, and when they do, sing well.\n\nThalberg was right from a money standpoint (although Opera cost so much to produce its take wasn’t what it might have been) but wrong from a comedic. No Marx Bros. fan wants to watch their heroes play Cupid to young lovers, even if they can sing Verdi.\n\nThe Moon-Spinners (1964) A pleasant mis-adaptation in the Disney mode of the engaging Mary Stewart novel of intrigue on Crete. Too much of the plot was simplified or changed to make it as good as it might have been, but while her character has no antecedent in the book, the silent star Pola Negri was persuaded to come out of retirement for it by Walt Disney, and she’s fascinating to watch. If the novel has a flaw it’s that it’s told in first-person, so however threatening the clouds we are never really in doubt as to who will be standing after the storm. But since this feminine lead is played by the always-interesting Haley Mills, Joan Greenwood is along as her aunt, Eli Wallach is on board as the chief villain, Peter McEnery makes a dashing young hero and the supporting cast includes John Le Mesurier as a shady diplomat and Sheila Hancock as his dipsomaniac wife, the remarkable Irene Papas and the engaging young Michael Davis, it all goes down as smoothly as Greek yoghurt, if without the nutritional value.\n\nOliver! (1968) The composer/lyricist/librettist Lionel Bart’s wildly successful West End and Broadway musical adaptation of Dickens’ Oliver Twist was, in the period when American studios were grasping with increasing desperation for a Sound of Music-style hit, probably a natural even if its origins were British. Yet whereas this overblown, over-produced musical or that (Camelot, Doctor Dolittle, Paint Your Wagon, Star!) continued to bomb, Oliver! was a substantial hit: Over $77 million profit on a $10 million layout. (Not that it matters, but Oliver! also won the Best Picture Academy Award that year, which no American musical would until the mangled yet inexplicably popular adaptation of Chicago in 2002.) Perhaps it helped that the movie was directed by a great filmmaker (Carol Reed) with three consecutive masterpieces to his credit,* shot by a genius cinematographer (Oswald Morris), designed and costumed by masters (Jon Box, Terence Marsh, Phyllis Dalton), beautifully cast (Ron Moody as Fagin, Oliver Reed as Sikes, Harry Secombe as the Beadle, Shani Wallis as Nancy, Leonard Rossiter as Sowerberry, Jack Wild as the Artful Dodger, Mark Lester as Oliver), wonderfully scored (Johnny Green) and, with one glaring exception, delightfully choreographed (by Onna White.) That exception is the genuinely stupid “Consider Yourself” production number. Since this is a movie, not a stage show, there is absolutely no reason for anyone other than Oliver and the Dodger to be singing, much less dancing, yet the number goes on and on, taking in everything from surly butchers to boy chimneysweeps with the seats of their pants comically on fire. The situation of children forced to labor cleaning out those dangerous chimneys was hardly something to joke about, but the sheer scale of the damn thing is dumbfounding. (It took three weeks to film.) It could have been elided over without lowering the entertainment value of Oliver! in the slightest; in fact, excising “Consider Yourself” would have improved the entire picture immensely.\n\nI’m not wildly enthusiastic about Bart’s songs for the show generally, although I do admire little Oliver’s song of yearning “Where is Love?” Bart had a tendency toward things like (in Fagin’s “Reviewing the Situation”) anachronistic references to Dale Carnegie, and the show’s big ballad, “As Long as He Needs Me” sits uncomfortably within the tradition of American “He beats me but I love him” numbers. The songs are a bit sunny, considering the time and the setting, but because the movie was made with such obvious love and integrity, the numbers matter less than the songs in more accomplished shows like Fiddler on the Roof do, and whether they land or not becomes less important than the quality of the performances. Oliver! sinks or swims, not on Fagin, which has since 1960 been considered the star part, but on Oliver Twist, and the movie’s Oliver is its anchor. Young Mark Lester, one of the most attractive children to star in a movie since Jackie Coogan in The Kid, has a sweet smile, limpid, expressive eyes and nothing he says or does is studied, or disingenuous. When he slaps Bill Sikes in frustrated rage it’s as if every insupportable event Oliver been forced to shoulder bursts forth in a single gesture, and it’s as shocking to him as it is to everyone else. I don’t know if that’s writing (it’s been too long since I read the Dickens novel), direction, innate inspiration or a combination of all three, but it’s certainly impressive. In addition, Lester’s singing voice is the furthest thing from that of a trained stage performer pouring out his heart in song to the cheap seats; it’s soft and delicate, seemingly wrapped in fleece — exactly the sort of voice that battered yet hopeful boy should have.\n\nText copyright 2022 by Scott Ross\n\n*Odd Man Out (1947), The Fallen Idol (1948) and The Third Man (1949). And if there is nothing in Oliver! to match, for sheer terror, the murder of Nancy in the David Lean Oliver Twist (1948) Reed’s picture at least undoes the anti-Semitism of which, typically, everyone involved in the Lean movie expressed surprise that others were offended by. To have rendered Alec Guinness’ Fagin with the single largest “Jew” nose in British cinema history after the revelations of the Holocaust sure spoke to something.\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nNote: This went out initially as “January 2020.” Thanks to Eliot M. Camarena for catching the new-year typo; it always takes me a month or two after the 1st to recalibrate.\n\nAnastasia (1956) Arthur Laurents, who adapted the Marcelle Maurette play — itself translated for the English-speaking stage by the playwright and lyricist Guy Bolton — considered Anastasia a fairy-tale, and although it’s ostensibly based in fact there’s little sense in the picture that anyone involved in making it thought they were recreating history. (Even the main setting is off; the actual events took place largely in Berlin, but the director, Anatole Litvak, wanted to shoot in Paris, and did.) In the late 1920s a young woman was presented by exiled White Russians as the Grand Duchess Anastasia, who had somehow miraculously survived the massacre of the Czar’s family in 1918. DNA tests since the woman’s death have proven she wasn’t who she claimed to be, and she was likely mad, but it’s an irresistible set-up for a romantic pastiche, and the movie, taken as a fable, is grand entertainment anchored to three superb central performances, by Ingrid Bergman, Yul Brynner and Helen Hayes. (Four, if you count Martita Hunt’s marvelous turn as the Dowager Empress’ lady-in-waiting.) Although much of the picture takes place on Andrew Low’s excellent sets (look especially for the elevated trains running outside Bergman’s windows) it’s beautifully lit and shot by Jack Hildyard, who also photographed Summertime and The Bridge on the River Kwai for David Lean. The sumptuous score with its infectious, Russian-inspired main theme, was by Alfred Newman. For a more historically accurate but far less entertaining look at the Czar’s family, see the 1971 Nicholas and Alexandra.\n\nDark Passage (1947) An effective thriller somewhat undone by the plot’s emphasis on coincidence and melodrama but a must for admirers of Bogart, of which fraternity your correspondent has long been an enthusiastic member. Lauren Bacall is rather better here than she would be a year later in the John Huston and Richard Brooks adaptation of Key Largo, perhaps because her character is less wholesome. Written and directed by Delmer Daves from a novel (and first-draft screenplay) by David Goodis, the picture concerns a convict (Bogart), previously found guilty of a murder he did not commit, who escapes prison, falls under the wing of a sympathetic woman artist (Bacall), changes his face and attempts to clear himself in San Francisco. What the movie has, aside from Bogart, are: A good Franz Waxman score; excellent cinematography by Sidney Hickox; effective editing by David Weisbart; and imaginative direction from Daves, who, because of the plastic surgery the Bogart character will later receive, shoots much of the first third from the actor’s point of view, often with a then-novel hand-held camera. Amidst the good supporting cast the always splendid Agnes Moorehead gives good account of a woman for whom the happiness of others is a misery and who is herself only content when she’s making everyone else unhappy, Tom D’Andrea contributes a lovely performance as a sympathetic cabbie, and Clifton Young is very fine as a pathetic opportunist with a grudge. Bogart has the unenviable job of making a marked impression when, first, we don’t see his face and, later, we can’t. Of course, only Bogart sounded like Bogart. Nevertheless, he comes through like a champion.\n\nHis Girl Friday (1940) Despite the terrible title — in the argot of the period, a girl Friday was an office assistant, certainly not an ace reporter as Rosalind Russell’s feminized Hildy Johnson is here — this is the best, and funniest, of the three major movie versions of the venerable Hecht and McArthur play The Front Page. The fast Howard Hawks pace is a factor, certainly, as is the casting of Russell, and Cary Grant as Walter Burns; their breakneck, often overlapping banter (some from the play but much of it added by Hawks, Charles Lederer and the uncredited Hecht, Morrie Ryskind and Chet La Roche to reflect the characters’ status as newly divorced husband and wife) is, to employ an overused term, dazzling and their comic aplomb at lobbing it close to sublime. It’s hard to believe, watching her in this, that until her work as the rich bitch Sylvia in The Women in 1939, Russell was known primarily for drama. That performance, like Grant’s in The Awful Truth, seems to have liberated her, and I suspect she realized that she could go where she may have thought was too far and that a good director could modify her characterization downward, or let it fly as necessary without doing damage either to the piece or to her acting in it. Her Hildy Johnson is scaled exactly right, sometimes midway between calculation and rasping hysteria and always with the right mix of brains, femininity, reporting instincts and an ambition nearly as ruthless as Walter Burns’ own.\n\nThe only thing that defeats her are those awful clothes.\n\nDances With Wolves (1990) Extended Version A movie I’ve long admired, and always enjoy seeing, but which despite the many great things in it somehow skirts greatness. Possibly because the picture also needed a great actor at its core and didn’t get one?\n\nTime After Time (1979) Nicholas Meyer’s debut as writer-director, adapted from Karl Alexander’s clever novel, itself inspired by Meyer’s ingenious Sherlock Holmes pastiche The Seven-Per-Cent Solution. Alexander’s conceit (and that of Steve Hayes, with whom he created the original story, as a screenplay) concerns Jack the Ripper stealing a time machine constructed by H.G. Wells, prompting Wells to follow his quarry into 20th century San Francisco. The picture was slightly hampered by its low budget, particularly in the time-travel sequence, although the second half of that looks quite good. Paul Lohmann’s beautiful, deep-focus widescreen cinematography is a decided asset, as is the wonderful score by Miklós Rózsa. Malcolm McDowell, who’d become associated before this with a number of unpleasant characters and pictures (Caligula, Stanley Kubrick’s repulsive A Clockwork Orange), makes a charming Wells, David Warner an effective (and, at the end, oddly pitiable) Jack and the adorable Mary Steenburgen a perfect mate for McDowell, although Meyer saddles her character with some unfortunate crudity in the dialogue. It’s not as delicious as the Holmes picture, or as satisfying, but for a maiden effort it’s an enjoyable, intelligent entertainment. Remember those?\n\nSong of the South (1946) The self-censorship by the Walt Disney Company of this often charming movie (and anything that springs from it) is far more dispiriting than the picture’s rather idealized depiction of black sharecropping life in the postbellum South.\n\nThe Horn Blows at Midnight (1945) A mildly amusing comedy-fantasy that, while no classic, is also nowhere near the turkey its star, Jack Benny, used to pretend. Benny, as an angel perennially frustrated in his attempts to blow his horn and end the earth, is occasionally hilarious; the director Raoul Walsh keeps the action moving at a dizzy clip; the light-hearted score by Franz Waxman is so good the composer later adapted it into a comic overture called “Athanael the Trumpeter”; the photography by Sidney Hickox (who also shot Dark Passage) is splendid; and there are two funny sequences of characters clinging for dear life from the side of a skyscraper that are also rather terrifying, especially if, like me, you suffer from acrophobia. Alexis Smith a quarter century before Follies illustrates why she was a pin-up dish in the Forties and the good supporting cast (almost everyone has two roles) includes Dolores Moran, Allyn Joslyn, Reginald Gardiner, John Alexander, Guy Kibbee, Margaret Dumont, Mike Mazurki, the young Robert Blake (as a bratty schoolboy) and, as a hotel detective, the peerless Franklin Pangborn, whose repeated slow-burn “take,” with one eyebrow raised and one eye narrowed to a slit, never fails to slay me.\n\nStreet Scene (1931) A good, if stagy, early talkie of the 1929 Pulitzer winner for drama by Elmer Rice, with effective cinematography by George Barnes and Gregg Toland and fine acting by a cast that includes a number of the actors who played it on Broadway: Matt McHugh, Eleanor Wesselhoeft, T.H. Manning, Ann Kostant, George Humbert, Conway Washburne, John Qualen and the inimitable Beulah Bondi as the neighborhood’s all-purpose Gentile yenta. Sylvia Sidney is the nominal star, William Collier, Jr. plays the Jewish boy who loves her, and the cast is largely excellent apart from Estelle Taylor and David Landau as Sidney’s parents. Landau growls all of his (admittedly one-noted) lines like a stevedore who’s just discovered a lefty on his work-crew, and Taylor never stops posing. (See photo above for a representative sampling.) The multi-ethnic “slice-of-life” quality of Rice’s play has dated badly, but there is still genuine emotion within it, well-mined by King Vidor, who is, alas, only allowed a wider, more cinematic, canvas in the last quarter. Alfred Newman’s Gershwinesque main theme is still impressive. (Kurt Weill and Langston Hughes later musicalized the Rice play for their opera-like musical drama of, as they used to say, the same name, out of which came the exquisite, haunting ballad “Lonely House.”)\n\nInterestingly, while Conway Washburne plays the building’s young expectant father, something about him reads, in a largely indefinable fashion (or in any case to me) as gay. I was reminded by Washburne of another young actor in an early ’30s talkie, Harold Waldridge from Five-Star Final. And, as with Waldridge, I can find almost nothing about him save that he had very few Broadway credits and died single, and rather young.\n\nDog Day Afternoon (1975) Arguably Al Pacino’s finest performance, at least in his youth, in one of the director Sidney Lumet’s most representative “New York movies.” Virtually no one today would know how to do it, or would care to.\n\nThat’s always assuming there is a New York left to film in, a proposition increasingly less secure thanks to the city’s mayor and the state’s governor, both of whom seem determined to destroy one of the world’s hitherto great capitals, more and more a dystopic ghost-town from which everyone with the means to do so is now fleeing.\n\nMonkey Business (1931) The Marx Bros.’ third feature, and their first original (i.e., not based on one of their stage triumphs) is a wild, anarchic collection of largely unrelated gags and sequences set first on an ocean liner in which the boys have stowed away, later at the swanky home of an American gangster. It was written largely by S.J. Perlman and Will B. Johnstone with, as they used to say, additional dialogue by Arthur Sheekman, who became one of Groucho’s favorites. Among the highlights: Harpo’s routine with the Punch and Judy show; the four brothers trying to get through Customs, each pretending he is Maurice Chevalier; and Groucho vamping Thelma Todd. Todd, who is also in Horse Feathers (1932), was the closest thing the Marx pictures ever got to a real match for Groucho. She’s nearly as daffy as he is, and completely game. Whether she’d ever follow through is academic; I suspect Groucho would run from any woman who actually gave in without a fight.\n\nThe movie doesn’t make the slightest bit of sense, and we wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nThe Godfather (1972), The Godfather, Part II (1974), The Godfather, Part III (1990) and The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone (1990/2020)\n\nThe recent Godfather Coda clarifies some things that were muddy before, such as Donal Donnelly’s previously unexplained remark in the earlier opening sequence about the Church having an agreement with the Corleones, and is a bit tighter generally, but loses an occasional nice moment — such as Eli Wallach’s Don Altobello pouring Sicilian olive oil on his bread — that, while not essential, is like an unexpected grace-note. The ending, which Coppola claims is also clearer, is every bit as opaque now as it was in 1990. Is this a leap forward from 1980 to 1990, or is it instead a dying Michael’s dream of how he’d like his life to end, the way his father’s did? I’ve never known, and I still don’t.\n\nI also don’t know what, if anything, is left to say about the first two masterworks that hasn’t been said, better than I could, and by the possessors of finer minds than mine. The 2008 “Coppola Restoration” makes Gordon Willis’ rich cinematography (not even nominated for an Oscar™ that year) in the first look more lustrous than it has in decades, although in the second the faces are sometimes, inexplicably, orange. I will, however, venture one, negative, observation: In every Godfather picture, Coppola and Mario Puzo saddled Diane Keaton with the only bad lines. I don’t think either was really interested in writing about women.\n\nThe Carey Treatment (1972) I can’t quite imagine why, after the MGM chief James Aubrey “cut the heart out” of Blake Edwards‘ beautiful 1970 Western Wild Rovers, Edwards believed that Aubrey would leave him alone on this interesting medical mystery thriller. The filmmaker later claimed, not without reason, that Aubrey deliberately set him up to destroy him, and Edwards tried without success to take his name off the completed movie. (The screenwriters, John D.F. Black, Harriet Frank Jr. and Irving Ravetch, were luckier; the movie is credited to one “James P. Bonne,” a pseudonym.) Based on A Case of Need, a good but somewhat meandering early Michael Crichton thriller published under the nom de plume Jeffery Hudson, the movie retains the basic narrative arc — pathologist investigates the botched abortion murder of an underage girl — but alters much of the surrounding detail and even some of the plot, making the central character much more of a maverick than he is in the novel, as well as a Chandleresque smart-ass even when it’s foolish, and dangerous, to mouth off. And while Edwards received no screenplay credit, the writer-director’s touch is everywhere: In the widescreen images, the use of deception, the general look of the picture, its interest in the process of investigation, and in much of the dialogue; the Ravetches were fine scenarists, but an abundance of sparkling wit was not among their hallmarks as screen writers.\n\nAlthough Edwards maintained that the studio head butchered his movie, it’s difficult to tell exactly where Aubrey interfered; the man John Houseman famously dubbed “The Smiling Cobra” pulled the plug with ten days’ filming left to go, so obviously it’s an incomplete picture, but just what is missing I can’t say. I do suspect that the moment in which Michael Blodgett’s homicidal masseur attempts to murder Coburn by driving his car through a telephone booth is less effective than it might be due to the foreshortened schedule (we never see the car hit the booth) but another complicated sequence, in which Coburn’s Carey terrifies the murder victim’s boarding school roommate (Jennifer Edwards, the director’s daughter, and excellent) by driving erratically along the coast near Boston, does not suffer fro"
