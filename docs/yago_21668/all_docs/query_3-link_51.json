        "text": "Wild Orange has a deep, rich, tangy, sweet-tart aroma unlike any other orange that we know of and may be used as you would Sweet Orange - it’s certain to have interesting uses in natural perfumery and in other instances where Orange oil is called for. In fact, Wild Orange is one of our best-selling citrus oils, most likely due to this oil’s irresistibly unique, tangy aroma!\n\nConsidering that most citrus peel essential oils contain very high percentages of limonene (up to 95%), one would expect them to have aromas that are more alike than they are. The fact that Orange, Lemon, Lime and Grapefruit essential oils smell differently due to constituents amounting to less than five percent of the overall oil is fairly comprehensible. The fact that Orange oils of the same species can differ aromatically based on percentages of less than one percent is pretty remarkable.\n\nWild-grown and organic citrus peel oils are preferred for use in aromatherapy preparations since the residues of farming chemicals accumulate in the outer peels and can be detected in the cold-pressed oils by GC-MS analysis. Wild botanicals in general, free of human intervention, have a vivacity and determination that is reflected in their essential oils – spirited, irresistible and alive. Wild Orange in the diffuser will bring a cheerful tone and an uplifting, 'wildly' familiar fragrance to the nursery, office, spa or studio."
