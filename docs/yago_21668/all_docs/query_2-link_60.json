        "text": "APPLES, ORANGES, LEMONS & LIMES, 45min,. USA, Relationship\n\nDirected by Pat Mitchell\n\nA timid young man chronically suffers from social anxiety. At a party, an unlikely encounter inspires a night of drinking, joy and romance.\n\nhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt15035104/\n\nGet to know the filmmaker:\n\nI remember thinking about two people walking down a street drunk and wanted to put a hypothetical story behind it.\n\nWe also tend to have a stigma against young adults drinking. I think lots of movies portray younger generation drinkers as irresponsible and reckless. I thought it would be nice to show it as a celebration once again and put some delight into that rather than the darker takes on the topic. I was a young drinker and didn't have much recklessness going around. I wanted to bring those feelings I had on screen.\n\nI also like psychological thrillers and the state of mind characters play. I thought of a character with social anxiety. I have it and many people in the world. its a very relatable subject. I managed to write a straightforward story around that. I made things more complicated before but I didn't want to lose the crowd with my own ambitions in this film. I kept it very light but thoughtful.\n\nIt didn't become a romance film until I challenged myself to write one. I usually write about a past love, a lost love or tortured love. It was my first time writing about the beginning of a relationship. I loved it more than I thought I would. I am so glad for the amazing response. I was afraid if i wasn't a zany young adult mania-filled party film people may be thrown off.\n\nYou can sign up for the 7 day free trial at www.wildsound.ca (available on your streaming services and APPS).
