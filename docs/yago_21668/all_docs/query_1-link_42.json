Thus the\n\nactors job is to make the suit fit, either by shrinking or my\n\nenlarging his role.\n\nHence, a character is a signifier in narrative cinema and the \"size\"\n\nof the actor determines the strenght of it, i.e. \"filling of the\n\nsuit\". This makes sense, as a strong performance can lift and enhance\n\nthe narrative, or as Bill said, \"Sometimes great cinema is born of a\n\nmore complicated relationship between the actor and the image.\"\n\nBut this also suggests that the \"suit\" and / or actor can disrupt the\n\nnarrative. I noted upon this in my critic of \"Collateral\", where I\n\nsuggested, that the name of Cruises' character, Vincent, gave allusion\n\nto \"The Colour of Money\" and the positure gave allusion to \"Mission\n\nImpossible\"; Hence the \"suit\" was tailored badly and the actor was too\n\nlarge for the suit. Another allusion by actor is in \"Enemy of the\n\nState\", where Gene Hackman gives allusion to \"The Conversation\". But\n\nis this bad acting or bad designed \"suit\"?\n\nIts not only allusion, which is an element of acting, also homage and\n\nvarious forms of intertextuality are, according to Genette. But inter-\n\nand transtextuality relies upon the viewer, as those unfamiliar with\n\nthe subtext wont recognize it.\n\nThis suggests, that an uneducation (in lack of a better word, in terms\n\nof information on which to reference by) viewer wont note inter- and\n\ntranstextuality.\n\nBill notes upon another element of acting, when he says, that, \"For\n\nmost film spectators, the actor is (or used to be) what they paid to\n\nsee.\" If an audience by assumed naivity overlooks the \"suit\" and only\n\nobserves the actor, or if the narrative (i.e. the \"suit\") is so\n\nundefined and weak, that you only see the actor, the narrative becomes\n\nsecondary to the actor. This is the potential danger, and fallacy, of\n\nthe \"Star\" system and \"Star\" film. The narrative have to match the\n\nstars strenght, if not, the narrative becomes secondary.\n\nBut if the narrative is secondary, then the \"suit\" also must be, and\n\nthe question is then, to what purpose is acting, when the actor just\n\nhas to be himself?\n\nHenrik\n\n14102\n\nFrom: Paul Gallagher\n\nDate: Mon Aug 16, 2004 7:35am\n\nSubject: Re: The Militant on \"Fahrenheit 9/11\"\n\n--- In a_film_by@yahoogroups.com, \"Paul Gallagher\"\n\nwrote:\n\n> There are several articles for and against \"Fahrenheit 9/11\"'s\n\n> line at counterpunch.org.\n\n> http://www.counterpunch.org/valentine07022004.html\n\n> http://www.counterpunch.org/jensen07052004.html\n\n> http://www.counterpunch.org/valentine06302004.html\n\n> http://www.counterpunch.org/bardacke07292004.html\n\nI neglected a few more reviews:\n\nhttp://www.counterpunch.org/landau07172004.html\n\nPaul\n\n14103\n\nFrom: Gabe Klinger\n\nDate: Mon Aug 16, 2004 8:32am\n\nSubject: Re: She Hate Me\n\nSo help me I loved SHE HATE ME.\n\nIn addition to what hotlove666 has already said (obervations likely not to mean much\n\nto those who haven't seen the film) --\n\nThe flashback scene when Mackie encounters his soon-to-be bride in bed with her\n\nDominican lover, both nearly reaching orgasm, and then violently broken apart,\n\nreminded me of the scene in John Singleton's BABY BOY when Tyrese's girlfriend has\n\nfantasies during orgasm -- brief flashes that, as Jonathan noted in his capsule of the\n\nfilm, show unexpected flair and inventiveness. What Singleton and Spike Lee have in\n\ncommon is that they dare to stage emotionally complex moments while characters\n\nare having intercourse. Most filmmakers would rather not deal with the mess.\n\nWhile it's true that the film touches on the issue of diabetes, I think it would be\n\ninaccurate to say it touches on the issue of diabetes in impoverished black\n\ncommunities: Mackie's parents live in an elegant brownstone and are apparently well\n\noff.\n\nWhat I dslike about Lee is that he seems out of touch with reality; in most of his films\n\nwe only see sleek apartments with designer stuff, and impeccably dressed and trendy\n\npeople, with interesting faces. Also -- as I'm sure has been noted in dozens of\n\nreviews (making it a totally conventional criticism, but whatever) -- Lee's characters\n\nare all annoyingly preachy and talk alike.\n\nBut ... the flaws are beside the point. This is intensely personal stuff, and if you can\n\nget through it, it leaves you with a full plate.\n\nGabe\n\n14104\n\nFrom: jpcoursodon\n\nDate: Mon Aug 16, 2004 1:58pm\n\nSubject: Re: So no one else believes in \"good bad acting\"?\n\n--- In a_film_by@yahoogroups.com, Jack Angstreich"
