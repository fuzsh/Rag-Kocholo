The Queen of Spades (UK/Dickinson)\n\nFor those unaware of my Top Ten By Year project:\n\nThe majority of my viewing habits have been dictated by this project since September of 2013. Jumping to a different decade each time, I choose comparatively weaker years for me re: quantity of films seen/quantity of films loved. I use list-making as a way to see more films and revisit others in a structured and project-drive way. I was sick of spending too much time trying to decide what to watch, or watching films just to cross them off another dumb canon list. I wanted to engage. I wanted films to be enhanced by others, by looking at a specific moment in time. I wanted something that led me to seeing or revisiting things I might not have gotten to otherwise. Lastly, my lists are based on personal favorites, not any weird notion of an objective best.\n\nThis is the first year I’ll be doing separate posts for each film. #9 will go up Monday. After that, one will go up each day until the end. Then I’ll post them all together so they are gathered in one place. There are a lot of films I loved that did not make the cut. In particular, Flamingo Road, Such a Pretty Little Beach, On the Town, Inspirace, The Reckless Moment, Reign of Terror, The Rocking Horse Winner, and Samson and Delilah are all films I thought at one point would be on here. Of all of these, Flamingo Road was a sure thing until it wasn’t at the very last minute. Please go watch it.\n\n#9. Rendezvous in July (Becker) & Au royaume des cieux (Duvivier) (France) (first time watches)\n\nDiametrically opposed visions of postwar French youth: the dreamers and the delinquents. Two unknown films by two well-known directors (Jacques Becker and Julien Duvivier). I couldn’t choose between the two; they belong together.\n\n————————————————————————————————\n\nRendezvous in July (Becker) is about twenty-year old kids who can see the Eiffel Tower from their windows. It is a light spring breeze that is on-the-move, because there are places to be and dreams to achieve. We’re first introduced to a family we’ll never see again. This is a pattern that continues through the first fifteen minutes. Our main characters are all introduced alongside their parents, illustrating how markedly different these proto teeny-boppers are from their elders. Collectively, these adults cover all the bases of your standard generational gap; they have practical jobs and adhere to custom, and they mostly disapprove of the instability of artistic endeavor. But these kids are idealistic, and pretty, and talented. They are aspiring actors, playwrights, cinematographers, documentarians, and musicians. They are riding the high of the postwar Americanization boom; they wear pants, love jazz, and smoke American cigarettes (a character offers one to his dad who disdainfully replies with “Keep em”).\n\nWhat makes Rendezvous in July special is its intense possession of the perky energy we’d soon associate with the phenomenon of 50s teeny-bopperdom. I can’t think of an earlier film that depicts youth with the kind of modern immediacy that would become commonplace in the upcoming decades. It must have felt so new watching these characters congregate and flit from place to place, cavorting as a group entity with all the, as the Grinch would say, noise, noise, noise, noise! These kids dance fast to fast music, but Becker speeds up the frame rate all the same.\n\nThe centerpiece of the group’s carefree whimsy is the Boat-Car Shark, (because a river can’t stop these kids from getting where they need to). It is one of your rubber bath toys made life-size and fully operational, with Keith Haring-esque hieroglyphs (eyes and octopi that recur on other costumes and decor) and headlights for eyes. It floats across the Seine while passersby look on, noting that “they sure have it easy”. They drive up and out onto the cobblestone, dropping everyone off at their various classes and odd-jobs, a communal vehicle that can provide them with the shortcuts needed to keep up with their pace.\n\nThey are at an age where anything and everything is possible as long as you’ve got talent and idealism. For all the bounce in this film’s step, there is just enough space made for us to observe that the bubble is burstable. There is no place in the film for people potentially going nowhere, and no tolerance for any irreparable steps taken towards the workaday life.\n\nLucien (Daniel Gélin) finally gets the funding he needs for an anthropological study. He excitedly tells his film crew they are due to leave within two weeks. But the crew can no long go; they made various job commitments in order to earn steady wages. It is a deep betrayal; he becomes petulant and has what can only be described as a tantrum. He calls them, among many other things, pathetic slobs. Lucien’s disparaging plea that his friends don’t sell out so young is sympathetic — to a point. That choice is so often the point of no return, where you cross over and become just like everybody else. But the more you get to know Lucien, the more incapable he seems of registering anybody else’s feelings. I can’t tell if Becker intends (or even sees) for the character, or if it’s just apparent to me. However, Lucien’s speech to his friends goes on long enough that it settles into something purposefully ugly. But while Lucien and others take steps towards success and opportunity, a girl named Christine suffers a series of humiliations.\n\nAs much as I love Rendezvous in July, it probably wouldn’t be here without Christine. Jacques Becker sees her but her peers do not. He and Nicole Courcel (her debut film) let us see. This is a clique where identity and emotion are defined by your talent and passion. The plight of realizing you don’t have talent, and its unfortunate companion deep insecurity, is an unforgiving thing, especially with friends that don’t recognize or relate to said plight. She is seen by the group as a bit of a vindictive femme. To a degree she is, but it all stems from the fact that she sees beauty as her one sure thing.\n\nAt first we see her as her friends do:\n\nIn an early scene, she calls Therese (Brigitte Auber, also her debut) to tell her she has a part in Rousseau’s (Henri Belly) new play (her brother is the playwright, getting her in the door). Therese is disappointed about this, and it’s the exact reaction Christine was hoping for. A smirk spreads across her face when she hangs up.\n\nWhen the time comes, Christine is too nervous to audition for Rousseau; she puts his hand to her chest so he can feel her heartbeat. Sexuality is the only hand she feels she’s got to play in that moment.\n\nShe is bad in the play and she knows it. She didn’t need further proof, but during the curtain call the audience gives it to her anyways; a limp round of applause meets her when she steps forward, the opposite of Therese’s lively reception. Audience members share an exchange: “She’s pretty, eh? “Pretty, but very bad”. In the dressing room, she is chastised by Rousseau (who she lost her virginity too) for being sad: “Your dress is great. You look lovely. What more do you want?”.\n\nEvery single scene shows how thoroughly unseen this girl is. She is viewed as inferior to Lucien (her romantic interest), told she has no heart; she is even slapped. The list goes on. Some of the men also make selfish decisions (out of pure selfishness as opposed to coming from a place of pain like Christine), and then blame her for their choices. Rousseau chose to cast a girl who doesn’t cut it, only to scream at her for — guess what — not cutting it. Lucien is impulsive and proposes to Christine after making her feel like scum. When Christine is led astray after feeling worthless, just like before, it is she that receives all the disgust.\n\nThat this girl feels everything is never considered. Indeed, nobody ever shows actual concern for her, or sees her very apparent sadness. A girl who acts out because she feels less than is constantly misunderstood as dumb, not worthy of Lucien, a bad actress, and heartless. Nicole Courcel pours a deep melancholy and ache into this girl looking to be valued, using the only tool she thinks she’s got (the how and who of that be damned). She is the only one with nothing at the end. I think about Christine all the time. Everybody else, with their bubbly spirits and camaraderie, will be fine by virtue of the fact that they are in this film. Except Christine. Christine has more in common with the girls of Au Royaume des Cieux.\n\nThe girls of Au Royaume des Cieux don’t have the luxury of dreams, or even hope. They are just trying to survive in the Haute-Mère reformatory. They are in a far-off and desolate landscape, a place that can only produce rain and mud (another French film from 1949, Such a Pretty Little Beach, uses a very similar landscape as its existential center). There are so many girls — all of them abused, thrown away and/or forgotten. They often huddle together and jam up the frames; it is a crowded and imprisoning space. Most have dabbled in sex work and some have murdered (viewed by society under the same criminal category). They are a rowdy bunch full of pent up lust and the nerve to still act rambunctious despite being beaten down by life.\n\nThey have rare allies in a couple of the authority figures, but that is threatened right at the start. A sudden death puts Mademoiselle Chamblas (Suzy Prim) in charge as director, a position she has craved for 20 years. She is the repressed headmistress archetype think Lili Palmer in The House that Screamed (1969)), misogynistic in nature and conception. This is a film full of transgressive streaks of eroticism; talk of same-sex exploits is a near-constant. While the lesbianism and sadism are not conflated, they are linked to establish a place that makes taboo happenings and histories part of the everyday. These girls have no hope that they can or will exist in the outside world, but at least the reformatory is a safer space than they’ve known. With Chamblas as director, all of that disappears and they are thrust into yet more worthless cruelty. But as Chamblas ascends, a girl named Maria (Suzanne Cloutier) enters. It is her purity and goodness that will gradually mobilize everyone into a revolution.\n\nMaria hasn’t been convicted of any crimes, but pervasively unsafe living arrangements have kept her running away from various homes. Like the other girls, she is seen by society and its systems as the problem, punished for daring to endure, retaliate, or do what is needed to get by. Along the way Maria did find love. Real love. And he is coming for her. At first it seems like Au royaume des cieux is going to be about Maria and Pierre (Serge Reggiani) making their escape. Thankfully, it’s about a lot more than that (love and respect to Maria and Pierre who are sweet, but also too sweet). The couple, with their optimism, devotion, and will, come to represent hope for the girls. At first there is much animosity and infighting, but they eventually unite for a bigger cause — themselves. With their secret ingredient (resident anarchist Camille) acting as final inspiration, they riot and take control of Haute-Mère.\n\nDuvivier’s camera singles out the girls as individuals during key moments. We get a brief reckoning glimpse of each; they get the frame to themselves, as if the camera is taking their photograph. It happens when Maria tells them about Pierre. The more she talks about him, the less it seems like a poor girl’s naivete. Some believe she’s either delusional or foolish. But most become convinced. You can see the hope breaking through on their faces. Love is possible. It’s not all manipulation and lies and violence. It happens again when the girls go on a hunger strike in retaliation of Chamblas’s new policies. Days into their starvation, the school director rolls a gigantic steaming pot of soup to the middle of the room where they all sleep, taunting them with the smell to give up their protests. The camera whip-pans back and forth, soup-to-girl, girl-to-soup, through each and every one of them. We feel the whirlwind of individual temptation and suffering, allowed to register that power lies in numbers, but that those numbers are made up of human beings pushing themselves to the brink for the rights they deserve.\n\n—————————————————————————-\n\nDiametrically opposed visions of postwar French youth: the dreamers and the delinquents. Two unknown films by two well-known directors (Jacques Becker and Julien Duvivier). I couldn’t choose between the two; they belong together.\n\nPrevious What I’ll Remember posts:\n\n1925, 1930, 1943, 1958, 1965, 1969, 1978, 1982, 1992, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\nIt’s that time again! The What I’ll Remember posts are a Top Ten By Year trademark; a fun, engaging, and personalized way of collecting movie memories that represent my time with the years chosen for this project. It’s something I work on gradually while making my way through the watchlist, whether it’s writing down observations, grabbing screencaps, or making notes of what to include. When I look back on these long afterwards, I find countless things I would have otherwise forgotten (despite the name of this feature!) and am always so grateful for having made them. What we take from movies should be more than the, understandably, ‘big picture’ way we tend to evaluate, enjoy, or talk about them. Hopefully this does a little to parse out all the different ways that film, whether taken individually or as a group, can be memorable!\n\nI started 1949 one year ago. The Top Ten By Year: 1949 Poll Results went up in October (almost 300 people voted for ove 250 films!). You can also enjoy 100 (or so) Images from the Films of 1949 which went up last week. The Top Ten By Year: 1949 write-up should go up within a month’s time. And then after that: 1990!\n\n(Note: I am posting this without having actually seen Le Silence de la Mer. It is the last one on my watchlist and I will update this post with anything I need to afterwards)\n\nRaoul Walsh saying everything he needs to say with masterful shot compositions & blocking in Colorado Territory\n\nMax Ophüls saying everything he needs to say with his masterful shot compositions & blocking, his fluid camera constantly recalibrating the characters & their relations to each other, in Caught & The Reckless Moment\n\nUK murders done drolly\n\n(The Hidden Room, Kind Hearts and Coronets)\n\nThe sandy desolation of Une si jolie petite plage (Such a Pretty Little Beach)\n\nThe peppy and shamelessly horny women of On the Town\n\nJulien Duvivier’s Au royaume des cieux (The Sinners), so unseen & unavailable (only 39 votes on imdb & 13 views on letterboxd!), & so completely essential. The lost girls reformatory film of your dreams\n\nThe thrilling ball sequence in Madame Bovary, a 360 degree manifestation of delirium in which Emma’s inner ecstasy and social fantasy are externalized by a sudden & urgent call to “Smash the windows!”\n\n“Begone Dull Care” is really cool. Somewhat less cool: its flickers and sputters almost triggered a panic attack\n\nHarry Lime’s self-satisfied entrance in The Third Man, even better when you realize he never meant to be seen and had seamlessly pivoted into it for the theatrics\n\nCeleste Holm as the all-seeing yet unseen homewrecker Addie Ross in A Letter to Three Wives, an arsenal of sumptous half-whispered poison. The filmis good and all, but give me The Addie Ross story over drunk Jeanne Crain stressing about entering society life any day\n\nNeeding Gene Kelly to calm the fuck down in Take Me Out to the Ball Game. Level of Ham: Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins\n\nIn recent years, Joan Crawford has gone from someone I’ve always casually enjoyed to a pivotal personal icon. The very underrated Flamingo Road, part of her Mildred Pierce stretch of playing tenacious & sexually mature women, illustrates why. Through these roles, her gorgeously soft-lit turmoil & determination are a constant through the barrage of bad luck or bad choices her characters battle\n\nThe Fantasia-esque visuals of “Inspirace”, where droplets and the like morph into a transluscent fairy-tale\n\nPost-WWII Americanization abroad (Late Spring, Bitter Rice, Rendezvous in July)\n\nJoan Greenwood’s voice is like some majestic creature that is going to lull you into an eternal sleep. She is a kind of infuriating opiate in Kind Hearts and Coronets\n\nThe Wizard of Oz-esque use of Technicolor for the garden sequences of The Secret Garden\n\nBrunhilde Esterhazy: best character name or best character name? (and best character!) (On the Town)\n\nThe amusingly superficial posters on the walls of Dorothy Dale’s Charm School, such as the Personality Recipe (the components are appearance based), and the Which Shape Is Your Face? chart, filled with geometrics such as the very not face-shaped triangle (Caught)\n\nTurns out that French films from 1949 with less than 300 views on letterboxd are my jam (Une si jolie petite plage, Rendezvous in July, Au royaume des cieux)\n\nFour characters locked in by glares & jewels & power plays (oh my!) in Bitter Rice\n\nTwo show-stopping costumes presented as spectacles in their own right: Madame Bovary’s whimsical ballgown confection & Delilah’s opulent peacock ensemble (surely a greatest of all-time contender) (Madame Bovary, Samson & Delilah)\n\nThe sing-off turned brawl (recalling 1956’s “Lucy’s Italian Movie” which would use this film as inspiration) in Bitter Rice\n\nThe outré existence of Jose Ferrer’s astrologer/hypnotist character in Whirlpool. He casually outs a party guest as having recently tried to commit suicide (to the amusement of everyone including the man!), hypnotizes himself into post-surgery painlessness, warns his enemy of the alignment of Mars, and says things like “I bow to your abysmal scruples”\n\nThat huge plate of spaghetti in House of Strangers\n\nThe harrowing post-rape sequence in Bitter Rice. Rain, rice fields, and pain externalize the just-past\n\nThat all-too-brief moment when we’re treated to Jean Hagen & Judy Holliday looking really hot in drag in Adam’s Rib\n\nA Letter to Three Wives basically invented auto-tune! (“Why th-hh-hh-ee bl–uuu–eeee ssuuuu-itttt?”) (Courtesy of Sonovox!)\n\nThe whip-pans of Au royaume des cieux\n\nComing around to Richard Conte in a big way with rewatches of Whirlpool and Thieves Highway, and a first-time viewing of House of Strangers\n\n“Setting the Scene” opening narrations\n\n(Beyond the Forest, Border Incident, Flamingo Road, A Letter to Three Wives, Abandoned, The Reckless Moment)\n\nTitle cards! Some favorites!\n\nThe ache of seeing Gene Tierney try to keep her projected congeniality together for her husband in the face of a murder charge & a muggy mind. She has never been more available to us onscreen (Whirlpool)\n\nThe metaphoric horror show of Blood of the Beasts, catapulting me into a meltdown that can only be described as unhealthily distressing\n\nMax Ophüls making 2 (TWO!) films that interrogate what it means to be an American woman. While Leonora has to face the worth of her ideals head-on, Lucia faces the challenge of remaining Steadfast Mother Hen in the midst of violent crisis\n\n(Caught and The Reckless Moment)\n\nThe shot of the dam breaking in Au royaume des cieux\n\nThe borderline surreal climactic heist-in-the-smoke of Criss Cross\n\nThe way James Cagney plays the I-talk-to-my-dead-mother confession to Edmund O’Brien. So intimate and watchful; a critical test that, if he passes, promises the rareness of trust (White Heat)\n\nSemi-documentary trends popping up in films one wouldn’t entirely categorize as such (1949 is in the midst of the semi-documentary procedural craze yet there aren’t many any from this particular year)\n\n(Border Incident, Follow Me Quietly, Abandoned)\n\nThe Third Man, a sweet spot masterpiece. How corny but true to say but every time you watch it it’s like “wow, people made this & now we have it & it’s a thing that exists, how beautiful is that?”\n\nThe terrible grotesquerie of Beyond the Forest which I can honestly say is one of the worst films I’ve seen (worth watching for how weirdly bad it is, I’ve never seen anything quite like it)\n\nAll those two shots with Francesca and Silvana in Bitter Rice\n\nThe famous sewer chase in The Third Man, even better than you remember, even greater than you know it to be. Cinema’s apex? Food for thought….\n\nThe central boxing match in The Set-Up. An absence of humanity, just hungry faces barking for blood, and one man’s committment to redemption\n\nThe canted & cluttered off-kilter world of post-war Vienna in The Third Man\n\nThe bold 1st act of Pinky which, Jeanne Crain casting aside, depicts remarkably honest dilemmas and scenarios about race that are actively confrontational towards white audiences, especially for its time. And then…it ends up being about the film’s one uninteresting story thread!\n\nSeeing Setsuko Hara’s fortress beam of a smile disintegrate as Late Spring unfolds\n\nThe dead vigilant eye of Dame Edith Evans, in death her knowing glower locks onto Anton Walbrook for life in The Queen of Spades\n\nI remember being a teenager when I saw White Heat for the first time, and being shocked by the emotion on display when Cody finds out his mother is dead (“She’s dead.” “She’s dead.” “She’s dead.” etc). It still shocks. A totally unrestrained feral piece of acting by James Cagney\n\nThe “ok byeeee” nature of Harry Lime’s exit (“So long Holly!”) immediately following the cuckoo clock speech in The Third Man. Also, Orson’s delivery of this speech and all of the rest of it. Nobody else would say Harry’s lines in his perfectly natural offhand way, with a rhythm that is its own kind of music. It makes you love the character. There is an urge to shout “No, wait, don’t go, you just got here!”\n\nGeraldine Brooks in The Reckless Moment making me wish it didn’t take until the 50s for us to see teens with modern gumption onscreen\n\nElizabeth Taylor playing her first adult part (Conspirator), while still shaking off now-awkward kiddie roles like Amy in Little Women\n\nThe first halves of Tension and I Was a Male War Bride. Before the detective enters the scene, Tension is the best kind of lurid noir. And then there’s the sexy outdoors slapstick of I Was a Male War Bride, before it gives way to pleasant but ho-hum bureaucracy humor\n\nMoney destroys\n\n(The Rocking Horse Winner, Too Late for Tears, Caught, Thieves Highway)\n\nAnna’s forthright walk through the autumnal street; past Holly, past us. Through two funerals, she shuns the living through her loyalty to the dead\n\n(The Third Man)\n\nThe height of the social problem film trend of the late 1940s, which would emerge as a mainstream trend in the 1950s\n\n(Pinky, Intruder in the Dust, Home of the Brave, Lost Boundaries, The Lady Gambles, Never Fear, Not Wanted, Knock on Any Door)\n\nThe surrealist wall paintings in Audrey Totter’s apartment in Alias Nick Beal\n\nTime, As a Factor\n\n(On the Town, The Set-Up, D.O.A.)\n\nSilvana Magnano’s face and body in Bitter Rice. Just go see for yourself.\n\nSamson & Delilah: DeMille still kinking it up with incredible costumes, scope, & Technicolor. I loved it.\n\nFlashback Fever:\n\n(The Fan, The Accused, Beyond the Forest, Champion, Criss Cross, Knock on Any Door, Twelve O’ Clock High, Edward, My Son, A Woman’s Secret, Black Magic, House of Strangers, Not Wanted, Kind Hearts and Coronets. A Letter to Three Wives, The Passionate Friends). These last two feature particularly intricate flashback structures, which confused some audiences at the time\n\nThe beautiful and sensual closing scene of I Shot Jesse James. They are outside but you’d never know it. They are faces emerged from blackness, a woman soothing her man in his final moments\n\nFrancesca’s character arc in Bitter Rice, from tossed aside moll to solidarity among hard-working women\n\nThe dance-hall scene in Caught; freedom in a crowd. Ophüls’ roving camera canvasses the outskirts. Two characters connect with their guards down, making room for candid and infectious laughter\n\nClaude Rains unmatched ability to humanize characters who might otherwise not have been (The Passionate Friends)\n\nWe don’t meet the son in Edward, My Son!? We don’t learn why the confession happened in A Woman’s Secret?! These might work if the films were any good but they aren’t so it’s just nonsensical and very frustrating\n\nThis shot from Easy Living (1949, Tourneur), so full of longing. The film is barely regarded, even by Tourneur enthusiasts, in part because it was one a “one for them” of his. But it’s got a Daisy Kenyon vibe in that it’s a refreshing drama from the late 40s about complicated adults with complicated adult problems\n\nA hill of tumbling apples & a fiery truck. A man burns for capitalism, but capitalism doesn’t burn for him (Thieves Highway)\n\nWomen in conflict with their desire for the finer things in life and for true love. Two different choices are made in The Passionate Friends and Caught\n\nKirk Douglas’ final scene in Champion; some of the most nakedly raw pre-Brando acting out there. Between him & James Cagney’s similarly animalistic outbursts in White Heat, 1949 features really powerful moments showcasing the vulnerability of male monsters\n\nThe Tale of the Countess Ranevskaya in The Queen of Spades\n\nThis particularly hot Burt Lancaster look in Criss Cross\n\nThe way The Passionate Friends illuminates interior lives & times past\n\nOne of life’s great joys: watching Anton Walbrook become untethered onscreen (The Queen of Spades)\n\nThe German Professor Bhaer in Little Women being very obviously Italian (played by Rossano Brazzi). Actually, most Professor Bhaer’s aren’t German now that I think about it!\n\nThe end of Easy Living; a shocking, nakedly misogynistic action, and a truly bold storytelling choice. I’ve rarely felt this kind of disappointment in a character\n\nFeeling immediate worship and loyalty for Audrey Totter based on this early moment from Tension (delivered like “Drrriiiffffffttttt”)\n\nThe remnants of an apple peel and their heartbreaking significance in Late Spring\n\nApartment life at the end of the Chinese Civil War in Crows and Sparrows, only released at the end of the Chinese Civil War because it dared to be in opposition of Chiang Kai-shek’s corrupt government\n\nA special shout-out to Lt. Kitty Lawrence, a bit character in I Was a Male War Bride whose short time onscreen is used for explicit kink-wishing. (“He could leave marks on me anytime. I’d bring the stick!”)\n\nFlights of Fantasy (films that break with reality in different ways)\n\nOn the Town, My Dream is Yours, The Passionate Friends, Alice in Wonderland\n\nThe funky car-boat in Rendezvous in July, whimsically floating down the Seine, and featuring eye illustrations that reappear on costumes & decor throughout the film\n\nThe stale taste left in my mouth as I watched scenes from The Shop Around the Corner (presumably from its source material) lifelessly recreated word-for-word by the cast of In the Good Old Summertime\n\nDan Duryea’s nickname for Lizabeth Scott in Too Late for Tears (“Don’t ever change, Tiger. I don’t think I’d like you with a heart”)\n\nAdaptations using badly dated, and entirely invented, framing devices with the authors as characters (Black Magic, Madame Bovary, Alice in Wonderland)\n\nToshiro Mifune finally allowing himself to release all of his pent-up emotions in The Quiet Duel\n\nThe faceless mannequin in Follow Me Quietly, and that chilling time we are fooled by it\n\nWith Jour de Fête as my 4th Tati, it might be time for me to admit he’s just not for me\n\nLizabeth Scott completely and unapologetically owning her roles as the most materialistic of women in both Too Late for Tears and Easy Living\n\nDeborah Kerr’s bitter drunken hag performance in the last act of Edward, My Son. Is it good? Is it bad? Hell if I know, but it’s something\n\nHoping that one day Lou Bunin’s Alice in Wonderland can be seen in better condition. It’s not good, but the stop-motion animation & sets are quite imaginative. Fuck Disney for going out of its way to successfully squash this (they are even responsible for the subpar color film stock they ended up using)\n\nWhirlpool & The Reckless Moment: two very different 1949 women’s noirs exploring the masks projected by married women at the sacrifice of themselves. In the former the turmoil is internal, about the psychology and relationship. In the latter, things spiral externally; noir and family are inextricable as Joan Bennett puts a brave face forward in juggling it all alone (the husband is away). They each even write letters to their respective spouses that are either thrown away or not completed\n\nThe # of films across genres from western to sports drama to fantasy to noir that are just about nuanced humans with palpable lived histories & relationships. These films transcend their genres & feel primarily identifiable and connceted by this instead\n\n(Colorado Territory, Rope of Sand, Easy Living, The Set-Up, Alias Nick Beal, Caught)\n\nAudrey Totter and the boxing ticket. To tear or not to tear? (The Set-Up)\n\nTraces of gay!\n\n(“Christmas USA”, “Puce Moment”, Such a Pretty Little Beach, Au Royaume des Cieux)\n\nThe evocative autumn backgrounds in the otherwise pretty dreadful The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad\n\nDavid Brian aka: The Pits. As if Hollywood thrust a crusty newscaster into leading roles (romantic opposites with Joan & Bette, the nerve! Bette is cheating on Joseph Cotten with this bag of sand in Beyond the Forest) showing a total disregard for audiences everywhere\n\n(Intruder in the Dust, Beyond the Forest, Flamingo Road)\n\nThe age of Pseudo Psychoanalytic films winds down with Whirlpool. Preminger’s characteristically sober touch makes an unconventional approach for this kind of story\n\nThe Set-Up as a collective conduit for all the souls who inhabit the film. Such vivid empathy and consideration for the various crushing predicaments and hopes of these characters\n\nThe unlikely focuses of Thieves Highway. A roadside breakdown patiently unfolds as a life is saved and a bond is formed. You expect it to have bearing on the plot. It doesn’t. But it has plenty on the story\n\nConfirmation upon rewatch that I still don’t care for Adam’s Rib\n\n“Puce Moment” becoming a literal aesthetic board when I got prints made of screenshots and now have them taped to my sides of my vanity\n\nMontgomery Clift’s inherent tenderness complicating his performance & putting him intriguingly at-odds with his character in The Heiress\n\nVan Helfin’s suppressed & then unstable guilt in Act of Violence, initiating the film’s left-turn segue into the underworld\n\nFather and daughter on opposite sides of the road in Late Spring; change is already here\n\nThe deep affection I developed for Christine in Rendezvous in July. She is maligned by her friends for her mean streak & envy, but her actions, driven by insecurity & mediocrity, are easy to understand. The more unforgiving the film & its occupants are toward her, the more I came to empathize and love her\n\nFacing imminent death straight-to-camera in the final moments of Criss Cross\n\nOrson goes to Europe\n\n(The Third Man, Black Magic)\n\nThe brutal historical noir of Reign of Terror, courtesy of Anthony Mann. Invasive close-ups, tight spaces, paranoia, double agents, and plenty of beheadings\n\nThe hypnotizing hypnotizing sequences of Black Magic!\n\nThe sympathetic eye that Ida Lupino lends Sally Forrest in her social issue melodrama Not Wanted. Nobody is an archetype, there is no “don’t do this & you’ll be fine” angle. It’s all refreshingly light on didactics\n\nAdult Amy’s outfit entrance. Autumn-as-dress; magnificent (Little Women)\n\nFavorite Performances of 1949:\n\nSilvana Mangano in Bitter Rice, Doris Dowling in Bitter Rice, Joan Crawford in Flamingo Road, Gene Tierney in Whirlpool, Judy Holliday in Adam’s Rib, Claude Rains in The Passionate Friends, Audrey Totter in Tension, Virginia Mayo in Colorado Territory, Celeste Holm in A Letter to Three Wives, Juano Hernandez in Intruder in the Dust, John Ireland in I Shot Jesse James, Lucille Ball in Easy Living, Gerard Philipe in Such a Pretty Little Beach, Dan Duryea in Too Late for Tears, Orson Welles in The Third Man, Barbara Bel Geddes in Caught, Olivia de Havilland in The Heiress, Toshiro Mifune in The Quiet Duel, Setsuko Hara in Late Spring, Chishû Ryû in Late Spring, Richard Basehart in Reign of Terror, Anton Walbrook in The Queen of Spades, Doris Day in My Dream is Yours, Mary Astor in Act of Violence, Lee J.

She’d appear in other films & TV, but there was no place made for her as an adolescent\n\nBette Davis saying “I’m Rosi Moline” over and over again in Beyond the Forest, while I just kept hearing Nomi Malone\n\nOf Mankiewicz’s two films from 1949: House of Strangers > A Letter to Three Wives\n\nBetty Garrett openly lusting after an atypically girl-shy Frank Sinatra in both Take Me Out to the Ball Game and On the Town\n\nLoretta Young’s wardrobe in the hyper-slight but genuinely pleasant Lloyd Bacon Technicolor comedy Mother is a Freshman, in which everybody wants…..Van Johnson…\n\nThe Miss Turnstiles Ballet sequence, the perfect example of my (and Kelly/Donen too!) penchant for abstract monochromatic sets from studio-era Hollywood. Vera Ellen gets to show off her talents and be the perfect hyper-faceted non-existent fantasy woman, all in just a few minutes.\n\nThe “Cool Girl” equivalent of its era.\n\n(On the Town)\n\nDear Everyone,\n\nHow did it take me this long to love Doris Day?\n\nSincerely, A Former Fool\n\n(My Dream is Yours & It’s a Great Feeling)\n\nOn the Town, the first musical shot (very much in-part) on-location, the bulk of which is the film’s opening number. It’s a thrill seeing these actors buoyantly hit every major tourist spot in the fantastical time-compress only the movies can provide\n\nFinally having context for that oft-used all-timer Judy Garland gif\n\n(In the Good Old Summertime)\n\n🎶🎶”The Bronx is up and the Battery’s down”🎶🎶\n\n(On the Town)\n\nThe bonkers part-animation dream sequence that comes out of nowhere in My Dream is Yours.

Such a sympathetic moment as he awkwardly hides them behind his back\n\nThe stone-cold hardening of Catherine’s (Olivia de Havilland) soul through heartbreak in The Heiress\n\nSeeing one of the glass figurines that Karel Zeman used in his stop-motion short “Inspirace” at the Karel Zeman Museum, and finally getting around to watching it!\n\nJoan Crawford giving Sydney Greenstreet what for in Flamingo Road with a couple of swift and much-deserved slaps…….an action she lampoons in It’s a Great Feeling, one of cinema’s best cameos!\n\n(Jack Carson: [after being slapped]: What was that for?\n\nJoan Crawford: Oh, I do that in all my pictures.)\n\nS.Z.

Order was not required since it had no bearing on the results.\n\nNote: All votes for They Live by Night, Bicycle Thieves, Gun Crazy, The Fallen Idol, “Fireworks”, Stromboli, Les Enfants Terribles did not count towards the final tally. However, they remain included in the individual ballot listings.\n\nFirst off, thank you so much to everyone who voted! 1949 had more participants than any other poll! 289 people voted for 257 different films!\n\nHalfway through my 1949 watchlist, and I’m consistently thrilled by the world of noir, melodrama, musicals, and beyond, from one of my favorite decades in film. I’ve seen a few new-to-me favorites, discovered films by turns beguiling, mature, miscalculated, and inventive, and revisited some I loved or liked, but had forgotten, that have revealed themselves to be vital. I’ve been reading Reinventing Hollywood by David Bordwell, his new book on 40s Hollywood’s storytelling mechanics, or schemas as he calls them, and the many ways that fundamentally accepted narrative devices of cinema were actually shaped during this period (itself greatly influenced by literature, theater, etc). I also read Dennis Broe’s Film Noir, American Workers, and Postwear Hollywood (highly recommended even if I already lost all the information I learned from it because my brain is bad at retaining stuff).\n\nI’m taking a much more casual approach to 1949. 1969 was very ambitious for me, so I wanted to take a step back. This means going at a more relaxed pace, not putting pressure on myself, making more room for other non-1949 viewings and non-film related interests, and not taking on intense projects related to Top Ten By Year. I’m keeping it simple this time. In fact, I happen to be moving at the same pace viewing-wise, but by erasing the sense of urgency I tend to impart on this project, it feels different this time.\n\nThe Third Man was always going to be #1, and who can argue with that? I’m admittedly bummed that none of the amazing triple-header lying just outside the Top Ten (The Reckless Moment, A Letter to Three Wives, and Caught), came so close to making it, but could not overcome the lively but mediocre Adam’s Rib. Nevertheless, I’m so thrilled that those three films received as many votes as they did. They are all remarkable. I’m also really happy that quite a few people have seen and love Alias Nick Beal and Too Late for Tears, especially since the former is not readily available on any streaming or physical media, and the latter was only restored three years ago.\n\nSome housekeeping:\n\nI decided to list the production companies for most of these films. The forties were a time when most films can be attributed to one studio, making it a straightforward task. It is also particularly important to note when it comes to crediting works from Hollywood’s early decades. The other main reason I list them is because the forties were a formative time for the beginning of independent film. In 1941, the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers was founded, with efforts to maintain the rights of independent producers and to end monopolistic practices by the major studios. They succeeded in 1948, with the game-changing Hollywood Antitrust Case, which decreed that movie studios sell their theater chains, end blind-buying, and drastically reduce block-booking, thereby eliminating several major monopolistic practices. The full impact of this would obviously take much longer than a year to occur, but there were enough independently financed films by 1949 (largely distributed by major studios) to justify taking the time to list all the studios and companies.\n\nSeveral people listed “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” short, and I decided early on to mainline these votes and count them as The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad. As I tallied everything I began to regret this a lot but had already committed to it, and it would have been just one more thing to account for in this post (which is already arduous enough to put together!) So I apologize, and just know that some of those votes were just for “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” short.\n\nAnd last but not least: it’s October. Many people have spooky names on their twitter right now. I usually put your name next to the handle if it is readily available, but it was impossible this time. So I only put names next to people who I knew, and who write for sites or publications readily available on their twitter bio. I know I missed a lot of people, so please don’t take offense if your credits aren’t listed. I didn’t have time to hunt all the information down, so I went mostly off of who and what I knew offhand.\n\nTaking into account the Internet oversaturation of lists/listicles, I hope it’s clear that this project is anything but tossed off. The Top Ten By Year Project is an effort to reclaim what I love about lists in the first place. Seeing what makes the collective top ten is a lot of fun, but may I direct your attention to the full breakdown of votes and the individual ballots? My hope with these polls is that, in addition to planting seeds of anticipation for the related posts to come (What I’ll Remember About the Films of 1949: A Love Letter, A Selection of Favorite Shots, and the Top Ten), they mainly serve as a resource for anyone looking for new films to watch whether it’s from seeing:\n\na. what ‘Film Twitter’ collectively loves\n\nb. more importantly, the films towards the bottom of the list, the ones you’ve never heard of that are begging for (re)discovery.\n\nc. the individual ballots from people whose taste and knowledge you value\n\nSurprises?
