King Vidor’s non-musical “La Boheme” (1926), starring Lillian Gish and John Gilbert, is one of a number of tantalizing films I have never seen that went on sale today at the Warner Archive. Other silents among the new releases include Vidor’s “Wild Oranges” (1924) starring Virginia Valli; John S. Robertson’s “Captain Salvation” (1927) with Lars Hanson; the filmed-on-location “White Shadows in the South Seas” (1928) directed by W.S. Van Dyke and an uncredited Robert Flaherty (the latter was fired); George W. Hill’s “The Flying Fleet” (1929) starring Ramon Navarro; and Alan Dwan’s “Tide of Empire” (1929) with Renee Adoree. There’s William A. Seiter’s early talkie version of the musical “Sunny” (1930) starring the legendary Marilyn Miller, as well as a pair of pre-Code comedies with Warren William and Marion Marsh: Archie Mayo’s “Under 18” (1932) and Roy Del Ruth’s “Beauty and the Boss” (1933). The two new classic-era releases at Warner Archive I actually have seen are Clarence Brown’s delightful adventure comedy “They Met in Bombay” (1941) starring Clark Gable and Rosalind Russell; and Dick Powell’s directorial debut, the atomic-testing noir “Split Second” (1952) with Stephen McNally and Alexis Smith.
