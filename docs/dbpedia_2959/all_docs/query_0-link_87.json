        "text": "In the dynamic world of music, a few trailblazers stand out, reshaping the industry with their audacious ideas and unshakeable passion.\n\nAndy Macdonald – the maverick behind the Go Discs and Independiente record labels – is undeniably one such luminary.\n\nWith a knack for spotting raw talent and an unwavering commitment to artistic authenticity, Andy is one of the most successful UK independent music entrepreneurs of the modern era.\n\nIn this World Exclusive Podcast conversation, we discover how his early interactions with the music industry at Stiff Records exposed him to the inner workings of record labels and the art of artist development.\n\nWe learn how his journey in the business was kick-started through a strong passion for discovering and nurturing talent and a conversation that lit the fuse…\n\nAnd for the first time, Andy shares his experiences with Paul Weller.\n\nFrom signing him to Go Discs in 1992 and the release of their first single together “Uh Huh Oh Yeh!“.\n\nThis was the song that open up my world to Weller and what a journey it was in the 90s!.\n\nThat debut solo album (via a Japanese record label) to Wild Wood and then the huge success of Stanley Road.\n\nWe’ll hear how they continued to work together through Heavy Soul and Heliocentric, despite the Polygram takeover of the label, and then onto a new venture – Independiente with the albums Days of Speed and Illumination.\n\nClick your preferred podcast platform to listen…\n\n1983 – Go Discs begins…\n\nIn 1983, Andy Macdonald set up Go Discs. He quickly established the label as a breeding ground for innovative and groundbreaking artists with early signings including The Box, Billy Bragg, Captains of Industry, The Housemartins (Beautiful South would also be a massive success later on) and The LAs.\n\nAndy’s vision was simple yet profound: to provide a platform for artists to express their creativity without compromising their artistic integrity. This ethos resonated deeply with musicians and listeners alike, setting Go Discs Records apart from its contemporaries.\n\nAndy launched Go! Beat in 1992 as a subsidiary of Go! Discs, signing up Gabrielle, Portishead and Norman Cook’s Beats International.\n\nAndy Macdonald & Paul Weller : A Legendary Collaboration\n\nOne of the most significant partnerships in Andy Macdonald’s career was with Paul Weller.\n\nA collaboration that tied in with my own discovery of Paul’s music via that very first Go Discs release. Uh Huh Oh Yeh! backed with Arrival Time, Fly on the Wall and Always There To Fool You…\n\nThose four songs were enough to get me hooked…\n\nThe debut solo album on Go Discs soon followed (financed by a Japanese label ahead of the deal with Andy) and we had a second single from the album – Above The Clouds.\n\nPaul Weller was back with a bang…\n\nConfidence returning – backed by the faith of a label boss who believed in him – I was next blown away by another new single Sunflower… and then that incredible second solo album – Wild Wood – still a favourite to this day.\n\nThe album marked a departure, perhaps an evolution?, from Paul’s previous work, embracing a folk and soul-influenced sound with a blend of acoustic and electric instrumentation. The release once again showcased his willingness to experiment and grow as an artist. Well-crafted, introspective lyrics that touch on themes of personal growth, reflection, and the passage of time….\n\nSuch was the success of the platinum-selling LP , that we had another new single in 1994 – Hung Up – and a re-issue of the album with it added to the track-listing.\n\n1994 on Go Discs saw the release of a new song – Out of the Sinking – backed by a cover of The Beatles’ Sexy Sadie and a fantastic Lynch Mob Dub remix of Sunflower.\n\n1995 saw the biggest success for sales with the label through the release of what have become three classic singles The Changingman, You Do Something to Me and Broken Stones.\n\nThe album Stanley Road achieved huge commercial success and critical acclaim, reaching the top of the UK charts. Its impact was further solidified by its ability to capture the spirit of the mid-’90s Britpop era, cementing Paul Weller’s status as a musical luminary and demonstrating his adeptness at crafting songs that blend meaningful narratives with infectious melodies.\n\nThe album sold more than 1.5 million – making it the biggest selling album of his career – including The Jam and The Style Council.\n\n1995 also saw the release of Go Discs’ Help album for War Child with The Smokin’ Mojo Filters – Come Together in a charity project lead by Andy and the label.\n\nIn February 1996, with Stanley Road having gone treble platinum (it had been in the Top 20 since release (10 months), Paul and Andy released the album version of Out of the Sinking, backed by 3 extra tracks, as a limited edition single for one week only.\n\nIn August of that year, Paul’s Go Discs career closed out with the release of Peacock Suit, which premiered on TOTP as a rare fully live performance on the show!.\n\nIn a heart-breaking development for Andy Macdonald, Go Discs were then taken over by Polygram.\n\nHe left the company soon afterwards and set up a new label called Independiente within days.\n\nIt’s not too high praise to say that these Go Discs releases changed my life.\n\nThe discovery of a singer, songwriter & musician that has connected deeply with me over 30 years now.\n\nAnd testiment to Andy Maconald. These works not only solidified Paul Weller’s reputation as a formidable artist but also showcased Andy’s knack for nurturing talent and allowing artists to thrive creatively.\n\n1997 – Andy sets up Independiente…\n\nAs you’ll hear on the podcast, despite the loss of his label, Andy continued to work closely with Paul, working on promotion for Heavy Soul and Heliocentric (both released on Island Records via Polygram).\n\nAndy had set up a new label – Independiente – releasing albums from the likes of Travis, Vitro, Sunhouse, Roddy Frame, John Martyn, Gomez, Embrace and Martina Topley-Bird.\n\nThe label stopped releasing new singles and albums in 2009, becoming a catalogue management company.\n\nIt was acquired by Concord Bicycle Music in 2018.\n\nPaul’s first release for Independiente came in October 2001 with his stunning Days of Speed project.\n\nThe ‘live and acoustic’ album spanned Paul’s career from The Jam through The Style Council and onto his latest solo work (this was off the back of Heliocentric). The album featured 18 songs, some of which Paul hadn’t played in 10 years. The tracks were recorded on a huge global tour.\n\nIt’s Written in the Stars came next, a new single released on 2nd September 2002, which saw the first sounds to come from Simon Dine (a former Go Discs employee). We were treated to a double CD single release with B-sides Horseshoe Drama (also created with Simon) and Push Button, Automatic (lyrics from Drummer, Steve White) on CD1 and Days of Speed tour bonus tracks The Butterfly Collector and Carnation on CD2.\n\nPaul’s 6th solo studio album – Illumination was released on Independiente on the 16th September 2002. Once again, joining up with Andy gave Paul a chart topping album (Paul’s fourth).\n\nHe continued to push artistic boundaries, embracing a more electronic and experimental sound at times, while still retaining his signature songwriting depth. The album’s themes delve into introspection, love, and social commentary.\n\nAnother double CD single release saw out the deal with Independiente. Leafy Mysteries backed by Talisman and a live version of Wild Wood on CD1 , with live versions of Leafy Mysteries, Broken Stones and Peacock Suit on CD 2.\n\nIndependiente also released a couple of DVDs – LIve Two Classic Performances which featured the show from Hyde Park and 13 acoustic tracks from Later… with Jools Holland plus Live at Braehead which captured the Illumination tour with a show in Glasgow.\n\nThe Legacy of Andy Macdonald\n\nAndy Macdonald’s impact on the music industry extends far beyond his role as the founder of these record labels. His dedication to authenticity, innovation, and artist-centric values continues to inspire both industry professionals and aspiring musicians.\n\nHis journey from a music enthusiast to the visionary behind these two labels is a testament to the power of passion and commitment. His unwavering belief in nurturing talent and allowing artists to express themselves authentically transformed the music industry.\n\nPaul Weller – Go Discs\n\nAlbums\n\n1992 – Paul Weller – UK Number 8\n\n1993 – Wild Wood – UK Number 2\n\n1994 – Live Wood – UK Number 13\n\n1995 – Stanley Road – UK Number 1\n\nSingles\n\n1992 Uh Huh, Oh Yeh\n\n1992 Above the Clouds\n\n1993 Sunflower\n\n1993 Wild Wood\n\n1994 Hung Up\n\n1994 Out of the Sinking\n\n1995 The Changingman\n\n1995 You Do Something to Me\n\n1995 Broken Stones\n\n1995 The Smokin’ Mojo Filters – Come Together\n\n1996 Out of the Sinking (Reissue)\n\nPaul Weller – Independiente\n\nAlbums\n\n2001 – Days of Speed – UK Number 3\n\n2002 – Illumination – UK Number 1\n\nSingles\n\n2002 It’s Written in the Stars\n\n2002 Leafy Mysteries\n\nSome Other Selected Highlights…\n\nHelp for War Child\n\nIn 1995, Go! Discs became the label partner of a hugely ambitious charity project to raise funds for the then little-known War Child. The Help Album, featured new songs and covers from Oasis, Radiohead, Blur, the Stone Roses, the Manic Street Preachers plus The Smokin’ Mojo Filters with Pau Weller, Noel Gallagher, Paul McCartney and others… The album was recorded, mixed and released all within the same week. It made over £1 million for War Child.\n\nTravis\n\nTravis signing to Independiente in 1997 marked a significant turning point in the band’s career.\n\nThe move allowed the band more creative freedom and control over their music.\n\nIt’s been said that the band was signed to Macdonald personally, not to the label—if Andy ever left the label, the band would have gone with him (commonly referred to in the industry as a “golden handcuffs” clause).\n\nUnder Independiente, Travis released their most critically acclaimed and biggest selling albums.\n\nKicking off with Good Feeling in 1997, which led to the band supporting Oasis on tour.\n\n1999 saw the release of The Man Who, which included hit singles Writing to Reach You, Driftwood, Why Does It Always Rain on Me and Turn. The album’s success not only solidified Travis as a prominent British band but also demonstrated the benefits of their decision to sign with an independent label.\n\nThe Invisible Band followed in 2001 – selling over 3.5 million copies worldwide with songs such as Sing, Side and Flowers in the Window.\n\nThe band released 2003’s 12 Memories and 2007’s The Boy with No Name on the label.\n\nThe collaboration with Independiente allowed them to craft an album that resonated with audiences and showcased their musical growth without the constraints of a major label’s commercial pressures.\n\nBilly Bragg"
