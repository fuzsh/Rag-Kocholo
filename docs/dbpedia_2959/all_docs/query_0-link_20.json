        "text": "With the publication of The Islander coinciding with his eighty-fifth birthday, Chris Blackwell says: “It’s over sixty years since I started Island Records. It seems a good time to write about the people and musicians I’ve worked with and the places I’ve loved. It’s been quite a trip”.\n\nNine Eight Books’ Pete Selby adds: “Chris Blackwell is a true pioneer. As important a figure as the acts he nurtured. With Island Records he established the template that other record labels could only aspire to whilst personally signing, guiding and producing some of the greatest and most creative artists of all time. The Islander captures that maverick spirit of adventure, passion and possibility that is the mark of Chris Blackwell. It’s an honour to be publishing his incredible memoir at Nine Eight Books”.\n\nThe Islander will be published in June 2022."
