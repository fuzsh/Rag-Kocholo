The saxophonist/ singer/ songwriter is a perennial favorite at the annual Blues Music Awards in Memphis, having been voted in the “Best Instrumentalist/Horn” category with seven nominations and two wins. Now, he proves he’s Just Got Started, with the upcoming release of his new album on September 13. Just Got Started was recorded in March at Greaseland Studios in San Jose, California, and was produced, engineered, mixed and mastered by Christoffer \"Kid\" Andersen.\n\n\"Jimmy Carpenter continues to be a stand-out artist in the contemporary Blues genre. His songwriting is on point and his voice is front and center,” says Gulf Coast president Mike Zito. “Arguably one of the best sax players around, his artistry on this new record has come together to make the circle complete.\"\n\n​\n\n“When my dear friend Mike Zito asked if I'd be interested in working with producer Kid Andersen at Greaseland Studios for my third Gulf Coast Records release, my answer was an immediate and empathic ‘YES!,” recalls Carpenter. “Kid has done some very fine work with several friends of mine, and I love those records.\n\n​\n\n“I love Soul music, and my idea for this one was to lean in that direction. Still Blues-based, but also song oriented and funky cool with a kind of vintage soul vibe. I told Kid that, and he immediately said ‘Yes, we can do that!’\n\n​\n\n“The week before the session I was a little nervous, and called my friend Albert Castiglia, who had just recorded there. He gave me some very good advice: ‘Jimmy, just trust Kid, he has a plan;’ and he was so right. And the plan was to take my songs and put them in the capable hands of some of the finest musicians on the planet, which worked out very well.”\n\n“The title track, ‘(Feels Like) I Just Got Started,’ is my attempt to use the last set of a night as a metaphor for my life in music,” explains Carpenter.” I've been at this a very long time and honestly, my career is at its high point; it's not ebbing, it's flowing! I really do feel in many ways like I'm just getting started. There's a line in the bridge, ‘Don't blink or you'll miss it!’ and that is a fact!\n\n​\n\n“Living in Vegas, people often ask if I'm a gambler. My stock answer is always - I only gamble with my heart. That's been banging around my head for years, and I finally wrote the song. It has the advantage of being true, and that gamble has paid off nicely here in Sin City.\n\n​\n\n“There are nods to some of the Blues icons: a very different version of Little Walter's ‘My Babe;’ a nice cover of Otis Rush's ‘Working Man;’ a nod to Delbert McClinton, one of my favorite people, and his song ‘Leap of Faith’ (Lisa ‘Li'l Baby’ Andersen absolutely crushes that one); as well as a super funky version of Allen Toussaint's ‘Night People.’\n\n​\n\n“And for the first time I was able to record not one, but two tunes from my saxophone hero, King Curtis: ‘Soul Theme’ and ‘Midnight Blue.’ In kind of a full circle thing, bass player Jerry Jemmott was King Curtis' bassist, so I felt kind of a cosmic connection to him as we recorded those, and of course, Jerry's bass lines were perfect.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n“This album is very different than the previous five; more groovy and soulful, but not overdone. The musicianship really brings it home, and I could feel the love as we recorded it. I'm playing these songs live, and from the reaction we're getting, I think the people dig it! I am so grateful for Kid's steady hand and unparalleled guitar work, Jerry Jemmott, Derrick D'Mar Martin, Jim Pugh, Bobby Vega, and Lisa Andersen for taking really good care of me and my songs... And of course, Mike Zito and everyone at Gulf Coast for this opportunity. I Just Got Started, and I still got a long way to go!”\n\nJUST GOT STARTED -- TRACK LISTING\n\n​\n\n1.

KEVIN BURT\n\n“ ’Mama, I Love You’ was written a few years back after witnessing a black man getting killed on camera at the hands of a white man for no reason other than fear and hate. It wasn’t the first time I had witnessed such an act but after the last time, I couldn’t hold back the overwhelming feelings of sadness and rage. I pitched the song to my friend Kevin Burt, who is African American, for him to sing on his next album but he felt that the message would be more powerful if I, a white man were to sing it. He telling me that took me a while to process because I just didn’t feel that way at the time. Later on as the song evolved and developed musically and lyrically, I warmed up to the idea of singing it but I suggested that we do it as a duet. I wrote the song, but Kevin and bass legend Jerry Jemmott added so much to the tune in the studio that I gave them songwriting credit as well. It was an honor and a privilege to create this with them.”\n\n​\n\nAlbert adds, “When I write songs, they’re usually fueled by intense joy, sadness and anger. That’s just how it is with me. The concept of racism is something I will never understand. For someone to hate another based on the color of their skin befuddles me and makes me furious to no end. There’s never been a place for it and I feel it’s hindered this country’s ability to reach its full potential, and I say this as a loyal American. I love this country very much, but there is still much left to be done here in terms of race relations and understanding one another.” -- Albert Castiglia\n\nWE'RE STILL FRIENDS ft.

Gulf Coast will release the new album’s first single, “Centerline,” featuring Popa Chubby (along with single and album digital pre-orders at all digital outlets), on June 14; to be followed by “Mama I Love You,” featuring Kevin Burt, on June 28; and “You Can’t Judge a Book By the Cover,” featuring Christone ”Kingfish” Ingram and Rayne Castiglia, on July 12th.\n\n\"During last year’s ‘Blood Brothers’ tour, Mike Zito informed me that it was time for me to do another solo album,” explains Albert Castiglia about the new album’s genesis. “At that moment, I felt I was ill-prepared for the task. I had been constantly touring with Mike for the last two years, doing very little writing, so I didn’t have a lot of original material. My last two studio albums were quite thematic. With Masterpiece, the album centered around the discovery of my daughter. I Got Love was fueled by my life during the pandemic of 2020. What would be the thing that fuels the next one? It concerned me because if I’m not living the songs, it’ll never work. It had to mean something to me. Mike suggested we make it an album with guests, my friends so to speak. I was concerned my friends wouldn’t have time to devote to the project. I was wrong, so wrong. Joe Bonamassa, Josh Smith, Kevin Burt, Gary Hoey, Ally Venable, Popa Chubby, Rick Estrin, Kid and Lisa Andersen, Alabama Mike, Jimmy Carpenter, Kingfish Ingram, Danielle Nicole, Monster Mike Welch, Jerry Jemmott, D-Mar Martin, Jon Otis, Jim Pugh and others stepped up for me. My daughter Rayne even participated, which was the cherry on top. Suddenly,the theme became clear. It’s about friends and family. It’s about Righteous Souls.”\n\n“I think Righteous Souls is a big step forward artistically for my friend Albert Castiglia,” says Gulf Coast president Mike Zito. “His singing, the songs, and his guitar playing are highly elevated on this new album. It’s fantastic to watch Albert grow as an artist; he is one of a kind.”\n\nThe new album is chock-full of Albert Castiglia’s signature sounds: blistering guitar licks flavored with righteously-soulful vocals that send a powerful blues message. Along with a number of original songs, Righteous Souls includes Castiglia’s takes on a batch of cover songs from Willie Dixon, Buddy Guy, Eric Clapton/Rick Danko and two written by his former boss and mentor, the late, great Junior Wells (“Come On In This House” and “What My Mama Told Me ).”\n\nTHE RIGHTEOUS BAND\n\nAlbert Castiglia - Vocals and Guitar\n\nJerry Jemmott - Bass\n\nJim Pugh - Keyboards\n\nDerrick D’Mar Martin - Drums\n\nKid Andersen - Guitar, Keys, and Bass\n\nLisa ‘Little Baby’ Andersen - Backing Vocals\n\nJon Otis - Percussion\n\nJack Sanford - Bari Sax\n\nEddie Tarczy - Harpsichord\n\nGUEST MUSICIANS - THE RIGHTEOUS SOULS\n\nRayne Castiglia - Vocals\n\nJoe Bonamassa - Guitar\n\nJosh Smith - Guitar\n\nDanielle Nicole - Vocals\n\nChristone ‘Kingfish’ Ingram - Guitar\n\nPopa Chubby - Guitar\n\nAlly Venable - Guitar\n\nKevin Burt - Vocals\n\nMonster Mike Welch - Guitar\n\nGary Hoey - Guitar\n\nRick Estrin - Harmonica\n\nJimmy Carpenter - Saxophone\n\nAlabama Mike - Vocals\n\n✪ Gulf Coast Records Artists Win Three Blues Music Awards\n\nat the 45th Annual Blues Music Awards in Memphis, TN ✪\n\nCONGRATULATIONS to our Gulf Coast Records Blues Music Award Winners!\n\n​\n\n★ MIKE ZITO - Blues Rock Artist and Blues Rock Album of the Year\n\n★ ALBERT CASTIGLIA - \"Blood Brothers\" - Blues Rock Album\n\n★ JASON RICCI - Instrumentalist Harmonica\n\n​\n\n✪ Gulf Coast Records Announces the Signing of Powerhouse Blues/Soul Singer Lara Price and the Release of Her Label Debut, Half & Half on June 21st ✪\n\nMike Zito, president of Gulf Coast Records, announces the signing of powerhouse blues and soul singer Lara Price and the upcoming June 21st release of her label debut album, Half & Half, on both CD and vinyl formats, with digital pre-orders starting on May 3rd and CD pre-orders now available at laraprice.com\n\n​\n\nThe album’s first single, “We’re Still Friends” (featuring Mike Zito) will be released on May 17, to be followed by “Rain” on June 7th. Now based in Austin, Texas, Lara Price recorded the album partly in Texas and partly in the San Francisco Bay Area, hence its title.\n\n​\n\n“Half & Half was a way for me to honor the San Francisco Bay Area music family, because without them I wouldn’t be able to keep up in this Austin music scene,” said Lara Price. “The other ‘half’ is a representation of what I have learned so far, as I have soaked up eight years- worth of Austin music. I feel like I am JUST scratching the service as to what the Austin music scene is about and I look forward to putting that experience on my next album. Technically, the album was recorded 60% in Texas 40% in California with 22 musicians and three studios in two states,” she added about the recording sessions.\n\n​\n\n“Lara Price has been a fantastic artist for years,” said Mike Zito in announcing her signing. “She’s so deserving of a national audience. Her voice is soulful and righteous and I expect our fans to fall in love with her.”\n\n“I don’t think words can express how excited I am to be joining the GCR family,” stated Lara Price. “The caliber of musicianship on this label is humbling, and I look forward to rising to the level. Thank you, GRC for the much needed wind in my sails. See you at the gig!”\n\nAbout Lara Price:\n\nAbandoned at birth, Lara Price became a part of the controversial Operation Baby Lift, the mass evacuation of orphans from South Vietnam to the United States. Her journey out of Vietnam to her new home was nothing short of a miracle, as 90 percent of the orphaned babies did not survive. Lara Price is a survivor.\n\n​\n\nLara arrived in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1997 to pursue her dream of singing in a band. The journey of Lara’s career includes tours across the United States, China, multiple bands, one DVD, seven CDs that Lara Price has produced, co-written, and on which she has played multiple instruments. Her sixth CD,\n\nI Mean Business, was exactly that, earning her a Best Soul/Blues Female Artist nomination for 2017 by the Blues Foundation. Lara’s journey continued in Austin, where she released on her seventh album, Makin’ Lemonade Lara Price LIVE from ATX.\n\nWhat the critics have said about Lara Price:\n\n“The proof is in the performance. Price's vocal instrument is as strong as it is sensual, confident in covering the breadth of material in her songbook.”- San Francisco Chronicle, 2003\n\n“Lara Price…combines Gladys Knight’s sophistication with Mavis Staple Grit” - Boston Globe , November, 2015\n\n“Strong performances mark Lara Price as a force in the soul blues arena!” - Blues Blast Magazine, March 2016\n\n“If you enjoy the soul blues stylings of women like Trudy Lynn, Etta James, and Etta Jones, you’ll find plenty to latch onto with Price’s I Mean Business.” - Blues Revue, March, 2016\n\nFemale Soul Blues Artist Nomination alongside Mavis Staples and Bettye LaVette -- Blues Foundation, 2017\n\nHalf & Half Track Listing and Credits:\n\nRecorded and/or Mixed: 601 Studio / Austin, Texas - Mike Ingber, Eric Harrison; King Electric Studios / Austin, Texas - Rocky Moon (recorded); Greaseland Music Creation House - Kid Andersen (recorded, mixed) DM2 Audio - Dave Bauer - Mix\n\nProducer: Kid Andersen & Lara Price\n\nProducers - \"The Way Love Goes\": Mike Ingber, Eric Harrison, Lara Price\n\n​\n\nSong Titles:\n\nWe’re Still Friends ft.

The Wicked Lo-Down is comprised of Nick David - Vocals/Harmonica; Paul Size – Guitar; Jeffrey Berg – Guitar/ Background Vocals; Brad Hallen – Bass; and Nick Toscano – Drums. Out of Line was produced by The Wicked Lo-Down and recorded, mixed and mastered by Jeffrey Berg at Walking Stick Studios, Auburn Mass. Pre-order The Wicked Lo-Down album here: https://www.wickedld.com/.\n\n“Nick David has a blues and rock ‘n’ roll sound that’s deep and soulful,” said Gulf Coast label head Mike Zito in making the announcement. “His singing, writing, and harp playing are old school, yet fresh all at once. The Wicked Lo-Down is a fantastic group behind Nick. Paul Size on guitar is legendary in Texas Blues. Together they bring an exciting new album to the genre and Gulf Coast Records.”\n\n“The Wicked Lo-Down couldn’t be more excited to sign with Gulf Coast Records,” said lead singer Nick David. “We are honored knowing that Mike Zito sees something in us and our music that is worth putting some muscle behind. Gulf Coast is the perfect label for the music that we are creating and we look forward to a long and fruitful relationship with them.”\n\nFormed in 2020 just before the Covid lockdown by guitar giant Paul Size (The Red Devils, Mick Jagger, Sugar Ray & the Bluetones) and powerhouse blues belter Nick David (Mr. Nick & the Dirty Tricks, Queen City Kings), The Wicked Lo-Down blends raw Texas blues and hard hitting Northeast R&B into their own completely original house rockin' sound. Their debut album, We Hot, received critical acclaim from some of the biggest names in the blues world and beyond. Consisting of ten well crafted, barn burners, We Hot established The Wicked Lo-Down as a true force to be reckoned- with and left no doubt that from Austin to Boston is how they roll.\n\nOut of Line, the second record from The Wicked Lo-Down, includes 11 sure-fire originals and two rock solid, unexpected covers: Hound Dog Taylor’s “Just Can’t Make It;” and a bluesified take on “Toxic,” which was originally done by pop princess Britney Spears and the band proceeds to turn completely inside-out. “With ‘Toxic,’ The Wicked Lo-Down have re-crafted this interesting piece of bubble gum pop into a sinister, fierce, rockin’ Texas shuffle with help from the great Monster Mike Welch on guitar,” declares Nick David.\n\nAs with their previous release, the focal point of Out of Line is on the songs. Highlighting the songwriting of Berg, David and Size, the band once again solidifies its place by continuing to carve out a lane all its own, making the new disc a must-listen for hard core fans of bands like The Red Devils and the original Fabulous Thunderbirds.\n\nAbout “The Wildest One” track, Nick David says: “The Wildest One (Lester’s Boogie)” was written as a tribute to the great Lester Butler. The head riff was something that popped into the mind of long time bandmate Paul Size as something that reminded him intensely of Lester and the rest of the song was built around that. The lyrics, written by Nick David reference the life & music of Lester, including song titles from the Red Devils and 13 records.\n\nMEET THE BAND\n\n​\n\nNick David: For the last 25 years, dynamo Blues shouter, unorthodox harmonica ace and extraordinary stage presence Nick David has been entertaining audiences in New England and around the world. Nick spent 12 years fronting the widely regarded Mr. Nick & the Dirty Tricks, which included the Billboard charted album, Oh Wow, produced by the legendary Curtis Salgado. Nick has performed and recorded with many notable musicians, including; Luther “Guitar Junior” Johnson, The Holmes Brothers, John Popper, Otis Grand, Jerry Portnoy, Duke Robillard, Ronnie Earl, Curtis Salgado, Big Bill Morganfield, Jason Ricci, James Harman, The Nighthawks, Rick Estrin and Junior Watson, to name a few.\n\nPaul Size: For the last 40 years, Paul Size has been the pure embodiment of blistering Texas Blues guitar. Having grown up and made his bones in Texas amongst modern day Blues royalty like Anson Funderburgh & the Rockets, The Fabulous Thunderbirds and SRV, it is no surprise that he turned out to be the juggernaut that he is today.

Zito recorded the new album in September at Sunset Sound Studios in Hollywood, California, with Joe Bonamassa and Josh Smith producing. Both Bonamassa and Smith were involved in the production of Blood Brothers, the critically-acclaimed album Zito recorded with fellow label guitarist Albert Castiglia, which topped both the Billboard and iTunes blues charts after its release in March, 2023. Mike’s first single, “Life is Hard,” the album’s title track, will drop on January 12th.\n\n​\n\n“Life Is Hard is a complete work of art for me,” says Mike Zito about the new disc. “I believe this is the best album I’ve ever made in my life. My wife Laura and I planned this idea of pouring my heart out in music after her death from cancer. Joe, Josh and the incredible musicians were fully aware of the task at hand. They brought a lot of emotion to the music. I am so proud of this album and I know Laura would be proud as well.”\n\n​\n\nThe even-dozen tracks on Life Is Hard include not only several Mike Zito originals, but also his takes on a wide variety of blues songs written by such contemporaries as Tinsley Ellis, Walter Trout, Tab Benoit and Fred James. Sprinkled in are covers from a diverse assortment of blues/roots music icons, including Little Milton (“Lonely Man”), Stevie Wonder (“Have a Talk with God”) and Reverend Gary Davis (“Death Don’t Have No Mercy”), plus the outside-the-box blues-worthy rendering of the Guess Who classic, “These Eyes.”\n\nMike Zito - Life Is Hard\n\nTrack Listing and Credits\n\nProduced by Joe Bonamassa and Josh Smith\n\nMixed by Alan Hertz; Engineered by Austin Atwood; Asst.

This is Burt’s second album for Gulf Coast Records, which released his Stone Crazy CD in October, 2020.\n\nThank You, Brother Bill: A Tribute to Bill Withers was recorded at The Sound Box Recording Studio, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, by engineers Richard Shultz and Jon Limmer, with assistant engineers Daren Barker, Antonio Chalmers and Isaiah Holtz. The mixing and mastering was done by David Ferrell at Dockside Studios in New Orleans.\n\n\"Kevin Burt has been a force for years and is finally getting the International recognition he so deeply deserves,” says Gulf Coast Records founder Mike Zito. “His voice is commanding and soulful and his songs are honest and from the heart. On his new album, Kevin resonates his soul with the music of Bill Withers. They have a connection deeper than their voices. This album is a must for all Bill Withers fans and will bring Kevin Burt to the masses.\"\n\n“Listening to Bill Withers tell a story or sing a song for me is one and the same,” adds Kevin Burt. “It instantly attaches itself to my soul. Mr. Withers told me in a roughly two-hour conversation we had many things that (pardon the pun) lean on today. One of those nuggets of insight was to ‘tell the stories that make me feel most vulnerable, that’s what people connect with.’ His story relates to my story. His songs relate to different points in time in my life like no other as an artist. I hope to someday have an impact on someone else’s world the way Mr. Withers has had an impact on mine. I hope that you enjoy the stories/songs as much as I have over the years. These are some of my favorites, not just because of the words or the story, but because of their attachment to my own personal story, I hope that I did the songs justice. Big love, Brother Bill Withers, and big love to you all.”\n\nFor nearly 30 years, Kevin Burt has been electrifying audiences throughout the Midwest, dispelling the myth that true blues has no roots in Iowa. His soul-inspired presentation is unique, which consistently gets him compared to a range of artists like Bill Withers and Aaron Neville, with the ability to build an audience rapport that has been compared to B.B. King.\n\nKevin is a self-taught musician (vocals, harmonica, and guitar) whose smooth, warm vocal presentation sets a mood of relaxed exhilaration, with a welcome mixture of serious music and infectious humor that audiences of all ages seem to enjoy. His voice and presence are powerful. His unique delivery ranges from the sweetest, fullest, juiciest come-on to the most playful growl. Most people have been introduced to him as a one-of-a-kind solo performer; however, he is a remarkable entertainer and frontman with his band, Kevin Burt & Big Medicine, with featured guitarist Ken Valdez, who is, himself, a masterful and revered musician in the Minneapolis music scene. The rhythm section of Eric Douglas (drums) and the incomparable Scot Sutherland (bass) provide a solid foundation for a soulful, funky, blues experience. When you have the Blues, Kevin Burt and Big Medicine might not cure you, but they will make you feel better!\n\nOver the years, Kevin Burt has won numerous awards and played many festivals, both solo and with his band. Competing with 235 bands & solo/duo acts from around the world, he absolutely crushed it at the Blues Foundation’s 34th International Blues Challenge (IBC) in 2018, taking home top honors in three categories: first place in the Solo/Duo category; the Cigar Box Guitar Award recognizing him as the best guitar player in the Solo/Duo category; and the Lee Oskar Award for Best Harmonica Player. In 2019, Kevin was nominated for a Blues Music Award for his debut album, Heartland and Soul (Best Emerging Artist Album) and was inducted into the Iowa Blues Hall of Fame. In 2020, his Gulf Coast Records debut recording, Stone Crazy, was nominated in four categories for The Independent Blues Awards: Best Soul/Blues Album, Song (“Stone Crazy”) and Vocalist, as well as a nomination for Gateway Artist of the Year. He was also nominated for Best Soul/Blues album for the Blues Blast Awards, as well as the Artist on the Rise Award. Additionally, he was awarded in 2021 the Bobby Rush Lifetime Achievement in Entertainment by the Blues Foundation. That year he was also nominated for Acoustic Artist of the Year at the Blues Music Awards.\n\nALBUM CREDITS AND TRACK-LISTING\n\nKevin Burt - Guitar, Harmonica, Lead Vocals\n\nScot Sutherland - Bass\n\nKen Valdez - Lead/Rhythm Guitar, Background Vocals\n\nEric Douglas - Drums/Percussion\n\nTracks:\n\nWho is He (and What is He to You)?\n\nKissing My Love\n\nWorld Keeps Going Round and Round\n\nJust the Two of Us\n\nI’m Her Daddy\n\nAin’t No Sunshine\n\nLean On Me\n\nLet Us Love\n\nAnother Day To Run\n\nGrandma’s Hands\n\nThe Same Love That Made Me Laugh\n\nHope She’ll Be Happier\n\nThank You Brother Bill - written by Kevin Burt\n\nPhoto by: Delaney Burt\n\n✪ 𝐆𝐔𝐋𝐅 𝐂𝐎𝐀𝐒𝐓 𝐑𝐄𝐂𝐎𝐑𝐃𝐒 ANNOUNCES NOVEMBER 17 RELEASE DATE FOR\n\nBLOOD BROTHERS: LIVE IN CANADA FROM BLUES MUSIC\n\nAWARD-WINNERS MIKE ZITO AND ALBERT CASTIGLIA ✪\n\nGulf Coast Records is proud to announce the November 17 release of Blood Brothers Live in Canada, an album which perfectly captures all the excitement and blues/rock energy created by the dynamic duo of guitarists Mike Zito and Albert Castiglia on their recent Blood Brothers Tour, featured in an intimate setting that transports listeners to front row seats for all the action. Blood Brothers Live in Canada was recorded at Blue Frog Studios, White Rock, British Columbia, Canada, on May 19 and 20, 2023. The new album was produced by Mike Zito and mastered by Kid Andersen.\n\n​\n\n“Our shows in White Rock were full of energy and fire,” Mike Zito says about the recording. “Blue Frog Studios set an exceptional vibe for the task at hand. Albert and the band were seriously on that night; I felt really good about it.” Adds Albert Castiglia: “The stars were aligned that night in White Rock: the perfect room, perfect acoustics, an amazing audience and incendiary playing by everyone in the band. We’ve had a lot of shows like that, but very few have been captured on tape. It had to be shared with the world. It was a night to remember!”\n\nThe band for those nights consisted of Mike Zito - vocals/guitars; Albert Castiglia - vocals/guitars; Doug Byrkit - bass guitar; Matt Johnson - drums/percussion; Ephraim Lowell - drums/percussion; andLewis Stephens - piano/organ.\n\nThe track listing for Blood Brothers Live in Canada album includes 10 live versions of songs that were originally included on the duo’s Blood Brothers studio album released to great international critical acclaim on Gulf Coast Records. That disc was produced by Joe Bonamassa and Josh Smith and proceeded to top both the Billboard and iTunes blues charts after its release in March, 2023. Augmenting those tracks are searing live covers of Zito’s “Gone to Texas,” the title track of his 2013 CD released on Ruf Records; and a blistering take on the Neil Young Classic, “Rockin’ in the Free World,” which closes the new album out in grand style.\n\nBLOOD BROTHERS: LIVE IN CANADA\n\nTrack Listing and Songwriting Credits\n\n​\n\n1.

We both agreed I needed to continue to make new music and try and put some of these hard earned emotions to music. Both Joe and Josh understand my goal and I expect it to be a rocking tear jerker.”\n\n​\n\nPhoto by: Norma Touchette\n\nMike Zito’s last Gulf Coast solo album, the double live set, Blues for the Southside (released Feb. 2022), debuted at number one on the Billboard Blues Chart. Recorded in November, 2021, at the Old Rock House in St. Louis, Missouri, and produced by Zito, Blues for the Southside captured Mike (guitar and vocals) and his stellar band in full fury: Matthew Johnson - vocals/drums; Lewis Stephens - piano/organ; Doug Byrkit – vocals/ bass, with special guests including label mate guitarists Tony Campanella and Dave Kalz, plus guitar wizard Eric Gales.\n\n​\n\nZito’s last studio album, Resurrection (released July, 2021), contained 11 tracks that not only showcased his strengths as a composer, but also as an interpreter of other compositions, with scintillating and powerful takes on tunes from JJ Cale (“I’ll Make Love To You”), Eric Clapton (“Presence of the Lord”) and Willie Dixon (“Evil”). Mike won the 2022 Blues Music Award for “Blues Rock Album” for Resurrection.\n\n​​\n\nThe Blood Brothers disc was one of the most-anticipated albums of 2023, with its sales and critical response taking both Zito and Castiglia to new heights in the blues/roots music world, and its ongoing lengthy tour became one of the hottest tickets on the club and festival circuit. The album generated extensive radio airplay around the world, accompanied by universal rave reviews: “…a terrific collaboration.” – American Songwriter; “The universe wants what it wants and, right now, it wants this. Miss it and miss out.” – Rock & Blues Muse; “There was big anticipation that this album would be one of those where one plus one equals better than two. And it does.” – Blues Music Magazine\n\n✪ HARMONICA MASTER JASON RICCI AND THE BAD KIND GET\n\nBEHIND THE VEIL ON DEBUT GULF COAST RECORDS ALBUM\n\nCOMING SEPTEMBER 29th ✪\n\nGulf Coast Records announces a September 29th release date for Behind the Veil, the solo label debut from New Orleans-based harmonica master Jason Ricci and his band, The Bad Kind.

Singer Kaitlin Dibble has been singing this number for a few years and the wheels in my mind started turning on how to capture it the way I heard so many tunes on Bob Murret's WWOZ show. I love the New Orleans R&B feel and I really think we captured it here thanks to Tony Daigle, Kid Andersen and the band, of course. The whole reason we recorded this CD live in one room was centered around this number.”\n\n“St James Infirmary” - “This old standard is almost the ‘Mustang Sally’ of New Orleans music so if I didn't think we had something really special here I would have never let it on stage - much more this record.”\n\n“Why Don’t We Sleep On It” - “Kate and I were having a rare argument and the band was in need of some more music. So I sat down to write a tune about how much better I would be doing without her and then kept hearing her voice or my own telling me the truth or her side... So I wrote both our parts; she loved it; we made up and had this fun duet. “\n\n𝐍𝐄𝐖 𝐒𝐈𝐍𝐆𝐋𝐄/𝐕𝐈𝐃𝐄𝐎: MOTORCYCLE MAMA from Popa Chubby's upcoming album \"Popa Chubby and the Beast Band Live from G.

Bluey’s Juke Joint NYC, the label debut live double-CD set from New York City-based blues guitar slinger Popa Chubby (aka “The Beast from the East”). The album’s first single, “Motorcycle Mama,” and its accompanying video will both be available on July 21, as will the album’s digital pre-order.\n\n​\n\nThe new album was recorded at G. Bluey’s Juke Joint in Long Island City, New York, on October 24 and 25, 2022, and features Popa Chubby (guitar and vocals), backed by his all-star “Beast Band,” which consists of Mike Merritt - bass (Conan O’Brien, Billy Gibbons); Mike DiMeo - keyboards (Johnny Winter, Tommy James); and Stefano Giudici - drums.\n\n​\n\n“This record is a reunion in a lot of ways,” stated Popa Chubby. “Rejoining with my long-time ally and bassist extraordinaire Mike Merritt and recording in my old Manny’s Car Wash engineer Glen Forrest’s studio. The icing on the cake was Mike Dimeo on keys. Add the Centurion Stefano Giudici on drums and you’ve got some heavy blues rock! It’s a live best of for the ages!”\n\n​“In the early ‘90s, Popa Chubby was the house band at New York City’s Manny’s Car Wash,” says the man, himself. “I hosted the jam every Sunday that saw everyone from the Allman Brothers, Stephen Stills, Joe Sample, Odetta and many more pass through. The apprentice Soundman was Glen Forrest. I had a small recording studio in the West Village and I hired Glen to work for me. He proved himself beyond my expectations and with great vision and perseverance set out to create the ultimate recording environment. He landed in Long Island City, New York, where he holds court over three floors of a building which house the studio, lounges, art galleries and warehouse. We recorded the record there because it gave us a great vibe, sound and an intimate live in the studio setting.”\n\n​\n\nBorn Ted Horowitz, Popa Chubby is a long-time, New York City veteran blues rocker, who also produced and mixed his upcoming new album. He’s been hard-rocking the blues in his fierce and soulful way for more than 35 years. Over the course of his career, he has been a force to be reckoned with on the guitar, and his tempestuous, soulful playing has never been more powerful. An imposing figure with a shaven head, tattooed arms, a goatee and a performance style he describes as “the Stooges meets Buddy Guy, Motörhead meets Muddy Waters and Jimi Hendrix meets Robert Johnson,” Popa Chubby is an endearing character who has become one of the genre’s most popular figures.\n\nHis career has always been about moving forward and carving a place for himself in the imposing terrain of the music business, overcoming odds to continue growing and maturing as a creative force. He has built a constantly increasing base of fans across the world, where in many territories he is a star. A native New Yorker, his first gigs were in the NYC punk scene as a guitarist for what he reflects was a \"crazy Japanese special effects performance artist in a kimono called ‘Screaming Mad George,’ who had a horror-movie inspired show.” Right from the start, he was immersed in rock ‘n’ roll as theater, and learned from George and others playing CBGB’s at the time that included the Ramones, the Cramps, Richard Hell, whose band -the Voidoids - he joined, that rock ‘n’ roll should be dangerous. He reflects, \"Musicians like the Ramones and the Sex Pistols weren’t just bands. They were a threat to society.\"\n\nThe blues, however, was the foundation of his playing style. He recalls, \"Since I’d grown up on Hendrix, Cream and Led Zeppelin, when I started playing blues in New York clubs I understood that the blues should be dangerous, too. It wasn’t just from playing in punk bands. Howlin’ Wolf and Muddy Waters were dangerous men. They’d cut or shoot you if they thought it was necessary, and Little Walter packed a gun and wouldn’t hesitate to use it. That danger is a real part of the blues and I keep it alive in my music.”\n\nPOPA CHUBBY AND THE BEAST BAND LIVE AT G. BLUEY’S JUKE JOINT NYC\n\nCD1\n\n1. MOTORCYCLE MAMA (6:51) - Neil Young\n\n2.

Onofre\n\nHi, this is Mike and Laura Zito.\n\nMost of you know, my wife Laura was diagnosed with Stage 4 Pancreatic Metastatic Cancer in July of 2022. She was given 9-12 months to live at that time. Laura decided she would fight with everything she had to beat the odds, and she did. But now treatment has stopped working and she will begin hospice at home. She's been given months to live, but she will fight for as much time as possible. We have been offered support the past year but with me working full time we felt it wasn't necessary. Now I will stop working and playing music and come home to spend this time with my life partner and our family. We will need help with our monthly bills, extra medical expenses, and giving Laura the BEST summer of her life! Anything you can give will be of so much help to our family. Our priorities with assistance will be monthly bills, medical costs, flying in all of our children to spend time with us, bringing Laura to the beach and wherever she wants to go, and finally passing on any monies to our daughters in Laura's name after she is gone for their college fund. We've put this off for the past year, but now is the time we can use any support. Thank you so much for always loving our family. Laura is a one-of-a-kind person with a heart of gold, she deserves all the love in the world.\n\nhttps://gofund.me/fd8faf15\n\n\"BLOOD BROTHERS\"\n\nFEATURING MIKE ZITO & ALBERT CASTIGLIA\n\nNOW AVAILABLE ON VINYL\n\n✪ 𝐆𝐔𝐋𝐅 𝐂𝐎𝐀𝐒𝐓 𝐑𝐄𝐂𝐎𝐑𝐃𝐒 𝐒𝐈𝐆𝐍𝐒 𝐓𝐄𝐗𝐀𝐒-𝐁𝐀𝐒𝐄𝐃 𝐁𝐋𝐔𝐄𝐒 𝐑𝐎𝐂𝐊 𝐁𝐀𝐍𝐃\n\n𝐎𝐋𝐄 𝐋𝐎𝐍𝐄𝐒𝐎𝐌𝐄 𝐀𝐍𝐃 𝐖𝐈𝐋𝐋 𝐑𝐄𝐋𝐄𝐀𝐒𝐄 𝐓𝐇𝐄𝐈𝐑 𝐋𝐀𝐁𝐄𝐋 𝐃𝐄𝐁𝐔𝐓 𝐀𝐋𝐁𝐔𝐌,\n\n𝐓𝐄𝐉𝐀𝐒 𝐌𝐎𝐓𝐄𝐋, 𝐎𝐍 𝐉𝐔𝐋𝐘 𝟏𝟒 ✪\n\nGulf Coast Records announces the signing of five-piece south Texas-based blues/rock band, Ole Lonesome, and will release the group’s label debut album, Tejas Motel, on July 14.\n\nBorn in the oil swamps of Beaumont, Texas, and raised on the blues, Ole Lonesome is a blue collar swamp rock band with its ear tuned to the past and boots to the future. With their love of tone and electric live performances, Zachary Feemster (vocals and guitar), J. Wesley Hardin (bass), Gregory Mosley (keys), Jimmy Devers (drums), and Greg Achord (guitar) look to recreate the colors of decades gone and take their music through the stratosphere. Ole Lonesome joined label head/co-producer Mike Zito at Dockside Studio in Maurice, Louisiana, to record the new album.\n\n“After a gig in Deep Ellum, something caught my eye just outside the city off of the highway, an old sign that read ‘Tejas Motel,” explains Zachary Feemster about the album’s title origin. “Instantly, I knew this was my inspiration for the album and I had to describe this place with the titles and lyrics. As we started writing, the songs were coming effortlessly and each one was becoming a player in the story of Tejas Motel. The riffs were tuff, the vibe was gritty, and they were sitting comfortably in that grungy motel chair. When you listen to the title track, I think you’ll really grasp the vision we were trying to convey. I wouldn’t necessarily call it a concept album, but I can definitely say that if each song was a character, they would be well acquainted with each other. The energy between the songs strengthens the vision and brings to life the story of Tejas Motel.”\n\n\"I have known Zach Feemster for 20 years,” said Mike Zito in announcing the signing. “He toured with me and my band in 2011 for my Greyhound album. This group he has put together is a serious rock ‘n’ roll blues machine. They have the fire of Southeast Texas in their hearts and the gritty sound to prove it. This album will be a big sound on the Roots/Blues scene - it's modern yet old school at the same time. A true band that plays with energy and purpose, and I am super proud to have Ole Lonesome on GCR.\"\n\n“We are beyond ecstatic to announce the upcoming release of our debut album on Gulf Coast Records,” said Zachary Feemster, “and honored to have collaborated with some big names like Mike Zito and Kid Andersen. Recording at Dockside Studio was such an awesome experience for us all, and we are excited to share Tejas Motel with our fans and the world.”\n\nTRACK LISTING AND CREDITS\n\nAll songs written by Zachary Feemster, J.

It features an all-star band including legendary bassist and two-time Grammy winner Jerry Jemmott (Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett, Gregg Allman).\n\n“I have been a fan of Monster Mike Welch for 25 plus years,” said Gulf Coast head Mike Zito in making the announcement. “He is one of the absolute finest blues artists/guitarists of our time and I am thrilled to be working with him. I am hopeful for some free guitar lessons.”\n\nWelch, who battled the COVID-19 demon for over a year-and-a-half, had this to say about his signing and the recording of Nothing But Time: “At its worst, Long Covid was completely debilitating, and I spent most of 2022 genuinely unsure whether I’d be able to play music full time ever again. Kid Andersen and Mike Zito inspired me to take a leap of faith and make a new start; they both had my back and gave me the support and freedom to make the most personal record of my career.”\n\nWith almost three decades of touring and recording under his belt, guitarist Monster Mike Welch is a seasoned veteran of the international blues scene. Given the nickname “Monster Mike” by actor/”Blues Brother” Dan Aykroyd at the tender age of 13, Welch has since carved out a niche as a highly accomplished and in-demand guitarist. To date, Welch has released several albums under his own name and in 2001, he joined the ranks of one of New England’s most beloved blues institutions, Sugar Ray and the Bluetones, where he stayed until 2017, recording five albums and racking up multiple Blues Music Award nominations with the band in that time. In addition, Welch has recorded with Shemekia Copeland, Ronnie Earl, Danielle Nicole, Duke Robillard, Johnny Winter, Victor Wainwright, Nick Moss, the Mannish Boys and Sugaray Rayford, among others. Welch left the Bluetones in 2017 to focus on his partnership with Mike Ledbetter, which led to seven Blues Music Award nominations and the formation of the Welch Ledbetter Connection within the first year. They won Best Traditional album in 2018, and Mike won the BMA for Guitar (and Band ) in 2019. Welch received three consecutive Blues Music Award nominations by the Blues Foundation for Instrumentalist-Guitar beginning in 2016, a Boston Music Award for Best Blues Act, and is an inductee of the Rhode Island Music Hall of Fame. In 2023, Monster Mike Welch has embarked on the next phase of his career with his signing to Gulf Coast Records to make new music.\n\nVocal/Guitar: Monster Mike Welch\n\nBass: Jerry Jemmott (1, 3, 4, 7, 13); Kid Andersen (2, 5, 6, 8-12)\n\nPiano: Bob Welsh\n\nOrgan/Misc.

Onofre\n\npopachubby.com\n\nGulf Coast Records announces the signing of New York City-based blues guitar slinger Popa Chubby (aka “The Beast from the East”) and will release his label debut live double-CD in the Fall of 2023.\n\n“I remember the first time I heard Popa Chubby on the radio in the 1990s in St. Louis on KSHE-95; it blew me away,!” said Gulf Coast main man Mike Zito in making the announcement. “I am so excited to be working with my hero, Popa Chubby. This record will knock your frigging socks off!!”\n\n“I’ve been a fan of Mike Zito for a decade or more,” said Popa Chubby.” I watched him grow Gulf Coast from scratch and it impressed me a lot. When I recorded this double-live record I contacted Mike about aligning our energies. The result can only be spectacular.”\n\nThe new album was recorded at G Bluey’s Juke Joint in Long Island City, New York, on October 24 and 25, 2022, and features Popa Chubby (guitar and vocals), backed by his all-star “Beast Band,” which consists of Mike Merritt - bass (Conan O’Brien, Billy Gibbons); Mike Dimeo - keyboards (Johnny Winter, Tommy James); and Stefano Giudici - drums.\n\n“This record is a reunion in a lot of ways,” stated Popa Chubby. “Rejoining with my long-time ally and bassist extraordinaire Mike Merritt and recording in my old Manny’s Car Wash engineer Glen Forrest’s studio. The icing on the cake was Mike Dimeo on keys. Add the Centurion Stefano Giudici on drums and you’ve got some heavy blues rock! A live best of for the ages!”\n\nBorn Ted Horowitz, Popa Chubby is a long-time, New York City veteran blues rocker, who also produced and mixed his upcoming new album. He’s been hard-rocking the blues in his fierce and soulful way for more than 35 years. Over the course of his career, he has been a force to be reckoned with on the guitar, and his tempestuous, soulful playing has never been more powerful. An imposing figure with a shaven head, tattooed arms, a goatee and a performance style he describes as “the Stooges meets Buddy Guy, Motörhead meets Muddy Waters and Jimi Hendrix meets Robert Johnson,” Popa Chubby is an endearing character who has become one of the genre’s most popular figures.\n\nHis career has always been about moving forward and carving a place for himself in the imposing terrain of the music business, overcoming odds to continue growing and maturing as a creative force. He has built a constantly increasing base of fans across the world, where in many territories he is a star. A native New Yorker, his first gigs were in the NYC punk scene as a guitarist for what he reflects was a \"crazy Japanese special effects performance artist in a kimono called ‘Screaming Mad George,’ who had a horror-movie inspired show.” Right from the start, he was immersed in rock ‘n’ roll as theater, and learned from George and others playing CBGB’s at the time that included the Ramones, the Cramps, Richard Hell, whose band -the Voidoids - he joined, that rock ‘n’ roll should be dangerous. He reflects, \"Musicians like the Ramones and the Sex Pistols weren’t just bands. They were a threat to society.\"\n\nThe blues, however, was the foundation of his playing style. He recalls, \"Since I’d grown up on Hendrix, Cream and Led Zeppelin, when I started playing blues in New York clubs I understood that the blues should be dangerous, too. It wasn’t just from playing in punk bands. Howlin’ Wolf and Muddy Waters were dangerous men. They’d cut or shoot you if they thought it was necessary, and Little Walter packed a gun and wouldn’t hesitate to use it. That danger is a real part of the blues and I keep it alive in my music.”\n\nPopa Chubby is his own man. \"I’m living in a wild time, and that is where the inspiration is drawn from. There are my issues, but the picture is much bigger than me and my situation. Everything is breaking down in the world. The lines are being redefined. We all need something.”\n\n✪ Blues Guitar Great Joanna Connor Brings Best of Me to Gulf Coast Records Debut Album, Releasing June 9th ✪\n\nhttps://www.joannaconnorwreckingcrew.com\n\nGulf Coast Records announces a June 9th release date for Best of Me, the label debut from acclaimed Chicago blues guitar great Joanna Connor. Joining Joanna (guitar and vocals) on the recording is her regular “Wrecking Crew” touring band: Shaun Gotti Calloway – bass; Dan Souvigny – guitar and keys; Curtis Moore Jr. – keys; and Jason J Roc Edwards - drums and vocals. Special guests include labelmates Eric Demmer – saxophone and Jason Ricci: - harmonica; and guitarists Joe Bonamassa, Josh Smith, Gary Hoey and Gulf Coast president Mike Zito: guitar; David Abbruzzese on drums and the Grooveline Horns. Best of Me was produced by Shaun Gotti Calloway, Jason J Roc Edwards, and Joanna Connor, and recorded at Studio2424 in Chicago.\n\n“There are musicians that play together and may do it extremely well,” Joanna said about the Best of Me recording sessions. “Then, there are musicians that move as one, that share moments of creating music that is mystically telepathic. The group of musicians we assembled here created a free-flowing and fiery blend of soul, rock, funk and country, all rooted in the blues. Making this record with the go ahead from Mike Zito and Gulf Coast Records to have free reign was uplifting and inspiring. This recording definitely brought out the’ best of me,’ and solidified my band as a force to be reckoned with. Guitar power and nuance is evident on this record but so are convincing vocals, soul-stirring keyboard work, tighter than tight horns and a rhythm section that propels and compliments each song. The album touches on my maturing as a woman, facing mortality with grace and thanks, celebrating love won, love lost, lust and passion, the pain and pleasure of having this human experience. I hope the listener enjoys this record as much as we had making it.”\n\nJoanna Connor – \"Best of Me\" Tracks\n\n1. House Rules - Shaun Calloway\n\n2.

On larger shows, the band is joined by Wayne Sharp on B3 organ and the Backtrack Angels on backing vocals. These seasoned musicians combined have garnered a Grammy Award, two Blues Music Awards, a Keeping the Blues Alive Award, and three Tampa Bay Music Awards for “Best Blues Band. “\n\n​\n\n“I have been a friend and fan of Sonny Charles for years,” says Gulf Coast Records founder Mike Zito in announcing the signing. “His band has been a staple in the Florida Blues scene for 40 years. This live album is a wonderful culmination of his great band and love for the music.”\n\n“A Day by The Bay captures the energy and excitement of the band performing live at a major festival,” adds Sonny Charles. “Lots of guitar, harp and B3 organ on these original tunes to please Blues music fans. We think blues music is best when it’s experienced live. This album represents our decades of performing together, and the band’s longevity is reflected in the strong guitar, harp and B3 organ that really shine here. “\n\nbacktrackbluesband.com/\n\nThe Backtrack Blues Band was formed in St Petersburg, Florida in 1980, and is one of the longest-running blues bands in America.

The duo concluded a highly-successful string of “Blood Brothers” shows in the spring/summer of 2022 with new tour dates already announced beginning in February and running through the summer, culminating with a special appearance at the Big Blues Bender in Las Vegas in September. Blood Brothers was produced by Joe Bonamassa and Josh Smith and recorded at Dockside Studio in Maurice, Louisiana. “Sweet Mama,” the album’s first single/video, drops February 10th.\n\n\"This album was a blast to make and I am even more excited to take this music out on the road and perform for the people,” says Mike Zito. “It's just a bit more complex with an overall band dynamic that I think sets apart from what Albert and I normally do.\"\n\n“The making of this album was a ‘brotherhood’ in every sense of the word,” adds Albert Castiglia. “The production team of Josh Smith and Joe Bonamassa, along with Mike and I created something incredibly special. I hope our fans enjoy this collaboration as much as we did.”\n\nMike Zito and Albert Castiglia are true “Blood Brothers” in life and in the music they create both individually and collectively, joining forces in a collaborative effort of songwriting and performances to create a total listening experience greater than the sum of its parts. Added to that process are the talents of producers Joe Bonamassa and Josh Smith, who brought fresh ideas to the recording sessions, pushing Mike and Albert creatively and musically to present their best work to date.\n\n“Mike and Albert have a special chemistry together when they plug in and play that few have. They finish each other's sentences musically,” award-winning guitarist Joe Bonamassa said about the sessions. “Great tunes, great people, great hang! What's not to like? It was an honor to be involved in this project.\"\n\nFor the Blood Brothers album, Mike Zito: vocals/guitars; Albert Castiglia: vocals/guitars – brought together their two powerhouse bands, featuring Matt Johnson: drums; Ephraim Lowell: drums; Doug Byrkit: bass; Lewis Stephens: piano/organ. Josh Smith provided his additional talents on guitar to the sound, and Joe Bonamassa stepped up to be featured on the new song, “A Thousand Heartaches.”\n\n\"Mike Zito and Albert Castiglia have done something special,” added co-producer Josh Smith. “They have both found their musical confidante. Most solo artists never even look - let alone find - theirs. They have brought together a real ‘band’ using members of each's solo acts. The sum of all these parts added with a tremendous effort to both write and perform the strongest record of their respective careers has paid off in a special album. Blood Brothers indeed! Joe and I are proud that these brothers trusted our partnership to produce this special album!\"\n\nOf the many insights into the songs on Blood Brothers, Mike Zito offered these two about “‘In My Soul’ and “One Step Ahead of the Blues”: “In the summer of 2022, my wife Laura was diagnosed with cancer. It was a surreal shock. Albert suggested I write songs about how I felt, but I said no. I just couldn't bring myself to that place yet. ‘In My Soul’ is the only song that came out of what I was feeling at that time. I didn't think about it or analyze it, I just started singing.\n\n“For ‘One Step Ahead of the Blues’: I am a JJ Cale fanatic. I love his voice and his style. Although JJ did not write this song, his recording has always been on my playlist. It just fits this band and album with Albert. It turned into a great duet that makes for a strong bond.”\n\n​\n\nPhoto by: Norma Touchette\n\nAlbert Castiglia ventured inspirations for “A Thousand Heartaches” and “Tooth and Nail”: “In March of 2022, while on tour in Delaware with The Blood Brothers, Mike asked me to write a ballad for the new album, because we were well-stocked with up tempo numbers and needed to change the pace a little. Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to write an unrequited love song like ‘Bell Bottom Blues’ by Derek & The Dominos or ‘We’ve Got Tonight’ by Bob Seger. I’ve been through unreciprocated and forbidden love in my life, but never had the songwriting chops to express how I felt in the midst of it. Most of my songs of love gone bad or love never meant to be usually had me coming off as bitter. I wanted to change that, dig into my past and write something that had me taking the high road and coming off a little more dignified. I think my songwriting has come a long way and ‘A Thousand Heartaches’ is a result of that progression.\n\n“And when Tinsley Ellis writes a song for you, you listen! Tinsley came to our Blood Brothers show in Atlanta last summer and told us he had a few songs that he had written for us. ‘Tooth and Nail’ grabbed my attention right away. It has all the elements that appeal to a blues-rock guy who grew up in Florida. To me, it’s the ultimate southern rock, Florida/Georgia blues tune. It’s signature Tinsley. It was an honor to sing and play on this one.”\n\n​\n\n​Mike and Albert will be hitting the road again in support of the new Blood Brothers album, with dates booked by Intrepid Artists. With over 45 years combined in the music business, Zito and Castiglia have toured the world spreading joy and bringing the music to the people. For the upcoming “Blood Brothers” tour, both Mike and Albert will be onstage performing together for the entire show, so fans can enjoy the amazing chemistry and creativity that these two musicians share with each other – and the audience. In addition to their own rock, blues and roots individual tunes, the set will feature a number of songs from the Blood Brothers album.\n\n✪ Gulf Coast Records Announces the Signing of Rock and Roll Band Ole Lonesome ✪\n\nGulf Coast Records is excited to announce the signing of rock and roll band Ole Lonesome and will release their label debut album later this year. Born in the oil swamps of Beaumont, TX, and raised on the blues, Ole Lonesome is a swamp rock band with its ear tuned to the past and boots to the future. With their love of tone and electric live performances, Zachary Feemster (Vocals & Guitar), J. Wesley Hardin (Bass), Gregory Mosley (Keys), Jimmy Devers (Drums), and Greg Achord (Guitar) look to recreate the colors of decades gone and take their music through the stratosphere. Ole Lonesome is joining producer Mike Zito at Dockside Studio this week to record their upcoming album.\n\nhttps://www.olelonesome.com/\n\n✪ Gulf Coast Records Announces the Signing of Blues Guitar Wizard Joanna Connor and Will Release Her Label Debut CD in Spring, 2023 ✪\n\nNEDERLAND, TX – Gulf Coast Records announces the signing of acclaimed Chicago blues guitar great Joanna Connor, and will release her label debut CD in the Spring of 2023. Connor will be going into the studio in December to record the new album. She’ll be recording with her “Wrecking Crew 22” band that includes: Joanna Connor - guitar and vocals; Shaun Gotti Calloway – bass; Dan Souvigny – guitar and keys; Curtis Moore Jr. – keys; and Jason J Roc Edwards - drums and vocals. Several special guests on the sessions will be announced at a later date.\n\n“I’ve been a fan of Joanna Connor for a long time and it’s just incredible that she’s working with our label,” Gulf Coast label head Mike Zito said in making the announcement. “Joanna Connor is one of the greats in contemporary blues and has been for over thirty years. She has a sound and a feel that is immediately recognizable and magical.”\n\n“I’ve had some wonderful labels in the past, but signing with Gulf Coast feels like I’m joining a family,” said Joanna Connor. “I’m also extremely excited for my new band to bring our music to the world. Now we have found the home base to launch it from.”\n\nLooking more in-person like a woman who could be your next door neighbor rather than the scorching blues rock guitar goddess that she is, Joanna Connor is an atypical and unassuming guitar heroine who absolutely shreds or tenderly caresses notes out of a Gibson Les Paul. Those who are in the know rave about a musician who has played behind Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, Otis Rush and Luther Allison; and shared stages with the likes of Jimmy Page, Robben Ford, Robert Cray, the Doobie Brothers, Etta James and numerous other legends. Having her performances passed along on social media by heavy hitters Slash, Bootsy Collins, Vernon Reed and others only gives credence to her immense and intriguing talents.\n\nPhoto by: Maryam Wilcher\n\nJoanna Connor was born in Brooklyn, New York, raised in Worcester, Massachusetts, and after beginning her career there at the age of 17, packed a suitcase, a Fender Twin Amp, a guitar and bought a bus ticket to the Blues Mecca of Chicago, where her goal was to be in a cracking blues band learning from the best . A mere month after moving to the Windy City, Delta blues heavyweight Johnny Littlejohn hired her. A few months after that, Dion Payton enlisted her to be a part of his 43rd Street Blues Band, where they held residencies at the hallowed Checkerboard Lounge and the Kingston Mines blues clubs, and were the backing band behind every major talent in the city. Joanna went on to tour with sax great AC Reed before starting her own band at the urging of the Kingston Mines owner. Blind Pig Records signed Joanna in 1989 and released several records on her before she went on to become the second artist to sign with Ruf Records; subsequently releasing many records for the German-based label, which led to a decade of touring throughout Europe.\n\nIn 2002, The House of Blues in Chicago offered Joanna and her band a weekly residency, and with her additional residency at the Kingston Mines, Connor made the decision to come off the road touring grind for a while and work locally four nights per week, while raising her two children as a single mom. Joanna also recorded several albums for the highly-respected MC Records during that decade.\n\n​​\n\nIn 2019, one of the videos of her fierce guitar work caught the eyes and ears of one of the most prominent guitarists of the modern era -Joe Bonamassa - as well as director Adrian Lynne (Flash Dance, Fatal Attraction). Lynne offered her a scene performing in the movie, Deep Water, starring Ben Affleck. At the same time, Joe Bonamassa and his KTBA Records label gave her the opportunity to make a studio album. Both projects happened right before the COVID 19 epidemic and subsequent lockdown. The KTBA album, 4801 South Indiana, was released in February of 2021 to immense critical acclaim and a number one spot on the Billboard blues chart. The Deep Water film was released on Hulu in March, 2022.\n\nJoanna and her band went right back to work in April of 2021. With a band of young virtuoso musicians she dubbed the “Wrecking Crew 22,” fires were started worldwide on stages everywhere. Joanna reached out to one of her most beloved musicians, Mike Zito and Gulf Coast Records in hopes that this tsunami of musical energy and passion could be unleashed on record, and soon everyone will hear what all the excitement is about.\n\nhttps://joannaconnor.com/\n\n𝐂𝐎𝐍𝐆𝐑𝐀𝐓𝐔𝐋𝐀𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍𝐒 Eric Demmer!

So Fine was produced by Mike Zito and Eric Demmer, with mixing and mastering done by Ernie Wells of Eighth Note Productions.\n\nEric’s soulful, soaring saxophone and well-worn vocals punctuate the delivery on all dozen tracks of So Fine. “I try to insert humor into some of the songs I write like ‘Don’t Talk to Me’ and ‘What Was I Thinking,” he says. “After all the years of playing sax with famous guitar players, I realize that, ‘I’m a Guitar Player’…I just don’t play guitar. On a more serious note, the song ‘Will It Ever Be the Same’ was inspired from one of our darkest times in history. All the loss of life and destruction happening at the same time really hurt my soul and it made me wonder if it ever will be the same. “\n\nEric Demmer began his professional career in the early 1980s as a roadie for a Texas dancehall band. “During that time, I became a sound engineer working for sound companies; and in 1989, I was the sound engineer on Clint Black’s ‘Killing Time’ tour,” he recalls. After I left the tour, I decided to devote my time to playing sax full-time. In 1993, I got the call to play with the legendary guitarist, Clarence ‘Gatemouth Brown,’ and was a member of ‘Gate’s’ band until his death in 2005. One of my career highlights while playing with ‘Gate’ was performing on Eric Clapton’s, ‘From the Cradle’ Tour. Also, I was invited by Dickey Betts to perform with The Allman Brothers Band, and I had the privilege of performing with many world-class artists such as Johnny Clyde Copeland, B.B. King, Carlos Santana, Bonnie Raitt, Dr. John, Buddy Guy, Johnnie Johnson, Les Paul, Billy Gibbons, and many more. In 2016, I played shows with Mike Zito; and in 2018, I started performing with guitarist Mike Zito’s Big Blues Band. After playing with Mike and so many other great artists, I had the yearning to put out my own album and share my heartfelt experiences. The album, So Fine, tells the story of my relationships throughout my personal and musical experiences. “\n\nIn recent years, in addition to playing with award-winning blues guitarist, Mike Zito, Eric’s horn work graced albums by The BB King Blues Band, featuring Tito Jackson of the Jackson 5. In addition to playing saxophone, Eric produced a CD for The BB King Blues Band that was released in 2019; also performed on Mike Zito’s Resurrection album and Tito Jackson’s recent CD, Under Your Spell, which were both released in 2021 on Gulf Coast Records. When he’s not touring with other artists, Eric also tours with his own band. He describes his sound as “high-energy blues with a mix of funk and rock-n-roll.” Eric combines a variety of musical styles and influences while reminding everyone that “…the real thing comes from the heart and soul.”\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.

As Mike pointed out, there is no doubt that my time in New Orleans redefined me as a musician, and changed me forever on many levels. When he suggested we go down to Dockside Studio, situated on the lazy Vermilion River south of Lafayette, Louisiana, record with iconic New Orleans engineer, Mr. David Farrell, AND work with some of my dearest friends and finest musicians in the Crescent City, I was absolutely sold. From a very long and amazing list, we chose songs by some of the most important songwriters in American music, artists like Allen Toussaint, Fats Domino, and Dr. John. The Louisiana Record is my tribute to the mash-up of Blues, Soul, Rhythm & Blues, and Rock-n-roll that is New Orleans Music.”\n\n​\n\nJoining Jimmy Carpenter (sax and vocals) for the red beans and rice run of 11 songs on The Louisiana Record are: Mike Zito – guitars; Casandra Faulconer - bass guitar; John Gros - piano/organ; and Wayne Maureau – drums.\n\n​\n\nNow based in Las Vegas, Jimmy Carpenter lived and performed in New Orleans from early 2004 until 2016, and his time there clearly influenced his music.“Without question, New Orleans and the music that flows out of that great city have had a huge impact on me, musically and personally,” Carpenter says. “These are songs by iconic American songwriters, just a few of my favorites that helped shape me and my approach to writing, playing, and living. It is impossible to overstate the influence New Orleans, its music and its musicians have had on me, as player, songwriter, and performer.\n\n​\n\n\"The musical bar in New Orleans is set very high, and it's both terrifying and inspiring. I got used to being in over my head, and hanging on for dear life. But as daunting as the music can be, I was welcomed and encouraged by the musicians and the community. My friends that recorded this album with me were all huge parts of my ‘upbringing” in that scene, and I'm so happy we came together again to record these songs. \"There are so many songs that I've come across in my life that originated in Nola. I did ‘I Hear You Knocking’ and ‘Travelin' Mood’ years ago, but hearing Fats Domino and Dr. John do them - right in front of me - really gave them new meaning.\n\n​\n\n\"As I searched for songs for this record, the one that I was sure I wanted to do was the beautiful ballad, ‘All These Things. Written by one of the world's greatest songwriters, Mr. Allen Toussaint, and recorded originally by Art ‘Poppa Funk’ Neville, it is the epitome of New Orleans soul: simple, melodic, grooving and a great song for some pretty sax.\n\n​\n\n\"‘Something You Got,’ by Chris Kenner, is a standard in New Orleans, but I did not realize how many artists, from all over the world, have recorded it. I think we put a very cool, funky, greasy spin on it, and it's definitely gonna’ be in my regular set henceforth.\n\n​\n\n\"This record is very different for me, recorded almost completely live, with simple instrumentation, and no frills. Strong melodies, laid back, grooving, iconic songs that were a real pleasure to play and sing, especially with this group of musicians, and literally on the bayou at Dockside Studios.\"\n\n​\n\nThe Louisiana Record Track Listing\n\n• I Hear You Knocking\n\n• I Got Loaded\n\n• Something You Got\n\n• Barefootin’\n\n• All These Things\n\n• Travelin’ Mood\n\n• Cry to Me\n\n• Those Lonely Lonely Nights\n\n• Pouring Water on a Drowning Man\n\n• Bringing It On Home to Me\n\n• Rockin’ at Cosimo’s\n\n𝐂𝐎𝐍𝐆𝐑𝐀𝐓𝐔𝐋𝐀𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍𝐒 to our Gulf Coast Records artists for their nominations in the Blues Blast Music Awards!\n\nSean Costello Rising Star Award - Kat Riggins\n\nProducer - Mike Zito\n\nElectric Guitar - Albert Castiglia\n\nHarmonica - Jason Ricci\n\nHorn - Jimmy Carpenter\n\n​\n\nFan voting to determine the winners begins begins July 12, 2022 and continues until August 19, 2022 We would greatly appreciate it if you would consider voting for our Gulf Coast nominees. -Thank you -\n\n𝐂𝐎𝐍𝐆𝐑𝐀𝐓𝐔𝐋𝐀𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍𝐒 Kat Riggins!!
