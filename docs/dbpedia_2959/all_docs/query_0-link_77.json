        "text": "\"Failure was an absolute gift for me,\" says Aaron Bruno. The singer/songwriter and frontman for electronic rock outfit AWOLNATION knows a thing or two about falling short and fighting on.\n\nThe Los Angeles-bred Bruno got his first record deal, with Madonna's Maverick Records, at age 21 with his post-grunge band Home Town Hero and his second, with Island Records, at 26 as leader of pop-rockers Under the Influence of Giants. Those bands, their records and his label deals all went south. Deflated, in debt and into his 30s, Bruno was back working a day job when he began his third act, forming AWOLNATION and eventually releasing 2011's \"Megalithic Symphony,\" which turned into the hit he'd long been working toward.\n\n\"Because of what I'd gone through, once this happened, I was able to compartmentalize it and not take myself that seriously,\" says Bruno, 37. \"I take the music very seriously and am very passionate about the art. But at the end of the day, we're making and playing music for a living. We're just having fun, really.\"\n\nFor Bruno, the fun has continued on his current tour, a package bill headlined by pop-punk outfit Fall Out Boy that stops Friday at FedExForum. \"It's been great, playing these 45-minute sets every night and gaining new fans,\" says Bruno. \"It's usually 50/50 with the audiences — sometimes we come out and they're already on their feet, and sometimes we start the set and I'm like 'OK, we're about to horrify these kids,' you know? But I enjoy that challenge. I finally said it last night out loud: 'I promise you're going to be standing by the end.' And of course they were. By the last song, we're trying to make it feel like it's our own headlining show.\"\n\nAWOLNATION has one big advantage when it comes to winning over audiences, namely the stirring radio hit \"Sail.\" The number proved to be one of the biggest and most enduring rock songs of the past few years — a hit twice over (once in 2011, and even bigger upon its re-release in 2012), it lingered on the Billboard Hot 100 charts for 79 weeks and went platinum six times over. \"It's beyond just an alternative rock hit — it was a cultural breakthrough,\" says Bruno. \"Everyone's mom knows 'Sail.' I don't suppose I'll ever have a song that big for the rest of my life. It was a bolt of lightning, an accident.\"\n\nRather than view the song as a millstone around his neck, Bruno says the success of the track was liberating. \"It was proof that I could do something like that, which I hadn't proven before,\" he says. \"Also, it was such a nice way to get people to hear the whole album. Ultimately, I felt I had artistic freedom to make the second record exactly how I wanted to because of that success, rather than chasing that monster.\"\n\nAWOLNATION's second album, \"Run,\" was released last year and defied any notion of a sophomore slump. \"Because 'Sail' was so huge,\" Bruno says, \"it's easy for it be overlooked that we've had five other top-five singles at alternative radio.\"\n\nBruno's past career experiences have made AWOLNATION's rise feel like a hard-won but well-tempered victory. \"I've had a lot of ups and downs,\" he says. \"The ups were a lot of hope, and the downs were reality. Once (AWOLNATION came) around, I had no delusions — 'Oh, I got a record deal; I'm gonna be the biggest artist in the world' — like I felt when I was 21, when I got my deal with Maverick. I thought, 'Cool we're gonna sell millions, done deal.' And the exact opposite happened.\"\n\n\"When I listen back to all the songs that didn't make it from my early records, I can hear there's something there. It's so close but not quite there. Either the sound was too far out there for the time, or maybe lyrically I wasn't saying anything that was universal or that people could relate to. But I was so close. I always felt subconsciously that it was going to work out somehow.\"\n\nAt the end of his second deal, with Island Records, Bruno figured he'd have to try a different path to reach his goals. \"I thought maybe I'd be a songwriter for other artists. I did have some allies and people rooting for me in the business, and I got thrown a couple opportunities to write, but nothing caught on,\" he says. \"Eventually, I threw in the towel and had to get a job. You can only last off record deals and advances for so long. Just when I was broke as you can be and in debt with credit cards and all that, is right when the opportunity came to me with Red Bull Records and someone believed in me again.\"\n\nThe label — an offshoot of the energy drink company — gave Bruno a chance to record, helping him release a digital EP in 2010 and then follow up with AWOLNATION's full-length debut the following year.\n\n\"I was damaged goods at that point. No one wanted to sign me, not again,\" says Bruno. \"Not only did those early records not do good, but I had a poor attitude about it. I was known in the business as someone who was 'problematic' — I remember hearing that and going, 'What?' I didn't feel like I was, but, looking back, I made some irrational decisions, had too much of an ego and was too emotional and very immature. I'm glad all that happened before my success because I probably wouldn't have handled this as well.\"\n\nThese days, aside from AWOLNATION, Bruno has been working with a handful of fledgling artists, helping them realize their dreams. \"I prefer discovering unknown talent, rather than working with someone who's had a bunch of success already,\" he says. \"I've been stepping out and producing and writing with some young artists, trying to give them the same opportunities people have given me along the way, mentoring them and giving back in that way.\"\n\nFall Out Boy, AWOLNATION, PVRIS"
