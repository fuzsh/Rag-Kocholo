        "text": "The label and a related publishing company are offshoots of the Danny DeGennaro Foundation, named for the Levittown artist.\n\nLEVITTOWN, PA — A new record label and publishing company based in Bucks County aims to keep the music of one local musician alive, while promoting the songs of new local musicians, too.\n\nDDF JAM Publishing and the Danny DeGennaro Foundation Record Label are recording, releasing and promoting songs by winners of the Danny DeGennaro Foundation scholarship, including 2020 recipient Sarah Rue Laskey.\n\nEd Mero, of the Danny DeGennaro Foundation, said the label has been in the works for two years. He said it took time to establish and research distribution channels for the music.\n\nThe label will release primarily digital songs through CD Baby, with downloads and streaming available on Spotify, iTunes and Amazon Music. John Austin Mulhern, a longtime Danny DeGennaro Foundation partner, is president of the newly formed publishing company.\n\nSigning with a publishing company is a way to have your songs considered for films, Mero said.\n\n\"They don’t even want to talk to the artists,\" Mero said. \"You have to already be signed up or have a structure set up to be able to pitch your song.\"\n\nThe label and publishing company provides artist development and ensures intellectual property rights are protected through Artist Rights Society, the group says. Royalties arebpaid through BMI or ASCAP. Career development is furthered through Mulhern’s songwriting workshops, as well as copyrighting songs, career guidance, booking and management, contract review and negotiations.\n\nMusic for the lable is being recorded at Sonlight Productions LLC, a Perkasie-based recording studio. The Danny DeGennaro Foundation has recorded scholarship award winners’ music there for the past four years.\n\nSo far, Laskey, previous scholarship winner Katelyn Cryan, Bucks County singer/songwriter Cara Cartney and Bucks hip hop artist Kenny \"KB\" Brown have recorded songs. Three of DeGennaro’s albums also have been recorded and released digitally.\n\nThe label is working with 15-20 Bucks County artists and anticipates collaborating with more musicians in the tri-state area. Bucks County professional musician John Chaykin, a longtime DeGennaro friend and music collaborator, will lead the record label’s talent search as A&R director.\n\nA drummer since age 10, Chaykin met DeGennaro when he was 13 or 14 and DeGennaro was 17.\n\nThe first time DeGennaro’s drummer missed a show and Chaykin played with his \"hero\" was the \"highlight of my life,\" he said. From 2000 until his death in 2011, DeGennaro played on four of Chaykin’s five albums. The record label recently released \"Light Year,\" one of their songs.\n\n\"He’s got the type of music that has staying power,\" Chaykin said, comparing DeGennaro to Stevie Ray Vaughan or Eric Clapton. \"His music never dies. It’ll always be listenable and great.\"\n\nAs A&R director, Chaykin is looking for similar qualities in today’s musicians.\n\n\"I try to see 'Would this sell?’ Would people be interested'?\" Chaykin said. \"There’s also the look. That’s a big part of it. Do they have stage presence?\"\n\nAny money raised from DDF JAM Publishing LLC will be donated to the Danny DeGennaro Foundation.\n\n\"The market's changed,\" Mero said. \"The reality of it is you have as much clout as a major label if you do it correctly.\"\n\nTo learn more about the DDF JAM Publishing you may visit its website or contact Mero at 954-604-1288 or emero@dannydegennaro.org.\n\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
