        "text": "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)Katy Perry\n\nWhen \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" climbed to #1 on the Hot 100, Katy Perry became the first woman to send five songs from one album to the top of the charts. The four previous chart-toppers from her Teenage Dream set were \"California Gurls,\" \"Teenage Dream,\" \"Firework\"; and, \"E.T.\"\n\n...Baby One More TimeBritney Spears\n\n\"Baby One More Time\" was originally offered to TLC but they passed on it. The R&B trio felt uncomfortable singing the line \"hit me baby one more time.\"\n\nShe BangsRicky Martin\n\nThe Ricky Martin song \"She Bangs\" found new life when William Hung performed it so horribly on a 2004 episode of American Idol that it went viral.\n\nThunderstruckAC/DC\n\nAngus Young created the distinctive opening guitar part for \"Thuderstruck\" by playing with all the strings taped up, except the B. He learned the studio trick from his older brother George Young, who was the rhythm guitarist for The Easybeats.\n\nJust DanceLady Gaga\n\n\"Just Dance\" was Lady Gaga's first hit, and it also brought the techno-synth sound that had been popular in Europe for the previous decade to the United States.\n\nMoney For NothingDire Straits\n\nDire Straits frontman Mark Knopfler got the idea for \"Money For Nothing\" after overhearing delivery men in a New York department store complain about their jobs while watching MTV.\n\nKip WingerSongwriter Interviews\n\nThe Winger frontman reveals the Led Zeppelin song he cribbed for \"Seventeen,\" and explains how his passion for orchestra music informs his songwriting.\n\nDan ReedSongwriter Interviews\n\nDan cracked the Top 40 with \"Ritual,\" then went to India and spent 2 hours with the Dalai Lama.\n\nScott Gorham of Thin Lizzy and Black Star RidersSongwriter Interviews\n\nWriting with Phil Lynott, Scott saw their ill-fated frontman move to a darker place in his life and lyrics."
