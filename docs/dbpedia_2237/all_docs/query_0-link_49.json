        "text": "Bill on his Big Sur Quintet\n\nI chose my 858 Quartet (violinist Jenny Scheinman, violist Eyvind Kang and cellist Hank Roberts) because I've\n\nknown them for decades, they're close friends. It's about these particular people and the chemical and human interaction. We've been together for about 10 years.... but I wanted to have drums. Rudy Royston is another of my closest musical brothers. He always knows exactly what to do to lift things up and surprise me. I am so excited to have him be a part of this. So we added Rudy Royston, the drummer who plays in my Beautiful Dreamers trio-so I'm calling it the Big Sur Quintet. It's only five of us, but its either super-intimate, or very huge and orchestral. The possibilities are gigantic.\n\nFeaturing Greg Leisz, Jenny Scheinman, Tony Scherr and Kenny Wollesen.\n\nCome together. In 1963 I was starting to get really fired up about music and the guitar. I was hearing The Ventures, The Astronauts, The Beach Boys, The Four Seasons, Peter Paul and Mary...stuff like that on the radio. Louie Louie. American Bandstand. 1964. I saw an article in Time magazine about a group called the Beatles. About 45 years later, in the fall of 2005, I had a European tour set up with Jenny Scheinman and Greg Leisz. For our first concert we were asked to play the music of John Lennon as part of an event that was going on at the CitÃ© de la Musique in Paris. We went to Paris. It was so inspiring preparing for this concert and spending time with John Lennon's music. In 2010 I was asked to do a 3 night residency at Yoshi's with a different project each night. Seemed like a good moment to play John Lennon's music again. This time we added Kenny Wollesen and Tony Scherr to the group. Not long after this, I began a relationship with Savoy, and they gave us the opportunity to record.\n\nJohn Lennon's music has been with me, the band, everybody, the world...seems like forever. The songs are part of us. In our blood. There was nothing we really needed to do to prepare for this. We've been preparing our whole lives. The songs are there. All we had to do was play them. Everyone involved with this project (Jenny Scheinman, Greg Leisz, Tony Scherr, Kenny Wollesen, Lee Townsend, Adam Munoz, everyone at Savoy, and at Fantasy Studios) has their own personal, deep, long, relationship to John Lennon's music. It connects us all and brings us together. I feel blessed having the chance to play this music with these people.\n\nBill Frisell on the 858 Quartet\n\n\"Originally the music for this group was written for and inspired by eight Gerhard Richter paintings (858, 1-8). A project was put together and produced by my friend, David Breskin. The Richter paintings are where this began, but the chemistry felt so good with these folks, I have written more music and will continue to do so as it develops on into the future. The group consists of Jenny Scheinman (violin), Eyvind Kang (viola), and Hank Roberts (cello). For me, this has been a chance to write for my dream string section and also a reunion with one of my best friends, Hank Roberts. Hank was in my first band and we hadn't played together or even seen each other for many years.\"\n\nBill Frisell on his trio with Tony Scherr & Kenny Wollesen\n\n\"My trio with Tony Scherr and Kenny Wollesen is probably the most flexible, spontaneous group I play with. The program can change from night to night depending on what kind of mood we're all in, the size or sound of the room, the audience, what we have or had not had to eat that day, how much sleep we've had recently, how far we've traveled, etc. etc. We never plan a set before hand. With Tony and Kenny I have the luxury of playing just about anything that comes into my head at any moment. This could be music from any of my albums, standard songs, folk songs, or whatever. These guys really inspire and challenge me everytime we get together.\"\n\nBill Frisell on his duo with Greg Leisz:\n\n\"The first time I played with Greg Leisz was on my recording Good Dog, Happy Man. From the first notes we played together I felt completely connected to him musically. It's like he's the other half of my brain....He plays all of the things I wish I could play, but can't. We never figure anything out....it's so easy for us to play spontaneously and not get in each other's way. He's spent many years playing behind singers and I've spent many years trying to play like a singer. Maybe that's why it works so well. He also has an incredible knowledge of all kinds of American music from the early part of the 20th century on up to today. There's so much I learn from him. We've played together often over the past couple of years, but always in the context of my group. For a long time now we've both wanted to play in a duet setting and see what might happen.\"\n\nA native of Ft. Worth, Texas, Rudy Royston was raised in Denver, Colorado. He studied classical percussion at the University of Denver. While in college, Rudy began playing with trumpeter Ron Miles, whom Rudy deems his greatest teacher and music mentor. It was on Ron Miles recording Woman’s Day that Rudy first played with Bill Frisell. A major figure in the Denver music scene, Rudy performed with artist such as Dotsero, Leslie Drayton, Joe Keel, and Nelson Rangell. He began teaching music in public schools before relocating to the east coast. In 2006, he moved to New Jersey to pursue graduate studies in music at Rutgers University, studying Jazz percussion with Victor Lewis. Since moving, Rudy has begun performing steadily with Bill Frisell in quartet and trio settings. He quickly integrated into the New York music scene, performing with Javon Jackson, Les McCann, JD Allen, Sean Jones, Dr. Lonnie Smith, Jennifer Holiday, Ralph Bowen, Bruce Barth, Don Byron, Jason Moran, and Jenny Scheinman, to name a few. A lover of all genres of music, Rudy continues to expand his horizons as he gains increasing recognition in the world of Jazz.\n\nHank Roberts has created a unique and original voice on the cello through an extensive body of music as a performer, composer and recording artist. He has performed and recorded throughout the world with a host of celebrated musicians. With 10 CD's on the Munich based Winter and Winter label, his album 'Green (featuring touring partners Jim Black and Marc Ducret) won the 2008 German Recording Critics Award in the Jazz category.\n\nHe also tours and performs regularly with guitarist Bill Frisell's 858 Quartet and has appeared on Bill's Grammy Award winning CD Unspeakable, Grammy nominated 'History/Mystery' and the 2011 Savoy release ˜Sign of Life\". He recently played with Bill's 8 piece ensemble at the Park Avenue Armory in Manhattan performing music for Allen Ginsberg's ˜Kaddish\" poem read by Hal Willner and Chloe Webb. Hank has performed once, a few times or many times with the following: Gavin Friday, Bono, The Edge, Joel Grey, Larry Mullen Jr, Michelle Berry, Andy Summers, Antony, Adam Clayton, Sting, Anne Marie Cummings, John Zorn, Shane McGowen, Flo and Eddie, Pat Metheny, Mike Gibbs, Lydia Lunch, David Sanborn, Zbigniev Sweifert, Mamadou Diabate, Donna the Buffalo, Julius Hemphil, and Gary Burton, Donna the Buffalo, Ti Ti Chickapea, and Ethan Iverson and Dave King from The Bad Plus."
