        "text": "Grammy Award winner: My Bluegrass Heart — Béla Fleck\n\n2021\n\nLabel: Renew Records / BMG\n\nI think of this project as the third chapter in a trilogy which began with 1988’s Drive, and continued with Bluegrass Sessions in 1999.\n\nThese two albums featured a core band that included Sam Bush, Tony Rice, Jerry Douglas, Stuart Duncan, and Mark Schatz.\n\nAs the years since Bluegrass Sessions began to pile on top of each other and grow into decades, I began to amass compositions that were consciously and unconsciously designed for that band. Tony Rice became less available due to his health issues, I began to wonder if that chapter of my bluegrass life had now closed. If I may be selfish for a moment here, this left me in a bit of a pickle. You see, Tony Rice was the only guitarist I had met who could make it possible for me to play bluegrass in the way I wanted to.\n\nTime passed and other interesting changes had been happening on our bluegrass scene. A whole slew of new players had emerged, highly influenced by the movement that John Hartford, Sam Bush, Tony Rice, David Grisman, Jerry Douglas, Tony Trischka, Bill Keith, and so many other great players had pioneered. There were a whole lot more amazing cats of all ages that I never remember there being, in all my years of bluegrass awareness.\n\nAnd it was towards the end of 2019 that I started getting that itch. Partly it was spurred on by a health issue that had emerged with our baby boy, Theo. He had a very close call, life and death, really...and I didn’t want to be going anywhere on the road. For some reason, when I should have been recovering from the trauma of all of that, I suddenly really wanted to make a bluegrass recording. I can’t explain it. Perhaps it was an escape, or maybe I just wanted some control and to touch base with my emotional center; to make some honest music surrounded by musical friends, record it at home, and not go anywhere. And I had all these tunes that I was afraid I would forget about, or I’d die, or whatever, and they would be lost. They were burning a hole in my pocket, as they say.\n\nSo now...how was I gonna do this with no Tony Rice? Maybe it was time to embrace the present, and get more familiar with some of the bright new lights in our bluegrass galaxy.\n\nAnd so I did. I set up a “jam/rehearsals” with some of my favorites whom I’d never really gotten to play much with—Paul Kowert, Michael Cleveland, Dominick Leslie, and Cody Kilby…those led to Billy Strings, Royal Masat, Billy Contreras, Andy Leftwich, Sierra Hull, Molly Tuttle, and beyond.\n\nPretty soon I started to see this project as an exploration of the current bluegrass world, and a gathering of a certain segment of the tribe. I must say that there are many fantastic players who I love that I just couldn’t include this time, for space considerations.\n\nBut legacy artists and up-and-comers alike, My Bluegrass Heart encompasses Bluegrass in its core — the inter-generational passing down of music tradition.\n\nThe Ripple Effect — Béla Fleck & Toumani Diabaté\n\n2020\n\nLabel: Craft Recordings\n\nWhile in Bamako, Mali on my trip to Africa, I was in search of the great kora legend, Toumani Diabaté. He was one of few people who was not available while I was there recording Throw Down You Heart. He did overdub on a couple of tracks after the fact, so that he could be a part of the album, but we had not had the chance to really play together.\n\nA very promising musical rapport finally began for us at the Winnipeg Folk Festival. When I saw that Toumani was also on the bill, I asked the promoter to see if he would consider doing a workshop together. I was very excited when he agreed to do it. Once we began to play, a great potential as a duo immediately revealed itself. His incredible soloing ability was offset by astonishing supportive abilities, and an overall elegance that blew me away. Toumani certainly made me feel very comfortable, and it felt like we truly inspired each other.\n\nAfter Throw Down Your Heart was released, we began touring together, doing quite a few performances — which gave our duo the time it needed to develop and reach towards its potential, and in my opinion we certainly got there! Fortunately the tour was recorded beautifully by my long time touring sound-man, Richard Battaglia. The show that was selected for release was recorded on Toumani’s birthday in Seattle.\n\nAs we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Throw Down Your Heart project, the perfect moment has come to put that music into the world. I hope you enjoy this musical adventure — I certainly did.\n\nBéla Fleck & Abigail Washburn\n\n2014\n\nLabel: Rounder Records\n\nMy love, wife and partner Abigail and I had talked about performing together seriously some day - ever since the day her grandmother announced that we were performing at her church. When Grandma June told you what was going to happen, there was no choice involved, you just did it. So we threw together a show at the last minute. We discovered to our surprise that we had a great chemistry on stage, and that two banjos and her voice were more than enough to satisfy an audience. We kept putting it off performing as a duo, partly because Abby wanted to establish her own identity more before performing with me, since I was pretty well known in the scene and she was a newer face. When we decided to have a child, it seemed like the perfect time, since we didn’t want to be apart all the time raising a kid. So we took our family on the road. We made the album in our basement, about 6 months into parenthood. We wouldn’t advise that timing, FYI. We still don’t know how we managed to pull it off. And amazingly - it won a Grammy for best folk album!\n\nThe Imposter\n\n2013\n\nWith the Nashville Symphony & Brooklyn Rider, concerto conducted by Giancarlo Guerrero\n\nLabel: Mercury Classics\n\nNashville Symphony gave me the opportunity and a good motivating push to do it by commissioning me to write the piece.\n\nAfter writing a couple of these pieces with my genius pal Edgar Meyer, and one with he and Zakir Hussain(also a genius), it was time to see if I had anything musical to say without them, in this arena. Fortunately the folks at Deutche Grammophone thought I did, and put the record out. It’s released on August 13th, 2013. There’s an elephant on the cover of the cd, so if you are looking for banjo concertos and you want to get mine, look for the elephant.\n\nAfter writing two concertos with Edgar Meyer (one in tandem with Zakir Hussain) I was starting to want some room to try out some of my own ideas, and also wondering if I had the stuff to create something like this on my own. I mentioned the idea of writing a stand alone banjo concerto to Alan and Giancarlo from Nashville Symphony, and got a terrifying response. They actually wanted me to do it! This is the most musically ambitious project I’ve ever taken on, writing and orchestrating for full orchestra and banjo. I dedicated myself to the task, and wrote the 36 minute long Impostor Concerto over a 6 month period. Now I needed to complete the album with something else. I decided to write a piece for string quartet and banjo for the great quartet Brooklyn Rider, called Night Flight Over Water; these two extended pieces make up the Impostor CD. The Impostor Concerto was commissioned by the Nashville Symphony, and Night Flight was commissioned by Butler University. I am thrilled that the premiere classical label Deutche Grammophon wanted to release this. There is a documentary about the writing and premiering of the concerto coming out soon.\n\nTales From The Acoustic Planet Vol 3, Throw Down Your Heart: Africa Sessions\n\n2009\n\nFeaturing Oumou Sangare, Toumani Diabate, Vusi Mahlesela, Anania Ngoliga, Bassekou Kouate, D’Gary, and Many More\n\nLabel: Rounder Records\n\nIn 2005 the Flecktones had decided to take a year off, for the first time since we had started full time touring in 1990. I was thinking about projects that I’d want to do that I didn’t have time to do properly in a typical Flecktone year. I had long dreamed about the idea of going to Africa, where the banjo originally came from, and connecting with the acoustic musicians that I knew were there. It wasn’t til I heard Oumou Sangare’s music wafting from the back of the Flecktones bus one night after a show that the idea took hold in a serious way. I went to the back to investigate the remarkable sounds that Jeff Coffin was playing on his computer, and I fell in love. Not with Jeff, with Oumou! Now I had heard African acoustic music that I could relate to, and imagine myself within, I started thinking seriously about making a trip there on our off year. Folks at Sony got excited about the idea, and insisted that I film it. So I asked my brother Sascha if he’d want to direct a film over there, and he was way into it. We locked in a couple of great engineers (doc sound, and music recording) a great cinematographer and found field producers in each country. The trip was on! Two months before the trip, Sony backed out. Tickets were already bought, everyone was holding the time – it was too late to turn back now. I had to fund the very expensive trip myself. Another side story – a friend of mine had taken on the IRS in a massive battle. I had been subpoenaed as a material witness for the prosecution! And the court date had now been set up for when I was supposed to be in Africa! Lawyers advised me to cancel my trip, as I would become a law breaker if I didn’t show up – and they might lock me up when I came back into the country. I decided to roll the dice and go. At the last minute the trial was postponed and I didn’t go to jail. And neither did my friend. So everything worked out great. We went to Mali, The Gambia, Uganda and Tanzania, and had amazing musical adventures – which we caught on film and audio tape. It became Throw Down Your Heart. I decided that if this wasn’t a Tale from the Acoustic Planet, nothing was! So it also became became Tales From The Acoustic Planet, vol 3.\n\nJingle All The Way — Béla Fleck & The Flecktones\n\n2008\n\nBéla Fleck, Jeff Coffin, Victor Wooten, FutureMan featuring Edgar Meyer, Andy Statman and The Alash Ensemble\n\nLabel: Rounder Records\n\nThis album was on the bucket list for the Flecktones. We’d started doing Xmas medleys way back in 1989, on our first real tour, before New Grass Revival even disbanded. We thought that making a holiday recording could be a very creative endeavor, and didn’t have to be smarmy, tacky or cheap. It was pretty weird practicing these songs at sound checks in the heat of July. Our road crew nearly mutinied while we attempted to learn to play our Christmas medley, in which we experimented with the idea of playing multiple tunes simultaneously as counterpoint. It took a lot of time and repetition to figure out how to make them all work together – which just sounded to the crew like we were just playing these tunes over and over and over and over. In the end we figured out how to lay 5 or 6 of these tunes on top of each other, which we were excited about. The crew was excited when we stopped. I found a lovely Bach Christmas Cantata, which gave us the excuse to invite Edgar to play one of the lines with us, and play on another couple of tunes as well. Around this time we were contacted by a band of Tuvan ThroatSingers, The Alash Group. They were all highly influenced by our friend Kongar-ol Ondar, who appeared on Live at the Quick and Outbound. They were coming through Nashville and wanted to meet the Flecktones, as they were big fans of Live at the Quick DVD. After listening to their recording, and knowing how much the guys were into throat singing (Jeff, Futch and Vic had all learned the rudiments and could even do it, somewhat) I suggested that we add them in, as an unusual element for our holiday album. The other odd duck guest was Andy Statman, one of the giants of klezmer music and modern bluegrass. I knew him from when he played a lot with my teacher Tony Trischka, and I was looking for ways to play with this musical iconoclast. So he played mandolin and clarinet on a couple of tunes as well. A piece on the album that we worked very hard on was The 12 days of Christmas. We came up with the idea of playing in all 12 keys and 12 time signatures. This was fairly tough to figure out how to do, but eventually the piece surrendered to us and it really came together well. We’ve been told that this is a Christmas album for people that hate Christmas albums.\n\nThe Enchantment — Chick Corea & Béla Fleck\n\n2007\n\nFeaturing Jeff Coffin, Edgar Meyer, Andy Statman, Victor Wooten, FutureMan, and The Alash Ensemble\n\nLabel: Concord LG\n\nI was standing around backstage at the Newport Jazz Festival, where I was playing with Stanley Clarke and Jean Luc Ponty, when Ted Kurland walked up to chat. He mentioned that next year, my hero Chick Corea was looking to tour in a duo format, and I was on the list of possible collaborators. That was an exciting conversation, and I was thrilled at the idea of spending that kind of time making music with Chick. We started sending music to each other on line, and finally met to record in LA at Mad Hatter. We ran through a few things on the night before the session at the hotel, and that was the whole rehearsal. The album was recorded in just a few days, and immediately mixed. This was the first time since Drive that I had made an album so fast and with so little rehearsal. And it turned out great. Then we went out on tour, and did a lot of live dates where we got deeper into the music – and the spontaneity that is possible in an intimate setting like this. We’ll be doing some select dates in 2014. And we intend to release a live album in the not too distant future. This album won a Latin Grammy.\n\nLittle Worlds – Béla Fleck & The Flecktones\n\n2003\n\nBéla Fleck, Howard Levy, Victor Wooten, FutureMan featuring The Chieftains, Bobby McFerrin and Others\n\nLabel: Sony\n\nWe started recorded stuff for this and before we knew it we had way more than we needed for an album. Sony folks came down from New York to give it a listen and said – ‘hey why don’t you put it all out?’ I wasn’t expecting this response from a label, especially with what was starting to happen to record sales, so I said yes before they could change their mind! But if it was going to be triple album, maybe we should invite some friends in, to make it more diverse. That led to a lot of new and old friends taking part in what became more of a community release. Bobby McFerrin, The Chieftians and Derek Trucks, are a few of our new friends. We did put out the triple CD, but just to play it safe, also put out the single 10 from Little Worlds, which was the only one that lots of stores ordered. I imagine the triple CD is a bit of a collector’s item at this point. One other fun item was the manufactured comedy conversation that we assembled between Yankee’s center fielder Bernie Williams, and David St Hubbins (actually Micheal McKean) from Spinal Tap. They are driving around flipping the stations, and hear all this different crappy music before they find the opening track of the recording. All the bands you hear as they flip around the stations are us,and we’re playing altered and dumb versions of the songs on the record – as a heavy metal band, a country band, a madrigal vocal group, etc. We thought we were being really cagy and smart by making an introduction that could only be found by starting the first track and then holding the rewind tab on the CD player til it got to the beginning of the intro. It was called a hidden track; these were popular at the time. Now I think it was really stupid because nobody every heard the darn thing and it was a lot of fun to make. I have only a few regrets about the records I have made, and this is one of them. We should have started the record with this, loud and proud.\n\nLive at the Quick — Béla Fleck & The Flecktones\n\n2002\n\nBéla Fleck, Howard Levy, Victor Wooten, FutureMan featuring Paul McCandless, Paul Hansen, Sandip Burman, Andy Narell, and Kongar-ol\n\nLabel: Columbia\n\nThe idea that we should make a live DVD came about through the support of an old friend of mine from New Grass days, Joanne Gardner. She was now the head of video for Sony Records. Without Joanne, this project would never happened, and certainly not on the level that it did. DVDs were starting to move more than CDs now, which were stalling. Honestly the Outbound CD sales had been kind of disappointing after all the hoopla about signing to Sony. This project appealed to me because it was a way for us to bring more attention to that music, which really hadn’t been that widely heard. So we did the Live at The Quick DVD at the Quick Center in Fairfield, Ct with our instrumental guests and Kongar-ol Ondar from the Outbound CD. We called it the Flecktone Big Band, and had 9 people on stage. Marc Smerling directed, and he did a great job. The DVD did very well internationally, and a live album culled from this performances did nearly as well as Outbound. So in the end, that music got it’s due and made it out into the world quite well.\n\nTales from the Acoustic Planet Vol 2, The Bluegrass Sessions\n\n1999\n\nFeaturing Earl Scruggs, Vassar Clements, John Hartford, Sam Bush, Tony Rice, Jerry Douglas, Mark Schatz, and Stuart Duncan\n\nLabel: Warner Brothers\n\nIt had been over 10 years since the making of the Drive album, and by now it was a very highly regarded album. Every time I saw Tony Rice he’d say in that scratchy voice of his – “Hey man, when are we making ‘Drive Two’?” I wasn’t into calling it Drive Two, but I was sure into playing that kind of music again with those guys. Warners was dubious about a bluegrass recording, but I convinced them it would be something awesome, and they let me have my head. I pointed out that bluegrass was really coming on strong these days. And in fact it was proving to be a very vital form, with a place in the modern world. And this was not going to be your grampa’s bluegrass. I wanted to write some new music that would bring some different ideas to bluegrass, and take advantage of my experiences outside of the music over the last decade, to inform a new perspective. I was very aware that the movers and shakers in jazz were all influenced by music outside of it, and whenever there was a big shift, it was because outside influences had enriched the form. Charlie Parker and John Coltrane are two great examples of people bringing ideas from outside that changed the flow of the mainstream. I liked the idea that I should not be afraid or ashamed of all my time away from Bluegrass, but should find a way to use the time away to grow fresh ideas. So I wrote with all of this in mind. When we recorded this album, in my home in Belview,Tn, we were lucky enough to have Earl Scruggs, John Hartford and Vassar Clements join the core band of Tony Rice, Sam Bush, Jerry Douglas, Mark Schatz and Stuart Duncan. There is a great Austin City Limits TV special which features everyone but Tony, who wasn’t available for the tour. We substituted the very capable Bryan Sutton and did a ton of wonderful live shows, in which we played everyone’s music, but with a focus on the album.\n\nLeft of Cool — Béla Fleck & The Flecktones\n\n1998\n\nBéla Fleck, Jeff Coffin, Victor Wooten, FutureMan featuring Dave Matthews and Amy Grant\n\nLabel: Warner Brothers\n\nFlecktone time once again! Now that we had connected with Jeff Coffin, a fantastic multi-instrumentalist who excelled on saxophones, flutes, and bass clarinet, we stuck his shaved head on the cover of the album and we stood on it. He grew to like that over the new 14 years, or at least he said he did! This was our first album with Jeff, and he brought a hard edged funkiness to the band. We were back with a fresh sound, and it was the beginning of new glory days for us. At this point our friendship had kindled with Dave Matthews Band. We were opening piles of shows for them, and we sat in with DMB on all of them. I had found myself writing some songs with lyrics, and this was a new development that I didn’t know quite what to make of. But Future Man has a great voice and was into trying some of these out. Of course there was a significant backlash, from folks that thought we were selling out. Well, we wouldn’t have minded some widespread pop acclaim, but if we really wanted it badly enough, we probably shouldn’t have had Dave Matthews sit in on such an odd song, in such a strange meter. At any rate, along with the sometimes maligned vocal songs, we had some classic Flecktone instrumentals, such as Sojourn of Arjuna, Big Country and shanti, and the new sounds of Jeff Coffin loud in the mix.\n\nLive Art — Béla Fleck & The Flecktones\n\n1996\n\nFeaturing many special guests\n\nLabel: Warner Brothers\n\nThe double live album\n\nThe band was realizing the strength of our live show at this point. We had had so many amazing guests sit in, and people always told us that they felt the live show was preferable to the records. As hard as we worked on making records we could be proud of, something happened on stage that we could not get to happen in the studio environment. So we decided to go thru our archives and put together an impossible and cosmic live show that was careened from year to year with no regard for linear timelines. We pulled tracks from the Howard days, the trio days, from a show where we did Acoustic Planet music at the Ryman Theatre with Chick Corea, John Cowan singing with us at Telluride, and Bruce Hornsby sitting in in Louisville. We also scheduled and recorded a 5 day tour with Sam and Paul together. I had learned a lot about digital editing in the making of Tales from the Acoustic Planet, and I knew that the cost of completing a live album in the studio from 100 plus shows was cost prohibitive. We could’t afford to do it. That’s when Warner Brothers bought us a Pro Tools rig. The home studio revolution hadn’t happened yet, but it sure was about to. When I realized what kind of control I could have by making records at home, I never looked back. Noone was going to tell me that we were out of time, or that the budget didn’t allow for us to make our record properly ever again. I went through all these shows at home, and picked out the performances, and we edited and mixed them there. One interesting story – I had fallen in love with a track we did in Louisville with Bruce Hornsby sitting in with the band. But we couldn’t find the multi tracks that were recorded at the performance – just a rough board mix. Richard Battaglia, my sound man/road manager since 1982 felt sure that they had been given to him, but he could not for the life of him figure out where they were. He even went to a psychic who told him that they were safe, and in a dark place. They turned out to be under his desk in a lock box he had forgotten about. We got them just in time to mix and still make it onto the record. The song was More Love. Another interesting item – Warners did not want to count this recording as part of our deal, citing the fact that live albums don’t typically sell. We fought that, saying that it should count, because live was what people always said they wanted to hear from us, and what if it was a big success? Not counting it would mean they got an additional album beyond the ones we’d been contracted for, and now we were worth a lot more than we were when the deal was struck. So it was in our interest to get thru the deal and either renegotiate or move to another label. The album went on to be one of our biggest sellers, with well over 200,000 sold.\n\nTales From The Acoustic Planet\n\n1995\n\nFeaturing Chick Corea, Sam Bush, Bruce Hornsby, Edgar Meyer, Branford Marsalis, Jerry Douglas, Paul McCandless, Tony Rice, Matt Munde, Victor Wooten, and FutureMan\n\nLabel: Warner Brothers\n\nMy deal with Warner Brothers included the option for occasional solo albums, and it felt like it was time to exercise it. I decided to bring the acoustic side of things back to front and center, and I loved the idea of an Acoustic Planet. I wasn’t quite sure what it actually was, but it resonated. Just as we released the album, we received word that guitarist Craig Chaquico was putting out an album with the same name. I wasn’t prepared to change titles at this point and we decided to go with it anyway. I don’t think we impacted each other in any way, looking back – so we made the right decision. One highlight of this recording was the first chance to record with my hero Chick Corea, in LA. In one day we cut a track with Chick and Edgar, a duet with me and Chick, a trio with Branford and Edgar and a track with Chick, Branford, Future Man and Victor, called Backwoods Galaxy (which I guess could have been a good alternate album title actually, but maybe too Flecktone’y for my solo project). We were done recording by 3 pm… I also used this album as a way to sniff out some possible collaborators for the Flecktone’s future. Paul McCandless was a guy I was particularly interested in, and he came and played beautifully. Matt Munde from Aquarium Rescue Unit was brought in to play mandolin on some stuff after Sam Bush broke his arm playing football, I think. Tony Rice played, Bruce Hornsby and Stuart Duncan and Jerry Douglas and Edgar came too. As time went on Paul, Sam, Bruce, Stuart and Edgar all did shows guesting with the Flecktones. Paul and Sam did over a year with us each.\n\nThree Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest — Béla Fleck & The Flecktones\n\n1993\n\nTrio album with Béla Fleck, Victor Wooten and FutureMan plus guests Branford Marsalis and Bruce Hornsby\n\nLabel: Warner Brothers\n\nAt the end of 1992 after 3 nonstop years of intense touring, Howard Levy decided to leave the group. It was a tough moment, and we didn’t know if we could survive his departure, at the time. We mulled over a variety of options, and ended up going with the idea of trying the band as a trio. What could we do with less, and how could the three of us be more? We locked ourselves into my back room for a month of serious practicing and reinvention. After that, we went down to ST Thomas and did a residency at Barnacle Bill’s, where we got free pizza and a chance to try out the new material in a secluded area. The trio was a really strong period of growth for the three of us. Instead of handing all the complicated sections of songs to Howard to deal with, we had to find ways to solo through or arrange them on our own, and we got better at it. The fans accepted the change in the band, and it didn’t seem to impact our success. If anything,our audience continued to grow steadily. And though Howard was missed, I don’t remember anyone telling us they were disappointed in the trio; some folks still tell me it was their favorite period. In the studio, we did mostly trio stuff, but used the space to justify adding two of our favorite musicians as guests, Branford Marsalis and Bruce Hornsby, both of whom made wonderful contributions to our music.\n\nUFO TOFU — Béla Fleck & The Flecktones\n\n1992\n\nBéla Fleck, Howard Levy, Victor Wooten, FutureMan\n\nLabel: Warner Brothers\n\nI wrote a tune on a bus in Europe, and showed it to the guys. In those days if we had a couple of days off, we’d find a place to set up and practice. So knowing we had a day off coming, I was looking for something challenging to throw into the guy’s greedy creative maws. We were all way into Baby Gramps’ song ‘Palindromes, Palindromes, where do you roam’, which Howard turned us on to. The song had some amazing long palindromes that went way beyond the perennials like ‘Live Evil’, UFO TOFU, or even ‘Eva, can I stab bats in a cave?’. I strongly recommend that you check this song out. After I played Gramps for Chick Corea, he remarked that if he could sing, he’d want to sing like Baby Gramps. Anyway, I wondered what it might be like to take a long complicated musical line and play it forward and backwards – a musical palindrome. The guys were into the idea, and we planted several palindromes in the piece. One was a simple riff, played in both directions. One was the actual form of the piece, where the order of the sections was a palindrome too. And one was a minute long tongue twister of a line that was very challenging to play. We enjoyed that sort of thing.\n\nFlight Of The Cosmic Hippo — Béla Fleck & The Flecktones\n\n1991\n\nBéla Fleck, Howard Levy, Victor Wooten, FutureMan\n\nLabel: Warner Brothers\n\nThe Flecktones hit the road hard in 1990, now that I was no longer in NGR. Everyday at soundcheck, we worked on new ideas – so we had lots of music to record when the time came. We played the new tunes live and developed them in front of an audience, which always helped us to know when we had the arrangement right. These days we don’t do that so much. The first rough version gets so widely distributed, and people assume that it’s the final version and not a rough draft, and might judge the tune on that first run-through. Back then, the internet was newer and the downside of playing brand new music and letting people pass it around it hadn’t occurred to me. You don’t get to reveal a brand new record, when everyone already knows and has recordings of all the tunes. And they might even prefer the live early version, which is frustrating! Would Picasso put his first draft version out, or wait til he finished the painting? Moot point, we’re not Picasso. We also asked the crowd for ideas for titles, and ended up with a shopping bag full of handwritten suggestions after every show. We went through them on the bus. One day the title ‘Flight of the Codeine Hippo’ popped up on a slip of paper, and we all thought that was pretty funny – and actually sounded like the song. But we didn’t want to have drugs in the titles of our songs, not even a drug that was legal in Canada. So we let that one go. Some time later, the idea of the Cosmic Hippo occurred to me, and although at first we worried that it might be too Disney, it stuck. One of our bus driver used to always say – I like the album with the pig on it. What are you gonna do?\n\nBéla Fleck & The Flecktones\n\n1990\n\nBéla Fleck, Howard Levy, Victor Wooten, FutureMan\n\nLabel: Warner Brothers\n\nThe first Flecktones album...\n\nWhile Strength and New Grass Revival were both active and thriving, I was up to my own solo mischief. I had met Howard Levy in Chicago when he sat in with Jethro Burns – who was opening up shows for New Grass at Holstein’s. Howard was a shockingly good harmonica player, who I later found out was equally incredible on piano. We really connected at the Winnipeg Folk Festival, where we stayed up all night jamming. When Victor Wooten called me up one day and played the bass over the phone for me, it was equally impressive. He came by and we had a thrilling first jam. Into the equation arrived an offer from Dick Van Kleek, who ran the Lonesome Pine Specials TV series up in Louisville. Having already had New Grass, and Strength in Numbers up to perform, he offered me a chance to head my own show, and let me put together a ‘dream band’ for it. I immediately thought of Howard and Victor. Victor told me about his unique brother, soon to be known as Future Man, and FM rounded out the ensemble with his forward thinking drum invention, sensitive musicianship and unusual concepts. After a surprisingly strong first gig – on TV, we decided to record; I self financed the recording. I thought it was time to make a break from Rounder, and attempt to get into the majors, as several of my friends already had. After making the recording, and hearing it back – I realized that I had come to a turning point in the road, and this this was a unique chance to play my new music, and step completely outside of the bluegrass world. The right musicians only fall into place once in a blue moon, and I knew this one one of those times. I gave something like 8 months notice to New Grass Revival, and Warner Brothers picked up the album. The die was cast.\n\nDrive\n\n1988\n\nFeaturing Sam Bush, Jerry Douglas, Stuart Duncan, Mark O’Connor, Tony Rice, and Mark Schatz\n\nLabel: Rounder Records\n\nFollowing Deviation and Inroads, both fairly modern and forward leaning albums, it seemed like a good time to reconnect to my roots. After guesting on Tony Rice’s Cold on the Shoulder album, I was convinced that an instrumental band that included Tony, Sam and Jerry would be able to take my tunes – and the music in general – to an amazing new place. And I wasn’t wrong. Mark Schatz was the perfect choice for bass, Stuart Duncan and Mark O’Connor alternated on the fiddle duties and played together on a couple of tunes as well. Stuart was a brand new face in Nashville, and I loved his deep connection to an older rootsy way of playing – yet his playing is packed with startling invention. Mark continued to be what Alan O’Bryant once called the ‘Mount St Helens’ of the fiddle, with an unrelenting flood of mind boggling ideas. Having both of them was just awesome. We cut this album over a three day weekend. I remember starting on Friday and finishing on Sunday, but I could be wrong. Everything seemed to happen by itself. Ironically this album didn’t sell much at the time, although it did get a grammy nomination, it didn’t seem to be highly recognized in the Bluegrass world. However as time has gone on, this album has become one of the special ones that people still talk about. If anyone asks me what bluegrass oriented project of mine they should check out out first – it’s always Drive.\n\nNatural Bridge\n\n1982\n\nFeaturing Mark O’Connor, David Grisman, Mike Marshall, Sam Bush, Jerry Douglas, and others\n\nLabel: Rounder Records\n\nPart 1:\n\nThis album started out with a different plan altogether, which was to reunite David Grisman and Tony Rice from DGQ for some tracks with me. Mark O’Connor was excited to be back on fiddle, since he was playing guitar full time with David at the time. But it was just too soon to get David and Tony back together, and the session self combusted on the night before Schatz and I were to fly out west to record. We went back to the drawing board, Darol Anger came on fiddle, O’Connor went over to guitar and also did some spectacular double fiddling with Darol. Grisman played and Mike Marshall guested. It turned out the way it was supposed to, and I still love the tracks we recorded.\n\nPart 2:\n\nHaving become pretty good friends at this point with Jerry Douglas, he floated the idea that we make our records with similar bands, at the same time, in a studio in Ashland City, Tn. He recorded his album Tennessee Fluxedo, while I recorded the remaining tracks for Natural Bridge with Jerry, Sam Bush, Jimmy Gaudreau, Mark Schatz and David Parmely."
