        "text": "Arizona got a bit of a surprise on Saturday night when linebacker Jerry Roberts announced that he is returning for one more season. Roberts has another year of eligibility because he received a medical redshirt, regular redshirt, and an extra year due to Covid.\n\nLast season, Roberts broke his leg, but he came back strong this season and did not miss any time due to injury.\n\n\"There’s a lot of ups and downs,\" Roberts said. \"You kind of get down on yourself like ‘Am I ever going to be the same again? or ‘Will I ever run the same speed I did?’ It’s all part of, like Coach Fisch says, trusting the process.\n\n\"With my injury, that’s what I did. I trusted the entire process. I bought in and we had winter break and I stayed here the entire six weeks. I was doing everything I can to get back to my old self.”\n\nNot a subscriber?

Click here to subscribe!\n\nRoberts took on a leadership role this season and is expected to do the same with what should be a young defense next season.\n\n\"He asks me to take control of the defense and continue to lead the defense as a middle linebacker should,\" Roberts said. \"Also, show the young guys the right way to do things and continue to excel my game so I can obviously compete at the next level.”\n\nConsidering he is one of the older linebackers on the roster, Roberts has had no issues with becoming a leader.\n\n\"Being one of the older guys in the room and watching those young guys progress from the spring until now has been good,\" he said. \"We’re moving in the right direction for sure. I tell them to treat every play like a full speed play. You literally can’t take any plays off because the minute you take a play off an injury might happen or you might get blindsided.”\n\nRoberts started all 12 games at MIKE linebacker and was second on the team with 78 total tackles. He was also fourth on the team with 34 solo tackles and first on the team with 44 assisted tackles.\n\nArizona will return Roberts and freshman linebacker Jacob Manu, but is expected to be aggressive in the transfer portal. The coaching staff has already reached out to a handful of graduate transfers and when the portal opens on Monday, there will likely be more names.\n\nStill, the return of Roberts allows Arizona to have a reliable veteran and a player that is well-respected in the locker room and a voice of leadership with his teammates."
