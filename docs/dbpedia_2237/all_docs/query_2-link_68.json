Billboard, December 8, 1962, 39.\n\nHERB ALPERT'S THOUGHTS ON THE LONELY BULL\n\nAlpert told Joe Smith, \"In those days for a couple of hundred bucks, you could make a record, have it pressed, put a label on it, and put it out. If somebody bites, you either turn it over for distribution or you try to hold it for yourself and get paid for the distributors, which was pretty impossible....\"The Lonely Bull\" was one of those rarities. It took off....Basically, we were just trying to hang on.....distributors were crying out for us to put out The Lonely Bull album....However, before a distributor received one album, Jerry made sure they were all paid up on the single. That gave us operating cash, and essentially that was the beginning of A&M Records.\"\n\n[The Lonely Bull] was one of those melodies that get hold of you. If you'd heard it once, you'd wake up singing it. To me, it lent itself perfectly to trumpets playing in thirds--the Mariachi sound.\n\nI think instrumental music has to paint pictures. 'The Lonely Bull' took you to that bullring whether you lived in San Diego or Fargo, North Dakota.\n\nSOURCES:\n\nHerb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Tour Book 1966.\n\nA&M Records press release for Rise album, 1979.\n\nOFFICIAL VIDEO PERFORMANCES OF LONELY BULL SONGS\n\nSONG TITLE SHOW YEAR The Lonely Bull A&M Records Presents Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass\n\nThe Brass Are Comin' 1966\n\n1969 Never on Sunday Second Tijuana Brass television special (Kraft)\n\nThe Brass Are Comin' television special 1967\n\n1969 A Quiet Tear The Beat of the Brass television special 1968 Struttin' with Maria The Beat of the Brass television special 1968\n\nTop\n\nSOUTH OF THE BORDER\n\nSESSIONOGRAPHY\n\nAPRIL 20, 1964 GOLD STAR RECORDING STUDIOS Mexican Shuffle\n\nThe Shuffle Herb Alpert--trumpet\n\nHal Blaine--drums\n\nErvan Coleman--guitar, mandolin\n\nCarol Kaye--bass\n\nWilliam Pittman--guitar\n\nM.

The song was used in Clark Teaberry Gum television ads with actors dancing the Teaberry Shuffle.\n\nSouth Of The Borderl remastered digital album released December 4, 2015 on the Herb Alpert Presents label. On September 9, 2016, the CD was released.\n\nHERB ALPERT'S THOUGHTS\n\n[The Clark Gum Company's use of the \"Mexican Shuffle\" for its Teaberry Gum] really helped a lot. I don't know if that was the catalyst, but it certainly didn't hurt. After The Lonely Bull there was somewhat of a lull--the records didn't catch on the same way The Lonely Bull did. I did an album called South of the Border and on it was the \"Mexican Shuffle\" tune. I got a call from the ad agency handling the account and they wanted to use it as the centerpiece for a commercial. So I agreed to arrange it for them and with that exposure people started to hear that sound and more got accustomed to the Tijuana Brass sound.\n\nSouth of the Border, while I was mixing the album, I had one of those feelings. I had people knocking on the windows and coming in the doors. 'What's that record?' 'That's the Tijuana Brass. Remember us?' So I had a feeling something might be up with that record.\n\nWe did rather well with South of the Border and then it started to grow.\n\nSOURCES:\n\nMan with a Golden Horn. Richard Harrington.

It just kept haunting me. I liked the melody. There was something about it. It was like a nice cross between jazz and pop and whatever. When it came time to release a single from the album, when we took a survey, nobody liked Taste of Honey. It was one of those records that, you know, if you analyze it, everyone usually came up with it's too long, you can't really dance to it, it stops and starts in the middle, it's not right. It's not right for radio. I said I don't know if it's not right for radio but I like it, I like the feeling of it. So we released it as Taste of Honey on the back side of the single of Third Man Theme. Well, Taste of Honey became Record of the Year, became a huge record, and that was the catalyst. From that point on, I organized the Tijuana Brass and we started traveling as a group.\n\nTaste of Honey was the record that I chose to release as a single 'cause I felt when you work on a product for two, three, four, five months, this was the song I kept singing while taking a shower in the morning and at odd times it would just pop into my head. And most of the feedback that I got from playing this record to friends in the business, they felt it was not a hit record because it stopped in the middle and you couldn't dance to it and it didn't adhere to some of the rules they were looking for but yet I felt emotionally that it was a good record. Well, we put it out, and it became a huge record. In fact it won the Record of the Year ®.\n\nRight after [the Clark Teaberry Gum commercial] came a song called Whipped Cream which was a moderate hit. It was a tune that was written for Al Hirt. Al Hirt turned it down and the publisher called me; played it over the phone for me from New Orleans. I liked it very much. He sent it the next afternoon. I recorded it and my partner got the idea of taking a collection of food titles and putting them in one album.\n\nNew Playtapes in June 1968: Whipped Cream and Other Delights (Vols. 1 and 2).\n\nWhipped Cream & Other Delights was NAMM's Best Selling Album for 1966.\n\nOn May 16, 1966 Whipped Cream & Other Delights won four Grammys, the most for a West Coast record label.\n\nSOURCES:\n\nStar Track Profile 87-24, June 8, 1982.\n\nLarry King Show, June 7, 1982.\n\nOFFICIAL VIDEO PERFORMANCES OF WHIPPED CREAM SONGS\n\nSONG TITLE SHOW YEAR Lollipops and Roses First Tijuana Brass teleivision special (Singer) 1967 Love Potion #9 Second Tijuana Brass television special (Kraft) 1967 Tangerine First Tijuana Brass television special (Singer) 1967 Taste of Honey (a) A&M Records Presents Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass\n\nFirst Tijuana Brass teleivision special (Singer)\n\nThe Sentry Collection 1966\n\n1967\n\n1974 Whipped Cream First Tijuana Brass teleivision special (Singer) 1967\n\nTop\n\nGOING PLACES HISTORY\n\nThe first time the touring Tijuana Brass recorded together was July 6, 1965 on the \"Zorba the Greek\" session. The track \"Mae\" was the first time a Tijuana Brass song used strings.\n\nGoing Places had advance orders for 1.2 million copies. The pilot of the biplane on the cover was Jerry Moss.\n\nBillboard named Going Places its #3 top album for 1966. On its Top Easy Listening list \"Zorba the Greek\" was ranked 14th, \"Spanish Flea\" was #55, and \"Tijuana Taxi\" was #78.\n\nBillboard named Going Places its #9 top album for 1967.\n\nThe Tijuana Brass had caught on in Mexico, Canada, Australia and Britain. Because the group had not yet caught on in Europe, Going Places was initially released only in Britain.\n\nGoing Places produced singles that were on the Billboard Top 40 Easy Listening Chart. \"Zorba the Greek\" peaked at #5 on January 30, 1966; \"Tijuana Taxi\" at #9 on the same date; \"Third Man Theme\" at #7 on October 2, 1965 and \"Mae\" at #26 on July 10, 1965.\n\n\"Third Man Theme\" was the only single to chart on Billboard's Top Sellers in Top Markets chart. It peaked at #30 in Cleveland, #17 in Detroit, #35 in Seattle and #34 in St. Louis.\n\nImported copies of the \"Third Man Theme\" saturated Australian radio airplay. In response, Festival Records rush-released the single.\n\nThe November 7, 1965 appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show started the Billboard chart climb of all five albums. On the show the Brass played \"A Taste of Honey\" and \"Zorba the Greek.\"\n\nThe Brass ended 1965 with a total of 4 million albums sold in the U.S.\n\nAnimated film makers John and Faith Hubley created a 6-minute movie titled \"Tijuana Brass Double Feature\" that used \"Spanish Flea\" and \"Tijuana Taxi\" by the Tijuana Brass. In 1966, it won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.\n\nNew Playtapes in June 1968: Going Places (Vols. 1 and 2).\n\nHERB ALPERT'S THOUGHTS ON GOING PLACES\n\nI noticed the taxi drivers were outrageous. I mean they would bypass streets and go across fields and take shortcuts and be honking their horns and yelling out the window and it was a lot of scary fun, you know. So I got an idea to pay tribute to them.\n\nThe Going Places album was almost complete, and Jerry called to say we had advance orders for a million and a half records. Instead of being excited, I felt a little letdown. When I translated it later, it felt like, 'Hey maybe I'm making buttons here.

There were also two Herb Alpert posters from Ampex, assorted Tijuana Brass photos, easel back album covers, slick books and special order forms.\n\n\"The Beat of the Brass\" television show was shown again in Britain on March 19, 1969 by BBC 1. The show was number one in the Nielsen all-time multi-network area rating between April 22 and May 5, 1968.\n\nHERB ALPERT ON THE BEAT OF THE BRASS\n\nThe director [of my television special] Jack Haley, Jr., asked me to sing a song on the show. So I called Burt Bacharach and I asked him-this is a question I typically ask to a lot of great composers-is there a song you've written in the past that either has been recorded that didn't have the right record or a tune that's tucked away in your drawer someplace that you have a special feeling for. He thought about it, called me back the next day and handed me This Guy's in Love with You. It didn't quite fit the mood of the show. The lyric content didn't so I called Hal David and we made some changes and it was on the show and it got enormous response.\n\nIt has a magical lyric. It says, 'Who looks at you the way I do?' I mean, that covers a lot of territory and you can't say that through a trumpet.\n\nAn opinion of my own voice? Well, I guess I sing like I play-kinda natural. I've never analysed even when I play trumpet. It's just natural. It's just what comes out.\n\nBy the usual standards, I don't have a great instrument as a vocalist. But maybe there is a basic truth that comes across. If you choose good material and are honest about the arrangement and recording, you can get closer to what people are understanding today than if you just sing in a beautiful voice.\n\nSOURCES:\n\nApril Alpert Month; New LP, Tver Due.
