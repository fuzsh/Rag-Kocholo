        "text": "\"We're finally getting it done\" — Conversations In Advocacy #39\n\nOn Oct. 11 at the White House, President Trump signed the Orrin G. Hatch-Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act (MMA) into law. The historic signing ceremony was attended by musicians Jeff Baxter, Kid Rock, Mike Love, MercyMe, Sam Moore, Craig Morgan, John Rich, members of Congress including Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) and Darrell Issa (R-Ca.), Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and our own Recording Academy President/CEO Neil Portnow. President Trump gave special thanks to Portnow and concluded, \"We're finally getting it done!\"\n\n\"With the president's signature today, the Music Modernization Act is officially the law of the land,\" said Recording Academy President/CEO Neil Portnow. \"As we celebrate the harmony and unity that got us here, we applaud the efforts of the thousands of performers, songwriters, and studio professionals who rallied for historic change to ensure all music creators are compensated fairly when their work is used by digital and satellite music services. We thank the members of Congress who championed this issue throughout the past several years to bring music law into the 21st century.\"\n\nAfter years of effort leading up to this major reform of copyright law for the digital age, celebrating the occasion includes looking back while looking ahead — gratitude for unprecedented unity by industry stakeholders, deep satisfaction that a unanimous Congress worked together in a bipartisan manner to craft the law, and excitement looking ahead to marketplace incentives that will soon be put in place, making life more fair for those who rely on music for their livelihoods.\n\nThe stage was set for this turning point once the House of Representatives — having passed their version of the MMA previously — voted unanimously for final passage of the Senate's legislation, which absorbed solutions from the House bill during the Senate's drafting of their own version. To celebrate the occasion, the Recording Academy Membership's 12 Chapters across America raised their glasses in unison last week in a #ToastToMusic.\n\nIn three major \"titles,\" the MMA has benefits for everyone. The first title includes the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" rate-setting standard, helping both artists and songwriters, governing determinations for online royalties made by the Copyright Royalty Board. This also means songwriter organizations such as ASCAP and BMI will be in an improved negotiating position to secure rates that are fair in the future. Songwriters will also benefit from the mechanical licensing collection entity created by the MMA, which plans to leverage modern digital tech to administer digital rights with unprecedented transparency.\n\nThe second title closes the pre-1972 loophole that excluded legacy performers of iconic American recordings from compensation for online streams. Artists benefit from its solutions which were previously introduced by the CLASSICS Act.\n\nThe third title welcomes producers and engineers into the language of copyright law for the very first time, reflecting in statute the critical contributions these studio professionals continue to make every day. This overdue recognition was first introduced in the AMP Act.\n\nEven internet associations and digital activists have found reasons to celebrate the balanced copyright reform package embodied in the MMA, for example its clearing the way for historic Orphan Works to reach the public in unfortunate cases where creators cannot be identified. Also, the MMA's new platform for music business will end long-standing conflicts that led to lawsuits, eating up years in the courts and costing millions of dollars to litigate.\n\nFor all music fans, including the creators in our membership, access to modernized, transparent data will change the way we all learn what's out there for us to listen to, as well as what others are listening to. Thanks to the copyright reform work of industry professionals, lawmakers and outspoken advocates for music from every background, all of us can look forward to new tools and innovations given a firm basis in data.\n\nLooking ahead, Recording Academy Advocacy work on behalf of music's many creatives and professionals will continue, year round, building on this new platform of modernized copyright to lobby for additional improvements not included in the MMA omnibus. Our District Advocate day with its focus on local action will be here soon, on Oct. 24. Thousands of our members participate in \"the nation's largest grassroots advocacy movement for music.\" The pride and gratitude inspired by today's turning point will no doubt still feel fresh.\n\nThank Your Lawmakers For Completing This Historic Achievement\n\nIn his testimony, Abbott pointed out that while Texas law currently recognizes property rights to an individual's name, voice, and likeness after death, it fails to protect living creators. He urged Texas lawmakers to pass strong protections to safeguard human creativity. “AI fakes don’t care if you’re famous, an actor, a recording artist, or even if you’re alive or dead. AI frauds and deepfakes can impact everyone. False and unauthorized depictions driven by digital technology can destroy relationships, businesses, public trust, livelihoods and legacies.”\n\nWhile at the state capitol, Abbott found time to meet with a number of lawmakers working on AI issues. When the legislature reconvenes in early 2025 for the state’s 89th legislative session, the Recording Academy anticipates that there could be active legislation around AI policy.\n\nCalifornia's Cultural Economy and Artist Protections\n\nIn California, advocacy efforts were equally vibrant. On August 16th, Qiana Conley Akinro, Senior Executive Director of the Recording Academy’s Los Angeles Chapter, took a stand at the California Assembly Select Committee on Downtown Recovery during a field hearing on “Revitalizing Struggling Downtowns Through Arts, Culture, and Entertainment” in San Diego.\n\nConley Akinro discussed the impact the Recording Academy members have in California along with the overall value of arts and culture to the state’s economy. Music, alone, contributes $39.5 billion to the state’s GDP according to research by the RIAA, the Otis College Report on the Creative Economy found that 7.6 percent of all jobs in California are tied to creative industries.\n\nConley Akinro also spoke about the critical importance of legislative protections for artists against unauthorized AI duplicates. Specifically, she highlighted the significance of the Recording Academy-endorsed Assembly Bill 1836, which seeks to extend California's \"Right to Publicity\" law to deceased individuals, preventing their likeness from being exploited without consent. This bill, she argued, is just as crucial for living artists, particularly in the age of AI.\n\n“As artists embrace the potential for innovation with Artificial Intelligence, it’s crucial that there are effective guardrails in place that preserve the essence of human creativity,\" she testified. \"No challenge is more pressing than the rapid growth of AI-generated digital replicas that impersonate an individual’s distinct image, likeness, or voice without consent or compensation.” She urged the state senate to pass the bill, which has already cleared the Assembly.\n\nGeorgia and Virginia Look Forward\n\nMeanwhile, Georgia is contemplating new legislation inspired by Tennessee’s Ensuring Likeness Voice and Image Security (ELVIS) Act. On August 14th, Georgia Senate Committee on Artificial Intelligence Chair John Albers discussed the potential adoption of similar protections that include stronger guardrails on regenerative AI.\n\nRead more: How The House's No AI FRAUD Act And Tenn.'s ELVIS Act Will Protect Human Creativity\n\nThe law endorsed by the Recording Academy in Tennessee safeguards an individual's voice against misuse and imposes liability on companies that offer tools capable of replicating someone's voice or likeness. Given the state's vibrant creative industries, Georgia could become the third state to adopt similar protective legislation.\n\nVirginia also took steps to potentially address AI concerns. On August 20th, Recording Academy’s Managing Director of State and Federal Advocacy Michael Lewan participated in a virtual roundtable on AI hosted by Virginia Delegate Jackie Glass. The discussion, which included Delegate Michelle Maldonado, focused on AI’s implications for the music industry. Both delegates discussed the potential to introduce comprehensive legislation in 2025 to safeguard Virginians against AI misuse.\n\nLooking Ahead to Music Advocacy Day\n\nAs the summer advocacy efforts wrap up, the Recording Academy is gearing up for its 10th Music Advocacy Day on October 1st. This event will provide members nationwide with the opportunity to engage directly with their congressional representatives, continuing the push for meaningful protections for music creators in the face of evolving technological challenges.\n\nFor more details and to participate in the upcoming Music Advocacy Day, members can register here.\n\nMusic Advocacy Day Returns to Mark a Decade of Influencing Policy for Music Creators\n\nOver the past couple of weeks, the music community has lost two formidable advocates and friends of the Recording Academy: Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee and Abdul “Duke” Fakir. Both were passionate champions for creators' rights and made significant contributions to the music ecosystem, leaving it better than they found it. Their legacies will continue to inspire future generations of music advocates.\n\nSheila Jackson Lee\n\nFor nearly 30 years, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee championed music policy on Capitol Hill. Sworn into the House of Representatives in 1995 to represent Texas’ 18th congressional district, which includes much of inner-city Houston, she was known for her strong advocacy on civil rights, healthcare, education, and social justice issues. Jackson Lee's influence extended to the House Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees, and her legislative efforts significantly impacted music activism, artists' rights, and fair compensation in the digital age.\n\nA reliable champion for the Recording Academy’s Texas chapter, Jackson Lee frequently met with members both in their districts and on Capitol Hill. She collaborated with the Recording Academy to help immortalize the legacy of gospel music and was instrumental in various legislative initiatives:\n\nIn 2017, Jackson Lee reestablished the long-dormant Congressional Jazz Caucus, advocating for the economic and cultural development of the jazz community.\n\nShe introduced The National Jazz Preservation, Education, and Promulgation Act, aiming to preserve knowledge and promote education about jazz in the United States and abroad.\n\nJackson Lee introduced H.Con.Res 370, designating September as Gospel Music Heritage Month. She noted, “Gospel music is a historical American art form that has spanned hundreds of generations and both inspires and entertains across racial, ethnic, religious, and geographic boundaries. We must officially recognize the great contributions to American culture that have derived from the rich heritage of gospel music and its artists.”\n\nAn original cosponsor of the Music Modernization Act (MMA), Jackson Lee supported the legislation that updated copyright law, making it easier for artists to receive royalties from streaming services and ensuring more accurate payments to songwriters and producers.\n\nAbdul “Duke” Fakir\n\nAbdul \"Duke\" Fakir, born on December 26, 1935, in Detroit, Michigan, was a celebrated American singer best known as a founding member of the legendary Motown group The Four Tops. Known for hits like \"I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)\" and \"Reach Out I'll Be There,\" The Four Tops played an instrumental role in shaping R&B music. Fakir, the last surviving original member of The Four Tops, ensured the group’s legacy endured in the music industry. His career spanned over six decades, earning numerous awards and accolades, including induction into the GRAMMY Hall of Fame in 1998 and receiving a GRAMMY Lifetime Achievement Award in 2009.\n\nFakir's advocacy work was incredibly impactful:\n\nServing on the Artist Rights Alliance’s Music Council, Fakir fought for an economically fair digital landscape for creators.\n\nIn 2017, Fakir joined the Recording Academy in Washington for GRAMMYs on the Hill, advocating for music licensing reform.\n\nFakir was a fierce advocate for performance rights for sound recordings broadcast on AM/FM radio. In 2016, he joined with the musicFIRST Coalition in D.C. to advocate for the Fair Play Fair Pay Act, which would establish a performance right for artists on radio.\n\nHe was also a leader in calling on Congress to fix the pre-72 loophole, which was addressed by the passage of the Music Modernization Act in 2018. Prior to the MMA, sound recordings released before 1972 did not receive any digital royalties. Since the passage of the MMA, legacy artists like Fakir and their estates have begun to receive fair compensation for their classic works played by services like SiriusXM and Pandora.\n\nDuring GRAMMYs on the Hill in 2017, Fakir told WTOP News, \"Ever since [we first started having records] I’ve been fighting for performance rights, not just for me, a singer, but for musicians, for everyone who’s on the record...they’re all a part of the creation.”\n\nAs we remember Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee and Duke Fakir, we honor their contributions and unwavering commitment to the music industry. Their legacies will continue to resonate, inspiring future generations of music advocates to carry forward their mission for a fair and equitable music ecosystem.\n\nIn a landmark victory for songwriters, the U.S. Copyright Office issued a new rule on July 10 that ensures songwriters who reclaim their works from their publishers will also receive streaming royalties for those works through The Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC).\n\nRecording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. spoke on the ruling: \"After years of engagement and activism on this issue, the Academy applauds the Copyright Office for protecting the rights of songwriters and affirming their ability to receive appropriate compensation after reclaiming their copyrights. We also thank our friends in the music community for their partnership and collaboration as we fought for this important victory.\"\n\nSongwriters often sign over the copyright to their music to publishers who then promote, license, and monetize their work. By law, songwriters have \"termination rights\" which allow them to end their publisher agreement and regain their copyrights after a period of time under certain conditions.\n\nHowever, the MLC — which administers a blanket license for streaming platforms to use songs — initially determined that royalties generated from streams would continue to go to the license holder at the time a song is uploaded to a streaming service rather than to the current copyright owner at the time a song is streamed.\n\nStarting back in 2020, the Recording Academy, along with other songwriter groups, opposed this practice as it undermined the purpose of termination rights, which exist to level the playing field for songwriters and other creators who may have entered into unfavorable deals.\n\nSince 2020, the Recording Academy held multiple ex parte meetings with the Copyright Office to discuss the impacts of the MLC's determination, and submitted formal comments and reply comments throughout the Office's rulemaking proceedings.\n\nIn stating its position, the Academy argued its belief that termination rights are among the most important protections that songwriters, artists, and other creators have for their work. The Academy also urged the USCO to avoid weakening or infringing on these protections.\n\nThe U.S. Copyright Office has since agreed with the Recording Academy and deemed the MLC's decision an \"erroneous\" rule, stating that if a songwriter reclaims the copyright to their music, they should receive the royalties. And after multiple years of rulemaking, the Copyright Office published a final rule last week directing the MLC to distribute royalty payments in accordance with the Copyright Act.\n\nThe rule:\n\nDirects the MLC to make future royalty payments to the copyright holder at the time a stream is played.\n\nDirects the MLC to engage in a \"corrective adjustment\" process to address any overpayments made due to the erroneous rule.\n\nThe Recording Academy is proud to champion ownership rights for songwriters and to amplify the voices of small creators.
