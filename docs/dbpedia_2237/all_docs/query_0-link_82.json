        "text": "Although Jerry Wexler of Billboard magazine is credited with coining the term \"rhythm and blues\" as a musical term in the United States in 1948, the term was used in Billboard as early as 1943. It replaced the term \"race music\", which originally came from within the black community, but was deemed offensive in the postwar world. The term \"rhythm and blues\" was used by Billboard in its chart listings from June 1949 until August 1969, when its \"Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles\" chart was renamed as \"Best Selling Soul Singles\". Before the \"Rhythm and Blues\" name was instated, various record companies had already begun replacing the term \"race music\" with \"sepia series\".\n\nIn the early 1950s, the term \"rhythm & blues\" was frequently applied to blues records. Writer and producer Robert Palmer defined rhythm & blues as \"a catchall term referring to any music that was made by and for black Americans\". He has used the term \"R&B\" as a synonym for jump blues. However, AllMusic separates it from jump blues because of R&B's stronger gospel influences. Lawrence Cohn, author of Nothing but the Blues, writes that \"rhythm and blues\" was an umbrella term invented for industry convenience. According to him, the term embraced all black music except classical music and religious music, unless a gospel song sold enough to break into the charts. Well into the 21st century, the term R&B continues in use (in some contexts) to categorize music made by black musicians, as distinct from styles of music made by other musicians.\n\nIn the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, and saxophone. Arrangements were rehearsed to the point of effortlessness and were sometimes accompanied by background vocalists. Simple repetitive parts mesh, creating momentum and rhythmic interplay producing mellow, lilting, and often hypnotic textures while calling attention to no individual sound. While singers are emotionally engaged with the lyrics, often intensely so, they remain cool, relaxed, and in control. The bands dressed in suits, and even uniforms, a practice associated with the modern popular music that rhythm and blues performers aspired to dominate. Lyrics often seemed fatalistic, and the music typically followed predictable patterns of chords and structure.\n\nOne publication of the Smithsonian Institution provided this summary of the origins of the genre in 2016.\n\n\"A distinctly African American music drawing from the deep tributaries of African American expressive culture, it is an amalgam of jump blues, big band swing, gospel, boogie, and blues that was initially developed during a thirty-year period that bridges the era of legally sanctioned racial segregation, international conflicts, and the struggle for civil rights\".\n\nThe term \"rock and roll\" had a strong sexual connotation in jump blues and R&B, but when DJ Alan Freed referred to rock and roll on mainstream radio in the mid-1950s, \"the sexual component had been dialed down enough that it simply became an acceptable term for dancing\".\n\nAfrican American music began incorporating Afro-Cuban rhythmic motifs in the 1800s with the popularity of the Cuban contradanza (known outside of Cuba as the habanera). The habanera rhythm can be thought of as a combination of tresillo and the backbeat.\n\nFor the more than a quarter-century in which the cakewalk, ragtime and proto-jazz were forming and developing, the Cuban genre habanera exerted a constant presence in African American popular music. Jazz pioneer Jelly Roll Morton considered the tresillo/habanera rhythm (which he called the Spanish tinge) to be an essential ingredient of jazz. There are examples of tresillo-like rhythms in some African American folk music such as the hand-clapping and foot-stomping patterns in ring shout, post-Civil War drum and fife music, and New Orleans second line music. Wynton Marsalis considers tresillo to be the New Orleans \"clave\" (although technically, the pattern is only half a clave). Tresillo is the most basic duple-pulse rhythmic cell in Sub-Saharan African music traditions, and its use in African American music is one of the clearest examples of African rhythmic retention in the United States. The use of tresillo was continuously reinforced by the consecutive waves of Cuban music, which were adopted into North American popular culture. In 1940 Bob Zurke released \"Rhumboogie\", a boogie-woogie with a tresillo bass line, and lyrics proudly declaring the adoption of Cuban rhythm:\n\nHarlem's got a new rhythm, man it's burning up the dance floors because it's so hot! They took a little rhumba rhythm and added boogie-woogie and now look what they got! Rhumboogie, it's Harlem's new creation with the Cuban syncopation, it's the killer! Just plant your both feet on each side. Let both your hips and shoulder glide. Then throw your body back and ride. There's nothing like rhumbaoogie, rhumboogie, boogie-woogie. In Harlem or Havana, you can kiss the old Savannah. It's a killer!\n\nAlthough originating in the metropolis at the mouth of the Mississippi River, New Orleans blues, with its Afro-Caribbean rhythmic traits, is distinct from the sound of the Mississippi Delta blues. In the late 1940s, New Orleans musicians were especially receptive to Cuban influences precisely at the time when R&B was first forming. The first use of tresillo in R&B occurred in New Orleans. Robert Palmer recalls:\n\nNew Orleans producer-bandleader Dave Bartholomew first employed this figure (as a saxophone-section riff) on his own 1949 disc \"Country Boy\" and subsequently helped make it the most over-used rhythmic pattern in 1950s rock 'n' roll. On numerous recordings by Fats Domino, Little Richard and others, Bartholomew assigned this repeating three-note pattern not just to the string bass, but also to electric guitars and even baritone sax, making for a very heavy bottom. He recalls first hearing the figure – as a bass pattern on a Cuban disc.\n\nIn a 1988 interview with Palmer, Bartholomew (who had the first R&B studio band), revealed how he initially superimposed tresillo over swing rhythm:\n\nI heard the bass playing that part on a 'rumba' record. On 'Country Boy' I had my bass and drums playing a straight swing rhythm and wrote out that 'rumba' bass part for the saxes to play on top of the swing rhythm. Later, especially after rock 'n' roll came along, I made the 'rumba' bass part heavier and heavier. I'd have the string bass, an electric guitar and a baritone all in unison.\n\nBartholomew referred to the Cuban son by the misnomer rumba, a common practice of that time. Fats Domino's \"Blue Monday\", produced by Bartholomew, is another example of this now classic use of tresillo in R&B. Bartholomew's 1949 tresillo-based \"Oh Cubanas\" is an attempt to blend African American and Afro-Cuban music. The word mambo, larger than any of the other text, is placed prominently on the record label. In his composition \"Misery\", New Orleans pianist Professor Longhair plays a habanera-like figure in his left hand. The deft use of triplets is a characteristic of Longhair's style.\n\nGerhard Kubik notes that with the exception of New Orleans, early blues lacked complex polyrhythms, and there was a \"very specific absence of asymmetric time-line patterns (key patterns) in virtually all early-twentieth-century African American music ... only in some New Orleans genres does a hint of simple time line patterns occasionally appear in the form of transient so-called 'stomp' patterns or stop-time chorus. These do not function in the same way as African timelines.\" In the late 1940s, this changed somewhat when the two-celled time line structure was brought into the blues. New Orleans musicians such as Bartholomew and Longhair incorporated Cuban instruments, as well as the clave pattern and related two-celled figures in songs such as \"Carnival Day\", (Bartholomew 1949) and \"Mardi Gras In New Orleans\" (Longhair 1949). While some of these early experiments were awkward fusions, the Afro-Cuban elements were eventually integrated fully into the New Orleans sound.\n\nRobert Palmer reports that, in the 1940s, Professor Longhair listened to and played with musicians from the islands and \"fell under the spell of Perez Prado's mambo records.\" He was especially enamored with Afro-Cuban music. Michael Campbell states: \"Professor Longhair's influence was ... far-reaching. In several of his early recordings, Professor Longhair blended Afro-Cuban rhythms with rhythm and blues. The most explicit is 'Longhair's Blues Rhumba,' where he overlays a straightforward blues with a clave rhythm.\" Longhair's particular style was known locally as rumba-boogie. In his \"Mardi Gras in New Orleans\", the pianist employs the 2–3 clave onbeat/offbeat motif in a rumba boogie \"guajeo\".\n\nThe syncopated, but straight subdivision feel of Cuban music (as opposed to swung subdivisions) took root in New Orleans R&B during this time. Alexander Stewart states that the popular feel was passed along from \"New Orleans—through James Brown's music, to the popular music of the 1970s,\" adding: \"The singular style of rhythm & blues that emerged from New Orleans in the years after World War II played an important role in the development of funk. In a related development, the underlying rhythms of American popular music underwent a basic, yet the generally unacknowledged transition from triplet or shuffle feel to even or straight eighth notes. Concerning the various funk motifs, Stewart states that this model \"... is different from a time line (such as clave and tresillo) in that it is not an exact pattern, but more of a loose organizing principle.\"\n\nJohnny Otis released the R&B mambo \"Mambo Boogie\" in January 1951, featuring congas, maracas, claves, and mambo saxophone guajeos in a blues progression. Ike Turner recorded \"Cubano Jump\" (1954) an electric guitar instrumental, which is built around several 2–3 clave figures, adopted from the mambo. The Hawketts, in \"Mardi Gras Mambo\" (1955) (featuring the vocals of a young Art Neville), make a clear reference to Perez Prado in their use of his trademark \"Unhh!\" in the break after the introduction.\n\nNed Sublette states: \"The electric blues cats were very well aware of Latin music, and there was definitely such a thing as rhumba blues; you can hear Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf playing it.\" He also cites Otis Rush, Ike Turner and Ray Charles, as R&B artists who employed this feel.\n\nThe use of clave in R&B coincided with the growing dominance of the backbeat, and the rising popularity of Cuban music in the U.S. In a sense, clave can be distilled down to tresillo (three-side) answered by the backbeat (two-side).\n\nThe \"Bo Diddley beat\" (1955) is perhaps the first true fusion of 3–2 clave and R&B/rock 'n' roll. Bo Diddley has given different accounts of the riff's origins. Sublette asserts: \"In the context of the time, and especially those maracas [heard on the record], 'Bo Diddley' has to be understood as a Latin-tinged record. A rejected cut recorded at the same session was titled only 'Rhumba' on the track sheets.\" Johnny Otis's \"Willie and the Hand Jive\" (1958) is another example of this successful blend of 3–2 claves and R&B. Otis used the Cuban instruments claves and maracas on the song.\n\nAfro-Cuban music was the conduit by which African American music was \"re-Africanized\", through the adoption of two-celled figures like clave and Afro-Cuban instruments like the conga drum, bongos, maracas and claves. According to John Storm Roberts, R&B became the vehicle for the return of Cuban elements into mass popular music. Ahmet Ertegun, producer for Atlantic Records, is reported to have said that \"Afro-Cuban rhythms added color and excitement to the basic drive of R&B.\" As Ned Sublette points out though: \"By the 1960s, with Cuba the object of a United States embargo that still remains in effect today, the island nation had been forgotten as a source of music. By the time people began to talk about rock and roll as having a history, Cuban music had vanished from North American consciousness.\"\n\nAfrican American music began incorporating Afro-Cuban rhythmic motifs in the 1800s with the popularity of the Cuban contradanza (known outside of Cuba as the habanera). The habanera rhythm can be thought of as a combination of tresillo and the backbeat.\n\nAt first, only African Americans were buying R&B discs. According to Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records, sales were localized in African-American markets; there were no white sales or white radio play. During the early 1950s, more white teenagers started to become aware of R&B and began purchasing the music. For example, 40% of 1952 sales at Dolphin's of Hollywood record shop, located in an African-American area of Los Angeles, were to whites. Eventually, white teens across the country turned their musical taste toward rhythm and blues.\n\nJohnny Otis, who had signed with the Newark, New Jersey-based Savoy Records, produced many R&B hits in 1951, including \"Double Crossing Blues\", \"Mistrustin' Blues\" and \"Cupid's Boogie\", all of which hit number one that year. Otis scored ten top ten hits that year. Other hits include \"Gee Baby\", \"Mambo Boogie\" and \"All Nite Long\". The Clovers, a quintet consisting of a vocal quartet with accompanying guitarist, sang a distinctive-sounding combination of blues and gospel, had the number five hit of the year with \"Don't You Know I Love You\" on Atlantic. Also in July 1951, Cleveland, Ohio DJ Alan Freed started a late-night radio show called \"The Moondog Rock Roll House Party\" on WJW (850 AM). Freed's show was sponsored by Fred Mintz, whose R&B record store had a primarily African American clientele. Freed began referring to the rhythm and blues music he played as \"rock and roll\".\n\nIn 1951, Little Richard Penniman began recording for RCA Records in the jump blues style of late 1940s stars Roy Brown and Billy Wright. However, it was not until he recorded a demo in 1954 that caught the attention of Specialty Records that the world would start to hear his new uptempo funky rhythm and blues that would catapult him to fame in 1955 and help define the sound of rock 'n' roll. A rapid succession of rhythm and blues hits followed, beginning with \"Tutti Frutti\" and \"Long Tall Sally\", which would influence performers such as James Brown, Elvis Presley, and Otis Redding.\n\nRuth Brown, performing on the Atlantic label, placed hits in the top five every year from 1951 through 1954: \"Teardrops from My Eyes\", \"Five, Ten, Fifteen Hours\", \"(Mama) He Treats Your Daughter Mean\" and \"What a Dream\". Faye Adams's \"Shake a Hand\" made it to number two in 1952. In 1953, the R&B record-buying public made Willie Mae Thornton's original recording of Leiber and Stoller's \"Hound Dog\" the year's number three hit. Ruth Brown was very prominent among female R&B stars; her popularity most likely came from \"her deeply rooted vocal delivery in African American tradition\" That same year The Orioles, a doo-wop group, had the number four hit of the year with \"Crying in the Chapel\".\n\nFats Domino made the top 30 of the pop charts in 1952 and 1953, then the top 10 with \"Ain't That a Shame\". Ray Charles came to national prominence in 1955 with \"I Got a Woman\". Big Bill Broonzy said of Charles's music: \"He's mixing the blues with the spirituals ... I know that's wrong.\"\n\nIn 1954 the Chords' \"Sh-Boom\" became the first hit to cross over from the R&B chart to hit the top 10 early in the year. Late in the year, and into 1955, \"Hearts of Stone\" by the Charms made the top 20.\n\nAt Chess Records in the spring of 1955, Bo Diddley's debut record \"Bo Diddley\"/\"I'm a Man\" climbed to number two on the R&B charts and popularized Bo Diddley's own original rhythm and blues clave-based vamp that would become a mainstay in rock and roll.\n\nAt the urging of Leonard Chess at Chess Records, Chuck Berry reworked a country fiddle tune with a long history, entitled \"Ida Red\". The resulting \"Maybellene\" was not only a number three hit on the R&B charts in 1955, but also reached into the top 30 on the pop charts. Alan Freed, who had moved to the much larger market of New York City in 1954, helped the record become popular with white teenagers. Freed had been given part of the writing credit by Chess in return for his promotional activities, a common practice at the time.\n\nR&B was also a strong influence on rock and roll according to many sources, including an article in the Wall Street Journal in 1985 titled, \"Rock! It's Still Rhythm and Blues\". In fact, the author stated that the \"two terms were used interchangeably\" until about 1957. The other sources quoted in the article said that rock and roll combined R&B with pop and country music.\n\nFats Domino was not convinced that there was any new genre. In 1957, he said, \"What they call rock 'n' roll now is rhythm and blues. I’ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans\". According to Rolling Stone, \"this is a valid statement ... all Fifties rockers, black and white, country born and city bred, were fundamentally influenced by R&B, the black popular music of the late Forties and early Fifties\"."
