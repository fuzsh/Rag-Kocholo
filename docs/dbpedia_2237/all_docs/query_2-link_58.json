        "text": "Warning: Watching Felix the Cat may not be for everyone. Side effects include laughing so much that your sides might ache and your heart may go pitter-pat. Ask your doctor if Felix the Cat is the wonderful, wonderful cat for you.\n\nFELIX THE CAT\n\nOriginal TV Sound Tracks\n\nCricket Records (Pickwick) CR-28 (12” 33 1/3 rpm / Mono / 1959 / 22 minutes)\n\nAlbum Producer: Ralph Stein. Writers: Joe Sabo, Joe Stultz. TV Series Executive Producer: Pat Sullivan. Producer/Director: Joe Oriolo. Directors: Jim Tyer, Stephen Muffatti, Reuben Grossman, Frank Endres. Music: Winston Sharples (Famous Studios stock). Special Effects: E. Pomponio. Editor: Fred White.\n\nVoices: Mason Adams (Narrator); Jack Mercer (Felix, Rock Bottom, The Professor).\n\nSong: “Felix the Cat” by Winston Sharples.\n\nCartoons:\n\n“The Thinking Hat” (Title on DVD Set: “Detective Thinking Hat”)\n\nFelix’s Uncle Perlock Jones sends him a detective hat. At one point, Rock finds himself in a movie theater showing a Felix TV cartoon, theme and all.\n\n“The Great Rubber Racket” (Title on DVD Set: “Balloon Blower Machine”)\n\nFelix trails Rock to The Professor’s lab, where they’re stealing rubber.\n\n“Hard Luck Rock!” (Title on DVD Set: “Friday the 13th”)\n\nSuperstitious Rock blames his bad luck on Felix.\n\n“The Money Tree”\n\n(See “Give a Little Listen” below)\n\nSorry, couldn’t resist the disclaimer above! Much as I love the 1959-60 TV version of Felix the Cat, neither my sides nor heart reacted as much as the iconic theme song promised when I watched the show. Nevertheless, these cartoons are among the very first I remember from my earliest childhood. I even love the “Saran Wrap” around Felix’s head in the theme sequence. Jerry’s recent post about Felix inspired this look at some Felix on vinyl.\n\nThis is one of the few Cricket Records that is a bonafide original soundtrack recording (still having nightmares about their rendition of “Yogi Bear?”). Producer Ralph Stein may have watched several episodes and chosen them for their adaptability to records. But unlike the Mr. Magoo soundtracks he also produced for records, Felix the Cat has narration by the venerable announcer Mason Adams, the voice of Smuckers jams and Charlie Hume on the Lou Grant TV series.\n\nMy guess is that Stein took notes during the screening of the cartoons—or used a tape recorder to take down all his comments (that’s what I would have done). Then they were transcribed and Adams read them in a studio. Some of his narration anticipates the action, so it’s likely that his recordings were edited to fit within the spaces between dialogue bits. Some of his narration overlaps, but overall it works fairly well. It’s a cross between sports announcing, DVD commentary and the descriptive audio provided on some films and shows for the sight-impaired.\n\nWho sings the famous Felix theme? I nominate Dottie Evans, who recorded children’s records for virtually all the major and minor labels in the ‘50s and early ‘60s. Some of many recordings include Songs from Walt Disney’s Magic Kingdom, Captain Kangaroo (Columbia), The Tootlepiper’s Zoo, The Tootlepiper’s Circus (RCA) and A Child’s Introduction to the Nutcracker Suite (Golden).\n\nGIVE A LITTLE LISTEN\n\n“The Money Tree”\n\nFelix does a magic show in which he produces a money tree, Rock wants to steal it by pretending to be a tree doctor (with Wimpy’s voice) and seals Felix in a tree trunk. In part two, the Professor forces Felix to tell Rock and him the secret. I picked this one because Adam’s narration eventually sounds like he’s announcing a prizefight!\n\nFELIX THE CAT / FELIX AND HIS FRIENDS\n\nPeter Pan Records / Mono / 1959 / 10 minutes\n\n#538 (7” 45 RPM); #492 (7” 78 RPM)\n\nProducer/Writer: Don Cope. Narrator: Ken Roberts.\n\nSongs: “Felix the Cat” by Don Cope.\n\nPeter Pan went with a completely different theme song (a parody of “Pop! Goes the Weasel”), but offered quite a bit of story material for a single record and a nicely orchestrated little score. It’s nice to see Felix buying his own record at the store, too.\n\nInstead of Felix tangling with characters from the TV series, on this record he’s more of an “agony aunt” or “Dear Abby” to whom the animals come with their problems. Each animal sings a parody of a public domain song: Billy the Goat’s song uses the melody of “The Farmer in the Dell,” Hector the Horse’s is “Reuben, Reuben,” Harriet the Hen’s is “Turkey in the Straw” and Benny the Bunny’s is also “The Farmer in the Dell.”\n\nThe most notable thing about this record is the narrator/voice of Felix. He’s legendary announcer Ken Roberts, whose radio career goes all the way back to 1930. He was the announcer for some very popular, decades-long soap operas including The Secret Storm and Love of Life. He was also the father of actor Tony Roberts (Annie Hall, The Million Dollar Duck).\n\nGIVE A LITTLE LISTEN\n\n“Felix and His Friends”\n\nIf Ken Roberts sounds familiar, maybe it’s because he narrated one of TV’s greatest—and funniest— “shows-within-a-show:” Love of Chair. Created by Paul Dooley when he was head writer for the children’s TV classic The Electric Company, it was a relentlessly endless continuing “drama” about a boy in a chair in a room (“Will the boy get out of the chair? Will the chair get out from under the boy? And…what about Naomi?”)"
