        "text": "Early in the recording sessions for 5ive O’Clock Charlie’s fourth album, producer and recording engineer Jeremy Stephens didn’t think they had enough rockers. And he told the Huntsville band’s singer, guitarist and songwriter Mike Roberts just that.\n\n“The had four or five songs in the can,” Stephens says, “and they were really great songs. They’re typical Mike Roberts. Very well written and they’re very deep lyrically. They say a lot. But I felt in addition to that they needed to add a couple of, you know, ass-shakers. And I think it kind of pissed him off a little bit, like I didn’t like his songs. But I didn’t mean that at all.”"
