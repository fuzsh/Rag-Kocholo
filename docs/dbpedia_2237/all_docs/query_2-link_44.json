        "text": "The songs are default sorted alphabetically by title.\n\nYou can change the sort using the Sort By Title Button. You can also click the column heads for the Number and Title to sort ascending / descending. Please be aware the number is a “text” field so number 1002 would come before number 110.\n\nYou can filter the results by Recording Artist, Release Year, and Recording Type.\n\nYou can combine filters and sorts. For example, if you wanted to see all of Jerry Story’s songs in alphabetical order, choose “Jerry Story” from the Recording Artist filter, then choose “Sort By Title A – Z.”\n\nAdditionally, you can toggle “New Releases” to see our most recent music.\n\nTo purchase, click the “Add To Cart” button, make your way to the Checkout page, and pay for your purchase. Within minutes you’ll receive an email with download links to the music you purchased."
