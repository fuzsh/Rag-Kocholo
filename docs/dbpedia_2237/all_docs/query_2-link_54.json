Across the ten tracks of the album, the band dance between convention and experimentation, taking left-turns and detours that heighten the rich imagery and emotion in Cave's soul-stirring narratives. It is the sound of a group emboldened by reconnection and taking flight. There are moments that touch fondly upon the Bad Seeds' past but they are fleeting, and serve only to imbue the relentless and restless forward motion of the band. Produced by Cave and Warren Ellis, and mixed by David Fridmann, Cave began writing the album in 2023. With sessions at Miraval in Provence and Soundtree in London, the Bad Seeds added their unique alchemy, with additional performances from Colin Greenwood (bass) and Luis Almau (nylon string guitar, acoustic guitar). \"Wild God... there's no fucking around with this record. When it hits, it hits. It lifts you. It moves you. I love that about it,\" says Nick Cave.\n\nUpcoming Event\n\nQuick View\n\nToro Y Moi\n\nHole Erth [Colored Vinyl]\n\nVinyl: $22.99 PREORDER\n\nHole Erth, Chaz Bear's eighth full-length studio record as Toro y Moi, is the genre shapeshifter's most unexpected and bold move to date, with Bear diving headlong into rap-rock, Soundcloud rap and Y2K emo. The album blitzes anthemic pop-punk next to autotuned, melancholic rap - two genres that inform one another now more than ever before - and packs in the most features ever on a Toro y Moi album. A sense of nostalgia sneaks it's way into almost every Toro y Moi release, but angst is an emotion that Bear has never intentionally explored the way he does here. Tracks like \"Tuesday' channel a specific, yet forever-relatable sense of adolescent unease. A distorted guitar riff leads into a repeating chorus that conjures misunderstood teenagers singing aloud, maybe too loud, while riding bikes through American suburbs. This foreboding can also be heard on \"HOV,\" though not without poking some fun with lines like \"Romance is so cold / My advice? To bring a coat.\" Bear has the energy, but is acutely aware that his energy isn't forever. At a time when the internet is blending multiple genres into one at an increasingly rapid pace, Bear accomplishes the rare feat of keeping up with the contemporary alternative listener. Constantly changing, evolving and experimenting is the heart of Toro y Moi, and on Hole Erth Bear challenges but also reclaims himself, embracing the myriad sounds and eras that formed him, while crashing new worlds together.\n\nQuick View\n\nFoster The People\n\nParadise State Of Mind [Indie Exclusive Translucent Pink Vinyl]\n\nVinyl: $22.99 PREORDER\n\nQuick View\n\nGreen Day\n\nAmerican Idiot 20th Anniversary - Deluxe Edition [Indie Exclusive One-Step Edition 2 LP]\n\nVinyl: $124.98 PREORDER\n\nGreen Days seventh studio album American Idiot was released in September 2004 and has since sold over 23 million copies worldwide, including 9 million in the US.

The winds of change were blowing through Wayne Shorter's life and career in 1970. The saxophonist had just left Miles Davis' group and was soon to form his collective fusion band Weather Report. His music was evolving too as he began to delve into his own unique fusion explorations on his previous two Blue Note recordings Super Nova and Moto Grosso Feio. Recorded in August 1970, the mesmerizing Odyssey of Iska would be the last release of Shorter's early Blue Note period. The album was a tribute to his daughter Iska-who had been born the year before with severe brain damage-with four immersive Shorter compositions portraying a variety of moods: \"Wind,\" \"Storm,\" \"Calm,\" and \"Joy.\" The album's centerpiece is an extended version of Bobby Thomas' Brazilian influenced piece \"De Pois do Amor, o Vazio\" (After Love, Emptiness), foreshadowing Shorter's growing interest in Brazilian music which he would explore further in the years to come. Shorter's soprano and tenor saxophones are the lone horns heard on the album which featured Gene Bertoncini on guitar, David Friedman on vibraphone and marimba, Ron Carter and Cecil McBee on bass, and Alphonse Mouzon, Billy Hart, and Frank Cuomo contributing drums and percussion.\n\nQuick View\n\nOrville Peck\n\nStampede [CD]\n\nCD: $13.99 Buy\n\nCritically acclaimed, Orville Peck has long dreamed of making Stampede, a duets album with singers, songwriters, and fellow musicians hes long admired.

Starting out as pioneers of the SoundCloud Rap movement, they have gone on to deliver a tremendous amount of music and have achieved over 20 billion all-time streams, placing them in the Top 100 streaming artists of all time. In 2023, they were one of Spotifys Top Groups of 2023 and one of SoundClouds Top 5 Most Streamed Artists.\n\nNEW WORLD DEPRESSION delves deep into a tumultuous psyche, portraying a world riddled with inner demons, existential crises, and a stark defiance of societal norms. Throughout the album, the duo navigates through themes of fame, self-destruction, and the relentless search for identity amidst chaos. Their raw, unfiltered lyrics serve as a gritty narrative of personal turmoil, substance abuse, and the struggle for authenticity in a world that often feels cold and indifferent. This album is an unapologetic exploration of the darker sides of human experience, resonating with anyone who has ever felt out of place or battled with their own shadows.\n\nNew Release Round-Up 08-09-24\n\nJ Balvin - Rayo - Capitol Records\n\nJ Balvin is preparing to release his highly anticipated sixth studio album, \"Rayo\". This record will feature 15 tracks with a diverse array of renowned artists from different genres, including Chencho Corleone, Luar la L, Feid, Saiko, Bad Gyal, Zion, Dei V, Ryan Castro, Blessd, Carín León, Yovngchimi, Quevedo, and Omar Courtz. The album marks J Balvin's return to streaming and the stage, reconnecting with his musical roots while introducing new elements in each track for his hardcore fans to enjoy at the end of the summer.\n\n\"Rayo\" includes classic reggaeton sounds with J Balvin's unmistakable voice, but it also blends other genres, featuring powerful afrobeats, house/electro rhythms, as well as Latin trap and pop ballads that showcase Balvin's versatility.\n\nArt Blakey & The Jazz Messengers - Moanin' - Blue Note Records\n\nMore than any other album in the canon of Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers, 1958s Moaninfeaturing the great drummer with trumpeter Lee Morgan, tenor saxophonist Benny Golson, pianist Bobby Timmons, and bassist Jymie Merrittwas the perfect crystallization of the bands bluesy, soulful sound, and it still stands today as perhaps the most quintessential hard bop recording of all-time. Originally self-titled, the album was later renamed Moanin due to the popularity of Timmons unforgettable opening track. The album also introduced several indelible Golson compositions that would become standards of the jazz songbook including Along Came Betty and Blues March.\n\nWayne Shorter - Speak No Evil - Blue Note Records\n\n1964 was one of the most momentous years in the musical life of Wayne Shorter. Early in the year the saxophonist was still a member of Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers, appearing on classic Blue Note albums like Free for All and Indestructible. Shorter made his own auspicious label debut that spring with Night Dreamer and quickly recorded the impressive follow-up JuJu. That summer he joined the Miles Davis Quintet, cementing a line-up that would become one of the seminal bands in jazz history. And when Shorter entered Van Gelder Studio with Freddie Hubbard, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, and Elvin Jones on Christmas Eve 1964 they created a masterpiece with Speak No Evil, a transcendent set of six Shorter originals including the swinging title track, Witch Hunt, and sublime ballad Infant Eyes.\n\nALSO OUT THIS WEEK\n\nBeabadoobee - This Is How Tomorrow Moves [Indie Exclusive Sky Blue LP]\n\nJ Balvin - Rayo [CD]\n\nLogic - Ultra 85 [Sky Blue Marble LP]\n\nSmashing Pumpkins - Rotten Apples: Greatest Hits\n\nWayne Shorter - Speak No Evil - [Blue LP]\n\nAmos Lee - Transmissions [Translucent Sea Blue LP]\n\nRavyn Lenae - Bird's Eye [Bone LP]\n\nMilton Nascimento & Spalding,Esperanza - Milton + Esperanza\n\nOutsiders: A New Musical / O.B.C.R. - Outsiders: A New Musical / O.B.C.R.\n\nHoward McGhee - Maggie's Back In Town!!
