They also toured with Ben & Jerry’s co-founder Ben Cohen to help raise awareness about increased corporate spending in politics.\n\nIn 1991, the band started the Finger Lakes Grassroots Festival in Trumansburg, NY. The four day festival has become an annual destination for over 15,000 music lovers every year and was started as an AIDS benefit. It continues as a benefit for arts and education. To date, the event has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars and is now one of three Grassroots Festivals; the Bi-annual Shakori Hills fest in North Carolina and Virginia Key festival in Florida. In 2016 GrassRoots Culture Camp was introduced in Trumansburg, New York as four days of music, art, dance and movement workshops, including nightly dinners and dances.\n\nView Event →\n\nDriftwood at South Hill Cider/Golden Hour Music Series\n\nGOLDEN HOUR CONCERT SERIES EVERY FRIDAY!\n\n5 pm door // 6 pm show\n\n$10 cover\n\nAbout the band:\n\nMusic has guided Driftwood to hallowed ground many times since its founding members, Joe Kollar and Dan Forsyth, started making music as high schoolers in Joe's parents' basement. Whether the Upstate New York folk rock group—which today also includes violinist Claire Byrne, bassist Joey Arcuri, and drummer Sam Fishman—are converting new fans on a hardscrabble tour across the country or playing to a devoted crowd at hero Levon Helm’s Woodstock barn, the band’s shapeshifting approach to folk music continues to break new ground. And yet in many ways Driftwood's latest work, the transformative December Last Call, finds the group coming home.\n\nRecorded in that very same basement where the Driftwood dream began, December Last Call lyrically reflects on the recent past, musing on the ways the group grew up, together and apart, through curveballs like new parenthood or pandemic shutdowns. But sonically, the band’s sixth album looks confidently to the future, experimenting with new sounds while staying true to the bluegrass roots that built them. Across the album’s nine tracks, the band often leans into hard-rocking electric guitars and driving percussion: On “Every Which Way But Loose,” we get a foot-tapping beat and a sweeping chorus, and on “Up All Night Blues,” the band shines with an ambling, sing-along-able reflection on the challenges of new motherhood. But other tracks, like standout closer “Stardust,” take a simpler route, allowing bare-bones vocals and acoustic instrumentals to underpin a deeper emotional message.\n\nOne of Driftwood’s biggest differentiators—and perhaps its biggest strength—is the sheer breadth of talent in its lineup, with Claire, Joe, and Dan all contributing as songwriters and vocalists. This creative push-pull, where each selects songs to share with the group and record together, bakes vulnerability and collaborative spirit into every recording. “It's at the heart of what we do,” says Dan. “Everybody has a strong love for songs, for songwriting, and we each appreciate everybody else and the way that they contribute to that.”\n\nWhile 2019’s acclaimed Tree of Shade tapped Simon Felice as producer, the band opted to self-produce this latest effort, leaning into their creative impulses and striving to capture their distinctive live energy. Figuring out how to channel that on-stage intensity into a recording has actually, in many ways, been a lesson in restraint. “When I look back at the things we were writing and playing, oh, I don't know, 10, 12 years ago, they were really arranged: a lot of you do this here, we're going to do this there, we're going to break down, we're going to do a big build,” Claire explains. “These days, it's more like, ‘Let's play the song and just see what happens.’”\n\nThis approach makes all the more sense when you consider Driftwood’s live shows, which operate not only as effervescent, twang-studded musical parties, but also as reunions for their throng of devoted listeners—folks who have started to feel less like fans and more like something bigger. “They're supporters. They're friends,” explains Joe. “It's crazy how much love we've got and how many wild situations on the road we've gotten out of because of those people.” Many of them are quite literally invested in the band’s future: December Last Call was a crowd-funded effort, and it wasn’t the band’s first. It’s as if every listener, ticketbuyer, album backer, and general band evangelist is in on Driftwood’s biggest secret: this whole band thing has endured for nearly two decades because it offers a kind of community you can’t get just anywhere.\n\n“Driftwood is basically a beautiful friendship that happens to play music together,” says Joe. “I know it's rare. I know I'm lucky to know these people and lean on them and go through these massive life changes together.” For Driftwood, each song is like a journal entry: cathartic to create, yes, but capable of unlocking new lessons—and when shared—forging new bonds. “We're communal, right? Humans need to be connected,” Joe says. “And we get to have this special thing.”\n\nhttps://www.driftwoodtheband.com/\n\nView Event →\n\nFire Table Dinner & Orchard Tour at South Hill Cider\n\nJoin us for an evening at South Hill Cider for a Prix Fixe 3 course dinner cooked over the fire by Chef Sam Buyskes of Simply Red, a tour through our home orchard, and some of the finest cider the Fingerlakes has to offer!\n\nTickets are priced per person, and include tax and gratuity.\n\n*Vegetarian options are available.\n\nView Event →\n\nAlexander Fals and Hayley Dayis at South Hill Cider / Community Concert Series\n\nThis is a rare treat for Ithaca!

Since that time, they have built a devoted, multi-demographic fanbase deriving from the strength of their fiery live performances. Formed initially as a string band fronted by veteran performer and songwriter Steve Johnson, the band’s sound has since expanded to include a powerhouse rhythm section consisting of drummer Jeff Tripoli and electric bassist Jassen Wilber. Rounding out the lineup is mandolin maestro and vocalist Adam Mckillip, and multi-instrumentalist Matt Gronquist on fiddle, electric guitar and Hammond Organ. The result is a multi-faceted soundscape infused with elements of Folk, Rock, Reggae, Bluegrass, and Funk, with Johnson’s introspective and infectious songwriting serving as the unifying element. The band has recorded four studio albums to-date.The group’s distinctive name was the result of an early exchange involving the Great Blue Heron Music Festival in Sherman, NY. Hoping to make a debut at the annual festival, but having not yet chosen a name, the festival organizer said, \"l'll probably book you, so I guess we should just call you The Probables’.” The rest is history...The Probables have shared the stage with The Wailers, Langhorne Slim, and 10,000 Maniacs, to name a few.\n\nThe Probables:\n\nSteve Johnson - Lead Singer/Acoustic Guitar\n\nMatt Gronquist - Fiddle/Guitar/Keyboards/Vocals\n\nAdam McKillip - Mandolin/Guitar/Vocals\n\nJassen Wilber - Bass\n\nJeff Tripoli - Drums\n\nView Event →\n\nMicah John and Lillian Chase at South Hill Cider/Community Concert Series\n\nCIDER BY THE GLASS, COCKTAILS, LOCAL BEER, FARM-TO-TABLE FOOD, AND LIVE MUSIC FOR OUR COMMUNITY CONCERT SERIES EVERY THURSDAY!\n\nMeet the artist:\n\nMicah John is an award-winning fiddler, guitarist, and singer.

A year later he returned to Ithaca, New York, and released a debut cassette. This led to years of working with roots rock band Donna the Buffalo and their GrassRoots Festival scene.\n\nThey brought him to rural Louisiana where he fell in love with the music from that region and that led to an affair with the accordion and the forming of his own band Sunny Weather. Quickly they started playing over 100 shows a year and we’re regulars at festivals from Key West to Canada.\n\nPerforming live on the road led to a deeper interest in recording music. He spent a couple of years in the studio recording hundreds of tracks that eventually became the albums Porch Light and Who You Are.\n\nAfter over a decade in the music world, Trevor took a step back to focus on family and what most would call ‘grown-up life’. “The funny thing is that music never goes away. I am excited to be playing now that my kids are old enough to allow me a little free time.”\n\nView Event →\n\nPeggy Haine with Dave Davies RhythmMakers @ South Hill Cider\n\nJoin us for one special evening!
