        "text": "First Term (1979-1980)\n\nWhile serving as attorney general of Arkansas in 1978, Bill Clinton won the Democratic nomination for governor and went on to garner 64.3 percent of the popular vote in the gubernatorial election. Clinton was sworn in as governor in January 1979 at the age of thirty-two.\n\nDuring his first term as Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton faced several adversities. The 1979 energy crisis resulted in higher oil and gas prices throughout the United States which dealt a blow to the state‘s economy that lasted well beyond the end of Governor Clinton’s first term. In order to pay for a new highway program, Clinton persuaded the legislature to increase taxes on motor fuels and automobile license fees. While rural roads received necessary repairs, the annual automobile license fees were unpopular with the majority of the public. He met opposition during his efforts to raise taxes on semi-trailer trucks, and angered members of the trucking and poultry industries by not supporting an increase in truck weight limits. He quarreled with Arkansas Power and Light over the company’s efforts to make Arkansans pay for costs associated with the Grand Gulf Nuclear Power Plant in Mississippi. And in 1980, Governor Clinton received criticism when President Jimmy Carter decided to send Cuban refugees to Fort Chaffee. The situation was further compounded when violence erupted at the refugee camp in June of the same year.\n\nFrank White successfully seized on public safety concerns at Fort Chaffee and the public outcry over high automobile license fees as key campaign issues to win the 1980 governor’s race.\n\nAudio Samples\n\nClick ‘listen to more’ below each sample to hear the complete recording.\n\nClinton for Arkansas Committee campaign radio ads\n\nBill Clinton / 1978\n\nhttps://robertslibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/1978XXXX_001m.mp3\n\nIn the full recording, Governor Clinton delivers seven “Clinton for Arkansas” 1978 gubernatorial campaign advertisements.

The new education standards would improve course curriculum, increase teacher salaries, establish student learning assessments, mandate smaller class sizes, increase the school dropout age to 17, make kindergarten mandatory, and provide state and local revenue support for education. The standards would also implement a teacher testing program requiring all Arkansas teachers and school administrators to pass a basic academic competency test.
