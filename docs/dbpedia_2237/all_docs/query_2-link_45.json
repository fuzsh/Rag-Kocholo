        "text": "ROCHESTER, N.Y. – Roberts Wesleyan University pole vaulter Brynn King received the Rochester Press Radio-Club's Jerry Flynn Female College Athlete Award prior to the Rochester Red Wings game against the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders at Innovative Field on Tuesday night.\n\n\"It was fun,\" King said. \"I would like to thank the Rochester Press-Radio Club for honoring me and recognizing the sport of pole vault. I also enjoyed having the opportunity to represent Roberts in the community.\"\n\nKing is the sixth Roberts athlete to be honored by the Press-Radio Club. She joins Joe Rebisz (2001, men's basketball), her pole vault coach Jenn (Stuczynski) Suhr (2004, women's basketball/track and field) and Judy Wright (2005, women's basketball) as winners of the Local Amateur Athlete of the Year Award. Marissa Sell (soccer, basketball and lacrosse) was named Local Athlete of the Year in 2014 and Lindsey Brinkel (women's lacrosse) won the Jerry Flynn College Female Athlete Award in 2022.\n\nKing enjoyed a record-breaking first season as a Redhawk, winning the NCAA Division II indoor and outdoor championships. She broke the indoor record eight times during the season, capped by her winning effort of 4.65 meters (15-feet, 3-inches) at the national championship meet on March 8 in Pittsburg, Kans.\n\nKing became the first student-athlete from Roberts to win an NCAA Championship and was named a first-team All-American and the 2024 DII Women's Field Athlete of the Year by the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association (USTFCCCA) following the indoor season.\n\nKing set the DII outdoor record in her first meet of the season and established a personal record and the current mark of 4.68 meters (15-4 ¼) while winning the Texas Relays on March 30. She also broke a 13-year-old meet record at the Kansas Relays on April 19 and won the East Coast Conference Championship on May 2.\n\nKing captured her second national title by clearing 4.6 meters (15-1) to break a 10-year-old meet record at the NCAA Division II Championships in Emporia, Kans. on May 23. She was named a first-team Division II All-American and the NCAA Division II East Region Women's Field Athlete of the Year by the USTFCCCA.\n\nA native of the Woodlands, Texas, King transferred to Roberts in the summer of 2023 after graduating from Duke University. She is pursuing a second undergraduate degree while being coached by Suhr, the 2012 Olympic gold medalist.\n\nKing has qualified for and will participate in the U.S. Olympic Trials on June 28 in Eugene, Ore."
