        "text": "‚ùÆ Poetry & Prose ‚ùÆ Books / People\n\n‚Äî Joseph Heller\n\nSet in the closing months of World War II in an American bomber squadron off of the coast of Italy, the 1961 novel by Joseph Heller tells the story of Yossarian, a bombardier, who is frantic and furious because thousands of people he hasn‚Äôt even met keep trying to kill him. Catch-22 is a microcosm of the 20th c. world as it might look to someone who‚Äôs ‚Äúdangerously sane.‚Äù As the blurb on one edition says, ‚Äúit is a novel that lives and moves and grows with astonishing power and vitality‚Äù it is today considered a masterpiece within the canon of English literature and makes it on to the ‚ÄúDefinitive List of Literary Works.‚Äù\n\nContents\n\n01. ‚Äî The Texan\n\n02. ‚Äî Clevinger\n\n03. ‚Äî Havermeyer\n\n01.

The doctors were puzzled by the fact that it wasn‚Äôt quite jaundice. If it became jaundice they could treat it. If it didn‚Äôt become jaundice and went away they could discharge him. But this just being short of jaundice all the time confused them.\n\nEach morning they came around, three brisk and serious men with efficient mouths and inefficient eyes, accompanied by brisk and serious Nurse Duckett, one of the ward nurses who didn‚Äôt like Yossarian. They read the chart at the foot of the bed and asked impatiently about the pain. They seemed irritated when he told them it was exactly the same.\n\n‚ÄòStill no movement?‚Äô the full colonel demanded.\n\nThe doctors exchanged a look when he shook his head.\n\n‚ÄòGive him another pill.‚Äô Nurse Duckett made a note to give Yossarian another pill, and the four of them moved along to the next bed. None of the nurses liked Yossarian. Actually, the pain in his liver had gone away, but Yossarian didn‚Äôt say anything and the doctors never suspected. They just suspected that he had been moving his bowels and not telling anyone.\n\nYossarian had everything he wanted in the hospital. The food wasn‚Äôt too bad, and his meals were brought to him in bed. There were extra rations of fresh meat, and during the hot part of the afternoon he and the others were served chilled fruit juice or chilled chocolate milk. Apart from the doctors and the nurses, no one ever disturbed him. For a little while in the morning he had to censor letters, but he was free after that to spend the rest of each day lying around idly with a clear conscience. He was comfortable in the hospital, and it was easy to stay on because he always ran a temperature of 101. He was even more comfortable than Dunbar, who had to keep falling down on his face in order to get his meals brought to him in bed.\n\nAfter he had made up his mind to spend the rest of the war in the hospital, Yossarian wrote letters to everyone he knew saying that he was in the hospital but never mentioning why. One day he had a better idea. To everyone he knew he wrote that he was going on a very dangerous mission. ‚ÄòThey asked for volunteers. It‚Äôs very dangerous, but someone has to do it. I‚Äôll write you the instant I get back.‚Äô And he had not written anyone since.\n\nAll the officer patients in the ward were forced to censor letters written by all the enlisted-men patients, who were kept in residence in wards of their own. It was a monotonous job, and Yossarian was disappointed to learn that the lives of enlisted men were only slightly more interesting than the lives of officers. After the first day he had no curiosity at all. To break the monotony he invented games. Death to all modifiers, he declared one day, and out of every letter that passed through his hands went every adverb and every adjective. The next day he made war on articles. He reached a much higher plane of creativity the following day when he blacked out everything in the letters but a, an and the. That erected more dynamic intralinear tensions, he felt, and in just about every case left a message far more universal. Soon he was proscribing parts of salutations and signatures and leaving the text untouched. One time he blacked out all but the salutation ‚ÄòDear Mary‚Äô from a letter, and at the bottom he wrote, ‚ÄòI yearn for you tragically. R. O. Shipman, Chaplain, U.S. Army.‚Äô R.O. Shipman was the group chaplain‚Äôs name.\n\nWhen he had exhausted all possibilities in the letters, he began attacking the names and addresses on the envelopes, obliterating whole homes and streets, annihilating entire metropolises with careless flicks of his wrist as though he were God. Catch-22 required that each censored letter bear the censoring officer‚Äôs name. Most letters he didn‚Äôt read at all. On those he didn‚Äôt read at all he wrote his own name. On those he did read he wrote, ‚ÄòWashington Irving.‚Äô When that grew monotonous he wrote, ‚ÄòIrving Washington.‚Äô Censoring the envelopes had serious repercussions, produced a ripple of anxiety on some ethereal military echelon that floated a C.I.D. man back into the ward posing as a patient. They all knew he was a C.I.D. man because he kept inquiring about an officer named Irving or Washington and because after his first day there he wouldn‚Äôt censor letters. He found them too monotonous.\n\nIt was a good ward this time, one of the best he and Dunbar had ever enjoyed. With them this time was the twenty-four-year-old fighter-pilot captain with the sparse golden mustache who had been shot into the Adriatic Sea in midwinter and not even\n\ncaught cold. Now the summer was upon them, the captain had not been shot down, and he said he had the grippe. In the bed on Yossarian‚Äôs right, still lying amorously on his belly, was the startled captain with malaria in his blood and a mosquito bite on his ass. Across the aisle from Yossarian was Dunbar, and next to Dunbar was the artillery captain with whom Yossarian had stopped playing chess. The captain was a good chess player, and the games were always interesting. Yossarian had stopped playing chess with him because the games were so interesting they were foolish. Then there was the educated Texan from Texas who looked like someone in Technicolor and felt, patriotically, that people of means‚Äîdecent folk‚Äîshould be given more votes than drifters, whores, criminals, degenerates, atheists and indecent folk‚Äîpeople without means.\n\nYossarian was unspringing rhythms in the letters the day they brought the Texan in. It was another quiet, hot, untroubled day. The heat pressed heavily on the roof, stifling sound. Dunbar was lying motionless on his back again with his eyes staring up at the ceiling like a doll‚Äôs. He was working hard at increasing his life span. He did it by cultivating boredom. Dunbar was working so hard at increasing his life span that Yossarian thought he was dead. They put the Texan in a bed in the middle of the ward, and it wasn‚Äôt long before he donated his views.\n\nDunbar sat up like a shot. ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs it,‚Äô he cried excitedly. ‚ÄòThere was something missing\n\n‚Äîall the time I knew there was something missing‚Äîand now I know what it is.‚Äô He banged his fist down into his palm. ‚ÄòNo patriotism,‚Äô he declared.\n\n‚ÄòYou‚Äôre right,‚Äô Yossarian shouted back. ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre right, you‚Äôre right, you‚Äôre right. The hot dog, the Brooklyn Dodgers. Mom‚Äôs apple pie. That‚Äôs what everyone‚Äôs fighting for. But who‚Äôs fighting for the decent folk? Who‚Äôs fighting for more votes for the decent folk? There‚Äôs no patriotism, that‚Äôs what it is. And no matriotism, either.‚Äô The warrant officer on Yossarian‚Äôs left was unimpressed. ‚ÄòWho gives a shit?‚Äô he asked tiredly, and turned over on his side to go to sleep.\n\nThe Texan turned out to be good-natured, generous and likable. In three days no one could stand him.\n\nHe sent shudders of annoyance scampering up ticklish spines, and everybody fled from him‚Äîeverybody but the soldier in white, who had no choice. The soldier in white was encased from head to toe in plaster and gauze. He had two useless legs and two useless arms. He had been smuggled into the ward during the night, and the men had\n\nno idea he was among them until they awoke in the morning and saw the two strange legs hoisted from the hips, the two strange arms anchored up perpendicularly, all four limbs pinioned strangely in air by lead weights suspended darkly above him that never moved. Sewn into the bandages over the insides of both elbows were zippered lips through which he was fed clear fluid from a clear jar. A silent zinc pipe rose from the cement on his groin and was coupled to a slim rubber hose that carried waste from his kidneys and dripped it efficiently into a clear, stoppered jar on the floor. When the jar on the floor was full, the jar feeding his elbow was empty, and the two were simply switched quickly so that the stuff could drip back into him. All they ever really saw of the soldier in white was a frayed black hole over his mouth.\n\nThe soldier in white had been filed next to the Texan, and the Texan sat sideways on his own bed and talked to him throughout the morning, afternoon and evening in a pleasant, sympathetic drawl. The Texan never minded that he got no reply.\n\nTemperatures were taken twice a day in the ward. Early each morning and late each afternoon Nurse Cramer entered with a jar full of thermometers and worked her way up one side of the ward and down the other, distributing a thermometer to each patient. She managed the soldier in white by inserting a thermometer into the hole over his mouth and leaving it balanced there on the lower rim. When she returned to the man in the first bed, she took his thermometer and recorded his temperature, and then moved on to the next bed and continued around the ward again. One afternoon when she had completed her first circuit of the ward and came a second time to the soldier in white, she read his thermometer and discovered that he was dead.\n\n‚ÄòMurderer,‚Äô Dunbar said quietly.\n\nThe Texan looked up at him with an uncertain grin. ‚ÄòKiller,‚Äô Yossarian said.\n\n‚ÄòWhat are you fellas talkin‚Äô about?‚Äô the Texan asked nervously. ‚ÄòYou murdered him,‚Äô said Dunbar.\n\n‚ÄòYou killed him,‚Äô said Yossarian.\n\nThe Texan shrank back. ‚ÄòYou fellas are crazy. I didn‚Äôt even touch him.‚Äô ‚ÄòYou murdered him,‚Äô said Dunbar.\n\n‚ÄòI heard you kill him,‚Äô said Yossarian.\n\n‚ÄòYou killed him because he was a nigger,‚Äô Dunbar said.\n\n‚ÄòYou fellas are crazy,‚Äô the Texan cried. ‚ÄòThey don‚Äôt allow niggers in here. They got a special place for niggers.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòThe sergeant smuggled him in,‚Äô Dunbar said. ‚ÄòThe Communist sergeant,‚Äô said Yossarian.\n\n‚ÄòAnd you knew it.‚Äô The warrant officer on Yossarian‚Äôs left was unimpressed by the entire incident of the soldier in white. The warrant officer was unimpressed by everything and never spoke at all unless it was to show irritation.\n\nThe day before Yossarian met the chaplain, a stove exploded in the mess hall and set fire to one side of the kitchen. An intense heat flashed through the area. Even in Yossarian‚Äôs ward, almost three hundred feet away, they could hear the roar of the blaze and the sharp cracks of flaming timber. Smoke sped past the orange-tinted windows. In about fifteen minutes the crash trucks from the airfield arrived to fight the fire. For a frantic half hour it was touch and go. Then the firemen began to get the upper hand. Suddenly there was the monotonous old drone of bombers returning from a mission, and the firemen had to roll up their hoses and speed back to the field in case one of the planes crashed and caught fire. The planes landed safely. As soon as the last one was down, the firemen wheeled their trucks around and raced back up the hill to resume their fight with the fire at the hospital. When they got there, the blaze was out. It had died of its own accord, expired completely without even an ember to be watered down, and there was nothing for the disappointed firemen to do but drink tepid coffee and hang around trying to screw the nurses.\n\nThe chaplain arrived the day after the fire. Yossarian was busy expurgating all but romance words from the letters when the chaplain sat down in a chair between the beds and asked him how he was feeling. He had placed himself a bit to one side, and the captain‚Äôs bars on the tab of his shirt collar were all the insignia Yossarian could\n\nsee. Yossarian had no idea who he was and just took it for granted that he was either another doctor or another madman.\n\n‚ÄòOh, pretty good,‚Äô he answered. ‚ÄòI‚Äôve got a slight pain in my liver and I haven‚Äôt been the most regular of fellows, I guess, but all in all I must admit that I feel pretty good.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòThat‚Äôs good,‚Äô said the chaplain.\n\n‚ÄòYes,‚Äô Yossarian said. ‚ÄòYes, that is good.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòI meant to come around sooner,‚Äô the chaplain said, ‚Äòbut I really haven‚Äôt been well.‚Äô ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs too bad,‚Äô Yossarian said.\n\n‚ÄòJust a head cold,‚Äô the chaplain added quickly.\n\n‚ÄòI‚Äôve got a fever of a hundred and one,‚Äô Yossarian added just as quickly. ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs too bad,‚Äô said the chaplain.\n\n‚ÄòYes,‚Äô Yossarian agreed. ‚ÄòYes, that is too bad.‚Äô The chaplain fidgeted. ‚ÄòIs there anything I can do for you?‚Äô he asked after a while.\n\n‚ÄòNo, no.‚Äô Yossarian sighed. ‚ÄòThe doctors are doing all that‚Äôs humanly possible, I suppose.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòNo, no.‚Äô The chaplain colored faintly. ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt mean anything like that. I meant cigarettes‚Ä¶ or books‚Ä¶ or‚Ä¶ toys.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòNo, no,‚Äô Yossarian said. ‚ÄòThank you. I have everything I need, I suppose‚Äîeverything but good health.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòThat‚Äôs too bad.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòYes,‚Äô Yossarian said. ‚ÄòYes, that is too bad.‚Äô The chaplain stirred again. He looked from side to side a few times, then gazed up at the ceiling, then down at the floor. He drew a deep breath.\n\n‚ÄòLieutenant Nately sends his regards,‚Äô he said.\n\nYossarian was sorry to hear they had a mutual friend. It seemed there was a basis to their conversation after all. ‚ÄòYou know Lieutenant Nately?‚Äô he asked regretfully.\n\n‚ÄòYes, I know Lieutenant Nately quite well.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòHe‚Äôs a bit loony, isn‚Äôt he?‚Äô The chaplain‚Äôs smile was embarrassed. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm afraid I couldn‚Äôt say. I don‚Äôt think I know him that well.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòYou can take my word for it,‚Äô Yossarian said. ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs as goofy as they come.‚Äô The chaplain weighed the next silence heavily and then shattered it with an abrupt question. ‚ÄòYou are Captain Yossarian, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòNately had a bad start. He came from a good family.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòPlease excuse me,‚Äô the chaplain persisted timorously. ‚ÄòI may be committing a very grave error. Are you Captain Yossarian?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòYes,‚Äô Captain Yossarian confessed. ‚ÄòI am Captain Yossarian.‚Äô ‚ÄòOf the 256th Squadron?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòOf the fighting 256th Squadron,‚Äô Yossarian replied. ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt know there were any other Captain Yossarians. As far as I know, I‚Äôm the only Captain Yossarian I know, but that‚Äôs only as far as I know.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòI see,‚Äô the chaplain said unhappily.\n\n‚ÄòThat‚Äôs two to the fighting eighth power,‚Äô Yossarian pointed out, ‚Äòif you‚Äôre thinking of writing a symbolic poem about our squadron.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòNo,‚Äô mumbled the chaplain. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not thinking of writing a symbolic poem about your squadron.‚Äô Yossarian straightened sharply when he spied the tiny silver cross on the other side of the chaplain‚Äôs collar. He was thoroughly astonished, for he had never really talked with a chaplain before.\n\n‚ÄòYou‚Äôre a chaplain,‚Äô he exclaimed ecstatically. ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt know you were a chaplain.‚Äô ‚ÄòWhy, yes,‚Äô the chaplain answered. ‚ÄòDidn‚Äôt you know I was a chaplain?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòWhy, no. I didn‚Äôt know you were a chaplain.‚Äô Yossarian stared at him with a big, fascinated grin. ‚ÄòI‚Äôve never really seen a chaplain before.‚Äô The chaplain flushed again and gazed down at his hands. He was a slight man of about thirty-two with tan hair and brown diffident eyes. His face was narrow and rather pale. An innocent nest of ancient pimple pricks lay in the basin of each cheek. Yossarian wanted to help him.\n\n‚ÄòCan I do anything at all to help you?‚Äô the chaplain asked.\n\nYossarian shook his head, still grinning. ‚ÄòNo, I‚Äôm sorry. I have everything I need and I‚Äôm quite comfortable. In fact, I‚Äôm not even sick.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòThat‚Äôs good.‚Äô As soon as the chaplain said the words, he was sorry and shoved his knuckles into his mouth with a giggle of alarm, but Yossarian remained silent and disappointed him. ‚ÄòThere are other men in the group I must visit,‚Äô he apologized finally. ‚ÄòI‚Äôll come to see you again, probably tomorrow.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòPlease do that,‚Äô Yossarian said.\n\n‚ÄòI‚Äôll come only if you want me to,‚Äô the chaplain said, lowering his head shyly. ‚ÄòI‚Äôve noticed that I make many of the men uncomfortable.‚Äô Yossarian glowed with affection. ‚ÄòI want you to,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòYou won‚Äôt make me uncomfortable.‚Äô The chaplain beamed gratefully and then peered down at a slip of paper he had been concealing in his hand all the while. He counted along the beds in the ward, moving his lips, and then centered his attention dubiously on Dunbar.\n\n‚ÄòMay I inquire,‚Äô he whispered softly, ‚Äòif that is Lieutenant Dunbar?‚Äô ‚ÄòYes,‚Äô Yossarian answered loudly, ‚Äòthat is Lieutenant Dunbar.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòThank you,‚Äô the chaplain whispered. ‚ÄòThank you very much. I must visit with him. I must visit with every member of the group who is in the hospital.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòEven those in other wards?‚Äô Yossarian asked.\n\n‚ÄòEven those in other wards.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòBe careful in those other wards, Father,‚Äô Yossarian warned. ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs where they keep the mental cases. They‚Äôre filled with lunatics.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòIt isn‚Äôt necessary to call me Father,‚Äô the chaplain explained. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm an Anabaptist.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòI‚Äôm dead serious about those other wards,‚Äô Yossarian continued grimly. ‚ÄòM.P.s won‚Äôt protect you, because they‚Äôre craziest of all. I‚Äôd go with you myself, but I‚Äôm scared stiff: Insanity is contagious. This is the only sane ward in the whole hospital. Everybody is crazy but us. This is probably the only sane ward in the whole world, for that matter.‚Äô The chaplain rose quickly and edged away from Yossarian‚Äôs bed, and then nodded with a conciliating smile and promised to conduct himself with appropriate caution. ‚ÄòAnd now I must visit with Lieutenant Dunbar,‚Äô he said. Still he lingered, remorsefully. ‚ÄòHow is Lieutenant Dunbar?‚Äô he asked at last.\n\n‚ÄòAs good as they go,‚Äô Yossarian assured him. ‚ÄòA true prince. One of the finest, least dedicated men in the whole world.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt mean that,‚Äô the chaplain answered, whispering again. ‚ÄòIs he very sick?‚Äô ‚ÄòNo, he isn‚Äôt very sick. In fact, he isn‚Äôt sick at all.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòThat‚Äôs good.‚Äô The chaplain sighed with relief. ‚ÄòYes,‚Äô Yossarian said. ‚ÄòYes, that is good.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòA chaplain,‚Äô Dunbar said when the chaplain had visited him and gone. ‚ÄòDid you see that? A chaplain.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòWasn‚Äôt he sweet?‚Äô said Yossarian. ‚ÄòMaybe they should give him three votes.‚Äô ‚ÄòWho‚Äôs they?‚Äô Dunbar demanded suspiciously.\n\nIn a bed in the small private section at the end of the ward, always working ceaselessly behind the green plyboard partition, was the solemn middle-aged colonel who was visited every day by a gentle, sweet-faced woman with curly ash-blond hair who was not a nurse and not a Wac and not a Red Cross girl but who nevertheless\n\nappeared faithfully at the hospital in Pianosa each afternoon wearing pretty pastel summer dresses that were very smart and white leather pumps with heels half high at the base of nylon seams that were inevitably straight. The colonel was in Communications, and he was kept busy day and night transmitting glutinous messages from the interior into square pads of gauze which he sealed meticulously and delivered to a covered white pail that stood on the night table beside his bed. The colonel was gorgeous. He had a cavernous mouth, cavernous cheeks, cavernous, sad, mildewed eyes. His face was the color of clouded silver. He coughed quietly, gingerly, and dabbed the pads slowly at his lips with a distaste that had become automatic.\n\nThe colonel dwelt in a vortex of specialists who were still specializing in trying to determine what was troubling him. They hurled lights in his eyes to see if he could see, rammed needles into nerves to hear if he could feel. There was a urologist for his urine, a lymphologist for his lymph, an endocrinologist for his endocrines, a psychologist for his psyche, a dermatologist for his derma; there was a pathologist for his pathos, a cystologist for his cysts, and a bald and pedantic cetologist from the zoology department at Harvard who had been shanghaied ruthlessly into the Medical Corps by a faulty anode in an I.B.M. machine and spent his sessions with the dying colonel trying to discuss Moby Dick with him.\n\nThe colonel had really been investigated. There was not an organ of his body that had not been drugged and derogated, dusted and dredged, fingered and photographed, removed, plundered and replaced. Neat, slender and erect, the woman touched him often as she sat by his bedside and was the epitome of stately sorrow each time she smiled. The colonel was tall, thin and stooped. When he rose to walk, he bent forward even more, making a deep cavity of his body, and placed his feet down very carefully, moving ahead by inches from the knees down. There were violet pools under his eyes. The woman spoke softly, softer than the colonel coughed, and none of the men in the ward ever heard her voice.\n\nIn less than ten days the Texan cleared the ward. The artillery captain broke first, and after that the exodus started. Dunbar, Yossarian and the fighter captain all bolted the same morning. Dunbar stopped having dizzy spells, and the fighter captain blew his nose. Yossarian told the doctors that the pain in his liver had gone away. It was as easy as that. Even the warrant officer fled. In less than ten days, the Texan drove everybody in the ward back to duty‚Äîeverybody but the C.I.D. man, who had caught cold from the fighter captain and come down with pneumonia.\n\n‚Äî ¬ß ‚Äî\n\n02. ‚Äî Clevinger\n\nIn a way the C.I.D. man was pretty lucky, because outside the hospital the war was still going on. Men went mad and were rewarded with medals. All over the world, boys on every side of the bomb line were laying down their lives for what they had been told was their country, and no one seemed to mind, least of all the boys who were laying down their young lives. There was no end in sight. The only end in sight was Yossarian‚Äôs own, and he might have remained in the hospital until doomsday had it not been for that patriotic Texan with his infundibuliform jowls and his lumpy, rumpleheaded, indestructible smile cracked forever across the front of his face like the brim of a black ten-gallon hat. The Texan wanted everybody in the ward to be happy but Yossarian and Dunbar. He was really very sick.\n\nBut Yossarian couldn‚Äôt be happy, even though the Texan didn‚Äôt want him to be, because outside the hospital there was still nothing funny going on. The only thing going on was a war, and no one seemed to notice but Yossarian and Dunbar. And when Yossarian tried to remind people, they drew away from him and thought he was crazy. Even Clevinger, who should have known better but didn‚Äôt, had told him he was crazy the last time they had seen each other, which was just before Yossarian had fled into the hospital.\n\nClevinger had stared at him with apoplectic rage and indignation and, clawing the table with both hands, had shouted, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre crazy!‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòClevinger, what do you want from people?‚Äô Dunbar had replied wearily above the noises of the officers‚Äô club.\n\n‚ÄòI‚Äôm not joking,‚Äô Clevinger persisted.\n\n‚ÄòThey‚Äôre trying to kill me,‚Äô Yossarian told him calmly. ‚ÄòNo one‚Äôs trying to kill you,‚Äô Clevinger cried.\n\n‚ÄòThen why are they shooting at me?‚Äô Yossarian asked.\n\n‚ÄòThey‚Äôre shooting at everyone,‚Äô Clevinger answered. ‚ÄòThey‚Äôre trying to kill everyone.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòAnd what difference does that make?‚Äô Clevinger was already on the way, half out of his chair with emotion, his eyes moist and his lips quivering and pale. As always occurred when he quarreled over principles in which he believed passionately, he would end up gasping furiously for air and blinking back bitter tears of conviction. There were many principles in which Clevinger believed passionately. He was crazy.\n\n‚ÄòWho‚Äôs they?‚Äô he wanted to know. ‚ÄòWho, specifically, do you think is trying to murder you?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòEvery one of them,‚Äô Yossarian told him. ‚ÄòEvery one of whom?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòEvery one of whom do you think?‚Äô ‚ÄòI haven‚Äôt any idea.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòThen how do you know they aren‚Äôt?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòBecause‚Ä¶‚Äô Clevinger sputtered, and turned speechless with frustration.\n\nClevinger really thought he was right, but Yossarian had proof, because strangers he didn‚Äôt know shot at him with cannons every time he flew up into the air to drop bombs on them, and it wasn‚Äôt funny at all. And if that wasn‚Äôt funny, there were lots of things that weren‚Äôt even funnier. There was nothing funny about living like a bum in a tent in Pianosa between fat mountains behind him and a placid blue sea in front that could gulp down a person with a cramp in the twinkling of an eye and ship him back to shore three days later, all charges paid, bloated, blue and putrescent, water draining out through both cold nostrils.\n\nThe tent he lived in stood right smack up against the wall of the shallow, dull-colored forest separating his own squadron from Dunbar ‚Äôs. Immediately alongside was the abandoned railroad ditch that carried the pipe that carried the aviation gasoline down to the fuel trucks at the airfield. Thanks to Orr, his roommate, it was the most luxurious tent in the squadron. Each time Yossarian returned from one of his holidays in the hospital or rest leaves in Rome, he was surprised by some new comfort Orr had installed in his absence‚Äîrunning water, wood-burning fireplace, cement floor.\n\nYossarian had chosen the site, and he and Orr had raised the tent together. Orr, who was a grinning pygmy with pilot‚Äôs wings and thick, wavy brown hair parted in the middle, furnished all the knowledge, while Yossarian, who was taller, stronger, broader and faster, did most of the work. Just the two of them lived there, although the tent was big enough for six. When summer came, Orr rolled up the side flaps to allow a breeze that never blew to flush away the air baking inside.\n\nImmediately next door to Yossarian was Havermeyer, who liked peanut brittle and lived all by himself in the two-man tent in which he shot tiny field mice every night with huge bullets from the.45 he had stolen from the dead man in Yossarian‚Äôs tent. On the other side of Havermeyer stood the tent McWatt no longer shared with Clevinger, who had still not returned when Yossarian came out of the hospital. McWatt shared his tent now with Nately, who was away in Rome courting the sleepy whore he had fallen so deeply in love with there who was bored with her work and bored with him too. McWatt was crazy. He was a pilot and flew his plane as low as he dared over Yossarian‚Äôs tent as often as he could, just to see how much he could frighten him, and loved to go buzzing with a wild, close roar over the wooden raft floating on empty oil drums out past the sand bar at the immaculate white beach where the men went swimming naked. Sharing a tent with a man who was crazy wasn‚Äôt easy, but Nately didn‚Äôt care. He was crazy, too, and had gone every free day to work on the officers‚Äô club that Yossarian had not helped build.\n\nActually, there were many officers‚Äô clubs that Yossarian had not helped build, but he was proudest of the one on Pianosa. It was a sturdy and complex monument to his powers of determination. Yossarian never went there to help until it was finished; then he went there often, so pleased was he with the large, fine, rambling, shingled building. It was truly a splendid structure, and Yossarian throbbed with a mighty sense of accomplishment each time he gazed at it and reflected that none of the work that had gone into it was his.\n\nThere were four of them seated together at a table in the officers‚Äô club the last time he and Clevinger had called each other crazy. They were seated in back near the crap table on which Appleby always managed to win. Appleby was as good at shooting crap as he was at playing ping-pong, and he was as good at playing ping-pong as he was at everything else. Everything Appleby did, he did well. Appleby was a fair-haired boy from Iowa who believed in God, Motherhood and the American Way of Life, without ever thinking about any of them, and everybody who knew him liked him.\n\n‚ÄòI hate that son of a bitch,‚Äô Yossarian growled.\n\nThe argument with Clevinger had begun a few minutes earlier when Yossarian had been unable to find a machine gun. It was a busy night. The bar was busy, the crap table was busy, the ping-gong table was busy. The people Yossarian wanted to machine-gun were busy at the bar singing sentimental old favorites that nobody else ever tired of. Instead of machine-gunning them, he brought his heel down hard on the ping-pong ball that came rolling toward him off the paddle of one of the two officers playing.\n\n‚ÄòThat Yossarian,‚Äô the two officers laughed, shaking their heads, and got another ball from the box on the shelf.\n\n‚ÄòThat Yossarian,‚Äô Yossarian answered them. ‚ÄòYossarian,‚Äô Nately whispered cautioningly. ‚ÄòYou see what I mean?‚Äô asked Clevinger.\n\nThe officers laughed again when they heard Yossarian mimicking them. ‚ÄòThat Yossarian,‚Äô they said more loudly.\n\n‚ÄòThat Yossarian,‚Äô Yossarian echoed. ‚ÄòYossarian, please,‚Äô Nately pleaded.\n\n‚ÄòYou see what I mean?‚Äô asked Clevinger. ‚ÄòHe has antisocial aggressions.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòOh, shut up,‚Äô Dunbar told Clevinger. Dunbar liked Clevinger because Clevinger annoyed him and made the time go slow.\n\n‚ÄòAppleby isn‚Äôt even here,‚Äô Clevinger pointed out triumphantly to Yossarian. ‚ÄòWho said anything about Appleby?‚Äô Yossarian wanted to know.\n\n‚ÄòColonel Cathcart isn‚Äôt here, either.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòWho said anything about Colonel Cathcart?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòWhat son of a bitch do you hate, then?‚Äô ‚ÄòWhat son of a bitch is here?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòI‚Äôm not going to argue with you,‚Äô Clevinger decided. ‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt know who you hate.‚Äô ‚ÄòWhoever‚Äôs trying to poison me,‚Äô Yossarian told him.\n\n‚ÄòNobody‚Äôs trying to poison you.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòThey poisoned my food twice, didn‚Äôt they? Didn‚Äôt they put poison in my food during Ferrara and during the Great Big Siege of Bologna?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòThey put poison in everybody‚Äôs food,‚Äô Clevinger explained. ‚ÄòAnd what difference does that make?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòAnd it wasn‚Äôt even poison!‚Äô Clevinger cried heatedly, growing more emphatic as he grew more confused.\n\nAs far back as Yossarian could recall, he explained to Clevinger with a patient smile, somebody was always hatching a plot to kill him. There were people who cared for him and people who didn‚Äôt, and those who didn‚Äôt hated him and were out to get him. They hated him because he was Assyrian. But they couldn‚Äôt touch him, he told Clevinger, because he had a sound mind in a pure body and was as strong as an ox. They couldn‚Äôt touch him because he was Tarzan, Mandrake, Flash Gordon. He was Bill Shakespeare. He was Cain, Ulysses, the Flying Dutchman; he was Lot in Sodom, Deirdre of the Sorrows, Sweeney in the nightingales among trees. He was miracle ingredient Z-247. He was‚Äî‚ÄôCrazy!‚Äô Clevinger interrupted, shrieking. ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs what you are! Crazy!\n\n‚Äò‚Äîimmense. I‚Äôm a real, slam-bang, honest-to-goodness, three-fisted humdinger. I‚Äôm a bona fide supraman.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòSuperman?‚Äô Clevinger cried. ‚ÄòSuperman?‚Äô ‚ÄòSupraman,‚Äô Yossarian corrected.\n\n‚ÄòHey, fellas, cut it out,‚Äô Nately begged with embarrassment. ‚ÄòEverybody‚Äôs looking at us.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòYou‚Äôre crazy,‚Äô Clevinger shouted vehemently, his eyes filling with tears. ‚ÄòYou‚Äôve got a Jehovah complex.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòI think everyone is Nathaniel.‚Äô Clevinger arrested himself in mid-declamation, suspiciously. ‚ÄòWho‚Äôs Nathaniel?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòNathaniel who?‚Äô inquired Yossarian innocently.\n\nClevinger skirted the trap neatly. ‚ÄòYou think everybody is Jehovah. You‚Äôre no better than Raskolnkov‚Äî‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòWho?‚Äô\n\n‚Äò‚Äîyes, Raskolnikov, who‚Äî‚Äô ‚ÄòRaskolnikov!‚Äô\n\n‚Äò‚Äîwho‚ÄîI mean it‚Äîwho felt he could justify killing an old woman‚Äî‚Äô ‚ÄòNo better than?‚Äô\n\n‚Äò‚Äîyes, justify, that‚Äôs right‚Äîwith an ax! And I can prove it to you!‚Äô Gasping furiously for air, Clevinger enumerated Yossarian‚Äôs symptoms: an unreasonable belief that everybody around him was crazy, a homicidal impulse to machine-gun strangers, retrospective falsification, an unfounded suspicion that people hated him and were conspiring to kill him.\n\nBut Yossarian knew he was right, because, as he explained to Clevinger, to the best of his knowledge he had never been wrong. Everywhere he looked was a nut, and it was all a sensible young gentleman like himself could do to maintain his perspective amid so much madness. And it was urgent that he did, for he knew his life was in peril.\n\nYossarian eyed everyone he saw warily when he returned to the squadron from the hospital. Milo was away, too, in Smyrna for the fig harvest. The mess hall ran\n\nsmoothly in Milo ‚Äôs absence. Yossarian had responded ravenously to the pungent aroma of spicy lamb while he was still in the cab of the ambulance bouncing down along the knotted road that lay like a broken suspender between the hospital and the squadron. There was shish-kabob for lunch, huge, savory hunks of spitted meat sizzling like the devil over charcoal after marinating seventy-two hours in a secret mixture Milo had stolen from a crooked trader in the Levant, served with Iranian rice and asparagus tips Parmesan, followed by cherries jubilee for dessert and then steaming cups of fresh coffee with Benedictine and brandy. The meal was served in enormous helpings on damask tablecloths by the skilled Italian waiters Major‚Äîde Coverley had kidnaped from the mainland and given to Milo.\n\nYossarian gorged himself in the mess hall until he thought he would explode and then sagged back in a contented stupor, his mouth filmy with a succulent residue. None of the officers in the squadron had ever eaten so well as they ate regularly in Milo ‚Äôs mess hall, and Yossarian wondered awhile if it wasn‚Äôt perhaps all worth it. But then he burped and remembered that they were trying to kill him, and he sprinted out of the mess hall wildly and ran looking for Doc Daneeka to have himself taken off combat duty and sent home. He found Doc Daneeka in sunlight, sitting on a high stool outside his tent.\n\n‚ÄòFifty missions,‚Äô Doc Daneeka told him, shaking his head. ‚ÄòThe colonel wants fifty missions.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòBut I‚Äôve only got forty-four!‚Äô Doc Daneeka was unmoved. He was a sad, birdlike man with the spatulate face and scrubbed, tapering features of a well-groomed rat.\n\n‚ÄòFifty missions,‚Äô he repeated, still shaking his head. ‚ÄòThe colonel wants fifty missions.‚Äô\n\n‚Äî ¬ß ‚Äî\n\n03. ‚Äî Havermeyer\n\nActually, no one was around when Yossarian returned from the hospital but Orr and the dead man in Yossarian‚Äôs tent. The dead man in Yossarian‚Äôs tent was a pest, and Yossarian didn‚Äôt like him, even though he had never seen him. Having him lying around all day annoyed Yossarian so much that he had gone to the orderly room several times to complain to Sergeant Towser, who refused to admit that the dead man even existed, which, of course, he no longer did. It was still more frustrating to try to appeal directly to Major Major, the long and bony squadron commander, who looked a little bit like Henry Fonda in distress and went jumping out the window of his office each time Yossarian bullied his way past Sergeant Towser to speak to him about it. The dead man in Yossarian‚Äôs tent was simply not easy to live with. He even disturbed Orr, who was not easy to live with, either, and who, on the day Yossarian came back, was tinkering with the faucet that fed gasoline into the stove he had started building while Yossarian was in the hospital.\n\n‚ÄòWhat are you doing?‚Äô Yossarian asked guardedly when he entered the tent, although he saw at once.\n\n‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a leak here,‚Äô Orr said. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm trying to fix it.‚Äô ‚ÄòPlease stop it,‚Äô said Yossarian. ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre making me nervous.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòWhen I was a kid,‚Äô Orr replied, ‚ÄòI used to walk around all day with crab apples in my cheeks. One in each cheek.‚Äô Yossarian put aside the musette bag from which he had begun removing his toilet articles and braced himself suspiciously. A minute passed. ‚ÄòWhy?‚Äô he found himself forced to ask finally.\n\nOrr tittered triumphantly. ‚ÄòBecause they‚Äôre better than horse chestnuts,‚Äô he answered.\n\nOrr was kneeling on the floor of the tent. He worked without pause, taking the faucet apart, spreading all the tiny pieces out carefully, counting and then studying each one interminably as though he had never seen anything remotely similar before, and then reassembling the whole apparatus, over and over and over and over again, with no loss of patience or interest, no sign of fatigue, no indication of ever\n\nconcluding. Yossarian watched him tinkering and felt certain he would be compelled to murder him in cold blood if he did not stop. His eyes moved toward the hunting knife that had been slung over the mosquito-net bar by the dead man the day he arrived. The knife hung beside the dead man‚Äôs empty leather gun holster, from which Havermeyer had stolen the gun.\n\n‚ÄòWhen I couldn‚Äôt get crab apples,‚Äô Orr continued, ‚ÄòI used horse chestnuts. Horse chestnuts are about the same size as crab apples and actually have a better shape, although the shape doesn‚Äôt matter a bit.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòWhy did you walk around with crab apples in your cheeks?‚Äô Yossarian asked again. ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs what I asked.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòBecause they‚Äôve got a better shape than horse chestnuts,‚Äô Orr answered. ‚ÄòI just told you that.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòWhy,‚Äô swore Yossarian at him approvingly, ‚Äòyou evil-eyed, mechanically-aptituded, disaffiliated son of a bitch, did you walk around with anything in your cheeks?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt,‚Äô Orr said, ‚Äòwalk around with anything in my cheeks. I walked around with crab apples in my cheeks. When I couldn‚Äôt get crab apples I walked around with horse chestnuts. In my cheeks.‚Äô Orr giggled. Yossarian made up his mind to keep his mouth shut and did. Orr waited. Yossarian waited longer.\n\n‚ÄòOne in each cheek,‚Äô Orr said.\n\n‚ÄòWhy?‚Äô Orr pounced. ‚ÄòWhy what?‚Äô Yossarian shook his head, smiling, and refused to say.\n\n‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a funny thing about this valve,‚Äô Orr mused aloud. ‚ÄòWhat is?‚Äô Yossarian asked.\n\n‚ÄòBecause I wanted‚Äî‚Äô Yossarian knew. ‚ÄòJesus Christ! Why did you want‚Äî‚Äô ‚Äò‚Äîapple cheeks.‚Äô\n\n‚Äò‚Äîapple cheeks?‚Äô Yossarian demanded.\n\n‚ÄòI wanted apple cheeks,‚Äô Orr repeated. ‚ÄòEven when I was a kid I wanted apple cheeks someday, and I decided to work at it until I got them, and by God, I did work at it until I got them, and that‚Äôs how I did it, with crab apples in my cheeks all day long.‚Äô He giggled again. ‚ÄòOne in each cheek.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòWhy did you want apple cheeks?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt want apple cheeks,‚Äô Orr said. ‚ÄòI wanted big cheeks. I didn‚Äôt care about the color so much, but I wanted them big. I worked at it just like one of those crazy guys you read about who go around squeezing rubber balls all day long just to strengthen their hands. In fact, I was one of those crazy guys. I used to walk around all day with rubber balls in my hands, too.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòWhy?‚Äô ‚ÄòWhy what?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòWhy did you walk around all day with rubber balls in your hands?‚Äô ‚ÄòBecause rubber balls‚Äî‚Äô said Orr.\n\n‚Äò‚Äîare better than crab apples?‚Äô Orr sniggered as he shook his head. ‚ÄòI did it to protect my good reputation in case anyone ever caught me walking around with crab apples in my cheeks. With rubber balls in my hands I could deny there were crab apples in my cheeks. Every time someone asked me why I was walking around with crab apples in my cheeks, I‚Äôd just open my hands and show them it was rubber balls I was walking around with, not crab apples, and that they were in my hands, not my cheeks. It was a good story. But I never knew if it got across or not, since it‚Äôs pretty tough to make people understand you when you‚Äôre talking to them with two crab apples in your cheeks.‚Äô Yossarian found it pretty tough to understand him then, and he wondered once again if Orr wasn‚Äôt talking to him with the tip of his tongue in one of his apple cheeks.\n\nYossarian decided not to utter another word. It would be futile. He knew Orr, and he knew there was not a chance in hell of finding out from him then why he had wanted big cheeks. It would do no more good to ask than it had done to ask him why that whore had kept beating him over the head with her shoe that morning in Rome in the\n\ncramped vestibule outside the open door of Nately‚Äôs whore‚Äôs kid sister‚Äôs room. She was a tall, strapping girl with long hair and incandescent blue veins converging populously beneath her cocoa-colored skin where the flesh was most tender, and she kept cursing and shrieking and jumping high up into the air on her bare feet to keep right on hitting him on the top of his head with the spiked heel of her shoe. They were both naked, and raising a rumpus that brought everyone in the apartment into the hall to watch, each couple in a bedroom doorway, all of them naked except the aproned and sweatered old woman, who clucked reprovingly, and the lecherous, dissipated old man, who cackled aloud hilariously through the whole episode with a kind of avid and superior glee. The girl shrieked and Orr giggled. Each time she landed with the heel of her shoe, Orr giggled louder, infuriating her still further so that she flew up still higher into the air for another shot at his noodle, her wondrously full breasts soaring all over the place like billowing pennants in a strong wind and her buttocks and strong thighs shim-sham-shimmying this way and that way like some horrifying bonanza. She shrieked and Orr giggled right up to the time she shrieked and knocked him cold with a good solid crack on the temple that made him stop giggling and sent him off to the hospital in a stretcher with a hole in his head that wasn‚Äôt very deep and a very mild concussion that kept him out of combat only twelve days.\n\nNobody could find out what had happened, not even the cackling old man and clucking old woman, who were in a position to find out everything that happened in that vast and endless brothel with its multitudinous bedrooms on facing sides of the narrow hallways going off in opposite directions from the spacious sitting room with its shaded windows and single lamp. Every time she met Orr after that, she‚Äôd hoist her skirts up over her tight white elastic panties and, jeering coarsely, bulge her firm, round belly out at him, cursing him contemptuously and then roaring with husky laughter as she saw him giggle fearfully and take refuge behind Yossarian. Whatever he had done or tried to do or failed to do behind the closed door of Nately‚Äôs whore‚Äôs kid sister‚Äôs room was still a secret. The girl wouldn‚Äôt tell Nately‚Äôs whore or any of the other whores or Nately or Yossarian. Orr might tell, but Yossarian had decided not to utter another word.\n\n‚ÄòDo you want to know why I wanted big cheeks?‚Äô Orr asked. Yossarian kept his mouth shut.\n\n‚ÄòDo you remember,‚Äô Orr said, ‚Äòthat time in Rome when that girl who can‚Äôt stand you kept hitting me over the head with the heel of her shoe? Do you want to know why she was hitting me?‚Äô It was still impossible to imagine what he could have done to make her angry enough to hammer him over the head for fifteen or twenty minutes, yet not angry enough to pick him up by the ankles and dash his brains out. She was certainly tall enough, and Orr was certainly short enough. Orr had buck teeth and bulging eyes to go with his big cheeks and was even smaller than young Huple, who lived on the wrong side of the railroad tracks in the tent in the administration area in which Hungry Joe lay screaming in his sleep every night.\n\nThe administration area in which Hungry Joe had pitched his tent by mistake lay in the center of the squadron between the ditch, with its rusted railroad tracks, and the tilted black bituminous road. The men could pick up girls along that road if they promised to take them where they wanted to go, buxom, young, homely, grinning girls with missing teeth whom they could drive off the road and lie down in the wild grass with, and Yossarian did whenever he could, which was not nearly as often as Hungry Joe, who could get a jeep but couldn‚Äôt drive, begged him to try. The tents of the enlisted men in the squadron stood on the other side of the road alongside the open- air movie theater in which, for the daily amusement of the dying, ignorant armies clashed by night on a collapsible screen, and to which another U.S.O. troupe came that same afternoon.\n\nThe U.S.O. troupes were sent by General P. P. Peckem, who had moved his headquarters up to Rome and had nothing better to do while he schemed against General Dreedle. General Peckem was a general with whom neatness definitely counted. He was a spry, suave and very precise general who knew the circumference of the equator and always wrote ‚Äòenhanced‚Äô when he meant ‚Äòincreased‚Äô. He was a prick, and no one knew this better than General Dreedle, who was incensed by General Peckem‚Äôs recent directive requiring all tents in the Mediterranean theater of operations to be pitched along parallel lines with entrances facing back proudly toward the Washington Monument. To General Dreedle, who ran a fighting outfit, it seemed a lot of crap. Furthermore, it was none of General Peckem‚Äôs goddam business how the tents in General Dreedle‚Äôs wing were pitched. There then followed a hectic jurisdictional dispute between these overlords that was decided in General Dreedle‚Äôs favor by ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen, mail clerk at Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters. Wintergreen determined the outcome by throwing all communications from General Peckem into the wastebasket. He found them too prolix. General Dreedle‚Äôs views, expressed in less pretentious literary style, pleased ex-P.F.C.\n\nWintergreen and were sped along by him in zealous observance of regulations. General Dreedle was victorious by default.\n\nTo regain whatever status he had lost, General Peckem began sending out more\n\nU.S.O. troupes than he had ever sent out before and assigned to Colonel Cargill himself the responsibility of generating enough enthusiasm for them.\n\nBut there was no enthusiasm in Yossarian‚Äôs group. In Yossarian‚Äôs group there was only a mounting number of enlisted men and officers who found their way solemnly to Sergeant Towser several times a day to ask if the orders sending them home had come in. They were men who had finished their fifty missions. There were more of them now than when Yossarian had gone into the hospital, and they were still waiting. They worried and bit their nails. They were grotesque, like useless young men in a depression. They moved sideways, like crabs. They were waiting for the orders sending them home to safety to return from Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters in Italy, and while they waited they had nothing to do but worry and bite their nails and find their way solemnly to Sergeant Towser several times a day to ask if the order sending them home to safety had come.\n\nThey were in a race and knew it, because they knew from bitter experience that Colonel Cathcart might raise the number of missions again at any time. They had nothing better to do than wait. Only Hungry Joe had something better to do each time he finished his missions. He had screaming nightmares and won fist fights with Huple‚Äôs cat. He took his camera to the front row of every U.S.O. show and tried to shoot pictures up the skirt of the yellow-headed singer with two big ones in a sequined dress that always seemed ready to burst. The pictures never came out.\n\nColonel Cargill, General Peckem‚Äôs troubleshooter, was a forceful, ruddy man. Before the war he had been an alert, hardhitting, aggressive marketing executive. He was a very bad marketing executive. Colonel Cargill was so awful a marketing executive that his services were much sought after by firms eager to establish losses for tax purposes. Throughout the civilized world, from Battery Park to Fulton Street, he was known as a dependable man for a fast tax write-off. His prices were high, for failure often did not come easily. He had to start at the top and work his way down, and with sympathetic friends in Washington, losing money was no simple matter. It took months of hard work and careful misplanning. A person misplaced, disorganized, miscalculated, overlooked everything and opened every loophole, and just when he thought he had it made, the government gave him a lake or a forest or an oilfield and\n\nspoiled everything. Even with such handicaps, Colonel Cargill could be relied on to run the most prosperous enterprise into the ground. He was a self-made man who owed his lack of success to nobody.\n\n‚ÄòMen,‚Äô Colonel Cargill began in Yossarian‚Äôs squadron, measuring his pauses carefully. ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre American officers. The officers of no other army in the world can make that statement. Think about it.‚Äô Sergeant Knight thought about it and then politely informed Colonel Cargill that he was addressing the enlisted men and that the officers were to be found waiting for him on the other side of the squadron. Colonel Cargill thanked him crisply and glowed with self-satisfaction as he strode across the area. It made him proud to observe that twenty-nine months in the service had not blunted his genius for ineptitude.\n\n‚ÄòMen,‚Äô he began his address to the officers, measuring his pauses carefully. ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre American officers. The officers of no other army in the world can make that statement. Think about it.‚Äô He waited a moment to permit them to think about it. ‚ÄòThese people are your guests!‚Äô he shouted suddenly. ‚ÄòThey‚Äôve traveled over three thousand miles to entertain you. How are they going to feel if nobody wants to go out and watch them? What‚Äôs going to happen to their morale? Now, men, it‚Äôs no skin off my behind. But that girl that wants to play the accordion for you today is old enough to be a mother. How would you feel if your own mother traveled over three thousand miles to play the accordion for some troops that didn‚Äôt want to watch her? How is that kid whose mother that accordion player is old enough to be going to feel when he grows up and learns about it? We all know the answer to that one. Now, men, don‚Äôt misunderstand me. This is all voluntary, of course. I‚Äôd be the last colonel in the world to order you to go to that U.S.O. show and have a good time, but I want every one of you who isn‚Äôt sick enough to be in a hospital to go to that U.S.O. show right now and have a good time, and that‚Äôs an order!‚Äô Yossarian did feel almost sick enough to go back into the hospital, and he felt even sicker three combat missions later when Doc Daneeka still shook his melancholy head and refused to ground him.\n\n‚ÄòYou think you‚Äôve got troubles?‚Äô Doc Daneeka rebuked him grievingly. ‚ÄòWhat about me? I lived on peanuts for eight years while I learned how to be a doctor. After the peanuts, I lived on chicken feed in my own office until I could build up a practice decent enough to even pay expenses. Then, just as the shop was finally starting to show a profit, they drafted me. I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre complaining about.‚Äô Doc Daneeka was Yossarian‚Äôs friend and would do just about nothing in his power to help him. Yossarian listened very carefully as Doc Daneeka told him about Colonel\n\nCathcart at Group, who wanted to be a general, about General Dreedle at Wing and General Dreedle‚Äôs nurse, and about all the other generals at Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters, who insisted on only forty missions as a completed tour of duty.\n\n‚ÄòWhy don‚Äôt you just smile and make the best of it?‚Äô he advised Yossarian glumly. ‚ÄòBe like Havermeyer.‚Äô Yossarian shuddered at the suggestion. Havermeyer was a lead bombardier who never took evasive action going in to the target and thereby increased the danger of all the men who flew in the same formation with him.\n\n‚ÄòHavermeyer, why the hell don‚Äôt you ever take evasive action?‚Äô they would demand in a rage after the mission.\n\n‚ÄòHey, you men leave Captain Havermeyer alone,‚Äô Colonel Cathcart would order. ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs the best damned bombardier we‚Äôve got.‚Äô Havermeyer grinned and nodded and tried to explain how he dumdummed the bullets with a hunting knife before he fired them at the field mice in his tent every night. Havermeyer was the best damned bombardier they had, but he flew straight and level all the way from the I.P. to the target, and even far beyond the target until he saw the falling bombs strike ground and explode in a darting spurt of abrupt orange that flashed beneath the swirling pall of smoke and pulverized debris geysering up wildly in huge, rolling waves of gray and black. Havermeyer held mortal men rigid in six planes as steady and still as sitting ducks while he followed the bombs all the way down through the plexiglass nose with deep interest and gave the German gunners below all the time they needed to set their sights and take their aim and pull their triggers or lanyards or switches or whatever the hell they did pull when they wanted to kill people they didn‚Äôt know.\n\nHavermeyer was a lead bombardier who never missed. Yossarian was a lead bombardier who had been demoted because he no longer gave a damn whether he missed or not. He had decided to live forever or die in the attempt, and his only mission each time he went up was to come down alive.\n\nThe men had loved flying behind Yossarian, who used to come barreling in over the target from all directions and every height, climbing and diving and twisting and turning so steeply and sharply that it was all the pilots of the other five planes could do to stay in formation with him, leveling out only for the two or three seconds it took for the bombs to drop and then zooming off again with an aching howl of engines, and wrenching his flight through the air so violently as he wove his way through the filthy barrages of flak that the six planes were soon flung out all over\n\nthe sky like prayers, each one a pushover for the German fighters, which was just fine with Yossarian, for there were no German fighters any more and he did not want any exploding planes near his when they exploded. Only when all the Sturm und Drang had been left far behind would he tip his flak helmet back wearily on his sweating head and stop barking directions to McWatt at the controls, who had nothing better to wonder about at a time like that than where the bombs had fallen.\n\n‚ÄòBomb bay clear,‚Äô Sergeant Knight in the back would announce. ‚ÄòDid we hit the bridge?‚Äô McWatt would ask.\n\n‚ÄòI couldn‚Äôt see, sir, I kept getting bounced around back here pretty hard and I couldn‚Äôt see. Everything‚Äôs covered with smoke now and I can‚Äôt see.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòHey, Aarfy, did the bombs hit the target?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòWhat target?‚Äô Captain Aardvaark, Yossarian‚Äôs plump, pipe-smoking navigator, would say from the confusion of maps he had created at Yossarian‚Äôs side in the nose of the ship. ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre at the target yet. Are we?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòYossarian, did the bombs hit the target?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòWhat bombs?‚Äô answered Yossarian, whose only concern had been the flak.\n\n‚ÄòOh, well,‚Äô McWatt would sing, ‚Äòwhat the hell.‚Äô Yossarian did not give a damn whether he hit the target or not, just as long as Havermeyer or one of the other lead bombardiers did and they never had to go back. Every now and then someone grew angry enough at Havermeyer to throw a punch at him.\n\n‚ÄòI said you men leave Captain Havermeyer alone,‚Äô Colonel Cathcart warned them all angrily. ‚ÄòI said he‚Äôs the best damned bombardier we‚Äôve got, didn‚Äôt I?‚Äô Havermeyer grinned at the colonel‚Äôs intervention and shoved another piece of peanut brittle inside his face.\n\nHavermeyer had grown very proficient at shooting field mice at night with the gun he had stolen from the dead man in Yossarian‚Äôs tent. His bait was a bar of candy and he would presight in the darkness as he sat waiting for the nibble with a finger of his other hand inside a loop of the line he had run from the frame of his mosquito net to\n\nthe chain of the unfrosted light bulb overhead. The line was taut as a banjo string, and the merest tug would snap it on and blind the shivering quarry in a blaze of light. Havermeyer would chortle exultantly as he watched the tiny mammal freeze and roll its terrified eyes about in frantic search of the intruder. Havermeyer would wait until the eyes fell upon his own and then he laughed aloud and pulled the trigger at the same time, showering the rank, furry body all over the tent with a reverberating crash and dispatching its timid soul back to his or her Creator.\n\nLate one night, Havermeyer fired a shot at a mouse that brought Hungry Joe bolting out at him barefoot, ranting at the top of his screechy voice and emptying his own.45 into Havermeyer‚Äôs tent as he came charging down one side of the ditch and up the other and vanished all at once inside one of the slit trenches that had appeared like magic beside every tent the morning after Milo Minderbinder had bombed the squadron. It was just before dawn during the Great Big Siege of Bologna, when tongueless dead men peopled the night hours like living ghosts and Hungry Joe was half out of his mind because he had finished his missions again and was not scheduled to fly. Hungry Joe was babbling incoherently when they fished him out from the dank bottom of the slit trench, babbling of snakes, rats and spiders. The others flashed their searchlights down just to make sure. There was nothing inside but a few inches of stagnant rain water.\n\n‚ÄòYou see?‚Äô cried Havermeyer. ‚ÄòI told you. I told you he was crazy, didn‚Äôt I?‚Äô\n\n‚Äî ¬ß ‚Äî\n\n04. ‚Äî Doc Daneeka\n\nHungry Joe was crazy, and no one knew it better than Yossarian, who did everything he could to help him. Hungry Joe just wouldn‚Äôt listen to Yossarian. Hungry Joe just wouldn‚Äôt listen because he thought Yossarian was crazy.\n\n‚ÄòWhy should he listen to you?‚Äô Doc Daneeka inquired of Yossarian without looking up.\n\n‚ÄòBecause he‚Äôs got troubles.‚Äô Doc Daneeka snorted scornfully. ‚ÄòHe thinks he‚Äôs got troubles? What about me?‚Äô Doc Daneeka continued slowly with a gloomy sneer. ‚ÄòOh, I‚Äôm not complaining. I know there‚Äôs a war on. I know a lot of people are going to have to suffer for us to win it. But why must I be one of them? Why don‚Äôt they draft some of these old doctors who keep shooting their kissers off in public about what big sacrifices the medical game stands ready to make? I don‚Äôt want to make sacrifices. I want to make dough.‚Äô Doc Daneeka was a very neat, clean man whose idea of a good time was to sulk. He had a dark complexion and a small, wise, saturnine face with mournful pouches under both eyes. He brooded over his health continually and went almost daily to the medical tent to have his temperature taken by one of the two enlisted men there who ran things for him practically on their own, and ran it so efficiently that he was left with little else to do but sit in the sunlight with his stuffed nose and wonder what other people were so worried about. Their names were Gus and Wes and they had succeeded in elevating medicine to an exact science. All men reporting on sick call with temperatures above 102 were rushed to the hospital. All those except Yossarian reporting on sick call with temperatures below 102 had their gums and toes painted with gentian violet solution and were given a laxative to throw away into the bushes. All those reporting on a sick call with temperatures of exactly 102 were asked to return in an hour to have their temperatures taken again. Yossarian, with his temperature of 101, could go to the hospital whenever he wanted to because he was not afraid of them.\n\nThe system worked just fine for everybody, especially for Doc Daneeka, who found himself with all the time he needed to watch old Major‚Äîde Coverley pitching horseshoes in his private horseshoe-pitching pit, still wearing the transparent eye patch Doc Daneeka had fashioned for him from the strip of celluloid stolen from Major Major‚Äôs orderly room window months before when Major‚Äîde Coverley had returned from Rome with an injured cornea after renting two apartments there for\n\nthe officers and enlisted men to use on their rest leaves. The only time Doc Daneeka ever went to the medical tent was the time he began to feel he was a very sick man each day and stopped in just to have Gus and Wes look him over. They could never find anything wrong with him. His temperature was always 96.8, which was perfectly all right with them, as long as he didn‚Äôt mind. Doc Daneeka did mind. He was beginning to lose confidence in Gus and Wes and was thinking of having them both transferred back to the motor pool and replaced by someone who could find something wrong.\n\nDoc Daneeka was personally familiar with a number of things that were drastically wrong. In addition to his health, he worried about the Pacific Ocean and flight time. Health was something no one ever could be sure of for a long enough time. The Pacific Ocean was a body of water surrounded on all sides by elephantiasis and other dread diseases to which, if he ever displeased Colonel Cathcart by grounding Yossarian, he might suddenly find himself transferred. And flight time was the time he had to spend in airplane flight each month in order to get his flight pay. Doc Daneeka hated to fly. He felt imprisoned in an airplane. In an airplane there was absolutely no place in the world to go except to another part of the airplane. Doc Daneeka had been told that people who enjoyed climbing into an airplane were really giving vent to a subconscious desire to climb back into the womb. He had been told this by Yossarian, who made it possible for Dan Daneeka to collect his flight pay each month without ever climbing back into the womb. Yossarian would persuade McWatt to enter Doc Daneeka‚Äôs name on his flight log for training missions or trips to Rome.\n\n‚ÄòYou know how it is,‚Äô Doc Daneeka had wheedled, with a sly, conspiratorial wink. ‚ÄòWhy take chances when I don‚Äôt have to?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòSure,‚Äô Yossarian agreed.\n\n‚ÄòWhat difference does it make to anyone if I‚Äôm in the plane or not?‚Äô ‚ÄòNo difference.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòSure, that‚Äôs what I mean,‚Äô Doc Daneeka said. ‚ÄòA little grease is what makes this world go round. One hand washes the other. Know what I mean? You scratch my back, I‚Äôll scratch yours.‚Äô Yossarian knew what he meant.\n\n‚ÄòThat‚Äôs not what I meant,‚Äô Doc Daneeka said, as Yossarian began scratching his back. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm talking about co-operation. Favors. You do a favor for me, I‚Äôll do one for you. Get it?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòDo one for me,‚Äô Yossarian requested. ‚ÄòNot a chance,‚Äô Doc Daneeka answered.\n\nThere was something fearful and minute about Doc Daneeka as he sat despondently outside his tent in the sunlight as often as he could, dressed in khaki summer trousers and a short-sleeved summer shirt that was bleached almost to an antiseptic gray by the daily laundering to which he had it subjected. He was like a man who had grown frozen with horror once and had never come completely unthawed. He sat all tucked up into himself, his slender shoulders huddled halfway around his head, his suntanned hands with their luminous silver fingernails massaging the backs of his bare, folded arms gently as though he were cold. Actually, he was a very warm, compassionate man who never stopped feeling sorry for himself.\n\n‚ÄòWhy me?‚Äô was his constant lament, and the question was a good one.\n\nYossarian knew it was a good one because Yossarian was a collector of good questions and had used them to disrupt the educational sessions Clevinger had once conducted two nights a week in Captain Black‚Äôs intelligence tent with the corporal in eyeglasses who everybody knew was probably a subversive. Captain Black knew he was a subversive because he wore eyeglasses and used words like panacea and utopia, and because he disapproved of Adolf Hitler, who had done such a great job of combating un-American activities in Germany. Yossarian attended the educational sessions because he wanted to find out why so many people were working so hard to kill him. A handful of other men were also interested, and the questions were many and good when Clevmger and the subversive corporal finished and made the mistake of asking if there were any.\n\n‚ÄòWho is Spain?‚Äô ‚ÄòWhy is Hitler?‚Äô ‚ÄòWhen is right?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòWhere was that stooped and mealy-colored old man I used to call Poppa when the merry-go-round broke down?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòHow was trump at Munich?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòHo-ho beriberi.‚Äô and ‚ÄòBalls!‚Äô all rang out in rapid succession, and then there was Yossarian with the question that had no answer: ‚ÄòWhere are the Snowdens of yesteryear?‚Äô The question upset them, because Snowden had been killed over Avignon when Dobbs went crazy in mid-air and seized the controls away from Huple.\n\nThe corporal played it dumb. ‚ÄòWhat?‚Äô he asked. ‚ÄòWhere are the Snowdens of yesteryear?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòI‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt understand.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòO√π sont les Neigedens d‚Äôantan?‚Äô Yossarian said to make it easier for him.\n\n‚ÄòParlez en anglais, for Christ‚Äôs sake,‚Äô said the corporal. ‚ÄòJe ne parle pas fran√ßais.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòNeither do I,‚Äô answered Yossarian, who was ready to pursue him through all the words in the world to wring the knowledge from him if he could, but Clevinger intervened, pale, thin, and laboring for breath, a humid coating of tears already glistening in his undernourished eyes.\n\nGroup Headquarters was alarmed, for there was no telling what people might find out once they felt free to ask whatever questions they wanted to. Colonel Cathcart sent Colonel Korn to stop it, and Colonel Korn succeeded with a rule governing the asking of questions. Colonel Korn‚Äôs rule was a stroke of genius, Colonel Korn explained in his report to Colonel Cathcart. Under Colonel Korn‚Äôs rule, the only people permitted to ask questions were those who never did. Soon the only people attending were those who never asked questions, and the sessions were discontinued altogether, since Clevinger, the corporal and Colonel Korn agreed that it was neither possible nor necessary to educate people who never questioned anything.\n\nColonel Cathcart and Lieutenant Colonel Korn lived and worked in the Group Headquarters building, as did all the members of the headquarters staff, with the\n\nexception of the chaplain. The Group Headquarters building was an enormous, windy, antiquated structure built of powdery red stone and banging plumbing. Behind the building was the modern skeet-shooting range that had been constructed by Colonel Cathcart for the exclusive recreation of the officers at Group and at which every officer and enlisted man on combat status now, thanks to General Dreedle, had to spend a minimum of eight hours a month.\n\nYossarian shot skeet, but never hit any. Appleby shot skeet and never missed. Yossarian was as bad at shooting skeet as he was at gambling. He could never win money gambling either. Even when he cheated he couldn‚Äôt win, because the people he cheated against were always better at cheating too. These were two disappointments to which he had resigned himself: he would never be a skeet shooter, and he would never make money.\n\n‚ÄòIt takes brains not to make money,‚Äô Colonel Cargill wrote in one of the homiletic memoranda he regularly prepared for circulation over General Peckem‚Äôs signature. ‚ÄòAny fool can make money these days and most of them do. But what about people with talent and brains? Name, for example, one poet who makes money.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòT. S. Eliot,‚Äô ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen said in his mail-sorting cubicle at Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters, and slammed down the telephone without identifying himself.\n\nColonel Cargill, in Rome, was perplexed. ‚ÄòWho was it?‚Äô asked General Peckem.\n\n‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know,‚Äô Colonel Cargill replied. ‚ÄòWhat did he want?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòWell, what did he say?‚Äô\n\n‚Äò‚ÄùT. S. Eliot‚Äù,‚Äô Colonel Cargill informed him. ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äô\n\n‚Äò‚ÄùT. S. Eliot‚Äù,‚Äô Colonel Cargill repeated. ‚ÄòJust ‚ÄúT. S. ‚Äî‚Äù‚Äò\n\n‚ÄòYes, sir. That‚Äôs all he said. Just ‚ÄúT. S. Eliot.‚Äù‚Äò\n\n‚ÄòI wonder what it means,‚Äô General Peckem reflected. Colonel Cargill wondered, too. ‚ÄòT. S. Eliot,‚Äô General Peckem mused.\n\n‚ÄòT. S. Eliot,‚Äô Colonel Cargill echoed with the same funereal puzzlement.\n\nGeneral Peckem roused himself after a moment with an unctuous and benignant smile. His expression was shrewd and sophisticated. His eyes gleamed maliciously. ‚ÄòHave someone get me General Dreedle,‚Äô he requested Colonel Cargill. ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt let him know who‚Äôs calling.‚Äô Colonel Cargill handed him the phone.\n\n‚ÄòT. S. Eliot,‚Äô General Peckem said, and hung up. ‚ÄòWho was it?‚Äô asked Colonel Moodus.\n\nGeneral Dreedle, in Corsica, did not reply. Colonel Moodus was General Dreedle‚Äôs son- in-law, and General Dreedle, at the insistence of his wife and against his own better judgment, had taken him into the military business. General Dreedle gazed at Colonel Moodus with level hatred. He detested the very sight of his son-in-law, who was his aide and therefore in constant attendance upon him. He had opposed his daughter‚Äôs marriage to Colonel Moodus because he disliked attending weddings. Wearing a menacing and preoccupied scowl, General Dreedle moved to the full-length mirror in his office and stared at his stocky reflection. He had a grizzled, broad-browed head with iron-gray tufts over his eyes and a blunt and belligerent jaw. He brooded in ponderous speculation over the cryptic message he had just received. Slowly his face softened with an idea, and he curled his lips with wicked pleasure.\n\n‚ÄòGet Peckem,‚Äô he told Colonel Moodus. ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt let the bastard know who‚Äôs calling.‚Äô ‚ÄòWho was it?‚Äô asked Colonel Cargill, back in Rome.\n\n‚ÄòThat same person,‚Äô General Peckem replied with a definite trace of alarm. ‚ÄòNow he‚Äôs after me.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòWhat did he want?‚Äô ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know.‚Äô ‚ÄòWhat did he say?‚Äô ‚ÄòThe same thing.‚Äô ‚Äò‚ÄùT. S. Eliot‚Äù?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòYes, ‚ÄúT. S. Eliot.‚Äù That‚Äôs all he said.‚Äô General Peckem had a hopeful thought. ‚ÄòPerhaps it‚Äôs a new code or something, like the colors of the day. Why don‚Äôt you have someone check with Communications and see if it‚Äôs a new code or something or the colors of the day?‚Äô Communications answered that T. S. Eliot was not a new code or the colors of the day.\n\nColonel Cargill had the next idea. ‚ÄòMaybe I ought to phone Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters and see if they know anything about it. They have a clerk up there named Wintergreen I‚Äôm pretty close to. He‚Äôs the one who tipped me off that our prose was too prolix.‚Äô Ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen told Cargill that there was no record at Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters of a T. S. Eliot.\n\n‚ÄòHow‚Äôs our prose these days?‚Äô Colonel Cargill decided to inquire while he had ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen on the phone. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs much better now, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòIt‚Äôs still too prolix,‚Äô ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen replied.\n\n‚ÄòIt wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if General Dreedle were behind the whole thing,‚Äô General Peckem confessed at last. ‚ÄòRemember what he did to that skeet-shooting range?‚Äô General Dreedle had thrown open Colonel Cathcart‚Äôs private skeet-shooting range to every officer and enlisted man in the group on combat duty. General Dreedle wanted his men to spend as much time out on the skeet-shooting range as the facilities and their flight schedule would allow. Shooting skeet eight hours a month was excellent training for them. It trained them to shoot skeet.\n\nDunbar loved shooting skeet because he hated every minute of it and the time passed so slowly. He had figured out that a single hour on the skeet-shooting range with people like Havermeyer and Appleby could be worth as much as eleven-times- seventeen years.\n\n‚ÄòI think you‚Äôre crazy,‚Äô was the way Clevinger had responded to Dunbar ‚Äôs discovery. ‚ÄòWho wants to know?‚Äô Dunbar answered.\n\n‚ÄòI mean it,‚Äô Clevinger insisted. ‚ÄòWho cares?‚Äô Dunbar answered.\n\n‚ÄòI really do. I‚Äôll even go so far as to concede that life seems longer I‚Äî‚Äô ‚Äò‚Äîis longer I‚Äî‚Äô\n\n‚Äò‚Äîis longer‚ÄîIs longer? All right, is longer if it‚Äôs filled with periods of boredom and discomfort, b‚Äî‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòGuess how fast?‚Äô Dunbar said suddenly. ‚ÄòHuh?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòThey go,‚Äô Dunbar explained. ‚ÄòYears.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòYears.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòYears,‚Äô said Dunbar. ‚ÄòYears, years, years.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòClevinger, why don‚Äôt you let Dunbar alone?‚Äô Yossarian broke in. ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt you realize the toll this is taking?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòIt‚Äôs all right,‚Äô said Dunbar magnanimously. ‚ÄòI have some decades to spare. Do you know how long a year takes when it‚Äôs going away?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòAnd you shut up also,‚Äô Yossarian told Orr, who had begun to snigger.\n\n‚ÄòI was just thinking about that girl,‚Äô Orr said. ‚ÄòThat girl in Sicily. That girl in Sicily with the bald head.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòYou‚Äôd better shut up also,‚Äô Yossarian warned him.\n\n‚ÄòIt‚Äôs your fault,‚Äô Dunbar said to Yossarian. ‚ÄòWhy don‚Äôt you let him snigger if he wants to? It‚Äôs better than having him talking.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòAll right. Go ahead and snigger if you want to.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòDo you know how long a year takes when it‚Äôs going away?‚Äô Dunbar repeated to Clevinger. ‚ÄòThis long.‚Äô He snapped his fingers. ‚ÄòA second ago you were stepping into college with your lungs full of fresh air. Today you‚Äôre an old man.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòOld?‚Äô asked Clevinger with surprise. ‚ÄòWhat are you talking about?‚Äô ‚ÄòOld.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòI‚Äôm not old.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòYou‚Äôre inches away from death every time you go on a mission. How much older can you be at your age? A half minute before that you were stepping into high school, and an unhooked brassiere was as close as you ever hoped to get to Paradise. Only a fifth of a second before that you were a small kid with a ten-week summer vacation that lasted a hundred thousand years and still ended too soon. Zip! They go rocketing by so fast. How the hell else are you ever going to slow time down?‚Äô Dunbar was almost angry when he finished.\n\n‚ÄòWell, maybe it is true,‚Äô Clevinger conceded unwillingly in a subdued tone. ‚ÄòMaybe a long life does have to be filled with many unpleasant conditions if it‚Äôs to seem long. But in that event, who wants one?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòI do,‚Äô Dunbar told him. ‚ÄòWhy?‚Äô Clevinger asked.\n\n‚ÄòWhat else is there?‚Äô\n\nChapter 5\n\nChief White Halfoat\n\nDoc Daneeka lived in a splotched gray tent with Chief White Halfoat, whom he feared and despised.\n\n‚ÄòI can just picture his liver,‚Äô Doc Daneeka grumbled. ‚ÄòPicture my liver,‚Äô Yossarian advised him.\n\n‚ÄòThere‚Äôs nothing wrong with your liver.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòThat shows how much you don‚Äôt know,‚Äô Yossarian bluffed, and told Doc Daneeka about the troublesome pain in his liver that had troubled Nurse Duckett and Nurse Cramer and all the doctors in the hospital because it wouldn‚Äôt become jaundice and wouldn‚Äôt go away.\n\nDoc Daneeka wasn‚Äôt interested. ‚ÄòYou think you‚Äôve got troubles?‚Äô he wanted to know. ‚ÄòWhat about me? You should‚Äôve been in my office the day those newlyweds walked in.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòWhat newlyweds?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòThose newlyweds that walked into my office one day. Didn‚Äôt I ever tell you about them? She was lovely.‚Äô So was Doc Daneeka‚Äôs office. He had decorated his waiting room with goldfish and one of the finest suites of cheap furniture. Whatever he could he bought on credit, even the goldfish. For the rest, he obtained money from greedy relatives in exchange for shares of the profits. His office was in Staten Island in a two-family firetrap just four blocks away from the ferry stop and only one block south of a supermarket, three beauty parlors, and two corrupt druggists. It was a corner location, but nothing helped. Population turnover was small, and people clung through habit to the same physicians they had been doing business with for years. Bills piled up rapidly, and he was soon faced with the loss of his most precious medical instruments: his adding machine was repossessed, and then his typewriter. The goldfish died. Fortunately, just when things were blackest, the war broke out.\n\n‚ÄòIt was a godsend,‚Äô Doc Daneeka confessed solemnly. ‚ÄòMost of the other doctors were soon in the service, and things picked up overnight. The corner location really started\n\npaying off, and I soon found myself handling more patients than I could handle competently. I upped my kickback fee with those two drugstores. The beauty parlors were good for two, three abortions a week. Things couldn‚Äôt have been better, and then look what happened. They had to send a guy from the draft board around to look me over. I was Four-F. I had examined myself pretty thoroughly and discovered that I was unfit for military service. You‚Äôd think my word would be enough, wouldn‚Äôt you, since I was a doctor in good standing with my county medical society and with my local Better Business Bureau. But no, it wasn‚Äôt, and they sent this guy around just to make sure I really did have one leg amputated at the hip and was helplessly bedridden with incurable rheumatoid arthritis. Yossarian, we live in an age of distrust and deteriorating spiritual values. It‚Äôs a terrible thing,‚Äô Doc Daneeka protested in a voice quavering with strong emotion. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a terrible thing when even the word of a licensed physician is suspected by the country he loves.‚Äô Doc Daneeka had been drafted and shipped to Pianosa as a flight surgeon, even though he was terrified of flying.\n\n‚ÄòI don‚Äôt have to go looking for trouble in an airplane,‚Äô he noted, blinking his beady, brown, offended eyes myopically. ‚ÄòIt comes looking for me. Like that virgin I‚Äôm telling you about that couldn‚Äôt have a baby.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòWhat virgin?‚Äô Yossarian asked. ‚ÄòI thought you were telling me about some newlyweds.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòThat‚Äôs the virgin I‚Äôm telling you about. They were just a couple of young kids, and they‚Äôd been married, oh, a little over a year when they came walking into my office without an appointment. You should have seen her. She was so sweet and young and pretty. She even blushed when I asked about her periods. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever stop loving that girl. She was built like a dream and wore a chain around her neck with a medal of Saint Anthony hanging down inside the most beautiful bosom I never saw. ‚ÄúIt must be a terrible temptation for Saint Anthony,‚Äù I joked‚Äîjust to put her at ease, you know. ‚ÄúSaint Anthony?‚Äù her husband said. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Saint Anthony?‚Äù ‚ÄúAsk your wife,‚Äù I told him. ‚ÄúShe can tell you who Saint Anthony is.‚Äù ‚ÄúWho is Saint Anthony?‚Äù he asked her. ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù she wanted to know. ‚ÄúSaint Anthony,‚Äù he told her. ‚ÄúSaint Anthony?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Saint Anthony?‚Äù When I got a good look at her inside my examination room I found she was still a virgin. I spoke to her husband alone while she was pulling her girdle back on and hooking it onto her stockings. ‚ÄúEvery night,‚Äù he boasted. A real wise guy, you know. ‚ÄúI never miss a night,‚Äù he boasted. He meant it, too. ‚ÄúI even been puttin‚Äô it to her mornings before the breakfasts she makes me before we go to work,‚Äù he boasted. There was only one\n\nexplanation. When I had them both together again I gave them a demonstration of intercourse with the rubber models I‚Äôve got in my office. I‚Äôve got these rubber models in my office with all the reproductive organs of both sexes that I keep locked up in separate cabinets to avoid a scandal. I mean I used to have them. I don‚Äôt have anything any more, not even a practice. The only thing I have now is this low temperature that I‚Äôm really starting to worry about. Those two kids I‚Äôve got working for me in the medical tent aren‚Äôt worth a damn as diagnosticians. All they know how to do is complain. They think they‚Äôve got troubles? What about me? They should have been in my office that day with those two newlyweds looking at me as though I were telling them something nobody‚Äôd ever heard of before. You never saw anybody so interested. ‚ÄúYou mean like this?‚Äù he asked me, and worked the models for himself awhile. You know, I can see where a certain type of person might get a big kick out of doing just that. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it,‚Äù I told him. ‚ÄúNow, you go home and try it my way for a few months and see what happens. Okay?‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù they said, and paid me in cash without any argument. ‚ÄúHave a good time,‚Äù I told them, and they thanked me and walked out together. He had his arm around her waist as though he couldn‚Äôt wait to get her home and put it to her again. A few days later he came back all by himself and told my nurse he had to see me right away. As soon as we were alone, he punched me in the nose.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòHe did what?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòHe called me a wise guy and punched me in the nose. ‚ÄúWhat are you, a wise guy?‚Äù he said, and knocked me flat on my ass. Pow! Just like that. I‚Äôm not kidding.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòI know you‚Äôre not kidding,‚Äô Yossarian said. ‚ÄòBut why did he do it?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòHow should I know why he did it?‚Äô Doc Daneeka retorted with annoyance.\n\n‚ÄòMaybe it had something to do with Saint Anthony?‚Äô Doc Daneeka looked at Yossarian blankly. ‚ÄòSaint Anthony?‚Äô he asked with astonishment. ‚ÄòWho‚Äôs Saint Anthony?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòHow should I know?‚Äô answered Chief White Halfoat, staggering inside the tent just then with a bottle of whiskey cradled in his arm and sitting himself down pugnaciously between the two of them.\n\nDoc Daneeka rose without a word and moved his chair outside the tent, his back bowed by the compact kit of injustices that was his perpetual burden. He could not bear the company of his roommate.\n\nChief White Halfoat thought he was crazy. ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the matter with that guy,‚Äô he observed reproachfully. ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs got no brains, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs the matter with him. If he had any brains he‚Äôd grab a shovel and start digging. Right here in the tent, he‚Äôd start digging, right under my cot. He‚Äôd strike oil in no time. Don‚Äôt he know how that enlisted man struck oil with a shovel back in the States? Didn‚Äôt he ever hear what happened to that kid‚Äîwhat was the name of that rotten rat bastard pimp of a snotnose back in Colorado?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòWintergreen.‚Äô ‚ÄòWintergreen.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòHe‚Äôs afraid,‚Äô Yossarian explained.\n\n‚ÄòOh, no. Not Wintergreen.‚Äô Chief White Halfoat shook his head with undisguised admiration. ‚ÄòThat stinking little punk wise-guy son of a bitch ain‚Äôt afraid of nobody.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòDoc Daneeka‚Äôs afraid. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs the matter with him.‚Äô ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs he afraid of?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòHe‚Äôs afraid of you,‚Äô Yossarian said. ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs afraid you‚Äôre going to die of pneumonia.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòHe‚Äôd better be afraid,‚Äô Chief White Halfoat said. A deep, low laugh rumbled through his massive chest. ‚ÄòI will, too, the first chance I get. You just wait and see.‚Äô Chief White Halfoat was a handsome, swarthy Indian from Oklahoma with a heavy, hard- boned face and tousled black hair, a half-blooded Cree from Enid who, for occult reasons of his own, had made up his mind to die of pneumonia. He was a glowering, vengeful, disillusioned Indian who hated foreigners with names like Cathcart, Korn, Black and Havermeyer and wished they‚Äôd all go back to where their lousy ancestors had come from.\n\n‚ÄòYou wouldn‚Äôt believe it, Yossarian,‚Äô he ruminated, raising his voice deliberately to bait Doc Daneeka, ‚Äòbut this used to be a pretty good country to live in before they loused\n\nit up with their goddam piety.‚Äô Chief White Halfoat was out to revenge himself upon the white man. He could barely read or write and had been assigned to Captain Black as assistant intelligence officer.\n\n‚ÄòHow could I learn to read or write?‚Äô Chief White Halfoat demanded with simulated belligerence, raising his voice again so that Doc Daneeka would hear. ‚ÄòEvery place we pitched our tent, they sank an oil well. Every time they sank a well, they hit oil. And every time they hit oil, they made us pack up our tent and go someplace else. We were human divining rods. Our whole family had a natural affinity for petroleum deposits, and soon every oil company in the world had technicians chasing us around. We were always on the move. It was one hell of a way to bring a child up, I can tell you. I don‚Äôt think I ever spent more than a week in one place.‚Äô His earliest memory was of a geologist.\n\n‚ÄòEvery time another White Halfoat was born,‚Äô he continued, ‚Äòthe stock market turned bullish. Soon whole drilling crews were following us around with all their equipment just to get the jump on each other. Companies began to merge just so they could cut down on the number of people they had to assign to us. But the crowd in back of us kept growing. We never got a good night‚Äôs sleep. When we stopped, they stopped. When we moved, they moved, chuckwagons, bulldozers, derricks, generators. We were a walking business boom, and we began to receive invitations from some of the best hotels just for the amount of business we would drag into town with us. Some of those invitations were mighty generous, but we couldn‚Äôt accept any because we were Indians and all the best hotels that were inviting us wouldn‚Äôt accept Indians as guests. Racial prejudice is a terrible thing, Yossarian. It really is. It‚Äôs a terrible thing to treat a decent, loyal Indian like a nigger, kike, wop or spic.‚Äô Chief White Halfoat nodded slowly with conviction.\n\n‚ÄòThen, Yossarian, it finally happened‚Äîthe beginning of the end. They began to follow us around from in front. They would try to guess where we were going to stop next and would begin drilling before we even got there, so we couldn‚Äôt stop. As soon as we‚Äôd begin to unroll our blankets, they would kick us off. They had confidence in us. They wouldn‚Äôt even wait to strike oil before they kicked us off. We were so tired we almost didn‚Äôt care the day our time ran out. One morning we found ourselves completely surrounded by oilmen waiting for us to come their way so they could kick us off. Everywhere you looked there was an oilman on a ridge, waiting there like Indians getting ready to attack. It was the end. We couldn‚Äôt stay where we were because we had just been kicked off. And there was no place left for us to go. Only\n\nthe Army saved me. Luckily, the war broke out just in the nick of time, and a draft board picked me right up out of the middle and put me down safely in Lowery Field, Colorado. I was the only survivor.‚Äô Yossarian knew he was lying, but did not interrupt as Chief White Halfoat went on to claim that he had never heard from his parents again. That didn‚Äôt bother him too much, though, for he had only their word for it that they were his parents, and since they had lied to him about so many other things, they could just as well have been lying to him about that too. He was much better acquainted with the fate of a tribe of first cousins who had wandered away north in a diversionary movement and pushed inadvertently into Canada. When they tried to return, they were stopped at the border by American immigration authorities who would not let them back into the country. They could not come back in because they were red.\n\nIt was a horrible joke, but Doc Daneeka didn‚Äôt laugh until Yossarian came to him one mission later and pleaded again, without any real expectation of success, to be grounded. Doc Daneeka snickered once and was soon immersed in problems of his own, which included Chief White Halfoat, who had been challenging him all that morning to Indian wrestle, and Yossarian, who decided right then and there to go crazy.\n\n‚ÄòYou‚Äôre wasting your time,‚Äô Doc Daneeka was forced to tell him. ‚ÄòCan‚Äôt you ground someone who‚Äôs crazy?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòOh, sure. I have to. There‚Äôs a rule saying I have to ground anyone who‚Äôs crazy.‚Äô ‚ÄòThen why don‚Äôt you ground me? I‚Äôm crazy. Ask Clevinger.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòClevinger? Where is Clevinger? You find Clevinger and I‚Äôll ask him.‚Äô ‚ÄòThen ask any of the others. They‚Äôll tell you how crazy I am.‚Äô ‚ÄòThey‚Äôre crazy.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòThen why don‚Äôt you ground them?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòWhy don‚Äôt they ask me to ground them?‚Äô ‚ÄòBecause they‚Äôre crazy, that‚Äôs why.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòOf course they‚Äôre crazy,‚Äô Doc Daneeka replied. ‚ÄòI just told you they‚Äôre crazy, didn‚Äôt I? And you can‚Äôt let crazy people decide whether you‚Äôre crazy or not, can you?‚Äô Yossarian looked at him soberly and tried another approach. ‚ÄòIs Orr crazy?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòHe sure is,‚Äô Doc Daneeka said. ‚ÄòCan you ground him?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòI sure can. But first he has to ask me to. That‚Äôs part of the rule.‚Äô ‚ÄòThen why doesn‚Äôt he ask you to?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòBecause he‚Äôs crazy,‚Äô Doc Daneeka said. ‚ÄòHe has to be crazy to keep flying combat missions after all the close calls he‚Äôs had. Sure, I can ground Orr. But first he has to ask me to.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòThat‚Äôs all he has to do to be grounded?‚Äô ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs all. Let him ask me.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòAnd then you can ground him?‚Äô Yossarian asked. ‚ÄòNo. Then I can‚Äôt ground him.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòYou mean there‚Äôs a catch?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòSure there‚Äôs a catch,‚Äô Doc Daneeka replied. ‚ÄòCatch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn‚Äôt really crazy.‚Äô There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one‚Äôs own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn‚Äôt, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn‚Äôt have to; but if he didn‚Äôt want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.\n\n‚ÄòThat‚Äôs some catch, that Catch-22,‚Äô he observed. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs the best there is,‚Äô Doc Daneeka agreed.\n\nYossarian saw it clearly in all its spinning reasonableness. There was an elliptical precision about its perfect pairs of parts that was graceful and shocking, like good modern art, and at times Yossarian wasn‚Äôt quite sure that he saw it at all, just the way he was never quite sure about good modern art or about the flies Orr saw in Appleby‚Äôs eyes. He had Orr‚Äôs word to take for the flies in Appleby‚Äôs eyes.\n\n‚ÄòOh, they‚Äôre there, all right,‚Äô Orr had assured him about the flies in Appleby‚Äôs eyes after Yossarian‚Äôs fist fight with Appleby in the officers‚Äô club, ‚Äòalthough he probably doesn‚Äôt even know it. That‚Äôs why he can‚Äôt see things as they really are.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòHow come he doesn‚Äôt know it?‚Äô inquired Yossarian.\n\n‚ÄòBecause he‚Äôs got flies in his eyes,‚Äô Orr explained with exaggerated patience. ‚ÄòHow can he see he‚Äôs got flies in his eyes if he‚Äôs got flies in his eyes?‚Äô It made as much sense as anything else, and Yossarian was willing to give Orr the benefit of the doubt because Orr was from the wilderness outside New York City and knew so much more about wildlife than Yossarian did, and because Orr, unlike Yossarian‚Äôs mother, father, sister, brother, aunt, uncle, in-law, teacher, spiritual leader, legislator, neighbor and newspaper, had never lied to him about anything crucial before. Yossarian had mulled his newfound knowledge about Appleby over in private for a day or two and then decided, as a good deed, to pass the word along to Appleby himself.\n\n‚ÄòAppleby, you‚Äôve got flies in your eyes,‚Äô he whispered helpfully as they passed by each other in the doorway of the parachute tent on the day of the weekly milk run to Parma.\n\n‚ÄòWhat?‚Äô Appleby responded sharply, thrown into confusion by the fact that Yossarian had spoken to him at all.\n\n‚ÄòYou‚Äôve got flies in your eyes,‚Äô Yossarian repeated. ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs probably why you can‚Äôt see them.‚Äô Appleby retreated from Yossarian with a look of loathing bewilderment and sulked in silence until he was in the jeep with Havermeyer riding down the long, straight road to the briefing room, where Major Danby, the fidgeting group operations officer, was waiting to conduct the preliminary briefing with all the lead\n\npilots, bombardiers and navigators. Appleby spoke in a soft voice so that he would not be heard by the driver or by Captain Black, who was stretched out with his eyes closed in the front seat of the jeep.\n\n‚ÄòHavermeyer,‚Äô he asked hesitantly. ‚ÄòHave I got flies in my eyes?‚Äô Havermeyer blinked quizzically. ‚ÄòSties?‚Äô he asked.\n\n‚ÄòNo, flies,‚Äô he was told. Havermeyer blinked again. ‚ÄòFlies?‚Äô ‚ÄòIn my eyes.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòYou must be crazy,‚Äô Havermeyer said.\n\n‚ÄòNo, I‚Äôm not crazy. Yossarian‚Äôs crazy. Just tell me if I‚Äôve got flies in my eyes or not. Go ahead. I can take it.‚Äô Havermeyer popped another piece of peanut brittle into his mouth and peered very closely into Appleby‚Äôs eyes.\n\n‚ÄòI don‚Äôt see any,‚Äô he announced.\n\nAppleby heaved an immense sigh of relief. Havermeyer had tiny bits of peanut brittle adhering to his lips, chin and cheeks.\n\n‚ÄòYou‚Äôve got peanut brittle crumbs on your face,‚Äô Appleby remarked to him.\n\n‚ÄòI‚Äôd rather have peanut brittle crumbs on my face than flies in my eyes,‚Äô Havermeyer retorted.\n\nThe officers of the other five planes in each flight arrived in trucks for the general briefing that took place thirty minutes later. The three enlisted men in each crew were not briefed at all, but were carried directly out on the airfield to the separate planes in which they were scheduled to fly that day, where they waited around with the ground crew until the officers with whom they had been scheduled to fly swung off the rattling tailgates of the trucks delivering them and it was time to climb aboard and start up. Engines rolled over disgruntedly on lollipop-shaped hardstands, resisting first, then idling smoothly awhile, and then the planes lumbered around and nosed forward lamely over the pebbled ground like sightless, stupid, crippled things\n\nuntil they taxied into the line at the foot of the landing strip and took off swiftly, one behind the other, in a zooming, rising roar, banking slowly into formation over mottled treetops, and circling the field at even speed until all the flights of six had been formed and then setting course over cerulean water on the first leg of the journey to the target in northern Italy or France. The planes gained altitude steadily and were above nine thousand feet by the time they crossed into enemy territory. One of the surprising things always was the sense of calm and utter silence, broken only by the test rounds fired from the machine guns, by an occasional toneless, terse remark over the intercom, and, at last, by the sobering pronouncement of the bombardier in each plane that they were at the I.P. and about to turn toward the target. There was always sunshine, always a tiny sticking in the throat from the rarefied air.\n\nThe B-25s they flew in were stable, dependable, dull-green ships with twin rudders and engines and wide wings. Their single fault, from where Yossarian sat as a bombardier, was the tight crawlway separating the bombardier‚Äôs compartment in the plexiglass nose from the nearest escape hatch. The crawlway was a narrow, square, cold tunnel hollowed out beneath the flight controls, and a large man like Yossarian could squeeze through only with difficulty. A chubby, moon-faced navigator with little reptilian eyes and a pipe like Aarfy‚Äôs had trouble, too, and Yossarian used to chase him back from the nose as they turned toward the target, now minutes away. There was a time of tension then, a time of waiting with nothing to hear and nothing to see and nothing to do but wait as the antiaircraft guns below took aim and made ready to knock them all sprawling into infinite sleep if they could.\n\nThe crawlway was Yossarian‚Äôs lifeline to outside from a plane about to fall, but Yossarian swore at it with seething antagonism, reviled it as an obstacle put there by providence as part of the plot that would destroy him. There was room for an additional escape hatch right there in the nose of a B-25, but there was no escape hatch. Instead there was the crawlway, and since the mess on the mission over Avignon he had learned to detest every mammoth inch of it, for it slung him seconds and seconds away from his parachute, which was too bulky to be taken up front with him, and seconds and seconds more after that away from the escape hatch on the floor between the rear of the elevated flight deck and the feet of the faceless top turret gunner mounted high above. Yossarian longed to be where Aarfy could be once Yossarian had chased him back from the nose; Yossarian longed to sit on the floor in a huddled ball right on top of the escape hatch inside a sheltering igloo of extra flak suits that he would have been happy to carry along with him, his parachute already\n\nhooked to his harness where it belonged, one fist clenching the red-handled rip cord, one fist gripping the emergency hatch release that would spill him earthward into the air at the first dreadful squeal of destruction. That was where he wanted to be if he had to be there at all, instead of hung out there in front like some goddam cantilevered goldfish in some goddam cantilevered goldfish bowl while the goddam foul black tiers of flak were bursting and booming and billowing all around and above and below him in a climbing, cracking, staggered, banging, phantasmagorical, cosmological wickedness that jarred and tossed and shivered, clattered and pierced, and threatened to annihilate them all in one splinter of a second in one vast flash of fire.\n\nAarfy had been no use to Yossarian as a navigator or as anything else, and Yossarian drove him back from the nose vehemently each time so that they would not clutter up each other‚Äôs way if they had to scramble suddenly for safety. Once Yossarian had driven him back from the nose, Aarfy was free to cower on the floor where Yossarian longed to cower, but he stood bolt upright instead with his stumpy arms resting comfortably on the backs of the pilot‚Äôs and co-pilot‚Äôs seats, pipe in hand, making affable small talk to McWatt and whoever happened to be co-pilot and pointing out amusing trivia in the sky to the two men, who were too busy to be interested. McWatt was too busy responding at the controls to Yossarian‚Äôs strident instructions as Yossarian slipped the plane in on the bomb run and then whipped them all away violently around the ravenous pillars of exploding shells with curt, shrill, obscene commands to McWatt that were much like the anguished, entreating nightmare yelpings of Hungry Joe in the dark. Aarfy would puff reflectively on his pipe throughout the whole chaotic clash, gazing with unruffled curiosity at the war through McWatt‚Äôs window as though it were a remote disturbance that could not affect him. Aarfy was a dedicated fraternity man who loved cheerleading and class reunions and did not have brains enough to be afraid. Yossarian did have brains enough and was, and the only thing that stopped him from abandoning his post under fire and scurrying back through the crawlway like a yellow-bellied rat was his unwillingness to entrust the evasive action out of the target area to anybody else. There was nobody else in the world he would honor with so great a responsibility. There was nobody else he knew who was as big a coward. Yossarian was the best man in the group at evasive action, but had no idea why.\n\nThere was no established procedure for evasive action. All you needed was fear, and Yossarian had plenty of that, more fear than Orr or Hungry Joe, more fear than Dunbar, who had resigned himself submissively to the idea that he must die someday.\n\nYossarian had not resigned himself to that idea, and he bolted for his life wildly on each mission the instant his bombs were away, hollering, ‚ÄòHard, hard, hard, hard, you bastard, hard!‚Äô at McWatt and hating McWatt viciously all the time as though McWatt were to blame for their being up there at all to be rubbed out by strangers, and everybody else in the plane kept off the intercom, except for the pitiful time of the mess on the mission to Avignon when Dobbs went crazy in mid-air and began weeping pathetically for help.\n\n‚ÄòHelp him, help him,‚Äô Dobbs sobbed. ‚ÄòHelp him, help him.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄòHelp who? Help who?‚Äô called back Yossarian, once he had plugged his headset back into the intercom system, after it had been jerked out when Dobbs wrested the controls away from Huple and hurled them all down suddenly into the deafening, paralyzing, horrifying dive which had plastered Yossarian helplessly to the ceiling of the plane by the top of his head and from which Huple had rescued them just in time by seizing the controls back from Dobbs and leveling the ship out almost as suddenly right back in the middle of the buffeting layer of cacophonous flak from which they had escaped successfully only a moment before. Oh, God! Oh, God, oh, God, Yossarian had been pleading wordlessly as he dangled from the ceiling of the nose of the ship by the top of his head, unable to move.\n\n‚ÄòThe bombardier, the bombardier,‚Äô Dobbs answered in a cry when Yossarian spoke. ‚ÄòHe doesn‚Äôt answer, he doesn‚Äôt answer. Help the bombardier, help the bomba"
