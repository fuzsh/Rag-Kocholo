        "text": "Summary\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Novels, Last Lines Quiz\n\nCatch-22 exhibits a bewildering chronology, with its beginning taking place more than halfway through the events described, and it proceeds in a series of looping flashbacks. Most of the novel takes place on the Mediterranean island of Pianosa in 1944, where Yossarian is a bombardier serving under the indecisive and ambitious Colonel Cathcart, who continually raises the number of missions the men are required to fly before their tours of duty are completed. Yossarian is promoted to captain after a mission in Ferrara, Italy, in which, after missing a bridge, he flies back a second time and successfully destroys it, though a squadron member is killed.\n\nYossarian shares a tent with Orr, who crashes his plane on every mission but always survives, and with the belongings of Mudd, who was killed in action two hours after his arrival on base but before being officially checked in. The mess officer, Milo Minderbinder, gradually turns his mission to acquire food into an international black-market syndicate in which he eventually enlists the enemy Germans, at one point even having German planes (bearing the logo of his syndicate) bomb his own base (resulting in Mudd’s death). Other characters include the flight surgeon Doc Daneeka and Hungry Joe, who suffers screaming nightmares except when he has missions to fly.\n\nThe central event of the story is a raid on Avignon, France. During the mission the incompetent copilot Dobbs seizes the controls from Huple, the 15-year-old pilot, and the radio-gunner, Snowden, is killed. His grisly death has a profound effect on Yossarian, who appears naked at the next formation and at Snowden’s funeral. From that point on, Yossarian, acutely aware of his mortality, strives to avoid death at all costs. In an attempt to cancel a dangerous raid on Bologna, Italy, Yossarian convinces Colonel Korn that the enemy has a weapon that can glue a formation of planes together in midflight. Although the mission is eventually approved, Yossarian, flying with pilot Kid Sampson and copilot Nately, pretends that the intercom is broken in order to force them back to base early. The rest of the squadron returns unharmed. On another raid Yossarian’s plane is hit, largely due to the incompetence of the navigator, Aarfy, but it lands safely. Later Yossarian fakes an illness in order to take refuge in the hospital, a tactic he uses frequently to avoid combat.\n\nDuring a mission to Leghorn, Italy, Yossarian suffers a leg wound that results in his being hospitalized again. While there he and airman Dunbar take on the identities of other patients. After putting his hand up Nurse Duckett’s skirt, Yossarian is sent to the hospital psychiatrist, who concludes that he is crazy and should go home. However, because the psychiatrist thought he was examining A. Fortiori, it is Fortiori who gets sent home.\n\nAfter returning to his tent, Yossarian declines Orr’s request to fly with him, and on his next mission Orr crashes into the Mediterranean and does not return. Cathcart then orders an attack on an undefended village in order to produce pleasing photographs for General Peckem. Dunbar, however, dumps his bombs a safe distance from the village. On a subsequent training run Yossarian threatens to strangle the pilot McWatt for performing dangerous aerial stunts. Later McWatt playfully buzzes the beach in his plane and accidentally slices Kid Sampson in half; he then deliberately crashes his plane into a mountain. Because Doc Daneeka was falsely listed on McWatt’s manifest, it is assumed that he also died, and he is thereafter unable to convince anyone, including his wife, that he remains alive.\n\nAfter four young recruits are assigned to Yossarian’s tent, Yossarian escapes to Rome with Hungry Joe. While there Yossarian helps Nately rescue a prostitute being held by some senior officers. Nately is in love with the woman, and she now returns his affections. Later Nurse Duckett tells Yossarian that she has overheard a plan to “disappear” Dunbar; after that, Yossarian cannot find Dunbar. The number of required missions is raised to 80, and both Dobbs and Nately are killed in combat. Yossarian begins walking backward and refuses to fly more missions. He is sent to Rome to rest. When he tells the prostitute about Nately’s death, she blames Yossarian and makes repeated attempts to kill him, even after he returns to Pianosa. However, when he learns that military police have emptied the brothel, he travels to Rome without permission. He is unable to find either the prostitute or her younger sister, and Rome has become shockingly barbarous. He goes to the officers’ apartment, where he finds that Aarfy has raped and killed a maid. The military police arrive and arrest Yossarian for being in Rome without a pass."
