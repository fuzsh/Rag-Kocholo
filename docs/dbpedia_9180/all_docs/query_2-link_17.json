        "text": "The title of Joseph Heller’s novel, written in 1953 and published in 1961, (properly titled ‘Catch-22’ – with a hyphen). The first chapter was also published in a magazine in 1955, under the title ‘Catch-18’.\n\nThe paradox is presented as the trap that confined members of the US Air Force. The ‘catch’ was this:\n\nIt was effectively impossible to be exempted from highly dangerous bombing missions on the grounds of insanity.\n\nAnyone who applied for exemption proved himself to be sane (after all, that’s what any sane person would do).\n\nAnyone who didn’t apply must be crazy (after all, it was so dangerous).\n\nSo, those who applied for exemption were considered sane and those who were insane didn’t apply. Either way, sane or insane, they were sent on the missions.\n\nThis might be described logically as, ‘damned if you do and damned if you don’t‘, ‘the vicious circle‘, ‘a chicken and egg situation‘, or ‘heads I win, tails you lose‘.\n\nIn the book, this is explained thus:\n\nYossarian looked at him soberly and tried another approach. “Is Orr crazy?”\n\n“He sure is,” Doc Daneeka said.\n\n“Can you ground him?”\n\n“I sure can. But first he has to ask me to. That’s part of the rule.”\n\n“Then why doesn’t he ask you to?”\n\n“Because he’s crazy,” Doc Daneeka said. “He has to be crazy to keep flying combat missions after all the close calls he’s had. Sure, I can ground Orr. But first he has to ask me to.”\n\n“That’s all he has to do to be grounded?”\n\n“That’s all. Let him ask me.”\n\n“And then you can ground him?” Yossarian asked.\n\n“No. Then I can’t ground him.”\n\n“You mean there’s a catch?”\n\n“Sure there’s a catch,” Doc Daneeka replied. “Catch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn’t really crazy.”\n\nThere was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one’s safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn’t, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn’t have to; but if he didn’t want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.\n\n“That’s some catch, that Catch-22,” he observed.\n\n“It’s the best there is,” Doc Daneeka agreed.\n\nThe phrase is now often misapplied to any problematic or unwelcome situation."
