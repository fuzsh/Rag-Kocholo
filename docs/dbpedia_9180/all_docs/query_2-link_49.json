        "text": "……\n\nOnline exclusive\n\nTwo different books have had a profound impact upon me in two different ways: one is a novel, the other non-fiction.\n\nThe novel is Catch-22, which I first read when was quite young, and which inspired me with the power of the written word. The juxtaposition of completely opposing ideas and incidents has had a residual impact upon all of my own writing, and lecturing. The power of bringing seemingly totally different ideas together, whether it be physics and Star Trek, or the X-Files and politics in science, to shock and intrigue governs a significant fraction of what I do. At the same time, Catch 22 built up in me a healthy disregard for arbitrary rules and regulations that has remained with me throughout my life."
