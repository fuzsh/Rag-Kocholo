        "text": "12 Books of Boyhood. #11\n\nDuring my teenage years I read dozens of WWII paperbacks, most notably Paul Brickhill’s (I didn’t know he was Australian) The Great Escape (1950), The Dam Busters (1951) and Reach for the Sky (1954); The Bridge on the River Kwai (1952), Pierre Boulle; Beyond the Chindwin (1945), Bernard Fergusson; Stand Easy; and many, many others. I still have 15 boxes of my father’s WWI and WWII books under the spare bed. I could have read Catch 22 (1961) in those years but I didn’t until I’d been at uni a year or so and it was associated in my mind, and I think in most minds, with the anti-war movement and the Vietnam War.\n\nWhether or not the release of the movie in 1970 made the book more popular, I had already read it when the movie reached the Carlton fleapit and thought that the book was far superior.\n\nThe first question with Catch 22 is how did yet another WWII book become such an icon of the anti-war movement of the 1960s and 70s? Probably only Kurt Vonnegut’s later Slaughterhouse Five (1969) approaches it.\n\nCatch 22 emphasises not so much the futility of war as the stupidity and venality of senior officers, and unlike those other books I read as a boy, makes clear there is absolutely no romance involved. And it was that, in the general disillusion occasioned by the Vietnam War, which made it so iconic for us in the movement.\n\nLike Vonnegut, Joseph Heller (1923-1999) served in the US Army; Heller as a bombadier in B-25s, flying 60 missions over Italy, which is also the situation of his hero, Yossarian.\n\nB-25s of the US Army Air Corps had a crew of four officers and two men – the bombadier and and navigator in the nose, the pilot and co-pilot above and behind them, and two gunners in the mid-section towards the rear. Over the target, and in anti aircraft flak, the bombadier seems to have been in charge, shouting directions to the pilot, and Yossarian was often in charge of a section of three or four planes.\n\nYossarian’s squadron was based on the little island of Pianosa, near Elba, a couple of hundred kms north west of Rome. I thought for a long time it was fictional, but remembered a reference to Elba, and thought to look it up.\n\nAlthough other summaries say otherwise, the action takes place over the six months or so of the autumn and winter of 1944, as Yossarian, who at the beginning of that period has flown 40 something missions, attempts to get out of flying any more, as he processes the death of Snowden, a gunner he barely knew, who died in his arms.\n\nThe B-25s they flew in were stable, dependable, dull-green ships with twin rudders and engines and wide wings. Their single fault, from where Yossarian sat as a bombadier, was the tight crawlway separatig the bombadier’s compartment in the plexiglass nose from the nearest escape hatch. The crawlway was a narrow, square cold tunnel hollowed out beneath the flight controls, and a large man like Yossarian could squeeze through only with difficulty …\n\nThere was room for an additional escape hatch right there in the nose of a B-25, but there was no escape hatch. Instead there was the crawlway, and since the mess in the mission over Avignon, he had learned to detest every mammoth inch of it ..\n\np.57\n\n“since the mess in the mission over Avignon” and so we approach, briefly, the mission during which Snowden died and which Yossarian circles back to, over and over, in ever increasing detail, until we understand how and why he is so traumatised.\n\nAround this central story there are many others, of greater or lesser importance, whose main purpose is to satirise the military. And a host of characters, whose purpose is mainly the same: their commander Colonel Cathcart, whose only thought is how he might be promoted; Milo Minderbender who volunteers to run the canteen, building it up into a mighty enterprise, buying and selling all across the Mediterranean in borrowed planes, until PwC-like, he is contracting bombing runs to both the Allies and the Germans; the chaplain, an anabaptist too simple, too moral for his role, who sees a naked man in a tree at Snowden’s funeral, not knowing that it is Yossarian, whose uniform is saturated with Snowden’s blood; Nately, Aarfy, Orr, Dunbar, Chief White Halfoat, his fellow officers, kids most of them, straight out of privileged homes and private colleges, with no idea about anything; the nurses in the camp hospital where Yossarian retreats at will for a break; Nately’s whore – whom Nately is determined to marry – and Nately’s whore’s kid sister, just 12, and determined not to miss out; Doc Daneeka who gets himself written onto manifests so he can be paid for flight time, is on the manifest of a plane which crashes, and so must be counted as dead; the dead man in Yossarian’s tent, who flew a mission as soon as he arrived, without signing into camp, and now dead, cannot be counted or even have his gear moved.\n\nAlmost as soon as I started listening this time round, I looked up Groucho Marx. Heller is Brooklyn Jewish, and so is Groucho. There are great similarities in the way they talk/write. A rush of words – which I have noted in other New York writers, Salinger, Christina Stead’s Lettie Fox, and back to Baldwin – and also a slanginess in the delivery.\n\nThis is a wonderful work, seamlessly sliding backwards and forwards in time, as Yossarian processes Snowden’s death, as all the officers of his cohort, die in ones and twos around him. Ending in farce as Nately’s whore makes multiple attempts to kill him, and in hope and despair – that desertion is possible and the only avenue for escape.\n\n‘Catch 22’ of course is the idea that you should be discharged if you are insane, that a discharge must be requested, but that only the sane will request a discharge. Though Heller uses the name more widely than that at different places through the book, little guessing, I suppose, how widely and quickly it would become accepted into common discourse.\n\n.\n\nJoseph Heller, Catch 22, first pub. 1961. 478pp. Audible version, 2011, read by Trevor White. 16 hrs.\n\nI’ve run out of time, and will review Book 12, Daniel Cohn-Bendit’s Obsolete Communism: The Leftwing Alternative, about the Paris uprising of 1968, sometime during 2024.\n\nLinks to all the reviews arising from my annual ‘projects’ may be found in the Projects menu above."
