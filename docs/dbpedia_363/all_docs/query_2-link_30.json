        "text": "DJ MUGGS was born in Queens, NY before moving to Los Angeles at age fourteen, launching the group 7a3 before linking up with B-Real and Sen Dog to create the legendary group CYPRESS HILL. MUGGS has long been the face of an entire movement of hip hop, captivating the world as the producer of the iconic group CYPRESS HILL, producing seven studio albums for the group from 1991 to 2004. MUGGS has also scored hits with Ice Cube (“Check Yo Self”) and House of Pain (“Jump Around”) along with producing cuts for Dr. Dre, Mobb Deep, RZA, GZA, KRS One, Goodie Mob and Wyclef Jean amongst others. Looking back on the stats of his storied career, MUGGS has sold 17 million records with CYPRESS HILL and is a four-time Grammy nominee. Clearly a step ahead of the rest, now DJ MUGGS has returned with plans to release another futuristic record.\n\nAlso working hard on his own projects, MUGGS launched Soul Assassins, a collective of musicians and graphic artists. MUGGS then produced the ‘Soul Assassins I’ album, which climbed inside the Billboard Top 100 and featured rappers such as Dr. Dre, B-Real, Mobb Deep, Wu Tang Clan, KRS One and others. The success of this led to a second Soul Assassins album featuring Xzibit, GZA, Kurupt, Dilated Peoples, Everlast and others. DJ MUGGS also continued to push boundaries by putting out ‘Dust’, an atmospheric trip-hop experience featuring vocals from Greg Dulli (Afghan Whigs, Twilight Singers), Everlast and Amy Trujillo.\n\nMUGGS also collaborated with Wu Tang Clan’s GZA for a project dubbed ‘Grandmasters’ along with several other projects that he used to push his own musical boundaries and combine elements from multiple genres into a sound of his own. Now DJ MUGGS is set to change the game again by taking the dubstep sound to the next level. MUGGS is currently hard at work on his new project ‘Bass For Your Face’ which melds hip hop with electronic music such as dub and glitch. The album is set to be released later this year and will feature a list of heavyweight guests. MUGGS had the following to say: “’Bass for Your Face’ is a hip hop hybrid album with elements of glitch, dubstep, electronic and rock. It’s where I am at the moment in my never ending quest to push the envelope of sounds and styles.”\n\nStaying busy as always, Dj Muggs has nothing left to prove, and is now about to showcase his dj skills again by touring around the world and playing his eclectic, one-of-a-kind dj sets with a heavy rock & mash-up background. Muggs could play a dj set of only music he has produced and it would be over 2 hours of recognizable hit record after hit record! When Dj Muggs rolls into your town to spin, it is an event you do not want to miss by any means. Look out for the legendary producer & DJ, Destroying turntables in a club or concert near you in 2012 and beyond….\n\nMuggs Plans on releasing a New Album called “Bass For Your Face” which he describes as a West Coast “Dubstep” Album. Although he says the album will feature an extensive Guest List, thus far the only Guest named is London Grime MC P-Money\n\n."
