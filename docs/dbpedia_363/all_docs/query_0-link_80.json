        "text": "The cryptic, and intriguing presence of Mach-Hommy within the hip-hop scene has become one of my most recent obsessions. There is something about his dark, gritty delivery and intricate wordplay that I’m most captivated by. The New Jersey rapper teams up with DJ Muggs, the legendary Cypress Hill producer for a dark and unassuming new album titled Tuez-Les Tous. Just from the title, which is French for “kill them all,” you can tell that this album is dark and hellish in soundscape and tone.\n\nThe production on this record is heavy, with tracks like “900K” and “Piotr” feeling like some hellish, truly horror-core music. Dominant basslines, quite a lot of synths and sound effects that gives me a lot of unnerving, unsettling energy, which is just what I’d want for a collaborative album between these two musicians. With Mach-Hommy’s slow and detailed lyricism, it is clear that this record requires a lot of attention, as he rhymes throughout this record with a menacing energy that really gives me chills throughout. There are quite a few features on this record, with Kungg Fuu, Meyhem Lauren, Tha God Fahim, Big Cheeko, and Your Old Droog appearing on this album, providing us with different moods and characters, who just add more character and personality to this dark album. It needs to sink in further, but this album is definitely one I will be replaying for a long time.\n\nListen to DJ Muggs and Mach-Hommy’s collab album Tuez-Les Tous below via Spotify, and don’t forget to support!"
