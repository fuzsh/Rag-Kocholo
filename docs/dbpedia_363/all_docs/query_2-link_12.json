        "meta_description": "Notes &amp; Tones - Album and Wine by DJ Muggs, released 10 March 2023\n\n1. Intro\n2. What Planet\n3. Liquid Diamonds\n4. Notes &amp; Tones, Skulls &amp; Bones\n5. It&#39;s Spring Again\n6. Third Planet\n7. Space Is The Place\n8. There Are Other Worlds\n9. Who&#39;s Your God?\n10. His Story\n11. Quiet Ecstasy\n12. Nebula\n13. Rocket To Venus\n14. Time Is An Illusion\n\nInspiration: Art Taylor / Stanko Radikon / Xavier Caillard\r\n\r\nFollowing the launch of their Holy Ghost wine and record pairing, DJ Muggs and Egon have teamed up with California’s Broc Cellars and its winemaker Chris Brockway for Notes &amp; Tones: Deep natural wine meets deep jazz and rap samples on vinyl.\r\n\r\nNatural wine can be the same, obscure type of thing as a natural hot dog. Natural in what way? As in it, in some way, originally came from nature? In this case, we mean an unadulterated wine made without chemical pesticides or fertilizers used in grape cultivation; a wine made without unnecessary intervention by the vintner without fining and filtering; and with little or no sulfites added to extend the wine’s shelf life.\r\n\r\nIn this case, this wine is a “living” – sensitive, evolving – thing. If you follow the biodynamic calendar, you might find it tastes different if you drink it on a “root” day or a “fruit” day. And you will probably find that it is not sanitized like the commercially produced, neutered and shelf-stabilized wine that is what 90% of wine consumers tend to drink. In other words, Notes &amp; Tones is probably unlike most wines you have ever had.\r\n\r\nThis is a good thing. This is purposeful. Chris Brockway of Broc Cellars worked with Muggs and Egon to conceive, ferment, taste, blend and then bottle this homage to the skin-contact wines of yore brought into the modern day – those by the likes of Stanko Radikon in Italy and Xavier Caillard in France.\r\n\r\nThe only name that fit it was that of the landmark book by the great jazz drummer Art Taylor. Muggs complimented the wine with music that he and Egon sourced and cleared from the landmark catalog of the cosmic jazz musician Sun Ra. A Soul Assassins x Now-Again x Broc Cellars collaboration.",
