        "text": "I'm the lowest rating on here. I have been listening to much of Roc Marciano's discography past few days. I've enjoyed him on features recently, and was wondering if perhaps my opinion on his solo work would change as I did not care for Marcberg and Reloaded when I heard them 11 and 9 years ago. My opinion after re-listening to his discography is similar to what I initially thought. His delivery is boring, his production is simple with a loop of a sample and that's it, and he has the same ... read more\n\nI had high hopes when Muggs was producing for Roc Marci, but i have to tell you I was bit let down. Wouldn't be one his best but I am yet to hear a bad project from him. Muggs amazing as always, its just his beats doesnt work with Marci as i expected. Still a great project.\n\nRoc is 2018’s MVP. The man made 3 records that sound completely different and are all amazing in their own way. Muggs brings his A game here with a masterful array of beats and this is one of his best produced albums. Such a dirty, beautiful sound these two create on this project that ages so well. Best tracks are Dolph Lundgren, aunt Bonnie, the e train, wild oats, caught a lick, white dirt, shit I’m on, and wormhole. The second half of Wormhole is divine. KAOS is an underrated gem.\n\nRoc Marciano Discography Dive #7: KAOS\n\nCollab tape between legend DJ Muggs and Roc Marciano is actually pretty solid with great production and great bars to flow with the vibe. It's okay it's not my favorite work done by Marci but it's interesting\n\nMuggs tones down his beats a bit but it's still definitely the most exciting production Roc has rapped over. The problem is he doesn't seem to know how to rap over good beats\n\nThe truth about ‘KAOS’ is that the first fifteen, maybe twenty minutes are to be sat through; but as soon as the drum fill kicks off the quivering strings, bluesy piano and caterwauling electric guitar of ‘Rolls Royce Rugs’, the initial enticement of a Roc Marciano/DJ Muggs collaboration seems no great deception. DJ Muggs’ delivery is characteristically systematic: he’s an eminent engineer who brings process and clarity to hip-hop production, but the clutch ... read more"
