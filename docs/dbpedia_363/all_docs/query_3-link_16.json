        "text": "DJ Muggs is an undisputed legend. Over the course of his distinguished and diverse career, he has conquered music in not only multiple genres but multiple languages. As the creator and producer of Cypress Hill, the multiple-time Grammy Award nominee has overseen the production of four platinum and three gold albums, traveled the world many times over, with Cypress Hill as headliner, a major festival regular, and performed in front of millions of fans. Longtime Cypress Hill documentarian Estevan Oriol masterfully captured Cypress’ musical/cultural influence and legacy with his 2022 Showtime Film Insane In The Brain.\n\nWhile Cypress Hill is a full-time + undertaking, Muggs also remains extremely active as a solo artist. Not only has he produced hits for Cypress Hill, but he’s also responsible for indelible classics like House Of Pain’s “Jump Around” and Ice Cube’s “Check Yourself,” was tapped to remix for U2, Janet Jackson and Depeche Mode and produced gems with MF Doom, Westside Gunn, GZA, Action Bronson, Conway The Machine and many, many more.\n\nIn the last few years, Muggs has been more active than ever. Releasing collaborative projects with Mach-Hommy, Roc Marciano, Yelawolf, Rome Streetz, Jay Worthy, and most recently Champagne For Breakfast with Meyhem Lauren and Madlib.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet, his Soul Assassins albums have always held a special place in the hearts of fans. Muggs Presents: The Soul Assassins Chapter 1 (1997) was his first solo studio album and featured collaborations with Dr. Dre, B-Real, RZA, GZA, Mobb Deep, Goodie Mob, KRS-One, MC Eiht & Wyclef Jean. He returned to form with Soul Assassins II (2000), featuring collaborations with Xzibit, Cypress Hill, GZA, Goodie Mob, Kool G Rap, Dilated Peoples, Kurupt, Ras Kass and Everlast. The third installment in the Soul Assassins series, Intermission, was released in 2009 and proved to be aptly-titled; until now.\n\nDJ Muggs has released the first new Soul Assassins album in 14 years with Soul Assassins 3, Death Valley, which is now available.\n\nDJ Muggs Soul Assassins 3: Death Valley features guest appearances from Freddie Gibbs, Ghostface Killah, Westside Gunn, Ice Cube, Method Man, Boldy James, MC Ren, CeeLo Green, B-Real, Scarface, Roc Marciano, Devin The Dude, Evidence, Meyhem Lauren, Jay Worthy, Rome Streetz and Slick Rick among others.\n\n“You know you cannot escape death, but immortality can be attained” states DJ Muggs.\n\nYou can now purchase, stream, add, and favorite Soul Assassins 3: Death Valley at your preferred DSP: https://sym.ffm.to/deathvalley\n\nSoul Assassins 3: Death Valley TRACKLISTING:\n\nThe Time Has Come\n\nIt’s On FEAT Boldy James\n\nCheck In FEAT Jay Worthy & Spanto\n\nSicilian Gold FEAT Ghostface Killah & Westside Gunn\n\n67 Keys FEAT Roc Marciano, Meyhem Lauren & Rome Streetz\n\nMister Cartoon Interlude\n\nJokers Wild FEAT CeeLo Green\n\nShell Casings FEAT T.F.\n\nStreet Made FEAT Freddie Gibbs & Scarface\n\nWhere We At FEAT Boldy James\n\nWe Ain’t Playin’ FEAT Devin The Dude, Jay Worthy, T.F. & 2 Eleven\n\nBurn The Playbook FEAT Evidence & Domo Genesis\n\nMajik\n\nCrazy Horse FEAT Roc Marciano & Crimeapple\n\nMetropolis FEAT Method Man & Slick Rick\n\nWe Coming For The Safe FEAT Boldy James\n\nSkeleton Bones FEAT Rome Streetz\n\nDump On Em’ FEAT Ice Cube, B-Real & MC Ren\n\nDJ Muggs Outro FEAT Estevan Oriol & Spanto"
