        "text": "Ever wondered what Danny Brown's onstage oral affair would look like in an animated world? DJ Muggs has you covered with the aptly-titled music video, \"Headfirst.\"\n\nIllustrated by Monsta, the video finds Muggs and Brown getting into mischief at a show. With the chaotic production pulsating throughout (yep, that surely is Muggs flirting with dubstep), it's three and half minutes of thrilling visuals that will be ingrained in your brain by song's end.\n\n\"Headfirst\" can be found on DJ Muggs' latest album, Bass For Your Face.\n\n[Via Mass Appeal]"
