        "text": "Here's part 2 of our interview with DJ Muggs.\n\nIGNM: I recently read this interview with you where you commented on the lack of albums being made today, meaning a record that is all killer and no filler. What I find most interesting about that is the fact that hip-hop, rap has not been album oriented since about 1991.\n\nM: Right.\n\nIGNM: I mean there was that great period where you [Cypress] and PE, BDP, Tribe, Brand Nubian--everybody, they were making albums, not CDs filled with 22 tracks of which two were a hit single and the rest was mediocre filler...\n\nM: And nobody really got on the radio anyway, so it didn't matter.\n\nIGNM: Now, I couldn't even name a rap album in the past several years that is an album from start to finish...\n\nM: Naw, no, besides Dre's couple of records that he's put out. But you know, that's why a lot of the records aren't sellin' no more. They keep saying that it's downloads and sh@#. That's true to a point--a little point--but then it's just that good music isn't coming out no more. That's why records aren't sellin', that's why the music business is down 30-percent. But then you've got somebody like 50 Cent, who's been--to me--the best rapper who's come out in a minute, who I can actually listen to 10 songs in a row for the first time in a long f@#ckin' time on an album, and he comes out and does 870 [thousand records sold] the first week, then doesn't even drop to 830 the next week because the album's solid. - Zen Sekizawa And with all the Internet and whatever, he's still selling records because his album's solid. Dre will sell records because his album's solid. Em sold records because his album was solid, regardless. If you give people solid music, they'll go out and buy it. But they ain't gettin' it, they're gettin' like two songs on an album. So if you put it [the album] on the Internet and people download it, they hear two songs that they like they're sayin' 'I'm not buyin' the f@#ckin' record 'cause there's only two good songs.' But then if they download it and everything's bangin' they're like 'Well I gotta go f@#ckin' buy this sh@#!', you know what I mean? Plus now they're puttin' DVDs on the CDs now, so now they're givin' you more. Music's just not enough for these kids so they've added the DVD sh@# so you gotta go buy the CD.\n\nIGNM: But there's more to an album than just good music.\n\nM: Oh yeah, there is.\n\nIGNM: You have to have the flow, the whole transition. How did you keep the flow on Dust? Did you have a blueprint in terms of like 'I want it to start like this and touch upon this and end like this'?\n\nM: Naw. I had a blueprint in my head that I wanted to make an album that's...to me this is one whole song, this album. It's a soundtrack to a movie where each song is a different scene to the movie, but it's one whole piece of work. After I had finished the album I had about 25, 26 songs and I just started cuttin' songs off that didn't fit the album and puttin' it together. It took me a month just to put the album together, the sequence, and put all the things [in there that help] how the record flows and all the little interludes and little pieces together. That was definitely inspired by Dark Side of the Moon and things like that. The way those records were put together, they were seamless, you know? That was my whole inspiration. You know, I've always been inspired by classic rock, when it comes to me makin' albums. Just the way the music was put together and the care that was taken when they made albums and they just made great songs, regardless if the songs fit radio format at that particular time. It didn't matter.\n\nAnd that was my whole approach, 'Lemme just make a great f@#ckin' album from start to finish of songs that I like and make it seamless, make it flow, make it all one piece of work. Make it--even if there's different singers--it still sounds like a group and that a band put it together, one band, one group of people, not like a compilation album.'\n\nIGNM: Well that's apparent with the bookend tracks, \"I Know\" and \"Far Away\". They almost have a similar vibe so it's like you get drawn in and then you go on this ride and you kind of come sort of where you began.\n\nM: Right, right. It's full circle. That's right where I was at.\n\nIGNM: You've mentioned Dark Side of the Moon as an influence. Would you say that's the quintessential Floyd record?\n\nM: The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon are my favorites. And those were albums. They didn't care about singles at all. And I think that's how records should be made, man. The way it is now nobody thinks about that. I've just been blessed enough to be able to have the time and the finances to sit back and actually be able to make this record and not having to worry about it--'Is this record gonna sell? 'Cause I gotta feed my children.' I could just say 'Lemme make a f@#ckin' art record like this.' And that's [what I miss]. A lot of bands used to make music for the sake of the art. I got back to that on this record.\n\nIGNM: How are you gonna apply that approach to Cypress?\n\nM: Well I've always taken that approach with Cypress. But at the same time I've got the label sayin' 'Look, we need to get a song, we need to get a single out there, we need a single, give us something, give us something...' And I've been blessed with Cypress to be able to do the singles on my terms and they've still been commercially successful, but still on my terms. I still haven't had to put R&B beats or an R&B singer [on any of my singles], you know? I've been able to do it on my own terms. We'll see what we're gonna do on the new album. I haven't really started approachin' it yet. But when I get the guys in the lab we'll see where they're at in their heads.\n\n- Zen Sekizawa IGNM: Do you think that you going out and doing this album and working on Soul Assassins 3 and Sen working on SX10 and B. Real bein' up to whatever it is that he's up to, is that healthy for Cypress? I would think that it is in that it allows all of you to vent your other interests.\n\nM: You are 100-percent correct. That's the only thing that keeps me makin' Cypress records is bein' able to go out and do these other things. Otherwise I'd be burnt out and bored with it. And I've reach those times, though. I have constantly reached those times ever since the third album. That's why after the third album I started doing other side projects, if you noticed, because there were other things that I was feeling creatively that I had to get out that wouldn't work for Cypress. So I never tried to force them on Cypress and let it grow into its own entity. Like when we did the rock stuff, I tried keepin' a lid on Cypress. I wanted it to be hip-hop, because I'm a purist at heart. But it was growin' and I had let it grow, I had to let this band grow into what it was goin' to grow into naturally and what it wanted to become. And it was something that I created and couldn't keep the lid on anymore. So once I let it grow and flourish, BOOM! \"Rock Superstar\" comes out. You know what I mean? That gave the band a whole new life again and made us just as relevant in 2000 as it as in 1990. So I had to take the lid off of it and just let nature take its course.\n\nIGNM: I'm going to assume that you would apply the taking the lid off theory to your solo work as well as your everyday life, right?\n\nM: Yeah, just let it go and let it develop into what it's going to develop into. You've got to."
