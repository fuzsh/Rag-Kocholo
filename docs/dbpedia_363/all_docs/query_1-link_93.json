        "text": "DJ Muggs doesn’t really need a lengthy introduction, with 25+ years in the game he’s been there and done it all. Muggs is most commonly known as the main producer for the groundbreaking LA hip-hop group Cypress Hill. He has also worked with everyone from Dr. Dre & Ice Cube to Pearl Jam & Sonic Youth. He’s put out many successful & highly regarded solo and collaborative projects. Over the years he’s set up a number of established businesses and radio shows . In short, he’s a legend.\n\nI caught up with Muggs the day before the Gumball 3000 Rally in London…\n\nTaking it back, maybe 20+ years, how did you get started on the production tip and with Cyrpess Hill?\n\nI started as a DJ, I was in a group called 7A3. I didn’t produce shit, but I had all the records and ideas for the album. Somebody else produced my ideas and I didn’t like the way it ended up sounding. So when I got a little money I bought a drum machine and said “I’m gonna do this shit my way from now on”.\n\nCypress Hill – Insane In The Brain (1993)\n\nWhat big differences and significant changes have you seen the game go through in that time?\n\nEverything, the world has changed as a whole! Things change everyday up here, man. Just like people change. It ain’t the smartest person who wins, It’s the person who’s able to adapt the quickest, ya know, shit moves so quick. If you can’t adapt…those who cease who change, cease to be. It’s all about adaptability, man. To me, I stay true to being an artist and the music…I can never say what’s going to inspire me at what time. I don’t particularly go out of my way for commercial success or to please anybody. I do my shit, if they don’t like it, then you can eat a dick…\n\nWho have your favourite artists been to work with?\n\nRZA, Dr. Dre, Prodigy and the Infamous family, KRS-One, Xzibit, Ill Bill, Sick Jacken.\n\nXzibit – The Foundation (1996)\n\nDr. Dre & B Real – Puppet Masters (1997)\n\nAnyone that you haven’t managed to work with, but would like to?\n\nThere’s nobody. I’m not about wanting to work with people. If we’re going to work together, we gotta be able to vibe on an everyday level. I’m not on that “put something together” shit, I don’t send too many beats out.\n\nYou played a large part in Alchemist’ come up, how’s it for you know watching him out there these days?\n\nHe’s amazing, he’s inspired me to do greater things! That’s what it’s all about, helping each other and inspiring each other. We’re on a winning team together! Alchemist, Evidence and myself actually share a spot in LA where we have three separate studios set up, each one where we write and record our different shit, we can bounce ideas off each other whilst there. Like, I might be making an electronic track in my studio, pass through Alc’s or Ev’s studio and then completely change it into a grimy hip-hop track!\n\nThe Vs Series seems to be where we can hear alot of your hip-hop production these days, who’s up next?\n\nIt will be me and Ill Bill & Vinnie Paz for sure. But then I’m like “who’s the next person?”…I want to do Rock Marcy, he’s one of my favourites. Like, people hit me up everyday. I might to another one with Sick Jacken…or maybe one with all the guys that I’ve worked with, do one if all five of those guys. If they just all gave me two songs. We could work that real quick man. I could do that within a month.\n\nDJ Muggs & Ill Bill – Cult Assassins (2010)\n\nI’ve also noticed that you’re starting to get involved with the Dubstep scene, which is taking off majorly over here, can you explain a bit about that?\n\nThe electronic scene globally is amazing. The dubstep scene is ridiculous. Kids are out there banging their motherfucking heads, going crazy!\n\nHow about studio time with any UK artists out here?\n\nI was working with Itchy Robot, a dubstep dude, a did a track with him. I sent out a couple of beats for P Money, the guy who did the Slang Like This track with True Tiger, that track is huge! I like P Money alot, he’s dope. I like Sukh Knight, I like his beats, they’re banging! Also, I’m meant to hook up with some drum n bass dudes.\n\nWhat can you tell us about the London underground scene compared to the LA underground scene\n\nSee the underground scene here in London is hard n gangsta style…in LA right now, it’s more fucking faggots…little girls…glow sticks all that shit. Even back when drum n bass was real big out here, I’d go to where Goldie played…everyone was off their faces, smoking up in there, wilding out!!! You know what I love about dubstep though, the fucking fans!! They come out and just loose it!! It’s fucking great! But it’s not aggressive, nobody is trying to fight.\n\nThe West Coast is starting to make some mainstream noise, do you think it’s time again?\n\nI mean, outside of Cali, and especially over here in UK, you’re only going to see the mainstream shit. But I think LA, the underground LA, has one of the most progressive music scenes going on right now. It’s ridiculous…kids are becoming sick of the pop shit. Artists on the come up now ain’t even trying to be on the radio or MTV. It’s probably the most avant grande it’s ever been! You can look at everybody from whats going on at Low End Theory (Club night in Los Angeles) and the guys at Alpha Pup Records, what they’re all doing is ridiculous, dope shit!\n\nMuggs ft. Greg Dulli of Afghan Whigs – Fat City (2003)\n\nNot necessarily a huge man myself, but what’s your thought about upcoming Cali cats like Odd Future\n\nFor me it’s going to be interesting to see where it goes, they’re at the stage, where everything is cool…like Cypress was right there 20 years ago. But when you get the fame, everyone is going to be telling you you’re better than everyone else. Everyone will start getting separate managers, accountants, lawyers…start getting new girlfriends, and separate friends…let’s see how they handle that.\n\nI know that Yelawolf, did a take on Ain’t Goin’ Out Like That, what you think of him?\n\nYela’s a real dude. He’s doing something original, a super nice guy. I know he’s worked with Reakwon and hear that he’s supporting Wu-Tang in couple weeks here.\n\nRock The Bells was announced earlier, I see you’re performing the entire of Black Sunday, you looking forward to that?\n\nYeah, we’re doing that. But I’ll be back in the UK for the V Festival on the 21st August! When you do festivals playing the electronic music, the DJ’s rate goes way up man, it’s eye opening! Certain artists are making $200,000 a fucking festival DJ’ing for an hour n half. Dudes need one hit song n you’ll make 50, 60G’s on a night at one of these festivals, come every summer, imagine that shit!\n\nNo wonder DJ AM and them cats started doing that…\n\nYeah rest in peace to AM, but the difference is, I’m still doing hip-hop records every year. I can’t leave hip-hop alone!\n\nWhat else is planned for you this year?\n\nMy plan is to put this album out called Bass For Your Face, it’s an electronic record. And then work on my next hip-hop album with Ramel Zee. We gotta wait on who we’ll feature on that one though.\n\nMuggs prepping Bass For Your Face\n\nI know you fuck with a lot of rock music and had your Mash Up series…if you could assemble a dream line up, who would it be?\n\nJohn Bonham (Led Zepplin) on drums. Jimi Hendrix on guitar. Jack Black and….John Lennon.\n\nAny last words?\n\nMan, I just want to say thank you to everyone who’s lent an ear to listen to my music throughout the years. Everyone who paid a couple of £ to come check out any shows. Thank you to you for taking time out of your day to come interview and hang out, we appreciate it. I’m lucky to be able to make music and travel the world, and motherfucking…live my dream!\n\n@DJ_Muggs\n\nYouTube Channel\n\nSoul Assassins\n\ndjmuggs.com\n\nHouse of Pain – Jump Around (1992)\n\nCypress Hill – Dr. Greenthumb (1998)\n\nCypress Hill – Rap Superstar (2000)\n\nDJ Muggs live at the Elementz 2009 tour in Belgium"
