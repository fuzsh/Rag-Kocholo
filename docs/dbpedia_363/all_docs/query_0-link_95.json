        "text": "This is a very good album, and for now it will be there last. Everyone wants to do separate projects without worrying about the integrity of the group, and in truth they have been doing this for some time. DJ Muggs has released a number of albums over the years that have done well, Sen-Dog dabbles in metal and hardcore, and B-Real is working on a solo album.\n\nThe last few albums by Cypress Hill were not to my liking, I think they tried to cover a lot of ground, more than they needed. This is a nice mixture though, and they ended things very well.\n\nIMHO, nothing will ever beat their first album. Inbetween the first and the last was an incredible string of singles and key album tracks.\n\nIf you liked that album, you really should check out Cypress Hill's S/T debut album from 1991. At the time there wasn't another rap album that sounded like it. Great production from DJ Muggs, B-Real and Sen Dog's vocals compliment each other very well. There's not a bad track it either, from the singles \"How I Could Just Kill A Man\", \"The Phuncky Feel One\", \"Hand On The Pump\", to album tracks like \"Pigs\", \"Stoned Is The Way Of The Walk\", and \"Hole In The Head\" it's content is hard and uncompromisingly street, but at the same time was accessible which was one of the reasons for it's breakout success. Definitely a classic album IMHO.\n\nI'll second that! I finally replaced my CD that was stolen almost 10 years ago and it still sounds fresh and new. That album was played at every high school party my senior year and though college. Strong beats, great samples (Duke-Duke-Duke- Duke of) and clever lyrics. I wasn't a big fan of their second album, but their debut is definitely a hip-hop classic. You can even get it cheap from yourmusic.com.\n\nCypress' first album was recorded in analog according to both what DJ Muggs told me. He did all of the pre-production on that record in his home studio. I actually met him when the group was in SF on a promotional tour for that first album in the fall of '91. In fact during that visit to our college radio station he played us a rough mix of a new track he had just produced for an act that didn't even have a record deal at the time. It was \"Jump Around\" by House of Pain!!! Of course we all went crazy when we heard it and sure enough, less than six months later it's on mainstream radio on it's way to becoming a huge hit.\n\nA question about that Simply Vinyl pressing of Cypress Hill. Is that on double vinyl? It seems very pricey at almost 22 pounds sterling($45 in US dollars I believe). The original LP on Ruffhouse/Columbia was a single platter, but didn't sound that great because of the long running time of the two sides. I recommend tracking down the 12\" singles, which shouldn't be too hard to find. However beware of bootlegs of these that have flooded the market. They're easy to spot since the cover artwork isn't very sharp and the records themselves have computer scans of the labels and the colors are never correct either.\n\nThe CD for Cypress Hill's first album is ADD, recorded on analog tape, mixed and mastered to digital.\n\nI haven't seen the European release of \"Till Death Do Us Part\". \"Stoned Raiders\" is OK, have you heard \"Skull & Bones\"? That was really the last album of theirs I really liked. Love the two different versions of \"(Rap)Superstar\" and \"(Rock)Superstar\".\n\nMuggs' work on the first House Of Pain album is great, and you can hear it too, with the beats he selected. Huge difference from the second House Of Pain album.\n\nI reviewed the new 2CD compilation by The Roots in my column yesterday, and in the liner notes ?uestlove said that when he was in the studio doing Do You Want More?!!!??!, he saw all of the masters for the first Cypress Hill album in one of the rooms. At the same time, the first Kris Kross album was being recorded and mixed. ?uest said he eventually put the two things together, and realized that a lot of beats from Kris Kross' first album were nicely borrowed from the first Cypress Hill, most likely without Muggs' knowledge.\n\nI agree Muggs' production work was real tight during that period. You could really tell he didn't work on the second House of Pain album, judging by the beats(and the way it sold).\n\nKris Kross and Cypress Hill were both labelmates on Ruffhouse/Columbia and both of those albums were engineered by Joe \"The Butcher\" Nicolo who also ran Studio 4 in Philadelphia where parts of both albums were tracked and mixed, and was the co-owner of Ruffhouse Records. So it wouldn't surprise me if some of Cypress' beats showed up on another album from the same label.\n\nAnd thus the Roots connection (Philadelphia).\n\nI'd like to see the first Cypress Hill album remastered. I have the promo LP of that, where some of the songs are clean (was the stock copy like that too?)."
