        "text": "I really enjoyed this novel quite a bit. I read it a few years ago and it's the only Star Wars book I've read. I'm making it a part of my personal head canon.\n\nKathy Tyres captured the personalities of the characters really well. And there are numerous cool things going on there.\n\nI think this should be made into a film.\n\nSpoilerish things below....\n\nIt starts off right after The Battle of Endor. Literally like the next day.\n\nLuke gets a girlfriend.\n\nLuke, Leia and crew form an alliance with remaining Empire loyalists to fight a new threat.\n\nLuke is shown using The Force on a cellular level. I think this may be where the idea for the whole midi-chlorian thing came from. Not sure though.\n\nAnd Wedge Antilles is in there.\n\nTruce truly is a gem! thx for this topic\n\nI think what is underrated and forgotten lately is how much Truce did for the early post ROTJ EU. Before we had Warlords of the Week, Superweapons of the hour and Revived Sith of the Minute, Truce truly continued the message of ROTJ without reigniting a new war between an Empire, Dark Jedi or Sith and the Heroes.\n\nIt picked up Marvel comics notion of \"what could be next after ROTJ\" and came to the same conclusion: A nemesis that would be faced by both, Rebels and Imperials alike to unite them. Be that the Nagai/Tof for Marvel that hardly united both, or here the Ssi Ruuvi that had them form a truce and work together actually! Or the same concept blown up for the NJO and Vong \"once more with feeling\".\n\nBut aside this, it also precedented a few concepts that later EU works picked up and expanded, but without anybody realizing that Truce did it first! The cellular level Forceuse of Luke we see also in Crystal Star with the Solokids using it to escape their cell on the Worldcraft. The entechment technology we see by any other name return in Palpatine's Eye and Callista's Tron-adventure or the Stormtrooper brainwashing via tech-imprinting.\n\nPoor Dev Sibwarra was a great character and one of many potential students of Luke that died way too soon.\n\nThe fact that the Emperor had a deal with the Ssi Ruuvi allowing them to plunder in exchange for their technology, as well as Lumiya's abusing the Nagai and Tof invasion should have had wider consequences and been used by NR marketing to discredit the Imperial Leftovers further driving many especially Rim worlds into their fold.\n\nAs for later...\n\nI never understood how the NR could evolve from a Rim supported Rebel Alliance to a Coreworld New Republic loosing the Rim again to the Imperial Leftovers digging in there. Guess when the nobles financing the Alliance pushed them to take back the Core, they were spread too thin and left the Rim behind to take the Core, loosing support and trust there as they left them behind to follow the money sadly.\n\nThis was a very VERY early book, before some of the world building concepts for the universe had been worked out by successive material.\n\nAs such, it is a very \"free\" feeling book. Anything could happen, and some weird stuff does.\n\nStory aside, shout out for one of the best covers of the Bantam era. Not too busy, great use of sourced publicity photos to make the heroes look spot on, rather then artistically \"close\".\n\nThis book clearly was blazing a trail in the post-OT era, and with probably little clear detail from Zahn on his books, Kathy Tyers picks up at the hangover from the ROTJ celebrations and shows you the next day...the adventure is immediate. No rest for our heroes, even after knocking out a superweapon and 2 Sith Lords.\n\nAlways something happening in a galaxy far far away...and she nailed that.\n\nIn the final analysis, the book is fun, but quite isolated from much of the rest of the Bantam era and the subsequent Legends canon. The Imperial bend, the Ssi-ruuk, entechment, all were pieces set up for someone else to spike...but other writers went other ways.\n\nEven Kathy seems to understand that, as Balance Point didn't go much into tooting the horn of Truce.\n\nStill, a fun read...and definitively the follow up to ROTJ...it is where you go to continue the story after Endor.\n\nI think they do that generally though. Release hardcover first and paperback so many months later. They know many fans will pay for the HC's. But I looked it up, it was an NYT best seller. That's probably not a hard thing to do for a SW novel though."
