        "text": "Interview: Kathy Tyers Talks ‘Balance Point’, ‘The Truce At Bakura’, & ‘Star Wars Legends’\n\nDecember 8, 2014 at 12:01 am | Posted in Books, eBooks, George Lucas, Interview, Lucasfilm, Sci-Fi, Star Wars, Star Wars Books, Star Wars Rebels, Television | 5 Comments\n\nTags: balance point, firebird, kathy tyers, tales from the bounty hunters, tales from the mos eisley cantina, the truce at bakura\n\nToday we have a very special interview conducted by Doug McCausland. A couple weeks ago Doug did an outstanding interview with author Kevin J. Anderson covering the 20th anniversary of the Jedi Academy Trilogy.

She would later go on to contribute several short stories to Kevin J. Anderson’s Tales From The… series, including “Prize Pelt: The Tale of Bossk” and “We Don’t Do Weddings: The Band’s Tale”, as well as the New Jedi Order installment Balance Point.

The Thrawn Trilogy kicked off a long series of books for Bantam publishing. Setting aside the young reader series The Jedi Prince, we have the first few novels of the early Bantam period. The year 1994 ushered in six Star Wars books, three new authors, and two new cover artists: Drew Struzan and John Alvin. John knocked out all three covers for the Jedi Academy Trilogy, which I’ll tackle in my next installment. For now, let’s take a look at Struzan’s work.
