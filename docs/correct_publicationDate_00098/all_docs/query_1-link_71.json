        "text": "The Rebels have won the Battle of Endor. The Second Death Star is destroyed, and the Emperor is dead. No sooner has the victory celebration concluded, however, the Alliance receives a distress signal from the remote planet Bakura, which is being attacked by the Ssi-Ruuk alien race. While the distress signal was intended for the Empire, the Rebels decide to go to their aid in the hopes of winning over another planet to their cause. Leia is dispatched as ambassador, while Luke is put in command of the battle group.\n\nThe Bakuran senate is initially hostile to the Rebels, as they are still under the sway of the Imperial Governor Nereus, but nevertheless the fact the Rebels were able to drive off the alien invasion to the far reaches of the star system gives them some standing. The Ssi-Ruuk are aided by a human Force sensitive teenager named Dev Sibwarra, who became aware of Luke’s presence during the battle and passes on this information to his masters. The aliens are using humans to “entech” all manner of droids, including battle droids, and they believe with Luke in their power, they could reach far more human populations than they could with Dev. He comes to realise this, and so attempts to warn Luke.\n\nThe Imperials also learn of the Ssi-Ruuk desire to possess Luke, and so allow a small strike force of the aliens to capture him on-planet, although Governor Nereus has already infected Luke with an exotic parasite, the idea being that Luke would incubate said parasite, be taken captive by the Ssi-Ruuk, and then infect them in turn, wiping out the alien menace. Of course, the plan doesn’t entirely go that way, Dev essentially munities and between him and Luke working together, they are able to overcome the threat and bring at least some of the Imperials into the fold. Dev, however, doesn’t quite make it through alive, denying Luke his possible first apprentice.\n\nWell. This one is quite the wild ride, isn’t it? This book came out in 1994, and I first read it in something like 1999 or 2000, not long after I got hooked on Star Wars books with Zahn’s offerings. In some respects, this is a great example of what was a bit wrong with the Bantam era books. We have a mysterious alien race being a threat to the galaxy, with weird alien tech that doesn’t quite feel like Star Wars; we have Luke and his failed/doomed love interests, and we have Leia doing her “let’s sign a peace treaty!” bit, like she is the only diplomat in the Alliance. All we needed was a superweapon again to make it hit all the marks. I’ve always felt like there is a definite “feel” to Bantam-era Star Wars, though, and this book certainly has that. It’s quite hard to explain, really, but I thought it was interesting how the capital city of Bakura always felt like any other kind of unremarkable planetary capital.\n\nI seem to recall not being a big fan of this book when I read it, and it hasn’t fared any better this time around, either. Part of the problem then, I think, was that I was coming down from a Zahn high, so in comparison it didn’t entertain me quite as much as I’d wanted. Now, it just feels all a bit silly, with the entechment of human souls inside droids, who don’t seem to be particularly all that good at being droids when the process is complete, anyway. Why bother waging wars to capture slaves to make into droids, when you could just take a robotics course and develop things that way? The premise definitely felt off, to me.\n\nOne thing that is notable, however, is that Leia is visited by the Force ghost of Anakin Skywalker here. She has historically had a hard time with dealing with the fact that Darth Vader is her father, and I think it has always been somewhat overlooked by the books what exactly that means. Of course, in the new canon we only have the one book that deals with this, Bloodlines, but in the old canon there were a few throwaway references, but nothing more. Well, Anakin asks for her forgiveness, and she tells him to do one – blowing up Alderaan and torturing Han will take a lot to get over, after all! She definitely has a point – far too much is made of Luke “sensing the good” in him, and I don’t think that can possibly outweigh the fact that Vader was not a mindless drone controlled by the Emperor. Sure, the Emperor corrupted Vader for his own ends, but some of that darkness and villainy was always in there, and Anakin should be held accountable for it.\n\nAnyway, that’s the end of that particular rant!\n\nIf I were to not read this book for another 25 years, not only would I be retired by the time I came back to it, but I don’t think I would miss it in my life, and I suppose that’s the basis for my 2 out of 5 review. Some interesting paragraphs, but ultimately it was still a bit of a slog."
