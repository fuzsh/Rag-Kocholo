Valente,\n\nFrom my list on sweeping space operas with metaphysical themes.\n\nBy Jen Finelli Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nFrom dancing on a crane in a meteor shower, to earning a history degree at the top program in my country; bathing under a waterfall to cradling the dying as a physician—I’ve always straddled the line between adventure and hunger for the truth beyond. Some books are the same way: they pull you in with fun and plot, and colors, and they leave you with bigger thoughts and questions about the Universe at large. All genres have this capacity for surprise and depth, but space opera’s best—here’s a list of reads with that special metaphysical power.\n\nJen's book list on sweeping space operas with metaphysical themes\n\nWhy did Jen love this book?\n\nI picked up this book because the back cover made it sound like this funny romp where a rock competition decides the fate of the Earth—and who doesn’t want that? But this isn’t just a more uplifting version of that one Rick and Morty episode about “Gettin’ Schwifty.” With vivid worlds and deeply flawed characters, Space Opera is like a psychedelic trip with that brilliant, probably-drunk friend whose gorgeous mind you could listen to for days. (Stop looking at me like that! I’m not in love with her syntax, you are!) Don’t get me wrong: there are so many behaviors in Space Opera that I recommend against as a sexual health physician—they’d increase your risk of disease and mental illness—and I’ve got moral positions that don’t jive with Valente’s vision, either. But there’s a scene where Valente touches on immigration and deportation that made me weep and left an indent…\n\nBy Catherynne M. Valente,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Space Opera as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nFINALIST FOR HUGO AWARD FOR BEST NOVEL 2019\n\nFINALIST FOR LOCUS AWARD FOR BEST SCIENCE FICTION NOVEL 2019\n\nIN SPACE EVERYONE CAN HEAR YOU SING\n\nA century ago, intelligent space-faring life was nearly destroyed during the Sentience Wars. To bring the shattered worlds together in the spirit of peace, unity and understanding, the Metagalactic Grand Prix was created. Part concert, part contest, all extravaganza, species far and wide gather to compete in feats of song, dance and/or whatever facsimile of these can be performed by various creatures who may or may not possess, in the traditional sense, feet, mouths, larynxes…\n\nPreview\n\nOut of the Silent Planet\n\nBy C. S. Lewis,\n\nFrom my list on sweeping space operas with metaphysical themes.\n\nBy Jen Finelli Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nFrom dancing on a crane in a meteor shower, to earning a history degree at the top program in my country; bathing under a waterfall to cradling the dying as a physician—I’ve always straddled the line between adventure and hunger for the truth beyond.

All genres have this capacity for surprise and depth, but space opera’s best—here’s a list of reads with that special metaphysical power.\n\nJen's book list on sweeping space operas with metaphysical themes\n\nWhy did Jen love this book?\n\nOn the surface, OOTSP is about a British linguist who’s kidnapped to Mars, then escapes to meet pensive furry seal-people who teach him Earth sucks. Lewis borrows from H.G. Wells’ space travel and—this was written pre-space-age—his haunting, fantastical solar system doesn’t match what we’ve learned since, but his totally unique take on the physics of interdimensional beings rips the pants off anything anyone else ever wrote in metaphysical sci-fi. These angels aren’t your church’s cherubs, they’re not Frank Peretti’s white-robed super-soldiers, and they’re not Aslan and friends: Lewis actually took the limited science he had at the time about space and dimensional theory, and applied that science to his spirituality with fascinating imagination. The second book in this series, Perelandra, was always my favorite for its tense philosophy, gorgeous floating continents, and tortured protagonist, but Out of the Silent Planet—with ideas comparable in scope to Vernor Vinge’s “Zones…\n\nBy C. S. Lewis,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked Out of the Silent Planet as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe first novel in C.S. Lewis's classic sci-fi trilogy which tells the adventure of Dr Ransom who is kidnapped and transported to Mars\n\nIn the first novel of C.S. Lewis's classic science fiction trilogy, Dr Ransom, a Cambridge academic, is abducted and taken on a spaceship to the red planet of Malacandra, which he knows as Mars. His captors are plotting to plunder the planet's treasures and plan to offer Ransom as a sacrifice to the creatures who live there. Ransom discovers he has come from the 'silent planet' - Earth - whose tragic story is known throughout the universe...\n\nPreview\n\nRedshirts\n\nBy John Scalzi,\n\nFrom my list on bridging high art and B-movies.\n\nBy Justin Robinson Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nThe best stories are the ones that take very silly ideas seriously. This doesn’t mean that they’re not funny; on the contrary, you don’t really hear the truth until it makes you laugh. These books all lean heavily on tropes, specifically B-movie tropes. I used to write detailed reviews of terrible movies, afterschool specials, and creature features. I host a podcast all about the funnier parts of TV criticism. Figuring out how something simple speaks to the core of us is the height of fiction, and all five of these do that and do it with humor.\n\nJustin's book list on bridging high art and B-movies\n\nWhy did Justin love this book?\n\nIt’s hard to beat Scalzi for nailing the execution of a high concept.\n\nRedshirts could have so easily been nothing but a gimmick, but Scalzi really gets into the guts of the horror and humor of being a character written for the sole purpose of dying. I picked up the book with a cynical eye, expecting to hate it, but it drew me in.\n\nScalzi went so much further with the concept, shined a light on every corner of the idea, that he managed to create a deconstruction and reconstruction of the same trope at the same time.\n\nBy John Scalzi,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n4 authors picked Redshirts as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n'I can honestly say I can't think of another book that ever made me laugh this much.

Some books are the same way: they pull you in with fun and plot, and colors, and they leave you with bigger thoughts and questions about the Universe at large. All genres have this capacity for surprise and depth, but space opera’s best—here’s a list of reads with that special metaphysical power.\n\nJen's book list on sweeping space operas with metaphysical themes\n\nWhy did Jen love this book?\n\nI’m a physician, so it’s probably not surprising that a book by a physician about an alien physician might hit my list of meaningful space operas. What is surprising is Star Surgeon’s double-twist—the patients aren’t who we think they are, and the secret to getting Earth into the prestigious Galactic Confederation isn’t what we think it is—both of which actually had huge real-world thematic implications. On face level, it’s a medical thriller: the protag’s the first alien to graduate from human medical school, and he’s got to prove himself by curing an epidemic on a remote planet without arousing the ire of his human teachers. (I felt like this in residency.) But on a metaphysical level, Star Surgeon is a quiet manifesto dissecting the origins of racism—and the very biology of sentience itself.\n\nBy Alan E Nourse,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Star Surgeon as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA Sector General Novel In the far future Humans are part of an intergalactic civilization populated with countless alien races. Humans are prized for their medical expertise and make up almost all of doctors in the galaxy. Dal Timgar is the first non-human to attempt to become a qualified physician recognized by the Hospital Earth. But, before he reaches his goal he and his companions find a plague planet that may change the course of history.\n\nPreview\n\nStar Wars From a Certain Point of View\n\nBy Renée Ahdieh, Meg Cabot, Pierce Brown , Sabaa Tahir , Nnedi Okorafor , Tom Angleberger , Jeffrey Brown , Rae Carson , Zoraida Cordova , Delilah S.

This role as science advisor for the franchise has bridged my career between hard science and fictional writing. Like many fans, I am one who simply wants to walk, live, and breathe in these fictional worlds that bring us so much joy. I always look for new ways to immerse myself, be it episode or movie rewatches, extended universe shows, comics, video games, and yes, books!\n\nErin's book list on beloved sci-fi universes\n\nWhy did Erin love this book?\n\nWith only two books out (referencing Star Wars: A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back) the From a Certain Point of View books are brilliant. So brilliant. I can’t explain how much I love these books in one short paragraph. They are a collection of short stories written by dozens of authors who recall events in the films both big and small. Did you ever want to know who the guy is on Hoth who interrupts Han and Leia arguing? Well, now you do! With each story taking only about 20 minutes to read, they’re a perfect nighttime story that add such richness to the films we’ve all seen dozens, if not hundreds, of times.\n\nBy Renée Ahdieh, Meg Cabot, Pierce Brown , Sabaa Tahir , Nnedi Okorafor , Tom Angleberger , Jeffrey Brown , Rae Carson , Zoraida Cordova , Delilah S.

Glut,\n\nFrom my list on sci-fi that meld military and paranormal themes.\n\nBy Kurt D. Springs Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am Kurt D. Springs. If you read my back of the book bio, you’ll find I have advanced degrees in anthropology and archaeology and a focus on European prehistory. However, I’ve always been fascinated by military history. I’ve recently studied how modern warfare has changed many old paradigms. I’ve also studied modern and ancient religions, and many of the fiction works I enjoy have ESP or magic elements, especially Andre Norton’s works. I am also a fan of the HALO game universe. I like to tell people my stories are the children of Andre Norton’s Forerunner series and HALO.\n\nKurt's book list on sci-fi that meld military and paranormal themes\n\nWhy did Kurt love this book?\n\nWhile I found all the original trilogy stories enjoyable, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back fascinated me with the weaponry and battles at the beginning.\n\nLuke’s Jedi training under Yoda was something that I found inspirational. Yoda’s admonition on focus, control, and belief inspired the scenes of Liam being trained. I enjoyed the final interplay between Luke and Darth Vader, ending with Luke’s realization that experience matters.\n\nBy Donald F.

I started writing because most of the new books coming out just plain sucked, so I figured if I could do better, then I should…and I did. What people only partially realize is that Star Force is filled with references and homages to the past great works. There’s far more in there than they realize, but those who have also read them will know when they see them. This list gives you the biggest influences that shaped my childhood mind, and why there are literally statues in the Star Force Universe to a lot of this stuff.\n\nAer-ki's book list on that defined great storytelling for me as a kid\n\nWhy did Aer-ki love this book?\n\nHeir to the Empire was the foundational book in my childhood. I lived and breathed the Star Wars movies, and this book was essentially another movie continuing the story rather than some authors’ fanfic projects (too many to name). Reading about Luke, Han, and Leia doing new things was a breath of fresh air after watching the movies 50 times each, but that’s not why this book is so important. I can sum it up in one word…\n\nThrawn.\n\nHe is a character unlike any other I’ve ever encountered and is the benchmark for me when it comes to a mastermind. He’s evil, but not completely, and you find you almost want him to win as you read through it. Not because he’s evil, but because he’s professional, motivated, and immensely skilled…as opposed to the Rebel Alliance that can’t walk and chew gum at the same time.\n\nGrand Admiral Thrawn…\n\nBy Timothy Zahn,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Heir to the Empire as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • In this essential Star Wars Legends novel—the first ever to take place after the events of the original trilogy—Grand Admiral Thrawn makes his debut on the galactic stage.\n\nFive years ago, the Rebel Alliance destroyed the Death Star, defeated Darth Vader and the Emperor, and drove the remnants of the old Imperial Starfleet to a distant corner of the galaxy. Princess Leia and Han Solo are married and expecting twins. And Luke Skywalker has become the first in a long-awaited line of Jedi Knights.\n\nBut thousands of light-years away, the last of the Emperor’s…\n\nPreview\n\nDragon Wing\n\nBy Margaret Weis, Tracy Hickman,\n\nWhy did JMD love this book?\n\nI have read a lot of fantasy in the 90s, but until I read Margaret Weis and Tracey Hickman, it had all been basically Europe with magic. Dragon Wing is a world of floating islands where water is scarce and wars are fought over it. Humans fly on dragons. Elves sail on airships.\n\nIt takes place in one of four elemental worlds that are all so different and so imaginative. They are so much different from our worlds and taught me to create worlds that were just impossible outside of magic and fantasy. Its structure is also very similar to Malazan Book of the Fallen, where we're following different characters in each book but all building toward something amazing. Plus, there's a crazy wizard named Zifnab that sometimes thinks he's Gandalf and sometimes that he's Luke Skywalker.\n\nBy Margaret Weis, Tracy Hickman,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Dragon Wing as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nHugh the Hand agrees to assassinate the king's son but is unprepared for the magical being who is his victim's guardian or for the difficulty that awaits him in the realm of the dwarves\n\nPreview\n\nThe Rough Patch\n\nBy Brian Lies,\n\nWhy did Caroline love this book?\n\nThis may be one of the most-read books in our house, which is saying something for a book about a gardening aficionado named Evan, whose dog dies in the first few spreads.\n\nIt’s hard for even our 2-year-old not to bristle when Evan, in his grief, violently destroys his beloved garden. But watching how he unintentionally nurtures a once prickly vine into a prized-winning pumpkin has all of us cheering with each read.\n\nI love how this story doesn’t shy away from the deep pain that comes with losing someone we love and doesn’t sugarcoat the long, often lonely process of coming back to the surface for air. Kids are ready for this honesty, and this book does it with a gentle but honest sense of purpose.\n\nBy Brian Lies,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n4 authors picked The Rough Patch as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA Caldecott Honor Book\n\nAn ALA Notable Book\n\nA breathtakingly beautiful and luminescent book that is pitch-perfect for anyone of any age who has experienced any type of loss or disappointment, from New York Times-bestselling picture book creator Brian Lies.\n\nNew York Times-bestselling author-illustrator Brian Lies has created a beautiful, accessible, and deeply personal story about friendship, loss, and renewal.
