Originally a duology released in the late '80s, in 2001 the series was rewritten to incorporate Christian themes and re-released, and a third book was added. In 2011, a fourth book came out, with a fifth and final book slated to be released in 2012.\n\nLady Firebird Angelo is a royal wastling, born only to ensure that the royal line of Netaia does not die out and fated to commit honorable suicide now that her eldest sister has had two children. As a skilled military pilot, Firebird is ordered into the first wave of the attack against Veroh, a planet under Federate protection, under orders to seek honorable death in combat. Unfortunately for her plans, her mental cry of distress over the death of her wingman (and best friend) is noticed by the telepathic Special Operations officer, Brennen Caldwell, piquing his interest. He orders her captured.\n\nWhile interrogating her via mind access, he realizes that they are perfectly connatural: their brains function in the exact same way, potentially enabling them to connect far more deeply than they could with anyone who was not connatural with them. Not wanting to lose the only person perfectly connatural with him, Brennen offers Firebird Federate asylum. Firebird is thus forced to choose between her desire to live and her proud loyalty to a country that demands her death.\n\nThe series includes these books:\n\nFirebird\n\nFusion Fire\n\nCrown of Fire\n\nTheir New Masters (short story)\n\nWind and Shadow\n\nDaystar\n\nTropes used in Firebird Trilogy include:\n\nAlas, Poor Villain: Brennen's reaction to Phoena's death.\n\nBadass Princess: Firebird, while not technically a princess because of the Netaian inheritance structure, qualifies. She had a choice between going into advanced music studies or going into the military. She chose the military, and has repeatedly demonstrated her fighting skills. She also has no diplomatic skills, contrasting with Princess Classic Carradee and Politically-Active Princess Phoena.\n\nBig Bad:\n\nFirebird: Phoena Angelo.\n\nFusion Fire: Eshdeth Shirak.\n\nCrown of Fire: Modabah Shirak.\n\nWind and Shadow: The Shadow possessing Tamím Bar'Baror.\n\nCharacter Title: The first book, Firebird, is named after the main character, Firebird.\n\nCold-Blooded Torture:\n\nThe operation of the dendric striker:\n\n\"It causes all the central motor neurons to fire. Every muscle contracts, every synapse sparks as if it were insane. It will near your muscles from the bones, and eventually stop your breathing . . . but it leaves sensory nerves intact to the very end.\""
