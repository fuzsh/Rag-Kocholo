Because of her birthplace in the family, however, her life is expendable. Honorable suicide is the highest calling she could hope to attain.

Instead she is taken prisoner during the battle and is held by the enemy.With her own people seeking her sacrifice, Firebird must choose between two worlds before she can carve out her new destiny. This is the story of Lady Firebird's personal battle and its eternal consequences, not only for herself but for everyone around her, and especially the man who loves her.",
