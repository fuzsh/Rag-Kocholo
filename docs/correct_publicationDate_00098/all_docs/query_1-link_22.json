        "text": "Star Wars Galaxy VS Evil Energy Stealing Lizards!\n\nStar Wars: The Truce at Bakura The Star Wars at Bakura is a hardcover book that was released in December of 1993 by Bantam Spectra books. It was written by Kathy Tyers. This book takes place right after the Battle of Endor. The rebels intercept an imperial probe/distress beacon asking for help from the imperial outer rim planet of Bakura. Once the rebel's decode the message for Palpatine they learn that the planet is under seige from a reptilian race call the Ssi-Ruuk. The book sets the tone on how the rebellion has to show up and interact with the empire now that Palpatine is dead. At first the Bakura planet's governor is happy for any help. However, deals and sabotage start as they try to turn over the rebel heroes to the Ssi-Ruuk! The book is not bad. It plays with some ideas as Luke being in command of a cruiser type ship, Leia having Anakin Skywalker appear to her, and the whole idea of the Rebellion/Empire interaction. The introduction of the Ssi-Ruuk for this one time novel is not bad. It was the catalyst to bring everything together. Also, this book is a very early release in the entire Star Wars Expanded Universe series. So by today's book standards it is *very* weak. Yet, at the time it was a fun read. 3/5. Enjoyable to read if you don't pay full price for it. Latsyrhc Tamarack CollectiblesRead full review"
