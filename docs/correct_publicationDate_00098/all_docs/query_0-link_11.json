        "text": "Good intro to Legends\n\nAlthough dated and abridged this still serves as a good intro to the Star Wars Legends timeline. Good performance from the reader is a plus\n\nTruce at Bakura\n\nWhile not my favorite tale in the EU it beats the new books by miles. Even abridged. It takes place minutes after RTOJ. Wedge Antillies discovers a message sent to the Empire from Bukura. A message pleading for the now dead Palpatineâ€™s help. Instead, with newly knighted Jedi Luke Skywalker (yeah the one you remember), Han, Leia, and Chewbacca to help. While welcome at first (Bukura is an Imperial planet) the threat of the Ssi-Ruuk invasion... I like to listen to think of the abridged books as audiomovies of paperbacks I love.\n\nGreat book, disappointed with the audiobook\n\nRead this in paperback years ago and was excited to revisit it with this audiobook. The abridged version gets the gist of the story, but three hours really doesn't do it justice. It was sad knowing how much was missing here. Although the reading did improve dramatically after the first 20 minutes (narrator forgot to stop to breath lol), he kept pronouncing words funny (\"Han\", \"Palpatine\", etc) and his characterization of voices felt way off. It's like he'd never even watched the movies himself. My suggestion? Skip this one and grab the paperback instead.\n\nNostalgia Trip\n\nnever thought I'd ever get to hear this recording again! Amazing work! excited for more\n\nMy first Star Wars book\n\nI am new to the Star Wars books and decided to start with the one right after the the 6th episode. I loved this story, and it's was amazing how close Luke and Dev had gotten in a short time. The way the scenes are described makes you feel like you are thee. For this to be my first book from Audible I will definitely be getting more books from here.\n\nabridged\n\nlove everything about this story except the abridgmement and I love to hear Marc Thompson reading this\n\nabridged!\n\nwhy make an audiobook if you're just going to cut out the story, its a great book but it's a shame it's missing."
