        "text": "Firebird\n\nThe Firebird Series\n\nBook One\n\nKATHY TYERS\n\nDedication\n\nTo Steve Laube, gratefully\n\nPrelude\n\nLady Firebird Angelo was trespassing.\n\nShadowed by her friend, Lord Corey Bowman, she squeezed and twisted through a narrow, upright opening between two dusty stone walls. She’d paced off twenty meters in silence. Her eyes had almost adjusted to the faint gray light from ahead and behind. Growing up in this palace, she’d explored it thoroughly and cautiously during her childhood. She hadn’t tiptoed between these particular walls since she found the gap, four years ago, when she was fifteen. If she remembered right, then in ten meters more—\n\nSomething rattled behind her. She froze. If anyone caught her and Corey this deep in the governmental wing, they could be done for. Powers help us! she prayed silently.\n\nSlowly, she turned around. Corey crouched three meters away. He pointed at a loose stone and cringed a silent apology.\n\nTime hung suspended, like a laser satellite passing overhead. They waited motionless, hardly even breathing.\n\nEvidently, the Powers weren’t feeling vengeful—if those supernatural guides even existed, which Firebird had started to doubt. The soft voices behind the curved inner wall kept droning on, incomprehensible from this point in the hidden passage.\n\nFirebird crept on.\n\nThe rough partition on her left enclosed an elliptical chamber. Inside, the highest council in the Netaian planetary systems held its conferences.\n\nFirebird had heard whispered rumors among other cadets at the NPN Academy: that the Netaian Planetary Navy planned to hold military exercises in Federate space, or that an attack was imminent—Federate or Netaian, depending on who had heard whom—or that secret weapons were under development. None of her instructing officers had acknowledged those rumors. They kept their cadets working in blind, busy ignorance.\n\nBut this morning, staring out a classroom window-wall, Firebird had seen a silvery shuttle with Federate markings emblazoned on its underside decelerate into Citangelo spaceport. According to a hasty check at her desk terminal, the queen’s Electorate had immediately closed this afternoon’s session to observers.\n\nMaybe the Federates were protesting those rumored maneuvers, as she guessed—or trying to head off an open confrontation, Corey’s assumption. Someone had to find out, on behalf of the second-year cadets. If a war broke out, they’d be in it. During an afternoon hour reserved for studying, Firebird had sneaked home with Corey.\n\nAhead, light gleamed into their passage through an inner-wall chink. The palace’s builders, three hundred years before, had been more concerned with elegance than security. During her privileged childhood, Firebird had found many odd niches in this historic building where walls didn’t exactly meet, or where they came together at peculiar angles to create blind passageways. Palace security should have sealed every breach that gave illegitimate access to the electoral chamber. They’d missed this one.\n\nOn her next birthday, Firebird would be confirmed as a short-term elector. That was her right, an honor she would receive as an Angelo. Then, she would tell the House Guard and the electoral police about this passage.\n\nBut no sooner.\n\nShe reached the chink and peered through. Inside the grand chamber’s red walls, lined with portraits and gilt bas-relief false pillars, the Netaian systems’ twenty-seven electors sat at a U-shaped table that surrounded a small foreign delegation.\n\nFirebird glimpsed the rest of her family. Her oldest sister and confidante, Carradee, sat beside the gilt chair of their mother, Siwann, a strong monarch who was already much more than the traditional electoral figurehead. Beyond Carradee lounged the middle Angelo sister, Phoena, the beauty of the family and Siwann’s obvious favorite. Though taller and lighter haired than Firebird, Phoena had the same delicate facial features and large, long-lashed dark eyes. They’d often been mistaken for each other, to the disgust of both.\n\nFive strangers stood below the U-shaped table’s open foot. The two who’d stepped forward wore dress-white tunics and carried recall pads. One addressed the electors in clipped Old Colonial, the language of most colonized worlds in the Whorl’s great half circle of stars. . . . as a surtax only on nonessential goods, he declared, such as . . .\n\nWhat was this, a trade delegation?\n\nPhoena exchanged disdainful glances with the trade minister, Muirnen Rogonin. Maintaining an indolent slouch, Rogonin—the jowly Duke of Claighbro—flicked two fingers toward the man who’d spoken. I would see no reason to levy a military assessment against a well-defended system such as Netaia, Admiral. Your logic is flawed.\n\nAdmiral. Maybe their business wasn’t entirely trade, then—\n\nCorey nudged Firebird from behind. Hey, he whispered.\n\nReluctantly, she rolled away from the chink. She pressed against the inner wall, listening closely.\n\nIn recent decades, the Federacy had consolidated twenty-three star systems in the local spur of the galactic arm. Netaia, isolated at the Whorl’s counterspinward end, had resisted confederation. Despite tight governmental control over their lives, most Netaians lived in proud and comfortable, if xenophobic, prosperity . . . so far as Firebird knew.\n\nAs the debate continued, she gradually concluded that the Federates did in fact want to set up a trading protocol. She glowered into the darkness. For this, she’d risked death?\n\nPredictably, the noble electors—the heart of Netaia’s spiritual and political power, which Firebird’s family served as standard-bearers—were mouthing the same isolationist policies she’d heard all her life. Rogonin’s voice rose, boasting about Netaia’s high culture, its superbly terraformed ecological diversity, and the absolute lack of necessity of trade with any other planetary system.\n\nAll true, Firebird reflected with casual pride. Netaia was a wealthy world with rich resources.\n\nShe glanced at Corey. He stared through the chink, his oval face lit softly by fugitive light. Black haired and freckled, he was broadening into manhood, but they never had—never would—become romantically involved. Both were wastlings. Both would die young, as the Powers had decreed for most of these third- and fourth-born noble children. Firebird and Corey had made a pact, years ago, not to make that fate any harder on each other.\n\nShe jabbed his midsection. My turn, she mouthed.\n\nShe pressed her face to cold stone and looked enviously on the five Federates. The thought of so many worlds, so much knowledge, frustrated her. She would only see the Federate systems as a military pilot, if at all.\n\nBehind the two ambassadors, an honor guard stood at stiff attention, two armed men in ash gray and one in vivid midnight blue. Ash gray was for Tallis, the Federacy’s regional capital. Midnight blue . . . ? Firebird frowned. She ought to remember—\n\nRealization hit her like a laser blast. Midnight blue designated Thyrica. That was only a minor Federate system, but a few Thyrians were genetically engineered telepaths. Was this man one of them, and a spy?\n\nAlarmed, she leaned toward Corey to whisper.\n\nThe Thyrian guard turned his head and looked straight at her. Firebird’s jaw dropped. She hadn’t made a sound! Her pulse accelerated as the Thyrian stepped back from his formation to touch the arm of a red-jacketed electoral policeman. He whispered into the redjacket’s ear, and as he did, she caught a sparkle at the edge of his right shoulder, where the telepaths wore their gold insignia.\n\nShe flung herself away from the wall. Corey, they spotted us! she whispered. They must move fast . . . and separately. Because she was an Angelo, she stood a better chance of surviving arrest. Get out the underway, she ordered. I’ll go back through the palace.\n\nAs Corey dashed toward a boarded-in cellar hatch, Firebird squeezed back through the narrows. Trying to run silently, she dashed to the passage’s end and scrambled up a stone partition. She rolled onto a crawlway, groped for the board they’d left loose, and whisked it aside, then peered down into the public-zone maintenance closet.\n\nSo far, so good. The closet was dark. Heart hammering, she lowered herself through the impromptu hatch and then cracked the hall door.\n\nIt swung out of her grasp, seized from outside. A massive black-haired man backed across the marble hallway, covering the closet with a deadly service blazer. Kelling Friel, captain of the electoral police, obviously recognized Firebird at the same instant she recognized him. Lady Firebird, he growled, replacing his blazer in its holster.\n\nShe stood a moment, collecting her breath and her wits as she straightened her red-collared Academy blouse. The electoral police carried special authority over Netaia’s small wastling class. Firebird had learned years ago—the hard way—that redjackets only honored regal manners, which they encouraged. A few wastlings eventually became heirs, so they all had to be trained, in case they survived to head their families.\n\nShe nodded a solemn greeting. Good afternoon, Captain, she said. It’s only me.\n\nHe stepped into the closet, peered into the dark gap in its ceiling, and then frowned. I think, my lady, that you’d better come inside. He swept a muscular hand up the passway.\n\nInto the chamber? A cold weight settled in Firebird’s stomach, but she had to obey. She walked beside him toward the chamber’s gilt doors.\n\nTen powerful families governed Netaia, guarding its traditions of faith and authority. Representing the ancient and holy Powers—its state religion—to the common classes, those ruling families religiously controlled their heirs. Third- and fourth-born noble children could live only until their eldest brothers or sisters secured their titled lines’ survival. Then the young wastlings were ordered to seek honorable ends to their lives. Outranked, outnumbered, and constantly chaperoned by electoral police, they had little chance of escaping that sacred duty.\n\nEven earlier, an offensive wastling could be severely disciplined. Fifteen-year-old Lord Liach Stele had faced a firing squad two years ago for incorrigible behavior. Firebird had never liked Liach, but when she was required to attend his execution, she’d watched with sickened pity and damp palms. She too had been disciplined. Last year, an Academy senior had caught her practicing docking maneuvers on off-limit flight sims. For her punishment, the redjackets had injected her with Tactol, a sensory hyperstimulant that made every sight, sound, odor, and movement torture for an hour . . .\n\n. . . and then they’d locked her back inside the simulator. Despite the excruciating sensory overload, she’d flown the pre-programmed mission with furious determination. Her all-Academy record still stood.\n\nShe wiped her palms on her uniform trousers. Friel’s decorative sword harness jingled as he marched her through the chamber’s double doors and up toward the U-shaped table. A second red-jacketed electoral policeman fell into step on her other side. Firebird drew a deep breath. Trying to look both submissive and innocent, although she felt neither, she looked up at her mother.\n\nSiwann rose from her gilt chair. An unadorned coronet rode squarely on her coifed hair. With her tailored scarlet dress suit, the effect mimicked a formal portrait. You have been spying, Firebird, she said. Alone?\n\nFirebird was too proud to lie, but she never would’ve betrayed another wastling, particularly Corey. She stalled for his sake, glancing sidelong at her escorts in their long, gold-edged crimson coats. If she’d been three years younger, she might have tried to kick one of them. But since then, her oldest sister had married and borne her first child. Firebird’s life expectancy had already shrunk.\n\nCarradee looked down from the table, biting her lip and raising both eyebrows. Their middle sister, Phoena, merely smirked.\n\nCaptain Friel gripped Firebird’s arm through the long auburn hair she wore loose over her shoulders. Answer Her Majesty, he ordered.\n\nGambling on a few more seconds for Corey, she glanced at the Federates instead. They’d stepped aside, waiting to resume negotiations. The slim Thyrian stood apart from his muscular colleagues, almost as if they answered to him, despite their weathered faces. He looked the youngest, with a straight chin and vividly blue eyes. He stared at Firebird so intently that for an instant, she imagined she could feel his scrutiny. He wore that gold star on his shoulder openly, either flaunting his identity or at least refusing to disguise it.\n\nWe see you, she challenged him silently. We know what you are. Go back where you belong.\n\nCaptain Friel tightened his grip. Firebird faced her mother again and silently prayed to the Powers that the Electorate wouldn’t try to impress the Federacy by executing her for espionage. Your Majesty, she said, lowering her eyes and hoping that by now, Siwann would want to get on with business—or with refusing to do business—and that Corey would’ve escaped. I apologize for interrupting. I promise not to observe you again. Ever.\n\nThe queen stood, visibly evaluating Firebird’s breach of conduct. This is my youngest daughter, she told the Federates. She has a history of playing hide-and-search in the palace. I assure you, she is no threat to this meeting’s security. However, she added, raising her voice, you are too old for games, Lady Firebird. You will not be dismissed with just an apology.\n\nFirebird’s stomach knotted.\n\nFriel? Siwann’s voice echoed off the red walls, black marble floor, and domed ceiling. She will show you her spying place. See that it is made inaccessible.\n\nThe captain touched his cap in salute. Any further orders, Majesty? he asked blandly.\n\nFirebird met her mother’s cold stare. This time, she didn’t beg the Powers for mercy. She’d been caught, and she faced the consequences. Phoena’s smirk broadened.\n\nTactol again, said the queen.\n\nFriel grasped Firebird’s shoulder. She marched out, breathing slowly and deeply, maintaining a dignified brace until the massive doors boomed behind her. Then her shoulders relaxed. Someday, after Carradee and her prince secured the Angelo inheritance with a second child, she would kneel at the foot of that gold-rimmed electoral table to receive her geis orders. Compared with that virtually inevitable sentence, one miserable hour was nothing. She’d survived Tactol before.\n\nStill, maybe she could distract Captain Friel. That one’s a spy, she muttered, pausing in the great hallway. The guard in the dark blue tunic.\n\nWe know, Friel answered. They’re going directly back to their shuttle. They won’t see anything they can’t image from orbit. It’s another spy who concerns me now. You.\n\nShe followed Friel back up the passway, disgusted. Five years from now she would be dead, guilty only of having been born after Phoena . . . while Phoena still sat on the Electorate, steering Netaian policies. The Powers had decreed their birth order.\n\nFriel paused outside the hall closet where she’d emerged. Show me your . . . no. Come this way first. You’ll remember this better if we stop in my office.\n\nFirebird’s poise slipped at last. Shivering, she resisted the childish urge to plead for a reprieve. She had only one irrational fear, but the redjackets had found it. Injecting instruments—intersprays, sub-Q and intramusc dispersers, and old-fashioned needles—terrified her.\n\nAnd it had been a trade delegation.\n\nFriel motioned her through an open door. She squared her shoulders. At least Corey had escaped. She wouldn’t cringe, wouldn’t cry, wouldn’t react at all, if she could help it. She might be only a wastling, but she was an Angelo.\n\n1\n\nWastling\n\nmaestoso non tanto\n\nmajestically, but not too much\n\nA Netaian year had passed since Firebird’s first brush with the distant, powerful Federacy.\n\n. . . but the phase inducer—here—bypasses the third subset of . . .\n\nFirebird dropped her hand into her lap, unable to concentrate. She leaned away from the table and gazed up at a crystal chandelier that lit the palace’s private breakfast hall, and she let her mind wander far from the Academy scanbook that glowed on her viewer. In a week, she must be able to reproduce that schematic for a senior-level exam. But tonight, she would appear for an interview with the queen.\n\nIn the year since she’d been caught spying, the Netaian Planetary Navy had carried out those rumored maneuvers in Federate space, drawing a strenuous protest. Her mother’s electors had tightened their grip on both high- and low-common classes. Carradee’s little daughter had charmed the palace household, and Phoena—\n\nPhoena burst through a swinging door. You nearly got yourself taken to see Captain Friel again last night, she chanted to Firebird.\n\nPhoena hadn’t changed a hair.\n\nFirebird watched over her empty breakfast plate as her middle sister paced the table’s length.\n\nI can’t believe you’d be so stupid. Phoena seized a chair across from Firebird and rang for service. Her spring gown shone by morning light, and when Firebird glanced from Phoena’s sparkling earrings and necklace up to the chandelier, she couldn’t help comparing. As an Academy senior of noble family, Firebird had been allowed to move back to the estate for her final semester. It wasn’t far from campus, and this was still her home, for a few last weeks.\n\nCountervoting the whole Electorate? Phoena went on. With a unanimity order? What’s the matter with you? Have you forgotten your place?\n\nThis year, Firebird also had learned that her music—she played the high-headed Netaian small harp, or clairsa—was a passport into the common classes. In quarters of Citangelo that Phoena never visited, she’d heard ballads that should make any elector nervous. After three hundred years, Netaia was beginning to chafe under the Electorate’s absolute rule and its grip on the planet’s wealth.\n\nFirebird faced her sister squarely. You know what I think about your basium project. If I had to do it again, I’d still vote my conscience. You’re not expanding our buffer zone. You only want a threat, a show of power.\n\nSo you said. Phoena buffed her nails on the sleeve of her gown. We heard you clearly yesterday.\n\nFirebird laid her palms on the scanbook viewer. You got your commendation, didn’t you? Twenty-six to one.\n\nOne. Phoena lifted an eyebrow. \"In your position, I think I’d be trying to live awhile. You’re lucky the redjackets haven’t already wasted you. Wastlings who countervote don’t last. You’re only in there for show, you know. For your honor,\" she mocked.\n\nFirebird curled her fingers around her viewer. \"There’s no honor,\" she mimicked Phoena’s tone, in threatening worlds that would rather trade with us than attack us. Phoena’s project was secret, and no commoner knew of it. Still, Firebird had used her vote to express her people’s earnestly sung longings to live in free, fair peace.\n\nYou never should have had electing rights to begin with, Phoena retorted.\n\nThe door swung beyond Phoena. Firebird fell silent, toying with her cruinn cup. Carradee pushed through. A servitor-class attendant followed the tallest and eldest Angelo sister. A deep green robe draped Carradee’s form, now swollen with a second pregnancy.\n\nFirebird’s life expectancy had almost zeroed.\n\nCarrie, Firebird murmured as the crown princess sank into a cushioned chair held by the servant. You look exhausted.\n\nCarradee sighed and splayed her fingers on her belly. With the little one’s dancing all night, it’s a wonder I sleep at all. And I’m so worried for you, Firebird. Why must you try so hard to throw away the time that’s left to you?\n\nPhoena leaned back and fixed Firebird with dark eyes.\n\nEasy for Phoena to smirk now, Firebird reflected, but it hadn’t always been that way. Phoena had been born a wastling. Firebird was three at the time and Phoena six, both beginning their indoctrination into their holy destiny, when their second-born sister had been found smothered. Investigation had implicated the programmer of Lintess’s favorite toy, a lifelike robot snow bear, but—as with the death of their father years later—Firebird harbored suspicions about Phoena that she didn’t care to voice.\n\nShe watched the scarlet-liveried servitor hurry out. How can you condone fouling a world, Carradee? She spread her hands on the tabletop. Aren’t some things worth standing against?\n\nBut, Firebird—oh! Carradee grimaced and stroked her stretched belly. I’ll be glad when this is over.\n\nFirebird bit her lip.\n\nPhoena seized the opening like a weapon. Five weeks, she crowed. Then there’ll be a shift in the family.\n\nCarradee turned pale gray eyes to Phoena in a mute reprimand.\n\nFirebird snapped her viewer off. I’ll have longer than that. They’ll send me with the invasion force. I would love to fly strike, just once. And I’d rather die flying than . . . She bit back the comparison. Another wastling had gone recently in a suspicious groundcar accident, but her grief was still too fresh to expose to Phoena. Lord Rendy Gellison had wanted badly to live, had lived hard and wild.\n\nShe shook her elbow-length hair behind her shoulders and stood to leave. Phoena’s breakfast arrived, carried by a mincing whitehaired servitor. Netaia’s penal laws supplied the noble class with hereditary laborers, who lived caught between the fear of further punishment and the hope that exemplary service would win freedom. Some of the finest musicians Firebird had known, and some of the kindest people, had been servitors.\n\nShe snatched up her scanbook and swung out the door. Phoena called after her, I’ll help put the black edging on your portrait.\n\nFirebird paused in the long private hallway to gather up more Academy scan cartridges. As she pocketed them, she shot a wistful look down the gallery, past spiral-legged tables weighted with heirlooms, to the formal portrait Phoena had mentioned: She’d been sixteen and star-eyed when it was painted, absorbed in her piloting and her music, years away from this shadow of impending death. The scarlet velvette gown with white sash and diadem made her look queenly, but the artist had painted a mischievous smile between brave chin and proud brown eyes. A scarcely tangible sadness in those two-dimensional eyes always haunted Firebird. Did other people see the flaws in her mask of courage?\n\nShe straightened her brownbuck flight jacket in front of a jeweled hallway mirror. Well, she told her reflection, there’s an advantage to dying young. People will remember you as pretty. Humming a defiant ballad from the Coper Rebellion, she dashed off for the Academy.\n\nIf Firebird had been born an heir, she’d have had a hard choice between the Citangelo Music Conservatory and the Planetary Naval Academy. She loved flying, though, and had trained hard to develop from a skillful pleasure pilot into a potential naval officer. Noble families considered their wastlings’ training as investments in Netaia’s glory. When her geis orders came, she would pay back that advance by making her own contribution to Netaia’s greatness, whether or not she approved of—or survived—the invasion.\n\nMorning classes were unexceptional. After lunch, she almost crashed into Corey in a passway crowded with cadets. Easy, Firebird. He stepped back, and his grin faded. What’s wrong? Phoena again?\n\nOf course, she muttered. And Her Majesty, tonight.\n\nOh, that’s right. I forgot. Lord Corey had taken a surprise growth spurt this year. Pursing his lips in sympathy, he palmed the door panel.\n\nThey entered a hushed briefing room. This would be a two-week, special-topic session. These top cadets had waited all term to meet a civilian instructor who’d come in midwinter from the Federate world of Thyrica. Vultor Korda had turned traitor and fled to Netaia, which appalled Firebird: Loyalty was a discipline the Netaian faithful, even wastlings, didn’t question. Worse, he was known to be one of the shameful Thyrian telepaths.\n\nShe and Corey slipped into adjacent seats and loaded their viewers as the little man scuttled in. Physically, he looked anything but powerful, with a belly that strained the belt of his brown civilian shipboards. His complexion was the fragile white of the academic or the UV-allergic spacer.\n\nLast year, Firebird had learned that his kind descended from a civilization from far above the galactic plane. In a grand bioengineering experiment, they destroyed their children’s genetic integrity . . . then they almost annihilated themselves in a horrendous civil war. Only one sizable group of these starbred was known to have survived, a few religious mendicants who fled the distant Ehret system. They made planetfall on the Whorl’s north-counterspinward edge, at Thyrica.\n\nInstead of depopulating Thyrica, the Ehretan group adopted strict religious laws to control their powers. Quickly they proved to the Federacy that they were absolutely undeceivable. Since then, they’d insinuated themselves into Federate diplomatic, medical, and intelligence forces.\n\nMaybe one day, they would bring down the Federacy as their ancestors destroyed Ehret. Someone should write that song, Firebird mused.\n\nStanding at his subtronic teaching board, Vultor Korda twisted toward the quarter-circle of seats. So, he said, you think Netaia can take Veroh from the Federacy? I happen to think you have a chance.\n\nCorey fingered the edge of his terminal and whispered, Slimy. Firebird nodded without taking her eyes off Korda. He struck her as the arrogant kind who compensated for weakness with meanness. His type would deliberately downgrade others, particularly a woman near the top of her class. She shifted uncomfortably.\n\nYou’ve heard of the Federacy’s starbred forces, Korda continued. ‘Sentinels,’ they call the trained ones. As officers, you’ll be more likely to encounter them than your blazer-bait subordinates will. By the way, you won’t find a more self-righteous, exclusive group if you see half the Federacy—not that it trusts them. Common people fear what they can’t control.\n\nOne student protested, But aren’t you—\n\nKorda waved a hand, dismissing the objection. Yes. I’m Thyrian, and starbred. But I’m no Sentinel. No one tells me how to control my abilities.\n\nFirebird went rigid. If Korda had such abilities, had he influenced the dangerous decision to attack Veroh? Could he have gone to some of the electors, even to Phoena, and convinced them to try this?\n\nShe frowned. Maybe he’d pushed an elector or two. But Phoena’s proposal to take Veroh, and Siwann’s endorsement, fit their lifelong, belligerent pattern—\n\nSiwann. A tiny time-light blinked on her wristband. Fourteen hundred. She could relax; there was plenty of day left. Vultor Korda launched into a rambling tale of his testing and training under Master Sentinels, then their history.\n\nThen the briefing room went dark. Korda pressed a chip stack into the blocky media unit at midboard and then faced the class. My topic is Sentinels in military intelligence. If you think you see one of these people, in battle or otherwise, shoot first and make sure of your target after he’s dead. Assume you won’t get off a second shot. Some of them can levitate your side weapon from the holster.\n\nFirebird’s memory served up a year-old image of the electoral chamber. She hadn’t seen any levitating, but she’d certainly suspected that Thyrian guard.\n\nA life-size holographic image appeared over the media block. Rotating slowly, it portrayed a handsome black-haired woman who apparently stood taller than half the men in Firebird’s cadet class. This is Captain Ellet Kinsman. She’s stationed at Caroli—which governs Veroh, by the way—and rising fast in the ranks. We rate the starbred on the Ehretan Scale according to how strongly they’ve inherited the altered genes. We’re all mixed-blood now, but Kinsman comes from a strong family. She’s seventy-five Ehretan Scale out of a rough hundred, which means she can do over half the tricks the original Ehretans could’ve. You don’t want to get near a person like that. Fortunately, you probably won’t encounter Kinsman. She processes information that others collect. Desk worker, but still dangerous. Memorize the face, if you have enough room in your memory.\n\nFirebird was already memorizing. The woman resembled her first flight trainer, high in the forehead with a long, aquiline nose. Kinsman’s uniform, vividly blue-black with no insignia except a gold shoulder star with four beveled rays, fit Firebird’s recollection . . . almost. Something had been different.\n\nThe image blurred and vanished. Next appeared a man, older, also black-haired. Admiral Blair Kinsman is her cousin. Based on Varga. The throwback of the family, about a twenty-five Ehretan Scale. I think he can nudge a few electrons along a wire, if it’s early in the day.\n\nDistracted, Firebird missed several sentences. So they had different skill levels. Where did that put last year’s alleged honor guard? She’d finally guessed how he had spotted her. She must’ve sent off a blast of dismay when she realized just what he was—\n\nNow, this is trouble. The admiral disappeared in a cloud of static. A younger man’s figure materialized in his place, and Firebird gaped. This was the guard! In the chamber, she’d had no time to stare. She stared now. Average height, not overly muscled, with hair that was the light russet brown of exotic leta wood. This image’s eyes were lost in shadow, but she hadn’t forgotten that ice-blue stare.\n\nThis is Wing Colonel Brennen Caldwell, Korda announced. He’s stationed at Regional Headquarters, Tallis, but as a member of the Special Operations force—Korda scratched the initials SO onto the teaching board—he has no permanent base. Don’t even get close enough to recognize him. He scored an ES ninety-seven, and they haven’t had one so high in a hundred years. See the master’s star on his shoulder? Eight points, not four.\n\nShe nodded. That was the difference.\n\nSupposedly, Caldwell’s the first strong-family Sentinel the Federacy has considered for real rank. Military Sentinels pretend they don’t want authority, but the situation is more complex than that. Remember our violent history. Korda paused. The Federacy uses us, but it’s afraid of us. Anyway, Special Ops rotate between fleet and special assignments, so they only serve part of the time with a regular unit.\n\nThey’d sent a Special Ops officer here, with a trade delegation? In that case, she and the electors had badly underestimated its importance. There’d been a highly skilled telepath in the heart of the Netaian government that day. A shudder flickered down her spine. She wondered what kind of data he’d taken back to Regional HQ, Tallis.\n\nHe’s cute, Lady Delia Stele whispered to no one in particular.\n\nNot cute, Firebird thought, but compelling—\n\nKorda flung out both arms. If that’s all you think about, Stele, get out of here. Out! My time is valuable, and I won’t waste it on giggly wastlings that anybody can play with but no one will ever marry.\n\nDelia’s face, so prettily circled in blond hair, was a study in humiliation. Other cadets glared. Firebird angrily rose halfway out of her seat.\n\nKorda brought up the lights and swung his arms again. Go ahead, hate me. I can feel it. But I’ll be alive next year and most of you will be dead. I only had an hour today, and it’s up. But come back tomorrow and I’ll show you some things that could give you another week or two. He dove for the exit.\n\nWhen Firebird saw that Delia was being consoled by several girls (and, Powers bless him, Corey’s twin brother Daley), she slipped out into the passway and headed for the parking garage and her skimmer. For all his sliminess, Vultor Korda had given her a good deal to think about. It roiled in her mind during dinner, which she took alone in her suite.\n\nTelepaths, here. Then and now. What did Korda do when he wasn’t teaching? Had the Federacy suspected, over a year ago, that Netaia was moving toward a military invasion? If so, what kind of hair-trigger watch were they keeping on the Netaian systems?\n\nShe would mention that to one of the marshals.\n\nAfter calling her personal girl to remove her leavings, she retreated from her parlor to her music room. A long triangular case lay on her carpet below the studio’s window. Carefully she drew out her clairsa.\n\nA master-maker’s work, its long leta-wood arches had been carved with a pattern of linked knots. Twenty-two metal strings reflected the dying daylight to shine brassy red through her hair’s dangling strands.\n\nShe spent the hour that remained before her interview cradling it, seated on a low stool with her transcriber running. She was writing a song, one that might be her last.\n\nAlmost ninety years before, another queen’s wastling had survived to mount the throne. Lady Iarla had set a standard Firebird hoped to match. Manifesting all nine of the holy Powers—Strength, Valor, and Excellence; Knowledge, Fidelity, and Resolve; Authority, Indomitability, and Pride—but also a remarkable compassion, Iarla was a respected figure in Netaia’s recent history. The melody Firebird had composed for this ballad was musically solid, and the chords stirred her longings even on a hundredth run-through, but words just wouldn’t come. She’d hoped to pass this song on to her friends in downside Citangelo before she left for the invasion.\n\nThen again, there’d been a time when she secretly hoped to repeat her great-great-grandmother Iarla’s climb to glory. As Carradee’s second confinement approached, Firebird had abandoned that hope—but just as a few defiant tunes kept the Coper Rebellion alive, Iarla’s name couldn’t die as long as someone sang it to honor her.\n\nAfter four attempts to rhyme a second stanza, Firebird gave up in disgust and ordered the transcriber to shut itself off. She returned the clairsa to its soft case before changing into a fresh Academy uniform.\n\nFlecks of dust had settled on her ornate bedroom bureau. She needed to call Dunna back in to give the suite a good cleaning. Slowly she turned around as if seeing her marble walls and costly furnishings for the first time. Bunking in a cramped Academy dorm had changed her perspective. These elegant rooms had been Iarla’s, too. That had always been a point of pride to Firebird. To be Angelo was to be proud.\n\nWith dignity that masked her apprehension, she swung down the curved staircase and across an echoing foyer toward the queen’s night office.\n\nSiwann had made this appointment weeks ago, which didn’t suggest a matter of personal warmth. Loving moments between them had been rare, not that Firebird expected warmth from her mother. No parent could invest her emotions in a wastling child. It was safer to let servitors raise them and redjackets train them.\n\nFor two centuries, wastlings had provided Netaia with some of its most notorious daredevil entertainers and naval pilots. Some were heroes in history scanbooks, but unless an older sibling’s tragedy elevated them to heir status, none lived past their early twenties. Any who recanted allegiance to the holy Powers and refused their geis orders disappeared, or had fatal accidents like Lord Rendy Gellison. Firebird wondered sometimes if some who’d vanished had fled the Netaian systems and begun new lives elsewhere. She knew one who’d made the attempt. She had helped. Naturally, she never heard from him, nor from the high-common-class woman who went with him, but she thought of them occasionally. Had the redjackets found and killed them after Firebird and Corey reported them dead in space, or had they vanished effectively enough?\n\nHer role in the plot nagged her conscience. Aiding their flight had been her one deliberate breach of the rigid, sacred Disciplines. If those holy Powers truly judged the dead, she had doomed herself to linger in the Dark that Cleanses, a purging place where disobedience would be burned from her soul . . . unless the Electorate ordered her to sacrifice herself for Netaia’s benefit and glory.\n\nAs it would.\n\nStill, she’d enlisted willingly. A soldier’s death would cancel all her infractions. She only wished she were bound for a war in which she could give herself gladly, instead of this raid to help set up Phoena’s despicable secret project. Rumor made it an environmental weapon that could poison whole regions of a targeted world.\n\nA house guard admitted her. At the night office’s center stood a crystalline globe, grown at zero-g into an incredible likeness of her home world and lit from inside by a white everburner, but Firebird had passed it so many times that it had lost its power to impress her. Beyond it, Siwann sat as stiffly as her bust in the Hall of Queens, erect in a flawlessly tailored black suit. One hand swept a platinum stylus along her desk’s inset scribing pad. Siwann had been striking in her day and was rarely caricatured, even by her enemies, except for her lofty haughtiness.\n\nShe looked up. Sit. I’ll be with you.\n\nFirebird complied with her usual twinge of awe. Her Majesty’s antique wooden desk loomed in front of a window draped with shadowy curtains, creating the illusion of tiers of red wings. Gilt-lettered ancient volumes, bound with animal skins, stood in dignified rows along two walls over files of chip stacks, data rods, and scan cartridges. Firebird occupied her waiting time trying to second-guess the Electorate. Would Netaia be preparing to invade Veroh for its unique minerals if the electors had ratified that trade agreement last year? Metal and mineral production and trade, like most Netaian industries, were regulated by electoral underlings. Surely, if Phoena wanted basium, she could have bought it from the Federacy, if Rogonin’s cartel hadn’t kept offworld trade strictly illegal.\n\nSiwann switched off her scribing pad at last, then took a white envelope from a drawer and flicked its corner. Firebird, we have something for you.\n\nYes, Your Majesty? Firebird leaned forward carefully in the massive chair, keeping her posture correct. A graduation gift from Siwann? Unlikely, but possible.\n\nYou will be commissioned next month. Assuming, of course, that you complete your classes.\n\nThat’s right. She hoped her mother was joking, or maybe the queen didn’t follow her wastling’s academic career with the same interest she’d shown in Carradee and Phoena. Firebird, already guaranteed an honorary captaincy as a wastling, had pushed that to a first major’s commission with her class and flight evaluations. Top marks on Korda’s seminar would win her a special commendation, too. She meant to try for it.\n\nYou’re aware that you then will be a first major.\n\nYes. Siwann knew! Firebird felt the skin around her eyes wrinkle with smile lines. My flight trainer tells me I’ll be assigned to Raptor Phalanx with a flight team of my own choosing.\n\nWe’re glad it makes you happy, Firebird. That makes it easier for us to give you this, as the Disciplines demand. She handed the envelope across her desktop. Firebird fingered it open and found a white paper packet. Anyone in a combat situation risks capture, her mother said. As a first major, you could be a candidate for a particularly thorough interrogation. Think what that would mean to Netaia. She ticked off details on her fingers as if summing up a criminal case; and Netaia’s penal system, like its state religion, made few allowances for mercy. You have been privy to the electoral council for nearly a year. There is your Academy education. Your knowledge of Angelo properties. Military facilities. Defense procedures.\n\nStricken, Firebird slipped the small packet back into the envelope and let it drop into her lap. She’d held death on the desktop. Her fingertips tingled. This is poison?\n\nYou will keep it with you at all times, beginning here and now. For your sake, we hope that you will go out with the navy and finish your days in some exciting episode. We would be proud to see you named in Derwynn’s new history series. But if ever it becomes obvious that you cannot avoid being taken prisoner, then your Resolve to use this may be the most important weapon you have carried into battle. She emphasized Resolve, one of the Powers, with regal deliberation and then dropped her habitual royal plural. Must I make myself clear, Firebird?\n\nNot your orders, Majesty. But—\n\nCaptain Friel assures me you keep all of the Disciplines and the Charities, and I am glad. Besides guarding your place in history, the Powers will welcome you gloriously into true bliss if you keep this last obligation.\n\nSwallowing a uneasy feeling of guilt, Firebird bowed her head. She’d irrevocably broken the Disciplines, helping Jisha and Alef escape. I understand, she murmured. But tell me what this is. How it will . . . kill.\n\nThe vernacular is Somnus. Siwann slipped back into the lofty voice that she used at weekly electoral Obediences, when she read from the Disciplines. It suppresses the involuntary nervous system. Taken orally, it will induce unconsciousness in about five minutes, irreparable brain damage in about fifteen, and finalize in twenty, without discomfort. Your Aunt Firebird took it when Carradee was born, as did our mother the queen when we were ready to rule.\n\nFirebird nodded slightly. Such was the duty of a Netaian queen, and she knew about her namesake. The elder Lady Firebird hadn’t even waited for the Electorate to issue her geis, but had gone to her suite, eaten a slice of her favorite cream pie, and then poisoned herself as soon as baby Carradee was declared normal and healthy.\n\nCarradee’s first little daughter was normal and healthy, too. Firebird loved her as much as she envied her. Princess Iarlet, now three years old, was a beautiful, flirtatious firstborn.\n\nFirebird tucked the packet into her breast pocket. I shouldn’t need this, madam. I intend to have the fastest striking team in the Planetary Navy.\n\nFine words for a pacifist.\n\nDidn’t Siwann understand? Firebird would never slaughter civilians, but she longed for fame and glory—to let Strength, Valor, and Excellence shine in her actions. I’ll go, Majesty. Firebird rested her hands on her knees. I know what my orders will be. Just see that they put us on a military target run, not a civilian one, and I swear I’ll do my best for you.\n\nYes. You will. Siwann’s posture softened infinitesimally. You always do, don’t you?\n\nGrateful for the crumb of royal recognition, Firebird nodded. Thank you, Mother.\n\nAbruptly Siwann pushed back her chair and stood. Little Firebird. Come here.\n\nFirebird stood up, unsure of her mother’s intentions. Majesty?\n\nHere. The queen flicked her hands. Come to me. Hesitantly, Firebird made the circuit of the massive desk into Siwann’s outstretched arms. Only when she was not ordered away did she return the embrace.\n\nMy baby, Siwann crooned. My bright baby.\n\nThey swayed back and forth, Firebird holding tightly with painfully stiff shoulders. She didn’t know how to react. This outpouring of sentiment made her feel guilty, as if she were taking something from Siwann that rightfully belonged to Carradee and Phoena.\n\nJust as suddenly and inexplicably as she’d called her close, Siwann pulled away. She flicked both hands. Firebird was dismissed.\n\n2\n\nCorey\n\naffetuoso\n\nwith warmth\n\nThe empty foyer lay quiet. As Firebird hurried out of her mother’s office, a puff of warm air danced through monolithic doors from the colonnade. She accepted its silent invitation and walked out into a clear summer evening.\n\nShe wandered downhill, numbing her dismay with the fragrance of formal flower gardens and a breeze that rustled long, glossy leaves on the drooping fayya trees. Where her path crossed a bridge over an inlet of the second reflecting pool, she stopped and leaned over a railing to throw path pebbles at goggle-eyed skitters. The palace gleamed white, columns and porticoes of semiprecious stone coolly reflecting soft garden illumination. She tossed a pebble idly. Two green-gold fish flitted forward to nip at the sinking stone. The tiny packet that would probably kill her felt heavy and huge in her slim breast pocket.\n\nShe’d lived well, she reminded herself. This year, training at the Academy, she’d traveled the solar reach and visited Netaia’s buffer systems. She’d had good friends, both noble and common, including some of the best musicians in all three systems. Plop! went another pebble. Carradee had been especially gracious. Although besieged by her suitors, Carradee had put off marriage longer than anyone would have expected, had even given Firebird a kind of posterity by naming her firstborn for Iarla, the queen Firebird admired. When Iarlet had been born, Netaia had rejoiced, but dread had settled in Firebird’s heart. Soon, another little princess would push her down the succession to the deadly fifth position, and the geis order would come.\n\nThough it couldn’t be said out loud, Firebird believed she would have made a more capable monarch than either Carradee or Phoena. She desperately hoped Netaia would remember her that way, and for the courage . . . the Indomitability . . . with which she faced her fate. Plop!\n\nShe truly was proud to be an Angelo. Three hundred years ago, Netaia had thrown off an invasion from outsystem. Declaring martial law and banding together under the Angelos—who declared themselves limited monarchs—the ten noble families restored order from anarchy and industry out of planetwide devastation, and they elevated reverence for the Powers to an official state religion. The invasion was history, but just as Netaia’s distrust of offworlders never ended, neither had the aristocracy’s religiously and judicially enforced stranglehold on its people. Loyalty to the state, and to its noble electors, remained every Netaian’s highest duty. That system concentrated vast wealth where it could best be wielded to preserve independence.\n\nPlip! Another pebble disappeared in murky water.\n\nPhoena could marry next. She could have no children, but she would be spared. Firebird bristled, recalling her sister’s cruel words over breakfast, and looked skyward.\n\nThat bright yellow-orange light was Veroh, target of the pending invasion. Veroh’s proximity, and its orientation ninety degrees from Netaia’s two buffer systems, made its conquest a logical step in expansion. But though the regime intended to occupy and hold Veroh, its immediate goal was Veroh’s basium ore, which the Electorate wanted for the research of Dr. Nella Cleary.\n\nCleary had come from Veroh, offering talents in strategic ordnance research in return for absolute secrecy—and a price. In personally meeting it, Phoena startled many electors by exercising a royal prerogative with Siwann’s blessing, and made Cleary the wealthiest commoner on Netaia. Cleary’s project would require quantities of basium, a heavy-metal compound mined nowhere in the Netaian systems. Basium had few industrial uses and barely supported Cleary’s mining family, but Cleary had developed a way to give it strategic value. If Siwann and Phoena had their way, Netaia would never again need to lower itself by negotiating with the Federacy. Plip!\n\nFortunately, Veroh stood almost as far toward the tip of the largely Federate Whorl as Netaia itself, hopefully too far for a strong military defense to be economically feasible—plop—so hoped the Netaian marshals. Plunk! According to recent intelligence, the Veroh system had only a small self-defense installation and ten support depots. The Federacy was obviously lax. If enough basium concentrate could be seized, the mission would be declared successful, but they would try for conquest. Netaia must grow or stagnate. The invasion would be under way ten days after commissioning.\n\nFirebird would probably die there. And then?\n\nShe stared into the murky water. She’d pondered the written Disciplines for years, but they were vague on the subject of life after death. She had no trouble imagining the terrible purging that might claw her spirit as she served her allotted years in the Dark that Cleanses. She’d probably imagined it too many times. But she’d never adequately imagined bliss, the state of utter joy that she hoped was her ultimate destiny.\n\nShe found the Powers themselves hard to imagine, too. Named by an ancient Netaian religion, these nine qualities supposedly enabled the nobles to rule. They existed beyond any person or persons, though, and so she’d been taught that they could be addressed as gods. They were actually more real than gods, because they were visible. They showed themselves in electors’ lives. Their written Disciplines demanded acts of obedience and charity, but as Firebird understood them, the Powers were nothing like . . . persons.\n\nIf they existed.\n\nAt least it was allowed to have doubts, so long as she never mentioned them. Posterity and the Powers would judge her by all she accomplished, not by the depth of her certainty. They demanded obedience, not faith. If Firebird believed in anything, she believed in Netaia and its people. All of them—noble, common, and even the servitors. For them, she was willing to sacrifice herself.\n\nThen what if the Powers didn’t exist?\n\nShe fingered her pebbles uncomfortably. Then when she died, she would be dead. At least she would never see Phoena again.\n\nShe flung a pebble as hard as she could. It bounced off the lawn on the pool’s far side.\n\nWest of Veroh, the Whorl stars became thicker. Dimmer, more distant than Veroh, gleamed a yellowish spark: Tallis. On Tallis IV, a planet she would never see, the Federacy had established a Regional capital. Nine major civilizations, in two Whorl regions rich with G-spectrum stars, lay under covenance to the Federacy.\n\nIndependence made the Netaian rulers proud. Too proud, maybe.\n\nProud enough to attack Veroh, only a protectorate of Federate Caroli, but the treaty ties were there. Firebird hoped the Federacy would let Veroh slip into Netaian hands.\n\nOr did she?\n\nShe glanced east. Netaia’s second smallest moon, Delaira, crept slowly up over the treetops. Tiny Menarri would soon follow, chasing Delaira in the orbit they shared, sometimes approaching, sometimes dropping back, but never overtaking its larger, sparkling sister.\n\nFirebird felt that way, following Phoena forever, doomed by her birth order.\n\nSplat! went the rest of her pebbles into the water. She climbed the green lawn between drooping fayya and majestic leta trees and stepped up onto the colonnade. Between high white walls and fluted columns, a sentry paused on his rounds. She returned his salute, then went in to bed.\n\n• • •\n\nVultor Korda made the following day’s extended session intensely practical. After displaying several more holograms, he shut off the media block and said, The Sentinels have developed a technique you need to experience. It gives them a critical edge in intelligence gathering. They call it mind-access interrogation.\n\nOut the corner of her eye, Firebird saw Corey scribble on his recall pad.\n\n\"It doesn’t damage the subject the way psychophysical methods can do, but it’s more effective. A Sentinel can send something they call an epsilon carrier wave inside your mind’s alpha matrix, where your thoughts and your feelings arise. He can find out anything you know, if he has enough strength and can plant a relevant suggestion.\n\nTo resist, you must concentrate on something totally irrelevant—your boot heels, or maybe your girl friend. Then you have to hold on like grim death when your mind starts to wander. Because it will. Someone else is trying to direct your thinking. Let’s show how it’s done, Angelo.\n\nFirebird stiffened. The idea of linking minds, with Vultor Korda or anyone else, repelled her. But she couldn’t escape without being cited for disobeying an instructor.\n\nKorda sank onto Corey’s desktop. With a slim white hand, he turned Firebird’s chin toward him. Don’t be scared, Angelo. That gives me a headache. Look at my eyes. I’m going to be trying to find out your favorite color.\n\nShe blinked at him. His eyes were totally irrelevant brown. The sensation started subtly, like pre-nausea prickles at the back of her throat, and then she felt the essence of another person approach, deep beneath her external senses, on a level of awareness she’d never known existed. That other’s presence struck her like a stale odor or a string out of tune: It was wrong.\n\nColors, he whispered.\n\nSuddenly she was panicking, and she saw her best clothes, all crimson.\n\nThat was easy. Red, isn’t it? You’ll have to be quicker, Angelo. Can you do better, Parkai?\n\nAs he moved on to other cadets, demonstrating and berating, Firebird’s hand crept toward the deadly packet in her breast pocket. Why should I bother to try? she wondered. If I were captured, I’d be unconscious before anybody could touch me. But she coveted that commendation. One day, it would be part of her legend, her own . . . short . . . ballad. She scrutinized each demonstration, scheming how to resist better than anyone else.\n\nIn the afternoon, he came back to her. All right, Red Bird. What’s your middle name?\n\nStaring boldly at his eyes, she limited her awareness to a horrendously tricky passage from a clairsa etude she’d recently memorized. Notes danced in her mind as the prickly wave smacked her and ebbed away. Minor chord . . . it had three accidentals . . . descending run . . . arpeggio, two octaves . . .\n\nThe wave fell again with more force, and the distasteful otherness cracked her concentration. Elsbeth, Korda exclaimed. Firebird opened her eyes to see him backing toward Corey with an odd look in his eye. Thought you were doing well, didn’t you?\n\nThat is the idea, though? she asked. Or did I do something wrong?\n\nKorda ducked his chin and frowned, studying her. No, nothing wrong. That’s a fair start. We’ll try advanced techniques later. He turned to Leita Parkai and said, Your turn.\n\n• • •\n\nTwo weeks later, on the day after commissioning, the Netaian Planetary Navy held its traditional officers’ ball. With the final flurry of Academy graduation finished and her commendation won despite Vultor Korda’s badgering, Firebird intended to dance. She’d let the palace tresser tame her auburn mane into a ladylike coif, smooth to the crown with the back curled stylus-tight, and then she’d carefully pinned two new ruby rank stars onto the collar of her cobalt blue dress blouse. The marquis-cut stones framed her throat with glimmering light. Her regulation dress shoes concealed a little sharpened stick she’d tucked into her instep, for the sake of an old game. Maybe she could catch Corey off guard one more time, later on.\n\nNursing a goblet of wine punch and stopping at each group of partygoers, she worked her way down the main ballroom’s black marble floor. Tonight the long crimson window curtains were overhung in cobalt blue, and most of the formal furniture and statuary had been moved into storage to make room for dancers. At its far end, a small orchestra filled the dais. Liveried servitors wandered through the crowd dispensing wines, sweets, and steaming, spicy cruinn.\n\nBefore she could dance with Corey, she would have to pay her respects to each of the other electors, the marshals, and nearly all her superior officers, all the while watching for heirs with hazing on their minds. Two of her friends had developed ugly, mysterious red blotches on face and throat after talking with Phoena. If those swollen weals felt as nasty as they looked, they would make the uniform’s snug collar feel like a garrote.\n\nMajor—she was a major now, a career-grade officer! Her fingers stole up to touch one rank star, to assure herself it was real. The music rejoiced with her, a sweep of strings and brass that sang in delight. Dreamily she gazed out over the dance floor and caught sight of Phoena in the arms of a tall, black-haired new officer.\n\nCorey! Firebird halted in midstep. Phoena’s hand rested lazily on Corey’s shoulder, and she wore a saccharine smile. In Corey’s expression Firebird read resigned patience.\n\nA tall couple swept between Firebird and Corey. By the time she caught sight of him again, the dance set had ended. She rushed forward, seized his arm, and pulled him into a crowded corner.\n\nIn his fresh haircut, Corey seemed impossibly tall and broad-shouldered. Firebird jostled him deeper into the noisy mass. Did Phoena do anything odd? Quick!\n\nHe shrugged. She was friendly. That’s about as odd as your sister can get.\n\nA passing group drove them closer to the wall, and Firebird guarded her sloshing cup. What did she do?\n\nHe shrugged and wrinkled his freckled face. She commented on my haircut—she and everyone else—but she actually played with it.\n\nSeizing Corey’s shoulders, Firebird worked around behind him and pulled him down low enough to examine the base of his neck.\n\nA cloth square, almost invisible against his skin, clung just below his hairline. Firebird tore it off and dropped it on the floor.\n\nRubbing the bared spot, Corey turned around to her. Skin patch?\n\nAbsolutely. That’s what got Daley and Tor. You may be fine if we got it off in time, but—\n\nI will be fine, Firebird. She wouldn’t dare debilitate commissioned officers. Corey’s black eyes brimmed with mischief. Too bad you wasted it. I’d like to see your sister in spots. I wonder what she’s saving for you.\n\nSo do I. Firebird tapped a foot. And I wonder where she’s carrying them. Surely not next to her skin.\n\nThey’d been working sideways out of the congested area. Firebird broke free, pulling Corey along by his hand. Watch her if you can. I have to make about six more duty calls.\n\nHe leaned down and kissed her cheek. Good luck, Major. And thanks.\n\nShe gave him a quick thumbs-up and then recollected her dignity.\n\nDevair Burkenhamn, the navy’s massive first marshal, stood alone a few meters away, nibbling a pastry and watching the richly dressed dancers. He’d been her strategies instructor, hard but fair, a high-common-class officer who treated noble wastlings precisely like the other cadets. One of Netaia’s aging few who couldn’t tolerate the implant capsules that preserved an appearance of youth—and which a wastling would never need—he wore a fringe of silver hair around the back of his skull, far above her eye level. He was a huge man, all muscle. Firebird still wondered if they’d redesigned the tagwing fightercraft’s tight cockpit to let him squeeze inside.\n\nSir. She saluted, then raised her goblet toward him. Good evening to you, and my thanks.\n\nHe returned the salute and her smile. Congratulations, Major. Perhaps later you would dance with your marshal.\n\nOf course, sir. Major—he’d said it! She sipped her punch to keep from grinning foolishly. I have worked for yesterday for so long, I’m astounded to find myself on the other side of it.\n\nHe nodded, looking venerable. Your mother. Give her my respects.\n\nI will, sir. And my regards to your family. Small talk. She hated it. She wanted to ask, Have you accepted my flight-team list? But tonight wasn’t the time.\n\nFrom behind the marshal’s bulk, Phoena stepped up. She tapped his elbow. I’m glad to have caught you together. Firebird. Phoena nodded a mannerly greeting. Her spectacularly interwoven hair and kaleidocolor gown didn’t distract Firebird from the narrowing of her eyes that typically presaged some new cruelty.\n\nIt might be nothing, Firebird reminded herself. Get it over with, Phoena.\n\nBurkenhamn bowed from the waist. Your Highness, ever your servant.\n\nAh, Phoena said, and the bodice of her gown expanded. Body heat, Firebird knew, created the chromatic changes in the fabric—golds, greens and intense shades of pink. Thank you. I have a bothersome problem. She traced saffron colorbursts on a sleeve with one fingertip.
