Working name of US author Kathleen Moore Tyers (1952- ). She began writing with her Firebird sequence, Firebird (1987; rev 1999) and Fusion Fire (1988; rev 2000), set in a Planetary Romance venue replete with colourful planetary cultures, a matriarchy suffering internecine dynastic conflicts, an overarching Federation, space Invasions, palace politics and the discovery of budding Psi Powers in the eponymous protagonist, a princess on a bad planet who is in love with a Federation Telepath of great renown. Her route to psionic maturity and marital happiness with him is depicted with cluttered vigour. These volumes were revised to emphasize Christian values, and all subsequent volumes were written within that remit; they include Crown of Fire (2000), assembled with the revised versions of the first two as Firebird Trilogy (omni 2000; further rev 2011), plus Wind and Shadow and Daystar (2012).

In Crystal Witness (1989) a female criminal, exiled to another world, must come triumphantly to terms with her new circumstances. In Shivering World (1991; rev 2004) yet another arrival into an alien world must deal with the Terraforming problems of some settlers. One Mind's Eye (1996) is again a Space Opera, though it begins in Virtual Reality, from which the heroine is plucked. Star Wars: The Truce at Bakura (1994) and Star Wars: New Jedi Order: Balance Point (2000) are Ties to the Star Wars universe. [JC]
