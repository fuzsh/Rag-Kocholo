Distributor Worldvision Enterprises Release Original network ABC Original release November 8, 1980 ( ) – December 18, 1982 (1982-12-18) Chronology Preceded by Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1979–80) Followed by The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show / The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries (1983–84)

The Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo shorts represents the fifth incarnation of the Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning cartoon Scooby-Doo series.

The original format of four teenagers and their dog(s) solving faux-supernatural mysteries for a half-hour was eschewed for simpler, more comedic adventures that involved real supernatural villains (the villains in previous Scooby episodes were almost always regular humans in disguise).

A total of 33 half-hour episodes, each of which included three 7-minute shorts, were produced over three seasons, from 1980 to 1982 on ABC. Thirteen episodes were produced for the 1980–81 season, and seven more for the 1981–82 as segments of The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show. The remaining thirteen episodes were produced as segments of The Scooby & Scrappy-Doo/Puppy Hour for the 1982–83 season. Out of the 99 shorts that were produced, 86 of them feature Scooby-Doo, his nephew Scrappy-Doo and Shaggy without the rest of the Mystery Inc gang, and the other 13 only feature Scrappy-Doo and Yabba-Doo.
