        "text": "This my main blog. I mainly discuss economics issues and higher ed issues, with a special emphasis on open learning. The day job is teaching economics at Lansing Community College, where I spend my time trying to translate economic theory into plain language for students and make sense of economic events. However, the thoughts on this site are my own and do not represent the thinking or positions of Lansing Community College, its administration, students, or faculty. This is just my thoughts and insights. Everybody is welcome, not just students.\n\nEconproph on Edumasto.org"
