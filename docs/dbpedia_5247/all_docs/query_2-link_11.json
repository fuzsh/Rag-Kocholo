        "text": "This article is about the original incarnation of Scooby-Doo. For other incarnations and uses, see Scooby-Doo (disambiguation).\n\n“ Well, nothing's impossible when you've got Scooby-Doo around. ”\n\n—Daphne Blake, Scooby-Doo! and the Loch Ness Monster\n\nScoobert[1] \"Scooby\" Doo[Note 1] is the Great Dane mascot of Mystery Inc., and pet and best friend of Shaggy Rogers.\n\nQuick Answers\n\nWho is Scooby-Doo?\n\nScooby-Doo, also known as Scoobert \"Scooby\" Doo, is the eponymous iconic character from the Hanna-Barbera franchise. He is a Great Dane and the mascot of Mystery Inc., the team that solves mysteries using Scooby to sniff out clues.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat is Scooby-Doo's legal name?\n\nScoobert Doo is Scooby-Doo's legal and full name.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhen did Scooby-Doo debut?\n\nScooby-Doo debuted in 1969 as the star of the series Scooby Doo Where Are You!.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nPhysical appearance\n\nFor a full list of what Scooby wears, see Scooby-Doo's outfits and disguises\n\nScooby is brown from head to toe with several distinctive black spots on his upper body. He is generally a quadruped, but displays bipedal 'human' characteristics occasionally. Scooby also has opposible thumbs and can use his front paws like hands. He has a black nose and wears an off-yellow, diamond shaped-tagged blue-green collar with an \"SD\" (his initials) and has four toes on each foot and unlike other dogs, Scooby only has one pad on the sole of each of his feet.\n\nPersonality\n\nScooby-Doo and Shaggy share several personality traits, mostly being constantly hungry, being scared easily and most of the time refuse to help others, but their friends (Velma Dinkley, Daphne Blake and Fred Jones) encourage them to go after the costumed villains usually with \"Scooby Snacks\", a biscuit-like dog treat or cookie snack (usually shaped like a bone or as shown in later versions of the cartoons Scooby's dog tag), though occasionally appealing to Scooby-Doo inherent loyalty and courage to take a more heroic stance.\n\nHis catch phrase, usually howled at the end of every mystery, is \"Scooby-Dooby-Doo!\" or \"Rooby-Rooby-Roo\", sometimes followed by a quirky chuckle.\n\nHe enjoys a lot of attention and would sometimes appear brave and heroic.\n\nHe also doesn't like being upstaged when someone does better than him and would try to prove otherwise.\n\nHe has a rather mischievous side as he frequently pulls scare pranks and would snatch food from Shaggy.\n\nWhen he solves cases with his nephew Scrappy-Doo, he's very protective of him, as he often runs after him to prevent him from going straight to the monster or ghost.\n\nPower and abilities\n\nHe has peculiar and extraordinary abilities, such as being able to talk in English, although not without pronouncing most words as if they begin with an \"R\", though most people are able to understand him perfectly (if they acknowledge that he can speak at all). He can also talk to other animals (mostly dogs), which comes in handy whenever the gang needs help or more information.\n\nHe can stand on his hind legs, which he gradually does more often as the years have gone by. Dealing with Scrappy, would get him on his hind legs a lot, when he wanted to keep himself and Scrappy away from a monster.\n\nHe can also morph his body to mimic any and all monsters he has encountered, along with some humans, too. His tail is prehensile, being used to get him out of certain situations, if need be.\n\nHe also has a great sense of balance, as he can ride on a unicycle while juggling and balancing a fishbowl on his head.\n\nHe's shown to be a master dancer, as he got a perfect score on the WWE's victory dance, and avoided Kane's attacks.\n\nWhen he was a puppy, Scooby Snacks would make him blast off like a rocket, before gliding gently back down to earth.\n\nLike many dogs he has an incredible sense of smell, earning his nose the nickname \"Super Sniffer\".\n\nHe has a fully prehensile tail he can use to swing from or press buttons. Both his head and tail are malleable and useful as a communication aid or creating a distraction. But his tail often gives him away while in disguise.\n\nHe can stretch out his tongue to a rather impossible length.\n\nHe had amazing video game skill when he was a pup and referred to by Shaggy as the Video Champ of Coolsville.\n\nHistory\n\nAnimated history\n\nMain article(s): Scooby-Doo/animated history\n\nComic history\n\nMain article(s): Scooby-Doo/biographical account of comic appearances\n\nNovel history\n\nMain article(s): Scooby-Doo/biographical account of novel appearances\n\nVideo game history\n\nMain article(s): Scooby-Doo/biographical account of video game appearances\n\nFamily and relatives\n\nFor a complete list of Scooby's family members, look here. For other relatives, look here.\n\nRomantic interests\n\nScooby has both noticed and gained the attention of the opposite sex over the years (sometimes, occasionally, even human).\n\nSandy Duncan: Scooby fell for Sandy Duncan at a studio, much to Shaggy's annoyance. (TNSDMovies: Sandy Duncan's Jekyll and Hyde)\n\nScooby-Dee: Scooby and his cousin Scooby-Dum compete for the affections of canine movie star Scooby-Dee, who is also their cousin. (The Scooby-Doo Show: The Chiller Diller Movie Thriller)\n\nSled dog: Scooby falls in love with a sled dog. By the end of the case, she kisses him. (TSDS: A Scary Night With a Snow Beast Fright)\n\nAmber: Shaggy and Scooby are abducted by the \"aliens\", and abandoned in the desert. There they meet a wild life photographer, Crystal and her dog Amber. Scooby was heartbroken when it is revealed that Amber and Crystal are actually aliens from another planet and must go home, though he and Shaggy quickly forget about them when they found out there was one more Scooby Snack box left. Amber and Crystal did seem to have actual feelings for Shaggy and Scooby but don't pursue them due to 'long distance relationships never working out'. Amber's disguised form is that of a Golden Retriever wearing a red bandana while her true form is a large, blue reptilian creature with a beak-like mouth. Like Scooby, she is capable of speech but only shows so as she's about to leave, and unlike Scooby, she speaks like a normal human. (Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders)\n\nChiquita: Scooby meets up with Chiquita, Alejo Otero's son's pet Chihuahua, when the gang arrives at Alejo's family hotel. (Scooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico)\n\nRoxanne: An old girlfriend that Scooby meets again when the gang return to their home town to take a break from mystery solving. In the time apart, she met singer J.C. Chasez's pet bulldog, Rico. (WNSD: A Scooby-Doo Valentine)\n\nShauna; Scooby fell in love with her when the visited the Grand Sandy Resort. He began spending more time with her, making Shaggy sad and jealous. However, when her owner Kiki Brownstone's husband was the Sea monster, she had to leave him to help Kiki raise bail out money. (Scooby-Doo! and the Beach Beastie)\n\nOccupation\n\nScooby has joined Shaggy in taking odd jobs, for extra cash, and other times when he's forced to take an actual profession to support himself when Mystery Inc. decide to take a hiatus, and can't slack off as usual. This is a list of them:\n\nJunior detectives-for-hire: Contrary to the above, when the gang was in their preadolescence, they worked out of a clubhouse, calling themselves the Scooby-Doo Detective Agency, and charged a minimal fee for their services in solving the mysteries in their hometown of Coolsville. (APNSD)\n\nActor: Scooby got the role of Sandy Duncan's dog, after solving the case at Mammoth Studios. (TNSDMovies: Sandy Duncan's Jekyll and Hyde)\n\nCarnival owner: Scooby, along with the rest of the gang, was given a share of Dick Van Dyke's carnival, after saving it from going under. (TNSDMovies: The Haunted Carnival)\n\nConstruction worker: He, Shaggy, and Fred took questionable jobs at a construction site. (TSDS: High Rise Hair Raiser)\n\nFreelance journalist: Scooby, Shaggy, Scrappy, and Daphne became freelance journalists, forming the second incarnation of the Scooby-Doo Detective Agency. (TNS&SDS, TNSDMysteries)\n\nGym teacher: He, Shaggy, and Scrappy were hired as gym teachers at Grimwood's Finishing School for Girls, or so they believed. (Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School)\n\nCo-racecar driver. (Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf)\n\nAiport customs: He and worked in customs at an airport during the break-up of Mystery Inc., but were fired when they ate all the confiscated cheese. (Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island)\n\nDetective: He, Shaggy, and Scrappy worked for Shaggy's uncle Fearless Shagaford at the Fearless Detective Agency. (The Scooby & Scrappy Doo Puppy Hour)\n\nAdditionally, Scooby assisted Shaggy when he was a paper boy, by unloading the delivered papers into his bike's basket. When the gang discovered Shaggy's boss stole his bike chain to work his counterfeiting machine, Shaggy quit, and so did Scooby. (APNSD: A Bicycle Built for Boo!)\n\nNotes/trivia\n\nScooby-Doo was once impersonated by former N'Sync star, J.C. Chasez, in the What's New, Scooby-Doo? episode, A Scooby-Doo Valentine.\n\nHe usually says, at least once per episode, \"Ruh-roh, Raggy\" (\"Uh-oh, Shaggy\").\n\nScooby's voice is similar to that of the earlier character, Astro, from The Jetsons, also voiced by Don Messick.\n\nAppearances in other media\n\nScooby has appeared in Johnny Bravo in the episode 'Twas The Night, voiced by Hadley Kay.\n\nScooby-Doo appeared twice in The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, in the episodes Reap Walking and Keeper of the Reaper, the former was a non-speaking cameo while the latter was voiced by Frank Welker.\n\nScooby-Doo and Shaggy made a cameo appearance in Looney Tunes: Back In Action complaining to Matthew Lillard (who played Shaggy) about his performance in Scooby-Doo: The Movie.\n\nIn an episode of Yin Yang Yo! called Slumber Party of Doom, characters resembling Scooby and Shaggy make a cameo. Watching as if Ying Yang Yo! is a show itself, the Shaggy lookalike complains about Yin and Yang stealing their montages, while they run from zombies, with the Scooby lookalike says, \"It sucks!\"\n\nScooby-Doo was once impersonated by David Beckham in an animated Scooby-Doo promo from the United Kingdom.\n\nScooby-Doo appears in the Robot Chicken episode Operation: Rich in Spirit, voiced by Dave Coulier (who previously imitated Scooby's voice in Full House). He is amongst Mystery Inc. members who end up killed by Jason Voorhees except Velma. Seth Green voices him in the episode \"Ban on the Fun\" when in the segment that parodies the Laff-a-Lympics in the style of the Munich massacre. This time, Scooby did not get killed.\n\nIn an episode of Batman: The Brave and the Bold. This episode alludes to The New Scooby-Doo Movies where Batman originally starred in. However with some meddling from Bat-Mite not only were the dynamic duo able to fight unlike in the original appearance, but he also removed Shaggy and Scooby's cowardice allowing them to, for the first time, fight the villains toe to toe.\n\nScooby and the gang teams up with the Winchesters and Castiel in the Supernatural episode Scoobynatural.\n\nScooby and the gang are forced to take part in Family Feud in the Teen Titans Go! episode Cartoon Feud.\n\nBehind-the-scenes\n\nThe name \"Scooby-Doo\" supposedly comes from the last line of the Frank Sinatra song \"Strangers In The Night\", which CBS' children's programming executive, Fred Silverman, took. However, writer Mark Evanier believes that the name may have come from Randy and the Rainbow's \"Denise\", where as the \"Dooby\" part came from the former.[2] Hanna-Barbera also had an entirely different dog named \"Scooby\" in their archives from the early 1960's.[3]\n\nWhen designing Scooby, Iwao Takamoto learned all the traits of a Great Dane from a colleague who breed them. He then did the complete opposite.\n\nVoices of Scooby-Doo\n\nDon Messick originated the character's voice patterns, and provided Scooby-Doo's voice in every Scooby-Doo production from 1969 until 1996, when Messick got a stroke and retired. Scott Innes (also the then-voice of Shaggy) voiced Scooby-Doo in four late 1990s/early 2000s direct-to-video films, and Frank Welker (also the voice of Fred) took over beginning with What's New, Scooby-Doo? in 2002.\n\nIn other languages\n\nIn Brazil, the actor Orlando Drummond has been the voice of Scooby Doo for over 35 years.\n\nActor Language Notes Sharbal Ayoub Arabic Current Jacques Torrens French Original Willi Roebke German Original Bernd Simon German A Pup Named Scooby-Doo Gábor Vass Hungarian Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo, Scooby Goes Hollywood, Scooby's All Star Laff-a-Lympics, Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers, Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf, The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo, What's New, Scooby-Doo?, Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island, Scooby-Doo!
