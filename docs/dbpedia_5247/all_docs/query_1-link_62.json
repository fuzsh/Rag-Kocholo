        "text": "Most people are familiar with the iconic dog accompanying the gang on their mystery-solving misadventures. It would be hard to forget him, seeing as the show, Scooby-Doo, was named after their iconic canine companion. But what breed of dog is Scooby-Doo? While it was rarely mentioned in the show, the titular dog’s breed was an essential consideration during the show’s production. Scooby-Doo is a Great Dane, and dogs of this breed have a legendary reputation for warding off evil spirits. Thus, this breed was a perfect choice for the show’s writers to include.\n\nWho Is Scooby-Doo?\n\nScooby-Doo’s reputation and notoriety extend far beyond his media appearances. It would be hard to find a Western millennial who isn’t familiar with this famous, fictional pup. Shows revolving around Scooby-Doo are impossible to miss entirely.\n\nAccording to the Scooby-Doo Wikipedia page, there have been 48 Scooby-Doo films, 14 completed Scooby-Doo TV series with a total of 426 episodes, plus one Scooby-Doo spin-off slated for release in 2024. There have also been 15 comic series, 20 video games, and 6 stage plays. Essentially, if you haven’t at least heard of Scooby-Doo, you are probably in the minority.\n\nScooby-Doo’s character contrasts strongly with the Great Dane myth of warding off evil spirits; At the same time, one would expect that such a dog would be fearless in the face of the supernatural; Scooby-Doo is portrayed as a scared-dog who is prone to only temporary bursts of bravery to protect his loved ones.\n\nLike many animated pets, he has limited speech abilities that allow him to interact with both the cast and the viewer with more agency than Blue from Blue’s Clues, whose speech must be translated by the narrator character.\n\nHis signature “Ruh-Roh” speech pattern gives him a feel of humanity while maintaining his canine identity. His character remains a memorable part of the childhoods of many American and European millennials.\n\nGreat Danes: Myths and Fun Facts\n\nWe’ve mentioned that Great Danes were once thought to protect their owners from evil spirits, making them a popular choice for guard dog work, especially for protection during the night. Great Danes weren’t just thought to ward off evil spirits; they were also purported to prevent nightmares, perhaps because their protective natures made their owners comfortable enough to relax at night.\n\nWhile the name “Great Dane” sounds very clear-cut and descriptive, it’s very misleading, as the Great Dane is not Danish at all. The Great Dane hails from Germany, and German dog fanciers prefer the name “Deutsch Dogge” or “German Mastiff” as a moniker for this breed. However, due to increasing tensions between Germany and other countries at the time, the name “Great Dane” caught on and was finalized as the dog’s official title with most kennel clubs.\n\nMany people believe that the Great Dane is the biggest dog breed. It would make sense since several of the world’s biggest dogs were Great Danes. However, the largest dog on average is the English Mastiff, in terms of both height and weight.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Great Dane is one great dog, and with its long and decorated history, it’s no wonder the writers of Scooby-Doo selected this breed for their titular dog. Scooby-Doo’s breed is one more detail that shows that the show’s writers put a lot of love and effort into the show’s story and world-building. We can’t help but appreciate that!\n\nSee also:\n\nWhat Breed of Dog Is Mr. Peabody?
