        "text": "Warner Bros. Discovery has announced its first-ever Scooby-Doo preschool series, Scooby-Doo! And the Mystery Pups.\n\nAnd that news came only days after Mindy Kaling gave an in-person first look at her upcoming HBO Max animated series Velma, the first adult series in the Scoobiverse.\n\nThe two series extend the reach of the Scooby franchise in either direction of its traditional placement as a children’s and family franchise.\n\nHere’s what we know about the two new Scooby shows:\n\nVelma\n\nThe series was ordered by HBO Max for its growing adult animation catalog, and strays far from Scooby-Doo’s family-friendly origins.\n\nVelma proposes to tell the origin story of Velma Dinkley, the brains of the Mystery Inc. bunch. Based on early images and descriptions, it will do so in a more gory and violent way than has previously seen in the franchise.\n\nKaling is executive producing the series along with Charlie Grandy, Howard Klein, and Sam Register.\n\nThe show’s titular protagonist is now of South Asian descent. “Hopefully you noticed my Velma is South Asian,” Kaling told the audience at the upfront. “If people freak out about that, I don’t care.”\n\nKaling, who also voices the titular character, shared a photo (pictured top, right) of Velma in a locker room overseeing a grisly murder scene, providing incontrovertible proof that this prequel series will be more adult than anything in franchise history.\n\nScooby-Doo! And the Mystery Pups"
