        "text": "Remember zoinks, jinkies, and ‘let’s split up, gang’? Yep, we’re talking Scooby-Doo, the iconic TV series that debuted half a century ago. Boy, now I feel old. And you can never trick Scooby’s cult fan base that has been glued to screens for longer than I’ve walked this earth.\n\nSo when this spot-on summary of Scooby-Doo’s evolution resurfaced thanks to one Tumblr user, it left everyone scratching their heads. When the Scooby crew from the years 1969 to 2015 was compared side-by-side, it became obvious. A $3 budget went way further in the ’70s than it goes in 2015.\n\nLet’s take a look at the hilarious overview below. Caution! It’s likely to cause nostalgic feelings for the good ol’ Scooby-Dooby-Doo days with pitch-imperfect animation and spooky one-liners.\n\n1969-1971: Let’s see if we can make a show on a budget of 3 dollars\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: CBS\n\n1972-1973: Hey! We have a real budget now! Let’s use it to hire movie stars to make cameos!\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: CBS\n\n1988-1991: Let’s give parody and quality animation a whirl\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: ABC\n\nScooby-Doo made his debut on September 13, 1969 with the premiere of “Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!” on CBS-TV. It was created by Joe Ruby and Ken Spears for Hanna-Barbera Productions.\n\nThe TV show gained such a cult following, it was translated into 15 different languages. Arabic, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish are among the languages Scooby has “spoken” over the decades.\n\nNow that those meddling kids have turned 50, Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, Daphne, and Velma have entered the universal lexicon. Phrases like “Jinkies!”, “Ruh-roh!”, “Looks like we’ve got another mystery on our hands,” and many more are now unmistakable references in popular culture.\n\n1988-2005: Guys. Guys. Guys. What if… We put actual effort into this?\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: The WB Television Network\n\n2002-2005: That was haaaaaaaaard. Let’s just bank off the previous movies.\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: The WB Television Network\n\n2006-2008: WHAT THE [HELL] IS A SCOOBY\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: The CW Television Network\n\nNo wonder Scooby is one of the most popular animation franchises in the Warner Bros. portfolio for kids and family. “Scooby ranks #2 (just behind Batman) in both familiarity and product ownership with kids 6-12,” said Maryellen Zarakas, senior vice president at Warner Bros.\n\nMark Evanier, who wrote several episodes of Scooby-Doo, said that “there’s something compelling about the format that’s predictable and unpredictable at the same time. Some of them are very clever.” Basically, it has all that a good mystery needs to have but is distilled down to fit a kid’s world.\n\n2010-2013: Let’s reinvent ourselves here. Let’s break the mold. Let’s focus on story lines and character development with less focus on the monster of the week and more focus on an over arching story line\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: Cartoon Network\n\n2015: Let’s see if we can make a show on a budget of 3 dollars\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: Cartoon Network\n\nScooby-Doo’s long-lasting appeal was revived again in a viral #ScoobDance TikTok challenge that racked up a total of more than 1.9 billion views. The challenge was promoted as a part of Warner Bros.’ new release of the animated feature “Scoob!” which is said to debut on May 15th. But due to the coronavirus shutdowns, the film is said to forgo a traditional theatrical release and will hit video-on-demand instead.\n\nThis is what people had to say\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon\n\nShare icon"
