        "text": "During the Halloween season there are plenty of people who want to watch scary movies. But not all scary movies are made for everyone. It's pretty hard to sit a 7-year-old down and show them the Saw franchise, or to have them enjoy something like Event Horizon.\n\nThankfully, we have a franchise like Scooby-Doo that covers the youth when it comes to scary entertainment.\n\nScooby-Doo debuted in 1969 as a cartoon series on TV. The Hanna-Barbara cartoon was a fixture of Saturday morning cartoons. It evolved into multiple different TV series, spanning decades. The franchise also includes over 40 animated films, and 5 live action films. Including two major blockbuster movies released nationwide.\n\nThis isn't even including all of the comic books, toys, and other merchandise that continues to make Scooby-Doo one of the biggest horror franchises on the planet.\n\nYes, horror franchise.\n\nSee, Scooby-Doo is a horror brand. One built for children, but still a horror brand. Just like there is a notable difference in horror movies between something like Silence of the Lambs and House of 1,000 Corpses. The distance between Midsommar and Evil Dead also shows there are different levels in horror. If Terrifier 2 is to one extreme of horror, Scooby-Doo is on the opposite side of the spectrum, with A LOT of horror in-between. But they're all on the horror list.\n\nNow, how about those characters. Which one is Louisiana's favorite?\n\nPart of the success behind the Scooby franchise has been the cast of characters. Not just the way they were created and written, but they way they were played. The voice actors and live action actors really brought them to life, and created a lot of fans.\n\nIn Louisiana, there's one character that stands above the rest, according to some new research.\n\nAfter tearing apart the data, researchers found that Scooby-Doo himself is Louisiana's favorite charecter in the franchise.\n\nScooby is the most popular \"favorite\" character in the country as well, with 19 other states picking him to be their favorite. Second place in the nation was Shaggy, with 11 states picking him. Scrappy-Doo actually came in third, with 6 states picking him. The rest of the crew were pretty far behind. Fred was picked in 4 states, while Daphne and Velma only had two states each. There were actually two states who picked the team's van, The Mystery Machine, over any of the characters (Indiana and Michigan).\n\nOne of the Velma states is actually Louisiana's neighbor Texas. The only other Velma state was Oklahoma.\n\nYou can check out the rest of the research, and their methodology here."
