        "text": "Scooby-Doo has the distinction of being the longest-running cartoon on television. First appearing in 1969, the mystery-solving Great Dane has starred in 310 animated episodes of shows ranging from Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! to Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics to The Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show. But Scooby-Doo has another important distinction. Since his name comes from the refrain \"Scooby-dooby-doo\" from the song \"Strangers in the Night,\" Scooby-Doo is also the only cartoon canine inspired by a Frank Sinatra lyric!\n\nWhen Hanna-Barbera initially pitched the show that would become Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! to CBS, it was a scary cartoon, heavy on haunted houses and monsters, but light on comedy. Also, the four teenagers were the main characters, and their dog merely a supporting player. The CBS executives worried that Mysteries Five or Who's Scared, as it was slated to be called, would be too frightening for children. Bu they still wanted to find a way to make it work. Fred Silverman, then the head of children's programming at CBS, cracked the case wide open when listening to that famous Sinatra record. He reasoned if they called the dog \"Scooby-Doo,\" made him the main character, and made the cartoon a comedy, they would have a hit.\n\nOn Saturday morning, September 13, 1969, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! premiered. Fraidy dog Scooby-Doo (or Scoobert, his formal name) was joined by a team of four teenagers: confident leader Fred, accident-prone Daphne, bookish Velma, and hungry-hungry slacker Shaggy. The five crime-solvers formed the team of Mystery, Inc. Visiting haunted houses, ghost towns, and abandoned amusement parks, the teens investigated sightings of witches, ghosts, and even monsters. Invariably, the \"monster\" would turn out to be a greedy human in disguise, trying to scare away people for his own profit. Of course, the villain would have gotten away with it, if it weren't for those \"meddling kids\"!\n\nThe show's next incarnation, The New Scooby-Doo Movies, saw a slew of high-profile guest stars join the gang to help find clues. Phyllis Diller, Jonathan Winters, Tim Conway, Sonny and Cher, Don Knotts, Dick Van Dyke, and Mama Cass Elliot were among those who helped the gang clos cases. Basketball's Harlem Globetrotters got in the game for three episodes. Mystery, Inc., even teamed up with Gotham City's Batman and Robin. But of course, the Dynamic Duo always blindfolded the teens before taking them to the top-secret Batcave."
