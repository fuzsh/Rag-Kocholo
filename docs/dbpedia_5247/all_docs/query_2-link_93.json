His voice was originated by Don Messick. Besides being capable of human speech, he also has other anthropomorphic abilities, but remains the pet of Shaggy Rogers, and is the mascot of Mystery Incorporated, who is usually a gang of teenagers with a strong sense of purpose to solve mysteries and crimes.\n\nThroughout the years, Hanna-Barbera, Cartoon Network, and Warner Bros. Animation, as well as book and video game publishers, have conceived several incarnations, which don't always fit together because new writers have come on board and disregarded what has come before or there has been a complete reboot, but the general concept has been the same, except for DC Comics' radically altered Scooby Apocalypse.\n\nCharacter description\n\nUnlike an average Great Dane, Scooby-Doo has a single shade of brown fur with some black spots covering the upper half of his body. He has a small chin, a long sausage-like tail, a sloped back, and bowed legs. He wears a teal collar with a diamond-shaped name tag; His tag bears the initials \"SD\".\n\nSharing personality traits with his owner Shaggy, Scooby is constantly hungry and is scared easily by many things. The two refuse to help out Mystery Inc. in solving haunted crimes, but are encouraged to do so when offered Scooby Snacks. Eating the snacks temporarily made Scooby appear more heroic and loyal than he is.\n\nBeyond having the same traits as Shaggy, Scooby also has a bit of mischief in himself. He tends to do scare pranks on others and would snatch up food from Shaggy.\n\nAbilities\n\nScooby has the interesting ability to talk in English, albeit in a broken matter. His speech mainly consists of pronouncing the letter \"R\" at the start of most words and noises he made. Though incoherent at first, most people including Mystery Inc. can understand him perfectly, if they acknowledge that he can speak at all. In earlier installments of the franchise, he is a speech-impaired dog who could only spurt out single words and/or short sentences. However, in recent years (most notably in Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated), Scooby rarely has his speech impediment and can speak in fuller sentences. He is also able to talk to other animals (such as dogs), which may come in handy whenever the gang is in need of help of more information.\n\nApart from his speech, Scooby also has other anthropomorphic qualities to him. He is able to stand on his hind legs, and his paws have opposite thumbs which at times function like human hands. His body can morph to mimic any and all monsters, along with some humans, too.
