        "text": "For those of you have been watching Scooby Doo Mystery Incorporated.\n\nIt is a great show, with a background plot. Shaggy and Velma get romantic development. Fred and Daphne get development. It has a great evil talking canary villain. Its also pretty funny.The characters really feel fleshed out. They also have tributes to Godzilla and Cthulhu. It actually gets kind of dark when they go into Fred Jones's past (Major Spoiler)\n\nHowever in a recent episode, Scooby is having a lot of nightmares. At first it looks like he ate too many doughnuts and the dreams are only a side plot to main story of the episode which was about the Dandy Highwayman. However, at the very end, the dream starts talking to Scooby.\n\nInterdimensional aliens took the form of Nova, Scooby's girlfriend to talk to Scooby Doo. They say that they want to protect humanity, they are the annunaki. Well anyways the Annunaki can only speak to humans by taking possession of animal bodies. Creatures like the Monkey King from China was an Annunaki. These possessed animals have special powers. However at the end it is stated that descendants of these Annunaki have the ability to talk.\n\nI'm not mad. It was hinted through many episodes that there was a curse on the town where groups of kids along with a talking animal mascot would solve mysteries and its been happening throughout the history of the town.\n\nBut seriously...aliens. I was laughing after the episode. Oh dear god, aliens. Scooby is the descendant of an animal that got possessed by an alien.\n\nAliens...\n\nPS: Despite this shocking reveal its a very good show and I would recommend it to anyone.\n\nThis thread definitely needs a bump. The 2nd season has been even better than the first, and the plot and mythology has really gotten epic in scale. Professor Pericles makes all other Scooby Doo villains look like innocent puppies. Actually succeeding in killing one of the good guys, constantly having his robots open fire at the Gang, planning to murder the entire town once he's done using them, and trying to unlock an ancient evil that sounds like it belongs in a HP Lovecraft story than your typical Scooby-Doo show? Geezus Christ this parrot is twisted.\n\nAnd the character development is pretty awesome. Fred went from a total joke to someone who is frequently badass, and while the others haven't come as far they're definitely generally improved as well. Even Sheriff Stone gets a cool moment here or there.\n\nFinally, a Twin Peaks homage that's connected to the plot?! That's just awesome.\n\nWow, so that ending.. Gotta say, it got ridiculous but there was some good. As of now, what I can't shake though is how Pericles caught up to the gang and very quick and that Scooby kinda forgot about Nova in the new reality. I also don't like that Mr. E explanation.-_- But kudos on the references to the original series (to the point of it being an actual prequel with the laugh track at the end). Impo, this has been the best one in the franchise in terms of story and art. And oh, apparently Velma is a lesbian.lol"
