(Feel free to remove when satisfied of completion.)\n\nNeeded:\n\n* History is incomplete.\n\nSince the original Scoobert \"Scooby\" Doo has been the main character for more than fifty years worth of TV series, films and other media, an entire article has been given for biography.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nScooby was born at the Dooville Veterinary Hospital to Mumsy and Dada-Doo. His first words were \"Scooby Doo,\" so his father decided to name him that.[1]\n\nHe and Shaggy Rogers had an encounter with their Frankenstein-type babysitter and a sea monster, when they were infants.[2]\n\nHe was with Shaggy when they both entered Selma's store for the first time.[3]\n\nWhen the gang were babies, he and Shaggy were digging, when a monster scared him out of his diaper. He landed on one end of the see-saw, which sent the monster (who was on the other end) flying. Upon landing, they found that Red Herring was the monster.[4]\n\nScooby-Doo shared a laugh with Velma Dinkley when she learned about Scooby Snacks.[5]\n\nScooby-Doo was with Shaggy when he checked out the Pizza Parrot and the Butterbean Bunnies book at the Coolsville Public Library. When Mrs. Shusham told him there was no talking and no puppy-slurping allowed in the library, he left annoyed, calling her a grouch. One day, Shaggy dropped the book in a pile of bones, and Scooby accidentally buried them in the backyard.[6]\n\nScooby-Doo attended Velma's 5th birthday party, eating ice cream with Shaggy.[7]\n\nAt an unknown period, Scooby-Doo saved Colonel Beauregard Sanders from drowning in a fishpond. To repay him for his heroic deed, the Colonel had Scooby remembered in his will.[8]\n\nScooby-Doo was Roxanne's boyfriend for an unknown period (slightly younger than he was at the time of the Black Knight case), but they had to break up because he and Shaggy (boyfriend of Roxanne's owner, Rachel) were going on the road with the gang, and a long-distance relationship wouldn't work out, but they still wanted to be friends.[9]\n\nA Pup Named Scooby-Doo[]\n\nSeason one[]\n\nHe woke Shaggy up when he overslept and went to load newspapers on his bike, when he was scared away by a green ghost who steals the bike. Catching the trail of the bike, he lead the gang to the Daily Babbler printing room. While asking the editor Mr. Conrad about the missing bike, he sniffed green dry ink and began sneezing around the room. When they got thrown out, he got the trail again and brought them to the Furgeson Estate, where they found the bike in the basement. While hiding behind a printing press from the ghost, he sniffed more of the ink from the printing room and sneezed into the ghost, knocking it into the press trapping it. Later after the case was solved, Shaggy was shocked at what he had to pay the gang for their services and what Scooby ate.[10]\n\nHe was horrified when he learned that the Scooby Snack Factory would go out of business because of a cheese monster. Not wanting that to happen, the gang resolved to get to the bottom of it. When the kids were captured by the monster, Scooby bravely came to their aid without needing a Scooby Snack. However, the monster gave chase, and cornered him in a locked room, where Scooby ate most of the monster's costume. The monster was unmasked as Larry P. Acme, owner of a rival company who made Acme Dog Biscuits, which Scooby hated. Scooby was given a life-time supply of Boris Roquefort's new flavor, Bubblegum Scooby Snacks. But to Shaggy, a life-time's supply only lasted a day for Scooby.[11]\n\nHe grew jealous of Robopup, when Mr. Gordon lent him to help solve a mystery in Daphne's house. When Mr. Gordon was caught as the Ghost of Chef Pierre Goulash, he ordered Robopup to apprehend Scooby and the others, but he grabbed a remote, which caused Robopup to malfunction and fall apart. He then rearranged Robopup into a lamp.[12]\n\nSeason two[]\n\nHis parents gave him the Doo family collar as a birthday present, which he didn't like it, but was forced to try it on. However, the Ghost of Buster McMuttMauler, an enemy of the Doo family, was after the collar and kidnapped his parents and Mrs. Knittingham. He was willing to do whatever it took to find his family, even standing up to the ghost. The next day after the case was solved, he was told that he didn't have to wear the collar, and celebrated his birthday, along with his brothers, sister and friends.[13]\n\nShaggy and Scooby had a falling out and didn't talk to each other. However, when the Burger Monster captured Shaggy, and Scooby saved him, they made up. Later at home, they didn't remember what made them argue to begin with. But nevertheless, they were glad to be friends again.[14]\n\nHe was with the gang and Velma's parents when she won the Brain Club Science Show at school, and congratulated her. The next night during the case of her rouge robot the Dinkley 2000, he was willing to do anything to help clear her name when she was suspended earlier. When the robot cornored the two of them, Scooby helped Velma remember that the robot was programed to follow commands which was used to overload it. The next day, Velma was welcomed back into school and thanked Scooby.[15]\n\nHe ran away after he gets scolded by the gang looking for playtime. After a few chases by Paula P. Casso, who wanted his head for a project, he decides to go home, but finds himself lost and alone. He reunites with the gang at the harbor, and Paula just wanted to make a painting of his head, which he agree to pose for after understanding her reasons. The next day, the gang threw him a welcome home party, and promised to never be to busy to play with him.[16]\n\nSeason three[]\n\nHe was with the gang at the Coolsville Space Center when Velma's experiment was chosen to go on the shuttle launch. But when the Astronaut Ghost caused the launch to be canceled, and Velma's experiment wouldn't go into orbit, he and Shaggy were determined to solve the mystery for his friend. When the ghost was caught, the launch went back on schedule, and Velma thanked Scooby.[5]\n\nHe and Shaggy encountered Nasty-Doo, a cursed ancestor of Scooby's in Doo Manor. Professor Digmi revealed that the curse would be passed onto the first son of every seventh generation (which was Scooby) when he set foot in Doo Manor during a full moon. In the end, the monster turned out to be the professor himself, who wanted to find a leg bone for a skeleton of a Doo ancestor, and made up the whole curse to scare Scooby away.[17]\n\nHe was the target of a rouge dogcatcher Buster McMuttMauler, who wanted revenge on Scooby and his family. He attempted to catch or hurt him several times, but Scooby always escapes him.[18]\n\nScooby-Doo, Where Are You![]\n\nSeason one[]\n\nInsert details here.

When they woke up after the baby was born, they overheard Ruby naming him Scrappy-Doo. However, Scrappy took off looking for action, and Scooby and Shaggy ran into a hot-tempered hospital orderly, who pursued them around the building.

However, when the rest of the gang gets captured, Vincent used the time scepter, to show Scooby what the world would be ten years later, if he doesn't return.

To avoid punishment, Shaggy disguised himself as a harem (while Scooby hid), but was then chosen by the near-sighted Caliph to be his wife. So, Shaggy then tried to put him to sleep by telling him two stories, which by the end his cover was blown. Shaggy and Scooby weren't punished, though, as the former impressed the Caliph enough to make him his royal storyteller.[23]\n\nPost-Scrappy-Doo era[]\n\nHe and Shaggy worked as airport customs, and saw Daphne on TV. They got fired for eating foreign food. But, right after that, Freddie called them, asking if they would like to come back to the gang, which they accepted. The gang got back together on Daphne's birthday, and began adventuring like old times.\n\nAfter failing to find real spooks for Daphne's show, they learned from Lena Dupree about Moonscar Island.\n\nFollowing Lena to the island, they found dozens of cats at Moonscar Mansion, which Scooby chased, provoking the owner, Simone Lenoir.\n\nHe and Shaggy later encountered a zombie, that looked like the pirate the island's named after.\n\nThey also saw a civil war ghost in their room.\n\nWhile having dinner near a lake, they encountered a hoard of zombies.\n\nThey met up with Fred and Daphne, and realized the hard way, that the zombies were real. After they escaped the zombies in a cave, they found wax dolls of the gang, and began playing with them, not knowing that they're also controlling the gang. After they got scared out of the cave, they ran into the zombies again.\n\nThey ran into the ferryman, Jacques, who they were happy to see at first. However, he turned into a werecat, and pursued them.\n\nWith the zombies help, they escaped him, and stumbled into a ritual room, and knocked over Simone and Lena, who had the others tied up, with the dolls. They saw Lena and Simone transform into stronger werecats, and began chasing them, while the gang freed themselves. They were eventually caught by the werecats, and began draining their life forces. They were almost drained entirely, until they were saved when Daphne and Velma made voodoo dolls of the werecats. The life force that was drained returned to them afterwards. When the moonlight alignment passed, the werecats started shivering up, and ultimately died right before the gang's eyes. The zombies do the same, since they had been avenged.\n\nThe next morning, the gang headed back home using the ferry, but, Scooby found himself surrounded by the cats, who's eyes glow.[24]\n\nInsert details here.

Remembering Matsuhiro's words, Scooby leaped into the air and sliced the Sword of Doom in half, defeating the Black Samurai.
