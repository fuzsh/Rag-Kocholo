Thirteen episodes were produced for the 1980–81 season, and seven more for the 1981–82 as segments of The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show. The remaining thirteen episodes were produced as segments of The Scooby & Scrappy-Doo/Puppy Hour for the 1982–83 season. Out of the 99 shorts that were produced, 86 of them feature Scooby-Doo, his nephew Scrappy-Doo and Shaggy without the rest of the Mystery Inc gang, and the other 13 only feature Scrappy-Doo and Yabba-Doo.\n\nCast\n\nMain article: List of Scooby-Doo characters\n\nDon Messick – Scooby-Doo, Scrappy-Doo, Yabba-Doo (1982)\n\nCasey Kasem – Norville \"Shaggy\" Rogers\n\nFrank Welker – Deputy Dusty (1982)\n\nEpisodes\n\nThe following guide only includes 30 minute Scooby-Doo segments from each show.
