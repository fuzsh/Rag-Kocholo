Scooby Doo stands as one of the **longest-running** animated TV series. Even the biggest Scooby fans might be surprised by these **25 intriguing facts** about Scooby Doo you probably didnâ€™t know!\n\n25\n\nThe show was first pitched as a rock band with a dog who plays the bongos.\n\n24\n\nTwelve versions of the show have been produced. The most popular versions of the show were the original \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" (1969-1970) and \"What's New, Scooby-Doo?\" (2002-2006).\n\n23\n\nThe real reason that Fred and Daphne often went off together was because the writers wanted to focus on the more interesting characters.\n\n22\n\nScooby's full name is Scoobert-Doo.\n\n21\n\nScooby's name was originally meant to be \"Too Much.\" However, while on the way to a development meeting, one of the producers was inspired by a line from Frank Sinatra's \"Strangers in the Night\" where he sings \"doo-be-doo-be-doo.\"\n\n20\n\nThe same man, Don Messick, did the voice for Scooby-Doo, Scrappy-Doo, and even Papa Smurf.\n\n19\n\nScooby-Doo is actually a triplet. His identical siblings are named Skippy-Doo and Dooby-Doo.\n\n18\n\nThe original title of the show was \"W-Who's Scared.\" However, the writers thought it was too scary for kids, which is why they renamed it and added a dog.\n\n17\n\nThe team of mystery solvers have gone up against 392 different villains.\n\n16\n\nCasey Kasem, the voice for Shaggy, wanted him to be vegetarian.\n\n15\n\nWhen Shaggy was in a Burger King commercial, Casey even quit the show!\n\n14\n\nShaggy-Doo and Scooby-Doo are the only two characters to appear in every show.\n\n13\n\nFrank Welker, Fred's voice actor, voiced him through every movie and show except for one - \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\" (1988).\n\n12\n\nThe rumors about Velma being a lesbian aren't true. Writers even tried to match her up with Shaggy to put an end to them.\n\n11\n\nScooby is forever 7 years old.\n\n10\n\nIn spite of its crazy success, Scooby-Doo has only been nominated for 2 major awards. They were up for a Daytime Emmy in 1990 and Outstanding Performance in an Animated Program in 2003 (by Mindy Cohn as Velma).\n\n9\n\nScooby's speech disorder is called rhotacism. This is when you use the letter \"r\" excessively.\n\n8\n\nIn 2013, TV Guide ranked Scooby-Doo as the fifth greatest cartoon of all time.\n\n7\n\nInitially, Scooby was going to be a sheep dog, but producers thought he would be too similar to Hot Dog from Archie comics. Thus, they decided to make him a Great Dane.\n\n6\n\nThe producers wanted to give him a floppier and cuter look than a regular Great Dane.\n\n5\n\nScooby-Doo was the first Saturday morning cartoon to feature a laugh track.\n\n4\n\nAs an animated series, it was the longest running Saturday morning show in the United States.\n\n3\n\nScooby-Doo was created as part of a backlash towards the \"violent\" cartoons of the late 60's. It's worth noting that these cartoons, like Birdman, weren't nearly as violent as shows today.\n\n2\n\nThere was an actual police chase involving a Mystery Machine. Sharon Turman, of California, who drove a \"Mystery Machine\" van, was chased by police in 2016 for violating her parole.\n\n1\n\nIn addition to the multiple cartoon episodes and specials, there was also a live action movie. Released in 2002, the cast included Sarah Michelle Gellar, Rowan Atkinson, Matthew Lillard, and Freddie Prinze Jr. to name a few.\n\nFeatured Image: Brickset via flickr, CC BY 2.0\n\n25. pixabay (public domain), 24. wikimedia commons (public domain), 23.
