        "text": "What are they?\n\nThe popular scooby strings are thin hollow plastic tubes, usually brightly coloured which can be bought in loads of high street shops. They can then be knotted to form thicker creations which can be made in jewellery, put on key rings or made into ornaments.\n\nThe basic knots are ‘square’ and ‘circle’, which form cuboid and cylindrical structures respectively. There is also ‘triangle’ which as you can imagine forms a triangular pyramid. Then there is ‘box knot’, 'butterfly' and beads, feathers, eyes and much more can be added, creating endless possibilities.\n\nA lady in Bristol introduced the recent trend here after importing thousands, it was a risk but paid off. She had come back from holiday and saw that there could be a market.\n\nScoubis are now widely available in the UK. The technique is used for making ropework, as could be seen at the recent Sculptree event at Westonbirt Artboretum.\n\nThe good, the bad and the annoying\n\nThey can improve dexterity as it is a craft to create a good scooby, plus a certain amount of concentration and patience is required to complete one. Furthermore they interest boys and girls.\n\nHowever as with many fads there is a competitive edge to the playground pastime. Who is the best? Who has the most? Which colours are the coolest? ‘I’ve got the clear, rainbow, glitter one, how about you?’.\n\nCould the new PSP (Playstation Portable) rival the scoobie for playground attention? The PSP is more expensive and probably a lot more violent, so hopefully not.\n\nA trend for all\n\nIt's not just primary school kids who have been swept up with the trend. They can be spotted adorning the bags and wrists or teenagers, and maybe even older people. The new friendship bracelets? They used to be pieces of cotton or daises, now signs of friendship are plastic fibres intertwined to form technical looking arrangements."
