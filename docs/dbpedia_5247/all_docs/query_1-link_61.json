        "text": "One of the show's longest-standing fan theories purports that Shaggy is a total pothead. Which pans out on a number of levels, not least of which is the prevalent recreational use of drugs in the era the show originally aired. Shaggy is constantly paranoid about the existence of ghosts and always, always hungry.\n\nPlus, he spends most of his time blabbering to his dog. In very high doses, weed is a hallucinogen. His personality does rather fit the stereotypical pothead to a T.\n\nEver wonder why the gang seems to always be exploring the absolute dregs of the universe? Maybe it's because they live in a run down world. Reddit user Randomd0g suggests that the Scooby-Doo gang live in a post-depression world. The evidence is alarming.\n\nThey gang are almost always creeping around shoddy places like run- down hotels, abandoned theme parks, and unused airfields – places businesses up and left. Almost all of the villains in the series try to pull off money-making schemes, but they're generally really intelligent, highly-employable people (scientists, entrepreneurs, engineers). The theory alleges these people were laid off during the depression and unable to find work in the difficult economic climate.\n\nThere's also the fact that Shaggy can never seem to afford food for Scooby and himself. Never mind the that being a vigilante detective probably doesn't pay the bills, but the pair almost exclusively live off of biscuits. Sometimes, they come across a real, hot meal and show far too much enthusiasm, suggesting it may be because they are actually starving.\n\nWhile viewers may find it strange that entire villages of grown adults - with fully-staffed police forces - are willing to believe ghosts, goblins, and ghouls are to blame for disturbances, one Tumblr fan theory explains the discrepancy. This theory posits that, at one point, supernatural entities did exist in the Scooby-Doo world.\n\nReal monsters are shown in the Scooby-Doo movies. In Scooby-Doo! and the Witches Ghost, the Ghost of Sarah Ravencroft is sealed in a book. The very real monsters in Scooby-Doo! on Zombie Island exist in a secluded area and kill people who find them out. Basically, all the monsters in the Scooby-Doo universe are sealed away or in secluded locations.\n\nThis is why it's not wild for the people of that universe to accept that paranormal entities are behind crimes, but why it almost always turns out to be a guy in a suit.\n\nThis theory suggests Velma is definitely a lesbian. (This despite writers putting her and Shaggy in a relationship in Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated). For one, Velma is always the odd one out. She seems to get a bit jealous when Daphne always picks Fred as her number one. She's doesn't have a boyfriend through much of the series, and when she finally does, it's Shaggy. Shaggy is a beard – a cover and a completely unsuitable partner who always, always chooses his dog over her.\n\nVelma is brilliant and motivated. Do you really think she'd get on well with a stoner who lives in a car? So, why did she choose him? Because it's all a sham, and they're not really together. In the very least, Velma chose an unsuitable partner because she knows it can't work and isn't ready to admit her sexuality.\n\nThe theory is so widely backed that numerous think-pieces have been written urging writers to finally let the beloved brainiac settle down with a nice girl. In the original script for James Gunn's Scooby-Doo film, Velma was actually supposed to be gay.\n\nHow did a bunch of random kids, who'd never be friends in real life, wind up living in a van and driving around the country? Is it odd that they never stay in one place too long and seemingly have no direction? Not if they're dodging the military draft like this theory from Reddit user themightyheptagon suggests.\n\nThe original Scooby-Doo series debuted in 1969 at the height of the Vietnam War. During this time young people across the country were drafted into combat – a scary thought for the average citizen. The gang all had their separate motives. Shaggy was a hippie through-and-through. He probably didn't agree with any war let alone the Vietnam War. It's not too far off to think a pot-head like Shaggy wouldn't live a nomadic lifestyle with his dog (it's so Jack Kerouac).\n\nFred is dodging the draft. He's a clean-cut suburban kid with no reason to run away unless his draft number had come up. Daphne is in love with Fred, so she followed him to start their new life in Canada together. Maybe they spotted Shaggy hitchhiking and picked him up in the Mystery Machine (which Fred owns). Perhaps Shaggy's number also came up, and he's making a run for it. Velma looks like a caricature of an intellectual, college student-turned-activist who wildly opposes the war. She's helping them cross the border with Shaggy and possibly met Fred in college.\n\nMore evidence: The gang almost never call the police. The mystery crew sort out the criminal activity themselves because the police would ship Fred and/or Shaggy to war the second they figured out who they were.\n\nScooby-Doo and Shaggy are obsessed with Scooby Snacks and go to great lengths to get them, including facing their biggest fears. According to Reddit user IronedSandwich, this is because the snacks contain a depressant drug – one that makes them high and calms them down. Though weed-cookies are a bit of an obvious grab, it's possible that the Scooby Snack \"drug\" is not fit for human consumption or so new it is not illegal yet (which could explain why cops don't seem to mind it).\n\nIt makes sense – Scooby and Shaggy seemingly go through withdrawals and get anxious and jittery without them."
