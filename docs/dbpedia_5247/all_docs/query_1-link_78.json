        "text": "Scooby Doo Crime 4#: The Skeleton Robber October 17, 2015\n\nAuthor: Beach Combing | in : Modern , trackback\n\nThis is a story about the countryside around Portsmouth in the UK in 1825. It belongs to our Scooby Doo series of crimes: i.e. local hoodlums using the supernatural while carrying out illegal activities.\n\nA curious attempt at robbery took place a short time since, near this town. A Gentleman, returning home after spending the evening at a friend’s house at a short distance in the country, when crossing a field (the night being dark) saw something approach him, which appeared very tall, and concluding it was the ghost with which the neighbourhood had for some time past been represented to be infested, was resolved to see what it was. When the ghost advanced near to him, it threw open what appeared to be a cloak, and discovered an appearance intended to represent a skeleton with glaring eyes.\n\nIt would be lovely to know how they managed to do this… drbeachcombing AT yahoo DOT com\n\nThe gentleman then drew back slowly, and the ghost was advancing, when he heard a noise on his right, and a man suddenly appeared, who demanded to know where he was going, and on his asking [syntax seems a bit confused here] what business that was of his, the man drew from his bosom a pistol, and with an oath demanded his money. The gentleman having with him a stout stick, struck the hand the fellow, and the pistol went off. He then gave him a back-handed blow with the stick and knocked him down, and seeing the ghost, who had altered his appearance, preparing to attack him, he made his escape, and having procured assistance, returned to the spot, but unfortunately could not find the delinquents.\n\nAs so often with supernatural crime the trail gets very muddied, are the two idiots below simple copycats or the same gang of crooks?\n\nThis is the only attempt at highway robbery that has been heard of in this neighbourhood for some years past. This story being in circulation, tempted two idle young men to the mad frolic trying to frighten their neighbours; having suddenly made their appearance in Green-lane, one mounted the shoulders of the other, with a white sheet covering both, the apparently tall and supernatural figure caught the attention several persons at that time (about ten o’clock in evening) gossiping near their homes, when one of them exclaimed, ‘here’s the ghost coming!’ The terror in consequence, became general, and, lamentable to relate, was fatal to a fine young woman, who was far advanced in a state of pregnancy, and whose husband had just gone to sea—for, having escaped into her house, she sunk down in a fright, and in less than twenty-four hours had ceased to exist. The delinquents are known, but hitherto they have escaped the vigilance of the police-officers, who are in pursuit of them. Berkshire Chronicle – Saturday 19 March 1825, 4\n\n31 Oct 2015: David O writes in ‘Green Lane sounds correct – it’s full of 1930s residential semis today, but it’s actually a surviving farm lane’."
