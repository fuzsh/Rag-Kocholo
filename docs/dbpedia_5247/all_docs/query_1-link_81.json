        "text": "Scooby-Doo is a cultural icon, one that has been translated across dozens of countries and languages. And he and his buddies Shaggy, Velma, Fred, and Daphne have been unmasking local monsters for over five decades now. But Halloween time is Scooby’s biggest season, for obvious reasons. In honor of the spooky season, Hamster & Gretel actress and YouTube sensation Jenny Lorenzo has created a comedic tribute to the Mystery, Inc. gang, presenting them through a Spanish language lens.\n\nLorenzo wrote the video, along with Kevin Bosch, who also directed it. You can check out the full If Scooby-Doo Was Latino video down below. Don’t forget to have a tasty Scooby Snack before you watch.\n\nYou’ll notice a few little differences in this version of Scoob and the gang. For starters, Scooby is not a Great Dane, but a much tinier (and cuter) pooch. Also, the Mystery Machine isn’t a hippie van anymore, but an ice cream truck. Frankly, we see that as a big improvement. And the action this time takes place in Florida. Although, the original Scooby-Doo cartoons did kind of take place everywhere, so maybe they did go to Florida once. After all, one time Fred drove the Mystery Machine to Japan. (Best not to ask how they managed to do that)."
