The series premiered as part of the network's Saturday morning cartoon schedule on September 13, 1969, and aired for two seasons until October 31, 1970. In 1978, a selection of episodes from the later animated series Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics and The Scooby-Doo Show were aired on ABC under the Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! title name, and was released in a DVD set marketed as its third season.[4] It also aired on BBC One in the UK from 1970 to 1973.[5] The complete series is also available on Boomerang, Max, and Tubi streaming services.\n\nScooby-Doo, Where Are You! is the first incarnation of a long-running media franchise primarily consisting of animated series, several films, and related merchandise.\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nThe show follows the adventures of teenagers Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley, and Shaggy Rogers, and their dog Scooby-Doo. They travel in a van known as The Mystery Machine, encountering and solving mysteries. Once solved, the group typically discovers that the perpetrator of the mystery is a disguised person who seeks to exploit a local legend or myth for personal gain.[6]\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nVoice cast\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: List of Scooby-Doo characters\n\nDon Messick as Scooby-Doo and miscellaneous characters\n\nCasey Kasem as Shaggy Rogers and miscellaneous characters\n\nFrank Welker as Fred Jones and miscellaneous characters\n\nStefanianna Christopherson (season 1) and Heather North (seasons 2–3) as Daphne Blake\n\nNicole Jaffe (seasons 1–2) and Pat Stevens (season 3) as Velma Dinkley\n\nJune Foray\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Scooby-Doo\n\nScooby-Doo, Where Are You! was the result of CBS and Hanna-Barbera's plans to create a non-violent Saturday morning program that would appease the parent watch groups that had protested the superhero-based programs of the mid-1960s.[7] Originally titled The Mysteries Five and later Who's S-S-Scared?, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! underwent several changes from script to screen (the most significant being the downplaying of a musical group angle).[8] However, the basic concept—a group of teenagers and their dog solving supernatural-related mysteries—was always in place.[9]\n\nScooby-Doo creators Joe Ruby and Ken Spears served as the story supervisors on the series.[10]\n\nHome media\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 14, 2000, Warner Home Video released five episodes from the series on a DVD entitled Scooby-Doo's Original Mysteries. They later released all 25 episodes on DVD in Region 1 on March 16, 2004 under the title Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! The Complete First and Second Seasons.[11] A DVD entitled Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! The Complete Third Season was released on April 10, 2007, made up of episodes produced in 1978, added to the Scooby's All-Stars package, and later syndicated as part of The Scooby-Doo Show.[12][13]\n\nOn November 9, 2010, Warner Home Video released Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!: The Complete Series. The eight-disc set features all 25 episodes of the series plus the 16 episodes produced in 1978 which aired as part of Scooby's All-Stars. The set is encased in special collectible packaging in the form of a Mystery Machine replica. It also features a special bonus disc filled with new and archival material.[14] The set was re-released on November 13, 2012. A Blu-ray version of the Complete Series was released on September 3, 2019, for the series' 50th anniversary.[15]\n\nStarting on January 27, 2009, Warner Home Video released DVDs with four episodes each, plus an episode from Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue.
