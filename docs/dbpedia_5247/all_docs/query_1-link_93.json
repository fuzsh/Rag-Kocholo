        "text": "Ohio is a mysterious place. Not only does this area account for some unusual historical happenings (like a cross-state UFO chase involving a team of police officers), we’re also next to what is arguably the spookiest of the Great Lakes. With a name like Erie, it’s no wonder that this area purportedly hosts Scooby-Doo’s fictional hometown, though one would not necessarily assume that Scooby-Doo and Cleveland have anything in common.\n\nWhen A Pup Named Scooby-Doo premiered, we learned that the famously-nomadic Scooby Gang call a quirky town named Coolsville home. This swell place is where the gang grew up, and in Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster, we learned that Coolsville is just miles away from Lake Erie’s shore. Prepare to connect with your inner super sleuth, because you just might want to fuel up the Mystery Machine and investigate these eerie communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWant to catch the beginning scenes of this Scooby Doo movie? WB Kids has shared the first 10 minutes of the movie:\n\nScooby-Doo is a beloved cartoon canine that, according to this movie, understands the allure of Greater Cleveland. What was your favorite episode or incarnation of Scooby-Doo?\n\nAre you just as intrigued by mystery as the Scooby Gang? You may be surprised to learn that these eight events occurred right here in Greater Cleveland.\n\nWant more Cleveland in your inbox?\n\nGet the latest on things to see, do, and eat around Cleveland!\n\nspinner\n\nThank you!
