        "text": "Yowamushi Kuruppa. Or Kuruppa for short. Atleast originally...and the other characters all have different names too!\n\nView: https://twitter.com/scoobyhistory/status/1579623400557129728\n\nAtleast in the original series. Maybe they've standardized it by now? But this is shocking.\n\nI know Japanese characters getting new names is common, but in my experience the reverse isn't as common...and it makes sense. In most English speaking countries such as the U.S., Japanese is rarely mandatory outside of certain localities...there was no Japanese classes offered in my High School. But in Japan, English is more or less mandatory it seems for most kids so it's not surprising the average Japanese viewer would be able to pick up English names easier than the average English viewer picking up Japanese names.\n\nBut this got me thinking...is Scooby-Doo popular in Japan? Like Japan clearly loves many American imports like as we see in another thread, Columbo, or like how Sylvester Stallone and Arnold movies influenced every videogame in the 80s and early 90s.\n\nBut Scooby-Doo? Off the top of my head I honestly can't think of a single reference to it in Japanese media like ever. Closest I can think of is the idea of mystery solving kids in like Persona 4, but I've never been watching an anime or playing a Japanese game and been like \"yo is that a Scooby-Doo reference?!\"\n\nEdit: I guess Fred's Japanese name being Handsome might be why the detective in Pok√©mon known as Looker in the west was called Handsome in Japan, though he's clearly less Fred and more Zenigata or Columbo.\n\nFeels like all the big cartoons from around the time didn't though...all the Looney Tunes and Disney characters didn't. It's called the Flinstones over there and not a Japanese rock pun.\n\nit's called les pierreafeu in french, as i said, it happens for many stuff in many countries, sometime they keep the names, sometime they don't\n\nit was more prevalent back then, recently most of them reverted back to the original names\n\nBut this got me thinking...is Scooby-Doo popular in Japan? Like Japan clearly loves many American imports like as we see in another thread, Columbo, or like how Sylvester Stallone and Arnold movies influenced every videogame in the 80s and early 90s.\n\nconsidering the whole franchise is a stoner joke i'd be surprised if it is but maybe. same country that birthed a mushroom eating plumber who turns into racoon or a cat or whatever\n\nShow was named Genjin Kazoku Flintstones, IIRC, and Yogi's called Goro the Bear, so Hannah Barberra seemed to be the most hit.\n\nOf the top of my head, \"Frankenstein Jr and the Impossibles\" was named \"Super Three\". Frankenstein Jr the character was named Franken Robo.\n\nI also think that's weird because it's actually super early for an American mecha thing. It's presumably inspired by Gigantor, but it's only a year or two after its American localization. Granted it took like ten years from the original manga to the anime to the American localization, but I don't think they were making new mecha stuff every year until later.\n\nIt's fascinating because the man who designed the Scooby Doo characters was Japanese:\n\nHe learned how to draw from other Japanese people when they were in an interment camp in World War 2, but I don't think he's ever been to Japan, which makes me really curious. I don't have any reason to believe from his history that he's specifically inspired by anime but some of the stuff Hanna Barbera was doing definitely look the part.\n\nLook at Gachaman's costume and Casshern's transforming robot dog Friender, both Tatsunoko superhero series. Then look at Blue Falcon and Dyno-Mutt.\n\nYeah is Doronjo's goons like Dick Dastardy and Muttley right?\n\nMaybe? I don't think they're that similar personality-wise, aside from being card-carrying villain characters who really aren't that bad and being so prominent that they're arguably the protagonists of the piece. But the Doronbo Gang are also direct continuations of the Time Skeletons from Time Bokan, who I think had a smaller role - they were expanded because they were the most popular part of the show. But it could be an influence, the show's a strict formula comedy along the lines of a Hanna Barbera cartoon like Scooby Doo.\n\nWhile we're on the subject, when Polimar isn't brutally murdering people, it gives me a real Hannah Barbera vibe. Like he's got a goofy snarking dog and he's hanging around a bumbling would-be detective."
