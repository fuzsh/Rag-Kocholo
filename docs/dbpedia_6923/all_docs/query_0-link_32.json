On his retirement this year he was Deputy Director of the Education Directorate which included responsibility for several specialised educational programmes including Institutional Management in Higher Education and Educational Building Programmes. He was also the most senior officer responsible for the QECD Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI). Dr Papadopoulos' role in educational development throughout the OECD countries cannot be easily captured by mere reference to his official position. He began his professional life as a teacher in one-teacher school in Cyprus before coming to England to gain a first class honours degree in History at Exeter University (then University College). He took a doctorate from there in co-operation with the Institute for Historical Research in two years and this was later published. It was on the British presence in the near-east at the end of the nineteenth century. After various teaching and educational administration jobs he moved to the OECD.\n\nIt was he who helped to organise the first OECD meeting of science ministers in the 1960s. In 1968 he was instrumental in securing Ford Foundation and Dutch Shell money for the creation of the Centre for Educational Research and Innovation. He did so in the belief that, in the wake of the Paris events in May of that year and the turmoil throughout education systems at the time, the credibility of the OECD depended on responding to the mood of innovation and change that then prevailed.\n\nPost by leandros nikon on\n\n2.C Biological sciences.\n\nDr George Papanikolaou\n\nGeorge Papanicolaou: inventor of the pap smear.Uterine cancer & the papsmear: a profile of George Papanicolaou, the inventor of the pap smear for cancer detection in women, a diagnostic test that has saved millions of lives.\n\nGeorge Nicolas Papanicolaou was born on May 13, 1883 in Kymi, Greece. His father, Nicolas, was a well-respected physician and his mother, Maria, was a very cultured lady who had a great love for Greek classical music and literature. George had three siblings, Athanase, Maria and Helen. When George was four years old he began grammar school. He was a sensitive child and spent his free time hiking in the mountains, boating or walking along the sea.\n\nWhen George was eleven he went to Athens to study at a school his older brother attended. In 1898, George entered the University of Athens where he majored in humanities and music. His father wanted him to become a physician. Due to his father's encouragement, George went to medical school and graduated with an \"A\" average in 1904. He served as an assistant surgeon in the military until 1906. Although his father tried to encourage him to remain in the military as a physician, George wanted to pursue a career in scientific research.\n\nDr. George Papanicolaou began his medical career taking care of patients at a leper colony north of his hometown of Kymi. Papanicolaou was very sympathetic to the lepers, who received little care from the surrounding community, and spent a lot of time tending to their medical and other personal needs.\n\nIn 1907, Papanicolaou went to Jena, Germany for postgraduate study at the Zoological Institute in Munich, the greatest zoological research center in the world at that time. His first teacher at the Institute in Munich was Professor Ernst Haeckel, one of Europe's greatest early proponents of Darwinism. In 1910, Papanicolaou obtained his Ph.D., he was now George Nicolas Papanicolaou, M.D., Ph.D. After receiving his Ph.D., he married Mary Mavroyeni, the daughter of a wealthy merchant from his hometown of Kymi.\n\nIn 1912, Dr. Papanicolaou joined the Balkan Alliance in the war against Turkey. He was 1st Lieutenant in the Medical Corps. During his time in the military, he had met some Greek-American soldiers who told him of the opportunities in the United States. Dr. Papanicolaou obtained a position as assistant in the Department of Anatomy at New York's Cornell Medical School in 1914. His wife, Mary, also worked there as his technician.\n\nIn 1920, Dr. Papanicolaou began his study of the girl thingyl cytology of the human. After becoming familiar with normal cytology changes, he found some cases of malignancy. About this discovery, he remarked, \"The first observation of cancer cells in a smear of the uterine cervix was one of the most thrilling experiences of my scientific career.\" In 1928 he published a paper about the results of his work, entitled, \"New Cancer Diagnosis.\" A newspaper article in the \"New York World\" stated, \"Although Dr. Papanicoloau is not willing to predict how useful the new diagnostic method will be in the actual treatment of malignancy itself, it seems probable that it will prove valuable in determining cancer in the early stages of its growth when it can be more easily fought and treated. There is even hope that pre-cancerous conditions may be detected and checked.\"\n\nIn 1928, Dr. Papanicolaou became a citizen of the United States and was promoted to Assistant Professor of Anatomy at Cornell. In 1939, the reevaluation of the girl thingyl smear for cancer detection began. At the New York Hospital all women patients were required to take a routine girl thingyl smear. Dr. Herbert Traut, a gynecological pathologist, collaborated with Dr. Papanicolaou to validate the diagnostic potential of the girl thingyl smear. In 1943, they published their findings and conclusions in the famous monograph, \"Diagnosis of Uterine Cancer by the girl thingyl Smear.\" The diagnostic procedure was named the Pap test.\n\nIn 1954, Dr. Papanicolaou's comprehensive scientific treatise was published. It was entitled, \"Atlas of Exfoliative Cytology,\" which contained a compendium of cytological findings in health and disease involving multiple organ systems of the human body. Some of the many awards and honors he received were the First Award of the Order of AHEPA, as the Most Outstanding American Scientist of Greek Descent; The Honor Medal of the American Cancer Society; The Modern Medicine Award for Distinguished Achievement; Honorary Member of the Obstetrical and Gynecological Society of Athens; Honorary Member of the New York Academy of Sciences; Permanent Honorary Consultant to the Society of Pelvic Surgeons; and Honorary Degrees from the University of Athens, University of Turin and the Hahnemann Medical College.\n\nDr. Papanicolaou died on February 18, 1962 of heart failure and pulmonary edema and is buried in New Jersey. Millions of women have received the Pap test and deaths from cancer of uterus has been greatly reduced because of the test. On May 13, 1962, the Papanicolaou Cancer Research Institute in Miami, Florida was dedicated. The dedication address was given by Dr. Papanicolou's friend, Dr. Charles Cameron, who said: \"He was a giver of life; he is in the company of the great; he is one of the elect of the men of earth who stand for all eternity like solitary towers along the way to human betterment. We are deeply in his debt.\"\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nwww.bnaneuro.net/barrow_phys_pappa.html\n\nDr. Stephen Papadopoulos specializes in spinal surgery and computerized applications in the operating room.\n\nDr. Papadopoulos is a graduate of the University of Texas Medical School in Houston.

In particular, Dr. Coukos is interested in mechanisms regulating the trafficking and regulation of immune cell function within the tumor and mechanisms modulating tumor cell immunogenicity. State-of-the-art high-throughput analysis of tumors is carried out using laser capture microdissection followed by molecular profiling using cDNA arrays and protein arrays as well as conventional molecular biology techniques. These are combined with conventional cell culture work. In addition, a syngeneic model of epithelial ovarian cancer was recently generated in Dr. Coukos' lab and is used to study host-tumor interactions in vivo. The laboratory is also focused on the immune therapy and biological therapy of ovarian cancer and other gynecologic malignancies. We are exploring the application of dendritic cell-based vaccines as well as the use of recombinant oncolytic or replication-incompetent viruses encoding cytokines for intraperitoneal in situ vaccination of ovarian carcinoma.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChristos Coutifaris, M.D., Ph.D.\n\nAssociate Professor and Director, Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility\n\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Medical Center\n\nTrophoblasts are the cells of the human placenta responsible for implantation of the embryo, maintenance of pregnancy and fetal-maternal metabolic and nutritional exchange. Work in Dr. Coutifaris' laboratory centers around elucidating the mechanism(s) regulating the differentiation of cytotrophoblasts towards the extravillous (invasive) versus the villous (non-invasive but hormonally active) phenotypes. Primary cultures of trophoblasts isolated from human placentae as well as several choriocarcinoma cell lines with different migratory, aggregating and fusing capacities are used as models for in vitro studies. Specifically, the investigative effort is directed towards understanding the roles of cell adhesion molecules (CAM's) and extracellular matrix receptors (integrins) in these morphogenetic processes. The main focus of the research is to analyze the interaction of these cell surface glycoproteins with the cytoskeleton and elucidate their role in specific gene activation, which, in turn, results in remodelling of the cell adhesion complex and leads to cellular fusion and syncytial trophoblast formation. In addition, the expression and cell-surface organization of integrins, which confer the migratory, invasive or stationary phenotypes to these cells is also being investigated. The long term goal of these research efforts is to understand, at the molecular level, aspects of normal and pathologic trophoblast implantation.\n\nalso read...\n\nwww.pennhealth.com/Wagform/MainPage.aspx?config=provider&P=PP&ID=970\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPanos Zavos\n\nBorn: 1944\n\nGeneticist\n\nBorn in Trikomo, Cyprus\n\nBorn February 23, 1944, in Tricomo, Cyprus, Panayiotis Michael Zavos is the second youngest son of Michael and Theodora Zavos.

Tzakis\n\nwww.diabetesresearch.org/AbouttheDRI/DRIFaculty/AndreasTzakis.htm\n\nAndreas G. Tzakis, M.D., a world-renowned transplant surgeon who has long collaborated with the Diabetes Research Institute faculty, recently joined DRI as director of Microsurgery Core Facility in the Cell Transplantation Center.\n\nThe former director of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine's Pediatric Liver and Intestinal Transplant Programs, Dr. Tzakis joined the University of Miami School of Medicine in 1994 as co-director, with Joshua Miller, M.D., of the Division of Transplantation and as director of the Surgery Department's newly created Division of Liver and Intestinal Transplantation.\n\nWhile with the University of Pittsburgh's transplant team, Dr. Tzakis performed numerous pioneering surgeries, among them the world's first successful islet transplant from a single pancreas in collaboration with DRI's Camillo Ricordi, M.D., Daniel Mintz, M.D., and Rodolfo Alejandro, M.D.\n\nDr. Tzakis is considered the leading transplant surgeon in the world, says Dr. Ricordi. He was selected to perform all the most complex cases at the University of Pittsburgh, and is a tremendous asset and a unique faculty scholar at the DRI and the University of Miami.\n\nIn addition to being an accomplished liver transplant surgeon, Dr. Tzakis has been a principal contributor to the development of small bowel and multiple-organ transplantation as a viable procedure for both children and adults.\n\nIn recent years, he performed history-making baboon-to-human liver transplants at the Pittsburgh Medical Center. In Miami, Dr. Tzakis plans to continue his research on cross-species transplantation.\n\nHe is also collaborating with DRI faculty on clinical studies to induce tolerance to organ and cellular transplants without the need for long-term immunosuppressive therapy. Working with Dr. Ricordi, he is transplanting the bone marrow cells of the donor along with the transplanted organs, tissues or cells to create a state of chimerism, or the mixture of donor and recipient cells in the transplant patient's body.\n\nThe movement of the donor and recipient cells between the transplanted organ and recipient is considered a key mechanism for acceptance of foreign tissue. He also leads a research effort to introduce new genes into these bone marrow cells that would suppress immune reactivity to these donor cells.\n\nA native of Greece, Dr. Tzakis received his M.D. from the University of Athens, and completed a surgical residency at Mt. Sinai Medical Center in New York. After completing a surgical residency under Harry Sozoff, M.D., and Felix Rapaport, M.D., professor of surgery and chief of transplantation at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, Dr. Tzakis then successfully concluded a two-year transplantation fellowship under Thomas E. Starzl, M.D., Ph.D., at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nAuthor or co-author of more than 300 papers, Dr. Tzakis is a member of several professional organizations and has often lobbied Congress and the national organ donor network to place more emphasis on patient need, and less on geographical boundaries in deciding how to allocate life-saving organs.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nwww.kimmelcancercenter.org/RadOnc/ili.htm\n\nGeorge Iliakis, Ph.D.\n\nProfessor, Radiation Oncology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital\n\nE-mail: george.iliakis@mail.tju.edu\n\nDr. Iliakis is a trained Radiobiologist.

He continued in India at different homeopathic colleges, receiving a diploma from the Indian Institute of Homeopathy in 1966.\n\nReturning to Greece the following year, Vithoulkas started practicing homeopathy and teaching it to a small group of Greek medical doctors. The therapeutic success of these first doctors so attracted the attention of others that the Athenian School of Homeopathic Medicine was established in 1970. The school, since re-named the Center of Homeopathic Medicine, is devoted exclusively to the teaching of MDs.\n\nIn 1994, Vithoulkas opened the International Academy for Classical Homeopathy on the Greek island of Alonissos, its purpose being to provide post-graduate training for health practitioners from all over the world. Currently, as the Director of the Athens Center, Vithoulkas heads a team of 30 doctors who practice homeopathy while they study under his supervision. He has established homeopathy in Greece as a science respected by the medical profession, and has also made his country one of the leading centers for homeopathy in the western world.\n\nVithoulkas' books, Homeopathy: Medicine of the New Man (Arco, New York, 1979), written for lay people, and The Science of Homeopathy (Grove Press, New York, 1980), for health professionals, have been translated into twenty languages and have had a profound influence upon the acceptance and practice of homeopathy worldwide. His book, A New Model for Health and Disease, published in German and English in 1991, makes a fundamental critique of conventional allopathic medicine and sets out a new paradigm for the science of medicine.\n\nHe has been an international teacher of classical homeopathy for 20 years. In the year 1996, he was awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize for his work in the field of Classical Homeopathy.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irena_Papadopoulos\n\nIrena Papadopoulos\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nProfessor Irena Papadopoulos (born in Famagusta, Cyprus) is a prominent Greek Cypriot transcultural nursing researcher and now resides in the United Kingdom.\n\nPapadopoulos currently heads the research centre for transcultural studies in health at Middlesex University but has been working within the NHS and the University sector for over 30 years.

He studied music and mathematics at the University of Athens and completed a doctorate in biology in Munich with Ernst Pöppel. His research interests lie in exploring the neural mechanisms of visual perception.\n\nAccording to Logothetis, in order to understand a system, a description of it is necessary at all levels . As a result, intracortical cell recording and also modeling and imaging is conducted at all levels in his department. Therefore, in addition to functional magnetic resonance imaging, 'in vivo' spectroscopy is also used, and the working group is researching smart contrast agents (SCA) in order to make functional imaging useful for effects other than haemodynamic response.\n\nLogothetis has made significant discoveries, such as finding out that the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) response is connected to brain activity at a neuronal level. These findings are essential for correct interpretation of measurements with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).\n\nLogothetis is one of the 2003 winners of the Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine.\n\nRead more: illyria.proboards.com/thread/2577/golden-modern-greeks#ixzz46sdpr0w5\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nwww.med.nyu.edu/biosketch/papagt01\n\nThales Papagiannakopoulos\n\nAssistant Professor, Department of Pathology\n\n...........................................................................\n\nwww.greece-is.com/news/greek-doctors-innovative-cancer-research/\n\nGreek Doctor’s Innovative Cancer Research\n\nA young Greek assistant professor is part of a team that is revolutionizing the study of cancer mutations.\n\nMathaios Tsimitakis | January 21st, 2016\n\nHe’s only 33 years old, but has an office and a laboratory at New York University (NYU) and is at the forefront of research for the discovery of treatments for lung cancer — the most deadly form of the disease.\n\nThales Papagiannakopoulos, Assistant Professor in the Department of Pathology at NYU, has employed a revolutionary new technique which tries to understand how specific commonly occurring cancer mutations work.\n\nThe ultimate objective is the development of genetic cancer therapies, something which, for now, is extremely difficult because of the complexity involved. But Papagiannakopoulos’ research might well be a right step in the right direction.\n\nOn December 22, 2015, the Academy of Athens awarded him a special prize for his innovative research, which was accepted for publication in the leading scientific journal, Nature. Science magazine also described the CRISPR method used by Papagiannakopoulos’ scientific group as a scientific revolution.\n\nCancer research is first tested theoretically on computer models, then in human tissue cultures and then in animals, such as the Drosophila fly and mice.\n\n“Until recently we had to create mutations through stem cells produced by mice. This could take up to three years. Now we can intervene directly in the DNA of adult organisms, which is of particular interest to us since cancer usually occurs in mature tissue,” he explains.\n\nThe technique used by the group, in which Papagiannakopoulos participated as a postdoctoral MIT researcher, managed to produce four mutations in four months, although, as he says, there is no barrier to creating many more, which could greatly accelerate cancer research.\n\nThe CRISPR method was discovered in the late ’80s in Osaka, Japan, when researchers observed that some bacteria can alter their DNA to protect themselves against virus attacks.\n\nYears later in 2014, scientists in the US found that they could use this mechanism to splice new DNA, much like cutting text on a computer screen. They then inserted a protein which was prompted by the cell’s RNA to break down the DNA sequence of the cell, as desired by the researchers.\n\n“Using viruses, we managed to transfer cancerous mutations to specific cells in the lung and can focus our study on these. It’s like we found a genetic switch that allows you to create combinations of genetic mutations that occur in humans.” says Papagiannakopoulos.\n\nThe big problem that researchers are trying to overcome is the complexity of mutations.\n\nIn 200 lung cancer patients, Papagiannakopoulos identified two oncogenes that appear to occur more frequently (in 70% of cases while there are thousands of other mutations whose function is currently unknown) and is trying to interrupt their operation to inhibit disease progression.\n\nThe belief in the medical community is that, in the future, gene therapies will be created which may turn some forms of cancer into chronic conditions, though generating a unique DNA treatment per patient is not easy.\n\nIf they manage to find genetic pathways that involve large patient groups, they might move a step closer to personalized treatments.\n\nThe revolutionary CRISPR method employed by Papagiannakopoulos also has other ethically questionable uses.\n\n“The method can be used for practically anything. We know that some scientists in China have attempted to use it for the genetic engineering of cells.” he says. “Eugenics may be closer than we think,” he concludes.\n\n* Originally published in kathimerini.gr\n\nRead more: illyria.proboards.com/thread/2577/golden-modern-greeks#ixzz46seuTZeY\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nwww.usias.fr/en/fellows/fellows-2015/evi-soutoglou/\n\nEvi Soutoglou\n\nUniversity of Strasburg\n\nEvi Soutoglou obtained her PhD in the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB), Crete, Greece, in tissue regulation of gene expression.

She is also a co-founder in a start-up initiative entitled \"Transplants Without Donors\" a medical firm to popularize artificial organ transplantation with research, with the long-term vision of creating organs in the laboratory and transplanting them on sick patients in need. She has won several awards from many institutions.\n\nBiography\n\nAntoniadou was born in Greece in 1988. Right from her school days when she was interested in astronomy and aerospace clubs she hoped to pursue science studies. Her initial college education was at the University of Thessaly in Greece from where she graduated with a BSc degree in Computer Science and Biomedical Informatics in 2009.[3][5] She continued her studies at University College London, earning a master's degree in nanotechnology and regenerative medicine. Thereafter, she studied at the University of Illinois and was awarded another master's degree in bioengineering and tissue engineering. Concurrently with her doctoral studies in Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research, she worked as a researcher to study the effects of changes in atmospheric pressure on the nervous systems of astronauts at the NASA Mars Exploration Lab.\n\nWhile pursuing her studies, Antoniadou also experimented on neural generation testing biomaterials which could be adopted as artificial nerves.\n\nAwards\n\nIn the course of her young career Antoniadou has received several awards, including:[4] NASA - ESA Award for 2012; the 50 Future Award'; in September selected for the 2013 Woman of the Year at the annual British FDM Every-woman in Technology Awards, the 2015 Young Business Woman of the Year in the UK, BBC 100 Most Powerful Women, \"11 Great Greeks of the Past, Present and Future\" by the EPP party of the European Parliament, Libertine 100, Greek America Fortyunder40. In 2014 she became the USA Laureate for Cartier for her research in bioengineering.[8] Eleni was included in the List of 21st-century women scientists that was sponsored by The New York Academy of Sciences and the Young Global Leaders 2016 by the World Economic Forum. Eleni Antoniadou was named the recipient of the 2016 “Giuseppe Sciacca” International Award for “Science & Research” presented by His Eminence, the Most Reverend Cardinal Dario Castrillón Hoyos in the Vatican City, Rome.\n\nAppreciation\n\nForbes, awarding Antoniadou third place in the \"30 Under 30\" list of the leading young people in the field of healthcare, observed:\n\n“ \"Eleni Antoniadou is chasing one of the holy grails of biotechnology:the idea of creating organs in the laboratory that could be transplanted into sick patients who need them. Her company, Transplants Without Donors, has been run with tens of thousands of dollars from its founders in 2012. Now it is searching for angel investors to take it to the next level.\" ”\n\nThe Daily Telegraph UK included Antoniadou as one of the \"Trailblazers who paved the way to success for generations of women\", the Provocateur Magazine included her in the list \"5 Outstanding Greeks for 2014\", the Marie Claire Magazine featured her in the piece \"8 Women that Change the World\", Wow Now Magazine portrayed her in the article \"15 Most Inspirational Women\", Red Magazine selected her as a finalist for the Smart Woman award, MedTech Boston included her in the list \"Top 10 Heathcare Trendsetters of 2016\" and the Daily Toast featured her in the piece \"6 Superwomen in Real Life\".\n\n.............................................................................\n\nwww.forbes.com/pictures/mkg45effdk/eleni-antoniadou-27/\n\nRead more: illyria.proboards.com/thread/2577/golden-modern-greeks#ixzz46shBKQrF\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\npipl.com/directory/people/Afksendiyos/Kalangos\n\nAfksendiyos Kalangos\n\nAfksendiyos Kalangos is a Professor of paediatric and adult cardiac surgery and Head of the Department of Cardiac Surgery of the University Hospital of Geneva, Switzerland.\n\n...................................................................\n\nwww.ellines.com/en/famous-greeks/763-the-golden-hands-of-pediatric-cardiac-surgery/\n\nThe “golden” hands of pediatric cardiac surgery\n\nHe has been characterized as the modern missionary of Medicine and not unfairly. He is not just interested in titles or offices. He was a disciple of Alain Karpentie and Magktni Yaqub, whom he followed closely. Afksentiyos Kalangos is holding the leading position in the Department of Cardiac surgery of the University Hospital of Geneva. All the above do not matter more than the 15.000 surgeries over the last decade to poor children.\n\nIn 1998, Afksentiyos Kalangos founded the charity institution «Coeurs pour tous» (Hearts for All), and since then he is surrounded by a group of surgeons with common ideals, offering valuable medical services to people in need around the world.\n\nHe graduated in 1984 at the age 23, from the American Medical Faculty of Istanbul, he specialized himself in surgery in London and then he spent five additional years of study in order to be devoted to heart surgery for children and babies in Paris and in the U.S. Eventually he became a professor at the University of Geneva at his early 40s.\n\nHe loves the smell of cinnamon and he always has a bottle of it in his office. He says that cinnamon regenerates him, but it also reminds him of the place of his origin Constantinople.\n\nAs a son of a doctor, his father was a physician, head physician of the pediatric hospital in Istanbul Baloukli, he followed his father’s words, to make his life’s goal the works and not the money. It’s no wonder that a road to Istanbul has been named after his father, who died in 2004, having completed 65 years of devotion to patients. “A man, who could cure any disease” as the Turks say even today!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nweb.engr.utexas.edu/che/directories/faculty/peppas.cfm\n\nNicholas A.
