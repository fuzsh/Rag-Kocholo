        "text": "Giorgos Konstadinou also known as Giorgos Konstantinou, (Greek: Γιώργος Κωνσταντίνου) born October 27 1934 in Athens is a popular Greek actor and director. His career success was boosted and critically changed after the notorious \"Profiterol\" sketch and reached his pinnacle at the retro comedy film THE...Kopanoi. However after that era, tired and unable to express any innovative skills, he resorted in acting and directing an ample number of theater plays widely considered debacles. Still, he exhibited true strength and tenacity by surviving in the TV and theater scene for all these years.\n\nFilmography\n\nMovies\n\n*\"I Liza kai i alli\" 1961\n\n*\"Oi Ginaikes theloun ksilo\" 1962\n\n*\"O Antras tis ginaikas mou\" 1962\n\n*\"Trelloi politeleias\" 1963\n\n*\"Merikoi to Protimoun Kryo\" 1963\n\n*\"Ktipokardia sto thranio\" 1963\n\n*\"Oi Kathos prepei\" 1963\n\n*\"To Gelio vgike apo ton paradiso\" 1963\n\n*\"O Filos mou o Lefterakis\" 1963\n\n*\"Afto to kati allo\" 1963\n\n*\"I Soferina\" 1964\n\n*\"Nichtoperpatimata\" 1964\n\n*\"Gamos ala ellinika\" 1964\n\n*\"O Eaftoulis mou\" 1964\n\n*\"I de gini na fovite ton andra\" 1965\n\n*\"0 Anthropos gia oles tis douleies\" 1966 \"(Also Directed)\"\n\n*\"5000 psemata\" 1966 \"(Also Directed)\"\n\n*\"Kalos ilthe to dollario\" 1967\n\n*\"Ziliara\" 1968\n\n*\"Xipna Vassili\" 1969\n\n*\"Ginaikokratia\" 1972\n\n*\"Boom Taratatzoum\" 1972\n\n*\"Kathenas me tin trella tou\" 1980\n\n*\"Gefsi apo Ellada!\" 1980\n\n*\"THE...Kopanoi\" 1987 \"(Also Directed)\"\n\n*\"O Diavolos kai to kerato tou\" 1989 \"(Also Directed)\"\n\n*\"Kafta thrania\" 1990 \"(Also Directed)\"\n\nTelevision"
