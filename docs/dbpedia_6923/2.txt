Philip (Giorgos Constantinou), a shy and dignified accountant and English teacher, lives with his mother (Zoli Garbi) and his two siblings in the same house. His and his mother's meager income, just enough to support them all. His younger brother (Alekos Tzanetakos) remains unemployed and lazy rather out of conscience, while his older brother, Kimon (Orpheus Zachos), dreams of being re-elected prefect and refuses, although a qualified accountant, to work, considering the positions demeaning and irrelevant offered to him. His tragic financial situation will be further burdened by their imminent forced move to another house.

It is also the first color Greek film, edited entirely in Greece. It is based on the play "The 6th American Fleet" by Alek Sakellarios and Christos Giannakopoulos, who also wrote the screenplay, while Sakellarios directed the film.
