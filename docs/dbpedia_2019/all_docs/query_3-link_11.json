        "text": "Today is my first official day as the Editor-in-Chief of CityBeat.\n\nOn Friday, former CityBeat Editor-in-Chief Maija Zummo passed the symbolic torch on to me. Since taking on the role of Editor-in-Chief in 2018, Maija had been a champion of local journalism, alternative newsweeklies and Cincinnati. More remarkably, Maija had been a part of CityBeat’s small-but-mighty team in several different capacities since 2006. Under her leadership, CityBeat expanded its digital presence and implemented several changes to revolutionize the alt-weekly’s coverage and impact. Suffice it to say, these are big shoes to fill.\n\nAs a writer and editor for multiple publications, including the Dayton Daily News and Dayton.com, I understand the importance of local journalism. Now, perhaps more than ever, people are relying on journalists to help them understand the ever-changing world around them. I feel incredibly lucky to be leading the editorial effort at one of Cincinnati’s most beloved publications. CityBeat has been around since 1994, a feat that is impressive given that the changing landscape of local journalism has especially affected alt-weeklies.\n\nNow, just a little bit about me. I was raised in Tipp City, a suburb located just outside of Dayton. From a young age, I was completely enamored with this special corner of Ohio. As I mentioned, I worked as a journalist for Dayton.com and the Dayton Daily News, covering arts and culture, food and dining and human interest stories in the Miami Valley and Cincinnati. I was also the Editor-in-Chief of the now-shuttered Dayton City Paper, an alt-weekly based in Dayton that was a beloved fixture in the community before it ceased publication in 2018. In many different capacities over the years, I have been an advocate for independent reporting in southwest Ohio.\n\nOf course, I would be remiss for failing to acknowledge the many important people who will be by my side, helping to extend CityBeat’s legacy. These people include Managing Editor Allison Babka, Digital Content Editor Maggy McDonel, Calendar Editor/Writer Sean M. Peters and a team of talented freelancers.\n\nI am incredibly excited to be the new Editor-in-Chief and will do everything in my power to preserve CityBeat's legacy. As someone who consumes content from alternative newsweeklies almost obsessively, this new role is a dream come true.\n\nHave a compelling story idea? Interested in freelancing for CityBeat? Or perhaps you simply want to reach out and say hello? Feel free to send me an email at [email protected] with any sort of editorial inquiry. Thank you, CityBeat readers! I look forward to bringing you more important content in the future.\n\nStay connected with CityBeat.
