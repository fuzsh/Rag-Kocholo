        "text": "A popular Ohio weatherman is facing calls for his firing after his family was allegedly involved in a caught-on-camera road rage incident that left an elderly couple badly beaten with bruises, cuts and concussions.\n\nWCPO Chief Meteorologist Steve Raleigh was allegedly filmed in a brawl on June 22 after his son Carter failed to yield to traffic in the parking lot of a local restaurant, causing their Cadillac Escalade to plow into 79-year-old Douglas Nathaniel Morrow’s Ford F-150, Cincinnati’s City Beat reported.\n\nThe minor collision into Morrow’s truck quickly turned violent after a “large fight” broke out, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported, citing 911 calls.\n\nChaotic video of the brutal assault, which left Morrow, his 76-year-old wife and son badly beaten, was shared on Facebook by his daughter, Stacie Morrow-Stickrod, who wrote, “These were locally famous people and in my opinion believe they are above the law.”\n\nA man and a woman can be seen lying on the ground in the clip as someone begs, “Please, she’s bleeding. She’s bleeding.”\n\nThe frantic footage also shows men shoving each other as Red Sox legend Kevin Youkilis, who happened to be dining at the restaurant and rushed in to stop the violence yells, “Are you serious? He hit a f–king woman!”\n\nMorrow-Stickrod wrote in her July 10 post that her father had called the police after the minor accident because “he suspected [the suspects] had been drinking (because of the smell of alcohol.”\n\n“This set off the people causing my brother and both my parents to be attacked,” she said, noting her mother took the brunt of the injuries.\n\n“She was knocked unconscious and had a concussion, fractured skull, bleeding on the brain, contusion on the back of her head that was stapled shut and the lens that was put in her eye was detached and needs replaced,” she said.\n\nHer mother also had cuts and bruises covering her arms and legs, she wrote, adding that her father suffered a concussion and was knocked unconscious in the vicious attack.\n\nYoukilis, who intervened in the dispute and “saved” Morrow-Stickrod’s mother, according to her Facebook post, also took to social media to clarify that he did not know any of the individuals involved in the dispute.\n\n“Unfortunately, I was a little too late and saw a horrible chain of events unfold. My intentions after what I witnessed was to help the two individuals on the ground and to protect anyone else from being harmed,” he wrote. “I snapped a little bit after what I saw and used some colorful language in the video.”\n\nPolice have not verified the identity of anyone in the video, though Raleigh’s employer confirmed his family was involved in the alleged beatdown.\n\n“We are aware of the incident involving Steve Raleigh’s family,” WCPO Vice President and General Manager Jeff Brogan wrote. “It is still under investigation, and at this time no charges have been filed against anyone.”\n\nSocial media users, including attorney Eric Deters, alleged that one of the men in the video appears to be Raleigh.\n\nSince the altercation, Raleigh has deleted all of his social media accounts.\n\nPosts on the TV station’s Facebook page were flooded with comments from local viewers calling for Raleigh’s firing, with one angered watcher writing, “The real scam is WCPO with covering up the beatdown of the elderly couple at the Boathouse.”\n\nThe incident remains under investigation by the Cincinnati Police Department."
