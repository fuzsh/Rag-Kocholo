        "text": "Ohio's famous basket-shaped building is getting a second lease on life.\n\nThe Newark, Ohio, site — former headquarters of the basket-making company The Longaberger Co. — will soon become a luxurious new hotel.\n\nThe nearly 22-acre property and roadside attraction, completed in 1997, is world famous for, well, looking like a basket. And soon the seven-story building, which already comes equipped with a fitness center, an auditorium, a restaurant and even a fully-stocked pond, should easily transition into a destination hotel.\n\nCanton-based developer Steve Coon, who bought the property in 2017 for $1.2 million along with Cleveland partner Bobby George, helped announce the new plans for the building Monday night.\n\nThe building was for sale last year, before going off the market. Take an inside tour of the building as it stood last year right here. The whole new hotel makeover is set to be revealed sometime next year.\n\nThis article first appeared at clevescene.com."
