        "text": "Is Cincinnati the best city in Ohio? We don’t know, but based on U.S. Census data, it sure looks like other Ohioans dig us.\n\nData-storytelling website Stacker recently examined Census data for 2014 to 2018 to see which metro areas people were moving to and from throughout the nation.\n\nIn its December report, Stacker finds that more residents from Dayton, Columbus and Cleveland moved to the Queen City during those four years than from any other city. 7,016 people moved from Dayton to Cincinnati between 2014 and 2018, while 6,742 came from Columbus and 2,717 hailed from Cleveland during that period.\n\nOutside of Ohio, the Louisville region sent the most people to Cincinnati, with 1,995 moving here during those four years. Chicago was next on the list with 1,983.\n\nBut of course, population changes don’t happen in a vacuum, so Cincinnati forked over a few of its own citizens to other metros. According to Stacker’s research, 5,941 Cincinnatians moved to Columbus between 2014 and 2018, followed by 5,484 to Dayton and 2,495 to Lexington.\n\nAnd where do the fewest Cincinnatians want to move? Apparently Lima, Philadelphia, and Charleston, South Carolina. What, nobody loves veterans’ monuments, “Rocky” or miles of shoreline?"
