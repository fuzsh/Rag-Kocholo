        "text": "We’re back! And so excited to begin offering in-person classes again at The Cooking School in Jungle Jim’s at the Fairfield location.\n\nWe have used our time off to make some changes in the school and with our classroom experience.\n\nClass size is smaller. We added three new hands-on workstations, and you will now work in groups of two people instead of four. The total number of students in hands-on classes will now be 10-12. Each group of two prepares the entire menu.\n\nThe tables in the center of the school have been replaced with Jungle’s mom’s dining room and kitchen tables and chairs. Hands-on participants will be welcome to sit at the tables and enjoy the food they have prepared in class.\n\nDemonstration classes will be limited to 12 people sitting at the counter. Wine tastings will be a combination of counter and table seats.\n\nThe schedule of classes will now be available online only. Registration can be completed online or by calling the school at 513-674-6059. Gift certificates must be redeemed by calling the school.\n\nPlanning has begun for the 2022 annual trips to Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna. Watch the website for more information. We hope to begin registration in November or December.\n\nA special thanks to those who supported us by participating in virtual classes for the last year. It was nice to connect with both new and familiar faces while preparing a nice meal.\n\nWe’re looking forward to Fall classes and hope to see you back at the cooking school soon! Contact us anytime with questions."
