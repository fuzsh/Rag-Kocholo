Cincinnati — Porkopolis, the Queen City, birthplace of goetta, the nation’s largest Oktoberfest, Jerry Springer — the city we love and the place we live, work and play.

CityBeat serves as a bastion of informed analysis, offering engaging, enlightening and entertaining writing and reporting from an award-wining staff of journalists, newshounds, critics and columnists. Our news team diligently works to uncover and analyze important issues facing the community, including politics, race, gender, human rights and quality of life issues, while our arts and culture sections offer a broad look at innovative projects and the individuals behind them. CityBeat’s writers bring their institutional knowledge of the city to bear on these issues and countless others — in witty, engaging and often irreverent style.

We have always encouraged readers to discover new aspects of Cincinnati — from rave-worthy restaurants and provocative theater to craft cocktail bars and modern attractions. This philosophy is reflected in our Events Division, which connects our audience with each other, with advertisers and with the community.
