        "text": "A lot of the time, the most effectively frightening horror movies scare the bejesus out of us by acting as metaphors for deep-seated human fears, whether it’s the anxiety of parenthood, financial insecurity or the grief of losing a loved one. Sometimes, though, a movie is horrifying because, well, it really happened to someone.\n\nSuch is this case with these films, all of which have some kernel of truth behind them – or, in some instances, a lot of kernels. In these 15 terrifying movies based on actual events, details may be embellished, but they hew close enough to the real incidents that telling yourself ‘it’s just a movie’ won’t be enough to stop your spine from tingling and your pulse from racing – or, for the bigger scaredy cats out there, from hyperventilating into a paper bag. Don’t worry, though. Remember, it is just a movie… for you.\n\nRecommended:"
