By engaging with a variety of authentic cultural materials (short literary texts, video blogs featuring native speakers, newspaper articles, online content, etc.), students will develop their comprehension skills as well as their skills of spoken and written expression. Where the early stages of language learning prioritize the communication of information, you will now learn structures and strategies for expressing your own opinions, experiences, and interpretations. Integrated skill development, functional communicative proficiency, and cultural awareness are the chief goals of the course. German is the main language of instruction. GERM 203 uses a free online platform customized to Binghamton University, instead of a textbook that needs to be purchased.\n\nWL3\n\nGERM 281A: The Nazi State\n\nHarald Zils\n\nThis course examines Germany between 1933 and 1939, the organization and internal workings of the National Socialist government and administration. Topics include the permanent crisis of the Weimar Republic, the rise of the NSDAP, the Nazi takeover of power, party structures, the Gleichschaltung of administration, society, economy and media, the persecution of minorities, the situation of workers and farmers, the role of the churches, etc. The course uses a broad social science approach to comprehend instruments of domination and power and to understand “how it all could happen”; the emphasis is on structures rather than events. Methodologically, the focus of this course is on the interpretation of documents and other sources. The course is taught in English. Textbook: Bendersky, A Concise History of Nazi Germany, 5th edition\n\nH,N\n\nGERM 281B: Nature, Imagination, & Aesthetics\n\nAlexander Sorenson\n\nHow have understandings of nature shaped art and philosophy in modern times, and how have art and philosophy shaped our ideas about nature? This course examines the role of nature as both a subject and an object of artistic and philosophical production in European culture from roughly 1800 to the present. Focusing primarily on material from the German-speaking world, but also drawing upon other cultural and linguistic contexts, the class will explore how the natural world is something that has not only been represented and thought about, but that has also actively shaped these processes of representation and theorization. Materials will include works by figures such as: J.W. Goethe, S.T. Coleridge, F.W.J Schelling, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Annette von Droste-Hülshoff, Emily Dickinson, Rainer Maria Rilke, Hannah Arendt, Luce Irigaray, and Werner Herzog.\n\nH,O\n\nGERM 281C: Cold War Science Fictions\n\nCarl Gelderloos\n\nThis course explores science fiction literature and film from both sides of the “Iron Curtain” during the Cold War (1945–1990ish). By situating these works within their cultural and geopolitical contexts, we will learn how science fiction constituted a unique paradigm for understanding—and critiquing—modern society, whether of the capitalist or state socialist variety. How did science fiction, as the cultural form most associated with progress and the future, provide a novel perspective on an era marked both by the ecstasy of the space race and the terror of nuclear annihilation? Conversely, how did the context of the Cold War shape the imagination of what kinds of human futures were likely, possible, desirable, or inevitable? And what might these works help us understand about our own relationship to the future? Topics include the space race; fears and excitement about technology; utopia and dystopia; labor, the human, and the cyborg; aliens and the imagination of difference; SF as gender critique. We’ll read novels, short stories, and essays by writers such as Ursula Le Guin, Samuel Delany, Philip K. Dick, Joanna Russ, Stanisław Lem, the Strugatsky brothers, Ivan Efremov, Fredric Jameson, and view films such as Solaris, Dr. Strangelove, and Blade Runner.\n\nH, W\n\nGERM 281J: Marx, Nietzsche, Freud\n\nRebecca Schäfer, Tim Schmidt\n\nTo participate in pressing debates concerning politics, philosophy, economy, psychology, ethics, or the relationship between intellectual life and society, it is necessary to have a basic grasp of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud. This writing-intensive and discussion-based seminar introduces students to “these three masters of suspicion” (Ricoeur) whose work has had such profound global effects on modern thought, practice, and society for over a century. The course’s focus is on short texts or excerpts from longer texts, which serve as an introduction to key concepts, questions, methods, and moves of their work. Although Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud mark very different moments in the history of philosophy and theory, they all share a suspicion that, when it comes to human beings, things are usually not what they seem. How we arrange our economic life, how we understand ethical codes and moral systems, how we understand even our own understanding, our mental life, our motivation, and our desires: none of these questions, for Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud, are as self-evident as they seem. This class will accordingly explore how these three thinkers pursued the hidden structures that shape human life.\n\nC, H\n\nGERM 305: Texts & Contexts I\n\nCarl Gelderloos\n\nIn this course we’ll be building on the work you’ve done in previous German courses in order to take your German skills—your speaking, listening, writing, and reading abilities, your comprehension of the German grammatical system, and your knowledge of vocabulary—to the next level. By the end of this semester, you should feel comfortable and capable reading and analyzing German news articles, short prose texts, and social media content; you will be able to watch, understand, and discuss contemporary German films, and your written German will branch out beyond communicating facts, experiences, and opinions (though these will remain important), allowing you to analyze, interpret, and persuade. When listening to German radio, podcasts, news, movies, or songs, you won’t catch every word, but you should be able to understand the gist and main points, especially on listening to it a second time. In conversation with native speakers of German, you’ll be able to hold your own, and communicate information, perspectives, and experiences beyond the basic facts of your biography. At this point in your German language journey, you should be getting increasingly comfortable with communicative repair and circumlocution in German, i.e., figuring out a way to understand your interlocutor and make yourself understood by them in situations when communication breaks down or you can’t find the right word. To do this, you will need to develop and refine your study habits and learning strategies. In this class, we will be researching current events in Germany, watching recent German films, and reading short literary texts published in the past few decades. Assignments will include presentations, regular short written homework, regular grammar homework, and longer analytical papers; there will be quizzes, tests, and spoken tests to help you solidify and expand your knowledge of grammar and vocabulary. We will use our class time for discussion, practice, review, exploring new topics, and other things; a regular rhythm of assignments is designed to help you keep on top of the work. German is the language of instruction. Prerequisite: GERM 204 or permission of instructor.\n\nGERM 380E: Jews in German Literature\n\nHarald Zils\n\nThis course examines the complex interplay between Jewish identity and German culture from the Enlightenment through the 21st century. It considers how Jewish figures have been represented in various literary genres and periods, and how Jewish writers have shaped the German literary landscape. We will analyze texts by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Heinrich Heine, Else Lasker-Schüler, and contemporary authors. The course includes critical reading of primary texts alongside secondary scholarly analyses, fostering an understanding of the historical and cultural dynamics that influenced the literary depiction of Jews in Germany. We will focus on literary responses to significant historical events, including Emancipation, the rise of antisemitism, the Holocaust, and the re-unification of Germany. Course taught in English.\n\nH,O\n\nCourses crosslisted with German\n\nGERM 180C: Yiddish I\n\nGina Glasman\n\nYiddish I is the first semester of the Yiddish language course sequence and is intended for beginners. It introduces students to the Yiddish language and its culture. It emphasizes all facets of the language – comprehension, speech, reading, grammar and writing. The focus of instruction is on enabling students to develop basic skills.\n\nGERM 281D: The Fairy Tale\n\nZoja Pavlovskis-Petit\n\nStructure and meaning of fairy tales. Oral vs. literary fairy tales.

Prerequisite: successful completion of GERM 203 or permission of Director of Undergraduate Studies.\n\nGERM 281A: Fairy Tales and the Uncanny\n\nChristina Feil\n\nIn this course, we will set out on a journey through dark forests filled with monsters, fairies, magic, and princesses. The goal of this journey is to understand how these fantasies shape our everyday, “normal” reality. From being told and re-told orally, fairy tales have been invented and re-invented in folklore, literature, and modern mass media. Since fairy tales are produced in a variety of cultural settings, they introduce and structure the people’s values and beliefs, and are therefore a core part of our cultural identities. We will examine the evolution of fairy tales with selections from the Brothers Grimm, Charles Perrault, Nikolai Gogol, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Anne Sexton, but also Simone de Beauvoir and Donald Haase, among others. We will pay particular attention to the transformations during late German Romanticism towards the paranormal and uncanny. In addition, we will focus on the critical analysis of the representation of gender identities in and through fairytales. Writing—that is, drafting, revising, getting and receiving feedback—will be our main tool of analytic inquiry in this class and will require thoughtful, active participation from students.\n\nC,H\n\nGERM 281D: Queerness and Gender in Film Culture\n\nRebecca Schaefer\n\n“You can’t be what you can’t see.” – This statement by Marian Wright Edelman holds especially true for visual culture. How have images and film taught us to see, or rather to unsee, non-normative identities? How have they shaped representation and social discourse and have (re)produced concepts such as sexuality and gender—concepts which, like race, ability, or class, still constitute powerful systems of inequality in societies at large as well as in an increasingly globalized visual culture? To introduce students to representations of non-normative sexualities and gender identities in 20th and 21st century visual culture with a special emphasis on film, this course zooms in on German cinema. Mapping the emergence of (gender)queer representation throughout German filmic history, the course moves from the avantgarde filmic imagery of the Weimar Republic (1919–1933), including ANDERS ALS DIE ANDEREN (1919), with a screenplay by Jewish-German gender pioneer and sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld, and Christa Winsloe’s first-ever lesbian film MÄDCHEN IN UNIFORM (1931), to the seminal work of New German cinema icons Rainer Werner Fassbinder (FOX AND HIS FRIENDS, 1975) and Rosa von Praunheim (IT IS NOT THE HOMOSEXUAL WHO IS PERVERSE, BUT THE SOCIETY IN WHICH HE LIVES, 1970; AIDS TRILOGY, 1989/90), to the GDR’s controversial, only gay-themed film COMING OUT (1989, Heiner Carow) and Berlinale winner AIMÉE UND JAGUAR (Max Färberböck, 1999), to Germany’s new queer cinema (GLÜCK, 2021, Henrika Kull) and especially the new queer postmigrant cinema of Angelina Maccarone (FREMDE HAUT, 2005), Fatih Akin (AUF DER ANDEREN SEITE, 2007), Uisenma Borchu (SCHAU MICH NICHT SO AN, 2015), and Faraz Shariat (FUTUR DREI, 2020). While examining how this vibrant visual archive has articulated radical critiques of and alternatives to the heteronormative film culture of the mainstream, the male gaze etc., the course will especially highlight how directors increasingly articulate queerness intersectionally; relating it to questions of (post)migration, race and ethnicity, nationhood and belonging, or class and ability. With its focus on visual representation, this viewing- and writing-intensive and discussion-based seminar also employs film analysis methods and aesthetic, gender, and film theory to recognize and discuss the ways in which visual culture teaches us to (un)see.No film theoretical background knowledge or previous knowledge of German culture required. Participants of all majors are welcome, as a diversity of backgrounds and majors will contribute to our discussions. Course taught entirely in English.\n\nC,D,H\n\nGERM 281G: Intro to Marx & Critical Theory\n\nCarl Gelderloos\n\n“The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.” So begins Part One of the Communist Manifesto of Marx and Engels. This sentence also stands at the beginning of a tradition in philosophy, history, and politics that places everyday human labor and struggle at the heart of historical change. This course offers an introduction to this tradition, with an emphasis on its origins in the 19th century and its development in the 20th century, particularly in the work of writers associated with the Frankfurt School. As we will see, this critical tradition draws its strength from the ways in which it considers questions of power, economy, society, and culture as inextricable from each other rather than as separate disciplines. Because it holds that cultures and ideologies cannot be understood without considering how given societies and economies are organized, the tradition of critical theory is materialist; because it highlights the importance of struggle and contradiction, it is dialectical. Topics we will consider include capitalism, revolution, utopia, mass culture, dialectical reasoning, historical materialism, the state, fascism, antifascism, and the human relationship to nature. Readings may include works by Marx, Hegel, Nietzsche, Freud, Adorno, Benjamin, Lukács, Kracauer, Brecht, and Fanon.\n\nH,N,O\n\nGERM 306: Texts & Contexts II\n\nNeil Christian Pages\n\nCourse offers students the opportunity to refine modes of expression, improve accuracy andfluency and build cultural competency in German by engaging with important trends, ideas and events in the German-speaking world. It prepares students for more advanced work in German Studies in an interdisciplinary context. Students will engage texts and images from a range of genres (literature, history, philosophy, politics film, popular culture, news media, art) to improve critical reading abilities and accuracy in writing. The course also reviews advanced grammar structures in context. Taught entirely in German. Prerequisite: GERM 305 or instructor permission.\n\nGERM 380L: Imperial Germany\n\nHarald Zils\n\nCourse taught in English -- This course takes a close look at the German Empire at the end of the 19th century: political and social structures, economic and cultural developments. We will pay particular attention to the young German nation’s attempts to find its position in an international context.\n\nH,N\n\nGERM 381Q: Kafka and His Readers\n\nNeil Christian Pages\n\nEuropean Modernism and the inspiration for the slippery idiom “Kafkaesque.” Kafka died one hundred years ago, having published just a few hundred pages of prose, but his life and work have had an abiding impact on how we think about art, interpretation and representation. Indeed, Kafka’s writing and his image have influenced not only writers (W.G. Sebald, J.M Coetzee, Jorge Luis Borges) and critics (Benjamin, Adorno, Derrida), they have also inspired illustrators and cartoonists (R. Crumb), filmmakers (Orson Wells, Michael Haneke, Steven Soderbergh) and visual and acoustic artists (Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller, Jeff Wall). While considering Kafka’s literary legacy, his academic function, his impact on thinking about representation, and the debates about the translation of his work, we will also reflect on the process of reading and interpretation generally and think about what literature does and the ways in which literary criticism works.\n\nH,W\n\nGERM 380X: Nazi Culture\n\nHarald Zils\n\nGerman Cultural Politics, 1933-1945\n\nThe National Socialists' takeover of Germany had enormous impact on society. This included the transformation of the cultural sphere: the complete takeover of German film production by the regime; the persecution of authors, artists and intellectuals; the banning and defamation of numerous works; the Gleichschaltung of schools, universities, publishers and other cultural institutions. As part of their war of conquest, the Nazis soon wanted to control the cultural production of all of occupied Europe. The course examines the impact of the political on the cultural. What measures did the new rulers use to ensure the new direction of social discourse? How did the established institutions respond? Was there resistance – and if so, what did it look like? We analyze primary sources: Propaganda films such as \"The Eternal Forest,\" \"The Rothschilds,\" and \"I Accuse, governmental decrees and laws, public declarations such as Martin Heidegger's Rectorate speech and private diary entries of the \"inner exile,\" as well as excerpts from literary texts that carefully skirted censorship. In addition, we hear voices from exile: from politicians, authors, artists and scholars who desperately try to preserve their own, the \"other\" Germany.\n\nCourse taught in English. 4 credits.\n\nH,N\n\nCourses crosslisted with German\n\nGERM 241J: Yiddish II\n\nGina Glasman\n\nFollows on from Yiddish 101 as students sharpen their linguistic skills with more complex sentence structure, a deeper knowledge of tenses and cases, and a broader vocabulary. In addition, we explore Yiddish culture through film, stories, folk sayings and the occasional joke! As always lyrics from Yiddish popular song provide the backbone of the class, and individual attention is a feature of the instruction. Note: interested students can join 102 directly without having taken 101. (Instructor permission needed).\n\nWL1\n\nGERM 380K: Modern Yiddish Culture\n\nGina Glasman\n\nIn the half century before the Second World War, a Yiddish speaking \"Jewish Street\" stretched from Buenos Aires to Boston, from London to Lodz, with many cities in between. What characterized the culture of this mostly urban and modernizing society is the subject of this class. Cinema and short stories, poetry and politics provide our vehicle to explore the world of Eastern European Jewry in a time of radical transformation and approaching catastrophe (all material is in English). Note: If a student has already taken a 200-level version of Modern Yiddish Culture they will not receive credit for this course.\n\nGERM 480D: Photographic Fictions of Central Europe\n\nKailtlyn Sorenson\n\nLiterature from Central Europe in past years has been overwhelmingly populated by the genre of “witness literature,” or fictional narratives about factual historical traumas. These works often embed photographs—pictures of real people and places—within their fictional narratives. The course is guided by the core question of how this mixing of media—and of reality and fiction— affects the various ways in which these novels “bear witness.” This course will provide students with an introduction to critical theories of photography as well as an introduction to the contemporary literature of Central Europe.Theory: Walter Benjamin, Siegfried Kracauer, Roland Barthes, Susan Sontag, Aleš Erjavec, Susie Linfield, Dominic LaCapra, Marianne Hirsch, Slavoj Žižek, Andreas Huyssen. Literature: W.G. Sebald, Aleksandar Hemon, Dubravka Ugrešić, Dušan Šarotar, Paveł Huelle, László Krasznahorkai, Menyhért Lakatos, Evgeniya Belorusets\n\nGERM 481B: Enlightenment and Empire\n\nGiovanna Montenegro\n\nEver wondered what the Enlightenment was and why it matters? Are you interested in reading foundational texts of critical theory? The Enlightenment is often discussed as one of the most important movements of Western history that has continued to shape our intellectual and political lives. This seminar will investigate Enlightenment texts and images and will study the movement’s cosmopolitan and global aftermath through its effect on colonialism and Empire. We will discuss essays and treatises from the political, literary, and aesthetic concerns of the French, German, and British Enlightenment such as Immanuel Kant’s and Moses Mendelssohn’s essay responses to the question “What is Enlightenment?”; entries from Diderot’s and D’Alembert’s massive Encyclopedie; Rousseau’s Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men; Montesquieu’s Persian Letters and other works. We will also debate how racism, slavery and abolition in the Caribbean and Latin America, religious freedom, orientalism, cosmopolitanism, globality, and independence are promoted, debated, or criticized in Enlightenment works. Finally, we will finish with recent 20th- and 21st-century critiques and adaptations of Enlightenment such as Susan Buck-Morss’s work on Hegel and Haiti as well as Alejo Carpentier. Seminar discussions will be complemented with trips to the University Library’s Special Collections. 4 credits\n\nGERM 489A: German Reading for Research\n\nThis course is intended for upper-level students of German interested in advancing their knowledge of reading and translation. Students work independently and in class meetings to obtain high-level reading and translation ability. 1 credit\n\nGERM 101: Elementary German I\n\nJeanette Franza, Gülden Olgun\n\nAcquisition of basic grammar and vocabulary, development of reading, writing and speaking skills in an interactive learning environment, introduction to cross-cultural communication.

From the founding of the first German nation state in 1871 to the emergence of Expressionism in painting, to the ’golden’ age of Weimar culture, to the Nazi state and the Shoah, to the division of Germany into two states with competing ideological systems in the wake of World War II, course engages events and ideas that inform contemporary German culture and its memories and identities. We will look at art and architecture, photography and film, read about history and politics and engage literary and aesthetic approaches to German cultural history in order to gain an understanding of contemporary Germany and the Germans. Readings and discussions assist students in developing intercultural competencies and fluencies across genres and media while building skills in critical reading and thinking.

Student needs and preferences will help determine what areas receive special focus; this course is for all students who want to consolidate, improve, and perfect their knowledge of German grammar and their ability to use spoken and written German with accuracy and nuance. 2 credits\n\nGERM 203: Intermediate German I\n\nRebecca Schaefer\n\nHerzlich Willkommen! In this course, you’ll be further developing your German skills by using them, as much as possible, in different ways: speaking German in class in small groups, whole-class discussion, or in partner work; exercising your reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills, as well as your knowledge of grammar, vocabulary, and German culture by doing activities on the textbook’s online platform; independently studying and practicing according to your individual needs; and seeking to expand your German abilities and level of comfort with the language by exploring German-language materials – movies & TV shows on Netflix, songs, podcasts, YouTube videos, newspaper and magazine articles, etc. – outside of class. By the end of the semester, if you put in the work, time, and dedication, you’ll find that you are able to use your German for so many more things than you could at the beginning of the semester: at the end of 203, students from previous classes have been able to navigate and understand German news sites, enjoy German movies and television, discover new music in German, and even study abroad at a German or Austrian university. Where the early stages of language learning prioritize the communication of information, you will now learn structures and strategies for expressing your own opinions, experiences, and interpretations. Integrated skill development, functional communicative proficiency, and cultural awareness are the chief goals of the course. German is the main language of instruction. GERM 101, 102, and 203 use a free online platform customized to Binghamton University, instead of a textbook that needs to be purchased. Prerequisites: GERM 102 or equivalent, or consent of instructor.\n\nWL3\n\nGERM 241J: Marx, Nietzsche, Freud\n\nTim Schmidt\n\nTo participate in pressing debates concerning politics, philosophy, economy, psychology, ethics, or the relationship between intellectual life and society, it is necessary to have a basic grasp of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud. This writing-intensive and discussion-based seminar introduces students to “these three masters of suspicion” (Ricoeur) whose work has had such profound global effects on modern thought, practice, and society for over a century. The course’s focus is on short texts or excerpts from longer texts, which serve as an introduction to key concepts, questions, methods, and moves of their work. Although Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud mark very different moments in the history of philosophy and theory, they all share a suspicion that, when it comes to human beings, things are usually not what they seem. How we arrange our economic life, how we understand ethical codes and moral systems, how we understand even our own understanding, our mental life, our motivation, and our desires: none of these questions, for Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud, are as self-evident as they seem. This class will accordingly explore how these three thinkers pursued the hidden structures that shape human life. C, H\n\nGERM 241K: Learning to See: Art & Media in Weimar Germany\n\nCarl Gelderloos\n\nFrom the movies we watch to the advertisements we see, from the way we understand images to the fonts we use, the vibrant legacy of modern culture in the 1920s and 1930s continues to influence the way we use and think about media, art, technology, and communication. Drawing on richly innovative visual artworks and groundbreaking theoretical texts, this course explores the visual culture of the Weimar Republic (1919–1933) with a special emphasis on film, photography, and montage. Visual media played a central role in the cultural production and aesthetic and political debates of the time: the rise of the cinema provoked an unparalleled reexamination of the relationship between art, technology, and society, while the rapid expansion of photography into newspapers and other mass media helped spark diverse discussions of aesthetics, perception, and individuality. Why did visual media and discussions about them play such a central role in the cultural and political ferment of modern culture between two world wars? How did new visual media and technologies help contemporaries rethink other, non-visual media such as literature and aesthetic representation more generally? Why were debates about photography and film often so politically charged? In what ways did Weimar culture draw on new technologies to see and depict processes of modernization, urbanization, and industrialization with new eyes? These are the questions we will explore in this class.\n\nThis course requires no background knowledge of aesthetic or media theory, nor of German culture. Participants of all majors are welcome. Indeed, the key role played throughout the humanities by the texts and works we’ll be looking at means that the seminar will be inherently interdisciplinary, and a diversity of backgrounds and majors will contribute to our discussions.\n\nA,H,W\n\nGERM 241N: The Nazi State\n\nHarald Zils\n\nThe course looks at Germany between 1933 and 1939, at the organization and inner functioning of the Nazi government and administration. Topics include the Nazi rise to power, party structures, \"Gleichschaltung\" of society, economy, and media, persecution of minorities, the situation of workers and peasants, the role of the churches etc. Two midterms, one final. Course taught in English.\n\nH,N\n\nGERM 281A: Migrant & Minority Voices in Popular Culture\n\nGülden Olgun\n\nWhat does it mean to be a migrant or a minority in society? How do the presence of migrants and minorities challenge a society's self-understanding? Conversely, what do migrant and minoritized positionalities entail for members of these groups—how do they understand and identify their own cultures and their location among cultures? How do they remix the very concepts of identity, belonging, and culture? Because the U.S. American context is most familiar to most Binghamton students, we can get a new view of these questions by globalizing our view. This course will explore the example of Germany: what does it mean to be \"German\"? Authors, poets, filmmakers, and musicians with a migration background challenge stereotypes about what Germans look like, their traditions, their language, and what it means to be German, coming up with their own answer to the question of how to live, survive, and thrive in a country that often struggles to create inclusive spaces for people of diverse backgrounds. In this writing- and discussion-intensive seminar, we will listen to the voices of Turkish-Germans, German and Russian Jews, Afro-Germans, Syrian-Germans, Japanese-Germans, Ukrainian-Germans, Iraqi-Germans, refugees, and others through their literary works, films, music, and performing arts. No prerequisites; course taught in English.\n\nC,G,H\n\nGERM 305: Texts & Contexts I\n\nCarl Gelderloos\n\nThis course is intended to expand your German language skills beyond the functional areas of information exchange, description and narration. By developing integrated language skills through reading, writing, learning grammatical principles and applying these in short essays, focused tasks and presentations, the course will enable you to develop more advanced language skills in oral and written communication. By reading and interpreting a variety of literary and cultural texts, viewing films and working with media online, you will develop your comprehension and the ability to express your opinions and interpretations. Integrated skill development including a basic mastery of grammatical form, functional proficiency and cultural awareness are major goals of the course; ordinarily German is the language of instruction. The proactive use of learning strategies in language learning and continuing reflection on them are important to your learning. Course work emphasizes the most frequently used grammatical structures but focuses also on activities designed to lead to advanced proficiency by broadening your vocabulary and linguistic resources in German. General grammatical topics will be introduced and studied regularly through tasks and exercises assigned to all learners; however, most work will support the individual development of greater accuracy, fluency and complexity through feedback given on numerous short writing samples and oral reports. It is expected that students will be listening every day to German broadcasts and will be doing on-line and off-line work. Prerequisite: Germ 204 or permission of instructor.\n\nGERM 380S: Germany in the 1960’s\n\nHarald Zils\n\nThis course looks at German society in the 1960s, using three focal points:\n\n— Jerusalem/Frankfurt: The trial of Adolf Eichmann and the Auschwitz trials bring to light what had long been buried: German crimes in World War II and the Holocaust. Reactions range from disbelief and rejection to helpless despair at being confronted with historical reality. For the first time, a public confrontation with this part of German history happens, and attempts are made to find a language and rules for this new discourse.\n\n— Berlin: The building of the Wall in 1961 seals the division of Germany; in 1965, a new beginning for a utopian, alternative East Germany seems possible.\n\n— Frankfurt, Berlin; Berkeley; Paris: In West Germany and elsewhere, students take to the streets. They demand a different republic: away with the old customs and faces, in with more personal freedom, with more democracy and more commitment to an unconditional peace. They fail, and they succeed. A new concept of the public sphere is born – and many of its problems, from \"wokeness\" to \"betrayal\" by veterans, sound familiar today... what can we learn from this for our own political dealings with each other? W,N,O\n\nGERM 380V: Vienna 1900: Modernism & Empire\n\nNeil Christian Pages\n\nCourse explores the ideas, impulses and implosions that accompanied the rise of Modernism in Vienna around 1900. Like the multicultural, multi-ethnic empire of which it was the capital, the culture of Habsburg Vienna at the fin-de-siècle was marked by fragmentation, experimentation and contestation. Struggles with politics, identities and aesthetics generated new ways of thinking (Freudian psychoanalysis), political movements (Zionism; Marxism; fascism), radical experiments with art and architecture (Klimt, Schiele, Loos, Bauer, Schönberg) and a lasting literary legacy (Schnitzler, Musil, von Hofmannsthal, Trakl, Roth, Kraus, Zweig). By engaging specific works (buildings, paintings, texts) across disciplines, students will develop skills in reading and interpretation and gain an understanding of the cultural history of “Vienna 1900” specifically and theories of Modernism generally. We will also question how eras and cultural legacies are constructed and how cultures of memory are reflected in works of art, in historiography and in literary works.\n\nA, H, T, W\n\nCourses crosslisted with German\n\nGERM 180C: Yiddish I\n\nGina Glasman\n\nYiddish 101 is the first semester of the Yiddish language course sequence and is intended for beginners. It introduces students to the Yiddish language and its culture. It emphasizes all facets of the language – comprehension, speech, reading, grammar and writing. The focus of instruction is on enabling students to develop basic skills.\n\nG, O, WL1\n\nGERM 180B: Yiddish II\n\nGina Glasman\n\nFollows on from Yiddish I as students sharpen their linguistic skills with more complex sentence structure, a deeper knowledge of tenses and cases, and a broader vocabulary. In addition, we explore Yiddish culture through film, stories, folk sayings and the occasional joke! As always lyrics from Yiddish popular song provide the backbone of the class, and individual attention is a feature of the instruction. Note: interested students can join Yiddish II directly without having taken Yiddish I (Instructor permission needed).\n\nWL2\n\nGERM 241D: The Fairy Tale\n\nZoja Pavlovskis-Petit\n\nStructure and meaning of fairy tales. Oral vs. literary fairy tales. Different approaches to interpreting fairy tales: anthropological, psychological, socio-historical, structuralist. Lectures approximately once a week; discussion; take-home midterm and final exams; two 10-page papers.\n\nH,W\n\nGERM 101: Elementary German I\n\nRebecca Schaefer\n\nAcquisition of basic grammar and vocabulary, development of reading, writing and speaking skills in an interactive learning environment, introduction to cross-cultural communication. Introduces students to German culture and to cultural interdependencies between German-speaking countries and the U.S. At the end of the German 101/102 sequence, students will understand the basic structures of the German language. They will be able to interact with native speakers of German in simple everyday situations. German 101/102 count toward Harpur College's foreign language requirement. Students who satisfy the Foreign Language requirement will demonstrate basic proficiency in the understanding and use of a foreign language; and knowledge of the distinctive features of cultures(s) associated with the languages they are studying. Not for native speakers. Not open to students who have passed the high school German Regents examination within the past three years. Meets four times per week; grades based on quizzes, chapter tests, in-class compositions, class participation and special assignments.

First step in expansion of German language skills beyond functional areas of information exchange, description and narration. By reading and responding to a variety of stimulating texts (modern fiction, lyrics, newspaper articles, historical texts, film clips), students develop both comprehension skills and the ability to express and support their own opinions and interpretations. Equal emphasis on both spoken and written expression. Includes review of more complex grammatical structures and activities designed to broaden vocabulary resources.\n\nGERM 221: German in Conversation\n\nRebecca Schaefer\n\nInformal instruction and practice in colloquial German. Primarily for students who have completed GERM 102. Discussion based on variety of cultural, commercial and some technical materials provides practice in more advanced conversational speech patterns and vocabulary.\n\nGERM 241CP: The German Road Movie\n\nEric Mattina\n\nThis course will examine the road movie as defined and explored predominantly by German New Wave director Wim Wenders from his informally named 70s “Road Trilogy” to his “ultimate road movie” epic Until the End of the World in 1991. Using Wenders’ themes of travel, displacement, and journey through these post-war and post-Nazi landscapes as an origin point, this course will travel through other New Wave directors' own interpretations of the road narrative, consider both the influences of thematic preoccupations and stylistic choices on film makers within and outside of Germany, and conclude with contemporary German film makers’ approaches to the genre. Course taught in English.\n\nH, W\n\nGERM 241W: Cold War Science Fictions\n\nYijun Liu\n\nThis course explores science fiction literature and film from both sides of the “Iron Curtain” during the Cold War (1945–1990ish). By situating these works within their cultural and geopolitical contexts, we will learn how science fiction constituted a unique paradigm for understanding – and critiquing – modern society, whether of the capitalist or state socialist variety. How did science fiction, as the cultural form most associated with progress and the future, provide a novel perspective on an era marked both by the ecstasy of the space race and the terror of nuclear annihilation? Conversely, how did the context of the Cold War shape the imagination of what kinds of human futures were likely, possible, desirable, or inevitable? And what might these works help us understand about our own relationship to the future? Topics include the space race; fears and excitement about technology; utopia and dystopia; labor, the human, and the cyborg; aliens and the imagination of difference; SF as gender critique. We’ll read novels, short stories, and essays by writers such as Ursula Le Guin, Samuel Delany, Philip K. Dick, Joanna Russ, Stanisław Lem, the Strugatsky brothers, Ivan Efremov, Fredric Jameson, and view films such as Solaris, Dr. Strangelove, and Blade Runner. Course taught in English.\n\nH, W\n\nGERM 306: Texts & Contexts II\n\nNeil Christian Pages\n\nTexts and Contexts II: GERM 306 offers students the opportunity to refine modes of expression, improve accuracy and fluency and build cultural competency in German by engaging with important trends, ideas and events in the German-speaking world. It prepares students for more advanced work in German Studies in an interdisciplinary context. Students will engage texts and images from a range of genres (literature, history, philosophy, politics film, popular culture, news media, art) to improve critical reading abilities and accuracy in writing. The course also reviews advanced grammar structures in context. Taught entirely in German. Prerequisite: GERM 305 or instructor permission.\n\nGERM 380I: Post-War Germany\n\nHarald Zils\n\nAfter Germany's defeat in 1945, the country, divided into four, then two parts by the victorious allies, found itself in political, moral, intellectual and economic crisis. In the midst of the Cold War, German societies in east and west had to choose whether to come to terms with the past in order to make decisions for the future; or to silence public discourse and to suppress memories in favor of a truce for the present. The course will focus on four decisive years: 1945; 1949; 1956; and 1961. Course taught in English.\n\nH, W\n\nGERM 380O: The Art of Exile\n\nNeil Christian Pages\n\nWhat does it mean to lose one’s home, to be uprooted from a ‘native’ language and culture and to look for a home elsewhere? What does it mean for the self to be ‘at home’ in the first place? This course explores those questions through the figure of the exile, émigré and refugee. Its focus is the life and work of writers, intellectuals and visual artists who fled Nazi Germany in and after 1933. We will consider how this particular historical moment informs contemporary debates on migration and integration, human rights and the relationship between the artist and the state. Course materials include literary works, historiography, film and visual culture. Course taught in English.\n\nH\n\nGERM 380T: Turkish-German Culture\n\nGülden Olgun\n\nOne in four people in Germany now has, as it is termed, migrant background. Immigration from Turkey is probably the most prominent not only in terms of its massiveness and demographic consequences, but also for its significant role in changing Germany's overall cultural, social, political and economic landscape. This course introduces students to contemporary Turkish-German cinema in the context of Turkish labor migration to West Germany. Through analyzing selected documentary or feature films, TV serials, plays and literary works produced by Turkish-German filmmakers,writers and artists, we will discuss complex ideas like migration, ethnicity, race, religion, gender, nationality, sexual orientation and class, resorting not to oversimplifications and binary thinking but instead to relevant literary concepts and formative historical moments which have shaped the Turkish-German experience. In other words, contemporary Turkish-German filmmakers invite us to see highly contested spaces (called Germany) through the lens of the cultural Other, they try to express the “truth” of life experiences of Turkish people in the diaspora in terms of transnational filmmaking. Course taught in English.\n\nG, H, W\n\nGERM 380X: Nazi Culture\n\nHarald Zils\n\nGerman Cultural Politics, 1933–1945\n\nThe National Socialists' takeover of Germany had an enormous impact on society. This involved the transformation of the cultural sphere—the complete takeover of German film production by the regime; the persecution of authors, artists and intellectuals; the banning and defamation of numerous works; the \"Gleichschaltung\" of schools, universities, publishers and other cultural institutions. As part of their war of conquest, the Nazis soon wanted to control the cultural production of all of occupied Europe.\n\nThis course examines the impact of the political on the cultural. What measures did the new rulers use to ensure the new direction of social discourse? How did the established institutions respond? Was there resistance—and if so, what did it look like? We analyze primary sources: Propaganda films such as The Eternal Forest, The Rothschilds, and I Accuse, governmental decrees and laws, public declarations such as Martin Heidegger's Rectorate speech and private diary entries of the \"inner exile,\" as well as excerpts from literary texts that carefully skirted censorship. In addition, we hear voices from exile: from politicians, authors, artists and scholars who desperately try to preserve their own, the \"other\" Germany.\n\nCourse taught in English.\n\nH\n\nCourses crosslisted with German\n\nGERM 380K: Modern Yiddish Culture\n\nGina Glasman\n\nIn the half century before the Second World War, a Yiddish ­speaking \"Jewish Street\" stretched from Buenos Aires to Boston, from London to Łódź, with many cities in between. What characterized the culture of this mostly urban and modernizing society is the subject of this class. Cinema and short stories, poetry and politics provide our vehicle to explore the world of Eastern European Jewry in a time of radical transformation and approaching catastrophe (all material is in English). If a student has taken a 200-level version of Modern Yiddish Culture they will not receive credit for this course.\n\nGERM 381B: Hoarding & the Human Condition\n\nKaitlyn Sorenson\n\nWhy do humans hoard? What drives the impulse to accumulate objects and capital? This course examines literary and philosophical representations of money, misers, greed, and hoarding. It begins by introducing students to key theoretical approaches to the social lives of currency, such as Aristotle's objection to moneylending, Marx's notion of commodity fetishism, and Freud's diagnosis of hoarding. Using these theoretical texts as a framework, we will then survey the classical literature of avarice, including Plautus's The Pot of Gold, Dante's Inferno, Moliere's The Miser, Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, Pushkin's \"Queen of Spades,\" and Dickens's The Christmas Carol. We'll study how these narratives diagnose (and, occasionally, claim to cure) avarice before turning to more contemporary representations of greed (including the film Wall Street, the television series Hoarders, and fiction by Sylvia Townsend Warner and Imbolo Mbue).\n\nGERM 480A: Marxist Humanism\n\nKaitlyn Sorenson\n\nThis course traces the development of the leftist discourse in which Marxist philosophers critiqued the historical socialisms of the 20th century and attempted to theorize a humanist socialism, defined by its anti-dogmatic, anti-Stalinist and anti-positivist approach. The course begins with an introduction to the (predominantly Central and Eastern European) founders of “Western Marxism” (Luxemburg, Lukács, Kautsky, Korsch, Gramsci), before examining the source texts that this discourse champions (Kant, Hegel and Marx) as well as those that it rejects (Plekhanov, Stalin). The course then traces the confrontations between Humanism and Existentialism as well as Phenomenology, before examining how the project of Marxist Humanism served as a discursive anchor for a series of post-war philosophical schools (The Frankfurt School, the Yugoslav Praxis Group, the Polish School, and the Budapest School). However, at key moments, this steady march through the intellectual history of Marxist Humanism is interrupted by authors who, for a variety of theoretical and historical reasons, have been excluded from that canon, such as: Alexandra Kollontai, C.L.R. James, Raya Dunayevskaya, Roy Medvedev, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Franz Fanon, M.N. Roy and Wang Ruoshui. In addition to expanding the canon, the course also introduces students to important critics of Marxist Humanism from various points in its history (e.g., Martin Heidegger, Louis Althusser, Slavoj Žižek, N. Katherine Hayles, Donna Haraway)—and examines how these critiques of Marxist Humanism influenced a variety of alternative theoretical paradigms. The course concludes by analyzing how Cold War framings distorted this theoretical tradition and examining contemporary attempts to revive Socialist Humanism as both a theory and a praxis.\n\nGERM 101: Elementary German I\n\nJeanette Franza, Carl Gelderloos, Rebecca Schäfer, Tim Schmidt\n\nAcquisition of basic grammar and vocabulary, development of reading, writing and speaking skills in an interactive learning environment, introduction to cross-cultural communication.

From the founding of the first German nation state in 1871 to the emergence of Expressionism in painting, to the ’golden’ age of Weimar culture, to the Nazi state and the Shoah, to the division of Germany into two states with competing ideological systems in the wake of World War II, course engages events and ideas that inform contemporary German culture and its memories and identities. We will look at art and architecture, photography and film, read about history and politics and engage literary and aesthetic approaches to German cultural history in order to gain an understanding of contemporary Germany and the Germans. Readings and discussions assist students in developing intercultural competencies and fluencies across genres and media while building skills in critical reading and thinking. Taught entirely in English.\n\nW\n\nGERM 203: Intermediate German I\n\nCarl Gelderloos, Rebecca Schäfer\n\nHerzlich Willkommen!

We shall study how subversively fairy tales address the ideas, social attitudes, behavior, gender roles, power relationships and cultural evolution during absolutism, enlightenment, the French Revolution and Romanticism. We will explore the structure and meaning of tales written for adults (Kunstmärchen) by Goethe, enjoy Schikaneder/Mozart’s The Magic Flute, and read tales by Tieck, Novalis, E.T.A. Hoffmann and others, analyzing the civilizing processes depicted, as the search for the self and its development, become grand themes. Gender construction, the intersection of gender and class, the historical location of power, negotiations with authority by the rising middle class, and implications of the development of literacy will be important topics of discussion.\n\nGERM 241N: The Nazi State\n\nHarald Zils\n\nThe course looks at Germany between 1933 and 1939, at the organization and inner functioning of the Nazi government and administration. Topics include the Nazi rise to power, party structures, \"Gleichschaltung\" of society, economy, and media, persecution of minorities, the situation of workers and peasants, the role of the churches etc. Two midterms, one final. Course taught in English.\n\nH, N, W\n\nGERM 305: Texts & Contexts I\n\nRosmarie Morewedge\n\nThis course is intended to expand your German language skills beyond the functional areas of information exchange, description and narration. By developing integrated language skills through reading, writing, learning grammatical principles and applying these in short essays, focused tasks and presentations, the course will enable you to develop more advanced language skills in oral and written communication. By reading and interpreting a variety of literary and cultural texts, viewing films and working with media online, you will develop your comprehension and the ability to express your opinions and interpretations. Integrated skill development including a basic mastery of grammatical form, functional proficiency and cultural awareness are major goals of the course; ordinarily German is the language of instruction. The proactive use of learning strategies in language learning and continuing reflection on them are important to your learning. Course work emphasizes the most frequently used grammatical structures but focuses also on activities designed to lead to advanced proficiency by broadening your vocabulary and linguistic resources in German. General grammatical topics will be introduced and studied regularly through tasks and exercises assigned to all learners; however, most work will support the individual development of greater accuracy, fluency and complexity through feedback given on numerous short writing samples and oral reports.. It is expected that students will be listening every day to German broadcasts and will be doing on-line and off-line work. Prerequisite: Germ 204 or permission of instructor.\n\nGERM 380V: Vienna 1900: Modernism & Empire\n\nNeil Christian Pages\n\nCourse explores the ideas, impulses and implosions that accompanied the rise of Modernism in Vienna around 1900. Like the multicultural, multi-ethnic empire of which it was the capital, the culture of Habsburg Vienna at the fin-de-siècle was marked by fragmentation, experimentation and contestation. Struggles with politics, identities and aesthetics generated new ways of thinking (Freudian psychoanalysis), political movements (Zionism; Marxism; fascism), radical experiments with art and architecture (Klimt, Schiele, Loos, Bauer, Schönberg) and a lasting literary legacy (Schnitzler, Musil, von Hofmannsthal, Trakl, Roth, Kraus, Zweig). By engaging specific works (buildings, paintings, texts) across disciplines, students will develop skills in reading and interpretation and gain an understanding of the cultural history of “Vienna 1900” specifically and theories of Modernism generally. We will also question how eras and cultural legacies are constructed and how cultures of memory are reflected in works of art, in historiography and in literary works.\n\nA, H, W\n\nGERM 380W: Germany after the Wall\n\nHarald Zils\n\nIn 1989, the world witnessed for the fourth time in the 20th century how German society went through the greatest possible upheaval. The course examines how the fall of the Wall came about, the efforts to turn two Germanys into one, and how under these conditions the country has sought to redefine its role in the world, from the Balkan Wars to 9/11 to global migration and climate change. Course taught in English.\n\nW\n\nCourses crosslisted with German\n\nGERM 180: Yiddish I\n\nGina Glasman\n\nYiddish 101 is the first semester of the Yiddish language course sequence and is intended for beginners. It introduces students to the Yiddish language and its culture. It emphasizes all facets of the language – comprehension, speech, reading, grammar and writing. The focus of instruction is on enabling students to develop basic skills.\n\nFL1\n\nGERM 241D: The Fairy Tale\n\nZoja Pavlovskis-Petit\n\nStructure and meaning of fairy tales. Oral vs. literary fairy tales. Different approaches to interpreting fairy tales: anthropological, psychological, socio-historical, structuralist. Lectures approximately once a week; discussion; take-home midterm and final exams; two 10-page papers.\n\nH,W\n\nGERM 481C: Reformation: Religion & Society\n\nSean Dunwoody\n\nFor Hegel, it was “the all-enlightening sun” that followed upon the darkness of the Middle Ages, one that lighted the path to freedom for the World Spirit. For Marx, it was an ultimately failed revolution cooked up “in the brain of the monk,” born out of the contradictions of feudal society. For Weber, it set into motion a process that has resulted in our being trapped in the “iron cage” of modern industrialized capitalist society. For historians since, it has occasioned tremendous debate. Few events in European history can claim the central role assigned to the Reformation; few historical events have proven to be as fertile a ground for the cultivation of historiographical debates. In this seminar, we will study the major debates that have shaped the field and consider how historians continue to ask new questions with new sources. Students shall prepare for and actively participate in weekly readings. They will also be expected to prepare a research paper grounded in critical engagement of primary sources and in the light of scholarly conversations.\n\nC, N\n\nGERM 101: Elementary German I\n\nFrank Mischke\n\nAcquisition of basic grammar and vocabulary, development of reading and speaking skills, introduction to cross-cultural communication.

The Course covers the time from the early Middle Ages of Emperor Charlemagne to the high Middle Ages of King Arthur and the late Middle Ages of Solomonic diplomatic envoys of Dawit Nägäst in pre-colonial Ethiopia to European courts. We will look at depictions of global encounters in heroic tales and knightly romances—encoded as texts and visualized as movies—and learn how global interactions and global interdependencies reveal new perspectives in/on civilization, identify formation and myths of power. Course taught in English.\n\nG, H | TR 2:50–4:15\n\nGERM 181G: Intensive German Grammar\n\nAnja Salman\n\nThis course offers a thorough review of the major areas of German grammar. The course emphasizes linguistic accuracy and is designed to familiarize students with the most important aspects of German grammar at the elementary and intermediate levels, such as the major verb tenses, the cases and declinations of nouns, articles, and adjectives, word order, pronouns, and the like. Student needs and preferences will help determine what areas receive special focus; this course is for all students who want to consolidate, improve, and perfect their knowledge of German grammar and their ability to use spoken and written German with accuracy and nuance. Prerequisites: Successful completion of GERM 102 or equivalent, or instructor’s permission.\n\nGERM 203: Intermediate German I\n\nChristina Feil, Anja Salman\n\nHelps students develop ability to communicate in German beyond the basic \"survival\" level. Begins with a systematic review of German grammar that continues through the second semester at the intermediate level. Students read a series of short literary texts and work with texts taken from popular culture, as they improve their reading, writing and discussion skills. Designed especially for students who are interested in the humanities and social sciences.\n\nPrerequisites: GERM 102 or equivalent, or permission of instructor\n\nMW 1:10–2:10, TR 1:15–2:15\n\nGERM 204: Intermediate German II\n\nRosmarie Morewedge\n\nContinuation of GERM 203. First step in expansion of German language skills beyond functional areas of information exchange, description and narration. By reading and responding to a variety of stimulating texts (modern fiction, lyrics, newspaper articles, historical texts, film clips), students develop both comprehension skills and the ability to express and support their own opinions and interpretations. Equal emphasis on both spoken and written expression. Includes review of more complex grammatical structures and activities designed to broaden vocabulary resources.\n\nMW 1:10–2:10, TR 1:15–2:15\n\nGERM 241G: Introduction to Marx & Critical Theory\n\nCarl Gelderloos\n\n“The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.” So begins Part One of the Communist Manifesto of Marx and Engels. This sentence also stands at the beginning of a tradition in philosophy, history, and politics that places everyday human labor and struggle at the heart of historical change. This course offers an introduction to this tradition, with an emphasis on its origins in the 19th century and its development in the 20th century, particularly in the work of writers associated with the Frankfurt School. As we will see, this critical tradition draws its strength from the ways in which it considers questions of power, economy, society, and culture as inextricable from each other rather than as separate disciplines. Because it holds that cultures and ideologies cannot be understood without considering how given societies and economies are organized, the tradition of critical theory is materialist; because it highlights the importance of struggle and contradiction, it is dialectical. Topics we will consider include capitalism, revolution, utopia, mass culture, dialectical reasoning, historical materialism, the state, fascism, antifascism, and the human relationship to nature. Readings may include works by Marx, Hegel, Nietzsche, Freud, Adorno, Benjamin, Lukács, Kracauer, Brecht, Fanon, Davis, and Fields, among others. Course taught in English.\n\nH, N, O | MW 1:10–2:35\n\nGERM 241J, 241K: Volkswagen and Beyond\n\nHarald Zils\n\nWhat makes \"German Engineering\" so special that the phrase brings up twice as many Google hits as \"American Engineering\"? For a long time, there have been common qualities in the products of German design. The course investigates into the creative ideas that have been driving the history of German engineering and its continuations in society (Bauhaus, Volkswagen, Kraftwerk). It shows how ideas of beauty and well-formedness, even principles of ''good'' engineering are determined by economic situations and political issues, for better and for worse; and how engineers' designs influence the self-image of a whole society in return. Students are introduced to creative artists' statements and aesthetic programs, but for a huge part of the course we will analyze concrete manifestations of engineering aesthetics.\n\nNote: This is a humanities course, not an engineering course. We will not discuss BMW's anti-locking brakes; we will discuss the institutional and intellectual traditions and mindsets in the background. Course taught in English. Grading is based on two presentations, an exam and a group project.\n\nA, (O,) W | TR 4:25–5:50\n\nGERM 306: Texts & Contexts II\n\nCarl Gelderloos\n\nTexts and Contexts II: GERM 306 offers students the opportunity to refine modes of expression, improve accuracy and fluency and build cultural competency in German by engaging with important trends, ideas and events in the German-speaking world. It prepares students for more advanced work in German Studies in an interdisciplinary context. Students will engage texts and images from a range of genres (literature, history, philosophy, politics film, popular culture, news media, art) to improve critical reading abilities and accuracy in writing. The course also reviews advanced grammar structures in context. Taught entirely in German. Prerequisite: GERM 305 or instructor permission.\n\nMW 2:50–4:15\n\nGERM 380O: The Art of Exile\n\nNeil Christian Pages\n\nWhat does it mean to lose one’s home, to be uprooted from a ‘native’ language and culture and to look for a home elsewhere? What does it mean for the self to be ‘at home’ in the first place? This course explores those questions through the figure of the exile, émigré and refugee. Its focus is the life and work of writers, intellectuals and visual artists who fled Nazi Germany in and after 1933. We will consider how this particular historical moment informs contemporary debates on migration and integration, human rights and the relationship between the artist and the state. Course materials include literary works, historiography, film and visual culture. Course taught in English.\n\nH | TR 4:25–5:50\n\nGERM 380S: Germany in the 1960s\n\nHarald Zils\n\nThis course looks at German society in the nineteen-sixties, using three focal points:\n\n1) Jerusalem/Frankfurt: The trial of Adolf Eichmann and the Auschwitz trials bring to light what had long been buried: German crimes in World War II and the Holocaust. Reactions range from disbelief and rejection to helpless despair at being confronted with historical reality. For the first time, a public confrontation with this part of German history happens, and attempts are made to find a language and rules for this new discourse.\n\n2) Berlin: The building of the Wall in 1961 seals the division of Germany; in 1965, a new beginning for a utopian, alternative East Germany seems possible.\n\n3) Frankfurt, Berlin; Berkeley; Paris: In West Germany and elsewhere, students take to the streets. They demand a different republic: away with the old customs and faces, in with more personal freedom, with more democracy and more commitment to an unconditional peace. They fail, and they succeed. A new concept of the public sphere is born - and many of its problems, from \"wokeness\" to \"betrayal\" by veterans, sound familiar today... what can we learn from this for our own political dealings with each other?\n\nTwo book reviews, one term paper. Course taught in English.\n\nN, O | MW 4:40–6:05\n\nGERM 381D: The Uncanny\n\nNeil Christian Pages\n\n“Everywhere I go, I find a poet has been there before me”: The ubiquity of this remark, widely attributed to Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), speaks to Freud’s enduring status as a cultural icon, his deep engagement with literature and to the experience at the heart of this course: the Uncanny. We will begin the course with a close reading of Freud’s 1919 essay of the same name and move on to analyze a series of crucial texts from German literature that grapple with “das Unheimliche” while simultaneously mobilizing it as a literary device. Readings of novellas and prose fiction by ETA Hoffmann, Joseph Roth, Franz Kafka and W.G. Sebald. Taught entirely in German.\n\nH | TR 2:50–4:15\n\nCOURSES FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS CROSSLISTED WITH GERMAN\n\nGERM 380D: German Jews\n\nAllan Arkush\n\nThis course will examine the lives of representative German Jews from the middle of the 18th century to the beginning of the Nazi era. It will focus on these individuals’ relationship to Judaism and Jewish life and the changing German world in which they lived. Among the figures studied will be philosophers (Moses Mendelssohn), politicians (Gabriel Riesser and Walter Rathenau), rabbis (Leo Baeck), and feminists (Bertha Pappenheim). Selected Topics: the fight for Jewish civil rights in the 19th century, the reception of Jews in the German public sphere, responses to anti-Semitism, new philosophies of Judaism.\n\nH | TR 1:15–2:40\n\nGERM 380G: The Holocaust: A Victims' History\n\nGina Glasman\n\nHow did the Jews of Europe respond to German occupation and its machinery of death during the Second World War? Our class will explore an answer to this question by seeking to reconstruct a history of the Holocaust through the voices of its victims. We will examine various forms of contemporary testimony including diaries and the spoken word. Works of history, as well as documentary cinema, will also frame our conversation about chronicling the effects of Nazi genocide through the surviving record of the murdered and the dead.\n\nN, W | TR 11:40–1:05\n\nGERM 101: Elementary German I\n\nJeanette Franza, Gülden Olgun, Anja Salman, Tim Schmidt\n\nAcquisition of basic grammar and vocabulary, development of reading and speaking skills, introduction to cross-cultural communication.

Acquisition of basic grammar and vocabulary, development of reading, writing and speaking skills in an interactive learning environment. Encouraging cultural awareness through texts, films, discussions, etc., and understanding German in a global context. Successful completion of both GERM 101 and 102 will fulfill the Gen Ed G requirement. Students must take both GERM 101 and 102 for a letter grade to receive the G; courses must be taken at Binghamton University to receive the G.\n\nGERM 180G: German Culture: A History\n\nNeil Christian Pages\n\nCourse introduces students to the political, social and cultural history of modern Germany (1871–1989). From the founding of the first German nation state in 1871 to the emergence of Expressionism in painting, to the ’golden’ age of Weimar culture, to the Nazi state and the Shoah, to the division of Germany into two states with competing ideological systems in the wake of World War II, course engages events and ideas that inform contemporary German culture and its memories and identities. We will look at art and architecture, photography and film, read about history and politics and engage literary and aesthetic approaches to German cultural history in order to gain an understanding of contemporary Germany and the Germans. Readings and discussions assist students in developing intercultural competencies and fluencies across genres and media while building skills in critical reading and thinking. Taught entirely in English.\n\nGen Ed: A, N\n\nGERM 203: Intermediate German I\n\nCarl Gelderloos, Anja Salman\n\nHelps students develop ability to communicate in German beyond the basic \"survival\" level. Begins with a systematic review of German grammar that continues through the second semester at the intermediate level. Students read a series of short literary texts and work with texts taken from popular culture, as they improve their reading, writing and discussion skills. Designed especially for students who are interested in the humanities and social sciences. Prerequisites: GERM 102 or equivalent, or consent of instructor.\n\nGERM 241M: Myths of Power\n\nRosmarie Morewedge\n\nCourts, Kings, Cities and Cathedrals in Germany: Myths of Power in Ideas, Images and Icons Focusing on the time span of the Middle Ages to the French Revolution, we shall explore in literature and the visual arts myths of power and the power of myth. The focus will be on the rise of sacral kingship, the medieval institutionalization of power, the development of major courts of the high nobility, power struggles between the church and the empire, between conservative forces and the ascending middle class in cities, as well as centripetal and centrifugal force fields that shape the center and peripheries in Central Europe. We will study the history of ideas, icons and images, read texts and watch a number of films, making use of a series of compelling historical docudramas as well as feature films, but will also critique literary and visual depictions of major historical power struggles. We will explore how these ideas, images and icons linked to myths of power-- have contributed to the shaping of aristocratic status, social hierarchies, social mobility, and ultimately to a regional, urban national identity in Germany.\n\nGen Ed: H\n\nGERM 241N: The Nazi State\n\nHarald Zils\n\nThe course looks at Germany between 1933 and 1939, at the organization and inner functioning of the Nazi government and administration. Topics include the Nazi rise to power, party structures, \"Gleichschaltung\" of society, economy, and media, persecution of minorities, the situation of workers and peasants, the role of the churches etc. Two midterms, one final. Course taught in English.\n\nGen Ed: H\n\nGERM 305: Texts & Contexts I\n\nRosmarie Morewedge\n\nCourse provides a comprehensive review of German grammar and usage through readings of texts and contexts related to German-speaking Europe and the global reach of German language and culture. We will work with different genres (fiction and non-fiction; history; geography; art; philosophy; media; visual culture) in order to develop fluency and accuracy in spoken and written German, to explore strategies for reading texts needed for an interdisciplinary approach to German Studies and to learn more about key aspects of German language and culture. Evaluation and grading are based on in-class participation, written homework and exams. Course is taught entirely in German. Prerequisite: GERM 204 or equivalent or instructor permission.\n\nGERM 380B: Learning to See: Art & Media in Weimar GermanyCarl Gelderloos\n\nFrom the movies we watch to the advertisements we see, from the way we understand images to the fonts we use, the vibrant legacy of modern culture in the 1920s and 1930s continues to influence the way we use and think about media, art, technology, and communication. Drawing on richly innovative visual artworks and groundbreaking theoretical texts, this course explores the visual culture of the Weimar Republic (1919–1933) with a special emphasis on film, photography, and montage. Visual media played a central role in the cultural production and aesthetic and political debates of the time: the rise of the cinema provoked an unparalleled reexamination of the relationship between art, technology, and society, while the rapid expansion of photography into newspapers and other mass media helped spark diverse discussions of aesthetics, perception, and individuality. Why did visual media and discussions about them play such a central role in the cultural and political ferment of modern culture between two world wars? How did new visual media and technologies help contemporaries rethink other, non-visual media such as literature and aesthetic representation more generally? Why were debates about photography and film often so politically charged, and how were images related to democracy, communism, and fascism? In what ways did Weimar culture draw on new technologies to see and depict processes of modernization, urbanization, and industrialization with new eyes? From Dada to advertising culture, photojournalism to Bertolt Brecht, these are the questions we will explore in this class.\n\nGen Ed: A, H\n\nGERM 380H: Modern Yiddish Culture\n\nGina Glasman\n\nIn the half century before the Second World War, a Yiddish ­speaking \"Jewish Street\" stretched from Buenos Aires to Boston, from London to Lodz, with many cities in between. What characterized the culture of this mostly urban and modernizing society is the subject of this class. Cinema and short stories, poetry and politics provide our vehicle to explore the world of Eastern European Jewry in a time of radical transformation and approaching catastrophe (all material is in English). If a student has taken a 200-level version of Modern Yiddish Culture they will not receive credit for this course.\n\nGen Ed: H, J\n\nGERM 380O: Art, Image, Psychoanalysis\n\nJeffrey Kirkwood\n\nThis course explores the history of psychoanalysis as both a critical fixture in the interpretation of images during the 20th century, as well as a theory deeply tied to developments in aesthetics and technology. Despite having become a standard theoretical tool in the interpretation of art and film, psychoanalysis, since its inception, has had difficulty accounting for the nature and function of images. Through readings of core psychoanalytic and pre-psychoanalytic texts (Freud, Ferenczi, Rank, Klein, Lacan, etc.) and an engagement with 20th century movements in art and film (including Dada, Surrealism, Weimar cinema, and contemporary criticism) we will examine the ways in which psychoanalysis has informed and been informed by the history of image-making. Prerequisite: any 100- or 200-level course in Art History, Comparative Literature, Cinema, or German; or permission of instructor. This course fulfills the \"Post-1800\" distribution requirement for the Art History major.\n\nGen Ed: A\n\nGERM 480U: Kafka and His Readers\n\nNeil Christian Pages\n\nSeminar explores the work and reception of Franz Kafka (1883–1924), arguably the most famous writer of German Modernism and the inspiration for the troublesome idiom “Kafkaesque.” We will examine the Kafkan text with and against some of the cultural productions that have emerged from it, from the illustrations of R. Crumb, to the installation art of Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller, to musical compositions, the films of Steven Soderbergh and Michael Haneke, the work of visual artists like Jeff Wall, the literary texts of authors like Jonathan Franzen, Haruki Murakami and J.M. Coetzee and the criticism of thinkers like Benjamin, Adorno, Derrida and Blanchot. While considering Kafka’s literary legacy, his academic function, his impact on thinking about art and representation, and the debates about the translation of his work, we will also reflect on the process of reading and interpretation generally as well as on what literature does and the ways in which literary criticism works.\n\nGERM 481H: Hitler\n\nHarald Zils\n\nAn investigation into the life and afterlife of Adolf Hitler. We examine various turning points in Hitler's life based on various portrayals, including the self-portrayal in Mein Kampf. What can be learned about this person that goes beyond mere demonization? What is the function of biographies for society, and how useful are they for historiography? How much do they reflect the current issues of their respective times? The second part of the course takes on Hitler's afterlife in social and cultural discourse inside and outside Germany: The remembrance of Hitler as a dire warning, as an obligation, as a provocation; Hitler as the protagonist of glorifications and conspiracy theories; Hitler as a trope and as a caricature. The course will use speeches, memoirs, and also products of mass culture like Downfall and Jojo Rabbit as source material to document the interplay of memory, guilt, longing for justice and attempts to comprehend the unforgivable. Course taught in English.\n\nGERM 481M: Theories of Media\n\nJeffrey Kirkwood\n\nThis course will offer an intensive study of core media theoretical texts—both historical and contemporary. Media theory has undergone increasing institutionalization and now exerts an ever-greater force on the study of art, philosophy, cinema, science, and literature. By engaging with a canon of foundational theoretical texts we will explore the impact of various genealogies of thinking about media technologies on the many fields it has come to shape. Readings for the course include Ernst Kapp, Gilbert Simondon, Lewis Mumford, Donna Haraway, Friedrich Kittler, Michel Serres, Bernhard Siegert, N. Katherine Hayles, Jean Baudrillard, Sybille Krämer, Bernard Stiegler, Niklas Luhmann, and others.\n\nGen Ed: A\n\nGERM 101: Elementary German I\n\nFrank Mischke\n\nAcquisition of basic grammar and vocabulary, development of reading and speaking skills, introduction to cross-cultural communication.
