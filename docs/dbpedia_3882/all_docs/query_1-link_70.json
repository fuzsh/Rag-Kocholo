        "text": "The digitisation of landmarks in Ukraine, a pet-food brand restoring coral reefs, and a pledge from a retailer helping German teenagers who missed out on life during the pandemic. This year’s three Craft Grand Prix winners have shown how brands are using inventive craft techniques to take on issues in the wider world.\n\nAnd the Design Lions Grand Prix, through FCB Lisbon, was in a similar vein. ‘Portuguese (Re)Constitution’ for Penguin Books turned a censorious blue pencil into a book celebrating free speech.\n\nPolycam x UNESCO’s ‘Backup Ukraine’, through Virtue Worldwide, archived Ukrainian monuments as a digital blueprint in the cloud, and took the Digital Craft Lions Grand Prix.\n\nUkrainian creatives received a standing ovation in an emotive Lumiere session entitled ‘Creativity Under Bombs’. It opened with a message from President Volodymyr Zelensky: “I believe that the power of human creativity is greater than the power of the nuclear state that is stuck in the past. Your work will make our fight for freedom legendary.”\n\nEntertainment and Identity\n\nLions in the Entertainment track celebrated plurality. Rapper Residente’s powerful music video ‘This is Not America’ was a heated rejection of US imperialism in Latin America. It took the Entertainment Lions for Music Grand Prix.\n\nAnd ‘NikeSync’, through R/GA London, set out to balance training programmes skewed towards men, taking the Grand Prix in the Entertainment Lions for Sport. The Jury President in this Lion, Marcel Marcondes, Global Chief Marketing Officer, AB InBev, said: “It demonstrates how brands can leverage sports to celebrate human nuances.”"
