        "text": "Shudder, AMC Networks’ premium streaming service for horror, thrillers and the supernatural have released the trailer and poster art for the upcoming Shudder Exclusive from Australian filmmaker Andrew Traucki, The Reef:Stalked, a follow-up to his critical acclaimed film The Reef,will premiere on the platform on Friday 29 July.\n\nWritten and directed by Traucki the film stars an Australian cast including, Teressa Liane (The Vampire Diaries), Ann Truong (Cowboy BeBop), Saskia Archer (Boshack), Kate Lister (Clickbait) and Tim Ross (Wonderland).\n\nIn an effort to heal after witnessing her sister’s horrific murder, Nic (Liane) travels to a tropical resort with her friends for a kayaking and diving adventure. Only hours into their expedition, the women are stalked and then attacked by a great white shark. To survive they will need to band together and Nic will have to overcome her post-traumatic stress, face her fears and slay the monster.\n\n“For years since I wrote and directed the hit thriller, The Reef, people have been asking me to do another shark film. I didn’t really want to because I thought I’d been there and done that but then I had a compelling idea I just had to explore,” explains Traucki."
