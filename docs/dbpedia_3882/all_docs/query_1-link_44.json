        "text": "It was a topic of discussion in our class for over a week after we saw the movie. We had never thought about conserving water before. We all felt proud to save water and help our friends and family save it, too!\n\nHurricane on the Bayou has been an invaluable tool for telling my colleagues and the nation the story of our vanishing wetlands and the devastation wrought by the hurricanes. The breathtaking IMAX imagery transports the audience.\n\nI enjoyed the way the movie presented science concepts in an awe-inspiring and yet understandable way for the young learner.\n\n...many [documentary] production companies and their sponsors are more concerned with feeding public hype and fear than presenting scientifically accurate, educational films. However, working with MacGillivray Freeman Films as a scientific consultant…has renewed my faith in documentary films!\n\nMacGillivray Freeman Films…believes in the capacity of large format films to educate and inspire people of all ages to expand their point of view on our world and universe.\n\nI’ve been involved with a number of film projects before, but this one stands out in many ways…to the fastidious attention to detail, to a sincere desire to ensure scientific accuracy and generally just ‘get it right."
