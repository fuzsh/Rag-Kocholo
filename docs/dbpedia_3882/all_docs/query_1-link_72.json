        "text": "German film \"All Quiet On The Western Front\" led nominations for the British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs) on Thursday.\n\nThe anti-war drama, based on a 1928 novel by German author Erich Maria Remarque, received 14 nominations.\n\nThis is the most nominations a non-English-language film has received at the BAFTAs. The only other release to have received 14 nominations is the 2001 Mandarin-language action film \"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\", organizers said.\n\n\"All Quiet On the Western Front\", directed by Edward Berger, was released by streaming platform Netflix in October 2022.\n\nWhat is 'All Quiet On The Western Front' about?\n\nThe book depicts life and death in the trenches of World War I, which Remarque had experienced as a conscript. He emigrated to Switzerland in 1933, after which his works were banned and burned by the Nazis.\n\nThe 2022 movie adaptation of Remarque's novel was recognized in the best film category, as well as for films not in the English language, for director, supporting actor, adapted screenplay and original score.\n\nSome critics have praised the film as a successful anti-war drama, while others criticize the director for inventing new storylines and ommitting characters and scenes from the book.\n\nAlso this month, \"All Quiet On the Western Front\" was nominated for best foreign film at the US-based Golden Globe Awards.\n\nLate last year, the movie was nominated to the Oscars shortlist for best international picture among 15 other candidates.\n\nWhat other films were nominated?\n\nThe dark comedy \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" and the sci-fi film \"Everything Everywhere All At Once\" received the second highest amount of nominations, with each movie getting 10 nods.\n\nBaz Luhrman's Elvis Presley biopic received nine nominations, while psychological drama \"Tar\" was given five nods.\n\nThe BAFTAs will take place on February 19 in London.\n\nsdi/rt (AP, Reuters)"
