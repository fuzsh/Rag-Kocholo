        "text": "The Premise: Inspired by a true story, a group of Australian friends capsize their boat while sailing to Indonesia and make the risky decision to swim to a nearby island – risky because a hungry shark patrols these waters.\n\nFollowing in the vérité footsteps of 2003's Open Water, The Reef ups the shark presence for what is one of the most genuinely suspenseful and terrifying shark films of the 21st century. Steve and I are rubber shark fans, so generally speaking, we hate the cop-out of using stock footage of real sharks as a way not to have special FX, but director Andrew Traucki (who spent nearly a week shooting his shark footage) is extremely deft at this approach, having previously utilized the same technique with crocs in 2007's Black Water. At times the film truly makes you wonder if you're looking at a composite shot, or a real shot of a human and shark sharing the same space. And Traucki is very creative at working with what he's got – the tension every time the character of Luke pops his head under water to look for the shark is so simple, but increasingly takes on a Hitchcockian level of expectation-terror, as we know one of these times there will be something there."
