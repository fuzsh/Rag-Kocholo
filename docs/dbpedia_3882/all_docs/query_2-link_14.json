        "text": "What makes cinema strange? Bizarre characters who react wrongly to every stimulus? Overwrought colour grading? Hyper-intellectual dialogue? Cinema is the perfect vehicle for the odd, the uncomfortable, the seemingly bizarre. When you enter you are greeted with dizzying neon lights, carpets, film posters flashing at you with the names of actors who each have scores of parasocial fans that they are grateful for – truly grateful for (they say, holding their golden statuette). But the films that loom over us in the lobby of the local Odeon are not the films we consider bizarre. Human chimneys with a mangle of faces to varying degrees of noticeability lit in, normally, two or three bright colours making a pretty sorry excuse for a film poster – yet this is not the realm of the strange. Sitting down with your popcorn (or, in my case, as many of the strawberry belt things as my pick-n-mix big will allow me) you watch the lights dim, the music start, and a disembodied voice saying ‘now is the time to turn off your smartphones’, or even worse, a disembodied voice that tries to ingratiate itself to us in awkward juxtaposition to its real nature, a massive corporate entity. Sometimes the voice will tell us a joke. Sometimes it will pick out people in the audience, and say ‘yes, even you two’. Sometimes it speaks to an empty room, save for you, and then you feel the slight chill of the representation of the juggernaut of Hollywood production as the overl-produced music seeps into the room. The cinema is the realm of the strange.\n\nYet, when we say a film is weird, we are rarely talking about the atmosphere in the theatre. The films labelled as weird are instead just as much a reflection on us. What we find strange is far more interesting than what we find normal, because normality does not define strangeness – strangeness defines normality. Strangeness too has a long and storied history of being the label of oppressed classes. John Waters is, now, rightly acknowledged as one of the great twentieth century filmmakers. Richard O’Brien’s Rocky Horror Picture Show has become a cultural watermark of LGBTQIA+ film. So, to begin – and where better than a film that was never designed to be experienced in the cinema.\n\nThe 1999 TV Movie version of Alice in Wonderland is truly a cultural phenomenon (sitting at an unfortunate, if possibly appropriate 33% on Rotten Tomatoes). Unfortunately, it is one that very few people noticed. Its screenplay was written by the Olivier-award winning Peter Barnes. Its cast is an assemblage of many of the biggest actors of the decade. Martin Short plays the Mad Hatter, Whoopi Goldberg the Cheshire Cat, Gene Wilder the Mock Turtle, Ben Kingsley the Caterpillar, Robbie Coltrane and George Wendt are Tweedledee and Tweedledum, Christopher Lloyd (yes, Doc Brown) the White Knight, Simon Russell Beale (in a notably less violent and psychopathic role than Lavrenty Beria in The Death of Stalin) is the King of Hearts. One of my favourite hobbies is spotting British comedians in productions they do not belong in, and this is no exception – Ken Dodd turns up as Mr Mouse. For a made for TV film, the cast does suggest that the film should have been one of the biggest of the decade.\n\nThe original book is famously, I hope we all agree, quite odd. But the screen offers a very different challenge, and its tropes and gimmicks give it a whole world to explore within the bounds of the original story. And explore this film does. It starts with a dominant metronome (a recurring theme that reflects Alice’s trepidation at performing Cherry Ripe at the family garden party) looming over Alice in a complete void, the only colour the bright lemon of her dress until it spirals away into her iris, where she is nervously preparing for her performance with her nanny. I won’t bother taking you, dear readers, on a long and winding journey through the plot – watch the film.\n\nThe ultimate reason, however, for why this film is so bizarre is that it possesses every hallmark of an odd film. Its puppets sit comfortably in the uncanny valley, its dialogue is too neat and inhuman– it reads like an Aaron Sorkin drama on meth – its characters are the strangest collection of things you will ever lay your eyes upon. Alice wants to go into the Duchess’ house, but the doorman is on the outside. So he ponders and sings to himself about the difficulties of life, whilst sitting in the golden sunshine doing, approximately, nothing. But the film lacks one key element – it fundamentally resists transgression. Transgression is often cited as fundamental to a film being a ‘cult’ film. Instead, this film revels in the stylistic hallmarks of the great cult filmmakers, but never attempts to overcome taboo as they do. The camp aesthetic so prevalent in the works of, say, John Waters is just as noticeable here. John Waters’ moustache is, indeed, the perfect summation of his stylistic canon. This film, too, could be described as a John Waters’ moustache film, in its absurd neatness.\n\nCult films appear strange because of their transgression, because they are not concerned to cater to the ignorance of the majority in how the majority are perpetrating their oppression. Thus, the mainstream labels them strange so that they are forced to exist outside the cultural norm, where the mainstream benefits from them being, because it is always valuable to those in power to keep cultural nonconformists from disrupting the status quo. When you accept the atmosphere of the cult film but reject its fundamental ethos, the resulting contrast looks something like this movie. Alice as a character reflects exactly this. Alice serves as the foil not just to the oddity of the characters around her (like Michael in Arrested Development) but to the entire world. Alice repeatedly changes size, colours change around her, the air turns thick and thin and all the while she reacts as though she were still at her dinner party, only periodically acknowledging the weirdness of the world around her. The Cheshire Cat calls Alice mad, ‘because you’re here, and everyone here… is mad’. The world is mad, everyone wants to be sane, but what is the point?\n\nMore importantly, this film is the key example of why mainstream films are getting stranger. The aesthetic of strange cinema, once excluded from the fundamentally heteronormative cultural establishment and its structures of racial inequality, has been grafted onto the mainstream. But those in power will not change – so instead of embracing the transgression, the mainstream embraces the extraneous qualities of the film. It makes films superficially strange, but it does not allow them to be transgressive. The aesthetic of camp and ‘trash’ (as John Waters’ calls it), are inextricably linked to moral transgression. The camp aesthetic serves as a vehicle for moral transgression, the image being the ultimate conceit (in the sense of an artistic device) by which the moral transgression occurs. To take the former without the latter would be to rip the heart from the body, Temple-of-Doom style. The mainstream’s conservative moral quality is preserved but its aesthetic shifts to accommodate the culture represented by transgressive films. Superhero movies at present are obsessed with multiversal tales intoxicated with bright colours and oddball characters, but they refuse to transgress the conservative moral boundaries set to oppress those who lie beyond them.\n\nWell, I think the point has been made. But weird film cannot get away with being only aesthetically outside the mainstream: weird film needs to be transgressive to have value in its oddity. Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland (the book) was transgressive in many ways, against Victorian society. It rallied against the absurdity of childhood at the time, like being raised by a nanny, and the bizarre power structures leaving the unequipped in charge (‘off with his head’). But once that society inevitably changed, Alice in Wonderland (1999) was left to recreate the absurdity of its original. It is an excellent film, not in spite of its absurdity but because of it. It is devoid enough of moral transgression to make it a valuable benchmark of what is and what is not valuably strange. So, with that, I will stop. In the immortal words of Mr Mouse ‘my lecture [this article] must be seen and heard to be depreciated’."
