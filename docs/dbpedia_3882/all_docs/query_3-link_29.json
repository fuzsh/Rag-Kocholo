The trip turns deadly as the group's boat capsizes after colliding into the reef. Seeking refuge on the hull of the damaged vessel, the group starts to drift further away from land. Warren advises the group to wait for help on the ship's hull. Fearing that they will be lost at sea with no way to seek help, the group of friends decide to swim to a nearby island. Soon after heading towards the island they find a mutilated turtle carcass. Quickly, the group realizes they are not alone. The group continues to swim despite the danger beneath. They are stalked by a great white shark."
