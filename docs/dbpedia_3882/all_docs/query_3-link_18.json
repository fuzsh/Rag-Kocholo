        "text": "WE’RE LEAKING.\n\nI mean, like so many others I’m a sucker for a bad shark movie every once and awhile, but not THIS bad. next level bad with lackluster dialogue and poor decisions upon poor decisions. these girls just kept making excuses to go back in the water! I don’t even think the cast of Lost tried getting off the island as much as these girls did. I miss Lost.\n\njust another soulless addition to the insufferable shark movies to come out in recent years... I’m going to watch another one.\n\nOnce you get past the boring start there is some pretty tense shark kayak moments in The Reef: Stalked. I enjoyed the first Reef movie, and it was looking like this one was going to be great!\n\nThen it got pretty dumb. Then it got bad. Then it was just plain stupid. Then it got so stupid it was fun again.\n\nDon’t take it too seriously and you just might love this dumb shark movie.\n\n“Annie are you OK!?”\n\nDid she just tell that shark to \"fuck off\"?\n\nSee, that's just uncalled for. Words matter. It's also bit disingenuous to label this shark a \"stalker\" when clearly it just likes to play with its food a bit before chowing down.\n\nBut seriously, writer/director Andrew Traucki has built an impressive following by staying within the nature horror subgenre. So far I'd only seen his short from The ABCs of Death. Tests the patience a bit by waiting over twenty minutes to reveal a shark fin. I did sense a cheeky nod to Jaws: The Revenge since the female protagonist has some shit she needs to work out. This time it's personal.\n\nfor a shark movie, we sure don't get to see much of the actual shark.. i'm on the shark's side. if it really felt like it had nothing better to do with it's time than follow these people and wait so long to attack, then who am i to argue with that?\n\nToo bad because The Reef was really great. It's indecent to make such a lousy sequel, not enough death, not enough blood. Too much trauma, too much drama queen and explain how such morons think they can survive paddling in reverse with absolutely no survival instinct. Everyone deserved to die\n\nHorror movies\n\nNot a good start to the movie watching day. Somehow, even worse than the original film, which as I’m saying that makes me wonder why I even watched this considering I didn’t like the first?! Dumbass!! A horrible movie with some of the most bland and boring characters I’ve ever seen in a movie.\n\nwhy would she let her sister go home with a guy after seeing him scream at her like that? and why is she having flashbacks of something that didn't even happen to her??? also this has to be the most lazy shark ever with the way it gave up trying to eat them EVERY TIME they got out of water\n\nA by-the-numbers shark attack film for the most part. The story surprisingly isn’t as terrible as its predecessor but it’s still just another shark attack film with nothing special about it. Get past the awesome shark action and you’re left with a film where nothing interesting happens. The drama feels forced and the suspense is just not there while taking the same serious approach as the first one instead of going down the campy route, which I think would've worked better. Overall, it's an okay watch. Can be mildly amusing as long as you are aware of what it is.\n\n2022 Horror Ranked\n\nShudder Exclusives & Originals Ranked"
