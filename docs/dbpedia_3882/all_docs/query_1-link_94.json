        "text": "Surviving the Outback\n\nCould you escape alone across hundreds of kilometres of remote bush, trekking and sailing on a makeshift raft, with nothing but a time capsule of antique stuff from 1932? Mike wasn’t sure either! But that’s what he tried to do with no back-up crew or two-way communications with the outside world, hoping his skills as a survival instructor, adventurer and military pilot would help him survive long enough to traverse the most stunning landscape in Australia.\n\n100% self-filmed with action cameras and drones, this epic modern day adventure places Mike in the historic predicament of two stranded German aviators who survived 43 days before being rescued on the brink of death by local Aboriginal people.\n\nAction, drama, humour and crocodiles handled in a very Australian way, Mike’s epic footage and images have aired on prime-time TV, current affairs, newspapers and Australian Geographic Magazine, but until now the full story hasn’t been told….."
