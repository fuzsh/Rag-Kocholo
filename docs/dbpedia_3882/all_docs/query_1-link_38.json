        "text": "Current research focus\n\nMy current research focuses on the role of natural environmental variability and how it can provide refuge during extreme environmental stress events such as heat waves, protect organisms from severe damage and also make them more resilient to future climate change.\n\nI am investigating coral reefs in the Andaman Sea where large amplitude internal waves protected corals during a severe bleaching event (e.g. Wall et al. 2015, ProcRoySocB, Schmidt, Wall, et al 2016, Coral Reefs) and made them more resilient to thermal stress (Buerger, Schmidt, Wall, et al. 2016, JEMBE). The aim is to better understand such aspects and locations and to incorporate this understanding of adapted coral populations into current reef restoration efforts.\n\nEnvironmental variability also plays a role in the fitness of cold-water corals, and at the limits of their distribution this can cause additional stress and negatively affect their metabolism (Beck etal 2022, CommsBiol) and presumably their fitness. This also has the consequence of affecting their fatty acid balance and presumably depleting lipid reserves more than in habitats with less environmental variability (Wall etal 2024, FuncEcol).\n\nThe overarching goal is to better characterize natural environmental fluctuations and to understand how they influence and change the stress response of organisms. Can they “train” organisms for climate change or are they bringing them closer to their limits? For improved ecosystem management in times of climate change, it is crucial to understand the phenotypic plasticity of organisms and their adaptive potential, as well as to identify natural sites that provide refuges. All of this together will determine future biodiversity. We also need to adapt this knowledge to different local environmental conditions and incorporate it into ongoing ecosystem restoration efforts.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nWall M, Doering T, Pohl N, Putchim L, Ratanawongwan T, Roik A (pre-print, in review CommsBiol) Natural thermal stress- hardening of corals through cold temperature pulses in the Thai Andaman Sea. bioRxiv: doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.12.544549\n\nRoik A*, Wall M*, Dobelmann M, Nietzer S, Brefeld D, Fiesinger A, Reverter M, Schupp PJ, Jackson M, Rutsch M, Strahl J (pre-print, in review STOTEN) Trade-offs in a reef-building coral after six years of thermal acclimation. bioRxiv: doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.20.549699\n\nWall M, Beck KK, Garcia-Herrera N, Schmidt-Grieb GM, Laudien J, Höfer J, Försterra G, Held C, Nehrke G, Woll M, Graeve M, Richter C (2024) Lipid biomarker reveal trophic relationships and energetic trade-offs in contrasting phenotypes of the cold-water coral Desmophyllum dianthus in Comau Fjord, Chile.
