        "text": "Lion and the King (also known as King of the Animals 2, The Lion and his Son and Son of the Lion King, originally known as Der König der Tiere: das grosse Abenteuer) is a Dingo Pictures movie that was released in 1999. It's a sequel to King of the Animals and a mockbuster of The Lion King II: Simba's Pride.\n\nSummary\n\nIt's business as usual in the jungle. The old lion had been a good-natured and wise king and the animals usually obeyed his orders. Only Robin, the king's little son didn't want to obey him all the time. His dream was to find the treasure of the black Panther, who had been chased away by the animals. The old lion tried to keep his son from the treasure search especially since this treasure had brought only misfortune. But Robin did not worry about it. At the same time Pino, the son of the black Panther planned to get the treasure. Both of them met. Now this new story of the animal king tells how the two enemies finally became friends.\n\nCast\n\nSee also: Lion and the King/Credits\n\nArmin Drogat\n\nThorsten Morawietz\n\nPascale Drogat\n\nSimone Greiss\n\nTrivia\n\nGeneral\n\nInterestingly, the stereo mix of \"10. Mai\" is used in this movie. Usually, only the audio from the left channel would be used.\n\nThis was the first ever Dingo Pictures movie that was reviewed by Phelous.\n\nA few lines (e.g. \"The diamonds! My god!\" and \"Your father, the black panther, is your father?\") became memes ever since he reviewed the movie.\n\nDespite being a sequel, this film changes many elements from its predecessor:\n\nWhile the previous King of the Animals took place in what appears to be a tropical jungle, this movie has a more savannah-like setting.\n\nRobin's mother is nowhere to be found, something that is never brought up.\n\nWhile the Panther is implied to be the same antagonist from the first film, he's never refered to by his original name Bokassa.\n\nThe rabbit character that Robin befriended in the first film doesn't appear at all. Dundee can be considered as a replacement since they fill a similar role.\n\nGoofs\n\nEnglish dub\n\nRobin's line \"Your father, the black panther, is your father?\" is read in a way that makes it sound redundant. The first \"your father\" was likely supposed to be said as a separate questioning statement.\n\nDundee's voice actor's chair is heard creaking when he tells Robin about wanting the bird to clean his teeth.\n\nSome English plot summaries refer to the Panther's son as Pino, however the character in the dub is actually named Mew-Mew\n\nScreenshots\n\nSee Lion and the King/Screenshots\n\nReleases\n\nSee Lion and the King/Releases\n\nFilm\n\nThe original German film can be viewed here:\n\nThe English dub can be viewed here:\n\nReview\n\nSee also\n\nKing of the Animals\n\nLeo the Lion: King of the Jungle"
