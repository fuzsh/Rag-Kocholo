Students in French, German, and Spanish who continue with the same language must take the placement test before they enroll in a course in the department. Students in other languages must consult the department for the appropriate placement procedures before enrolling.\n\nDegrees Offered\n\nBachelor of Arts (BA) degrees are offered in East Asian Languages and Cultures (Chinese and Japanese), French, German, Italian, Linguistics, Middle Eastern Studies, Russian, and Spanish. In addition, a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree is offered in Linguistics. All major programs, except for languages with a concentration in business and Middle Eastern Studies will also require a minor degree. Undergraduate minors are offered in Arabic Studies, Chinese, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Linguistics, Linguistic Entrepreneurship, Middle Eastern Studies, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Strategic European Languages and Cultures (SELC), and World Literature/World Film.\n\nGraduate programs leading to the Master of Arts degree are available in East Asian Languages and Cultures (Chinese and Japanese), French, German, Italian Studies, Slavic (concentration in Russian, with minor work available in Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian and Ukrainian) and Spanish (emphasis on Literary and Cultural Studies or Linguistics).

For information on graduate programs, refer to the Graduate Bulletin.\n\nWinthrop-King Institute for Contemporary French and Francophone Studies\n\nThe Winthrop-King Institute for Contemporary French and Francophone Studies was created as a result of a generous bequest from the late Mrs. Ada Belle Winthrop-King. It is a center for interdisciplinary scholarship focusing on developments in France and the wider French-speaking world dating approximately from the French Revolution to the present, with a particular emphasis on contemporary issues. The institute offers a wide range of study abroad scholarships for students. Strongly interdisciplinary in outlook, the Institute brings together faculty from a variety of departments at Florida State and from universities throughout the world. It hosts leading scholars, artists, and public figures and sponsors a wide range of lectures, film screenings, conferences, and other events addressing key social, cultural, and political issues in France and other French-speaking regions.\n\nScholarships Offered\n\nAda Belle Winthrop-King Scholarships are offered on a competitive basis each year for language majors in Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Linguistics, Russian, and Spanish. For further information, please contact the Winthrop-King Institute at (850) 644-7636.\n\nDigital Literacy Requirement\n\nStudents must complete at least one course designated as meeting the Digital Literacy Requirement with a grade of “C–” or higher. Courses fulfilling the Digital Literacy Requirement must accomplish at least three of the following outcomes:\n\nEvaluate and interpret the accuracy, credibility, and relevance of digital information\n\nEvaluate and interpret digital data and their implications\n\nDiscuss the ways in which society and/or culture interact with digital technology\n\nDiscuss digital technology trends and their professional implications\n\nDemonstrate the ability to use digital technology effectively\n\nDemonstrate the knowledge to use digital technology safely and ethically\n\nEach academic major has determined the courses that fulfill the Digital Literacy requirement for that major.

The statute governing this policy can be reviewed by visiting https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2021/1006.73.\n\nFLVC has identified common program prerequisites for the degree programs in Modern Languages. To obtain the most up-to-date, state-approved prerequisites for this degree, visit: https://cpm.flvc.org/programs/302/269 (East Asian), https://cpm.flvc.org/programs/299/266 (French), https://cpm.flvc.org/programs/300/267 (German), https://cpm.flvc.org/programs/308/270 (Italian), https://cpm.flvc.org/programs/301/268 (Russian), and https://cpm.flvc.org/programs/296/264 (Spanish).\n\nSpecific prerequisites are required for admission into the upper-division program and must be completed by the student at either a community college or a state university prior to being admitted to this program. Students may be admitted into the University without completing the prerequisites but may not be admitted into the program.\n\nCollege Requirements\n\nPlease review all college-wide degree requirements summarized in the “College of Arts and Sciences” chapter of this General Bulletin.\n\nNote: The department reserves the right to reassign or drop students who are enrolled in a course for which they have not taken the required prerequisites or one that does not correspond to their linguistic abilities.\n\nHonors in the Major\n\nThe Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics offers a program in honors in the major to encourage talented seniors to undertake independent and original research as part of the undergraduate experience. For requirements and other information, see the “University Honors Office and Honor Societies” chapter of this General Bulletin.\n\nMajor in a Language with Concentration in Business\n\nA major in Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, or Russian with a concentration in business may be selected. The program consists of twenty-one semester hours in the language beyond the language requirement plus fifteen approved semester hours of core business courses and twelve approved semester hours in a specialized track of marketing, management, or finance in the College of Business.
