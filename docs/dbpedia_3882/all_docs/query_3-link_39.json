        "text": "The official sequel to Andrew Traucki’s The Reef, new movie The Reef: Stalked is swimming to Shudder this summer, on Digital/VOD and streaming on Shudder on July 29, 2022.\n\nThe Reef: Stalked will also be available in select theaters on the same day.\n\nWatch the brand new official trailer below, and check out new poster art underneath!\n\nWritten and directed by Andrew Traucki (Black Water) as a follow up to his 2010 film, The Reef: Stalked stars Teressa Liane (“The Vampire Diaries”), Ann Truong (“Cowboy Bebop”), Saskia Archer (Boshack), Kate Lister (“Clickbait”) and Tim Ross (“Wonderland”).\n\nIn the sequel…\n\n“Nic, in an effort to heal after witnessing her sister’s horrific murder, travels to a tropical resort with her friends for a kayaking and diving adventure. Only hours into their expedition, the women are stalked and then attacked by a great white shark. To survive they will need to band together and Nic will have to overcome her post-traumatic stress, face her fears and slay the monster.”\n\n“Audiences have an insatiable appetite for shark films, which we know first-hand from our incredible experience releasing The Reef years ago,” said Mark Ward, Chief Acquisitions Officer of RLJE Films. “We are thrilled to be working with the team again to bring this new terrifying adventure to audiences.”\n\nThe Reef: Stalked was produced by Neal Kingston (Great White), Michael Robertson (The Pack), Jack Christian (Black Water: Abyss) and Traucki (The Reef).\n\nThe 60-minute found footage horror short Milk & Serial is making huge waves here in the horror community, already approaching half a million views since being uploaded just two weeks ago by the channel That’s a Bad Idea, an up-and-coming comedy duo made up of film-school-pals-turned-collaborators Curry Barker and Cooper Tomlinson.\n\nThe short film was made for just $800 and opted for a direct-to-YouTube release versus a more traditional release with a more traditional distributor, with the channel’s 600,000+ subscribers spreading it far and wide across the internet. Milk & Serial follows in the wake of the duo’s The Chair, a previous horror short that similarly went viral and passed 5 million views.\n\nNeedless to say, Barker and Tomlinson know what the hell they’re doing in the horror space. And in a chat with Variety this week, they tease that another horror movie is now in the works.\n\nThe title? Obsession.\n\n“It’s horror — completely horror,” Barker teases. “It’s terrifying. It’s going to be insane. This movie is unlike anything I think anyone’s ever seen. It’s so different from Milk & Serial … I’m not in it and it will not be a found footage movie. It’ll be shot more like The Chair.”\n\nBarker notes in the same interview that he “worked on this script for over eight months back and forth,” and he’s partnered with Tea Shop Productions (47 Meters Down) on the project.\n\nStay tuned for more on Obsession as we learn it.\n\nYou can watch Milk & Serial below, which follows a well-known social media comedy team whose lives are thrown into a tailspin following a birthday prank intended for their channel.\n\nAri Drew raved here on Bloody Disgusting just last week, “Milk & Serial is an exceptional vehicle for Barker and Tomlinson’s singular talents both in front of and behind the camera. The duo’s passion for horror and gift of twisted DIY storytelling are evident from the film’s opening scene. Despite it’s relatively familiar ‘influencer horror’ setup, Milk & Serial is ultimately a wild ride that delivers in spades, elevated by the duo’s impressive ingenuity and ability to capture a sense of authenticity often difficult to achieve in the found footage horror subgenre.”"
