        "text": "Gloria Guinness (born Gloria Rubio y Alatorre; August 27, 1912[2] – November 9, 1980)[3] was a socialite and fashion icon of the Twentieth Century, as well as a contributing editor to Harper's Bazaar from 1963 until 1971. She was named to the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1964.[4][5]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nBorn in Veracruz, Veracruz, Mexico, she was a daughter of José Rafael Rubio Torres (1880-1916),[6] a Mexican journalist, and his wife, Maria Luisa Dolores Alatorre Diaz (b. 1882).[1][6][7] As a young woman, she was employed as a nightclub hostess before moving to Germany.[8]\n\nMarriages[]\n\nHer first husband was a German-born resident of Mexico named Scholtens, from whom she was divorced.[8][9]\n\nShe married a second time on October 4, 1935, in Kensington, London, England, to Franz-Egon Maria Meinhard Engelbert Pius Aloysius Kaspar Ferdinand Dietrich, third Graf von Fürstenberg-Herdringen (1896–1975); she was his second wife. By him, she had two children:\n\nDolores Guinness born as Dolores Maria Agatha Wilhelmine Luise, Freiin von Fürstenberg-Hedringen (July 31, 1936, to January 20, 2012).[10] She married her stepbrother Patrick Benjamin Guinness (1931–1965), son of Loel Guinness, on 22 October 1955 in Paris. Have issue. Patrick was killed in a car accident in 1965. Have issue:\n\nMaria Alexandra (born 1956) married Foulques, Count de Quatrebarbes (born 1948) in 1979. Have issue.\n\nLoel Patrick (born 1957).\n\nVictoria Christina (born 1960) married Philip Niarchos in 1984, son of late Greek billionaire Stavros Niarchos. Have issue.\n\nFranz-Egon Engelbert Raphael Christophorus Hubertus, Freiherr von Fürstenberg-Hedringen (born July 27, 1939 in Berlin-Wilmersdorf).[11] He married Agneta Sundby (born April 12, 1943), a Swedish model on August 20, 1967, in Visnum church, Visnum, Sweden.[12] Later divorced and married Adelina Cuberyan.\n\nShe also had a stepdaughter from her husband's first marriage, the actress Betsy von Furstenberg. According to her friend Etti Plesch, Gloria Rubio Scholtens was introduced to Fürstenberg by her mentor, newspaper heir, diplomat, and art collector Friedrich Horstmann, who reportedly \"dressed her up and presented her at a dinner as a mysterious aristocrat.\"[13]\n\nHer third husband was Prince Ahmad-Abu-El-Fotouh Fakhry Bey (1921–1998) whom she married in 1942. He was a grandson of King Fuad I of Egypt and a nephew of Princess Fawzia of Egypt (the first wife of Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, Shah of Iran) and King Farouk I of Egypt.[14] During her marriage to Fakhri, she also was a mistress of the British ambassador to France, Duff Cooper.[15] At same time Cooper were involved with Princesse Ghislaine de Polignac (1918–2011) and Louise de Vilmorin [16]\n\nAfter her divorce in 1949, Gloria Fakhri became involved with both Loel Guinness and David Beatty, 2nd Earl Beatty.\n\nHer fourth husband, whom she married on April 7, 1951, in Antibes, was Group Captain Thomas Loel Guinness, a Member of Parliament (1906–1988) and a member of the extended Guinness beer family, though his particular branch made its fortune in banking and real estate. Of him, she told Noël Coward, \"I could never sleep with Loel. He farts too much.\"\n\nSpy?[]\n\nThere is also a long-standing rumor that Gloria Guinness was employed at some point as a spy and that when she married her fourth husband, she had no valid passport and was legally a citizen of no country. This rumor is to a certain degree borne out by her appearance in a series of supposedly nonfiction books written by Aline, Countess of Romanones, who knew her during World War Two and was a friend, fellow spy (originally on opposite sides, the Countess was still an American citizen during the war, and an employee of the OSS), and sometime adversary of Gloria, who was by this point an almost legendary character, the glamorous \"Countess von Fürstenberg\" who maintained friendships with important Nazis, including Hermann Göring and even Adolf Hitler himself,[citation needed] and lived in neutral Madrid throughout the latter days of the Second World War as an espionage agent for the Axis.[17]\n\nSix homes around the world[]\n\nThe Guinnesses had an apartment in Manhattan's expensive Waldorf Towers, an eighteenth century farmhouse called Villa Zanroc in Epalinges near Lausanne (with a bowling alley in the basement), a 350-ton yacht that plied the Mediterranean in the summer, a seven-story house on Avenue Matignon in Paris, decorated by Georges Geffroy (1903–1971), a stud farm in Normandy, Haras de Piencourt near Guy de Rothschild, and a mansion near Palm Beach at Lake Worth, Florida.[18][19][20] The Florida property, which is divided by U.S. Highway A1A, faces the lake on one side and the beach on the other; the two halves are connected by a specially built tunnel under the highway that Mrs. Guinness had decorated with furniture and screens painted by a young French artist she was interested in. In addition, the Guinnesses owned a house in Acapulco, Mexico,[21] designed by the Mexican architect Marco Antonio Aldaco.\n\nThey also kept three aircraft: an Avro Commander for short trips around Europe, a small jet, and a helicopter for Loel Guinness's hops between the Lake Worth house and the Palm Beach golf course.\n\nFashion[]\n\nShe was dressed by Cristóbal Balenciaga, Elsa Schiaparelli, Marc Bohan at Christian Dior, Chanel, Hubert de Givenchy, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, Valentino Garavani, Halston and shoes by Roger Vivier. But she also favored the Spaniard Antonio Canovas del Castillo del Rey at Lanvin (clothing). She was one of the first persons to wear the capri pants by Emilio Pucci. She was photographed for Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and Woman's Wear Daily by Cecil Beaton, Richard Avedon, John Rawlings, Toni Frissell, Horst P. Horst, Slim Aarons and Henry Clarke. Artist like René Bouché, Kenneth Paul Block and Alejo Vidal-Quadras (1919–94) painted her. She appeared on the International Best Dressed List from 1959 through 1963. The year after she was elevated into its Hall of Fame.\n\nDonations[]\n\nShe gave an enormous number of items to Victoria & Albert Museum from Cristóbal Balenciaga, Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, André Courrèges, Antonio Canovas del Castillo del Rey at Lanvin (clothing), Hubert de Givenchy, Hellstern and Jeanne Lafaurie, proving that she spread her commissions amongst many different couturiers. Among the seventeen outfits, twelve hats and pairs of shoes that she donated were a 1948 Balenciaga evening gown of organdie with flock flowers, an evening gown from 1965, a 1949 hand-painted evening gown by Marcelle Chaumont (b. 1892, house closed in 1953), and a 1950s evening gown by Jeanne Lafaurie, the only dress by that designer in the collection of Victoria & Albert Museum.[22][23][24]\n\nSome items by Cristóbal Balenciaga and Elsa Schiaparelli were donated to The Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\n\nWriting[]\n\nGuinness wrote frequently for Harper's Bazaar, most famously asserting, in the magazine's July, 1963, issue: \"Elegance is in the brain as well as the body and in the soul. Jesus Christ is the only example we have of any one human having possessed all three at the same time.\" She also wrote an appreciation to the catalogue The World of Balenciaga held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1973.\n\nDeath[]\n\nGloria Guinness died of a heart attack at her home, Villa Zanroc in Epalinges, Switzerland at the age of 68.\n\nSee also[]\n\nFürstenberg (baronial family)\n\nGuinness family\n\nStyle - Beauty Icon: Gloria Guinness\n\nVoguepedia - Personalities - Gloria Guinness\n\nVanity Fair - The Best Dressed Woman of All Time: Gloria Guinness\n\nNotes[]\n\nReferences[]"
