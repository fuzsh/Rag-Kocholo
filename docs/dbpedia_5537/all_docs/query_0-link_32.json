        "text": "New York City Births Index\n\nDatabase updated August 16, 2024\n\nThis database currently contains the indexes to 2,335,903 birth records from 1858 to 1909 for the five boroughs of New York City (Bronx, Kings, Manhattan, Queens and Richmond).\n\nNOTE: You can now access many years of New York City vital record certificates at the New York City Municipal Archives Historical Vital Records web site, for free. You can search by name or by certificate number. You can find the certificate number in this database or from the familysearch.org website. Certificate numbering starts over each year; so you will need to know the certificate number, the year and the county.\n\nIf you would like to help index some of the early years, contact us at .GGG@GermanGenealogyGroup.com\n\nThe New York City Birth index includes the following years:\n\nBronx: 1872 - 1873, 1898 - 1909, with 1 or 2 records in 1876, 1888, 1891 and a small number in 1897\n\nKings: 1866 - 1909\n\nManhattan: 1866 -1909, with 1 or 2 records in 1855, 1857-1861,1863-1865\n\nQueens: 1898 - 1909, with 1 or 2 records in 1866, 1876, 1883, 1886\n\nRichmond: 1898 - 1909\n\nNOTE: Be aware that a date like Nov 25'05 with a year 1906 indicates that the event took place on the 25th of the month in the year 1905, but was recorded in 1906.\n\nALSO: Some birth and marriage certificates may have a letter following the certificate number. An \"S\" means Special, and is an indication that the certificate has been corrected. A \"D\" means a Delayed Certificate; usually issued because an original was never issued and a certificate is required for something like Social Security or maybe some legal action. Special births were never filmed by FamilySearch. Also, most \"S\" birth certificates are not available on the NYC Historical Vital Records website. They are available on site at New York City Municipal Archives.\n\nFor all certificates, an \"A\" after a certificate number means that the number was issued twice, to different people; the \"A\" certificate is filed after the certificate without the A. The letter does not always appear on the certificate.\n\nA \"?\" after a number indicates that we found that the certificate number is not correct (or the year or county); that particular number was assigned to someone else. It's an indication to the Municipal Archives staff that they may have to do some other digging to find the right person.\n\nPlease note that the Surname (e.g. Last Name) is a required entry field. But since exact spellings are not always known, to aid your search we offer three different ways to specify Surnames...\n\nExact Match (\"is exactly\") - This is the default surname search method.\n\nSoundex (\"sounds like\") - This option enables you to specify a surname spelling it out as best you can, and it will return results that \"sound\" similar to what you spelled out.\n\nWild Card - With this option you can replace part of the surname with a * to match any number of letters, or _ to match a single letter. E.g., Sch* will return all names starting with Sch. Similarly, Schl_tz might return results such as Schlitz or Schlotz.\n\nNOTE: The wild card option applies ONLY to the surname. You can just enter the first few letters of a First Name; the search automatically adds a wild card to the end of the First Name.\n\nFor whichever of the above surname search options you would like to use, simply select the appropriate radio button option below the input field on the form. Although the additional form fields are optional, providing as much information as you can helps narrow your search. The more specific your search, the less time you need spend scrolling through search results!\n\nIf you find an error, you may submit a correction; but it MUST MATCH what is on the birth certificate. No other changes will be accepted!\n\nIf you have a NYC Historic Vital Record Birth Certificate for a person that you are certain is not in our index you may submit it here."
