        "text": "The 2016 film Rogue One is perhaps the most divisive Star Wars movie of all. The Excellent film critic Deep Focus Lens absolutely hated it. I thought it was the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes back. Set immediately before the first scene of the original Star Wars, which I will never call A New Hope, Rogue One is the story of Jyn Erso, played by the British actress Felicity Jones, and Cassion Andor, played by the Mexican actor Diego Luna. While neither Jyn nor Cassian has ever been particularly popular with hardcore Star Wars fans, they are the real heroes of the whole saga, since they are the ones who steal the plans to the original Death Star. Without Jyn and Cassian, Luke Skywalker, force or no force, would not have been able to send a pair of torpedoes down the garbage shoot, and blow the giant planet killer to kingdom come.\n\nRunning for twelve episodes, and consisting of three feature length movies, the first of which I will review here, the Disney + miniseries Andor is the prequel to Rogue One, the origin story of Cassian Andor before he reluctantly teamed up with Jyn Erso. Andor is no super hero story. It’s not even really Star Wars. Rather, it is Star Wars without the force, light sabers, Jedi knights, emperors or princesses, 8 foot tall space wizards in black S&M gear, or swelling orchestral scores by John Williams. If the original Star Wars was classic 1930s Hollywood, Andor is a mixture of genres, a heist film, a prison escape film, a police procedural, all wrapped up in a gritty style that might best be called kitchen sink noir, a style best exemplified by the forgotten 1981 Sean Connery film Outland or the 1984 cult classic Streets of Fire. If someone told me there was a lost Bruce Springsteen album called Darkness on the Edge of Andor, I would believe you. In fact, compare Diego Luna to young Bruce Springsteen or young Michael Pare.\n\nAndor opens on the “industrial planet” of Morlana One with Cassian walking down along causeway in the rain towards the red light district of a corporate office park. If you’ve been to Hoboken or Jersey City, you’ve seen this place. He walks into a bar you might be tempted to compare to the bar at the Mos Eisley spaceport in A New Hope, if the bar in the Mos Eisley spaceport got rid of the raucous music and only admitted humans. Naturally everybody in the bar, including a pair of corrupt, corporate security guards, think Cassian is there to get laid, but even though Cassian is very much the type of guy who would pay for sex, that’s not what he wants. Just the opposite, Cassian is looking for his younger sister, from whom he got separated on their home planet when their tribe — who are obvious stand ins for indigenous Mexicans — was wiped out by an imperial ship in an incident that looks a bit like the first time white men made contact with Native Americans back in 1492. Cassian, who was rescued by a white woman named Marva, and her black husband Clem, who we later learn was hanged by the Empire, is looking for his authentic self in a place that no longer exists, a planet that was made uninhabitable by an imperial mining disaster, for an indigenous culture nobody has ever heard of, for a little girl who has been dead for 25 or 30 years.\n\nFinding no trace of his sister in the bar, Cassian walks back up the causeway to his ship, where he’s mugged by the two security men who had mistaken him for an easy victim. Diego Luna, who’s about 5’10” and 150 pounds, is no more imposing than Mark Hamill, who got bullied at the bar at the Mos Eisley Space Port until he was rescued by Obi Wan Kenobi and his light saber. It’s a fatal mistake. Cassian was brought up on the working-class planet of Ferrix by a pair of scavengers, and knows how to handle himself in a fight. He knocks one of the men to the ground, cracks his skull on the concrete and shoots the other as he begs for his life. What makes the scene so good is how believable the fight is. There are no fancy martial arts. Cassian isn’t even that strong. It’s just one sober man against two jackasses who have had too much to drink at the bar, and who have convinced themselves that they’re tougher than they really are. When Cassian gets back into his ship and goes back to Ferrix, it feels like he had just killed a pair of drunken New York City Police officers outside a bar in the East Village, and fled the scene of the crime to go back home to Newark or Elizabeth in New Jersey.\n\nBack home in Ferrix, Cassian begins constructing an alibi he hopes will cover his tracks. Along the way he meet his ex-girlfriend Bix, that one perfect 10 you sometimes run into in a dreary blue collar city, her current boyfriend Timm, Cassian’s friend Brasso, a hulking giant who’s willing to cover for him, everybody who’s ever done Cassian a favor or lent him money, and above all Marva, Cassian’s formidable old step mother who will later appear in perhaps the most memorable scene in the series. While Cassian is planning his escape, arranging to sell a valuable piece of gear he had stolen from the empire to a shady buyer he contacts through Bix, we go back to Morlana One and meet the imperial authorities in charge of the crime, only they’re not the imperial authorities. They’re just a mid-level corporate security department, the local cops in the 1993 movie The Fugitive who bungle the case until Tommy Lee Jones takes over. The head supervisor accurately sizes up the case from the very beginning. Two corrupt security guards picked a fight with the wrong man. We also see that the Empire is basically New York in the 1970s or 1980s, the imperial core before sincere Nazis and authoritarians like Rudy Giuliani take over. People tolerate the Empire because they can carve out their little grift inside of it. The two security guards got to drink, and fuck, at an expensive whorehouse because they could use their authority to shake down an occasional customer for his wallet. If they got killed in the process, that was just too bad. Nobody was going to waste any time tracking down their murderer, but the times are changing.\n\nWhen we meet Syril Karn, we don’t even need an introduction for he’s such a familiar character. Played by the American actor Kyle Soller, Syril is the ambitious young police officer, think Lieutenant Exley from LA Confidential or Elliot Ness from The Untouchables, who’s determined to root out the corruption of the city police department, and put it back on track as an official crime fighting organization. “They were two Morlana employees,” he tells his supervisor, who advises him just to let it go. “If I don’t solve their murder than I am not worthy of the uniform.” While Syril may be the villain of the first part of Andor, there’s nothing particularly evil about him. He’s just a dedicated police detective doing his job. He’s not likable like Kevin Costner or charismatic and macho like Clint Eastwood or even an intellectual like Sam Waterson in Law and Order, but he does do exactly what every good police detective does. He kicks his lazy subordinates in the ass and makes them earn their pay. He locks on the one clue Cassian was careless enough, or sincere enough, to let drop, that a man from the planet Kenari (think Oaxaca or Chiapas) was looking for his long lost sister in a whore house in Morlana One, and just methodically sifts through the details. It’s a long shot, but like in every police procedural, that long shot eventually leads right to a viable suspect.\n\nIt is a long shot. Marva has wisely covered up the fact that her step son is an indigenous Kenari. Diego Luna is a well-known Mexican actor who fully embraces Mexico’s indigenous heritage but he doesn’t look particularly indigenous. He looks like any mixed race, mostly white, upper-class Mexican. If you told me he was Greek, or Turkish, or Sicilian, or even French, I’d believe you. Ferrix, like Elizabeth New Jersey, Scranton PA, Buffalo, New York, or Chicago is a dirty old industrial city full of every ethnic group, race, nationality, religion, skin tone, facial feature, height, weight, build, physical appearance, and cultural eccentricity known to man, or whatever humans in the Star Wars universe are called. It’s exactly the kind of place where a man like Cassian would cling to whatever makes him different. I know, for example, that my name “Rogouski” is derived from a small city in Silesia on the border of Poland and Germany, that my mother’s ancestry is French Swiss and German, that my paternal grandmother was born in Lithuania. Yet I couldn’t tell you very much about any of those places. I’m as American as Cassian is a native of Ferrix. In this day and age of the “Landback” movement you better believe that if I were even 5% Cherokee I’d tell everybody about it. Cassian, of course, who adores his mother Marva, has wisely kept his ethnic heritage to himself, but of course he has told most of his girlfriends, including Bix. Who hasn’t told their boyfriend or girlfriend about that obscure little country they can claim as their homeland?\n\nAs Cassian is getting his alibi straight with Marva, we learn that he has not brought Bix home to meet her. That tells us that she was never really important to him, that she was the passive partner in their relationship, the one who admires more than is admired. Timm, on the other hand, who’s played by the Scottish actor James McArdle, knows that he is punching far above his weight category. He’s a dull working class bloke in a dull industrial city who has scored the hottest babe in town. This fact is such an important part of his identity, he’s terrified of losing it. He also knows that he’s living in Cassian’s shadow, the mysterious Hispanic bad boy who for some reason Bix is reluctantly willing to do a favor for every time he comes around and asks. Timm fears that as soon as Cassian wants her back, she’s his for the asking. Timm is also not particularly bright. He doesn’t realize that his best possible option is to let Cassian sell his stolen imperial electronics to Bix’s contact and let him get out of town for good. Timm is a young man who knows he’s the rebound guy, the warm body who will serve as a place holder until she finds something better. So he acts in an irrational manner. He calls up Syril Karn. You were looking for a man descended from the mysterious and now genocided people of Kenari? I have some information that might be of interest to you.\n\nIn the third episode of Andor, the first story arc of the series comes together in an explosive way. Syril taps another security officer, commandeers twelve soldiers, and heads to Ferrix to arrest his only suspect. We also meet Luthen Rael. Played by the Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgård, he’s Ben Kenobi to Cassian’s Luke Skywalker, Alec Guinness to Mark Hamill, the wise old mentor the lost young man was seeking all along. Unlike Alec Guinness’s Ben Kenobi, however, Luthen is no kindly old space Jesus. He’s more like Lenin or Robespierre, a ruthless, cold revolutionary determined to bring down the empire by any means necessary. If that necessary means is using and exploiting an angry young man like Cassian, so be it. He wants the electronics, of course, but he’s more interested in Cassian himself, a thief clever enough talk walk in and out of imperial bases and just take what he wants. Cassian mistrusts Luther but he also has no trouble telling him how he can steal so many imperial components. He’s a nobody. The Empire doesn’t care about him. All he has to do is walk in and take what he wants. It’s New York City in the 1970s and anybody with the requisite lack of morals can probably steal enough to live a pretty good life.\n\nBut times are definitely changing. Syril Karn and his detachment reach Ferrix faster than anybody, even an experienced Bolshevik like Luthen, expected. They quickly take Marva hostage, arrest Bix, and trace Cassian to the spot where he and Luthen are arranging their transaction. It’s now too late. Cassian has to trust Luthen, who’s his only way out. As they shoot their way out of the city, as Timm foolishly dies trying to rescue Bix from Syril Karn’s officers, as Marva taunts her arresting officer with a promise of the revolution that awaits him, Luthen tells Cassian about a mission. The rebellion is now ready to infiltrate a frontier garrison and steal the payroll for an entire imperial sector. Is Cassian interested. The rebellion is ready to pay well, and what choice does Cassian have after all? In the next episode, soon to be reviewed here, we enter a new arc of the Andor series. Fans of Jean Pierre Melville or the Oceans 11 series will enjoy it.\n\nWhile most people in the United States have heard the name Cesar Chavez, very few of us know anything about him other than that he was a Mexican American labor leader who organized the grape boycott back in the 1960s and 1970s. So any biography, even a plodding, TV movie of the week style film is probably worth seeing. It’s certainly preferable to the latest Batman movie. Diego Luna’s film is probably as weak as its critics have accused it of being. But I also think he deserves credit for an earnest, well-intentioned effort.\n\nCesar Chavez opens up with Michael Pena’s voice over. Chavez was born in Arizona in the 1920s. His parents owned a ranch, which they lost during the Great Depression. Like John Steinbeck’s Okies, they moved west to California to work in the fields. Chavez himself was a migrant laborer when he was 11. We next see Ceser Chavez as an adult. He’s living in Los Angeles, working for a group called the Community Service Organization, trying, unsuccessfully, to recruit a family of migrants. Chavez, who’s supported by another organizer named Dolores Huerta, Rosario Dawson, announces that he doesn’t feel as if he’s any use as a labor bureaucrat in LA. He wants to go back to work in the fields and organize workers on the ground. Some TV movie of the week drama ensues. None of his kids want to uproot themselves, but his wife is supportive. They all pile into a car, drive to Delano in California’s Central Valley, and Chavez gets to work in earnest.\n\nThe scenes that take place in Delano have been criticized for their historical inaccuracy, more specifically, for their failure to pay sufficient attention to Chavez’s Filipino allies. While the script does in fact include one very striking scene centered on Filipino migrants, I think there’s probably some truth in the criticism. My own experience includes working in an Alaskan Salmon cannery back in the 1990s where the workforce was broken down into four distinct groups, Anglo Americans, Mexicans, Filipinos and Slovaks. I probably know the rhythms of a work environment like the one Chavez tried to organize better than Diego Luna does, and I don’t think he’s captured very much of what a group of agricultural laborers acts like in reality. Cesar Chavez was filmed mostly in Mexico and the scenes in Delano do indeed strike me as biased towards Mexicans against Filipinos. What’s more, they feel sanitized and didactic. There are no single, sexually frustrated young men who drink too much. Everybody has a nice Christian family.\n\nThe scenes in Delano do effectively dramatize the racism Mexican Americans experienced back in the 1960s, still experience, and just how in the tank for the ruling class the police are. One of the strongest scenes involves an attempt of the police to outlaw the world “huelga” (“strike” in Spanish), and Chavez’s wife, played by America Ferrara, leading the civil disobedience. The subplot involving the racist harassment of Chavez’s son never quite comes alive, but the local, conservative white women who come to heckle the strikers do provide a vivid image of racism and xenophobia. But don’t expect John Ford. We never really get a sense of the terror and isolation experienced by migrants. Nobody gets cheated out of wages outright, even though there are scenes where workers protest their wages being cut. There’s a pro-forma nod to feminism, but Rosario Dawson, as Dolores Huerta, really doesn’t have much to do. Compared to the way the old 1950s film Salt of the Earth puts women and their struggle at the center of the narrative, Diego Luna is well intentioned, but weak in his delivery.\n\nThe weakest scenes of Chavez, by far, are an attempt to dramatize his hunger strike. Try not to fall asleep as Michael Pena sits in bed and tries to look sick. Pena, who doesn’t really have the charisma to carry the film, seems to disappear. The narrative gets confused, and John Malcovich, as a racist, right-wing grower, steals the movie by default. Chavez’s veganism, which, as far as I know, played a major role in his work, is cut out of the story altogether.\n\nThe second half of Chavez feels like a 1970s liberal “movie of the week.” Robert Kennedy is good. Then he gets shot, and we get Nixon, and Ronald Reagan, who are both, of course, in the tank for the rich growers. That it’s all perfectly historical — Robert Kennedy did aid the grape boycott and Nixon and Reagan were in the tank for the rich — doesn’t make it work as drama. I did learn that Richard Nixon attempted to break the grape boycott by selling California grapes in Europe and having the military buy the rest, but Chavez’s trip to Europe to convince British and French labor leaders to support him might just as well been a documentary, or a TV news special.\n\nSo the final verdict? See Chavez for the historical importance of the subject, but don’t expect too much. The man himself was far more complex and interesting then Diego Luna portrays him here. The real Cesar Chavez, the anti-communist, Catholic vegan who fell into the trap of trying to raise wages by limiting immigration, deserves a better movie. This one will have to do for now."
