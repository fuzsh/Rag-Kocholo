        "text": "Ian Brown\n\nNo one arrives fashionably late for a seven-year-old's birthday party. That offends rule one of parental life-- never waste free babysitting.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nBut all seven guests at my daughter Haley's seventh birthday party were dropped off by their parents mysteriously seven minutes early. That sort of behavior is just plain rude. It was like being swarmed by a gang from Planet Tiny. They dropped their coats in the hall and immediately scattered to the farthest corners of the house like some new, instantly contagious form of biological weapon.\n\nAnd I staggered upstairs with a small mountain of coats in my arms, which is not a chore I saw myself performing back when I was young and longing to be grown up. Even when I was 11, I wanted to be married because married people, I knew, had sex every night of their lives.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nBut that's another story. I was lugging coats. Back downstairs, Trish, the mother of Katie, Haley's best friend, two best friends ago, Trish shot me a knowing look. Magician, right? How can you tell, I said. Fiber optic wands by the forks.\n\nAnd that was the first hint that my wife and I might have gone slightly over the top birthday wise. That we might have stepped over the strict moral boundary that separates caring, thoughtful parents who believe in personal attention and quality time from cheese balls like us who try to buy their way into their children's hearts.\n\nIt's easy to commit that social gaffe these days. My wife and I both work. The harder we work, the guiltier we feel. The more we want Haley's birthday parties to be-- well, visible from outer space would be gratifying. We'd been planning Haley's seventh birthday, or to be slightly more accurate, my wife, Johanna, had been planning it, and I'd been doing nothing--\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n--for weeks. What there was, was a cake iced by professionals in the shape of a magician's top hat, which cost 30 bucks, eight loot bags filled with thoughtful, age appropriate, peanut-free party favors at $15 a bag, and of course, the magician himself at $150 for two hours. He called himself the Amazing Robert.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nI don't think he meant that ironically.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nNow, I like to do something special on Haley's birthday. Still, don't you think, I said to my wife as she frantically tried to find a magician who wasn't booked three months in advance, don't you think we might be overamping? But honey, if we don't go slightly crazy, Johanna said quite logically, some other parent will. Then what's Haley going to think? And anyway, do you have a better idea?\n\nAnd I did not have a better idea. My sole contribution to the magician party had been to suggest that we include a whoopee cushion in every loot bag, or at least, it was my idea to blow them up [BLOWING] and put them in the loot bags pre-inflated. In the old days, when Haley was small, we kept her birthday simple. I learned that lesson when I lived in Los Angeles near Beverly Hills.\n\nIn Beverly Hills, parents like their children's birthday parties to have a theme and a fairly significant theme at that-- manifest destiny, say, or a NASA moon shot. In LA, I never went to a birthday party that featured anything less than pony rides. And one mother actually gave out Gucci T-shirts in the loot bags. And it was hard to compete with that.\n\nIn an act of defiance, a friend of ours, a struggling writer, staged her daughter's birthday in a park, of all places. And the kids had a good enough time. They ran around and swung on swings and played tag and generally reveled in the whole two hours when they weren't under the watchful eye of a nanny or armed response security.\n\nThe grab bags contained what grab bags are supposed to contain-- candy, rather than Rolex watches. And afterwards, the Beverly Hills parents flocked, they literally flocked around our friend. Fabulous idea, they said. Nature-- who would have thought? Can I steal a theme?\n\nBut our friend Katharine is the queen of the less is more, easy on mummy birthday party. She says children want strong experiences, not new ones, which is why last weekend, for her daughter, Mary's seventh birthday, Katharine invited six girls over to string gummy bears onto extra long bamboo satay skewers. That was the theme of the party--\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n--skewering candies on a stick. There was some risk of eye injury and the entire gimmick seemed to have Freudian undertones. The little girls kept saying, I'm going to stick this skewer up gummy's tiny butt--\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n--and giggling hysterically. But all in all, it was a winner. Only one girl barfed. The entire party cost 15 bucks-- Canadian.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nIt is true that Katharine had a pinata. Pinatas are excellent because they entail hitting an object violently with a stick. But those were the old pre-bacchanalian birthdays. By the time Haley turned five, the year of our most corrupt and therefore most successful birthday, we'd gone as low as a parent can go. We'd hired human Barbie.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nFor $300, human Barbie dressed up in full-sized versions of Barbie doll outfits and came to your house. Human Barbie arrived in a Dodge Grand Caravan with human Mitch, her assistant--\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n--two giant mobile racks of party dresses for the girls, a tea set in a case, and two chests of makeup. She dressed the kids, discussed the possibility of multiple careers, and fed them cake. All our friends were completely horrified.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nI might as well have said, oh, this year, Haley's having a crack party.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nWe're having a cake made of crack, too. My Canadian friends put this crassness down to the fact that Johanna, my wife, is an American. But successful? Well, it was as if the Dalai Lama had made a stop at our house. The girls were hypnotized with awe. They spent most of the afternoon standing in a circle, brushing human Barbie's hair.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nI had the feeling that secretly, quite a few mums wouldn't have minded giving it a try themselves. As it turned out, I needn't have worried about the Amazing Robert, the magician, either. He was a handsome guy with sideburns and a wry, if somewhat resigned, manner.\n\nHe knew what he was doing, though. He started cracking jokes with the kids right away. You must be Haley, he said to one of the boys as he walked through the door. No, Peter said. I'm a boy, and clapped his hands. Hey, the magician said. No clapping. So all the kids clapped. I said, no clapping.\n\nBy the time he started pulling eggs out of their noses, you know they were goners. And I chose that moment to run upstairs. And I find I need a moment alone at regular intervals at these kiddie birthday bashes-- also at adult parties. In fact, I could use a moment alone right about now.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nBut when I opened the door to my bedroom, what do I find lying, lying on my bed, surrounded by entire mountain ranges of miniature winter coats? Two of my adult guests holding hands. Their spouses were downstairs. I must say, they played it cool. Headache, the woman said, rubbing her temples, not that I asked. Yeah, I said. These kids' parties can be brutal.\n\nAnd I tell you, I left fast. I didn't want to ask. I certainly didn't want to know. And downstairs, the Amazing Robert was making cards disappear and reappear, but Trish, Katie's mom, she kept staring at the magician. I thought she disapproved of his tricks, but then she gave a little shriek. I know, she said. I knew I knew that magician! He has just come through a terrible divorce from a birthday clown.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nWhich pretty much says it all, doesn't it? It's terrible, getting older. The disappointments and the letdowns, but no child believes that. They want to get older. And if you're seven, you can't wait to be nine. I mean, nine, that is going to be the greatest because they think life just gets better and better and better the older you get.\n\nWe grown-ups, we know better, or we think we do, or at least we need to think we do. But I didn't have much time for such maudlin thoughts and, frankly, convoluted ones because a new sound was wafting in from the living room, a sound it is, frankly, impossible to be maudlin about.\n\n[FARTING SOUNDS]\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nThey'd found the loot bags. Crass? Sure. Cheesy? Absolutely. Grown-up? Not at all. That's what I liked about it. Thank you.\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nBeau O'reilly\n\nWhen I was a little kid, five or six, my father would do these big variety shows, these musical revues for college theater groups. And I would often appear with him, playing the bad kid in town or the clown screaming the lines of \"This Old Man\" from the top of a stepladder. And at the show's end, we would rush first to the bar, where my father knew all the girls' names, and then to the train station to catch the last train home.\n\nAnd I would get very tense then and hot in my stomach, like I was going to burn up and pass out. So we would often miss the last train home and have to spend the long hours till morning waiting in the train station, my father falling quickly asleep, his huge head thrown back in the train waiting room seat. It seemed to hang at an impossible odd angle from the rest of his body like the dot at the bottom of a question mark that knows it has to be there, but hangs odd and unattached.\n\nAnd the scene, my father drunk and snoring, a big question mark of a presence, would be repeated numbers of times over the next 25 years. My father passed out at the family table on Christmas morning, my father nodding off behind the wheel, my father snoring through the still Latin mass, my father's head thrown back in the last row during my high school production of The Glass Menagerie.\n\nBut when he was awake, he was not totally present either. He was this silent, brooding man home once a week for our family dinner. And I would sit up all night in that train station, listening to the muted rumblings of the next morning's diesel engines and the fluttering of pigeons in the ceiling above, my father's snoring made rusty and noisy by too much cigarettes and beer.\n\nWhen I was 29, something changed between me and my father. I was 29, very drunk most days. And I came home to Chicago to work for my father, I guess. I had rarely seen him in my alcoholic adulthood, his alcoholic adulthood having taken him away from the family circle years ago. And when my father, he got me this job as a house manager and sometimes understudy at his theater on Lincoln Avenue. And he was warm and kind about it, I guess.\n\nThis kindness was unusual. It was hard for me to recognize it. I didn't know whether it was kindness really or not. Maybe he just recognized something in my swaying walk and my overly bright, loud way of speaking, a kindred alcoholic spirit. We would from then on do our drinking together late nights at the pub next door to the theater, a pub where we could sit for hours, get a burger and a beer, a pub where my father ran a tab, and I was always on the tab.\n\nNow, the pub tables were family long, with my father always at the head and crowded with actors and confidants, all with one ear pointed at my father, hoping for a good joke from him, which usually came, or some word of praise, which came rarer, but when delivered, were always delivered with a flair and a passion.\n\nThese tables would start full, full of people and huge pints of black Guinness and brown beer, but by 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning, they would be empty, except for my father and I. Me talking loud and feverish now, lovers and women and broken hearts and politics and plays and broken hearts and lost lovers and lost women and broken hearts. And me doing most of the talking, my father nodding and grimacing, looking appropriately sad.\n\nBut his eyes looking away always, scanning the bodies of the young women who moved about in the pub's waning hours. Sometimes these women stopped by the table to speak to my father, him finding sly ways to kiss and touch and pinch them, locking their eyes with his as if his eyes were gift enough to allow him his inappropriate touching.\n\nThe pub would close with us still in it, the tables having adopted the chairs and now holding them piggyback. And my father would sign his tab with a flourish, and we would part company. Me often watching him walk slowly up Lincoln Avenue, a large man with a lordly old-fashioned head, always aware that he was like something out of Shakespeare or O'Neill. He might be swaying, but swaying with a charm and a dignity.\n\nThe further my father got up the street, the more real he felt to me. There. There. That was the father I knew, half a courtyard away under the hot lights doing Shakespeare's Lear or Brecht's Galileo. And I would stand on Lincoln Avenue crying, the crying of a 29-year-old drunken baby whose father is moving away, always moving away. And that baby knows he's better off having Dad go.\n\nI learned a lot watching my father's theater that year, wonderful productions of Playboy of the Western World and Ronald Harwood's The Dresser, Brian Friel's Translations. My father's performances were always in the center of the plays. And I was the house manager. I was skittish in a baggy suit and non-matching vintage ties, greeting the audience at the door, selling them coffee, but mostly watching the performances night after night.\n\nMy understudy assignment was not something any of us ever expected to use, but one week, here it comes. An actor could not appear, and I was to play my father's tortured, crippled son. It was an Irish play about an Irish father and his Irish sons, and I was an Irish son, never mind that I had an Irish brogue like Ringo Starr's Liverpool.\n\nAnd I'd never appeared on a professional stage. There would be one rehearsal. My father not even on stage, but seated in the audience, chain smoking, hung over, barking orders, orders that moved my body hot and frightened, clumsily around the stage, me mumbling the lines and standing in all the wrong places.\n\nAnd the night of the performance, I was pacing and shaking in the hall outside of the green room where my father and the rest of the cast were making up and preparing to perform. I could hear them talking, but they couldn't see me at all. They didn't know I was there.\n\nAnd one of the actors said, with a good actor's projection and precise actor's diction, \"Get ready for amateur night.\" \"What did you say?\" My father said it quietly, but with force. \"Get ready for amateur night.\" \"Well, he'll be fine. You worry about yourself. Prick.\"\n\nNow, this is the only time I ever heard my father defend me. And I now realize the significance of that. But at the time, I was very angry. And it was the anger that burned the fear out of me like a fog on a new hot summer Sunday. And I was fine when I hit the stage. I was understudy good enough.\n\nAnd when I played to my father, his eyes a deep well into the heart of Brian Friel's Translations, I actually enjoyed myself. There were moments of real emotion between us. And on the stage, my father was really there. Like I could reach out and touch him, and he would really be there.\n\nAnd when the lights came down, I stumbled offstage, tripping and falling in the dark. My father was waiting, his big, noble actor head shaggy with sweat, his arms open to receive me. We, hugging, missed the curtain call-- probable first for my father. He was not one to miss a curtain call.\n\nA few months later, my father fired me during his production of The Dresser by Ronald Harwood. My father playing Sir, a bullying, tyrannical, Shakespearean actor Sir. My father was not one to shrink from typecasting.\n\nAnd one of my assignments was to meet him in the lobby, holding a towel, which he would use to wipe the makeup and sweat from his face before returning to the stage for the curtain call. I wasn't there with the towel. I had wandered off to the pub for a pint before the show ended.\n\nThe truth be told, there were probably many nights when I wasn't there. I was off crying into the phone, running off the long distance phone bill for the theater or selling dope out of the theater concession stand to my friends. I was 29 and drunk most of the time.\n\nAnd my father, he recognized me for what I was. I was becoming very much like him in my 29th year, and perhaps he was embarrassed and uncomfortable having to see himself in me every day. And he was fired soon after from his theater on Lincoln Avenue. And we continued to meet in the pub night after night for many months."
