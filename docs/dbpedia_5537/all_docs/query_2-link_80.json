        "text": "Stuttgart EATS!\n\nLiving in Stuttgart, Germany has been a culinary dream, here is my list of Stuttgart EATS! There is no shortage of great eats in this region. To be successful in the restaurant business in Europe I have learned you must have great, consistent service, fresh food, and seasonal specialties. Stuttgart EATS a LOT! A plethora of restaurants in every town no matter if it is a suburb or right downtown, you will typically find a great restaurant in close proximity of anywhere you are in Baden-Württemberg.\n\nSo I promised before I left, I would share some of my favorites after five years. From Thai to Italian to Swabian and everything in between. Some are just outside of Stuttgart and some right here, a train ride away.\n\nHere’s a caveat – People are very passionate about food and restaurants, these are my favorites. Nevertheless, I respect and honor yours too – if you have some please share in the comments below – I’m a sharer.\n\nSwabian DELIGHTs\n\nErbachstüble\n\nADDRESS- Erbachstraße 27/1, 71106 Magstadt\n\nPHONE – 07159 42557\n\nOn the MENU ~\n\nSchnitzel, Zweibelrostbraten, Maultaschen, Fresh Forellen (white fish), Salmon, pasta dishes and seasonal specialties.\n\nSALADS – my favorite is a Salad with bacon-wrapped goat cheese fresh mix salad with french vinaigrette,\n\nCevapcici (little hamburger links with red pepper sauce) to\n\nThis counter-pounding, slapping schnitzel favorite local place will be the freshest schnitzel you’ve had in Stuttgart.\n\nThe children’s menu is excellent – however, their menu is not in English but if you ask them they will help you out.\n\nNavi and Uli own this little restaurant tucked away in Magstadt and I think we have eaten here once a week for five years. Additionally, they not only have a fantastic restaurant but are a part of our German family.\n\nUli is Austrian and was trained in France as a Chef who lives in Germany and is married to Navi who is from the Balkans so the menu has an amazing variety.\n\nRESERVATIONS are recommended on weekend nights – closed on Tuesdays and Saturdays\n\n2. Deutsches Haus\n\nADDRESS – Kaltenwanghof 1, 73235 Weilheim\n\nPHONE – 07023 740098\n\nlocated between Stuttgart and Ulm, definitely worth the hop of the interstate for a bite\n\nLocal favorites made with local ingredients\n\nGreat staff\n\nReasonably priced\n\nReservations are highly recommended for lunch and dinner\n\nHuge space for off-site functions (4 dining rooms)\n\nGreat views of the Swabian valley\n\n3. Cafe am Markt\n\nADDRESS – Vaihinger Markt 14, 70563 Stuttgart\n\nPHONE – 0711 74008183\n\nlocated in the heart of Vaihingen, this cozy cafe is one of the BEST breakfast restaurants in the Stuttgart area\n\nEspecially, try the Omelette menu with so many choices you’ll want to visit weekly to try a new one\n\nREAL BACON~ enough said\n\nCafe, coffee and pastries also with an extensive tea selection\n\nOutdoor seating in the market square\n\nGreat SERVICE!\n\nBella Italia\n\n3. Gustaggio’s\n\nADDRESS – Mercedesstrasse 3, 71063 Sindelfingen\n\nPHONE – 07031-7641910\n\nDefinitely, our favorite location is Sindelfingen because it is so close to home in Magstadt, but with two, one in Leonberg too, so they must be doing GREAT! YAY!\n\nGustaggio’s has a fantastic menu\n\nPizzas that taste authentically Italian\n\nPastas, Salads, Sweets and a great BAR!\n\nI love it because it is your way, Italian way – you can choose your pasta, your sauce and YOU can watch them do it all! With a brick oven stove and a glass encasement you can see all the Chefs hard at work making your meal\n\nIncredible salads – one of my favorite is the VEGGI ~ it has grilled vegetables, fresh mozzarella, tomatoes and a light vinaigrette, YUM!\n\nMAKE RESERVATIONs – especially if you are later than 7:00 p.m. – it’s so good it is always busy.\n\n4. Italiani (ma non troppo)\n\nADDRESS -Milan Square 23, 70173 Stuttgart\n\nPHONE – 0711-28413444\n\nNewly discovered (for me) Italian restaurant right across from the Milaneo mall.\n\nDelicious menu with lots of seafood options\n\nDaily specials\n\nPIZZA can be made Gluten-FREE\n\nSaturdays from 11:30 – 6 p.m. ALL Pizzas are €6.50\n\nMake RESERVATIONS\n\nDon’t forget about my TRAVEL E-BOOKS!\n\nIt’s all GREEK to me\n\n5. Mylos\n\nADDRESS – Mercedesstr. 1 , 71063 Sindelfingen\n\nPHONE – 07031 466780\n\nFresh greek every day, every night\n\nLove the service – very friendly and speak great English\n\nMenu is perfectly greek and portions are GREAT too\n\nNice bar as well and complimentary ouzo when we left!\n\nMake RESERVATIONS\n\n*This blog contains affiliate partnerships. Every little bit (and I mean little) helps me continue to provide free travel tips and advice. Thank you for supporting ©Travel with Wendy.\n\nSteaks\n\n6. Sindelfingen Marriott\n\nADDRESS – Mahdentalstraße 68, 71065 Sindelfingen\n\nPHONE – 07031 6960\n\nWe have searched for the BEST steaks of Stuttgart and easily the Sindelfingen Marriott has won- hands-down\n\nSteaks are pricier than we have in the states but they are coming from Kansas, so there you go. My husband’s favorite is the Ribeye (he’s from Missouri) Mine is the petite filet with the Bernaise sauce. They have several sauces to pair as well as sides that are typical from the states\n\nMake reservations especially on weekends\n\nThis newly renovated property shines with attentive service and everyone speaks English. Ask for Sam or Victoria, tell them Wendy sent you.\n\n7.
