        "text": "Vintage Nicaragua says:\n\nSomeone have photos of prince name Ahmed Fakhri, i don´t know if im reading well, let me explain you.\n\nIm from Satiago de Chile and live in Santiago and Central America. My grandfather was in the diplomatic mission in late 40s and 50s in France.\n\nMy grandmother met princess Fawzia (divorced already of the Shah) in a party in honor of Salvador Dalí. Grandmama met princess Fathia too, the princess was close to one of my grandmother´s best friend; a mexican name Gloria Rubio. I know all this because my grandmother told me; Fawzia had a nephew or a cousin, not sure name; Ahmed, she introduce to doña Gloria because she wanted to marry Gloria with Ahmed, and they married in the end. In fact Gloria always sent money to princess Fathia when she lived in the United States. I don´t know how the looks like, if someone ave pictures can upload it?\n\ncheers!\n\n12:26PM, 10 August 2008 PDT\n\nMetro50 says:\n\nI came across this reference to a Gloria Rubio in a 1960s US paper. Is this the lady you mention?\n\nIf so, perhaps I can research further and discover reference to the prince..?\n\n------------------------------\n\n\"Mexican-born Gloria Rubio von Furstenberg came to Paris from Spain at the end of the War with her two small children, they had very little money, and Gloria's love of clothes and perfectionist taste necessitated long and intricate maneuvers to dress beautifully. Dolores, she says, hung on every word.\n\nToday they do a great deal of their shopping together, though not always to buy the same designer's clothes. Gloria prefers Balenciaga, Dior and Castillo. Dolores is mainly a Givenchy fan.\n\nGloria has jet black hair and golden skin, Dolores is a pale honey blonde. The mother's eyes are black, her daughter's are green. But both are tall and w i l l o w y , without a spare ounce of fat, with long necks, long legs and long expressive hands.\n\nSaid Gloria: \"Dolores and I like everything narrow long slim figures in long and narrow dresses. We both like black bent and white next. For the daytime a beige or brown suit may alternate with the one certain black which serves as a kind of Man Friday, useful night and day.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nMaybe I'll hear from you....\n\nRegards\n\nGRS\n\nages ago\n\nVintage Nicaragua says:\n\nYes she was, she aka; Gloria Guinness...\n\nif im not wrong prince Ahmed was the son of princess Fawkia, eldest daughter of Fuad I. I can´t remember very well some stuff i used when i was little and my grandmama died already.\n\nI think they married in Paris, not sure if in the Mexican Embassy, because Gloria still mexican citizen.\n\nIn that moment Gloria was broke (no money), she was divorced of Franz Fürstenberg, she run away of nazis to Portugal and then in Madrid she met the prince Ahmed who was the son of the egyptian ambassador in Spain. In Paris princess Fawzia convinced her to marry with the prince and in that way she solved her economic problem.\n\nEverybody attended to Gloria´s mansion in Paris; Porfirio Rubirosa, Helena Paz Garro, and of course the princess Fawzia, that my grandmother said , the princess had a perfect french as if her native language was french\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nVintage Nicaragua edited this topic ages ago.\n\nMetro50 says:\n\nMoving right along, now we agree on Gloria Rubio/Guiness..... I can produce many news items about her, but nothing so far connecting with an Egyptian prince....\n\nThere is plenty of news about 'Dr. Ahmed Fakhri,' but no princely connection, for instance:\n\n\" where my friend, Dr. Ahmed Fakhri of Cairo University has been excavating a new pyramid.\n\nIt's pretty exciting, clawing into a new pyramid. Until the day we arrived they hadn't been able to tell who the pyramid belonged to.\n\nOn the day 'of our arrival in the desert Dr. Fakhri's assistants had just found a pillar identifying the tomb. The diggings belong to the wife of one King Isesi, a fifth dynasty gentleman who passed along about 2500 B. C.\n\nJANUARY 3, 1953\"\n\nI will dig a little deeper...\n\nGRS\n\nPS\n\nI read that Gloria Rubio married into the fabulosly wealthy Guiness family in 1954. When did her alleged marriage to Prince Ahmed take place..?\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nMetro50 (a group admin) edited this topic ages ago.\n\nI.Eldewek says:\n\nMes Dames et Monsieurs,\n\nThis is what i found out about Gloria Guiness at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Guinness\n\nShe was one busy lady :)\n\nGloria Guinness (born Gloria Rubio y Alatorre, August 27, 1912 - November 9, 1980) was a Mexican-born socialite and writer who was a contributing editor to Harper's Bazaar from 1963 until 1970. She also was a member of the International Best Dressed List.\n\nReportedly born in Veracruz, Mexico,[1] she was a daughter of José Rafael Rubio, a Mexican journalist, and his wife, Dolores Alatorre. As a young woman, she was employed as a nightclub hostess before moving to Germany.\n\nHer first husband was a German-born resident of Mexico named Scholtens, from whom she was divorced.[3][4]\n\nShe married on 4 October 1935, in London, England, as her second husband, Franz-Egon, Count von Fürstenberg-Hedringen (1896-1975); she was his second wife. By him, she had one daughter, Baroness Dolores (born 31 July 1936)[5] and a son, Baron Franz-Egon (born 27 July 1939).[6] She also had a stepdaughter from her husband's first marriage, the actress Betsy von Furstenberg. According to her friend Etti Plesch, Gloria Rubio Scholtens was introduced to Fürstenberg by her mentor, newspaper heir, diplomat, and art collector Friedrich Horstmann, who reportedly \"dressed her up and presented her at a dinner as a mysterious aristocrat.\"[7]\n\nHer third husband was Ahmed Fakhri Bey (1921-1988), a grandson of King Fuad I of Egypt and a nephew of Princess Fawzia of Egypt (the first wife of Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, Shah of Iran) and King Farouk I of Egypt.[8] During her marriage to Fakhri, she also was a mistress of the British ambassador to France, Duff Cooper.[9] After her divorce, Gloria Fakhri became involved with both Loel Guinness and David Beatty, 2nd Earl Beatty.\n\nHer fourth husband, whom she married in 1951, was Group Capt. Thomas Loel Guinness, a Member of Parliament (1906-1988) and a member of the extended Guinness beer family, though his particular branch made its fortune in banking and real estate. Of him, she told Noel Coward, \" I could never sleep with Loel. He farts too much.\" There is also a long-standing rumor that Gloria Guinness was employed at some point as a spy and that when she married her fourth husband, she had no valid passport and was legally a citizen of no country.\n\nShe was dressed by Cristóbal Balenciaga, Marc Bohan at Christian Dior, Chanel, Hubert de Givenchy and Yves Saint Laurent. But she also favored the Spaniard Antonio Canovas del Castillo del Rey at Lanvin (clothing). She was one of the first persons to wear the capri pants by Emilio Pucci\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nI.Eldewek edited this topic ages ago.\n\nI.Eldewek says:\n\nWhile researching about Gloria, I came a cross this very interesting article that can be found at www.lookonline.com/2005/04/doyle-new-york-to-auction-impo...\n\nIts with regards to Princess Fawkeya, the mother of ahmed Fakhri Bey.\n\nHere's the part that interested me:\n\n\" Friday, April 15, 2005\n\nDOYLE NEW YORK TO AUCTION IMPORTANT VINTAGE COUTURE, TEXTILES AND ACCESSORIES ON APRIL 20, 2005\n\nA special section of the auction will feature couture from the collection of Princess Fawkia of Egypt. She was the half sister of King Farouk and the mother of Ahmed Fakhri Bey who married Gloria Rubio y Alatorre, the international socialite who would later be known as Gloria Guinness, one of Truman Capote's captivating \"swans.\" The collection of Princess Fawkia traces her years as the royal wife of the Egyptian Minister to France and features 1930s designs by Worth, Vionnet, Maggy Rouf and Hermes, including a stunning paisley printed crepe de chine gown and a claret colored leather bag by Worth.\"\n\nI wonder who bought those beautiful outfits and wonder where did the huge wardrobes that used to belong to our princesses go? they certainly didn't evaporate, but I guess things disappear..........\n\nages ago"
