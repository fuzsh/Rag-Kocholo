        "text": "Gloria Guinness, a.k.a. the Ultimate, had a way with flower arrangements. That is, if the Mexican glamour girl (1912–1980) with the bracing self-confidence—“Chic? It is absolutely innate, I was born with it,” the feisty Veracruz native once said—didn’t have someone on her household staff patiently clipping and primping. Which very likely she did.\n\nIn the duplex apartment that the international style leader and her British banker husband maintained in Paris at 18 avenue Matignon, a single massive arrangement of blooms was typically stationed at one end of the salon, atop a grand piano that itself was tucked behind a fringed velvet sofa. And by massive, I mean perplexingly, flamboyantly big bouquets, often as wide as they were tall. They were as much a part of Guinness’s personal style as the Balenciaga hostess coats she wore for dinners at home in Paris or the silk cardigans with Pucci pants that were her uniform when at Gemini, the couple’s 39-room British Colonial–style compound in Manalapan, Florida.\n\nPhotographs of Guinness or of her almost-as-stylish daughter, Dolores, often show them posing in the vicinity of the same heavy, flared glass vase, shaded by floriferous offerings stretching far and wide, from lilac branches frothing with purple and white blossoms to a carnival of multicolor gladioli and lilies to a starchy panache of pinwheeling chrysanthemums.\n\nThe arrangements’ grandiose scale couldn’t have been more practical: The ceiling of the Ultimate’s Paris living room was over 20 feet high. Georges Geffroy did the decorating honors—that past master of sumptuous settings isn’t much thought about these days—and the vertical folds of the sweeping panels of fabric that flowed down from the imperial cornice and then parted over the windows, the fireplace, and the towering bookshelves made the space seem even loftier. Huge bunches of flowers mitigated the architectural scale; polite little bouquets, however pretty, would have been utterly defeated.\n\nSo make this your decorative dictum: Whether your taste is for potted trees or hothouse blooms, know that the higher the ceiling and the larger the room, the more impressive Mother Nature’s display must be."
