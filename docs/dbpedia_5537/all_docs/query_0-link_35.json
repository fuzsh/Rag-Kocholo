        "text": "Lil Ceng\n\nLil Ceng grew up in the German city of Saarbrücken and was introduced to breakdance by his cousin when he was only 10 years old. It was a performance of the Flying Steps on TV that marked the beginning of a life-long passion. By the time he was just 16 years old, Gengis (alias Lil' Ceng) had already cemented his place in the Flying Steps crew. That accomplishment alone proves just what a stand-out talent the Macedonian-born b-boy is. Recognized from early on as one of the best power move dancers in the world, Lil' Ceng wins over crowds with his creative and dynamic styles which are inspired by Jackie Chan and Ryan Leslie.\n\nAnna Holmström\n\nFor Anna classical music is \"a way of expressing emotions and of telling a story without using words\". The Swedish dancer perceives it as \"a very powerful language when listened to\". At the age of 14, Anna moved from her hometown of Lindsberg to Stockholm where she studied dance at the Royal Swedish Ballet School and the Diambra Dance Education. But contemporary dance, ballet and jazz aren't Anna's only passion. She was also part of the Swedish rhythmic gymnastics national team from 2003 to 2007. Today, she contributes her athleticism and skill to Flying Bach.\n\nAmigo\n\nAmigo started his career as a dancer in Berlin – as one of the founding members of the Flying Steps. In 1994 and 2000 he and the Flying Steps won the infamous international breakdance battle Battle of the Year. Amigo's roots are planted in hip hop but his branches grow into different directions, letting him take his very own, innovative path.\n\nBenny\n\nBenny is one of the most influential figures in breakdance, not only because he is the inventor of the Continue Airflare – which is now officially recognized at the Olympic Games – but also because he has become a Red Bull Icon. His power move and freeze innovations had such a strong impact on the scene that he was immortalized in the PlayStation game \"B-Boy The Game\". He's also in the Guinness Book of Records with the most free-hand turns on his head (aka head spin). Benny is part of Flying Steps since a very long time, he also developes many choreos like for Flying Illusion and Flying Bach, is responsible for the dancers cast and also works as a music-producer.\n\nChizu Kimura\n\nChizu started to dance when she was only 5 years old. She is a graduate of the Legat School of Dance as well as of the London Studio Center. After a few years at the Vienna Festival Ballet in London she came to Berlin in 2005. As a freelance dancer she has worked with various choreographers such as Trisha Brown, Michael Rooney, Norman Douglas and Yui Kawaguchi. Since 2009 Chizu has also been dedicated to her own projects, amongst others, with the Berlin-based violinist and composer Hoshiko Yamane. In addition, she regularly teaches advanced and professional dancers in the styles of ballet and contemporary. She is also a certified Gyrotonic and Gyrokinesis trainer.\n\nDemon\n\nPower moves are his specialty: \"It's probably the most difficult discipline because you have to overcome the limits of physics through technology and power. But if you succeed, you just feel free.\" Demon started to breakdance in 1998. With his crews \"Alliance\" and \"Silent Trix\" he took part in worldwide battles and won i.e. the The Freestyle Session 2010-Battle in the category Powermoves. In the following year he became part of the Flying Steps and has been on stage for Flying Illusion since 2014.\n\nHong Nguyen\n\nHong Thai is a native Vietnamese and in Berlin since 1979. Already in 1990 he discovered breakdance as his thing. Together with his crew \"5 Amox\" he celebrated numerous successes at international championships, like the Battle of the Year and the B-Boy World Championship. For more than 25 years he has been on stage for well-known varietés and dance theaters. These include the UFA Fabrik, Friedrichstadtpalast, Chameleon Theater, HAU and his own production Noas Bar. In April 2018 his project \"Dolores - Pain\", which he directs, will have its premiere. His unconventional style mixes breakdance with contemporary. Renowned for his \"good eye\", he has also been a passionate choreographer and photographer for several years.\n\nJunior\n\nIn the small harbor town of St. Malo in the north-west of France, 14-year-old Junior discovered his passion for breakdance – and conquered the world's stages from there. In 2001 he won the Battle of the Year with the crew \"Wanted Posse\". In 2007 he was the winner of the second edition of France's Got Talent. His achievements as a dancer were celebrated in the b-boy scene. Junior was on the road in over seventy countries to give workshops, participate in Battles and act as a jury member. In 2013, he became a member of the Flying Steps and is part of the Flying Illusion Show. What makes him so unique? His way of b-boying! Nobody else has a comparable upper body strength and flexibility at the same time: Junior dances better on his hands than others on their feet.\n\nKalli\n\nWhen growing up in Greece, Kalli turned the 12 square meter of her bedroom into her first stage. She danced along to internet dance tutorials, created her own choreographies and tried to implement them with her own style. The result: Nowadays her stage is definitely bigger. Today Kalli gives workshops in her home country Greece, as well as in Germany and France. Her diligence and dancer's talent helped her to win battles like the Free Spirit and Dance Delight.

Ever since Mikel has been dedicated to support young b-boy talents. Mikel has been a member of the crew ever since Flying Bach hit the stages for the first time. Until 2015 he danced in every single show. Today – when on Flying Bach world tour – Mikel is the stage director and responsible for the production, especially for the artistic management and workshops in the respective local b-boy scene.
