Camp Upton was situated in the area that is now Brookhaven Labs in Yaphank, Long Island. There were thousands of men trained there during 1917 to 1918 and while the majority of the men were from the New York metropolitan area, there were also many from as far away as the states of California and Washington. It was at this Army base that Sgt. Irving Berlin wrote the famous song, “Oh, how I hate to get up in the morning.” Women are also listed in these naturalization records as three Army nurses naturalized while at Camp Upton.\n\nThese naturalization records are of extreme importance not only to genealogical researchers but also to others trying to find either historical or personal information. The Suffolk County Clerk's office is the custodian of the records and since they are now computerized, they can easily answer requests to their office for naturalization information.\n\nThis database has importance not only to New Yorkers but also to many from all over the United States, particularly for soldiers who were processed for discharge at the end of World War I in November 1918. These men were very often not from the New York area. It is suggested that if you can't find a relative who became a citizen during the World War I period, no matter where they lived originally, check the Camp Upton naturalization records.\n\nWhen requesting a copy of the original records, please provide all information on the form.\n\nWe have provided a printable form to request Naturalization Records from Suffolk County.
