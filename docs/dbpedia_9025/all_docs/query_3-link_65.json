He is co-founder of one of the city's premier brass bands, the New Orleans Nightcrawlers, and was the recipient of Offbeat Magazine's award for best tuba player for 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2012.\n\nMatt is also an accomplished composer and arranger having written and arranged for projects by The Dukes of Dixieland and the Boston Pops, Ingrid Lucia, The Indigo Girls, The BOSE Big Band, The US Army Orchestra and First Brass Ensemble, Lillian Boutte, The New Orleans Nightcrawlers, Wooden Nickel Jass Band, The Esberg Music Conservatory Ensemble and others.
