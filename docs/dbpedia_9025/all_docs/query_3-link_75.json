        "text": "The Tin Men are America's premier sousaphone, washboard and guitar trio. They have been performing at home in New Orleans, around the USA and abroad since 2002, and have recently released their 6th record, \"Hit It!\" The new CD/LP finds percussionist/vocalist Washboard Chaz, sousaphonist Matt Perrine and Guitarist vocalist Alex McMurray exploring a truly eclectic array of North American Pop music. Through it all they put their own zany spin on the material and make it their own. Throw in a generous dose of McMurray's own songs, the precocious wit of Perrine's sousaphone and Washboard Chazâ€™s seemingly boundless charm and the result is what has been described as \"One of the most interesting bands to emerge from New Orleans in years\" (Offbeat Magazine)"
