        "text": "A polka — that’s one musical genre Bonerama attempted that didn’t quite work. At least this one time. The music side trip materialized live, says trombonist and vocalist Mark Mullins, during the whirl and stomp of the New Orleans band’s rendering of The Edgar Winter Group’s instrumental “Frankenstein.”\n\n“We maybe stumbled into a polka once in the middle of ‘Frankenstein,’ if I remember correctly,” says Mullins, calling the step into the genre unfavorable. “And that was the first and last time it’ll happen.”\n\nBut the band’s surveying of other genres is an unfolding exploration. Bonerama calls themselves a “New Orleans brass, funk, rock” outfit, but there’s so much more there. This is a band unafraid to launch into one genre, work it for its worth and then resurface out of the song following another trail of music. So brass, funk and rock, but also jazz, gospel, blues and even reggae. The group’s uninhibited voyages through a range of musical genres mirrors the group’s appreciation of other sounds outside of the New Orleans standards of jazz and funk.\n\n“I think whatever we’ve tried, it is just because we like that kind of music,” says Mullins by phone from New Orleans. “If we like it, it seems to kind of work. A lot of times we don’t set out with, ‘This is going to be a reggae song,’ or ‘This is going to be a hardcore, funk jam.’ Sometimes they just happen. That’s the beauty of Bonerama. Not really knowing what’s going to happen but just putting these great musicians together, and it happening naturally. It’s just awesome. We try not to think too much about it. Just play stuff and see where it goes.”\n\nPerhaps the only constant of Bonerama’s sound, besides that brass, funk, rock foundation, is the outfit’s sound is led by three trombones. Yes, three trombones. Joining Mullins is Bonerama co-founder and fellow trombonist and vocalist, Craig Klein. The third trombone is supplied by Greg Hicks with Bert Cotton joining in on guitar. Those are the four pillars of Bonerama. Bass and drums — both live or in the studio — are furnished by a rotating cast of musicians. (For Sunday’s show at South on Main, Bonerama’s rhythm section is bassist Ron Williams and drummer Alvin Ford Jr., who also plays with the Dirty Dozen Brass Band.)\n\nThe group’s shifting rhythm section keeps Bonerama’s sound “fresh,” Mullins says. “When someone new comes in there’s this slightly different take on the songs, and the jams can go in different directions,” he says. “It keeps everyone on their toes a little bit.”\n\nBoth Mullins and Klein originally met in the ’80s in New Orleans, and in 1990, the two joined Harry Connick Jr.’s big band, playing live and on such albums as the platinum-selling Blue Light, Red Light, and the Grammy-winning Songs I Heard. (Asked about his former boss becoming an American Idol judge, Mullins says, “I think it’s great. I probably won’t be watching; I’m not the biggest fan of the show. But I respect it for what it is. I think it’s great he’s back in front of people again. I think he’s gonna do great.”)\n\nBy the summer of 1998, Mullins had a weekly residency at the famed New Orleans club Tipitina’s. He was given free reign over this night; Klein had an idea. “Craig had seen this Latin band in New York that had multiple trombones, and he got the idea to do something like that but more along the lines of something from a New Orleans perspective,” Mullins says. “He approached me about it when we had some off time [from Connick]. We just thought it would be something fun to do in our off time.”\n\nThe pair also had another motive behind creating this trombone-heavy super session at Tipitina’s: promoting their favored instrument, the bastard, brass brother of the trumpet — the trombone. “There’s a lot you can do with the trombone that we didn’t think was connecting with people,” Mullins says. “We didn’t think people were appreciating the instrument enough.”\n\nNew Orleans trombone players started coming to join the weekly show and so did music fans, and Mullins and Klein’s night of trombone praise soon became something much more. A band. From the very beginning, neither musician was afraid of exploring their musical influences on stage. For Mullins, outside of jazz, that meant rock. The aforementioned “Frankenstein” and tunes by Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Black Sabbath and more.\n\n“We didn’t want to have any rules or boundaries or genre obstacles in our way,” Mullins says. “People find plenty of brass bands in New Orleans that are so great and do what they do. We knew this was different, just because, first of all, we had the multiple trombones together and that was going to be different right there. But also, putting our interests together. I’m a big fan of rock music. Craig loves and plays so much of the traditional music. Putting these things together is just a natural representation of the music we like, and the trombone is our voice to put that stuff out there.”\n\nIn 2001, Bonerama, which by now included Cotton, released their first album, Live at the Old Point, an effort recorded at the Algiers bar across from the French Quarter. Other live albums followed from the band, which at times featured up to five trombonists, including Brian O’Neill, who died in 2005. Mullins and Klein both continued playing with Connick during the early years of Bonerama, but the brass, funk, rock band is now their main musical outlet, although Bonerama members are in-demand session musicians, playing with a host of other bands, both from New Orleans and elsewhere.\n\nIn May 2013, Bonerama released their first full-length studio album, Shake It Baby. (The band’s discography also includes two studio EPs: one with OK Go titled You’re Not Alone and Hard Times, which includes a studio version of Led Zeppelin’s “When the Levee Breaks.”) Shake It Baby is more of Bonerama’s celebratory music, heavy on the electric guitar but still freewheeling with the tripled-up-trombone sound guiding the outfit. And included among the tunes is a hard-and-heavy, funkified, trombone-throwdown version of Hendrix’s “Manic Depression.”\n\n“I don’t think twice about [playing these rock songs],” Mullins says. “There’s nothing really crazy about it. You just haven’t heard it with these sounds before. It’s really fun, but for us we are just playing music that we like.”\n\nSEE THE SHOW\n\nBonerama visits the Oxford American’s cultural experience spot South on Main on Sunday. The doors open at 6 p.m. with the music starting at 7 p.m. Tickets — if still available — are $17. Seating is general admission for the all-ages show."
