        "text": "We know you like it horny and there’s nothing like the full-on, horn powered sound of Bonerama. Their 2019 record on Basin Street Records, “Bonerama Plays Zeppelin” is a wonder for its brassy audacity and sheer power. And like the seminal rock band they honor, the muscular arrangements and nimble execution of the time-tested songs thrill to the marrow. Brass, funk, rock — it’s an intoxicating stew. With three trombones, sousaphone, drums and bass, Bonerama shows are electrifying. They carry New Orleans brass traditions into the bombastic world of rock, and hip-grinding funk excursions make you feel the heat of the Crescent City. As the band says, Bonerama has been changing the way you think about trombone for 20 years!\n\nGET TEXT NEWS & UPDATES\n\nSign up and stay in the loop for news, daily schedules, event reminders and announcements.
