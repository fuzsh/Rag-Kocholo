Bonerama is a New Orleans musical institution. They are one of the most genuine, unique and interesting bands to have ever come out of the Crescent City. Bonerama incorporates jazz, brass, funk, fusion, soul, pop, rock, blues, a touch of alternative and even a bit of reggae into its one-of-a-kind sound. Three trombones front the band, plus a sousaphone, guitar and drums all delivering a powerful sound that you have to hear to believe.\n\nKnown the world over for its incendiary live performances, Bonerama has been bringing its specialized brand of New Orleans music to the masses for 20 years. Bonerama is currently comprised of Mullins (trombone, electric trombone and lead vocals), Klein (trombone and lead vocals), Greg Hicks (trombone and vocals), Bert Cotton (guitar), Matt Perrine (sousaphone and electric bass) and Walt Lundy (drums).\n\nHot Like Fire finds Bonerama developing its dynamic, high-energy, fun, happy and bold moods further than ever before. The New Orleans stalwarts deliver nine wonderfully brassy musical landscapes--seven of which are original compositions (including the concert staple \"Mr. Okra\") along with powerful covers of Radiohead's \"Paranoid Android\" and the late Allen Toussaint's \"Basic Lady.\" The album was produced by Mark Mullins, Craig Klein and Tracey Freeman and recorded at Music Shed Recording Studios in New Orleans.\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.

These bands all carry the trombone like the trophy it truly is in New Orleans. And Bonerama helped cement that in present day New Orleans music culture.\n\nThe band has performed and recorded with countless national artists such as R.E.M., OKGo, Tom Morello, Wayne Kramer (MC5), Jill Sobule and so many more, all while bringing their distinctive sounds from New Orleans to a national spotlight. Festivals and events such as Monterey Jazz Fest to High Sierra Music Festival, Jam Cruise, Bear Creek Festival and of course the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival only outline the extensive festival work this band has seen. National television appearances on CBS (Late Show with David Letterman), HBO (Comic Relief, Treme) and CNN have further exposed Bonerama to a wide range of unsuspecting new viewers.\n\nWhile enduring lineup changes, member displacement, tragedy and loss over the years, the song for Bonerama has remained the same; being centered around their beloved trombone, city and culture\n\nwhile striving for greatness with a fun spirit.\n\nWhether it’s their inventive covers or funky, rocking originals, rest assured, Bonerama will take you on your most memorable RIDE ON THE SLIDE!"
