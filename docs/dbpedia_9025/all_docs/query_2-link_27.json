        "text": "The Town of Avon present free community concerts\n\nAvon, CO – We invite the community to join us at the Avon Performance Pavilion at Harry A. Nottingham Park on Wednesday, June 21 as we continue the AvonLIVE! summer concert series starting at 5:30 p.m. Headlining is Bonerama, a band that in many ways defies categorization. A funky rock band with brass…a funky brass band that rocks. Gates open at 5:30 p.m. and Bonerama takes the stage at 7:30 p.m.\n\nBonerama is a New Orleans-based band that fuses everything that has made that city’s music famous into a genre defying gumbo. The band has taken the best elements of rock, soul, fusion, pop, jazz, funk, brass, gospel, and blues to forge its unique sound.\n\nFormed in 1998, Bonerama is the brainchild of trombone players Mark Mullins and Craig Klein (who from 1990-2006, were also members of Harry Connick Jr.’s big band). Currently comprised of Mullins (trombone, electric trombone, and lead vocals), Klein (trombone and lead vocals), Greg Hicks (trombone and vocals), Bert Cotton (lead guitar), Matt Perrine (sousaphone and electric bass) and Walt Lundy (drums), Bonerama is one of the funkiest and most unique bands to ever come out of New Orleans.\n\nEqually adept at delivering extraordinary originals or blistering covers of artists as diverse as Led Zeppelin; The Beatles; The Allman Brothers; Jimi Hendrix–even Black Sabbath, Bonerama’s distinctive, inimitable, genuine, one-of-a-kind sound is unmatched, high-energy, fun, dynamic and bold.\n\nOpening the show at 6:00 p.m. is Funkiphino, known for their sharp, edgy mashups with more than a hint of funk. The band’s roots are unexpectedly classy with plenty of dirty grit to charm the most discerning listeners. Funkiphino pays homage to an array of musical genres guaranteed to satisfy the most discerning musical palate. By showcasing heavy horn laden music motifs from the past and today, they take inspiration from old school funk playgrounds, adolescent rock rebellion, and R&B daydreams.\n\nWhat: AvonLIVE!
