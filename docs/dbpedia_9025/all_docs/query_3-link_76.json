        "text": "Second Line is a traditional style of New Orleans music that originated in the late 19th century. It is a type of brass band music that is characterized by a strong, syncopated beat and a call-and-response style of singing. The music is often played at parades and other celebrations, and is often accompanied by a dance called the \"Second Line\" which involves people dancing in a line behind the band. The music is often seen as a symbol of the city's African-American culture and is a source of pride for many New Orleans residents."
