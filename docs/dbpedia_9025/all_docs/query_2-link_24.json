        "text": "One of the recurring themes within the New Orleans music community since Hurricane Katrina has been a focus on passing the torch on to the next generation of musicians.\n\nFrom the Roots of Music to the work the Tipitina’s Foundation has spearheaded to plotlines of HBO’s Treme, the image of an established musician handing an instrument to a child has become an indelible part of the musical landscape.\n\nBonerama’s Mark Mullins carried on this tradition during the band’s set on the Samsung Galaxy stage at Jazz Fest 2014 by bringing his oldest son Michael Mullins on stage to play with the band.\n\nMichael, who is 13 and has been playing trombone for three years, has a jump start on his dad.\n\n“I did do some parades at 12 or 13, but I never played anything big like Jazz Fest at that age,” Mark Mullins said.\n\nWhile he said he couldn’t be prouder of his son, Mark Mullins said he tries to keep the pressure to a minimum.\n\n“I’m dad first, and the trombone stuff is extra and totally for fun,” he said."
