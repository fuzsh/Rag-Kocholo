Formed in 2014 at the University at Buffalo, The Brass Machine provides a unique blend of hip hop, funk, and R&B, all in an infectious and energetic brass-y package. Having performed alongside national acts such as Earth, Wind, and Fire, Starship, The Soul Rebels, Rebirth Brass Band, Bonerama, John Papa Gros, CJ Chenier and more – The Brass Machine is hittin’ the streets HARD.\n\nLed by frontman “Kidd” Kyle Yagielski, the group has been named the best FUNK BAND in Western New York three years in a row by JazzBuffalo, and continues to maintain a robust performance schedule at festivals across the Northeast including Borderland, RailRider, Rochester Jazz Fest, Night Lights, and more! If you want to hear music that’s good for your souls and soles, come party with The Brass Machine!"
