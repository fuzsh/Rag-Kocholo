        "text": "The trombone has never really taken hold in rock ’n’ roll. It’s mostly been relegated to jazz and marching bands, while saxophones got all the rock glory. That is, until now. Bonerama, a hot band out of New Orleans, is intent on putting the overlooked horn front and center.\n\nBonerama, which plays the Boston Harbor Rock and Blues Cruise tonight, is not your typical brass band. Nor is it your typical rock band. Newcomers to their shows can be spotted easily: They’re the ones with their jaws hanging open in shock. The mighty thunder of three or more trombones blasting away on legendary Hendrix, Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath riffs is a sound that leaves quite a first impression.\n\nMark Mullins, one of Bonerama’s founders, understands why audiences are taken aback by their sound.\n\n“I think maybe people just haven’t seen or imagined trombones fronting a rock band,” Mullins said by phone from his home last week. “It’s not rocket science necessarily, but it obviously connects with people immediately because we’re playing music they’re familiar with or never thought would be played that way.”\n\nMullins and fellow trombonist Craig Klein formed the band back in 1998 on a touring break from Harry Connick Jr.’s band. They wanted a band that would move their beloved instrument out of the horn section ghetto and give it the respect it deserved.\n\n“Despite all the tradition in New Orleans, no one really talks about the trombone,” said Mullins. “Other instruments usually get all the talk. Coming up with the idea for the band, we were like, ‘No trumpet players! No saxophone players!’ ”\n\nAt one point or another, most of New Orleans’ best trombonists have played in the revolving door that is Bonerama. After fiddling with different lineups, the band is now usually three trombones, guitar, bass and drums. Onstage they tend to mix originals and New Orleans funk classics with their infamous interpretations of rock anthems such as Edgar Winter’s “Frankenstein” and Led Zeppelin’s “Moby Dick.”\n\nAfter becoming a regional favorite, Bonerama has now turned into an international touring act. Some fans have discovered them through their collaboration with YouTube sensation OK Go on the joint EP “You’re Not Alone,” which led to an appearance on David Letterman’s show. But most of their exposure comes at festivals, where they get sandwiched between standard guitar-bass-drum rock bands.\n\n“It’s really fun to stand up in front of somebody else’s crowd, do what we do and try to win some people over,” said Mullins. “It’s a pretty great experience to be able to hold a trombone at the front of the band, look out at the crowd and not see people running for the exits.”"
