        "text": "In New Orleans, it's cool to play the trombone.\n\nIn a place where a live jazz band can be heard anywhere in the city almost 24/7, people who play brass instruments aren't looked on as band geeks - musicians are stars.\n\nOr at least that's how Bonerama founding member and trombone player Craig Klein sees it.\n\n\"For me, my uncle played. For Mark (Mullins, another co-founder), it was his brother. It's all about seeing someone else do it that really starts the inspiration,\" Klein explained. \"On tour there are some people who don't even know what a trombone is, but that's why we do what we do to bring this to the world.\"\n\nHad it not been for Harry Connick Jr., however, that band would never have been formed. Meeting while playing in Connick's band, Mullins and Klein started Bonerama as a side project.\n\n\"We began to have a lot of extra time off as Harry got into the acting side of things,\" Klein said. \"It was something to do. No expectations or goals. At first we had 15 trombones on stage, but we soon realized that was too much.\"\n\nThen things started taking off and they were doing some touring of their own. The rub came when one of their concert dates conflicted with Connick's tour.\n\n\"It was such a hard decision after being with Harry for 16 years,\" Klein said. \"But when I came to him with the problem he said, ‘You should have done this a long time ago.' \"\n\nSet free to do their own thing, the Bonerama musicians were able to congeal their fusion of brass, funk and rock into a sound unlike that of any other band out there. After cutting down the trombone section from seven to four to three, the band also includes drums, guitar, bass and tuba.\n\nBut trombone is the forefront. In fact, Mullins often plays his trombone through a guitar amplifier that, according to Klein, sounds so much like a guitar most people can't tell the difference.\n\nBut what's in a name? Do people snicker when they hear the name Bonerama?\n\n\"Yeah there are some people who don't get it,\" Klein confessed. \"But the name came from the combination of bones, as trombones are known in the music world, and a band name of our friends called Twangorama. It's not about what you think it is.\"\n\nPlaying at three different shows this weekend in Sioux City, their music will be loud and proud.\n\n\"At our shows we always bring in a taste of New Orleans, Jimi Hendrix and The Meters to the stage,\" Klein said. \"But we always mix it up. The set is never the same twice.\"\n\nIn true jazz form, improvisation is always accepted on the Bonerama stage, yet, Klein said, the group does not want to be known as a jazz band.\n\n\"What we do is easier to reach. People can stand and dance to this,\" Klein said.\n\nPlaying a mix of originals and cover arrangements, the band does an awesome rendition of Led Zeppelin's \"When the Levee Breaks.\"\n\nAs someone who had 10 feet of water in his home after the horrors of Hurricane Katrina, Klein said he can relate to what people are going through with the flooding in Siouxland.\n\n\"I know Mother Nature can't be controlled, but it doesn't make it any less frustrating,\" Klein said. \"'When the Levee Breaks' touches a raw nerve within people who have gone through this.
