        "text": "The brassy funk of Bonerama may seem like an odd complement to OK Go's bouncy power-pop, but in the interests of Katrina relief for New Orleans musicians, they found a way to make it work. The two bands met when OK Go lead singer Damien Kulash played with the iconoclastic tromboners at one of Tipitina's Musicians Bringing Musicians Home benefit shows, and decided to take their partnership off the stage and into the studio. On the music website melodic.net, the band commented, \"Now the world can hear what we would sound like if we were the trombonic soul orchestra we've always dreamt of being.\"\n\nThe EP includes cover versions of David Bowie's \"Rock n'Roll Suicide\" and Bob Dylan's \"I Shall Be Released,\" with guest vocals from Al 'Carnival Time' Johnson. 100% of the proceeds, including, apparently, iTunes' share, will be split between Sweet Home New Orleans and a fund dedicated to building Carnival Time a home in the Habitat for Humanity Musicians' Village. The digital-only 5-song EP You're Not Alone hits cyberspace on Mardi Gras Day as an iTunes exclusive. But the real question on fans' minds, of course, is can you play a trombone on a treadmill?"
