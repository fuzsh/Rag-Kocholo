        "text": "KALAMAZOO -- Four trombones blaring in your face from a club stage -- that's a different kind of power.\n\nBonerama puts that power behind rock, funk and a bit of its hometown New Orleans brass-band sound.\n\n\"It can be a very powerful instrument, especially combined with other trombones,\" Mark Mullins, who co-founded the band with Craig Klein, said from New Orleans. As anyone who's faced a marching band up close knows, the T-bones section \"is a pretty ballsy section. It's a pretty strong, meaty, sound.\"Mullins played in his high school band, and Klein played in traditional brass bands. The two ended up in Harry Connick Jr.'s band in the '90s. But they got itchy to do their own thing.\n\nTipitina's club in the French Quarter put Mullins in charge of Wednesday night music in 1998, so he and Klein began staging mass trombone jams. They would get 15 onstage, Klein said on boneramamusic.com: \"It sounded like a freight train; a big wall of sound coming right at you.\"\n\nAt first they were just having fun, but it grew, Mullins said. \"We got a pretty unique and special reaction.\"\n\nThe band evolved with \"one foot in New Orleans, but with room to experiment with other stuff, too,\" Mullins said. Party-friendly second line jazz and New Orleans brass band funk could be followed by a blaring version of Edgar Winter's \"Frankenstein\" or other hard rock covers of Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath or Jimi Hendrix tunes.\n\n\"Those songs can transfer to this instrument in a pretty cool way,\" Mullins said. The horns sometimes use guitar-effects pedals and a guitar amp to get as close to heavy metal as a trombone can.\n\nBut then they drop serious jazz with some Thelonious Monk, or some Dirty Dozen-style funk fueled by their sousaphone player Matt Perrine. It's all a part of the party, Mullins said.\n\n\"We want to be serious about our craft, but also to have a good time.\"\n\nBonerama was successful enough by 2006 for Mullins and Klein to quit Connick's band. They were the house band for that year's Comic Relief telethon and teamed with OK Go!'s Damian Kulash for a Katrina relief effort (fitting since in the flood 11 feet of water ruined Klein's home). They appeared with Kulash on \"Late Night with David Lettermen\" in 2008.\n\nThey have three live albums, and are working on their first studio recording. It's taken them a while to do a nonlive album because, Mullins wondered: \"Does anybody buy records anymore? All theses record stores have been closing like crazy. ... People are getting their music in so many different ways.\"\n\nThey just like to do it live, and get sweaty. The heat and humidity, Mullins said, \"feeds us. You get used to it down here. After the first eight bars, your shirt is just soaking wet like it just came out of the washing machine.\""
