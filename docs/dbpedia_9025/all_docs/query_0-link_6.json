        "text": "Internationally Acclaimed Funky Brass & Fusion Band BONERAMA has taken the best elements of Rock, Soul, Fusion, Pop, Jazz, Funk, Brass, Gospel & Blues to forge its unique sound. Once heard, it leaves an indelible imprint upon the listener that can never be forgotten! A Bonerama concert is life-changing and will permanently alter how one views popular music. They are one of the funkiest & most unique bands to ever come out of New Orleans! Their album, 'Bonerama Plays Zeppelin' (2019), was one of the best-selling albums at New Orleans Jazz Fest. \"The band is in a class of its own. Its jazzified, funkified, rhythmic and rockin' brass band music unequalled and unparalleled,\" raves ALL ABOUT JAZZ. \"A brass band force of nature,\" states NPR MUSIC. Band includes Mark Mullins (Trombone/Lead Vocals), CHRIS BUTCHER (Trombone), GREG HICKS (Trombone/Vocals), BERT COTTON (Lead Guitar), MATT PERRINE (Electric Bass) & ERIC BOLIVAR (Drums). For 27+ years they continue to deliver thrilling live shows!"
