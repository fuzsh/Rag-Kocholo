Bonerama, the brass funk band whose new album is a tribute to the music of Led Zeppelin, is getting ready to celebrate its release with New Orleans.

A few songs from Basin Street Records release Bonerama Plays Zeppelin follow the Zeppelin style but do not copy the originals exactly, with the horns taking the guitar parts. The songs are transformed into New Orleans funk originals and standouts that put just the right amount of newness into the old school rock ‘n’ roll songs. With everything from tuba solos to Mardi Gras Indian percussion, Bonerama encompasses a sound never heard before. As Brett Milano put it in the OffBeat review of the album, “The world is overcrowded with reverent tributes to tired classic-rock material, but Bonerama’s all–Led Zeppelin album isn’t one of those. It’s full of audacious arrangements that turn the classic tunes every which way, yet remain entirely true to the Zeppelin spirit.”

Bonerama was formed in 1998 by trombone players Mark Mullins and Craig Klein. Since then, the band has grown into a New Orleans essential brass band. From changing the sound of what we know as trombone music, Bonerama has had a 20-year career with faithful followers and is ready to do something new.
