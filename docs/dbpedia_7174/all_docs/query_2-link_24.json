        "text": "Govt. Sanskrit College was founded by His Highness Sri. Sri Rama Varma Maharaja of Kochi, who was a profound scholar of Sankrit. The vision of the institution is expressed as “Nectar is attained through knowledge”. It was with the specific goal of imparting instruction in various Sastras of Sanskrit that the courses were started. At the beginning of the 20th century, modern system of education was introduced by the British was gaining wider acceptance. On the other hand, the traditional education system was getting weaker and weaker. This caused considerable decrease in the number of students seeking ‘Sastric’ studies. Moreover, there was no well organized institution to impart traditional Sanskrit education. His Highness Sri. Sri Rama Varma Maharaja of Kochi felt the necessity of an institution to give instruction in the advanced Sastras of Sanskrit and as a result of that, he founded the Sanskrit College, the former form of the present Government Sanskrit College, Thripunithura."
