        "text": "Welcome To\n\nRamnarain Ruia Autonomous College (Senior College)\n\nThe Ramnarain Ruia College was recently conferred with an Autonomous status in the month of July 2017 by the University of Mumbai and University Grants Commission. Ramnarain Ruia College is one of the Best Colleges in Mumbai, established in June 1937 by the Shikshana Prasaraka Mandali, Pune. It was the first educational institution in Mumbai run by a private management educational body. The college was declared open formally by H.E. Sir Roger Lumley, the then Governor of Bombay, on 3rd December 1937. A large amount of the credit of the establishment of this institution goes to Mataji Suvratadevi Ruia and her illustrious son, Seth Ramnivas Ramnarain Ruia, who extended a handsome donation of Rs.2,00,000 from the Ramnarain Harnandrai Charitable Trust.\n\nRead More\n\nWe offer excellent infrastructural facilities with competent and dedicated faculty which strives for the overall development of the students.
