        "text": "Brief History of The Department of Sanskrit\n\nDepartment of Sanskrit has been established in 1884 under the Calcutta University. Students are not only from the local area (Kolkata) but also from other neighbouring areas like Murshidabad, North Bengal, Sundarban etc. This Department also has been caring for the weaker and marginalised students of the society. Presently this Department has 30 students. To facilitate proper academic support there are 2 whole time teachers with 2 SACT faculty along with 2 non-teaching members as supporting staff."
