        "text": "Dictionary of Proper Names\n\nSelected from Glossary and Index of Proper Names in Sri Aurobindoâs Works (1989/1996)\n\nB\n\nBaal the most important god in the pantheon Canaanites; the Old Testament speaks frequently of the Baal of a given place or refers to Baalim in the plural.\n\nBabel the Tower of Babel; ancient multi-ethnic Babylonian city & tower âwith its top in the heavensâ to reunite humanity with its Creator. The god of the Genesis condemned this city & tower by making diversity of languages a curse â which why each of the creedal religion it created imposes its own tribal tongue as the only means of communing with the Creator of mankind. Sri Aurobindo: âIn reality, this diversity has been rather a blessing than a curse laid on mankind, a gift rather than a disability. For its disadvantages tend more & more to be minimised by the growth of civilisation & increasing intercourse. Diversity of languages serves two important ends of the human spirit: it brings those who speak it into a certain large unity of growing thought, formed temperament, ripening spirit; & most powerful of all, it is not a barren principle of division but a means of a fruitful & helpful differentiation. [CWSA Vol. 25]\n\nBacchae tragedy by the Greek poet Euripides in 5th cent BC, on the Pentheus story.\n\nBacchus Roman god of wine, identified with Dionysus (q.v.). He was also a god of vegetation & fertility, & the protector of vines. [Cf.

From 5th millennium BC, it was a nodal point of desert travel & trade, & later the capital of the Abbasside Caliphate. Abu Jaâfar Abdallah ibn Muhammad al-Mansur (714â75 AD), the second Abbasid Caliph is generally regarded as the real founder of the Abbasid Caliphate. Al-Mansur is also known for founding the âround cityâ of Madinat al-Salam which was to become the core of imperial Baghdad. Al-Mansur was proclaimed Caliph on his way to Mecca in the year 753 & installed the next year. Under the Abbassides Baghdadâs commercial position became unrivalled & became, under Haroun Al Rashid, the greatest city of Islam. By 1200 Chenghiz Khanâs conquests began to shake the Abbasside Empire; upon conquering Baghdad Chenghiz put up a tower of one lakh skulls there. In 1258 Chenghizâs grandson Hulagu Khan overthrew the Abbasside Caliphate. By 1638, when it became part of the Ottoman Empire its population was a mere 14,000. In 1920 it became the capital of the newly constituted kingdom of Iraq.\n\nBÄgdÄ« mid-6th century it was one of the five divisions of Gauá¸a (see Bengal). Later its natives, who became mainly fishermen, palanquin-bearers, & labourers in central & western Bengal & Bihar, became known as BÄgdÄ«s.\n\nBahadur Shah (1) Bahadur Shah I, 7th Moghul Emperor (1707-12). (2) Bahadur Shah (1775-1862), 19th & last Moghul emperor (1837-1857): a philosopher-poet âconvictedâ by the blood-thirsty Octopus on the blatantly false charge of being the kingpin of 1857-58 Mutiny against its âlegalâ possession of the subcontinent, & hanged after being made to witness the public massacre of all his possible successors.\n\nBahaâism founded in 1862 by âBahÄâ-UllÄhâ (born MÄ«rzÄ Hosaynâ-AlÄ« NÅ«rÄ«, 1817-92), sprang from Persiaâs Shiâite Shaikhism & BÄbism. The former, who believed that a perfect Shiâite would declare himself the Twelfth Imam in 1844 AD, accepted Sayyedâ-AlÄ«-Mohammad Å Ä«rÄzÄ« when he proclaimed himself the BÄb-ed-Din (Gate of Faith) of the Twelfth Imam. BÄbis were persecuted by orthodox Shiâites supported by the Shah of Iran who executed the BÄb in 1850 & imprisoned their leaders among whom was BahÄ UllÄh. He was exiled to Iraq, then to Istanbul & Edirne in Turkey. At Edirne, in 1863, he declared himself the spiritual âreturnâ of the BÄb. In 1868 he was imprisoned in AkkÄ in Palestine but lead his Iranian followers by sending them his epistles & tablets. In 1873, he set down al-KetÄb-al-aqdas (Most Holy Book) in which among other things he emphasised the education of children of both sexes. In spite of continued persecution by the Iranian Govt. & Shiâite Ulemas, Bahaâism spread not only among Iranian Shiâites but also among Zoroastrians & Jews. By 1892 it had spread to Iraq, Turkey, Ottoman Syria, Egypt, Sudan, the Caucasus, Turkish Central Asia, India, & Burma. In the Arya, August 1915, Sri Aurobindo cited Bahaâism as one of the forms of Asian spiritual energy (with Buddhism, Vedantism, & other Oriental forms) which, along with European idealism, mysticism, & religionism, was attempting to usher a period of light & efflorescence in humanityâs evolution [SABCL Vol.16; CWSA 13:142]. In an informal talk in April 1924, he said, BahÄ UllÄh used to see a Light descend on him when he was in meditation; it is with that force that he created Bahaâism; he had a remarkable power of telepathy & the power of the word which is regarded as a sign of a prophet; some of his prophecies came true. Abdul BahÄ, his eldest son whom he had named his successor, also used to see some Light in meditation & used it to influence his disciples. He accepted certain mental concepts like toleration, universal brotherhood, equality of man & woman, etc., & was open even to Buddhism. If Mahomedans, Sri Aurobindo added, get a religion of that sort it is much better than what they are having now [A.B. Purani, Evening Talksâ¦, 2007:459-61].\n\nThe website of Bahaâism (2016) says that God sent a series of his divine Manifestationsâ¦ including Abraham, Krishna, Zoroaster, Moses, Buddha, Jesus, & Muhammad. BahÄ UllÄh says: âThe religions of the world come from the same Source & are in essence successive chapters of one religion from God.â\n\nBÄhuka alias of King Nala while in disguise as a trainer of horses & charioteer at the court of á¹tupará¹a, the king of Ayodhya.\n\nBaidyanath The BoidyonÄtha dhÄma at Deoghar claims to be ParalyÄm VaidyanÄtham, fifth of the twelve in DwÄdasha Jyotirlingam Stotram. However, the VaidyanÄtha at Parali, near Pune, has been traditionally worshipped as the original. The legend: In one of his anusthÄnas in his worship of Shiva, RÄvaá¹a built, consecrated & worshipped a Shivalinga. But Shiva did not appear until after he offered his ten heads one after the other; RÄvaá¹a then obtained a boon with which he hoped to destroy all his enemies. Since Shiva attended to RÄvanaâs injuries as would a Vaidya, that Shivalinga & temple & location are known as VaidyanÄtha.\n\nBaital Pachisi Betal-PanchvimÅati (1847) by ÄªÅvara Chandra VidyÄsÄgara, based on Shiva Das Bhattâs Vaitala-Pancha-vimsaka, was the first prose work of Bengali literature. It is a set of 25 tales of King VikramÄditya: each consists of a conundrum question by a Vaital (spirit haunting a dead body) & VikramÄdityaâs solution.\n\nBÄji Prabhou one of the longer poems by Sri Aurobindo, based on the historical incident of the heroic self-sacrifice of a fearless general of Shivaji. The obvious reason he wrote it along with âThe Mother to her Sonâ & Prince of Edur, was to implant the spirit of fearlessness in those who loved their motherland.\n\nBÄji Rao BÄji Rao I (18Aug1700â28Apr1740) was eldest son & successor of BÄlÄji Vishwanath Bhat. BÄlÄji, one of eight ministers of Chhatrapati Shahu (grandson of Shivaji), became the first Peshwa (Prime Minister) in 1713. That Aurangzeb, after Shivajiâs death, personally descended into the Deccan, proved that the Mahrattas were his only rivals. Taking advantage of the Mogul Empireâs decline after Aurangzebâs death in 1707, BÄlÄji entered into treaties with his weak successor Md. Shah, taking back not only the territories of Shivaji that Aurangzeb had usurped but also KhÄndesh, & the right to levy chauth (a quarter of the annual revenue of an area as tribute) on the Moghul provinces of GondwÄnÄ, Berar, & parts of Hyderabad & Karnataka. He also extracted the right to levy chauth in Gujarat from its Mogul governor, which Shahu awarded to his SenÄpati, Khanderao DabhÄde. Upon BÄlÄjiâs death in 1720, Shahu appointed BÄji Rao the next Peshwa & DabhÄdeâs son Triambakrao, SenÄpati. BÄji Rao proposed the creation of an all-India Hindu empire replacing the Moghul. His policy: âStrike at the root, & the branches will fall of themselvesâ was opposed not only by senior ministers who resented at being superseded, but also Mahratta chieftains such as Ranoji Shinde, Malharrao Holkar, UdÄjirao PawÄr, Tukojirao PawÄr & JivÄjirao PawÄr who were collecting chauth from several areas in MÄlwÄ & later carved out their own kingdoms of Gwalior, Indore, DhÄr & the two Dewas States. In 1723, BÄji Rao invaded MÄlwÄ & Shahu gave him the right to collect chauth from MÄlwÄ. When Triambakrao rebuffed BÄjiraoâs proposal to share each otherâs levy, BÄji Rao appointed an agent of his own for collecting chauth in Gujarat where three Mahratta commanders: KanthÄji & Kadam Bande for Shahu, & Triambakraoâs Deputy PilÄji GaikwÄd for himself & Triambakrao, were already active. While BÄjirao went on to raise the Mahratta power to an all-India level with outposts like Indore & Gwalior in the north, Nagpur in the centre & Miraj & Ramdurg in the south, Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah I, Delhiâs viceroy of Deccan, sent an army to Ahmedabad in 1730 to replace the Mogul governor of Gujarat there by his own. Seeing PilÄji & KanthÄji going over to the Nizamâs fold, BÄjirao sent a column under ChimnÄji. Since the Governor of Gujarat, ceded to ChimnÄji, the right to collect chauth & sardeshmukhi from Gujarat, he was replaced by Abhay Singh, who also recognized BÄjiraoâs right to collect taxes. Incensed at this, Triambakrao who felt BÄjirao had usurped his familyâs rights formed an alliance against BÄjirao with Bangash, the Nizam, ShambhÄji II of Kolhapur (who had become a rival claimant to the title of Chhatrapati), PilÄji, KanthÄji, & Bande. Hearing of this, BÄjirao set out for Gujarat at the head of a formidable army & in the battle at Dabhoi (q.v.) in 1731, Triambakrao & PilÄjiâs son were killed & PilÄji badly injured. The Nizam signed a treaty whereby he would never stray north of Hyderabad &, defeated again by BÄjirao at Rohe-Rameshwar in December 1732, promised not to interfere with Maratha expeditions. Shahu & BÄjirao resolved the dispute with ShambhÄji II by signing the Treaty of Warna, which demarcated the territories of the Chhatrapati & Kolhapur. They avoided a rivalry with the powerful DabhÄde clan by appointing Triambakraoâs son Yashwantrao SenÄpati with the right to continue collecting chauth from Gujarat on the condition that he would deposit half the collections in the Chhatrapatiâs treasury. PilÄji, still bent on carving out a kingdom of his own, wheedled the right out of the naÃ¯ve boy & created lifelong enmity between the GaikwÄd & the Peshwa. Meanwhile, ShambhÄji II had claimed the title of the Maratha Chhatrapati. The Nizam offered to act as an arbitrator. BÄjirao convinced Shahu not to accept the Nizamâs arbitration offer, & instead launch an assault against him. In August 1727, BÄjirao raided & plundered several of Nizamâs territories, such as Jalna, Burhanpur & KhÄndesh. The Nizam invaded Pune, where he installed ShambhÄji II as the Chhatrapati, leaving behind a contingent of his army headed by Fazal Beg. On 28 February 1728, the armies of BÄjirao & Nizam faced each other at the Battle of Palkhed. The Nizam was defeated, & forced to make peace. On 6 March, he signed the Treaty of MÅ«ngi Shevgaon, recognizing Shahu as the Chhatrapati as well as the Maratha right to collect taxes in Deccan. BÄjirao moved his base of operations to Pune in 1728 & in the process laid the foundation for turning it into a large city. BÄjirao also started construction of ShaniwÄr WÄdÄ on the right bank of the Mutha River. The construction was completed in 1730, ushering in the era of Peshwa control of the city. [Cf. Tilak purchasing GayakawÄdÄ which was thence known as Sardar-griha]\n\nMeanwhile, after death of Triambakrao, the Mughal Emperor recalled Bangash from MÄlwÄ & re-appointed Jai Singh II as its governor. On 4 March 1736, BÄjirao & Jai Singh came to an agreement at Kishangadh & on Jai Singhâs advice the Emperor appointed BÄjirao Deputy Governor of the province. Jai Singh is also believed to have secretly informed BÄjirao that it was a good time to subdue the weakening Mughal emperor. BÄjirao had already built the Mahratta Confederacy with the Scindhia, Holkar, Bhonsle, & the GaikwÄd. He also allied himself with the Rajput ruler of Amber & the BundelÄs. On 12 November 1736, he started a march to the Mughal capital Delhi from Pune. On hearing about the advancing Maratha army, the Emperor asked SÄdat Khan to march from Agra & check the Maratha advance. Malharrao Holkar & PilÄji JÄdhav crossed Yamuna & plundered the Mughal territories in the Ganga-Yamuna Doab. SÄdat Khan led a force of 150,000 against them, & defeated them. He then retired to Mathura, thinking that the Marathas had retreated. However, BÄjirao advanced to Delhi & encamped at Talkotara. The Mughal emperor dispatched a force led by Mir Hasan Khan Koka to check his advance which the Marathas defeated on 28 March 1737.\n\nThe Portuguese had captured several territories on the west coast of India, violating an agreement to give the Marathas a site on Salsette Island (c.241 sq. miles), north of Bombay, for building a factory, & had been practising religious intolerance against the Hindus in their territory. BÄjirao dispatched an army under his brother ChimnÄji against them. ChimnÄji captured the Thana fort & almost all of Bassein, & gained control of Salsette after a prolonged siege. However, BÄjirao was forced to turn his attention away from the Portuguese due to the invasion of Nadir Shah (q.v.) in the north. He died on 28 April 1740, at the age of 39 en route to Delhi at Khargaon, near Indore. He was cremated on 28 April 1740, at Raver-Kheda on the river Narmada. After him Nana Fadnavis managed to hold the Confederacy together in spite of the internecine squabbling among them ignited by the British. âWith his death,â writes Grant Duff, âdeparted all the wisdom & moderation of the Mahratta Confederacy.â Ignoring Shivajiâs & Nanaâs warnings never to âsign even an innocuous treaty with the English, for they have the cruel cunning to grab the whole at the first opportunityâ, GaikwÄd, Bhonsle, BÄjirao II, Sindhia, & Holkar, all signed suicidal bi-lateral treaties with the Octopus which, by 1818 reduced them to pitiable feudatories, & laying the seed of slavery under Pax Britannica.\n\nSri Aurobindo: Swaraj has been sometimes interpreted as a return to the old conditions of self-sufficient village life leaving the imperial authority to itself, to tax and pass laws as it pleased â ignored because it is too strong to be destroyed. Even those who see the futility of ignoring Government which seeks to destroy every centre of strength, however minute, except itself, sometimes insist on the village as the secret of our life and ask us to give up our ambitious strivings after national Swaraj and realise it first in the village. Such counsel is dangerous, even if it were possible to follow it. Nothing should be allowed to distract us from the mighty ideal of Swaraj, National and Pan-Indian. This is no alien or exotic ideal, it is merely the conscious attempt to fulfil the great centripetal tendency which has pervaded the grandiose millenniums of her history, to complete the work which Srikrishna began, which Chandragupta and Asoka and the Gupta Kings continued, which Akbar almost brought to realisation, for which Shivaji was born and BÄjirao fought and planned.â Which work his son BÄlÄji BÄjirao attempted to realise (see PÄá¹Ä«pat), & which work Tilak & Sri Aurobindo too attempted to complete; but as in all such previous attempts, in their case too, the betrayal was worse from within that from without.

Pleased, Vishnu gave him the kingdom of PÄtÄla.\n\nBalkan(s)/ ~ Confederacy/ ~ Wars The Balkan Peninsula comprised all of Albania, continental Greece, Bulgaria, European Turkey, most of Yugoslavia, & south-eastern Rumania. These six countries, successors to the Ottoman Empire, were called the Balkan States or the Balkans. The Balkan Confederacy or Balkan League (comprising Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, & Montenegro â a republic South-West of Yugoslavia) was originally formed at the instigation of Bulgaria & Serbia with the aid of Russian diplomacy to limit increasing Austrian power in the Balkans. During 1912, however, the alliance became more anti-Turkish than anti-Austrian. First Balkan War began with Montenegroâs declaration of war against the Turks on 8 October 1912 (see Adrianople above, & Chatalja below) & the entry of its three allies of the Balkan Confederacy (q.v.) into the war ten days later. The Balkan States were victorious, & a treaty was signed in London on 30 May 1913. The League was victorious, but it disintegrated when its members quarrelled over the division of their territorial spoils. This dispute resulted in the Second Balkan War, against Bulgaria, in 1913.\n\nBalkh ancient Bactra, capital of Bactria.

His work Harsha-charita, written about AD 620, is a contemporary account of the deeds of Harsha during the earlier years of his reign. His other work the KÄdambari is a famous classic of Sanskrit literature [S. Bhattacharya, p.112] âBÄá¹aâs Harsha-charita provides the best account of the killing of the Åaka king tyrannising the people of western MÄlwÄ & KÄá¹­hiÄwÄd by the Gupta emperor Chandra Gupta II who, on many coins, receives the epithet VikramÄditya. In certain records of the 12th century, he is represented as the lord of Ujjain as well as PÄtaliputra in Magadha, the capital of the Gupta Empire. The cool courage he showed in fighting the Åakas & killing their chieftain in the enemyâs own city entitles him to the epithets SÄhasÄá¹ ka & ÅakÄri. These facts have led scholars to identify him with the VikramÄditya ÅakÄri of legend, whose court is said to have been adorned by nine gems including KÄlidÄsa & VarÄhmihira. .... The province of Sindh figures in the narrative of BÄá¹a as one of the territories overrun by PrabhÄkarvardhana & his more famous son Harsha. â¦. A list of the important religious sects that flourished at the close of the Gupta age is given in BÄá¹aâs Harsha-charita. It mentions the Jains, both Digambaras (sky-clad, that is naked) & ÅvetÄmbaras (white-robed), Vaishnavas, both BhÄgavatas & PancharÄtras â perhaps the worshippers of VÄsudeva & NÄrÄyaá¹a respectively, Saugatas or Buddhists, Mashkarins, possibly identical with the Äjivikas, & adherents of various schools of philosophy including the SÄá¹ khya, the LokÄyatika, the VaiÅeshika, the VedÄnta & the NyÄya. ....

In 1882 he incorporated it in his novel Ananda Math. In 1905, it shot into popularity in the agitation against Bengalâs partition; & later Indiaâs national hymn.\n\nS. Bhattacharya: M.M. HaraprasÄd ShÄstri observed: âWhatever Bankim did had led to one goal. That goal is the worship of the motherland â to address the motherland as the mother â to love the motherland â to adore her. Nobody else in India has done this â it is his work. So he deserves our respect, he deserves our salutation, he is our ÄchÄrya, he our rishi, he is the maker of our mantram & that mantram is Vande Mataram.â\n\nA.B. Purani: Disciple: Some people object to Vande Mataram as a national songâ¦ because it speaks of the Hindu goddess Durga & that is offensive to the Muslims. Sri Aurobindo: But it is not a religious song! It is a national song & the Durga spoken of is India as the Mother.\n\nWhy shouldnât Muslims accept it? It is an image used in poetry. If in the conception of Indian nationality the Hindu viewpoint cannot find a place then the Hindus may as well be asked to give up their culture; to comes to this that we all become Mohammedans. They donât say it now they will say it later on, because they have begun to object to the worship of Hindu Gods in national institutions. Why shouldnât the Hindu worship his Gods?

In some poems he contrasted the Chinese & the Japanese who were free nations with India which was asleep. His brilliant satire on the Anglo-Indian agitation against the Ilbert Bill (1883) & on a Bengali bhadraloka presenting the ladies of his family to the Prince of Wales, strove to inspire self-respect among Bengalis. B.C. Pal said: âThe intense patriotic passion that breathed through his poems captured our youthful minds in a way which no other Bengalee poems had done. The new generation of English-educated Bengalees had already commenced to advance themselves to positions of trust & responsibility in the new Administration. In the learned professions of law & medicine also, they were gradually asserting themselves against the British members. A new spirit of independence & self-assertion was increasingly manifesting itself in the conduct & conversations of the English-educated Bengalee. All these had already commenced to provoke a racial conflict in the country. Hem Chandra was, in a special sense, the poet of this new conflict & of the racial self-respect & sensitive patriotism, born of it.â [Based on Buckland; S.P.

Jatindra was born at Channa village in Burdwan district. His father, KÄli Charan Banerjee (q.v.), worked as a government official at Bangaon of Jessore district (now North 24-Parganas) of undivided Bengal. From his village school, Jatin went on to the Burdwan Raj College (affiliated to Calcutta Univ.). Having passed its First Year Arts with high marks, he was admitted to B.A. class in the college. After obtaining his degree he joined the KÄyastha PÄthashÄla in Allahabad where, encouraged by RÄmÄnanda Chatterjee, he devoured books on European & American revolutions. â In 1899, he went to Baroda to meet Sri Aurobindo since the British Army refused to admit Bengalis. He got admitted, through Sri Aurobindoâs friend Madhavrao JÄdhav to the 4th Baroda Infantry & was soon recruited to the GaikwÄdâs Bodyguard, where Madhavrao was an adjutant. After two years of training Sri Aurobindo sent him to Bengal âto establish secretly or, as far as visible action could be taken, under various pretexts & covers, revolutionary propaganda & recruiting throughout Bengalâ. [D.K. Roy, Aurobindo Prasanga, published 1923; translated by Sanat Kumar Bannerji under his series âGlimpses of Sri Aurobindoâ, Mother India, Dec., 1959; & CWSA Vol. 36:49]\n\nAbinash: Jatindranath came to our village, Arballia as a guest of Surendranath Sen, the famous orator, headmaster of Arballia School [&] an eminent disciple of the renowned Ashwinikumar Duttâ¦. From the house on 108C, Upper Circular Road, Jatin-babu, Barin & I began the work of collecting boys for the secret society. Jatin-babu was older than we were; in appearance he was tall, well-built & handsome. He took up work among the pleaders, barristers & rich menâ¦. Opposite our house was a big vacant plot; here the first akhÄra was started for teaching lÄthi & gadkÄ [short lÄthi], horse-riding, cycling, etcâ¦. After the three of us worked together for six months, there was a clash between him & us â personal clash, not a difference of opinionâ¦. Jatin-babu moved from the house on Circular Road to one on Sitaram Ghosh Streetâ¦. In the early part of 1903, Aurobindo-babuâ¦came as planned. He put up at Jatin-babuâs residenceâ¦. When [Barin & I] arrived we saw Aurobindo-babu & Jatin-babu sitting on a mat spread on the floor, talking & laughingâ¦. We stayed together for a few days after that. Then one day Jatin-babu put on the saffron robe of a sannyasi & went away.â [âSri Aurobindoâ, Mother India, July 2012]\n\nPurani: After leaving Barin & others, Jatin concentrated on the worship of the goddess Bishalakshmi (Durga) which he had begun in his college days. He began to feel the need for a guru & after his parents died he became a wandering monk. At KÄshi a monk assured him that he would find his destined guru at Nainital. There he managed to find Soham Swami, who immediately accepted him as a disciple & admitted him to his ashram. Soham Swami was a disciple of Tibbeti-baba, a legendary yogi. After some time Soham Swami asked Jatin to stay in his ashram at Haridwar & concentrate on his sÄdhanÄ. Later, pleased with Jatinâs spiritual progress, Soham Swami renamed him Srimat NirÄlamba Swami. After some years Jatin obtained his guruâs permission to establish an ashram at his own village & returned there. Significant among his teachings were the following axioms: âWake up & realise Self-Consciousness.â â âKnow yourself. If you do not know yourself, then how can you know your country?â â âIf you want to get rid of the sufferings of your country, then you have to become strong. To make yourself strong you have to first acquire Self-Knowledge. Self-strength makes human beings to cross difficult deserts & mountains. Nothing is impossible for a race possessing Self-strength.â One day, not long after Sri Aurobindoâs presence in Pondicherry became common knowledge, NirÄlamba Swami suddenly turned up for a visit. [Life of Sri Aurobindo]\n\nBanerji, Shyamakanta his stunning physical strength & extraordinary calm, courage, & self-confidence created the legend of wild & ferocious animals crouching at his feet, awed by the current of his dynamic vitality. He became a sannyasi, took the name Soham Swami, & dwelt in the Himalayas near Nainital. He composed & published Soham Gita.\n\nBanerji, Surendranath (1848-1925) Sir S.N. Bannerjea educated at Doreton College, Calcutta: B.A. 1868: ICS entrance exam (1869) & went up to Univ. College, London: joined ICS in 1871 as Asst. Magistrate, Sylhet; rejected from the Service 1874: Prof. English Literature in Metropolitan Institution & founder Indian Association 1876: joined Free Church Institution & Duff College 1881: founded Ripon College 1882: proprietor & editor the weekly Bengalee 1878-25: Member, Bengal Legislative Council 1893-1901: represented Calcutta Corporation in Bengal Legislative Council 1893: President, INC Poona 1895 & Ahmedabad 1902: Fellow, Calcutta University 1904: Member, Viceroyâs Imperial Legislative Council 1913: knighted 1921. [CEB]\n\nAfter dismissal from ICS on account of what was considered an irregular manner of trying a case, Surendranath tried to be enrolled as a barrister in England but was refused as he was dismissed from ICS. On his return to India in 1875, he became a professor at the Metropolitan Institution (now VidyÄsÄgara College); the Ripon College he founded & became its principal was renamed Surendranath College. He played a prominent part in founding the Indian Association (q.v.) in 1876, & also led the opposition to the Vernacular Press Act of 1878; under the auspices of his Indian Association, the Indian National Conference first met in Calcutta from 28 to 30 December; Surendranath took a prominent part in supporting the Ilbert Bill. After the founding of the Indian National Congress he helped merge All-India National Conference into it. [SB]\n\nConvinced by his study of the national movements in Europe that INC must copy the stirring activity recorded in the glorious annals of English constitutional history & take up constitutional agitation as that alone will secure for us those rights & privileges which in less favoured countries are obtained by sterner means, he declared: We rely on the liberty-loving instincts of the greatest representative assembly in the world, the palladium of English Liberty, the sanctuary of the free & brave, the British House of Commons. In 1887, adopting Bannerjeaâs idea of setting up a committee of English âfriendsâ to lobby in England, the INC set up a group under ex-Civilians Hume, Wedderburn, Cotton, & Naoroji on an annual budget of Rs.45,000. But within a decade this ineffective & expensive committee had to be dropped. This blind faith in the English model was not perturbed even when Dufferin publicly ridiculed it on 30 November 1888 thus: Some intelligent, loyal, patriotic & well-meaning men are desirous of takingâ¦ a big jump into the unknownâ¦ by the application to India of democratic methods of government, & the adoption of parliamentary system, which England herself had only reached by slow degrees & through the discipline of many centuries of preparationâ¦ Well, gentlemen, I am afraid that the people of England will not readily be brought to the acceptance of this programme. âThere is no doubt,â writes SitÄramayyÄ, âthat the progress of the Congress from 1885 to 1905 was an even march based on a firm faith in constitutional agitation in the unfailing regard for justice attributed to the English. [SA; APK; PS]\n\nWhen Lord Curzon decided to carry out the partition of Bengal [first announced in 1903, carried out in October 1905], Aurobindo-babu wrote: âA golden opportunity has come. Lay special stress on the Anti-Partition movement. Many workers will come from this movement.â He sent us a little pamphlet he had written entitled No Compromise. No press would print it. With no other course open, we bought types, sticks, lead, case, etc. And got the matter composed at our house by a young Marathi man named P.B. Kulkarni. Needless to say this Kulkarni used to stay with us. One night we got a press to print about a thousand copies of the pamphlet. It was distributed among all the newspaper editors & among the respectable educated classes. Barin & I took a copy to the venerable Surendranath Banerjee. At first he asked us to leave the pamphlet & go, but as we stood there obstinately, he took it up to glance at it â & could not put it down. He read the entire thing with great concentration, utterly stunned. He asked who the author was. âNo Indian, why, not even a Bengali, could write such English, & present the facts so cogentlyâ, but when he was told that Aurobindo-babu was the author, he said: âYes, he is the only person who could write in this way.â [ACB]\n\nSurendranath strongly opposed the Partition of Bengal effected in 1905 & led such a strong & popular agitation against it that he came to be recognised as the undisputed leader of Bengal, indeed âas the uncrowned kingâ of Bengal, for this partition was strongly resented by the people of Bengal, especially the Hindus, & they resorted to Swadeshi or use of indigenous manufactures & boycott of British goods. The Partition was modified in 1911 & was a great triumph for Surendranath. [SB]\n\nA comment of Sri Aurobindo in 1926: âSome people have a knack of using high-sounding words; once I listened to Surendra Nath for half-an-hour & I found no thought, it was all words. But he carried the audience, because what people require is some kind of vital emotion â they do not require thought. They get tired of listening of thoughts. [ABP]\n\nOpposition had already begun to grow amongst a section of Indians who thought that the constitutional agitation INC had so long been carrying on had proved a failure... [That section] known as the Extremists, was not afraid of resorting to violent methods, even if this led to a revolution. The attempt that the British Govt. made to suppress by force the anti-Partition agitation led by Surendranath, had driven discontent underground & terrorism raised its head in Bengal under the leadership of Aravinda Ghose. But Surendranath who had been reared upon the English literature of the 18th centuryâ¦would have nothing to do with revolution or revolutionary methods & could not think of a separation between India & England. [SB]\n\nOn 5 January 1939, Sri Aurobindo said, âMy answer to Surendranath when he invited our party to unite with his group in order to jointly fight the dominant right wing of the Moderates at the U.P. Convention (in 1909), was âNoâ. For it would have necessitated our being appointed as delegates by his party & accepting the constitution imposed at Surat. I spoke at most twenty or thirty words & the whole thing failedâ¦. At the Hooghly Provincial Conference we Nationalists had the majorityâ¦[but] in order to keep unity I asked the Nationalists not to oppose the Moderate resolution & leave the hall quietly so that they would not have to vote. The Moderate leaders were very angry that people did not any more follow their tried & veteran leaders but so completely obeyed the young leaders. Surendranath could not realise the difference between old, upper middle class leadership due to their influence & money & the new leadership of those who stood for a principle & commanded a following. Surendranath had a personal magnetism & he was sweet-spoken; he could get round anybody. His idea was to become the undisputed leader of Bengal by using the Nationalists for the sword & the Moderates for the public face. In private he would go up to & accept the revolutionary movement. He even wanted to set up a provincial board of control of the revolutionaries! Barin once took a bomb to him & he was full of enthusiasm. He even had a letter from Surendranath, when he was arrested at Manicktolla Garden. But in the court they hushed up the matter as soon as Norton pronounced S. N. Banerji. [ABP]\n\nâThere is also no doubt that since the beginning of 1907 the Moderates practically left the Extremists in the lurch & veered round to the Govt. The following extract from Mintoâs letter to Morley dated March 19, 1907, makes it quite clear: â...a Deputation of Mahommedans & Hindus...came to see me last Friday.... The Deputation consisted of the Maharaja of Darbhanga, Surendra Nath Banerjee, Mr Chowdry, a member of the Congress, Narendra Nath Sen, Editor of the Indian Mirror, & three Mahommedan gentlemen.....It was simply marvellous...to see the âKing of Bengalâ sitting on my sofa with his Mahommedan opponents, asking for my assistance to moderate the evil passions of the Bengali, & inveighing against the extravagances of Bepin Chandra Pal.â [RCM]\n\nGokhaleâs letter to Wedderburn, 24 September 1909: âI fear one of our numerous disintegrations has overtaken us again â this time it is the national movement that appears to be going to pieces, throwing us back on Provincialism & one grieves to find that there is no influence available anywhere in the country, capable of staying the process. The organisation evolved by Mr Hume out of the material prepared by a succession of workers in different parts of the country is crumbling to pieces & the effort of the nationâs heart & mind that brought us together in that organization seems to have almost exhausted itself. The split at Surat, followed by the vigour with which the Government came down on the Extremists everywhere, has turned the whole Extremist party into active enemies of the national constitutional movement. And the Moderates placed between the officials & the Extremists have not the necessary public spirit & energy of character to hold together effectively for long, thought they are numerically strong in the country. In addition to the incessant attacks of the extremists, the conduct of the Bengal Moderates is hastening the disintegration of the national movement. Bengal really has no leader on our side. Surendranath B is an orator, but he has no great courage or backbone, & he cannot keep in hand the unruly pack whom he presses to lead. Moreover there is no doubt that the position of the constitutional party has been rendered almost impossible by the Govt.âs refusal to reconsider the partition & the continued incarceration of the deportees. [BRN]\n\nSurendranath succeeded after the Surat Congress (1907) in preventing the Extremists from dominating the Congressâ¦. The terrorism that had raised its head in Bengal under the leadership of Aravinda Ghose led to his trial in the famous Alipore Bomb Case. The trial ended in Aravindaâs acquittal, though many of his associates were sentenced to imprisonment for life. But ere long the Congress organisation passed under the control of Mahatma Gandhi with the result that when the Govt. of India Act of 1919 (q.v.) was on the basis of the Montagu-Chelmsford Report, Surendranath accepted it as fulfilling to a large extent the demand that the Congress had made in its earlier days but the Congress itself [all including its president Motilal Nehru & his closes colleague C.R. Das, excepting Tilak, were mesmerised by Gandhi] refused to accept it. Thus a definite breach took place between INC & Surendranath who, along with other older leaders of the Congress formed a new organisation called the Liberal Federation which, however, failed to secure much popular support. Surendranath, however, was nominated to the new Bengal Legislative Council, was knighted in 1921 & became a Minister of the Bengal Govt.; he piloted through the Legislature the Calcutta Municipal Bill of 1923 which undid the mischief of Lord Curzonâs earlier Act on the organisation & established complete popular control over the Calcutta Corporation. Surendranath had no faith in Gandhiâs non-cooperation movement started in 1920. [SB]\n\nThe breakaway SwarÄjya party headed by C.R. Das won handsomely the seats in the Bengal Legislative Assembly. Veterans of public life were defeated by unknown men set up by Deshbandhu. Surendranath Bannerjeaâ¦defeated by Dr BidhÄn Chandra Royâ¦. The Calcutta Municipal Act of 1923 was one of the major contributions of Sir Surendra Nath Bannerjea to the development of local self-government in India. It widened the franchise & made the Calcutta Corporation a democratic body. Under the Act, the Corporation was to have 85 councillors & five Aldermen. The Act abolished the post of the Chairman & provided instead a Mayor elected by special meetings of the Corporationâ¦. Deshbandhu Das decided to contest the elections to the Corporation in the name of the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee. The Congress won most of the seats without contestâ¦. It was the unanimous wish of the entire city that Deshbandhu Das should be the first Mayor of Calcutta & after some initial reluctance he agreed. [HDG]\n\nNotwithstanding therefore his important legislative achievement his countrymen ceased to regard him, as before as their accredited leader. He was defeated in the election to the Calcutta Corporation in 1923 & was henceforth practically excluded from public life till his death in 1925â¦. He therefore did not die in a blaze of glory, but there is no doubt that he had been one of the makers of modern Indian nationalism of which independent India is a product.

Elliot (d.1910), an ICS officer of Bombay presidency, was appointed principal tutor to 12-year old SayÄjirao to groom him into a cringing dependent. Not only did the boy develop a will of his own, consulted experienced elders like Tilak, Gokhale & others inimical to British Paramountcy, went on foreign travels to learn modern ideas & means, he initiated administrative reforms for his subjectsâ benefit. The BÄpat Case (1894-5) was the first, if not the most perilous encounter created by the Octopus to result as it did with SayÄjiraoâs predecessor Malharrao in 1875, in SayÄjiraoâs deposition & exile. In June 1881, the spies of the Resident, or AGG (Agent of Gov.-Gen.), âdiscoveredâ a pamphlet vilifying the Viceroyâs appointee, Diwan MÄdhava Rao & imputed it to BÄpat, Samarth (SubÄ of Baroda), Athavale (Naib-Dewan), & Tilak, & claimed SayÄjirao âwas privy to itâ. Indicting BÄpat & attacking Elliot was the first step to entrap him. Succeeding Residents kept trying to convict & punish SayÄjirao but never succeeded.\n\nUnder British rule the first posting of European ICS boy-officers was usually as Collector with unlimited power over districts often larger than England itself. Its cruellest impact on agriculture was its zamindari, ryotwari & mahalwari systems of land revenue fixation & collection, & the most debilitating was the commercialisation of agricultural products, anything felt useful as raw material for British industries was sent there, their products imported duty-free & forced on India. In 1883, after a tour of Kadi SayÄjirao set up his Land (Revenue) Survey & Settlement Department under Elliot, to deal with the vexed question of barkhÄli lands, lands wholly or almost free from taxation. Sri Aurobindoâs first posting was in Elliotâs Dept., then to the Revenue Dept. expressly charged âto study most fully, the details connected with the work of subordinate officersâ. One of Elliotâs tasks was to device means to revive panchayati rule. In 1888, the Resident opened a dossier targeting Elliot & SayÄjirao to which their well-meaning land-revenue legislation of 1889 provided an opening to inflate trivial plaints. In 1890, SayÄjirao unwittingly provided the Resident a potent ally by making Manibhai Jashbhai (former aide to the Resident) Dewan who at the Residentâs bidding inserted British moles into Elliotâs Dept. to subvert it & blame SayÄjirao & Elliot. One of them was A.F. Machonochie, a Machiavellian ICS officer from Bombay Presidency. Their prime target was VÄsudeva SadÄshiv BÄpat whom the Maharaja had, on Elliotâs recommendation, appointed Assistant Commissioner in 1893. BÄpat, a friend of Tilak, owed his rapid rise to that rank to hard work, intelligence & integrity. Mr Elliot had realised on taking charge of the Land Survey Dept. that BÄpat would be of real help in the disposal of claims to exemption from payment of the State dues. BÄpatâs rise had wounded Machonochie & some other English officers who sought, with the aide of some vested interests in the State, to turn departmental looseness to their own advantage. This combination against Elliot & BÄpat was backed up by a more powerful combination headed by the Resident & Manibhai Jashbhai, the Dewan. In October 1893, SayÄjirao returned from his fourth foreign trip; next month fooled by the Resident-Dewan duo, he signed Elliotâs removal from the Council that officiated in his absence & authorised Col. Biddulph (Resident 1893-95) to intervene at will in his absence, & escaped to Europe. In January 1894, SayÄjirao instructed Elliot that before going on leave he was to introduce elective councils in at least 100 villages, as âit will be the keystone of what I wish to develop in my State.â Immediately Biddulph got the ICS to probe into Elliotâs work. After successfully warding off that attack, Elliot left on leave. Now Manibhai brought charges of corruption, extortion, & provincialism. When it became clear in June 1894, that it was not safe for BÄpat to continue in Baroda, Tilak sent Mr Joshi, proprietor of Poonaâs ChitrashÄla to Baroda; with great difficulty this resourceful gentleman succeeded in snatching BÄpat away from the State. Rebuffing Tilakâs efforts at reconciliation, Manibhai suspended BÄpat retrospectively from Jan. 1894; & appointed a Commission of Inquiry. Accompanied by two attorneys provided by Tilak, BÄpat returned to stand the trial, which began in September 1894. Sir P.M. Mehta conducted the prosecution in the early stages. When he left the case in disgust, Mr Branson of Bombay Bar was briefed in his place. SayÄjirao, who had heard of the goings-on in August, decided not to return until the Inquiry concluded. In spite Tilak (who had to replace of BÄpatâs attorney who had died midway) invalidating all charges, the Commission demanded a very harsh sentence. It was only on the advice of Lord Reay (q.v.) to return immediately to Baroda & handle the case that SayÄjirao returned from that longest escape to Europe. And even then he merely transferred the matter to Baroda High Court & escaped to Ooty where he called Sri Aurobindo âto prepare a prÃ©cis of the whole case & the judicial opinions on itâ! The Court exonerated BÄpat. In reprisal, ICS authorities demoted & banished Elliot to obscure BijÄpur, & sent its thug Machonochie to JunÄgadh to ruin his âfriendâ Shyamji Krishnavarma then its Dewan; SK too ran to Tilak to save him. The shrewd Gaekwad dismissed both BÄpat & Manibhai, albeit with compensation. In a letter to Elliot, penny-pinching SayÄjirao regretted the loss of two to three lakhs for not having nipped the conspiracy in the bud, but pupil SayÄjirao confessed he procrastinated due to âfear of the Residencyâ.

His mother was the daughter of a ParamÄra Rajput who ruled from ChandrÄvati in Mount á¾¹bu â its peak (Guru Shikhar) rises to 1722 metres above sea level. After his fatherâs assassination (c.716), his mother & he were spirited away by their Bheel attendants to their village in NÄgda. Raised & trained by Bheel warriors who were accomplished archers, he was guided by the priest of their Shiva Eklingji temple. At the age of 18, he won back his fatherâs kingdom of Idar, then led his mixed army northwards & captured Chittodgadh (see Chitore), then the capital of MÄn Mori. From there BÄppÄ expanded the boundaries of MewÄr from á¾¹bu to Jaisalmer & Ajmer. The invasions of Arabs began as an extension of their invasion of Persia. In order to ward off these invasions across the western & northern borders of RÄjputÄna, BÄppÄ united the smaller states of Ajmer & Jaisalmer & turned the tide for a while. When Bin KÄsim defeated king Dahir of Sindh, BÄppÄ rushed there & saved Sindh. Some accounts say that when KÄsim attacked Chitore, BÄppÄ pursued him through SaurÄshtra right into present Baluchistan. He then marched on to Ghazni & defeated the local ruler Salim & after nominating a representative returned to Chitore. After Raja Mori named BÄppÄ RÄwal his successor & crowned him King of Chitore, BÄppÄ RÄwal & his armies invaded various kingdoms including Kandahar, Khorasan, Baghdad, Turan, Isfahan, Iran & made them vassals of his kingdom. Thus he not only defended Indiaâs frontiers but for a brief period was able to expand them. Around 753, he abdicated the throne in favour of his son & took up sanyÄsa to surrender himself solely to Lord Shiva.\n\nBaptista, Joseph (1864-1930), a barrister of Bombay & one of the leaders of Tilakâs nationalist party.

When Pontius Pilate, the Roman procurator who annually released a prisoner at the Jewish festival of Passover, offered to release Jesus, âthe entire Jewish communityâ proclaims this Christian myth, held Him a worse criminal than Barabbas & voted for His death & Barabbasâ release implying Jews are genetically vile.

It is a lamentation by a Welsh bard, & a curse pronounced by him & the ghosts of his slaughtered companions on Edwardâs race, whose misfortunes are foretold.\n\nBardoli town in Surat district of Gujarat. The Khilafat Agitation, having led to riots & massacres, was put down by the British Govt. in November 1921. At the annual Congress the next month at Ahmedabad, Gandhi was unanimously voted the sole national executive authority of INC. In 1922, he launched a âconstructive programmeâ from Bardoli. In a private letter Sri Aurobindo called this âconstructive programmeâ, a ânarrow & rigid cadreâ¦which seems to me to construct nothingâ but create a âfetish-worship of non-cooperation as an end in itself rather than a meansâ which is not âfavourable for the wide & complex action necessary to prepare the true SwarÄjyaâ. When Gandhiâs satyagrahis in Chauri-Chaura, Uttar Pradesh, burned down the police station along with the policemen in retaliation for police atrocities against them, Gandhi called off the programme â to the chagrin of his amazed lieutenants like Nehru (see his Autobiography). â Extract from a talk with Sri Aurobindo on 21 Aug.1926: Disciple: Perhaps he would have succeeded if he had continued his Satyagraha in Bardoli? Sri Aurobindo: No, that would have ended in a miserable failure. There would have been massacres & Indiaâs political progress would have been checked for decades. Gandhi had the right inspiration when he stopped it; he saw he was going beyond his depths. â So it was only pretence when he stopped civil disobedience at Bardoli? â It was not pretence. It was actually something behind his mind which, without his knowledge, stopped him; his mind only supplied the justifications.

To suppress the growing nationalism in Bengal, Curzon created East Bengal predominated by loyalist Mahommedans & appointed Bampfylde Fuller its Lt Governor. Fuller promptly issued two circulars which restricted public processions of the nationalists & subjected teachers & students to police surveillance. In April Bengalâs nationalists held their provincial conference there with Bar-at-Law Mohammad Rasul (q.v.) as president-elect. On the day of the Conference the delegates & Mr Rasul marched in procession to the place of the conference. On the pretext that someone from among them had shouted âBande Mataramâ the police brutally assaulted & arrested the leaders & lÄthi-charged the others.\n\nBarmecide In The Arabian Nights in the story âBarberâs Sixth Brotherâ a Barmecide prince invites a hungry beggar to a banquet & serves a succession of imaginary dishes. The beggar pretends to enjoy them with such gusto & good-humour that he finally earns a real sumptuous feast. In another version, the beggar, entering into the spirit of the jest, also pretends to be intoxicated by the imaginary wine offered him, & falls upon his entertainer. Hence âBarmecidalâ is used for one who offers illusory benefits & âBarmecide feastâ for something that appears highly desirable but proves to be imaginary, illusory.â Barmecides or Barmekids is patronymic of a Persian family whose origin is traceable to hereditary Pramukhas, administrators, of the Buddhist monastery Nava-VihÄra west of Balkh. Converted during the Arab-Muslim invasion of the Persian SasÄnian Empire, the Skt. Pramukha was arabized to Barmak. The first member of the family whose name âBarmakâ is preserved in historical records was a physician of Balkh. His son Khalid ibn Barmak or Khalid al-Barmaki (705-782 AD; s/a âKhaled of the Seaâ) supported the civil war that brought in the Abbasside Caliphate governing from Baghdad. He became the prime minister of Al Saffah, the first Caliph of the Abbasside dynasty in Baghdad, with powers such a tax collecting & overseeing the army; later he was appointed governor of Fars & Tabaristan. His son Yaá¸¥yÄ ibn KhÄlid (d.806), at one time Governor of Arminiya, was entrusted by Caliph al-Mahdi (ruled 775-85) with the education of his son, Haroun, the future Caliph Haroun al-Rasheed. âWe know of Yaá¸¥yÄ ibn Khalid al-Barmaki as a patron of physicians (writes a historian) &, specifically, of the translation of Hindu medical works into both Arabic & Persian. In all likelihood however, his activity took place in the orbit of the Caliphal court in Iraq, where at the behest of HÄrÅ«n al-RashÄ«d (786â809), such books were translated into Arabic. Thus KhurÄsÄn or Khorasan (q.v.) & Transoxiana were effectively bypassed in this transfer of learning from India to Islam, even though, undeniably the Barmakiâs cultural outlook owed something to their land of origin, northern KhurÄsÄn, & Yaá¸¥yÄ al-Barmakiâs interest in medicine may have derived from no longer identifiable family tradition.â The Barmekids were highly educated, respected & influential throughout Arabia, Persia, Central Asia & the Levant. In Baghdad, the Barmekid court became a centre of patronage for the Ulema, poets, & scholars alike. Many Barmekids were patrons of the sciences, which greatly helped the propagation of Indo-Iranian science & scholarship into the Islamic world of Baghdad & beyond. They are also credited with the establishment of the first paper mill in Baghdad. The power of the Barmekids in those times is reflected in Arabian Nights or the book of One Thousand & One Nights, e.g. Yaá¸¥yÄâs son Jaâfar ibn Barmak appears in several stories as Caliph Harun al-Rashidâs vizier. As mentor & aide to HÄroun & later his prime minister, Yaá¸¥yÄ became the most able administrator of the Caliphate. Yaá¸¥yÄâs sons Al-Fadl (766â808) & JÄâfar (767â803), both occupied high offices under HÄroun, until they & the family fell from his grace in 803.\n\nBarmeky or Barmeki, son of Barmak; here it refers to JÄâfar bin Barmak\n\nBarnesville subdivisional officer of Jamalpur was transferred after he had executed to a âTâ Lt-Gov.

In 600 AD, a flooded VishwÄmitri forced the inhabitants of Ankotakka to migrate to a village on the opposite bank. During its evolution as the GaikwÄdâs capital its name changed from vaá¹­a-udara (trunk of a Vada, banyan tree) though WadÅdarÄ to VadÅdarÄ to Baroda. The city was built with the palace in MÄndavi at its centre & on four sides the massive carved stone DarwÄjas, gateways, named LeheripurÄ, ChÄmpÄneri, Baranpuri, & PÄni. The region around Baroda was first taken by the GaikwÄds in 1725 & finally occupied in 1734. It became their capital in 1770s by when their territories extended from Songadh in the south to Rajpipla & Idar in the east, from Aá¹hilwÄd-PÄtan & Kadi & PÄlanpur in the north to Amreli & DwÄrkÄ in the west. But of these, those left for SayÄjirao III to âruleâ over when the British (the Paramount Power as it called itself) âcrownedâ him GaikwÄd of Baroda on 26th Dec.1881, extended over some 300-400 miles east to west & 200 miles north to south & were grouped into five districts: Vadodara (1922 sq. miles), Kadi (3050 sq. miles), NavasÄri (1811 sq. miles), & Amreli & OkhÄmaá¹dal: 1352 sq. miles. The population at the time was roughly two million. â The famine that raged in most parts of the country since 1895, struck MahÄrÄshá¹­ra in 1897. A new scourge followed: a ship that came to Bombay from China carried bubonic plague. It swept Bombay presidency, killing 20,000 & invaded Baroda State & relief-measures led to popular displeasure. In 1899, the monsoon failed leading to, perhaps, the severest famine of the century that the State had seen. Among the preventive schemes started was sinking wells, digging tanks, drainage construction, soft loans to farmers, & the assimilation of the State currency to the British. The Census of 1891 showed the population at 2,415,396 that of 1901 put it at 1,952,692 â the blessings of maternal Pax Britannica!\n\nThe most revolutionary achievement of SayÄjirao was (1) starting free compulsory primary education first in Kadi in 1883 & making it state-wide in 1906. Of the thousands of his poor subjects whose lives were transformed was Dr. Ambedkar. (2) On 31st March 1908, OâGrady, a member of the British Parliament rose in the House of Commons & asked: âIs the Secretary of State for India aware that the Maharaja of Baroda has separated the judicial from the executive functions, has restored local self-government, has instituted compulsory primary education throughout his State, & has further instituted popularly elected members in his Legislative Council? If so, will the Gov.-Generalâs Council of India consider the application of such reforms to other Native States & to India as a whole?â Naturally imperialist Minto-Morley âcould not undertake introduction of similar measures in the whole of British Indiaâ. (3) Again, while English replaced Latin-French as judicial courtsâ language in England only 1731 â 500 years after the Magna Charta, SayÄjirao made the native tongues of his kingdom official court languages. Alas, this most advanced native state during British Raj was honoured by âourâ Socialist Secular Republic by refusing to accept any of the three of its unique achievements mentioned above, & only decades later tolerated the restoration of its capitalâs original name â VadÅdarÄ.\n\nBaroda College Sri Aurobindo began working in this College (then affiliated to Bombay University) in 1897 while continuing with his other official duties. In January 1905, he was appointed Vice Principal & was for a time Acting Principal & also officiated as Education Minister. He gave his resignation in 1906 to move to Calcutta where he had been appointed as Principal of the Bengal National College. The Baroda College is now incorporated in the Maharaja SayÄjirao University. The room in the old building in which he took his classes has been specially maintained. On 22 July, 1899, addressing its students Sri Aurobindo said: âI think there is no student of Oxford or Cambridge who does not look back in after days on the few years of his undergraduate life asâ¦ that which calls up the happiest memories. He goes up from the restricted life of his home (see Manchester & St Paulâs School) & finds himself in surroundings which with astonishing rapidity expand his intellect, strengthen his character, develop his social faculties, force out all his abilities & turn him in three years from a boy into a man. His mind ripens in the contact with minds which meet from all parts of the country & have been brought up in many various kinds of trainings, his unwholesome eccentricities wear away & the unsocial, egoistic elements of character are to a large extent discouraged. He moves among ancient & venerable buildings, the mere age & beauty of which are in themselves an education. He has the Union which has trained so many great orators & debaters, has been the first trial ground of so many renowned intellectsâ¦. The result is that he who entered the university a raw student, comes out of it a man & a gentleman, accustomed to think of great affairs & fit to move in cultivated society, & he remembers his College & University with affection, & in after days if he meets with those who have studied with him he feels attracted towards them as to men with whom he has a natural brotherhood. This is the social effect I should like the Colleges & Universities of India also able to exercise, to educate by social influence as well as those which are merely academical & to create a feeling among their pupils that they belong to the community, that they are children of one mother.â [CWSA Vol.01, pp.353-54]\n\nBesides his own experience at the College, he had the advantage of his bond with James Cotton who met him at the College during a visit to India. In 1904, when Viceroy Curzon passed the Indian Universities Act based on the opinion of the Education Commission headed by Thomas Raleigh the Law Member of his Executive Council (for details see Calcutta University), Maharaja SayÄjirao discussed the issue with his chief officers & also Tilak whom he held in high esteem.\n\nExtract from the notes from which Sri Aurobindo addressed the meeting: âYour Highness & Gentlemen, the subject on which I wish to address you this evening... is Educationâ¦. I have to say this that the Govt. of India is in the first place not the fit body to formulate the necessary improvements & in the second place not the fit instrument to put them into force. It is not fit to formulate them because it cannot realise & feel as we do where the shoe pinches us & therefore in mending itâ¦. The Indian University system has confined itself entirely to [the intellectual branch/ part of education which is not more important than physical training & edification of character]â¦. The real source of the evil we complain of isâ¦ a fundamental & deplorable error by which we in this country have confused education with the acquisition of knowledge & interpreted knowledge itself in a singularly narrow & illiberal sense. To give the student knowledge is necessary, but it is still more necessary to build up in him the power of using his knowledge.... [The] graduate from our colleges may be a good clerk, a decent Vakil or a tolerable medical practitioner, but unless he is an especial genius, he will never be a great administrator or a great lawyer or an eminent medical specialist. These eminences have to be filled up mainly by Europeans. It an Indian wishes to rise to them, he has to travel thousands of miles over the sea in order to breathe an atmosphere of liberal knowledge, original science & sound culture. And even then he seldom succeeds, because his lungs are too debilitated to take in a good long breath of that atmosphereâ¦. The easy assumption of our educationists that we have only to supply the mind with a smattering of facts in each department of knowledge & the mind can be trusted to develop itself & take its own suitable road, is contrary to science, contrary to human experience & contrary to the universal opinion of civilised countries. Indeed the history of intellectual degeneration in gifted races always begins with the arrest of these three mental powers by the excessive cultivation of mere knowledge at their expense. Much as we have lost as a nation, we have always preserved our intellectual alertness, quickness & originality; but even this last gift is threatened by our University system, & if it goes, it will be the beginning of irretrievable degradation & final extinction. ..... The very first step in reform must therefore be to revolutionize the whole aims & methods of our education. We must accustom teachers to devote nine-tenths of their energies to the education of the active mental faculties, while the passive retaining faculty, which we call the memory, should occupy a recognised & well-defined but subordinate place, & we must direct our school & university examinations to the testing of these active faculties & not of the memoryâ¦. There is in fact hardly any subject, the sciences of calculation excepted, which in the hands of a capable teacher does not give room for the development of all the general faculties of the mind. The first thing needed therefore is the entire & unsparing rejection of the present methods of teaching in favour of those which are now being universally adopted in the more advanced countries of Europe.... But even in the narrower sphere of knowledge acquisition to which our system has confined itself, it has been guilty of other blunders quite as serious. Apart from pure mathematics, which stands on a footing of its own, knowledge may be divided into two great heads, the knowledge of things & the knowledge of men, i.e. to say of human thought, human actions, human nature & human creations as recorded, preserved or pictured in literature, history, philosophy & art.... The humanities, mathematics & science are therefore the three sisters in the family of knowledge & any self-respecting system of education must in these days provide facilities for mastery in any one of these as well as for a modicum of all. The first great error of our system comes in here. While we insist on passing our students through a rigid & cast-iron course of knowledge in everything, we give them real knowledge in nothing. What does an average Bombay University graduate who has taken English Literature for his optional subject, know of that literature? He has read a novel of Jane Austen or the Vicar of Wakefield, a poem of Tennyson or a book of Milton, at most two plays of Shakespeare, a work of Baconâs or Burkeâs full of ideas which he is totally incompetent to digest & one or two stray books of Pope, Dryden, Spenser or other, & to crown this pretentious little heap of a mass of second-hand criticism dealing with poets & writers of whom he has not studied a single line. When we remember that English is the main study of our schools & colleges, what a miserable outturn is this, what a wretched little mouse out of that mountain of drudgery from which the voice of the oppressed student is heard painfully & monotonously repeating like Valmekie, his marÄ, marÄ, marÄ has not been converted into RÄma, RÄma, RÄma; for while he thinks he has been repeating the saving word which gives intellectual salvation, it has been unknown to him converted into a death dealing word which causes intellectual sterility & impotence.â [CWSA-1:357-62]\n\nBarrack Room Ballads by Rudyard Kipling.\n\nBartamÄn RananÄ«ti booklet published in 1907 by Abinash Bhattacharya dealing with military data of some European countries.\n\nSaint Bartholomew one of the apostles charged with baptizing the damned souls of North India.

The Battala woodcuts were printed on cheap newsprint like paper to keep the cost of these prints low. Because of the short run, cheap paper & humid conditions of the region very few of these prints have survived. In the early 19th Century, the Battala area became known for the prints, which typically had a religious or mystical theme.

Most of the district currently known as VÄrÄnasi was acquired by GangÄpurâs zamindar Mansa Ram (1737-40), when Moghul suzerainty weakened after Aurangzebâs death in 1707. His successor Balwant Singh (1711-70) took over the territories of Jaunpur, VÄrÄnasi, & Chunar in 1740 from the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah & declared himself the Raja of Banaras. Later he added the territories of Chandauli, GyÄnpur, Chakia, Latif Shah, Mirzapur, Nandeshwar, Mint House, & VindhyÄchal. With the decline of the Mughal Empire, the bhÅ«mihÄrs (zamÄ«ndÄrs) under Balwant Singh strengthened their sway in the area south of Awadh & in the fertile rice growing areas of Benares, Jaunpur, Gorakhpur, Basti, Deoria, Azamgarh, Ghazipur, Ballia & Bihar & on the fringes of Bengal. There were as many as 100,000 men backing their power which proved a decisive advantage when they faced the Nawab of Oudh in the 1750s & the 1760s. An exhausting guerrilla war, forced the Nawab to withdraw his main force. After Balwant Singhâs death in 1770, the kingdom was ruled by his successor Chait Singh (d.1810), still as feudatory of the Nawab. From the day in 1775, Chait Singh signed a treaty with Gov.-Gen.

The Nationalists wanted to extend the Boycott & Swadeshi movements to start a nationwide mass movement, & boycott the visit of the Prince of Wales in protest against the Bengal Partition. The Moderates held that the Nationalistsâ methods of passive resistance were impractical or even injurious by denying themselves educational opportunities & also opposed a boycott of the Prince of Walesâ visit. In the end the Benares Congress only condemned the Government repression & justified boycott only as a âlast protestâ & repeated their demands for reform of the legislative councils. In 1910, Benares became a part of the British Indiaâs United Provinces. In 1911, its Raja was made a slave-cum-feudatory of the Queen-Empress & the vanity of 13-gun salute. However, even today the majority of the Hindu populace of the region holds on to tradition of revering the KÄshi Naresh as an incarnation of Lord Shiva who is believed to have founded the city of KÄshi. The Naresh is also the chief cultural patron & an essential part of all religious celebrations. [S. Bhattacharya, pp.118, 127; R.C. Majumdar et alâs Advanced History of India; Sanderson Beckâs article âIndiaâs Freedom Struggleâ in Indiaâs Renaissance, & âBanaras Stateâ on Internet]\n\nBenaras (Hindu) College/ Central Hindu College âWarren Hastings encouraged the revival of Indian learning & to him we owe,â says Dr. R.C. Majumdar, âthe foundation of the Calcutta MadrÄsÄ. Inspired by the same spirit, Sir William Jones founded the Asiatic Society of Bengal in Calcutta in 1784, & a Sanskrit College was established at Benares by the Resident Jonathan Duncan, in 1791â¦. In her autobiography (1893), Annie Besant writes: âThe Indian work is, first of all, the revival, strengthening, & uplifting of the ancient religions. This has brought with it new self-respect, a pride in the past, a belief in the future, &, as an inevitable result, a great wave of patriotic life, the beginning of the rebuilding of a nation.â She started the Central Hindu School in Benares as a chief means of achieving her object. She lavished her resources & energy on this institution, which gradually developed into a College, & was ultimately merged into the Hindu University.â [An Advanced History of India, 1973-74, pp.810, 881-82]\n\nMrs Annie Besant, who had been a member of the London School Board (1887-90), was eager to establish learning institutions in India based on Hindu philosophy. In 1898 she founded the Central Indian College in the KÄmÄchha area of VÄrÄnasi; because, âshe wanted to bring men of all religions together under the ideal of brotherhood in order to promote Indian cultural values & to remove ill-will among different sections of the Indian population.â [S. Bhattacharya] In 1903 Malaviya, who had supported Besantâs cause, raised Rs 250,000 to finance the construction of the schoolâs hostel. In 1907 Besant had applied for a royal charter to establish a university. However, there was no response from the British government. In April 1911, the two agreed to join forced to build a university in the same city, & in November, MÄlaviya registered the Hindu University Society to gather support & raise funds for building the university. He spent the next 4 years gathering support & raising funds for the university. He sought & received early support from the KÄshi Naresh Prabhu Narayan Singh & Maharaja Sir Rameshwar Singh Bahadur of Raja Darbhanga. In November 1915, Besant, Bhagawan Das (q.v.), & other trustees of the Central Hindu School agreed to the governmentâs condition that the school become a part of the new university. Thus the Banaras Hindu University (BHU), formerly Central Hindu College, was established in 1916 by Pandit Madan Mohan MÄlaviya, with over 12,000 students residing in campus.\n\nBengal is the anglicised form of BÄnglÄ evolved from the Bengali Baá¹ga of the Sanskrit Vaá¹ga which denoted Eastern & Central Bengal in the age of the Dharma sutras & the Epics. Western & north-western Bengal was then known as Gauá¸a. Vaá¹ga & Gauá¸a were both included in the empires of the Mauryas & the GuptÄs (q.v.). In the middle of 6th century Gauá¸a became quite a powerful state. The Sena dynasty that ruled in Bengal in the 11th & 12th centuries built a powerful kingdom, promoted Sanskrit learning & patronised poets like Jayadeva. VidyÄpatiâs âfive Bengalsâ stood for the five divisions of Gauá¸a made by Vallalasena, Gaudesh (the king of Gauá¸a), who ruled from 1159 to 1179, & whose father Vijayasena (ruled 1095-1158) had brought west & north Bengal under his control. The five divisions were: BÄgdÄ« (q.v.), Rarha, Varendra, Vaá¹ga, & Mithila.\n\nIn British India, Bengal proper, Bihar, & Orissa formed a single province from 1765 up to 1905, when it was divided by Lord Curzon: fifteen districts of eastern Bengal were separated & united with Assam to form a new province called âEast Bengal & Assamâ. The capital of this new province was Dacca; its people were mainly Muslims. The purpose of the division of the large province of Bengal, announced in July 1905, was to increase the conflicts between nationalist Hindus & Muslims in Bengal. The plan was approved by the Secretary of State without consulting the Parliament. The Bengal Legislative Council strongly denounced the plan on July 8, & the Indian press in Bengal & other provinces condemned the proposal. The weekly Sanjivani suggested a boycott of British goods on July 13, & a public meeting at Bagerhat adopted it three days later. The boycott idea spread as two thousand public meetings were organized in the cities & in hundreds of villages. In the town of Barisal students & even teachers went to school barefoot & were threatened with expulsion. On 16 Oct. 1905, Ananda Mohan Bose (q.v.) laid the Foundation Stone of the Akhanda Buá¹ga Bhavan, Hall of Indivisible Bengal, or Milan Mandir, Temple where East & West Bengal unite; â later known as Federation Hall. In 1911 because of continuing public agitation the British Govt. reunited East & West Bengal. Assam again became a chief commissionership, & Bihar & Orissa were separated to form a new province.\n\nThe 1922 Gaya session of the Congress was followed by the resignation of C.R. Das as the President of the organisation. He then formed within the Congress a party called the Swaraj Party (q.v.). In the election to the Bengal Legislative Council held in 1923, the Swaraj Party led by C.R. Das became the largest single party capturing 46 seats out of its 139 seats but Das declined the offer made by Lord Lytton, the Governor of Bengal, to form a new ministry. He held discussions with prominent Muslim leaders of Bengal & early in December 1923 came to an agreement with them. The terms of the Bengal Pact, were passed in the meeting of the Swaraj Party Councillors held on 16 December 1923 & also passed in the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee meeting held on 18 December 1923.\n\nChitta Ranjan Misra: The Terms of the Bengal Pact of 1923 included: (a) Representation in the Bengal Legislative Council would be on population basis with separate electorates; (b) Representation in the local bodies would be on the proportion of 60 per cent to the majority community & 40 per cent to the minority community; (c) Regarding Government appointments, it was decided that fifty five per cent of the appointments should go to the Muslims. Till the above percentage was attained, 80 per cent of posts would go to the Muslims & the remaining 20 per cent should go to the Hindus; (d) No resolution or enactment would be allowed to be moved without the consent of 75 per cent of the elected members of the affected community; (e) Music in processions would not be allowed in front of the mosques; (f) No legislation in respect of cow killing for food would be taken up in the Council & endeavour should be made outside the Council to bring about an understanding between the two communities. Cow killing should be taken up in such a manner as not to wound the religious feelings of the Hindus & cow killing for religious purpose should not be interfered withâ¦. S.N. Bannerjea & B.C. Pal were among the Hindu leaders who stood up against the Pactâ¦. Emphasising the necessity of the Pact, Das remarked that Swaraj would not come without Hindu-Muslim unity. He was supported in his stance by a considerable number of Congressmen in Bengal [&] got whole-hearted support for his scheme from the majority of the Muslims of Bengal. The latter welcomed the Pact wholeheartedly because in their opinion it was the sensible solution to their problems. The Muslim leaders of Bengal held that, if implemented, the Pact would strike at the root of communal strife. The Muslim press thanked those Hindu leaders for their greatness in meeting the just demands of the Muslims through formulating the Pact in consultation with them. But the Muslims were very disheartened when the Bengal Pact was rejected by the CocÄnada (q.v.) Session of the Indian National Congress held in December 1923. The decision of the Congress was characterised by Muslim leaders of Bengal short-sighted & aggressively selfish. In their opinion the CocÄnada Congress had committed the worst blunder in the history of the Congress movement for it dealt a serious blow to the cause of Hindu-Muslim unity, the cause for which the INC stood. But C.R. Dasâ¦criticised the stand of the INC & declared: âYou may delete the Bengal Pact from the resolutions but you cannot delete Bengal from the Indian National Congressâ¦.â And he succeeded in getting the terms of his Bengal Pact ratified by the Bengal Provincial Congress Conference, held at Sirajganj in June 1924. Unfortunately his premature death in 1925 came as a blow to the cause of Hindu-Muslim unity. His death was followed by the repudiation of the Pact, even by some of his own followers. A large number of Bengali Muslim politicians became shocked at this act & began to move away from the Congress as well as the SwarÄjya Party. The defection of the Muslims was marked by the formation of the Independent Muslim Party in 1926 by some prominent Muslim leaders of the province like Maulvi Abdul Karim, MaulÄnÄ Abdur Rauf, Khan Bahadur Azizul Huq, Maulvi Abdullahil Baqi, Maulvi Ashraf ud-din Ahmed, Dr A. Suhrawardy, A.K. Fazlul Huq, & others. Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy became the Provisional Secretary of the Party. Indeed, from this time on, the Muslims of Bengal began to reconsider their stand in Bengal politics. The result of all these manoeuvrings was a revival of communal politics in the province.â [âBengal Pactâ, Banglapedia]\n\nAbinash Bhattacharya: I was the first to return from the Andamans. Almost four years later, Hem-da & UllÄskar came back. I met Aurobindo-babu again for the first time in fourteen years in Pondicherry [in 1923]. I was with him for a month. Every day we used to talk on various subjects. I have brought out excerpts of these talks in the monthly BÄsumati. I mention one or two things here. When I first saw him he told me: âChitta has made a big mistake.â â What has Chitta done this time? â âSigned this pact â this pact means admitting that there are two races in India, the Hindus & Muslims. Now we will have to face the virulent consequences.â â You are engaged in the discipline of yoga & have become a sadhu, why do you have to concern yourself with all this? â âI am not doing this yoga for my personal liberation; my sÄdhanÄ is for the good of the whole world. To lift man to a higher state of progress is my endeavour. â In that case you shouldnât make a distinction between the Hindus & the Muslims. â âThat is just what I say. In India there will be no Hindus & no Muslims, All will be one Indian.â â How are Europe & America to blame? â âI do not reproach or hate them. But I still want our fallen Mother India to rise once again, resplendent & glorious. I also want â without the others being diminished â that my Mother should stand out as the foremost among them â my mother Bengal. Let the Bengali be the foremost â this is my heartfelt desire.â\n\nI was fortunate enough to have lived together with Sri Aurobindo for a few days. I called him Sejda & addressed him as tumi [familiar form of the second person.] I had the opportunity to observe him at close range at his daily workâ¦. He gave me affection & sometimes scolded me for my childish conduct. [Original published in Golpo-Bharati, Vol.6, 1950-51, pp. 829-50; its translation from the Bengali in Srinvantu, November 1984, was reproduced under title âSri Aurobindoâ in Mother India, July 2012, pp.528-39]\n\nSri Aurobindo on 19 October 1946: ââ¦the conditions of the Hindus [in Bengal] are terrible & they may even get worse in spite of the interim mariage de convenance at Delhi. But we must not let our reaction to it become excessive or suggest despair. There must be at least 20 million Hindus in Bengal & they are not going to be exterminated, â even Hitler with his scientific methods of massacre could not exterminate the Jews who are still showing themselves very much alive &, as for Hindu culture, it is not such a weak & fluffy thing as to be easily stamped out; it has lasted through something like 5 millenniums at least & is going to carry on much longer & has accumulated quite enough power to survive. What is happening did not come to me as a surprise. I foresaw it when I was in Bengal & warned people that it was probable & almost inevitable & that they should be prepared for it. At that time no one attached any value to what I said although some afterwards remembered & admitted, when the trouble first began, that I have been right; only C.R. Das had grave apprehensions & he even told me when he came to Pondicherry that he would not like the British to go out until this dangerous problem had been settled.â [CWSA 36:208]\n\nS.
