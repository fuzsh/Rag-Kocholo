        "text": "The word Ayurveda is an amalgamation of two words-“Ayu” which means life and “veda” which means knowledge or wisdom.Thus, Ayurveda collectively refers to the knowledge or science of life.Ayurveda is not only a medical science, but is a way of living, a culture to remain healthy.At a time when the whole of the Indians coalesced under one sky to fight the oppressive Britishers out from our soil,some of the prominent leaders of the freedom movement from the state ruminated over the idea of establishing an institute for propagating our very own Ayurvedic System of medicine.Though the British left India ,they lent their footsteps in every sphere threatening our indigenous culture and a need was desperately felt to safeguard our own Indianness.And thus as a measure to protect and preserve our own culture ,heritage ,and following in the footsteps of Gandhiji’s much touted call for “Swaraj”,under the astute and steadfast leadership of some of the prominent leaders of Assault like Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi ,Dr Jagdish Chandra Bhattacharya ,Dr Bhubaneswar Baruah,the Govt Ayurvedic College situated now at Jalukbari came into existence on 20th December,1948.Initially ,the college carried out it’s activities in the present Assam Engineering Institute (AEI)campus in Chandmari and later on the college was shifted to its permanent campus at Jalukbari .Even during the initial period ,the classes of Gauhati Medical College started from the premises of the Ayurvedic college itself.\n\nToday, a sense of profound pride traverses through every member of the Govt Ayurvedic college family as this pioneering institute in the entire North -East and the second government institute in Assam in post Independent India,working relentlessly for the upliftment of Ayurveda ,steps into its glorious 75 years of existence .Probably the second government institute of Assam after Independence,the college,throughout these 75 years have seen many ups and downs,in continuation of it’s journey to the present state. At present ,the College has to its credit of producing around 3000 ayurvedic doctors who are working and rendering yeoman’s service in different capacities in the state health system and the numbers are still counting .In 2001 ,two Post Graduate Departments namely Sanskrit ,samhita ,Siddhanta and Kayachikitsa(Medicine) were included and later on in 2014 another four new post graduate departments namely Roga Nidan and Vikriti Vigyan,Shalya(Surgery),Rachana Sharir(Anatomy),Prasuti tantra and stree roga(obstetrics and gynaecology) boosted the workings of the college and also thereby facilitating the production of a good number of ayurvedic specialists as well.The College was declared as a “Centre of Excellence” with respect to the upgradation of Panchakarma facilities and also the state Ayurvedic pharmacy by the Union Ayush Minister Sarbananda Sonowal in 2021.The completion of 75 years is itself an ample testimony to the fact that the college has succeeded in fulfilling the health related aspirations of the common people ,though a lot is yet to be done .This is further enthused after the installation of the Union Ayush Ministry in 2014 under the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nIt was established after independence with a spirit of nationalism by the enthusiastic efforts of our great leaders Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi, Lokbandhu Bhuvaneswar Baruah and founder principal Late Dr Jagdish Ch. Bhattacharya. This college was introduced in a rented house at Uzan bazaar on 20th December 1948 by the then Prime Minister of Assam Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi. After one year, it was shifted to the government house at Chandmari (the present site of Assam Engineering Institute) and in July 1959 the college was permanently shifted to present site at Jalukbari, Guwahati-14, Assam. In the year 1960, Guwahati Medical Colege took birth in this college at the present jalukbari site. Since then for a period of 7 years, the college building had been shared by both the college.\n\nThe government Ayurvedic College is attached with a hospital having OPD and IPD facilities. At present the IPD of the hospital is functioning with 150 number of beds. The NEC(north east council) in collaboration with Govt. of Assam has sanctioned a new sophisticated 300 beded hospital and the ground floor of the building was opened by hon’ble Chief Minister on 20th Dec. 2005. In this new building X- ray, USG & immunization centre are providing services and the remaining part is utilizing by the Prasuti & Stree Roga Deptt and Kaumarbhritya Deptt. Four Cabin rooms, nursing room, Faculty chambers, wards, Panchakarma unit, Eye OT, labour rooms and General OT. Some OPD are also running in this new hospital building. Old Assam type hospital building has been renovated, where IPD beds are allotted for Kayachikitsa, Salya, Shalakya (eye) and Swastharakshan (Roga nidan , swasthvritta, Samhita and siddhanta, Dravyaguna & RSVK Deptt.) . Another new building has recently been completed where the Emergency service, Few OPDs and Junior Doctor’s room has been shifted."
