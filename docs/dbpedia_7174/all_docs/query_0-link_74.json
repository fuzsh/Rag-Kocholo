        "text": "Why Interactive\n\nBy KC Saleem\n\nMy search has been for a new media platform where I can share these concerns. I had to challenge the existing organizations, while not scandalizing them. A huge investment, though, is needed, for which the organizational pattern of institutions is suitable to amass.\n\nRead more\n\nWe should not wait for them\n\nBy Salim Ahamed\n\nThe clerics are not at all concerned with what is happening in the society.

I was basking in the glory that in the doctoral studies I was acclaimed to have done an excellent job of proposing a model curriculum for Islamic religious higher education.\n\nRead more\n\nWill that Bird Sing Ever Again?\n\nBy Shameer KS\n\nAfter the funeral, one of the children said: 'Ali is gone.'

I have never heard thereafter anyone singing the sonorous Bird Song.\n\nRead more\n\nA Litmus Test of Street-fighting Organizational Jamborees\n\nBy Umar Nizar\n\nIf post-modernity is the unfinished project of modernity, then to paraphrase Walter Benjamin, modernity, in its turn, is the unfinished project of Romanticism in which each fragment in itself is a whole uniting itself with the transcendent.\n\nRead more\n\nAn Eye on Facts and fables of Religious Factions\n\nBy Abbas Panakkal\n\nThe mother’s eyes were moist and the heart heavy because she wept the whole day on the day of the holy Eid. How could a mother rejoice when one of her sons was fasting and other one was celebrating Eid?\n\nRead more"
