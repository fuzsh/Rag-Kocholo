        "text": "Studying the exchange of ideas through connections that might be considered ‘global’ has motivated constructive and lively debates in intellectual history. Religious studies, on the other hand, are only beginning to engage with the questions of what exactly might theoretically be considered ‘global,’ and how ‘global’ connections might be methodologically investigated.Footnote 1 A dialogue between scholars of global, intellectual and religious history would be specifically rewarding, not only because they derive many of their theoretical and methodological strengths from the fact that approaches to their governing subjects are highly disputed; but also because religious studies, as the arguably ‘oldest’ of the disciplines in question, are inherently intertwined with orientalist studies, their colonial framework and the very act of comparison that motivated nineteenth-century ‘comparative religion,’ which gave rise to Religionswissenschaft, or religious studies. Indeed, the discipline’s truly ‘global’ history and its heritage might itself be considered a prime example of the challenges of Eurocentrism, orientalism and intellectual exchanges under colonialism.\n\nIt is well established that religion lies at the core of central issues that have been debated by global historians for decades, including nineteenth-century racial and linguistic theories, social reform movements and the elusive subject of ‘modernity.’ There is wide agreement that, in the words of Peter van der Veer, ‘modernity has a global history’ that was not simply shaped by the colonizers.Footnote 2 ‘Modern’ movements that vigorously debated the meaning of religion and its relevance for ‘reform,’ in both Britain and its Indian colony, were not only interlinked but mutually dependent.Footnote 3 Unquestionably, these dynamics were marked by the complicity between imperialism and comparative religion, which often served colonial administrations: Peter Gottschalk has discussed in some detail how the notion of a ‘scientific’ study of religion functioned as ‘a universally applicable classificatory regimen in order to intellectually and/or politically manage the human diversity encountered globally. In other words, political rule of foreign societies required understanding their underlying systems of social organization.’Footnote 4\n\nAt the same time, scholars have complicated the history of comparative religion (and hence, religious studies) by increasingly examining its emergence from a global perspective.Footnote 5 While David Chidester has stressed ‘the importance of empire in the formation of comparative religion,’ he refocused the historiography of comparative religion from its colonizing functions in the peripheries to the intellectual knowledge production of the (colonial) metropolis, where local, ‘indigenous’ knowledge entered a complicated yet productive relationship with that of the colonizers.Footnote 6 ‘Religion’ was indeed a novel comparative category applied to ‘non-Western’ subjects, yet it is crucial to bear in mind that the category was not a ready-made ‘Western’ export but hotly contested in ‘the West,’ as well. Its unstable meanings were continuously conditioned and structured by global exchanges. Indians played a decisive role in the process, partaking in the construction of the still-debated category ‘Hinduism’ and its relation to other ‘religions.’Footnote 7 This category is certainly a ‘modern’ one, but it was not simply Western. Brian Pennington has underlined the participation of Indians on its negotiation and highlighted how misleading it would be to separate Hindu groups into either ‘reformers’ or ‘orthodox,’ since this ‘has for too long obscured the modern character of emerging Hindu organizations; their mutually shared goals, interests and strategies; and their common passion for preserving and embodying the ancient past.’Footnote 8 The respective historical debates should not be viewed in simplistic terms of a clash between local tradition and Western (scientific) modernity, but within the framework of a globally entangled emergence and development of comparative religion and religious studies. Indeed, J. Barton Scott has pleaded for situating ‘Hindu reformism as part of the cultural history of the study of religion in the nineteenth century,’ highlighting the decisive role played by one of the most famous Indian reform movements in the emergence of comparative religion: the Bengali Brahmo Samaj, which will also be of primary concern in this present paper.Footnote 9\n\nExpanding on these insights, I am going to illustrate a combination of religious studies and global history approaches in order to shed more light on historical debates about the meanings of ‘religion’ and ‘science,’ which were tied into contemporary debates about the supposed origin of ‘Aryan’ civilization in India. My analysis is based on an exploration of three interrelated authors who shaped a global discourse on Indian religion, its relationship to ‘the West,’ and the academic disciplines devoted to the study of religion: the Bengali Tantric pandit Shivachandra Bhattacharya Vidyarnava (1860–1913), his Bengali disciple, philosopher and nationalist educator, Pramathanath Mukhopadhyay (1880–1973) and Shivachandra’s British disciple, the judge Sir John Woodroffe (1865–1936), who worked in Kolkata (then Calcutta) from 1890 until 1922. These three individuals are connected through ‘Arthur Avalon,’ a pseudonym long believed to represent Woodroffe only but that actually stood for a collaboration between learned South Asians, mainly Bengalis, who sought to present Tantra as the ‘esoteric’ core, not only of ‘true dharma’ but also of a universal religion of humanity.Footnote 10 The editions, translations and studies published by the Avalon team transformed scholarly and popular perceptions of Tantra, almost single-handedly established its serious academic study, and still serve as an inspiration for researchers and practitioners alike.\n\nShivachandra’s magnum opus, Tantratattva (1893), was among the first and most prominent productions of the Avalon team, translated as Principles of Tantra in 1914/16. For our concerns, the work is especially instructive because it allows for insights into the dynamics between local traditions, rivalries and the manifold global connections linked to them through the colonial context. On one hand, Shivachandra engaged critically with Bengali Vaishnava traditions and Vedantic philosophy; on the other hand, he denounced English education and the reform movements allegedly corrupted by it, most importantly, the members of the Brahmo Samaj—who at the time were widely associated with ‘Vedanta’—and the members of the Arya Samaj, who were major competitors in the quarrels about the meaning of ‘Aryan dharma.’ Shivachandra’s polemics largely revolved around the notions of philosophy (Bengali darśan) and science (vijñān), which were dismissed in favour of Tantric ritual practice (sādhan), which Shivachandra presented as thoroughly scientific and experiential.Footnote 11\n\nShivachandra’s follower Pramathanath, in turn, is instructive of the complexity of Bengali (and other Indian) engagements with global debates about philosophy and science. After obtaining an M.A. in philosophy, he joined in the ‘nationalist resurgence’ and ‘dedicated himself to the service of the motherland,’ in the words of his later followers.Footnote 12 He became a professor at the National Council of Education, where Aurobindo Ghosh was among his colleagues. He later joined the Ripon College, teaching philosophy, mathematics and physics. Hence, he stood at the heart of the controversial issues of education and science, which became an integral part of the anti-colonial Swadeshi movement at the beginning of the twentieth century. Rather than simply accepting ‘Western’ scientific frameworks and language, Pramathanath developed a highly creative philosophical-scientific system of thought that heavily drew from local traditions, especially from the sphere of Tantric Shaktism (i.e., those traditions focusing on Shakti as a manifestation of the Goddess).\n\nThis illustrates how the Avalon project was not driven by the leadership or ‘Western perspective’ of Woodroffe. Indeed, shifting the focus on the participants and collaborators on that project from its supposed ‘Western’ mastermind to a diverse group of individuals and their local contexts opens new ways of looking at the contested issue of knowledge production under colonialism. Similar to his Indian partners, Woodroffe’s major concern with notions of science, religion and ‘national education’ was rooted in the idea that modern materialist science only superficially approached an ancient ‘Aryan’ wisdom long lost and forgotten. The revival of that wisdom would not only elevate India from its subordinate role but also lead the way to a new stage in the development of humanity as a whole. Crucially, these ideas were not a ‘Western’ orientalist projection but the outcome of (mostly) Bengali discourses that were mirrored by both the writings of Avalon and Woodroffe.\n\nThe world-wide impact and emergence of this collaboration allow for demonstrating the methodological usefulness and historical substance of ‘entanglements’ between local and global contexts, of which our three authors are representatives: Shivachandra as a self-proclaimed ‘orthodox’ pandit educated in a specific Bengali tradition of Sanskritic Brahmanical learning; Pramathanath as an influential anti-colonial educator synthesizing Tantric (Shakta) and European philosophy, and Woodroffe as a prominent member of the colonial administration at the High Court of Kolkata. Two institutional contexts, to which all three actors were connected, will further illuminate the local and global networks through which these exchanges emerged and unfolded: first, self-referentially ‘orthodox’ societies that proclaimed rivaling understandings of dharma (often translated as ‘religion’), and second, the Theosophical Society. These examples will highlight the historiographical complications arising from strict distinctions between ‘modernity’ and ‘tradition,’ but also between binary cultural models such as ‘East and West’ or ‘Hindu and non-Hindu.’ My analysis will focus on how religion was contested and constantly renegotiated within globally entangled debates that related ‘it’ to issues such as science, education and national identity under colonialism."
