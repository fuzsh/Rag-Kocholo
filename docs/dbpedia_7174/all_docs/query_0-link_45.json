        "text": "BRAHMA University(TM) is a global community campus for revolutionary research and actions based on Brahma Dharma and its affiliated knowledge disciplines.\n\nIt has always been known for the quality of its academics and its distinguished alumni includes\n\nBrahmacharya Prafulla Chandra Roy,\n\nBrahmacharya Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar,\n\nBrahmacharya Jagadish Chandra Bose,\n\nBrahmacharya SN Bose,\n\nBrahmacharya Meghnad Saha,\n\nBrahmacharya Rabindranath Tagore\n\nBrahmacharya Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis\n\nBrahmacharya Aghorenath Chattopadhyaya\n\nBrahmacharya Amiya Charan Banerjee\n\nBrahmacharya Nikhil Chakravarty\n\nBrahmacharni Suhasini Chattopadhyay\n\nBrahmacharya Sri Aurobindo\n\nBrahmacharni Kadambini Ganguly\n\nBrahmacharya Dwarkanath Ganguly\n\nBrahmacharya Virendranath Chattopadhyaya\n\nThe Brahma University originated from a dispute arising from the theological Vedantic College (estd. 1817 at Calcutta), founded by Rammohun Roy's Brahma Sabha to counter William Carey's aggressive Christian evangelical missionaries based at the Danish enclave of Serampore. However, Carey conspired with orthodox Hindus of Calcutta to compel Rammohun Roy to disassociate himself so that college became the Hindu College.\n\nAfter this episode and by 1823, Roy had realised that the East India Company wanted to deny the Brahmas access to Western scientific and military knowledge. By his letter to the Governor General Lord Amherst, Roy demanded that the Company funds of 1 lakh rupees allocated for educating natives be used for advanced instruction in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry in the English language for Brahma youth, instead of publishing philologies in dead Sanskrit which were useless to them.\n\nWhen Lord Amherst (perhaps recalling the devastating Mysore rockets of Tipu Sultan) deliberately did not act on Roy's letter seeking modern scientific instructions for Brahmas, Rammohun Roy constructed the small but handsome' Hindu Vedanta Sanskrit College by 1825 at Calcutta and personally employed 2 of Tipu's French instructors from the Jacobin Club to teach the latest Western sciences of mathematics, physics and chemistry used for rocketry and explosive warfare to about 70 carefully chosen Brahma youth which were translated into a secret Sanskrit dialect known only to true Brahmas. 5 years later a Biology section was added where animal dissections were carried out by Brahmas and poisons were also developed and tested.\n\nIn February 1827, alarmed by Brahmic martial activities, King Frederick of Denmark granted Carey's Fredericksnagore (now Serampore) settlement missionaries a Royal Charter to establish a theological college to aggressively spread Christianity throughout Hindustan. However, the Serampore missionaries were externed from Hindustan on Roy's campaigning and retreated back to their Danish enclave, and did not utilise their Royal Charter till 1914.\n\nIn response to the Serampore Christian missionaries activity to circumvent their externment, Hindustan's reigning Emperor Akbar II thereafter granted Roy extraordinary ambassadorial titles along with an Imperial Charter to establish an University for Brahmic research to award academic degrees throughout 'Hindoostan' on 11 September 1829, thus making it the second oldest University of modern India and the first to issue degrees. The Imperial charter was conveyed to the Governor-General for India Lord William Bentinck on 3rd January 1830 and confirmed by the Company's government shortly thereafter.\n\nWith the Imperial Charter and approvals granted by Emperor Akbar II to his ambassador plenipoteniary Rajah Rammohun Roy in hand, the instruction of the Brahma University formally commenced on 23rd January 1830 at Calcutta at its new premises under the able ministry of noted Sanskrit scholar Pandit Ram Chandra Vidyabagish in the presence of 500 noted Brahmins of Bengal, an Englishman Montgomery Martin and a learned Unitarian Scotsman, Professor William Adam who later headed the Oriental Literature College at Harvard University (USA), and who had previously resigned his post at the Serampore Trinitarian University over doctrinal differences.\n\nSince 1830 Brahma Dharma University has been continually infusing the youth of Hindustan with high moral, religious and scientific temper via hathayoga and other martial exercises accompanied by advanced military training at well equipped Brahmic academies for higher studies.\n\nAfter the untimely death of Rammohun Roy in 1833 in England, the University languished for several years till it was revived by his spiritual successor Maharshi Debendranath Tagore. After vigorous research, which involved sending 4 Brahmunical scholars to Benares (Varanasi) to verify the Vedic texts then in circulation, the doctrine of Vedantic infallabiity was discarded and the Brahmic religion's authoritative text book \"Brahma Dharma\" was adopted in its place. Accordingly, Brahma Dharma University (BDU) was again vigorously revived from 1854 onwards at Shantiniketan (Bengal) by the Tattwabodhini Sabha then headed by Maharshi Debendranath Thakura to infuse divine martial spirits into the indolent Bengali Brahmin youth of Hindustan, to rouse and equip them to wage armed warfare against their better armed foreign imperialist occupation foes and to violently exterminate their Christian missionaries vanguard from India.\n\nOther founding members of the Brahma University included\n\nShridhar Bhattacharya,\n\nShyamacharan Bhattacharya,\n\nBrajendranath Thakura,\n\nGirindranath Thakura,\n\nAnandachandra Bhattacharya,\n\nIshwar Chandra (Vidyasagar) Bhattacharya\n\nTaraknath Bhattacharya,\n\nHaradev Chattopadhyaya,\n\nShyamacharan Mukhopadhyaya,\n\nRamnarayan Chattopadhyaya,\n\nSashibhushan Mukhopadhyaya, etc."
