Established by the Government of Bengal in July 1939 and named after the wife of Lord Brabourne, the Governor of Bengal till February 1939, the college made a humble beginning with 35 Muslim students and 9 faculty members in a rented house in Park Circus. The foundation stone of the building in which it is presently housed was laid on 26th August 1939 by Sir J. Woodhead the then Governor of Bengal. Ever since the college has expanded structurally and academically earning the reputation of having an excellent academic environment.\n\nFrom The Principal's Desk\n\nOur college was founded in 1939 with quite a noble mission of educating and enriching poor Muslim girls, enlightening and emancipating them. Gradually it has emerged as a multi-cultural institute for students from varied backgrounds. It has in the mean time put on a number of feathers on its hat.\n\nI wholeheartedly believe that two most important factors behind the all-round development and success of this College are:\n\n(a) a long tradition of a very strict discipline and\n\n(b) a total absence of any kind of external interference. This is probably reflected in the consistently brilliant academic performance of our students both during and after their College days.\n\nOur College has now completed 80 glorious years. I am quite certain, you will all extend your good wishes to make this journey much smoother, to make our College more beautiful in every respect and to help our College reach its zenith.\n\nPRINCIPAL\n\nProfessor Siuli Sarkar,\n\nM.A., Ph.D (Calcutta University)\n\nAdmission 2024-25\n\nVIDEO GUIDE FOR CENTRALISED ONLINE ADMISSION PORTAL\n\nThe centralised portal - https://wbcap.in\n\nApplication to maximum 25 courses\n\nRegistration modification & cancellation\n\nCALL FOR PAPERS FOR IQAC JOURNAL OF HUMANITIES 2024\n\nIQAC Lady Brabourne College intends to publish a new volume of ISSN Journal of Humanities in 2024.
