This day is dedicated to honoring the achievements of women diplomats, acknowledging their resilience in overcoming challenges, and promoting gender equality within the diplomatic sphere. Since 2014, 16 countries have either adopted or committed to adopting Feminist Foreign Policies. However, a lot more needs to be done in prioritizing feminism in feminist foreign policies. While some have chosen to continue dispensing aid, some chose to add women and stir. Instead of choosing to engage with feminist values and focusing on intersectionality and peace, these policies continued to normalize “feminism-lite” agendas. In reality, women and non-binary people in the global south have been “doing” feminist foreign policy for generations now. Movements ranging from resisting colonialism to practicing food sovereignty, from inclusive law-making to deploying international law in pushing for their rights – the wealth of knowledge embodied in praxis in the majority world must be cantered.\n\nThis symposium recognizes these gaps and takes a deep dive into the field to build strong understandings of Feminist Foreign Policy as a concept. It offers a comprehensive overview of feminist foreign policies as they exist, presents the building blocks of such policies, and presents lessons from rich examples from the majority world. This provides an opportunity to critically interrogate the adoption of feminist and pro-gender foreign policies and diplomatic practices by a growing number of states and organizations, sparking both political debate and scholarly engagement. It offers a platform for the conduct of advanced in-depth reflection and analysis of this development through a range of conceptual and theoretical debates.\n\nUndergirding the symposium is the broad question of what it means to conduct feminist and/or pro-gender foreign policy and diplomacy. How do they differ from orthodox foreign policy and diplomatic approaches? How should they be conceptualized and analyzed? Addressing these questions, the symposium will serve as platform and foundation for further in depth-deliberations and policy interventions.\n\nFor Whom\n\nThe symposium will be beneficial for international relations academicians, scholars, and students; diplomats, diplomatic organizations, and institutions; journalists, media personnel;\n\nearly career professionals and anyone interested in feminism, global politics, and the intersection of the two.\n\nBenefits\n\nThe symposium will provide participants with the tools – international legal framework, diplomatic “hard” and “soft” power, advocacy methods – to promote and defend women’s\n\nrights today, directly linked to current events and with strong testimonies from different types of actors on the field (officials, civil society activists, representatives of international\n\norganizations, private and philanthropic sectors).\n\nUpon successful completion of the program, each participant will receive a Certificate of Completion, contingent upon their attendance being logged on Zoom for all three days.\n\nPurpose and Impact\n\nTo provide a platform for insightful discussions and critical reflections on the role of feminist principles in shaping international relations and diplomacy.\n\nRaising awareness about the importance of gender equality within the field of diplomacy that would generate structures and systems for creating an enabling ecosystem for meaningful and proactive participation of women in diplomatic decision making.\n\nLead to the formulation of recommendations and evidence based policy suggestions for integrating feminist principles into foreign policy.\n\nTo facilitate cross-cultural dialogue, collaboration, and the sharing of best practices, fostering global and regional networks committed to advancing feminist values in foreign policy.\n\nTo dispel misconceptions about feminist foreign policy and provide a nuanced understanding of its potential impact on diplomatic relations.\n\nProgram Experts\n\nChair: Prof Vibhuti Patel, Visiting Distinguished Professor IMPRI, former professor, at Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai\n\nExperts:\n\nMs Stephenie Foster, Partner, Smash Strategies ; Co-Author, Feminist Foreign Policy in Theory and Practice\n\nProf Sanjukta Bhattacharya, Retired Professor, International Relations, Jadavpur University, Kolkata; Visiting Professor, IMPRI\n\nAmbassador Latha Reddy, (IFS, Retd.)
