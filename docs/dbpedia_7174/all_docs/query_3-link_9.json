        "text": "The Linguistics Program:\n\nProgram website: https://slavic.columbia.edu/content/linguistics\n\nDirector of Undergraduate Studies: Meredith Landman (meredith.landman@columbia.edu)\n\nUndergraduate Administrator: John Lacqua (jl808@columbia.edu)\n\nThe Study of Linguistics\n\nIn any discussion of linguistics, in popular or academic contexts, the first question is always, what is linguistics, after all? This is remarkable. Language informs most of our mental and cultural activity, and linguistics is just the study of language.\n\nThe significance of linguistics in the context of the liberal arts education is twofold. On the one hand, linguistics is a highly developed field of knowledge whose achievements, challenges, and problems constitute an integral part of the modern world of ideas. On the other, understanding the inner properties of language as a complex mechanism and awareness of the extensive tools of its description developed by linguistics provides a crucial background for a variety of disciplines whose subject involves language, such as analytical philosophy, anthropology, folklore, sociology, psychology, computer science, archeology, classic philology, and literary theory.\n\nOur programs of study are designed to acquaint students with the theoretical ideas, conceptual apparatus, and research techniques involved in the study of language in all its variety and uses.\n\nStudent Advising\n\nConsulting Advisers\n\nStudents with questions regarding the Linguistics Program should contact the Linguistics DUS, Meredith Landman (meredith.landman@columbia.edu).\n\nProspective majors or minors should contact the Linguistics DUS as early as possible for advice on progressing through our programs of study.\n\nStudents are encouraged to join the Linguistics undergraduate listserv, on which we advertise open houses, colloquia, and other events hosted by our program, as well as internship, summer school, and job opportunities. To join our listserv, please email Meredith Landman (meredith.landman@columbia.edu).\n\nEnrolling in Classes\n\nStudents who are waitlisted for a course should email the course instructor.\n\nPreparing for Graduate Study\n\nColumbia’s linguists have distinguished themselves with awards and plans after graduation, such as Fulbright Fellowships in Germany, Georgia, and Taiwan, graduate study at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, and CUNY Graduate Center. Linguistics is also a natural background for studying law, and our students have entered such law schools as Harvard, UCLA, and NYU.\n\nStudents interested in pursuing a graduate program in linguistics should consult the Linguistics DUS for advice.\n\nCoursework Taken Outside of Columbia\n\nTransfer Courses\n\nStudents may be awarded at most three transfer or study abroad courses toward the major and at most one toward the minor, on a case-by-case basis, with approval from the Linguistics DUS. A syllabus for the courses in question will be required for approval.\n\nStudy Abroad Courses\n\nUndergraduates have engaged in unique travel and research projects, including sign language in Nicaragua; language attitudes in Kyrgyzstan; colloquial Arabic in Cairo; summer internship at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology; and study abroad in Spain, England, India, Hungary, and Ireland.\n\nStudents may be awarded at most three transfer or study abroad courses toward the major and at most one toward the minor, on a case-by-case basis, with approval from the Linguistics DUS. A syllabus for the courses in question will be required for approval.\n\nCore Curriculum Connections\n\nThe Linguistics Program offers the Global Core course LING 3102: Endangered Languages in the Global City each fall.\n\nUndergraduate Research and Senior Thesis\n\nSenior Thesis Coursework and Requirements\n\nA senior thesis is required for the linguistics major. Linguistics majors must complete two semesters of the senior thesis seminar in the fall and spring of their senior year.\n\nDepartment Honors and Prizes\n\nDepartment Honors\n\nDepartment honors are awarded to at most 10 percent of the graduating cohort. Students must be in good standing (a GPA of at least 3.6) to be considered for department honors.\n\nGuidance for Undergraduate Students in the Department\n\nProgram Planning for all Students\n\nStudents with questions regarding the Linguistics Program should contact the Linguistics DUS, Meredith Landman (meredith.landman@columbia.edu).\n\nProspective majors or minors should contact the Linguistics DUS as early as possible for advice on progressing through our programs of study.\n\nStudents are encouraged to join the Linguistics undergraduate listserv, on which we advertise open houses, colloquia, and other events hosted by our program, as well as internship, summer school, and job opportunities. To join our listserv, please email Meredith Landman (meredith.landman@columbia.edu).\n\nGuidance for First-Year Students\n\nFirst-year students should enroll in LING 3101: Introduction to Linguistics in the fall of their first year and contact the Linguistics DUS for further advice on progressing through our programs of study.\n\nGuidance for Transfer Students\n\nTransfer students should contact the Linguistics DUS as early as possible for advice on progressing through our programs of study.\n\nUndergraduate Programs of Study\n\nMajor in Linguistics\n\nLinguistics, especially since the 1960s, has become a highly multifarious and interdisciplinary field of inquiry. This requires that a major acquaint students with a number of subfields, all of which are crucial to understanding what modern linguistic analysis is about (and foster interdisciplinary inquiry as well). To wit, the person with a basic foundation in what constitutes linguistic study in our times, including training for graduate study if desired, understands:\n\na) the basics of grammatical analysis in terms of sounds and sentence structure\n\nb) how languages change over time\n\nc) the mechanics of how languages express meaning and implication\n\nd) the details and nuances of how language is used in social space\n\ne) the ways and extent to which the world's 7000 languages differ from one another\n\nf) the relationship between language and cognition writ large\n\nTo this end, the major requirements – totaling 38 points – are as follows:\n\n1. LING UN3101 INTRODUCTION TO LINGUISTICS (3pts.)\n\n2. LING GU4376 PHONETICS ＆ PHONOLOGY (3pts.)\n\n3. LING GU4903 SYNTAX (3pts.)\n\n4. One course from four out of five themes (12 pts. total):\n\na) Language in time\n\nContent: Historical linguistics, as in how grammars transform over time (such as the development of Modern from Old English) in terms of sounds, structures, and meaning\n\nLING GU4108 LANGUAGE HISTORY\n\nENGL GU4901 HISTORY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE\n\nCHNS GU4019 HISTORY OF CHINESE LANGUAGE\n\nb) Language in context\n\nContent: How language varies in structure and usage according to sociological factors such as gender, class, race, power and culture\n\nLING GU4800 LANGUAGE ＆ SOCIETY\n\nLING UN3102 Endangered Languages in the Global City: Lang, Culture, and Migration in Contempary NYC\n\nANTH UN1009 INTRO TO LANGUAGE ＆ CULTURE\n\nANTH GR6067 Language and Its Limits (graduate seminar open to undergraduates)\n\nAMST UN3931 Topics in American Studies (Languages of America)\n\nAMST UN3931 Topics in American Studies (Language Contact)\n\nSPAN GU4010 LANGUAGE CROSSING IN LATINX CARIBBEAN CULTURAL PRODUCTION\n\nSPAN BC3382 SOCIOLING ASPECTS U.S.SPANISH (taught in Spanish)\n\nPORT GU4033 Language ＆ Queer Brazil (ENG)\n\nc) Language diversity\n\nContent: How languages differ from one another and in which ways; especially valuable in this module are a) Field Methods, eliciting the vocabulary and structure of a lesser documented language by questioning a native speaker, in the fashion of professional linguists, b) courses focusing on the structure of individual languages\n\nLING GU4120 LANG DOCUMENTATION/FIELD MTHDS\n\nLING GU4171 LANGUAGES OF AFRICA\n\nHNGR UN3343 Descriptive Grammar Hungarian\n\nd) Language and meaning\n\nContent: semantics, philosophy of language, cognitive linguistics, natural language processing\n\nLING GU4190 DISCOURSE ANALYSIS\n\nPHIL UN2685 INTRO TO PHIL OF LANGUAGE\n\nSPAN GU4011 CONVERSATION IN SPANISH:PRACTICE AND ANA\n\nSPAN GR5450 A COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS ACCOUNT OF LANGUAGE\n\nSPAN GU4030 Spanish Pragmatics (taught in Spanish\n\ne) Psychology and biology of language\n\nContent: psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, language genesis. This is especially important given the burgeoning research on the actual structural representation of language in the brain, as well as increasingly influential proposals that ground language in larger thought processes (as opposed to the Chomskyan proposal that language is, to a considerable extent, generated via exclusive cognitive mechanisms).\n\nLING UN3103 Language, Brain and Mind\n\nPSYC BC3164 PERCEPTION AND LANGUAGE\n\nPSYC GU4232 Production and Perception of Language\n\nPSYC BC3369 Language Development\n\nPSYC GU4242 Evolution of Language (seminar) (graduate seminar open to undergraduates)\n\nPSYC GU4244 LANGUAGE AND MIND\n\nPSYC GU4272 Advanced Seminar in Language Development\n\nPSYC GU4470 PSYCH ＆ NEUROPSYCH OF LANGUAGE\n\n5. One elective course (3 pts.) from a) one of the themes above or b) a linguistics-related course from another department subject to approval from the program. This allows students to either sample more widely or specialize somewhat in a subarea of linguistics that has come to interest them. Pre-approved (non-theme) elective courses for the major are as follows:\n\nAnthropology\n\nANTH UN3947: Text, Magic, Performance\n\nCognitive Science\n\nCOGSCI UN1001: Introduction to Cognitive Science\n\nComputer Science\n\nCOMS W1002: Computing in Context: Computing in Linguistics\n\nCOMS W4705: Natural Language Processing\n\nCOMS W4995: Topics in Computer Science (with approval)\n\nCOMS E6998: Topics in Computer Science (with approval)\n\nEast Asian Languages and Cultures\n\nCPLS GU4111: World Philology\n\nEAAS GU4412: History of Writing in a Cosmopolitan East Asia\n\nPhilosophy\n\nPHIL UN3411: Symbolic Logic\n\n6. Senior thesis (two semesters, 3 pts. per semester)\n\n7. Language requirement: Two semesters of an intermediate-level language sequence (8 points). The language must differ from that used to fulfill the core foreign language requirement. The language taken can be ancient (e.g., Latin, Sanskrit, or Ancient Greek) or modern but should neither be the student’s native or semi-native language nor belong to one of the major groups of modern European languages (i.e., neither Romance nor Germanic—thus, not French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Catalan, German, or Dutch). Students must actually take the courses in question; testing out of the linguistics language requirement is not allowed.\n\nMinor in Linguistics\n\nThe linguistics minor is designed to acquaint students with a scientific approach to language in all of its variety and uses. The minor draws students from diverse disciplines and career paths who share a common interest in language. Linguistic training can be particularly valuable for students majoring in language-related fields such as those in the cognitive sciences (computer science, philosophy, anthropology, psychology, neuroscience, music), language studies, and human rights. A background in linguistics can also be an asset for students pursuing careers in law, language technologies, education, publishing, or speech and hearing sciences. Many of our students are drawn to the field because they are speakers—or advocates for speakers—of smaller or endangered languages, and they want to learn how to document and describe such languages or help develop and advance technologies for them.\n\nOur program offers students the flexibility to tailor the minor to their specific needs and interests. Students may choose courses that will enhance their primary area of study, or they may explore linguistics as a secondary field of study independent of their major.\n\nThe minor in linguistics consists of five courses (16 points):\n\n1) Three courses in linguistics (i.e., offered in the Linguistics Program). The choice of courses will depend on the student’s interests. We strongly recommend—but do not require—that students begin the minor with Ling UN3101: Introduction to Linguistics.\n\nOur current course offerings are as follows, organized by subarea:\n\na) Language structure: The basics of linguistic analysis\n\nLING UN3101: Introduction to Linguistics\n\nLING GU4376: Phonetics & Phonology\n\nLING GU4903: Syntax\n\nLING GU4XXX: Semantics & Pragmatics (new course to be offered in Spring 2025)\n\nb) Language and society: How language is used in social space\n\nAMST UN3990: Topics in American Studies: Language Contact OR Languages of America\n\nLING UN3102: Endangered Languages in NYC\n\nLING GU4800: Language & Society\n\nc) Language and cognition: the role of language in cognition\n\nLING UN3103: Language, Brain & Mind\n\nd) Language diversity: the ways and extent to which the world’s 7000 languages vary\n\nHNGR UN3343: Hungarian Descriptive Grammar\n\nLING GU4120: Language Documentation & Field Methods\n\nLING GU4171: Languages of Africa\n\nLING GU4174: Languages of Asia\n\nLING GU4022: Word & Grammar\n\ne) Language change: how languages change over time\n\nENGL GU4901: History of the English Language\n\nLING GU4108: Language History\n\n2) One elective course, either a) in linguistics from the list above or b) in a related field, chosen with approval from the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Pre-approved elective courses for the minor are as follows:\n\nAnthropology\n\nANTH UN1009: Introduction to Language and Culture\n\nANTH UN3947: Text, Magic, Performance\n\nANTH GR6067: Language and Its Limits (graduate seminar open to undergraduates)\n\nCognitive Science\n\nCOGSCI UN1001: Introduction to Cognitive Science\n\nComputer Science\n\nCOMS W1002: Computing in Context: Computing in Linguistics\n\nCOMS W4705: Natural Language Processing\n\nCOMS W4995: Topics in Computer Science (with approval)\n\nCOMS E6998: Topics in Computer Science (with approval)\n\nEast Asian Languages and Cultures\n\nCHNS GU4019: History of Chinese Language\n\nCPLS GU4111: World Philology\n\nEAAS GU4412: History of Writing in a Cosmopolitan East Asia\n\nLatin American and Iberian Cultures\n\nSPAN BC3382: Sociolinguistic Aspects of US Spanish\n\nSPAN GU4010: Language Crossing in Latinx Caribbean Cultural Production\n\nSPAN GU4030: Spanish Pragmatics (taught in Spanish)\n\nSPAN GF5450: Mind and Body in Space: A Cognitive Linguistics Account of Language\n\nPhilosophy\n\nPHIL UN2685: Introduction to the Philosophy of Language\n\nPHIL UN3685: Philosophy of Language\n\nPHIL UN3411: Symbolic Logic\n\nPHIL GR9525: Topics in the Philosophy of Language (graduate seminar open to undergraduates)\n\nPsychology\n\nPSYC BC3164: Perception & Language\n\nPSYC BC3369: Language Development\n\nPSYC UN3450: Evolution of Intelligence, Animal Communication & Language\n\nPSYC GU4232: Production & Perception of Language\n\nPSYC GU4244: Language & Mind\n\nPSYC GU4272: Advanced Seminar in Language Development\n\nPSYC GU4470: Psychology and Neuropsychology of Language\n\n3) One language course at the intermediate level (i.e., equivalent to the third semester or beyond) (4 points). The language may be the same as that used to fulfill the core foreign language requirement. The language taken can be ancient (e.g., Latin, Sanskrit, or Ancient Greek) or modern but should neither be the student’s native or semi-native language nor belong to one of the major groups of modern European languages (i.e., neither Romance nor Germanic—thus, not French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Catalan, German, or Dutch). Students must actually take the course in question; testing out of the linguistics language requirement is not allowed.\n\nFor students who entered Columbia in or before Fall 2023\n\nSpecial Concentration in Linguistics\n\nThe special concentration in linguistics is not sufficient for graduation in and of itself. It must be taken in conjunction with a major or a full concentration in another discipline.\n\nPlease note: the requirements for the special concentration in Linguistics were modified in the Fall 2019 semester. Students who entered Columbia before the Fall 2019 semester have the option of following the new or the old requirements. If you have any questions, please contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies.\n\nFor the new requirements, students must take 23 points in the linguistics program as specified below.\n\nFor the old requirements, students must take 18 points; the requirements are specified below, with the exception that the language requirement is one language course at the intermediate level (4pts.), separate from the core curriculum foreign language requirement.\n\nThe requirements for the special concentration (23 points) are as follows:\n\n1. Three core courses in linguistics chosen from:\n\nLING UN3101 INTRODUCTION TO LINGUISTICS\n\nLING UN3102 Endangered Languages in the Global City: Lang, Culture, and Migration in Contempary NYC\n\nLING UN3103 Language, Brain and Mind\n\nHNGR UN3343 Descriptive Grammar Hungarian\n\nLING GU4108 LANGUAGE HISTORY\n\nLING GU4120 LANG DOCUMENTATION/FIELD MTHDS\n\nLING GU4171 LANGUAGES OF AFRICA\n\nLING GU4190 DISCOURSE ANALYSIS\n\nLING GU4376 PHONETICS ＆ PHONOLOGY\n\nLING GU4800 LANGUAGE ＆ SOCIETY\n\nLING GU4903 SYNTAX\n\n2.
