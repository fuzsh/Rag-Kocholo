        "text": "Programme Outcome (PO) of Botany Honours CBCS),University of Calcutta\n\nOver the years, Botany has shown enormous gain in information and applications owing to tremendous inputs from research in all its aspects. With global recognition of the need for conservation, field plant biologists have contributed significantly in assessing plant diversity. Taxonomists have explored newer dimensions for the classification of plants. New insights have been gained in functional and structural aspects of plant development by utilizing novel tools and techniques for botanical research. Challenging areas of teaching and research have emerged in ecology and reproductive biology. Concern for ever increasing pollution and climate change is at its highest than ever before. Today plant science is a fusion of the traditional components with the modern aspects of biochemistry, molecular biology and biotechnology. Keeping these advancements in view, a revision of the curriculum at the undergraduate level is perfectly timed. The carefully-crafted course structure has taken care of different aspects of plant science, namely plant diversity, physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, reproduction, anatomy, taxonomy, ecology, economic botany and the impact of the environment on the growth and development of plants. All these aspects have been given due weightage over the six semesters. It is essential for the undergraduate students to acquaint themselves with various tools and techniques for exploring the world of plants up to the sub- cellular level. A paper on this aspect is proposed to provide such an opportunity to the students before they engage themselves with the learning of modern tools and techniques in plant science. Keeping the employment entrepreneurship in mind, applied courses have also been introduced. These courses shall provide the botany students hands on experience and professional inputs. On the whole, the curriculum is a source of a lot of information and is supported by rich resource materials. It is believed that a student graduating in Botany with the new CBCS curriculum will be a complete botanist at Honours level.\n\nProgramme Specific Outcomes include\n\nKnowledge and understanding of:\n\n1. The range of plant diversity in terms of structure, function and environmental relationships. 2. The evaluation of plant diversity. 3. Plant classification and the flora of West Bengal. 4. The role of plants in the functioning of the global ecosystem. 5. A selection of more specialized, optional topics. 6. Statistics as applied to biological data\n\nIntellectual skills – Able to:\n\n1. Think logically and organize tasks into a structured form.2. Assimilate knowledge and ideas based on wide reading and through the internet. 3. Transfer of appropriate knowledge and methods from one topic to another within the subject. 4. Understand the evolving state of knowledge in a rapidly developing field. 5. Construct and test hypothesis. 6. Plan, conduct and write a report on an independent term project.\n\nPractical skills:\n\nStudents learn to carry out practical work, in the field and in the laboratory, with minimal risk. They gain introductory experience in applying each of the following skills and gain greater proficiency in a selection of them depending on their choice of optional modules. 1. Interpreting plant morphology and anatomy. 2. Plant identification. 3. Vegetation analysis techniques. 4. A range of physiochemical analyses of plant materials in the context of plant physiology and\n\nbiochemistry.\n\n5. Analyze data using appropriate statistical methods and computer packages. 6.
