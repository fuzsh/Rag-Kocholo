        "text": "Mysore is home to one of the oldest Sanskrit colleges, the Maharaja’s Sanskrit College, renowned for its dedication to imparting knowledge of Vedas, Agamas, and Shastras. Established by Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar III, the college has been a custodian of Sanatana Dharma, playing a pivotal role in the preservation of India’s ancient language, Sanskrit.\n\nReports indicate that the college’s inception dates back to 1876 when Maharaja Chamaraja Wodeyar, successor to Krishnaraja Wodeyar III, formally inaugurated the Sanskrit school. Initially conceived by Krishnaraja Wodeyar III, the college has been instrumental in upholding the foundations of Sanatana Dharma.\n\nUnder government administration today, Maharaja’s Sanskrit College offers equal opportunities for individuals from all communities, including women, to delve into the profound realms of Sanskrit learning. The courses, rooted in traditional teaching methods, cover Veda, Agama, and Shastra, with the college boasting one of the oldest collections of Sanskrit manuscripts on its campus.\n\nThe diverse courses offered range from two to thirteen years, with an entry age requirement of eight years. Noteworthy programs include Sanskrit Prathama, Kavya, Sahithya, Vyakarana, Nyaya, Meemaamsa, Dharma Sastra, Vishistadwaita, Shakti Vishistadwaita, Adwaita, Alankara, Vidwat Madhyama, Vidwat Uthama, Rigveda, Shukla Yajurveda, Krishna Yajurveda, Sama Veda, Jaina Shaivagama, Vaikhasana Agama, Pancharathra Agama, Veerashaivagama, and Jainagama.\n\nReports indicate that the college extends its commitment to education by admitting students without charging any fees, further offering free hostel facilities to those who travel from different regions to pursue their studies.\n\nThe illustrious alumni of Maharaja’s Sanskrit College include eminent figures such as Mysore M. Vasudevacharya, Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, Prof. S. Hiriyanna, Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wodeyar, and Naveenam Venkatesha Sastry. Recognising Sanskrit as India’s ancient language, the college stands as a cultural reservoir, fostering a deeper understanding of Hindu scriptures and continuing its legacy of preserving the rich heritage of Sanskrit wisdom."
