At the beginning of the 20th century, modern system of education was introduced by the British was gaining wider acceptance. On the other hand, the traditional education system was getting weaker and weaker. This caused considerable decrease in the number of students seeking ‘Sastric’ studies. Moreover, there was no well organized institution to impart traditional Sanskrit education. His Highness Sri.
