        "text": "I find it amazing because it is such a critical piece of GL history, but I still run across fans who don’t know the story of Phillip’s parents. This is an effort to clear up any confusion. When the Spaulding family first appeared on Guiding Light in Nov. 1977, Elizabeth and Alan Spaulding had been married for at least 10 years. They had a son named Phillip. This was Alan’s longest marriage, but hardly his most successful. Alan stifled and undercut Elizabeth. She wanted to be a professional photographer, but Alan found her wanting to have a job ridiculous and demanded that his desires and needs come first. During the nasty custody battle as they divorced, it came out that Elizabeth and Alan’s baby had died at birth. He switched the babies with one that had been put up for adoption and Phillip was actually Jackie and Justin Marler’s biological child. Elizabeth never knew before that. Jackie had known from when Phillip was about 7.\n\nElizabeth, Alan, Justin, and Jackie played musical partners. Jackie married Alan (mostly to be near Phillip, but she did get pregnant by Alan during the marriage – later miscarrying) and Justin married Elizabeth. Phillip later recalled that during this time he felt very safe and like he had four parents. Eventually both pairs divorced, Elizabeth moved to Europe (where presumably she still lives) and Jackie and Justin remarried. Elizabeth gave her custody to the Marlers and while Phillip had no idea they were his parents he lived with them when not at boarding school. They had a second child after this reunion, a girl named Samantha. Jackie was killed in a plane crash (although as one hopeful website I saw just last year noted – they haven’t found her body – YET). It was only after Jackie’s death when Phillip was almost 18 that he was told the truth. His reaction was disbelief and anger at all 4 adults who kept the truth with him, but he was especially hit with the bitter realization that he hadn’t attended his own mother’s funeral when he missed Jackie’s.\n\nEventually Phillip accepted his past, but continued to see himself as a Spaulding. Alan too always saw Phillip as his true son, even if he wasn’t biologically. However, his birth parents make Samantha Marler his only full biological sibling. Samantha returned to Springfield as a teen and had a romance with Dylan Lewis. She was, in fact, in the car with Reva before she drove off the unfinished bridge in Florida, but after realizing she couldn’t talk Reva down or otherwise stop the car, she jumped to safety just in time, but was temporarily paralyzed as a result. Phillip once told Danny that he’s sorry he didn’t have more contact with this little sister.\n\nAlan-Michael, the son who Alan always seemed to value less than Phillip, was his biological son. (Personally I think there are more complicated explanations for the distance in his relationship to A-M, see my Alan Spaulding and Hope Bauer post.\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2009/07/21/alan-spauldinghope-bauer) So A-M was Phillip’s adoptive half-brother. The same is true of Gus Aitoro. Unfortunately, this also makes Peyton Spaulding both his adoptive half-sister and as well as his step-daughter (thru his marriage to Beth Raines Spaulding). Lujack and Nick McHenry were his adoptive cousins (their mother was Alexandra Spaulding). His Marler connection also made him Ross’ nephew and he had a close relationship with Ross up until an action of Phillip’s (during his decent into madness) helped cause Ross’ untimely death. Lanie Marler was his biological aunt. Ben Warren is his biological half-uncle (they didn’t get along at all). Dinah, Kevin, Jason, and Clarissa Marler are his biological cousins (thru Ross). This connection also makes Blake both his aunt and his ex-wife, luckily for them the ex-wife part came first.\n\nFor all his faults, and let’s face it Alan had many, he never made an differentiation based on the fact that Phillip and his offspring didn’t really have any Spaulding blood in their veins. In fact, he favored Phillip and Lizzie as preferred off-spring over his biological children and had the closest and most equal relationship with Phillip.\n\nThe episode where Phillip finds out about his parentage:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB208g-E-30 (Part 1)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sBiUJMKL0I&NR=1 (Part 2)\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QI3QuPU0zA&NR=1 (Part 3)\n\nThat line Phillip wrenches out about missing his own mother’s funeral I can still remember from the first time it aired. It really stuck with me all these years and is why they never should have shown that farce of a funeral for Alan. Phillip would never have allowed them to have it without all his children and grandchildren being there after his own long standing regrets about missing Jackie’s. The man who tells Phillip at the beginning is Bradley Raines, Beth’s abusive stepfather and Lillian’s then husband. The only other character mentioned that you might not know is that Phillip asks if Helen knows. Justin dated Helen after Jackie’s death and eventually married her, I don’t think that had happened yet, but I’m not sure. Notice Rick was right there and as always Rick’s first impulse was to help Phillip, but Ed pulls him away. Good for Billy to get everyone else out and notice Mindy’s instinct is also to help Phillip.\n\nRead more details about this switch at Justin, Elizabeth and Phillip’s character profiles below:\n\nhttp://www.soapcentral.com/gl/whoswho/justin.php\n\nhttp://www.soapcentral.com/gl/whoswho/elizabeth.php\n\nhttp://www.soapcentral.com/gl/whoswho/phillip.php\n\nTags: Alan Spaulding, Alan-Michael Spaulding, Alexandra Spaulding, Ben Warren, Beth Raines, Blake Marler, Clarissa Marler, Danny Santos, Dinah Marler, Dylan Lewis, Elizabeth Spaulding, GL, Guiding Light, Gus Aitoro, Hope Bauer, Jackie Marler, Jason Marler, Justin Marler, Kevin Marler, Lanie Marler, Lujack, Nick McHenry, Phillip Spaulding, Reva Shayne Lewis, Ross Marler, Samantha Marler"
