        "text": "(Author's Note: For anyone whos not a longtime viewer of GL, I feel compelled to mention that any information in this chapter concerning Rafes past, including details of any crimes, is based on actual show history and is not a figment of my imagination.)\n\nNatalia had spent the evening growing more and more distressed when there was no sign of her son. Finally shed grabbed the handset and called Daisy. Shed already tried to call Rafe, but either his cell phone was off or he just wasnt answering. Daisy told her shed seen him, and yes, he was upset. She also readily admitted Rafe had told her why, but to Natalias surprise, Daisy seemed sympathetic to her. In fact, she said shed told Rafe that while she didnt know Olivia really well, shed always liked her, and she thought it was great his mom had found true love. Natalia was amazed at Daisys attitude, but then maybe she was more typical of her generation than her son. Unfortunately, Daisy also said Rafe had gotten mad at her and stomped off, and she had no idea where he might be headed.\n\nNatalia briefly considered calling Frank, because she felt fairly certain hed be next on Rafes list, but she just couldnt bring herself to do it. Shed just have to pray her son would come home soon and the two of them would be able to work through all this.\n\n******************************\n\n\"Have a seat,\" Olivia said, motioning toward the couch.\n\n\"I dont want to sit down,\" Rafe said.\n\n\"Well, what do you want then?\" Olivia could tell Rafe was angry. She would have to be an idiot not to notice the menacing scowl on his face. Shed seen him like this before. In fact, it occurred to her this was probably exactly how he looked when hed pointed a gun at Jeffrey.\n\n\"I want you to stay away from my mom,\" Rafe said, his voice increasing in volume with each word.\n\nOlivia gazed at him steadily. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Why? You ... youre ... because its wrong, thats why.\"\n\n\"Rafe, Im not going to try to have a discussion with you about religion. Youll have to talk to someone else about things like that.\"\n\n\"I didnt come here to talk about religion.\"\n\n\"But I will talk with you about your mother,\" Olivia continued. Her eyes flickered over Natalias beloved son. He was wearing baggy khaki shorts, a white baseball jersey, and an aggressive expression. He was a good-looking kid, but in her opinion he was otherwise nothing like his father, whod never had a completely out-of-control temper like his son. I sure hope youre going to your anger management sessions. From the looks of you, Im thinking maybe you should double up on those.\n\n\"I cant believe what youve done to her.\"\n\n\"You mean you cant believe I love her?\"\n\n\"I cant believe youve done something to her to make her think she loves you. How did you do that, anyway?\"\n\nOlivia regarded her angry visitor cooly. \"You should be ashamed of yourself.\"\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"Yes, you! Look at how you treat your mother. She sacrificed everything for you, Rafe, and shes spent her entire life working hard to make sure you had everything you needed. And just look at how you repay her! She tells you shes in love, and you treat her like shes a criminal.\"\n\n\"She shouldnt be with you!\"\n\n\"What the hell business is it of yours who your mother is with? Do you ask her permission before you ask a girl out?\"\n\n\"No, but ...\"\n\n\"I thought you wanted your mother to be happy.\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Well, guess what. Shes happy with me.\"\n\n\"Thats wrong.\"\n\n\"So loving someone is wrong?\"\n\n\"No, but two women together is wrong.\"\n\n\"Your mother struggled with that, but I know she prayed about it till she came to peace with it,\" Olivia said. Shit, Natalia should be the one to tell him about that. \"You know what? Youre incredibly lucky to have such an amazing mother, but it makes me sick to see how you treat her.\"\n\nRafe looked as though he was about to say something, but he didnt. He just stood there glowering.\n\n\"You talk about your religion. Well, Im no expert, but I think somewhere in the Bible it says something about honoring your mother and your father.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but ...\"\n\n\"But what? Only when its convenient for you? Yeah, Im sure that must be what God meant.\" Olivia could feel her temper attempting to break free of its traces and briefly gave thought to trying to rein it back in. Nah, screw it. Im sick of this shit. \"It also says judge not lest ye be judged, but for heavens sake, Rafe, youre one of the most judgmental people Ive ever been around.\"\n\n\"Thats not fair.\"\n\n\"Oh, really? Well, personally I dont think you have room to be judging other people, Rafe.\"\n\n\"Whats that supposed to mean?\"\n\n\"Well, lets see ... you mugged Josh Lewis for money when you first came to town, and you actually cut him with your knife. Then a few days later in juvie you tore a phone off the wall and used it to assault Coop Bradshaw, who was only there to teach some classes. Later you stole candy off a guard, and when he found out, you fought with him and grabbed his gun. Your own father had to stop you that time. And then, as if all that werent enough, you shot the DA and ended up in prison, so who are you to be pointing a finger at anyone else for their behavior? And you especially shouldnt be judging your own mother, who, as you should know, is a near saint.\"\n\n\"Thats not fair!\" Rafe snapped.\n\n\"Oh, really? And not listening to your mother is fair? Not honoring her is fair? Judging her is fair? Not even trying to understand is fair?\"\n\n\"You just want to ruin her life.\"\n\n\"Why the hell would I want to do that? I love her! We fell in love. And yes, we were both surprised and we were both scared at first, but you know what? It is what is it, as your mother would say, and what it is is love.\"\n\n\"Its hard to believe my mom would fall in love with another woman.\"\n\n\"Look, Rafe,\" Olivia said in a softer tone. \"I can understand how youd be shocked. Hell, I was shocked. Your mother was shocked. But you know what? The important thing is we love each other, and were happy together. Id do anything for your mother.\" Olivia watched him for a moment, trying to gauge if anything was penetrating that thick skull of his. \"Havent you ever been in love?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"With Daisy, right?\"\n\nRafe nodded.\n\n\"What if Id come to you and told you I thought that was wrong.\"\n\nRafe frowned. \"Why would you?\"\n\n\"What difference does it make? Youre not giving me a choice about hearing your opinions about who I love. The point is would you have stopped loving her if your mom or I or Daisys family had told you to?\"\n\n\"No, but I dont see what that has to do with this.\"\n\nChrist! Sometimes its hard to believe you came from Gus and Natalia. \"I think maybe the part youre not getting is its not up to you who your mom loves. Like it or hate it, she loves me, Rafe, and I love her. Were happy together. Doesnt that mean anything to you? Dont you want your mother to be happy?\"\n\n\"Of course, I do, just not with you.\"\n\n\"Thats the part thats not up to you. She is happy with me. Now are you going to grow up and show your mom some respect and try to accept her choices, or are you going to make your moms life a living hell just because you dont approve?\"\n\n\"But the church ...\"\n\n\"I told you that you should talk to someone else about the religious stuff, not me. Im not trying to tell you what to believe. You should be able to believe whatever you wish, but I can see youre cherry-picking which teachings to follow and which to ignore, which is pretty much the definition of hypocrisy.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"It means you think its wrong for your mother and me to love each other, but you think its fine for you to judge us.\" Boy, he looks livid. Well, fine. Somebody needs to tell him the facts of life, and it looks like that someone is me.\n\n\"Im not judging my mother.\"\n\nOlivia laughed. \"Come on, Rafe. I know youre smarter than that. You are judging her. And why? Because she loves someone you dont approve of, someone you dont like, but didnt she tell you how happy she is with me?\"\n\nRafe shook his head, his belligerence palpable. \"She should have married Frank.\"\n\n\"Oh, really? Well, you know what? I thought you really loved your mother, Rafe, but when you come up with complete crap like that, I have my doubts.\"\n\n\"Of course I love my mother. How dare you say that?\"\n\n\"You love your mother, but youd want her to marry a man she doesnt love? A man who just hurt her enough to leave ugly black bruises? A man whos starting to scare her?\"\n\n\"He didnt mean to hurt her.\"\n\nJesus Christ! What in the hell will it take to get through to you? If I didnt know better, Id think Frank was your real father and youd come by this whole \"not listening\" thing honestly. \"Rafe, Im so disappointed in you. I know you and I dont see eye to eye on a lot of things, but I truly thought you cared about your mother. I really thought you loved her and would protect her.\"\n\n\"Thats what Im trying to do.\"\n\n\"You want to protect her by trying to bully the person she loves into staying away from her? You want to protect her by hoping to see her with a man she not only doesnt love, but fears? Thats not love, Rafe. Thats control. Control has nothing to do with love.\"\n\n\"What do you know about love?\"\n\nOlivias expression softened. \"Before your mom, not a lot. She taught me what real love is.\"\n\n\"I dont believe you.\"\n\n\"Fine, dont believe me. Hate me. Whatever. But you owe it to your mother to look at your own behavior and see what youre doing to her.\"\n\n\"I would never hurt my mother.\"\n\n\"Rafe, she came over here right after you walked out on her in the park. Trust me. You hurt your mother. You really hurt her, Rafe. Now what are you going to do about it?\"\n\nRafe seemed on the verge of hurling another insult, but instead he spun toward the door, flung it open, and left, leaving the door wide open in his wake.\n\nOlivia sighed and slowly walked over to close it. Gee, that went really well.\n\n******************************\n\nNatalia was startled when the phone rang, but she sat up on the edge of her bed and grabbed the handset off the night stand. \"Hello?\"\n\n\"Natalia?\"\n\n\"Olivia, Im so glad you called.\" Suddenly her world didnt feel so cold and dark.\n\n\"I wanted to let you know your son just paid me a little visit.\"\n\n\"Oh no. Was he angry?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think its safe to say he was angry.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"Oh, I think you can probably guess.\"\n\n\"Im afraid to.\"\n\n\"He told me to stay away from you.\"\n\n\"What did you say to him?\" Natalia could feel her muscles clenching. Olivia didnt need to tell her the conversation had gone badly. She knew in her heart it had.\n\n\"I told him I loved you.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"I might have mentioned he should show you some respect.\"\n\n\"Im sure he loved hearing that.\"\n\n\"Not so much, actually. I also suggested he take a look at his own behavior before he goes around judging other people.\"\n\n\"Do you think you got through to him?\"\n\n\"No, not really.\"\n\n\"Im sorry if my son disrespected you, Olivia. Im just so sorry.\"\n\n\"I dont want you to worry about that. I can tell you one thing, though. Im going to delay letting Emma come home for at least a little while longer. I dont want her around the level of anger I saw in Rafe tonight.\"\n\nNatalias head dropped forward and her eyes welled with tears. \"No,\" she said slowly, \"that wouldnt be good for a little girl.\"\n\n\"I just talked with Ava about it. The good news is Emmas having so much fun out there that she hasnt been begging to come home yet. Shes missing day camp, but itll still be here when she comes home.\"\n\n\"Olivia, Im just so sorry.\"\n\n\"Listen to me. This is not your fault.\"\n\n\"Hes my son.\"\n\n\"I know, but hes plenty old enough to know better. This is all on him, not you.\"\n\nAfter they finally hung up, Natalia felt even more depressed about her son. Where had she gone wrong that her son behaved the way he did sometimes? She thought about her last visit with Sister Anne, in which the nun had encouraged her to take control of her life, saying it was not only the right thing for her, but also the most loving thing she could do for her son. That advice was making more and more sense as time went by.\n\nNatalia was almost asleep when she heard the downstairs door open. She hoped it was Rafe, but the sudden adrenaline rush that swept through her body was clear evidence she wasnt sure. She pushed away thoughts of Frank and Jacob and other scary things that might come out of the darkness of night and pulled on a robe. When she got to the top of the stairs, she hesitated, afraid of what she might find down there.\n\n\"Rafael?\" she called out hesitantly.\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nHer relief was immense, not just that it wasnt an intruder, but that her son really had come home. That has to be a good sign, right? She started down the stairs and met Rafe halfway. \"Im so glad youre here,\" she said.\n\n\"Im not staying,\" he said, avoiding looking at her.\n\n\"What? Why not?\"\n\n\"I talked to Frank.\"\n\nNatalia could feel her stomach lurch. \"You did?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it helps to talk to him.\"\n\nShe wasnt sure what to say or what to ask him.\n\n\"Hes going out of town for at least a couple of days, and he said I could stay at his place.\"\n\n\"Youre going to stay at Franks?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I want to be alone.\"\n\n\"I was hoping we could talk.\"\n\n\"What else is there to talk about?\"\n\n\"I just want you to understand about me and Olivia.\"\n\n\"Well, I dont.\"\n\nRafe pushed past his mother and continued up the stairs to his room where he began to stuff clothing and other items into his backpack. Natalia went in after him.\n\n\"Then stay and talk with me. Maybe I can help you understand.\"\n\nHe stuffed his baseball mitt in on top of his clothes, zipped the backpack closed, and hefted it onto his shoulder. \"Why her? I just dont get it.\"\n\n\"Because the more I got to know her, the more I discovered how wonderful she is.\"\n\n\"Olivia Spencer?\"\n\n\"Yes. Rafe, Ive told you about some of the things shes done for both of us.\"\n\n\"But what about when she took the house?\"\n\nNatalia looked at him for a moment, trying to think of a way to reach him. \"Have you ever done anything you regretted?\"\n\nThe anger in Rafes face seemed to fade somewhat and his eyes dropped to the floor before returning to his mothers face. \"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Do you want people judging the person you are today, the person you want to be in the future, based on the things youve done in the past that youve come to regret?\"\n\nHe looked down again and this time he didnt look back up. \"No.\"\n\n\"Why do you hold a harsher standard for Olivia than you do for yourself or for me or ... or for Frank?\"\n\nRafe slowly shook his head.\n\n\"Is it because of your fathers heart?\" Natalia watched her sons face harden again.\n\nHe shrugged.\n\n\"Rafael, there was nothing the doctors could do to save your father. Before he died, he did everything in his power to try to get Olivia to the top of the donor list and to keep her from giving up hope. He loved her. If he could have had a say, I have no doubt he wouldve agreed with my decision to allow the donation.\" She could see a hint of tears in Rafes eyes.\n\n\"It just seems wrong that he died and she lived.\"\n\n\"I know you feel bad your father died, especially just when you were getting to know him, but its not Olivias fault he died. It was Gods will. Youve got to stop blaming Olivia, Rafael.\" Natalia thought she saw a slight nod of his head. Maybe I got through to you this time. \"Rafael?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I hear what youre saying. I guess Ive always blamed Olivia for living when my dad died.\"\n\n\"But can you see its not her fault?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nNatalia thought he looked a little lost, just like when he was a small boy and something went wrong in his little universe. She drew him into a hug, and to her relief she felt his arms encircle her waist. \"I love you so much,\" she said.\n\n\"I love you, too, Ma.\"\n\n\"Everythings going to be okay,\" she continued. \"Youre getting your life back on track. Youre working and youll be starting classes in the fall. Everything will work out. Youll see.\"\n\nRafe nodded.\n\n\"Look, its late. Why dont you stay here tonight and then in the morning you can decide what you want to do next, okay?\"\n\nRafe dropped his backpack onto the floor and sat on the edge of his bed. \"I guess I could do that.\"\n\n\"All right, Rafael.\" She kissed the top of his head and started to leave.\n\n\"Is she going to be moving in here?\"\n\nNatalia stopped in the doorway, startled by the sudden question, and slowly turned back to face her son. \"Nothings going to change right now.\"\n\n\"But you want her to live here, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do.\"\n\nAbruptly Rafe grabbed his backpack and headed out the door of his bedroom and down the stairs. Natalia followed him to the landing.\n\n\"Rafael, wait!\"\n\nHe turned back with an angry scowl. \"I wont live here if shes going to move in.\"\n\n\"Shes not moving in right now. We both know you need time to get used to the idea of ... us.\"\n\n\"Im just telling you. Either I live here or she does, but we cant both live under the same roof. You choose.\"\n\nRafe quickly passed through the living room, and then Natalia could hear her car start up.\n\nThere it was, the thing shed dreaded. Her son wanted to force her to choose between him and the woman she loved.\n\n******************************\n\nChapter 82\n\nOlivia woke earlier than she wanted and pried one eye open just enough to see the green LED display on the clock on the night stand, which confirmed her suspicions it was too early to be awake, even though it was nearly eight. She knew she didnt have a meeting until late morning and had hoped to sleep in; however, nightmares about an angry young man had pushed her to flee dreamland, and now she debated whether to just give in and get up, or try to get her dreams focused back on a more pleasant subject, such as the angry young mans beautiful mother.\n\nAn unexpected knock on the door made the decision for her, and reluctantly she dragged herself out of bed and stumbled in the general direction of the door, though her powers of navigation seemed to be alarmingly compromised. God, youd think I was drunk. Im so not a morning person. When she finally reached the door, she leaned her forehead against the cool wood for a moment before cracking it open enough to see who was there. To her surprise, it was Natalia. I guess Rafe didnt go home, otherwise theres no way youd be here so soon.\n\nShe opened the door wider, and Natalia stepped over the threshold and then stood uncertainly in the middle of the room. Olivia noted she was already dressed for work, but looked as though she hadnt slept in recent months. Unsure what to say, she just held her arms open and Natalia immediately stepped into her embrace. As soon as Olivia hugged her, she could feel the tension in her body. This isnt good. I thought sure hed go back home after he left here last night.\n\nNatalia was the first to pull back. \"Have you eaten anything yet?\"\n\nOlivia shook her head.\n\n\"Ill order you something. What are you in the mood for? Pancakes? Omelet?\"\n\n\"Omelet sounds good, and, of course, coffee.\" For the first time Olivia saw a hint of a smile and a brief glimpse of dimples that disappeared all too quickly.\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"I hope youre eating with me.\" Olivia smiled with relief when Natalia nodded. She sat on the couch and leaned her head back with her eyes closed while her unexpected, but totally gorgeous, visitor called room service. Afterward, she was surprised when she heard Natalia sit at the desk instead of joining her on the couch. Hard to give you a morning kiss with you way the hell over there. Or ... maybe thats why youre way over there in the first place.\n\nShe opened her eyes to see if she could tell something from Natalias expression. Olivia thought she looked beautiful in her dark blue skirt and blazer with a white blouse that provided a perfect contrast to her dark hair and eyes, but her expression was alarmingly grim.\n\n\"Maybe you should tell me whats wrong,\" Olivia said.\n\n\"I think we should wait till youve had some coffee ... and food,\" Natalia said. \"Itll keep.\"\n\nWow, this is gonna be bad, isnt it? \"All right, how about if I take a shower real quick then?\"\n\nNatalia nodded and Olivia pushed herself up and headed for the bathroom. By the time she finished and returned to the main room wearing a fluffy white robe over her matching pink bra and panties, the breakfast cart was there and Natalia was setting food out on the coffee table.\n\nNeither spoke. Natalia seemed distracted, and Olivia was becoming increasingly worried about her solemn demeanor. Im sure somethings wrong. I wish youd just spit it out. She knew Natalia well enough to realize there was no way shed tell her anything until she saw Olivia get some food down, so Olivia simply resigned herself to her fate: Shed have to wait till the breakfast police was satisfied before she could find out what was going on.\n\nNatalia set a cup of coffee in front of Olivia, much to her relief. She was having trouble tracking and hoped a jolt of caffeine would sharpen her wits, what few she could muster. When she was halfway through her omelet, she set her fork down, noting Natalia had barely touched her own breakfast.\n\n\"Please tell me whats wrong,\" Olivia said.\n\n\"Rafe came home last night.\"\n\n\"Really? Thats good.\" No, wait. You still look upset. \"Its not good?\"\n\n\"At first I was really happy hed come home.\"\n\n\"Did you argue?\"\n\n\"Not really. In fact, I think I made some headway with him.\"\n\nOlivia picked up her coffee and drained the remainder. Ive got to wake up cause Im just not seeing the problem here. \"Im glad, but ... you look upset, so I know something else must have happened.\"\n\nNatalia got up to get the coffeepot off the cart and refilled Olivias cup before sitting back down on the couch. \"When he first got home, he started packing a bag to go stay at Franks. He said Frank was going to be out of town for a couple of days, and Rafe said he wanted to be alone to think.\"\n\n\"Okay, Im not surprised he went to see Frank. Did he tell you anything Frank said?\"\n\n\"No, but Rafe and I talked about ... well, about a lot of things.\"\n\n\"Like me?\" Hey, I know I was a prime topic of conversation. How could I not be with Rafe so pissy about me loving his mom? Olivia thought for a moment. Or rather pissy about his mom loving me. I dont think he gives a damn what I feel or think.\n\n\"Yes, your name came up.\"\n\n\"Im not surprised.\"\n\n\"Ive thought for a long time the main reason hes always so angry with you is because of his fatherbecause Nicky died and because you got his heart.\"\n\n\"Im aware of that.\"\n\n\"I told him it wasnt your fault his father died. I also said if Nicky could have had a say, he wouldve wanted you to have his heart.\"\n\nOlivia looked down. It was still hard to think about Guss death, especially knowing it was what led to her second chance at life.\n\n\"I told Rafe he needed to stop blaming you for his fathers death, and I think I actually got through to him.\"\n\n\"Thats great.\" Not to mention a freakin miracle, cause I know how that kid just doesnt listen. Frank would be so proud of his surrogate son.\n\n\"I even talked him into staying the night at the farmhouse since it was so late. He actually set his backpack on the floor and sat on his bed.\"\n\n\"Wow, I assumed from how upset you seemed that he hadnt spent the night out there.\"\n\n\"He didnt.\"\n\n\"I thought ... okay, so what happened?\"\n\n\"He asked if you were going to be moving into the farmhouse.\"\n\nOlivia felt as though someone had just dumped a pitcher of ice water on her heada pitcher with plenty of big, hard ice cubes that made her current headache ramp up from the unexpected little frigid blows. \"What did you tell him?\"\n\n\"I said I wanted you to move back, but nothing was happening right away because we both knew he needed time to get used to the idea of us.\"\n\nI already know something bads coming. \"And?\"\n\n\"He said he wouldnt live under the same roof with you. He told me Id have to choose.\"\n\nOlivia propped her elbows on her knees and dropped her face into her hands, suddenly too tired to hold her head up any longer. \"I understand,\" she said wearily. Now I know why youre so upset. Youve come to break up with me. You cant choose me over your son. I get it, but its killing me. I guess the one good thing is at least the other shoe has now dropped. Just waiting for that damned thing to fall has been nerve-racking.\n\n\"Olivia, did you hear what I just said?\"\n\nOlivia shook her head. \"Sorry, I didnt hear you. I was thinking and ... well, I just want you to know I understand. I know you dont want to break up any more than I do, but ... this is your kid. I get that. I really do.\" Olivia leaned back against the couch and closed her eyes again. She felt as though every iota of energy had drained right out of her body. She wanted to cry, but she just didnt have the energy to manage it. Maybe later. Yeah, later is good. She felt Natalias hand on the side of her face gently turning her head in her direction, but she kept her eyes closed. It would just take such a huge effort to try to get them open, she figured why bother?\n\n\"Olivia, I need you to listen to me.\"\n\n\"I did listen. You had to make a choice. I told you I understand. What else is there?\"\n\n\"Well, theres what I said after that.\"\n\nShit, I guess we have to thrash through it then, even though I really dont feel up to it, but okay, fine. \"All right, Im listening.\"\n\n\"I said there is no choice.\"\n\n\"And I told you I get it.\"\n\n\"I mean Im not going to make a choice between you and my son.\"\n\nOlivias eyes snapped open and she found Natalia sitting very close, gazing intently into her eyes. \"I dont ... understand.\"\n\n\"Im not going to make a choice like that, Olivia.\"\n\nGod you look gorgeous when youre all somber like this. Wait, thats an inappropriate thought in the middle of a conversation like this, isnt it? I really need to work on that. \"So ... are you saying you dont want to break up?\"\n\n\"Thats exactly what Im saying.\"\n\nNah, thats not going to work. Clearly you havent thought this through. Or maybe Im still missing something. \"Look, if you dont make a choice, you know what that means. Rafe will move out permanently. Is that what you want?\"\n\n\"No, but I keep thinking about what Sister Anne told me about taking control of my own life and how that was the most loving thing I could do for my son. At first I understood what she meant about taking control of my life, but I didnt get how that could be better for my son if it meant that sometimes I might do things that would upset him, but lately Ive begun to figure out what she meant.\"\n\n\"So you think its better, not just for you, but also for Rafe if you ... make decisions that are right for your life, even if your son disapproves?\"\n\nNatalia finally smiled, and it was a real smile complete with dimples at full mast. \"I couldnt have put it as well, but yes, I think thats the right thing for both of uswell, for all of us, including you and Emma.\"\n\nOlivia could feel her eyes getting watery. Damn it, I said Id do that later! I really dont want to cry right now. \"All of us?\"\n\nNatalia took Olivias hand and pulled it onto her lap, where she gently ran her thumb to and fro over the back. \"Olivia, I told you that you and Emma are my family, and I meant it. In my heart, youre just as much a part of my family as Rafe.\"\n\n\"But ... but what are you going to do about him?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Im going to tell him I love him and I hope hell stay at the farmhouse just like we planned. He knows staying in the dorms is too expensive on top of tuition and books and everything, so I have no idea what hell do.\"\n\n\"Look, if thats what he wants to do, stay in the dorms, Ill help.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\nOlivia was startled by Natalias sudden vehemence. \"I thought we just discussed couples helping each other out ... you know ... farmhouse and all that. I thought you were finally okay with that.\"\n\n\"You are not going to help him anymore as long as he treats you the way he did last night.\"\n\n\"Did he ... uhm ... did he tell you what happened?\"\n\n\"No, he didnt have to. He was angry with me, he went to Daisy and got mad at her, and then he headed to your penthouse. Nobody has to tell me how angry he must have been by the time he got to your place.\"\n\n\"He did seem a bit ... miffed.\"\n\n\"Im sure.\"\n\n\"So I guess he told Daisy about us?\"\n\n\"Yes. I called her looking for him. She said she told him shes always liked you and she thought it was great you and I had found love.\"\n\n\"Wow, Im ... impressed.\" I knew Id always liked that girl for some reason. Shes an independent thinker. I totally approve. \"But listen, if Rafe living in the dorm would help ease the situation and let him get some sense of the independence we both know he wants, why not just let me help?\"\n\n\"Because I dont want my son disrespecting you one minute and taking money from you the next as a reward for his bad behavior.\"\n\nDamn! Who is this gorgeous woman and what did she do with Natalia? \"Its hard to believe you, uh ...\"\n\nNatalia sighed. \"I know. Its been hard for me to get to this point. I doubt Id be here now if it werent for Sister Anne. Ive spent my entire life feeling guilty that because of my mistakemy sinmy son has been deprived of a father, of grandparents, of a great-grandmother, and of a life that could have been much easier and better than the one Ive been able to give him.\"\n\n\"Natalia, youve done an amazing job raising your child. I honestly dont know how you did it. Dont forget I got pregnant around the same age as you, and I wouldve had no idea how to take care of a baby all by myself.\"\n\n\"I did my best, but look at all the trouble my son has gotten into. I realize I must not have been a very good mother or he wouldnt have done the ... the bad things hes done.\"\n\n\"Youre talking about Jeffrey?\"\n\n\"Well, yes, but thats not the only thing. Remember how he hurt Josh?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"He had a knife, Olivia!\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"And he cut him!\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know. I know what he did.\"\n\n\"Then he hurt Coop and that guard at juvie, and worst of all he took a gun with him when he went after Jeffrey,\" Natalia said. \"No, thats not the worst thing.\"\n\n\"Theres something worse?\n\n\"I mean the worst thing is every time he did something like that, I felt like it was my fault, like if Id been a better mother and given him a better life, he wouldnt be so angry and he wouldnt be taking it out on other people.\" Natalias eyes drifted away from Olivias. \"The problem is Ive always made excuses for him instead of ... Im trying to remember what Sister Anne said. I think she said I never held him accountable for his actions. And you know what? Hes gotten worse. Hes a very angry boy and he just lashes out at people.\"\n\n\"Hes an angry man.\"\n\nNatalia looked back up at Olivia then. \"Did he hurt you?\"\n\n\"No ... he, uh ...\"\n\n\"Were you afraid hed hurt you?\"\n\n\"I remember thinking I bet thats exactly how he looked when he held a gun on Jeffrey.\"\n\n\"Olivia, Im so sorry. Im also worried. Im worried about whats going to happen to my son, but I dont want him to hurt you, and I dont want any of this to affect Emma.\"\n\n\"Dont worry about Emma. Im not letting her come back here for a little while, not until I think its okay.\"\n\n\"Im glad. Well, I wish Emma could come back and you could both move into the farmhouse right now, but I know we need to wait just a little while longer.\"\n\nOlivia sighed. \"I know.\"\n\n\"But the important thing is Sister Anne helped me see I need to change how I deal with my son, and even though I didnt believe her at first, somewhere along the line I realized shes right. So thats what Im doing now. Im trying to do right by my son, by all of us. The hard part is figuring out what that is.\"\n\n\"So what have you figured out so far?\n\n\"I figured out itd be wrong to let him force me to give you up.\"\n\n\"So youre not giving me up?\"\n\nNatalia smiled. \"No, Ill never give you up.\"\n\nThank god, Olivia thought as she leaned forward and kissed Natalia. She suddenly pulled back as it struck her that if the other shoe hadnt dropped yet, she still had that to look forward to. Damn it! And now Im cursing again. Shit! God, its like I have internal Tourette's or something.\n\nOlivia quickly forgot about shoes and cursing and possible neurological disorders when Natalia pulled her back and Olivia began kissing her again, still astonished at how arousing it was when their lips simply came in contact.\n\n******************************\n\nWhen they finally drew apart, Natalia lay her head on Olivias chest, which was now rising and falling a little faster than usual. She could hear the reassuring sound of Olivias steady, if somewhat rapid, heartbeat, and it felt wonderful to have such a soft and sensuous pillow beneath her cheek. She loved the lush curves of Olivias body and how she herself felt when she looked at her or touched her. Id be happy if we could just stay here like this all day, she thought dreamily and then blushed as she realized shed definitely want that to include more of Olivias impassioned kisses.\n\n\"I think I should do something special for Sister Anne,\" Olivia said as she slowly combed her fingers through Natalias long, dark tresses. \"Like maybe make a donation to her favorite charity or something like that.\"\n\nNatalia smiled. \"I think youre serious.\"\n\n\"Im very serious, especially if you meant what you said awhile ago about you doubt youd have ever gotten to this point without her help.\"\n\n\"I did mean it ... although I should have said it was because of both her and you.\"\n\n\"Me? I dont know what Ive done.\"\n\n\"Its really been both of you thoughSister Anne, because of her wise counsel, and you, because youre the first person Ive loved enough that its forced me to really see the person my son has become.\"\n\n\"And thats why you looked so upset when you got here this morning.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Natalia sat up so she could see Olivias face, but she pulled her hand back onto her lap so she could still maintain contact. \"Its not easy realizing how many mistakes Ive made. Ive even continued making some of the same mistakes because I didnt really get what Sister Anne was trying to help me see.\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"Like ... well, if I let Rafe treat me as though my life and my choices and my feelings dont matter as much as his, what Im really doing is teaching him how to treat other people, especially the women in his life, like a girlfriend or a wife. I couldnt see that when Sister Anne first mentioned it, but since then Ive begun to understand what she means.\"\n\n\"I know he loves you, but he doesnt always treat you very well.\"\n\n\"I know, and it makes me feel ashamed.\"\n\n\"I know it must be hard to feel ashamed of your own son.\"\n\n\"No, I meant it makes me ashamed of myself, because Im the one whos always put myself second, no matter what. Rafe is part of the reason I agreed to marry Frank. I wanted him to have that big family he wouldve gotten with the entire Cooper clan, instead of being the son of a woman whose family ... threw her out.\" Natalia could feel her throat constricting. She tried never to think of her family. It was too painful.\n\n\"Hey, dont you think youre taking on too much blame?\"\n\n\"No, I really dont. And now all I can do is try to make better choices, starting with not allowing my son to force me to do something I dont want to do, especially give up the person Im in love with.\" Natalia smiled at Olivias sudden mischievous grin, which, for some reason, made her begin to get that now familiar achy feeling \"down there.\"\n\n\"Youre in love with someone?\" Olivia asked as her eyebrows lifted in mock surprise.\n\nNatalia grinned and nodded.\n\n\"Anyone I know?\"\n\n\"Yes, someone you know really well.\"\n\nNatalia was surprised when Olivia abruptly cupped her face and pulled her close for a kiss that turned out to be passionate and deep and prolonged enough that she forgot about everything except the wonder of how Olivia made her feel. Olivias love and passion and intensity never failed to sweep her out of the everyday world and into a magical universe of sensuality and pleasure and desire that she now knew came only with true love.\n\nBy the time either of them noticed someone was knocking on the door, they were both lying on the couch so absorbed in kissing and touching that they almost missed the intrusive and annoying rapping entirely.\n\nFinally Olivia sat up. \"Damn it!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Natalia asked, still not hearing anything but her own heavy breathing.\n\n\"Somebodys at the door.\"\n\n\"I didnt hear\" Natalia stopped when she heard the loud knocking. \"Oh.\"\n\nThey both laughed.\n\n\"I guess I better get it. Could be important,\" Olivia said. \"And maybe you should pull yourself back together,\" she added, looking pointedly at Natalias chest.\n\nNatalia quickly began to button her blouse and then tucked it back into her skirt. \"Maybe you should pull yourself back together,\" she said, overlapping the two halves of Olivias robe that had come apart and tying her belt snugly around her waist. \"Would you like for me to get it since Im the one whos dressed?\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Olivia said with a laugh.\n\nNatalia grinned back at her over her shoulder before opening the door. \"Doris,\" she said when she saw the mayor standing there staring at her.\n\nMayor Wolfe entered the penthouse and strode directly to where Olivia sat on the couch.\n\n\"Please come in,\" Natalia said softly as she watched Doris traverse the room and take a seat by Olivia on the couch.\n\n\"What brings you by so early?\" Olivia asked.\n\n\"I needed to check with both of you,\" Doris said. Her eyes shifted to Natalia and she suddenly grinned when Natalia perched on the arm of the couch next to Olivia.\n\n\"Something amusing?\" Olivia asked.\n\n\"Well, I think I interrupted something,\" Doris said with a lift of one thin brow.\n\n\"What makes you say that?\" Olivia asked.\n\nDoris nodded in Natalias direction and Olivia looked at her and laughed.\n\nNatalia was confused about what could possibly be so funny. \"What?\" she asked Olivia.\n\n\"Buttons,\" Olivia said, glancing at her chest.\n\nNatalia glanced down and then felt an immediate flush of heat in her cheeks when she saw the buttons on her white blouse werent lined up properly. She quickly stood and turned her back on the two women staring at her with undisguised mirth so she could fix the problem. Afterward she sat back on the couch arm.\n\n\"No need to be embarrassed,\" Olivia said, taking her hand. \"After all, Doris knows about us.\"\n\nNatalia looked down at her lap aware the heat in her cheeks was intensifying. She realized Doris knew, but for some reason she couldnt help blushing. She thought Olivia might be surprised to know she did that sometimes when she was alone thinking about the sexy woman she loved without the overly observant mayor watching her and reading her inner thoughts and feelings. Its Olivia, she thought. She just makes me feel so ... off-balance. She could see from Olivias grin how much she loved her sudden shyness. Maybe she felt like this because it was the first time shed had a relationship in which her emotions were so fully engagedand in which her body was so unbelievably responsive, she thought, turning even redder. Whatever the case, she was relieved when Olivia turned back to Doris.\n\n\"So whats up?\" Olivia asked the mayor.\n\n\"Has either of you heard from Frank?\" Doris asked.\n\n\"I havent,\" Olivia said. \"Why?\"\n\n\"As you know, hes on a one-week suspension from the force.\"\n\n\"Yeah, we know,\" Olivia said. \"So?\"\n\n\"Nobody has seen him,\" Doris said.\n\n\"So what?\" Olivia asked.\n\nNatalia saw Doriss eyes narrow, which made her feel uneasy. She was already concerned about Frank. She hoped he was going to give up on a relationship with her, and hopefully he already had, but he seemed so ... off. She could feel something just wasnt right about him.\n\n\"So what? For starters he didnt show up for the counseling session that Chief Wolfe recommended. He was supposed to be there yesterday afternoon, but he didnt show, and then this morning when the police chief tried to contact him, he was nowhere to be found.\"\n\n\"Did they check with Buzz or Marina?\"\n\n\"Yes, weve called everybody who might have any idea where he is, but no one seems to know anything.\"\n\n\"Rafe saw him last night,\" Natalia said.\n\nDoris looked at her in surprise.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"At Franks place. He told Rafe he could stay there for a while. He also said he was going out of town for a couple of days.\"\n\nDoriss eyes narrowed. \"Oh really?\"\n\n\"Oh, come on, Doris,\" Olivia said. \"Hes probably gone off to be by himself. My guess is hes on a bender somewhere.\"\n\n\"Thats no way to deal with his problems,\" Doris said.\n\n\"I dont know thats what hes doing, but I do know when he gets really upset, he drinks ... heavily,\" Olivia said. \"And maybe he didnt want to do that here in Springfield around people he knows.\"\n\n\"You could be right. He was a little drunk the day he accosted me on the street. Im just lucky Id hired bodyguards, because he was so amped up it took both of them to subdue him.\"\n\n\"Maybe its good he went out of town,\" Natalia said. \"Maybe he needs some time alone to get his life back on track. He just hasnt seemed like himself lately.\"\n\n\"Thats right,\" Doris said. \"Its clear hes changed since the wedding didnt take place. Personally I think he has some pretty big mental problems, and it concerns me. He should have kept his appointment with the psychiatrist. The fact he didnt tells me he still hasnt accepted that he has a problemor maybe hes just unwilling to work on it.\"\n\nNatalia glanced down at Olivia, who looked worried.\n\n\"What are you saying?\" Olivia asked. \" That hes mentally ill?\"\n\n\"People dealing with crises do develop mental illnesses sometimes, Olivia. Thats why we have mental health professionals. They dont just deal with people in institutions, you know.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I guess,\" Olivia said.\n\nDoris stood up. \"Ive got to go,\" she said as she walked toward the door. \"But I just wanted to warn both of you to be careful.\"\n\n\"I dont think Frank would do anything to hurt either of us,\" Natalia said. \"Not after what happened the other night at the farmhouse.\"\n\nDoris paused with her hand on the doorknob and looked back at the two women sitting on the couch. \"Oh really? And youve just done such a great job figuring out what Frank is capable of up to now, havent you, Natalia?\" Doris twisted the knob and opened the door. \"I am telling both of you that you better be careful.\" Doris stepped into the hallway and shut the door behind her.\n\nNatalia stared at the closed door, trying not to believe Doriss ominous warning.\n\n******************************\n\nChapter 83\n\nOlivia tugged on Natalias arm to get her attention off the door Mayor Wolfe had just closed and back onto her. \"Hey, whered you go?\"\n\nNatalia turned back and looked down at Olivia from her perch on the sofa arm. \"Im not sure what to think about what Doris said.\"\n\n\"Look, we already knew we needed to be careful around Frank, and we will.\"\n\n\"Im afraid of what he might say to Rafe.\"\n\n\"We have no control over that. Besides, Rafe is already upset about us without any help from Frank. And as to your ex-fiancé, I really do think hes probably off somewhere drowning his sorrows. Im sure hes feeling disgraced after the suspension, so maybe he doesnt want to spend his week off around here where hes likely to run into people he knows.\"\n\n\"Maybe.\"\n\n\"Now where were we?\" Olivia asked as she pulled Natalia off the arm of the couch onto her lap, leaving her lover off-balance and dependent on Olivias arm to keep her from falling flat on her back onto the cushions.\n\nNatalia laughed and struggled to get loose. \"I think maybe we should be getting to work, dont you?\"\n\n\"Why? Whats going to happen?\" Olivia asked as her hand caressed Natalias cheek. \"You afraid maybe well get fired?\" Ive got you right where I want you. Why would I let go now?\n\nOlivia let her free hand slide down Natalias side to her hip and pulled her closer while she sought out those delectably soft lips to prevent the protest she knew Natalia was about to launch. As Olivia kissed her, she could feel her going limp in her arms as she ceased her efforts to wrestle her way loose from Olivias firm grip. Thats more like it, Olivia thought when Natalia finally just gave in and let Olivia do what she wanted, which at the moment was explore her lips and her mouth as if shed never experienced the wonder of such an intimate invasion.\n\nThe sound of the phone ringing startled them both.\n\n\"Oh, for Christs sake,\" Olivia muttered. \"Lets just let the damn thing ring.\"\n\n\"It could be Ava,\" Natalia said.\n\n\"Yeah, I guess.\" Olivia helped Natalia up and then got up herself and grabbed the handset off the desk. \"Hello?\" She shook her head at Natalia and glanced at her watch. \"Sure, that would be fine. Well see you in my office shortly.\"\n\n\"Problem?\" Natalia asked.\n\n\"Not really. That was Katarina. You and I both need to make sure were proficient with the new software before she leaves, and since I want her gone sooner rather than later, I guess I better get dressed.\"\n\n\"So were meeting with her now?\"\n\n\"Yes. You didnt have other plans did you?\"\n\n\"No, Im here to work. In fact, why dont I check the Beacon email account while you get ready?\"\n\n\"Okay, I wont be long.\" But Id much rather stay here with you on the couch necking. With one last wistful glance at her sexy and delightfully curvy lover, Olivia headed to the bathroom to finish getting ready for work. She was immensely relieved Natalia had been unwilling to submit to Rafes emotional blackmail. Olivia knew thered been a time when she might well have succumbed. I really need to find out what Sister Annes favorite charity is. Shes been nothing short of amazing.\n\nIt wasnt long before the two of them got on the elevator headed to Olivias office.\n\n\"By the way, in all the excitement lately I forgot to tell you Kat dropped by my room yesterday after you left to meet with Rafe.\" Olivia had to fight to keep from grinning at the sudden little frown on Natalias face. Oh my gosh. I cant believe youre still jealous of her. At least Im pretty sure thats what that look means.\n\n\"What did that woman want?\" Natalia asked.\n\nYep, I think youre actually a little jealous. How adorable is that? \"She wanted to tell me Frank had asked her to meet him for drinks.\"\n\nNatalias frown deepened. \"Why would she want you to know that? Do you think she was trying to make you jealous?\"\n\nThis time Olivia couldnt stop her grin or the small chuckle that accompanied it. \"No, she wanted to warn me that Franks not my friend. Apparently he didnt have very nice things to say about me.\"\n\nThe elevator doors slid open, and they both stepped into the corridor.\n\n\"Olivia, Im so sorry he blames you for the wedding not taking place. Thats so wrong, especially after the way you helped him win me over.\"\n\n\"Well, he sure needed help.\"\n\n\"I know now he never could have come up with the sweet and thoughtful things he did for me all on his own, not because he wouldnt have tried, but because he really didnt know me that well.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know.\"\n\n\"Thats one way I know he doesnt really love me. Well, not the real me. He doesnt know me. He just doesnt know who I am, so how could he love me?\"\n\n\"Dont ask me. Im too in love with you to figure out how anyone else could not be.\"\n\nNatalia giggled and opened the door to Olivias office. Olivia went immediately to sit in the executive chair behind the desk while Natalia lingered by the door. Olivia was aware of dark eyes watching her as she sifted through a stack of files on her desk. Shortly afterward there was a knock, and Natalia let Katarina in.\n\n\"Good morning,\" Katarina said. \"How are you two this morning?\"\n\n\"Fine, thanks,\" Olivia said. \"How are you?\"\n\n\"Im well,\" Katarina said, sitting on one of the two chairs in front of Olivias desk while Natalia settled herself on the other. Kat glanced briefly at Natalia before locking eyes with Olivia. \"I wondered if I might bring up a personal matter before we begin.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Olivia said. \"I was just telling Natalia about our conversation yesterday.\"\n\n\"Good, then you both know of my concern.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Olivia said, but then her eyes narrowed as she realized Katarina seemed edgy, which wasnt at all like the cool and calm woman shed come to know. \"Is there something else?\"\n\nAgain Katarina glanced at Natalia briefly before focusing back on Olivia. \"Yes, Detective Cooper called me yesterday.\"\n\n\"Did he ask you out again?\" Olivia asked. Maybe thats how Frank wanted to spend his week off. Who could blame him? Katarinas a knockout.\n\n\"No, he wanted to make sure I wasnt planning to leave town yet,\" Katarina explained.\n\nNatalia stirred restlessly on her chair. \"Why would he care?\"\n\nKatarina turned crystal blue eyes on Natalia. \"Because he told me if I wanted a chance with Olivia, I should stick around, as he put it.\"\n\nOlivia watched with mixed emotions as the other two women conversed with each other. On the one hand, Kats concern about Frank made her feel wary, but on the other hand she couldnt help but be fascinated by Natalias obvious territorial demeanor where Olivia was concerned. Who would have guessed you could be like this? I know its probably wrong, but its turning me on big time. In fact, Im not sure how much longer I can wait to get you naked.\n\n\"I dont understand why Frank thinks youd have a chance with Olivia if you did stay around here,\" Natalia said. \"No offense.\"\n\nOh my god that was priceless! Olivia looked quickly to see how Katarina had taken Natalias remark. She looked remarkably unruffled. Nothing much fazes her, Olivia thought, except maybe Frank.\n\nKatarina smiled. \"None taken. I just wanted to let you know because a man like that ... well, I think hes not to be trusted.\"\n\n\"So you think hes up to something?\" Olivia asked.\n\n\"Why else would he insist Id get my chance with you if only I didnt leave town too soon?\" Katarina asked.\n\nOlivia shook her head, clearly perplexed. \"I have no idea. He knows I love Natalia,\" Olivia said, trying to figure out what Frank might be thinking. \"No, wait. I take that back.\"\n\nNatalias head whipped around toward Olivia. \"What?\"\n\nOlivia could feel dark eyes flashing even before she turned to look at Natalia. \"I mean ... I think Frank actually believes it when he says Im just, uh ... using you for ... oh, I dont know ... my own evil reasons, I guess. You know ... like another notch on the bedpost or something.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see what youre saying,\" Natalia said.\n\n\"If he really believes that,\" Katarina said, \"then that makes him a very dangerous man.\"\n\n\"Why would you say that?\" Natalia asked.\n\n\"Because if thats what he truly believes, then he probably wants to rescue you, the woman he loves, and he wont stop till he does.\"\n\n\"But theres nothing he can do,\" Natalia said. \"Ive told him Im in love with Olivia.\"\n\nOlivias eyebrows shot up. Wow, I see youre not holding anything back. \"Look, Kat, I really appreciate your concern and your warning. Well both be careful, wont we?\" she asked, turning her gaze on Natalia.\n\nNatalia nodded.\n\n\"Good, because I have to tell you theres something about that man that makes me feel very uneasy,\" Katarina said.\n\n******************************\n\nNatalia was glad when the training session was over and Katarina was gone. She knew Olivia wanted her to know as much about the inner workings of the Beacon as possible, which made her feel proud. She was aware her self-esteem had improved remarkably ever since Olivia had found her worthy of being her assistant. Olivia thought she was smart and capable, and moreover Olivia trusted her. No one had ever had that kind of faith in her or her abilities.\n\nIt had been a long road moving away from her tarnished self-image as a high school dropout, unwed mother, and outcast in her own family. The hardest to deal with had been the latter. How could she feel as though she had worth when her own family thought her sins too great to tolerate? And it wasnt just that shed gotten pregnant; it was also that shed refused to obey their dictate that she give her baby up for adoption. It had primarily been her father who laid down that law, but her mother had sat silently by and let him throw her out of the houseor rather dump her off at one the Catholic Charities homes for unwed mothers, after which he made it clear she was never to return home again.\n\nBut now after a lifetime of low-paying, low-level jobs, she was an executive assistant. Shed learned to use a computer, shed worked hard to get to know the staff and all the inner workings of the hotel, and shed made every effort to make Olivias work life easier. Obviously shed succeeded because even recently when shed offered to quit because of what people might be thinking, Olivia wouldnt hear of it. Natalia could tell it wasnt just because Olivia loved her either. After all, Olivia knew Natalia could in no way resist her, job or not, nor did she want to. No, Olivia had seemed genuinely panicked at the thought of losing her as her assistant. It was one of the highest compliments anyone had ever paid her.\n\nShe was secretly relieved when Olivia refused to let her resign, not only because of what it said about Olivias high regard for her ability to do a good job, but also because she loved working with Olivia at the Beacon. In fact, when Olivia was still living at the farmhouse, Natalia had thrived on being with her at home, working on Beacon projects or problems together, riding into work together, working at the hotel together. Shed never been happierand now, finally, they were so close to getting all of that back. She was living for the day Olivia and Emma moved back in.\n\nThe only dark cloud on her happy horizon was her son. She knew he was nowhere near accepting her relationship with Olivia, but she also knew if she gave into his demand that she give her up, she would be teaching him one more wrong thingthat it was okay for him to force someone else to do what he wanted. She prayed his anger management group and individual counseling sessions would help him get past the problem he had with lashing out at people, sometimes innocent people, like Coop or Olivia. It made her sad to think that right now they had to protect Emma from her son.\n\nThats just not right. I want to trust my son. I want to believe hed never hurt Emma. Well, I do believe he wouldnt deliberately harm her, physically or emotionally, but when he gets angry, he strikes out, and I dont want Emma to see him treating Olivia badly, or me either, for that matter.\n\nThe phone rang, and after a nod from Olivia, Natalia picked it up and spoke briefly with the person on the other end. \"That was Greg,\" Natalia told Olivia. \"Hes pretty upset about some kind of booking issue.\"\n\n\"Would you please see if you can iron that out?\" Olivia asked. \"I need to make some phone calls.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Natalia said with a smile. She knew she was one of the few people who could calm Greg down when he panicked. He didnt do that very often, but when he did, you could feel his anxiety wafting through the hotel like poison gas. \"Ill go see what the problem is exactly.\"\n\n\"Thanks. What would I do without you?\"\n\nNatalia went around Olivias desk and leaned down to kiss her briefly on the mouth. \"Youre not going to have to find out,\" she said softly. She was well aware she much too in love with Olivia to ever willingly leave her. Till death do us part, she thought. She couldnt imagine any circumstance that would change that, nor any personcertainly not Frank and not even her own son.\n\n******************************\n\nOlivias fingers fumbled as she tried to get the shoestrings of her tennis shoe tied. She had to smile at her own giddiness. Shed made an after-work date with a certain beautiful latina, and she was just feeling downright excited. Theyd both agreed they needed a break from work and all the chaos surrounding them, compliments of Frank and his protégé, Rafe. Olivia had suggested they change into casual clothes and take a picnic to the park. She loved the sudden sparkle in Natalias dark eyes at the prospect.\n\nAnd then afterward, maybe I can talk you into coming back to my place. Well, actually, since youre picking me up, youll kinda have to come back here, now wont you? Pays to plan ahead, she thought, pleased with herself that shed nixed Natalias suggestion they meet at the gazebo.\n\nOlivia glanced at her watch. I better get going. Youre probably down there waiting for me.\n\nBy the time she got downstairs, Natalia was waiting in her Beacon car. Olivia put a picnic basket prepared by the Beacon chef into the back seat, and then they both grinned when Olivia got in the front and they saw they were dressed almost identically in blue jeans and blue tops. The only difference was Natalia was wearing a sleeveless V-neck top, while Olivia had on a short-sleeved blouse.\n\n\"We look like twins,\" Natalia said as she pulled away from the curb and headed toward the park.\n\n\"Im not sure anyone would actually accuse us of that,\" Olivia said with a grin. She knew they presented quite a contrast, she with her light skin and grayish-green eyes and Natalia with her exotic dark coloring. She loved how Natalias neckline plunged just far enough to show off her admirable cleavage. You wore that just for me, too, didnt you? I wonder if its too late to talk you into picnicking in my room. She fantasized about how much fun they could be having there, but she knew it was too late because by the time her fantasy date was lying nude on her bed, her real date was pulling into the parking lot at the Olivia Spencer Memorial Park. Thats okay. Maybe youll come up to my room later. Hm, I wonder if you could even stay the night since Rafe is staying at Franks.\n\nNatalia got the picnic basket out of the back, and they both strode off to find as isolated a picnic table as they could find. Although there was a designated area of the park where there were a number of tables together, there were also a few individual tables scattered here and there that provided more privacy. They found one near the butterfly magnolia that Olivia had had planted for Emma when she thought she was going to die before a donor heart could be found. She still loved the tree as it had come to symbolize life, not death.\n\nOlivia watched as Natalia began to set food out on the table. \"I kind of hate to bring this up, but ...\"\n\n\"I tried to call him,\" Natalia said. \"Hes still not answering his cell phone.\"\n\n\"So that means ...?\"\n\n\"It means its either off or hes not taking my calls.\"\n\n\"Im sorry.\" Olivia didnt really know what to say. She thought Sister Anne had the right idea, though. Rafe needed some tough love, and apparently Natalia was ready to give him some.\n\n\"It is what it is,\" Natalia said.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"I ...\" Natalia paused and looked directly at Olivia. \"Im going to live my life.\"\n\nNatalia sat next to Olivia rather than opposite her, much to Olivias delight. \"Love the seating plan,\" she said.\n\nNatalia giggled. \"I thought you might.\"\n\nOlivia moved closer so that their thighs were touching. \"Yep, its an excellent seating arrangement.\"\n\nShed had the Beacon chef make grilled chicken salads, and hed also thrown in Italian breadsticks, smoked cheese, and cubed seedless watermelon for dessert.\n\n\"I love grilled chicken,\" Natalia said.\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"And watermelon,\" Natalia added.\n\n\"I know that, too.\" Hey, I pay attention. I know what you like. Olivias eyes drifted down to Natalias enticing décolletage. I know lots of things you like. Maybe if Im lucky, therell be more for dessert than fruit, Olivia thought as she popped a watermelon cube into her mouth.\n\n\"What are you thinking?\" Natalia asked.\n\n\"If you come back to my place later, Ill show you.\" Olivia felt her bodys clearly lustful reaction to Natalias sudden blush and shy smile. Is it possible to just keep falling more and more in love? I swear it seems like I love you more every day. She was surprised when Natalia slowly reached toward her and ran her thumb over her lips.\n\n\"Juice,\" Natalia explained, licking the red liquid shed just swiped off of Olivias mouth.\n\nThey both giggled and leaned against each other for a moment, before just sitting and looking into each others eyes, both smiling and completely absorbed in the otherso absorbed, in fact, that neither noticed two sets of eyes watching them from a distance.\n\nA short time later they were startled when someone approached their table and spoke.\n\n\"Hi there.\"\n\n\"Daisy,\" Natalia said. \"I, uh ... how are you?\"\n\n\"Im okay.\" Daisy smiled broadly at each of them in turn. \"I dont mean to interrupt.\"\n\n\"Youre not interrupting,\" Olivia said, smiling back at her. Daisy was firmly in her good graces after taking Natalias side against her son the night before.\n\n\"Have you seen Rafe?\" Natalia asked.\n\n\"Well, thats why I came over,\" Daisy said. \"He was just here.\"\n\n\"Here in the park?\" Natalia asked.\n\n\"Yeah, he called and wanted to talk, so I agreed to meet him here.\"\n\nInteresting, Olivia thought. Especially after he got so mad at you last night.\n\n\"Is he okay?\" Natalia asked.\n\n\"I guess. Well, he, uh ...\" Daisy glanced uncertainly at Olivia.\n\n\"Its okay,\" Natalia reassured her. \"I told Olivia what you told me.\"\n\n\"It really is okay,\" Olivia said.\n\n\"All right. Well, hes still pretty upset. Ive tried to talk to him. I mean its not like were living in the nineteenth century. Two women together is no big deal. Well, I mean ...\" Daisy glanced at Olivia uncertainly.\n\n\"Really, its okay,\" Olivia said. \"No need to feel awkward. I dont.\"\n\n\"Okay, good,\" Daisy said. \"Anyway, I told him he was being ridiculous.\"\n\n\"I bet he didnt like that,\" Natalia said.\n\n\"Well, if he doesnt like hearing the truth, he knows better than to call me,\" Daisy said.\n\nI knew I liked this girl, Olivia thought. \"Do you think you got through to him?\"\n\n\"I dont know. Hes just so stubborn. The funny thing is when we saw the two of you sitting over here eating and laughing and ... well, you know ... uhm ...\"\n\n\"Enjoying each others company?\" Olivia offered.\n\n\"Yeah, exactly. When we saw that ...\" Daisy looked at Natalia. \"Like when you touched Olivias mouth or like how the two of you were looking at each other, I told him ... I said, Look, theyre really in love, Rafe.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\" Natalia asked.\n\n\"He didnt say anything. He just got a funny look on his face, and then he walked off.\"\n\n\"And that was it?\" Olivia asked.\n\n\"Yeah, but I wanted to let you know, Natalia, because I know youve been worried about him.\"\n\n\"You know Rafe pretty well,\" Olivia said. \"Do you think theres any chance hell ever accept this?\"\n\n\"I just dont know. I know he loves his mother,\" Daisy said. \"I also remember how angry he got at me a long time ago after the ... well, after the abortion. He was furious at me, but eventually we became friends again, even though its not exactly romantic, at least not right now anyway.\"\n\n\"But at least thats a positive sign,\" Olivia said.\n\n\"Yeah, it is,\" Daisy said. \"Well, I should get going. Nice to see you two, and uh ... Im really happy for you. I think its great.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Olivia said. \"If you ever get tired of working at Company, come see me.\"\n\n\"I will,\" Daisy said with a grin.\n\n\"Thank you for coming over,\" Natalia said.\n\nThey both watched as Daisy strolled off, and then Olivia turned to Natalia.\n\n\"You okay?\"\n\n\"Yes, at least I know hes all right even if hes still upset with me.\"\n\n\"I would assume hes still staying at Franks.\"\n\n\"Im sure he is.\"\n\nOlivia sat quietly for a moment, debating her options. Whats that old saying? Nothing ventured, nothing gained. \"Will you come back to my place with me?\" Maybe I should make myself really, really clear. \"I want you.\"\n\n\"Want me?\"\n\nOlivia sighed. Okay, I guess that wasnt clear enough. \"I want to make love to you.\"\n\nAnd now were going to see just how well youre really handling all this. Your son just saw us being lovey-dovey. I think that has to be hard for you, knowing he saw us like that, especially when Daisy reminded him were in lovelike he could have forgottenand then came over here and reported it all to you. So can you deal with knowing that and still want to be with me, especially when I just made it clear why I want you to come back to my place with me? Im anxious to see what you decide because I think its going to tell us both a lot about whether or not you can deal with the reality of having a relationship with me under the disapproving eyes of your son.\n\n\"Or ...\" Olivia continued, \"we could go for a jog around the pond instead.\"\n\n\"Jog?\"\n\n\"Yeah, you know ... like walking, only faster.\"\n\nNatalia laughed.\n\n\"Or we can do something else, if you like ... maybe go for ice cream or see a movie. Of course, my first choice would be to have you all to myself at my place.\" Olivia reached for Natalias hand, which was lying on her lap. \"So ... what do you think?\"\n\nOlivia wished she felt certain what Natalia would decide, but the truth was she didnt. In fact, she had no idea. She sought the answer in Natalias eyes, which at the moment looked very dark and deep and unfathomable. All she could tell was that they were brimming with emotion, but was it love, desire, fear, regret? She waited impatiently for Natalia to say something.\n\n******************************\n\nChapter 84\n\nNatalia watched as Daisys figure receded into the distance, unaware of the myriad sounds and intricate scents of the park surrounding her as she sat on the picnic table bench next to Olivia. The sun was low in the sky, and the young woman was now a mere dark shadow in stark silhouette against the yellowing horizon.\n\nWhat a shock it had been to find out her son had witnessed her loving interaction with Olivia. That he might be anywhere nearby had never entered her mind, and now she had no idea what he might be thinking or feeling, but the way hed responded to the news she loved Olivia made her conclude he probably wasnt happy to see them like that.\n\nShe could feel the warmth in her cheeks when Daisy told her what theyd seen. It wasnt exactly that she was ashamed of her feelings for Olivia, because she wasntnot anymore, anywaybut she did find it difficult when other people found out, even Daisy, who couldnt have been more supportive. It was different with Doris and Katarina, because both of them loved women, but it was sobering to think how many people in their community would disapprove.\n\nShe felt Olivia squeeze her hand to get her attention, and she dragged her eyes away from the spot on the horizon where Daisy had disappeared from view and focused them on the beautiful woman she could now see was watching her intently.\n\n\"Did you hear what I just said?\" Olivia asked.\n\nNatalia shook her head. \"Im sorry.\" Before her mind wandered off, she remembered Olivia had jokingly suggested they take a jog around the pond. \"You didnt really want to go jogging, did you?\" She watched in fascination as Olivias eyes darkened into that intense, smoldering gaze that always seemed to turn her inside out and summon forth that achy feeling she associated with Olivia, the only one whod ever made her feel like that.\n\n\"No,\" Olivia said. \"I dont. What I really want is for you to come back to my place with me.\"\n\nNatalia could see the unspoken need in Olivias eyes, and she knew it wasnt just a need for physical closeness. It was a need for reassurance that Natalia wasnt going to dump her abruptly now that she knew her son had witnessed a moment of intimacy between them, clearly signaling that the going was starting to get seriously tough.\n\nI know you so well, she thought. I can almost feel what youre thinking right now. You know Im upset about my sons reaction to us and youre wondering if I still want us to be togetheror rather if I can handle the two of us being together.\n\n\"Will you come back to my place?\" Olivia prodded.\n\nNatalia took a deep breath. \"No ...\" She could feel Olivias grip on her hand loosen, and then Olivia let it go entirely and clasped her hands together in her lap, where they now became the object of her acute scrutiny.\n\n\"Okay,\" Olivia said. \"I understand.\"\n\n\"I want you to come home with me tonight.\"\n\n\"I get it. I, uh ... what?\"\n\n\"I want you to spend the night with me at the farmhouse.\"\n\n\"You do? Are you sure? I mean ... well, I doubt Rafe would go back there right now, all things considered, but he might.\"\n\n\"Olivia, Im tired of waiting to start my life with you. Id really like for you to spend the night with me out there,\" Natalia said, covering Olivias entwined hands with one of her own. \"And I hope youll move back in sometime soon.\"\n\n\"Really? I cant believe it. I thought maybe ...\"\n\n\"That maybe since Rafe saw us together, Id change my mind about being with you?\"\n\n\"Well, yeah. After all, he is your son, and I know you care what he thinks.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do care. I wish hed reacted more like Daisy, that it was no big deal, that he was happy for me, for us, but you know what? Either Im going to live my own life or Im not.\"\n\n\"And youre going to live it?\n\n\"Yes, hopefully with you. Im in love with you, Olivia. I want to be with you all the time. I want you and Emma to come back home. Of course, I wish Rafe was willing to be a part of that, but I know he may never be. Either way, hes growing up and moving on with his life, and thats what I need to do, too.\"\n\n\"Move on with your life?\"\n\n\"Yes, and grow up. Remember when you told me I needed to grow a backbone?\"\n\n\"Well, yeah, but I was having a pretty difficult time back then, what with dying and all.\"\n\n\"I know, but you were right. That is what Ive needed to do. Maybe if Id done it sooner, my son wouldnt have done some of the things hes done.\"\n\n\"So youre not getting rid of me yet?\"\n\nNatalia smiled. \"I know you worry somethings going to happen thatll change my mind, but if my sons disapproval and ultimatum didnt do it, what possibly could?\"\n\n\"I dont know. It seems like the other shoe always drops.\"\n\n\"Maybe there is no other shoe, Olivia.\"\n\n\"God, I hope youre right.\"\n\n\"So, will you stay with me tonight at the farmhouse?\"\n\nOlivia grinned. \"Do you really need to ask? I mean ... thatd kind of be like a nine-month pregnant woman taking a pregnancy test, dont you think?\"\n\n\"As in no real need to check?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nNatalia laughed and hugged Olivia. She was just so funny and so sweetand now that Natalia had her in her arms, she was reminded that she was also incredibly sexy. \"Do you want to pick up anything at the hotel first?\" she asked, suddenly anxious to be with Olivia somewhere private.\n\n\"No, lets go. I always carry a toothbrush with me, and I can borrow anything else I might need from you, right?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Okay, lets go then,\" Olivia said as she began scooping things up and haphazardly tossing them into the picnic basket.\n\nNatalia had to grin at her obvious enthusiasm. How could you possibly think Id ever willingly give you up?\n\n******************************\n\nIt was dusk when they pulled up to the farmhouse. Olivia thought it looked beautiful in the diffused lighting between sunset and full night. The setting sun had tinted the landscape with a tinge of golden orange that encompassed both the sturdy structure and the profusion of shrubs and flowers she knew Natalia tended with loving care, while the diminishing light had encouraged dark shadows to stretch out lazily over the vast expanse of plush lawn, reaching toward the even darker tree line in the distance.\n\nThe truth was the farmhouse was the only place that had seemed like home to her since her mother died on the heels of their argument, leaving Olivia alone and pregnant from the childhood-robbing rape. Since then shed lived in a number of different places, but shed never felt at home, not even at the Beacon, which always seemed like a temporary dwelling. Even Emma recognized it wasnt a \"real\" home, not like the farmhouse where her little girl had happily thrived.\n\nAnd it wasnt just the farmhouse. It was Natalia. Natalia had created a home for all of them. It was her love and her caring and nurturing presence that had transformed the old Jessup farmhouse into a real home that had become a safe harbor for Olivia, much to her surprise. Of course, that hadnt been nearly as surprising as falling in love with the owner.\n\nShe stopped Natalia when she reached for the door handle of the car and pulled her back. \"Im so happy to be here with you,\" Olivia said softly. She kissed her, prolonging the intimacy until it occurred to her that even more fun things awaited them once they were inside. When she finally let Natalia go, she could see even in the dimming light that her dark eyes looked soft and unfocused.\n\n\"Im so happy youre here,\" Natalia said. \"And soon youll be here all the time.\"\n\nOlivia nodded. It was hard to believe that amount of happiness was within her grasp. Finally, Im going to get my happy ending.\n\nOnce they were inside, Natalia put away the remains of their picnic while Olivia headed upstairs to the bathroom to brush her teeth and wash up. After a few minutes, she could hear Natalia in the downstairs half bath, no doubt doing the same.\n\nAs soon as she finished, Olivia went down to the living room and turned on the radio, dialing through the local channel choices to find something befitting the mood. We really need to get you a sound system and some CDs, she thought. She could feel a swell of happiness at the thought of doing something as simple as shop for music together and spend time afterward listening to their selections.\n\nOlivia smiled when Natalia entered the room looking radiant just as she flipped to a channel that was just beginning to play Beyoncés version of \"At Last.\" She held out her hand to Natalia, who readily took it, and then she pulled her close. After all, it was a perfect slow dance song and her gorgeously curvy lover was the perfect slow dance partner.\n\n\"I love this song,\" Olivia whispered near Natalias ear.\n\nBeyoncé: At last my love has come along ...\n\n\"Me, too. Thats not the version Ive heard though.\" Natalia tucked her face into the crook of Olivias neck.\n\nBeyoncé: My lonely days are over and life is like a song.\n\n\"You might have heard Ella Fitzgerald or maybe Etta James, but I really love Beyoncés version.\" Olivia also loved the feel of Natalias warm breath on the sensitive skin of her neck.\n\nBeyoncé: At last the skies above are blue ...\n\nAs Olivia swayed slowly to the music with Natalia in her arms matching her movements, she listened to the lyrics describe her life and her feelings. At last shed found her true love, and finally her world was a happy place to inhabit. It felt as though the cavernous hole left in her heart at the age of sixteen with the loss of both her innocence and her mother was finally filled, and she could feel whole again.\n\nBeyoncé: My heart was wrapped up in clover the night I looked at you.\n\nShe loved the feel of their bodies pressed close together, moving in sync with the slow, sultry melody brought to life by Beyoncés flawless voice and sexy rendition.\n\nBeyoncé: I found a dream that I could speak to, a dream that I can call my own ...\n\nShe tipped Natalias head up to steal a little kiss, but the jolt of electricity that sparked through her body when their lips came into contact inspired her to deepen the kiss, suddenly needful of a closer connection than even slow dancing so close could provide.\n\nBeyoncé: I found a thrill to press my cheek to, a thrill that I have never known ...\n\nShe hadnt really intended for the \"little kiss\" to become so hot and heavy, not yet anyway, but her hormones had suddenly burst forth and were now raging through her body as the beloved lyrics floated around her, reminding her of the miracle of their love.\n\nBeyoncé: You smiled and then the spell was cast ...\n\nWhen you smile at me, I am totally undone, Olivia thought as she pulled back to look into Natalias eyes. As if on cue, Natalia smiled up at her, and she felt as though she could drown in that smile and those dimples. She glanced down. And that cleavage, she thought, suddenly anxious to move things upstairs.\n\nBeyoncé: And here we are in heaven, and you are mine at last.\n\nAs the ending strains of the song played, Olivia caressed Natalias cheek. \"Lets go upstairs.\"\n\nNatalia nodded, and Olivia took her hand and walked slowly toward the staircase. She felt as though shed never wanted her as much as she did at this very moment, and she paused to kiss her one last time before ascending the stairs.\n\nThe heat between them as they kissed was palpable, and Olivia knew Natalia could feel it as well. \"I want you so much,\" Olivia whispered.\n\nNatalia was just about to respond when they both heard the door into the kitchen open. \"That has to be Rafe,\" she said, abruptly pulling away from Olivia, who stayed by the stairs while Natalia moved through the living room toward the kitchen. She got as far as the couch when a man appeared in the doorway, but it wasnt her son.\n\n\"Frank! What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"I wanted to see you,\" Frank said with a good-natured grin.\n\n\"I told you not to just walk in here like this anymore.\"\n\n\"Oh, sorry. I knocked, but I guess you didnt hear me. I got worried, so I thought I better come in and check on you since I saw your car outside. Well, the Beacon car. Rafe told me about that.\"\n\nNatalia took a step back as Frank approached her. \"Im not alone.\"\n\n\"Is Rafe here? I only saw the one car.\"\n\nOlivia walked in view and stood next to Natalia. \"No, Im here, Frank.\" She could see a disturbing shadow pass over Franks face, but it was quickly replaced by a smile.\n\n\"I see,\" Frank said evenly. \"Well, thats okay.\"\n\nGee, Im so glad I have your approval.\n\n\"Frank, what are you doing here?\" Natalia asked.\n\nFranks eyes lingered on Olivias face, even though he spoke to the dark-haired woman he professed to love. \"I have a surprise for you, Natalia.\"\n\n\"I dont want any surprises, Frank,\" Natalia said.\n\n\"Oh, youre going to want this one,\" he said.\n\nOlivia found his confidence and his \"cat that swallowed the canary\" smile unbearableand a little worrisome. \"Just let him show you so we can get it over with,\" Olivia suggested, watching Frank warily.\n\nNatalias shoulders sagged noticeably. \"All right, fine. Show me.\"\n\n\"Its in the kitchen,\" Frank said, turning and heading back through the doorway.\n\nThe two women looked at each other and then followed in his wake. Olivia couldnt imagine what in the world Frank could have brought to Natalia that would leave him looking so smug.\n\nWhen they entered the kitchen, to her surprise she saw a man and a woman seated at the table. She didnt recognize them, though the woman looked familiar. Where have I seen you before? she wondered. The only thing betraying her age was a streak of gray Olivia could see here and there in her otherwise dark hair, which she wore pulled back into a tight bun at the nape of her neck. Her smooth and youthful-looking olive skin presented a stark contrast to the white at her temples, and Olivia idly thought if she colored her hair, shed look at least a decade younger.\n\nSuddenly Olivia realized Natalia was standing next to her in stunned silence, and with a shock she realized why the woman at the table looked familiar. She was an older version of Natalia. She looked down at her lover, who was standing stock-still with her mouth hanging slightly open as she stared unblinking at the older couple.\n\nOlivia tore her gaze away from Natalia and locked eyes with Frank, who glared back at her with an unmistakable look of triumph. She knew without doubt this was the other shoeat lastand with a sickening feeling that began in the pit of her stomach and was slowly bubbling up her digestive tract like bile and beginning to leave a bitter taste in the back of her throat, she realized that not only had the other shoe finally dropped, but it was a clodhopper of such massive proportions, she knew it was fully capable of blowing her happy little fantasy world to smithereens. And Natalias current near catatonic state wasnt at all reassuring, either.\n\nFucking hell! That bastard has finally found the one thing that could put an end to us.\n\n******************************\n\nChapter 85\n\nNatalia felt trapped in a vacuum, a space devoid of sound and light and even oxygen. The only thing she could see was her mothers facea visage that evoked childhood memories of the love and tenderness and safety shed experienced in her mothers arms. It was a face she had never expected to see again in this life, and the shock of seeing her now, of being in the same room with her, of seeing her beautiful and tentative smile as she gazed up at the daughter shed lost so many years ago, was too much to assimilate all at once, especially when it was so totally unexpected.\n\nAnd then even that one sight began to fade, and she felt herself slipping toward the flooruntil someone caught her around the waist and helped her to a nearby chair at the kitchen table across from the older couple who sat on the other side. Then she felt someone holding a cold, damp cloth to her forehead and then the back of her neck, and soon the womans face swam into view again.\n\n\"Mami?\" Natalia whispered.\n\n\"Mija,\" the older woman responded. She started to reach out toward Natalia, but stopped and glanced at the man sitting next to her.\n\nNatalia followed her gaze and saw a handsome man of medium height whose black hair was sprinkled liberally with white. Other than that he looked much the same as he had throughout her childhood, including the perennial stern expression he wore on his face as he stared at her across her kitchen table. As a little girl she had both adored and feared him. He was a strict disciplinarian, meting out corporal punishment with hand or belt or whatever object was close at hand when a little girls transgression, no matter how minor, triggered his temper. Hed always ruled over his household with the iron fist of a dedicated patriarch and the suffocating sense of entitlement engendered by his adherence to the worst manifestation of machismo tradition, which emphasized not only violence and aggressiveness, but also total domination of the females within his domain.\n\nLike her mother, Natalia waited nervously for her father to speak, barely aware of Olivias hand on her shoulder as she stood behind her. She could feel his eyes on her, scanning her, judging her, and she felt the same anxiety she had as a girl, knowing she was likely to come up lacking in his quick and cool appraisal.\n\n\"Perhaps some introductions are in order,\" the man said looking pointedly at Olivia, obviously the only person in the room he didnt know.\n\nNatalia swallowed hard, realizing she was already guilty of inexcusably poor manners. \"This is my ... my, uh ...\"\n\nFrank stepped forward, looking at Olivia with an air of condescension. \"This is Natalias employer, Olivia Spencer, owner of the Beacon, the hotel where she works. Olivia, these are Natalias parents, Ramón and Gloria Rivera.\"\n\n\"Its a pleasure to meet you,\" Mr. Rivera said to Olivia. \"Detective Cooper told us how well Natalias been doing since she turned her life around.\"\n\nTurned my life around? Uncertain what her father meant, Natalia started to look up at Olivia, but her fathers gaze was so intense as he stared at her across the table she couldnt pull her eyes away. It had always been like this around her father, whether hed caught her daydreaming when she should be doing chores or when shed had to confess to her parents that she was pregnant. There it was, the expression in his eyes that said once again shed failed to measure up to his expectations.\n\n\"Its nice to meet you, too,\" Olivia said. \"Both of you,\" she added, smiling down at Natalias mother.\n\nMr. Rivera smiled briefly at Olivia, but his smile faded when he looked back at his daughter. \"Frank tells us youve done quite well in your current job. He told us a little about what youve been doing since you moved here.\"\n\nNatalia wasnt sure what to say. It had always been hard not to get tongue-tied around her father, and apparently it was no different now that she was an adult.\n\n\"Shes wonderful in her job,\" Olivia said. \"I dont know what Id do without her.\"\n\nFor the first time he smiled at Natalia. \"Thats very good to hear,\" Mr. Rivera said.\n\nNatalia could hear the unspoken surprise in his voice that shed managed to acquire such a good job at all, let alone excel at it. She had more pressing concerns though. She turned to her mother with the one question she feared most to ask. \"Abuelita?\"\n\n\"Tu abuela está bien, mija. Se quedó en Chicago porque un viaje tan largo en coche le sería demasiado diícil.\"\n\nNatalia was overjoyed that her grandmother was still alive. In fact, she inferred from what her mother said that her beloved abuelita might have made the journey to see her if the trip from Chicago to Springfield werent so long.\n\n\"Maybe Olivia and I should leave the three of you alone to get caught up,\" Frank said, moving toward the door while he kept an eye on Olivia.\n\n\"Yes, I think thats a good idea,\" Mr. Rivera said. \"Except I think you should stay, Frank, since youre practically family.\"\n\nOf course Ill stay, if you wish,\" Frank said, grinning at Olivia.\n\n\"Natalia?\" Olivia squeezed Natalias shoulder.\n\nNatalia looked up at her, not knowing what to do or say. She felt as though a tsunami had blown into her life and was now carrying her swiftly in a direction of its choosing, which at the moment was away from the harbor where Olivia stood. Her emotions felt raw and her mind was darting frantically about trying to make sense of a universe now turned upside down. She knew she needed to respond to Olivia. \"I ...\" She looked back at her father.\n\n\"I dont have a way to leave. I came with Natalia in her car,\" Olivia said.\n\n\"Thats no problem,\" Frank said. \"Why not just take her car? Its a Beacon vehicle anyway, isnt it? We can always arrange for transportation for Natalia, and meanwhile youd be able to get back to your own place.\"\n\n\"Excellent solution,\" Mr. Rivera said.\n\n\"Are these the keys?\" Frank asked, picking up a set of keys from the key rack by the door. When Olivia nodded, he handed them to her.\n\nOlivia took them, but she looked down at Natalia again and touched her shoulder to get her attention. \"Natalia, do you want me to stay?\"\n\n\"My daughter will be fine, wont you, Natalia?\" Mr. Rivera said.\n\nNatalia looked down and nodded. The shock of seeing her parents again coupled with the sudden domineering presence of her father had left her teetering on the edge of a dangerously high emotional precipice, and all she could see below was the endless darkness of the abyss that awaited her if she made the smallest misstep.\n\n\"All right, call me if you need me,\" Olivia said.\n\nNatalia could feel Olivias eyes on her, but she was ashamed to look up. With her parents in the room, she no longer felt like the independent woman shed fought so hard to become, the woman Olivia was proud of and loved. She was once again the little girl who never managed to live up to expectations and therefore was a constant disappointment to her god-fearing parents, especially when she committed the unforgivable sin of getting pregnant as a young teen, and she knew that person was certainly not worthy of Olivias unwavering love.\n\n******************************\n\nOlivia paced back and forth in her penthouse suite impatient for Mayor Wolfe to show up. Shed called her on the way back to the Beacon, desperate for someone to talk to. When she finally heard a knock on the door, she hurried over and admitted Doris into her angst-ridden personal space.\n\n\"Whats up?\" Doris asked.\n\n\"Somehow Frank talked Natalias parents into coming over here from Chicago.\"\n\n\"Is that a problem?\"\n\nOlivia looked at Doris as if shed taken leave of her senses, but reminded herself the mayor probably had no way of knowing much if any about Natalias backstory. Hell, she herself knew precious little. \"Oh, I think its a big freakin problem,\" Olivia said.\n\n\"Look, why dont you just come sit down and tell me whats going on,\" Doris said, sitting on the couch.\n\nOlivia reluctantly followed Doris and dropped onto the sofa next to her, not certain if she could actually sit still while they talked. \"Natalia got pregnant when she was just a young girl, fifteen or sixteen, something like that,\" Olivia said. \"Her familys Catholic, and Ive always gotten the impression they were very strict. They insisted she give the baby up for adoption, but when she refused, they tossed her out. That was the last time she saw themtill Frank drove them over from Chicago today.\"\n\n\"Wow, that must have been a shocker. How did she take it?\"\n\n\"She nearly passed out. In fact, she would have fallen flat on her face if I hadnt caught her. I wet a towel with cold water and used it on her face and neck till she seemed to come to again, but the rest of the brief time I was there she seemed almost catatonic.\"\n\n\"Not good.\"\n\nOlivia pressed her fingers against her forehead, careful to avoid the still bruised area on the side, and began a slow massage. \"No, it really wasnt. In just the few minutes I spent with them, I learned a whole lot about why Natalias the way she is.\"\n\n\"Meaning?\"\n\n\"Her father was very ... domineering. Both her mother and Natalia herself seemed to allow him to completely control them. It was like she became another person.\" Olivias hand dropped back into her lap and she looked at Doris with a pained expression. \"I couldnt even find the woman I know in there anywhere. She just ... kind of vanished or something.\"\n\n\"Well, you said she was in a state of shock. You probably need to give her time to get her balance.\"\n\n\"Frankly, I just dont see that happening.\"\n\n\"Oh, come on, Olivia. Dont you think thats a bit hasty, not to mention harsh?\"\n\n\"Look, when I first met Natalia, she was hardworking and shed lived independently from the time shed gotten pregnant, but she didnt really have a lot of self-confidence and she certainly didnt stand up for herself. Now after meeting her father, I can see why she was like that. Hes an overbearing tyrant. I hated leaving her there with them.\"\n\n\"Why did you then?\"\n\nOlivia exhaled and leaned her head against the back of the couch. \"I kind of didnt have much of a choice.\"\n\n\"I dont know what that means. Theres always a choice.\"\n\n\"Frank suggested he and I leave so the three of them could talk.\"\n\n\"Thats not unreasonable.\"\n\n\"Sure, but I think that son of a bitch already knew her father would want him to staywhich he did. Im not sure what Frank told them, but Mr. Rivera said he was practically family, whatever the hell that means.\"\n\n\"I dont like the sound of that,\" Doris said. \"What do you think he told them?\"\n\nOlivia sat up again. \"Im afraid he may have told them they were engaged at one time and possibly implied that getting back together was inevitable.\"\n\nDoris peered into Olivias eyes. \"Listen to me, Olivia. Natalia loves you. Shes not going to marry Frank. Theres just no way.\"\n\n\"Earlier today I wouldve agreed, but you didnt see how she was around her father. She wilted. She cowered. She could barely stay conscious. It seemed like both she and her mother looked to him for permission to breathe. It was ... horrifying,\" Olivia said. \"You probably think Im exaggerating, but Im really not.\"\n\nDoris was quiet for a moment. \"I know youre not. Do you know much about traditional Hispanic culture, specifically machismo? I only ask because it sounds like thats what youre dealing with here.\"\n\n\"Well, sure, I know what machismo means.\"\n\n\"I mean do you understand the ramifications of it within a family setting?\" Doris asked.\n\n\"Im not sure what youre driving at.\" And youre really starting to give me a headache. The truth was Olivias entire body hurt, as though shed received a literal physical blow. One minute shed been headed up the stairs with the love of her life, and the next minute Natalia seemed to surrender all control to the man whod thrown her out of the house when she was just a girl. Thats just not right! If I were Natalia, Id have told him to get the hell outta my house!\n\n\"Theres more than one interpretation of machismo, even among different Hispanic cultures,\" Doris said. \"At its best it means the man is strong and responsible, the protector of his family, and there are certainly some Hispanic men who are like that; but the other less savory manifestation of machismo, which is what I suspect youre dealing with here, means the man exemplifies some of the worst possible qualities.\"\n\n\"Like what?\" Olivia asked.\n\n\"The macho man is dominating. Hes physically aggressive and uncompromising with other males, and because he views women as inferior, hes often sexually aggressive and domineering with them. Hes sometimes violent, not only with his wife, but also with his children. Some of this attitude is intertwined with the Catholic religion, in that the woman, like the Virgin Mary, is expected to be pure when she marries and must then stay faithful to her husband, while at the same time the man, in the spirit of machismo, is entitled to have sex with any woman he chooses.\"\n\n\"Jesus! How do you know all this?\"\n\n\"Legal research back when I was DA,\" Doris said. \"I learned a lot about the worst type of machismo back then and the harm it can cause, the type of stuff that gets these violent men prosecuted by people like me. Image is everything to this type of man. Hell fight, hell brutalize, hell even kill to protect his manly image, and within that culture its not only accepted, but expected for the man to act out in that way.\"\n\n\"Thats not good,\" Olivia said. God, and to think I left her out there with him. I should have just gone upstairs and waited.\n\n\"No, it really isnt.\"\n\n\"So ... if thats the kind of man were dealing with hereand based on the little I saw, I think it isthen Natalia grew up in a strict Catholic home with all this machismo crap that meant her father was the undisputed cock of the walk while she and her mother were inferior beings under his control just because they were female.\"\n\n\"Yes, thats what Im saying,\" Doris said.\n\n\"So when Natalia got pregnant, it wasnt just that she sinned against the church, but that she caused her macho father to lose face because she defiled her body by having sex with a boy and getting pregnant before she got married.\"\n\n\"Yes, Id also assume thats why he was adamant she give the baby up for adoption. They might have been able to hide the pregnancy that way, maybe by sending her away for a few months and saying she was visiting relatives out of town or whatever, and then he could have saved face. However, she refused to give up her baby, so he threw her out as the only way for him to save face in any way.\"\n\nGod, this is a lot to take in, but it sure would explain a lot. Olivias mind rambled over various aspects of Natalias background in context with Doriss extemporaneous lecture on machismo. \"I just had a horrible thought.\"\n\n\"Okay, tell me.\"\n\n\"Im going to take a wild guess that within this tradition, this machismo tradition, same-sex relationships are very much frowned on.\"\n\n\"Thats right,\" Doris said. \"By definition they would be exactly contradictory to the precepts of machismo, for both males and femalesmales because being gay would be the exact opposite of being macho, and females because they were not properly subjugated to a male.\"\n\n\"So Natalia would not only have the church telling her its wrong, but shed also have her fatherand her mother, by extension, since she seemed so completely under his thumbadamantly opposed to any kind of relationship like that, right?\"\n\n\"Im afraid thats exactly right.\"\n\nOlivia leaned back against the couch again and closed her eyes. \"I am so fucked.\"\n\n******************************\n\nAs soon as Olivia left, Frank sat on the chair next to Natalia. \"Maybe your parents would like something to drink, Natalia.\"\n\nNatalia was horrified at her gaffe. \"Im so sorry,\" she said rising from her chair and taking a step toward the refrigerator. \"May I get you somethingcoffee, tea? Theres even some lemonade.\"\n\nHer father shook his head. \"No, we stopped at Franks restaurant on the way here to have dinner. I think we should talk about the future.\"\n\nNatalia drifted back to her chair and sank back down onto it, still mortified she hadnt thought to offer refreshments to her own parents, one more unforgivable social blunder. \"What about the future?\"\n\n\"Frank tells us Rafael is starting college this fall,\" Mr. Rivera said.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Even though the boy has been in so much trouble with the law,\" Mr. Rivera continued.\n\nNatalia could feel the blood drain from her face, aware of the condemnation of her parenting implicit in that statement. She looked down at the table, too ashamed to meet her fathers scathing gaze. \"Yes,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Obviously the problem is the boys never had a strong male role modeluntil Frank, of course, since his own father died before he could really take the boy in hand and get his life turned around.\"\n\n\"Hes doing really well right now,\" Natalia said.\n\n\"Hes a felon whos still seeing a parole officer, correct?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Natalia felt as though she were on trial and the verdict headed her way wasnt going to be good.\n\n\"Then I would say you had the right idea when you agreed to marry Frank.\"\n\n\"We ... uh ... we didnt get married.\"\n\n\"Yes, Frank told us there were problems that delayed the wedding, but surely theres nothing standing in the way now.\"\n\nNatalia couldnt believe her father actually expected her to marry Frank. She cast a sidelong glance at Frank, who was simply listening calmly, his face carefully devoid of expression. \"We ... we cant ...\"\n\n\"Natalia!\" Mr. Rivera leaned forward, arms resting on the kitchen table.\n\nNatalia recoiled from the angry tone in her fathers voice, just as she used to as a little girl.\n\n\"You finally have a chance to turn your life around, to make up for your past mistakes, to do the right thing by your son, who needs a strong man like Frank to guide him,\" Mr. Rivera said, \"and thats exactly what youre going to do.\"\n\nNatalia felt ill, emotionally and physically. Why had her happy world turned into a nightmare?\n\n******************************\n\nAfter Doris left, Olivia headed down to the Beacon bar, too agitated to sit alone in her penthouse suite. She briefly debated returning to the farmhouse, but she was concerned that if she did, it might make matters even worse. She decided itd be far better to wait until she could talk to Natalia alone. Meanwhile her nerves were so on edge she felt an overwhelming need to self-medicate, hence the trip downstairs to her favorite watering hole.\n\nShe was surprised to see Angelica behind the bar. \"Wheres Brandon?\" Olivia asked.\n\n\"He wanted to go to a wedding, so I said Id cover for him tonight,\" Angelica said. \"May I get you something?\"\n\n\"Vodka, and keep em coming,\" Olivia said. \"Make it the good stuff.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Angelica said with a sweet smile.\n\n\"And bring me a big glass. I dont want one of those little thimble-sized ones.\"\n\nOlivia noted Angelica was quick to set a coaster and medium-sized tumbler of vodka in front of her, much to her approval. She drained the glass without taking a breath, set it back on the coaster, and tapped the side.\n\nAngelica quickly refilled it.\n\nSmart girl, Olivia thought as she tossed back her second drink. Didnt even try to get me to go for a screwdriver like Brandon did the time I sat here and got plastered on his watch right after the argument at the spa. \"Just leave the bottle here,\" she told the pretty blonde bartender.\n\n\"Yes, of course, Miss Spencer. Just let me know if theres anything else I can get you.\"\n\nOlivia nodded and poured herself a third drink, which she drank more slowly. Oh, "
