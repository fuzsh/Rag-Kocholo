        "text": "Pediatric neurology is the study of neurological conditions in neonates, infants, children and teens. A pediatric neurologist is a doctor who takes care of early brain health and treats children who have problems with their nervous system—the brain, spine, nerves and muscles—which can lead to problems like seizures, headaches or developmental delays in kids.\n\nPediatric Neurological Conditions We Treat\n\nIn the Neurology Program at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, our team of specialists provides care for rare and common pediatric neurological conditions, including but not limited to:\n\nAcute disseminated encephalomyelitis\n\nAnti-NMDA receptor encephalitis\n\nComplex autism spectrum disorder with a neurological component\n\nCerebral palsy\n\nNeurodevelopmental disabilities\n\nEpilepsy and seizure disorders\n\nFacioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy\n\nHeadaches and migraines\n\nInfantile spasms\n\nLeukodystrophy\n\nMovement disorders\n\nMultiple sclerosis\n\nMuscular dystrophy\n\nMyasthenia gravis\n\nMyopathies\n\nNeurocutaneous syndrome\n\nNeurofibromatosis\n\nNeurometabolic and neurogenetic disorders\n\nNeuromyelitis optica\n\nNeuropathy\n\nPsychogenic non epileptic events (PNEE)\n\nRett syndrome\n\nReye syndrome\n\nSleep disorders with a neurological component\n\nSpasticity\n\nSpells\n\nStroke\n\nTic disorders\n\nTourette syndrome\n\nTransverse myelitis\n\nTraumatic brain injury\n\nTuberous sclerosis complex\n\nOur pediatric neurologists work with other specialists throughout Children’s to provide comprehensive, effective care for each patient. Treatment is tailored to your child’s needs, and we work with you at every stage so you will know what to expect. Our team of specialists combines the latest diagnostic, treatment and neuroimaging technology with a caring, child-friendly approach to deliver unique treatment options based on each child’s condition and needs.\n\nIn addition, our Neurology Program offers many multispecialty clinics for patients who need to see several specialists. These clinics improve the patient experience and allow families easier access to the specialized, coordinated, multidisciplinary care their children need.\n\nOur comprehensive programs and clinics, which aim to provide complete, effective care for your child, include:\n\nConcussion Program: Our goal is to educate the public about the dangers of concussions. We help kids and teens safely return to school and sports after a concussion.\n\nDevelopmental Neurology Program: Our interdisciplinary team provides comprehensive care, evaluation and treatment for neurodevelopmental disorders in infants, toddlers, school-age children and adolescents. We provide families with comprehensive feedback on their child’s diagnosis, his strengths and weaknesses, and recommendations for medical or neurological testing and therapeutic interventions. We also manage complex neurological needs in children with developmental delays and autism.\n\nEpilepsy Center: Our Comprehensive Epilepsy Center is a Level 4 pediatric epilepsy center, according to the National Association of Epilepsy Centers (NAEC)—its highest level of designation. We have an eight bed Epilepsy Monitoring Unit with 24/7 monitoring. We provide neurodiagnostic monitoring, clinical trials, and surgical and nonsurgical treatment options.\n\nLeukodystrophy Clinic: Our multidisciplinary clinic is made up of providers from neurology, physiatry, physical therapy and social work and provides a care plan specific to each patient. Through education, research, comprehensive care, and overall understanding and support, we hope to improve the lives of the children diagnosed with leukodystrophies and their families.\n\nNeurogenetic/Metabolic Clinic: We specialize in the evaluation and long-term neurological care of children with suspected genetic and metabolic diseases causing neurologic symptoms. Those symptoms may include developmental delay, hypotonia, macrocephaly, microcephaly, seizures and movement disorders.\n\nNew Onset Seizure Clinic: Our team specializes in providing comprehensive care to children who have experienced one or more seizures. We aim to provide a care plan specific for each patient and provide education and support for patient families.\n\nTransition to Adult Care: We are dedicated to helping make the transition to adulthood and adult-focused neurological care as smooth as possible. Our goal is to provide our teen neurology patients—starting around age 14—with the education, skills and resources needed for a successful transfer from pediatric to adult healthcare. We want our patients to feel empowered to manage and navitate their own health care to the best of their ability, advocate for themselves, and seek the resources they need during their transition to adult care.\n\nTuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) Clinic: In partnership with the Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance, the Children’s Comprehensive Epilepsy Center offers the TSC Clinic. The first of its kind in Georgia, the clinic coordinates an annual visit with up to seven different physicians to help make sure patients with TSC have access to pediatric specialists. This thorough review is then provided to the patient family and the patient’s primary care physician.\n\nOther multispecialty clinics include:\n\nComplex Headache Program\n\nEpileptic Encephalopathy Clinic\n\nInfantile Spasms Clinic\n\nIntractable Epilepsy Clinic\n\nKetogenic Diet Program\n\nNeonatal Neurology Clinic\n\nNeuroimmunology and Multiple Sclerosis Clinic\n\nPsychogenic Nonepileptic Seizure (PNES) Clinic\n\nStroke and Neurovascular Clinic\n\nTreating the highest volumes of patients with neurological disorders, Children’s is one of the top places for training the next generation pediatric neurologists and sub specialists. We recruit four pediatric neurology residents a year who would go through five years rigorous training from the most experienced faculty in pediatrics, adult neurology and pediatric neurology. We also have pediatric epilepsy fellowship program, training two pediatric epilepsy fellows a year.\n\nChildren’s has teamed up with Emory University, Georgia Institute of Technology and Morehouse School of Medicine to form the Children’s Center for Neurosciences Research. The shared goal of this consortium is to find leading-edge therapies for children with brain and spine conditions to transform care and improve outcomes.\n\nAs one of the largest pediatric neurology programs in the country, paired with some of the brightest minds in pediatric neurosciences research, Children’s is dedicated to seeking preventive, diagnostic and wellness strategies for children with serious medical illnesses or challenges. Caring for more pediatric neurological patients than any other hospital in the country, we are committed to the study of brain tumors and traumatic injuries as well as the psychological and cognitive aspects of disease and injury.\n\nOur dedication to pediatric neurology, developing innovative treatments for tomorrow and improving outcomes for kids are just a few of the many reasons why our neurology program continually ranks among the top in the nation.\n\nHaving a child diagnosed with a neurological condition can be an emotional and overwhelming experience. At Children’s, our No. 1 priority is to support you and your family. Whether treating a toddler during an emergency or helping a teen through recovery after surgery, we make it our mission to provide the best care—and best experience—for every child. Family is a big part of your child’s well-being. Not only are you a vital member of your child’s healthcare team; you are a source of security and comfort.\n\nU.S. News & World Report ranks us among the top pediatric neurology and neurosurgery programs in the country.\n\nOur doctors work closely with neurologists in the community to help ensure multi-disciplinary, comprehensive care is delivered seamlessly at our hospitals.
