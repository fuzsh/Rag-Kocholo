        "text": "Spelivia fans, rejoice! Spencer James (Daniel Ezra) and Olivia (Samantha Logan) tied the knot on the “All American” Season 6 finale, which aired on July 15, marking Ezra’s final episode as a series regular.\n\nThe episode, titled “I Do (Part II),” picked up where the penultimate left off — Spencer finding out that the wedding venue had been flooded and his wedding to Olivia wasn’t going to be available to happen. At first, Olivia began to spiral, questioning not only their future but their past, remembering so many hiccups along the way. (The CW always has loved a montage!)\n\nSpencer, now an NFL player based in New York, couldn’t push back training camp but refused to wait another year to get married. So, he secretly spent the day planning a wedding in the backyard of his childhood home, “where it all began,” he told her. The community then planned a surprise reception, completely transforming the town basketball court into the perfect dance floor and dinner venue. It was a good thing since the newlyweds had a fully choreographed dance routine planned for their first dance.\n\nElsewhere in the finale, Jordan (Michael Evans Behling) and Layla (Greta Onieogou) finally found a home — his childhood one. After Laura (Monet Mazur) learned they’d been looking for a home, she realized that since everyone had moved out, hers was just a house now. So, she transferred the deed into their name. Meanwhile, Coop (Bre-Z) found out that she got into not one, but two law schools, including Yale. While she didn’t feel deserving, Spencer had one last heart-to-heart with her — on the swings in Crenshaw, of course — to reassure her that she was worthy.\n\nWhile the episode was the last for Ezra, “All American” has been renewed for a seventh season, so it was only fitting to throw in one cliffhanger. During the wedding, Jordan approached his grandfather, GW (Brent Jennings), about a baby picture he found of a mysterious person who looked like his dad. GW didn’t want to talk about it but after some convincing, finally revealed that Billy (Taye Diggs) had a brother.\n\nAlthough Spencer and Olivia are moving to New York and Ezra is not set to return, no announcement has been made about Browning’s future on the drama."
