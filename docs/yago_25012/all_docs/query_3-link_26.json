        "text": "Today’s post is by a guest writer. I got to know her on Twitter and I think she must be one of Doris Wolfe and Blake Marler’s biggest fans. I asked her to provide some insights on Doris’s character. I think it’s of special interest to Manny fans because Doris prosecuted both Danny and Michelle for murder very aggressively on very little evidence (Michelle was framed by a story with gaping holes, Danny was accused of killing Carmen who was actually alive). I think the following essay helps to explain why. It also mentions in passing the pairing, never really given screen time, but with a devoted online following, of the Blake-Doris pairing known as Bliss.\n\nWho is Doris Wolfe: The Woman Behind the Mask\n\nby Gift of Amber\n\nManipulative, power-hungry, hypercritical, overbearing, coffee-addicted, sharp-tongued are all words that would describe Mayor Doris Wolfe to the average citizen of Springfield, however, they provide only a superficial understanding because Doris always kept her true self hidden behind a mask. Careful analysis shows that Doris was motivated by a desire for love and acceptance, which she truly believed she wouldn’t get from the town of Springfield if she showed them her true self and on some level believed she didn’t deserve.\n\nWas her character always a lesbian or was it a spontaneous decision by the writers to re-write history? The answer is probably a mix of both. Doris, despite having been a character on the show for 10 years and of nubile age, had never had a love scene. She showed mild flirtation with men, and kissed and married Alan Spaulding (because she thought she would get more acceptance from the town if she had the Spaulding name to back her up), but she never actually slept with him. Sure, this was due to circumstances beyond her control (Alan being shot and divorcing her after finding out Ashlee was the one who shot him), but it was abundantly clear that the match was purely business related and not for love. Also, Doris had her daughter via an anonymous sperm donor at a sperm bank. While relatively common in real life for straight women to use a sperm bank, in soap opera land, it is very rare.\n\nDoris had a very complicated relationship with her daughter. She loved her daughter and admitted she’d had a daughter because she wanted someone who would love her unconditionally, but sometimes she went a little overboard. She was incredibly critical of her daughter, expecting her to live up to standards no one could, while at the same time, using her political clout to keep her daughter emotionally dependent solely on her. She did everything in her power to keep Ashlee away from the Coopers because she was petrified of losing her. In a very telling scene, Doris cries to Ashlee that she was always picked last on sports teams (the manipulative part) and what she wanted more than anything was to be *chosen* first (the truth). She wanted Ashlee to choose her above all other people, and she was willing to do anything and say anything to make that happen, including “trumping up charges” against them (her specialty), all because she didn’t believe she deserved Ashlee’s love all on her own, which could easily be construed as internalized homophobia.\n\nDoris first appeared as an attorney during the trial where Blake Marler falsely accused Ben Warren of raping her. As time went on, she argued some very high profile cases, including the Annie Dutton trial,the Michelle Bauer trial, and the Danny Santos trial, and seemed very willing to bend the law to win those cases while holding everyone else to an unbelievably high moral standard. In fact, Doris seemed to cling to the moral high ground so much it was as though she were trying to make up for something really terrible (internalized homophobia). Doris justified leaving her own daughter in juvenile detention after she was arrested for shooting Alan when she could have gotten Alan to testify on Ashlee’s behalf by saying that Ashlee needed to pay for what she had done. A woman who was comfortable with herself would never have sacrificed her daughter for the moral high ground or a political campaign. Buzz Cooper managed to get through to Doris on how her behavior was affecting her daughter, but he didn’t address the root of the issue, as he didn’t know what it was, so eventually, Doris went back to being her hypercritical self. Finally, Doris took her moral high ground a little too far and went head to head with Olivia Spencer over the definition of family, i.e. the infamous ‘My Two Mommies’ speech by little Emma Spencer. Olivia, being Olivia, wouldn’t let it go until she picked up on the secret Doris had been hiding from everyone she cared about, finally giving Doris a chance to grow as a character and eventually tell Ashlee her big secret, the reason she was who she was, and when Ashlee finally accepted her, she began to love herself a little bit and realized that not only did she deserve love and happiness, she didn’t have to look behind every corner expecting someone to sabotage her. Trusting people was still very difficult for her (the only main text on-screen relationship we saw of Doris with another woman was clearly a pleasurable business arrangement as we saw Doris offering her money in an earlier scene).\n\nSpeaking of pleasurable business arrangements, Doris, unlike many characters, viewed a physical relationship as being entirely separate from and a potential precursor to an emotional relationship. This went directly back to her trust issues; for her, it was easier to trust someone with her body than with her heart. Several stories interpret her inability to trust women with her heart to only apply to straight women, which if Doris had been “out” may have been true, but realistically, Doris had difficulty trusting *anyone*, man, woman, straight, lesbian, “whatever this is”, bisexual, etc. because any of them could have “exposed” her to the world and “ruined” her relationship with her daughter.\n\nAnother indication that the writers may have intended her character to be a lesbian from the beginning was Doris’s coffee addiction. Doris almost always seemed to be holding a coffee cup. For some reason, “going out for coffee” has become a huge lesbian stereotype, and coffee shops are places where people suggest newly out lesbians go to meet other lesbians. Of course, her coffee addiction could also merely have been a sign of her interest in the lovely redhead pouring the coffee (who could blame her?) or just a manifestation of her anxiety; one of the questions left open to interpretation as a result of the show ending its run on CBS. The end of Guiding Light did end with hope for Doris as a character. Although for all intents and purposes she appeared to be single, she also appeared to be happy and more comfortable with herself, which was the perfect mindset to be in to start a new relationship. Guiding Light’s mantra from the final theme song “only love can save the world” applied to Doris in that she had been saved by friendship, acceptance, and love of herself, which really is the best kind of love.\n\nAnother in our efforts to answer FAQs.\n\nFAQ: Why doesn’t Harley Cooper paint the walls?\n\nWhen I check to see what searches bring people to this site, one of the frequent search is about Harley Cooper’s walls. What happened was this – when Phillip first came back from Arizona determined to get revenge on whatever family member (he wasn’t sure for a long while who – it was Alan) that had arranged his exile and reclaim his rightful place. Beth was frightened that this would turn him in the Alan-clone that he sometimes could be and so filed for divorce to try to force his hand to give it up and return for her. When he instead allowed the divorce to proceed Beth felt that the worst had already happened and Phillip was lost. Cut ahead almost a year and Phillip had found first friendship and then love with his once and future sister-in-law Harley Cooper. Then Beth returned and she tried to win him back. Harley felt that despite the storied Pheth history that Harley herself understood Phillip better than Beth and that they belonged together. Phillip temporarily chose Harley and they eloped and then bought a new house. This new house was multi-storied and very southwestern complete with a red tile roof and adobe walls.\n\nFlash forward a few more years when Harley found out that Beth shockingly enough really HAD understood Phillip better than she did, all along. Harley decided then that Phillip had become evil incarnate and treated him accordingly helping to propel his descent to madness. When Gus and Harley’s efforts to stop Phillip from recreating Springfield according to his new all Spaulding design, Phillip got his revenge by knocking down the house that he had bought for Harley and still retained legal ownership to. Harley couldn’t stop him, but did get legal ownership of the now empty lot.\n\nGus and Harley slowly began to rebuild the house which at first seemed to be about the same size as the one they lost, but then turned into what seemed to be a sort of modified ranch on a much more modest scale. It was not finished for years. As their portrayers said in an interview “Harley and Gus seemed to run out of money about the same time the show did.” This lead them to having obviously unfinished walls for a long time – years in fact. Actually the unfinished walls outlasted the marriage. It wasn’t until Gus died in a tragic motorcycle accident (that lead to his heart being transplanted into Olivia Spencer saving her life and ultimately spawning Otalia) that the Cooper family was spurred to finish off the house in a sort of barn raising type family gathering. Shortly after that Harley also left the show and Marina and Mallet purchased the now finished house.\n\nUPDATED July 30 2016: I did some light editing, fixing a few minor points, and adding a better description of the Pharley house before it was knocked down. I also added my current signature block.\n\nUPDATED August 2 2017: I noticed two typos and fixed them.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.

They are aiming to raise $15,000 for Doctors Without Borders in honor of both the character and the actor (who asked fans not to send him any more presents). When I write this they were up to $11,500. This is a worthy cause and I support and applaud the effort to create something good out of this tragedy. I also salute the fans gathering the money because I’ve done that for group donations before and it’s really a lot of work. http://bit.ly/9xS7VB Since my initial write up they have passed $15,000 and are now trying for $20,000.\n\nClick on the Posted in “GL Cast Update” category below for more posts about keeping up with the Springfielders.\n\nAs we approach the one year anniversary of the cancellation, I think I finally have enough distance to fairly judge what they called the “new” format of Guiding Light that moved from the traditional 3 wall sets and pedestal cameras to handheld cameras and permanent sets, with lots of outdoor shooting.\n\nWhen the new production model was introduced Ellen Wheeler specifically said it was not about saving money. When the show was canceled she said the model bought them a year and a half, BY saving money. Hmmm. But let’s take her at her word and think about how this new production model stands on its own merits.\n\nI remained faithful to the show, even at its obvious nadir so my impression is different than some of those people whose loyalty lapsed. I’m not comparing it to the comparative heyday of the late 1990s to early 2000s, but to what the show was actually doing right before the switch. It was pretty clear that something had to change. Whether the changes Wheeler made were the right ones, is, for the sake of the remaining soaps, worth examining.\n\nCon:\n\nSound – Sound was a problem in the new format from day 1 and while it did improve considerably from year 1 to year 2, frankly I was to the point where I would have welcomed obvious lavaliere mics or even those Broadway/fast food drive through style over the ear, extend in front of mouth mics if it meant a consistent sound level. On a normal day sound would have to be adjusted on your set, several times, or key lines would be lost.\n\nPacing of scenes – The last few months I was doing a daily summary of the show (you can find those descriptions by clicking on the July, August, and September 2009 blog entries) and from that experience I can tell you that a long scene was a minute, most were less than that. The last two days I thought something was wrong because I didn’t have as many times in my descriptions. I realized that it was because the average length of the scene had approximately doubled to roughly 2 minutes. The short scenes were supposed to be compensating for the lack of a an ability to block on smaller sets (again from a quote from Wheeler), but even lengthening the scenes by that much (let’s face it 2 minutes is still a pretty short scene) improved the pace rhythm and flow of the show to a marked extent. Watch an episode, even from early on in that last week and then one of the last two days and see if you don’t agree. This length and pacing was an executive decision, not one forced by money or circumstances and was clearly a wrong one and was not one that was experimented with, even though there was just over a year and a half in which multiple things could have been adjusted and tried.\n\nThe overall pace was also accelerated to the point of near lunacy. For example, the trial over whether or not Reva should be forced to have her baby early to save her own life lasted a day, including her husband Jeffery deciding to sue her, filing the suit, both parties switching lawyers twice, etc. plus the actual trial. I just re-watched Mattessa go through the same thing and they spent a week just debating whether Matt should take Vanessa to trial or not. You can’t react to plot points when they spin by at supersonic speed.\n\nStory – However, I think what was the real problem was the writing. Even when the writers and executives found couple magic Bizzie, Otalia, Lillibuzz, etc. They seemed to have no concept what to do with it, other than to torment fans with what might have been. Characters lost throughlines and purpose and wandered around blindly and aimlessly from one lame plot point nobody who knew the characters really bought to another. This dramatically changed with Phillip’s return and although the writing still creaked sometimes, and scenes still seemed to miss important points in their rush to get to what was basically filler, and other beloved character’s returns were promised and promptly ignored (really only Phillip and Ed got the treatment they deserved and that includes then recurring, but classic characters like Rick who technically never left the show, but had virtually disappeared from the canvas). Still it was SOOOO much better than in the year before Phillip came back that I’m at a loss for words to try to explain how much better it was.\n\nPro:\n\nOwn Houses – People could live in their own houses again. If you didn’t personally experience it, day in and day out, I can’t tell you how painful it was watching them try to shoehorn scenes either into the one lousy hotel room at the Beacon everybody lived in or “Main Street.” Actually it was painful from the beginning, but it only got worse as time went on. Bless the new format for letting us go other places again.\n\nReturn to more classic formula – Looking back now, really many of the things that were tried in the name of realism where just how things were in the early days of TV soap in the 1950s. For example, in both times people wore their own clothes. It may just be that the 1970s-1980s were the exception and production values need to be readjusted. I think this is entirely reasonable and think it should be fairly looked at. However, just because one set of compromises was tried doesn’t mean that’s the only set that could be tried or the best set to try. I think other soaps, both network and web, will continue to try out different versions of these compromises from when soaps had the money to buy pretty much whatever they wanted. A change in production values may just be a return to reality and I think soap fans can accept that.\n\nOutside – Outside looked like outside again. When I was little and watched Laurel Falls we were really out in the country AT Laurel Falls. By the time my beloved Manny got there, it was a set with a fake big rock. This model let outside be really outside again and I think having scenes set at the exteriors of locations we knew, even if they looked different than before (Company, the police station, etc.) really added to flavor of the show and made it feel more real, especially after all that time cooped up on the “Main Street” set. Again you really had to experience “Main Street/Beacon” day in and day out to feel the claustrophobia that set engendered to truly appreciate this difference.\n\nPhillip – Phillip was back. The storylines really should be separated for the last 2 years of GL’s existence to Pre- and Post-Phillip. His return energized the storylines and sharpened the throughlines of so many characters that while there were still some fairly audible “clunks” it was soooo much better after Phillip came back.\n\nSummary:\n\nSo, in summary, I think the new system could have worked. Many of the problems were not inherent in the style of studio or production model or even the fast pace of production. They were separate issues that could have been dealt with caused by bad choices that were deliberately made. I don’t think it was the money saving format that ultimately led to the destruction of the show, but more on decisions made by then executives coupled with a loss of support from the network due to the loss of a strong leader in the CBS daytime division and the obvious decision by CBS (not announced, but clear from choices they have made) to no longer attempt to do any programming directed primarily at women and children (that doesn’t involve the CEO’s wife). While they used to court a viewer cradle to grave, now if you a not a young man in their prime or like shows that also appeal to that age group, what is CBS offering you? Nothing.\n\nUpdate August 27, 2015: Just a few minor edits to improve a couple of the sentences.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.
