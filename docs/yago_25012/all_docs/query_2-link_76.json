        "text": "I am a Professor of Pediatrics and Director of the Heart and Mind Wellbeing Center at Cincinnati Children’s. My team and I have been conducting research in the field of heart disease and mental health for more than 15 years. I received my training at the University of Sydney in Australia, earning a bachelor’s degree in Psychology and a PhD in Medical Psychology. At the Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network, I developed one of the first psychology programs dedicated to caring for patients and families affected by pediatric and congenital heart disease. My research focuses on understanding how early adversity can alter developmental processes, including brain development, neurodevelopment, emotion regulation and stress reactivity, increasing vulnerability to mental health conditions later in life. In 2018, I came to the United States on a Harkness Fellowship in Health Care Policy and Practice at Harvard Medical School and in 2020, I was thrilled to join Cincinnati Children’s to develop and lead the Heart and Mind Wellbeing Center. I love being out in nature and cheering on my favorite sports teams!\n\nI am a Pediatric Psychologist with the Heart and Mind Wellbeing Center, where I focus on the health and wellbeing of children with cardiac conditions and their families. I earned my Bachelor’s degree at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and my Master’s degree and PhD in Clinical Psychology at the University of Buffalo in New York. I enjoy yoga, baking, tennis, and gardening. My first career was working in theater, film and documentaries in New York City.\n\nI am a lifespan neuropsychologist with the Heart and Mind Wellbeing Center. My primary role is to help older adolescents and adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) understand the relationship between the heart and the brain, and how their heart condition may impact their functioning. I earned my bachelor's degree from Florida International University and my doctorate in psychology with an emphasis in neuropsychology from Albizu University, both in Miami, Florida. I completed my clinical psychology internship at Jackson Health System in affiliation with the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, and my neuropsychology fellowship at Akron Children’s Hospital.\n\nI am also a lifelong gamer. My game of choice has been World of Warcraft for the past 14 years, and I don’t see that stopping any time soon. Gaming started out as a simple pastime and evolved into an activity I now engage in with my whole family. I find it exciting that my personal interest in gaming facilitates stronger connections with many of my patients.\n\nI am a child life specialist with the Heart and Mind Wellbeing team. My research interests include finding new ways to provide emotional and mental health support for children with congenital heart disease and their families. I’m also interested in how congenital heart disease affects a person’s mental health and neurodevelopment, and how child life interventions can help. I earned my master’s degree in psychology at Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee, and my master’s degree in child studies at Vanderbilt University (also in Nashville). Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, trying new recipes, and being outdoors.\n\nView Emily Jones, MS, MEd, CCLS's Full Bio\n\nAs a social worker at Cincinnati Children's Heart and Mind Wellbeing Center, I support patients and their families dealing with heart disease. I meet families where they are in their lives, collaborate on ways to increase their support and connect them to providers who can support the progress they would like to make.\n\nI support families in identifying their strengths so we can work together to determine how to use them to meet their needs. I use a person-centered approach to allow the family to be the guide on their journey while working collaboratively to develop the best ways to support them.\n\nWhen I’m not at work, I enjoy reading as many books as possible and spending time with my animals and friends. I love to spend time outside hiking, camping and learning as much as I can about nature.\n\nI am a Clinical Research Coordinator with the Heart and Mind Wellbeing Center. My previous role at Cincinnati Children’s centered around positive parenting programming and interventions to improve health outcomes for mothers with depression and their children. I am thrilled to continue in a role that aligns with my interests in optimizing parental mental health outcomes and supporting families affected by congenital heart disease. I earned my bachelor’s degree in Sociology and Criminal Justice at the University of Dayton, Ohio and my master’s degree in Social Work at the University of Louisville in Kentucky. I’m originally from Louisville but have been living in Cincinnati since 2016. In my spare time, I love checking out everything the city has to offer, especially the amazing food scene, beautiful parks, sports events, art festivals, and concerts!\n\nI am a Clinical Research Coordinator with the Heart and Mind Wellbeing Center. I am passionate about creating the best experience possible for people who participate in our research studies. As a research coordinator, I am especially interested in learning more about how major medical diagnoses and chronic illnesses impact the mental health of children as they grow up. Before coming to Cincinnati Children’s, I earned my bachelor’s degree in Psychology from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Outside of work, I like swimming, watching the latest shows and movies, and spending time with my partner, Ben, and our two kitties, Milo and Jasper.\n\nI am a Clinical Research Coordinator with the Heart and Mind Wellbeing Center and am excited to work on the HeartGPS study. This first-of-its-kind, multi-site study is evaluating a psychological intervention for parents who receive their baby’s diagnosed of congenital heart disease during pregnancy. I earned my bachelor’s degree in Psychology at the University of Cincinnati. I enjoy reading and being outdoors with my young son, who turns any trip outside into an adventure.\n\nI am a clinical research coordinator with the Heart and Mind Wellbeing Center. I have worked in clinical research since 2015, with a focus on psychology and neuroscience. I graduated from the University of Cincinnati with a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology in 2015 and earned a master’s degree in clinical research management from Ohio State University in 2020. I am passionate about contributing to research that improves mental health outcomes for our patients and their caregivers. When not at work, I enjoy spending time with my husband and our two kids. I am a volunteer leader for Girl Scouts of Western Ohio, and I love to travel when I get the chance!\n\nI am a Project Manager in the Heart Institute Research Core at Cincinnati Children’s. My professional training centers around exercise physiology. I received my master’s degree in Education from the University of Dayton in Ohio and am a certified clinical research coordinator. Ever since my own pregnancy and postpartum journey, I have developed a passion for understanding more about the connection between physical and mental health. Combining cardiology with mental health is so interesting. Outside work, I love hanging out with my family and exploring new parks and hiking trails. I also have a habit of walking the aisles of Costco and Trader Joe’s a little too much. I love finding new products and recipes!\n\nI’m a Senior Regulatory Specialist for the Heart Institute Research Core at Cincinnati Children’s. My passion for research ethics began while working on my master’s degree in Social Psychology at Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana. I’m now a certified clinical research professional and a certified institutional review board (IRB) professional with eight years of regulatory experience in clinical research and social behavioral settings. Working with the Kasparian Lab combines my educational background in psychology, my current work at the Heart Institute, and my desire to broaden my regulatory knowledge and experience with international collaborators. I am an avid pool (billiards) player. I play in several leagues and travel to tournaments several times a year. I also coach fifth- and sixth-grade softball!"
