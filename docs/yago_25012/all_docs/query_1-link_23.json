        "text": "Olivia Spencer, Piano Instructor\n\nHaving been born into a military family in Virginia, Olivia Spencer’s upbringing was marked by a cross-cultural experience. Growing up, they spent significant years in Germany and the United States. However, they consider Havana, FL, as their true home.\n\nFrom an early age, Olivia was immersed in a world of music. They grew up sitting in on choir rehearsals led by their mother and listening to their sister practice piano, but the pivotal moment that pushed them to pursue music occurred during their sophomore year of high school when Olivia traveled to San Francisco to participate in the Gilbert and Sullivan scenes program.\n\nUnder the guidance of their mother and later the tutelage of esteemed voice teachers Dr. Barbara Clark and Dr. Robin Rice at Rice University, Olivia specialized in classical voice. Their musical knowledge, however, extends beyond classical realms, encompassing gospel, jazz, and neo-soul vocals and piano.\n\nIn addition to their musical pursuits, Olivia is a seasoned educator with around five years of experience teaching piano, voice, and flute. They’ve shared their passion for music both privately and in collaboration with Woods Valley Music in California, leaving a lasting impact on their students.\n\nOutside of music, Olivia embraces their identity as an “undercover bumpkin.” Nature and mechanics hold a special place in their heart, and much of their free time is spent exploring the outdoors, tinkering with their car, or nurturing their beloved plant babies."
