        "text": "(A Few Minuets after Olivia leaves)\n\nCoop's POV: I frown softly as I watch Olivia and that old Dealer and user Tj drive off. What is she doing with him? I look at the pictures of them kissing that I took and think of what I heard. How do they even know each other? Tj was in some bougie Rehab and then came back with his baby girl. I sigh as I call Spencer. He picks up .\n\n*Phone Call*\n\nSpencer:\"what up coop?\" I sigh softly\n\nMe:\"Hey S,I jut saw Olivia hear. \"\n\nSpencer:\"Olivia? She just texted Layla that she had to meet with her sponsor.\" I think a little and then remember the small tattoo shop they left. Ohhh right! some ex-addicts are sponsors.\n\nMe:\"she met with her but she didn't leave with her . Remember Tj from grade school?\" I can basically hear him rolling his eyes. Tj was one of Shawns boys. One we grew up with .\n\nSpencer:\"why you talking about that fool? He don't got nothing to do with Olivia.\" I frown softly as I remember how close they seemed.\n\nMe:\"Actually I just saw those two together. You know me I'm not gonna step in no one's business. But it's weird Spence! They kissed and said something about old habits dying hard.\" I explain Something's off about those two they keeping secrets.\" I know it.\n\nSpencer:\"Kissed? Old habits? \" I nod my head before remembering something.\n\nMe:\" wait wasn't Tj's rehab somewhere in Beverly?\" I ask Spencer sighs softly\n\nSpencer:\" i'll look into it . I'm starting to see your point somethings not right here. How Olivia would Olivia know Tj so well?\" I try to hold back my theory knowing TJ because I've met his daughter. He has a baby girl.\n\nMe:\"well.... I have a thought.\" I Say chuckling nervously.\n\nSpencer:\" what is it coop?\"\n\nMe:\" TJ had a baby girl with someone girlfriend of his when they where in rehab. That baby is light skin and she's just a shade over Olivia and Jordan. And that baby is about to be one in three months.\" I explain hoping dates don't add up!\n\nSpencer:\" if they were in rehab together it's Possible Jordan said Olivia was in there for an entire year when everyone expected her to be out in unless six months.\"\n\nMe:\" you Gotta be kidding me I got to go I'll call you later!\" I Say before ending the call"
