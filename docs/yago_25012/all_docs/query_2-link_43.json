        "text": "Vincent T. Phillips, Sr\n\nJuly 24, 1945-November 2, 2023\n\nOur beloved husband, father, and “Granddad” went to be with The Lord November 2, 2023. He passed peacefully holding the hand of his wife of 57 years and with his two sons at his bedside in Nashville, TN. Vince was born in Cleveland, Ohio July 24, 1945. He attended St. Ignatius High School and was a member of the class of 1963. He met his wife Mary Janet Pason in 1960 and courted her throughout high school and college. He attended Cleveland State University where he studied Physics, while also co-oping at Ford Motor Company. While attending CSU, Vince served as President of The Ohio Epsilon Chapter of Tau Beta Pi, Vice President of Pi Mu Epsilon, and was an active member of Wing and Torch. In the fall of his junior year, he and Janet were married in September 1966. They welcomed their son Vincent Thomas Jr. in October 1967. In 1968, Vince graduated Cum Laude with his Bachelor of Science. Following graduation, Vince and his family moved to Cambridge Massachusetts. Vince attended Harvard Business School and received his MBA with distinction in 1970, and then moved to Lancaster, PA to begin his professional career. In 1974, Vince and Janet welcomed their son Stephen Michael.\n\nVince could be described as hard working both in his personal life and professional career. At just 6 years old he had his first job as a paper boy, with future jobs including: dish washer, golf caddy, lawn care, college lab instructor, sighted worker at the Society for the Blind, and physics tutor. His professional career included positions with Hamilton Watch Company (Lancaster, PA), Xerox Corporation (Rochester, NY), and a strategic planning consulting firm which afforded him the opportunity to work with many fortune 500 companies including Heinz, Spalding, and Evenflo. In 1976, Vince and his family relocated to Nashville, TN, where he formed a general management consulting firm specializing in owner-operated companies. He served as head of the company for over 35 years until his retirement in 2011. He also maintained investments in Maryland Farms and Bellevue Office Parks and was a founding member shareholder in Prime Trust Bank, known today as Pinnacle Bank. Vince balanced his work with a variety of hobbies including photography, movies, sports cars, and investing.\n\nAlthough Vince took pride in his professional career, his Catholic faith was of utmost importance to him. He was a member of St. Henry Catholic Church where he was an active participant in his Cursillo Group, Parish Council, Breviary group, Knights of Columbus, and Rosary Group. He served as moderator of Donuts and Dialogue, an RCIA sponsor, and a Lector on Sunday mornings. In addition to his involvement in his parish, he was a member and served as President of Serra Club. Vince also took an active role in fostering Catholic education in the Nashville community, serving as member and Chairman of the Father Ryan High School Board of Trustees. In addition to volunteering his time, he also made charitable contributions to the initial altar and furnishings of St. Matthew Church; Scholarships and development projects at Father Ryan High School; the expansion of St. Henry Church and School; Frassati USA; and the Sisters of the Holy Eucharist.\n\nVince was preceded in death by his parents, Michael Joseph and Margaret Elizabeth Phillips. He is survived by his wife Mary Janet Phillips, his sons Vincent Thomas Jr. (Deborah) and Stephen Michael; his grandchildren Elizabeth Carol (Sullivan) Tuck, Emily Catherine (Joshua) Carter, Easton Michael, Addison Clarke, and Brittin Claire Phillips; his great-grandchildren Nora Ann Tuck, Henry Joseph Carter, John Alex\n\nTuck, and Miles Thomas Carter; and his siblings Joan (Bill) Thesling, John (Elaine) Phillips, Mike (Pat) Phillips, and many nieces and nephews.\n\nThe family would like to express their gratitude for the care Vince received while at St. Thomas Hospital and especially the care and compassion received at Alive Hospice Nashville. We greatly appreciate the countless family and friends who visited him, brought communion, sent food, offered help in any way possible, and prayed for Vince and the family. Vince will be missed dearly and daily by so many. We are deeply saddened by his sudden and unexpected death, but we have faith we will see him again. “For God so loved the world that He gave his only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.” John 3:16.\n\nVince’s life will be celebrated with a Funeral Mass Tuesday, November 14, 2023 at 11:00 AM at St. Henry Catholic Church, 6401 Harding Road, Nashville, TN. Visitation will precede the Mass beginning at 9:00 AM, and a reception will immediately follow the Mass in the Fellowship Hall.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to St. Henry Catholic Church, St. Matthew Catholic Church, Father Ryan High School, Frassati USA, or The Ladies of Charity in his name."
