        "text": "Larry Phillips, 67, of Camden, DE. passed away peacefully at home surrounded by his loving family on Wednesday, March 20, 2024.\n\nLarry was born on March 26, 1956 in Stanford, Kentucky to Veneda (Caudill) Phillips and the late Ernest Roy Phillips.\n\nLarry joined the United States Air Force in 1975. He was stationed at Dover Air Force Base in Dover, Delaware, transitioning to Civil Service and retiring in 2015, completing 40 years of faithful service to his country. His expertise on the TF39 C5 engine gained him the respect and recognition of his colleagues and peers. He was a mentor and most of all a friend to many.\n\nLarry was an avid Harley Davidson Motorcycle enthusiast. He became president of the American Bikers Aimed Toward Education (ABATE) Delaware Motorcycle Club, teaching motorcycle safety and organizing charity functions. Along with fellow members, he made numerous toy drive runs to local children’s hospitals, built playgrounds, and was active in planning Veteran’s events.\n\nLarry loved traveling, watching NASCAR, drinking a cold Pepsi, and caring for his poodles; especially Luna who never left his side.\n\nWhen Larry wasn’t landscaping and beautifying lawns, he was working in his beloved shop. His biggest ambition was to restore his 1981 Corvette. On any given day, you would find him “making his rounds”, which included his daily lunch at Giacomo’s.\n\nLarry is survived by his loving mother Veneda Phillips of Corbin, KY; his devoted wife Linda Phillips of Camden, DE; his girls, Erica “Doc” Melvin, husband David Melvin of Smyrna, DE; Heather “Kiddo” Gill, husband Joshua Gill of Dover, DE; his boys Michael Lynn of Mesa, AZ; John Lynn of Tucson, AZ; grandchildren Keaton, Lyssa, Preston, and Jameson; his sisters, Delores and her husband James “Big Bro” Spalding of Corbin, KY; Diane Fields of Corbin, KY; brothers, Tom and his wife Emily Phillips of Harrodsburg, KY; Wayne and his wife Wendy Phillips of Ringgold, GA; Greg Phillips and his fiancé Allison Asher of Corbin, KY; and numerous aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces, and nephews.\n\nMany thanks to the doctors and nurses at Fresenius Home Dialysis Center, Temple University Hospital, Aveanna Healthcare, and Delaware Hospice for their care and support.\n\nA memorial service will take place Friday, April 5, 2024 at Pippin Funeral Home, Inc located at 119 W. Camden Wyoming Avenue, Wyoming, DE 19934. Friends and family are welcome to gather from 11am-12pm for a time of remembrance before the memorial service at 12pm. Larry was a “jeans and t-shirt kinda guy” so casual attire may be worn, if desired. Interment will follow at the Delaware Veteran’s Memorial Cemetery, Millsboro, DE. A celebration of life will be held in his hometown of Stanford, KY at a later date.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family asks for contributions to the National Kidney Foundation – Maryland & Delaware and St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital."
