        "text": "By Shannon Raphael\n\nUpdated April 9 2021, 1:28 p.m. ET\n\nScreen star Octavia Spencer is known for her dramatic roles, but she's showing off her comedy skills in the Netflix film Thunder Force. The Academy Award winner is starring alongside Bridesmaids actress Melissa McCarthy in the superhero satire movie.\n\nOctavia and Melissa are playing best friends in Thunder Force, and they've actually been close in real life for quite some time.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWhile the details of Melissa's personal life are very publicly known — since she often collaborates with her husband, Ben Falcone, on movies — Octavia is more private.\n\nRead on to find out if Octavia Spencer has a partner and to find out what she's said about having kids.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nDoes Octavia Spencer have a partner?\n\nThe Hidden Figures actress appears to be single at the moment, and she has never been married.\n\nShe was rumored to be in a relationship with Ma and The Help director Tate Taylor at one point because the two lived together for seven years in Los Angeles. But, the two have only publicly indicated that they are close friends. Tate is openly gay, and he has been dating producer Todd Norris for quite some time.\n\nOctavia and Tate have worked together several times, and they've been friends since 1995.\n\nThe Thunder Force star was also linked to Cougar Town actor Josh Hopkins when he was her date to the 2012 SAG Awards. But, it also seems like the two were just friends as well. They were, coincidentally, introduced to one another by Tate Taylor.\n\nThe actors bonded over their shared alma mater, Auburn University.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nDoes Octavia Spencer have kids?\n\nOctavia does not have any children of her own, but she is close with her siblings' kids. The Alabama native is the second youngest of seven children.\n\nShe has discussed whether she would want to have kids in several interviews.\n\nThe Witches star told Parade in July of 2013 that she did want to become a mom at some point.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n\"I definitely want kids,\" the ORIT Entertainment founder said. \"I wanted three, but I'm in my early 40s now, so I'd be happy to have one healthy baby.\"\n\nA few months later, she said something quite different. In November of 2013, during a roundtable discussion with The Hollywood Reporter, the then-43-year-old said that she was \"fine\" with the fact that her \"eggs are dying.\"\n\n\"I should be married and have 19 kids,\" she said during the chat, per Us Weekly. \"And now I'm thinking my eggs are dying on the shelf. They're going to go past their expiration date. But it's what I chose, so I'm fine with that decision.\"\n\nTwo years later, in 2015, Octavia spoke with Us Weekly about how she had no desire to have children.\n\n\"I am not maternal at all,\" she shared with the outlet. \"I don't have any kids.\"\n\nIn the years since, Octavia hasn't shared much else about her plans for her personal life.\n\nThunder Force is available to stream on Netflix now."
