        "text": "In the All American season 6 finale, \"I Do (Part II),\" Spencer (Daniel Ezra) and Olivia (Samantha Logan) find out their wedding venue was flooded due to a sewage problem. While Olivia questions if she and Spencer will ever get married, Spencer plans a surprise alternative, even calling in some favors with some familiar faces.\n\nElsewhere, Jordan (Michael Evans Behling) and Layla (Greta Onieogou) are handed quite the gracious gift, Jordan stumbles upon a new Baker relative and Coop (Bre-Z) gets some life-changing news.\n\nHere's what happened in the All American season 6 finale.\n\nSpencer's wedding surprise\n\nAt the Baker house, Spencer relays to Olivia it'll take three days for the wedding venue to be cleaned. Unfortunately, he has to be back at training camp in 36 hours, meaning if they don't get married the following day they'd have to wait until next year. Both are crushed by the realization.\n\nThe next morning, the Vortex shows up offering to help. While the friends watch Olivia pretending to be fine as she eerily cuts up fruit, Spencer calls Coach Montes to ask if he can miss the first few days of training camp to get married under the circumstances, but the coach says no. Spencer shares the bad news with Coop, who coincidentally gets an email saying she was accepted into GAU's law school. As the Vortex rallies around Coop in celebration, Olivia can't hide her disappointment that Montes denied Spencer’s request.\n\nCertain she's not getting married, Olivia spends much of the day packing. Jordan tries to cheer her up and assist her, but he becomes distracted when he finds his dad's old playbook, thinking it could help him in his new coaching job at South Crenshaw. Olivia doesn’t mind Jordan stops helping, but Layla walks in and relieves him of his duties. As the two friends talk, they get emotional about the house being full of memories, and the fact Layla will miss Olivia when she moves to New York. Layla also mentions that she and Jordan are still having a hard time finding a house to buy as none of them feels like home.\n\nMeanwhile, across town, Spencer and Coop show up at South Crenshaw. Spencer thinks the Billy Baker football field could be their new wedding venue. Unfortunately, the field is under construction. Coop thinks it was a horrible plan anyway.\n\nBefore Spencer and Coop move on, they run into Deion (Taiv Lee) and Amina (Alexis Chikaeze), who working on a project based on A Midsummer Night's Dream. Talking to them and remembering the wedding gift he received from Jordan in the previous episode, Spencer gets an idea and asks the teenagers for a favor.\n\nHe enlists them, their friend Khalil (Antonio J Bell), Patience (Chelsea Tavares) and Coop to put together wedding decorations, as Olivia cancelled all their vendors. Thanks to Coop, Spencer's former teammate Kai (Tre Hale), Spencer's first girlfriend Kia (Asjha Cooper) and Spencer's college friend Davita (Brittany Marie Batchelder) show up to assist as well.\n\nBack at the Baker house, Oliva breaks down in tears remembering when she told Spencer she was leaving for the UK. Laura (Monet Mazur) and Olivia's grandmother Wendy (Jaclyn Smith) walk in and console her. Olivia thinks her relationship with Spencer constantly faces setbacks, but they encourage her to think how despite all of the trials and tribulations, she and Spencer have managed to love each other and remain committed to one another. Laura encourages her daughter not to give up on getting married.\n\nWhen Spencer finally reunites with Olivia, she’s turned over a new leaf. She tells him they’re getting married today and she found a justice of the peace willing to officiate. He coyly agrees, but says they need to make a stop first. They drive to the James family home where the couple's loved ones are ready for a wedding in the backyard. Olivia is touched Spencer was able to pull this off and notes the home has special significance for them before she's ushered off to get dressed.\n\nCoop is going to law school\n\nWhile at the beach house helping Spencer with decorations, Coop gets a message on her phone. It's her decision from Yale Law School. Coop doesn't want to open the email, but Patience takes her phone and loudly yells in excitement she got into the school. When Spencer and Jordan run out to the commotion, they're thrilled for Coop, but she doesn't seem that happy.\n\nOnce Olivia and Spencer officially get hitched, Spencer pulls Coop to the side during the reception to catch up. She opens up about not being sure she can go to Yale because she never really had dreams for herself. She claims to be just a former rapper who minored in gangbanging. Spencer counters she's a talented legal mind and encourages her to choose the school that makes her happy. As he gets up to walk away, she tells him she loves him.\n\nLaura is moving and Jordan and Layla find a home\n\nAll of the day's events get Laura teary-eyed thinking about how the Baker home is full of memories. She's not sure she can stay there alone and is considering selling it to start a new chapter. Olivia smirks, thinking she has the perfect solution.\n\nAgain at the reception, Jordan and Layla jokingly go back and forth about a piece of cake and the idea of sharing it. Laura walks up and surprises them both by saying she is giving them the house. She shares it was Olivia’s idea, and Laura has already put the deed in their names. Their incredibly appreciative, and funny enough, Laura then takes the cake they were discussing.\n\nBilly has a brother\n\nAlthough Jordan was tasked with assisting Spencer at the beach house with wedding decorations, he was distracted looking through his dad's playbook. After Kia scolds him for not helping, he gets up and a baby picture drops out of it. Kia assumes it's Billy (Taye Diggs) as a child, but Jordan knows it's not.\n\nWhen Jordan gets a moment alone with Grandpa Willy (Brent Jennings), he asks who the child is in the photo. Immediately, Grandpa Willy gets tense and lies that he doesn't know who it is. Jordan presses the issue and after initially pushing back, Grandpa Willy eventually reveals the baby is Billy's older brother. Billy's mom had a child before Grandpa Willy entered the picture. The news stuns Jordan, and Grandpa Willy storms off.\n\nSpencer and Olivia's Crenshaw sendoff\n\nAfter a beautiful wedding where Spencer and Olivia shared touching words about each other, Grace (Karimah Westbrook) says a few people planned a surprise for the couple. Preach (Kareem J. Grimes) and the Crenshaw community showed up for the newlyweds to give them the reception they deserve.\n\nSpencer and Olivia take to the dancefloor for their first dance. What starts out as a well-choreographed classical dance between the two, cuts to a hip-hop routine that showcased the actors' dance skills.\n\nIn a tearful moment, Spencer interrupts Preach, D'Angelo (Lamon Archey), Coach Boone (Mustafa Speaks) and Spencer's former therapist Dr. Spears (Eugene Byrd), thanking the four men for showing up for him. After losing Corey (Chad L. Coleman) and Billy, he notes they helped fill the gaps, and he's appreciative.\n\nAs the season closes out, members of the Crenshaw community step up to thank Spencer for his contributions over the years. Then in a final moment, a photographer asks if Spencer and Olivia would like to take a few more pictures, which they do."
