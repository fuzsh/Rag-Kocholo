        "text": "At long last, #Spelivia has gotten hitched.\n\nAll American ended its sixth season on Monday with a sweet, long-in-the-making wedding for Spencer James and Olivia Baker, who managed to salvage their perfect day despite a last-minute problem with their wedding venue. (Rain on your wedding day? Lucky. Sewage leak on your wedding day? Disgusting.)\n\nBut Monday’s finale was more than just a milestone for All American‘s central ‘ship: It was also a sendoff for series star Daniel Ezra, who will not return as a series regular for the previously announced Season 7. When The CW expanded All American‘s Season 6 episode count from 13 to 15 earlier this year, it afforded showrunner Nkechi Okoro Carroll the opportunity to not only give Ezra a fitting farewell, but to pay tribute to Spencer and Olivia’s long road to romantic bliss.\n\n“The whole reason we asked Warner Bros. and The CW for an additional two episodes was because I wanted to do the wedding,” Carroll tells TVLine. “And I wanted to have two episodes dedicated to paying homage to the journey that ‘Spelivia’ had been on, and what it takes to finally get them to the altar… Everyone was so supportive of me telling this story the way I wanted to tell it that they gave us the additional two episodes to do it.”\n\nEven before All American was picked up for Season 7 in June, speculation had begun that the show could cast a wave of “next-gen young characters” to keep production costs down for next year’s episodes — and Monday’s finale certainly gave closure to most of its current characters, should they not return in 2025. A newly married Spencer and Olivia will now live in New York together; Coop got into law school at both GAU and Yale, with her decision between the two TBD; Laura put the Baker house’s deed in Jordan and Layla’s name, so they can have the place and start their new lives there; and Jordan accepted a coaching gig at South Crenshaw High, following in his dad’s footsteps.\n\nThat last development, though, did result in a loose plot thread when Jordan found a baby photo he didn’t recognize in his dad’s old Crenshaw coaching binder. At Spencer and Olivia’s wedding, Jordan presented the photo to his Grandpa Willy, who reluctantly revealed that the child in the photo was Billy’s older brother — the result of a previous relationship Grandma Mary had had, before Willy was in her life. But when Jordan pressed his grandfather for more answers on the child, Willy got agitated and dropped the conversation, leaving us without closure.\n\nAccording to Carroll, “we will definitely have answers to some of those questions that get raised for Jordan,” though she stops short of confirming any returning cast members.\n\n“[It] will absolutely be part of the storylines in Season 7,” she says."
