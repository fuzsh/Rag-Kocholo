        "text": "Octavia Spencer (born May 25, 1970, Montgomery, Alabama, U.S.) is an American actress who was known for her numerous small, generally comic roles before she shot to stardom as one of the lead characters in the film The Help (2011). Spencer won an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a BAFTA Award for her performance as an outspoken domestic servant in Mississippi during the early 1960s.\n\nSpencer was one of seven children, and she grew up in Montgomery, Alabama. She had an interest in acting from childhood, but she considered it to be an impractical career choice. She earned (1994) a bachelor’s degree in English from Auburn University and then worked in local casting for films that were shot in Alabama. Spencer auditioned for one of those movies, the thriller A Time to Kill (1996), and she was given a small speaking role that launched her acting career. She was cast in the minor comedies The Sixth Man and Sparkler in 1997 and played guest roles on such television shows as Moesha and ER the following year. Spencer continued in that manner, often playing the part of a nurse, for the next several years, though she did gain some recognition for her appearances in the film comedies Being John Malkovich (1999), Big Momma’s House (2000), and Bad Santa (2003) and for a recurring part in 2007 on the TV show Ugly Betty.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nBy 2009 Spencer was known primarily as a talented comic actress with a reputation as a scene stealer. However, the director of The Help, Tate Taylor, was a close friend of both Spencer and Kathryn Stockett (who wrote the 2009 novel on which the movie was based), and both felt that Spencer was right for the part of the forthright housemaid Minny Jackson. Spencer shone in the role, and thenceforward her versatility as an actress was no longer in doubt. Her subsequent projects included a well-received performance in the controversial film Fruitvale Station (2013), leading parts in the James Brown biopic Get on Up (2014) and the family dramas Black or White (2014) and The Great Gilly Hopkins (2015), a recurring guest role (2013–15) on the TV sitcom Mom, and the voice of Mrs. Otterton in the popular animated feature Zootopia (2016).\n\nSpencer was nominated for another Oscar for her portrayal of the no-nonsense computer programmer Dorothy Vaughan in the acclaimed 2016 film Hidden Figures, about three real-life African American women who worked at the U.S. space agency in the early years of the American space program. Her credits from 2017 included the family drama Gifted and the fairy tale The Shape of Water, in which she played a member of a night cleaning crew who discover an unusual creature in the government laboratory where they work. For the latter film, Spencer received her third Academy Award nomination. She then appeared in the domestic drama A Kid Like Jake and the comedy Instant Family (both 2018)."
