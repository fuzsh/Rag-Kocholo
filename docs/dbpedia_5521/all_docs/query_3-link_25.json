        "text": "MIKE CERRE:\n\nSome of the most indelible images of the Vietnam War came during its final hours of April 30, 1975. After more than thirteen years of military involvement, 58,220 Americans killed, along with millions of Vietnamese. It came down to this desperate evacuation of nearly two thousand Americans and South Vietnamese dependents from the American embassy compound in Saigon.\n\nThe former American embassy here, in what is now called Ho Chi Minh City was torn down years ago. It wasn't until 1995 after diplomatic relations were finally restored that a new consulate was opened here on the same grounds as the U.S.'s dramatic exit from what the Vietnamese call \"The American War\"\n\nMIKE CERRE:\n\nHe and other western journalists have come back to a much different Ho Chi Minh City for the 40th anniversary of the fall of what they knew as Saigon in 1975.\n\nMany of these veteran journalists thought the eventual takeover of Vietnam was inevitable after the north Vietnamese's Tet Offensive of 1968 in several key cities closely followed by peace negotiations and the gradual drawdown of American forces starting in 1969. The North Vietnamese took over of as much as a third of South Vietnam during the Easter Offensive of 1972.\n\nNick Ut's iconic photograph of a young Vietnamese girl accidentally hit with napalm during the north Vietnamese invasion of the south marked the beginning of the end of the of the diminishing public support for the war by many Americans.\n\nOnly a teenager at the timeâ€¦ Nick Ut was a self-taught photographer who had replaced his photographer-brother killed earlier in the war. He covered the collapse of the south Vietnamese army and the mass exodus of retreating military and civilian, all seeking a last sanctuary in the Saigon area in April, 1975.\n\nMIKE CERRE:\n\nMakeshift helipads were created in the compound's courtyard and atop the embassy itself for shuttling the last of the Americans and Vietnamese who were able to get into the embassy compound, so they could be flown to American naval ships standing by off the coast.\n\nSGT. JOHN GHILAIN (Ret.), U.S. Marine Corps: When we were given the order to fall back into the embassy while falling back and looking at the people's eyes you could see the fear.\n\nMIKE CERRE:\n\nForty years later Ho Chi Minh City symbolizes the enormous growth Vietnam has experienced since the war and its switch to a socialist-based, market economy in 1986. Its growth rate has been averaging better than 6 percent a year the past decade elevating it from one of the world's poorest countries during the war to one of the fastest growing economies in Asia.\n\nApril 30th in Vietnam is now called Liberation Day or Reunification Day and is a national holiday. Only recently has it also become a show of Vietnam's military power in the region.\n\nMIKE CERRE:\n\nFor many of the estimated three million Vietnamese who fled the country often at great physical risks and personal hardships, April 30th is called \"The Day of Shame\" or \"Black April\".\n\nGiven the amount of American blood and treasure lost here over more than a decade of fighting to save South Vietnam from a communist takeover. It's also a day of very mixed emotions for those Americans who served here during the war. Some of them have also come back."
