        "text": "1965\n\nJanuary 1 - February 7, 1965\n\nVietcong forces mount a series of attacks across South Vietnam. They briefly seize control of Binh Gia, a village only 40 miles from Saigon. Two hundred South Vietnamese troops are killed near Binh Gia, along with five American advisors.\n\nThe South Vietnamese lost 200 men at Binh Gia\n\nFebruary 7, 1965\n\nA U.S. helicopter base and advisory compound in the central highlands of South Vietnam is attacked by NLF commandos. Nine Americans are killed and more than 70 are wounded. President Johnson immediately orders U.S. Navy fighter-bombers to attack military targets just inside North Vietnam.\n\nFebruary 10, 1965\n\nA Vietcong-placed bomb explodes in a hotel in Qui Nonh, killing 23 American servicemen.\n\nOne of the American dead is carried to a waiting transport\n\nFebruary 13, 1965\n\nPresident Johnson authorizes Operation Rolling Thunder, a limited but long lasting bombing offensive. Its aim is to force North Vietnam to stop supporting Vietcong guerrillas in the South.\n\nMarch 2, 1965\n\nAfter a series of delays, the first bombing raids of Rolling Thunder are flown.\n\nApril 3, 1965\n\nAn American campaign against North Vietnam's transport system begins. In a month-long offensive, Navy and Air Force planes hit bridges, road and rail junctions, truck parks and supply depots.\n\nApril 7, 1965\n\nThe U.S. offers North Vietnam economic aid in exchange for peace, but the offer is summarily rejected. Two weeks later, President Johnson raises America's combat strength in Vietnam to more than 60,000 troops.
