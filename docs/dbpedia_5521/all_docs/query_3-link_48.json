        "text": "Home — Special Collections — Exploring Vietnam War Stories — The Fall of Saigon\n\nThe Fall of Saigon\n\nThe fall of the American embassy in Saigon remains one of the most symbolically significant moments of the war in Vietnam. Although the peace accords had been signed in 1973 and U.S. troops were long gone, the speed in which South Vietnam collapsed was disheartening following the outlay of so much American blood and effort. For the South Vietnamese, it meant the loss of a country, and it triggered one of the most significant refugee crises since World War II. It also meant the beginning of a long and difficult reunification and reconciliation process after 20 years of war. In this lesson, students will examine many retrospectives of the war in Vietnam following the fall of Saigon.\n\nStandards\n\nTips for using this module in your classroom\n\nResources\n\nDocumentary Clip"
