        "text": "SEAL Team ONE deployed Chief Petty Officers Robert Sullivan and Charles Raymond to take initial surveys and prepare for training indigenous South Vietnamese in maritime commando tactics, techniques, and procedures.\n\nDuring this same period, the U.S. Government agreed to increase aid to South Vietnam in the fight against Viet Cong rebels. The agreement included paying for a larger Vietnamese army and more U.S. advisors in the field.\n\nThe Brown-Water Mobile Riverine Force was a joint venture between the Navy and the Army. There was limited transportation infrastructure in Vietnam, devoid of superhighways and sophisticated rail systems. The waterways served as the primary source of transport, therefore, control was crucial. The Navy patrolled the inland waterways of the Mekong River. Itâ€™s primary mission was to intercept and prohibit enemy supplies being smuggled from the North. Additionally, The Navy delivered and supported land forces (including Navy SEALs) and engaged North Vietnamese forces ashore with on-board weaponry.\n\nBy mid-1968, the SEAL Teams were fielding 12-man platoons, each comprising two squads of six men; most SEAL missions conducted in Vietnam were squad-sized operations. Generally, four or five platoons, at any given time, were deployed to South Vietnam. SEAL platoons were never assigned permanently to Vietnam; instead, they were deployed on temporary duty assignments, usually for a period of about 6 months, with many of the men making several tours.\n\n10 -1 3 APRIL 1972\n\nThomas Norris received the Medal of Honor for his ground rescue with the assistance of Petty Officer Third Class Nguyen Van Kiet of two downed aircrew members in Quang Tri Province. Nguyen was awarded the Navy Cross.\n\n1 OCT 1972\n\nThornton was awarded the Medal of Honor for the rescue and ex-filtration of Lt. Norris, under withering fire on the night of Oct. 31, 1972. There is no other recorded instance where two Medal of Honor recipients are known to have been involved in the same combat operation."
