        "text": "The Vietnam War has a long history, lasting from 1955 to 1975, engulfing the Southeast Asian country of Vietnam as well as its neighboring countries, Cambodia and Laos.\n\nOn March 28, 2017 – nearly 44 years after the United States withdrew its last forces from Vietnam – President Donald J. Trump signed into law the Vietnam War Veterans Recognition Act of 2017, which named March 29 as National Vietnam War Veterans Day. The bill amended the U.S. flag code to include National Vietnam War Veterans Day as a day on which the flag should be flown.\n\nThis is a separate holiday from Veterans Day, which is celebrated on Nov. 11 and marks the end of World War I.\n\nPosters commemorating National Vietnam War Veterans Day will be on display Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland and JBSA-Randolph libraries, as well as the Joint Personnel Processing Center at 2400 Jessup Road, Suite 4026, at JBSA-Fort Sam Houston.\n\nVisitors to these locations are encouraged to follow COVID-19 health and safety measures, including practicing physical distancing.\n\nFor more information, contact the Civilian Personnel Section at 210-221-1408 or email usaf.jbsa.502-abw.mbx.jbsa-fsh-cps@mail.mil.\n\nThe starting point\n\nThe conflict began during the 1950s when the struggle between the country's communist northern part and the anti-communist south escalated. In the 1960s, the American military joined the conflict, backing up South Vietnam forces, against the troops of communist North Vietnam.\n\nDuring the war, about 500,000 U.S. troops were dispatched to Southeast Asia, about 58,000 of whom were killed and many thousands more were wounded and injured or determined to be missing.\n\nAlthough U.S. military advisors had been in South Vietnam since 1955, America's first combat mission, Operation Chopper, was launched Jan. 12, 1962, and is acknowledged as the starting point of the war.\n\nOn that day, U.S. Army pilots airlifted more than 1,000 South Vietnamese soldiers to an area about 12 miles west of Saigon to capture a National Liberation Front stronghold. The NLF, also known as the Viet Cong, were communist fighters who were in South Vietnam.\n\nGround, air campaigns\n\nThe Battle of Ia Drang, which lasted from Nov. 14-18, 1965, was the first major battle between the U.S. Army and the North Vietnamese Army. It took place in the Central Highlands of South Vietnam.\n\nThe battle saw the first use of a large-scale helicopter air assault and Boeing B-52 Stratofortress strategic bombers being used in a tactical support role.\n\nBesides ground campaigns, one of the most significant air campaigns was Operation Rolling Thunder. The operation lasted from March 2, 1965, to Nov. 2, 1968, and involved a sustained aerial bombardment by U.S. and South Vietnamese air assets against targets in North Vietnam. The operation was designed to halt enemy supplies from reaching South Vietnam.\n\nIn 1972, another massive bombing campaign was conducted against North Vietnam, known as Operation Linebacker.\n\nThe conflict ended in 1975 with the fall of Saigon and the victory of North Vietnam.\n\nThe toll of war"
