        "text": "Basically, the soldiers kept fighting until it was done, because they could not come back until it was “over over there.” So if my father was home, to my way of thinking, everything in Vietnam was over. Until I saw TV news footage showing tanks rolling along the streets of Southern Vietnam and into the Presidential Palace. How could Saigon fall if the war had been over?\n\nAs a child trying to make a sense of the war and its impact in my home, surrounded by adults trying and failing to do the very same thing, TV news was the internet of my youth for trying to decipher the mysteries of the world beyond my limited view. TV documentaries about the Vietnam War broadcast concurrently with live news reports from the hot war zones, which I found confusing. How could I be given historical context for a conflict that ended but was still going?\n\nGrowing up with films like Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, Uncommon Valor and Rambo movies in the 1980s, while the nation was trying to collectively heal from the traumatic wounds of Vietnam, also added to my confusion about what to believe. One expert said the war started for this reason, another detailed why the war was lost for that reason. Everyone struggled to explain the complexities of Vietnam in the most simplistic bits.\n\nIt did become clear that while every historian I listened to had good insight into an aspect of what happened in Vietnam, no one in the 1980s could actually and coherently explain how we got into the war and why it ended as it did. Being an encyclopedia nerd, I finally started researching Vietnam history on my own. Very little was ever mentioned about the French war or anything proceeding the mid-1960s – before Vietnam became a household word in American living rooms.\n\nVietnam suffered from Chinese occupation for centuries, followed by French colonialism. During World War 2, the country was occupied by Imperial Japan. After the Japanese signed their surrender on September 2, 1945 aboard the battleship U.S.S. Missouri, there was finally hope within Vietnam that it would finally be an independent and self-ruled nation. But France, with designs to reclaim its pre-war Colonial glory, had other ideas.\n\nIt is far too complex a subject to summarize here, and the focus of this column is not to explain the war. I recommend watching the 10-part, 18-hour PBS documentary series from directors Ken Burns and Lynn Novick, The Vietnam War at least once if not twice.\n\nALSO READ: Lynn Novick: A discussion about her Vietnam War film on Veterans Day\n\nInstead, this is a story about my journey of understanding. And a search for why Vietnam affected my community so deeply, and particularly my father specifically. He would never talk about the war directly, but situations would trigger comments.\n\nI would sneak treasured looks at his medals and military gear, stored in an old steamer trunk kept in the garage. There was a natural fascination to understand and curiosity to explore. Every step towards enlightenment in those early years was followed by dozens of further questions that brought clouds of confusion. The puzzle pieces did not fit together, nor did any of the dots seem to connect.\n\nLike many storybook places, Vietnam existed at a mythical level for me. Some distant land existing only in the past, romanticized in photos and shared stories told like ancient folklore. So as a young adult on my first sabbatical to circumnavigate the Earth, I added Vietnam to my list of global destinations.\n\nI landed in Ho Chi Minh City about the same age as my father, when he was stationed in what was then Saigon in South Vietnam. Officially, Saigon is called Ho Chi Minh City because the North won the civil war. But to those in the south and American veterans, it will always be remembered as Saigon.\n\nI look back at that trip, planned in the early days of the information superhighway on a telephone-based 56k modem and well before social media. The entire journey around the world was an awakening for me. By the time I reach Vietnam, 6 countries later, I was already well along in my process of enlightenment. So I was not chasing the ghost of my father there. And I had nothing for myself I needed to find peace for. I knew that enough time had passed that there would be no answers waiting for me, and I did not go in search of any. Everyone who had looked for answers always seemed to fail.\n\nALSO READ: Inconvenient Images: How pictures teach us to see the world for what it is\n\nI was simply trying to reconcile what I had been exposed to from afar with what I saw up close, after a gap of nearly a generation. I wanted the first-hand experience, whatever that was, not to walk in my father’s footsteps. I tried to absorb the experiences and touch the physical locations, because they had only existed as the faded images I had grown up seeing for all of my short life. It was also one of the few times in my life that I ever kept a journal."
