        "text": "Today in History:\n\nOn April 30, 1975, the Vietnam War ended as the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon fell to Communist forces.\n\nOn this date:\n\nIn 1789, George Washington took the oath of office in New York as the first president of the United States.\n\nIn 1803, the United States purchased the Louisiana Territory from France for 60 million francs, the equivalent of about $15 million.\n\nIn 1812, Louisiana became the 18th state of the Union.\n\nIn 1900, engineer John Luther “Casey” Jones of the Illinois Central Railroad died in a train wreck near Vaughan, Mississippi, after staying at the controls in a successful effort to save the passengers.\n\nIn 1945, as Soviet troops approached his Berlin bunker, Adolf Hitler took his own life, as did his wife of one day, Eva Braun.\n\nIn 1947, President Harry S. Truman signed a resolution officially confirming the name of Hoover Dam, which had also come to be known as “Boulder Dam.”\n\nIn 1958, Britain’s Life Peerages Act 1958 allowed women to become members of the House of Lords.\n\nIn 1970, President Richard Nixon announced the U.S. was sending troops into Cambodia, an action that sparked widespread protest.\n\nIn 1973, President Richard Nixon announced the resignations of top aides H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, Attorney General Richard G. Kleindienst and White House counsel John Dean, who was actually fired.\n\nIn 1983, blues singer and guitarist Muddy Waters died in Westmont, Illinois, at age 68.\n\nIn 1993, top-ranked women’s tennis player Monica Seles was stabbed in the back during a match in Hamburg, Germany, by a man who described himself as a fan of second-ranked German player Steffi Graf. (The man, convicted of causing grievous bodily harm, was given a suspended sentence.)\n\nIn 2004, Arabs expressed outrage at graphic photographs of naked Iraqi prisoners being humiliated by U.S. military police; President George W. Bush condemned the mistreatment of prisoners, saying “that’s not the way we do things in America.”\n\nIn 2021, Disneyland reopened its gates after a 13-month closure caused by the coronavirus; capacity was limited for the reopening, and only California residents were allowed in."
