        "text": "Badal vs Badal\n\nVipin Pubby - The Indian Express - Thu Oct 14, 2010\n\nThey share the same surname, and were born in the same year — even the same month. But beyond that, Manpreet Badal and Sukhbir Singh Badal have little in common, reports Vipin Pubby\n\nSukhbir Singh Badal\n\nIt was clear from the day Sukhbir Singh Badal entered politics that he is the heir apparent, despite his father, Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, having a soft corner for his cousin, Manpreet Badal. While he did his schooling at Lawrence School, Sanawar, Sukhbir did his graduation and post-graduation in Economics from Panjab University. He later went to the United States for further studies.\n\nAlthough he remained a three-time Lok Sabha member from Punjab and was even union minister of state for industries during the Atal Behari Vajpayee government, Sukhbir showed real interest in state politics only during the run-up to the 2007 Assembly elections, when he took control of the party’s poll campaign, getting the rest to follow his strategy.\n\nIn January last year, Sukhbir was made Deputy Chief Minister, although he was not an MLA then. Since he was unable to get elected within the stipulated six months, he was forced to quit. He was later anointed Deputy CM again after his victory in a bypoll.\n\nSukhbir has followed the Akali politics of appeasement of farmers and jathedars. He was instrumental in introducing Punjabi as a compulsory subject for students up to Class X. This, and his order on compulsory public signboards in Punjabi, did not go down too well with a large section of society, though it was welcomed by the Sikh clergy.\n\nBut Sukhbir also deserves credit for some visionary projects which reflect his modern thinking. He set into motion at least three major power projects, and paid special attention to development of infrastructure including roads. He also introduced reforms to cut down on the red tape, removing unnecessary hurdles like submission of affidavits for every government work.\n\nManpreet Badal\n\nAn alumnus of Doon School, Manpreet Badal did his graduation from St Stephens College in Delhi, following it up with a law degree from London. He is known to pepper his conversations with Urdu couplets, and often quotes military historians to make his point.\n\nHe admits he was highly influenced by Marxist ideology during his youth. Maybe that explains the note that his office usually sent to organisers during any function to which he was invited: \"No extra expenditure should be made for me and other leaders. No money should be spent on garlands, bouquets, momentoes and even lunch.\" It is not unusual to see him drive his own vehicle, with only an escort vehicle following him.\n\nStanding tall at about 6’4\", Manpreet prefers to avoid public glare. In 1994, his uncle, Parkash Singh Badal, persuaded him to return from London and contest the bypoll for the Gidderbaha Assembly constituency. Since then, he has won all the subsequent elections from the constituency, increasing his victory margin each time. But while he has nursed his constituency well, he has not done much to extend his base elsewhere in the state.\n\nKnown to be a favourite of his uncle, Manpreet often courted controversies with his statements and actions. On several occasions, he has even spoken against the party’s policies, particularly on the issue of subsidies. As Finance Minister, he recently rejected a proposal to hike the pay and perks of MLAs as well as the Chief Minister, and also objected to foreign trips by Speaker and some other legislators.\n\nThe fact that he did not quite see eye to eye with his cousin, Sukhbir Singh Badal, was well known. Manpreet himself admitted that they had never sat together to discuss any issue. It was only a matter of time before they publicly confronted each other.\n\nSOURCE: http://www.indianexpress.com/news/badal-vs-badal/697446/0\n\n'Like Eklavya, I was asked to give my thumb'\n\n'Like Eklavya, I was asked to give my thumb'\n\nRaja Bose & Ramaninder K Bhatia , TNN, Oct 15, 2010, 05.38am IST\n\nHis resignation letter to Punjab chief minister and uncle Parkash Singh Badal— recalling how he was baptized by him into politics when he was just five — would move anybody to tears. He speaks with utmost respect when talking about Badal senior. But, a day after he shook the Punjab government and the powerful Shiromani Akaali Dal, former finance minister Manpreet Badal appears hurt deep within. In his battle with his cousin and deputy CM Sukhbir Badal, Manpreet feels that like Eklavya, he had to pay a heavy and damning 'gurudakshina'.\n\nAsk him if he was wronged and you wouldn't get a straight answer. But, he draws an interesting parallel to the Mahabharata, hinting for the first time abolihised uncle's role vis-à-vis his son Sukhbir and him.\n\n\"When Dronacharya found a barking dog's mouth sealed with a volley of arrows, he was amazed at the archer's skill. He asked the archer, Eklavya, who his guru was. Eklavya said it was no one else but him as he put a statue of Dronacharya and practiced. With his favourite disciple Arjuna in mind, Dronacharya asked for his thumb as gurudakshina. I was asked to give my thumb,\" says Manpreet.\n\nSurrounded by books — from Tamerlaine's great invasions to Chengiz Khan's heroics and volumes of Sikh history — in his home, Manpreet's composure doesn't look like that of a man who had just brewed a political storm that has had even a patriarch like Parkash Singh Badal worried.\n\nA lover of poetry, this 47-year-old graduate from Londond School of Economics quotes Urdu poet Munir Niazi to define his decision: \"I had a death wish.\"\n\nBut, he is resolute in his stand. \"It is over. The relationship (with Senior Badal's family) is dead,\" he told TOI. But why did he take so long to act? \"I was not working in a private company, where people keep switching jobs. I am a born Akali and (leaving the party) would have meant switching my religion. I was hanging onto a thin thread. But, I have lost all hope,\" he said.\n\nManpreet says he has an agenda for Punjab, to put the state on the path to bring back its lost glory, to create a resurgent Punjab. His inspiration: The famous 'Ireland unfree shall never be at peace ...' speech by Irish freedom fighter Patrick Pe{censored} and Nikolai Ostrovsky's 'How The Steel Was Tempered'.\n\nHe wants to go it alone and not join any party right now. \"You can't ask a man who has just got divorced whether he wants to marry again. He's too scared,\" he says.\n\n\"I have an agenda for Punjab. Right now, I am getting a lot of response from the people, also on Facebook and blogs. I have already begun meeting. I will go to the people and like Kamal Ataturk did for Turkey, will ***** the conscience of Punjabis. Just like Ostrovsky says, I would like to die happy in the thought that I did something for liberation of mankind from poverty.\"\n\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/...sked-to-give-my-thumb/articleshow/6751580.cms\n\nAttachments\n\nmanpreet badal.jpeg\n\nTV Channel blocked in Punjab for airing SAD controversary\n\nDay & Night TV Channel blocked\n\nPATIALA: The Day and Night TV channel promoted by Kanwar Sandhu former Resident Editor of Hindustan Times and The Indian Express has became first victim of fued between SAD President Sukhbir Badal and his cousin former Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal. The channel has been blocked in Punjab.\n\nDay and Night channel was started two months back by Kndhari Group with Kanwar Sandhu as its poster boy. Kanwar Sandhu who is considered an upright and no-nosence editor/journalist had tried to present a balanced view on Sukhbir-Manpreet dispute, well knowing that cable network in Punjab is controlled by Sukhbir Badal's well wishers. In fact there was a serious debate three years back over acquiring control of cable network by ruling party.\n\nThe latest, the channel has shown the press conference of Manpreet Badal on Wednesday very extensively. Kanwar Sandhu had also interviewed Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and asked certain embarrassing but interesting questions. When Badal claimed that super speciality facilities are available for treatment of cance patients in Punjab, Kanwar Sandhu had asked him then why he took his ailing wife Surinder Kaur to USA for cancer treatment.\n\nKanwar Sandhu, when contacted, confirmed that cable network, which was allegedly controlled by state government, has stopped telecasting their channels trough cable network in state.\n\nSandhu said that they were telecasting all the reports in balancing way.\n\nDay and Night is not the only channel which has became target of ruling party. Earlier, the ZEE Punjabi and ETC Punjabi were blocked on cable network,Romila Sharma Business Head of Zee Punjabi and ETC Punjabi, had described the action an Infringement of Fundamental Right - Right to freedom (Freedom of Press and Freedom of speech and expression)-Section 19 (1) a without knowing that these sections are irrelevant in Punjab. The Zee Punjabi had carried an interview of Congress MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira blaming that SAD-BJP government had over-powered the cable network.\n\nSince the time it was reflected in the news bulletins issued by DD Punjabi and Zee Punjabi News; Zee Punjabi was completely blacked out in the entire region of Punjab as the aftermath of this telecast of the story !\n\nRomila Sharma's statement said, \"In consonance with this, as a network channel it has been have come to know that as part of the conspiracy, DIGI cable network operators are not carrying Zee Punjabi to any part of Punjab. This in-turn means that the common man in Punjab is deprived of free entertainment, free information and free education which is integral to our fundamental rights apart from hampering our fare business interests in the region. As per our track records of so many years, we always earnestly try and adhere to the prescribed media norms and ethics and thereby provide free and unbiased infotainment to one and all. Not only is this illegal for a govt to have a stake in an acting media, they also play filthy games by obstructing the distribution of our channels and deliberately putting many of them on the UHF band, a clear violation & mockery of our democratic rights\".\n\nShe stated, \"We would like to remind here that it is not the first time that media has been gagged in this manner. Earlier also Mr. Roop Sharma, President, Cable operators federation of India, had alleged that the Badal family was behind snipping off the popular channel ‘Punjab Today’ in 2007. He had forwarded the case to the then I&B minister; Mr. Priyaranjan Dasmunsi, where allegations were made that Mr. Sukhbir Singh Badal, son of Mr. Prakash Singh Badal used unethical and unlawful means to threat cable operators and disrupt the operations of the cable networks in the Punjab region\".\n\nAll these channels are however available on DTH network of various operators.\n\n( NOTE: DTH stands for Direct-To-Home television. DTH is defined as the reception of satellite programmes with a personal dish in an individual home. )\n\nsource: http://www.punjabnewsline.com/content/day-night-tv-channel-blocked-cable-network-punjab-airing-sad-controversy/24927\n\nFOCUS:\n\nPopulist politics dominates over good governance\n\nGobind Thukral – South Asia Post – October 15, 2010\n\nFOR politicians electoral considerations often over run other concerns. Good economic management and bold decisions that finally bring in prosperity and social justice are often victims of expediency. Punjab is a sad witness to that tragedy that became more pronounced during the heydays of militancy. Increasing dependence on borrowing for funding state expenditure and increasing borrowing costs is now the most significant source of the fiscal problem. The heavy burden of salaries adds to the woes. Add the misgoverned over the years starting from governor’s rule and we have receipt for disaster.\n\nNow this mess with over Rs 71,000 crore of debt and an annual interest of Rs 8,000 crore besides a heavy budgetary deficit is turning into a political muddle . As usual the young scions of the ruling Badal family are at daggers drawn. The Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal has fired his salvo.\n\nHe went public with his plan to meet the challenge of heavy debt and deficit after it was discussed at an informal meeting of the Punjab cabinet. Manpreet agreed the Centre wanted essentially a political consensus roadmap that puts Punjab back on the road to recovery. He says, “The center wants us to curtail the free power subsidy of Rs 3,100 crore to at least Rs 1,000 crore in five years. Union finance minister Parnab Mukherjee is asking us to impose house tax and water charges, plug the annual Rs 200- crore loss of transport department and disinvest the publis sector units in the red. Plus, they expect audit of all local bodies, Rural Development Fund and the Punjab Infrastructure Development Board be put under CAG.” In return The Union government has in principle agreed to waive off nearly Rs 35,000 crore debt of Punjab.\n\nTaking a diverse view Sukhbir Singh Badal, deputy chief minister and Akali Dal President found this formula as devoid of any political rationale. Terming the Centre’s pre-conditions as “stringent and impractical,” Sukhbir views Manpreet’s rollback-all subsidies stance as a recipe for losing the party’s support base in rural Punjab. He has coming assembly elections in mind. This statement is also being interpreted as a political snub to Manpreet, who steadfastly swears by his reformist agenda. Manpreet to have shot back, casting aspersions on the ability of Sukhbir as a minister.\n\nManpreet thinks that the package is going to be a game-changer for Punjab. It will determine whether the state comes out of the morass or leave the burden to the future generations. He finds no merit the arguments of Sukhbir and opines, “We can turn the political tables by taking the credit for such a huge loan waiver. Scaling back subsidies and levying taxes can earn us Rs 7,000 crore a year, which can significantly enhance the level of education, health and power. This can actually put us in the victory lap. The farmer paying for power will see so much else happening too.” This has been his theme for too long and both his colleagues in the cabinet and the party have rejected this. It was last rejected at Shimla where a committee consisting of Sukhbir and senior BJP minister Manoranjan Kalia was formed. The government implemented certain tax proposals which were implemented by the government. But it did not bail out the government. Huge deficit and debt burden besides the heavy salary bill haunts the government.\n\nAfterward, Sukhbir had taken upon himself the task of steering the policy matters on finances and economy, much to discomfiture of his cousin and finance minister. Now Manpreet comments: “I was disappointed over not being kept in the loop of the Sukhbir-Kalia committee. What took them months to decide, I would have done in minutes because I know the finances like the back of my hand”. But he clearly he too has not come out with any concrete proposals except that subsidies must go. In India, neither the central government nor any state government can completely do away with subsidies. Same is the position at the international level. These can be rationalized and made to reach the targeted beneficiaries.\n\nNotwithstanding Sukhbir’s stand against the Centre’s riders on loan waiver, Manpreet is determined to pursue the proposal. “I will thrash out the whole issue in a fortnight or so, and try and convince my party,” he asserts calls it a litmus test on whether people are just paying lip service or are willing to make sacrifices for the sake of Punjab’s future”. Manpreet is likely to push the issue of subsidies and could well emerge as a flashpoint between him and the party. For now, the gloves are clearly out between the two heirs apparent of the Badal clan. Akali Dal’s Political Affairs Committee has sought action against Manpreet. This would naturally call for the intervention of the Chief Minister, Mr. Parkash Singh Badal who apparently cannot be happy with this kind of public feud. Earlier also, he has intervened to cool down the temperatures.\n\nAgricultural other subsidies are important part of the expenditure, the bulk of which are power subsidies in Punjab. During in 2009-10, out of the estimated Rs 3,072 crore worth of subsidies, Rs 2,600 crore constituted subsidies in the power sector. This needs to be rationalised in the context of challenges that the agricultural sector is facing because of the adverse impact of larger macro-economic management in the country, the environmental challenges from the rice-wheat crop cycles and pressures from global institutions for the agricultural sector. Over ten lakh farmers have left their age old work. This agrarian crisis in the farm sector has lead to suicides in certain areas.\n\nThe State Plan for 2009-10 was fixed at Rs 8,625 crore. Out of this, central assistance is for Rs 968 crore, leaving the state with the task of mobilising Rs 7,657 crore. Unfortunately, the government is in deficit in its own funds (Rs 2376.94 crore and PSUs are in losses to the tune of Rs 2,707 crore). This means the state has to find resources to pay for the deficit, losses and fund the Plan. This funding is being met through borrowings. A sum of Rs 5,441 crore is the budgetary borrowing; this includes all sources like the LIC, NABARD, Provident Fund, small savings, bonds, debentures, etc.\n\nAn additional Rs 6,500 crore is being raised by the erstwhile PSEB despite that it is in losses on its own and, therefore, can generate these resources only by leveraging its assets. An additional Rs 800 crore is being raised by the PIDB. This means that all plan resources, except what is coming through the Centre, are being funded through borrowings, thereby increasing the interest and repayment burden for the future and bloating the revenue expenditure further.\n\nPunjab’s Reform Commission has pointed out Punjab “requires a governance fix not a mere fiscal correction” to reduce the ills facing the state. There are departments and a large number of employees whose output is exactly zero in the best of times and they contribute negatively occasionally. The focus should be on capacity building of the institutions and on the citizen-centric delivery of services. In one good governance.\n\nIn the next 15 days, Manpreet will go to Delhi and ask the exact amount the government of India is willing to write off, and the conditions — both maximum and minimum. Then he would like to thrash it out within the party. In all probability his ideas would find no favour. Meanwhile, like BJP minister kalia who reprimanded Manpreet for going public with his plan and sided with Sukhbir, more and more leaders are gunning at Manpreet. It is as yet not clear how the party would take the call at the political level. The fiscal mismanagement in Punjab clearly shows that populist politics dominates over good governance. It has to be reversed.\n\nsource: http://www.southasiapost.org/2010/20101015/focus.htm\n\nAte we looking a two locomotives traveling a warp speed, and headed for a catastrophic encounter, where a lot of innocent people are the only ones found in the wreckage, after the rescue team makes a delayed yet dramatic entrance onto the stage?\n\nSince economic crises often coincide with transitions to democracy, now punjab face a double challenge. How to resume growth? With distribution of alms the growth can not take place. The time is to make a reform strategy that can lead to resumed growth and strengthen industrial growth.\n\nOur industrial growth has been declining due to Power shortage. The cost of the product in Punjab is more than 30% dearer than Gujrat. The reason about growth in Gujrat is easy availability of raw material, at cheap rate and the very low power shutdown.\n\nPunjab is moving like the policies of the West Bengal. Due to those policies the industries has shifted to the other states. All heavy industries had been been the projected to be installed in Punjab like Hero Honda. Due to wrong policies of the Govt of Punjab, Haryana developed in industrial sector like anything.\n\nIn Punjab the Politicians are not considering the factors of reform package suggested by the IMF and the World Bank.\n\nIn Punjab there are growth in Telecommunication and Sale of vehicles. All other industries position is deteriorating day by day. What is the solution no body knows. The petty shopkeepers are being affected with the presence of Malls. Even the hawker has to compete with MNCs those have immense funds and infrastructure.\n\nDear friends, if we kept our eyes closed the day is not far away that we shall also be in the cluthes of debt trap. The state's mounting debt will keep on increasing. We are not thinking about the declining economic situation. The state's economic position will be deteriorated. But the next year is the election year. If the Govt will take the drastic steps to improve its economic situation at this stage the vote bank will be affected.\n\nDear spnadminji,your example of two locomotives is quite considerable. Now we are sitting and watching the position of catastrophic encounter. It is in fashion in India whenever there is accident the leaders reach at the place of incident and try to give air to their political drama. They people try to get benefit on the adversities and try to befool the public by reaching at the spot by air, and distributing the packets of breads and get those clipping shot and publish the snaps in the newspapers and media highlight the visit of the VIP. No body highlight the cause of the accident.\n\nThe day is not far away when the position of Punjab will be deteriorated and we shall see the catastrophic encounter. Only the fittest will survive and there will be high scale adversities. All the nations will see the conditions of innocent people those will be found in wreckage. What the rescue teams will do at that stage. Like the indian films (Pictures) in which the Police reach at the spot after the crime has been made to give a dramatic shape to the incident.\n\nRajneesh Madhok\n\nManpreet may float new party, ready to contest against Badal\n\nManpreet may float new party, ready to contest against Badal\n\nJalandhar, Oct 17 : Former Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal, who was recently sacked from the state Cabinet and suspended from the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) for anti-party activities, today indicated that he might float a new party.\n\nTalking to reporters here, Mr Badal said he would form a party only at an appropriate time and was waiting for the right time in this regard.\n\nParticipating in a Dussehra programme at Jalandhar, he told reporters that he was assessing the political situation in the state and would put his agenda before the people.\n\nTo a question, the expelled leader said he had no plans to join the Congress as it would be like getting down from one political train hastily and immediately boarding another.\n\nMr Badal accused the Punjab government and SAD of indulging in 'petty activities' to discourage him and his supporters shortly after he walked away from the government.\n\nHe alleged that his office at Civil Secretariat in Chandigarh was ransacked, his supporters were warned against attending his public meeting in Gidderbaha yesterday and a Gurdwara in Kahnuwan town of Gurdaspur district was locked, where he was supposed to address his supporters today.\n\nPutting locks on a Gurdwara was against the Sikh tenets, he said and added he would raise this matter at the Akal Takht.\n\nTo a question, Mr Manpreet said he had no intention to bring down the SAD-BJP government in the state but only wanted to highlight the truth with regard to the Central offer of debt waiver to Punjab.\n\nThe removal of the Finance Minister came in the wake of his statements questioning the fiscal prudence of the SAD-BJP government for not being keen to accept the proposed offer of the Centre on a debt waiver of Rs 35,000 crore on certain conditions.\n\nThe Chief Minister, the Deputy Chief Minister and state chief secretary S C Agarwal later denied that the Centre had made any offer on debt waiver to Punjab.\n\nRegarding the feelers sent by Akali Dal 1920 and Shiromani Akali Dal (Longowal), Mr Manpret Badal said he did not want to comment on this matter as yet.\n\nThe expelled leader had addressed a meeting of his supporters and well wishers in Gurdwara Guptsar in Chhatteana village in Gidderbaha constituency yesterday.\n\nThe meeting was addressed by Jalandhar Cantt MLA Jagbir Singh Brar, former MLA Khushaldeep Singh and former MP Gurdas Singh Badal, father of Manpreet Singh, among others.\n\n--UNI\n\nhttp://www.newkerala.com/news/world/fullnews-64696.html\n\nRe: Manpreet may float new party, ready to contest against Badal\n\nA day after Sekhwan locked Gurdwara, Manpreet Badal gets due honour by Sikh priest\n\nhttp://www.punjabnewsline.com/share/print/25016 http://www.punjabnewsline.com/share/pdf/25016 http://www.punjabnewsline.com/share/email/25016\n\nPunjab Newsline Network\n\nMonday, 18 October 2010\n\nBy Gagandeep Ahuja\n\nPATIALA: A day after Sewa Singh Sekhwan Punjab Public Relations minister locked the Gurdwara at Kahnuwan to prevent entru of former Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal, the granthi (priest) at Gurdwara Dukhnivaran Sahib here who Monday presented Siropao(robe of honour) to Manpreet Singh Badal has reportedly gone underground soon after the ceremony.\n\nThe Gurdwara Dukhnivaran Sahib is controlled by Shiromani Gurdwara Parbhandak Committee (SGPC). Manpreet Badal had came to pay obeisance at Gurdwara where he was presented Siropao by a Granthi.\n\nIn Kahnuwan, Manpreet Badal was shocked to see the Gurdwara locked by supporters of Sewa Singh Sekhwan when he went there to attend path of Sukhmani Sahib organised by one of his supporter. The woman who had organised was allegedly kidnapped by Sekhwan's supporters. Sekhwan later produced the woman in press conference. She said that she had gone to her parents house.\n\nAny official of SGPC, who did not want to disclose the identity of Granthi said that there were no directions from SGPC to give or not to give siropa to Manpreet Badal. He however confirmed that they were told not to allow Manpreet to address any meeting in Gurdwara premises.\n\nThe Gurdwara manager also offered a cup of tea to Manpreet even though he was not allowed to address workers meeting in conference room situated in Gurdwara Premises by the manager.\n\nHe arrived here around 9.40 AM in the morning and after meeting with his supporters who turned in large number immediately went to Gurdwara Sahib.\n\nIn the Jore Ghar (Shoes place) he met many devotees, Namanpreet kaur a student of Thapar University met him and congratulated him and said that she and her family supported him on the issue. Badal thanked her and placed his hand on her head.\n\nManpreet Badal offered Krah Parshad for Rs. 500 for Gurdwara Sahib. He was bestowed Siropa by Granthi in Darbar Hall.\n\nCharanjeet Singh the OSD of Manpreet Singh Badal had informed media yesterday regarding the visit of Manpreet Singh Badal. Large number of media persons were assembled at the Gurdwara.\n\nThe police in plain cloths and CID were deputed in large number outside and inside the gurdwara and were seen in sending minute to minute information to their seniors on mobile phones.\n\nMeanwhile, Taranbir Singh alias ‘Biba sehgal’ son of Sarup Singh Sehgal-an akali leader- met him in Gurdwara premises and offered his support to him. Sarup Singh Sehgal fought- Patiala assembly- unsuccessfully on SAD ticket against Congress nominee Capt. Amarinder Singh in 2002.\n\nNirmal singh bharu, a SGPC member of Sangrur district has honoured him outside the Gurdwara sahib. Later he attended a seminar at Rajiv Gandhi national Law University.\n\nhttp://www.punjabnewsline.com/content/day-after-sekhwan-locked-gurdwara-manpreet-badal-gets-due-honour-sikh-priest/25016\n\nHere is historical parallel \"saga\" re: \"BADAL vs Badal\":\n\nAurangzeb Alamgir was the last major Mughal Ruler in India. After him came the downfall of the Mughal Empire as it was dismembered by the Marathas, Jats, Sikhs, Bundelas and finally put to rest by the British.\n\nThe seeds of this downfall were started in the reign of Aurangzeb. He was the son of Emperor Shah Jahan and he came to the throne after defeating, imprisoning and murdering all his brothers – Dara Shikoh, Shuja and Murad Baksh. He also imprisoned his father to ascend the Mughal throne.\n\nWill the present events bear witness to it ?\n\n*********************************************************************************​\n\nEDITORIAL:\n\nTHE TRIBUNE - Tuesday, October 19, 2010, Chandigarh, India\n\nIt’s SAD\n\nNeedless targeting of Manpreet​\n\nIt was tough for the Shiromani Akali Dal leadership to deal with Mr Manpreet Singh Badal when he was the Finance Minister. He had pushed for the acceptance of the Central conditions for availing the Rs 35,000-crore debt relief. However, the party and the government seem to find it tougher to tackle him after he has left the government. All the recent developments – the alleged bugging of his house and mobile phone, the ransacking of his erstwhile office, none-too-covert attempts to thwart his first public meeting in his constituency, Gidderbaha, and the locking up of the gurdwara at Kahnuwan in Gurdaspur district to stop his interaction with the gathering – show in poor light the functioning of the SAD-BJP government.\n\nIn fact, by continuously targeting Mr Manpreet Badal soon after his departure from the government, the SAD leaders have raised his stature in the eyes of the people. There were some who had earlier believed it might be a battle of succession between the two cousins for the political legacy of Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal. But the recent obstructive tactics are bound to help him win more public sympathy. The impressive response to Mr Manpreet Badal’s first public meeting at Gidderbaha despite official hurdles, it seems, has unnerved the political leadership.\n\nBesides, the young rebel is sober in his speech, talks of the larger economic issues confronting the debt-ridden state and avoids personal attacks on his detractors. On the contrary, the government is gunning for him. It first ducked the loan waiver issue, then denied there was any offer (how can there be when the issue is at the discussion stage?) and now the use of official machinery and party apparatus to stop him from exercising his democratic right to address public meetings. The Akali Dal government badly needs mature advisers to meet the challenge posed by the ousted Finance Minister.\n\nsource: http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20101019/edit.htm#2\n\nWhy not the question regarding offer was raised in meetings.\n\nWhen the issue of disclosure of the Centre's terms were raised regarding Punjab's debt in Cabinet meeting and then in Assembly meeting. At that stage no body asked whether the offer is available in writing or not. Then Mr. Sukhbir Badal said that noting is in writing and again the Chief Secretary rubbished Finance Minister's claim. As the issue was only at the discussion stage, no records could have been possible at that stage.\n\n​\n\nIt’s SAD\n\nNeedless targeting of Manpreet​\n\nIt was tough for the Shiromani Akali Dal leadership to deal with Mr Manpreet Singh Badal when he was the Finance Minister.
