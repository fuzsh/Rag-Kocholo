        "text": "On Friday, the Jammu and Kashmir High Court directed IAS officer Shyambir, Deputy Commissioner of Ganderbal, to appear in person following allegations of criminal contempt. The controversy arose after Shyambir allegedly sought revenge against Sub-Judge Fayaz Ahmad Qureshi by initiating an inquiry into the judge’s land, reportedly as retaliation for a court order in June. The sub-judge had previously ordered Shyambir’s salary to be withheld for failing to comply with a compensation case order. Despite multiple opportunities, Shyambir failed to appear or respond. The High Court has issued a notice for his appearance on August 5, 2024, and warned of coercive action for non-compliance.
