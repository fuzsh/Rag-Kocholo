The Express Tribune reported that in 2013, Pakistani Rs 7.5 million was spent on the renovation of this gurdwara and Rs 1 million was spent on minor repairs after the decision to reopen the gurdwara was taken.\n\nSource: The Express Tribune\n\nNeglected for almost 64 years since partition, ETPB, a body corporate under Pakistan's ministry of religious affairs and inter-faith harmony, began restoring the Gurudwara in 2012.\n\nSo far only Pakistani Sikhs are allowed to visit it as it is closed to members of the community from India."
