At the age of 18, she was accepted into a 7-year medical program at the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine. She was also asked to tour India with a famous Bollywood singer and to sign a 3-year contract.

She decided to go into the 7-year program and graduated in 2005 as a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine.

She got married in 2014 and has two children, a son, and a daughter.\n\nAlthough she is busy, she feels blessed because she has so many people around her who are a support system and could not be where she is without them.
