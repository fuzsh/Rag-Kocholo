        "text": "Big is beautiful and big size sells. But for decades, plus size fashion has been the most neglected segment, with rather abysmal brands making fashionable clothes for this group. Although the plus-size segment in India alone is estimated to have about $5-6 billion market by 2020, a handful of brands have come to life in the last few years. With rise of e-commerce and dedicated fashion portals, this segment is gradually evolving.\n\nOversized, wide and broad are features that are often neglected in fashion, with skimpy clothes mostly advertised and sold through slim models. It’s conveniently forgotten that big is beautiful and big size too can sell. In a welcome change, however, a new breed of online retailers is now venturing into adding more labels in plus-size fashion. From just kurtis and other ethnic Indian wear to now adding Western clothes, the plus-size segment has come a long way.\n\nFor instance, understanding the growing popularity for this segment, fashion brand Lifestyle introduced Nexus, plus-size clothing, two years ago. Srinivasa Rao, Sr. Vice President (Marketing), Lifestyle International, says, “The plus size fashion segment has immense potential but is currently under serviced. Our plus-size brand Nexus addresses the growing segment and offers contemporary fashion choices. The collection is trendy, globally inspired and embodies our belief that real fashion is not limited by size.”\n\nEasy connect on ecommerce\n\nWhile not many brands have launched an exclusive plus-size line, brands like Mustard, Gia by Westside aLL and PlusS have been a big hit among buyers. With the advent of online retail, more e-tailers found the opportunity to expand on e-commerce. FabAlley, a popular fashion brand introduced Curve, a plus-size segment, on noticing that many of their customers demanded trendy plus-size clothes.\n\n“As we continued to add more designs and collections, we noticed an interesting development. Many customers were demanding for the same styles in plus-size clothing because the options were limited to Indian ethnic wear in plus-size segment. As the demand grew, we decided to launch Curve,” says Shivani Poddar, co-founder, FabAlley.\n\nAlso, the ease of trying, buying and returning has helped more customers in this segment shop on e-commerce marketplace. Rao, observes, “E-commerce contributes to the growth of plus-size fashion primarily because of ease of access, size availability and convenience that it provides.”\n\nHe further says that plus-size fashion is no longer confined to boring colours and loose silhouette and many brands are helping this evolution by bringing global trends to the segments like cold shoulders, off-shoulders, ripped denims and bright prints, among others.\n\nPersonalization boosts demand\n\n“I did not have serious plans to launch an exclusive plus-line clothing until requests kept increasing, and now doubling. As I started taking more and more requests to personalize designs in this segment, I am thinking to launch a new collection. People in this segment want more variety in terms of collection and sizes and this will be the next trend,” says Ranu Bathwal, founder of online pop-up store Pop Up Galleria.\n\nWhile one size does not fit all and standard sizes for all is one of the major challenges to the segment, retailers have understood the importance of personalization which is further leading to the success of many brands.\n\nMore brands join the bandwagon\n\nAlthough the India plus-size market may not be as big as the US market, which is estimated to be $25 billion market, the demand is not any less. Larjjosa, Amydus, Revolution Plus Size, ASoS Curve are some of the recent etailers that are steadily gaining popularity. NeceSera founder Riddhi Jain who has recently launched lounge wear clothing says that the demand for this segment has made her reconsider to launch an exclusive line. Even though NeceSera does not have a full line of plus-size clothing,\n\nShe says, “As a retailer you have to go along with the trend because there is demand and many international designers are also launching plus-size clothing. A few years ago the scenario was completely different but now the customers have changed, and so have the demands. Keeping this mind, in the next few months we are preparing to bring out plus-size products.”\n\nRiddhi adds that NeceSera products don’t focus on the collection for millennials and it is made for all age groups, and this will continue with plus-size clothing as well.\n\nBike Rental Services is now getting organized in India. The unorganized service concept that started in Goa is now functional across leading major metros and semi-urban locations across India with nearly a dozen of startups organizing this unique service space along with leading investor groups who are betting big on the growth potential of this alternate emerging public transport model.\n\nThe public transportation system in India is hardly able to match its current requirement, radio cabs are an expensive model in comparison and the three wheelers-on-call is facing acute shortage due to growing high demand. Similarly, tourist locations also garner high demand during peak seasons with public and private sector service providers not being able to cater to the year-on-year growing demand. An additional model like BRS, which is efficient and affordable, can prove to be highly beneficial for promoting tourism and managing public grievances.\n\nEfficient and Affordable Transport System:\n\nThough there has been strong support from government bodies into incorporating BRS as an additional transportation model to ease out the existing over burdened models, even private players, apart from investor groups, are keenly investing into this model understanding the huge gap and opportunity between the current requirement and the existing delivery model, especially in Tier I & II locations in India. Non metro locations in India are heavily dependent upon existing public transport system for intra-city travel with a small number of three wheelers and private cabs.\n\nTwo wheelers are most preferred in non metro locations for various reasons like low cost of acquisition, high mileage, low cost of servicing and road conditions and access.\n\nRapid Urbanization & Migration:\n\nIndia is a developing nation and the rapid infrastructure development in progress across its Tier I & II locations has prompted the emergence of new residential and commercial spaces, thereby, creating additional burden on the existing public transport model. Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune are good examples that saw their rapid transformation into IT cities. This development alone in Bengaluru led to an increase in its population by nearly 75% from 7 million to 12.3 million people between 2007 and 2017.\n\nStudent migration:\n\nAs per available data (2011 census), over 80 lakh people migrated to various states for the purpose of education and this provides a huge opportunity area for BRS providers as most students are used to riding two-wheelers and prefer it to any other forms of transport vehicles. Many leading BRS providers are already offering long term rentals to students in the form of ‘Rent-to-Own’ models, wherein, the student gets vehicle ownership after a specified period.\n\nE-Commerce and Corporate Houses:\n\nThe growth of ecommerce has been phenomenal in India with the market size expected be around $63 billion by 2020 growing at CAGR of 44%. India is expected to become the second largest ecommerce market in the world by 2034. A huge demand for products come from Tier II & III locations where people have limited or no access to leading brands or products of their choice. BRS providers have actively tapped into this growing model by providing vehicular access for last mile delivery by partnering with logistic service providers.\n\nCorporate Houses have also seen the potential in the BRS model as a mean to save company cost during outstation travels for its mid and lower category workforce and also an employee benefit program through leased ownership of two-wheelers for its deserving candidates, especially in newer developed commercial locations that do not have proper public infrastructure facilities in place.\n\nSmart phones and Internet penetration:\n\nTechnological advancements in the last one decade have redefined our lifestyle and our service expectations. Availability of affordable smart phones and data packets has further propelled our dependency on smart phone usage for every personal and professional aspect of our lives. India has over 70% of its population in the working class category and the number of smart phone users is bound to grow exponentially in the coming years with an estimate of over 530 million smart phone users with nearly 360 million internet users by the end of 2018.\n\nWhile the growth of BRS in India can also be attributed to the growth of mobile telephony (online travel services / online hotel bookings / online travel planning / Online food services / Online vehicle bookings), other important factors that drove this business concept was the need of an alternate system that was efficient and affordable for the masses.\n\nIncredible India:\n\nMost of India’s tourist destinations are located in tier I & II locations and a majority of these locations witness high demand during peak season. Tourists only have the options of Cab and Bus services and of three wheelers in select few locations. These services cannot cater to the high growing demand and also create a load on the existing infrastructure apart from becoming more expensive year on year due to high demand on low supply. BRS can play a very important role in such locations especially with couple travelers who prefer efficient and affordable travel options. This will also reduce the load on existing public transport system with many travelers having an alternate option at nearly the same cost. Many BRS providers are also evaluating e vehicles (e-bikes) for deployment at World Heritage locations.\n\nThough this is a nascent stage for BRS in India, the BRS landscape has seen the rise of many players in the last one year with strong funding support from domestic and global investors. There is an equal opportunity of growth for BRS across metro and non-metros in India as the existing public transport system cannot match up to the rising demand in metro locations and other services like radio cabs and three-wheelers are expensive in comparison. Also, the growth of these existing services has led to huge load on the prevailing infrastructure. The non-availability of many of these services, especially in the peak seasons, creates a huge window of growth opportunity for BRS in the non-metro locations. In both scenario’s and taking a cue from the success of this service from Goa, BRS is going to one of the most preferred services in the coming few years.\n\nThis article has been authored by Namit Jain, founder, ONN Bikes.\n\nLuxury has different meanings for different people. To some consumers, luxury goods provide a means to a better lifestyle, while others adapt luxury goods to their existing lifestyle. Riding on this wave, the luxury floral gifting industry has evolved with the ever-changing interests of the consumers.\n\nFrom buying red roses at a nearest florist to handpicking imported lilies and delivering bouquets with personal messages at midnight, the floral gifting industry has evolved with the ever-changing consumer interests. Today, as occasions to buy flowers have multiplied, so has the spending capacity of a consumer, who wouldn’t mind spending as much as even Rs 10,000 for a bunch of flowers. And it’s no surprise that for a country which celebrates every special occasion with flowers, the luxury floral gifting occupies about 30% of the market share in the gifting ecosystem.\n\nAccording to Brandzstorm India MD Ujjval Saraf, luxury is no longer a status symbol in India, but has become a viable lifestyle for a vast majority. And global brands need to evolve quickly and learn to adapt within the local environment.\n\n“Luxury is the new-found love of the Indian retail sector. Aspirational consumers with disposable incomes are the target, and the sector is growing at a rapid pace, thanks to international luxury brands setting up their stores across the country. Over the last decade, the Indian luxury market has been in the spotlight for global luxury brands with a growing presence. The Indian luxury market, valued at about US$ 18.5 billion at the end of 2016, has the potential to cross US$ 100 billion mark over the next 7-8 years,” he says.\n\nWhile luxury gifting has picked up pace in India, premium floral gifting alone is pegged at $3 billion, says India’s latest entry to the luxury floral industry Interflora’s CEO Tarun Joshi. He explains, “There are three key occasions for which people buy luxury gifts and luxury flowers- festivals, personal occasions like birthdays and anniversaries and corporate gifting. About 24 lakh people are online every day just to buy gifts for their near ones. Luxury floral gifting alone accounts to 30% of the total gifting ecosystem.”\n\nInterflora, an international brand, recently opened its doors to Indian market and the online gifting portal is available in Delhi, Mumbai and soon in Bengaluru. While floral gifting has been a traditional market with a lot of importance given to touch and feel, the knowledge about flowers among consumers is changing, which is giving heels to the luxury floral industry, says Joshi.\n\n“Earlier, bouquets in India meant roses, lilies and sometimes carnations. Now, the consumer is aware of international variety of orchids, imported lilies and others. Also, they are realizing the importance of the longevity of premium flowers. Most of our flowers stay for minimum 5 days and can live up to 12 days under suitable weather conditions,” he stresses.\n\nIt’s not only the quality that these florists assure, but they also go an extra mile to ensure that the flowers are arranged the way you like them, with the combinations of your choice and at a given angle. Joshi highlights that although India has a largest consumer base, floral gifting has not been treated as lifestyle product and floral options are not available according to the seasonality, which is a major gap in the industry.\n\nBuying trend\n\nJoshi also highlights that the consumer who is willing to spend a minimum Rs 2,000 on a bouquet is more aware of life, colour combinations, high quality packing and vibrancy of flowers. “Red and white is no longer the preferred colour code for flowers and importance is given to packaging to make the flowers look like high quality product,” he says.\n\nTaking the market forward, Interflora is all set to join hands with a grocery supply chain and will soon debut in retail markets and shopping malls.\n\nTraditional stores flourish\n\nThe floral industry is mostly unorganized and organized brands constitute to about less than 5 per cent. While Interflora is open for offline retailing in malls, another luxury brand FernsNPetals is content with traditional outlets in busy areas with high footfalls. “We are not present in any mall and we do not wish to also. Our stores are accessible to anybody who is on the road and just feels like picking up flowers. We have a loyal customer base and we deliver to their convenience,” said FernsNPetals VP ( Retail) Anil Sharma.\n\nWith increasing demand for floral gifting online, the industry experts believe that convergence of offline and online presence is the way forward for the luxury floral industry.\n\nCity decked up with bright lights, glittery stars twinkling on every passing street, jingle bells outside every retail store and Christmas treats in almost every corner of the city. The celebratory season is right round the corner and people from all corners of the country are indulging in the festival spree. With just few days to go, the city malls have turned into a major Christmas and New Year destinations with all of them set to offer their customers with an extra dose of excitement through different events, activities, décor, offers and what not. Christmas fascinates all of us in myriad ways. We love the food, we love the decoration and we just love buying presents and celebrating with friends and family. Since Christmas this year has also brought with it the immense happiness of a long weekend holiday, many are heading out for vacations, while other stayed back to indulge in shopping or just visiting the malls with their family members. Shopping complexes in the city, adorned with Christmas elaborate decorations, is increasingly becoming mega-destinations for people, who get a perfect ‘selfie moment’ posing with the extravagant decorations.\n\nThemes For The Season\n\nHoliday decorations for malls have become a vital part and are just as much a time consuming task. With so many different options available, the task of selecting a décor program can easily overwhelm anyone. And so, malls these days have started going according to particular themes in order to save themselves from going all over the place. Salim Roopani, Centre Director, Pacific Mall (Tagore Garden), says, “This year, we have come up with a unique theme to celebrate Christmas and welcome the New Year. We have already decorated the atrium with Christmas tree, Santa giving gifts and toys. The entire décor, conceptualized by PPZ which is the international mall management company, is giving a feel of New York in the mall.” While greens and reds are the central theme every year for most of the decorations, High Street Phoenix Mall is going the untraditional way this year with white and champagne red. Rajendra Kalkar, President (West), The Phoenix Mills Ltd., informs, “The frosty theme is a reminiscent of the icy winter days. The tree at Palladium stands 8.5 feet tall and is an elegant turquoise shade that adds to the classy and sophisticated ambience inside the atrium. We also have the Bauble tree installation at North Skyzone and the frosty bottles installations at Grand West Zone.” While Korum Mall has lined up a mix of awe- inspiring activities with various shopping delights, amazing gifts, surprises and enchanting décor to bring in the Christmas spirit. The mall spokesperson asserts, “The theme this year is Santa Land where we bring alive the home of Santa Claus in white colour. Our own in-house team has conceptualized the décor and all the décor elements like The Castle, Atrium hangings, Façade elements, are all designed in white. This festive season, entire mall will be decked up with a larger than life size Christmas tree, exclusive Santa land setup, colourful and elegant décor with glimmering lights in the mall and on the service road adjoining to the mall.” Christmas is also a festival of sharing and gifting and getting together and keeping in line with the same, Inorbit Mall’s central theme is ‘gifting’. Naviin Ibhrampurkar, Head of Marketing & Corporate Communication, Inorbit Malls (India) Pvt Ltd., elaborates, “The idea is to welcome shoppers to our mall and give them surprises. Right from giant entrance arches to drop down elements like stockings and stars and special workshops, carol singing and meet and greet with toon characters and Santa Claus are the highlights this Christmas.” While many opt for in-house designing team for the purpose, Phoenix United Mall prepared the concept in-house and passed it on to the outsource agency to create options from where the best option was executed.\n\nAll Set For The Starry Affair\n\nIndia and majority of western countries is all about bling and the city malls and markets are all covered in glittering decorations and glowing bulbs. It would not be wrong to say that the twinkle of Christmas lights in shopping malls have given an instant makeover to them. While mall owners go out of their way to make their malls look the most enticing one, they also do not refrain from organizing various activities in order to keep the customers engaged and excited. Sanjeev Sarin, General Manager, Phoenix United Mall, says, “The mall is well prepared for the upcoming holidays, by offering a perfect mix for every age group; it will house a handloom flea, Christmas parade and giant hot wheels activity among the other activities at the centre. The wreath tree displayed at the centre of the Atrium, connected through large size rings with Christmas tree foliage and crystals all around, which is 40ft. long and one of its kind initiative will catch many eyeballs.” While the High Street Phoenix Mall has a ‘Christmas Parade’ on 25th December that will be led by Santa Claus, followed by toy soldiers, elves, fairies, the musical band and some very fun mascots around the mall between 5:00 pm to 6:30 pm. “We also have the Wish Circle where High Street Phoenix plays the role of a Santa. We create a set of carefully curated and highly-desirable gifts from select in-house brands, the pictures of which have been posted on social media along with some information. As a customer, one needs to make a wish and comment on why they would like that particular product this Christmas. The most deserving one will receive that product as a gift. One can also go to the mall, place #HSPWishCircle tags on their favourite products and brands shortlisted by the mall. Customers will have to find these products in the store and take selfies tagging High Street Phoenix and the brand they are wishing for,” elaborates Rajendra Kalkar.\n\nInorbit Mall, on the other hand, has planned an extravagant 10 day Christmas celebration for its shoppers. Naviin Ibhrampurkar asserts, “The excitement doubles with a plethora of activities and workshops around art, craft and puzzle games. Patrons can indulge in these activities and stand a chance to win attractive gifts and shopping vouchers. The shoppers will also be gratified with gifts, shopping vouchers and Christmas cookies. Inorbit has a larger than life giant stocking placed at the center of the atrium which will be called the ‘surprise gift zone’. Shoppers have to enter this zone to win a surprise and there are assured surprises for everyone. Another zone is the ‘sweet gift zone’ where a chocolate elf will be making chocolates and distributing them to kids. Last but not the least, we also have an igloo with a snowman which also is an experience zone and a photo point for shoppers visiting us.” While major celebrations have already kickstarted at Pacific Mall with outstanding performances like Shooting Star and CYR Wheel act by international artists that took place on the first weekend of the month. Other than these activities, the mall also hosted a 3-days Christmas Carnival “Pacific Late Nights” for the customers from December 15-17 which treated customers with the lip smacking food, live band entertainment and chic fashion shopping options. Salim Roopani maintains, “The décor at the mall is unique as always and this time we have installed a replica of Statue of Liberty inside the main atrium which is 45 feet taller and 9 feet at the bottom and the weight of the same is 1,000 kg. The décor has become very popular with the customers and especially children who are getting fascinated with the feel of visiting New York in Delhi.” Also, in line with the out-of-the-box decorations, Korum Mall has placed a White Castle full of gifts, and also a larger than life oversized Christmas tree beautifully lit up at the mall atrium.\n\nJingling All The Way\n\nNo party or no festival is complete without music and India is known for its love for music. While High Street Phoenix Mall has a music property Awestrung where music artists and bands perform at the festival square on every last Friday of the month, this month for the Christmas celebrations, the mall is hosting two music bands – Parvaaz and Parekh & Singh on 22nd December 2017. “Inorbit Mall in Hyderabad is hosting an open air movie screening this month, where shoppers can enjoy classic movies sitting in an open arena under the moon and stars. There are other acts like standup comedy performance, carol singing etc.,” informs Naviin Ibhrampurkar. Korum Mall, however, have been organizing various musical shows and karaoke nights.\n\nSanta’s Little Treats\n\nAnd, what’s Christmas without the much awaited Santa’s little treats, or rather, the treats from our favourite shopping malls. Christmas and New Year is the time when all the fashion and lifestyle brands are offering irresistible offers and discounts. Also, offering international holidays is quite trending among shopping malls and is also a hit among consumers. “We are running the Shop & Win Campaign from 15th December 2017 to 28th January 2018. Anyone who shops for Rs. 5,000 from stores in High Street Phoenix and Palladium can get lucky to win a BMW X1! We also have other bumper prizes such as international holiday, domestic holiday packages and other gift vouchers available at High Street Phoenix and Palladium. Apart from this, we are also promoting the kids category in our mall from 15th to 25th December 2017. Shop for Rs.3,500 from any of the participating brands in the promotion (Mothercare, The Children’s Place, Hamleys, UCB Kids, Pepe Kids, Adidas Kids, Tommy Hilfiger Kids, US Polo Assn. Kids, Les Petits, Claires)and get an Orama World Card worth Rs.300,” asserts Rajendra Kalkar. While at Inorbit Mall, brands are going on an early EOSS this year; Korum Mall will gift one lucky couple a trip to Budapest during the Christmas festive season. Pacific Mall is also giving its customers a chance to win international holidays. “Customers can shop for Rs.15,000 or above from anywhere in the mall between 3rd Dec 2017 to 31st Dec 2017 and stand a chance to win the bumper prize of international holiday for a couple and they also stand a chance to win gift vouchers worth Rs.50,000 every weekend of the month,” informs Salim Roopani. Phoenix United Mall will also be running a special Shop N Win Festival at the mall.\n\nFor The Better Of Society\n\nApart from fun, frolic and all the glitterati, Christmas also calls for caring and serving others. Rajendra Kalkar informs, “We are currently hosting the ‘Digital Kitchen’ campaign between 29th November to 31st December, an online game that lets you donate towards serving fresh and hot cooked meals for underprivileged children at the Smile Foundation. Choose from 4 different and simple recipes to cook digitally with the help of the user friendly kitchen assistant to stir up a quick meal. For every meal you cook virtually, High Street Phoenix will ensure that a child gets a freshly hot meal.” Inorbit mall hosts “The Tree of Smiles” campaign across its 5 locations. With this campaign, Inorbit gives its shoppers an opportunity to play Santa for underprivileged kids. Through this campaign, patrons can buy gifts like stationery, toys etc. and drop it in the giant stocking set up at the mall. Once the collection drive is over, the gifts are handed over to an NGO. Similarly, Pacific Mall takes the initiative to distribute free food to around 500 people in the nearby slums on the morning of 1st January. Meanwhile, Phoenix United Mall is tying up with NGOs at the city and will be showing the kids, latest movie at the cinema theatre and will give away goody bags from Santa.\n\nOverall Investment: What It Takes\n\nOf course Christmas is about giving and decorations and celebrations, but what exactly goes into these decorations and how are these helping shopping malls in gaining more footfall? Rajendra Kalkar from The Phoenix Mills Ltd., says, “We strive to bring the best visual experience during Christmas and New Year by adding décor elements across the various zones. It’s not just the mall décor but also the retail stores that showcase interesting visual merchandizing that blend in with the festivities.” For Inorbit Mall, the “investment varies anywhere between Rs.15- 20 lakhs per mall” which involves media spends, décor, on ground activations, manpower, special acts and giveaways to customers. For Korum Mall as well, the investment that goes into the overall Christmas celebration is “around a seven digit figure sum”.\n\nAlso, while demonetization and the implementation of GST had many adverse effects on retail market of India, Salim Roopani feels, “No doubt, demonetization did impact sales initially but then that was very short lived and our footfall was not affected, but it has only increased steadily. There has been a substantial growth over last year in all aspects and we look at creating a new benchmark in business again this New Year. In December, when the festivities hit the peak with Christmas and New Year and the winters at its peak, apparel retailing is at its best when people indulge in impulse buying. While others too voiced the same opinion, it would be interesting to see how Christmas and New Year brought in more or lesser sales this year. Till then, Merry Christmas and Have a Lovely New Year\n\nThey say the first thing that someone notices about you is your feet and your footwear, so why not invest in the best pair of footwear that would enhance your personality to the very best. Footwear has evolved from being just a mere necessity as a protection for your feet to an important accessory that ups your fashion game right away. According to Businesswire, India is the second largest global producer of footwear after China, accounting for 9 percent of the annual global production of 22 billion pairs. Presently about 90 percent of the footwear produce in the country is consumed by the domestic market and the rest is exported. The growing Indian fashion and lifestyle market has given an impetus to the footwear industry as well.\n\nMarket Scenario\n\nFootwear industry in India is very optimistic right now with growing awareness about the latest trends and consciousness among consumers. Affirms Ishaan Sachdeva, Director, Alberto Torresi, “Be it men’s category or women’s, footwear have now become a necessary style statement for everyone. A lot of western influence can also be noticed these days where people are inclined towards styles like Oxfords taken from Europe and Brogues from Ireland.” This industry has seen a tremendous growth in the last few years. The demand for footwear products in India is increasing with each passing day. Harkirat Singh, Managing Director, Woodland, says, “Indian footwear industry is approximately between Rs.30,000 crores to Rs.40,000 crores. And this can grow up to 100 percent by next 5 years provided the right policies and tax structure. This market is shared between organized and unorganized segment. The organized segment caters to about one third of the market while unorganized players fetch the remaining 70- 75 percent market which essentially falls under micro, mini, small and medium enterprises.” With the rising disposable incomes of the customers, India’s domestic footwear market is booming. Rising incomes, advent of globalization, improved employment and living standards in the country has led to the expansion in the size of this market. Anupam Bansal, Executive Director, Liberty Group, agrees and says, “Also, consumer’s increased exposure to plastic money and imposition of GST is going to provide more organized retailing and trade transparency in long term. Government of India has already commenced the “Make in India” campaign which has been proving beneficial in boosting manufacturing in India. Secondly, due to the ever increasing internet penetration and adoption of internet and the overall ecosystem for e-commerce falling in place, the last decade has been the best for this industry.”\n\nEvolving Shopping Behaviour\n\nInstant awareness and aspirations for the latest global trends with the advent of technology has resulted in frequent shopping behaviour of consumers. According to Farah Malik, MD and CEO, Metro Shoes Ltd., demand for footwear is expected to remain strong over the forecast period. The category is anticipated to register a retail value CAGR of 7 percent at constant prices, with sales reaching Rs.778 billion in 2021. Farah Malik further elaborates, “The way consumers are spending their money on various items has changed in recent years. With the ever-increasing penetration of internet and social media, the purchasing behaviour of Indian consumers has changed dramatically. Urbanization is taking place in India at a dramatic pace and is influencing the life style and buying behaviour of the consumers. The factors that affect buying behaviour and draw customers to the shopping centers include space, ambiance and convenience and moreover an array of choice under one roof. The growth of integrated shopping malls, retail chains and multi-brand outlets is evidence of consumer behaviour being favourable to the growing organized segment of the business in the metros. Also, global fashion and lifestyle brands have suddenly started betting big on small cities of India.” Also, footwear now is an integral part of the outfit. It can make or break an outfit. The consumer in the present era is no longer the same simple, subtle and single- minded consumer he used to be a decade ago. Now, they prefer having a variety of footwear options. “The consumer has become more technological savvy, extensively prone to digital marketing and practices, fashion conscious, demanding the latest trends and contemporary styles and voguish in a certain manner. The growing footwear segment along with the rising brand consciousness, rising discretionary incomes which consequentially leads to higher propensity to buy along with rising fashion consciousness and increasing share of organized footwear market led to an enormous growth in footwear consumption,” maintains Anupam Bansal.\n\nThere has been a shift from being constraint to only a few types of footwear styles to a craze of owning different types of footwear for different occasions. Harkirat Singh feels, “Unlike earlier times when people used to own lesser number of shoes because they preferred wearing the same pair to office, to parties, for tea, etc., people today need different kinds of shoes for different occasions. For example, a fitness enthusiast would need running shoes for jogging or exercising, formal shoes for office, trendy and stylish shoes for parties and casual shoes for a casual outing, etc. Secondly, with trends changing very fast, brands are offering varied collections for varied seasons. So, when people visit shopping centers, they see a wide variety of footwear from different brands and that induces them to buy more. Furthermore, promotional offers, discounts, etc. also contribute in making their shopping more easy and convincing.” He further maintains that the advent of footwear retail in apparel stores, the later being a bigger sector, has lead to a massive growth in sales of footwear and thereby growth in this industry. While Ishaan Sachdeva asserts, “With an increased contribution in household income and change in spending patterns, the footwear sector is experiencing a great boom. Footwear is not just a part of wardrobe but has become a huge status symbol these days.”\n\nFurthermore, talking about different categories in footwear, Farah Malik asserts, “At present, men’s category contributes around 60 percent of sales in the footwear segment as against women’s share of 30 percent. Men’s footwear market is growing at a CAGR of 10 percent. The women’s segment, however, is growing at a much faster CAGR of 20 per cent.”\n\nGrowing Opportunities\n\nIndian market, especially the footwear market, has a lot of scope. The Indian footwear industry is gearing up to leverage its strengths towards maximizing benefits. Resource strength of India in the form of materials and skilled manpower is a comparative advantage for the country, among other things. Ishaan Sachdeva says, “The increasing significance of footwear is leading to an upsurge in the demand of footwear day by day which is further leading to higher growth prospects of footwear industry. The easy availability of varied styles is also increasing brand loyalty amongst the customers. The advent of such huge varieties of footwear is growing the potential of footwear industry even in tier-II and tier-III cities as the people are becoming more and more brand centric in these cities as well.” As said many times, rural areas are where the real India lies. The organized sector has definitely realized that and is now moving towards the hinterlands of India. Anupam Bansal affirms, “India has a lot of potential in tier-II and tier-III cities and towns and therefore, Liberty is constantly entering these towns and tapping the potential market. Approximately two-third of the consumer market is dominated by the urban market and rest is located in the rural areas. It is something that needs to be worked upon.” Harkirat Singh from Woodland points that the Indian retail sector is set to grow substantially over the next few years, as the reach of organized retail would gradually spread to smaller towns and under penetrated areas. “Today consumers in tier-II and tier-III cities are aware about the domestic and international brands across categories. The market has evolved and there is a lot of potential. Currently, tier-II cities contribute a large percentage in the total sales; however, tier-III cities are catching up in terms of sales and are expected to grow exponentially by FY 2020,” he says. Furthermore, talking about online market share in the hinterlands of India, Farah Malik from Metro Shoes, apprises, “Mobile technology is revolutionizing the tier-II and tier-III markets and an online retailer must not ignore this segment. Women are the driving force in tier-II and tier-III online retail markets.”\n\nAlso, with a considerable rise in consumption of trendiest and most comfortable pair of footwear, consumers today do not mind paying higher for quality products as they now understand that ‘higher price definitely means better quality’. Harkirat Singh agrees, “India is a price sensitive market. But today consumers do not hesitate in paying more for quality, innovation and technology. We offer tech footwear which are water proof, anti- microbe shoes, non- skid shoes, etc. and people actually pay for these premium tech collections happily.” Apart from quality, people also look for good customer service which ultimately makes their store visit more satisfying. Farah Malik explains, “Customers remain loyal if the brand delivers on quality and a good customer service experience and are willing to pay extra for superior customer service. If you look at the millennials, they are the first generation who is willing consciously to spend more for better quality, for sustainability, for traceability. I think there is a change. Moreover, delivering excellent customer service experience along with consistent quality is imperative for any brand to retain customers.”\n\nChallenges Ahead\n\nWhile the footwear industry is set for an exponential growth in the times to come, there are many challenges that are continuously erecting roadblocks in the process. “The industry is already working towards consolidating the growth. This has seen technology being the key element in making things possible to enhance growth. Many institutes have blossomed to provide retail professionals to the industry which will help in the long run. The government initiatives to taper down the real estate demands and make the pricing more pragmatic will also give a boost to the retail industry and push it to a higher growth path,” says Anupam Bansal. Talking about other challenges facing the industry right now, Farah Malik maintains, “The unorganised retail market is the most dominant and popular mode of retailing and purchase destination for the majority of India’s 1.3 billion population. Like food habits, footwear fashion changes every 100 kilometers. For example, the shortest heel preference in Chandigarh is the longest preferred in Kolkata. Hence, fashion footwear has always been dominated as well as successfully managed by local retailers. The unorganized footwear industry also enjoys the advantage of the passion and zeal of its business owners that is difficult to replicate across employees and store personnel. Also, footwear retailing primarily involves touching the feet of our customers as part of service and hence the front end does not attract the best manpower in terms of education, technical expertise and sophistication.” Apart from these, Harkirat Singh point out that product counterfeiting is another big challenge for the organized footwear industry. “Organised sector is something we cannot avoid because it’s the bigger chunk of the market. But the real problem lies in stopping the counterfeit products; its easy to sell fake shoes for the unorganized retailers but that ultimately hampers the brand image as consumers start associating the quality and performance of a fake product to the brand. We try to curtail that through legal processes where we conduct raids, seize counterfeits and apply to some suit in the court, etc. But that still possess as a big challenge for us, especially in a country like India where we don’t have too many laws against counterfeit, he asserts.\n\nIn-Trend And Forthcoming\n\nFootwear trends as such are difficult to forecast as they tend to change frequently with every season. Furthermore, its also true that in fashion, trends have their way of repeating themselves over time and footwear sue is no exception. According to Ishaan Sachdeva, “A drastic shift has been witnessed from the mainstream lace-ups and slip-ons to styles such as monk straps, oxfords, brogues and tassels. Then plimsolls that are inspired by the British culture are another shoe style that have gained massive acceptance in the recent times. Not just by the younger generation but plimsolls are preferred by celebrities as well. Talking about the women footwear trends, boots are always preferred by them. Women are investing in stylish ankle and desert boots. Boots with block heels are also quite in vogue these days. Another shoe style, sneakers makes an ideal choice for daily wear.” In the past, comfort was the most important factor during the selection of footwear. However, with the advent of media and increased global travel, Indians have become style conscious. “Fashion footwear with comfort is now the trend in the market. Consumers have also started shopping for shoes that compliment and accentuate their clothes,” maintains Farah Malik.\n\nAccording to Singh from Woodland, trends keep changing because every season now has new colours, features, etc. coming up and Woodland brings in trends from its fashion houses in Italy and Hongkong. For the forthcoming season, “Woodland is coming up with technology driven footwear and apparels”. While Alberto Torresi is soon launching its new collection which is a “sweet hybrid of Italian and Indian footwear”, Liberty’s Autumn/Winter collection is going to transform the idea of being elegant and sensational without compromising on comfort. Meanwhile, Metro Shoes have launched its new evening and bridal shoe collection.\n\nThe Way Forward\n\nGoing forward, with expansion in retail sector and technological advancements, footwear market is amongst the fastest emerging sectors in the fashion industry. According to Ishaan Sachdeva, “The demand for footwear products in India is to expand in the coming years as the customers do not compromise both with comfort and style.” Farah Malik further asserts, “I believe the footwear industry has been recognised by the Government of India as a focus sector in the ‘Make in India’ mission whether we do it for India or we do it for the world. The challenge for Indian footwear industry is lit large but anticipating India to become amongst top 5 superpowers by 2030, our consumption rates can reach as high as 7-8 pairs. In such a scenario, India would need to produce anywhere between 8-10 billion pairs considering yearly population growth. With global integration of Indian industry, rapid change in lifestyle, income growth at bottom of the wealth pyramid, footwear industry is expected to grow by leaps and bounds. For the Indian footwear to explode and deliver, favourable government policies, infrastructure, removal of high doses of taxation, infrastructural support in capacity building, skill education and technology up gradation, brand building exercise should be initiated expeditiously no later than now.”\n\nOnline to offline sales is a major transition point for any smartphone maker but this year has seen many biggies like Xiaomi, Vivo and Motorola take the offline route. Mobile retail stores are not only influencing buyers to make a better choice, they will also play a major role in capturing distributors’ margin in the long run.\n\nHighlights\n\nPhone makers vouch by touch-and-feel; say retail stores help connect with customers in comfortable environment\n\nNumber 1 smartphone brand Xiaomi targets 100 experience stores across the country in two years\n\nIt’s been a year of many firsts and new ‘experiences’ for giant smartphone makers in India as 2017 has been the year of experience stores. Earlier in the year, if Xiaomi launched its maiden MiHome store in Bengaluru and followed it up with 20 more experience and service stores across India, recently Motorola and Chinese smartphone makers Vivo and Coolpad debuted with offline retailing too. While the touch-and-feel experience in mobile retail has won hands down time and again against online retailing, these smartphone makers only restated the obvious- a customer prefers experiencing a phone before making the buying decision.\n\nCommenting about big players taking the plunge into mobile retail, Coolpad India CEO Syed Tajjudin said the experience stores create a comfortable environment for the makers to showcase their brand, allow customer interaction and create experiences for them before buying.\n\nHe says, “The smartphone industry is at its competitive best and of late it is more like a musical chair. No more than one brand has been able to sustain the No.1 tag for more than one or two quarters. A customer prefers human touch in the buying process and look-and-feel plays an important role than reviews and tech blogs. Hence, the experience or the retail stores play a key role in connecting with the consumers.”\n\nSpeaking about Coolpad’s retail strategy, Tajjudin maintains that Coolpad’s offline stores are not sale points and only focus on customer services. “We showcase newly launched products and upcoming models at these centres, but it is only to help the consumer make an informed choice. Our stores help buyers get a hands-on experience before they buy a product.”\n\nAs the tussle for the No.1 smartphone tag continues, Tajjudin stresses that they are building customer-centric models and have long term goals, and they are not doing anything different to capture the market share. “We don’t want to be the No.1 smartphone overnight but prefer steady growth,” he says.\n\nCoolpad plans to expand its experience stores and will soon launch 5 stores across India. It’s all set to announce its futuristic products shortly.\n\nA dream ride for the ‘Apple of China’\n\nWhile Coolpad believes in steady growth, over a little above three years since its inception, another Chinese brand experimented, bet on word of mouth and won the number game. Today, Xiaomi is labeled as the number 1 smartphone brand in India, and this journey has seen its own share of ups and down, but mostly ups. From a meagre 3% market share in 2015, the Chinese brand climbed up the charts in the third quarter this year with 23.5% market share. From shipping just 1,00,000 units in 2014, Xiaomi has sold 9.2 million units in just one quarter this year.\n\nTarget 100\n\nAs Xiaomi continues to crash all sale records in India, in May this year, it dived into offline retailing and launched Mi Home stores. Commenting about the retail strategy, Xiaomi India MD Manu Kumar Jain said, “Offline sales are about 10-15 per cent of our total sales and we expect this to grow to 20-30 per cent in the next few years. In the coming months, we will expand Mi Homes and ensure they are profitable before we add more.”\n\nThe company intends to set up 100 Mi Homes in India over the next two years, said Jain.\n\nMoto Hub- tapping the potential market\n\nWhile Motorola has undergone rejig and has reintroduced itself in the last couple of years, it has upped the ante with the launch of Moto Hub- a chain of mobile retail stores. The phone makers said that the stores were a key destination for consumers to experience the latest Motorola products, and get a hands-on demo of the entire product portfolio. These stores also house devices that are available exclusively online.\n\nSpeaking about the strategy behind Moto Hub stores, Sudhin Mathur, MD, Motorola Mobility India, said, “Strengthening the offline retail channel is one of the key priorities for us this year. The objective behind launching Moto Hub is to provide easy access of our products to consumers. They can experience the entire portfolio of Motorola products at convenient locations. Both e-commerce and retail play an important role in offering consumers’ choice and enabling meaningful experiences.”\n\nMotorola has launched Moto Hub stores in Noida and Mumbai and plans to open 50 stores by the end of this financial year.\n\nCommenting about what the phone maker is doing to capture the market, Mathur, said, “We are targeting top tier markets for our initial launch. Our endeavor is to reach as many key markets and TG clusters as possible with the current targeted 50 stores. We will plan the second phase once this roll out is complete.”\n\nIn numbers\n\nChinese brands including Xiaomi, Vivo and Oppo have a combined market share of 54%\n\nSharing the top slot with Samsung is Chinese giant Xiaomi\n\nVivo, which is stronger in offline market, holds the market share of 13%\n\nWhile Oppo holds 8% market share, Motorola stands at 7% market share\n\nSonam Kapoor is unquestionably India’s quintessential style icon. However, her uber chic appearances have been orchestrated and curated by a dedicated team of experts helmed by sister Rhea Kapoor. The fashion journey of the Kapoor sisters is globally discussed, locally inspired and homegrown in the truest sense. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the sisters have decided to build a high street fashion brand that embodies their style sensibilities. ‘Rheson’, aptly named after the stylish duo, is now exclusively available at India’s leading fashion retailer Shoppers Stop. The Kapoor sisters along with Govind Shrikhande, Customer Care Associate & Managing Director, Shoppers Stop Ltd. showcased the Rheson collection at a press meet today in Mumbai. A short film on the making of the brand was also presented.\n\n‘Rheson,’ is a combination of Rhea and Sonam, phonetically pronounced reason. With the pricing starting from Rs. 499-Rs 3599, Rheson is a high street fashion brand meant for the real Indian girl. The USP of this brand is that whilst the clothes are super fashionable - they have been curated by the most fashionable sisters in the country - they are also affordable without making any compromises on the quality as well as longevity of the garments. What’s more, Rheson will also be extremely easy to access since the brand will be exclusively available across Shoppers Stop stores in the country as well as on www.shoppersstop.com and the Shoppers Stop mobile app.\n\nSpeaking on the launch of Rheson, Rhea Kapoor states that, \"Sonam and I wanted to create a brand keeping the Indian girl and her sensibilities in mind. It was also essential for us to have control over the quality, pricing and styles and provide attention to detail, which we have done. Since we are the customer, it was easy to cater to the customer. We have a strong understanding of what girls want. According to me, glamor should be accessible to you, no matter who you are. People want to wear clothes that are comfortable and stylish in nature, a combination that is hard to find. Rheson has been created keeping the Indian customer in mind, her body type as well as what she likes to wear to office, with her friends, for festive occasions, for glam night outs, there is something for every girl. Furthermore, our brand is priced in an extremely competitive fashion so that no girl has to think twice before embracing her stylish side\"\n\nAdds Sonam Kapoor, “We wanted to work on something that is owned by us and had our personal touch on every level. So finally, we got a true partner in Shoppers Stop, as they saw the potential in this and finally we are here. The key to the birth of Rheson was to give girls a platform wherein they do not have to spend money to look stylish. It’s like accessible, affordable glamour. While everyone loves high fashion, its high street that everyone wears. We did not wish to create a couture brand. Our forte lies in the fact that our clothes should become your best friends. They are the ones you reach out to again and again, irrespective of the occasion or the fitness level of your body. Rheson is for the real Indian girl.”\n\nGovind Shrikhande, Customer Care Associate & Managing Director, Shoppers Stop Ltd., added, “When India’s leading fashion retailer collaborates with India’s leading fashion icons, it’s a match made in heaven. We are excited to partner with Rhea and Sonam Kapoor for their much-awaited fashion venture ‘Rheson’. Their signature style has been perfectly encompassed across the entire range. Rheson hits the right spot of affordable glamour and we are certain that it will be a grand success. We are glad to announce that Shoppers Stop customers will have exclusive access to ‘Rheson’ across our stores, on our online store www.shoppersstop.com and on the Shoppers Stop mobile app.”\n\nRheson will make its fashionable debut with two main themes – Inspiration from the Nostalgic 90s and the Mogra collection.
