Turn 10 Studios was established in 2001 under Microsoft Game Studios (now known as Xbox Game Studios) to develop the Forza Motorsport series for Xbox platforms. Ahead of the release of Forza Motorsport, we worked to refresh their animated logo ident. Our creative direction was based on the concept of 'Guiding Lights', a play on the advances that have been made with matrix headlights and the amount of control drivers now have with light projection. Using references from the world of art installations, beams of light are projected from headlights, the flash and reflection brings drama to the logo reveal and results in a slick and memorable ident.
