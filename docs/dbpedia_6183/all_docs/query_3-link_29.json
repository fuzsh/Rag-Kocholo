It was Project Gotham Racing by Bizarre Creations for the original Xbox and PGR 3 for the Xbox 360. This time, on the Xbox One, we have Forza Motorsport 5; the racing franchise from Turn 10 Studios. With new hardware comes new features like Drivatars and challenges.\n\nForza 5 keeps the same gameplay intact but some of the tracks and many vehicles featured in previous games are noticeably absent and the career mode doesn't really break any new ground.\n\nRead More - Forza Motorsport 5 Review (XBox One)\n\nTuesday, September 10, 2013\n\nWith all of the focus on hockey, soccer, and football currently at OS -- we can't forget about what is about to become one of the busiest periods ever for racing fans. Gran Turismo 6, Forza Motorsport 5, a new Need For Speed and more are coming to consoles in the next few months. We sat racing games beat writer Bishop Tart town in the Fact or Fiction hot seat to find out what he thinks of the genre currently.\n\nRead More - OS Fact or Fiction: Racing Games Edition\n\nFriday, May 31, 2013\n\nThe Fast & Furious movies are extremely successful, with over-the-top action surrounding them all. So it only makes sense to release a game to coincide with one of the movies. ItÂ’s just a real shame Activision chose Fast & Furious Showdown to try to show off the intensity of the Fast franchise.\n\nRead More - Fast & Furious: Showdown (360/PS3)\n\nWednesday, March 20, 2013\n\nRally games are a rare breed nowadays. The past several years, Milestone has been releasing rally games in Europe, but few of them have made it to American gamers. WRC Powerslide is Milestone's first Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network game to have a worldwide release, and it's unlike any other rally game you have ever played.\n\nRead More - WRC Powerslide Review (XBLA/PSN)\n\nTuesday, March 5, 2013\n\nWhen it comes to motocross games, there have never been a ton of options for us to choose from. And with the MX vs ATV franchise in THQ limbo, we have even fewer options. Luckily, Namco Bandai and developer Milestone have given us MUD: FIM Motocross World Championship: a motocross game with solid gameplay, but a few issues that severely hurt it.\n\nRead More - MUD: FIM Motocross Championship Review (PS Vita)\n\nWednesday, December 12, 2012\n\nCodemasters has a pedigree of making some outstanding racing games. From DiRT to GRID, they know what to do when it comes to developing them. But what about kart racers? Can Codemasters succeed in that specific genre of racing?\n\nFeaturing real-life drivers on overly exaggerated courses and crazy power ups, Codemasters sure hopes so with F1 Race Stars.\n\nRead More - F1 Race Stars Review (360/PS3)\n\nTuesday, December 4, 2012\n\nEutechnyx picked up the NASCAR license a few years ago and released NASCAR 2011: The Game. Unfortunately for them and Activision, it had numerous online issues, bugs, and a single player campaign that only lasted one season. With NASCAR the Game: Inside Line, Eutechnyx looks to fix all of those problems and make a NASCAR game that fans can truly enjoy from the first day.\n\nRead More - NASCAR The Game: Inside Line\n\nWednesday, November 7, 2012\n\nImagine if Criterion Games took their critically acclaimed game Burnout: Paradise and combined it with the Need for Speed universe and licensed cars. Now, come to the realization that it has happened. More like a mini-sequel -- Need for Speed: Most Wanted looks to have the same highly addicting multiplayer that Burnout: Paradise had, while still maintaining that same gameplay the NFS franchise is known for.\n\nRead More - Need for Speed: Most Wanted Review (360/PS3)\n\nTuesday, October 23, 2012\n\nBreaking off from the traditional formula Turn 10 Studios mastered, Forza Horizon takes you to a music festival in Colorado with open roads and an open world. With developers from Bizarre Creations, Codemasters, and other acclaimed racing developers, PlayGround Games is out to show people they are the next top-notch studio. They look to make the spin-off game just as successful as past iterations in the franchise.\n\nRead More - Forza Horizon Review (360)\n\nTuesday, October 16, 2012\n\nNBA 2K13 just released, and some of us are still fiddling with our lineups trying to get that perfect team for the Association mode. Trying to figure out your starting lineup is only the beginning. What about the role players that, might not be a high-scoring threat, can still help you in those tough situations? That's what Operation Sports is here for today, to help give you the six best role players (in no particular order).\n\nRead More - NBA 2K13: Six Best Role Players for Your Association\n\nWednesday, October 10, 2012\n\nPlayground Games, made up of ex-Bizarre and Codemasters employees, take the wheel (pun intended) on Forza Horizon. You start out the demo driving the Dodge Viper GTS, eventually race in a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X GSR, and then finally go behind a Ford Mustang Boss 429. From the first race, which takes place on a dirt road, you can easily tell past DiRT developers helped on this game with the feel of the cars on dirt.\n\nThe controls feel solid when driving off-road, and the cars handle appropriately. The cars will get loose, but no so much that you feel like you don't have control of where it's going. Overall, the gameplay felt solid and nothing that casual racing fans can't the hang of pretty quickly.\n\nRead More - Forza Horizon Demo Impressions\n\nFriday, October 5, 2012\n\nCodemasters has turned their F1 games into an annual release, and F1 2012 looks to add on to the success of the first two games with new modes and the same gameplay fans have come to know.\n\nHowever, the game might have used a playbook that played it too safe this year.\n\nRead More - F1 2012 Review (360/PS3)\n\nWednesday, September 26, 2012\n\nSome of our hoop-heads check in today with their thoughts on the NBA 2K13 demo. Is the game moving into must buy territory for them yet? Read on after the jump to find out!\n\nRead More - NBA 2K13: Demo Roundtable\n\nTuesday, September 25, 2012"
