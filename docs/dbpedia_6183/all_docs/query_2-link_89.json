        "text": "Alan Hartman (right), Image credit: Inside Sim Racing\n\nAs user Idle Sloth spotted on X (former Twitter), Alan Hartman announced his promotion on LinkedIn earlier this week. “Thrilled to be representing such an elite set of game creators in my new role leading Xbox Game Studios!” he wrote.\n\nOverall, Hartman spent more than 18 years at Microsoft, contributing to the development of the company’s gaming business. He will succeed Matt Booty, who led Xbox Game Studios for nearly six years.\n\nLast month, shortly after Microsoft completed its $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer announced a reorganization of Xbox leadership to help the company achieve its goal of creating an “expanded gaming content organization” and better managing its first-party studios.\n\nAs a result, Booty was promoted to president of Game Content and Studios. He will oversee the work of ZeniMax’s subsidiaries like Bethesda, Arkane, and id Software. Sarah Bond became president of Xbox, and Dave McCarthy became chief operating officer of Microsoft Gaming."
