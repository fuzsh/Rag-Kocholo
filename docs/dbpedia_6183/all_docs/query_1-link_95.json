        "text": "COLUMBUS, Neb. (News Channel Nebraska) - Looking at the walls of Glur’s Tavern in Columbus is like flipping through the pages of a history book.\n\nIt’s a book that’s about to start a new chapter.\n\nTodd Trofholz and his wife Carrie have owned the oldest tavern west of the Missouri River for 32 years.\n\nTheir last day as owners is Sunday.\n\n“I went in to get my knee looked at and they replaced my hip,” Trofholz said. “So I think my knee’s coming up next.”\n\nBut don’t worry, the bar that opened in 1876 and survived Prohibition isn’t closing.\n\n“That was my main concern because it’s been running all this time continuously,” customer Barb Siedlik said.\n\nIt’s a relief for regulars like Barb and Mike Siedlik.\n\n“As a kid, we’d just come over here all the time,” Mike said.\n\n“I’ve probably been coming in here… more than 50 years,” Barb said.\n\nTom and Deb Loseke have been customers for more than four decades. They even showed up on their wedding day.\n\n“Back then, everybody came here on their wedding day, so you couldn’t miss that opportunity,” Deb said.\n\nThe allure of Glur’s includes the food.\n\n“This grill might be 80 years old or so,” Trofholz said. “It’s the key to the taste.”\n\n“I think it’s just seasoned so well.”\n\n“I try to cook on not real high heat, you know, medium heat so I don’t burn ‘em.”\n\nThe bar’s state and national history draws visitors from all over the country.\n\n“Buffalo Bill supposedly pulled out a $1,000 bill to buy the house a round,” Trofholz said. “It said on the article on the wall, that William Bucher about fainted.”\n\nBut it’s really the personal history that keeps people coming to the 148-year-old tavern generation after generation.\n\n“You get to see a lot of people that you haven’t seen in a long time,” Mike Siedlik said.\n\n“Just about every single one of our class reunions have — Friday night or Saturday or sometime — we all come down to Glur’s,” Barb Siedlik said. “I mean, that’s just — Glur’s is one of the main staples of Columbus.”\n\n“It’s just in the thread of the community and one of the most important parts of our history,” Deb Loseke said.\n\n“People like coming here because of the people that are customers,” Trofholz said. “They come and see their friends.”\n\nThat will continue under the new ownership. But, like every fresh chapter, it won’t be the same as the previous.\n\n“My family’s been very supportive,” Trofholz said. “All of my kids, I made them work here. They always didn’t love it, but you know. My mom and dad helped and I had aunt and uncles that helped here.”\n\n“Yeah, it’s going to be hard.”\n\nTrofholz, though, will still be a witness as the pages of Glur’s Tavern history turn.\n\nAs the pages of Glur’s Tavern history turn, Trofholz will still be a witness.\n\n“Oh I’m sure I’ll wander in here,” Trofholz said. “There’s too many friends in here.”\n\nThe bar’s new owners are a group of men who Trofholz says intend to keep the historic landmark as a restaurant.\n\nClick here to subscribe to our 10/11 NOW daily digest and breaking news alerts delivered straight to your email inbox."
