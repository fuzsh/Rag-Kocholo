        "text": "When it comes to popular movies, there are plenty of playful pooches out there who simply steal the show. They might not always be the main characters, but their cuteness and how they move the story along makes them unforgettable!\n\nFrom adorable sidekicks to brave heroes ready to sacrifice it all, here are just a few of the movie star pups who left their paw prints on the big screen and our hearts.\n\nFamous Dogs in Movies\n\nToto in 'The Wizard of Oz' (1939)\n\nAmong the first of the pups to take center stage is Toto, Dorothy’s constant companion through the forests and over the yellow brick road of Oz. This tiny female Cairn Terrier, played by Terry, was braver than plenty of humans we know and totally loyal to his human.\n\nBehind the scenes, things weren’t quite as nice and shiny, with poor Terry actually suffering a serious injury. A co-star stepped on her paw during filming, spraining it and causing her to have to convalesce at Judy Garland’s home for 2 weeks until it healed up. She also earned $125 weekly, which was more than most of the other actors on set at the time!\n\nBruiser Woods in 'Legally Blonde' (2001)\n\nIf you’ve seen this movie, then you definitely know who Bruiser is. This pint-sized Chihuahua is an absolute scene stealer and not just because he was always dressed to impress, matching Elle’s pink-centric wardrobe. Bruiser was played by Moonie the Chihuahua. Fun fact: his human also helped train Gidget, the extremely popular ‘Taco Bell’ dog!\n\nHooch in 'Turner & Hooch' (1989)\n\nHooch, the slobbering Dogue de Bordeaux, is pretty much the definition of larger-than-life. Producers actually looked at over fifty different breeds, trying to find the right dog (not too big, not too small, but just right) to star opposite Tom Hanks. Seventeen-month-old Beasley was the main pup to play Hooch, along with his stunt double, Igor. The big lump of love made a huge impact as a sidekick but was an even more unforgettable co-star.\n\nFrank in 'Men in Black' (1997)\n\nFrank the Pug takes the cake for one of the cutest Pugs out there. Starring in Men in Black, Frank is actually an alien informant whose tongue is sharp enough to cut through just about anything. He offers sarcastic commentary and comic relief that actually stands up to the two main actors, and his small size does not stop him from leaving a huge impression on everyone who saw the movie. Plus, that suit? Pure Pug perfection.\n\nEin in 'Cowboy Bebop' (2001)\n\nEin, short for Einstein, is technically from an extremely popular anime series turned live-action, but to say he doesn’t make this list would be a crime. Seriously, this Welsh Corgi turned ‘data dog’ turned bounty hunter steals the spotlight in whatever scene he was in, especially partnered with the equally intelligent, but sort of crazy, Ed.\n\nChloe in 'Beverly Hills Chihuahua' (2008)\n\nChloe the Chihuahua might first seem like your everyday pampered princess, but she eventually winds up surprising everyone with her bravery and resourcefulness. We get to see her evolve from spoiled to street-smart in this fun, family-friendly romp where she carries most of the emotional weight. Played by the appropriately-named Deerhead Chihuahua, Angel, the real-life cutie beat out nearly fifty others for her role.\n\nOld Yeller in 'Old Yeller' (1957)\n\nIf you want to talk about iconic dogs in movies, then there is almost no name bigger than Old Yeller. This Labrador mix might not start as the main character since that role belonged to ‘his boy.' But his journey to help Travis grow up and learn to face loss and tragedy strikes a chord in the heart of every person who has ever read the book or watched the movie. For many of us, it was our first introduction to the heavy weight of love and loss, and that has stuck in us forever afterward.\n\nSamantha in 'I Am Legend' (2007)\n\nIf you don't know this sweet pup by name, you probably still recognize her as soon as she sets paws on screen. Samantha, or 'Sam,' is Will Smith's ever-present guardian and companion throughout the I Am Legend movie, where she protects, serves, and loves as long as she can. Her loyalty and companionship were, much as in real life, some of his only glimpses of hope and love in the universe, and she plays a pivotal role in both the story's narrative and the movie as a whole.\n\nBaxter in 'Anchorman' (2004)\n\nBaxter is the charismatic Ron Burgundy’s beloved companion. A ‘multilingual’ Border Terrier, Baxter’s on-screen moments are simply pure gold. Despite his small stature, he makes a big splash—and we aren’t just talking about when he was punted off a bridge! As quirky as the rest of the cast, Baxter helps take the whole movie to a whole new level and proves that even teeny-tiny characters really can have a huge impact.\n\nDog in 'Mad Max 2' (1981)\n\nThis precious pup gives Max a sense of purpose and at least a little bit of normalcy in a world turned upside down. It's his loss that spurs Max into the final climactic moments of the whole movie. The really cool backstory behind Dog is that he was adopted. Director George Miller went out to a local dog pound and found the mixed-breed dog, who was scheduled to be put down. After the movie was done and dusted, so many people wanted to take Dog home, but he eventually wound up with a forever home with the film's stunt coordinator!\n\nAnd there you have it, movie fans! From Bruiser's absolute sass to the loyalty of Samantha, Old Yeller, and Dog, there are a ton of different options for our favorite film pups. While we can't personally say which one is best (because they are all equally awesome), do you have a personal fave?"
