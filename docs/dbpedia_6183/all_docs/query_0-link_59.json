        "text": "Recently, my husband and I have started going for a walk together through the neighborhood, either just before or right after dinner. Sometimes we stop for an iced tea or to pick up a few things from our local market. We look into the windows of local storefronts, and walk by our favorite neighborhood gardens to see what's in bloom. When our dog is with us, we often stop to chat with other dog walkers.\n\nI thought we were just getting outside for a bit of fresh air and exercise, but it turns out we were also participating in a storied Italian tradition known as \"la passeggiata,\" from the verb passeggiare (to walk). The term describes taking a nightly walk through the town square, and it's worth adopting into your own routine, even if you don't have much of a town square to walk through. Here's how it changed my evenings for the better.\n\nHow la passeggiata has improved my nightly routine\n\nBefore I knew that this practice had a fancy Italian name, I had already begun to realize the benefits of getting out of the house for regular evening walks. Anecdotally, after completing a passeggiata, I have noticed that my mood has improved. Getting outside for a while helps me to stow the stress of the workday and given my husband and I a chance for some conversation, minus the distractions of household responsibilities and screens. I felt less tired, less uptight about what I'm going to make for dinner, and more excited and energized. My husband seems calmer and less stressed out as well. Even our dog goes into the evening with less nervous energy.\n\nOf course, there's always something to be said for the physical and mental health benefits of getting some exercise, but la passeggiata is about more than getting your steps in.\n\nA time for connection, not just exercise\n\nThe essence of la passeggiata is about more than hitting your daily quota for exercise, although that's certainly important. Rather, it’s about taking the time to enjoy some quiet time with your own mind (if you're walking alone), and to connect with others (if you're walking with a partner or a group). It's not a brisk walk for the purpose of raising your heart rate, but about taking in the sights, and maybe stopping to enjoy a beverage.\n\nThanks to our new nightly routine, we now know that the local pizza place has a special on Mondays, and that the rescue dog that lives down the street enjoys a good wrestling match with our enthusiastic grappler. We’ve found new neighborhood spots, like the schoolyard that doubles as sort of fenced dog park after hours, and discovered we live near to some of our co-workers, who we run into occasionally. It has made us feel much more connected to our community.\n\nTake pleasure in small moments\n\nWhen you're overwhelmed by stress, it can be hard to pause and take pleasure in small moments of joy and satisfaction. My evening walking habit has allowed me to revel in the small delights of blooming flowers, wagging tails, and summer breezes. Instead of counting down the days to a vacation or some other big event to finally let loose and enjoy myself, absorbing these daily glimmers has allowed me to be more grounded in the moment, and aware of the small pleasures offered by the world around me.\n\nGet away from screens\n\nBy turning our walk into a time for exploration, discovery, and connection, it has been easier to not only put away our phones, but to actually forget about them for a little while, abandoning the urge to refresh feeds and check messages. It's a refreshing break from a day spent with our screens in front of us, or on our minds when they’re not. According to the Mayo Clinic, like exercise, reducing screen time can improve your overall health, both physically and emotionally; I’ve definitely noticed some improvements in mood as well as my digestion.\n\nDon't discount the health benefits"
