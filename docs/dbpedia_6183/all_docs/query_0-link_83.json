        "text": "It was just a few days ago that this chain, which was founded here in Minnesota, announced it was closing several locations. And now the entire chain has filed for bankruptcy.\n\nIt's usually never good news when you hear that any business, whether here in Minnesota or across the country, has filed for bankruptcy. It often means that the end might be near for whichever business it is.\n\nBut not always, however. That's because there are several different kinds of bankruptcy filings. Like Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which is often referred to as the 'reorganization bankruptcy.' The U.S. Courts website explains exactly what Chapter 11 bankruptcy is:\n\nThis chapter of the bankruptcy code generally provides for reorganization, usually involving a corporation or partnership. A chapter 11 debtor usually proposes a plan of reorganization to keep its business alive and pay creditors over time.\n\nSo, it's not entirely bad news then, that the Italian restaurant chain, Buca di Beppo, has just filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. According to this Reuters story, Buca's parent company officially filed for bankruptcy proceedings on Monday. The filing stated it intends to keep its restaurants operating, though, with Reuters noting that its creditors 'support a bankruptcy restructuring and that day-to-day operations will continue as normal.'\n\nALSO INTERESTING: This Once-Popular Steakhouse Now Has No Locations Left in Minnesota\n\nIt was just a few days ago the family-style Italian chain said it was closing 13 locations (though none here in Minnesota) that were underperforming. And, in case you're curious, yes, Buca di Beppo was founded here in Minnesota back in 1993.\n\nBuca's website says the chain started in the basement of a Minneapolis apartment building, which is responsible for its unique name:\n\nWhat’s in a name? We have to go back to the beginning and look at where we started. In a basement! The name “Buca di Beppo” roughly translates as “Joe’s small place” in Italian.\n\nRestaurant Business says the chain was sold to its current owners, Earl Enterprises, back in 2005. It peaked in 2013 with 97 locations, including several here in the Land of 10,000 Lakes.\n\nBut since then, the chain has been steadily closing locations, including one here in our fair state, in Burnsville. That location closed several years ago after it sustained massive damage in a fire that broke out in June 2021. You can see below that only the sign remains of the previous Buca's location on Burnhaven Drive.\n\nThere are currently four other Buca di Beppo locations still open in Minnesota:\n\nSt. Paul\n\nMaple Grove\n\nMinneapolis\n\nEden Prairie\n\nAnd despite the recent news of several locations closing and now a formal declaration of bankruptcy, the Buca di Beppo brand is still going strong. It will continue to operate its 44 locations still open across the country while these proceedings are sorted out.\n\nBuca, with its large portions, family-style dining, and eclectic decor, is one of the more popular brands in the North Star State. And speaking of brands that were once popular but now only exist in our memories, keep scrolling to check out 50 beloved retail chains that weren't so successful and are not around anymore."
