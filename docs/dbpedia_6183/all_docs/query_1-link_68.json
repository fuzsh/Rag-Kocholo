        "text": "Microsoft and their 18-6 rule. Devs are usually not full time hires, they’re contracted for 18 months and then have to wait for 6 months before they can accept another contract.\n\nSo what this means for devs on the project is that they have to learn the engine, all the tricks etc in a very short period of time- and at the end of their contracts if they want to continue on with the project, have 6 months of forced unemployment.\n\nYou can kinda see might cause issues. It basically mandates that instead of the devs and artists don’t stick around to see the project through, and instead of the studio as a whole having 6yrs development time into the game, what they really have is 18 months development, four times.\n\nCorporate stupidity at its finest. The devs lose, the players lose, and Turn10/ Microsoft lose in the end due to development taking much longer (due to new people having to relearn things etc) and and having almost no one on staff at the end who actually did any development work on the game to fix issues.\n\nIt’s an insightful video, but it’s also comes from one particular perspective, and not one that should be criticized.\n\nAs I noted to a commenter on that video who pushed back on the idea that Esaki and Greenawalt should be gone, someone signed off on CarPG. Someone signed off on the Career mode. Someone signed off on every questionable and idiotic decision made to form the fatally-flawed foundation that this game rides on. This guy, however high up he made it to before he left, didn’t make the call to have the same inaccurate track models and details - one of the directors did. That whole crew of directors and managers all need to be gone, across the board.\n\nI agree. For the “big ticket stupidity” the directors need to be gone, but it does explain why the game, given its lengthy development schedule, came out as bad as it did. By the end of development, they had turned most of the staff over at least twice (if there was anyone who could do the forced 6 months with no employment thing) so the number of people with working knowledge of the “hows and why’s” on staff was ALWAYS low, and by the time they got it figured out, “sorry bud, your contract is up”.\n\nIt would seem that the only people who are actually on the turn10/ microsoft payroll are upper management (aka- the people who have no clue how things actually happen or how their product works).\n\nTo put it another way, If you were to order a meal at a restaurant and they turned over their entire staff four times during the preparation of that meal. how do you think it’s going to taste? Firing the waiter ain’t gonna fix it at this point- Microsoft would likely just replace him with some other corporate “yes man” and the franchise will just continue sliding faster down the drain.\n\nThis system has been in place for a while now, the problem is that games are taking longer to make than they used to so this form of employment is obviously having a detrimental effect on the products. It also likely leads to delays which extends development time as well as more bugs which in turn are then worked on by people who likely weren’t around when certain assets were made, which leads to even more time being spent on fixing them.\n\nUnfortunately i don’t see these practices changing and only expect things to get worse in the future. Its kind of stupid if you think about it though because the margin for success is so small that i don’t know how they think its worth doing it this way.\n\nThis is what happens when people with no actual experience with the end product are installed into positions which are supposed to facilitate the production of said product.\n\nThey have no passion for the product, no idea of the complexity involved, and real knowledge of the end users, beyond spreadsheets. They begin to see themselves and their continued employment as the most important thing at the company- not the products that made the company successful to begin with. They view their positions as the only truly important ones, because “anyone can (insert valuable skilled position here)”.\n\nSo they begin to cut corners on the skilled production labor, believing that their “processes” can eliminate the problems caused by their decisions- and it never works.\n\nQuality goes down, projects take longer, and costs go up- how do they fix that? By doubling down on their previous stupidity and trying to go even cheaper on the skill positions to “cut costs”… and the spiral continues until the business fails.\n\nAnyone who has ever worked as a skilled laborer in a production shop has dealt with this, or will eventually. Sales, marketing, management, and engineering all begin to lose sight of both what is being made, and how that happens. The larger the company, the more disconnected the “leadership” is- and the dumber the decisions get.\n\nWell if you watch the video he said he did the best job he could because he thought he could secure a full time position when in reality it was never going to happen. Im sure this deceptive practice is used with every new employee.\n\nWhile this is only one persons experience, im sure most can assume this was prevalent throughout the development of this game. New people come in, full time position dangled in front of them if they do a good job, dont receive proper training as the trainer leaves, person does the best they can hoping theyll get health care, trains a bunch of new people, crunch to finish for release, get an email saying thanks for the help leave your id card with security and see yourself out.\n\nI know business is business but you cant expect a successful release with this kind of structure. Like i said in the past when sequels were made every 2 years this wasnt as much of an issue, as there was probably more overlap from one game to the next. But to “build from the ground up”, where new tools and assets need to be created and used a year and a half is not enough.\n\nI think with this release its obvious the blame for what happened starts from the top down. Unfortunately the people out of a job had little to do with it. I just really cant believe they gave turn 10 studios an award for this game."
