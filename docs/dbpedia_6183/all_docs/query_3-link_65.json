The model allows patients to connect and play together in a safe and monitored environment, even if they're confined to their rooms.\n\nThe project was the result of a collaboration between Seattle Children's, Mojang Studios and Hive Games.\n\nThe server was designed and built by Henry Ou, MD, a pediatric otolaryngologist at Seattle Children's."
