        "text": "Since the first Forza Motorsport launched in 2005, the Forza franchise has been about falling in love with cars and building community. As a co-founder at Turn 10 Studios, I had the honor of working on the very first Forza Motorsport and have been with the studio for 20 years. In that time, we've grown considerably but, through it all, a constant has been our love for cars, pushing the limits of gaming technology, and creating a racing community for everyone. With less than two weeks to go before we release the brand-new Forza Motorsport globally on October 10, we wanted to share more of our vision for the game, explain how Forza Horizon titles have informed our racing sim, and share our approach for both new players and our core community.\n\nTo start, we've been asked why we didn't call this \"Forza Motorsport 8,\" and it's a fair question. From the beginning, we've designed the latest Forza Motorsport to be an evolving racing platform, with new content that adds to the experience of automotive entertainment through skill and competition. Last week we shared a little more about what players can expect with our evolving racing platform on forza.net. It's due to this shift that we didn't need a number in the title; we created a platform.On the Horizon\n\nIn 2012, our studio partners at Playground Games released the first Forza Horizon, putting their signature twist on open world racing while building within our ForzaTech engine. It's safe to say their work has made the Forza franchise even better. A lot has happened since our last Motorsport title, Forza Motorsport 7. Playground Games released two incredible games, Forza Horizon 4 and Forza Horizon 5, we moved into a new console generation with Xbox Series X|S, we've expanded our platforms across PC, Steam and Cloud Gaming, and Xbox Game Pass has become the best value in gaming and is synonymous with Xbox.\n\nWe're often asked about the difference between both titles within the overall franchise. Where Forza Horizon expresses its vision through freedom and exploration, Forza Motorsport focuses on competition and honing your skills - and both focus on accessibility, authenticity, and immersion in their own way.\n\nAs Motorsport's roots are within racing simulation, we wanted you to be immersed as soon as you start Forza Motorsport. You'll experience the beautifully rebuilt Maple Valley track in the 2024 Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray, followed immediately by the exciting Hakone circuit in Japan in the 2023 Cadillac V-Series.R. You can check out almost 18 minutes of initial gameplay of Forza Motorsport just below to see for yourself.\n\nForza Motorsport has a rich history of championing accessibility in gaming, innovations like the driving line have opened racing to millions of players. Forza Horizon 5 focused on accessibility and inclusive design from the first stages of development. Their innovative support for American Sign Language (ASL) and British Sign Language (BSL) in Forza Horizon 5's in-game cinematics was just one of their many accessibility features. All of us at Xbox embody the value that gaming is for everyone, and we're proud that Forza Motorsport continues this tradition. Whether it's the innovative Blind Driving Assists or One Touch Driving, thanks to the great work of our team and feedback from our incredible accessibility consultants, we've created our most accessible Motorsport ever.This is Forza Motorsport\n\nLet's talk a little bit more about what Forza Motorsport is at its core. We've used the period since our last launch to innovate, redevelop, and refocus on the very core of the game. The entire experience of racing at the limit, improving your skill, building up your car, and competing on the track have been completely rethought. Our goal was to create a live, connected, immersive, accessible, and ever-changing competitive racing platform that will evolve and grow with our community. We've created a more competitive, accurate, and rewarding racing experience thanks to huge, foundational improvements in our physics and AI - more than all previous Motorsports combined. If you know Forza, you will feel the difference immediately.\n\nAt launch we will have 20 tracks from around the world with multiple layouts, including 5 new-to-Motorsport tracks, and over 500 cars. And that's just the start. All the cars, tracks, features, and innovations are highly focused on our larger vision. Our hope is that you find the 10 or so cars that matter to you, and that these cars change over time, evolving with you as you build them and hone your skills. Our game will grow as you grow your skills, and as you find your place in this competitive and creative community. In short, we hope that you will fall in love with cars through skill and competition.\n\nWe can't wait to see you at the starting line. To everyone, welcome to Forza Motorsport.\n\nDan Greenawalt, General Manager, Forza Motorsport at Turn 10 Studios\n\nForza Motorsport is available October 10 on Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S consoles, Windows PC and Steam, and Cloud Gaming (Beta). Pre-order the Forza Motorsport Premium Edition in the Microsoft Store so you can pre-download the full game and play it up to 5 days earlier.\n\nSource: Xbox News\n\nRelated News\n\n1 Comment on Forza Motorsport Discussed by Turn 10 Manager\n\n#1\n\nUnregistered\n\nLooking forward for this, I hope it compares favourably to GT7, as it has a very disappointing single player mode.\n\nPosted on Oct 2nd 2023, 16:31 Edit | Reply"
