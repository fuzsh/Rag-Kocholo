        "text": "Thu, Jun 15, 2023 15:05 CET Report this content\n\nModern Times Group MTG AB (publ) (“MTG”) is announcing that its racing-focused portfolio company Hutch has teamed up with Turn 10 Studios, a well-known first-party video game developer within Xbox Game Studios and creators of the Forza franchise, to release an exciting new mobile game. This upcoming game will offer players a captivating car customization experience, tailored for a broad audience on mobile platforms.\n\nHutch and Turn 10 Studios began discussing a joint project in 2020, taking advantage of Forza's world-leading gameplay and Hutch's experience in mobile live ops. Currently, Hutch is actively developing the game, aiming to create a platform-leading automotive gaming experience.\n\nHutch has set out to build a fresh and unique game tailored to a mobile audience, offering engaging gameplay that players can enjoy on the go. The new game will be revealed in due course and will focus on car customization as a core gameplay mechanic. With over a decade of mobile experience, Hutch is leading the development of the title, with creative input and guidance from Turn 10.\n\nOf the collaboration, Hutch’s CEO and Co-founder Shaun Rutland said: “Our philosophy for game development is mobile first, with gameplay experiences that work for players on this platform. We’re committed to creating strategic games that enable our community of players to celebrate their passion for cars. It’s that same passion for cars, as well as creating platform leading titles about cars, that brought us together with Turn 10. Coming together to work on a title made immediate sense and we’re incredibly excited to soon show you the results of our last few years of collaboration.”\n\nFor more information:\n\nAnton Gourman, VP Communications and IR\n\nDirect: +46 73 661 8488, anton.gourman@mtg.com\n\nFollow us: mtg.com / Twitter / LinkedIn\n\nAbout MTG"
