        "text": "Established back in 2001 as Microsoft’s in-house racing game developer, it was Turn 10’s job to build a top-tier, first-party racing sim for the original Xbox. Xbox owners already had the much-adored but more arcade-oriented Project Gotham Racing series, but what was needed was something cut from the Gran Turismo cloth – a deep, nuanced, and realistic racing game packed with cars from around the world.\n\nThe result was the original Forza Motorsport, released in May 2005. Turn 10 came out swinging too, packing features yet to appear in Gran Turismo series (like car damage and user-defined decal application) as well as some high-profile vehicle manufacturers that were still noticeably absent from Sony’s venerable flagship, like Porsche and Ferrari.\n\nTurn 10 creative director Dan Greenawalt explains to us the original goals of the team.\n\n“Creatively, we’re inspired by car culture,” he says. “We’re inspired by game culture. Ten years ago all of us were a lot younger, but we also had dreams of what we wanted to do to make a difference: make a difference in car culture.”\n\nJust wait until you see the nighttime racing in action.\n\nI don’t see how it’s possible that the only thing Forza would be is Forza Motorsport 2 and Forza Horizon. It’s gonna continue to grow, just as games have continued to grow\n\nThis meant embracing ideas like user-generated content which, in turn, has evolved into building a community.\n\n“The Xbox One’s great for that,” says Greenawalt. “But the franchise, it you track its trajectory you can see how we’ve added more and more community features over the years and that’s been kinda the wellspring of inspiration, and it’s because it ties directly to the vision of the game.”\n\nThe vision of the franchise, to turn gamers into car lovers and car lovers into gamers, is something Greenawalt is well-known for reiterating. He races through the mantra, smiling.\n\n“I’m kinda famous for repeating it,” he concedes, grinning, “but that’s what a vision’s for; it’s to be repeated, it’s to be the guiding light. And ultimately if we can look back in another 10 years and say that we’ve created people that are in love with cars, we’ve created auto enthusiasts in the process, I think we’ve done our job.”\n\n“Ten years is a long time, especially in gaming,” adds Turn 10’s studio manager Alan Hartman. “I think, along with the passion for cars [and] the passion for making racing games, my passion is in making a great racing studio. In creating an environment where I like to say the best people in the world can do their best work.\n\n“And that’s hard in the gaming world, having a studio that’s been around this long. The core people in the Forza franchise have been there since the beginning. Dan Greenawalt, Chris Tector our architect, John Wendl our content director, the foundation of that team. They’ve stayed; they’ve been able to do great innovative work year after year on the franchise.\"\n\nForza Motorsport 1\n\n“That’s been kind of the secret to Forza’s success in terms of the market and building a great game for our fans; we’ve had a great environment, we’ve got a great studio, we’ve attracted great talent, we keep raising the bar on ourselves year after year.”\n\nIn the early days of Turn 10 the studio boasted just two-dozen staff.\n\n“Way back in the beginning,” begins Hartman, “with the original Forza on the original Xbox, I think we had 24 people in the original team.” “But I showed up, actually, in the last four months of that title, and I think at that time there were an additional 40 people borrowed.”\n\n“We had them in corners,” chuckles Greenawalt.\n\nA not-so-quiet village.\n\n“They were strung down the hallway, spread out all over the building,” continues Hartman. “Because it was a massive game; the first Forza Motorsport was trying to do so much. Be a great racing simulator, be epic in its scope, bring online innovation.”\n\nFollowing the success of Forza Motorsport, Turn 10 immediately began work on a sequel intended to debut on the Xbox 360. Forza Motorsport 2 was released in May 2007, upping the user-generated content ante with the series’ now famous livery editor as well as the online Auction House, where players could sell the cars for in-game cash. Forza Motorsport 3 followed just over two years later in October 2009, further honing the community-centric elements of Forza that Turn 10 previously established.\n\nForza Motorsport 4 came around in October 2011 and, over the course of the following 12 months of post-release support, it expanded into a true monster with almost 700 cars from over 90 manufactures. From the frog-eyed Austin-Healey Sprite to the mental Lamborghini Sesto Elemento, the iconic Aston Martin DB5 Vantage to the slightly-hilarious GMC Vandura, and the wasteland-ready Ford XB Falcon to the legendary Porsche 959, Forza 4 ended up stuffed with a staggering amount of cult autos players simply couldn’t find elsewhere.\n\nForza Motorsport 5, which launched with the Xbox One last November, is the most recent Forza game to hit store shelves. Unsurprising it’s been Turn 10’s biggest undertaking to date.\n\nForza Motorsport 2\n\n“When we look at Forza 5,” begins Hartman. “What it takes to do that? Hundreds of people spread across the globe. We were leveraging the world-class engineering [at Playground]; we had about a dozen or more engineers helping out getting the Forza 5 engine ready for launch.\n\n“We have literally hundreds of people working on cars, working on environments, working on tracks, rebuilding everything for the next-gen engine.\n\n“We were talking earlier about what it takes to build a car now compared with the original Xbox. We’re spending well over the sticker price of these cars to build them in the game, with all the detail it takes to hit the next-gen bar.“"
