        "text": "Last month, ILTUWS reported that SUGARFISH would be opening its sixth New York City location at 207 West 75th Street (between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue). Now, the California-based sushi spot is opening its doors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new location will welcome West Siders starting on Thursday, August 8 at 11:30 p.m. Hours of operation are Sunday-Thursday from 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Friday-Saturday from 11:30 a.m. – 11:30 p.m.\n\n“SUGARFISH embodies the philosophy of celebrated sushi chef Kazunori Nozawa and his son, co-founder Tom Nozawa,” reads a press release sent to ILTUWS. “The Nozawa approach to sushi is well-known for the meticulous quality standards established at Sushi Nozawa, which operated in Studio City, California from 1987-2012. With 50 plus years of experience and early training with master chefs in Tokyo and throughout Japan, the Nozawa’s philosophy has redefined the sushi experience.”\n\nSUGARFISH, known best for its affordable price points and long lines, was met with excitement by most when we announced its UWS expansion.\n\n“‘Reviews are mixed’ is wild,” one person wrote in response to our caption, in which we pointed out that reviews are mixed. “No one has better fish. Period.”\n\nWhile many swear by SUGARFISH, some of the not-so-positive reviews are filled with complaints about the long waiting times for “repetitive” sushi offerings. Pete Wells went so far as to use the word “monotony” in his 2017 review for the New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“There’s definitely better sushi available in New York City but for some thing that serves pretty consistently fresh sushi it’s a pretty nice consistent staple,” wrote one thoughtful commenter. “The upper west side need something like this because there’s either really low end cheap sushi spots or extremely expensive super high-end. This is the nice in between.”\n\nALSO READ: Pizza, Soft-Serve and Maybe Cocktails: Growing Eatery Secures Space on Broadway\n\nThe new spot will come with 40 seats and was inspired by “SUGARFISH’S Southern California heritage and the historic\n\nmasonry structure of the existing building.” The space was designed by architect Robert Tsurimoto Kirsten of A-RTK.\n\nIn addition to the “Trust Me®” menus (described in our original article), the UWS location will be offering “limited availability standouts like the Toro Tasting which offers three different takes on Toro (Otoro, Chutoro and Gunkan style) as well as Ankimo Sashimi, Pink Lobster, Salmon Kombu, Sea Bream with Shiso, Sweet Shrimp, Albacore Belly, Santa Barbara Uni and more.”\n\nAdditional NYC locations can be found in Flatiron, Midtown West, Midtown East, SoHo and Williamsburg.\n\nSharing is caring!"
