No way to play it now.\n\nIn my opinion any Activision x Disney collaboration is available for a remake, remaster, or backwards compatible release. Stuff like Simpsons hit and run. Sure Activision doesn’t technically own the rights to Disney Fox Marvel but I assume Disney would approve most backwards compatibility titles these days. The one exemption being Activisions Spider-Man games. Disney will attempt to get along with Sony about those games. Not because any contractual agreement but more as a curtesy to Sony.\n\nI’ve only played the first few hours, but I was actually kinda blown away by how much I was enjoying it. Got it for like $3 at GameStop forever ago.\n\nI would definitely wait for it to come to Game Pass though. It’s usually way too high of a price on sale.\n\nNeversoft made the original and of course they got absorbed into infinity ward in 2014 to make call of duty. For fucks sake.\n\nBut apparently Beenox helped too in some capacity seeing development credits on Google.\n\nI don’t know fam, just find a fucking way to get it back, we still making excuses about Xbox not having the studios?\n\nI get it, but it’s a market where only one IP forms the entire identity and appeal of westerns to the point where even western IP older than RDR like Desperados 3 were dubbed by journalists “RDR2 but top down” or some bullshit like that. Comparisons will happen regardless. There are several IP that already have that challenge under MS. A new Banjo will inevitably be compared to a modern Mario. A new Hexen will be compared to modern Doom. You can’t just not take risks just because of that. RDR2’s strength is in its characters and writing and the open world feeling very alive. The latter is something Rockstar does very well, but everything else they aren’t impenetrable in.\n\nAnd of course it isn’t easy. But if easy is all that mattered, then just having them all continue supporting call of duty is the way to go.\n\nBut it isn’t.\n\nHere is a list and I know you already covered a few of them, I just am reposting this from a list I saved in the past.\n\nAdera\n\nAegis Wing\n\nAge of Empires\n\nAge of Empires Online\n\nAge of Mythology\n\nAscend: Hand of Kul\n\nAvowed\n\nAzurik\n\nBanjo-Kazooie\n\nBards tale\n\nBattleTech\n\nBattletoads\n\nBlack & White\n\nBlast Corps\n\nBlinx\n\nBloodforge\n\nBlood Wake\n\nBlue Dragon\n\nBrute Force\n\nBullet Asylum\n\nBrutal Legend\n\nCombat Flight Simulator WWII Europe\n\nComic Jumper: The Adventures of Captain\n\nSmiley\n\nConker\n\nCrackdown\n\nCrimson Alliance\n\nCrimson Dragon\n\nCrimson Skies\n\nDishonored\n\nDoom\n\nDeathloop\n\nElder Scrolls\n\nEden Falls\n\nEndless Skater\n\nEvery Party\n\nEvil within\n\nFable\n\nFallout\n\nForza Motorsport\n\nFreelancer\n\nFusion Genesis\n\nFuzion Frenzy\n\nGalactic Reign\n\nGame Chest Series\n\nGears of War\n\nGlacier Blast\n\nGrabbed by the Ghoulies\n\nGunpowder\n\nGhost wire Tokyo\n\nGrounded\n\nGrim Fandago\n\nHalo\n\nHellblade\n\nHaunt\n\nHexic\n\nHigh Heat Baseball\n\nHydro Thunder\n\nIlomilo\n\nInfinite Undiscovery\n\nIron Brigade\n\nIt’s Mr. Pants\n\nJawbreaker\n\nJetpac\n\nJet Force Gemini\n\nKakuto Chojin\n\nKameo: Elements of Power\n\nKiller Instinct\n\nKinectimals\n\nKinect Adventures\n\nKinect Fun Labs\n\nKinect Joy Ride\n\nKinect Sports\n\nKodu\n\nKung Fu Chaos\n\nLips\n\nLocoCycle\n\nLost Odyssey\n\nMagatama\n\nMarlow Briggs\n\nMinecraft\n\nMax & the Magic Marker\n\nMax: The Curse of Brotherhood\n\nMaximum Chase\n\nMechAssault\n\nMechCommander\n\nMechWarrior\n\nMicrosoft Flight\n\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator\n\nMicrosoft Train Simulator\n\nMicrosoft Space Simulator\n\nMidtown Madness\n\nMonster Truck Madness\n\nMonsters Love Candy\n\nMotocross Madness\n\nMs. Splosion Man\n\nNightCaster\n\nNinety-Nine Nights\n\nN.U.D.E.@ Natural Ultimate Digital Experiment\n\nOri and the Blind Forest\n\nOtogi\n\nOuter worlds\n\nPerfect Dark\n\nPrey\n\nPhantom Dust\n\nPsychonauts\n\nPowerstar Golf\n\nProject Gotham Racing\n\nProject Milo\n\nPillars of Eternity\n\nProject Spark\n\nProject Totem\n\nQuantum Break\n\nQuantum Redshift\n\nQuake\n\nRallisport Challenge\n\nRage\n\nR.C.

Yes they do lol, they literally have enough developers and teams to tackle almost any type or genre of western games now, even fighting. They just need to facilitate a structure where that can happen organically like it already does under some other publishers (Capcom, Blizzard, Riot)"
