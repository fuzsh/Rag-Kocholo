        "text": "Award-winning creative production company We Are Royale (WAR) created a massive library of in-game graphics and artwork for Forza Motorsport, the highly anticipated and latest instalment in the Forza racing sim series from developer Turn 10 Studios. Forza Motorsport signifies the franchise's debut on next-gen Xbox consoles, along with a plethora of new features, such as a career mode called Builders Cup with RPG elements for car construction and upgrades, enhanced graphics via ray tracing for heightened realism, and a customizable AI system to enhance the overall gaming immersion.\n\nTurn 10 enlisted We Are Royale to enhance the immersive depth and gameplay within the brand-new world of Forza, with a host of game assets spanning menu and navigation systems, posters, animations, and 3D assets of hundreds of automobile parts that players can use to customise their Forza racers.\n\n“We produce a wide range of creative content for the gaming space, including trailers, cinematics, or full-scale marketing campaigns, but we also develop games from the ground up for our non-gaming clients,\" remarked Loren Judah, executive creative director at We Are Royale. \"So, we felt right at home as a development partner on the Forza Motorsport experience, leveraging our design roots as a studio, along with our experience in creating graphics and show packages for traditional entertainment clients.\"\n\nWAR designed a suite of brand-sponsored division logos, along with hundreds of posters for various races, including divisional and championship events. The posters feature in-game captures of some 500 cars offered within Forza Motorsport at launch, each with its own visually-themed aesthetic.\n\nIn keeping each aspect of the gameplay engaging and on-brand, WAR also created stylized racetrack previews for when the game loads, revamped landing pages, and a host of playful, character-driven on-track fictional advertisements. Other menu items include Builders Cup profile and trophy icons, difficulty level iconography, regional track art, branded race event posters, and more.\n\n\"It was important early on to establish a uniform style across the thousands of assets we delivered for both the menu and gameplay elements, all in the service of Turn 10's mission to deliver the best racing experience that Forza fans have ever played,” concluded Loren.\n\nNew cars, tracks, career tours, and online events will be added to the game as live-service elements in the months and years after release, providing ongoing opportunities to showcase content handcrafted by We Are Royale's expert design team."
