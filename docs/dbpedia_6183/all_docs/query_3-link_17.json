        "text": "Since Phil Spencer took over Xbox, Microsoft’s gaming business has expanded significantly, largely thanks to the multi-billion acquisitons of ZeniMax Media and Activision Blizzard (as well as a number of smaller M&A deals).\n\nThe company now owns roughly 40 subsidiaries, including game development studios, publishers, and support teams. All of them are part of the larger Microsoft Gaming organization, which is led by Spencer as CEO.\n\nBelow are Microsoft’s main first-party studios broken down into three divisions: Xbox Game Studios, ZeniMax Media, and Activision Blizzard. But keep in mind that the company is likely to make some changes to its structure after completing its latest $68.7 billion deal, which could lead to some internal mergers and even layoffs or the divestment of certain smaller assets.\n\nXbox Game Studios\n\nTurn 10 Studios (established by Microsoft)\n\nFounded: 2002\n\nIP: Forza Motorsport\n\nGames released: 9\n\nFounded in 2001, Turn 10 is still led by its co-founder Dan Greenawalt, who also serves as general manager of the Forza Motorsport franchise. He oversaw the production of all titles in the series, including the Forza Horizon IP (developed by Playground Games).\n\nForza Motorsport (2023)\n\n343 Industries (established by Microsoft)\n\nFounded: 2007\n\nIP: Halo\n\nGames released: 11\n\nBonnie Ross started 343 Industries in 2007, shortly after Bungie announced its split from Microsoft, to manage the further development of the Halo franchise. Since then, the studio has helped ship 11 games, including Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Halo Infinite.\n\nThe latter became a live service title, and 343 is now putting all its efforts into content support of the game by releasing new seasons, game modes, and (recently) the Forge AI Toolkit. However, a number of key developers have left the team since October 2020, including Bonnie Ross, art director Nicolas Bouvier, and technical director David Berger.\n\nHalo Infinite\n\nThe Coalition (established by Microsoft)\n\nFounded: 2010\n\nIP: Gears of War\n\nGames released: 5\n\nOriginally known as Zipline Studios, it was rebranded Microsoft Game Studios Vancouver shortly after being founded in 2010. The team was assigned to the eventually canceled AAA shooter for Kinect, but was later renamed Black Tusk Studios to create a new Xbox franchise for the corporation.\n\nIn 2014, Microsoft acquired the Gears of War IP from Epic Games and put Black Tusk (this time renamed to The Coalition) in charge of the series. Since then, the studio has released Gears of War 4 and Gears 5, as well as contributed to Gears Tactics and The Matrix Awakens demo.\n\nGears 5\n\nThe Initiative (established by Microsoft)\n\nFounded: 2018\n\nIP: Perfect Dark\n\nGames released: 0\n\nPhil Spencer announced the formation of The Initiative in 2018, with the studio being led by industry veteran and former Crystal Dynamics head Darrell Gallagher. It is now working on the reboot of Perfect Dark, which was announced at The Game Awards 2020.\n\nHowever, the game unfortunately got stuck in a sort of development hell. During 2021, dozens of developers left The Initiative, including core writers, designers, and game director Dan Neuburger (was in charge of several Tomb Raider games).\n\nThe studio even partnered with Crystal Dynamisc to finish Perfect Dark, but its current state is still unclear. In August 2023, IGN reported that the game is still “roughly two to three years away from being ready for release.”\n\nPerfect Dark\n\nWorld’s Edge (established by Microsoft)\n\nFounded: 2019\n\nIP: Age of Empires, Age of Mythology\n\nGames released: 6\n\nThe studio was started in 2019 by creative director Adam Isgreen (best known for his work on the Command & Conquer series) and Shannon Loftis (retired in February 2022). World’s Edge mainly focuses on the Age of Empires IP, having already developed AoE IV (not to mention the remasters of the two previous main installments in the series).\n\nRight now, the team is also helping TiMi Studio Group, a subsidiary of Tencent and developer of Call of Duty: Mobile, with Age of Empires Mobile. It is yet to be launched globally, but its Chinese version, Return to Empire, broke into the top 10 highest-grossing iOS games in the country upon its release in March 2021.\n\nAge of Empires IV\n\nRare (acquired)\n\nJoined Microsoft: 2002\n\nIP: Sea of Thieves, Killer Instinct, Battletoads\n\nGames released under Microsoft: around 20\n\nSince its inception in 1985, Rare has developed dozens of titles, including classics such as Battletoads, Killer Instinct, Golden Eye 007, and Perfect Dark. Although Microsoft acquired the studio in 2002, it continued to make games for Nintendo and other publishers for several years.\n\nAs part of Xbox Game Studios, Rare is best known for Kameo: Elements of Power, Conker: Live & Reloaded, Perfect Dark Zero, Viva Piñata, and, of course, its live service hit Sea of Thieves. It is likely the most diverse studio in Microsoft’s portfolio in terms of genres.\n\nSea of Thieves\n\nMojang Studios (acquired)\n\nJoined Microsoft: 2014\n\nIP: Minecraft\n\nGames released under Microsoft: 4\n\nIn 2014, Minecraft creator Markus Persson left Mojang and sold the studio to Microsoft for $2.5 billion. The team is still supporting the game, which remains the best-selling title of all time with over 300 million units sold globally.\n\nSince the acquisition, Mojang has developed card game Caller’s Bane and strategy Crown and Council, as well as Minecraft spin-offs, Dungeons and Legends.\n\nMinecraft\n\nNinja Theory (acquired)\n\nJoined Microsoft: 2018\n\nIP: Hellblade\n\nGames released under Microsoft: 1\n\nFounded in 2000, Ninja Theory partnered with Microsoft for its debut game Kung Fu Chaos. After that, the studio made a PS3 exclusive Heavenly Sword, also making the name for itself with titles like Enslaved: Odyssey to the West and DmC: Devil May Cry.\n\nIn 2017, Ninja Theory released Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice, which received critical acclaim and sold over 1 million units. Microsoft acquired the team for $117 million in June 2018.\n\nIts only project under Xbox Game Studio was the multiplayer game Bleeding Edge, which was shut down less than a year after launch due to mixed reception. Ninja Theory’s next title, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II, is expected to come out in 2024.\n\nSenua’s Saga: Hellblade II\n\nPlayground Games (acquired)\n\nJoined Microsoft: 2018\n\nIP: Forza Horizon, Fable\n\nGames released under Microsoft: 5\n\nFounded in 2010 by former Codemasters employees Gavin Raeburn, Trevor Williams, and Ralph Fulton, Playground Games has been closely working with Microsoft even before the acquisition in June 2018. Although the racing genre and the Forza Horizon series remain its main focus, the studio is now working on the reboot of another popular Xbox IP, Fable.\n\nForza Horizon 5\n\nCompulsion Games (acquired)\n\nJoined Microsoft: 2018\n\nIP: We Happy Few, South of Midnight\n\nGames released under Microsoft: 0\n\nCompulsion Games was founded in 2009 by former Arkane Studios producer Guillaume Provost. It developed two titles, platformer Contrast and action game We Happy Few, before being acquired by Microsoft in June 2018. Earlier this year, Xbox announced the studio’s next project, South of Midnight.\n\nSouth of Midnight\n\nUndead Labs (acquired)\n\nJoined Microsoft: 2018\n\nIP: State of Decay\n\nGames released under Microsoft: 0\n\nArenaNet co-founder Jeff Strain started Undead Labs after leaving NCSoft in 2009. Best known for the State of Decay series, the studio was acquired by Microsoft in June 2018. Strain has since left the company and founded Possibility Space in 2021.\n\nThe current status of Undead Labs’ next game, State of Decay 3, is still unclear. As of April 2022, it was reportedly trapped in pre-production, as some employees accused the studio of mismanagement, toxic behavior, and sexism.\n\nState of Decay 3\n\nObsidian Entertainment (acquired)\n\nJoined Microsoft: 2018\n\nIP: Pillars of Eternity, The Outer Worlds, Grounded\n\nGames released under Microsoft: 3\n\nFounded in 2003 by five former Black Isle developers, including Feargus Urquhart and Chris Avellone, Obsidian made a name for itself with RPGs like Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, Neverwinter Nights 2, Fallout: New Vegas, and Pillars of Eternity.\n\nMicrosoft acquired the studio in November 2018. Since then, Obsidian has released The Outer Worlds, the survival game Grounded, and the smaller role-playing adventure Pentiment. It is now working on its next big RPG, Avowed, and the sequel to The Outer Worlds.\n\nAvowed\n\ninXile Entertainment (acquired)\n\nJoined Microsoft: 2018\n\nIP: Wasteland, The Bard’s Tale\n\nGames released under Microsoft: 3\n\nIndustry veteran Brian Fargo started inXile Entertainment in 2002, shortly after leaving Interplay, a company he co-founded in 1983. Having worked on many classic RPGs, the new team decided to keep making games in the genre, with The Bard’s Tale as its debut project.\n\nAfter that, inXile released titles like Wasteland 2 and Torment: Tides of Numenera before being snapped up by Microsoft in November 2018. Since the acquisition, the studio has released Wasteland Remastered, Wasteland 3, and VR shooter Frostpoint, and is now working on its new IP, steampunk RPG Clockwork Revolution.\n\nClockwork Revolution\n\nDouble Fine Productions (acquired)\n\nJoined Microsoft: 2019\n\nIP: Psychonauts\n\nGames released under Microsoft: 1\n\nThe studio was founded in 2000 by industry veteran Tim Schafer, who remains its CEO and president to this date. Its portfolio includes Psychonauts, Costume Quest, Brutal Legend, and Broken Age, as well as remasters of classic adventures like Full Throttle and Grim Fandango.\n\nIn 2019, Microsoft acquired Double Fine Productions for an undisclosed sum, helping the team ship Psychonauts 2.\n\nPsychonauts 2\n\nZeniMax Media\n\nIn 2020, Microsoft acquired ZeniMax for $7.5 billion, along with all its subsidiaries.\n\nBethesda Softworks (publishing arm) / Bethesda Game Studios (game development)\n\nJoined ZeniMax: 1999\n\nIP: The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Starfield\n\nGames released under Microsoft: 1\n\nBethesda has been making video games since 1986, serving as both developer and publisher of its projects. In 1999, it was acquired by ZeniMax Media, with the deal also resulting in a long-lasting lawsuit with founder Christopher Weaver, who accused his new business partners of outsing him from the company.\n\nIn 2001, it split into two divisions, Bethesda Softworks (publishes all titles within the ZeniMax family and sometimes third-party projects) and Bethesda Game Studios (developer of The Elder Scrolls and Fallout series). Since the deal with Microsoft, the studio has released one game so far — Starfield, which attracted over 10 million players and became one of the best-selling games of 2023.\n\nStarfield\n\nZeniMax Online Studios\n\nEstablished by ZeniMax: 2007\n\nIP: The Elder Scrolls Online\n\nGames released under Microsoft: 0\n\nZeniMax established an online division with the help of Dark Age of Camelot producer Matt Firor specifically to create MMO titles based on its franchises. In 2014, the studio released The Elder Scrolls Online and is now working on an unannounced project based on a new IP.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls Online\n\nid Software\n\nJoined ZeniMax: 2009\n\nIP: Doom, Quake\n\nGames released under Microsoft: 0\n\nThe pioneer of the first-person shooter genre, id Software is still one of the most recognized game developers worldwide. Having released dozens of titles, the studio is best known for its Doom and Quake franchises.\n\nAfter being acquired by ZeniMax in 2009, id Software launched Doom (2016), Rage 1-2, and Doom Eternal.\n\nDoom Eternal\n\nArkane Studios\n\nJoined ZeniMax: 2010\n\nIP: Dishonored, Prey, Deathloop\n\nGames released under Microsoft: 1\n\nFounded in 2000 by Raphael Colantonio (currently runs his new studio, WolfEye), Arkane made a name for itself with complex immersive games, Arx Fatalis and Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. It currently has two main offices in Lyon and Austin.\n\nIn 2010, Bethesda approached the team with an idea for a first-person stealth game named Dishonored and eventually acquired the studio in August of that year. Arkane went on to develop the game in its own fashion, followed by a sequel, Prey, and Deathloop.\n\nThe latter came out after Microsoft’s acquisition of ZeniMax, but remained a timed exclusive to the PlayStation platform under the existing deal. Earlier this year, Arkane released Redfall, a co-cop shooter that received negative reviews, not to mention its production suffered from poor management and talent attrition.\n\nRedfall\n\nMachineGames\n\nJoined ZeniMax: 2010\n\nIP: Wolfenstein\n\nGames released under Microsoft: 0\n\nFounded in 2009 by Kjell Emanuelsson, Jim Kjellin, and five other former Starbreeze employees, MachineGames first started working with Bethesda in 2010 to develop a new game in the Wolfenstein series.

Under new management, the studio developed the survival horror game The Evil Within and its sequel.\n\nFollowing Microsoft’s acquisition of ZeniMax, Tango Gameworks released Ghostwire: Tokyo, which was a timed exclusive to the PlayStation platform. Its latest title, the rhythm-based action game Hi-Fi Rush, came out as a surprise Xbox project earlier this year.\n\nHi-Fi Rush\n\nAlpha Dog Games\n\nJoined ZeniMax: 2019\n\nKnown for mobile action RPG Wraithborne, Alpha Dog was acquired by ZeniMax in 2019 and currently serves as one of Microsoft’s in-house mobile development teams.

New games from the studio are yet to be announced.\n\nPrey (2006)\n\nActivision Blizzard King\n\nOn October 13, 2023, Microsoft closed its $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard following a nearly two-year fight with antitrust regulators.\n\nActivision Publishing\n\nFounded: 1979\n\nIP: Call of Duty, Guitar Hero, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater etc.\n\nThe modern history of Activision started in 1991, when Bobby Kotick took over the financially unstable company for $500k and ultimately turned it into the gaming giant it is today. It has released hundreds of games over the past 30+ years, including Quake, Heretic, Guitar Hero, and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater.\n\nActivision is currently responsible for managing all of its in-house studios and publishing their games, mainly the Call of Duty series.\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare III\n\nRaven Software\n\nJoined Activision: 1997\n\nIP: Heretic, Singularity, Soldier of Fortune\n\nBrian and Steve Raffel founded Raven in 1990.

As part of Activision, which acquired it for $12 million in 1997, Raven developed Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, Soldier of Fortune, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, and Singularity.\n\nSince 2010, the studio has been a support team on the Call of Duty series, helping other in-house developers.
