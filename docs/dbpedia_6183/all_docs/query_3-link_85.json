It’s good practice to make sure you have more space on the drive than is needed.\n\nUpdating to the latest graphics card drivers will help with compatibility and performance of the game.\n\nMINIMUM:\n\nRequires a 64-bit processor and operating system\n\nOS: Windows 10 64-bit\n\nProcessor: Intel i5-4690 / AMD FX 8350\n\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\n\nGraphics: Nvidia GTX 970 / AMD RX 480 (4GB+ of VRAM)\n\nDirectX: Version 11\n\nStorage: 150 GB available space on an SSD\n\nAdditional Notes: Default API is Directx11. Vulkan 1.1 API also provided.\n\nRECOMMENDED:\n\nRequires a 64-bit processor and operating system\n\nOS: Windows 10 64-bit\n\nProcessor: Intel i7 8700K / AMD r5 3600\n\nMemory: 16 GB RAM\n\nGraphics: Nvidia 2060 Super / AMD RX 5700 XT (8GB+ of VRAM)\n\nDirectX: Version 11\n\nStorage: 150 GB available space on an SSD\n\nAdditional Notes: Default API is Directx11. Vulkan 1.1 API also provided.\n\nmac OS Requirements\n\nMINIMUM:\n\nRequires a 64-bit processor and operating system\n\nOS: macOS 12 or newer\n\nProcessor: Apple M1\n\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\n\nGraphics: Apple M1\n\nStorage: 150 GB available space\n\nAdditional Notes: Minimum specs can run the game on low to medium settings. Splitscreen will not run at an acceptable level of performance. SSD required.\n\nNote: minimum means you'll be able to play but you'll have to make quality concessions. If your framerate is low, go to video options and try a lower graphics preset.\n\nAdditional notes on the minimum requirements:\n\n- The game requires a CPU with AVX2 support (basically, 2014 or later).\n\n- Nvidia graphics are not supported.\n\n- The minimum AMD graphics card requires 4GB of VRAM; cards with 2GB would require swapping assets in and out of memory, likely causing performance problems, and are not recommended.\n\n- Since integrated graphics share system memory, having more than 8GB would help when using M1 systems.\n\nRECOMMENDED:"
