        "text": "By Sean Carey, 15 Jun 2023\n\nFollowtopics\n\nSean Carey\n\nForza Motorsport developer Turn 10 Studios is working in collaboration with Hutch to create a new mobile game that focuses on car customization.\n\nTurn 10 Studios and mobile game developer Hutch have announced that they're working together to create a new mobile game that celebrates car customization and automotive culture. Hutch, which has developed numerous mobile racing games in the past, will lead the project, while Xbox Game Studios' Turn 10 will offer creative input and guidance.\n\nTurn 10 working with Hutch to develop a car customization mobile game\n\nNot much has been said about the new game, and we don't yet have a release date, but a press release says, \"Hutch has set out to build a fresh and unique game tailored to a mobile audience, offering engaging gameplay that players can enjoy on the go. The new game, due to be fully revealed in due course, will focus on car customization as a core gameplay mechanic.\"\n\nShaun Rutland, CEO and co-founder of Hutch, said: \"Our philosophy for game development is mobile first, with gameplay experiences that work for players on this platform. We’re committed to creating strategic games that enable our community of players to celebrate their passion for cars.\n\n\"It’s that same passion for cars, as well as creating platform-leading titles about cars, that brought us together with Turn 10. Coming together to work on a title made immediate sense, and we’re incredibly excited to show you the results of our last few years of collaboration.\"\n\nTurn 10's next project is, of course, Forza Motorsport, which launches on October 10. If you missed it, the developer recently revealed Forza Motorsport's single-player career gameplay.\n\nWritten by Sean Carey\n\nAvid Xbox and achievement fan, Sean has committed to playing the best RPGs, racing games, and first-person shooters Xbox Game Pass and his precious free time will allow.
