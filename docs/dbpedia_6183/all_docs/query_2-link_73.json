Aptly named Forza 5, the latest from Turn 10 will once again bring us glossy and fast cars racing along streets, fog, and even castles. The McLaren P1, one of our favorite concept cars, was featured heavily in the trailer in several shots of extreme racing sex.\n\nThe game will be available at the console’s launch later this year, with more details coming at E3 next month."
