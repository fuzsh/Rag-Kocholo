        "text": "There's a lot of news coming out of Gamescom today (Fable Legends!), but I thought I'd focus on one item of particular importance, Microsoft's official list of tentative launch day titles for the Xbox One.\n\nIt's a mix of Microsoft's own creations, 3rd party titles available across other consoles, and of course, more than a few Kinect-infused games. As of now, there is still no announced bundle where the One is able to be purchased without the Kinect, even if it's no longer required for the system to operate.\n\nWill this list be enough to drive sales at release? Here's the official line-up of games that should be available for the Xbox One at launch:\n\nAssassin's Creed IV Black Flag (Ubisoft, Ubisoft)\n\nWatch Dogs (Ubisoft Montreal, Ubisoft)\n\nUbisoft has reported that preorders for next-gen consoles, the PS4 and Xbox One, are outpacing preorders for the current generation systems. Both of these are going to be big titles for both Ubisoft and the console manufacturers themselves, as they'll likely prove to be some of the better day one titles available for the systems, based on the list we see here. I predict five or more years from now we'll look back at the (currently amazing) graphics and scoff at how much things have evolved since then.\n\nBattlefield 4 (DICE, Electronic Arts)\n\nCall of Duty: Ghosts (Infinity Ward, Activision)\n\nOnce again, these two franchises are going head to head, and it's no surprise both will be launch titles for the Xbox One and PS4. Battlefield remains a solid franchise for EA, but no one believes it's going to come anywhere close to touching COD in this latest matchup. Not to say it's a bad title (though we've seen barely anything from it and it's recently announced \"Premium Service\" sounds atrocious), but COD continues to be the shooter of choice for most fans of the genre, and Ghosts has looked very, very promising so far. Expect Ghosts to easily be the top selling next-gen title across both platforms.\n\nCrimson Dragon (Grounding/Land Ho!, Microsoft Studios)\n\nThis was the dragon-riding game announced at E3 that had a trailer where the sound accidentally didn't play. Not the best thing to be known for, and I think Microsoft should be pushing more to get the word out about this game as I think it's flying pretty low under the radar at present, no pun intended.\n\nFIFA 14 (EA Sports, Electronic Arts)\n\nMadden NFL 25 (EA Sports, Electronic Arts)\n\nNBA 2K14 (Visual Concepts, 2K Sports)\n\nNBA LIVE 14 (EA Sports, Electronic Arts)\n\nProbably a safe bet to group all these sports titles together as they'll sell well, as they always do, and people will complain that there aren't enough changes/are too many changes. But as always, expect big sales for EA (and 2K) here.\n\nForza Motorsport 5 (Turn 10 Studios, Microsoft Studios)\n\nWhat would a next generation console be without a racing game where everyone can ooo and ahh over \"photorealistic\" cars? Forza faces more casual competition from Need for Speed (below), but for the racing enthusiast, it's a must have in order to look at the individual rubber threads on your tire or grains of carbon fiber in your hood.\n\nNeed for Speed: Rivals (Ghost Games, Electronic Arts)\n\nI'm just excited for another Need for Speed game, as I always am. I do miss Underground, and wish they were bringing that back, but Rivals looks promising as well.\n\nFighter Within (AMA Ltd., Ubisoft)\n\nThis is an interesting Kinect-based fighting game that will assuredly have you breaking various objects in your living room. Check out the Gamescom trailer for it here.\n\nDead Rising 3 (Capcom Vancouver, Microsoft)\n\nOne of Microsoft's best exclusives for launch day, considering franchises like Fable and Halo aren't coming to the system until later. Dead Rising has personally never been my favorite zombie series, but the new power of the Xbox One is going to be able to render mass zombies on a scale that dwarfs previous titles, and it should be something to behold.\n\nJust Dance 2014 (Ubisoft Paris, Ubisoft)\n\nZumba Fitness: World Party (ZoÃ« Mode, Majesco)\n\nYou're looking at the two best selling Kinect 2.0 titles without question. While Kinect hasn't caught on for mainstream games, it has made a mark with its fitness and dance titles, and it's no coincidence that two are being delivered at launch. Just Dance in particular will likely be a very big title for Microsoft.\n\nKiller Instinct (Double Helix, Microsoft Studios)\n\nThis will be an interesting experiment for a fighting game, to have nearly all the character purchasable through microtransactions. It's a nostalgia flashback to have Killer Instinct live again, but hopefully it's a game that delivers more than just fond memories.\n\nLEGO Marvel Super Heroes (TT Games, Warner Bros. Interactive)\n\nIt's LEGO, it's superheroes, that's really all you need for another quality offering from the series.\n\nLococycle (Twisted Pixel, Microsoft Studios)\n\nPowerstar Golf (Zoe Mode, Microsoft Studios)\n\nA wacky racing title and a golf game exclusive to Microsoft, respectively. They look fun in demos and trailers, but will likely get overshadowed by many other titles on this list. Will not be Microsoft's Mario Kart or Wii Golf.\n\nPeggle 2 (Popcap, Electronic Arts)\n\nShould be fun to play with Kinect capability, but I'm more excited about Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare from Popcap.\n\nRyse: Son of Rome (Crytek, Microsoft Studios)\n\nRyse has refined itself a bit since E3, and no longer has almost exclusively quick time event-based combat like we saw previously. Gone are the giant flashing button prompts, and combat is now promised to be more like a \"dance\" between combatants than a series of sequenced button presses. But the other issue with the game was that it felt really, really on the rails, at least in the footage seen so far. Still, this could end up surprising and turn into a memorable series for Microsoft, which they could really use.\n\nSkylanders: Swap Force (Vicarious Visions, Activision)\n\nThere's nothing bigger than Skylanders right now, and it's a smart move to have Swap Force available on launch day. Expect this title to be automatically gobble up by the younger set when they're picking up their consoles at release.\n\nZoo Tycoon (Frontier Developments Ltd., Microsoft Studios)\n\nA re-release of the 2001 title, this version will hopefully let me Kinect-pet a giraffe, fulfilling a life-long dream.\n\nAll in all, I think Microsoft has a pretty solid line-up here. Granted, most of their best titles are 3rd party games that will be available cross-platform, but they have strong offerings with Forza, Killer Instinct and Dead Rising, and the promise of Fable, Halo and Titanfall to come. Keep in mind that PS4 won't have many of its famed first party titles available on launch day either. To quote Nintendo , we should see them within a \"launch window\" for both consoles, but this is certainly enough to get the Xbox One started.\n\nFollow me on Twitter, subscribe to my Forbes blog, and pick up a copy of my sci-fi novel, The Last Exodus, and its sequel."
