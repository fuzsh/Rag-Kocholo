        "text": "Why did you choose to work for Turn 10?\n\n\"As an internal Microsoft hire who'd worked on the Xbox platform team previously, I knew the kinds of corporate culture, priorities and leadership principles that the studio would be operating under, and that is something I've really come to value about Microsoft as a whole. Plus, shiny cars. Forza Motorsport 4 got me into cars and IRL track days, and Forza Horizon showed me my new favourite genre of car game. Getting to work at Turn 10 - and work with Playground Games - with an amazing team of engineers in the Xbox studios organization and culture, was basically a dream job for me.\n\nAlso, seriously, I often choose to walk through the front door even though the side door is closer to where I park, just because I really do like the shiny cars in the lobby. It's like a Zen moment that sets a good tone for the morning.\""
