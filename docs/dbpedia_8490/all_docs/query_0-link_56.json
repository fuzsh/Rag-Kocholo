An epic (from the Ancient Greek adjective ἐπικός\n\nterm includes some poems of the English Renaissance, particularly those inﬂuenced by Ovid. The most famous example of classical epyllion is perhaps Catullus 64. Some of the most famous examples of epic poetry include the ancient Indian Ramayana and Mahabharata, the Ancient Greek Iliad and the Odyssey, Dante’s Divine Comedy, John Milton’s Paradise Lost, and the Portuguese Lusiads.\n\n1 Oral epics or world folk epics The ﬁrst epics were products of preliterate societies and oral poetic traditions. In these traditions, poetry is transmitted to the audience and from performer to performer by purely oral means. Early twentieth-century study of living oral epic traditions in the Balkans by Milman Parry and Albert Lord demonstrated the paratactic model used for composing these poems. What they demonstrated was that oral epics tend to be constructed in short episodes, each of equal status, interest and importance. This facilitates memorization, as the poet is recalling each episode in turn and using the Tablet containing a fragment of the Epic of Gilgamesh completed episodes to recreate the entire epic as he performs it. Parry and Lord also showed that the most likely (epikos), from ἔπος (epos) “word, story, poem”[1] ) is a source for written texts of the epics of Homer was dictalengthy narrative poem, ordinarily concerning a serious tion from an oral performance. subject containing details of heroic deeds and events signiﬁcant to a culture or nation.[2] Milman Parry and Albert Epic: a long narrative poem in elevated Lord have argued that the Homeric epics, the earliest style presenting characters of high position in works of Western literature, were fundamentally an oral adventures forming an organic whole through poetic form. These works form the basis of the epic genre their relation to a central heroic ﬁgure and in Western literature.

Often features the tragic hero’s descent into the Underworld or hell. The hero generally participates in a cyclical journey or quest, faces adversaries that try to defeat him in his journey and returns home signiﬁcantly transformed by his journey. The epic hero illustrates traits, performs deeds, and exempliﬁes certain morals that are valued by the society the epic originates from. Many epic heroes are recurring characters in the legends of their native culture. Conventions of epics: 1. Praepositio: Opens by stating the theme or cause of the epic. This may take the form of a purpose (as in Milton, who proposed “to justify the ways of God to men”); of a question (as in the Iliad, which Homer initiates by asking a Muse to sing of Achilles’ anger); or of a situation (as in the Song of Roland, with Charlemagne in Spain). 2. Invocation: Writer invokes a Muse, one of the nine daughters of Zeus. The poet prays to the Muses to provide him with divine inspiration to tell the story of a great hero. (This convention is restricted to cultures inﬂuenced by European Classical culture. The Epic of Gilgamesh, for example, or the Bhagavata Purana do not contain this element). 3. In medias res: narrative opens “in the middle of things”, with the hero at his lowest point. Usually ﬂashbacks show earlier portions of the story. 4. Enumeratio: Catalogues and genealogies are given. These long lists of objects, places, and people place the ﬁnite action of the epic within a broader, universal context. Often, the poet is also paying homage to the ancestors of audience members. 5. Epithet: Heavy use of repetition or stock phrases: e.g., Homer's “rosy-ﬁngered dawn” and “wine-dark sea.” Poets in literate societies have sometimes copied the epic format. The earliest surviving European examples are the Argonautica of Apollonius of Rhodes and Virgil’s Aeneid, which follow both the style and subject matter of Homer. Other obvious examples are Nonnus’ Dionysiaca, Tulsidas' Sri Ramacharit Manas.\n\nThe ﬁrst page of the Beowulf manuscript, 8th to 10th century.\n\n2 Notable epic poems This list can be compared with two others, national epic and list of world folk-epics.[4]\n\n2.1 Ancient epics (to 500) • 20th to 10th century BC: • Epic of Gilgamesh (Mesopotamian mythology) • Atrahasis (Mesopotamian mythology) • Enuma Elish (Babylonian mythology) • Legend of Keret (Ugaritic mythology) • Cycle of Kumarbi (Hurrian mythology) • The Poem of Pentaur (Ancient Egyptian account of the battle of Kadesh) (The date of compositions of Babylonian epics is often hard to determine, as they may survive on manuscripts that are much later than the ﬁrst composition.
