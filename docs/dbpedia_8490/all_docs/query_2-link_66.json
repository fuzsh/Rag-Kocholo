Hail to the hood for being the space of encounters and disencounters, far from any communitarian paradise and close to the messy ground of democratic coexistence. Growing up between streets named after a Dutch Amboy and a Zionist Herzl now seems like an objective correlative for the bifocal vision we developed there. The double focus and double talk made everything outside any one of our small apartments look elliptical, pulled between two gravitational points of home and host languages. The ellipses were linked up by a series of puntos suspendidos that kept meanings afloat, somehow there but never settled. It was a time when Larry Harlow, lovingly called in Puerto Rican Spanish El niño judío de Brooklyn, was just starting to feel his piano fingers tingle with Caribbean counterpoints, and when grown-ups in the neighborhood who spoke English without a Spanish or Yiddish or Southern Black or Greek or Chinese accent sounded childlike and too shallow to take very seriously. How could someone be grown up already and still to have only one culture or language? It seemed to us like a case of arrested development. Needless to say, dealing with monolingual teachers wasn’t easy. They commanded respect (ambiguities intended), parents assured their children; and we gave them respect, mostly out of deference to our old-world parents. For some time now, I have appreciated the privilege of spending my formative years in a place where we all fit in, more or less uneasily and with the mutual respect that comes from never presuming to be at the center. Those multilingual lessons about the precariousness of communication and the miracle of contact slowly took the center of my attention, especially after Proceed with Caution, When Engaged by Minority Writing in the Americas (1999). A chapter on “The Traps of Translation” put me on the track of a whole set of language games that play on the differences between insider and outsider. Since then, bilingual games have been the subject of courses I teach, of my own research for Bilingual Aesthetics (forthcoming, Duke University\n\nviii Í\n\nBILINGUAL GAMES\n\nPress), and conferences. In all these projects, I have depended on the creative collaboration of an exceptional core of graduate student colleagues. Our first course was literally designed by the group, which included José Luis Falconí, Bill Johnson Gonzalez, Carmen Oquendo, Carolina Recio, Miguel Segovia, Joaquín Terrones, and Esther Whitfield. My gratitude is immeasurable to each one for particular contributions and to the group for their collective lessons in collaboration. Special thanks are due, nonetheless, to José Luis Falconí, who has managed to coordinate this volume and many related projects with the already legendary tact and efficiency that makes his intelligence a gift to everyone in his expanding circle of contacts. To Joaquín Terrones, I owe an irredeemable debt for the brilliance of his interpretations, the mental agility and generosity he lavishes as teaching fellow for undergraduate students, and for his elegant translations here. And to Miguel Segovia, the bibliographer and voracious reader, go the thanks of a follower to her leader. The contributors to this volume merit, obviously, my profound thanks for their brilliant essays. Many of them presented their work during conferences at Harvard University, where we all benefited from the participation of more colleagues than could—unfortunately—be included in one volume. The work, however, of participants, including Evangelina Vigil Piñón, Tino Villanueva, Ilan Stavans, Ramón Saldívar, Robbie Schwartzwald, Giannina Braschi, Arnaldo Cruz-Malavé, Francisco Goldman, Tato Laviera, Juani Guerra, is present to all of us and forms part of the basic bibliography at the end of this book. Thanks are also due to John Coatsworth, and Steve Reifenberg, Director and Executive Director, respectively, of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies for the institutional support of the center for some translations of the essays, to Tomás Ybarra Frausto for his advice and bendición, and to Gayatri Patnaik for bringing our games to what we hope readers will judge to be some winning results. Even more, though, we hope that readers will join the games.\n\nIntroduction Doris Sommer\n\nBilingual games play on the broad field that Ludwig Wittgenstein cleared through his Philosophical Investigations. Language had become a problem for philosophy because the field was cluttered by prejudices about what language can or should do. Why worry, he asked, when it evidently does many things effectively? The only way to solve philosophy’s problems is therefore to take a fresh look and to see the almost endless variety of existing “language games” instead of perpetuating tired assumptions about ideal functions that came to grief all over the world. Wittgenstein’s cure for this self-inflicted anxiety was simply to induce relaxation, because beating a live horse to death, as it were, or asking for peras al olmo was causing a whole syndrome of ailments for scholars. Natural language doesn’t demand perfect fit as long as it is useful; and it doesn’t need philosophy’s blessing even if the discipline presumes greater clarity than everyday speech. On the contrary, Wittgenstein insisted, philosophy could advance a bit if it developed some respect for the subtle mechanisms of everydayness that produce intended effects through so precarious a medium as language. Our essays take the descriptive cure to heart and extend the treatment for anxious times. These new investigations will need to stretch beyond a single language and also past everyday activities, as mass migrations and strained, often double, be-longings push identities and language games to boundaries between codes. And at those frontiers, unconventional speech and writing border on art. Bilingual Games develops in both urgent directions: First, it broadens the work of description toward the busy borders between languages, where linguists have been mapping varieties of conversational code-switching in normal communication. And then it deepens admiration for the art of code-switching by underlining its particular and unconventional aesthetic effects. Learning to enjoy those effects may train an attitude of respect for the displaced and culturally overloaded artists who produce\n\n2\n\nÍ\n\nDORIS SOMMER\n\nthem, often on purpose, even when one language feels more precarious than another. So we invite you to play bilingual games, even if you don’t have much of a second language yet. Among the rules for playing, after all, are the different positions we take on the field, some at home base and others off in left field. It is a difference to reckon with. The days of the one ideal reader have been numbered and spent in our segmented societies. A “target audience” today can mean the target of exclusion or confusion. And feeling the unpleasant effect is one valid way of getting the point, or the kick, of a language game. More basic even than these hide-and-seek games is the very fact that overloaded systems unsettle meaning. When more than one word points to a familiar thing, the excess shows that no one word can “own” or “be” that thing. Several contending words point, each imperfectly. Even a proper noun like “Hamlet” is game for competition.1 Of course he worried enough about precarious arrangements (without code-switching) to be an inviting target. “Whenever you were reduced to look up something in the English version [of Hamlet],” Nabokov’s Pnin complains, “you never found this or that beautiful, noble, sonorous line that you remembered all your life . . . Sad!”2 Words are not proper and don’t stay put; they wander into adjacent language fields, get lost in translation, pick up tics from foreign interference, and so can’t quite mean what they say. Teaching bilinguals about deconstruction is almost redundant. [“Big dill!” Pnin might say.3] Reckoning with positions and their asymmetrical aesthetic effects will be one antidote to multicultural anxiety. “We are all multiculturalists now,” admit fellow citizens, often with a tone of resignation if not resentment. A cure for cringing will need to turn the dread of difference into desire for it. Maybe recognizing the charm of a lateral move from one language to another, to poach a word or turn a phrase, will call admiring attention to everyday artists as well as to literary exemplars. Recognition of this knack for innovation and creative survival will make it unnecessary to require that migrants choose and lose in the game of cultural belonging. Perhaps their staying powering two or more cultures can be a model of tolerant sanity for single-minded nativists, just as normal unsystematic speakers were Wittgenstein’s guides for getting on with philosophy.\n\nPush and Pull The stretch in breadth will make good on Wittgenstein’s advice to look and listen to the ways that language normally works. But the\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nÍ 3\n\npull toward literariness takes some liberties with his preference for common speech. Wittgenstein’s provocation was to value everyday flexibility over the cramped habits of “philosophese.” Ours will be to honor the creativity of a common condition that continues to be pathologized and disdained. Today philosophers are not the only ones who worry about language. Reflecting on what it can mean is complicated by questions about which language(s) to use legitimately for commerce, politics, intimacy, and education. Mass movements of economic and human capital unhinge people from their native languages and unmoor even anchor words such as nation and state, gender and mother tongue. Pieces of personal and collective identities go off on multiple and risky courses. The dis-ease needs remedies because it can be volatile and escalate into violence. One diagnosis assumes that cultural coherence is the normal and healthy state, so it leads to purgative cures. The other observes that we have outgrown simple assumptions about cultural identity and recommends that we get used to the messiness of late modernity. The first remedy would clean up the confusions (restrict immigration; enforce English-only communication; fuel militant patriotism; restore ROTC to campuses; answer jihad with crusade and conversion). The second values the loose ends of identity as lifelines for negotiating democracy (through legitimate dual citizenship, bilingual arts, and a cautious coexistence between particular codes and a lingua franca). The cleansing option is familiar and intolerant. Born-again Americans, often monolinguals, can bristle at people who speak strange languages. Spanish-speakers are asked to leave bars; Chinese conversations grate on English-only ears; the polyphony of a place like Manhattan sounds like the Mad Hatter’s raving to people like Ron Unz (sic),4 whose name plays the kind of bilingual game that brings translation close to philology and makes English play “sounds-like” games with German; it evokes the kind of intolerant populism that pits Us against Them. It’s not the foreigners themselves who bother Unz, he insists to xeno-baiters, but rather their stubborn cultural ties that tangle the country in “The Bilingual Bind.”5 “They are talking about me,” is one self-centered response. (Are you Amerdican citizen?) Self-centering seems self-evident in a powerful United States where it’s enough to speak one language, because less powerful foreigners must learn to speak English. Here monolingualism sounds normal. I am normal; you should be too. The bi- and multilingual options are unfamiliar and fresh: They admit that a large number of people in the world live in more than one language, and they develop a tolerance (even a taste) for the risky\n\n4\n\nÍ\n\nDORIS SOMMER\n\nbusiness of democratic life in which codes coexist and come into conflict. Anticipating the irritation between languages and identities (in oneself as well as in society) will make dis-ease feel normal rather than a case to be cured through drastic and violent measures. And feeling normally irritated will amount to a change of heart about how to pursue the good life. Hearts and minds are the organs of political life; without them, the best designs fail. But our tired rhythms of desire and our cramped approach to language and identity can’t keep step with democratic demands. A new sentimental education is on the agenda for this period of global movements of people and capital through multicultural states.6 It is a tall order for teachers, but an urgent one, because some of our inherited tastes for coherence and predispositions to seamless assimilation have become obstacles for democratic life. That retraining taste is feasible goes without saying, given the astounding success of the relatively recent education in feelings that made us modern national subjects. That program started only about two hundred years ago and had its effect within one generation. It depended on a neat calculus of one language per people, and obviously one per person. National feeling was the Sprachegeist, a single and unified spirit of a people. This was J. G. Herder’s shorthand prescription for defending rootedness and local self-esteem against what he considered the ravages of eighteenth-century (French) cosmopolitanism. Herder warned that living in more than one culture corrupted the soul and that bilingualism literally caused decay, a physical decomposition signaled by flatulence.7 (I mentioned this in Mexico, where bilinguals from the Yucatán turned the signal into laughing gas, since the Spanish word for “fart,” pedo, means kiss in Maya.) The very assumption that monolingualism is normal and the apparent “naturalness” of an imagined community across class and sometimes color lines prove that sentimental education works. Had that early republican effort failed, we would still feel that monarchy was the divine order of politics. The education that novelists, legislators, leaders, and mostly classroom teachers provided for the earlier republican national period practically overhauled the hearts and minds of entire populations. L’education sentimental means more than the title of a particular nineteenth-century novel by Gustave Flaubert. It is the program of an entire foundational genre and a generation of republican fathers and mothers. Now mono is a malady, an adolescent condition for times that have outgrown the one-to-one identity between language and people. Growing pains can’t be avoided in the process of maturing toward tolerance for a complicated world. How can we avoid them while peo-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nÍ 5\n\nple and languages rub against and irritate each other? Is there nevertheless a way to mitigate those pains instead of aggravating them into unbearable tensions? The choice between annoyance with evidence that doesn’t fit into inherited systems and the alternative of letting go of systems recalls the change in Wittgenstein’s approach to philosophy. He had started with an ambition to map clear relationships between words and the world. But his mature work gave up the goal of tidiness and developed a taste for vagaries. Meanings, he concluded, depend on usage in changing circumstances, not on dictionary entries, or analyzable parts, or any other language elements that had seemed stable. Language plays an almost endless variety of games and defies systematic analysis. The games include storytelling, betting, making lists, mocking, conspiring, praising, kvetching, apologizing, hinting, denying, mourning, commiserating, promising, and repeating. These and many other games are played by flexible rules that adjust to particular situations and can morph into related activities. So Wittgenstein’s game of “therapeutic” philosophy amounted to describing its own moves among others. It was, as I said, his remedy for the longstanding “problems” that had engaged philosophers (including himself) about what language could or should do. Worriers were only making problems for themselves when they noticed that words didn’t exactly coincide with the world or with ideas. Either you can deduce that words don’t quite work, since they disappoint expectations, or you can turn the observation around and notice that the systematic expectations frustrate an appreciation of the ways that words do normally work. Any reasonable person would turn around, Wittgenstein said, once it was clear that philosophy was giving itself headaches by beating its head against an inherited wall. “Do away with all explanation, and description alone must take its place.”8 That work of notation needs to include bilanguage games. They would have figured for Wittgenstein, too, if he had finally freed himself from the prescriptions he claimed to dismiss. Instead, he became cramped and stayed inside one language at a time. This Austrian in England took care not to cross over language lines. In his books, the German original and the English translation face each other on opposite pages, without apparent interference. At one point, Wittgenstein admits that an English word may come to him before the German equivalent, but the foreign word gets lost in a list of other stimuli for language, including feelings and gestures, as if English were also preverbal. Had Wittgenstein in fact described what happens in normal language use, the bilingual moment would have detained him. He might have noticed that it is a fairly common feature of speaking and\n\n6\n\nÍ\n\nDORIS SOMMER\n\nwriting, and that these moments can free up communication that seems blocked, or play jokes that turn bad humors into laughing gas. For some reason Wittgenstein stopped short of these observations. Maybe mixing codes seemed undignified for philosophy. Or maybe the requirement of universal validity needs a single universally visible code, while slips into particularism take language onto risky sidetracks. In any case, language cramps turn out to be a widespread affliction among even our most daring iconoclasts. They include Wittgenstein and Sigmund Freud (whose book of jokes translates away the Yiddish, though the humor depends on code-switching) and also Jacques Derrida (whose monolingualism misses the moves that most minority subjects make in and out of alternate identities). Universalism goes on edge in the field of bilingual games because they don’t play evenhandedly. Instead, the players take advantages of the uneven playing field where a powerful language expects to win every match, but where other languages jostle and rub power to win some points. Using more than one language causes problems for universal, acrossthe-board games of politics, philosophy and aesthetics.\n\nRoughing It “How does it feel to be a problem?” white people are always asking under their breath, says W.E.B. Du Bois. Monolinguals ask it of newcomers, too, sometimes less discreetly but in a strange language. By the time immigrants or conquered people can answer, some deny being a problem anymore, having managed to forget the home language. Others will admit that living in two or more languages can make them difficult, which isn’t a pleasant feeling. But it leaves room for maneuvering. Doubling is a lesser evil than either full assimilation—which can risk humorless self-hatred—or refusing assimilation—which will cost them opportunities. I want to suggest that feeling bad can feel good, both for migrants and for their hosts. The aesthetic advantages of uneasiness and estrangement have been selfevident since the Russian formalists lesson on art as roughness or difficulty and through the Marquis de Barthes’s taste for the “hurts so good” pleasure of texts that can taunt.9 It is the political charms of linguistic overloads and underdeterminations that will need attention and alliances between trainers of taste and theorists of statecraft. Otherwise our polyrhythmic societies will continue to sound cacophonic instead of engagingly contrapuntal. Du Bois had admitted to being a problem for a country that required assimilation but didn’t allow it. “One ever feels this twoness—\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nÍ 7\n\ntwo souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings.”10 Double consciousness was a double bind for Du Bois and demanded a structural solution: He proposed amalgamating black and white through a racial alchemy familiar to Latin Americans as mestizaje. He proposed it, singing the black blues to call attention to the color line that doubled minority souls and divided them from the majority. Du Bois sang so movingly that Americans could sometimes interrupt their colorblind and monorhythmic dance of equal and reversible partners to hear improvisations on contrasts and mutual attractions. But today, double consciousness and the bilingual binds that add sound to the black and white drama no longer seem soluble nor require solutions. The split soul could look, if we focused, like an intense experience of the general split structure of language and living as human beings. This unhappy consciousness could be a vanguard for our best cultural defense of humane practices because doubleness won’t allow the meanness of one thought, one striving, one alchemical gold standard of value. The color line has barely budged. Today it is a very busy and noisy place, like a border between the rich who need workers and the poor who need work. Sometimes the counterpoint sounds like counterpurposes, especially when the interruptions of one language by another make color a clue to difference. Foreign sounds are metonymies of dark color. Otherwise, what could “Hispanic” or “Latino” mean in response to the question of race? And why would a white face provoke a “You don’t look Spanish” skepticism from Anglos? Latinos don’t jump to the congenital conclusion about language; they lose one too easily and know the effort of gaining another. Not fitting easily or well, being both too much and not enough, makes many migrants aware of grammar trouble with themselves and with their neighbors. How is one to identify, when one is more than one, either/and? Two languages (often more) and loyalties to a home country and to hosts can seem intolerable to patriots on either side of the border, and on both sides of a divided self. “Say ‘perejil,’” Trujillo’s troops commanded the border people at the banks of a river already called Massacre in 1937. Speak English without an accent, parents advise children, just to be safe. But saying “shibbolet” with the accents of both Israel and Ephraim raises suspicions on both sides. To switch codes is to enter or leave one nation for another by merely releasing a foreign sound, a word, a grammar tic, slipping into an always borrowed and precarious language. Migrants aren’t at home even at home. The word means somewhere else, a loss for the parents and a lack for the chil-\n\n8\n\nÍ\n\nDORIS SOMMER\n\ndren who would be gringos there and may be spics here. In the Americas and throughout the modern world, linguistic be-longing is identity in the still-standard equation inherited from Herder. Today again, the logic of language rights uses the one for one equation. Consider Charles Taylor’s “Politics of Recognition” as a contemporary milestone here; and think, too, of the program to distinguish Serbian from Croatian speech so the war could go on.11 Nation builders have generally tried to reduce linguistically complex societies to simple ones, usually by the force of elimination. Even Du Bois and the ideologues of mestizaje perfected one imperial tongue.12\n\nBilingual Prosthesis Talking with two is a double bind. Bilinguals are not, Ana Celia Zentella says, pairs of monolinguals stuck at the neck, but overloaded, imperfectly doubled systems in which the supplements as well as the missing pieces destabilize both languages. Swiss cheese is the image, with more holes than matter. Verena Conley, for one, has unforgettable things to say about being literally Swiss, weaned in one language and educated in an unwelcoming rival. Even official and elite multilingualism can breed unhappy consciousness. Sylvia Molloy’s Anglo-Argentine schooling comes to mind, as does Elena Poniatowska, who learned Spanish from the maids and envied their authentic Mexicanness. How could that consciousness be happy, given the modern language economy of one per people, one per person? Something is always in the way or in demand. “Bilingual prosthesis” was the inspired mistake that Dale Shuger made when she meant to name “bilingual aesthetics” as the subject of our course one semester. When a concept is lacking, prosthetic borrowings fill in, like Molloy’s cucharite that stirred up French and Spanish, or like kosher and he’s good people which patch up a few holes in English, while imeliar or beipasear keep Spanish from crippling. But sometimes bilinguals worry about still missing pieces, because as a translation “miscegenation” vilifies mestizaje; “uncle” for a Chinese speaker ignores whether he’s on the mother’s side or the father’s; and “we” should be two words for speakers of Quechua or Guaraní, one to include, the other to exclude interlocutors. The worry is a symptom of care, not of ignorance. Yet monolinguals may mistake this exquisite but commonplace attentiveness as a deficiency in the speaker. I could go on singing the bilingual blues along with the contributors here, and we probably will, which is to recognize the bittersweet pleasures of bilingual games. These are mature pleasures wrested from re-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nÍ 9\n\nflecting on pain, as therapists and art theorists will know, however slow they are to associate everyday bilingualism with sophistication. A tragic bilingual sense of life tolerates loss because our deformed prosthetic selves survive losses. Bittersweet maturity is close to the experience of the sublime, a commonplace experience for bilinguals who live with the daily shock of disconnecting and the satisfaction of knowing it. They know that language is arbitrary, material, and fallible; this is the metalinguistic sophistication that linguists notice but don’t always defend. Bilinguals anticipate failure in ways that make contact a small miracle, through the strange and delayed meanings that the formalists valued as aesthetic artifice. And running the risk of misrepresentation and misrecognition is a kind of breathtaking vulnerability, a social death wish that brings bilanguage games to a brink. Do I risk addressing a stranger in Spanish? Will it be an invitation to intimacy, an aggressive unmasking, or a ridiculously wrong channel? The question may sound irrelevant to people who don’t make these decisions daily and may not worry about the risk. Perhaps they’ll counsel us to get over the complication and simply speak English, as if worrying about which language to use were not an exercise in the interpersonal delicacy and caution that amount to civic behavior. Am I making any sense in English, if readers are assessing what I say without asking how to asesorarme? Letting a bilingual pun slip in, I ask for less judgment and more help, because the prospect of failure and the promise of a miracle produces a Schadenfreude of communication that splits me between jokester and butt of the joke, an alienating thrill that bilinguals learn to survive. It is a Freudian Freude of one word betraying another’s intention, except that the master was reluctant to follow slippery words past language barriers. Veering from one signifier to a “sounds-like” neighbor is a technique of disguise or escape that marks multilinguals even when we’re not trying to be funny. I remember the punctilious old ladies in my neighborhood who had very close veins, because varicose made no sense in English. These were the same funny ladies who figured that Giselle MacKenzie of “The Hit Parade” must be famous, because mir kennen sie, unlike the already forgotten Sean Fergessen.\n\nPolitical Predispositions Political theory has been slow to pursue the advantages of bilingual effects. It is often stuck in the anxiety aroused by migrant workers who strain or interrupt national arrangements. Sometimes, theory responds with compensatory designs to make room for difference,\n\n10\n\nÍ\n\nDORIS SOMMER\n\noften spelling out rights and responsibilities for citizens who no longer speak the same native language. It hardly ever suggests that the differences could be good for politics, though Bonnie Honig’s Democracy and the Foreigner (2001) invites rethinking. One political advantage of bilingualism is precisely its nervousness about communication; it demands caution and respectful distance. Another advantage of fitting badly is that Unheimlichkeit is unhappy, restless, and available for change. Being at a loss and anticipating unpredictable differences create a margin of disidentification from existing structures and possibly the energy to adjust them. In top-down systems, bilingualism is a dangerous supplement that signals lateral codes and cagey moves in and out of them. More than one language per person means more than one way to eat, dress, pray, cure, dance, think. Plurals sidestep the “monism at the root of every extremism,” Isaiah Berlin’s wrote.13 In a world where lingering colonial arrangements and mass migrations make bi- or multilingualism normal, it remains almost inaudible for theoretical interventions, because disciplines press on in one language at a time. To pose the bilingual question to aesthetics, politics, and philosophy is to ask how the disciplines change when we hear more than one language constitute their games. The gains will go beyond refreshing some tired subjects with the challenge of minoritarian (Latino, indigenist, migrant) practices. Reciprocally, the changing disciplines can dislodge those irritating practices from weary identitarian postures in order to promote engagements with what we call “high theory.” Until now, a politics of language has polarized regional autonomists and centralists. In either case it assumes that people choose between languages rather than live with both. Most have never lived with only one. And it’s a good thing. The borders between regional and national, home and host languages map onto people as well as territories. This is bad only for taking sides in a conflict, which is why patriots prefer monolingual loyalties. What can a country expect from doubletalking dual nationals? It can expect, I want to suggest, a level of ambivalence so unbearable it might help to deter conflict. Double consciousness is surely a dis-ease of bad fits, but the cure of reducing two minds to one of them can be catastrophically narrow, as Du Bois knew. Those who don’t feel strained by the split may object that bilingualism doesn’t necessarily lead to double-consciousness. Or they may call us to order claiming that monolingualism is better for communication. The objections sound prescriptive and rather deaf to differences of class, color, and location. One reason the English and the Irish don’t get along even in the same language, Terry Eagleton\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nÍ 11\n\ntaunts, is that one assumes that language is for communication, and the other knows it’s for performance (the Irish Question).14 Living in two or more competing languages troubles the assumption that communication should be easy and upsets the desired coherence of romantic nationalism and ethnic essentialism. This can be a good thing, I repeat, since confusion and even anxiety about conflicting identities and belongings are vigilant and insomniac; they interrupt the dangerous dreams of single-minded loyalty. But the condition is volatile and will demand outlets: Either it can seek purgative cures for difference, or it can develop a new, almost perverse, taste for anxiety and irritation as stimuli for partial relief. A totalitarian danger of one response to bilingual belongings and the liberating promise of another urges an intervention by political theorists. Of course we can assume that all are created equal, but in the real world some feel more equal than others, and those others feel more split. That heightened tragicomic feeling of being too much and too little can be a beacon for a new ironic but active political sensibility. It will be an antidote for the single-minded utopian desire for fullness, just as description was Wittgenstein’s antidote for philosophical headaches. Utopia wishes away struggle, and with it politics and desire, along with the creativity that discomfort demands. Appreciating discomfort as the goad for creativity will need a new sentimental education to develop a taste for unfinished pieces. While teachers of literature already value negativity as room for interpretation and surprise (ambiguity), we seldom make it matter for politics or deign to notice the exhibitionist ambiguity of bilingual arts. In fact, bilingual education is almost always a scaffold meant to get students from one language to another and then to fall away. Today, politics in literary studies seems inimical to the aesthetics of ambiguity; it is more likely to defend a particular identity inside the hegemonic language than to develop maneuverability between codes. This makes criticism and pedagogy lag dangerously behind creative literature, which is alarming for politics, even if social scientists remain skeptical about what humanists do. What we do is teach taste, judgment, sensibility—that is, a predisposition for one kind of politics or another. This is an opportunity for a new alliance between politics and literature. Defenders of democracy need pedagogues who can teach a taste for irritation, and literary studies needs something more flexible than identity politics if it hopes to recover the moral dimension of aesthetics. The alliance can count on some already existing links onto language and literary theory. I’ll claim them as precursors (as I claim\n\n12\n\nÍ\n\nDORIS SOMMER\n\nBorges as the model for this metaleptic move) in order to project a future tradition and thereby shore up some cautious optimism about reforming democratic feelings. For example, Wittgenstein woke up from the egolotrous fantasy of precise, controllable language to appreciate its precariousness. Language was not a totality but an infinity of unpredictable games that needed room to play, even though Wittgenstein didn’t cross from one language field to another. For another example, Ernesto Laclau’s advice to engage in irritating negotiations for rights and resources makes feeling “bad” politically good.15 And Bonnie Honig recommends that democracy stop expecting national romances and face its gothic tensions between dread and desire. The advice sounds familiar from reading Roland Barthes, for whom the point of reading was to get “neurotic kicks,” the “hurts so good” effect that he shamelessly called bliss. And though Barthes’s lust is a personal incentive, his lesson in literary erotics and the joys of irritation should not be lost for a politics of reciprocal rights and responsibilities. Barthes knew that reciprocity is asymmetrical, that the great artist refuses to deliver easy satisfactions. The effect of bliss is to leave the reader at a loss, panting for more contact. His admission of joy in these frustrating engagements makes intermittence and externality necessary conditions for intimacy (see Winnicott too). But bilinguals improve on Barthes’s provocation against complacent “ideal” readers; they multiply the positions and add levels of ignorance and bliss. All are less than ideal because a single ideal would gather up externalities as if the differences hardly mattered. This is no cause for concern. It’s a relief in hopelessly heterogeneous societies. We’ve lost faith in the single ideal national language, and thank God(s) for the loss, because it lets us be imperfectly human and console or cajole ourselves with endlessly creative bilingual games (gains, in a Spanish accent).\n\nThe Players Sylvia Molloy will have a final word in the “Bilingual Scenes” of a life that inspires future investigations. But her essay helps to frame the present collection too. She combines both the literary effects featured in Bilingual Games and the critical attention that our collection hopes to promote. Molloy’s reflections and her novels make fuel from the burden of both languages; they press unhomeliness into movement and wonder between what can and cannot be said. This restlessness also makes Molloy an outstanding interpreter of literature. Elected president of the Modern Language Association in\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nÍ 13\n\n2001, she promoted reflections on “Translation” among a membership that tends to stay in the cautious sub-fields of English or any one of the “foreign languages.” Anglo-Argentines don’t have to choose and lose traditions, and an exceptional model like Molloy can inspire an entire profession toward risky and creative moves. Can teachers and critics afford to miss those moves between languages and traditions while the world is busily crossing borders? Michael Holquist trumps this question with another. (Why respond to questions with questions? Why not?) In an essay that will center the following Investigations for anyone who thinks that bilingualism is marginal, he asks, “What Is the Ontological Status of Bilingualism?” The answer will surprise unwary readers who imagine that the condition is particular to some people and irrelevant to others. No one will remain unaffected, whatever language(s) one uses. Although our collection gives disproportional space to Spanish-English games, the imbalance shows my limited reach, rather than the practically endless range of possibilities. Thanks to Holquist’s meditation on the fissured and choice-driven nature of language, our volume begins with a more elegant defense of that range than any possible apologies for exclusions could muster. But his point may be easier to understand than to assimilate for readers raised on the ideal of romance between a people and their language. So this first section called “Choices”? continues with a follow-up rhetorical question by Enrique Bernárdez: “Is Monolingualism Possible?” Asking it is practically seditious from his home in Madrid, the nostalgic center of a lost empire that had forced everyone (Jews, Moors, Amerindians, Africans) to speak the same devotional language, or “Talk Christian!” Ana Celia Zentella is a leader of linguistic sedition against the racist legacies of empire. “José Can You See?” shows the colors of linguistic intolerance by outing racism and monolingualism as accomplices. From the conquered extremes of both Puerto Rico and Aztlán, she upsets authority by outmaneuvering it. These two linguists from both ends of the Spanish-speaking world exercise a tragicomic sense of the vagaries that bring everyday language games to the borders of literary effect. One effect is to bristle at purists and patriots; another is to chuckle over linguistic prudes. Particular settings will provoke a range of performances and effects. “Some Places,” the title of the next section, beg bi- or multilingual questions about who belongs and how to claim pride of place. Five essays explore some effects of polyphonic spaces that pull creativity in competing directions and twist it into lifelines where choosing means losing. A space like New York is Juan Flores’s “New York,\n\n14\n\nÍ\n\nDORIS SOMMER\n\nDiaspora City,” where Latinos fit in as well as almost anyone, but with remainders that tug elsewhere. New York seems to belong to everyone and to no one in particular. The best thing about “the City,” a familiar joke goes, is that it’s so close to the United States! Friends tell me the same joke is repeated in Miami and Los Angeles and probably elsewhere. Maybe Montreal knows a variation. Sherry Simon’s “Crossing Town: Montreal in Translation” is a meeting point for migrants. The unsettled poignancy of too many languages and not enough of one makes Montreal an unheimlich home. The mix sounds different, though, when people stay put and empires move in. In “Bilingualisms, Quechua Poetry, and Postmodern Subjectivity,” José Antonio Mazzotti listens to contemporary Peru, where Quechua poetry plays survival games in parries with Spanish. Neither language escapes the fragmentation and migration that describe people, too. The movement and resistance can damn whole populations into becoming “men with guns,” while dreamers escape to a haven “cerca del cielo.” The astounding multilingual movie by John Sayles inspires Joshua Miller to traces the filmmaker’s “Transamerican Trail” from Texas to a Central American mountain top, where Maya and birdsong may survive. Survival of indigenous sounds does not, however, seem to be at issue in the Maghreb, according to Réda Bensmaïa. Rather, the challenge is the uneasy coexistence of more language options than any one place might manage. The dry land seems to preserve all the languages that claim it, each imperfectly. The two poles that pull at most Peruvians or Canadians multiply in the “Tetraglossia” of Maghrebi writers. Historical layers of conquest and nomadic nations that refuse to submit add up to (impossible) choices of language that go beyond either/or decisions. Genders frame the third section to pull the effects of place toward positioning in the ubiquitous game that we might call the “war of positions,” to borrow Gramsci’s term, between male and female moves. As an incentive to tease language in one direction or another, gender might seem to divide performances along either/or lines between male and female, gay and straight. But bilingual games don’t play at choice and loss of positions; they “queer” language, as Henry Abelove quipped after some jokes, by slipping in and out of identifiable roles and rules. Winning those queer games that don’t stay in one language or another amounts to upsetting any stable expectation with more creativity than any script can allow. Each surprise is an aesthetic effect that exposes the dimension of artifice in language and gender, the dimension of wiggle room for maneuver in and out of tight spots. Margo Glantz plays along with “Doña Marina and Cap-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nÍ 15\n\ntain Malinche,” as Cortés’s consort squeezes past constraints in the double games of political and erotic inversion. Moving among languages and between genders, Mexico’s “mother” was always a step ahead of the men who needed her, and wily enough to keep them panting. Breathless too, from reading El caso Casey, Gustavo PérezFirmat follows the Cuban writer past the male and female wards of the prison house of Spanish to tenuous attachments in Italian. There, where love is possible but precarious, Casey caresses a foreign tongue in “Bilingual Blues, Bilingual Bliss.” That a Cuban regime of gender continues to push language to its limits is clear from the “Lexicon” that Esther Whitfield culls in El hombre el hambre y la hembra by Diana Chaviano. The adjustment of mere vowels in the title measures the short but significant distances between men and women held together and apart by hunger. Short on money, the island is a mint for subtle sounds and new words that keep foreigners wondering about who’s who and how to spend dollars or make contact. From a neighboring island, Benigno Trigo defends existing language. In Puerto Rico, he says, “The Mother Tongue” speaks two languages. Afloat between the strong political alternative of U.S. statehood and the tenuous dreams of independence, Puerto Rico has managed to stay clear of defining decisions (that would cause either a loss of resources or a loss of face). It remains a creatively queer, oxymoronic, “free associated state.” Debates about official language(s) are just as lively and inconclusive. They concern politics and pedagogy more than the arts, because island writers almost always perform, gloriously, in Spanish as a charm against the powerful spell of Americanization. Rosario Ferré worked that charm for years in books that became canonical, while her heart and mind strained toward independence. But her writing pulls elsewhere now, in an English that can offend patriotic ears. Canons may seem to preserve the particular charms of a linguistic tradition, but a double take exposes some central texts in the section titled Double Barreled Canon. This canon enlists foreignness to refresh the waning forces of familiarity. Foreign words help to roughen a home language into producing aesthetic effects, said a grateful Viktor Shklovsky. Polyglossia is the necessary condition for real wisdom and humor, Mikhail Bakhtin insisted at the end of his long book on Rabelais. In the five demonstrations that follow, bilingual games take center stage in a variety of literary performances, not by chance. Borderline moves that strain legitimate languages actually produce the exciting effects that give the language staying power against familiarity-fatigue. Yunte Huang describes Ezra Pound’s “Process of\n\n16\n\nÍ\n\nDORIS SOMMER\n\nPidginizing Chinese” for English effect. It was Pound, after all, who canonized his own roster of poets to foreground refreshing techniques rather than pleasant results. Thanks to Huang’s multilingual reading, Pound’s own poetry is caught poaching and pulling found art out of shape. As self-appointed mentor to other poets, Pound had an extraordinary effect on William Carlos Williams, who began writing with the echoes of Spanish (his mother’s, Quevedo’s, Lope’s) in his English verse. In “Found in Translation: Reflections of a Bilingual American,” Julio Marzán tells how the Spanish sounds subsided, but not the affective echoes, or the uneasiness of double-barreled resentments between Mr. Pound and Mrs. Williams. But how might either Mr. Hispanophobe or Mrs. Hispanophile have accounted for the lasting quality of freshly minted Peruvian Spanish? Some of the first home-bred chroniclers knew the language well enough to pass as intellectuals in the motherland; others knew enough to use it with a studied clumsiness that called readers to attention in the war of unequal positions. All of them, Julio Ortega shows, scarred the language with indigenous intrusions and sutured it into renewed life. The technique could describe Ernest Hemingway’s English, or Fanon’s to mention just two famous double-barreled canonical writers. But perhaps the most notorious case of lending a language new life by borrowing accents from another is the operation of “Kafka’s Languages.” David Suchoff hears the accents, from Yiddish and from Hebrew, and marvels at the appreciation of effects while their sources seem irrelevant to readers. The very success of foreign effects has the paradoxical result of feeling so normal that German can remain selfsufficient instead of consciously dependent on neighbors, including disdained minorities. Kafka got away with cutting and pasting Jewish material into German texts; maybe he enjoyed a small satisfaction of subtle revenge on the beautiful language would never be quite his. But for Igor Guberman, revenge on anti-Semitic narrowness was explosive and hilarious. Greta Slobin describes his campaign inside and against the normative Russian language, forcing the mother tongue into unorthodox service. His punchy poems often deliver their jabs in Yiddish, but against the backdrop of the classical poetic tradition, thus involving most Russians in his work. Shooting off in too many directions for any canon to contain him, Guberman challenges the limits of legitimate bilingual games. Testing and tuning our ears to a range of naïve and naughty games, these “Investigations” invite readers to pursue the possibilities of bilingual lives. Sylvia Molloy’s exemplary reflections can suggest how playing these games, sometimes by being drafted into them,\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nÍ 17\n\nhones the kind of wisdom and humor that become available only at the borders between languages and between pieces of our complicated personae.

Miscegenation has been pronounced with mistrust or revulsion, while Latin American racial mixing, called mestizaje, has often been an official slogan in Spanish and Portuguese. Mestizaje endorses the particularity of New World peoples through a rhetoric of national brotherhood that is meant to ease racial tensions, not necessarily to address material equity. Latin Americans would immediately recognize Du Bois’s manifesto for merging as a conventional banner of cultural pride. It was, for example, the standard of the Independence movement throughout the continent, when Simón Bolívar proclaimed that Spanish Americans have many fathers, but only one mother; that they are neither Spanish, nor Indian, nor Black, but all of these. A century later, to mention just one more of many examples, mestizaje reaffirmed Mexico as a modern country with a mission to the world. For a hundred years, the republic had been torn between indigenist liberals like President Benito Juárez, and Europeanizing monarchists who replaced him with Maximillian. Both sides would contribute, said the minister of education during the Mexican Revolution, to making the new man. Whites and Indians would be joined by Blacks and Asians in the unprecedented culmination of one “cosmic race.” This would happen in Mexico, José Vasconcelos wrote in 1925, because no other country was as free from the racial prejudice that obstructs human progress. Anglo-Saxons (like Emerson and Whitman) seemed to prosper by divine will, but, Vasconcelos underlined, “they committed the sin of destroying those races, while we assimilated them, and this gives us new rights and hopes for admission without precedent in History.” José Vasconcelos, The Cosmic Race.

Michael Holquist\n\nBilingualism is a topic constantly found in the news media. It is discussed (usually in heated tones) on the subway, in bars, and other social gatherings, as well as in the halls of Congress. At a time when many, even those with the Modern Language Association, question the relevance to society of the humanities in general and the role of language and literature departments in particular, it was shrewd of Doris Sommer to choose so urgent an issue as bilingualism for one of the presidential panels (generally devoted to the topic of translation) at the MLA national meeting in New Orleans in December 2001. Those panels brought home with new force the gravity and immediacy of bilingualism. The topic emerged as a phenomenon larger than some of us previously had thought. The papers made clear that it is a topic more capacious than its cultural, political, educational, or even economic dimensions, although these are, of course, enormous. Together, they manifested a growing awareness of a new theoretical latency in bilingualism. Each paper provided a specific illustration of a general truth about bilingualism, a truth that gave them all their unusual coherence. The larger point that each of them made through their particular examples was this: The condition of being in at least two languages appears increasingly to be the natural condition of having any language at all. More precisely, the concept that a human being might be confined to only one language appears increasingly to be a fiction. At best, we might charitably assume the monolingual thesis (as I shall call it) has held sway in most societies for so long because of a certain theoretical naiveté in the societies where it has been taken to be a fact of nature. It\n\n22\n\nÍ\n\nMICHAEL HOLQUIST\n\nis a cliché of anthropology that certain traditional societies recently encountered in the New Guinea highlands or the headwaters of the Amazon, much as had ancient cultures in the Old World and aboriginal groups in the New, took as their collective name a term that could be translated as “the people,” or “humans.” Assuming they were the only people in the world, it is not surprising they should also have assumed that the language they spoke was the only one in the world. But of course their assumption of uniqueness was based only on their isolation, not on the teeming diversity of a world outside the experience or dreams of such groups. It may have been only a delusion, but the sense they were speaking the only language in existence nevertheless had, for such societies, an effect on how they conceived language itself: In the great majority of previously “undiscovered” tribes, most speakers assume an intimacy between words and things that is denied to citizens of cultures in which other languages are known to exist. It seems to follow that in the wake of such polylingualism, people become more selfconscious about their words, aware of a growing gap between them and the world. Writing, when it appears, only complicates matters. Postphilological societies emerge in which the invention of formal grammars and the presence of literacy mark a gap between sign and referent. In such postphilological communities, characterized by their more intense experience of cultural and linguistic variety, the monolingual thesis becomes difficult to maintain. Indeed, it becomes impossible to hold without elaborate rationalization for claims of uniqueness. In later, sentimental stages of culture, self-conscious effort is required to create the effect of naiveté. Instead of being able to assume a special status for any particular language as a natural language, such claims to privilege must be posited. Ernst Cassirer has provided a striking example of how claims to a unitary language can be manufactured in the face of manifest diversity. In his account of totalitarianism in The Myth of the State, he argues that the events enabling Nazi accession to power began long before 1933. He goes back to the origins of the political mythology that preceded Germany’s rearmament, particularly those that involved changes in German culture: “The first step that had to be taken was a change in the function of language” (282). His argument is that German, like any other language, can be made to serve many different functions. Two that are crucial he calls “semantic” and “magical” word usage, a distinction found in all cultures. “Even among the so-called primitive languages the semantic function of the word is never missing; without it there could be no human speech. But in primitive societies the magic word has a pre-\n\nWHAT IS THE ONTOLOGICAL STATUS OF BILINGUALISM?\n\nÍ 23\n\ndominant and overwhelming influence. It does not describe things or relations of things; it tries to produce effects and to change the course of nature. . . . Curiously enough [he writes with heavy irony] all this recurs in our modern world” (282–283). As an instance of magic language in the present, he cites his own experience in trying to grasp German as it was spoken in the Third Reich: “If nowadays I happen to read a German book, published in these last ten years [1934–1944], not a political but a theoretical book, a work dealing with philosophical, historical, or economic problems—I find to my amazement that I no longer understand the German language . . . words which formerly were used in a descriptive, logical, or semantic sense are now used as magic words that are destined to produce certain effects and to stir up certain emotions. Our ordinary words are charged with meanings; but these new-fangled words are charged with feelings and violent passions” (283). He gives the example of a little book that seeks to translate some of the new German words used by the Nazis into English, an attempt that in his eyes fails utterly: “For unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, it was impossible to render these words adequately in English. What characterizes them is not so much their content and their objective meaning as the emotional atmosphere that surrounds and envelops them” (283). To illustrate his point, he adduces the two terms Siegfriede and Siegerfriede: “Even for a German ear it will not be easy to grasp this difference. The two words sound exactly alike, and seem to denote the same thing. Sieg means victory, Friede means peace; how can the combination of the two words produce entirely different meanings? Nevertheless, we are told that, in modern German usage, there is all the difference in the world between the two terms. For a Siegfriede is a peace through German victory; whereas a Siegerfriede means the very opposite; it is used to denote a peace which would be dictated by the allied conquerors” (283–284). What the Nazis sought to do was to erect one version of German into a language that was symbiotic with their party’s ideological essence. Others, such as Cassirer, might still speak a language that bore a surface resemblance to the Nazi performance of German. Insofar as they did, their use of the language could be compared with the use made by any other people of their language: That is, Cassirer spoke German in the same sense that Frenchmen spoke French, or even the way that Russians spoke Russian. But the German language of the Nazi party was not like that. For all such apparent similarities to the use made by people of their native languages, the Nazi version of German was perceived to have one thing that made it unique, and\n\n24\n\nÍ\n\nMICHAEL HOLQUIST\n\nthus different from all other tongues. It was a magic language precisely because it did not participate in the first condition of all other natural languages—that is, its signs were not arbitrary, but had a primordial immediacy to the truth as the Nazis conceived it. This is not the place to go into the complex (but relatively wellknown) story of how the German language assumed a magic status in post-Romantic European nationalism. Something like the same story could also describe the tortured course of the French language since at least the seventeenth century, and especially after the French Revolution, as attempts to centralize and homogenize the State were prosecuted through attempts to create a centralized version of French. The confusions resulting from the collapse of the Soviet Union have produced even more grotesque experiments to weld language to identity in such places as Moldova and (with bloody seriousness) the Balkans. I mention these lugubrious, but all-too-well known examples of monolingualism to reinforce my initial argument, that the concept of a single language taken as norm appears increasingly to be at best a primitive misconception of the world, and at worst to be an ideologically driven state policy. The politics of enforcing a single language, no matter what form such a politics might assume, results in oppression of a kind I presume need not be spelled out for most readers of this book. Perhaps too much effort in debates about bilingualism has been expended on denouncing evils the errancy of which is matched only by their obviousness. In this short intervention, I will assume that it might be more interesting, if only for a change, to speculate not on the ethics of bilingualism, but rather on the ontology of bilingualism. Now, I am fully aware of how pompous such a move must seem, so I hasten to add that by invoking the overdetermined term ontology, I wish merely to locate what seems to me to be the biggest difference between arguments for the privilege of a single language versus arguments for the virtues of two (or more) languages. And I seek to do so in a form that will cast light on all such debates (later we shall consider differences between bi- and polylingualism). In all the discussions (including those at the MLA Presidential Forum) about bilingualism of which I am aware, there is ample evidence that whatever else it might be, “monolingualism” has a fictive quality about it insofar as it lacks a firm basis in what we have learned about language itself. Monolingualism lacks a theoretical basis that can stand up to the knowledge we have gained about language in the millennia through which it has been studied all over the globe. Monolingualism has at its heart a passion for wholeness, a desire for\n\nWHAT IS THE ONTOLOGICAL STATUS OF BILINGUALISM?\n\nÍ 25\n\nunity, a lust for order in a world in which variety and contingency seem to rule. Insofar as it does, it presumes a concept of the autonomous self and of the uniquely homogenous state that, outside the emotional universe within which such claims are advanced, is theoretically indefensible. We have been talking about language as if it were a self-evident concept, which of course it is not. So let me specify more clearly what I mean when I invoke the word. It is a view of language that seems best suited to accounting for the reality of bilingualism as it stands over against the phantom dream of a single language. In its major outlines it derives from a variety of East European thinkers, but several of its primary assumptions are found in many other traditions as well. The founding assumption of this view is that language is best conceived as having its most deepest ground in relation rather than in things. It will generally be conceded by most that any individual language is best thought of in terms of relations that exist among the elements that constitute it. More significant for the argument of this paper is that the larger language of which each particular tongue is a variant should also be conceived relationally. More particularly, this larger language might best be conceived as a contest between two opposing tendencies. Any specific utterance will be erected out of a negotiation between the two larger forces: An utterance is always a compromise between the two. At the highest level of abstraction, these shaping drives might most economically be characterized as those centrifugal forces that focus and bind meaning together with maximum lucidity on the one side, and on the other, centripetal forces that expand the possibility of meaning by prying apart existing nodes of significance to reveal previously unsuspected aspects in them. These two powers have been called by many different names. I choose centripetal and centrifugal as they have come to me in my work on Bakhtin, but Bakhtin is, of course, drawing on the great Humboldtian insight that language is energy, an event (energija) rather than something finished, a made thing (ergon). This agonistic way of seeing things is a philosophy of language (or, as Bakhtin will say, it is a metalinguistics) more than a linguistics because the view it assumes of our words is grounded in a larger vision of existence, the person, and the way the world works. A distinction between actions and words is resisted in the assumption that words are actions, and as such among the building blocks of existence itself. The Russian term Bakhtin uses for “being” is always “the event of being” (sobytie yitija), not only because his conception of existence is dynamic, but because the Russian word for event stresses the interdependent nature\n\n26\n\nÍ\n\nMICHAEL HOLQUIST\n\nof it: Sobytie is a compound in Russian, made up of the prefix so(meaning ‘with’) and the root bytie (meaning ‘being’). In other words, existence is always shared and therefore nothing, no one, is in itself. I have no doubt gone on too long (and at a horrendous level of abstraction) about the metaphysical assumptions of a particular way of conceiving language. I have done so in order to move discussion of bilingualism beyond arguments about Spanish versus English in New York City schools, for instance, or the relation of English to French in Quebec. These are significant issues that need airing, but in the long run if we wish to contribute to such debates as more than simply concerned citizens, we must, as academics, find a more primordial set of categories to meditate the transient arguments that are always with us. In what follows, I will appeal not only to philosophy of language, but to a number of concepts in linguistics that may help us understand the ineluctability of bilingualism, even among those who presume they are speaking a single language. One category that always casts its shadow over such debates is same/different. For instance, in itself “English only” is a banal thesis. So impoverished a concept can work at all only because of the same/difference distinction that powers it. It rallies those who valorize sameness over difference. But opposition to monolingualism is theoretically insufficient if it simply does a flip-flop and invokes the principle of difference alone, as its battle cry. As those who speculate on language know, as Serge Karcevskij writes, “opposition pure and simple necessarily leads to chaos and cannot serve as the basis of a system. True differentiation presupposes a simultaneous resemblance and difference” (51). In other words, as students of language, we have available to us debating resources that inhere in the nature of our subject itself, for “[i]n a complete sign (a word as opposed to morpheme) there are two centers of semiotic functions, one for the formal values, the other for semantic values. The formal values of a word (gender, number, case, aspect, tense) represent aspects of signification known to every speaking subject, which are more or less safe from any subjective interpretation on the part of interlocutors; they are assumed to remain identical to themselves in all situations. The semantic part of a word, in contrast, is a residue resistant to any attempt to decompose it into elements as ‘objective’ as formal values” (Karcevskij 52). Monolingulism seeks—either from ignorance or from design—to collapse these two poles of language in order to claim privilege for a particular language. A correlate of assuming that every element in language is the site for an active struggle be-\n\nWHAT IS THE ONTOLOGICAL STATUS OF BILINGUALISM?\n\nÍ 27\n\ntween centripetal and centrifugal (formal and semantic) forces is that there are no single words. Each word exists as an entity in its own right, of course. But it is also simultaneously a particular instantiation of how the generalizing tendency in language might relate to the no less omnipresent individualizing impulse. Or, as Karcevskij puts it, “every linguistic sign is potentially a homonym and a synonym at the same time” (51). The English word watch, for instance, can be a verb or a noun; after specifying in any particular utterance that I invoke it as a noun, and that I mean a timepiece and not a guarding action, but rather the watch I wear on my wrist even as I speak, I am still unable to claim an utter uniqueness for the word. Not only is the thing on my wrist not identical with the word watch, it is also the case that by insisting that I mean not any watch in the world, but this particular watch in this precise moment, I have still not exhausted a certain minimally necessary synonymic aspect of the word, the general watch-ness of the word watch. For to understand that this and only this watch is meant in this particular utterance, my interlocutor must know what watch in general means in English. In order to achieve a sense of my watch he must go to the pole of homonymy. But to do so, he must simultaneously maintain awareness of the pole synonymy, his knowledge of other watches. What this suggests is that every word in all languages is a doublet. The Bible says that in the beginning was the Word; Goethe says that in the beginning was the deed. Perhaps Samuel Beckett was closer to the truth of language when he joked that in the beginning was the pun. But if it is the case, as it seems, that the primordial nature of language is relational and doubled, the question has to arise: Why have so many for so long been deluded by (or have sought to delude others into believing) the chimera of a single language? The reason, as I have tried to suggest, is to be found in confusion about what is meant when the fraught word language is invoked. In pondering the meaning of the term, the somewhat fuzzy philosophy I sketched above that sees language as primordially doubled (at least) finds unexpected support in an emerging consensus among linguists, especially those linguists who pride themselves on being hardheaded pragmatists suspicious of all “philosophical” claims. I have in mind here work being done by a whole group of researchers, influenced by Noam Chomsky, among whom the best known is probably Mark Baker. They are adherents of a body of ideas that has several names but is collectively called parametric theory. The group is characterized by a general (but not uncritical) acceptance of Noam Chomsky’s argument that all actually spoken languages are embedded in a\n\n28\n\nÍ\n\nMICHAEL HOLQUIST\n\nset of deep structures that constitute a Universal Grammar (UG). Despite the philosopher John Searle’s recent claim that the Chomskian revolution has failed, most professional linguists believe it is more accurate to say that Chomsky’s ideas have gone through a complex evolution over the last forty years. A particularly important step in that evolution was taken in 1981 when Chomsky introduced the concept of “parameter” as a means for understanding the relation between universal grammar (UG) and particular languages. The most recent account of how parametric theory might change our view of language has been provided by Mark Baker, and in the brief summary that follows I will draw heavily on his latest book, The Atoms of Language. Two sets of doublets used by linguists will be of help here. The first dyad is a distinction Chomsky introduced almost thirty years ago. As had Saussure before him, he sought to answer the question, What is the subject that linguists study? And he came up with an answer that had two parts. There is first of all what he called I-language, in which I was meant to convey “intentional” and “internal.” It was a deep level of structure that supplied the armature for his postulate of a Universal Grammar underlying all languages. I-language is never found in actual use—it is a set of potentials. But the potentials are not laid up in a hypothetical heaven of neo-Platonic otherness. On the contrary, their presence can be deduced and demonstrated through several features that exist in words actually used by any speaker of any language—what Chomsky called the E-level of language, where E stands for expressive, insofar as the level where language is actually produced in human speech. It is this I/E distinction that marks as well the levels between competence in knowing all the rules of a particular language (many of which are never articulated in expression) on the one hand, and on the other, performance, in which the rules produce actually articulated utterances in everyday life. Chomsky’s assumption of a Universal Grammar met with (and continues to encounter) strong resistance across a broad spectrum of professionals, from neuroscientists and philosophers to other linguists. In further elucidating his position, Chomsky developed another set of terms to define language as a hard-wired set of possibilities present in all healthy human brains. Among the more productive of these terms are those that constitute the second dyad I wish to use in my further remarks, the distinction posited by Chomsky in the late seventies and early eighties (following on the important “government-binding” talks delivered at Cambridge) as P/P, or principle/parameter.\n\nWHAT IS THE ONTOLOGICAL STATUS OF BILINGUALISM?\n\nÍ 29\n\nWith the introduction of the category of parameter, Chomsky accomplished several goals at once. He first of all gave an answer to those who had accused him of excessive abstraction, of being a theorist whose model had a huge black hole at its center, the void between the I and the E levels of language. Much as Plato had been charged with a too-radical cutoff between his realm of pure ideas and the realm of everyday life, Chomsky was frequently attacked for insufficient thickness of description in his account of how I-level rules gradually transformed themselves into E-level phenomena. The answer Chomsky and his followers proposed after 1981 was an intermediary category between the rules of I-level and the actually articulated words of the E-level. Parameters are the key to this new way of thinking, insofar as they are the links of the chain connecting the highest level of generality with the greatest degree of specificity in language. Mark Baker, a Chomsky student who has done a great deal of work to clarify parametric theory, finds normative models in the history of physics and chemistry. In asking what linguistics should be able to produce if it is really a science, he puts forward the example of the Periodic Table of Elements. That is, a description of language should be complete, much as the Periodic Table of Elements contains every possible element in the universe, even those that had not been discovered when Mendeleev first proposed it and was able “to predict the existence of germanium, scandium, and gallium because he found that his periodic table worked best if he left blank boxes near silicon, boron, and aluminum” (Baker 160). Secondly, a description should be systematic in the way that the periodic table manifests system. That is, “not only are all elements included, but they are placed in a natural order. The atomic number of each element is exactly one more than the element to its left, and the chemical valence of each element is the same as the one just above it. Thus the arrangement of elements in the table communicates essential properties to the informed observer at a glance” (Baker 159–160). Linguists have yet to produce anything so splendidly reliable as the Table of Periodic elements, and probably they never will, but they are at least approaching something like the completeness and systematicity of description that characterize Mendeleev’s achievement. Certainly they have introduced a greater degree of rigor to the study of language. At the heart of their proposal is that just as words are the atoms of E-language, parameters are the atoms of I-language (Baker 57). Perhaps the simplest way to explain a parameter is to think of it as “a choice point in the general recipe for a human language. A parameter is\n\n30\n\nÍ\n\nMICHAEL HOLQUIST\n\nan ingredient that can be added in order to make one kind of language left out in order to make another kind. A parameter could also be a combining procedure that can be done in two or three different ways to give two or three different kinds of languages. If you take the generic ingredients of language, add spice B, and shake, you get English. If you take the same basic ingredients of language, but instead of spice B you add flavorings D and E and stir, you get Navajo. I-languages are recipes, and parameters are the few basic steps in those recipes where differences among languages can be created” (Baker 57). Crackers and bread seem quite different things, but their apparent dissimilarity comes about through the inclusion or exclusion of a single ingredient, yeast. A quick example of what a linguistic parameter might look like is the so-called null subject parameter. I use it because it involves familiar languages and also because it was an important part of the discovery procedure that led to the formulation of parametric theory in exchanges between Chomsky and his student Richard Kayne, who was teaching in Italy at the time. From the point of view of superficial syntax, a French sentence looks very much like an Italian sentence, insofar as they usually contain a subject noun phrase followed by a verb that is marked for tense. “Jean arrivera.”/“Gianni verra.” Italian differs from French and English, however, in that the subject can also come after the verb, as in “Verra gianni.” But it is incompetent to say in French, “Arrivera Jean.” A second difference between Italian and French (and English) is the way they refer to someone who is already known from context. If Jean has already been discussed, we might say “Il arrivera.” But in Italian you may simply pronounce, “Verra,” which in Italian qualifies as a complete and well-formed sentence. There are other differences that flow from those I have just mentioned (for instance, you must say “It is raining” in English or “Il pleut” in French, whereas you can say in Italian simply, “Piove.” What is important for my argument here is that all these differences between Italian and French (and English) can be read as the consequences of a single fundamental difference: In some languages (such as French or English and, we might add, Nigerian, Edo [an African language]), every tensed clause must have an overt subject. Conversely, in some other languages (Italian, Spanish, Romanian, Japanese, Navajo) tensed clauses need not have an overt subject. A myriad of differences will flow from the single axis of the null subject parameter, depending on how it is instrumented in a particular language system. If so much is accepted, parametrics, when combined with the Bakhtinian emphasis on the paramount role of simultaneity\n\nWHAT IS THE ONTOLOGICAL STATUS OF BILINGUALISM?\n\nÍ 31\n\nin language, and with Karcevskij’s stress on the asymmetric dualism of the sign, may be enlisted in the argument that says that there is no such thing as a single language. To see how this might work, consider once again the basic claim we are trying to make. The thesis is that language at its heart is a set of dualistic relationships that can never be reduced to the kind of uniqueness that monolingual ideologues wish to assert when they talk about “language.” If we consider any responsible account of any given language—English or Mohawk, for example—we will find that such a description must contain three elements. It must first of all account for the syntactical features of English or Mohawk. Second, it must describe the phonological system comprising what will be accepted in English or Mohawk as meaningful sounds (phonemes) as opposed to other sounds it will dismiss as nonsense. And third, such an account will have to be able to say something about how sounds get translated into meanings—that is, the semantics of English or Mohawk. At each of these levels, linguistics tells us there is a duality that governs expression. In seeing how deep bilingualism sleeps even in the heart of what appears to be a single language, we will be helped by perceiving syntax, phonology, and semantics as a hierarchical set of possibilities. Jakobson has suggested what seems to be the natural order of language priorities in the following scheme: In the combination of linguistic units, there is an ascending scale of freedom. In the combination of distinctive features into phonemes, the freedom of the individual speaker is zero: The code has already established all the possibilities that may be utilized in the given language. Freedom to combine phonemes into words is circumscribed; it is limited to the marginal situation of word coinage. In forming sentences with words, the speaker is less constrained. And finally, in the combination of sentences into utterances, the action of compulsory syntactical rules ceases, and the freedom of any individual speaker to create novel contexts increases substantially, although again the numerous stereotyped utterances are not to be overlooked. The differing degrees of freedom Jakobson describes here are constrained or permitted according to how closely any of the three aspects of language I listed above are involved in any given utterance. I will note only in passing that in the Jakobsonian tradition, sound is at the root of language; in Chomsky’s system, it is syntax. But in both cases, what is at issue is a primordial ground of language that is defined by its ineluctability. At the deepest levels of language, if we for the moment choose the Jakobsonian model, we are not free\n\n32\n\nÍ\n\nMICHAEL HOLQUIST\n\nto introduce new sounds as conveyers of meaning. If I speak English, I am compelled to use the very limited range of sounds that English has selected, out of all the noises humans can produce with their vocal cords, to be meaningful; all other sounds, the great majority of noises humans can make, will be dismissed as nonmeaningful in forming English words and thus nonsense in the technical sense of that word. The Russian phoneme that the IPA [International Phonetic Alphabet] renders as “y” (û) sounds very strange (and at first, somewhat off-putting) to native speakers of English, much as English short “I” (as in “hit”) sounds quite foreign to Russians, because it is not one of the sounds Russian has selected to convey meanings. Out of all the grunts, groans, squeals, hisses, and other sounds we can produce, we are limited to a very few in any language we speak if we are to speak that language. In describing the null subject parameter above, we effectively described as well the unfreedom that syntax can bring home to the individual speaker: As we saw, in Italian you can say merely “piove,” but in English you must say “it is raining.” The reason there is no choice at these levels is because they are at the borderline between the I-level language and the E-level language, a border very close to the deepest layer, the mysterious realm of Universal Grammar, the body of rules that says if we are to use human language at all (and all healthy humans do), then we are forced to use things that deploy as nouns, others that work as verbs. Furthermore, arbitrary limits will have to be set on the range of sounds that any particular language will recognize as capable of bearing meaning within it. In dealing with these limits, phonologists use the innocent-sounding terms phoneme/allophone: The phoneme for the English sound “a” (as in “hat”) is a kind of Platonic idea of the short “a” English speakers recognize as able to bear meaning (as in other words that use it, such as “cat”). But in spoken speech, no one ever pronounces the perfect essence of the short “a” sound. We always voice an approximation of the phoneme, or an allophone. My pronunciation of “hat” is not exactly like any other pronunciation by any other speaker of English of the same sounds. And yet, other English speakers will be able to recognize my sounds as being close enough to the phoneme “a” that they will understand me. The space between a phoneme and an allophone is the difference between I-level and E-level, daily evidence that there is a gap between the parametric and performed levels of language. So at the sound level of even a “single” language, such as English, there is a split marked by the\n\nWHAT IS THE ONTOLOGICAL STATUS OF BILINGUALISM?\n\nÍ 33\n\ndifference between relatively idiosyncratic noises I utter in my unique voice and the Platonic sounds of the phonemes setting English off from other languages. If we look at any apparently discrete single language (“English” or “Mohawk”) from the perspective of what we now know (or at least suspect with greater certainty) about the nature of language, we can draw several conclusions that have a vital bearing on the topic of this book. In conclusion, I’d like to list some of the more significant of these. A first insight will be that we must turn around some of our basic assumptions about bilingualism. It has widely been assumed that bilingualism is a term that describes a relation between two national languages (Spanish/English, let us say). There is, of course, a difference between a child (or adult) who knows both languages, and another who does not. It is on this crude basis that most schemes for curricular reform in schools, psychological theories of child development, or restrictions in the workplace get started. These attempts to “deal with” or to “use” bilingualism have not borne notable fruit. And they have not because more often than not, their essential premise is based on a fallacy: the mistaken belief that there is such a thing as a unified language that can then be specified as endowed with special qualities (national or magical in some other way). Looking at bilingualism from the perspective of theoretical linguistics makes evident that what appears to monolingualists as a special case (people with two national languages) is, in fact, the norm. Everybody, even the farmer in Kansas who has never left his land and thinks he knows only English, is always already bilingual insofar as he is between the level of phonemes and allophones, the parametric level of syntax in Universal Grammar and the syntax individual speakers actually use. Universal Grammar provides the glue that holds all languages together (there is no language that cannot be translated into any other language). As such, it is a hopeful sign of our commonality. The ultimate irony is that at the same time, Universal Grammar is the certain guarantor of ineluctable variety. Difference is what we have in common. In meditating bilingualism we are very close to the condition in Language that Tolstoy perceived in the center of human existence. As he wrote in the second epilogue to War and Peace, “The problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation from whatever point of view—theological, historical, ethical, or philosophic—we find a general law of necessity to which he (like all that exists) is subject. But regarding him from within ourselves as what we are conscious of, we feel ourselves to be free”(Tolstoy, 1921).\n\n34\n\nÍ\n\nMICHAEL HOLQUIST\n\nWorks Cited Baker, Mark.

Enrique Bernárdez\n\nThe Problem In present-day Spain, bilingualism is a problem in many respects, including literary: Writers can be (and are) sometimes the object of attack due to their linguistic choice. In recent years the public discussion on this issue seems to be slowing down, a welcome development, but the rejection of the non-Castilian Spanish languages in certain areas of the country continues, a rejection that is sometimes genuine and popular but that frequently is the artificial creation of the media and some nonnationalist, right-wing political groups or the opposing hard-core nationalistic groups, whether right or left wing. The first group, of course, rejects bilingualism and defends the exclusive use of Spanish, whereas for the second group Spanish has to be rejected and it is the exclusive use of the vernacular that is the object of their political and cultural struggle, so much so that some people even propounded abandoning the teaching of Spanish at school in favor of English, so that children would be taught Catalan or Basque and English as the second language, whereas Spanish would continue to be acquired naturally (through contact with Spanish speakers, the media, etc.), but no formal instruction in it would be provided. This proposal—which didn’t go beyond the stage of wishful thinking among some nationalist groups, mainly in Catalonia—makes full sense in any independent nation; the degree of independence or self-government is therefore an issue that has not been solved yet. But even if bilingualism has always been there and a serious problem was historically made of it in a recurrent fashion, the situation was made much worse during Franco’s regime. As is well enough known, the exclusive use of Spanish in all public affairs, including education,\n\n36\n\nÍ\n\nENRIQUE BERNÁRDEZ\n\nwas made mandatory. As the rightist groups in Spain are trying to forget as much as possible of the country’s recent history (including the nineteenth century) and a rewriting of earlier historical figures and events is currently underway (although fortunately not on too systematic a basis), much in the spirit of present-day revisionist historywriting, something similar is happening with this issue, so that the linguistic politics of Franco’s regime seems to be in the process of revision, too, so that a speech by King Juan Carlos, obviously written by the government, included a reference to the Spanish language having been voluntarily accepted by many peoples of the world and never imposed on anyone. These words, in addition to offending many people1 and opening a major debate that lasted for several months, were simply false, and unfortunately not only for the period of the Generalissimo’s dictatorship. But let’s leave these more general problems aside for the moment. It is frequently forgotten, however, that Franco’s regime not only opposed the use of the non-Castilian Spanish vernaculars;2 what mattered was that Spanish should be the only language around: Foreign movie pictures had to be dubbed into Spanish, a tradition now so firmly entrenched in the Spanish public that it has lead to the opposing swing of the bilingual pendulum, dubbing in other languages of Spain now being favored instead of, or in addition to, Spanish, although fortunately the times have not made it possible to declare such dubbing legally compulsory and exclusive. Teaching and using foreign languages was also rejected, or at least suspected: In an article published in 1952 in a literary journal published by the Consejo Superior the Investigaciones Científicas,3 José de Entrambasaguas, one of the leading Spanish literary scholars, explained in rich detail how and why learning foreign languages is something that only Jews and other apatrids would do, while it is wholly unnecessary in imperial nations as Spain and England:4 “Casi todos los tontos tienen una veneración supersticiosa por el conocimiento de otros idiomas ajenos al suyo. . . . [L]os judíos, apátridas, incrustados circunstancialmente en tantos países, valoran el poliglotismo tanto como el dinero, su lengua universal.”5 The fact is that until the late 1950s no degrees in foreign languages existed at any Spanish university and the teachers of French, which by then was practically exclusive at the Spanish secondary schools, and later those of other languages (English, German, Italian), had salaries much lower than those earned by teachers of more serious subjects, including Latin and Greek (Lorenzo 10). Some languages entered our universities extremely late, mainly for political reasons, as in the case of Russian; others are simply not there yet.\n\nIS MONOLINGUALISM POSSIBLE?\n\nÍ 37\n\nAll this, even if anecdotal, is important if we want to understand the point of view of many Spaniards (I’d rather avoid saying “most”) in respect to all languages but their own (whether Spanish or any other); to continue with a real but incredible anecdote, my American brother-in-law was walking with his bilingual son in Madrid and talking in English, as they always do. An elderly lady overheard them and exclaimed: ¡Hablen español! (“Speak Spanish!”). This linguistic ideology, one of the many deep and enduring effects of Franco’s fascism, but one that has much deeper and general roots,6 could be described thus: Spain is coextensive with the Spanish language; Spain is pure, Spanish has to be pure; every language other than Spanish is a danger to the essence of Spain. In bilingual areas this ideology is not so dramatic, mainly probably because people there have learned to oppose it in order to protect their own language. But as the old idea “a nation is its language” has historically been extremely pervasive, it is to be expected that some people will simply translate the old ideology into new terms: Nation X is X’s language, et cetera, so that in the worst scenario you can get as far as defending killing to impose the exclusivity of X’s language or, in the far more usual case, trying to avoid the use of any other language, including Spanish, at least in certain areas. So bilingualism in Spain, as elsewhere, is a tricky issue, and while some people abhor it as a menace of language X on language Y, others would rather reject the use of Y in order to give X exclusive rights. For most people in their daily lives, however, bilingualism is either a familiar and constant phenomenon or simply does not exist, so that it is not worthwhile even to talk about it.\n\nThe Officially Multilingual Spain of the Twenty-first Century Nevertheless, the bilingualism issue underwent a dramatic qualitative change with the creation and development of the Estado de las Autonomías, that peculiarly Spanish system of political organization of the territory, neither federalist nor confederalist or whatever, which has given some of the autonomies, notably the Basque countr"
