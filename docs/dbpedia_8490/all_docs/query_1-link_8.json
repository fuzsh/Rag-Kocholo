I recognize their faint absurdity, given the topic of this book.\n\nLITERATURE IN MOTION\n\nINTRODUCTION Translation and Multilingualism in Contemporary American Literature\n\nIn Yuri Herrera’s Señales que precederán al fin del mundo (Signs Preceding the End of the World), from which I have chosen the first epigraph to this book, a young Mexican switchboard operator called Makina crosses the border into the United States hoping to find her brother. Makina is a communicator, an intercessor, a liminal being, and she identifies instantly with the mixture of “anglo” and “homegrown” tongues she hears spoken in the borderlands: a language that is “malleable, erasable, permeable,” constantly pivoting between subtly different versions.1 Like her, it is nebulous, difficult to define, accommodating of contradictions in abundance. And like her, it is in constant movement. This kind of language, and the literary voices that use it, are the subject of this book. Literature in Motion: Translating Multilingualism Across the Americas is part of an ongoing effort to break down a long-held assumption in institutions of literary study and publication: that literature is fundamentally monolingual. This change in perspective has wide-ranging implications, not only for literary pedagogy and the international publishing industry, but, as this book will demonstrate, also for contemporary translation practices. Translation, I want to show, can be multilingual too. The work of a translator, like the language Makina hears in Herrera’s novel, involves constant movement, a repeated pivoting between infinitesimally different versions. In his novel El viajero del siglo (Traveller of the Century), from where I have\n\n2 INTRODUCTION\n\ntaken my second epigraph, Andrés Neuman describes translation as “another contribution, a further push to something that is already in motion.”2 This understanding of translation as movement is not exactly new; it is a commonplace to point out that the word’s Latinate etymology, trans + latus, means “to carry across.” But it is nevertheless an idea to which I will return throughout this study. Movement, I want to show, is something that multilingual writing and translation have in common. Both are fluid, malleable, shifting. One of this book’s main goals is to demonstrate that these two things— multilingual writing and translation—are more similar than is often assumed. Literary multilingualism studies have traditionally focused on the simultaneous presence of multiple languages in a piece of writing, whereas translation studies are concerned with the transfer from one (and it is usually assumed to be just one) language to another. Often, they are described as opposites in this regard. But the readings in this volume demonstrate that it is both arbitrary and unproductive to hold these two literary practices apart from one another. Translation need not—as is often assumed— undermine or eliminate the diversity, complexity, and subversive potential of multilingualism. On the contrary, the two creative practices are closely intertwined, to the extent that translation is always to some extent implied in multilingual writing. Throughout this book, I understand literary translation as a form of creative versioning, and translators as creative writers in their own right. In the chapters that follow, I read translation both in and of the work of contemporary multilingual prose writers, attending to the ways different languages shape their writing practices as well as their reception in an increasingly interconnected global literary marketplace. In so doing, this book argues that, when it comes to multilingual literary production, the boundary between writing and translation is often arbitrary and unhelpful. Moreover, it demonstrates that multilingual writing is not so irreducibly specific to particular geographies and communities that it cannot travel; paying sustained attention to the translation of multilingual writing is one means of considering its status as world literature. The multilingual mixture evoked in Herrera’s novel, often referred to as “Spanglish,” has a long literary history among writers in the United States and is undoubtedly the best studied of literary multilingualisms\n\n3 INTRODUCTION\n\nin the American hemisphere. The interplay between these two major languages—Spanish and English—will make up the better part of the analysis in this book: the first three chapters focus on the writing and translation of three U.S. Latinx authors: Susana Chávez-Silverman, Junot Díaz, and Giannina Braschi.3 However, the oft-maligned “Spanglish” is by no means the only literary multilingualism on the continent, and the final chapter of the book will turn to the work of Brazilian writer Wilson Bueno, whose 1992 novel Mar Paraguayo combines Portuguese and Spanish—or “Portunhol”—with the Indigenous American language Guarani, and to the work of his Canadian translator Erín Moure, who recreates Bueno’s novel in “Frenglish”—French and English. This final chapter helps to shift the study of literary multilingualism off its United States–centered axis, to broaden it out into the American hemisphere, and into other language constellations. Along with the coda that follows, it seeks to show that the strategies and processes underway in U.S. Latinx writing are by no means restricted to one linguistic community. Through these readings, the book offers different ways of thinking about multilingual writing and the role of translation in it, including as a palimpsest, as a form of censorship, and as a queer practice. It charts a number of features that often recur in contemporary multilingual texts, which include a commitment to slow, difficult reading; a debt to oral forms; genre and gender fluidity; reflection on the texts’ own textuality and circulation; and a sense of being unfinished, or “unfinalizable.” In so doing, the book demonstrates that multilingualism and the translational processes it entails are tightly imbricated with other forms of textual and conceptual hybridity, fluidity, and disruption. It also makes clear that these are not minor practices within contemporary American literature; rather, they are crucial to how many writers and translators are engaging with their increasingly globalized, multilingual present. Far from rejecting translation, all of the writers addressed here in fact give translation a crucial role in their textual composition, whether in the form of playful calques (also called loan translations), pseudotranslations (texts that pretend to be translations), surface translations (where the sounds of one language are translated into the words of another, regardless of the sense they make), or metanarrative devices that anticipate and invite future translation. Translation of their published works for publication in new\n\n4 INTRODUCTION\n\nterritories therefore offers a natural creative supplement to processes already underway, one which allows these works to travel beyond their place(s) of inception and to make new connections. Rather than judging the success of these translations, or their degree of fidelity to a source, I examine how they contribute creatively to the work as a whole, which is understood to be a still-evolving entity. Throughout this book I will use the term “Spanglish” to refer to writing by Díaz, Chávez-Silverman, and Braschi. Although a conflicted term, it remains a useful, widely recognizable shorthand. It is used in the marketing of Braschi’s Yo-Yo Boing! and of Chávez-Silverman’s books (University of Wisconsin Press describes her writing as an “inventive and flamboyant use of Spanglish”),4 and reviewers and critics often characterize Junot Díaz’s writing as “Spanglish,” too.5 All three writers have used the term to talk publicly about their own work, although studying each of them in isolation would undoubtedly lead to three very different definitions of the term. Chávez-Silverman’s confident, sustained use of intra-sentential codeswitching and highly wrought puns are quite distinct from the anxious inter-sentential code-switching of Braschi’s characters, whose English shows signs of ongoing language acquisition.6 Meanwhile, Díaz uses English much more extensively than either of the two women writers, but it is a “creolized” English, as I argue in chapter 2, structured in part by the syntax and lexis of Spanish. I prefer to think of the term in its plural form: “Spanglishes,” in order to emphasize the heterogeneity of language used by these three writers, as well as its continuing motion and evolution as it manifests for each of them in multiple textual versions. “Portunhol” or “Portuñol” and especially “Frenglish” have less currency than “Spanglish,” but I have nevertheless followed the writers themselves in adopting the terms in my readings of their work. Although each of these portmanteau words suggests a too-easy fusion of supposedly sovereign linguistic systems, the chapters of this book discuss at length the idiomatic diversity and structural permeability within each of those systems, and the myriad ways in which each of them manifests in contemporary American literature. At this juncture I want to take a brief look at each of them in turn. I will begin with the term “Spanglish,” which is worth discussing at some length, given that it can be applied to the bulk of the literary work to be examined in this book.\n\n5 INTRODUCTION\n\n“SPANGLISH” AND THE U.S. ENGLISH PARADIGM\n\nFirst of all, it is important to set the scene here by establishing the norm from which “Spanglish” writing departs. In particular, it is worth outlining the distinct valences of English-language monolingualism, particularly in the United States, where three of the four writers addressed in the chapters of this book are based. A brief survey of recent attitudes toward language there is particularly helpful at the outset of this section. The 1980s saw the rise of U.S. English and English First, two organizations that sought to establish English as the official language of the U.S. government, on the basis that a common language has an important role in establishing political unity.7 Although English has long been the de facto national language in the United States, used for legislation, regulations, treaties, and court rulings, historically, unlike many other nation-states, the United States has never had an official language at the federal level. Support for these organizations continued to grow throughout the 1990s, prompted by anti-immigration sentiment directed in particular at newcomers from the country’s Spanish-speaking neighbors: mainly Mexico, but also Cuba, the Free Associated State of Puerto Rico, and other parts of Central and South America.8 Meanwhile monolingualism was further entrenched by a complacent assumption that there was little need to equip the nation with fluent speakers of other languages, because the unprecedented global influence of English meant that others would take on the burden of language learning instead. Brian Lennon points to an Anglophone “flourishing” in the years after the Cold War, between “the vanishing of the old Russian-speaking adversary and the emergence of a new Arabic-speaking one,” during which time a survey by the Modern Language Association shows that enrolment in foreign-language instruction declined.9 However, the events of September 11, 2001, were a wake-up call that this complacency had been a serious misjudgment. During the United States’ occupation of Iraq, its history of Anglocentrism posed a very real political danger, as a dearth of Arabic translators meant that military and intelligence officials were forced to rely on machine translation to convey sensitive information. In the introduction to her book The Translation Zone, written during the early part of the conflict in Iraq, Emily Apter characterizes geopolitical relations during the period as being afflicted by failures of\n\n6 INTRODUCTION\n\nunderstanding at every level, pointing out that translation can be a matter of war and peace.10 A policy of strict English monolingualism, it became clear, can have serious national security implications. According to Brecht and Rivers, the United States’ need for individuals with highly developed competency in languages other than English for use in social economic, diplomatic, and geopolitical arenas had never been higher than in the years following the 9/11 attacks; more than seventy government agencies reported a need for such individuals, where shortages had “adversely affected agency operations and hindered U.S. military, law enforcement, intelligence, counter terrorism, and diplomatic efforts.”11 Around the turn of the century, there was an acknowledgment that the pervasiveness of Anglophone monolingualism was “a serious deficit of educational, economic, and military resources” in the United States, and there was a subsequent revival of support for modern-languages teaching, on the basis that those who speak more than one language are not only intellectual but also political assets.12 Arabic language teaching and learning in particular drew sudden attention from both the educational community and the federal and local governments, with enrolments in Arabic courses showing rapid growth.13 During these years, there was also an intensification of calls within humanities scholarship to understand multilingualism and language acquisition as having equally important roles in national cultural intelligence; as Mary Louise Pratt pointed out in 2003, “language is far too big an issue to be contained by national security issues alone.”14 These years saw a growth in literary scholarship re-evaluating the importance of translation and multilingualism to U.S. literary history and demonstrating the inadequacy of English to tell the stories of U.S. citizens and residents.15 Werner Sollors in particular, in his edited collection Multilingual America, advocated “English plus other languages” and called for a major re-examination of U.S. literary history in the light of multilingualism. Part of a larger project launched at Harvard University by Sollors and Marc Shell, which promoted research on, and the republication of, U.S. literature in languages other than English, Sollors’s book is an effort to readjust the national self-imagining in ways that acknowledge the United States to be, and, importantly, to always have been, multilingual.16 It makes the case that an “English plus” educational policy would both “prepare children for the twenty-first century and preserve the American tradition.”17 Doris Sommer’s 2004 book Bilingual Aesthetics also argues for the development of a language and\n\n7 INTRODUCTION\n\nliterature pedagogy that encourages students to value rather than be ashamed of an aesthetic that results from knowledge of more than one language. Sommer makes the case that society is distinctly better off for being multicultural and multilingual, in ways that go beyond economic and security advantages; she advocates the aesthetic and intellectual stimulation provided by multiple languages, and, in particular, the “democratizing effects of provocation” afforded by “foreignness” or cultural and linguistic difference.18 Despite these trends, and despite the relative quiescence of the Englishonly movement in the 2000s, in 2021 there is a residual, even resurgent Anglocentrism in the United States. Former president Trump’s attitudes toward Spanish indicate a measure of retrenchment when it comes to language politics. On the campaign trail, the “nefariously monolingual” Trump resisted buying any Spanish-language television or radio airtime, asserted that immigrants should speak English, not Spanish, and criticized Jeb Bush for speaking Spanish at a rally.19 In addition to the Trump administration attempting to clamp down on migration and tighten the conditions of citizenship so that it is more difficult for non-English speakers to remain in the United States, the Spanish-language pages of the White House website were removed on Trump’s first day in office, not to be restored until Joe Biden was sworn in in January 2021. In the United States, English remains overwhelmingly the language of education and public life, as well as, of course, publishing. Outside of the United States, English has an important role as a global lingua franca, including in bureaucracy, development, international relations, and big business. In the publishing world, too, it has a corresponding central role in the canon of world literature; Francesca Orsini has shown world literature to be overwhelmingly Anglo-American, while Tim Parks memorably describes it as “dull,” in the sense of being excessively homogenous in an attempt to be easily saleable around the world, whether in translation or for an international English readership.20 Perhaps the most enduring definition of world literature is indisputably monolingual: David Damrosch calls world literature works that “circulate beyond their culture of origin, either in translation or in their original language.”21 As this book will extensively demonstrate, this definition is seriously lacking; it is by no means always possible to assume that a text has either a single “original language” or a single “culture of origin.” This United States–dominated,\n\n8 INTRODUCTION\n\nmonolingual English literary paradigm is what the writers in the first three chapters of this book are struggling against. Latinx writers have long resisted English’s status as the singular language of value in the United States (and beyond) by registering the presence of Spanish in their writing in both overt and covert ways. Overt uses include its appearance in characters’ speech; take this example from Chicano writer Américo Paredes’s 1930s novel George Washington Gómez, for instance, where readers are told that “an old woman appeared at the threshold screaming angrily at the doctor, ‘Viejo cabrón! Pendejo! Ándale!’” (You old asshole! Idiot! Get a move on!).22 Covert uses, on the other hand, include the appearance of calques—literal translations of idioms and proverbs—such as, again in George Washington Gómez, the exclamation “Mother of mine!” (translated from “Madre mía!”), and the idiom “love from a distance, the love of fools” (translated from the rhyming “amor de lejos, amor de pendejos”).23 These strategies result in the text being read differently by different readers; those who have knowledge of Spanish may feel gratified and included, while those who do not are alienated, because the language of the text is strange or difficult to them. Paredes’s Spanish is, nevertheless, vastly outweighed by the presence of English in his novel, as it has historically been in much Latinx writing. What is more, Spanish words and phrases are often “cushioned,” as Lourdes Torres puts it, making them easily understood by nonspeakers of Spanish.24 For instance, they are often restricted to internationally recognizable items like food and drink (tortilla, taco) or family relationships (mamá, papá), or to exclamations and expletives, as in the example above (“Viejo cabrón! Pendejo! Ándale!”), where the precise meaning of the words is less important than a sense that they are expressed with vehemence, which is sufficiently evident from the punctuation alone.25 In other instances, Spanish words are explained and translated into English (“ ‘Tiene usted razón, Hermano,’ he said. ‘You are right, Brother.’ ”).26 This type of glossing can, as Bill Ashcroft, Gareth Griffiths, and Helen Tiffin put it, “impede the movement of plot as the story is forced to drag an explanatory machinery behind it,” and is likely to alienate those readers who do have a passing familiarity with Spanish and so must endure redundant repetition.27 Since the 1930s, when Paredes was writing, Spanish has come to be mobilized more frequently and more boldly by Chicanxs as a way of validating their experiences in response to the political and cultural exclusions they\n\n9 INTRODUCTION\n\nhave long endured in the United States. The Chicanx movement of the 1960s and 1970s saw new university-level courses established across the United States specifically to attend to the cultures and histories of Latinx communities; it was then that “Spanglish” first gained real prominence as a literary style.28 Many Chicanx writers, including Sandra Cisneros, Ana Castillo, and Rolando Hinojosa, joined Paredes in using Spanish to emphasize themes of identity and marginalization, and as a form of resistance against the dominance of Anglo-American culture. Particularly important is the work of writer and activist Gloria Anzaldúa, a sixth-generation Chicana, born in 1942 close to the border with Mexico. In her Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza (1987), which played a key role in consolidating the academic study of the United States–Mexico border region, she mixes English and Spanish in much more extensive and sustained ways than Paredes does in George Washington Gómez. In the preface to the first edition, she asks to be “met halfway”—for readers to engage with all of the text’s linguistic demands rather than to rely on translation into English.29 A key chapter called “How to Tame a Wild Tongue” describes the stigma attached to Chicanx speech, and the concomitant shame it provokes in those who use it. Anzaldúa recalls, for instance, being physically punished for speaking Spanish at school, and being made to take speech classes at university to purge her English of its Mexican accent. Chicanxs, she notes, have also “internalized the belief that we speak poor Spanish. It is illegitimate, a bastard language.”30 Seeking to counter this perception, Anzaldúa argues that Chicanx Spanish is “not incorrect, it is a living language . . . a language with terms that are neither español ni inglés [Spanish nor English], but both.”31 She identifies “Tex-Mex” or “Spanglish,” whereby she switches “back and forth from English to Spanish in the same sentence or in the same word,” as the language that “comes most naturally” to her.32 The term “Spanglish” dates as far back as 1933 and usually describes speech in casual or oral registers that combines English and Spanish; for Anzaldúa it is the language she uses with those she knows best: her brother and sister, and her “Chicano tejano” (Texan) contemporaries.33 As she explains, “Spanglish” has long been a derogatory term, used to imply a lesser, impure language variety. Acosta-Belén observes that “speakers of the non-defined mixture of Spanish and/or English are judged as ‘different,’ or ‘sloppy’ speakers of Spanish and/or English, and are often labeled verbally deprived, alingual, or deficient bilinguals because supposedly they do not\n\n10 INTRODUCTION\n\nhave the ability to speak either English or Spanish well.”34 The mixing of English and Spanish in this way is sometimes assumed to be the result of insufficient education, as it is by literary critic Roberto González Echevarría, who, writing in the New York Times, suggested that “Spanglish” is mainly used by Latinxs of low socioeconomic status who are illiterate in both languages. For this reason he believes it to be “un grave peligro a la cultura hispánica y al progreso de los hispanos dentro de la corriente mayoritaria norteamericana” (a grave danger to Hispanic culture and to the progress of Hispanics within mainstream North American culture), which “indica marginalización, no liberación” (indicates marginalization, not liberation).35 This association of “Spanglish” with poor language competence is borne out in more recent definitions of the term written by members of the public on the crowd-sourced online site Urban Dictionary, where it is described, to take just one example, as “a hodgepodge of sounds made by people who haven’t learned the basics of either Spanish or English.”36 Due to this pervasive public perception, linguists often reject the term “Spanglish”; John Lipski has called it “as out of place in promoting Latino language and culture as are the words crazy, lunatic, crackpot, or nut case in mental health care, or bum, slob, misfit, and loser in social work.”37 Yet Anzaldúa boldly asserts her right to use it, stating: “Until I am free to write bilingually and to switch codes without having always to translate, while I still have to speak English or Spanish when I would rather speak Spanglish, and as long as I have to accommodate the English speakers rather than having them accommodate me, my tongue will be illegitimate.”38 “Spanglish” is one way for Anzaldúa to express herself as “a composite being, amalgama de culturas y de lenguas” (amalgam of cultures and languages); but she also writes certain essays and poems in just English, or in just Spanish, and often incorporates words from Nahuatl, too, as a marker of her Indigenous heritage.39 She claims many identity positions, all of which, she argues, are overlapping and mutually informing. Throughout Borderlands/La Frontera, the border between the United States and Mexico is established as a metaphor for all types of boundaries and crossings—not just between geographical territories and languages, but also between sexual identities, cultures, ethnicities, and social classes. These crossings are mirrored in the very structure of the book itself, which is ambiguous in terms of genre: the first section is made up of essays that draw on personal experience and Chicanx history, while the second section comprises poems; however, the essays\n\n11 INTRODUCTION\n\nincorporate quotations from poetry, and many of the poems give brutal historical accounts, blurring the boundaries between these two forms. A closer look at “To live in the Borderlands means you,” a poem appearing toward the end of Borderlands/La Frontera, demonstrates how “Spanglish” is used to express many of the key aspects of Anzaldúa’s border thinking: Cuando vives en la frontera people walk through you, the wind steals your voice, you’re a burra, buey, scapegoat, forerunner of a new race, half and half—both woman and man, neither— a new gender.40\n\nLiving in the borderlands denotes much more than being physically between two nation-states. It implies subjection to multiple forms of oppression, including those associated with language, race, class, and sexuality. It can reduce a person, in the eyes of others, to the status of a dumb animal (“burra, buey” [she-donkey, ox]), rendering them invisible and silent, their body insubstantial as a ghost, their voice “stolen.” Anzaldúa argues in Borderlands that different types of marginalization should not be ranked, nor understood to be static, but rather seen as fluid systems that intersect and can take on different forms. She was one of the first Chicanas to publicly claim her lesbianism and to overtly challenge the exclusions of white feminism, insisting instead on the specificity of the multiple prejudices experienced by queer women of color. But there is also hope in these lines: promising “a new race” and “a new gender,” they embrace the utopian potential of Anzaldúa’s hybrid “new mestiza consciousness.” We can see in this poem, and across Borderlands more widely, a bold claim for the legitimacy of Chicanx experiences, including their speech. There is pride, as well as anger, here, in existing at the crossroads of so many marginalized identity positions. Anzaldúa’s work has been taken up widely in the academy in fields as varied as postcolonial studies, queer studies, and political science, and she remains a powerful figure in the study of Latinx literary bilingualism. We can see the legacy of her intersectional thinking in the work of Braschi and Chávez-Silverman, who explore, for instance, the relationship of “Spanglish” to queerness (see chapters 1 and 3) and reflect on the privileges\n\n12 INTRODUCTION\n\nthat accompany membership of a scholarly elite (see chapter 1). However, as I will go on to show, these writers not only replicate but also extend Anzaldúa’s strategies of literary multilingualism, demanding more of their readers and engaging more committedly with the exoticization of Latinx identity. We must remember that Chicanxs, of course, are not the only U.S. writers to have used “Spanglish.” The Latinx population of the United States grew by 61 percent between 1970 and 1980, and then again by 53 percent during the following decade, over seven times as fast as the rest of the nation.41 Many immigrant writers joined Chicanxs in experimenting with a mixture of English and Spanish in their writing, including Dominican Americans like Julia Álvarez and Junot Díaz (whose writing I discuss in chapter 2), and Cuban Americans like Oscar Hijuelos, Cristina García, and Achy Obejas (whose translation work I also examine in chapter 2). The largest population of Latinxs in the United States—after those of Mexican origin, who make up over half—is Puerto Rican. Following a large postwar wave of immigration, particularly to New York, “Nuyoricans” began to use “Spanglish” in their writing as a form of resistance to their marginalization from mainstream Anglophone culture, and as a way of distinguishing themselves from the culture of Puerto Rico itself.42 Centering on the slam poetry competitions hosted by the Nuyorican Poets Café, Nuyorican literature came to be characterized by oral, bilingual forms used in everyday speech. In an anthology of poetry performed at the café, editor Miguel Algarín described “Spanglish” as “a new language, a new tradition of communication” taking center stage in an emerging poetics of Puerto Rican diaspora.43 Despite the term’s frequently derogatory use, many Nuyoricans and Boricuas (a popular term of self-affirmation in the diaspora, deriving from Borikén, the Taíno word for the island now called Puerto Rico) have claimed “Spanglish” as a positive badge of bicultural identity. For instance, in Living in Spanglish, journalist Ed Morales sees “Spanglish” as not just a language but also a powerful new cultural identity and an act of resistance against AngloAmerican cultural dominance.44 The critic Ana Celia Zentella, too, has rebutted the argument against “Spanglish,” claiming that the word can be given a more positive meaning, rescued by semantic inversion in a similar way to previously derogatory words like queer and Chicano.45 Giannina Braschi, whose novel Yo-Yo Boing! I discuss in chapter 3, claims three writing languages, “Spanish, Spanglish, and English,” on the jacket of her books,\n\n13 INTRODUCTION\n\n“to explore the three political options of Puerto Rico—nation, colony, or state.”46 As the Latinx population of the United States has continued to increase (the most recent census data indicates that it has now topped fifty-five million, forty million of whom report speaking Spanish at home), it has become convention for Latinx writers of all kinds to combine English and Spanish in some way.47 As a result, some have accused them of turning texts into cultural tour guides aimed predominantly at Anglo-American readers. Gustavo Pérez Firmat is among those to point out that in much Latinx writing Spanish is used merely to “bait” readers “with the lure of the exotic,” promising safe access via English to a generalized and alluring “latinidad.”48 It is unsurprising that English predominates in Latinx writing, as it does for instance in George Washington Gómez, since most writers in the United States have been formally educated in English, and the publishing marketplace there is predominantly Anglophone. But Latinx writers have often written conspicuously for a non-Latinx, English-dominant readership, developing strategies of bilingualism designed for the many non-Spanishspeaking readers who will encounter them. Often, the specific meaning of a Spanish word in a narrative is less important than its ability to signal a vague and unproblematized “latinidad.” While historically the idea of a shared pan-Latin American ethnicity has enabled Latin Americans to define themselves against both Spanish colonialism and U.S. imperialism,49 it also risks erasing the considerable differences between the experiences of, say, a Cuban exile in Miami, a Puerto Rican moving between New York and San Juan, a Salvadoran who fled the civil war, and a Chicanx with a longstanding cultural claim to territory in the Southwest (known as Aztlán). The global influence of Anglophone culture shapes even the way Anzaldúa accommodates her readers, despite her plea to be “met halfway” when it comes to language. In Borderlands/La Frontera, Spanish words appear in italics, marking them as foreign, even in instances where an entire poem is composed exclusively in Spanish; meanwhile, all the English is romanized. In the chapters and passages that combine both languages, Spanish words sometimes appear in glossaries at the bottom of the page, as they do in “To live in the Borderlands means you,” the poem discussed above, where readers are told that the words “burra” and “buey” correspond to “donkey” and “oxen.”50 Marlene Hansen Esplin has shown at length how Anzaldúa “compensates for potential unknowns in Spanish by explaining\n\n14 INTRODUCTION\n\nmore in English,” thus figuring Spanish as “an Other language marked by italics and accounted for by parentheses, footnotes, repetition, context, or other strategies of translation.”51 Graham Huggan has called this phenomenon “strategic exoticism” or “staged marginality,” whereby a writer’s marginal status is commodified for mainstream readers.52 It is an aspect of their publishing that Latinx authors have begun to expect and to consciously interact with, in order to reconfigure stereotypical notions of “latinidad” both in their writing itself and in the public presentation of their work.53 The Latinx writers addressed in this book, for instance, acknowledge the exoticizing potential of their own work, which is by no means a straightforward capitulation to the dominance of Anglo-American culture. ChávezSilverman, Díaz, and Braschi engage and interact with the expectation that their “latinidad” will be marketed as a commodity to non-Latinx readers, and so comment in complex and knowing ways on their own marginality.54 Part of the work of this book is to demonstrate how these three Latinx writers break down and subvert long-standing conventions regarding the use of “Spanglish” in published writing. They do it in ways that differ from those of perhaps the most enthusiastic advocate of “Spanglish”: Ilan Stavans, a Latinx studies scholar who has positioned himself as the public face of the discipline. Stavans has made many efforts to establish a Latinx literary canon based on the mixing of Spanish and English and has attempted to legitimize and codify “Spanglish” as a literary language. However, while he has undoubtedly helped popularize the term, his uses of written “Spanglish” have not always been well received. As Rachael Gilmour and Tamar Steinitz note in their introduction to a recent collection of essays, multilingualism can “serve dominant visions of the nation-state, or cosmopolitanism, or the effects of global cultural exchange” as well as “unsettle them profoundly.”55 Stavans’s attempts to prove the flexibility and depth of “Spanglish” as a literary language by translating into it extracts from canonical works like Don Quixote have been criticized for reinforcing the notion that only uneducated people speak “Spanglish,”56 and for the conservative, colonialist underpinnings of the version of “latinidad” they champion.57 It is worth pointing out at this stage that writing in “Spanglish” is not the only means of disrupting the hegemony of U.S. English in literature. For instance, the decision to alternate between publishing in Spanish and in English, thus withholding certain works from monolingual English\n\n15 INTRODUCTION\n\nreaders, is transgressive in a quite different way. Peruvian American Daniel Alarcón, for instance, writes extensively in English, but has also chosen to publish a book of short stories, El rey siempre está por encima del pueblo, in Spanish.58 Mexican-born Valeria Luiselli has written both fiction and nonfiction in both English and Spanish, while the Puerto Rican poet Raquel Salas Rivera has published collections in both languages, and in bilingual editions with facing translations. Self-translation, too, has its place in efforts to resist the English paradigm, as of course does the decision to write exclusively in Spanish for Latin Americans and the Spanishspeaking public in the United States.59 Meanwhile, it should be clear that the decision to publish in “Spanglish” in, say, Mexico—where monolingualism in Spanish (another global lingua franca with a very different imperial history) is assumed but English remains a language of prestige—has a very different valence to publishing in the United States.60 While it is important to acknowledge that multilingual writing is not the only means Latinx writers have of resisting the cultural dominance of English there, an in-depth discussion of other disruptive action is beyond the scope of this book, which is concerned specifically, as the title suggests, with the relationship between multilingual writing and multilingual translation rather than with attempts to overcome the monolingual paradigm in general. As will be clear from this discussion, bilingual writing in Spanish and English has been largely studied as a U.S. phenomenon, and much of it is bound up with particular social and cultural histories of that region. This book, however, is committed to thinking about how translation allows “Spanglishes” to circulate more globally, in territories beyond the United States. I begin this in chapter 1, by suggesting that translation into just English allows Chávez-Silverman’s writing to be read beyond the U.S. academy, then continue it in chapter 2 with my discussion of Achy Obejas’s Spanish translation of Díaz’s The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, and in chapter 3 with my discussion of O’Dwyer’s English translation of Yo-Yo Boing!. Moreover, given the critical mass and overall influence of U.S. cultural institutions, an American-inflected take on literary multilingualism and on world literature more broadly is becoming hegemonic. By broadening the conversation out from “Spanglish” to discuss the work of Wilson Bueno and Erín Moure, this study attempts to shift that center and remind readers that literary multilingualism is by no means the preserve of the U.S. Latinx population.\n\n16 INTRODUCTION\n\n“PORTUNHOL”\n\n“Portunhol” or “Portuñol” is neither as commonly used in literary circles nor as widely studied and documented as “Spanglish,” in part due to the dominance of the United States in international scholarship, but it remains useful in the discussion of Wilson Bueno’s Mar Paraguayo, which I examine in chapter 4 of this book. Both spellings have currency, reflecting Spanish and Portuguese orthographic conventions respectively; I use “Portunhol” in this book, following Bueno. Like “Spanglish,” “Portunhol” is used to describe a wide range of linguistic phenomena, especially in border regions between Brazil and its neighboring Spanish-speaking territories.61 It is, like “Spanglish,” often said to be undesirable, “the result of laziness, indifference, or lack of respect for the other language and its speakers.”62 Language schools in the region suggest it is the result of ignorance and lack of application, to be remedied by formal language study.63 In Brazil, where Mar Paraguayo was published, the majority of inhabitants are monolingual in Portuguese, the colonial language, but the country’s vision of itself as a linguistically homogenous giant is belied by the 170 surviving Indigenous languages, of which Guarani is one of the more robust. After years of linguistic suppression and language unification, including the prohibition of teaching in any other language, Portuguese is widely used as a lingua franca across Brazil’s vast territory.64 Meanwhile, across the border in Paraguay, Spanish is the de facto language of government and the primary official language, although nearly 90 percent of the largely nonIndigenous population also speaks Guarani.65 So, although within Brazil Portuguese is undoubtedly the norm, it does not hold anything like the same prestige internationally as English does, and thus the power dynamics at play in “Portunhol” are quite different to those of “Spanglish” used in the border region between the United States and Mexico, or in the Puerto Rican diaspora. As I have already shown, historically, much “Spanglish” literature has subordinated Spanish to English, with which readers are assumed to be comfortable and familiar. English is usually dominant both in terms of quantity and in the extent to which Spanish is translated and explained. This is not consistently the case, however, with either Spanish or Portuguese in “Portunhol” literature. What is more, while Spanish and English are mutually unintelligible, typologically distinct languages (with Romantic and Germanic roots, respectively), Portuguese and Spanish are,\n\n17 INTRODUCTION\n\non the contrary, highly cognate. They have almost identical syntactic structures, as well as overlapping lexicons, which results in combinations that are qualitatively and quantitatively different from literary combinations of English and Spanish. The enormous similarity between Portuguese and Spanish makes very rapid intersentential code-switching possible, but due to a high proportion of ambiguous elements (that is, elements that are identical in Spanish and Portuguese), separating out the two languages becomes a near impossibility in many cases. John Lipski has demonstrated the difficulty of establishing a “base” or “matrix” language (one language that consistently contributes more words or dictates the order in which they appear) for many “Portunhol” utterances, arguing instead that the combination often produces a “single macro-grammar,” as is the case in Bueno’s Mar Paraguayo.66 There is an emergent literature that identifies itself as being written in “Portunhol,” although it is not nearly as established as that of “Spanglish.” There is, for instance, a reasonably well-documented “Portunhol” literary tradition from the Uruguay-Brazil border; María Jesús Fernández García has discussed the use of border language in dialogue in short stories by Uruguayan writer Saúl Ibargoyen, for example.67 Many of the same hybrid strategies seen in Bueno’s Mar Paraguayo can also be found in a series of humorous Brazilian comic books called Los 3 amigos, such as the spelling of Spanish-derived words with the grapheme on the assumption that it will be pronounced with the Brazilian Portuguese velar fricative [x]: writing “rruntar” instead of “juntar,” for instance, or “rodidos” instead of “jodidos.” Similarly, reliance on Brazilian Portuguese pronunciation of the grapheme is used to achieve the Río de la Plata pronunciation of as [ä]: writing “mijones” instead of “millones,” for instance, and “mijares” instead of “millares.” This transcription of words according to the orthographic rules of Portuguese in order to represent the phonetics of Spanish has the effect of alienating some readers and gratifying others, depending on their knowledge of pronunciation rules in certain parts of the Hispanophone world. There is a prevailing sense that “Portunhol” as a phenomenon remains in its infancy, but that it will continue to grow and develop not only in speech and on the internet, but also in literature. Jesús Fernández García calls it “un producto de futuro, sobre todo en el área de MERCOSUR [the South American trade bloc made up of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and\n\n18 INTRODUCTION\n\nParaguay], cuya evolución hoy sólo podemos vislumbrar en la incipiente eclosión de manifestaciones artísticas que reivindican la frontera como seña de identidad”68 (a product of the future, especially in the MERCOSUR area, whose evolution today we can only glimpse in the fledgling blossoming of artistic expression that defends the border as a marker of identity). This is evident from the recent work of the poet Douglas Diegues, who claims to have been directly inspired by Bueno’s Mar Paraguayo.69 Diegues is perhaps today’s most vocal advocate of literary “Portunhol.” Hailing from the border town of Ponta Porã in Brazil’s Paraná state, he published a book of sonnets in 2002 called Dá gusto andar desnudo por estas selvas: Sonetos salvajes, written in what he calls “portunhol selvagem,” a denomination best explained in his 2008 “Karta manifesto del amor amor em portunhol selvagem” (Manifesto letter of love love in portunhol selvagem). In this “Karta,” Diegues paid homage to a savage, rough, or wild mixture of (mainly) Portuguese and Spanish. However, this mixture will make room for any other language too, particularly the Indigenous language Guarani, which is an official language of Paraguay, alongside Spanish.70 Diegues’s open letter was addressed to the then presidents of Paraguay and Brazil, Fernando Lugo and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, imploring them to “QUEMAR EL CONTRATO VIGENTE DE LA ITAIPÚ BINACIONAL” (burn the current Itaipú binational contract), the treaty governing the Itaipú dam on the Paraná river, just north of the Iguazú Falls. The letter argues that the existing contract has long hindered cultural and economic relations between the two countries, and asks that a new, fairer, mutually beneficial contract be written in “portunhol selvagem,” “la lengua mais hermoza de la triple frontera pues que nel portunhol selvagem cabem todas las lenguas del Brasil y del Paraguay (incluso las ameríndias) y todas las lenguas del mundo” (the most beautiful language of the triple border, because portunhol selvagem fits inside it all the languages of Brazil and Paraguay [including the Amerindian ones] and all the languages of the world).71 This “triple frontera” describes the region near the Itaipú dam where Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay meet. There, three national cultures come into additional contact with all the other cultures that tourism and commerce bring to the region, adding new languages to the existing mix of Spanish, Portuguese, and Guarani. The letter was signed by poets and artists from Brazil and Paraguay as well as from Argentina and Portugal.\n\n19 INTRODUCTION\n\nDiegues’s idea of a capacious, democratic, border-crossing literary language that will facilitate international cooperation has proved attractive and has since been adopted by or applied to a number of other writers.72 It has been described as uma língua mestiça, híbrida, nascida espontaneamente do convívio entre falantes do português e do espanhol, que não se deixa domar por regras gramaticais nem se limita a um léxico estruturado. Caracteriza-se pela oscilação entre o português e o espanhol, mantendo-se permanentemente aberta, sem estruturar-se segundo um código previamente estabelecido. Não se pretende uma língua à parte e se reinventa a cada dia.73 (a mixed, hybrid language, born spontaneously from the cohabitation of Portuguese and Spanish speakers, one that is not governed by grammatical rules or limited by a structured vocabulary. It is characterized by the oscillation between Portuguese and Spanish, remaining permanently open, without being structured according to a previously established code. It does not pretend to be a language apart and reinvents itself every day).\n\nIn its emphasis on spontaneity and constant change, and its disregard for standardized grammar, this description is highly reminiscent of the Spanglishes used in the work of Chávez-Silverman, Díaz, and Braschi, particularly the “creolized English” of Díaz’s Oscar Wao, which I discuss in chapter 2.74 Chapter 4, moreover, will demonstrate how the above description can be applied to Bueno, whose use of language in Mar Paraguayo is similarly unruly and unsystematic, incorporating a large amount of vocabulary from Guarani—more contentious still than the combination of Spanish and Portuguese, given the history of Indigenous language suppression in Brazil—as well as occasionally from Italian, French, and English, in addition to its two main languages. “Portunhol selvagem” can be understood as a symbol of international cooperation and exchange, and of the importance of Indigenous culture in the region. It has special significance today, given the new politics of isolationism and nationalism in Brazil, whose far right president Jair Bolsonaro recently faulted Indigenous peoples for not speaking “our language,” Portuguese: “Os índios não falam nossa língua. . . . Como eles conseguem\n\n20 INTRODUCTION\n\nter 13% do território nacional” (The Indians do not speak our language. . . . How did they manage to get 13 percent of the national territory).75 Bueno’s Mar Paraguayo remains a foundational work of “portunhol selvagem,” which Diegues continues to hold up as an inspiration for his own writing; it is by far the most sustained and extensive literary use of “portunhol” currently in circulation. Therefore, I retain the term in my discussion of the book in chapter 4. “FRENGLISH”\n\nFinally, I want to turn to the linguistic mixture that Erín Moure calls “Frenglish” in her 2017 translation of Bueno’s Paraguayan Sea. The term “Frenglish” is very little used; “Franglais” is more common, a coinage popularized by the French writer René Etiemble in his 1964 volume Parlez-vous franglais?, in which he condemned the spread of Anglo culture and language.76 The idea that French might be influenced by or mixed with English continues to be officially deplored in France, as Philip Thody’s book Le Franglais: Forbidden English, Forbidden American has shown.77 Elsewhere in the Francophone/Anglophone world, however, the picture is different. The choice to identify her writing as “Frenglish” (rather than “Franglais”) allows Moure to distance herself from the French context and mark her hybrid French-English prose as specifically Canadian, and even more specifically Quebecois. Moure’s hometown of Montreal is unusual among the world’s bilingual regions because of the ambiguous relationship between Canada’s two official languages. Many multilingual regions with colonial histories are home to one prestigious European language as well as other “local,” lower-prestige languages, with native speakers of the latter often required to learn the former in order to participate in business or increase their social status (as is the case, for instance, in the United States and Brazil). In Montreal, however, the situation is different. Canada is officially bilingual in English and French; meanwhile, the state of Quebec is officially unilingual in French. This means that while French may be marginalized within the country as a whole, it is the dominant language of prestige in Quebecois cities like Montreal. (It is important to note that, as languages with colonial histories, both French and English remain “foreign” in terms of First Nation cultures; and that several Indigenous languages are official in Canadian\n\n21 INTRODUCTION\n\nstates other than Quebec.) French’s status has been bolstered in the region by an exodus of English speakers to predominantly Anglophone parts of Canada and by language policies that aimed to promote French in public spaces and develop a distinct Francophone national identity.78 Montreal remains the area where knowledge of both official languages is highest: census data shows that in 2016, the English-French bilingualism rate in Canada reached the highest proportion ever at 17.9 percent, with most of the growth of the bilingual population attributable to Quebec.79 Although “Frenglish” might not be a term adopted with any regularity by Canadian writers or linguists, in her translation of Bueno’s Mar Paraguayo, Moure is evidently working in the tradition of avant-garde bilingual Canadian writers who experiment with translation and with the mixing of English and French in their prose. A prominent example is Nicole Brossard, some of whose work Moure has translated.80 Brossard’s 1982 novel Picture Theory uses English words in her French text, moving “across languages in its efforts to destabilize identity and meaning,” as translator Barbara Godard explains in her preface to the English version, which bears the same title.81 Godard’s translation is itself bilingual; she takes special care over her use of language, because “the meaning of English in a Quebec text and of French in an English text differ greatly in light of the politics of language in Canada.”82 For instance, she uses boldface to indicate the passages that Brossard wrote in English, and introduces French into her translation in order to replicate Brossard’s language mixing. This dialogue between languages is identifiable throughout Brossard’s career: in 1979, for instance, she edited, in both French and English, an anthology of avant-garde Canadian writing, Les stratégies du réel, in which English-Canadian women writers were encouraged to challenge expressive realist discourse and experiment with and problematize language. She was also one of the founding editors of Tessera, a bilingual feminist journal established in 1984 that was dedicated to experimental writing, fostered dialogue between Francophone and Anglophone Canadian women writers, and explored the relationships between translation and feminism. Other prominent bilingual works by Canadian women writers include Carole Corbeil’s Voice-Over (1992) and Lola Lemire Tostevin’s Frog Moon (1994), and more recently Kathleen Saint-Onge’s 2013 autobiography, Bilingual Being: My Life as a Hyphen, all written in a mixture of English and French. Many works of Canadian literature continue to be translated from one of the country’s official languages to the other,\n\n22 INTRODUCTION\n\noften with the support of public funding, and are sometimes self-translated by the authors themselves (for instance, Nancy Huston’s Plainsong was also published in the same year as Cantique des plaines, in her own translation, and Montreal writer Nathanaël has self-translated many of her own works, in both directions).83 In Paraguayan Sea and in her other work, Moure is clearly in conversation with this strong tradition of female bilingual Canadian writers. However, despite her engagement with this literary legacy, Paraguayan Sea was not published in Canada but rather in the United States, in part, she has explained, because Canadian small literary presses rarely publish translations of works by foreigners, even if translated by Canadians, because they are not able to use their Canada Council funding to offset the cost of publishing and marketing.84 The choice of “Frenglish” to designate the language of her translation is perhaps appropriate given the book’s rebirth in a majority Anglophone environment where English-French language politics have little currency. The second part of chapter 4 of this book will demonstrate that, contrary to what the reductive, flippant term “Frenglish” suggests, Moure’s hybrid prose is creative and innovative, interacting with Bueno’s source text in ways that enhance and extend it, giving the book new life in the Northern hemisphere. NEW MULTILINGUAL WRITING\n\nThese loose, hybrid designations—“Spanglish,” “Portunhol,” and “Frenglish”—are useful in the discussion and marketing of the work examined in this book, but I do not want to give the impression that any one of them is a singular, fixed entity. Quite the opposite: they are shifting and multiplicitous, and do not follow rules or precedent with any regularity. The writing discussed in the chapters that follow has, moreover, been chosen specifically because it deviates from and subverts some of the more established language-mixing conventions in literary history. The work examined here advances and innovates on the formal strategies of multilingualism sketched thus far, challenging what Yildiz calls the “monolingual paradigm” in sustained ways.85Their multilingualism is extensive and committed, making few concessions to readers who may not be confidently multilingual by assuming a high level of linguistic competence in more than one language. Their hybrid languages allow these writers to articulate a global\n\n23 INTRODUCTION\n\nconscience while being of a distinctly local cultural realm; conscious of their inevitable travel, they remain wary of the ways translation can transform them, and therefore demand that readers remain critical participants in (rather than passive consumers of) their writing. In the work of all four writers, movement between languages is paralleled everywhere by movement between styles, registers, genres, and versions, making textual difficulty crucial to the way they engage their readers. What is more, these writers have been chosen because they participate in debates that are unique to the contemporary moment. For instance, they acknowledge and question the role of English as the language dominating scholarship and world literature, and respond to the unprecedented interconnectivity, mobility, and digitization of recent decades, advocating slow, careful reading in order to counteract the speed and ease of twenty-firstcentury reading practices. These writers are conscious of and reflective about their own artistic afterlives, including translational and digital afterlives, which continue to complicate the ways they are read, and they participate in contemporary conversations about disciplinary boundaries in scholarship as well as global language politics. While it is possible to discern the stylistic and aesthetic legacy of literary modernism here (these writers establish conversations with Julio Cortázar, Jorge Luis Borges, T. S. Eliot, and James Joyce, as the following chapters will demonstrate), the motivations and strategies for language mixing in the early twentieth century are nonetheless very different from those at the turn of the twenty-first. Joshua Miller, Juliette Taylor-Batty, and Laura Lonsdale have demonstrated at length the crucial role of multilingualism in the modernist aesthetic, both in Europe and America, which was concerned with the way technological modernity threatened notions of national and linguistic rootedness.86 This writing was often concerned, as Viktor Shklovsky argued in his 1971 essay “Art as Device,” with making language strange or difficult. Such “difficult, ‘laborious,’ impeding language” allowed readers to perceive the world anew by making familiar forms and objects seem strange.87 One important means of achieving this “ostranenie” (variously translated from Russian as “estrangement,” “enstrangement,” and “defamiliarization”) was through multilingualism, as for example in novels like Tolstoy’s War and Peace, written predominantly in Russian but with a significant use of French. In recent decades, however, globalization, mass migration, and the advent of digital communication have added to the\n\n24 INTRODUCTION\n\nexisting linguistic legacies of European colonialism and resulted in new linguistically diverse urban communities. The bilingualism of three of the writers addressed in this book (Braschi, Díaz, and Chávez-Silverman) is the result of U.S. imperial expansion and immigration from Latin America, but all four writers also reflect, in other ways, the increased mobility and transience of late twentieth- and twenty-first-century life: by avoiding narrative linearity, collapsing and distorting narrative time, showing a high tolerance for contradiction and ambivalence, and by participating in the recycling, rewriting, and reshaping of previous cultural forms in ways that emphasize their lack of fixity. It is also impossible to ignore that much of this writing is actively shaped by (and cognizant of its participation in) a globalized publishing industry dominated by English. Addressing issues of identity and difference in the face of increased global cultural standardization, these writers consciously interact with the interpretation of their own writing, anticipating readerly responses with a mixture of defensiveness and scorn. They show an awareness of their own textuality and incorporate different forms of metalepsis or frame breaking that allow them to respond to aspects of their own publishing, including the use of digital media. These characteristically postmodern techniques enable these writers to reflect on their creative processes and, in particular, to think through how translation is implicated in or inflects those processes. In the following chapters, I focus on layering and open-endedness as defining features of this writing that are everywhere bound up with the processes of translation. In arguing that literary multilingualism and translation are closely intertwined creative strategies, this book engages with a growing body of world literature criticism valuing writing that obstructs easy access, refuses translation, and escapes comparison. Voices like Tim Parks, Emily Apter, Minae Mizumura, and Brian Lennon figure the global novel as a commodity vulnerable to capitalist modes of production and consumption.88 According to this argument, as a result of the “McDonaldization of the globe,” literature has succumbed to standardization and homogenization, abandoning any political agenda, aesthetic innovation, formal difficulty, and local particularity, all in the name of maximizing readability (and translatability) across cultures and geographies.89 In response, these critics have begun to valorize “untranslatable” texts that refuse to enter into the\n\n25 INTRODUCTION\n\nmarket for global literature: Apter calls for new comparative studies that recognize the importance “of non-translation, mistranslation, incomparability and untranslatability,” while Lennon proposes increased attentiveness to “idiolectic incommensurability” and for a new discipline of “nontranslation studies.”90 These approaches emerged in the context of a “translational turn” in the humanities, which broadened the horizon of translation into other disciplinary fields, where it has become a metaphor for different forms of global cultural exchange. Within literary studies in particular, critics have highlighted the role of translational processes in the production and circulation of postcolonial and contemporary writing in English, demonstrating how translation can shape a work stylistically, structurally, and thematically, as well as challenging the assumption that languages are self-contained and rooted in particular geographies, rather than mutually informing and transportable. Fiona Doloughan, for instance, emphasizes the potential for enhanced creativity among writers with access to more than one language and culture, arguing that, in much contemporary literature in English, translation functions as a mode of reading as well as of writing.91 Rebecca Walkowitz, meanwhile, coins the term “born translated” to describe literature that narrates its engagement with more than one language rather than necessarily using them on the page. In “born-translated” writing, “translation functions as a thematic, structural, conceptual, and sometimes even typographical device”; it is “written for translation, in the hope of being translated, but . . . also often written as translation, pretending to take place in a language other than the one in which it has, in fact, been composed.”92 The work discussed in this book navigates a path between the “idiolectic incommensurability” valued by critics like Apter and Lennon and the “born-translated” literature identified by Walkowitz, demonstrating that they are not mutually exclusive. Writings by Chávez-Silverman, Díaz, Braschi, and Bueno display the linguistic idiosyncrasies and particularities that Lennon argues make a work, at least in a commercial sense, “untranslatable”: they mix languages, represent accents or vernacular effects, make references to cultural practices and social customs, use frequent wordplay and rare idioms. However, they also take translation as a prompt for narrative production, thematizing it and anticipating its role in reception. In these ways, they both invite translation and seek to make it difficult.\n\n26 INTRODUCTION\n\nTRANSLATING MULTILINGUALISM\n\nGiven that the recent valorization of “untranslatability” has often included multilingual writing, it has rarely been discussed how multilingual literature might actually be translated.93 Scholars of literary multilingualism have tended either to distance themselves from translation in order to emphasize the materiality and particularity of multilingual writing, or to restrict discussion of translation to its intratextual rather than intertextual uses.94 Approaches from within translation studies have tended to be narrowly focused, comparing individual choices made by individual translators,95 although Reine Meylaerts’s and Ranier Grutman’s functional descriptive approaches and Meir Sternberg’s structuralist model are exceptions.96 This book combines these approaches, studying not only how translation is involved in multilingual textual production but also how multilingual texts are translated for publication in different editions. Each chapter is structured around a detailed case study that analyses, on the one hand, how the source text deploys strategies of language mixing and translation, and, on the other hand, how its translator deploys similar strategies in their translation. In so doing, I combine a text-oriented approach with a broader view of writing and translation as sociocultural phenomena, reading multiple textual versions in the light of the market demand for writing to be widely readable and saleable, and taking into account the relative power and prestige of the languages in question. In chapter 1, I also combine criticism with the practice of translation, in order to reflect more productively on the phenomenology of reading multilingual writing, and on translation’s role as a mode of interpretation. But it is important to address claims of “untranslatability” before I begin my readings. Such claims tend to mean one of two things. Either they refer to ability, identifying a technical or formal obstacle to translation (“it can’t be translated”) or they refer to responsibility, identifying a theoretical or ethical obstacle to translation (“it shouldn’t be translated”). When something is said to be “untranslatable” in the former sense, what is usually meant is that translation is difficult rather than impossible. In particular, it often means that translation results in multiple different versions. Barbara Cassin’s use of the term “untranslatable” makes this particularly clear. She says, “To speak of untranslatables in no way implies that the terms in question, or the expressions, the syntactical or grammatical turns, are not\n\n27 INTRODUCTION\n\nand cannot be translated: the untranslatable is rather what one keeps on (not) translating. But this indicates that their translation, into one language or another, creates a problem, to the extent of sometimes generating a neologism or imposing a new meaning on an old word.”97Some words, she argues, require us to keep translating them over and over again, because each translation leaves us wanting to do it again, differently. What Cassin describes is a word that requires continuous, creative translation; a word that is “unable to be finished being translated.”98 Translation of supposedly “untranslatable” words, including those collected in her Vocabulaire européen des philosophies: Dictionnaire des intraduisibles, evidently can and does take place, often very successfully, as is evidenced by the above quotation from the English translation of that volume (Dictionary of Untranslatables: A Philosophical Lexicon), and of course by the works of Braschi, ChávezSilverman, Díaz, and Bueno, all four of which exist in translation—in Díaz’s case, into as many as twenty-two different languages. This understanding of translation as multiple, moving, and layered is one to which I will return throughout this book. None of this is to deny that certain structural, stylistic, thematic, and textual features pose greater challenges than others for translators. For instance, texts that attach meaning to one or more specific languages or language varieties are harder to translate, as Walkowitz explains: “[These texts] use proper names whose cultural and historical associations are not easily rendered in a new language. They generate metaphor through homonym, accent, and other vernacular effects. They comment on the relationship between one language and specific other languages, or between one dialect of a language and another. Or they attach ideas to phonological or etymological patterns.”99 This is what lies behind Robert Frost’s muchquoted assertion that poetry is what gets lost in translation: the unique connections in poetry between ideas and the forms used to express them are difficult to replicate precisely in other languages, because the sounds, rhythms, and patterns of those languages naturally differ.100 The same features make the writing addressed in this book difficult to translate. The ideas and commitments that are expressed in part through their form— through their combination of languages, language varieties, registers, and accents—are difficult to replicate using the resources of other languages, or of a single language. These difficulties are not in doubt; however, the idea that multilingual writing is in any literal sense “untranslatable” is wide of\n\n28 INTRODUCTION\n\nthe mark. This book will demonstrate at length how translators can represent, in their work, the previous existence of multiple languages and the relationships between them. The argument that certain texts shouldn’t be translated, however, can be more compelling than the argument that they can’t be. The suggestion in these cases is usually that to translate is to violate a text in some way, or to violate the culture from which it comes. Abdelfattah Kilito, for instance, in a lecture titled “Thou Shalt Not Translate Me,” advances the argument that we should safeguard a text’s right not to be translated, for instance in the case of sacred texts or the private language of prayer.101 In addition to the technical claim previously outlined—that literary multilingualism is translatable, and in such a way that does not necessarily erase its complexity or subversive potential—this book also ventures a further claim: that multilingualism in literature (whether translated or not) is a politically and culturally progressive force that can help foster critical rigor and disrupt hegemonic cultural regimes including gender, sexuality, and nationality. In order to demonstrate both these claims, it is helpful to return to Anzaldúa’s Borderlands/La Frontera, in which the author struggles against the expectation that she will always translate her work—which often depends on the particular relationships between its languages for the way it means—for the benefit of others.102 It is for this reason, presumably, that Borderlands/La Frontera has never been translated, whether into just English, just Spanish, or any other language(s). And yet, for all its challenging the monolingual paradigm, translation remains integral to the structure of the book. For instance, the final poem in the volume, which emphasizes the longevity of Chicanx culture and envisages its continued resilience in the future, appears in two versions, the first called “No se raje Chicanita,” the second called “Don’t give in, Chicanita.” The first version is mainly in Spanish, with a few words and phrases in English, as the following stanza illustrates: Y, cuando los gringos se acaban— mira como se matan unos a los otros— aquí vamos a parecer con los horned toads y los lagartijos Survivors del First Fire Age, el Quinto Sol.103\n\n29 INTRODUCTION\n\nThe incursion of English words, coupled with unusual grammatical and lexical choices in Spanish (the indicative “se acaban” rather than the subjunctive “se acaben,” and the use of “parecer con”), may be defamiliarizing for many readers of Spanish. Depending on each reader’s linguistic competence, the poem will be read in slightly different ways, such that it always has multiple layers. It is then layered again with the appearance of a second version, “Don’t give in, Chicanita,” which has been “translated by the author” into mainly English, such that the above stanza appears thus: And when the Gringos are gone— see how they kill one another— here we’ll still be like the horned toad and the lizard relics of an earlier age survivors of the First Fire Age—el Quinto Sol.104\n\nAlthough the word “translation” is used to describe the second version, this is no straightforward translation. The meaning of the second version sometimes deviates considerably from the first, as in the use of “here we’ll still be” for “aquí vamos a parecer,” which seems to read “parecer” (to seem, to be like) as “permanecer” (to remain). Anzaldúa edits the poem as she translates, so that the second version has different lineation, and sometimes additional lines, as in the above stanza (“relics of an earlier age”). English and Spanish appear in both versions, but in different ways; although “Don’t give in, Chicanita” is mainly in English, the occasional use of Spanish words and phrases makes it at least as bilingual as the first version, with lines like “digging underground / toward that current, that soul of tierra madre” (mother earth).105 In its two versions, this poem illustrates the natural connection between the defamiliarizing aesthetic of multilingual writing and theories of “foreignizing” translation. “Foreignization,” a term coined by Lawrence Venuti, describes translation strategies that unsettle and challenge the target readership by surrendering to the forms and ideologies of the source language and culture.106 The target language is made strange through the influence of the source language, as it is here by the inclusion of the phrase “tierra madre.” Literary multilingualism, like foreignizing translations, can be “a form of resistance against ethnocentrism and racism, cultural narcissism and imperialism, in the interests of democratic\n\n30 INTRODUCTION\n\ngeopolitical relations,” as Venuti puts it.107 It can disrupt the dominance of Anglophone culture, challenging the assumption of a right to “easy reading”—or, as Walkowitz puts it, the right to feel like “native readers” of literature from any given culture,108 as well as other normative systems like national or sexual identity. Translational techniques are equally apparent in the first and the second version of Anzaldúa’s poem—the source and the target text— demonstrating that translation can defamiliarize and disrupt just as well as bilingual writing can. A translation does not have to be monolingual, nor does it have to erase the subversive potential of its source, but it can be linguistically playful in its own unique ways in order to remind readers of the existence of multiple languages in the version from which it derives. For instance, in her translation of the line “Esa víbora dormida, la rebeldía, saltará” as “That sleeping serpent, / rebellion-(r)evolution, will spring up,” Anzaldúa uses a neologism to evoke the multiple connotations of a single Spanish word, “rebeldía.” The compounding of “rebellion” and “revolution,” coupled with the use of parentheses in “(r)evolution,” which also accommodates “evolution” (a meaning not immediately evident in the first version of the poem), results in a translation that is unsettling, layered, and provisional; “rebeldía” is “untranslatable” in Cassin’s sense of engendering multiple, repeated translations. The use of “(r)evolution” in the second version adds something new and unlooked for to the poem as a whole. In this way, “Don’t give in, Chicanita” is presented as a natural continuation of the processes already underway in “No se raje, Chicanita.” This poem demonstrates that although Anzaldúa openly rejects the pressure to translate for the benefit of non-Chicanxs, the processes of translation remain integral to her writing. It demonstrates that translation, far from being an annihilation of the complexities of bilingual writing, can open up a work to new readerships while allowing meaning to proliferate in different directions. Although these texts may not, in the first instance, be entirely willing to accommodate semi-fluent and non-fluent readers, in later translational manifestations they are reoriented toward readers with different, sometimes less extensive, linguistic competences. This does not make them capitulations to “McDonaldization,” but rather complex responses to the rich contemporary themes of digital communication, globalization, and cultural imperialism. This is writing that actively dramatizes and invites translation, sometimes even collaborating on its own\n\n31 INTRODUCTION\n\ntranslation (as is the case with Braschi’s Yo-Yo Boing!), all the while continuing to deflect assumptions of easy equivalence and universal accessibility. THE APPROACHES AND STRUCTURE OF THIS BOOK\n\nThe following chapters draw on theories of post-structuralism in order to advance an understanding of literary translation as an ongoing, unfinishable process. Exploring translation’s role in and between different versions of work by Díaz, Braschi, Chávez-Silverman, and Bueno, I turn at different moments to Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of the rhizome, a mode of thinking that accommodates multiplicities and resists hierarchy; and to queer theory, which, building on a post-structuralist understanding of identity as a constellation of multiple unstable positions, seeks to disturb or avoid definitions of gender and sexuality. I use these modes of thinking to argue that the open-endedness and seriality of these texts—which derive in part from the role of translation in their inception—means that they are left open to further interpretation and reinscription, including in the form of wholesale translation into new textual versions. Throughout, I understand literary translation to be a creative practice in its own right, one that can never be entirely faithful to an “original” because an original itself contains no stable or essential meaning. In this I am building on a “creative turn” in translation studies that has sought to redefine literary translation as a creative practice analogous to writing. Most notably, this includes two edited volumes published in 2006 explicitly connecting the work of literary translators with that of creative writers: The Translator as Writer and Translation and Creativity;109 and, more recently, Cecilia Rossi’s work on the creativity of literary translation and the fluid boundaries between the disciplines of literary translation and creative writing.110 The active, creative role of the translator is especially apparent in the translation of the contemporary multilingual literature to be examined in this volume. Since this writing is already about translation in various ways—it dramatizes translation, invites translation, and deploys translation as a means of defamiliarization—the translators become participants in processes already underway in their source texts. It is telling that the translators of Díaz’s Oscar Wao (Achy Obejas), Braschi’s Yo-Yo Boing! (Tess O’Dwyer), and Bueno’s Mar Paraguayo (Erín Moure), discussed in chapters 2, 3, and 4, respectively, are all writers themselves. Their work illustrates\n\n32 INTRODUCTION\n\nwith particular clarity the common ground between multilingual writing and translation. My analysis builds on a preoccupation in world literature studies with the physicality of the book in an age of digitization—exemplified in calls by David Damrosch and Franco Moretti for emphasis on the “phenomenology” of the work: a book’s appearance, circulation, and translation, rather than its “ontology”—combining fine-grained analysis with a consideration of each work as material artefact.111 For instance, I examine the ways print and digital paratexts (footnotes and epigraphs, but also author interviews and online glossaries) interact with and modify a text itself.112 By paying attention to multiple textual versions, including translated versions, I am able to examine how this writing circulates in more than one literary and linguistic culture, opening itself up to new readers outside its place(s) of inception. It is impossible to forget the very different backgrounds of the four writers examined in this book, and the cultural and political histories that have shaped the way they use language. The United States’ relationship with Puerto Rico, where Braschi grew up, is not the same as its relationship with the Dominican Republic, where Díaz spent his first seven years, nor indeed with Mexico, where Chávez-Silverman spent the summers during her youth; and none of these relationships is comparable to the relationships between Paraguay and Brazil, or between the different linguistic communities of Canada. Despite beginning in distinct, sometimes multiple locations, and despite being read in varied circumstances, these writings can, as I aim to demonstrate by situating them within a larger evolving argument, be productively brought together—without losing sight of their particularities—to demonstrate a set of shared preoccupations and techniques. This book is divided into an introduction, four main chapters, and a short coda. Each chapter engages with a different multilingual authortranslator pair.113 Chapter 1 examines Chávez-Silverman’s bilingual English-Spanish “crónicas,” a unique short form of life writing of which she has published two volumes. It uses the concept of the “palimpsest” to argue that a process of layering is at work not just in the crónicas’ language, which embraces rather than rejects inter- and intralingual translation, but also in their genre, modal, geographic, and textual “interstitiality.” In the latter part of the chapter, I reflect on my own translation of Chávez-Silverman’s “Todo verdor perdurará crónica” for publication in Asymptote, detailing a series\n\n33 INTRODUCTION\n\nof challenges and possible solutions, and arguing that ultimately ChávezSilverman’s work opens itself up to experimentation with translation rather than foreclosing it. Chapter 2 reads Junot Díaz’s The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao via its trope of “páginas en blanco”—the partial erasures and rewritings that occur at different stages of its production and reception. It begins by arguing that the novel’s creolized language, stylistic devices, and structural organization mimic the experience of reading narratives about or produced under censorship and repression. Positioning Oscar Wao as what Roland Barthes calls a “writerly” text, it argues that the novel’s linguistic, typographic, and structural blanks demand engaged, active readers (much like Chávez-Silverman’s work does) who must translate, explain, and uncensor parts of the novel for themselves. The second part of the chapter considers the role translation plays in both the novel’s production and its reception. It argues that translation is subtly incorporated into the novel as a narrative device—pseudotranslation—despite Díaz’s apparent policy of nontranslation. It then turns to Achy Obejas’s translation of Oscar Wao into Spanish, considering it as analogous to other paratextual rewritings of the novel, and arguing that her translation responds to processes already underway by partially “uncensoring” the text while also creating new “blanks” of her own. Chapter 3 examines how anxieties about language, gender fluidity, and queer desire intersect in Giannina Braschi’s 1998 bilingual novel Yo-Yo Boing!. Identifying the novel’s language (particularly the ways in which its English and Spanish interact, transform, and enhance one another) as a key part of its textual difficulty, it argues that this language constitutes a queer practice in its indeterminacy, its resistance to fixity and transparency, and its perception as transgressive. Braschi’s language is altered, however, in Tess O’Dwyer’s 2011 “translation” of the novel into only English, which I read as a continuation of Braschi’s highly self-referential postmodern play. Responding to its own characters’ anxieties, O’Dwyer’s version “un-queers” their language and thus mitigates the novel’s difficulty. Positioning the translation in the context of its publication by AmazonCrossing, which hopes to appeal to a wide readership, this chapter argues that O’Dwyer’s problematic translation increases the novel’s accessibility and circulation but no longer challenges normative discourse on the standardness and monolingualism of literary language. Nevertheless, I view the two versions\n\n34 INTRODUCTION\n\nof the novel as a complex, contradictory, collaborative whole, one that blurs the lines between production and reception, interpretation and praxis, subverting the traditionally hierarchical relationship between original and translation to instead propose the latter as a condition of textual production. Chapter 4 extends the work of the previous chapter by tracing the connections between language, gender, and genre fluidity in Brazilian writer Wilson Bueno’s hugely popular Mar Paraguayo (“Portunhol” and Guarani, 1992) and its recent translation by Canadian poet Erín Moure as Paraguayan Sea (“Frenglish” and Guarani, 2017). The first part of the chapter draws connections between Bueno’s work and that of the three writers previously addressed in this book, demonstrating that, as in those works of “Spanglish” literature, translational strategies are embedded in Bueno’s “Portunhol” in ways that emphasize his work’s openness to further reinscription. Exploring the book’s connections to the neobaroque and concrete movements, I demonstrate that his multilingual prose incorporates other kinds of textual and conceptual fluidity, as is epitomized by his nameless protagonist, who is a fluid subjectivity in numerous ways: not just as the speaker of more than one language, but also as a Paraguayan at home in Brazil and as a subject in a possibly queer body, with possibly queer desires. The second part of the chapter offers Erín Moure’s Paraguayan Sea as this book’s most powerful example yet of a translation that is multilingual, creative, and fluid, and which interacts with its source text in ways that enhance and extend it. This section examines how Moure reformulates Bueno’s multilingual strategies in order to give his work new life in the Northern hemisphere. As with all the writing studied thus far in this book, Moure’s Paraguayan Sea demonstrates translation to be productive and original, rather than derivative and secondary. I argue that she draws on a tradition of Canadian feminist and queer translation to assert her translator subjectivity in Paraguayan Sea, blurring the line between author and translator. Finally, a brief coda brings together the interests of the previous chapters in an analysis of two special features on multilingual writing that I edited for Asymptote, a quarterly online journal of international literature in translation, in July of 2015 and 2016. Two of the texts discussed in this book (extracts from Erín Moure’s Paraguayan Sea and my translation of Chávez-Silverman’s “Todo verdor perdurará crónica”) were published for the first time in Asymptote’s pages, and the process of compiling the features\n\n35 INTRODUCTION\n\nfacilitated the development of this research in numerous ways. The coda argues that the strategies and preoccupations identified in the work of Chávez-Silverman, Díaz, Obejas, Braschi, O’Dwyer, Bueno, and Moure can be traced more broadly across other contemporary multilingual literatures. Asymptote gives us a snapshot of writers and translators who, like those addressed in the chapters of this book, are exploring the fertile intersections between languages, as well as the spaces between nations and cultures, speech and writing, gendered identities, and literary genres. The volume and variety of writing submitted to these Asymptote features underscore the necessity of cultivating a “postmonolingual condition” (a “struggle against the monolingual paradigm,” and “multilingual attempts to overcome it”) rather than surrendering to a dangerous swing toward monolingualism and the divisive, inward-looking politics with which it goes hand-in-hand.114 These readings will illustrate the urgency of attending to literature that represents the frictions and paradoxes of multilingual life, especially in a political climate increasingly dominated by border policing and antiimmigrant sentiment.\n\nChapter One\n\n“MI LENGUA ES UN PALIMPSESTO” Susana Chávez-Silverman’s Palimpsestuous W"
