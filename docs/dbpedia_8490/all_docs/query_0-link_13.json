        "text": "This paper examines the representation of India in the works of Latin American women writers in the 20th Century. With the advent of Modernism in Latin America in the late 19th Century as a turn-of-the-century movement, Latin American intellectuals started engaging with India such as Rubén Darío in Azul (1888). However, it was Gabriela Mistral, a Nobel laureate from Chile, who although never travelled to India, may be considered the first Latin American woman writer who engaged with India through the appreciation of Tagore in her literary repertoire. Furthermore, in the 20th Century Cecília Meireles, one of the most famous Modernist poets from Brazil visited India in 1953 upon being invited by Jawaharlal Nehru. She noted in her diary that as paradoxical as it sounds, it is much easier to understand India if one knows Brazil. She drew similarities between the fundamental issues of the two countries then. She wrote the anthology Poemas Escritos Na Índia (1961). Another important perfo...\n\nThis article deals with reception of Cervantes’s works, particularly Don Quixote de la Mancha in India, and the select works of Andalusian poet Federico Garcia Lorca. Indian culture has its own historical and peculiar traditions; hence, the foreign literary and cultural products do not get an easy access to its domain. Western works even have lesser chance to do so, for their obvious differences. However, the amenable reception of Cervantes’s immortal piece Don Quixote, and remarkably sensual universal plays of Federico Garcia Lorca e.g. La Casa de Bernarda Alba, Yerma, Bodas de Sangre etc have since a long time dominated the theatrical space in India. With this paper I would like to explore this unique phenomenon. How Spanish literary works enjoy such warm reception is indeed a matter of due academic attention.\n\nPaz’s El mono gramático is a prose poem and a meditation on the nature of poetry and art. While the Mexican Ambassador to India, Paz made a day trip to Galta, a temple complex on the eastern side of the city of Jaipur in the state of Rajasthan. He was accompanied by his wife, Marie- José, and the book is dedicated to her. They were perhaps accompanied by Eusebio Rojas, judging by the credits on some of the photographs. The twen-ty-nine chapters alternate between Galta and Cambridge, England, where in 1970 Paz, a Visiting Fellow at Churchill College, is writing the book.\n\nEnglish Heart, Hindi Heartland examines Delhi’s postcolonial literary world—its institutions, prizes, publishers, writers, and translators, and the cultural geographies of key neighborhoods—in light of colonial histories and the globalization of English. Rashmi Sadana places internationally recognized authors such as Salman Rushdie, Anita Desai, Vikram Seth, and Aravind Adiga in the context of debates within India about the politics of language and alongside other writers, including K. Satchidanandan, Shashi Deshpande, and Geetanjali Shree. Sadana undertakes an ethnographic study of literary culture that probes the connections between place, language, and text in order to show what language comes to stand for in people’s lives. In so doing, she unmasks a social discourse rife with questions of authenticity and cultural politics of inclusion and exclusion. English Heart, Hindi Heartland illustrates how the notion of what is considered to be culturally and linguistically authentic not only obscures larger questions relating to caste, religious, and gender identities, but that the authenticity discourse itself is continually in flux. In order to mediate and extract cultural capital from India’s complex linguistic hierarchies, literary practitioners strategically deploy a fluid set of cultural and political distinctions that Sadana calls “literary nationality.” Sadana argues that English, and the way it is positioned among the other Indian languages, does not represent a fixed pole, but rather serves to change political and literary alliances among classes and castes, often in surprising ways.

The volume is edited by faculty from Universidad Católica del Maule, Chile and Doon University, India along with a team of experts from the Rupkatha Journal. This special volume titled “Across Cultures: Ibero-America and India” intends to shed light on the trans-axial South-South history that implicates academic, cultural, intellectual, commercial and political exchanges between India, Spain, Portugal and Latin America. This special issue is an attempt to fill in the existing void in the academic literature on the theme, by exploring the bonds between the two cultures, so distant from each other and yet continuing to contribute towards the process of mutual understanding of their respective societies and thus reinforcing socio-political and cultural relations between these two regions.

It traces the course of discovering the poet&#39;s expression as the journey within, a divine communion with cosmic consciousness an idea of nation building and collective harmony. This quest of comparative reading of Narendra Modi and Pablo Neruda as poets of people began long back in 2011. I am glad to present this study after working on it gradually for long, I have selected to study few poems from Modi’s Blessed are these Eyes/ Ankh Aa Dhanya Chee and Neruda&#39;s Spain in Our Hearts/ Espana En El Corazon, as a more radical investigation into the possibilities and limits of poetics and politics as field of human activity. Focal points of the paper are:  How and why poet Narendra Modi and leader Narendra Modi, is promising. Why and how poet Pablo Neruda and leader Pablo Neruda appeals.  Their works reflect that the poet in their individu..."
