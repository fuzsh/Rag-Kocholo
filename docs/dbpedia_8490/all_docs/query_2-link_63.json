Enjoy reading these insights and feel free to share this page on your social media to inspire others.\n\nMay these Love Quotes on many subjects inspire you to never give up and keep working towards your goals. Who knows—success could be just around the corner.\n\nLove is a variety of different feelings, states, and attitudes that ranges from interpersonal affection to pleasure. It can refer to an emotion of a strong attraction and personal attachment. It can also be a virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection—”the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another”. It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one’s self or animals.\n\nSee also: Love Proverbs, Love, What Is Love?, Romance (love), Agape “Divine Love”, Mahabba (Love), (Passion or Intense, Ecstatic Love), Love of God, Love For Humankind, Philosophy of Love, Free Love, and Platonic Love\n\nPlease DO page find from your browser for your subject SEARCH.\n\nLove is one of the most subtle blessings that the Most Merciful One has bestowed upon humanity. It exists in everyone as a seed. This seed germinates under favorable circumstances and, growing like a tree, blossoms into a flower, and finally ripens, like a fruit, to unite the beginning with the end. – M. Fethullah Gulen\n\nLove penetrates, as a feeling, into our inner being through the inlets of our eyes, ears, and heart. It then swells like water behind a dam, grows like an avalanche, or engulfs our very being like a flame. It starts to subside only when it results in union. The flame goes out, the reservoir empties, and the avalanche melts away. – M. Fethullah Gulen\n\nLove is a natural and essential aspect of our being. But when it is transformed into “true love”—love of the Creator—it acquires its true nature and color, and later becomes “pure” pleasure at the threshold of union. – M. Fethullah Gulen\n\nOne’s heart is a receptive port for Divine manifestations. Your love of the Creator and yearning to return to Him is the clearest sign of your being loved by God. – M. Fethullah Gulen\n\nLove is the most direct and safest way to human perfection. It is difficult to attain the rank of human perfection through ways that do not contain love. Other than the way of “acknowledging one’s innate impotence, poverty, and reliance on God’s Power and Riches, and one’s zeal in His way and thanksgiving,” no other way to truth is equal to that of love. – M. Fethullah Gulen\n\nLove is a mount, bestowed upon us by God, that carries us toward the Paradise we lost. No one who has ridden this mount has ever been stranded on this road, although we sometimes find people on this celestial mount walking on the road side due to some boastful words they utter because of their intoxication from joy. However, this is a matter between them and God. – M. Fethullah Gulen\n\nNeither the “flames” of the world nor the fire of Hell can “burn” those who already have been “burnt to ashes” by love. Those who burn with the fear of Hellfire while in this world will not go to Hell. The final abode of those who feel secure against Hellfire will most probably be Hell. Those who burn here in the flames of love and suffer Hell on earth by struggling against their carnal selves and the world will most certainly not be subjected again to the same suffering in the Hereafter. – M. Fethullah Gulen\n\nLove makes us forget our own existence, and annihilates our existence in the existence of our beloved. It therefore requires the lover to always want the beloved, and thus to dedicate himself or herself, without expecting any return, completely to the desires of the beloved. This is, according to my way of thinking, the essence of humanity. – M. Fethullah Gulen\n\nIn the way of love, even a slight, imagined inclination of the lover to someone or something other than the beloved means the end of love. Such an inclination is forbidden. Love continues as long as the lover sees the beloved in everything around him or her, and regards every beauty and perfection as the manifestation of the beloved. If this is not the case, love dies. – M. Fethullah Gulen\n\nLovers cannot imagine any opposition, no matter how small, to the beloved. They cannot endure to see the beloved veiled by something that causes Him to be forgotten. Moreover, lovers regard as futile any speech that is not about the beloved, and any act that is not related to Him as ingratitude and disloyalty. – M. Fethullah Gulen\n\nLove means the heart’s attachment and the will power’s inclination toward the beloved. It also means the feelings’ being purified of anything or anyone else other than the beloved and all the senses and faculties of the lover being turned to and set on the beloved only. Every act of the lover reflects the beloved: his or her heart always beats with yearning for the beloved; his or her tongue always murmurs the beloved’s name, and his or her eyes open and close with the beloved’s image. – M. Fethullah Gulen\n\nSeeing the beloved’s traces in the blowing wind, the falling rain, the murmuring stream, the humming forest, the dawning morning and the darkening night, the lover comes alive. Seeing the beloved’s beauty reflected in everything, the lover becomes exuberant. Feeling the beloved’s breath in every breeze, the lover becomes joyful. Feeling the beloved’s occasional reproaches, the lover moans in sorrow. – M. Fethullah Gulen\n\nLovers who awaken to the dawn of the beloved’s signs find themselves engulfed by a flood of flames. They burn therein, never desiring to escape this pleasant “hell.” They are like volcanoes ready to erupt, and their groans are like lava, which burns everything it touches. – M. Fethullah Gulen\n\nOne should not confuse true love with the feeling felt for members of the opposite sex. Such love, although sometimes transformed into true love, is deficient, temporary, and has no inherent value. – M. Fethullah Gulen\n\nIt is impossible to express love with words, for love is an emotional state that can be understood only by the lover. – M. Fethullah Gulen\n\nLovers are intoxicated with their love, admiration, and appreciation of the beloved. Only the trumpet announcing the Day of Judgment will bring lovers to their senses. – M. Fethullah Gulen\n\nOnly true love will end the pain caused by being ephemeral, and extinguish the “flames” in which the afflicted “burn.” True love will cure all apparently incurable pain and disease, and answer the cries of the modern world. – M. Fethullah Gulen\n\nIf we do not plant the seeds of love in the hearts of young people, whom we try to revive through science, knowledge, and modern culture, they will never attain perfection and free themselves completely from their carnal desires. – M. Fethullah Gulen\n\nLove is blind. – Chaucer\n\nLove is stronger than justice. – Sting\n\nLove is a serious mental disease. – Plato\n\nLove is friendship on fire. – Susan Sontag\n\nLove is the poetry of the senses. – Unknown\n\nLove is being stupid together. – Paul Valery\n\nLove is the fulfilling of the Law. – The Bible\n\nLove is a great beautifier. – Louisa May Alcott\n\nLove is sharing your popcorn. – Charles Schultz\n\nLove is the only gold. – Alfred Lord Tennyson\n\nLove is a tyrant sparing none. – Pierre Corneille\n\nLove is the bridge between two hearts. – Unknown\n\nLove is a thing that is full of cares and fears. – Ovid\n\nLove is not a volunteer thing. – Samuel Richardson\n\n​Love is a friendship set to music. – Joseph Campbell\n\nLove is like Heaven, but it can hurt like Hell. – Unknown\n\nLove is so short, forgetting is so long. – Pablo Neruda\n\nLove is the wild card of existence. – Rita Mae Brown\n\nLove is a better teacher than duty. – Albert Einstein\n\nLove is a friendship set to music. – E.

To love, therefore, is to sterilize the person one loves. – Albert Camus\n\nThe true beloveds of this world are in their lover’s eyes lilacs opening, ship lights, school bells, a landscape, remembered conversations, friends, a child’s Sunday, lost voices, one’s favorite suit, autumn and all seasons, memory, yes, it being the earth and water of existence, memory. – Truman Capote\n\nLove is not altogether a delirium, yet it has many points in common therewith. – Thomas Carlyle\n\nYou can give without loving, but you cannot love without giving. – Amy Carmichael\n\nEverybody forgets the basic thing; people are not going to love you unless you love them. – Pat Carroll\n\nIt is difficult to lay aside a confirmed passion. – Catullus\n\nLove, Arthur, is a poodle’s chance of attaining the infinite, and personally I have my pride. – Louis–Ferdinand Celine\n\nA relationship is like a rose,\n\nHow long it lasts, no one knows;\n\nLove can erase an awful past,\n\nLove can be yours, you’ll see at last;\n\nTo feel that love, it makes you sigh,\n\nTo have it leave, you’d rather die;\n\nYou hope you’ve found that special rose,\n\n‘Cause you love and care for the one you chose. – Rob Cella\n\n‘Tis said of love that it sometimes goes, sometimes flies; runs with one, walks gravely with another; turns a third into ice, and sets a fourth in a flame: it wounds one, another it kills: like lightning it begins and ends in the same moment: it makes that fort yield at night which it besieged but in the morning; for there is no force able to resist it. – Miguel de Cervantes\n\nLove and war are the same thing, and stratagems and policy are as allowable in the one as in the other. – Miguel de Cervantes\n\nOne who has not only the four S’s, which are required in every good lover, but even the whole alphabet; as for example… Agreeable, Bountiful, Constant, Dutiful, Easy, Faithful, Gallant, Honorable, Ingenious, Kind, Loyal, Mild, Noble, Officious, Prudent, Quiet, Rich, Secret, True, Valiant, Wise; the X indeed, is too harsh a letter to agree with him, but he is Young and Zealous. – Miguel de Cervantes\n\nBetter to have loved a short man than never to have loved a tall. – David Chambless\n\nWhen a man and a woman have an overwhelming passion for each other, it seems to me, in spite of such obstacles dividing them as parents or husband, that they belong to each other in the name of Nature, and are lovers by Divine right, in spite of human convention or the laws. – Sebastian Roch Nicolas Chamfort\n\nTrue love is the parent of humility. – William Ellery Channing\n\nLove is the affinity which links and draws together the elements of the world… Love, in fact, is the agent of universal synthesis. – Pierre Teilhard de Chardin\n\nLove alone can unite living beings so as to complete and fulfill them… for it alone joins them by what is deepest in themselves. All we need is to imagine our ability to love developing until it embraces the totality of men and the earth. – Pierre Teilhard de Chardin\n\nSomeday, after mastering winds, waves, tides and gravity, we shall harness the energy of love; and for the second time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire. – Pierre Teilhard de Chardin\n\nLove means to love that which is unlovable; or it is no virtue at all. – G. K. Chesterton\n\nThe way to love anything is to realize that it might be lost. – G. K. Chesterton\n\nMany a man has fallen in love with a girl in light so dim he would not have chosen a suit by it. – Maurice Chevalier\n\nThe cure for all ills and wrongs, the cares, the sorrows and the crimes of humanity, all lie in the one word ‘love.’ It is the divine vitality that everywhere produces and restores life. – Lydia Maria Child\n\nDo not keep the alabaster boxes of your love and tenderness sealed up until your friends are dead. Fill their lives with sweetness, speak cheering words while their ears can hear, and while their hearts can be thrilled and made happier by them. – Williams Childs\n\nEvery day I live I am more convinced that the waste of life lies in the love we have not given, the powers we have not used, the selfish prudence that will risk nothing and which, shirking pain, misses happiness as well. – Mary Cholmondeley\n\nLove is the word used to label the sexual excitement of the young, the habituation of the middle – aged, and the mutual dependence of the old. – John Ciardi\n\nYou can’t put a price tag on love, but you can on all its accessories. – Melanie Clark\n\nOne is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving. – Paulo Coelho\n\nAll thoughts, all passions, all delights\n\nWhatever stirs this mortal frame\n\nAll are but ministers of Love\n\nAnd feed His sacred flame. – Samuel Taylor Coleridge\n\nSympathy constitutes friendship; but in love there is a sort of antipathy, or opposing passion. Each strives to be the other, and both together make up one whole. – Samuel Taylor Coleridge\n\nFriendship often ends in love; but love in friendship – never. – Charles Caleb Colton\n\nIf you cannot inspire a woman with love of you, fill her above the brim with love of herself; all that runs over will be yours. – Charles Caleb Colton\n\nLove is an alliance of friendship and animalism; if the former predominates it is passion exalted and refined; if the latter, gross and sensual. – Charles Caleb Colton\n\nTo love a thing means wanting it to live. – Confucius\n\nCan there be a love which does not make demands on its object? – Confucius\n\nIf there’s delight in love, ‘Tis when I see that heart, which others bleed for, bleed for me. – William Congreve\n\nWe love but once, for once only are we perfectly equipped for loving. – Cyril Connolly\n\nThere is no pain equal to that which two lovers can inflict on one another. This should be made clear to all who contemplate such a union. The avoidance of this pain is the beginning of wisdom, for it is strong enough to contaminate the rest of our lives. – Cyril Connolly\n\nWoe to the man whose heart has not learned while young to hope, to love – and to put its trust in life. – Joseph Conrad\n\nLove – THE FEELING – is a fruit of love, the verb. – Stephen Covey\n\nLove touched her heart, and lo! It beats high, and burns with such brave hearts. – Richard Crawshaw\n\nLove is the extra effort we make in our dealings with those whom we do not like and once you understand that, you understand all. This idea that love overtakes you is nonsense. This is but a polite manifestation of sex. To love another you have to undertake some fragment of their destiny. – Quentin Crisp\n\nI love you, not for what you are, but for what I am when I am with you. – Roy Croft\n\nMen and women are not free to love decently until they have analyzed themselves completely and swept away every mystery from sex; and this means the acquisition of a profound philosophical theory based on wide reading of anthropology and enlightened practice. – Aleister Crowley\n\nLove is shown in your deeds, not in your words. – Fr. Jerome Cummings\n\nBut it is impossible to replace a person one has loved with distractions. – Roald Dahl\n\nThe way to a woman’s heart is through your wallet. – Frank Dane\n\nIt is better to have loved and lost, than to have paid for it and not liked it at all. – Graham Davies\n\nIf we seek the pleasures of love, passion should be occasional, and common sense continual. – Robertson Davies\n\nThe more connections you and your lover make, not just between your bodies, but between your minds, your hearts, and your souls, the more you will strengthen the fabric of your relationship, and the more real moments you will experience together. – Barbara De Angelis\n\nLove’s greatest gift is its ability to make everything it touches sacred. – Barbara De Angelis\n\nAbsence is to love what wind is to fire; it extinguishes the small, it enkindles the great. – Comte DeBussy – Rabutin\n\nLove comes from blindness, friendship from knowledge. – Comte DeBussy – Rabutin\n\nLove builds bridges where there are none. – R. H. Delaney\n\nLove makes the wildest spirit tame, and the tamest spirit wild. – Alexis Delp\n\nDo everything with so much love in your heart that you would never want to do it any other way. – Yogi Desai\n\nYes, I do touch. I believe that everyone needs that – Princess of Wales Diana\n\nI love to hold people’s hands when I visit hospitals, even though they are shocked because they haven’t experienced anything like it before, but to me it is a normal thing to do. – Princess of Wales Diana\n\nI remember when I used to sit on hospital beds and hold people?s hands, people used to be shocked because they?d never seen this before. To me it was quite normal. – Princess of Wales Diana\n\nMy first thoughts are that I should not let people down, that I should support them and love them. – Princess of Wales Diana\n\nIf you find someone you love in your life, then hang on to that love. – Princess of Wales Diana\n\nI know that I can give love for a minute, for half an hour; for a day, for a month, but I can give and I’m very happy to do that and I want to do that. – Princess of Wales Diana\n\nI adore him I have never been so happy. I have real love. – Princess of Wales Diana\n\nEveryone of us needs to show how much we care for each other and, in the process, care for ourselves. – Princess of Wales Diana\n\nA loving heart is the truest wisdom. – Charles Dickens\n\nI argue thee that love is life. And life hath immortality. – Emily Dickinson\n\nWho dares deny that this is true:\n\nThe whole is more than all its parts?\n\nA whole love than divided love,\n\nOr than half love from fifty hearts?\n\nYet who dare either this deny:\n\nThe part is more than is the whole?\n\nThat treasures halved with one dear love\n\nAre more than double to the soul? – Arthur Dillon\n\nFor in the end, we will conserve only what we love. We will love only what we understand. We will understand only what we are taught. – Baba Dioum\n\nI love Mickey Mouse more than any woman I have ever known. – Walt Disney\n\nThe magic of first love is our ignorance that it can never end. – Benjamin Disraeli\n\nWe are all born for love. It is the principle of existence, and its only end. – Benjamin Disraeli\n\nCome live with me, and be my love,\n\nAnd we will some new pleasures prove\n\nOf golden sands, and crystal brooks,\n\nWith silken lines, and silver hooks. – John Donne\n\nLove, all alike, no season knows, nor clime, nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of time. – John Donne\n\nLove built on beauty, soon as beauty, dies. – John Donne\n\nLove was as subtly caught, as a disease;\n\nBut being got it is a treasure sweet,\n\nwhich to defend is harder than to get:\n\nAnd ought not be profaned on either part,\n\nfor though ‘Tis got by chance, ‘Tis kept by art. – John Donne\n\nBusy old fool, unruly Sun, why dost thou thus through windows and through curtains call on us? Must to thy motions lovers seasons run? – John Donne\n\nTo fail to love is not to exist at all. – Mark Van Doren\n\nLove all that has been created by God, both the whole and every grain of sand. Love every leaf and every ray of light. Love the beasts and the birds, love the plants, love every separate fragment. If you love each fragment, you will understand the mystery of the whole resting in God. – Fyodor Dostoyevsky\n\nOn the last analysis, then, love is life. Love never faileth and life never faileth so long as there is love. – Henry Drummond\n\nTo love abundantly is to live abundantly, and to love forever is to live forever. – Henry Drummond\n\nYou will find as you look back upon your life that the moments when you have truly lived are the moments when you have done things in the spirit of love. – Henry Drummond\n\nLove works a different way in different minds, the fool it enlightens and the wise it blinds. – John Dryden\n\nLove is love’s reward. – John Dryden\n\nLove is not in our choice but in our fate. – John Dryden\n\nWe only love truly once. It is the first time and succeeding passions are less uncontrolled. – Du Coeur\n\nThe pain of love is the pain of being alive. It is a perpetual wound. – Maureen Duffy\n\nArt is not necessary at all. All that is necessary to make this world a better place to live in is to love –to love as Christ loved, as Buddha loved. – Isadora Duncan\n\nIt was the men I deceived the most that I loved the most. – Marguerite Duras\n\nTo love one child and to love all children, whether living or dead –somewhere these two loves come together. To love a no – good but humble punk and to love an honest man who believes himself to be an honest man –somewhere these, too, come together. – Marguerite Duras\n\nIt’s afterwards you realize that the feeling of happiness you had with a man didn’t necessarily prove that you loved him. – Marguerite Duras\n\nIt’s unthinkable not to love –you’d have a severe nervous breakdown. Or you’d have to be Philip Larkin. – Lawrence Durrell\n\nThe richest love is that which submits to the arbitration of time. – Lawrence Durrell\n\nRomantic love, in pornography as in life, is the mythic celebration of female negation. For a woman, love is defined as her willingness to submit to her own annihilation. The proof of love is that she is willing to be destroyed by the one whom she loves, for his sake. For the woman, love is always self – sacrifice, the sacrifice of identity, will, and bodily integrity, in order to fulfill and redeem the masculinity of her lover. – Andrea Dworkin\n\nIt does say if you don’t love your fellow Christians you’re not one in the big book. – James Dye\n\nLove to me is a feeling, to have universal love you have to always feel love no matter what. – James Dye\n\nLove poems are always cliche to me but not to the person it’s for. – James Dye\n\nLove is the ability and willingness to allow those that you care for to be what they choose for themselves, without any insistence that they satisfy you. – Wayne Dyer\n\nThe pleasures of love are pains that become desirable, where sweetness and torment blend, and so love is voluntary insanity, infernal paradise, and celestial hell — in short, harmony of opposite yearnings, sorrowful laughter, soft diamond. – Umberto Eco\n\nYou can’t blame gravity for falling in love. – Albert Einstein\n\nGravitation can not be held responsible for people falling in love – Albert Einstein\n\nA supreme love, a motive that gives a sublime rhythm to a woman’s life, and exalts habit into partnership with the soul’s highest needs, is not to be had where and how she wills. – George Eliot\n\nFor what is love itself, for the one we love best? An enfolding of immeasurable cares which yet are better than any joys outside our love. – George Eliot\n\nBut that intimacy of mutual embarrassment, in which each feels that the other is feeling something, having once existed, its effect is not to be done away with. – George Eliot\n\nLove is most nearly itself when here and now cease to matter. – TS (Thomas Stearns) Eliot\n\nThe art of love … is largely the art of persistence. – Albert Ellis\n\nIf only the strength of the love that people feel when it is reciprocated could be as intense and obsessive as the love we feel when it is not; then marriages would be truly made in heaven. – Ben Elton\n\nIt happened once that a youth and a maiden beheld each other in a public assembly for the first time – Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\nThe moment we indulge our affections, the earth is metamorphosed, there is no winter and no night; all tragedies, all ennui s, vanish, all duties even. – Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\nThe power of love, as the basis of a State, has never been tried. – Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\nLove and you shall be loved. All love is mathematically just, as much as the two sides of an algebraic equation. – Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\nHe who is in love is wise and is becoming wiser, sees newly every time he looks at the object beloved, drawing from it with his eyes and his mind those virtues which it possesses. – Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\nWe don’t believe in rheumatism and true love until after the first attack. – Marie E. Eschenbach\n\nWe always come back to our first love. – Etienne\n\nLove is all we have, the only way that each can help the other. – Euripides\n\nThe hardest of all is learning to be a well of affection, and not a fountain; to show them we love them not when we feel like it, but when they do. – Nan Fairbrother\n\nPeople love others not for who they are, but for how they make them feel. – Irwin Federman\n\nYou talk too much, you laugh too loud, that’s the price of love. – Brian Ferry\n\nA lover, when he is admitted to cards, ought to be solemnly silent, and observe the motions of his mistress. He must laugh when she laughs, sigh when she sighs. In short, he should be the shadow of her mind. A lady, in the presence of her lover, should never want a looking – glass; as a beau, in the presence of his looking – glass, never wants a mistress. – Henry Fielding\n\nI don’t want to live — I want to love first, and live incidentally. – Zelda Fitzgerald\n\nYou couldn’t get a clue during the clue mating season in a field full of horny clues if you smeared your body with clue musk and did the clue mating dance. – Edward Flaherty\n\nOh love will make a dog howl in rhyme. – John Fletcher\n\nThe idea that nations should love one another, or that business concerns or marketing boards should love one another, or that a man in Portugal should love a man in Peru of whom he has never heard –it is absurd, unreal, dangerous. The fact is we can only love what we know personally. And we cannot know much. – E. M. Forster\n\nIt makes no difference how deeply seated may be the trouble, how hopeless the outlook, how muddled the tangle, how great the mistake. A sufficient realization of love will dissolve it all. – Emmet Fox\n\nIf you could only love enough, you could be the most powerful person in the world. – Emmet Fox\n\nLovers who love truly do not write down their happiness. – Anatole France\n\nWell, love is insanity. The ancient Greeks knew that. It is the taking over of a rational and lucid mind by delusion and self – destruction. You lose yourself, you have no power over yourself, you can’t even think straight. – Marilyn French\n\nWe are never so defenseless against suffering as when we love, never so forlornly unhappy as when we have lost our love object or its love. – Sigmund Freud\n\nOne is very crazy when in love. – Sigmund Freud\n\nLove and work are the cornerstones of our humanness. – Sigmund Freud\n\nLove, while you are able to love. – A. Frieligrath\n\nLove is often nothing but a favorable exchange between two people who get the most of what they can expect, considering their value on the personality market. – Erich Fromm\n\nLove is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence. – Erich Fromm\n\nIn love the paradox occurs that two beings become one and yet remain two. – Erich Fromm\n\nLove is staying up all night with a sick child — or a healthy adult. – Sir David Paradine Frost\n\nTwo persons love in one another the future good which they aid one another to unfold. – Margaret Fuller\n\nA coward is incapable of exhibiting love; it is the prerogative of the brave. – Mahatma Gandhi\n\nMy life is an indivisible whole, and all my attitudes run into one another; and they all have their rise in my insatiable love for mankind. – Mahatma Gandhi\n\nNothing is impossible for pure love. – Mahatma Gandhi\n\nWhere there is love there is life. – Mahatma Gandhi\n\nFor it was not into my ear you whispered, but into my heart. It was not my lips you kissed, but my soul. – Judy Garland\n\nWhat then in love can woman do? If we grow fond they shun us. And when we fly them, they pursue: But leave us when they’ve won us. – John Gay\n\nThe chemist who can extract from his heart’s elements, compassion, respect, longing, patience, regret, surprise, and forgiveness and compound them into one can create that atom which is called love. – Kahlil Gibran\n\nLove gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself. Love possesses not nor would it be possessed; For love is sufficient unto love. – Kahlil Gibran\n\nIt is wrong to think that love comes from long companionship and persevering courtship. Love is the offspring of spiritual affinity and unless that affinity is created in a moment, it will not be created for years or even generations. – Kahlil Gibran\n\nEver has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation. – Kahlil Gibran\n\nLove possesses not nor will it be possessed, for love is sufficient unto love. – Kahlil Gibran\n\nLife without love is like a tree without blossoms or fruit. – Kahlil Gibran\n\nThe weight of the world is love. Under the burden of solitude, under the burden of dissatisfaction. – Allen Ginsberg\n\nLove is the irresistible desire to be desired irresistibly. – Louis Ginsberg\n\nWe are shaped and fashioned by what whom we love. – Johann von Goethe\n\nIf I love you, what business is it of yours? – Johann von Goethe\n\nLove is an ideal thing, marriage a real thing; a confusion of the real with the ideal never goes unpunished. – Johann von Goethe\n\nThat is the true season of love; when we believe that we alone can love, that no one could ever have loved as much before, and that no one will ever love in the same way again. – Johann von Goethe\n\nToday I begin to understand what love must be, if it exists. When we are parted, we each feel the lack of the other half of ourselves. We are incomplete like a book in two volumes of which the first has been lost. That is what I imagine love to be: incompleteness in absence. – Edmond de Goncourt\n\nLove is not blind — it sees more, not less. But because it sees more, it is willing to see less. – Rabbi J. Gordon\n\nGod proved His love on the Cross. When Christ hung, and bled, and died, it was God saying to the world, I love you. – Billy Graham\n\nLove, love, love — all the wretched cant of it, masking egotism, lust, masochism, fantasy under a mythology of sentimental postures, a welter of self – induced miseries and joys, blinding and masking the essential personalities in the frozen gestures of courtship, in the kissing and the dating and the desire, the compliments and the quarrels which vivify its barrenness. – Germaine Greer\n\nLove is a snowmobile racing across the tundra and then suddenly it flips over, pinning you underneath. At night, the ice weasels come. – Matt Groening\n\nLove is a perky elf dancing a merry little jig and then suddenly he turns on you with a miniature machine gun. – Matt Groening\n\nTwo separate, distinct personalities, not separate at all, but inextricably bound, soul and body and mind, to each other, how did we get so far apart so fast? – Judith Guest\n\nAny woman who thinks the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach is aiming about 10 inches too high. – Adrienne Gusoff\n\nOnly the words of love kept alive are worthy of not being wasted – Arlo Guthrie\n\nLove is a gift from God, and as we obey His laws and genuinely learn to serve others, we develop God’s love in our lives. Love of God is the means of unlocking divine powers which help us to live worthily and to overcome the world. – David B. Haight\n\nWe really have to understand the person we want to love. If our love is only a will to possess, it is not love. If we only think of ourselves, if we know only our own needs and ignore the needs of the other person, we cannot love. – Thich Nhat Hanh\n\nLove is the final end of the world’s history, the Amen of the universe. – Novalis Hardenberg\n\nA lover without indiscretion is no lover at all. Circumspection and devotion are a contradiction in terms. – Thomas Hardy\n\nPeople need loving the most when they deserve it the least. – John Harrigan\n\nLove is misunderstood to be an emotion; actually, it is a state of awareness, a way of being in the world, a way of seeing oneself and others. – David R. Hawkins\n\nLove is the great miracle cure. Loving ourselves works miracles in our lives. – Louise L. Hay\n\nThe story of a love is not important — what is important is that one is capable of love. It is perhaps the only glimpse we are permitted of eternity. – Helen Hayes\n\nThere is only one terminal dignity — love. – Helen Hayes\n\nThe love of liberty is the love of others; the love of power is the love of ourselves. We cannot force love. – William Hazlitt\n\nI do not think that what is called Love at first sight is so great an absurdity as it is sometimes imagined to be. We generally make up our minds beforehand to the sort of person we should like, grave or gay, black, brown, or fair; with golden tresses or raven locks; — and when we meet with a complete example of the qualities we admire, the bargain is soon struck. – William Hazlitt\n\nOne would always want to think of oneself as being on the side of love, ready to recognize it and wish it well –but, when confronted with it in others, one so often resented it, questioned its true nature, secretly dismissed the particular instance as folly or promiscuity. Was it merely jealousy, or a reluctance to admit so noble and enviable a sentiment in anyone but oneself? – Shirley Hazzard\n\nLove is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own. – Robert A. Heinlein\n\nMadame, it is an old word and each one takes it new and wears it out himself. It is a word that fills with meaning as a bladder with air and the meaning goes out of it as quickly. It may be punctured as a bladder is punctured and patched and blown up again and if you have not had it does not exist for you. All people talk of it, but those who have had it are marked by it, and I would not wish to speak of it further since of all things it is the most ridiculous to talk of and only fools go through it many times. – Ernest Hemingway\n\nOnly the really plain people know about love –the very fascinating ones try so hard to create an impression that they very soon exhaust their talents. – Katharine Hepburn\n\nLove has nothing to do with what you are expecting to get–only with what you are expecting to give–which is everything. – Katharine Hepburn\n\nLove and a cough cannot be hid. – George Herbert\n\nThose that embrace the entire universe with love, for the most part love nothing, but their narrow selves. – Johann Gottfried Von Herder\n\nLove is like a fruit. It may look good, but you shouldn’t bite in it until it’s ripe. – Nick Hertl\n\nLove is stronger than violence. – Hermann Hesse\n\nLove is only the game that is not called on account of darkness. – Mangnu Hirschfield\n\nLove is a conflict between reflexes and reflections. – Mangnu Hirschfield\n\nLove is like pi — natural, irrational, and very important. – Lisa Hoffman\n\nThe choicest thing this world has for a man is affection. – Josiah Gilbert Holland\n\nLove is the master key which opens the gates of happiness. – Oliver Wendell Holmes\n\nWhere we love is home, home that our feet may leave, but not our hearts. – Oliver Wendell Holmes\n\nSubdue your passion or it will subdue you. – Horace\n\nLove is seeing without eyes, hearing without ears; hatred is nothing. – Doug Horton\n\nIf you love something let it go free. If it doesn’t come back, you never had it. If it comes back, love it forever. – Doug Horton\n\nLove is a given, hatred is acquired. – Doug Horton\n\nIf a woman doesn’t chase a man a little, she doesn’t love him. – Edward W. Howe\n\nLife in abundance comes only through great love. – Elbert Hubbard\n\nLovers are fools, but Nature makes them so. – Elbert Hubbard\n\nThe love we give away is the only love we keep. – Elbert Hubbard\n\nI met in the street a very poor young man who was in love. His hat was old, his coat worn, his cloak was out at the elbows, the water passed through his shoes — and the stars through his soul. – Victor Hugo\n\nLife is the flower for which love is the honey. – Victor Hugo\n\nTo love another person is to see the face of God. – Victor Hugo\n\nThe supreme happiness in life is the conviction that we are loved — loved for ourselves, or rather, loved in spite of ourselves. – Victor Hugo\n\nThe supreme happiness in life is the conviction that we are loved. – Victor Hugo\n\nAffection, like melancholy, magnifies trifles; but the magnifying of the one is like looking through a telescope at heavenly objects; that of the other, like enlarging monsters with a microscope. – Leigh Hunt\n\nLove, I find, is like singing. Everybody can do enough to satisfy themselves, though it may not impress the neighbors as being very much. – Zora Neale Hurston\n\nDive deep, O mind, dive deep in the ocean of God’s beauty! If you descend to the uttermost depths, there you will find the gem of love. – Bengali Hymn\n\nLove is the only bow of life’s dark cloud. It is the Morning and Evening Star. It shines upon the cradle of the babe, and sheds its radiance upon the quiet tomb. It is the Mother of Art, inspirer of poet, patriot, and philosopher. It is the air and light of every heart, builder of every home, kinder of every fire on every hearth, It was the first dream of immortality. It fills the world with melody. Love is the magician, the enchanter, that changes worthless things to joy, and makes right royal kings of common clay. – Robert G. Ingersoll\n\nI would rather live and love where death is king than have eternal life where love is not. – Robert G. Ingersoll\n\nA woman’s life is a history of the affections. – Washington Irving\n\nLove is never lost. If not reciprocated, it will flow back and soften and purify the heart. – Washington Irving\n\nLove is the total absence of fear. Love asks no questions. Its natural state is one of extension and expansion, not comparison and measurement. – Gerald G. Jampolsky\n\nLove can sometimes be magic. But magic can sometimes…just be an illusion. – Javan\n\nNothing is more beautiful than the love that has weathered the storms of life. The love of the young for the young, that is the beginning of life. But the love of the old for the old, that is the beginning of things longer. – Jerome K. Jerome\n\nPerhaps the most important reason for self – disclosure is that without it we cannot truly love. – Sidney Jourard\n\nLove (understood as the desire of good for another) is in fact so unnatural a phenomenon that it can scarcely repeat itself, the soul being unable to become virgin again and not having energy enough to cast itself out again into the ocean of another’s soul. – James Joyce\n\nLove is as much of an object as an obsession, everybody wants it, everybody seeks it, but few ever achieve it, those who do will cherish it, be lost in it, and among all, never… never forget it. – Curtis Judalet\n\nWhere love rules, there is no will to power; where power predominates, there love is lacking.

While the former delights in extremes and opposites, the latter demands equality. – Madame de Maintenon\n\nNowadays men cannot love seven night but they must have all their desires: that love may not endure by reason; for where they be soon accorded and hasty, heat soon it cooleth.
