        "text": "Nueva York is an Emmy award winning series about Latino culture in New York. The 30-minute show explores the rich textures of Latino society in the city, focusing on politics, art, culture, and the traditions of Spanish-speaking populations across the metropolitan area.\n\nEach episode features prominent leaders from the tri-state area's cultural and public spheres sharing their thoughts and accomplishments with viewers. Interviews are hosted by Mexican novelist and critic Carmen Boullosa and Chilean journalist and writer Patricio Lerzundi. The general producer is Professor Jerry Carlson, specialist in Latin American cinema. They are all members of the academic staff at CUNY. The series is produced by bilingual professionals from Colombia, Guatemala, Massachusetts, Mexico, and Texas. In addition, the series offers documentary segments about events, exhibits, concerts, and institutions.\n\nSince its first broadcast, Nueva York has built cultural and social ties between Latinos, and amongst Spanish speaking non-Latino communities. Each episode is subtitled in English so that the largest numbers of viewers may appreciate more fully the richness and diversity of the cultural and humanitarian expression of the Spanish-speaking communities in the city. It is a television program that seeks to present the image of the social, educational and economic aspirations of the generations of immigrants and emigrants who have sought a better quality of life for themselves and their families. Nueva York won a New York Emmy in 2009, and two more in 2010. The series premiered on CUNY TV on October 6, 2005. Nueva York also airs on Channel 22 in Mexico, and Channel 11 in Panama."
