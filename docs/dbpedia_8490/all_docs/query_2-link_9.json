        "text": "Can I take more than one workshop per semester?\n\nThe Written Arts Program does not allow students to take two or more workshops concurrently. This restriction applies to workshops, such as playwriting or screenwriting, that are offered by other programs. We think workshops are exceedingly valuable, and most of our written arts students have taken several by the time they graduate, either in a single genre or multiple genres; but we firmly believe that the content of oneâ€™s creative work must draw from the entire palette of liberal arts education.\n\nCan I take workshops in more than one genre?\n\nThe Written Arts Program encourages students to practice their creative work in as many genres as they feel inspired to sample, given that a fiction writer is enriched by close study of poetry and vice versa, etc. However, a written arts student should be mindful that permission to embark on a creative Senior Project will be dependent upon demonstrated proficiency in the genre of the intended project. In addition, we encourage you to work with your adviser in determining the college-wide requirements when you are contemplating taking a workshop.\n\nCan I take a workshop more than once?\n\nA workshop can be repeated for credit, even with the same instructor. However, the program encourages students to work with as many different instructors as possible.\n\nThe exception to this rule is Level I workshops. You may not take a Level I workshop more than once, and you may not take a Level I workshop if you have already taken a workshop in that genre. For example, you may not take Fiction I twice, and you may not take Poetry I if you have already taken Poetry Practicum."
