        "text": "Just as a mother with her own life\n\nProtects her child, her only child, from harm,\n\nSo within yourself let grow\n\nA boundless love for all creatures.\n\nLet your love flow outward through the universe,\n\nTo its height, its depth, its broad extent,\n\nA limitless love, without hatred or enmity.\n\nThen as you stand or walk,\n\nSit or lie down,\n\nAs long as you are awake,\n\nStrive for this with a one-pointed mind;\n\nYour life will bring heaven to earth.\n\nLoveSource\n\n• Buddha Discourse on Goodwill, From the Metta Sutta, part of the Sutta Nipata, a collection of dialogues with the Buddha said to be among the oldest parts of the Pali Buddhist canon.\n\n• Source: Wikiquote: \"Love\" (B)\n\nInterviewer: I read a post on the Internet from a young girl who had been victimized by someone and her position was like, \"I can talk about this now because Fiona Apple can talk about what happened to her.\" Do you look at yourself as a role model for women and girls who've had this experience?\n\nFiona: That's the only reason I ever brought the whole rape thing up. It's a terrible thing, but it happens to so many people. I mean, 80 percent of the people I've told have said right back to me, \"That happened to me too.\" It's so common, and so ridiculous that it's a hard thing to talk about. It angers me so much because something like that happens to you and you carry it around for the rest of your life. No matter how much therapy you go through, no matter how much healing you go through, it's part of you. I just feel that it's such a tragedy that so many people have to bear the extra burden of having to keep it secret from everyone else. As if it's too icky a subject to burden other people with and everyone's going to think you're a victim forever. Then you've labeled yourself a victim, and you've been taken advantage of, and you're ruined, and you're soiled, and you're not pure, you know.\n\nIf I'm in a position where people are looking up to me in any way, then it's absolutely my responsibility to be open and honest about this, because if I'm not, what does that say to people? It doesn't change a person -- well, it does change a person but it doesn't take anything away from you. It can only strengthen you. It has made me so angry in the past. Like I wanted to say it to somebody. I really wanted somebody to connect with, somebody to understand me, somebody to comfort me. But I felt like I couldn't say anything about because it was taboo to talk about.\n\nFiona AppleSource\n\n• Nuvo, \"Fiona Apple: The NUVO Interview\" April [1997]\n\n• Source: Wikiquote: \"Fiona Apple\" (Quotes)"
