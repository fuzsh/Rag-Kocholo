        "text": "I should have admitted more often how little I knew, and more teachers would have appeared. I should have known that suffering shouldn’t be suppressed, because suffering is a great teacher.\n\n– Marlon Brando\n\nOur questions (in second half of life) may now be different from before, asking, for instance, if we cultivated a great love, great friends, and found a passion for life? Have we made a contribution to the human condition? Have we done what we needed to do?\n\n– Michael Conforti\n\nThe job of the elder is to be nuttier, more curious, occasionally fierce and more connected to the eccentricities of wildness than the youth ever dreamed. More than anything, the elder has seen some rough pattern to their life and knows how to express it through a story. This carries tremendous hope with it.\n\n– Martin Shaw\n\nIf you want to find some pure, untouched place in the world where the troubles of our times and the struggles of being human do not appear, where everyone is kind, loving, always honest, respectful and no one ever gets hurt and where you can be totally safe, you will not only look in vain but you will bring your childish fantasies of this Utopia with you and burden those in every place you find with your disappointments that they didn’t live up to them.\n\nEvery person you meet and fall for ends up becoming a disappointment to you – they let you down because they weren’t perfect, they have their flaws. Each new person you meet, you think, “This might be them! Finally, I’ve met someone who is different! They’re not like all the others.” And then the betrayal.\n\nEvery time, the words escape our lips, “You are not what I had hoped you would be.”\n\nEvery ashram becomes a sham. Every new job is full of flaws. Every indigenous community a heartbreak. Every spiritual teacher a fraud. Every new potential and actual lover a discouraging disaster. Every new, would-be-friend and ally full of unbearable contradictions. Every time, the words escape our lips, “You are not what I had hoped you would be.” And, of course, the whole thing is heartbreaking.\n\nAnd so reality, the way the world is and the people in it are, becomes a constant betrayal. But the betrayal is a necessary one. It’s the betrayal that asks us to stop being children about the whole thing complaining that this world isn’t what we hoped it would be.\n\n“What is it that you wanted to be before the world made you into this?”\n\nYou’ll make the world wrong for being the way it is and take the current state of reality as a personal affront to yourself and people like you. But, if you want a better tomorrow and you’re willing to meet the world as it is and are willing to do the impossibly hard work of loving it by learning the deeper story of how it came to be the way it is, if you’re willing to ask every troubling thing you come across, “What is it that you wanted to be before the world made you into this?” then things may begin to change.\n\n– Tad Hargrave\n\nMiracles\n\nby Giannina Braschi\n\n—There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed in your\n\nphilosophy.\n\n—Like what?\n\n—Like miracles—like changes of power—like changes in climate—like\n\npolitical climates collapsing like polar ice caps—like the dungeon becoming\n\nthe crown and the crown the dungeon—like not paying attention to\n\nbullies—like superpowers running out of fuel—like finding oil in the\n\ndungeon of liberty—like the dungeon of liberty becoming a gold mine—like\n\nuseless poets changing the way the world thinks and sings—like a voice\n\ncoming out of the dungeon—a useless voice that has something to say but\n\ndoesn’t know how to market it—like finding yourself for the first time\n\nhappy—even though you’re in prison. Like finding camaraderie and\n\nsolidarity among friends you never thought could be your friends. Like\n\nunderstanding the other—not loving the other—but putting yourself in the\n\nshoes of the other—not to take their position—not to steal what the other\n\nhas—but to feel what the other feels—to appreciate his thoughts. Not to be\n\nironic—clever—smart—but to be profound—not to be the boss who puts\n\neverybody down—but to be the leader of a chorus of voices—each and\n\nevery single one of them having their own point of view—like\n\nsaying—stop being a predicate and become a subject.\n\nMay this be the season you stop acting like vinegar is water.\n\n– Dr. Thema\n\nMay you heal so much your taste changes.\n\n– Dr. Thema\n\nYou have two birth-places. You have the place where you were really born and then you have a place of predilection where you really wake up to reality.\n\n– Lawrence Durrell\n\nPain cannot be kept intact, it needs to be “processed,” converted into humour.\n\n– Annie Ernaux\n\nYou will be pursued by problems, one after the other, with their constant annoyance and pain, if you don’t understand who is the creator of problems.\n\n– Krishnamurti\n\nAmong The Multitudes\n\nI am who I am.\n\nA coincidence no less unthinkable\n\nthan any other.\n\nI could have different\n\nancestors, after all.\n\nI could have fluttered\n\nfrom another nest\n\nor crawled bescaled\n\nfrom another tree.\n\nNature’s wardrobe\n\nholds a fair supply of costumes:\n\nspider, seagull, fieldmouse.\n\nEach fits perfectly right off\n\nand is dutifully worn\n\ninto shreds.\n\nI didn’t get a choice either,\n\nbut I can’t complain.\n\nI could have been someone\n\nmuch less separate.\n\nSomeone from an anthill, shoal, or buzzing swarm,\n\nan inch of landscape ruffled by the wind.\n\nSomeone much less fortunate,\n\nbred for my fur\n\nor Christmas dinner,\n\nsomething swimming under a square of glass.\n\nA tree rooted to the ground\n\nas the fire draws near.\n\nA grass blade trampled by a stampede\n\nof incomprehensible events.\n\nA shady type whose darkness\n\ndazzled some.\n\nWhat if I’d prompted only fear,\n\nloathing,\n\nor pity?\n\nIf I’d been born\n\nin the wrong tribe\n\nwith all roads closed before me?\n\nFate has been kind\n\nto me thus far.\n\nI might never have been given\n\nthe memory of happy moments.\n\nMy yen for comparison\n\nmight have been taken away.\n\nI might have been myself minus amazement,\n\nthat is,\n\nsomeone completely different.\n\n– Wislawa Szymborska\n\nA person who is lucidly aware of the miracles that surround him, who has learned to bear up under the loneliness, has made quite a bit of progress on the road to wisdom.\n\n– M.C. Escher\n\nOngoing\n\nNever mind the distances traveled, the companion\n\nshe made of herself. The threadbare twenties not\n\nto be underestimated. A wild depression that ripped\n\nfrom January into April. And still she sprouts an appetite.\n\nInsisting on edges and cores, when there were none.\n\nRelationships annealed through shared ambivalences.\n\nPages that steadied her. Books that prowled her\n\nuntil the hard daybreak, and for months after.\n\nSeparating new vows from the old, like laundry whites.\n\nSmall losses jammed together so as to gather mass.\n\nStored generations of filtered quietude.\n\nAnd some stubbornness. Tangles along the way\n\nthe comb-teeth of the mind had to bite through, but for what.\n\nShe had trained herself to look for answers at eye level,\n\nbut they were lower, they were changing all the time.\n\n– Jenny Xie\n\n…In a soiled, blighted world poetry was a thing set apart…\n\n– Gregory Corso\n\nYang, the light, active, masculine principle, and Yin, the dark, passive, and feminine, in their interaction underlie and constitute the whole world of forms (“the 10,000 things”). They proceed from and together make manifest Tao: the source and law of being.\n\n– Joseph Campbell\n\nhunter moon\n\nclear autumn night\n\neverywhere a new sign\n\n– Ogawa\n\nChristianity isn’t a failure; it just hasn’t been tried yet.\n\n– G.K. Chesterton\n\nIt’s all about how the words are used, not the words themselves. People who are hung up on tiny fragments of language, on single words and phrases, and who are intimidated or angered by them while ignoring the whole of the conversation, are shallow thinkers, superficial censors with no interest in the ideas, only in channeling a conversation along narrow avenues that will not burst out beyond the circumscribed boundaries of their sense of propriety.\n\n– P. Z. Myers\n\nthe gods will offer you chances. / know them. / take them.\n\n– Charles Bukowski\n\nThe land of healing lies within, radiant with the happiness that is blindly sought in a thousand outer directions.\n\n– Swami Vivekananda\n\nPeople recover differently. Some change cities, some fall in love and some begin writing.\n\n– Kanza Javed\n\nWe are listening for a sound\n\nbeyond us, beyond sound,\n\nsearching for a lighthouse\n\nin the breakwaters of our uncertainty,\n\nan electronic murmur,\n\na bright, fragile I am.\n\n– Diane Ackerman\n\nCulture, then, only truly becomes culture when it is embodied in someone.\n\n– László Krasznahorkai\n\nDemocracy is the great religion of the West – probably the greatest religion because it affirms other religions; probably the greatest culture because it affirms other cultures. But it’s based on faith, it’s based on appetite for fraternity, it’s based on love, and therefore it shares the characteristics of a religious movement. It’s also like a religion in that it’s never really been tried.\n\n– Leonard Cohen\n\n… we must pay much closer attention to the things we have heard, so that we do not drift away from the truth.\n\n– Hebrews 2:1\n\nMuch of Earth’s life moves and communicates on a time scale humans cannot hope to comprehend\n\n– Moshe Feldenkrais\n\nA lot of people think that Christianity is you doing all the righteous things you hate and avoiding all the wicked things you love in order to go to Heaven. No, that’s a lost man with religion. A Christian is a person whose heart has been changed; they have new affections.\n\n– Paul Washer\n\nRarely, if ever, are any of us healed in isolation.\n\nHealing is an act of communion.\n\n– bell hooks\n\nCourage consists, however, in agreeing to flee rather than live tranquilly and hypocritically in false refuges. Values, morals, homelands, religions, and these private certitudes that our vanity and our complacency bestow generously on us, have many deceptive sojourns as the world arranges for those who think they are standing straight and at ease, among stable things.\n\n– Gilles Deleuze\n\nFor apart from inquiry, apart from the praxis, individuals cannot be truly human. Knowledge emerges only through invention and re-invention, through the restless, impatient, continuing, hopeful inquiry human beings pursue in the world, with the world, and with each other.\n\n– Paulo Freire\n\nThere can be no rebirth without a dark night of the soul, a total annihilation of all that you believed in and thought that you were.\n\n– Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan\n\nAn artist is a provincial who finds himself somewhere between a physical reality and a metaphysical one. It’s this in-between that I’m calling a province, this frontier country between the tangible world and the intangible one. That is the realm of the artist.\n\n– Federico Fellini\n\nOpinion is really the lowest form of human knowledge. It requires no accountability, no understanding. The highest form of knowledge…is empathy, for it requires us to suspend our egos and live in another’s world. It requires purposes larger than self-centered understandings.\n\n– Bill Bullard\n\nAll art is a kind of confession, more or less oblique.\n\nall artists, if they are to survive, are forced, at last,\n\nto tell the whole story, to vomit the anguish up.\n\n– James Baldwin\n\nWe are aberrations—beings born undead, neither one thing nor another, or two things at once … uncanny things that have nothing to do with the rest of creation, horrors that poison the world by sowing our madness everywhere we go, glutting daylight and darkness with incorporeal obscenities.\n\n– Thomas Ligotti\n\nHuman consciousness does not emerge at any depth except through struggling with our shadow. It is in facing our conflicts, criticisms, and contradictions that we grow. It is in the struggle with our shadow self, with failure, or with wounding that we break into higher levels of consciousness. People who learn to expose, name, and still thrive inside the contradictions are people I would call prophets.\n\n– Richard Rohr\n\nStevens’s ‘After the Final No’\n\nThe Well Dressed Man With A Beard\n\nAfter the final no there comes a yes\n\nAnd on that yes the future world depends.\n\nNo was the night. Yes is this present sun.\n\nIf the rejected things, the things denied,\n\nSlid over the western cataract, yet one,\n\nOne only, one thing that was firm, even\n\nNo greater than a cricket’s horn, no more\n\nThan a thought to be rehearsed all day, a speech\n\nOf the self that must sustain itself on speech,\n\nOne thing remaining, infallible, would be\n\nEnough. Ah! douce campagna of that thing!\n\nAh! douce campagna, honey in the heart,\n\nGreen in the body, out of a petty phrase,\n\nOut of a thing believed, a thing affirmed:\n\nThe form on the pillow humming while one sleeps,\n\nThe aureole above the humming house…\n\nIt can never be satisfied, the mind, never.\n\n– Wallace Stevens\n\nSpace opens and from the heart of the matter\n\nsheds a descending grace that makes\n\nfor a moment, that naked thing, Being,\n\na thing to understand.\n\n– Norman MacCaig\n\nTo feel affection for people even when they make mistakes is uniquely human. You can do it, if you simply recognize: that they’re human too, that they act out of ignorance, against their will, and that you’ll both be dead before long. And, above all, that they haven’t really hurt you. They haven’t diminished your ability to choose.\n\n– Marcus Aurelius\n\nTV makes it so easy to postpone living for another half hour\n\n– Bill McKibben\n\nMy purpose is a language that can make us whole,\n\nthough mortal, ignorant, and small.\n\nThe world is whole beyond human knowing.\n\nThe body’s life is its own, untouched\n\nby the little clockwork of explanation.\n\nI approve of death, when it comes in time\n\nto the old. I don’t want to live\n\non mortal terms forever, or survive\n\nan hour as a cooling stew of pieces\n\nof other people. I don’t believe that life\n\nor knowledge can be given by machines.\n\nThe machine economy has set afire\n\nthe household of the human soul,\n\nand all the creatures are burning with it.\n\n– Wendell Berry\n\nOnce there were brook trout in the streams in the mountains. You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand. Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.\n\n– Cormac McCarthy\n\nFriendship is on my mind these days.\n\nThis rings really true for me.\n\nHow ’bout you?\n\nan irreplaceable friend is someone who:\n\nhighly values your trust\n\nnaturally feels like family\n\nappreciates your honesty\n\nstill loves you as you change\n\nfinds it easy to laugh with you\n\nholds space for you in tough times\n\nsupports your happiness and safety\n\ninspires you to love and know yourself\n\nhelps you not question your self-worth\n\n– yung pueblo\n\nDon’t rock me awake again;\n\nI dream of thunderstorms and wildfires,\n\nand can hear a novice orchestra\n\nplay a terrible melody.\n\nAt midnight,\n\nI say goodbye to the neon lights;\n\nI unconsciously walk around downtown;\n\nsearching for a pure heart.\n\nWhen this world finally collapses\n\nlike half-finished origami,\n\nonly then would I understand human mercy,\n\nas if I could enter a dream again.\n\n– Elda Mengisto\n\nSuppose the stars are just our grief reflected back to us, / proof that grief sometimes forgets its source.\n\n– Victoria Chang\n\nLegend tells us that Alexander wept when he reached the Ganges, for there was no further world to conquer. Apparently it had not occurred to him that there was also a world within of infinite scope and mystery.\n\n– James Hollis\n\nI am as afraid of normal people as I am of psychotics. More even of “normals”—because of the repression. It’s the neurotics, as we tend to call them, I am most at home with.\n\n– James Hillman\n\nStabilize where you are & expansion will naturally occur.\n\nStraining to expand is itself contraction.\n\n– @VinceFHorn\n\nNo day copies yesterday,\n\nno two nights will teach what bliss is\n\nin precisely the same way,\n\nwith precisely the same kisses.\n\n– Wislawa Szymborska\n\nWhat I needed with all my starved and silent soul was just that particular way of shouting back at the world.\n\n– Iris Murdoch\n\nBillions suffer & die if planet devouring growth capitalism continues.\n\nBillions suffer & die if planet devouring growth capitalism collapses.\n\nThis is the perversity of capitalism, & why there are zero good reasons not to urgently transition to a new economic system.\n\n– @ClimateDad77\n\nWhen people confess to not reading by choice (early or late in their writing life!) my souls SQUIRMS for them.\n\n– @hmvanderhart\n\nWriting a haiku\n\nMulling over the first line\n\nAnd then the second.\n\n– Sarita Talwai\n\nNothing is less real than realism. Details are confusing. It is only by selection, by elimination, by emphasis, that we get at the real meaning of things.\n\n– Georgia O’Keeffe\n\nmy own brain is to me the most unaccountable of machinery – always buzzing, humming, soaring roaring diving, and then buried in mud. and why? what’s this passion for?\n\n– virginia woolf\n\nThe older I get the more complicated the past gets— the simplest times show themselves not to have been simple at all.\n\n– sven birkerts\n\nI’ve thrown this book across the room and picked it up, you know, and then walked down the steps laughing.\n\n– Sonia Sanchez on Toni Morrison’s The Bluest Eye\n\nLife is a very simple matter. …But we add extra tension all the time. If you stop and feel your face, you’ll notice it’s usually a little bit tight. We don’t need that tension. We have a face; we don’t need to have an extra face.\n\n– Charlotte Joko Beck\n\nThe mind of the beginner is empty, free of the habits of the expert, ready to accept, to doubt, open to all possibilities.\n\n– Shunryu Suzuki\n\nHeartbreaks, disappointments and even our own weaknesses can serve as stepping-stones to the second half of life transformation. Failings are the foundation for growth. Those who have fallen, failed or ‘gone down’ are the only ones who understand ‘up.’\n\n– Richard Rohr\n\nThere are two perfumes to a book. If a book is new, it smells great. If a book is old, it smells even better. It smells like ancient Egypt.\n\n– Ray Bradbury\n\nMy secret talent is my ability to tell within five pages if an author was raised catholic.\n\n– Emma Bolden\n\nWords melt in reflections; that’s why there’s a uselessness to this night, to my missing the river, to the delaying of love…\n\n– Etel Adnan\n\nWhite supremacy is a comprehensive cultural education whose primary function is to prevent people from reading—engaging with, understanding—the lives of people outside its scope.\n\n– Elaine Castillo\n\n…because sleep is an elusive magical healing place for people with chronic pain.\n\n– Sonya Huber\n\nWhom are we to love?\n\nHow many and what for?\n\n[…]\n\nThis is a prayer, plaint, wish,\n\nhowl of void beneath breastbone.\n\nDreams, soul chasers, bring\n\nback my heart alive.\n\n– Jim Harrison\n\nTrying to find a world to feel\n\nthat feels like the world again.\n\n– Leonard Cohen\n\nI wanted to drag a few words out of silence then sleep and none were what I truly wanted. So much silence and so many words.\n\n– Jim Harrison\n\nIn her youth she ran on the mountains and something of their wildness is still in her speech.\n\n– Nan Shepherd\n\nHow to Be Perfect\n\nBY RON PADGETT\n\nEverything is perfect, dear friend.\n\n– KEROUAC\n\nGet some sleep.\n\nDon’t give advice.\n\nTake care of your teeth and gums.\n\nDon’t be afraid of anything beyond your control. Don’t be afraid, for\n\ninstance, that the building will collapse as you sleep, or that someone\n\nyou love will suddenly drop dead.\n\nEat an orange every morning.\n\nBe friendly. It will help make you happy.\n\nRaise your pulse rate to 120 beats per minute for 20 straight minutes\n\nfour or five times a week doing anything you enjoy.\n\nHope for everything. Expect nothing.\n\nTake care of things close to home first. Straighten up your room\n\nbefore you save the world. Then save the world.\n\nKnow that the desire to be perfect is probably the veiled expression\n\nof another desire—to be loved, perhaps, or not to die.\n\nMake eye contact with a tree.\n\nBe skeptical about all opinions, but try to see some value in each of\n\nthem.\n\nDress in a way that pleases both you and those around you.\n\nDo not speak quickly.\n\nLearn something every day. (Dzien dobre!)\n\nBe nice to people before they have a chance to behave badly.\n\nDon’t stay angry about anything for more than a week, but don’t\n\nforget what made you angry. Hold your anger out at arm’s length\n\nand look at it, as if it were a glass ball. Then add it to your glass ball\n\ncollection.\n\nBe loyal.\n\nWear comfortable shoes.\n\nDesign your activities so that they show a pleasing balance\n\nand variety.\n\nBe kind to old people, even when they are obnoxious. When you\n\nbecome old, be kind to young people. Do not throw your cane at\n\nthem when they call you Grandpa. They are your grandchildren!\n\nLive with an animal.\n\nDo not spend too much time with large groups of people.\n\nIf you need help, ask for it.\n\nCultivate good posture until it becomes natural.\n\nIf someone murders your child, get a shotgun and blow his head off.\n\nPlan your day so you never have to rush.\n\nShow your appreciation to people who do things for you, even if you\n\nhave paid them, even if they do favors you don’t want.\n\nDo not waste money you could be giving to those who need it.\n\nExpect society to be defective. Then weep when you find that it is far\n\nmore defective than you imagined.\n\nWhen you borrow something, return it in an even better condition.\n\nAs much as possible, use wooden objects instead of plastic or metal\n\nones.\n\nLook at that bird over there.\n\nAfter dinner, wash the dishes.\n\nCalm down.\n\nVisit foreign countries, except those whose inhabitants have\n\nexpressed a desire to kill you.\n\nDon’t expect your children to love you, so they can, if they want to.\n\nMeditate on the spiritual. Then go a little further, if you feel like it.\n\nWhat is out (in) there?\n\nSing, every once in a while.\n\nBe on time, but if you are late do not give a detailed and lengthy\n\nexcuse.\n\nDon’t be too self-critical or too self-congratulatory.\n\nDon’t think that progress exists. It doesn’t.\n\nWalk upstairs.\n\nDo not practice cannibalism.\n\nImagine what you would like to see happen, and then don’t do\n\nanything to make it impossible.\n\nTake your phone off the hook at least twice a week.\n\nKeep your windows clean.\n\nExtirpate all traces of personal ambitiousness.\n\nDon’t use the word extirpate too often.\n\nForgive your country every once in a while. If that is not possible, go\n\nto another one.\n\nIf you feel tired, rest.\n\nGrow something.\n\nDo not wander through train stations muttering, “We’re all going to\n\ndie!”\n\nCount among your true friends people of various stations of life.\n\nAppreciate simple pleasures, such as the pleasure of chewing, the\n\npleasure of warm water running down your back, the pleasure of a\n\ncool breeze, the pleasure of falling asleep.\n\nDo not exclaim, “Isn’t technology wonderful!”\n\nLearn how to stretch your muscles. Stretch them every day.\n\nDon’t be depressed about growing older. It will make you feel even\n\nolder. Which is depressing.\n\nDo one thing at a time.\n\nIf you burn your finger, put it in cold water immediately. If you bang\n\nyour finger with a hammer, hold your hand in the air for twenty\n\nminutes. You will be surprised by the curative powers of coldness and\n\ngravity.\n\nLearn how to whistle at earsplitting volume.\n\nBe calm in a crisis. The more critical the situation, the calmer you\n\nshould be.\n\nEnjoy sex, but don’t become obsessed with it. Except for brief periods\n\nin your adolescence, youth, middle age, and old age.\n\nContemplate everything’s opposite.\n\nIf you’re struck with the fear that you’ve swum out too far in the\n\nocean, turn around and go back to the lifeboat.\n\nKeep your childish self alive.\n\nAnswer letters promptly. Use attractive stamps, like the one with a\n\ntornado on it.\n\nCry every once in a while, but only when alone. Then appreciate\n\nhow much better you feel. Don’t be embarrassed about feeling better.\n\nDo not inhale smoke.\n\nTake a deep breath.\n\nDo not smart off to a policeman.\n\nDo not step off the curb until you can walk all the way across the\n\nstreet. From the curb you can study the pedestrians who are trapped\n\nin the middle of the crazed and roaring traffic.\n\nBe good.\n\nWalk down different streets.\n\nBackwards.\n\nRemember beauty, which exists, and truth, which does not. Notice\n\nthat the idea of truth is just as powerful as the idea of beauty.\n\nStay out of jail.\n\nIn later life, become a mystic.\n\nUse Colgate toothpaste in the new Tartar Control formula.\n\nVisit friends and acquaintances in the hospital. When you feel it is\n\ntime to leave, do so.\n\nBe honest with yourself, diplomatic with others.\n\nDo not go crazy a lot. It’s a waste of time.\n\nRead and reread great books.\n\nDig a hole with a shovel.\n\nIn winter, before you go to bed, humidify your bedroom.\n\nKnow that the only perfect things are a 300 game in bowling and a\n\n27-batter, 27-out game in baseball.\n\nDrink plenty of water. When asked what you would like to drink,\n\nsay, “Water, please.”\n\nAsk “Where is the loo?” but not “Where can I urinate?”\n\nBe kind to physical objects.\n\nBeginning at age forty, get a complete “physical” every few years\n\nfrom a doctor you trust and feel comfortable with.\n\nDon’t read the newspaper more than once a year.\n\nLearn how to say “hello,” “thank you,” and “chopsticks”\n\nin Mandarin.\n\nBelch and fart, but quietly.\n\nBe especially cordial to foreigners.\n\nSee shadow puppet plays and imagine that you are one of the\n\ncharacters. Or all of them.\n\nTake out the trash.\n\nLove life.\n\nUse exact change.\n\nWhen there’s shooting in the street, don’t go near the window.\n\nThat is why it is not enough to remove oneself from people, not enough to go somewhere else. We have to remove ourselves from the habits of the populace that are within us. We have to isolate our own self and return it to our possession. We carry our chains with us; we are not entirely free. We keep returning our gaze to the things we have left behind; we fantasize about them constantly.\n\n– Montaigne, On Solitude\n\nPoems are selfish,\n\nalways demanding attention,\n\ntugging, pulling, asking, wanting.\n\nThe page, the pen,\n\nthis world, its hunger.\n\n– Ebony Stewart\n\nMy role in society, or any artist’s or poet’s role, is to try and express what we all feel. Not to tell people how to feel. Not as a preacher, not as a leader, but as a reflection of us all.\n\n– John Lennon\n\nOne of the uses of poetry is to save us from the constant clatter of abstractions.\n\n– Doug Anderson\n\nDidn’t I, idler and squanderer of summertime, write a long, intimate passionate poem into a lady’s poetry album? No doubt!…And didn’t I, on the whole, play a totally useless, pointless, untenable, irresponsible and thus superfluous part? Absolutely!\n\n– Robert Walser, Wurzburg\n\nWhen I speak of poetry I am not thinking of it as a genre. Poetry is an awareness of the world, a particular way of relating to reality. So poetry becomes a philosophy to guide a man throughout his life.\n\n– Andrei Tarkovsky\n\nLet’s tell the truth to people. When people ask, ‘How are you?’ have the nerve sometimes to answer truthfully. You must know, however, that people will start avoiding you because, they, too, have knees that pain them and heads that hurt and they don’t want to know about yours. But think of it this way: If people avoid you, you will have more time to meditate and do fine research on a cure for whatever truly afflicts you.\n\n– Maya Angelou\n\non the last page\n\nof her last book\n\nthe setting sun\n\n– Brenda Gannam\n\nI do not name you,\n\nbut you are in me\n\nlike the music\n\nin the throat of a nightingale\n\neven if I am not singing.\n\n– D. María de Loynaz\n\nGive your all to your work and to people to the point of weakness. Wear yourself out in the loving and the giving. Deplete yourself. When your work is done or a friend leaves the world, you will feel that you have been assaulted or abandoned, but you will have loved and you will have used the heart for all of its noble purposes. Be bold in the use of the heart.\n\n– Tennessee Williams\n\nThe paradox of education is precisely this – that as one begins to become conscious one begins to examine the society in which he is being educated. The purpose of education, finally, is to create in a person the ability to look at the world for himself, to make his own decisions, to say to himself this is black or this is white, to decide for himself whether there is a God in heaven or not. To ask questions of the universe, and then learn to live with those questions, is the way he achieves his own identity.\n\nBut no society is really anxious to have that kind of person around. What societies really, ideally, want is a citizenry which will simply obey the rules of society. If a society succeeds in this, that society is about to perish. The obligation of anyone who thinks of himself as responsible is to examine society and try to change it and to fight it – at no matter what risk. This is the only hope society has.\n\n– James Baldwin\n\nleaves floating\n\nupon a lotus pond\n\nautumn festival\n\n– Basho\n\nred leaves\n\nengulfed in\n\nsunset\n\n– Issa\n\nPoets!

Realizing this, as a temporary measure Jesus asked these people to place his faith in him. In other words, Jesus was trying to make the case that it was possible for a human being to live life freely as he did. After all, he was a human person just like they were. People would have known Jesus since he was a child and a common laborer in the village.\n\nSo this was step one: to acknowledge that the Jesus they all know was the same Jesus who lived a life of peace, love, courage, freedom and wholeness. It was lead by example. Human beings once through that the idea of going to the moon was absurd, until it was done. There was a time when the idea of a person running a 4-min mile was deemed impossible, until someone did it.\n\nStep two was Jesus bolstering the people’s courage and confidence that they were just as capable of knowing true peace, love, wholeness and freedom. He debunked the religious system that systematically shamed and condemned people in the name of God. Jesus deconstructed the toxic theology of the religious establishment and turned it on its head. He went straight to the people that religion most rejected and offered love, affirmation, validation and friendship.\n\nUnfortunately, at a later point, namely the reign of Constantine and Council of Nicea, Jesus was made into God in a way that put everyone back in their place. Things shifted from belief that one could live as Jesus, to the need to be saved because you can’t. This grave error has been a source of some of the greatest suffering in human history, which I describe extensively in my fifth book, Inner Anarchy.”\n\nI affirm most all of this and have shared words very similar to this in my book K.F. Though I have become swayed by the scholarship that suggests that Protestant Christians have been exposed to a mistranslation of the biblical text that has led to a distortion of our understanding of salvation. ￼We￼ are saved by the faith of Jesus rather than faith in Jesus. See the article on Patheos “￼Was Luther Wrong? We’re saved by the faith OF Christ”\n\n– Roger Wolsey\n\nWilliam Shatner:\n\nI had thought that going into space would be the ultimate catharsis of that connection I had been looking for between all living things-that being up there would be the next beautiful step to understanding the harmony of the universe. In the film “Contact,” when Jodie Foster’s character goes to space and looks out into the heavens, she lets out an astonished whisper, “They should’ve sent a poet.” I had a different experience, because I discovered that the beauty isn’t out there, it’s down here, with all of us. Leaving that behind made my connection to our tiny planet even more profound.\n\nIt was among the strongest feelings of grief I have ever encountered. The contrast between the vicious coldness of space and the warm nurturing of Earth below filled me with overwhelming sadness. Every day, we are confronted with the knowledge of further destruction of Earth at our hands: the extinction of animal species, of flora and fauna … things that took five billion years to evolve, and suddenly we will never see them again because of the interference of mankind. It filled me with dread. My trip to space was supposed to be a celebration; instead, it felt like a funeral.\n\nStrong words outlast the paper they are written upon.\n\n– Joseph Bruchac\n\nBut a city is more than a place in space, it is a drama in time.\n\n– Patrick Geddes\n\nWriting sonnets meant that I could frame my panic and despair in love.

As she said, “I want to write for people like me…people who can’t be faked, people who don’t need to be patronized, people who have very, very high criteria.”\n\n– Tamara K Nopper\n\nOne thing I often tell my nonfiction students is that even though this is about you, and it’s your story, it’s not about you. It’s about the human condition and our fears and betrayals and desires.\n\n– Kim Barnes\n\nYou have to move faster than the non-writing part of you…\n\n– Marguerite Duras\n\nIf your long-term strategy doesn’t have a climate lens then your long-term strategy might be for a world that will never exist.\n\n– Dr. Elizabeth Sawin\n\na brisk autumn wind —\n\nthere’s a book of poetry\n\ninside each of us\n\n– Jason Gould\n\nThe latest experiments in the field of quantum mechanics have rendered all but untenable the notion that there is anything objective at all.

Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish.\n\n– Ovid, Heroides\n\nOnce, I lived on the tarred, lonely highways of truth – slugging towards the looming horizons – the promised dwelling places for those who did not waver. The whole world was about being either right or wrong. I was either lost or found.\n\nThat was many years ago though.\n\nToday, when I meet people, I recognize how utterly beyond right and wrong they are – how their lives are symphonies beyond orchestration, how their mistakes and failings are actually cosmic explorations on a scale grander and of a texture softer than our most dedicated rule-books could possibly account for.\n\nYou see, something happened on my way – and I lost my coordinates, my map, my directives. Now the whole journey is the destination – and each point, each barren point, just as noble as the final dot.\n\nEvery splotch of ink is become to me a fresco of wisdom, a beehive of honey, a lovely place – and every aching voice a heavenly choir. The world is no longer desolate and empty and exclusive; she is now a wispy spirit, whose fingers flirt through the wind – a million roads where only one once lay. And I need not be certain about the road traveled – since I arrived the self-same moment I set out.\n\n– Báyò Akómoláfé\n\nOne of the ways we know we’re magical people is by how much we manage to do with broken hearts.\n\n– Jericho Brown\n\nRomantic Poetry\n\nby Diane Seuss\n\nNow that the TV is gone and the music\n\nhas been hauled away,\n\nit’s just me here, and the muffling silence\n\na spider wraps around a living morsel.\n\nAnd at times, often, the unbearable.\n\nI bear it, though, just like you.\n\nLong ago, I bore a suitcase filled with books,\n\nbore it far on city streets. To sell, I guess, at some\n\nused-books place, one of those doorways down\n\nsteps into dankness and darkness. The scent\n\nof mildewed, dog-eared, fingered pages.\n\nThe suitcase, big and square and sharp-cornered,\n\ncovered in snakeskin, bought at Goodwill\n\nfor a dollar, knowing I had some travelling to do,\n\nsome lugging, and I was right.\n\nWhat books I sold I do not know.\n\nMaybe that’s where “Modern Poetry” went.\n\nThe cover cherry-red and blossom-white.\n\nI can see its spine in my mind’s eye,\n\npointing downward beneath the dank\n\nand the dark to the water tunnelling\n\nunder the city and making its way to the river.\n\nPoems sliding down the book’s spine\n\ninto water, the shock of the cold and dank,\n\ndown where my uterine lining, my blood\n\nand cast-off ovulations, cast-off fetal\n\ntissue swims, below the city.\n\nThe micro-dead ride modern poems\n\nlike swan boats in the park.\n\nFrom the park to the river to the sea.\n\nI’m thinking now of PJ Harvey and Nick Cave.\n\nBalladeers. Lovers. Vita and Virginia.\n\nFrank O’Hara and Vincent Warren. Somehow,\n\nwe ride our lost loves out to sea. Or they ride us.\n\nIt doesn’t matter. Poet or poem or reader, the same\n\nectoplasm. The modern, in time, becomes antique,\n\nand the stone faces of the dead convert to symbols,\n\nripe for smashing. Come to think of it,\n\nsymbols are terrible. As the tyrant\n\nshouted to the masses,\n\npart of his brainwashing campaign:\n\nI know it, and you know it, too.\n\nI was twenty-three when I sold off\n\n“Modern Poetry” and sailed to Italy, seeking\n\nRomantic poetry, which was at one time\n\nmodern, and found my way to Rome,\n\nand Keats’s death room.\n\nHis deathbed, a facsimile.\n\nEverything he touched was burned,\n\nto kill what killed him.\n\nI lifted his death mask from its nail,\n\ncradled it, closed my eyes and kissed his lips\n\nuntil the plaster warmed,\n\nand stained his face\n\nwith the lipstick on my lips. Red\n\nas the cover of “Modern Poetry.”\n\nThe color of the droplets of arterial blood\n\nhe coughed onto his sheets, and viewed\n\nby candlelight. Then he knew he was done for.\n\nHis death warrant, he called it.\n\nAfter those many kisses over his face and eyes,\n\nand the reticulated eyelashes,\n\ncold and tangled,\n\nmy lips were blossom-white,\n\nmy face, chalked. Like I’d caught\n\nsomething from him,\n\nand I don’t just mean consumption,\n\nthough my lungs burned for years.\n\nThey still burn.\n\nThis is the danger of the ecstasy of kissing\n\nthe dead or dying poet on the mouth.\n\nThe disease you’ll catch—well,\n\nit changes you.\n\nThe tingle in the spine,\n\nthe erotic charge, will be forever married\n\nto poetry’s previous incarnations.\n\nIt’s why marriage itself never worked for me.\n\nI kept wanting to get to the part\n\nwhere death parts us\n\nand I could find myself again.\n\nKeats made such a compact corpse.\n\nOnly five feet tall, shorter than Prince,\n\nand intricately made. Always,\n\nhe was working it, working it out,\n\nthe meaning of suffering, the world’s,\n\nhis own, the encounter with beauty,\n\nnearly synonymous with suffering,\n\nhow empathy could extinguish him,\n\nand he could set down the suitcase at last,\n\nor finally deliver him to himself, distinct\n\nas the waves in his hair and the bridge\n\nof his nose. How auspicious,\n\nrare, lush,\n\nbizarre, kinky, transcendent,\n\nromantic, to be young, just twenty-three,\n\nand to cradle him\n\nin my arms, as we listened\n\nto the burbling water\n\nof the Fontana della Barcaccia\n\nfrom the open window.\n\nGratitude, not understanding, is the secret to joy and equanimity.\n\n– Anne Lamott\n\nJung believed that “man’s worst sin is unconsciousness,” for in unconsciousness the human being fails in his or her spiritual duty of self-knowledge. We are summoned to realize the potential of our true selves.\n\n– Ursula Wirtz\n\nOne often has dreams which seem destructive and evil, the thing one cannot accept, but it is merely due to the fact that one’s conscious attitude is wrong.\n\n– CG Jung\n\nThis poem was written at a time when I rode many trains from Connecticut to D.C. The tracks pass through marshes lined with tall grasses.\n\n– Tobi Kassim\n\n“To be ill,” he said in an interview he gave me a year ago, is to be in a situation that forces you to think.” Especially when it’s one of those weird diseases that you don’t suffer directly but from the side effects of the treatments. I realized that I had managed, through my philosophical work, my reflection on Gaia, on the Anthropocene, to break myself away from the traditional idea of nature, to accept the idea that heaven was produced by living beings, that life even possible only through countless interactions, but that my spontaneous slope was to remain confined to a very limited, cartesian vision of the body. I walk my body, take it to the doctor like it’s a mechanic, and wait for the doctor to fix it. It’s poor, isn’t it? But some experiences have increased my understanding. In the same week, I happened to see a nephrologist, an acupuncturist, and a qi gong coach. Here you realize that the biological body is not the only body as described in medical school. Like pragmata, the body is a mysterious object. It can be researched multiple times, and medicine but also acupuncture or qi gong are “stitches” that give access to different dimensions, not exclusive to each other. Céline in Rigodon [1969] gives a masterful description of it when he talks about “this millionth gamet who decides that he has had enough, that he obeys orders, that he will work for himself”. It all starts from a cellular solipsism, a flaw in relationship, a breakdown of the interactions that keep us alive. Or we know today that the body is not one, but that it is a holobionte, a cloud made up of a multitude of microorganisms working together. So, liberating one’s body is freeing oneself from the narrow, Cartesian vision to accept these explorations.\n\n– Alexandre Lacroix\n\nHow many moons have I been too busy to notice? Full moons, half moons, quarter moons facing those thousands of suns, watching them bringing the years up, one piece at a time. Even the dark phases of moon after moon, gray stoppers plugged into a starry sky, letting a little light leak out around the edges. By my reckoning, almost a thousand full moons have passed above me now, and I have been too busy and self-absorbed to be thankful for more than a few, though month after month they have patiently laid out my shadow, that velvety cloak that in the moonlit evenings waits for me.\n\n– Ted Kooser\n\nHow It Escaped Our Attention\n\nby Heid E.

It’s so, and we can’t unblur all the selves. But we can recognize that they exist, and above all, we can let them look at things, remembering always Goethe’s saying that, of all the things that we do, that we can do, the nicest of all is just to stand and look. From the moment that one pays continuous attention to anything, no matter what it is–a leaf, a nail–whatever is being regarded becomes a world in itself, mysterious, imposing, unspeakably magnified and inexhaustibly fertile in possibilities. Once you have begun to do this, you have entered into the kingdom of the Other, recognizing its otherness, and wanting to learn from it. The feeling that you get is that the world, and each aspect of it, is a mystery, is unfathomable, and that it glows against the background of universal darkness with a kind of strange and even magical light, both utterly meaningful and utterly meaningless, as the universe itself is.\n\n– James Dickey\n\nWhen the field of vision has been unified, the inner being comes to rest, and that inner peacableness flows into the outer world as harmony and compassion.\n\n– Cynthia Bourgeault\n\nWisdom isn’t knowing more.

In other words, the important point is not so much what we do, but why we are doing it, in other words, our motivation.\n\nIf our speech is associated with negative emotions, results will be negative. From moment to moment, we are shaping our future. We are planting zillions and zillions of karmic seeds, and we don’t know when they will sprout.\n\nThis explains why good things happens to bad people and the other way around.\n\nMany things can happen, but how do we take them, this is the important point. If we react to them with anger, discontent, etc., we create negative causes for the future. We avoid doing that only if we are aware of what we are thinking. Otherwise, we are caught up in all these negative trends of life.\n\nIf we had microphones attached to our mind and everyone around could hear our thoughts, all of us would quickly want to learn how to meditate.\n\n– Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo\n\nI relearn the language\n\nof a smile and I think of what\n\na luxury it would be to erase\n\nor reset at the stroke of a pen.\n\n– Patrick Roche\n\nAnxiety is not always a sign of sickness, a weakness of the mind or an error to which we should locate a medical solution.

You are within it; the day is as close as your skin. It is around your eyes; it is inside your mind. The day moves you, often it can weigh you down; or again it can raise you up. Yet the amazing fact is: this day vanishes. When you look behind you, you do not see your past standing there in a series of day shapes. You cannot wander back through the gallery of your past. Your days have disappeared silently and for ever. Your future time has not arrived yet. The only ground of time is the present moment.\n\n– John O’Donohue\n\nAlmost dusk, but enough of that dark gold, late-afternoon light.

Beneath every step is a record.\n\n– Elizabeth Kolenda\n\nAt any time you can ask yourself: At which threshold am I now standing? At this time in my life, what am I leaving? Where am I about to enter? What is preventing me from crossing my next threshold? What gift would enable me to do it? A threshold is not a simple boundary; it is a frontier that divides two different territories, rhythms, and atmospheres. Indeed, it is a lovely testimony to the fullness and integrity of an experience or stage of life that it intensifies toward the end into a real frontier that cannot be crossed without the heart being passionately engaged and woken up. At this threshold a great complexity of emotion comes alive: confusion, fear, excitement, sadness, hope.\n\nThis is one of the reasons such vital crossings were always clothed in ritual. It is wise in your own life to be able to recognize and acknowledge the key thresholds: to take your time; to feel all the varieties of presence that accrue there; to listen inward with complete attention until you hear the inner voice calling you forward. The time has come to cross.\n\n– John O’Donohue\n\nA love beyond love,\n\nabove the bonds of ritual,\n\nbeyond the sinister game\n\nof loneliness and companionship.\n\nA love that needs no return,\n\nbut neither departure.\n\nA love not subjected\n\nto the flashes of coming and going back,\n\nof being awake or asleep,\n\nof calling or being silent.\n\nA love that wants to be together\n\nor does not want to be\n\nbut a love also for all the situations\n\nin-between.\n\nA love like opening your eyes.\n\nAnd maybe also… like closing them.\n\n– Roberto Juarroz\n\nI don’t want my poems to perpetuate clichés, tropes, standards.

No. Grief is a skill much more than it is a feeling. Grief is a way of living for mature human beings who understand what it means to take responsibility, even for the things they did not intend. A living relationship with grief brings you down alongside the poverties of our culture, not as someone seeking another solution but as someone willing to have their heart broken by them. This land is longing for well-ripened humans with sensitive and tuned hearts to hold up their end of the bargain. And until we do, our modern culture and beliefs won’t belong and will remain homeless and foreign to the places they occupy.\n\n– Josh Avritt\n\nThe glue that holds the natural world together appears to be a harmonious balance of opposites: day and night, light and dark, winter and summer, liquid and solid, acidic and alkaline, male and female, wave and trough, proton and electron, etc. There prevails in our reality an explicit duality that represents an implicit unity (the “oneness” about which I’ve previously babbled), and the line of separation between those things just named is as thin as it is necessary: yang rubs up against yin, yin against yang, distinct but mutually supportive. The line separating tragedy from comedy is broader, deeper, more jagged, although neither as fixed nor as problematic as the one between life and death; and it’s those more glaring oppositions, including desire versus rejection, success versus failure, and especially, “good” versus “evil” that generally engage practitioners of the narrative arts. From my perspective, however, the most fascinating and perhaps most significant of all interfaces is the one that separates yet connects the ridiculous and the sublime. The surprisingly narrow borderline between things holy and things profane, between prayer and laughter, between a Leonardo chalice and Warhol soup can, between the Clear Light and the joke, provides a zone of meaning as exhilarating as it is heretical: a whisper of psychic release so acutely yet weirdly portentous it just might offer a clue to the mystery of being.\n\n– Tom Robbins, Tibetan Peach Pie\n\nThe Appalachians were a mountain range in Pangaea\n\n– Nicholas Pierotti\n\nPraise what you love. Chuck it under the chin with affection and be ready to give yourself away to it a little bit every day until there is nothing left. When what you love claims you as much as you claim it, a two-way growing process begins. Love always begets more love.\n\n– Gunilla Norris\n\nWe want to have certainties and no doubts …The artful denial of a problem will not produce conviction; on the contrary, a wider and higher consciousness is required to give us the certainty and clarity we need.\n\n– CG Jung\n\nThe Medusa in the Perseus myth symbolises more than a personal dilemma. She is a problem within the collective psyche, a universal human inheritance of resentment and poison which generates paralysing depression within families and social groups and even nations.\n\n– Liz Greene\n\nI just want to go to Shambhala and sleep.\n\n– Nicholas Pierotti\n\nAS I GROW OLD I WILL MARCH NOT SHUFFLE\n\nAs I grow old\n\nI will not shuffle to the beat\n\nof self-interest\n\nand make that slow retreat\n\n​​​to the right.\n\nI will be a septuagenarian insurrectionist\n\nmarching with the kids.

There is no traveller before\n\nyou, there is no road:\n\nWhere is the movement, where is the\n\nrest, on that shore?\n\nThere is no water; no boat, no boatman,\n\nis there;\n\nThere is not so much as a rope to tow\n\nthe boat, nor a man to draw it.\n\nNo earth, no sky, no time, no thing, is\n\nthere: no shore, no ford!\n\nThere, there is neither body nor mind:\n\nand where is the place that shall\n\nstill the thirst of the soul?

Krawec asks, What would it look like to remember that we are all related? How might we become better relatives to the land, to one another, and to Indigenous movements for solidarity? Braiding together historical, scientific, and cultural analysis, Indigenous ways of knowing, and the vivid threads of communal memory, Krawec crafts a stunning, forceful call to “unforget” our history.\n\n– Patty Krawecat\n\nIn all kinds of healing practices, at least in West Africa, the idea is that knowledge is precious, and you learn it over a long period of time. In time, you become the custodian of that knowledge. Your greatest obligation, however, is to pass that knowledge onto the next generation. If the knowledge is correct, it will continue to be used. Everything that I’ve written about my teacher and my own experiences as his apprentice, has been an attempt to convey the wonder of the world he exposed me to. My hope is that my work will in some way ensure that this knowledge will not disappear. My hope is that Adamu Jenitongo’s wise practices will persevere and that they will be recognized, appreciated, and extended to the issues that we face today in the world.\n\n– Anna Badkhen, The Sorcerer’s Apprentice\n\nIt has always been the business of the great seers (known to India as ‘rishis,’ in biblical terms as “prophets,” to primitive folk as ‘shamans,’ and in our own day as ‘poets’ and ‘artists’) to perform the work of the first and second functions of a mythology by recognizing through the veil of nature, as viewed in the science of their times, the radiance, terrible yet gentle, of the dark, unspeakable light beyond, and through their words and images to reveal the sense of the vast silence that is the ground of us all and of all beings.\n\n– Joseph Campbell\n\nThe very fear of stray thoughts is another stray thought. Therefore, if you have many stray thoughts, consider it a natural phenomenon and do not despise them.\n\n– Master Sheng-yen\n\nIn his memoir Another Beauty, poet Adam Zagajewski writes, ‘a poem’s mystery is always ahead of us,’ as if the poem itself touches on mysteries and asks questions but never arrives at or defines or answers them completely. Like a poem, an essay is never really finished, either. Humans are by nature questioners; the biggest answers we seek seem to deal with our identity, usually in relation to a thing bigger than ourselves, such as purpose in life and place on earth. Essays, like those questions, are never fully answered. We are often called to go deeper in our writing, but I think we should also move outwards, from the particular to the universal–centrifugally moving bigger, wider, and expansively so. We should remember our partness and wholeness, which is true of all things, and come to realize there is no destination at which to arrive. We are there. We are nudged in certain directions, set off on trajectories, but will find no end-all and be-all port of call. More always lies within and beyond.\n\n– Liz Blood\n\nThe sun had not yet stood out from the orient, but his precedent light shone through the translucent blue. Yet it was not blue, nor is there any word, nor is a word possible to convey the feeling unless one could be built up of signs and symbols like those in the book of the magician, which glowed and burned to and fro the page. For the blue of the precious sapphire is thick to it, the turquoise dull, these hard surfaces are no more to be compared to it than sand and gravel. They are but stones, hard, cold, pitiful, that which gives them their lustre is the light. Through delicate porcelain sometimes the light comes, and it is not the porcelain, it is the light that is lovely. But porcelain is clay, and the light is shorn, checked, and shrunken. Down through the beauteous azure came the Light itself, pure, unreflected Light, untouched, untarnished even by the dew-sweetened petal of a flower, descending, flowing like a wind, a wind of glory sweeping through the blue. A luminous purple glowing as Love glows in the cheek, so glowed the passion of the heavens.\n\nTwo things only reach the soul. By touch there is indeed emotion. But the light in the eye, the sound of the voice! the soul trembles and like a flame leaps to meet them. So to the luminous purple azure his heart ascended.\n\n– Richard Jefferies\n\nRemember how long you have been putting these things off, and how often you have received an opportunity from the gods and have not made use of it. By now you ought to realize what cosmos you are apart of, and what divine administrator you owe your existence to, and that an end to your time here has been marked out, and if you do not use this time for clearing the clouds from your mind, it will be gone and so will you.\n\n– Jacob Needleman\n\nIt is necessary to realize that technology itself is not the cause of our problem of [not having enough] time. Its influence on our lives is a result, not a cause – the result of an unseen accelerating process taking place in ourselves, in our inner being. Whether we point to the effect of communication technology (such as e-mail) with its tyranny of instant communication; or to the computerization, and therefore the mentalization of so many human activities that previously required at least some participation of our physical presence; or to any of the other innumerable transformations of human life that are being brought about by the new technologies, the essential element to recognize is how much of what we call “progress” is accompanied by and measured by the fact that human beings need less and less conscious attention to perform their activities and lead their lives.\n\nThe real power of the faculty of attention, unknown to modern science, is one of the indispensable and most central measures of humanness – of the being of a man or a woman – and has been so understood, in many forms and symbols, at the heart of all great spiritual teaching of the world. The effects of advancing technology, for all its material promise they offer the world (along with the dangers, of course) is but the most recent wave in a civilization that, without recognizing what it was doing, has placed the satisfaction of desire above the cultivation of being.\n\nThe deep meaning of many rules of conduct and more principles of the past – so many of which have been abandoned without our understanding their real roots in human nature – involved the cultivation and development of the uniquely human power of attention, its action in the body, heart and mind of man. To be present, truly present, is to have conscious attention. This capacity is the key to what it means to be human.\n\nIt is not, therefore, the rapidity of change as such that is the source of our problem of time. It is the metaphysical fact that the being of man is diminishing.\n\n– Jacob Needleman\n\nDisappointment is a good sign of basic intelligence. It cannot be compared to anything else: it is so sharp, precise, obvious, and direct. If we can open, then we suddenly begin to see that our expectations are irrelevant compared with the reality of the situations we are facing.\n\n– Chogyam Trungpa\n\nThe body does not know the difference between an experience and a thought; you can literally change your biology, neuro-circuitry, chemistry, hormones, and genes, simply by having an inner event.\n\n– Dr. Joe Dispenza\n\nThey want to be the agents, not the victims, of history. They identify with God’s power and believe they are godlike. That is their basic madness. They are overcome by some archtype; their egos have expanded psychotically so that they cannot tell where they begin and the godhead leaves off. It is not hubris, not pride; it is inflation of the ego to its ultimate — confusion between him who worships and that which is worshipped. Man has not eaten God; God has eaten man.\n\n– Philip K. Dick\n\nFirst there is nothing, then there is a deep nothing, then there is a blue depth.\n\n– Gaston Bachelard\n\nHistory Lesson/1960s\n\nby Carolyn Marie Rodgers\n\nwhat we\n\ntried\n\nto do\n\nwith our dreams,\n\nwe hoped to erase all time\n\nerrors,\n\nsmash with raised strong\n\nclenched fists\n\nall the remaining walls\n\nand bully, bribe, or captivate\n\nany unfavorable gods\n\nagainst our cause.\n\nso like banners\n\nand flags, our dreams unfurled\n\nbefore all the world,\n\nwe marched\n\nour words we sent forth\n\nas our warriors.\n\noh how sweet the\n\ncensers of victory and freedom\n\nwere going to be.\n\nand we wanted never to\n\ndream again,\n\nawake or asleep,\n\nif we could not\n\nchange the signature\n\nof the world.\n\nEvery day is an elegy to the poem you never wrote.\n\n– Victoria Chang\n\nThe Red Poppy\n\nby Louise Glück\n\nThe great thing\n\nis not having\n\na mind.

I have\n\na lord in heaven\n\ncalled the sun, and open\n\nfor him, showing him\n\nthe fire of my own heart, fire\n\nlike his presence.\n\nWhat could such glory be\n\nif not a heart? Oh my brothers and sisters,\n\nwere you like me once, long ago,\n\nbefore you were human? Did you\n\npermit yourselves\n\nto open once, who would never\n\nopen again? Because in truth\n\nI am speaking now\n\nthe way you do. I speak\n\nbecause I am shattered.\n\nYou eliminate an enormous amount of suffering by concentrating on the suffering that is actually present instead of creating more with your thinking. It is the difference between discomfort and torment.\n\n– Larry Rosenberg\n\nI don’t cook, I just read cookbooks. And dream.\n\n– Linda Ronstadt\n\nIt’s going to take humans to fix it. Not God. If anything, God is waiting on us to act… Godlike. Nobility is a revolutionary act, in a gamesy and manipulative world. We must find our feet, and our no-bull-ity, and band together to dismantle the unconscionable structures that imprison us. If we don’t do it soon, our freedoms will be long gone. Because the power-brokers now have access to technologies and systems that can more easily control humanity than ever before. And they live deep in the delusion that power over humanity will cure what ails them. It won’t, but that won’t stop them from trying. It’s left to us to fix it.\n\n– Jeff Brown\n\nGHOST\n\n1\n\nIt is remarkable how time passes, decades\n\npass, and a moment, a second, when you’re looking\n\ninto someone’s eyes on a sidewalk on Edgware Rd.\n\nin London, when you’re adjusting the scarf\n\non a loved one’s neck, to shelter them from the cold,\n\npushing up their collar as if wrapping yourself\n\naround them, tucking them into a bed warm\n\nand safe from a reckless world, that perfume,\n\nthat quiet sparkle in dark eyes, that face, that blush\n\nyou loved so much, all that can be as vivid, more vivid\n\nthan any invented now, as if it is happening now,\n\nas present, real, more real than the room you sit in\n\n50 years later, more real than the naked cypress trees\n\noutside the January window, more real than the gray\n\nmist-shrouded prairie of another hungering morning\n\n2\n\nBut it is like that, she is right here now, with me,\n\nsudden and unforgettable, and I am still waiting\n\nfor her to speak. It is that immaculate morning\n\ndecades ago, when I have to go to work, I have a job\n\nat a record store, and she has someplace\n\nshe needs to run, and I am standing with her,\n\nlooking in her eyes, doting on her, tucking her in\n\nfor a dangerous unknown, and I will never know\n\nwhere she would go from there, that day,\n\nshe wouldn’t say where, sometimes it was impossible\n\nfor us to speak to one another, only to adore one another\n\nin a distant way, and she would go away somewhere\n\nimpossible, painful for me to imagine, as she often did,\n\nand show up later that afternoon, after I got home\n\nfrom work, emerge from a red sports car pulling up\n\noutside my flat in Islington, to get her suitcase,\n\nshe came back, after a day going out in the cold,\n\nsomewhere with two good-looking young men,\n\nwell-dressed men, in sporty clothes,\n\nwho stood on the street waiting for her, they kept\n\ntheir distance from me, nodded at me politely,\n\na long-haired Neanderthal young man of the 60’s,\n\ncourteously, as if they understood everything,\n\nread the future, knew her past, and I didn’t ask,\n\n“Who are these men?” and she didn’t say, she would\n\nonly say goodbye, and drive away with them,\n\nlike a perfect scarf unraveling like a broken bird,\n\nin the invisible climate of faraway cities, go back\n\nto New York where she would live for a while\n\nAnd I would never see her again, hear from her again,\n\nonly the news from my mother, on the telephone:\n\n“By the way, did you know, Lindsay committed suicide?”\n\nAnd that would be that\n\n3\n\nAnd that moment on the street when I touched\n\nyour face, adjusted your scarf, that moment of saying\n\nI love you and goodbye without words, would stay with me,\n\nso real, more real than this cup of sugared-coffee\n\nbeside me on this cluttered table, paint brushes and pens,\n\nas I look out the window into a dream to find you,\n\nmore real than my fingers sliding over blunt keys\n\nto get closer to you, more real than the sound of a fan\n\nturning out of orbit in the machinery of the 21st century,\n\nmore real, you will always be more real than any day\n\nof my life that followed your departure from the fiction\n\nof my knotted world, from this stumbling world,\n\nmore real than anything, than anyone or any breathless\n\nwhisper I have ever heard since that beautiful look\n\nof bitter love, that shattering silence in London,\n\nthat I have looked for all my life to live again. I remember\n\nyou so clearly, only you are real, for that is when\n\nI died, that moment, that time decades ago,\n\nfor I had given you all of myself then and there was\n\nnothing left of me.

Those who did don’t say.\n\n– Clarice Lispector\n\nlost exploring\n\nnew neighborhood—\n\nsame dog everywhere\n\n– @coffeeandhaiku\n\nThe gods exiled me into this loneliness\n\nfor their own good reasons.\n\n– Jim Harrison\n\nIt is never a waste of time to be outdoors, and never a waste of time to lie down and rest even for a couple of hours.\n\n– May Sarton\n\nIt is worse to stay where one does not belong at all than to wander about lost for a while and looking for the psychic and soulful kinship one requires.\n\n– Clarissa Pinkola Estés\n\nsleeping alone\n\nbuilding castles\n\nin the sky\n\n– Issa\n\nStaying at a house in the Catskills with a large and eclectic record collection, thinking the best fate for your book is that in 20-30 years someone notices it on the shelf of a cabin in the mountains, picks it up and loses themselves in your head for a while\n\n– Mike Ingram\n\nMost people in this society who aren’t actively mad are, at best, reformed or potential lunatics.\n\n– Susan Sontag\n\nThis night of telescopes fixes the cold\n\nOctober sky—a Saturn so delicate as if\n\nSketched by moths holding to nearby stones\n\nFor their lives.\n\n– Emma Trelles\n\nDo not pray exclusively to the ancestors of the land; make room also for the spirits of the fault line, the new gods that scream through cracks with the first musical notes of worlds to come.

Sometimes its’s wisdom, or maybe, it’s a lesson.\n\n– Shey Stahl\n\nIf you are displeased, you have hope. If you are pleased, you have fear. If you have hope and fear, you have dualistic fixation. That will hinder the nondual wisdom of great bliss, the undefiled fruition.\n\n– Guru Shri Singha\n\nOnly those are happy who never think or, rather, who only think about life’s bare necessities, and to think about such things means not to think at all. True thinking resembles a demon who muddies the spring of life or a sickness which corrupts its roots. To think all the time, to raise questions, to doubt your own destiny, to feel the weariness of living, to be worn out to the point of exhaustion by thoughts and life, to leave behind you, as symbols of your life’s drama, a trail of smoke and blood – all this means you are so unhappy that reflection and thinking appear as a curse causing a violent revulsion in you.\n\n– Emil M.

Specialists have a poor tolerance for poetry and ambiguity.\n\n– William Irwin Thompson\n\nI don’t consume much sugar, but I do get periodic cravings. Since starting very high potency probiotic, I have noticed that not only do I not have those cravings, but I am turned off of refined sugar. Gut bacteria control cravings – reduce bad bacteria, cravings naturally change.\n\n– @RDValerie\n\nOnce an old woman at my church said the secret is that God loves us *exactly* the way we are *and* that he loves us too much to let us stay like this, and I’m just trying to trust that.\n\n– Anne Lamott\n\nA quiet hush\n\nover fallow meadows\n\n– a kestrel’s cry\n\n– @wingsoverwaters\n\nTo wish to escape from solitude is cowardice. Friendship is not to be sought, not to be dreamed, not to be desired; it is to be exercised (it is a virtue).\n\n– Simone Weil\n\nSometimes, that’s enough.\n\nempty zen garden\n\nnothing to offer but\n\nsilence and falling leaves\n\n– @HaikuHedgehog\n\nmulberry leaves\n\ngathered for\n\na bookmark\n\n– Buson\n\nThe crucial point is to maintain constant vigilance over and awareness of our mental state so that, at the moment that afflictive emotions rise up, they will not trigger a chain of deluded thoughts. Thus, we neither let desire overwhelm our mind nor do we repress.\n\n– Matthieu Ricard\n\nAn awful lot of modern writing seems to me to be a depressed use of language. Once, I called it “vow-of-poverty prose.” No, give me the king in his countinghouse.\n\n– Martin Amis\n\nAs a queen sits down, knowing that a chair will be there,\n\nOr a general raises his hand and is given the field-glasses,\n\nStep off assuredly into the blank of your mind.\n\nSomething will come to you.\n\n– Richard Wilbur\n\nMan cannot endure his own littleness unless he can translate it into meaningfulness on the largest possible level.\n\n– Ernest Becker\n\nWe all wish the war was over.\n\nBut you are staring out at a\n\nworld on fire complaining about\n\nhow ugly you think the ashes are.\n\n– Brenna Twohy\n\nCome back!\n\nEven as a shadow,\n\neven as a dream.\n\n– Anne Carson\n\nA Valley Like This\n\nby William Stafford\n\nSometimes you look at an empty valley like this,\n\nand suddenly the air is filled with snow.\n\nThat is the way the whole world happened\n\n——\n\nthere was nothing, and then…\n\nBut maybe some time you will look out and even\n\nthe mountains are gone, the world becomes nothing\n\nagain. What can a person do to help bring back the world?\n\nWe have to watch it and then look at each other.\n\nTogether we hold it close and carefully save it, like a bubble that can disappear\n\nif we don’t watch out.\n\nPlease think about this as you go on.\n\nBreathe on the world.\n\nHold out your hands to it. When mornings and evenings\n\nroll along, watch how they open and close, how they\n\ninvite you to the long party that your life is.\n\nI’ll write what little truth I’ve gathered on this walk\n\nbut I can’t write about the key as I stare into the lock.\n\n– e.c. crossman\n\nLet me repeat what history teaches.

Thus, as self decreases, the Divine increases.\n\n– Bernadette Roberts\n\nIf a poem yields itself to a rational reading, it isn’t a very successful art object to me, because the things I find in the world that are the most important aren’t explainable…\n\n– John Gallaher\n\nI know that grief has struck you right in the hip\n\nMaking walking days if not impossible\n\nAlmost\n\nI know it wasn’t with a rubber mallet\n\nOr even a wooden bat\n\nMore like a ball ping hammer\n\na tire iron\n\nI know too it was right in the place\n\nOf an old injury you thought almost healed\n\nThere’s our mistake\n\nWe have one reservoir for pain\n\nTo and from which all suffering flows\n\nGrief lies like a lava lake just beneath skin,\n\nbeneath cartilage and joint\n\nWaiting for some great quake to reactivate its fury\n\nDestroying muscle too in its wake\n\nOf heart and other varieties\n\nSpewing dust that covers the sun\n\nFor who knows how long\n\nA blow with such force\n\nWith such molecular memory\n\nIt says aloud not again\n\nwhy me?\n\nNot again\n\nYour job is not to heal that raging inferno\n\nThat happens\n\nby a miracle\n\non geologic time\n\nand honestly, never completely\n\nThe lake is part of yourself\n\nPart of ecological health\n\nwhether hot lava now\n\nbaked-in scars\n\nlong ago\n\nYour job\n\nthis moment\n\nis to get off the floor\n\nWhile the ash settles without discretion\n\nOn your days\n\nto recognize heat as the natural state of things\n\nNot the exception\n\nLoss is not something that happened because of who you are\n\nSomething you said\n\nSomething you didn’t\n\nBut part of the formation of things liquid and solid\n\nlandmarks of the cutting river of minutes\n\nThe landmarks of your own being alive\n\nThe truth that all things eventually die\n\nIt’s ok to observe the spew overhead with terror\n\nTo lace your fingers behind your neck for protection\n\nTo go deep into the dark of weeping caves\n\nIt is right and good, in fact\n\nThere’s water there for cooling\n\nSalt for cauterizing the wounds\n\nBut can you say also and with and simultaneously\n\nTo pain\n\nYou have been heard\n\nYou’ve been seen\n\nBut you’re not all?\n\nThis lava lake lives\n\nIt’s real\n\nIt’s dangerously hot\n\nIt has erupted\n\nIt will burn every layer of protective hair from your body\n\nBut it’s not the whole of earth\n\nIt does not define the landscape\n\nOf this lusty romance\n\nThis natural dance\n\nBetween time and the spaces where it lives\n\nDon’t look backward or forward\n\nAcross or over or down\n\nLevel your eyes\n\nAnd dig in your feet\n\nto the gravity\n\nThat has promised to hold\n\nAnd never failed\n\nThere are fire plants emerging as we speak\n\neven deep in the cave\n\nOf yourself\n\nWhile you do the work of soaking\n\nin the cleansing bath of tears\n\nThe blue flames of fire are licking at the pain\n\nBurning it away too\n\nEven the hot lava of suffering can only survive itself so long\n\nBefore the pine grow taller\n\nAnd The forest floor grows rich\n\nThere are great creatures hiding\n\nIn the muck of this ash\n\nFeeding and thriving\n\nOn new land\n\nLet it burn\n\nBurn it down until there’s only you left\n\nGreen and alive and unclothed\n\nFire is not the exception to the rule\n\nIt’s part of you\n\nWhen the heat has cooled and the bugs have done their work in the ash\n\nthe cycle wanes\n\nlife will be fertile again\n\nI’m the wife of lightning\n\nI should know\n\n– Deborah Potter\n\nYou missed that. Right now, you are missing the vast majority of what is happening around you. You are missing the events unfolding in your body, in the distance, and right in front of you. By marshaling your attention to these words, helpfully framed in a distinct border of white, you are ignoring an unthinkably large amount of information that continues to bombard all of your senses: the hum of the fluorescent lights, the ambient noise in a large room, the places your chair presses against your legs or back, your tongue touching the roof of your mouth, the tension you are holding in your shoulders or jaw, the map of the cool and warm places on your body, the constant hum of traffic or a distant lawn-mower, the blurred view of your own shoulders and torso in your peripheral vision, a chirp of a bug or whine of a kitchen appliance.\n\n– Alexandra Horowitz\n\nImprov\n\nOn the morning of the drive from sea-level\n\nto the mountain, I asked if we could stop for melted\n\ncheese! at the Mexican place in Truckee.\n\nThen I worried, does Bob think I’m a diva?\n\nAm I always asking for things?
