The map illustrates Algeria's landscape which consists mostly of high plateaus and the Sahara Desert.

The Atlas mountains sit to the north, and the Ahaggar Massif is southeast. The high plateaus stretch for more than 372 miles (600 km) and consist of undulating, steppe-like plains averaging 3,608 - 4,265 ft (1,100 - 1,300 m) and dropping to 1,312 ft (400 m) as you move east. The highest point of the country is Mt. Tahat at 9,850 ft. (3,003 m); the lowest point is Lake Chott Melrhir at -131 ft. (-40 m). Lake Chott Melrhir is an endorheic (closed basin) salt lake whose size varies throughout the year, yet is the largest lake in Algeria with its maximum area about 2,600 sq. miles (6,700 sq km). To the north is a hilly and narrow coastal plain along the Mediterranean Sea with a few small rivers.
