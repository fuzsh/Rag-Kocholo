        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nStaphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a Gram-positive bacterium causing a wide variety of suppurative infections in both humans and animals. In humans, it is one of the most common causes of bacteremia, skin, and soft tissue infection [1,2]. In animals, it is one of the most prevalent causative agents of clinical and subclinical mastitis in dairy farms, causing approximately one-third of cases in cattle, resulting in significant economic losses [3]. In Algeria, research focuses on clinical disease, e.g., mastitis in sheep [4] and nasal carriage of S. aureus strains, such as the highly pathogenic clones ST80 or ST152 PVL+ [5,6]. In poultry, S. aureus is a ubiquitous pathogen found in feedstuff as well as on equipment and utensils present in farms. It is considered an important cause of omphalitis, gangrenous dermatitis, and localized abscesses. It can also be spread via the bloodstream resulting in synovitis, chondronecrosis with osteomyelitis, arthritis, and endocarditis [7,8,9].\n\nMethicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates are resistant to the majority of the antibiotics used to treat Staphylococcus infections in humans. It is a significant cause of severe nosocomial infections and a major public health concern globally [10]. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Panton-Valentine Leukocidin-Positive MRSA was isolated from humans in Algeria and is being targeted for control by the Algerian health care system [5]. The proportion of clinical MRSA isolates increased from 4.8% in 1997 to 52% in 2009 [11], with a small reduction to 47% in 2016 [12].\n\nThe investigation of the risk of human infection following contact with animals or their products, thereof, is still neglected in Algeria. The widespread, unrestricted use of antimicrobial compounds in food-producing animals in North African countries has led to the emergence of MDR, making control and eradication of MRSA difficult. MRSA strains have been isolated from several types of food products, including raw and cooked meat, dairy products from Egypt [13], Tunisia [14], and Morocco [15]. In Tunisia, 1.2% of raw chicken meat samples were MRSA positive, and in Egypt, 38% of retail raw chicken samples were mecA PCR positive [16]. In Algeria, MRSA that carried the mecA gene was isolated from raw milk and traditional dairy products [17]. A high prevalence has also been reported from raw food products in Western Algeria [18].\n\nAntimicrobial susceptibility of S. aureus is commonly investigated in humans in Algeria. A few studies have been conducted on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in S. aureus isolates of milk-producing livestock, but little attention has been given to MRSA in poultry. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and the antimicrobial profile of MRSA strains isolated from poultry species (breeding hens, laying hens, broiler, and turkey) in 18 different Wilayas (provinces) of Algeria in the period between 2011 and 2018.\n\n3. Results\n\nSamples were collected from 18 out of 48 Wilayas (provinces) in Algeria. In total, 1276 isolates of S. aureus were obtained from 4248 nasal swabs. In total, 195 isolates were recovered from breeding hens, 262 isolates from laying hens, 478 isolates from broilers, and 341 isolates from turkeys. As shown in (Supplementary Table S1 containing the metddata and antimicrobial resistance of MRSA isolates), S. aureus was detected in 477 farms (56.8%). The highest prevalence was found on turkey farms (73.6%), followed by breeding hens (52.8%), laying hens (48.8%), and broilers (48.4%). MRSA was detected in 252 farms (30%), and the highest prevalence was that of turkey farms (36%). Most often, one or two MRSA were recovered on each farm. In total, 252 isolates tested (one isolate/positive farm) were resistant to cefoxitin and thus were confirmed as MRSA.\n\nTable 1\n\nPoultry SpeciesNumber of Tested Flocks No. (%) of S. aureus Positive FlocksNo. (%) of MRSA Positive Flocks Breeding hens16386 (52.8%)36 (22%)Laying hens17083 (48.8%)57 (33.5%)Broiler277134 (48.4%)76 (27.5%)Turkey230174 (75.6%)83 (36%)Total840477 (56.8%)252 (30%)\n\nThe temporal distribution of MRSA positive farms from 2011–2018 revealed that the highest rate of MRSA positive farms was reported in 2015 (n = 45 farms), 2014 (n = 37 farms), and 2016 (n = 35 farms), while in 2018 only 16 farms were MRSA positive ( ). There was neither an increase in prevalence at the flock level nor an increase in resistance against the tested antimicrobial compounds or a change in the patterns ( ). The prevalence did vary by the poultry species in the results obtained. The percentages of Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA positive flocks in the different poultry species varied during the period our study took place. The highest number of MRSA positive farms was observed in Algiers with 45 farms, followed by Boumerdes with 42 farms, Bordj Bou Arreridj with 33 farms, Bouira with 25 farms, and Djelfa with 19 farms. On the other hand, the provinces of Oran, Chilef, and M’sila were represented by only one farm each.\n\nTable 2\n\nSpeciesBreeding HensLaying HensBroilersTurkeysNo. of MRSA Positive Flocks *YearNo. of SamplesNo. of S.

The isolates were also highly resistant to tetracycline (82.5%), erythromycin (70.6%), clindamycin (68.6%), and ciprofloxacin (50%). All MRSA isolates recovered from breeding and laying hens, as well as from broilers and turkeys, were susceptible to vancomycin, mupirocin, and rifampicin, with the exception of two isolates isolated from turkeys that showed resistance to the latter. Around 82.3% of isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol, 76.1% to gentamicin, 75.8% to streptomycin, 72.6% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and 58.73% to kanamycin. About half of the MRSA isolates (n = 125) were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. All isolates were multidrug-resistant. All MRSA isolates (n = 252) exhibited the antibiotic resistance (AR) pattern PenAmcOxaFox. Most of isolates 82.5% (n = 208) exhibited the pattern PenAmcOxaFox-Tcy, and 113 isolates (49%) exhibited the pattern PenAmcOxaFox-EryCln. Twenty-three isolates (9%) exhibited the pattern PenAmcOxaFox-TcyCepStrEry, and thirteen isolates (5%) exhibited the pattern PenAmcOxaFox-CepStrSxtKanCamEry, among them, eight isolates were resistant to gentamicin. Only two isolates exhibited the pattern PenAmcOxaFox-MupRif.

Discussion\n\nStaphylococcus aureus is a contagious, opportunistic pathogen that causes clinical or subclinical infections in humans and animals, and it is a significant cause of foodborne illness worldwide. In Algeria, a high prevalence of S. aureus and multi-drug resistant MRSA is found regularly in patients admitted to healthcare facilities [11,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29]. Enterotoxigenic S. aureus and MRSA have also been isolated from samples of various raw and processed foods, including products of poultry with a contamination rate between 6.1% and 38% [17,18,30]. In food products from Western Algeria, 21.5% of S. aureus strains isolated, including those from poultry, were found to be MRSA [18]. Thus, it is thought that poultry primary production is a potential reservoir for MRSA foodborne infections. Only one previous prevalence study on MRSA in the poultry industry in Algeria is available [31]. They found that 42% and 12% of the laying hens and the broilers carried S. aureus, respectively, and more than 50% of isolates were MRSA. Although the authors investigated 1875 and 6500 samples from laying hens and broilers from six provinces over five years, they failed to record flock prevalence for MRSA and prevalences within the flock. Therefore, in the current study, we focused on determining flock prevalences to gain preliminary data for future risk assessment studies for the food production sector and associated occupational risks. In most MRSA positive flocks, only one or at most two MRSA isolates were detected. Testing only one isolate from each farm due to limited resources is a significant limitation of the study as results may not be representative of the full range of MRSA present on Algerian poultry farms.\n\nThe flock prevalence of S. aureus of 57% (477 poultry farms affected in 18 provinces) and of MRSA of 30% (252 farms) was unexpectedly high in our study when compared to previous studies [6,31] in Algeria. Additionally, we included turkey farms and farms of breeding hens to gain a more comprehensive overview of the primary production of poultry in Northern Algeria. Interestingly, the highest prevalence was found in turkeys. The reasons for this finding have to be investigated in future studies, but a common source of infected chickens or widespread abuse of antibiotics in this production type may be possible explanations. The rates of MRSA flock prevalence in our study were lower than those previously reported in laying hens (57%) and broiler chickens (53%) [31]. Both studies cannot be compared due to methodological differences, e.g., pre-enrichment or incubation times. It seems that the rate of MRSA positive flocks per year fluctuates and is not constant for all production areas. This requires further study.\n\nMRSA colonization can pose an occupational risk. MRSA colonization rates of 27.78% were reported in poultry farmers in Malaysia [32]. Even in countries with a highly developed poultry industry and restriction on the use of antibiotics, such as the Netherlands, the prevalence of livestock-associated MRSA can be as high as 5.6% in specimens obtained from poultry slaughterhouse workers [33]. Unfortunately, the risk of human infection following animal contact is neglected in Algeria. Our data show that MRSA is widely distributed in the poultry industry of Algeria and that the risk of livestock acquired infection exists for consumers and people working in the food industry. Increases in human MRSA infection rates have been reported from several other North African countries [34]. In Tunisia, the prevalence of MRSA increased between 2002 and 2007 from 16% to 41%, and the prevalence was 31% in 2007 in Libya. In Egypt, multicenter studies reported a prevalence of 52% between 2003 and 2005, and a similar rate of 55% was observed in Ethiopia. However, the data have to be interpreted with care as they are biased by a low number of samples, study areas, and limited technical resources. The impact of MRSA may also vary significantly depending on the monitoring system and hygiene programs in place. MRSA control measures at the hospital level have promoted a reduction in the incidence of MRSA in the United States and several European countries.\n\nThe antibiotics most often used during the study period on the poultry farms investigated were quinolones and fluoroquinolone (oxolinic acid, flumequine, and enrofloxacin), tetracyclines (doxycycline), β-lactams (amoxicillin, ampicillin), sulfonamide and trimethoprim, as well as tylosin in turkeys (data not shown). Vancomycin is the drug of choice for treatment of severe MRSA infections [35]. Vancomycin resistant MRSA was reported in patients and food samples from Algeria [21,30], but no resistance to vancomycin was found in this study. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), rifampicin and mupirocin are critical antibiotics. Mupirocin is widely used to prevent nasal colonization of S. aureus in humans. Its prolonged and frequently unjustified use in humans has led to the emergence of mupirocin-resistant (mupR) S. aureus in Africa [36]. The use of mupirocin is limited in veterinary medicine in some countries, but cases of high-level resistance to mupirocin have been reported in MRSA isolates from dogs in Poland [37]. In the present study, two mupirocin MRSA strains were isolated from turkeys. No data on MRSA resistance to mupirocin was available for Algeria before this study. These findings are similar to those from Germany, where resistance to mupirocin was also found in 2.3% isolates from turkeys [38]. Low resistance rates of 2% for rifampin are not unexpected but were restricted again to isolates from turkeys. It may be suspected that rifampicin and mupirocin resistant strains were a spill over from humans to animals, and they may generate a special risk when multiplying in livestock. Thus, molecular typing of MRSA isolates obtained from poultry is necessary to trace back the source of infection and to compare with the isolates recovered from humans in Algeria.\n\nBesides the resistance against beta-lactams, notable resistance against gentamicin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and tetracyclines were found. The resistance against gentamicin was again higher in MRSA isolates from turkeys. Similar results were reported from Germany with resistance rates of up to 26.1% in turkeys vs. 2.9% in those from broilers [38]. Other authors from Algeria reported a resistance rate to gentamicin of 39% in MRSA isolated from food samples, but only a few strains were investigated so that comparison with to data from this study is not appropriate [18]. In MRSA, resistance rates of over 70% for erythromycin and clindamycin are not unusual worldwide; the mechanisms of resistance are related. It is well known that resistance up to 30% in MRSA against tetracycline can be found in patients following admission to hospitals in Algeria [21]. But 85% resistance to the broad-spectrum tetracycline antibiotics in all poultry production areas is alarmingly high. The widespread use of tetracyclines in animal production has to be considered as the main reason for this finding. The development of resistance is to be expected in other bacterial genera as well. Resistance against ciprofloxacin in hospital-acquired MRSA strains is not unexpected. However, the reasons for the high resistance rate of 50% in poultry associated MRSA should be investigated in the future, in particular the acquisition of genomic data for such strains to identify their origin.\n\nMany factors have to be considered in dealing with the antimicrobial resistance problems in poultry farming in Algeria [39], but control of the use of antibiotics during primary production needs to be urgently implemented. Successful antibiotic therapy in poultry farming is dependent on the use of antibiograms, but also pharmacodynamics, drug interactions, costs, and waiting time have to be taken into consideration. The omission of resistance testing remains one of the major causes of therapeutic failure on the farms visited. Drugs are mainly administered via drinking water. Thus, the solubility of the preparation and the dose consumed are essential for the efficacy of the treatment. In practice, the choice of drugs depends on the availability of the products in the Algerian market. According to the Ministry of Commerce, the value of imports of medicines for veterinary use reached 22.71 million USD, i.e., 471.4 tons, with an increase of 2.33 million USD (+11.44%) over the first eight months of 2016. This is a drop of almost 4% in the tonnage of antibiotics compared to the same period of 2015 [40]. Increasing prices have forced poultry breeders to use cheaper products. The country’s import restriction in 2018 as a result of high prices, unavailability of foreign currency, and economic decline has greatly affected the availability and use of antibiotics in poultry farms and may explain the lower rate of MRSA positive farms reported in 2018 [41]."
