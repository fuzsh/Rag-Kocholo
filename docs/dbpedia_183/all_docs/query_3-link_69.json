        "text": "This conference will mark a major shift in the historiography of the Algerian War of Independence (1954–62). Accounts of this war have largely remained confined within, and constrained by, the boundaries of the French and Algerian nation-states and the conflicting narratives of each. Recent work by Anglophone (especially American) scholars has broadened the field by offering international histories of the war, but such work has moved even further away from engaging with the realities of the conflict as it actually unfolded “on the ground” within Algeria and within the Algerian emigrant community in France. A fuller understanding of the war requires a marriage of both global and local scales of analysis, paying attention simultaneously to the global connections and significance of the Algerian revolution and France’s Cold War counter-insurgency, on the one hand, and to the complex, often very divisive, local experience of the war for Algerian men, women, and children, on the other. Inseparable from such rewriting is critical attention to the construction and voicing of individual, familial, and local memories and memorialisations (and the concomitant forgetting, or silences) of the war, and its key role in social memory in Algeria and France since 1962. https://oxfordalgeriaconference2017.wordpress.com/\n\nA breath of fresh air, a welcome gust of the innovative: that is what this book brings to the field of studies of contemporary Algeria and, in particular, to the realm of historiography about the political currents that animated Algerian nationalism before, during, and after the war for liberation. This work by Nedjib Sidi Moussa is the product of a vast doctoral project defended at the Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne in 2013. Now it is finally published: simultaneously by PUF in France and Éditions Barzakh in Algeria, following a tendency to circulate scholarly works on both sides of the Mediterranean which has happily intensified in recent years. The novelty of the work is at least tripartite since, as befits every ambitious project, it has to do as much with the subject of study as with the method chosen and the sources selected. If this is, then, ‘une autre histoire de l’indépendance’, as the title announces (emphasis added), it is because it deals not with the already well-known case of the Front de Libération Nationale (FLN) but that of its defeated rival, the Mouvement National Algérien (MNA), about which studies are still relatively scarce, after the pioneering ones by Harbi (1980), Stora (1982), and Meynier (2002). In independent Algeria, the MNA has indeed been the target of a fierce damnatio memoriae: its matters have been erased from textbooks and its militants accused of ‘treason’, if not collusion with the French. A process of Orwellian-like erasure has been in flavour, as the book’s epigraph reminds us: ‘This day-to-day falsification of the past, carried out by the Ministry of Truth, is as necessary to the stability of the régime as the work of repression and espionage carried out by the Ministry of Love’ (Orwell 2008, 243). Sidi Moussa’s book, then, is all the more welcome since the ‘fabuleux réveil de la mémoire’ (Siari Tengour and Soufi 2004, 267) which, beginning in the early 1990s, has hit the sequence of the war for liberation and given rise to a host of publications largely biographical in nature, has instead pushed to the margins (if not to the catacombs) the memories of the militants of the MNA.\n\nThis article demonstrates how Algerian decolonization played a key role in shaping the discipline of territorial planning (aménagement du territoire) in metropolitan France. A number of liberal economists, including François Perroux, articulated notions of economic space that eschewed the nation-state as a unit of analysis. In colonial Algeria, this discourse was subsequently adopted by officials who sought to integrate Muslim Algerians into the French Republic. Discussions on territorial planning in late colonial Algeria echoed debates in the United States regarding the \"social uplift\" of African Americans in the South, which also attempted to stem the rising tide of separatism. In the 1950s, liberal understandings of the relationship among cultural specificity, territorial scale, and economic development were challenged by a host of actors, including Algerian nationalists who espoused ideas that would later appear in the analyses of world systems theorists. After the victory of the Algerian FLN (Front de libération nationale) in 1962, discussions on regional identities provided an important tool for political claims on both sides of the Mediterranean. Moreover, techniques of territorial planning developed in Algeria were imported to the Hexagon in the aftermath of Algerian independence."
