        "text": "Information about Algeria\n\nHere you can find online selected information about the geography, inhabitants, government, economy and history of Algeria. Included are selected statistics, an overview map and the detailed map of Algeria. But let's start with the flag of Algeria here:\n\nAlgeria - Overview:\n\nWhat you should know about Algeria? Let's start with this: After more than a century of rule by France, Algerians fought through much of the 1950s to achieve independence in 1962. Algeria's primary political party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), was established in 1954 as part of the struggle for independence and has since largely dominated politics. The Government of Algeria in 1988 instituted a multi-party system in response to public unrest, but the surprising first round success of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in the December 1991 balloting led the Algerian army to intervene and postpone the second round of elections to prevent what the secular elite feared would be an extremist-led government from assuming power. The army began a crackdown on the FIS that spurred FIS supporters to begin attacking government targets. Fighting escalated into an insurgency, which saw intense violence from 1992-98, resulting in over 100,000 deaths - many attributed to indiscriminate massacres of villagers by extremists. The government gained the upper hand by the late-1990s, and FIS's armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army, disbanded in January 2000. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, with the backing of the military, won the presidency in 1999 in an election widely viewed as fraudulent and won subsequent elections in 2004, 2009, and 2014. The government in 2011 introduced some political reforms in response to the Arab Spring, including lifting the 19-year-old state of emergency restrictions and increasing women's quotas for elected assemblies, while also increasing subsidies to the populace. Since 2014, Algeriaâ€™s reliance on hydrocarbon revenues to fund the government and finance the large subsidies for the population has fallen under stress because of declining oil prices.\n\nGeography of Algeria\n\nWhere on the globe is Algeria? The location of this country is Northern Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Morocco and Tunisia. Total area of Algeria is 2,381,741 sq km, of which 2,381,741 sq km is land. So this is very large country. How could we describe the terrain of the country? This way: mostly high plateau and desert; some mountains; narrow, discontinuous coastal plain. The lowest point of Algeria is Chott Melrhir -40 m, the highest point Tahat 2,908 m. And the climate is arid to semiarid; mild, wet winters with hot, dry summers along coast; drier with cold winters and hot summers on high plateau; sirocco is a hot, dust/sand-laden wind especially common in summe.\n\nInhabitants of Algeria\n\nLet's take a look how many people live in Algeria. The number is: 40,969,443 (July 2017 est.). So quite a lot people live here. Who lives here? Arab-Berber 99%, European less than 1%. What are the languages in Algeria? Arabic (official), French (lingua franca), Berber or Tamazight (official); dialects include Kabyle Berber (Taqbaylit), Shawiya Berber (Tacawit), Mzab Berber, Tuareg Berber (Tamahaq). And the religions: Muslim (official; predominantly Sunni) 99%, other (includes Christian and Jewish) . How old are the people in average? 28.1 years. We have to add that this number is the median - so one half of the people is older than this, one half is younger. And what is their life expectancy (at birth)? This: 77 years. Where the people live in Algeria? Here: the vast majority of the populace is found in the extreme northern part of the country along the Mediterranean Coast. The major urban areas of Algeria are: Algiers (capital) 2.594 million; Oran 858,000 (2015).\n\nGovernment and Economy of Algeria\n\nThe capital of Algeria is Algiers and the government type presidential republic. Let's take a look at the administrative divisions - 48 provinces (wilayas, singular - wilaya); Adrar, Ain Defla, Ain Temouchent, Alger, Annaba, Batna, Bechar, Bejaia, Biskra, Blida, Bordj Bou Arreridj, Bouira, Boumerdes, Chlef, Constantine, Djelfa, El Bayadh, El Oued, El Tarf, Ghardaia, Guelma, Illizi, Jijel, Khenchela, Laghouat, Mascara, Medea, Mila, Mostaganem, M'Sila, Naama, Oran, Ouargla, Oum el Bouaghi, Relizane, Saida, Setif, Sidi Bel Abbes, Skikda, Souk Ahras, Tamanrasset, Tebessa, Tiaret, Tindouf, Tipaza, Tissemsilt, Tizi Ouzou, Tlemcen. Regarding the economy of Algeria, important industrial products are petroleum, natural gas, light industries, mining, electrical, petrochemical, food processing. Important agricultural products are wheat, barley, oats, grapes, olives, citrus, fruits; sheep, cattle. The most important export commodities are petroleum, natural gas, and petroleum products 97% (2009 est.) and the most important export partners are Italy 17.4%, Spain 12.9%, US 12.9%, France 11.4%, Brazil 5.4%, Netherlands 4.9%, Turkey 4.5%, Canada 4.3% (2016).

How rich is Algeria and how rich are people in this country? The most important number here is GDP per capita (PPP): $15,100 (2017 est.). This is quite good. Let's add that this means Gross Domestic Product per person, which is recalculated with respect to the relative cost of local goods and services. And one more important number - population below poverty line: 23% (2006 est.)."
