        "text": "Background: After more than a century of rule by France, Algerians fought through much of the 1950s to achieve independence in 1962. Algeria's primary political party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), has dominated politics ever since. Many Algerians in the subsequent generation were not satisfied, however, and moved to counter the FLN's centrality in Algerian politics. The surprising first round success of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in the december 1991 balloting spurred the Algerian army to intervene and postpone the second round of elections to prevent what the secular elite feared would be an extremist-led government from assuming power. The army began a crack down on the FIS that spurred FIS supporters to begin attacking government targets. The government later allowed elections featuring pro-government and moderate religious-based parties, but did not appease the activists who progressively widened their attacks. The fighting escalated into an insurgency, which saw intense fighting between 1992-98 and which resulted in over 100,000 deaths - many attributed to indiscriminate massacres of villagers by extremists. The government gained the upper hand by the late-1990s and FIS's armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army, disbanded in january 2000.\n\nHowever, small numbers of armed militants persist in confronting government forces and conducting ambushes and occasional attacks on villages. The army placed Abdelaziz Bouteflika in the presidency in 1999 in a fraudulent election but claimed neutrality in his 2004 landslide reelection victory. Longstanding problems continue to face Bouteflika in his second term, including the ethnic minority Berbers' ongoing autonomy campaign, large-scale unemployment, a shortage of housing, unreliable electrical and water supplies, government inefficiencies and corruption, and the continuing - although significantly degraded - activities of extremist militants. Algeria must also diversify its petroleum-based economy, which has yielded a large cash reserve but which has not been used to redress Algeria's many social and infrastructure problems. Algeria assumed a two-year seat on the UN Security Council in january 2004.\n\nLocation: Northern Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Morocco and Tunisia\n\nGeographic coordinates: 28 00 N, 3 00 E\n\nMap references: Africa\n\nArea:\n\nTotal: 2,381,740 sq km\n\nLand: 2,381,740 sq km\n\nWater: 0 sq km\n\nArea-comparative: slightly less than 3.5 times the size of Texas\n\nLand boundaries:\n\nTotal: 6,343 km\n\nBorder countries: Libya 982 km, Mali 1,376 km, Mauritania 463 km, Morocco 1,559 km, Niger 956 km, Tunisia 965 km, Western Sahara 42 km\n\nCoastline: 998 km\n\nMaritime claims:\n\nTerritorial sea: 12 nm\n\nExclusive fishing zone: 32-52 nm\n\nClimate: arid to semiarid;

Algeria has the seventh-largest reserves of natural gas in the world and is the second-largest gas exporter; it ranks 14th in oil reserves. Sustained high oil prices in recent years, along with macroeconomic policy reforms supported by the IMF, have helped improve Algeria's financial and macroeconomic indicators. Algeria is running substantial trade surpluses and building up record foreign exchange reserves. Real GDP has risen due to higher oil output and increased government spending. The government's continued efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector, however, has had little success in reducing high unemployment and improving living standards. Structural reform within the economy moves ahead slowly.\n\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $212.3 billion (2004 est.)\n\nGDP-real growth rate: 6.1% (2004 est.)\n\nGDP-per capita: purchasing power parity - $6,600 (2004 est.)\n\nGDP-composition by sector:\n\nAgriculture: 10.3%\n\nIndustry: 57.4%\n\nServices: 32.3% (2004 est.)\n\nLabor force: 9.91 million (2004 est.)\n\nLabor force-by occupation: agriculture 14%, industry 13.4%, construction and public works 10%, trade 14.6%, government 32%, other 16% (2003 est.)\n\nUnemployment rate: 25.4% (2004 est.)\n\nPopulation below poverty line: 23% (1999 est.)\n\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\n\nLowest 10%: 2.8%\n\nHighest 10%: 26.8% (1995)\n\nDistribution of family income-Gini index: 35.3 (1995)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 3.1% (2004 est.)\n\nInvestment (gross fixed): 26.2% of GDP (2004 est.)\n\nBudget:\n\nRevenues: $31.47 billion\n\nExpenditures: $29.3 billion, including capital expenditures of $5.8 billion (2004 est.)\n\nPublic debt: 37.4% of GDP (2004 est.)\n\nAgriculture-products: wheat, barley, oats, grapes, olives, citrus, fruits; sheep, cattle\n\nIndustries: petroleum, natural gas, light industries, mining, electrical, petrochemical, food processing\n\nIndustrial production growth rate: 6% (2004 est.)\n\nElectricity-production: 25.76 billion kWh (2002)\n\nElectricity-consumption: 23.61 billion kWh (2002)\n\nElectricity-exports: 500 million kWh (2002)\n\nElectricity-imports: 150 million kWh (2002)\n\nOil-production: 1.2 million bbl/day (2004 est.)\n\nOil-consumption: 209,000 bbl/day (2001 est.)\n\nOil-exports: NA\n\nOil-imports: NA\n\nOil-proved reserves: 11.87 billion bbl (2004 est.)\n\nNatural gas-production: 80.3 billion cu m (2001 est.)\n\nNatural gas-consumption: 22.32 billion cu m (2001 est.)\n\nNatural gas-exports: 57.98 billion cu m (2001 est.)\n\nNatural gas-imports: 0 cu m (2001 est.)\n\nNatural gas-proved reserves: 4.739 trillion cu m (2004)\n\nCurrent account balance: $11.9 billion (2004 est.)\n\nExports: $32.16 billion f.o.b.
