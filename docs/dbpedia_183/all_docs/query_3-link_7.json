        "text": "Algeria, officially the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, is a country in North Africa. Algeria is bordered to the northeast by Tunisia; to the east by Libya; to the southeast by Niger; to the southwest by Mali, Mauritania, and Western Sahara; to the west by Morocco; and to the north by the Mediterranean Sea. It is considered part of the Maghreb region of North Africa. It has a semi-arid geography, with most of the population living in the fertile north and the Sahara dominating the geography of the south. Algeria covers an area of 2,381,741 square kilometres (919,595 sq mi), making it the world's tenth largest nation by area, and the largest nation in Africa, being more than 200 times as large as the smallest country in the continent, The Gambia. With a population of 44 million, Algeria is the ninth-most populous country in Africa, and the 32nd-most populous country in the world. The capital and largest city is Algiers, located in the far north on the Mediterranean coast.\n\nAlgeria produced and is linked to many civilizations, empires and dynasties, including ancient Numidians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Byzantines, Umayyads, Abbasids, Rustamids, Idrisids, Aghlabids, Fatimids, Zirids, Hammadids, Almoravids, Almohads, Zayyanids, Spaniards, Ottomans and the French colonial empire, with the latter expanded into its present-boundaries. After 132 years of being part of France, tensions between France and the local Algerian populace led to the start of the Algerian War which concluded with Algeria obtaining its independence on 5 July 1962 with the establishment of the People's Democratic Republic on 20 September of that year.\n\nHistorical Forms[]\n\nPrehistory[]\n\nIberomaurusian culture\n\nCapsian culture\n\nKiffian culture\n\nTenerian culture\n\nAntiquity/Classical[]\n\nAncient Carthage\n\nNumidia\n\nMauretania\n\nRoman Republic\n\nRoman Empire\n\nNumidia (Roman province)\n\nMauretania Caesariensis\n\nAfrica (Roman province)\n\nWestern Roman Empire\n\nVandal Kingdom\n\nKingdom of the Aur√®s\n\nMauro-Roman Kingdom\n\nDiocese of Africa\n\nMiddle Ages[]\n\nKingdom of Altava\n\nKingdom of Ouarsenis\n\nByzantine Empire\n\nPraetorian prefecture of Africa\n\nExarchate of Africa\n\nByzantine North Africa\n\nUmayyad Caliphate\n\nEmirate of Tlemcen\n\nRustamid dynasty\n\nAghlabids\n\nFatimid Caliphate\n\nZirid dynasty\n\nHammadid dynasty\n\nAlmoravid dynasty\n\nMaghrawa\n\nAlmohad Caliphate\n\nKingdom of Tlemcen\n\nZayyanid dynasty\n\nSultanate of Tuggurt\n\nEarly Modern & Modern Period[]\n\nKingdom of Beni Abbas\n\nKingdom of Kuku\n\nOttoman Empire\n\nOttoman Algeria\n\nRegency of Algiers\n\nEmirate of Abdelkader\n\nFrench Algeria\n\nProvisional Government of the Algerian Republic\n\nPeople's Democratic Republic of Algeria\n\nAlgeria Provinces (wilayas)[]"
