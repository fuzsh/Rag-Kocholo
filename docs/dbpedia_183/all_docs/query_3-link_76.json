        "text": "The Indonesian government has facilitated farmers through the role of agricultural extensionists (AE). Covid-19 pandemic has caused heavily impacts on the fisheries sector especially on the socio-economic conditions of the stakeholders, e.g., fishers, fish farmers, traders, as well as consumers. This impact on aquaculture is about its production is largely influenced by the demand from the food service sectors, processing factories, and export. Movement restrictions of fish farmers and less demand from consumers needs to maintaining the stocks of cultured commodities becomes more expensive as most of the products could not be harvested. From the snow ball sampling methods and research interview, the covid-19 pandemic makes the fish processing industry decrease more than 56%. It impacts 3 main activities, such as reducing demand for fish, low prices due to cancellation of shipment by buyer and lack of technical service provider. This decrease has a positive impact on the community to...\n\nThe recent epidemic that affected the whole world badly is Covid-19. The RNA virus disease effect particularly respiratory system causing difficulty in breathing and if condition get severe, it leads to death. This worldwide pandemic disturb each and every sector of the world as mostly all the countries impose lockdown and restrictions in movement in order to control its spread. This create a huge loss for many sectors such as import/ export, industries, stock markets, aquaculture and economies. Considering specifically its impact on aquaculture and fisheries, it greatly reduces its consumption particularly seafood. Fish food chains are affected, small scale fisheries are facing extreme consequences and there is an increase in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. Some positive aspects of this situation such as food sharing and decline in fishing pressure also appears but obviously the negative impacts it holds are far greater than these constructive impacts.\n\nIn Bangladesh, the lockdown has been started officially from 26th March 2020 which is actually the most important time for harvesting and summer stocking in the pond. The whole aquaculture production system is now hampering due to pandemic COVID-19 and the value chain in this sector is quite vulnerable. I conducted a wireless survey through cell phone collected information from different stakeholders of different agro-ecological zones of Bangladesh to assess the impact of the pandemic situations in the aquaculture sector. Survey results revealed that pandemic COVID-19 has been affected in different areas of the aquaculture sector including reduction of consumption, export order cancellation, reduction in price, delay in summer stocking, lack of technical support, and transport crisis.\n\nThe aquaculture and fisheries sectors are critical sources of nutrition and employment generation in many developed and developing countries. Hence, any disruptions to these sectors due to the COVID-19 pandemic have a far-reaching impact, leading to a cascading chain of disorder affecting people’s food security and livelihoods. Relating to these fish sectors, we reviewed COVID-19’s implications for the food security of these vulnerable countries. The current study indicated that COVID-19 and its related preventive measures have severely disrupted the fish demand and supply chain by creating considerable fish price volatility. As a result, the vulnerable aquatic communities have adopted several short-term coping strategies, including fish overwintering, delayed fish stocking time, and feeding the overcrowded fish with low-priced food. Since the long-term coping strategies are still unclear, we recommended certain longstanding methods that are likely to safeguard food security and liv...\n\nCoronavirus 2019 is a global health concern that has left most countries in a state of severe economic meltdown. Scientific research has been down on the virus and its impact on various sectors but that of the Nigerian aquaculture industry has been missing. This paves the way for this research to aim at bridging this gap by looking at the perception of fish farmers on the influence of coronavirus on their activities, the challenges they face during the period of the virus, and the coping strategies adopted to mitigate the impact of the virus. The research used cross sectional survey design with the sample size being 11 fish farmers living in Oyo state, Nigeria. Homogeneous purposive sampling was used and primary data collected through the use of google form. The data collected was analysis using SPSS version 25.0. The result of the analysed data showed that: on socioeconomic characteristics; the majority of the respondent reported that Coronavirus has had an effect on their fishing ...\n\nMalaysian aquaculture sector consists of 391,000 t of cultivated organisms produced per year with an economic value for over USD 700 million as estimated in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a large global human pandemic and it is currently ongoing, affecting profoundly Malaysian aquaculture, which is vital for seafood provision and security assurance. Thus, to increase our understanding about how the pandemic affects aquaculture sectors is crucial to design possible management measures both at local and national level. To do it, we designed a survey, starting in May 2020, consisting of 25 online questions to collect information about the impact of COVID-19 on the aquaculture sectors in Malaysia. A total of 105 respondents (2625 answered questions) was captured within the Movement Control Order (MCO) period and later extended to the Conditional MCO (CMCO). Almost 90 % of respondents was unanimous in answering that, and COVID-19 had a heavy effect on aquaculture-related activities i...\n\nThe Objective of the article is to comprehend the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the artisanal fishery sector, and Coastal fishing communities in The Gambia. We carry out qualitative research with a structural questionnaire in which we interviewed selected fish men in the coastal area in the Gambia. The study used a simple random sampling technique, in which from the target population of 6000 people, we selected 384 people randomly as our sample size using the “Yaro Yamane Statistical Formula&quot;. The statistical methods used in this study are descriptive statistics, correlation, and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) Method for the analysis. There is a weak negative correlation between the revenue generated from fishing and the management level (correlation coefficient of -0.3561). Despite the covid-19 pandemic, there exists a strong positive correlation between demand for the fish product in the domestic market and revenue generated from fishing (correlation coefficient of 0.7843)...."
