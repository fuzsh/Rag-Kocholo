        "text": "Cystic echinococcosis (CE), caused by the larval stage of the cestode Echinococcus granulosus, is one of the most widespread zoonoses in Mediterranean countries. Baiting not-owned dogs with praziquantel (PZQ), due to their key role in the maintaining the transmission of CE, currently appears to be the most effective way to limit the transmission of CE, as well as an important aspect to introduce for the control of this parasitic disease. Therefore, this study aims to test 3 types of PZQ-based baits by evaluating different parameters (integrity over time, attractiveness and palatability for dogs, and mechanical resistance after release to different altitudes) and the bait acceptance in field by target animals, i.e. not-owned dogs, by using camera traps. The double PZQ-laced baits (with a double layer of highly palatable chews) showed the greatest resistance in the environment while also preserving the attractiveness and palatability up to 10 days, also withstood heights of 25 m, thus resulting as the most suitable also for drone delivery. The results on the field showed that most of the baits were consumed by not-owned dogs (82.2%), while the remaining were consumed by wild boars (8.9%), foxes (6.7%), badgers (1.1%) and hedgehogs (1.1%), confirming the specific and high attractiveness of the double PZQ-laced baits for the target population and highlights how an anthelmintic baiting programme may be a viable tool for the management of E. granulosus among free-ranging dog populations in endemic rural areas.\n\nCystic echinococcosis (CE) is a parasite-borne disease caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus belonging to family Taeniidae, is an endemic disease, distributed worldwide as a neglected parasite with socioeconomic repercussions. It causes severe alterations in liver of infected host, and it could be fatal if untreated. The main objective of the present study is to measure and evaluate the condition of hydatidosis in slaughtered sheep in Al Baha region, Saudi Arabia. A total of 601 slaughtered sheep in Al Baha abattoirs were examined for hydatidosis during the year 2020. Various organs were examined for the presence of parasite cysts, and the cyst contents were examined by light microscopy. Also, liver sections infected with cysts were examined for pathological alterations and host-parasite interactions. Forty-two animals were infected (6.09%) with the highest prevalence during summer. During gross examination, it was observed that the sheep liver is the most affected organ by the disease. The liver contained multiple cysts with varying sizes, filled with clear to slightly turbid fluid containing protoscoleces. Detailed sections of the infected liver revealed significant fibrosis around the central vein, portal vein congestion, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and necrosis. Sections through hydatid cysts showed the presence of three surrounding layers with a laminar membrane bordering the cyst lined by a germinal epithelium surrounding several brood capsules with many protoscolesces inside supported by a set of rostellar hooklets. Considerable efforts should be spent to control the transmission of parasitic cysts and inhibit the incorrect disposal of infected meat from slaughterhouses. Also, more focus should be done on epidemiological and control programs of these parasites. Keywords: Echinococcosis; brood capsule; laminar membrane; morphology; histopathology\n\nBovine red offal is one of the main sources of animal proteins. The monitoring of the sanitary status of these foods is mandatory to protect human and animal health against transmitted diseases. The aim of this study was to establish an epidemiological situation of these diseases in the El Oued region. To do so, the registries of red offal seizures from three successive years (2018–2020) of 14,478 slaughtered cattle were retrospectively analyzed. The results showed a continuous evolution of the number of red offal seizures cases mainly in the liver and the lungs. The annual average prevalence of lung lesions increased progressively from 3.45% in 2018 to 10.50% in 2020 while a decrease of about 1% in pulmonary and hepatic hydatid cysts prevalence was observed. For liver diseases, the frequency of seizures increased, also predominately fasciolosis which reached 2.8% in 2020. Concerning tuberculosis, the prevalence did not show significant variations. These findings confirm the value of hygienic control along the entire red offal production chain and the need to strengthen zoonotic diseases prevention to reduce economic losses and to safeguard public health in this arid developing region.\n\nBackground: Parasitic diseases are threat to the development of Ivorian Pig industry. Zoonotic diseases such as Echinococcosis have a significant impact on animal health and production. Little is known about Echinococcosis in Côte d'Ivoire. Aim: For these reasons, a cross section study was conducted at SIVAC in Yopougon, on pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus), in order to determine the prevalence and associated risk factors of Echinococcosis. Method: Parac-linical examinations of pig organs (kidneys, lungs, and liver) were conducted from 5 th September to 30 th December 2019 in order to report infection with this parasite. Results: Out of the 2425 slaughtered pigs, 63 of them were Echi-nococcosis positive, resulting in overall infection prevalence of 2.6% (95% CI: 1.9%-3.22%). The kidneys (2.35%) were most infected, followed by lungs (0.21%), and liver (0.04%). Recommendations: A more in-depth study on the molecular epidemiology of Echinococcosis in the different regions of Côte d'Ivoire is underway. Also, capacity building of community livestock actors (Veterinarians, health inspectors, breeders and butchers) and sensitization of the population on this disease is necessary in order to improve its diagnosis at the abattoir level and to set up strategies to combat it.\n\nHydatidosis is a major parasitic disease condition responsible for low productivity of livestock industry in Ethiopia due to imposing poor weight gains and condemnation of organs. This study was conducted from November 2016 to April 2017 in Adama municipal abattoir to estimate the prevalence, organ distribution of the cyst, and economic importance of bovine hydatidosis. Routine meat inspection, hydatid cyst count and characterization were conducted. Out of 400 cattle slaughtered at Adama municipal abattoir, 210 (52.5%) animals were found harboring hydatid cysts. The infection prevalence was higher in lung 105(26.2%) than the rest of the organs examined. In the present study, explanatory variables (sex, age, breed, body condition and origin) were found to have statistically significant (p<0.05) association with the prevalence of hydatidosis. Of the total of 970 hydatid cysts counted, 529/731(72.4%) small, 89/100(89%) medium, 42/45(93.3%) large and 20/94(21.3%) calcified cysts were detected in lung. Liver harbored 194/731(26.5%) small, 11/100(11%) medium, 3/45(6.7%) large and 74/94(78.7%) calcified cysts. Out of 208 cysts subjected for fertility and viability testing 120(57.7%), 74(35.6%), 40(54%) 34(46%) and 14(6.7%) were sterile, fertile, viable, non-viable and calcified cysts, respectively. The financial loss due to organ condemnation annually and during the study period was estimated to be 894,505.612 ETB and 17,844.90 ETB, respectively. The prevalence of hydatidosis in such a high proportion implies that the disease is economically important in the study area. Therefore, there should be strict control of hydatidosis by focusing on backyard slaughter practice, unsafe offal feeding of dogs, and proper west disposal. Moreover, awareness creation on its zoonotic importance, route of transmission and the growing stray dog population need to be given special attention.\n\nThe objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence of fasciolosis and hydatidosis in slaughtered domestic ruminants based on records from different communal abattoirs in Bejaia province. All daily records for cattle, sheep and goats were used in the current investigation. Each animal carcass was inspected at least by one veterinarian. The data were collected from January 2009 to December 2016. The prevalences of fasciolosis (2.83%) and hydatidosis (2.49%) in cattle were significantly higher than in sheep (0.13% and 2.24%, respectively) and goats (0.12% and 1.82%, respectively) (P ≤ 0.05). In cattle, fasciolosis peaked in January, and then gradually decreased from March to September, while in sheep and goats fasciolosis was present at constant rates all around the year (Fig. 3). Regarding the rate of hydatidosis, the monthly prevalence did not vary significantly in cattle, sheep and goats except in October, when a high rate was recorded in cattle. In conclusion, the findings of the present abattoir study have provided baseline data for monitoring of domestic ruminant fasciolosis and hydatidosis in Bejaia province. However, we suggest that these parasitic diseases should be investigated further at the farms in order to determine the risk factors such as animal ages and breeds, and develop economic strategies for disease control at the farms. Key words: fasciolosis, hydatidosis, abattoirs, Bejaia province\n\nThe objective of this study was to clarify the most common causes of sheep dystocia in Djelfa area (Algeria). 87 ewes suffering from dystocia were investigated in this study. Dystocia was diagnosed after careful vaginal examination. Fetal causes of dystocia were more prevalent (75 %) than maternal causes (16 %). Materno-fetal causes represented 9 %. Several origins of dystocia were recorded. Malpresentation was the most important cause of dystocia, followed by emphysema, ringwomb and uterine-inertia. Others causes were less important. In regards to effect of dystocia type on the viability of lambs, we have recorded that the large number of dead lambs was observed in case of fetal emphysema. Keywords: Algeria, Djelfa, Dystocia, sheep\n\nAlveolar echinococcosis (AE) and cystic echinococcosis (CE) are severe helminthic zoonoses. Echinococcus multilocularis (causative agent of AE) is widely distributed in the northern hemisphere where it is typically maintained in a wild animal cycle including canids as definitive hosts and rodents as intermediate hosts. The species Echinococcus granulosus, Echinococcus ortleppi, Echinococcus canadensis and Echinococcus intermedius are the causative agents of CE with a worldwide distribution and a highly variable human disease burden in the different endemic areas depending upon human behavioural risk factors, the diversity and ecology of animal host assemblages and the genetic diversity within Echinococcus species which differ in their zoonotic potential and pathogenicity. Both AE and CE are regarded as neglected zoonoses, with a higher overall burden of disease for CE due to its global distribution and high regional prevalence, but a higher pathogenicity and case fatality rate for AE, especially in Asia. Over the past two decades, numerous studies have addressed the epidemiology and distribution of these Echinococcus species worldwide, resulting in better-defined boundaries of the endemic areas. This chapter presents the global distribution of Echinococcus species and human AE and CE in maps and summarizes the global data on host assemblages, transmission, prevalence in animal definitive hosts, incidence in people and molecular epidemiology."
