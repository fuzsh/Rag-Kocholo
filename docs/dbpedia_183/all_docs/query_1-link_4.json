        "text": "To deal with the contradiction between the line inspection business requirements for processing massive map data and the limitations which the line inspection mobile terminals have in processing performance, memory and storage capacity etc., this paper analyzes advantages of the Mobile SVG and J2ME in the mobile GIS, and proposes a mobile GIS line inspection program based on Mobile SVG and J2ME. The program organized map data by classification and block, generated static or dynamic SVG documents by GIS server, and made full use of J2ME platform's support for resource limited equipments to achieve the functions of GPS positioning, parsing SVG documents or XML attribute files and real-time displaying and browsing map. It makes up the low memory defect of mobile terminals, improves the data transmission efficiency, ensures the clarity of the map and improves the inspection quality.\n\nGeographical information systems for PCs and mobile devices are rapidly gaining popularity. This paper presents a new server-based GIS architecture which is unique in that it is a totally WAP browser based application with user interface in HTML or WML and J2ME and relying entirely on Internet in mobile devices via wireless LANs or GPRS for accessibility. Wireless Internet-based distributed GIS (WIEOS) is a distributed two tier location information system This distributed GIS architecture is based on a system of Java Servlets deployed in a system with fixed global IP address that regulates the flow of information to clients requesting service from it. The data can be textual or in the form of a map showing the relevant location information A J2ME application, running at the client's handset, is capable of tracking GPS signals, downloading maps and indicating the user's exact position on the downloaded map, thus tracing out his movements. Also, it is possible to simulate a particular client's movements using a JAVA Swing application deployed in the server.\n\nMobile SVG is adopted as the imaging standard of MMS by 3GPP - the partner of 3G. When generating mobile SVG on resource limited mobile devices, the memory space and computation capability become serious constrain which we should pay more attention. By analyzing the characteristics of mobile SVG basic shapes, this paper presents a uniform representation model based on path. Then this paper puts forward an approximate generation algorithm based on cubic Bezier curve, and figure out the approximate element K for curves. The experiments prove that the approximate degree of the algorithm is very high. The method is valuable for the mobile SVG representation.\n\nThis paper explores the use of mobile Geographic Information System (GIS) computing in its application in water point management. Applications based on mobile GIS are the best way to provide appropriate solutions for rural populations such as breeders in Senegal. In fact, the breeders have many problems to find water points for their cattle group. So far, the potential geographic location of water points is transmitting orally between breeders. It is worth noticing that this knowledge, in rural areas, is not stored for instance in databases and depends only on the availability of breeders that own these information. Many solutions for setting up rural information systems have been proposed, but most of them are either PC-based, or rely on proprietary software, or do not take into account electricity constraints which are crucial in rural areas. In this paper, we present an information system based on Short Message Service (SMS) technology and mobile GIS for pastoral mobility (breeders) in Senegal. The system is based on Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format, adapted to mobile phone. Our proposed solution is able to keep up-to-date water points status as well to optimize the seasonal migration of breeders.\n\nA light mobile GIS framework is proposed which is based on J2ME and mobile scalable vector graphics (SVG), GIS is an important component in digital oilfield. First, it defines a general mobile GIS framework. Second, all kinds of GIS code rules are defined, how to manage map layer in SVG is defined, all kinds of GISs object can be described in SVG and DOM of XML. And finally, in distributed environment, based on SVG, JAVAME and related technologies, a light mobile GIS platform is implemented. In this case, the light mobile GIS platform can be used to not only transmit production data, but also locate the interested objects, and the platform is applied to the Daqing oil field."
