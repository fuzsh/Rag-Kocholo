The performance of these devices is limited especially by the used architecture, which to some extent works in a sequential manner. In this article we describe a project which utilizes parallel computation for simple projection of a wireframe 3D model. The algorithm is optimized for a FPGA-based implementation. The design of the numerical logic is described in VHDL with the use of several basic IP cores used especially for computing trigonometric functions. The implemented algorithms allow smooth rotation of the model in two axes (azimuth and elevation and a change of the viewing angle. Tests carried out on a FPGA Xilinx Spartan-6 development board have resulted in real-time rendering at over 5000fps. In the conclusion of the article, we discuss additional possibilities for increasing the computational output in graphics applications via the use of HPC (High Performance Computing.\n\nEmbedded 3D Graphics Core for FPGA-based System-on-Chip Applications\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nHolten-Lund, Hans Erik\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThis paper presents a 3D graphics accelerator core for an FPGA based system, and illustrates how to build a System-on-Chip containing a Xilinx MicroBlaze soft-core CPU and our 3D graphics accelerator core.

However, \"feature-motion decorrelation\" still remains as a challenge for the speckle tracking methods. Recently, a coupled filtering method and an affine warping method were proposed to accurately estimate strain values, when the tissue deformation is large. The major drawback of these methods is the high computational complexity. Even the graphics processing unit (GPU)-based program requires a long time to finish the analysis. In this paper, we propose field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based implementations of both methods for further acceleration. The capability of FPGAs on handling different image processing components in these methods is discussed. A fast and memory-saving image warping approach is proposed. The algorithms are reformulated to build a highly efficient pipeline on FPGA. The final implementations on a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA are at least 13 times faster than the GPU implementation on the NVIDIA graphic card (GeForce GTX 580).\n\nComputer vision camera with embedded FPGA processing\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLecerf, Antoine; Ouellet, Denis; Arias-Estrada, Miguel\n\n2000-03-01\n\nTraditional computer vision is based on a camera-computer system in which the image understanding algorithms are embedded in the computer. To circumvent the computational load of vision algorithms, low-level processing and imaging hardware can be integrated in a single compact module where a dedicated architecture is implemented. This paper presents a Computer Vision Camera based on an open architecture implemented in an FPGA. The system is targeted to real-time computer vision tasks where low level processing and feature extraction tasks can be implemented in the FPGA device. The camera integrates a CMOS image sensor, an FPGA device, two memory banks, and an embedded PC for communication and control tasks. The FPGA device is a medium size one equivalent to 25,000 logic gates. The device is connected to two high speed memory banks, an IS interface, and an imager interface. The camera can be accessed for architecture programming, data transfer, and control through an Ethernet link from a remote computer. A hardware architecture can be defined in a Hardware Description Language (like VHDL), simulated and synthesized into digital structures that can be programmed into the FPGA and tested on the camera. The architecture of a classical multi-scale edge detection algorithm based on a Laplacian of Gaussian convolution has been developed to show the capabilities of the system.\n\nEvaluation of CHO Benchmarks on the Arria 10 FPGA using Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nJin, Zheming [Argonne National Lab.

(ANL), Argonne, IL (United States)\n\n2017-05-23\n\nThe OpenCL standard is an open programming model for accelerating algorithms on heterogeneous computing system. OpenCL extends the C-based programming language for developing portable codes on different platforms such as CPU, Graphics processing units (GPUs), Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL is a suite of tools that allows developers to abstract away the complex FPGA-based development flow for a high-level software development flow. Users can focus on the design of hardware-accelerated kernel functions in OpenCL and then direct the tools to generate the low-level FPGA implementations. The approach makes the FPGA-based development more accessible to software users as the needs for hybrid computing using CPUs and FPGAs are increasing. It can also significantly reduce the hardware development time as users can evaluate different ideas with high-level language without deep FPGA domain knowledge. Benchmarking of OpenCL-based framework is an effective way for analyzing the performance of system by studying the execution of the benchmark applications. CHO is a suite of benchmark applications that provides support for OpenCL [1]. The authors presented CHO as an OpenCL port of the CHStone benchmark. Using Altera OpenCL (AOCL) compiler to synthesize the benchmark applications, they listed the resource usage and performance of each kernel that can be successfully synthesized by the compiler. In this report, we evaluate the resource usage and performance of the CHO benchmark applications using the Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL and Nallatech 385A FPGA board that features an Arria 10 FPGA device. The focus of the report is to have a better understanding of the resource usage and performance of the kernel implementations using Arria-10 FPGA devices compared to Stratix-5 FPGA devices. In addition, we also gain knowledge about the limitations of the current compiler when it fails to synthesize a benchmark\n\nHigh performance image acquisition and processing architecture for fast plant system controllers based on FPGA and GPU\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nNieto, J.; Sanz, D.; GuillÃ©n, P.; Esquembri, S.; Arcas, G. de; Ruiz, M.; Vega, J.; Castro, R.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nHighlights: â¢ To test an image acquisition and processing system for Camera Link devices based in a FPGA, compliant with ITER fast controllers. â¢ To move data acquired from the set NI1483-NIPXIe7966R directly to a NVIDIA GPU using NVIDIA GPUDirect RDMA technology. â¢ To obtain a methodology to include GPUs processing in ITER Fast Plant Controllers, using EPICS integration through Nominal Device Support (NDS). - Abstract: The two dominant technologies that are being used in real time image processing are Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and Graphical Processor Unit (GPU) due to their algorithm parallelization capabilities.

Though FPGA has revolutionized programmable/reconfigurable digital logic technology, one limitation of current FPGA\"s is that the user is limited to strictly electronic designs. Thus, they are not suitable for applications that are not purely electronic, such as optical communications, photonic information processing systems and other multi-technology applications (ex. analog devices, MEMS devices and microwave components). Over recent years, the growing trend has been towards the incorporation of non-traditional device technologies into traditional CMOS VLSI systems. The integration of these technologies requires a new kind of FPGA that can merge conventional FPGA technology with photonic and other multi-technology devices. The proposed new class of field programmable device will extend the flexibility, rapid prototyping and reusability benefits associated with conventional electronic into photonic and multi-technology domain and give rise to the development of a wider class of programmable and embedded integrated systems. This new technology will create a tremendous opportunity for applying the conventional programmable/reconfigurable hardware concepts in other disciplines like photonic information processing. To substantiate this novel architectural concept, we have fabricated proof-of-the-concept CMOS VLSI Multi-technology FPGA (MT-FPGA) chips that include both digital field programmable logic blocks and threshold programmable photoreceivers which are suitable for sensing optical signals. Results from these chips strongly support the feasibility of this new optoelectronic device concept.\n\nDesign and demonstration of a multitechnology FPGA for photonic information processing\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMal, Prosenjit; Hawk, Chris; Toshniwal, Kavita; Beyette, Fred R., Jr.\n\n2003-11-01\n\nWe present here a novel architecture for a multi-technology field programmabler gate array (MT-FPGA).

However, due to its characteristics, it cannot be perceived by any of the senses of the human being, so that in order to know the presence of it, radiation detectors and additional devices are required to quantify and classify it. A multichannel analyzer is responsible for separating the different pulse heights that are generated in the detectors, in a certain number of channels; according to the number of bits of the analog to digital converter. The objective of the work was to design and implement a multichannel analyzer and its associated virtual instrument, for nuclear spectrometry. The components of the multichannel analyzer were created in VHDL hardware description language and packaged in the Xilinx Vivado design suite, making use of resources such as the ARM processing core that the System on Chip Zynq contains and the virtual instrument was developed on the LabView programming graphics platform. The first phase was to design the hardware architecture to be embedded in the FPGA and for the internal control of the multichannel analyzer the application was generated for the ARM processor in C language. For the second phase, the virtual instrument was developed for the management, control and visualization of the results. The data obtained as a result of the development of the system were observed graphically in a histogram showing the spectrum measured. The design of the multichannel analyzer embedded in FPGA was tested with two different radiation detection systems (hyper-pure germanium and scintillation) which allowed determining that the spectra obtained are similar in comparison with the commercial multichannel analyzers.

In the proposed scheme, the cover image and the secret message are transmitted from a personal computer (PC to an FPGA board using RS232 interface for hardware processing. We firstly embed k-bit secret message into each pixel of the cover image by the last-significant-bit (LSB substitution method, followed by executing associated OPAP calculations to construct a stego pixel. After all pixels of the cover image have been embedded, a stego image is created and transmitted from FPGA back to the PC and stored in the PC. Moreover, we have extended the basic pixel-wise structure to a parallel structure which can fully use the hardware devices to speed up the embedding process and embed several bits of secret message at the same time. Through parallel mechanism of the hardware based design, the data hiding process can be completed in few clock cycles to produce steganography outcome. Experimental results show the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed scheme.\n\nThe Application of Virtex-II Pro FPGA in High-Speed Image Processing Technology of Robot Vision Sensor\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRen, Y J; Zhu, J G; Yang, X Y; Ye, S H\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe Virtex-II Pro FPGA is applied to the vision sensor tracking system of IRB2400 robot.

Considering application to safety-related systems, nonvolatile and non-rewritable FPGA which is impossible to be changed after once manufactured has been adopted in Toshiba FPGA-based system. FPGA is a device which consists only of basic logic circuits, and FPGA performs defined processing which is configured by connecting the basic logic circuit inside the FPGA. FPGA-based system solves issues existing both in the conventional systems operated by analog circuits (analog-based system) and the systems operated by central processing unit (CPU-based system). The advantages of applying FPGA are to keep the long-life supply of products, improving testability (verification), and to reduce the drift which may occur in analog-based system. The system which Toshiba developed this time is Power Range Neutron Monitor (PRM). Toshiba is planning to expand application of FPGA-based technology by adopting this development process to the other safety-related systems such as RPS from now on. Toshiba developed a special design process for NRW-FPGA-based safety-related I and C systems. The design process resolves issues for many years regarding testability of the digital system for nuclear safety application. Thus, Toshiba NRW-FPGA-based safety-related I and C systems has much advantage to be a would standard of the digital systems for nuclear safety application.

A pattern classification algorithm is being developed and embedded into a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and microprocessor-based data processing core in this project. The goal is to enable and optimize the functionality of onboard data processing of nonlinear, nonstationary data for smart wireless sensing in structural health monitoring. Compared with traditional microprocessor-based systems, fast growing FPGA technology offers a more powerful, efficient, and flexible hardware platform including on-site (field-programmable) reconfiguration capability of hardware. An existing nonlinear identification algorithm is used as the baseline in this study. The implementation within a hardware-based system is presented in this paper, detailing the design requirements, validation, tradeoffs, optimization, and challenges in embedding this algorithm. An off-the-shelf high-level abstraction tool along with the Matlab/Simulink environment is utilized to program the FPGA, rather than coding the hardware description language (HDL) manually. The implementation is validated by comparing the simulation results with those from Matlab. In particular, the Hilbert Transform is embedded into the FPGA hardware and applied to the baseline algorithm as the centerpiece in processing nonlinear time histories and extracting instantaneous features of nonstationary dynamic data. The selection of proper numerical methods for the hardware execution of the selected identification algorithm and consideration of the fixed-point representation are elaborated. Other challenges include the issues of the timing in the hardware execution cycle of the design, resource consumption, approximation accuracy, and user flexibility of input data types limited by the simplicity of this preliminary design.

On the other hand, PlayStation3 (PS3 game consoles contain a multicore heterogeneous processor known as the Cell, which is designed to perform complex image processing algorithms at a high performance. In this research project, our aim is to study the differences in performance of a modern image processing algorithm on these two hardware platforms.

Different signal processing algorithms are used to extract information about different parameters like range, speed, direction etc, of a target in the field of radar communication. This paper presents LFM (Linear Frequency Modulation) pulsed radar signal processing algorithms which are used to improve target detection, range resolution and to estimate the speed of a target. Firstly, these algorithms are simulated in MATLAB to verify the concept and theory. After the conceptual verification in MATLAB, the simulation is converted into implementation on hardware using Xilinx FPGA. Chosen FPGA is Xilinx Virtex-6 (XC6LVX75T). For hardware implementation pipeline optimization is adopted and also other factors are considered for resources optimization in the process of implementation. Focusing algorithms in this work for improving target detection, range resolution and speed estimation are hardware optimized fast convolution processing based pulse compression and pulse Doppler processing.\n\nFuzzy logic type 1 and type 2 based on LabVIEW FPGA\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nPonce-Cruz, Pedro; MacCleery, Brian\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis book is a comprehensive introduction to LabVIEW FPGAâ¢, a package allowing the programming of intelligent digital controllers in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) using graphical code.

Brief introductions to EPGA technology and the design process are first given and then the design phases are walked through with the aid of a case study. FPGA is a programmable logic device that is programmed by the customer rather than the manufacturer. They are also usually re-programmable which enables updating their programming and otherwise modifying the design. There are also one-time programmable FPGAs that can be used when security issues require it. FPGA is said to be 'hardware designed like software', which means that the design process resembles software development but the end-product is considered a hardware application because the execution of the functions is entirely different from a microprocessor. This duality can give both the flexibility of software and the reliability of hardware. The FPGA design and verification and validation (V and V) methods for NPP safety systems have not yet matured because the technology is rather new in the field. Software development methods and standards can be used to some extent but the hardware aspects bring new challenges that cannot be tackled using purely software methods. International efforts are being made to development formal and consistent design and V and V methodology regulations for FPGA devices. A preventive safety function called Stepwise Shutdown System (SWS) was implemented on an Actel M1 IGLOO field-programmable gate array (FPGA) device. SWS is used to drive a process into a normal state if the process measurements deviate from the desired operating values. This can happen in case of process disturbances. The SWS implementation process from the requirements to the functional device is elaborated. The design is tested via simulation and hardware testing. The case study is to be further expanded as a part of a master's thesis.

The processing of complex data, such as lidar data, requires many different algorithms to be applied. The purpose of this innovation is to automate the processing of complex data, such as LIDAR, without the need for complex scripting and programming languages. The system consists of a set of user-interface components that allow the user to drag and drop various algorithmic and processing components onto a process graph. By working graphically, the user can completely visualize the process flow and create complex diagrams. This innovation supports the nesting of graphs, such that a graph can be included in another graph as a single step for processing. In addition to the user interface components, the system includes a set of .NET classes that represent the graph internally. These classes provide the internal system representation of the graphical user interface. The system includes a graph execution component that reads the internal representation of the graph (as described above) and executes that graph. The execution of the graph follows the interpreted model of execution in that each node is traversed and executed from the original internal representation. In addition, there are components that allow external code elements, such as algorithms, to be easily integrated into the system, thus making the system infinitely expandable.\n\nData Sorting Using Graphics Processing Units\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nM.

Ngene\n\n2012-08-01\n\nFull Text Available The critical issues of testing field programmable gate arrays (FPGA with a view to diagnosing faults are an important step that ensures the reliability of FPGA designs. Correct diagnosis of faulty logic blocks of FPGAs guarantees restoration of functionality through replacement of faulty block with replacement units. This process can be done autonomously or without the intervention of an engineer depending on application area. This paper considers two methods for analysing test results of FPGA logic blocks with the purpose of localising and distinguishing faults. The algebraic logic and vector-logical methods are proposed for diagnosing faulty logic blocks in FPGA fabric. It is found that the algebraic logic method is more useful for processing of sparse faults tables when the number of coordinates with 1s values with respect to zero values ââis not more than 20%, whereas the vector-logical method facilitates the analysis of faults table with predominance of 1s values.\n\nFPGA Design and Verification Procedure for Nuclear Power Plant MMIS\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLee, Dongil; Yoo, Kawnwoo; Ryoo, Kwangki [Hanbat National Univ., Daejeon (Korea, Republic of)\n\n2013-05-15\n\nIn this paper, it is shown that it is possible to ensure reliability by performing the steps of the verification based on the FPGA development methodology, to ensure the safety of application to the NPP MMIS of the FPGA run along the step.

The design of PWM wave generation structure in FPGA is good for a compact controller,and the reduction of the usage of Integrated Circuits (ICs) decreases the interference from the noise among the ICs, hence better performance of the controller. In addition, FPGA can be programmed circularly at any time,so as to optimize the structure design and make a maximum use of the advantage of FPGA. As a part of transplanting the complete function of the DSP (digital signal processor/processing), realizing the generation of PWM wave in FPGA is feasible.

Our approach processes raw pixel data in the red, green, blue color space and generates an output image where all pixels are assigned to classes. A class is a group of pixels with similar color and location. These classes are then used as the basis of further processing to generate tags. The tags, in turn, are used to generate queries for searching libraries of digital images. We run our image tagging approach on an FPGA-based computing machine. The image clustering algorithm is run on an FPGA board, and only the classified image is communicated to the host PC. Further processing is run on the host. Our experimental system consists of an Annapolis Wildforce board with four Xilinx XC4000 chips and a PCI connection to a host PC. Our implementation allows the raw image data to stay local to the FPGAs, and only the class image is communicated to the host PC. The classified pixels are then used to generate tags which can be used for searching a digital library. This approach allows us to parallelize the image processing on the FPGA board, and to minimize the data handled by the PC. FPGA platforms are ideally suited for this sort of initial processing of images. The large amount of image data can be preprocessed by exploiting the inherent parallelism available in FPGA architectures, keeping unnecessary data off the host processor. The result of our algorithm is a reduction by up to a factor of six in the number of bits required to represent each pixel. The output data is passed to the host PC, thus reducing the processing and memory resources needed compared to handling the raw data on the PC. The process of generating tags of images is simplified by first classifying pixels on an FPGA-based system, and digital library search is accelerated.\n\nFPGA Implementation of Real-Time Compressive Sensing with Partial Fourier Dictionary\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYinghui Quan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper presents a novel real-time compressive sensing (CS reconstruction which employs high density field-programmable gate array (FPGA for hardware acceleration. Traditionally, CS can be implemented using a high-level computer language in a personal computer (PC or multicore platforms, such as graphics processing units (GPUs and Digital Signal Processors (DSPs. However, reconstruction algorithms are computing demanding and software implementation of these algorithms is extremely slow and power consuming. In this paper, the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP algorithm is refined to solve the sparse decomposition optimization for partial Fourier dictionary, which is always adopted in radar imaging and detection application. OMP reconstruction can be divided into two main stages: optimization which finds the closely correlated vectors and least square problem. For large scale dictionary, the implementation of correlation is time consuming since it often requires a large number of matrix multiplications. Also solving the least square problem always needs a scalable matrix decomposition operation. To solve these problems efficiently, the correlation optimization is implemented by fast Fourier transform (FFT and the large scale least square problem is implemented by Conjugate Gradient (CG technique, respectively. The proposed method is verified by FPGA (Xilinx Virtex-7 XC7VX690T realization, revealing its effectiveness in real-time applications.\n\nLogic qualification of FPGA-based safety-related I and C systems\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHayashi, Toshifumi; Oda, Naotaka; Ito, Toshiaki; Miyazaki, Tadashi; Haren, Yasuhiko\n\n2009-01-01\n\nWe established a logic qualification method for FPGA-Based I and C safety-related use in Nuclear Power Plants Systems. The FPGA is a programmable logic device and has advantages that the programming is rigorous, simple verifiable, and the technology is stable. However, logic qualification of FPGA had been an issue to be solved when it is used in the safety-related systems, because FPGA is relatively new technology for the nuclear power industry. We employed a software-life cycle approach, because its development process is similar to that of conventional computer-based systems. There are some differences between the FPGA-Based systems and the computer-based systems in the implementation and integration of logic. We examined the FPGA logic implementation and integration process to identify any FPGA-Based system specific hazards. The identified hazards are (1) small logic errors, (2) timing errors, (3) logic synthesis errors, (4) place and route errors, and (5) logic embedding errors. We took the appropriate countermeasures to mitigate these hazards, and employed this logic qualification method in the qualification of the Power Range Monitor System for BWR Power Plants.

Connectivity to the host PC is achieved by using an FX3 chip. By changing the firmware of the FX3, one can alter the function of the FX3. To program the FPGA via USB3, the FX3 must act as a connector from the host to the FPGA. This type of connection is known as an FPGA link. This method of connection is required to avoid programming the FPGA and FX3 dedicated memories and thus not having to use different programming methods and cables to program the board. It is considered that the FX3 is suitable to be used as an FPGA link since its previous version, the FX2, was also used as an FPGA link in a similar project. Firmware was downloaded on the FX3 using libusb and fx3load files from a Linux terminal. Some testing firmware was verified to perform as intended. However, the connection firmware intended to make the FPGA link truly functional has not been successful so far. Yet, through the FX3 documentation, it can be noted that an FPGA link is possible.

In a typical optical surface inspection system, several digital cameras acquire the printing products with fine resolution from different viewing angles and at multiple wavelengths of the visible and also near infrared spectrum of light. The cameras deliver data streams with a huge amount of image data that have to be processed by an image processing system in real time. Due to the printing industry's demand for higher throughput together with the necessity to check finer details of the print and its security features, the data rates to be processed tend to explode. In this contribution, a solution is proposed, where the image processing load is distributed between FPGAs and digital signal processors (DSPs) in such a way that the strengths of both technologies can be exploited. The focus lies upon the implementation of image processing algorithms in an FPGA and its advantages. In the presented application, FPGAbased image-preprocessing enables real-time implementation of an optical color surface inspection system with a spatial resolution of 100 Î¼m and for object speeds over 10 m/s. For the implementation of image processing algorithms in the FPGA, pipeline parallelism with clock frequencies up to 150 MHz together with spatial parallelism based on multiple instantiations of modules for parallel processing of multiple data streams are exploited for the processing of image data of two cameras and three color channels. Due to their flexibility and their fast response times, it is shown that FPGAs are ideally suited for realizing a configurable all-digital PLL for the processing of camera line-trigger signals with frequencies about 100 kHz, using pure synchronous digital circuit design.\n\nDesign of a system based on DSP and FPGA for video recording and replaying\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKang, Yan; Wang, Heng\n\n2013-08-01\n\nThis paper brings forward a video recording and replaying system with the architecture of Digital Signal Processor (DSP) and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The system achieved encoding, recording, decoding and replaying of Video Graphics Array (VGA) signals which are displayed on a monitor during airplanes and ships' navigating. In the architecture, the DSP is a main processor which is used for a large amount of complicated calculation during digital signal processing. The FPGA is a coprocessor for preprocessing video signals and implementing logic control in the system. In the hardware design of the system, Peripheral Device Transfer (PDT) function of the External Memory Interface (EMIF) is utilized to implement seamless interface among the DSP, the synchronous dynamic RAM (SDRAM) and the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) in the system. This transfer mode can avoid the bottle-neck of the data transfer and simplify the circuit between the DSP and its peripheral chips. The DSP's EMIF and two level matching chips are used to implement Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) protocol on physical layer of the interface of an Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) Hard Disk (HD), which has a high speed in data access and does not rely on a computer. Main functions of the logic on the FPGA are described and the screenshots of the behavioral simulation are provided in this paper. In the design of program on the DSP, Enhanced Direct Memory Access (EDMA) channels are used to transfer data between the FIFO and the SDRAM to exert the CPU's high performance on computing without intervention by the CPU and save its time spending. JPEG2000 is implemented to obtain high fidelity in video recording and replaying. Ways and means of acquiring high performance for code are briefly present. The ability of data processing of the system is desirable. And smoothness of the replayed video is acceptable. By right of its design flexibility and reliable operation, the system based on DSP and FPGA\n\nVerification of FPGA-based NPP I and C systems.

This framework allows the instantiation of multiple well-known feature extraction algorithms such as center of gravity, time over threshold and cluster finder, just to mention a few of them. A graphical user interface has also been built on top of the framework to provide a user-friendly way to visualize the data-flow architecture across processing stages. The FPGA platform constraints are automatically set up by the framework itself. This feature reduces the need of low-level hardware configuration knowledge that would normally be provided by the user, centering the attention in setting up the processing algorithms for the given task more than in writing hardware description code. During November 2015, a beam-test was performed at the CERN-SPS hall. The presented framework was used to generate a firmware for the SysCore3 FPGA development board used to readout two TRD detectors by means of the SPADIC 1.0 front-end chip. The framework architecture, design methodology, as well as the achieved results during the mentioned beam-test are presented.\n\nReal time polarization sensor image processing on an embedded FPGA/multi-core DSP system\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBednara, Marcus; Chuchacz-Kowalczyk, Katarzyna\n\n2015-05-01\n\nMost embedded image processing SoCs available on the market are highly optimized for typical consumer applications like video encoding/decoding, motion estimation or several image enhancement processes as used in DSLR or digital video cameras. For non-consumer applications, on the other hand, optimized embedded hardware is rarely available, so often PC based image processing systems are used. We show how a real time capable image processing system for a non-consumer application - namely polarization image data processing - can be efficiently implemented on an FPGA and multi-core DSP based embedded hardware platform.\n\nUranus: a rapid prototyping tool for FPGA embedded computer vision\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRosales-HernÃ¡ndez, Victor; Castillo-Jimenez, Liz; Viveros-Velez, Gilberto; ZuÃ±iga-Grajeda, Virgilio; TreviÃ±o Torres, Abel; Arias-Estrada, M.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe starting point for all successful system development is the simulation. Performing high level simulation of a system can help to identify, insolate and fix design problems. This work presents Uranus, a software tool for simulation and evaluation of image processing algorithms with support to migrate them to an FPGA environment for algorithm acceleration and embedded processes purposes. The tool includes an integrated library of previous coded operators in software and provides the necessary support to read and display image sequences as well as video files. The user can use the previous compiled soft-operators in a high level process chain, and code his own operators. Additional to the prototyping tool, Uranus offers FPGA-based hardware architecture with the same organization as the software prototyping part. The hardware architecture contains a library of FPGA IP cores for image processing that are connected with a PowerPC based system. The Uranus environment is intended for rapid prototyping of machine vision and the migration to FPGA accelerator platform, and it is distributed for academic purposes.\n\nIterative Methods for MPC on Graphical Processing Units\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nGade-Nielsen, Nicolai Fog; JÃ¸rgensen, John Bagterp; Dammann, Bernd\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe high oating point performance and memory bandwidth of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) makes them ideal for a large number of computations which often arises in scientic computing, such as matrix operations.

This controller is based on a Lyrtech VHS-ADC board which encloses an FPGA, connected to a Host PC. This Host acts as local controller and implements an IOC integrating the device in an EPICS network. These tasks have been performed using Java as the main tool to program the PC to make the device fit the desired application. All the process includes the use of different technologies: JNA to handle C functions i.e. FPGA API, JavaIOC to integrate EPICS and XML w3c DOM classes to easily configure the particular application. In order to manage the functions, Java specific tools have been developed: Methods to manage the FPGA (read/write registers, acquire data,...), methods to create and use the EPICS server (put, get, monitor,...), mathematical methods to process the data (numeric format conversions,...) and methods to create/ initialize the application structure by means of an XML file (parse elements, build the DOM and the specific application structure). This XML file has some common nodes and tags for all the applications: FPGA registers specifications definition and EPICS variables. This means that the user only has to include a node for the specific application and use the mentioned tools. A main class is in charge of managing the FPGA and EPICS server according to this XML file. This multipurpose controller has been successfully used to implement a BPM and an LLRF application for the ESS-Bilbao (European Spallation Source) facility.

It is used to establish correspondence between two images taken at different viewpoint or different time from the same scene. However, its large computational complexity has been a challenge to most embedded systems. This paper proposes a single FPGA-based image matching system, which consists of SIFT feature detection, BRIEF descriptor extraction and BRIEF matching. It optimizes the FPGA architecture for the SIFT feature detection to reduce the FPGA resources utilization. Moreover, we implement BRIEF description and matching on FPGA also. The proposed system can implement image matching at 30fps (frame per second) for 1280x720 images. Its processing speed can meet the demand of most real-life computer vision applications.\n\nFpga As A Part Of Ms Windows Control Environment\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKrzysztof KoÅek\n\n2007-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The attention is focused on the Windows operating system (OS used as a control and measurementenvironment.

The analog signals from the detectors are converted to digital (by discriminators or fast ADC) and connected to different type of logic implemented in FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays). A FPGA development board based on Xilinx XC3S50AN was designed, assembled and tested.

It operates by integrating a high-end commercial field programmable gate array (FPGA) into a 3-layer device along with a high-resistivity diode detection layer and a custom, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) layer. The ASIC layer contains an energy-discriminating photon-counting front end with photon hits streamed directly to the FPGA via a massively parallel, high-speed data connection. FPGA resources can be allocated to perform user defined tasks on the pixel data streams, including the implementation of a direct time autocorrelation function (ACF) with time resolution down to 100 ns. Using the FPGA at the front end to calculate the ACF reduces the required data transfer rate by several orders of magnitude when compared to a fast framing detector. The FPGA-ASIC high-speed interface, as well as the in-FPGA implementation of a real-time ACF for x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy experiments has been designed and simulated. A 16Ã16 pixel prototype of the ASIC has been fabricated and is being tested. -- Highlights: âº We describe the novelty and need for the FPGA Pixel Array Detector. âº We describe the specifications and design of the Diode, ASIC and FPGA layers. âº We highlight the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) for speckle as an example application. âº Simulated FPGA output calculates the ACF for different input bitstreams to 100 ns. âº Reduced data transfer rate by 640Ã and sped up real-time ACF by 100Ã other methods.\n\nFPGA cluster for high-performance AO real-time control system\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGeng, Deli; Goodsell, Stephen J.; Basden, Alastair G.; Dipper, Nigel A.; Myers, Richard M.; Saunter, Chris D.\n\n2006-06-01\n\nWhilst the high throughput and low latency requirements for the next generation AO real-time control systems have posed a significant challenge to von Neumann architecture processor systems, the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) has emerged as a long term solution with high performance on throughput and excellent predictability on latency. Moreover, FPGA devices have highly capable programmable interfacing, which lead to more highly integrated system. Nevertheless, a single FPGA is still not enough: multiple FPGA devices need to be clustered to perform the required subaperture processing and the reconstruction computation. In an AO real-time control system, the memory bandwidth is often the bottleneck of the system, simply because a vast amount of supporting data, e.g. pixel calibration maps and the reconstruction matrix, need to be accessed within a short period. The cluster, as a general computing architecture, has excellent scalability in processing throughput, memory bandwidth, memory capacity, and communication bandwidth. Problems, such as task distribution, node communication, system verification, are discussed.\n\nFPGA Acceleration of the phylogenetic likelihood function for Bayesian MCMC inference methods\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBakos Jason D\n\n2010-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract Background Likelihood (ML-based phylogenetic inference has become a popular method for estimating the evolutionary relationships among species based on genomic sequence data. This method is used in applications such as RAxML, GARLI, MrBayes, PAML, and PAUP. The Phylogenetic Likelihood Function (PLF is an important kernel computation for this method. The PLF consists of a loop with no conditional behavior or dependencies between iterations. As such it contains a high potential for exploiting parallelism using micro-architectural techniques. In this paper, we describe a technique for mapping the PLF and supporting logic onto a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA-based co-processor. By leveraging the FPGA's on-chip DSP modules and the high-bandwidth local memory attached to the FPGA, the resultant co-processor can accelerate ML-based methods and outperform state-of-the-art multi-core processors. Results We use the MrBayes 3 tool as a framework for designing our co-processor. For large datasets, we estimate that our accelerated MrBayes, if run on a current-generation FPGA, achieves a 10Ã speedup relative to software running on a state-of-the-art server-class microprocessor. The FPGA-based implementation achieves its performance by deeply pipelining the likelihood computations, performing multiple floating-point operations in parallel, and through a natural log approximation that is chosen specifically to leverage a deeply pipelined custom architecture. Conclusions Heterogeneous computing, which combines general-purpose processors with special-purpose co-processors such as FPGAs and GPUs, is a promising approach for high-performance phylogeny inference as shown by the growing body of literature in this field. FPGAs in particular are well-suited for this task because of their low power consumption as compared to many-core processors and Graphics Processor Units (GPUs 1.\n\nFPGA-Based Implementation of Lithuanian Isolated Word Recognition Algorithm\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTomyslav SledeviÄ\n\n2013-05-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper describes the FPGA-based implementation of Lithuanian isolated word recognition algorithm.
