        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nAlgeria has known many empires and dynasties starting with the ancient Numidians (3rd century B.C.), Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Byzantines, over a dozen different Arab and Berber dynasties, Spaniards, and Ottoman Turks. It was under the latter that the Barbary pirates operated from North Africa and preyed on shipping beginning in roughly 1500, peaking in the early to mid-17th century, until finally subdued by the French capture of Algiers in 1830. The French southward conquest of the entirety of Algeria proceeded throughout the 19th century and was marked by many atrocities. The country was heavily colonized by the French in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A bloody eight-year struggle culminated in Algerian independence in 1962.\n\nAlgeria's primary political party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), was established in 1954 as part of the struggle for independence and has since largely dominated politics, though it is falling out of favor with the youth. The Government of Algeria in 1988 instituted a multi-party system in response to public unrest, but the surprising first round success of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in the December 1991 legislative elections led the Algerian army to intervene and postpone the second round of elections to prevent what the secular elite feared would be an extremist-led government from assuming power. The army began a crackdown on the FIS that spurred FIS supporters to begin attacking government targets. Fighting escalated into an insurgency, which saw intense violence from 1992-98, resulting in over 100,000 deaths â many attributed to indiscriminate massacres of villagers by extremists. The government gained the upper hand by the late-1990s, and FISâs armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army, disbanded in January 2000. FIS membership is illegal.\n\nFormer president Abdelaziz BOUTEFLIKA, with the backing of the military, won the presidency in 1999 in an election that was boycotted by several candidates protesting alleged fraud, and won subsequent elections in 2004, 2009, and 2014. Protests broke out across the country in late February 2019 against President BOUTEFLIKAâs decision to seek a fifth term. BOUTEFLIKA resigned in April 2019, and in December 2019, Algerians elected former Prime Minister Abdelmadjid TEBBOUNE as the country's new president. A longtime FLN member, TEBBOUNE ran for president as an independent. In 2020, Algeria held a constitutional referendum, which President TEBBOUNE enacted in January 2021. Subsequent reforms to the national electoral law introduced open list voting to curb corruption. The new law also eliminated gender quotas in Parliament, and the June 2021 legislative elections saw female representation plummet. Local elections took place in November 2021. The referendum, parliamentary elections, and local elections saw record low voter turnout. Since 2014, Algeriaâs reliance on hydrocarbon revenues to fund the government and finance the large subsidies for the population has fallen under stress because of declining oil prices.\n\nTip\n\nVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.\n\nDefinitions and Notes\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nNorthern Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Morocco and Tunisia\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n28 00 N, 3 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 2,381,740 sq km\n\nland: 2,381,740 sq km\n\nwater: 0 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 11\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly less than 3.5 times the size of Texas\n\nArea comparison map\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 6,734 km\n\nborder countries (6): Libya 989 km; Mali 1,359 km; Mauritania 460 km; Morocco 1,941 km; Niger 951 km; Tunisia 1,034 km\n\nCoastline\n\n998 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12 nm\n\ncontiguous zone: 24 nm\n\nexclusive fishing zone: 32-52 nm\n\nClimate\n\narid to semiarid; mild, wet winters with hot, dry summers along coast; drier with cold winters and hot summers on high plateau; sirocco is a hot, dust/sand-laden wind especially common in summer\n\nTerrain\n\nmostly high plateau and desert; Atlas Mountains in the far north and Hoggar Mountains in the south; narrow, discontinuous coastal plain\n\nElevation\n\nhighest point: Tahat 2,908 m\n\nlowest point: Chott Melrhir -40 m\n\nmean elevation: 800 m\n\nNatural resources\n\npetroleum, natural gas, iron ore, phosphates, uranium, lead, zinc\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 17.4% (2018 est.)\n\narable land: 3.2% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent crops: 0.4% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent pasture: 13.8% (2018 est.)\n\nforest: 0.8% (2018 est.)\n\nother: 81.8% (2018 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n12,605 sq km (2016)\n\nMajor watersheds (area sq km)\n\nAtlantic Ocean drainage: Niger (2,261,741 sq km)\n\nInternal (endorheic basin) drainage: Lake Chad (2,497,738 sq km)\n\nMajor aquifers\n\nLullemeden-Irhazer Aquifer System, Murzuk-Djado Basin, North Western Sahara Aquifer, Taoudeni-Tanezrouft Basin\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nthe vast majority of the populace is found in the extreme northern part of the country along the Mediterranean Coast as shown in this population distribution map\n\nNatural hazards\n\nmountainous areas subject to severe earthquakes; mudslides and floods in rainy season; droughts\n\nGeography - note\n\nlargest country in Africa but 80% desert; canyons and caves in the southern Hoggar Mountains and in the barren Tassili n'Ajjer area in the southeast of the country contain numerous examples of prehistoric art - rock paintings and carvings depicting human activities and wild and domestic animals (elephants, giraffes, cattle) - that date to the African Humid Period, roughly 11,000 to 5,000 years ago, when the region was completely vegetated\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n44,178,884 (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 34\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Algerian(s)\n\nadjective: Algerian\n\nEthnic groups\n\nArab-Berber 99%, European less than 1%\n\nnote: although almost all Algerians are Berber in origin (not Arab), only a minority identify themselves as primarily Berber, about 15% of the total population; these people live mostly in the mountainous region of Kabylie east of Algiers and several other communities; the Berbers are also Muslim but identify with their Berber rather than Arab cultural heritage; Berbers have long agitated, sometimes violently, for autonomy; the government is unlikely to grant autonomy but has officially recognized Berber languages and introduced them into public schools\n\nLanguages\n\nArabic (official), French (lingua franca), Berber or Tamazight (official); dialects include Kabyle Berber (Taqbaylit), Shawiya Berber (Tacawit), Mzab Berber, Tuareg Berber (Tamahaq)\n\nmajor-language sample(s):\n\nÙØªØ§Ø¨ Ø­ÙØ§Ø¦Ù Ø§ÙØ¹Ø§ÙÙ Ø Ø§ÙÙ ØµØ¯Ø± Ø§ÙØ°Ù ÙØ§ ÙÙ ÙÙ Ø§ÙØ§Ø³ØªØºÙØ§Ø¡ Ø¹ÙÙ ÙÙÙ Ø¹ÙÙÙ Ø§Øª Ø§ÙØ£Ø³Ø§Ø³ÙØ© (Arabic)\n\nThe World Factbook, the indispensable source for basic information.\n\nArabic audio sample :\n\nReligions\n\nMuslim (official; predominantly Sunni) 99%, other (includes Christian, Jewish, Ahmadi Muslims, Shia Muslims, IbadiÂ Muslims) <1% (2012 est.)\n\nDemographic profile\n\nFor the first two thirds of the 20th century, Algeria's high fertility rate caused its population to grow rapidly. However, about a decade after independence from France in 1962, the total fertility rate fell dramatically from 7 children per woman in the 1970s to about 2.4 in 2000, slowing Algeria's population growth rate by the late 1980s. The lower fertility rate was mainly the result of women's rising age at first marriage (virtually all Algerian children being born in wedlock) and to a lesser extent the wider use of contraceptives. Later marriages and a preference for smaller families are attributed to increases in women's education and participation in the labor market; higher unemployment; and a shortage of housing forcing multiple generations to live together. The average woman's age at first marriage increased from about 19 in the mid-1950s to 24 in the mid-1970s to 30.5 in the late 1990s.\n\nAlgeria's fertility rate experienced an unexpected upturn in the early 2000s, as the average woman's age at first marriage dropped slightly. The reversal in fertility could represent a temporary fluctuation in marriage age or, less likely, a decrease in the steady rate of contraceptive use.\n\nThousands of Algerian peasants - mainly Berber men from the Kabylia region - faced with land dispossession and economic hardship under French rule migrated temporarily to France to work in manufacturing and mining during the first half of the 20th century. This movement accelerated during World War I, when Algerians filled in for French factory workers or served as soldiers. In the years following independence, low-skilled Algerian workers and Algerians who had supported the French (known as Harkis) emigrated en masse to France. Tighter French immigration rules and Algiers' decision to cease managing labor migration to France in the 1970s limited legal emigration largely to family reunification.\n\nNot until Algeria's civil war in the 1990s did the country again experience substantial outmigration. Many Algerians legally entered Tunisia without visas claiming to be tourists and then stayed as workers. Other Algerians headed to Europe seeking asylum, although France imposed restrictions. Sub-Saharan African migrants came to Algeria after its civil war to work in agriculture and mining. In the 2000s, a wave of educated Algerians went abroad seeking skilled jobs in a wider range of destinations, increasing their presence in North America and Spain. At the same time, legal foreign workers principally from China and Egypt came to work in Algeria's construction and oil sectors. Illegal migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly Malians, Nigeriens, and Gambians, continue to come to Algeria in search of work or to use it as a stepping stone to Libya and Europe.\n\nSince 1975, Algeria also has been the main recipient of Sahrawi refugees from the ongoing conflict in Western Sahara (today part of Morocco). More than 100,000 Sahrawis are estimated to be living in five refugee camps in southwestern Algeria near Tindouf.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 29.58% (male 6,509,490/female 6,201,450)\n\n15-24 years: 13.93% (male 3,063,972/female 2,922,368)\n\n25-54 years: 42.91% (male 9,345,997/female 9,091,558)\n\n55-64 years: 7.41% (male 1,599,369/female 1,585,233)\n\n65 years and over: 6.17% (male 1,252,084/female 1,401,357) (2020 est.)\n\n2022 population pyramid\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 58.5\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 48.7\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 9.8\n\npotential support ratio: 10.2 (2021 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 28.9 years\n\nmale: 28.6 years\n\nfemale: 29.3 years (2020 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 139\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n1.34% (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 71\n\nBirth rate\n\n18.52 births/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 78\n\nDeath rate\n\n4.32 deaths/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 207\n\nNet migration rate\n\n-0.82 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 138\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nthe vast majority of the populace is found in the extreme northern part of the country along the Mediterranean Coast as shown in this population distribution map\n\nUrbanization\n\nurban population: 75.3% of total population (2023)\n\nrate of urbanization: 1.99% annual rate of change (2020-25 est.)\n\nMajor urban areas - population\n\n2.902 million ALGIERS (capital), 936,000 Oran (2022)\n\nSex ratio\n\nat birth: 1.05 male(s)/female\n\n0-14 years: 1.05 male(s)/female\n\n15-24 years: 1.05 male(s)/female\n\n25-54 years: 1.03 male(s)/female\n\n55-64 years: 1 male(s)/female\n\n65 years and over: 0.75 male(s)/female\n\ntotal population: 1.03 male(s)/female (2022 est.)\n\nMaternal mortality ratio\n\n112 deaths/100,000 live births (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 68\n\nInfant mortality rate\n\ntotal: 19.72 deaths/1,000 live births\n\nmale: 21.77 deaths/1,000 live births\n\nfemale: 17.55 deaths/1,000 live births (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 82\n\nLife expectancy at birth\n\ntotal population: 78.03 years\n\nmale: 76.57 years\n\nfemale: 79.57 years (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 77\n\nTotal fertility rate\n\n2.51 children born/woman (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 68\n\nContraceptive prevalence rate\n\n53.6% (2018/19)\n\nDrinking water source\n\nimproved: urban: 99.6% of population\n\nrural: 98.8% of population\n\ntotal: 99.4% of population\n\nunimproved: urban: 0.4% of population\n\nrural: 1.2% of population\n\ntotal: 0.6% of population (2020 est.)\n\nCurrent health expenditure\n\n6.2% of GDP (2019)\n\nPhysicians density\n\n1.72 physicians/1,000 population (2018)\n\nHospital bed density\n\n1.9 beds/1,000 population (2015)\n\nSanitation facility access\n\nimproved: urban: 98.3% of population\n\nrural: 91.3% of population\n\ntotal: 96.5% of population\n\nunimproved: urban: 1.7% of population\n\nrural: 8.7% of population\n\ntotal: 3.5% of population (2020 est.)\n\nHIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate\n\n(2021 est.) <0.1%\n\nObesity - adult prevalence rate\n\n27.4% (2016)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 38\n\nAlcohol consumption per capita\n\ntotal: 0.59 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nbeer: 0.31 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nwine: 0.2 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nspirits: 0.08 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\nother alcohols: 0 liters of pure alcohol (2019 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 160\n\nTobacco use\n\ntotal: 21% (2020 est.)\n\nmale: 41.3% (2020 est.)\n\nfemale: 0.7% (2020 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 80\n\nChildren under the age of 5 years underweight\n\n2.7% (2018/19)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 100\n\nChild marriage\n\nwomen married by age 15: 0%\n\nwomen married by age 18: 3.8% (2019 est.)\n\nEducation expenditures\n\n7% of GDP (2020 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 21\n\nLiteracy\n\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\n\ntotal population: 81.4%\n\nmale: 87.4%\n\nfemale: 75.3% (2018)\n\nYouth unemployment rate (ages 15-24)\n\ntotal: 39.3%\n\nmale: 33.1%\n\nfemale: 82% (2017 est.)\n\nEnvironment\n\nEnvironment - current issues\n\nair pollution in major cities;

In recent years the Algerian Government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy, pursuing an explicit import substitution policy.\n\nÂ\n\nHydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 30% of GDP, 60% of budget revenues, and nearly 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the 10th-largest reserves of natural gas in the world - including the 3rd-largest reserves of shale gas - and is the 6th-largest gas exporter. It ranks 16th in proven oil reserves. Hydrocarbon exports enabled Algeria to maintain macroeconomic stability, amass large foreign currency reserves, and maintain low external debt while global oil prices were high. With lower oil prices since 2014, Algeriaâs foreign exchange reserves have declined by more than half and its oil stabilization fund has decreased from about $20 billion at the end of 2013 to about $7 billion in 2017, which is the statutory minimum.\n\nÂ\n\nDeclining oil prices have also reduced the governmentâs ability to use state-driven growth to distribute rents and fund generous public subsidies, and the government has been under pressure to reduce spending. Over the past three years, the government has enacted incremental increases in some taxes, resulting in modest increases in prices for gasoline, cigarettes, alcohol, and certain imported goods, but it has refrained from reducing subsidies, particularly for education, healthcare, and housing programs.\n\nÂ\n\nAlgiers has increased protectionist measures since 2015 to limit its import bill and encourage domestic production of non-oil and gas industries. Since 2015, the government has imposed additional restrictions on access to foreign exchange for imports, and import quotas for specific products, such as cars. In January 2018 the government imposed an indefinite suspension on the importation of roughly 850 products, subject to periodic review.\n\nÂ\n\nPresident BOUTEFLIKA announced in fall 2017 that Algeria intends to develop its non-conventional energy resources. Algeria has struggled to develop non-hydrocarbon industries because of heavy regulation and an emphasis on state-driven growth. Algeria has not increased non-hydrocarbon exports, and hydrocarbon exports have declined because of field depletion and increased domestic demand.\n\nReal GDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$468.4 billion (2020 est.)\n\n$495.56 billion (2019 est.)\n\n$491.63 billion (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 41\n\nReal GDP growth rate\n\n1.4% (2017 est.)\n\n3.2% (2016 est.)\n\n3.7% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 157\n\nReal GDP per capita\n\n$10,700 (2020 est.)\n\n$11,500 (2019 est.)\n\n$11,600 (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 138\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$169.912 billion (2019 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices)\n\n1.9% (2019 est.)\n\n4.2% (2018 est.)\n\n5.6% (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 104\n\nCredit ratings\n\nnote: The year refers to the year in which the current credit rating was first obtained.\n\nGDP -
