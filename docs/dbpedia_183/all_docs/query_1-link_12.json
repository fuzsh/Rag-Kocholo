        "text": "With the aim of improving the traditional method of collecting road data and knowledge and management of the road network in Algeria, an application of mobile geographical information systems (GIS) was constructed using a whole of solutions (PostgreSQL, PostGIS, QGIS, IntraMaps Roam, QGIS Cloud). This application allows the input of road data (pavement degradation, state of drainage systems, state of road equipment, traffic data, road safety data, etc.) directly from the field data, using wireless communication and tablet PC, and the visualization of modification of data in real time on the desktop. The technique allows the managers to give road information in real time to road users. Tests were performed in the field (collection of pavement degradation, counting of the various types of vehicles, road safety inspection, consultation of road information) with road network data of Djelfa Town (Algeria). These tests show that the mobile GIS not only improves the quality of the road data but also increases the effectiveness of the management of the road networks in general. Moreover, it allows the creation of thematic maps quickly (map of pavement state, map of traffic state, map of road information, etc.) using recent and precise data.\n\nNikos Athanasis\n\n·\n\nFotis Karagiannis\n\n·\n\nPalaiologos Palaiologou\n\n·\n\n[...]\n\n·\n\nKostas Kalabokidis\n\nNovel technological advances in mobile devices and applications can be exploited in wildfire confrontation, enabling end-users to easily conduct several everyday tasks, such as access to data and information, sharing of intelligence and coordination of personnel and vehicles. This work describes an innovative mobile application for wildfire information management that operates on Windows Phone devices and acts as a complementary tool to the web-based version of the AEGIS platform for wildfire prevention and management. Several tasks can be accomplished from the AEGIS App, such as routing, spatial search for closest facilities and firefighting support infrastructures, access to weather data and visualization of fire management data (water sources, gas refill stations, evacuation sites etc.). An innovative feature of AEGIS App is the support of these tasks by a digital assistant for artificial intelligence named Cortana (developed by Microsoft for Windows Phone devices), that allows information utilization through voice commands. The application is to be used by firefighting personnel in Greece and is potentially expected to contribute towards a more sophisticated transferring of information and knowledge between wildfire confrontation operation centers and firefighting units in the field.\n\nView\n\nSandeep Vasant Gaikwad\n\n·\n\nAmol Vibhute\n\n·\n\nKarbhari Kale\n\n·\n\n[...]\n\n·\n\nMonali B. Jadhav\n\nTraditionally, the earth surface features were collected by field visit for collecting the details of earth surface features with coordinates. However, the conventional method is slow tedious and costly. Recently, smartphone applications are providing the details of locations including latitude, longitude which is basically used for ground truth data collection for Remote Sensing (RS) applications. Nevertheless, there are limitations found in existing system as they do not provide offline and online mode, location data management, and visualization into the single system. The objective of our research was thus to overcome the limitations in the existing ground truth collection system by exploring a novel solution that will be based on Smartphone, Cloud server, and WebGIS platform. Consequently, an android application and web-based tool is developed for ground truth data collection and its management. The present research reports, the novel solution for collecting the real-time ground truth and mapping feature for RS research.\n\nView"
