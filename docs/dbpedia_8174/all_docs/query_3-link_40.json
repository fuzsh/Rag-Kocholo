        "text": "Edmund Perera passed away on November 29th in his home in Bridgeport, Chicago. Eddie was a loving husband to Nalini Perera for 49 years, father to Minoli Perera, grandfather to Rohan and Wolfgang Gengler and brother to Anslem Perera and Angela Madappuli. He is preceded in death by his sister (Hannah Perera) and brother (George Perera). He was a great friend to many, who sought out his quiet wisdom and thoughtful guidance. He is deeply missed by all that knew him.\n\nHe was born and raised in Sri Lanka and received his bachelor’s degree in Architecture from the University of Melbourne (Australia). He moved his family to Zambia and finally to the United States in 1980. He was proud to become a citizen of the US in 1998. He ended his career at the Veteran’s Administration Hospital in 2013. He was an accomplished artist that donated his talents to his church, his family and his friends. He enjoyed music and in particular singing in his church choir in Memphis (St. Paul the Apostle Catholic Church). He and his wife moved to Chicago in 2021 to be closer to his daughter and grandchildren. They were blessed with having him close by to enjoy family dinners. He was always a lover of dessert and insisted on a bit of chocolate after a meal – something his grandchildren always joined in on. Eddie was a devout Catholic and lived his life in service of others and his faith.\n\nA funeral mass will be held at St. Michael's Catholic Church at 6:15 pm, Friday, February 16, 2024, located at 3863 Summer Avenue, Memphis, TN 38122"
