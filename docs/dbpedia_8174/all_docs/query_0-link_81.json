Michael Richardson, bass trombone; Todd Kaufman, tuba; Arthur Weisberg, Conductor\n\nThe Sylvan Winds, an ensemble devoted to exploring the literature of chamber music for wind instruments, is a natural outgrowth of the Sylvan Wind Quintet, founded in 1976. Based in New York City, the group is the only one of its kind to present an annual subscription series which has been critically acclaimed and has been captivating audiences with its innovative programming. Following a concert sponsored by the Carnegie Hall Corporation in 1982, the Sylvan Winds has frequently performed in Weill Recital Hall.\n\nThe ensemble has often been featured at Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival, most recently appearing in the Mozart & Prague week, having also appeared during the Mozart Bicentennial Celebration and Haydn Marathon, as well as in Avery Fisher Hall pre-concert programs, and participating with the Festival's winds in performances of the Mozart Grand Partita (K. 361/370a) and Handel's original orchestration of the Royal Fireworks music. Chosen to perform for New York's Governor's Arts Awards in the fall of 1994, the Sylvan Winds have also toured major university and chamber music series nationally, including performances at the University of the Pacific, Amherst College and the Rutgers University Summerfest. Featured as the chamber ensemble in-residence at the White Mountains Festival, the ensemble performed in Korea in the spring of 1993 and has also been heard on New York City radio stations WQXR, WNYC and WBAI, as well as on National Public Radio's Performance Today.\n\nNoted for a wide range and breadth of repertory, the Sylvan Winds have presented a number of New York, United States and world premieres of works by such composers as Gustav Holst, Gunther Schuller, David Chaitkin and Arthur Weisberg. Many of the works they perform are written for a variety of instrumental groupings and have included collaborations with guest artists such as conductor Gerard Schwarz, the Guarneri String Quartet, pianist Claude Frank and Edmund Battersby, harpsichordists Kenneth Cooper and Gerald Ranck, singers Wendy White and D'Anna Fortunato, as well as the American Brass Quintet."
