        "text": "Edmund Gunter (born 1581, Hertfordshire, Eng.â€”died Dec. 10, 1626, London) was an English mathematician who invented many useful measuring devices, including a forerunner of the slide rule.\n\nGunter was professor of astronomy at Gresham College, London, from 1619 until his death. Descriptions of some of his inventions were given in his treatises on the sector, cross-staff, bow, quadrant, and other instruments. In Canon Triangulorum, or Table of Artificial Sines and Tangents (1620), the first published table of common logarithms of the sine and tangent functions, he introduced the terms cosine and cotangent. He also suggested to his friend Henry Briggs, the inventor of common logarithms, the use of the arithmetical complement.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nNumbers and Mathematics"
