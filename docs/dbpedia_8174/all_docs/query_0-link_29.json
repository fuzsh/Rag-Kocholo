        "text": "Who says eclecticism isn’t a wonderful thing? Certainly not us at Navona Records. SLICES is a carefully handpicked selection of new chamber works by contemporary composers designed to showcase the diversity of modern music-making, and these pieces by Sundin, Bakker, Sainsbury, Rusnak, Beeler, and Burns cut right through the oft-repeated misconception that classical music is dead on the vine. With rich sonorities, structural ingenuity, and artistic flair, the composers featured here prove that not only is classical music alive, but it continues to grow and cross-pollinate as well. Get out your best fork and knife, grab your napkin, pull up a chair, and feast!"
