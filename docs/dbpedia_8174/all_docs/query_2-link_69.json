        "text": "Gunter, Edmund\n\n1. Dates\n\nBorn: Hertfordshire, 1581\n\nDied: London, 10 Dec. 1626\n\nDateinfo: Dates Certain\n\nLifespan: 45\n\n2. Father\n\nOccupation: Unknown\n\nAll we know is that Gunter was of Welsh descent.\n\nNo information on financial status.\n\n3. Nationality\n\nBirth: English\n\nCareer: English\n\nDeath: English\n\n4. Education\n\nSchooling: Oxford, M.A., D.D.\n\nWestminster School.\n\nOxford University, 1599-1615; Christ Church; B.A.,1603; M.A.,1605; B.D., 1615.\n\n5. Religion\n\nAffiliation: Anglican\n\nGunter was ordained and was Rector of a church in Southwark.\n\n6. Scientific Disciplines\n\nPrimary: Mathematics, Navigation, Instrumentation\n\nSubordinate: Magnetism\n\nGunter is known as a competent but unoriginal mathematician, whose work was largely of a practical nature. He contributed devices that aided calculations, and indeed instruments of all sorts, and he contributed importantly to mathematically controlled navigation. Thus, New Projection of the Sphere, 1623, and Canon triangularum, 1620, the logarithms of the trigonometric functions primarily for use in navigation. This also came out in English immediately.\n\nHis Description and Use of the Sector, Cross-staffe, and Other Instruments, 1623, described, among other things, a precursor of the slide rule.\n\nGunter was the first to observe the secular variation of magnetic declination.\n\n7. Means of Support\n\nPrimary: Church Life, Academia\n\nRector of St. George's, Southwark, 1615-26.\n\nProfessor of astronomy at Gresham College, 1619-26.\n\n8. Patronage\n\nTypes: Aristrocrat, Scientist, Court Official\n\nHe obtained his rectory through the patronage of the Earl of Bridgewater. Gunter is known to have made one of Oughtred's horizontal instruments for the Duke about 1618.\n\nHe owed his professorship to Briggs' recommendation.\n\nAt the request of Prince Charles (later Charles I) he wrote a book in 1624 on the sundials he installed in the Whitehall Gardens.\n\n9. Technological Involvement\n\nTypes: Instruments, Applied Mathematics, Navigation, Cartography\n\nInvented scientific instruments to simplify calculations: especially Gunter's scale or Gunter's line of numbers, the precursor of the slide rule. His Canon triangulorum was also primarily an aid to calculation.\n\nGunter was a major figure in the introduction of logarithms into navigational practice.\n\nHe developed a new quadrant (Gunter's quadrant) and a new cross staff. He may have invented the log line.\n\nFinally there is Gunter's chain, which long remained one of the basic instruments in surveying. I did not find any reference to actual surveying by Gunter, but I have not been able to understand the chain without assuming such.\n\n10. Scientific Societies\n\nMemberships: None\n\nInformal Connections: Intimate friendship with Henry Briggs and the Gresham group.\n\nSources\n\nDictionary of National Biography (repr., London: Oxford University Press, 1949-50), 8, 793.
