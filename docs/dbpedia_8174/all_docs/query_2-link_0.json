        "text": "Northern Rhodesian folk singer\n\nFor other people named John Edmond, see John Edmond (disambiguation).\n\nJohn Edmond (born 18 November 1936) is a Rhodesian folk singer and retired soldier who became popular in the 1970s for his Rhodesian patriotic songs. He reached the height of his fame during the Rhodesian Bush War where he was sometimes known as the \"Bush Cat\".\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nEdmond was born on 18 November 1936 in Luanshya, Northern Rhodesia (modern day Zambia) to a family of Scottish descent; during his childhood, he and his parents moved between Scotland and Central Africa. He went to school in Luanshya, Northern Rhodesia; Edinburgh, Scotland; and in South Africa at Christian Brothers College in Pretoria. He displayed a natural talent for music at an early age when he was given a mouth organ as a birthday gift from his grandmother at age three. John mastered the instrument within half an hour. As a Boy Scout, he played the bugle and was in the local Scout bugle band. While at school in Edinburgh, he was chosen to sing in the St John's Boys' Choir. He was regularly featured in lead roles at Christian Brothers College in Gilbert and Sullivan operettas. Edmond was lead drummer in the college's pipe band. He went on to win the South African Junior drumming championships at the Royal Scottish gathering at Wembley in 1953. After college, Edmond was employed at the Roan Antelope copper mine.\n\nAfter some time there, Edmond joined Southern Rhodesia's Royal Rhodesia Regiment at Bulawayo. He served with the 3rd Battalion on the Congo border, in Nyasaland and Southern Rhodesia.[2] During this time, he bought a guitar at a trading store and met Bill Coleman while in the army. After learning to play the guitar with Coleman, Edmond formed the Bushcats Skiffle Group in 1958 along with two friends from the army, Eugene van der Watt and Ian Kerr. The group was a success among its peers and progressed into cabaret and rock 'n' roll.[3] After his military service was up, Edmond went to England to study computers and moved to South Africa during the mid-1960s. He became famous in Rhodesia during the Bush War with his album Troopiesongs.[4] He was also a composer, writing such hits as \"The UDI Song\". After the war, and Zimbabwean independence, he continued to record albums such as Zimsongs and Zimtrax.\n\nIn 1982, Edmond's label RAM published The story of Troopiesongs and the Rhodesian Bush War, a collection of lyrics for Troopiesongs, in Johannesburg.[2]\n\nSince 1987, Edmond and his wife Theresa have owned and maintained a resort in South Africa named \"Kunkuru\". The resort is located in the Bela Bela area.[5] Edmond also has his own record label, Roan Antelope Music (RAM).\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbum Year Label Notes Troopiesongs – Phase 1 1976 Map Boom Sha-la-la-lo 1971 Storm Troopiesongs – Phase 2 1977 Map Johno! 1972 Storm Goodbye Is The Saddest Song 1975 Satbel The Greatest Hits of John Edmond 1975 Sounds Superb/EMI Note on back of cover by John Edmond written in English and Afrikaans dated May 1975 Wild And Beautiful And Free 1976 Satbel The Best of John Edmond 1976 Satbel Troopiesongs – Phase 3 1978 Jo'burg Rhodesia The Brave 1979 Trutone Hit Songs of John Edmond 1975 MFP This may also be known as the \"Greatest Hits of John Edmond\" (1975) as the inside record label on the Greatest Hits states that it is the \"Hit Songs of John Edmond\".
