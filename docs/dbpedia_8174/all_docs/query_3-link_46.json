Are you mine to play with?\r\nJoking apart when you&#39;re drunk\r\nYou&#39;re terrific when you&#39;re drunk\r\nI like you mostly late at night - you&#39;re quite all right\r\n\r\nBut I can&#39;t understand the different you\r\nIn the morning when it&#39;s time to play\r\nat being human for a while\r\nPlease smile!\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll be different in the spring, I know\r\nYou&#39;re a seasonal beast\r\nLike the starfish that drifted with the tide, with the tide\r\nSo until your blood runs to meet the next full moon\r\nYour madness fits in nicely with my own, with my own\r\nYour lunacy fits neatly with my own - my very own\r\n\r\nWe&#39;re not alone...",
