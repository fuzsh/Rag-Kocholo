        "text": "Edmund Campion (b. 1957) is Professor of Music Composition and Director at the Center for New Music and Audio Technologies (CNMAT) at the University of California, Berkeley. An internationally recognized composer, performer, and collaborating artist for over 30 years, he continues to produce highly personal music that often mixes emerging technologies with acoustic instruments and electronic sounds. In March of 2024, Professor Campion was a guest composer at the Festival Electrocution in Brest, France, where David Milnes and the Ensemble Sillages premiered Le Sillage(WAKE) for 6 instruments and live electronics at Le Quartz. Improvising Cellist, Danielle DeGruttola was a collaborator and featured guest performer for the premiere. Throughout his career, Campion has collaborated with some truly amazing artists and composers who share an interest in pushing the envelope on what is possible in art and culture. Numerous pieces with the digital artist Claudia Hart include the Alice series and the video piece Recumulations, acquired by the Whitney Museum in 2020. The works generated from this longstanding collaborative art team continue to be experienced in major museums, galleries, online, and in AR/VR environments across the globe. Edmund Campion and John Campion have worked on several pieces that merge language and sound through the lens of brother John's poetry and philosophies. In 2015, the Ensemble Intercontemporain co-commissioned Campion and audiovisual artist Kurt Hentschl√§ger for the 25-minute, Cluster X. The multi-media work was premiered at the Philharmonie de Paris and toured the United States. As a 2016 Guggenheim Fellow, Mr. Campion composed for the Contemporary Gugak Orchestra, an ensemble of 50 musicians performing on ancient Korean instruments."
