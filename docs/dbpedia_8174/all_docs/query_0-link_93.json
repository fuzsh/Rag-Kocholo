        "text": "BloomingtonAddressing last fall\\'s new production of Mozart\\'s \"The Magic Flute\" at the Metropolitan Opera, one created by Julie \"The Lion King\" Taymor, New York Times music critic Anthony Tommasini remarked, \"Ms. Taymor\\'s production is so packed with stage tricks, so peopled with puppets, kite-flyers, dancers and extras of sundry description, that the exceptionally fine musical performance given by the conductor James Levine and a strong cast was overwhelmed.\"Tommasini went on to say that \"the audience gave her a frenzied ovation.\"What local audiences see during the next two weekends, when the IU Opera Theater returns that delightful, radiant work to its repertoire (for the 10th time, no less), is less likely to create so strong a reaction in visual terms. Vincent Liotta, though certainly an imaginative sort, has proved himself to be musically oriented in his stage direction; he honors score and tradition and avoids undue trickery, being of a mind that what composers of such time-tested masterpieces as \"Flute\" left us requires no gimmicks.Besides, he\\'s worked within the confines of sets by now familiar to those who frequent IU performances, still evocative and colorful ones by the late Max Rothlisberger. There are delights for the eye, if my memory serves, but amidst them and story, Mozart\\'s glorious music should stay at stage center. That will be so at least if the two alternating casts have been well chosen and conductor Uriel Segal has done his job, which one suspects will be so. As principal guest conductor with various university orchestras, he\\'s shown himself to be more than capable.For all the desired emphasis on music, the elements of the show are not insignificant in this opera. A dying Mozart himself was said to be anxious to offer the public something of an extravaganza. And certainly, his librettist and instigator of the project, Emanuel Schikaneder, was, too. He ran a theater into which he wanted and needed to bring crowds. \"The Magic Flute\" was designed to do just that. The initial staging was said to be flamboyant with one attendee at the premiere noting that he had seen \"a thousand grotesque forms.\"Mozart meant his opera, or as it is more correctly identified, his \"singspiel,\" to be both comical and inspirational. Schikaneder made sure the story included the absurd and fantastic. Mozart stressed the moral aspects, the always hoped for victory of good over evil, and the beliefs of the Freemasons, to which the composer belonged.\"Flute\" was written at a trying period for him. His health was failing. Death was much on his mind. While working on the opera, he was also engaged with \"La clemenza di Tito,\" trying to finish it, and composing, on mysterious commission, the Requiem Mass. All of which makes the life-affirming and joyous atmosphere of \"The Magic Flute\" that much more remarkable. One wonders how much of himself Mozart saw in the opera\\'s characters: in Tamino, the heroic youth who accepts the sage Sarastro\\'s challenge to seek a higher meaning in life, to seek wisdom and courage; in Papageno, the eat-and-drink-and-be-merry birdcatcher; even in Pamina, the ideal soulmate, the companion Mozart may have wished for in his wife and also wished himself to be.Well, all that\\'s conjecture. What isn\\'t so is an opera that follows a dictate once enunciated by the composer himself: \"Music reigns like a king, and the rest is of no account.\" As always, I look forward to the opportunity of experiencing \"The Magic Flute.\"<H3>A Commemoration</H3>Twenty-five years ago, Thomas Binkley founded IU\\'s Early Music Institute, an act for which that brilliant scholar had been added to the faculty just a year before. Ten years ago this month, the much-admired Binkley died, far ahead of his time.He\\'s to be remembered in a concert planned for the atrium of the IU Art Museum next Saturday evening at 8, part of a symposium sponsored by the Medieval Studies Department. Works by Landini, Zachariah, Egardus, Alanus and folks anonymous will be performed. Those who attend will hear some unusual instruments to establish atmospheres of old with both art music and rustic country music: gemshorns, rebecs, vielles, lute, hurdy-gurdy and more.<H3>High Critical Praise</H3>A New York Times review of a recital at New York\\'s Metropolitan Museum of Art, written by Jeremy Eichler, begins: \"The Canadian violinist Corey Cerovsek is a well-kept secret, at least in New York, where he seldom performs. But Mr. Cerovsek is a formidable talent whose playing combines an exciting spontaneity and a powerful technique with an old-world charm that was no doubt encouraged by his former teacher, Josef Gingold, a great American pedagogue with links to the 19th-century Franco-Belgian violin tradition.\"That\\'s long overdue recognition for a musician we\\'ve watched mature over the years as Corey grew up in Bloomington and at IU. We came to know he\\'s special. Now the word is spreading. More power and success to him!<H3>Magic Flute</H3>WHAT: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\\'s \"The Magic Flute\"WHO: IU Opera Theater; Uriel Segal, conductor; Vicient Liotta, stage directorWHEN: 8 p.m. Friday, Saturday and April 15 and 16WHERE: IU\\'s Musical Arts Center, on Jordan Avenue between Third and Seventh streets, BloomingtonHOW MUCH: $15-$30, $10-$20 for studentsINFO: Call (812) 855-2255<h3>Showtimes</h3>BLOOMINGTON &#151; Two noteworthy orchestral concerts unfortunately intersect this evening, forcing a choice music lovers would rather not have to make:<li> At 7 in Carmichael Hall of Bloomington High School South, the Bloomington Camerata, returning after a 13-month hiatus, offers \"An American Salute\" &#151; music of Leonard Bernstein, George Gershwin, Harold Arlen, Vernon Duke and Aaron Copland &#151; under the baton of guest conductor William McGlaughlin (he of \"St. Paul Sunday\" on National Public Radio) and with the noted soprano Sylvia McNair and Bloomington favorite, pianist Charles Webb, as soloists.
