He began his professional career in 1951 at age 16 when he was hired as a piccolo player in the Denver Symphony. At age 19, he became the youngest contracted musician ever to join the 20th Century Fox studio orchestra under the legendary Hollywood composer and conductor Alfred Newman.\n\nIn 1958, Sheridon was drafted in the US Army where he performed with the 7th Army Symphony in Germany.\n\nReturning to the U.S., Sheridon quickly became a coveted \"first call\" recording artist, performing on literally hundreds of movies and television shows over a career that would span more than six decades. He worked closely with virtually every legendary composer of the time, including Lalo Schifrin for whom he performed the signature flute theme for the television series \"Mission: Impossible\" in 1967. The two collaborated on many projects in the decades that followed, including the Academy Award-nominated score for the film \"The Fox\" in 1968. Stokes was also John Williams' principal flute for many years and performed on some of Williams' most famous scores including solos on \"Jaws,\" \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\" \"1941,\" \"E.T.,\" and \"The Witches of Eastwick.\" In the early 1970s, he also premiered Williams' Flute Concerto at UCLA, one of the composer's first works for the concert hall.\n\nSheridon was also solo flute at the Academy Awards in 1997, 1998, and 2008. At the 1998 ceremony he played the famous penny whistle solo from the film \"Titanic\" for the song “My Heart Will Go On” with Céline Dion.\n\nIn the 1970s Sheridon began teaching flute at UCLA where he would remain for 45 years and eventually be named Senior Lecturer and Professor Emeritus. He took immense joy in engaging with young minds, teaching them not only the tricks of the instrument, but of the business they were about to enter. He often took his classes out on his sailboat as a post-graduation treat. Many of Stokes' students went on to become members of prestigious symphony orchestras around the world.\n\nSheridon wrote several music books including the mainstays, \"The Illustrated Method for Flute\" and \"Special Effects for Flute (with Richard A. Condon).\" His works are still considered canonic by many musicians to this day. At the time of his passing he was wrapping up work on his own memoir, \"Sheridon Stokes: The Hollywood Flutist, Stories from the Recording Business.\"\n\nStokes received the MVP award in flute from the National Association of Recording Arts and Sciences in 1980, 1981, and 1982, and in 1983 received the organization's Emeritus award. He won the National Flute Association’s International Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005.\n\nAfter retiring from the recording and teaching worlds, Sheridon remained busy traveling between residences in Westwood, CA and Bodega Bay, CA with his wife of more than 30 years, Ann Stokes, formerly a dancer with the Starlight Opera and a private tutor at St. Martin of Tours in Brentwood, CA. He and Ann, both sailing enthusiasts, continued to enjoy the sea.\n\nStokes regularly attended national flute and music industry conventions, frequently in his capacity as a longtime celebrity endorser for Pearl Flutes, where he would often perform original works. He relished speaking about his life in music and taught master classes around the world. In 2007 he was soloist in La Mancha, Spain with the Murcia Chamber Orchestra. In 2019 Stokes not only enjoyed but participated in a tribute concert in his honor at Zipper Hall in Los Angeles, where he performed world premiere works by German composer Jürgen Kramlofsky.\n\nStokes recently took part in the \"L.A. Studio Legends\" podcast series on The Legacy of John Williams (https://bit.ly/3yUZ4EZ). He was also one of the guests of the video special \"L.A. Studio Legends: The Reunion\" (https://youtu.be/-ANAJK-hu_s), where he joined former colleagues in an insightful and lively discussion about working in the recording industry.\n\nSheridon Stokes is survived by wife Ann Stokes, son Michael Stokes, daughter Sylvia Gray, sisters Marsi Stokes Caratti and Kathleen Stokes, and a large extended family.\n\nA community of friends, past associates, and well wishers is currently active on Stokes' Facebook page (facebook.com/sheridonstokes).

The publicﾕs knowledge of the flute as a jazz instrument seems to range between the acquired taste of the avant-garde and the abyss known as pop-jazz. Holly Hofmann clearly defines the jazz flute. Her robust tone is the result of a rich classical background. Critics have labeled Holly the most authoritative, swinging flutist in jazz today. In addition to performing throughout the world, she also composes, conducts clinics and workshops, and books a number of jazz concert series.Born near Cleveland, Ohio, Holly at five began playing standards with her father, a jazz guitarist. Early exposure to jazz and popular standards would blossom into a love for straight-ahead jazz, but her parents were insistent that she have a solid background in classical technique. When she turned seven her formal education began with lessons with Walter Mayhall and soon thereafter from the first flutist of the Cleveland Orchestra, Maurice Sharp. Hollyﾕs music education continued through high school at Interlochen Arts Academy. She graduated with a bachelor's degree from the Cleveland Institute of Music and a master's degree from the University of Northern Colorado. During the summers Holly went to New York to study with Frank Wess and Slide Hampton and began sitting in at jam sessions and learning the necessary jazz standard repertoire. It was their encouragement that convinced her to try to have a career in jazz flute.After Holly moved from Colorado to San Diego in 1985 she began working with bassist Bob Magnusson and pianist Mike Wofford at the Horton Grand Hotel. Subsequently she booked a four night national jazz program there from 1989-1996, presenting hundreds of jazz artists including Diana Krall, Cassandra Wilson, Tommy Flanagan and Joe Henderson. It was during this time, in the early ﾔ90s that she began recording, and formed an important partnership with Los Angeles pianist Bill Cunliffe. The two toured festivals and chamber venues worldwide presenting both jazz and classical compositions in brilliantly seamless arrangements. They recorded Just Duet, Volume 1 and 2 as well as an organ trio with guitarist Frank Potenza and Duncan Moore, and Live at Birdland in a quartet with legendary bassist, Ray Brown and drummer, Victor Lewis. Holly and Ray began working in New York at the Village Vangard on a yearly basis in the mid 90s and in 2000, Brown began taking her on tours of the US and Europe as a guest with his trio. She credits Brownﾕs support as one of the major turning points in her career and recalls that each performance with him was a learning experience.In 2000 Holly married pianist Mike Wofford, often working with him in a quartet setting with Brown, Peter Washington, Jeff Hamilton, Victor Lewis and Ben Riley.
