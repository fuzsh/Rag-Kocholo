With the exception of this particular type of flute, all wind instruments have some intermediate device that helps to produce the sound. This device could be a single or double reed or a mouthpiece for brass-players and even constructed wind-channels for tone production as in recorders and pipe-organs. The transverse flute, instead, necessitates a refined and peculiar lip position (the embouchure) which can be the cause of a variety of difficulties if the player is not aware of what is involved to produce a pure and malleable tone.\n\nIn writing this book of instructions, I owe much of the information you will find here to excellent flutists and teachers such as Hugo Haldemann and Aurèle Nicolet (Switzerland), Jean-Pierre Rampal (France) and Emil Niosi (USA). I am deeply grateful for the dedication of these musicians in passing their knowledge on to me. Being now retired from orchestral duties and having been involved in teaching at all levels, from the beginner to the professional, I feel that it is a pleasure and an obligation to pass on the observations and conclusions I gained as a life-long teacher.\n\nIf my observations are useful to help overcoming difficulties that may arise in the process of learning to play the flute, it will fulfill my aspiration and give me deep satisfaction.\n\nAt this point I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Gisela Vief and Mrs. Lore Tomas-Pittet for their help and dedication in giving editing advice. I also thank Mrs. Bea Steiger for her patience in posing for the pictures.\n\nI\n\nTHE TONE (SOUND)\n\nMusic is made-up of different types of tones:\n\n- long and short ones (= duration)\n\n- loud and soft ones (= volume)\n\n- high and low ones (= tonal extension/compass/pitch)\n\n- with aggressive or mild attacks (tonguing)\n\n- with straight or vibrating tonal emission (expression)\n\n- with mellow tonal characteristic (dolce) or dark colored sound (espressivo)\n\nand every imaginable combination of the above.\n\nAll of these tonal manifestations depend on the vibration of air-molecules that are being excited in your instrument and being transmitted to your and/or the listener’s ears. These vibrations are being decoded in your inner ear to reach your brain where they are being perceived as sound or noise.\n\nOur task is to find out what the instrument (your flute) absolutely needs in order to produce all these afore-mentioned varieties of tones. It is important that you realize that your instrument needs to be explored to find out how it will respond and not that you try to impose your will and physical force on it. The latter, without fail, is going to produce an unsatisfactory tonal result and will hamper the fluency and subtlety of your musical expression.\n\nII\n\nTO HOLD THE FLUTE CORRECTLY\n\nOne of the most important aspects of holding the flute is to avoid physical tension—tension is the flute player’s worst enemy. In order to be able to play the flute with a maximum of comfort, we need to find a way to position our body so as to permit ease of breathing, economy of muscular activity, and flexibility of finger movement. This will ensure fluent and effortless playing results.\n\nFirst we analyze our body"
