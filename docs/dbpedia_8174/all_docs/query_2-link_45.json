        "text": "B Minor Mass at Aspen\n\nPROGRAM\n\nJ. S. BACH: Mass in B minor, BWV 232\n\nApplauded by Gramophone for its “mellifluous, crystalline artistry,” the professional choral ensemble Seraphic Fire has gained an international reputation. Hear them in one of the most sublime and majestic works ever composed, Bach’s B minor Mass.\n\nWhy the Lutheran Bach wrote a Catholic Mass remains a mystery, but we do know that he intended it to be a summation of his life’s work that would serve as a legacy. It may very well have been his last musical project. The Swiss composer and publisher Hans Georg Nägli called it “the greatest artwork of all times and all people,” (admittedly to drum up sales for the composition’s score). The cohesiveness of this massive work is somewhat astonishing considering that much of it was adapted from earlier Bach compositions, and that it runs a stylistic gamut from 16th century Palestrina-like motets to the latest 18th century trends. It’s also astonishing that Bach probably never heard the work himself since it received little notice outside of the handful of churches which performed it during his life. Most astonishing of all is the piece itself, whose divine beauty and awe-inspiring glory has been compared to the works of Shakespeare and the Sistine Chapel.\n\nExperience one of the most magnificent expressions of faith ever created, performed by the superb Seraphic Fire and an orchestra conducted by AMFS Music Director Robert Spano.\n\nView Event →\n\nSanta Fe Desert Chorale\n\nEdmund makes his SFDC debut in two concert programs:\n\nOut of this World\n\nArlen: Out of this World (arr.

A malhar is an Indian raga designed to beckon the rain; Esmail’s A Requiem for Water captures musically the beauty and awe of water while contemplating the fear and despair that surround its loss. As water exists beyond all beginnings and ends, Memory of Water considers the consciousness of water and how it carries in its memory both the splendor and devastation of our world.\n\nThe Choir of Trinity Wall Street; Downtown Voices; NOVUS NY; featuring Sandbox Percussion and Shabnam Abedi, soprano; Stephen Sands and Melissa Attebury, conductors\n\nView Event →\n\nShall we gather at the river\n\nFor more than 400 years, the Black American spiritual tradition has moved over, across, and through the waters—waters of life force, passage, cleansing, resistance, and renewal—depicted in such songs and verses as “Wade in the Water,” “Deep River,” “Crossing Jordan,” and “By the Waters of Babylon.”\n\nThe power of water and its spiritual dimensions equally resonates in the beautiful, sacred texts of Bach’s cantatas. Infused with poetry, Bach’s music sounds and speaks to every drop of water, in drought and in full flood, moving and alive.\n\nThese two musical sources flow together in an act of awakening, mobilization, and restorative beauty in the face of climate change. The Oxford Bach Soloists under the music direction of Tom Hammond-Davies and The Choir of Trinity Wall Street are joined by countertenor Reginald Mobley, tenor Nick Pritchard, and sheng player Wu Tong to perform a selection of Bach cantatas intermingled with spirituals in a staging by the celebrated director Peter Sellars. This musical call to action illuminates the undeniable truth that water is life, and that music is a universal language that can unite and inspire.\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nCo-Commissioned with the Asia Society as part of COAL + ICE: Inspiring Climate Action Through Art and Ideas, on view February 13-–August 11, 2024.\n\nSoprano Molly Quinn\n\nCountertenor Reginald Mobley\n\nTenor Nick Pritchard\n\nBass-baritone Jonathan Woody\n\nSheng Wu Tong\n\nOxford Bach Soloists\n\nThe Choir of Trinity Wall Street\n\nConductor Tom Hammond-Davies\n\nDirection Peter Sellars\n\nChoreographer Reggie (Regg Roc) Gray and members of the flexn community\n\nLighting Designer Seth Reiser\n\nSound Design Mark Grey\n\nView Event →\n\nGamut Bach Ensemble: Cantatas\n\nEdmund joins the Gamut Bach Ensemble under the direction of Koji Otsuki for this concert featuring several solo vocal works of J.S.

You’ll likely discover a mid-century work you’ve never heard before on this program for a cappella chorus.”\n\nView Event →\n\nHaydn's Creation with Washington Bach Consort\n\nCompleted five decades after Bach’s death, Die Schöpfung (The Creation) offers a significant milestone in the development of the oratorio genre. Strongly influenced by Handel’s definitive examples of the high Baroque, Haydn’s Creation conveys Gottfried van Swieten’s German libretto in sharp musical focus, with vivid characterizations of the creation story described in the book of Genesis. Beginning with the captivating orchestral representation of Chaos, we experience a world brought into beautiful order in seven days, culminating with the union of Adam and Eve. This epic work is best experienced live, sung in the language of its premiere performance (German) and played on period instruments of the Classical era, allowing for the deepest possible level of connection with the musical drama.\n\nMichele Kennedy, soprano\n\nThomas Cooley, tenor\n\nEdmund Milly, bass\n\nJoin us for Talking Bach at 3 p.m. The series of free pre-concert lectures by noted Bach scholar, Michael Marissen, are presented one hour before Director’s Series performances.\n\nView Event →\n\nNumber Our Days: A Photographic Oratorio\n\nHow can we hold onto each other with joy, even in the face of inevitable loss?\n\nEach day for 18 years, Jamie Livingston documented his life by taking a single Polaroid—until his death at age 41.
