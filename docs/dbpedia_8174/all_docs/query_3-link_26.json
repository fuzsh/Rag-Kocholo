        "text": "Come fall under a musical spell with internationally touring singer and violinist Edmund Bagnell (1st violinist Well Strung) in This Magic Moment, a musical celebration of wondrous moments big and small. Not limited to a single genre, the evening will include Standards, Pop, Broadway, Disco, Country, and of course Classical mashups, and beyond. Pianist Mark Hartman will join Edmund on stage for this magical evening of music and stories.\n\nBiography: “Be it music made with lightning fast fingers on a fiddle, or a honeyed voice of dulcet notes both powerful or peaceful, it is a pleasure to watch this man at work.” (Broadway World). Edmund tours internationally as a solo performer in addition to performing 1st violin and vocals in the singing string quartet, Well Strung. In 2020, he released his first solo album, Christmas at Home, which was included on several best of lists including USA Today, and this past fall he released a new EP, The Road, which includes the original songs The Water and The Road. Edmund Bagnell performs as an actor, violinist, and singer — and has been recognized for his “hauntingly sweet voice” (SF Gate) and “luscious vocals” (BritishTheatre.com). As an actor he was cast as Tobias Ragg during his senior year at NYU in the 1st National Tour of John Doyle’s staging of Sweeney Todd. Edmund’s shows feature a mix of vocals and violin and explore a wide variety of musical styles from pop, to standards, to classical, and even disco. At a recent show in NYC, his “smile took over the entire stage when he began his show at Birdland, and when he finished, the entire audience was smiling just as wide.” (Times Square Chronicle) Visit edmund-Bagnell.com to see and hear more."
