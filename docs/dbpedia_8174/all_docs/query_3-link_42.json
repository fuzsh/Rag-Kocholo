He holds degrees from Cambridge University (MA) and the Guildhall School of Music & Drama (MMus). From 2004-2011 he was a Music Professor at the Guildhall School, teaching history, theory and aesthetics of music.\n\nDuring his time in London, Edmund enjoyed a varied career as an opera and concert singer, organist, pianist and teacher. In opera he performed major roles around the UK, in France and the Netherlands, and worked with conductors including Vladimir Jurowski, Sir Mark Elder and David Parry; in concert he was baritone soloist for Sir David Willcocks, David Hill and Bob Chilcott, and continuo organist for Sir John Eliot Gardiner, amongst others. Edmund also performed and recorded frequently with professional ensembles such as the BBC Singers, the Gabrieli Consort and the Dmitri Ensemble.\n\nIn February 2012 Edmund moved to Albuquerque, taking up the post of Assistant Organist-Choir Director at the Episcopal Cathedral of St. John. In 2013 he was appointed Upper School Chorus Director at Albuquerque Academy. He continues to perform frequently as a soloist with the New Mexico Philharmonic (Brahms Ein Deutsches Requiem, Bach Johannes Passion), with Polyphony: Voices of New Mexico (Handel Messiah, Donald McCullough Holocaust Cantata), and in recital with the duo Air & Hammers. Edmund maintains a private voice studio in Albuquerque. www.edmundconnolly.com"
