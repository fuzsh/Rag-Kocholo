        "text": "Blessed Edmund – model of trust in Divine Providence\n\nV. Blessed Edmund, often you expressed your unshaken trust in Divine Providence. You acknowledged: “O how marvelous are the ways of Providence” Dairy 19.04.1853 – this was your delight over the goodness of God, His foresight and wise direction. Blessed Edmund, your trust in Divine Providence expressed in undertaking tasks, humanly speaking, exceeding your strength. You knew, however, that you are an instrument in God’s hands. In difficult moments the only strength was your faith in God’s power and assistance, with which God rushed to rescue. You expressed then your deep gratitude: “To my evening prayers I added heartfelt prayers of thanksgiving for the day… […], in which God showed so much mercy and His marvelous Providence. Teach us, Blessed Edmund, your trust, so that we would not yield to discouragement. Obtain for us faith that God sees all our needs with the eye of His marvelous Providence.\n\nAmen.\n\nV. Hail Mary…\n\nV. Blessed Edmund,\n\nR. Pray for us.\n\nBlessed Edmund – fervent adorer of the Eucharist\n\nV. For you, Blessed Edmund, the Eucharist was the center of life, the most important event of the day. From the altar you drew the necessary energy for each moment. You received the Eucharist as the greatest treasure, gift of God’s love. You cherished the great value of frequent Holy Communion and desired that others would also understand how precious this gift is.Blessed Edmund, you spent many hours in church, and the strength derived from the Eucharist led you to people, whom you served, for in them you saw Jesus. Blessed Edmund, help us through the example of your fervent faith and continue to teach us to further understand more deeply the mystery of the Eucharist. Grant through your intercession that constantly being nourished by the Bread of Life, we would reach the final aim – to abide with Jesus through the whole eternity.\n\nAmen.\n\nV. Hail Mary\n\nV. Blessed Edmund,\n\nR. Pray for us.\n\nBlessed Edmund – ardent admirer of Mary Immaculate\n\nV. Our Blessed Edmund, your entire life was marked by a deep devotion to the Mother of God. You turned to her in every sorrow. You rendered to her your undertaking and plans. You knew, taught by experience that she can be relied upon. Often you reflected upon the mysteries of Mary’s life; you taught others to love her, and when the Congregation was bought into being, you named it the Little Servants of Mary. You desired that over each nursery, Mary of Jasna Gora would reign, and within, resound the hymn Bogurodzica (Mother of God) and the echo of the rosary and the Litany of Loreto. Blessed Edmund, teach us to love Mary, as you loved her, and taker her to oneself, so that Mary would prepare a place for Jesus in our hearts and lead us onto the eternal banquet of love in the heavenly kingdom.\n\nAmen.\n\nV. Hail Mary…\n\nV. Blessed Edmund,\n\nR. Pray for us.\n\nBlessed Edmund – person of fervent prayer\n\nV. Blessed Edmund, we turn to you as the model of simple and profound prayer. Your entire lifde was permeated by it. Prayer was the strength for extensive action for the good of neighbors. You were able to pray, “no longer with words and thoughts, but solely with the heart and the fullness of the spirit” (Dairy 30.08.1854). In the final stages of life you persevered in ceaseless prayer, in union with God: “I concluded prayer, which I do not know when I started.” Teach us, Blessed Edmund, such fervent and transforming prayer. We desire, like you, to harmoniously unite action and contemplation. Entreat for us from God the grace of continual prayer, that in working for neighbors, we would preserve always in the presence of God.\n\nAmen.\n\nV. Hail Mary…\n\nV. Blessed Edmund,\n\nR. Pray for us.\n\nBlessed Edmund – a person with a simple heart\n\nV. Blessed Edmund, you discovered the value and beauty of evangelical simplicity and in its spirit you formed the community of Little Servants. You wanted that they be evident witnesses of the Gospel, visible signs of Christ operating in His Church. The final recommendation, which you gave the Sisters before your death, pertained precisely to simplicity: “Above all, I commend simplicity.” Blessed Edmund, you yourself were a person with a simple heart; you were like, “an open valley wherein the Holy Spirit accustomed to overflow.” Obtain for us from God the spirit of simplicity and humility in thoughts, words and in deeds. We desire to be simple like a child towards God, people and daily matters. Teach us to be straightforward, and therefore approachable in the style of life, words, gestures, so that those who come to us would experience hospitality, which you also bestowed upon all. We need humility and simplicity, therefore, we entreat you to obtain it for us from God. May our paths to God and to humankind be simple in life and in service.\n\nAmen.\n\nV. Hail Mary…\n\nV. Blessed Edmund,\n\nR. Pray for us.\n\nBlessed Edmund – a cordially good man\n\nV. Blessed Edmund, you were a man with an immensely sensitive heart to the needs of others, to their spiritual and material misery. In the minds of people you revealed yourself as a compassionate person, not neglecting any occasion to help the needy. God through your hands showed His Providence towards children, the ill and the poor. Blessed Edmund, you were able to love those whom others scorned, lost in the eyes of this world; the poor, who surrounded you. They reached out to you because they perceived your goodness and sensitivity to their needs. Blessed Edmund, obtain for us the grace of an open heart, so that in the poor we would recognize the features of Christ – defenseless in the stable ad suffering n the cross. O “cordially good man”, we pray that at the end if our life it may be said about us: Their entire life was “one thread of love, continual remembrance of Him who suffers, but the forgetfulness of self, and unceasing mercy”.\n\nAmen.\n\nV. Hail Mary…\n\nV. Blessed Edmund,\n\nR. Pray for us.\n\nBlessed Edmund – model of patience in opposition\n\nV. Blessed Edmund, repeatedly in your life you experienced various difficult situations: you endured them on your knees, commending them to God: “I bought to God as an offering my aching heart. I prayed ardently, but not in words, not in thought, only in strained feelings of my whole heart. I appealed to the most merciful God to give me the grace of perseverance and complete submission to His holy will”. Blessed Edmund, you are for us a model of conduct when adversities approach; illness, suspicions, unfavorable judgements; uncertainties, difficult material situations. You showed us by your life that it is worthwhile to entrust oneself to God and allow oneself to be led, since God is Love and even though he sometimes permits incomprehensible events beyond one’s understanding, He never disappoints. Teach us, Blessed Edmund, such patience in times of trail, as you had, that we would victoriously overcome life’s adversities and would meet you at the banquet of eternal joy in heaven.\n\nAmen.\n\nV. Hail Mary…\n\nV. Blessed Edmund,\n\nR. Pray for us.\n\nBlessed Edmund – unifying many around goodness\n\nV. Blessed Edmund, you knew that alone you could not remedy human misery; therefore, you expanded the circle of people of good will, who together with you diminished the extent of this misery. You were able to engage other in good works; you wanted to prevent indifference towards the needs of neighbors, overcome barriers of distrust, remove mutual prejudice and build interpersonal bonds. You eagerly desired that we would persist in mutual love. With frail lips you repeated: “Love one another.” You knew that the witness of love in community, gathered in the name of Christ, is a guarantee of a fruitful apostolate, that mutual love – this distinctive element of goodness, which joined together, creates a strong chain disabling evil. Blessed Edmund – “a sincerely good man” – drawing others towards goodness, teach us such mutual love as gladdens the Divine Heart and send blessings upon the people God.\n\nAmen.V. Hail Mary…\n\nV. Blessed Edmund,\n\nR. Pray for us.\n\nBlessed Edmund Bojanowski – our Father\n\nV. We call you Blessed Edmund, our Father because you surround the Congregation founded by you with fatherly care. We thank you, Blessed Edmund, for your authentic love which you continuously bestow upon us. God called you to spiritual fatherhood for us. We thank you for the witness of mature responsibility, for patient waiting for our development, for sharing your spiritual wealth, for setting conditions and the care showed to us. We know, that you still love us as a community of persons close to your heart. We need that fatherly palms of your hands, which will guide us safely amid life’s adversities. We need your sensitive heart for the quietest call for help. Incline to us with love and be an intercessor before the eternal Father, who is in heaven.\n\nAmen.V. Hail Mary…\n\nV. Blessed Edmund,\n\nR. Pray for us."
