        "text": "I love the bass clarinet. I don’t perform with it in ensembles as much as my normal soprano clarinet, but it has not stopped me from playing with it whenever it get the chance. Last year, I even had the pleasure of being dubbed the Gettysburg College Wind Symphony’s sole contrabass clarinetist (one octave lower than the standard bass clarinet), whenever there was a part for it. Needless to say, I was really excited.\n\nThe truth is, while the standard clarinet part consists mainly of higher melodic parts, the bass clarinet parts are either low-pitched drones, or, in the case of more modern pieces such as Frank Ticheli’s Angels in the Architecture or John Mackey’s Strange Humors, really cool bass lines. And the contrabass is no different. There is also the octocontrabass clarinet, which is yet another octave lower than the contrabass. According to a clarinet professor I met at a music camp in high school, its somewhere in France. You can explore this further if you wish at www.contrabass.com, but for now, I’m going to continue talking about the bass clarinet we all know and love.\n\nThe bass clarinet has also found its way into other genres of music. This applies mainly to jazz,\n\nbut, a few years ago, I stumbled upon a band called Edmund Welles.\n\nA cover of “Creep” by Radiohead, performed by Edmund Welles\n\nAccording to the bio on their website, Edmund Welles is, “the world’s only original, composing band of four bass clarinetists,” and they describe their music with the genre “Heavy Chamber”. The group writes most of their own pieces and performs of covers of song by bands such as Black Sabbath, Spinal Tap, Nirvana, and several other rock groups.\n\nTheir music is amazing. Over the years of curiously noodling with my bass clarinet and the contrabass, I have heard some interesting noises, but nothing on this scale. Each member of the group has virtuosic control over their instrument, and has the skill to unlock the full range of its abilities. Their website also claims that the bass clarinet has a whopping 5-octave range, and as you can tell from listening to any of their recordings, they utilize it, along with various extended techniques such as bending, growling, multi-phonics, and throat singing. In short, they are like nothing I have ever heard before.\n\nEdmund Welles currently has three albums available: Tooth & Claw (2007), Agrippa’s 3 Books by Edmund Welles (2005), and Muzak for Devils: Selected Works (2003). The first two are readily available on iTunes, but the third and oldest of the three is no longer available anywhere (trust me, I’ve tried, and if you manage to find it, please let me know!) They are also releasing a new album titled Imagination Lost, which will be on iTunes August 1st.\n\nLinks:"
