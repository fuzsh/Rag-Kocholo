        "text": "Edmund Kean (born March 17?, 1789, London, England—died May 15, 1833, London) was one of the greatest of English tragic actors, a turbulent genius noted as much for his megalomania and ungovernable behaviour as for his portrayals of villains in Shakespearean plays.\n\nThough no official record of his birth exists, it has been well established that he was born out of wedlock to Ann Carey, who described herself as an itinerant actress and street hawker, and Edmund Kean, a mentally unbalanced youth who committed suicide at the age of 22. The story of Kean’s upbringing is overladen with legend, much of it the product of his own later fantasies, but during his formative years he was in the charge of Charlotte Tidswell, mistress of Moses Kean, his father’s eldest brother. Tidswell, then a small-part member of the Drury Lane Theatre Company, was the cast-off mistress of Charles Howard, the 11th duke of Norfolk. Extremely ambitious for her adopted child, she gave Edmund both an early stage training and the rudiments of a general education. Her efforts to provide a disciplined home background were defeated, however, by his willfulness and vagrancy, and for much of his childhood he lived as a waif and stray.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nAt the age of 15 he was his own master and set out to conquer the stage, the only world he knew. Joining the company of one Samuel Jerrold at Sheerness, Kent, for 15 shillings a week, he engaged to “play the whole round of tragedy, comedy, opera, farce, interlude and pantomime.” The ensuing 10-year struggle was especially hard for him to endure, not only because of the privations of a strolling player’s existence but also because it prolonged the agony of his frustrated ambition. In 1808 he married Mary Chambers, a fellow member of his theatrical company.\n\nKean’s long apprenticeship left scars, particularly an addiction to alcohol, which he had come to rely on as a substitute for recognition. But the experience of adversity may well have been essential to his artistic achievement. By the standards of the time, he was unsuited to the great tragic roles. The style then in vogue was artificial, declamatory, and statuesque, and its leading exponent, John Philip Kemble, was an actor of classic good looks, imposing figure, and vocal eloquence. Though Kean had handsome features, notably unusually expressive eyes, he was small, with a voice that was harsh, forceful, and commanding rather than melodious. He could never have hoped to compete with Kemble on Kemble’s terms, so he had to become an innovator as well as a virtuoso. On January 26, 1814, when he made his Drury Lane debut as Shylock in Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice, the measure of his triumph was not to outshine Kemble but to outmode him.\n\nIn his portrayal of Shylock, Kean donned a black beard instead of the traditional comic red beard and wig and played the Jewish moneylender as a frenzied and embittered monster of evil armed with a butcher knife. His performance created a sensation, and Kean quickly brought forward a succession of Shakespearean villains, most notably Richard III, Iago, and Macbeth. He also excelled at playing Othello and Hamlet. His great non-Shakespearean roles were as Sir Giles Overreach in Philip Massinger’s A New Way to Pay Old Debts and as Barabas in Christopher Marlowe’s The Jew of Malta.\n\nAs an actor Kean relied on his own forceful and turbulent personality and on sudden transitions of voice and facial expression. There was nothing improvised about his performances, however. Technically they were carefully planned, and it was said of his portrayal of Othello that, with its unvarying tones and semitones, rests and breaks, forte and piano, crescendo and diminuendo, it might have been read from a musical score. His range was limited, however. He excelled at malign roles but usually failed at parts calling for nobility, virtue, tenderness, or comic talent. As the grim archvillain in A New Way to Pay Old Debts, Kean was so convincing as a rapacious extortioner that he was reputed to have sent the poet Lord Byron into convulsions; but as Romeo he was almost laughably unpersuasive. While he helped usher out declamatory acting, the extent of his direct influence on later performers is questionable.\n\nThough Kean remained a passionately admired actor, as a public figure he became increasingly unpopular. Haunted by his fear of losing his position as head of the British stage, he was betrayed into displays of jealousy against potential rivals. At the same time, his fame and fortune (he earned, on the average, £10,000 a year) were insufficient to satisfy his ambitions. The climax came in 1825, when he was successfully sued for adultery with a woman whose husband was a city alderman and a Drury Lane administrator. This provided the pretext for a virulent press campaign, in which he was subjected to hostile demonstrations in England and during his second, and last, tour of the United States. The last eight years of his life were a story of slow suicide by drink and other excesses."
