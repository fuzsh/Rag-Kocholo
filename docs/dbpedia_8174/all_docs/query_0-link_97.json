        "text": "Widely recognised as one of Britain’s leading flute players, Juliette Bausor began her studies with Anna Pope at the junior department of the Royal Academy of Music and Purcell School of Music, before going on to study with Philippa Davies, Paul Edmund Davies and Samuel Coles at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. She continued her tuition at the Conservatoire Nationale Supérieur de Musique et de Danse in Paris, with Sophie Cherrier and Vincent Lucas.\n\nFollowing international success in competitions, including early recognition in reaching the televised Concerto Final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year and winning the Gold Medal in both the Shell LSO Competition and the Royal Over-Seas League Competition, Juliette has appeared as a concerto soloist with orchestras such as the London Symphony Orchestra, Ulster Orchestra, Academy of St Martins in the Fields, European Union Chamber Orchestra, Royal Northern Sinfonia and London Mozart Players, with conductors including Yannick Nézet-Séguin, Thomas Zehetmair, Mario Venzago and Sir Neville Marriner. Success on an international scale is reflected in tours around Europe and beyond, to Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, the United Arab Emirates, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn 2014 Juliette Bausor was selected by the European Concert Hall Organisation as an ECHO Rising Star. Juliette has since been invited to perform as a soloist in some of Europe’s most prestigious concert venues, including Laeiszhalle Hamburg, Het Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, the Bozar in Brussels, Town Hall Birmingham, Palace of Arts in Budapest, Vienna Musikverein, Stockholm Konserthus, L’Auditori in Barcelona, Konzerthaus Dortmund, Philharmonie Luxembourg, Sage Gateshead and the Barbican Centre in London.\n\nAlso highly regarded as a chamber musician, Juliette is a member of the celebrated chamber group Ensemble 360, resident at the Crucible in Sheffield. In addition to the Ensemble’s busy concert schedule, Juliette is regularly invited to give recitals at major venues and festivals throughout the UK, including frequent Wigmore Hall and South Bank appearances, and performances at the Edinburgh, Cheltenham and Aldeburgh International Festivals and BBC Proms. Juliette has collaborated with many other leading chamber musicians, including Thomas Zehetmair (violin), Alasdair Beatson and Llyr Williams (piano), Kate Royal (soprano), Anneleen Lenaerts and Catrin Finch (harp), as well as the Coull, Elias, Badke, Carducci and Edinburgh String Quartets amongst others. Recent chamber recital highlights include a concert with the wind principals of Royal Northern Sinfonia and Christian Blackshaw (piano) as part of the BBC Proms 2015, as well as performances at the Presteigne Festival, with Sally Pryce (harp), and at the West Cork Chamber Music Festival alongside Katharine Dain (soprano), Lise Berthaud (viola) and Cliona Doris (harp).\n\nJuliette is principal flute with both Royal Northern Sinfonia and London Mozart Players, and frequently appears as guest principal flute with orchestras all over Britain, notably with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, Philharmonia, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, BBC National Orchestra of Wales, Scottish Chamber Orchestra, London Sinfonietta and Britten Sinfonia.\n\nless\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart, whose actual name is Joannes Chrysotomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart, was a composer, pianist, violinist and conductor from the classical period, born in Salzburg. Mozart was a child prodigy. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. Along with Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven, Mozart is considered to be one of the most influential composers of all of music's history. Within the classical tradition, he was able to develop new musical concepts which left an everlasting impression on all the composers that came after him. Together with Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven he is part of the First Viennese School. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position. From 1763 he traveled with his family through all of Europe for three years and from 1769 he traveled to Italy and France with his father Leopold after which he took residence in Paris. On July 3rd, 1778, his mother passed away and after a short stay in Munich with the Weber family, his father urged him to return to Salzburg, where he was once again hired by the Bishop. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his death.\n\nless"
