        "text": "Sir Edmund Gosse (born September 21, 1849, London, Englandâ€”died May 16, 1928, London) was an English translator, literary historian, and critic who introduced the work of Henrik Ibsen and other continental European writers to English readers.\n\nGosse was the only child of the naturalist Philip Henry Gosse. His mother having died when he was young, he was taken by his father to St. Mary Church, near Torquay, Devon, where he grew up, attending neighbouring schools. Living in a strict religious household, he came to know nonreligious poetry, fiction, and other literature only surreptitiously. He nevertheless secured employment on the library staff of the British Museum from 1865 to 1875, was a translator for the Board of Trade for some 30 years, lectured on English literature at Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1885 to 1890, and finally was librarian to the House of Lords from 1904 to 1914."
