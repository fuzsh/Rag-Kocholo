        "text": "Edmund Campion is currently Professor of Music Composition and Director at the Center for New Music and Audio Technologies at the University of California, Berkeley. He has received the American Rome Prize, the Lili Boulanger Prize, The Paul Fromm Award at Tanglewood, and most recently, the Goddard Lieberson Fellowship given by the American Academy in Rome. Recent commissions include the 2011 Commande d’etat for Wavelike and Diverse, written for Les Percussion des Strasbourg and released on the ensembles 50th anniversary Universal CD collection; Auditory Fiction (2011), commissioned by Société Générale for Radio France; Small Wonder (The Butterfly Effect) (2012), commissioned by the Serge Koussevitzky Foundation for the San Francisco Contemporary Music Players; Auditory Fiction II (2014), written for the ECO Ensemble for the Venice Music Biennale. In 2012, while Composer in Residence with the Santa Rosa Symphony, Campion was commissioned for The Last Internal Combustion Engine, written for full orchestra, Kronos Quartet and electronics. Joshua Kosman of the San Francisco Chronicle called the piece “a vivid and richly imagined concerto.” In 2015, the famed Ensemble Intercontemporain co-commissioned Campion and audiovisual artist Kurt Hentschläger for the 25-minute, Cluster X. The multi-media work was premiered at the Philharmonie de Paris in October of 2015 and toured the United States. Upcoming projects include a new commission from pianist Marilyn Nonken for a work to be inspired by Gèrard Grisey’s Vortex Temporum. As a 2016 Guggenheim Fellow, Mr. Campion will be composing for the Korean Traditional Contemporary Orchestra, an ensemble that features over 55 musicians performing on ancient instruments from Korea. Mr. Campion will travel to Korea to study and work directly with the musicians."
