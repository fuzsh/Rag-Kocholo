        "text": "î—“\n\nWell, as far as style goes, it is classic \"sea chantey\": A story\n\ntold around a simple melody. There is more than one way to write a\n\nsong, and that's the approach Gord decided to take with this one. It\n\nworks. I myself think (from a musical standpoint) that\n\n\"Ghosts of Cape Horn\" is a much better *written* song, though.\n\nGord researched the ship and it's sinking right after the fact, so\n\nas to write as accurate a song as possible. With the exception of only\n\ntwo lines in the song, it went down *exactly* as he wrote it - and he\n\nmade it rhyme, yet! The two lines that \"never happened\" are\n\nmore-than-understandable \"poetic license\" to assist in the story\n\ntelling. Even then, the song is a valuable historical document, besides\n\nbeing a wonderful tribute, and good entertainment (and I think it is all\n\nof those things).\n\nThe two lines that never happened are:\n\nWhen suppertime came the old cook come on deck sayin' \"Fellas, it's too\n\nrough to feed ya\".\n\n- This would not have happened. The ship was in the throes of a\n\nterrible storm from midafternoon on, and it is standard maritime\n\npractice that the cook does *not* cook during such times, the crew\n\neats from \"prepared stores\" (sandwiches and bottled drinks, on a\n\ncatch-as-catch-can basis). Further, if the cook had ventured out on\n\ndeck for *ANY* reason during a storm like that, the crew would have\n\nscreamed at him: \"Are you crazy?? Get below!!\"\n\nAt seven PM a main hatchway caved in, he said: \"Fellas, it's been good\n\nto know ya\".\n\n- a hatchway may have indeed caved in around seven PM, but one of the\n\npoints both the Coast Guard and NTSB agreed on in their final reports\n\nwas that the Fitz and her crew simply *did not know* how much trouble\n\nthe ship was in until the last moment - to them, it was another bad\n\nstorm with their ship having a rough time in rough seas - a fairly old\n\nstory for any experienced sailor. In other words, all aboard that ship\n\nwere counting the minutes until they made the safe harbor of Whitefish\n\nBay, but none of them - or at least none of the seasoned and experienced\n\ncrew - thought they would die that night.\n\nBut those two lines take nothing from the essential accuracy and\n\npower of the song.\n\nTony Meloche\n\n-----------== Posted via Newsfeed.Com - Uncensored Usenet News ==----------\n\nhttp://www.newsfeed.com The #1 Newsgroup Service in the World!\n\n-----= Over 100,000 Newsgroups - Unlimited Fast Downloads - 19 Servers =-----\n\n>The melody here is repeated throughout all 14 verses, with the\n\n>occasional octave variant on the last word of certain verses. I don't\n\n>know if anyone else feels this way, but I always skip it on my Gord\n\n>CD's.\n\nYou know, I used to feel that way. I found the song monotonous and a bit dull\n\nwhen it was getting a lot of airplay.\n\nIt wasn't until years later, right after seeing the Shipwreck documentary that\n\nI began truly appreciating the song. The historical accuracy of the song is\n\namazing, especially when you consider how quickly it was written after the\n\nsinking.\n\nAfter seeing that show, I began to really appreciate what happened that night,\n\nand found a whole new depth to the song. Once I did that, I thought that if\n\nthere were more musical variation within the song, that it would detract from\n\nthe tale itself. I think with the tone of the music, it dramatizes even more\n\nthe event.\n\nThe song is a sea chanty of sorts, with the \"feel\" of the waves within it. It\n\ndoesn't have the liveliness of a regular sea chanty, such as Triangle or\n\nGhosts, but it sets the tone for a memorial of a tragic loss of life.\n\nI still find myself skipping the song when I don't feel like being\n\nintrospective, or I am looking to be entertained or uplifted. I do find when I\n\nlisten to it now though, I tend to contemplate the tragedy and loss of life,\n\nrather than just hearing a song.\n\nJenney\n\nInteresting thoughts. I would venture to say that a song doesn't necessarily\n\nhave to have a bridge or a chorus--\"Wreck\" actually is following a much older\n\nform of song construction. GL is often described as a \"troubador.\" The\n\ndefinition that we all know is essentially \"wandering musician\"; however, one\n\nof the definitions of the word specifically refers to the lyric poets active in\n\nFrance from the 11-13th centuries.\n\nThese poets and musicians basically told stories--just as, for example,\n\nChaucer's and (going even further back) Homer's works were originally intended\n\nto be read aloud in front of an audience.\n\nBelieve me, I'm not trying to compare GL with Chaucer, Homer or anyone else:\n\nit's just that I think the some of the strongest roots of \"EF\" come from the\n\nfolk tradition, and the folk tradition can trace many roots back to these\n\nwandering minstrels and poets, who essentially went around telling stories:\n\neither via song, via poetry, or reading prose. What I find remarkable about\n\nthe song is that GL managed to take these old traditions and seamlessly marry\n\nthem to a contemporary event. Yes, it was a pop hit, but, as you say, it\n\ndoesn't share many characteristics in a musical sense with a more conventional\n\npop song.\n\nAs for the song itself, I tend to prefer the version I hear on stage today--not\n\nthat I don't like the original studio recording. Now, now... wait a second:\n\nbefore all you lovers of pedal-steel flame me, believe me, it has nothing to do\n\nwith that! :) It's just that I like what's happening with the bass and drums\n\nparticularly when I hear the song live today: the arrangement is much more\n\ndynamic to my ears than the original recording.\n\nDerek\n\nî—“\n\nî—“\n\nTony, Jenney, and Derek all said most of what popped into my head on\n\nreading this post. I'd go one further step than Jenney's thought that\n\n\"... if there were more musical variation within the song, that it would\n\ndetract from the tale itself.\" The simplicity of the musical structure\n\nvirtually forces you to listen to the lyrics (the story). I'd venture\n\nthat only musicians or those listeners \"into\" arrangements would be\n\nintrigued by the instrumentation. In that sense, the song always has\n\nfascinated me on two levels. First and foremost, the story. Secondly,\n\nthe way Gord orchestrated the song to bolster the simplistic\n\nconstruction. And, for those reasons, I have always found it utterly\n\namazing that the song was ever played ONCE on the radio let alone became\n\na \"pop\" hit. Given that most pop music has so little of interest in the\n\nway of lyrics (hey, I'm a story song kinda guy!) I wonder if there was a\n\nfull moon, some mystical convergence of the stars, or perhaps mass\n\nhypnosis happening when the song was first released.\n\n--\n\nEd Mullen\n\nhttp://edmullen.net\n\nTelekidd wrote:\n\n>\n\n> I must admit, I love playing the song, although I suppose I probably fall into\n\n> the \"Tom, Dick or Harry\" category of performers.
