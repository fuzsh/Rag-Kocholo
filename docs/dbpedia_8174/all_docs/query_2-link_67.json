        "text": "Eighteenth Century Microscopes\n\nAt the start of the eighteenth century, the two prominent British microscope designers were John Yarwell and John Marshall, both of whom strongly influenced microscope evolution. A modification of the standard English tripod microscope was made by Edmund Culpeper in 1725 and was reproduced with modifications and improvements for the next hundred years.\n\nIn 1738, Benjamin Martin introduced the drum microscope, which was also modified and improved by a number of instrument designers until the early 1800s. Around mid-century, John Cuff designed and built the first microscope (illustrated above) that was intended to be user-friendly and have an efficient focus mechanism. The Cuff-style microscope marked a departure from traditional microscope designs and heralded a new era of the modern microscope. Later in the century, George Adams and the Jones brothers (William and Samuel) continued improvements on the Cuff design, including a tripod-style foot and functional limbs with adjustable stages, condensers, and mirrors. There was not a great deal of improvement in lens design during this period, but the mechanics of the compound microscope were advancing in leaps and bounds.\n\nDownload our Museum of Microscopy screen saver for Windows.\n\nCulpeper-Style Microscopes - These sliding-tube microscopes with tripod legs were a popular English design in the first part of the eighteenth century.\n\nCulpeper's Microscope - This popular microscope was designed and constructed by British instrument maker Edmund Culpeper in the 1720s.\n\nJohn Dollond's Microscope - John Dollond's version of the Culpeper-style tripod microscope.\n\nEdward Scarlett's Culpeper-Style Microscope - Very similar to the basic Culpeper microscope, this design was copied throughout most of the eighteenth century.\n\nEnglish Culpeper-Style Microscope - Deviating somewhat from the basic Culpeper design motif, this 1760 microscope was probably made by George Adams senior.\n\nWilliam Robertson's Microscope - This exquisitely styled Culpeper-type microscope was made by the Scottish instrument maker William Robertson in Edinburg.\n\nCulpeper-Style Compound Tripod Microscope - Having all the bells and whistles of a Culpeper microscope, this knock-off is probably of Italian origin, dating sometime after 1716.\n\nJames Mann Compound Drum Microscope - James Mann, a British optician who apprenticed under Thomas King and Sir Isaac Newton, created the compound tripod drum microscope featured in this section around 1700.\n\nDutch microscope maker Johan Joosten van Musschenbroek - These late seventeenth and early eighteenth century Dutch microscopes were unique designs of the period.\n\nvan Musschenbroek's Low Power Microscope - This single-lens low power microscope had a jointed specimen holder.\n\nvan Musschenbroek's High Power Microscope - A refined microscope (for the period) that allowed precision fine focusing of the specimen and controlled illumination through the use of fixed aperture diaphragms.\n\nThe \"Flea\" Microscope - Crafted into a simple tubular shape from bone or ivory, this single-lens microscope was used to examine small insects in the eighteenth century.\n\nUnsigned Ivory Italian Microscope - Adorned with a turned ivory nosepiece and eyepiece, this early eighteenth century microscope was probably made by Italian instrument designer Pietro Patroni, of Milan.\n\nCampani-Style Italian Compound Microscope - With two vellum-covered inner tubes and an outer tube covered in shagreen, this beautiful microscope may have been made by Giuseppe Campani in the early eighteenth century.\n\nDutch Side-Pillar Microscope - Dated before the mid-eighteenth century, this Dutch wooden and brass optical instrument is an early example of a side-pillar microscope that features a rotating diaphragm disc.\n\nPatroni Tripod Compound Microscope - This brass, wood, and green vellum compound microscope, crafted by Pietro Patroni, recalls the style promoted by fellow Italian instrument maker Joseph Campani during the seventeenth century, but prefigures the similar British Edmund Culpeper microscopes that were first designed around 1725.\n\nJoblot Side-Pillar Compound Microscope - French mathematics professor and bacteriologist, Louis Joblot created his side-pillar compound microscope in the style promoted by British innovators Robert Hooke and John Marshall. A combination of brass, turned wood, glass, cardboard, and paper were employed to fabricate the elegant instrument.\n\nJohn Marshall English Compound Microscope - A beautiful microscope made from ebony, walnut, and pasteboard and covered with vellum and rayskin.\n\nPetrus Patronus Italian Compound Microscope - Fashioned with leather-covered wood, the body tube of this monocular compound microscope is translated upward and downward on a brass pillar to achieve focus.\n\nGeorge Sterrop Screw-Barrel Microscope - This microscope, which is very similar to the original Wilson screw-barrel microscope, was made by London instrument designer George Sterrop in 1730.\n\nEdward Scarlett Screw-Barrel Microscope - Microscopes having this design were very popular in early eighteenth century London, and models were developed by famous instrument makers such as Edmund Culpeper and George Sterrop. Edward Scarlett's microscope is fashioned from a combination of brass and wood.\n\nPre-1738 Simple Handheld Microscope - The elegance of simplicity is revealed in the hand-held design of the antique single lens microscope. Comprised of a single narrow piece of brass, the microscope is curved or bent in the center to resemble pincers or surgeons forceps.\n\nNuremberg Compound Monocular Microscope - Nicely crafted from pasteboard and wood, this mid-century microscope was made in Nuremberg, Germany.\n\nThe John Cuff Microscope - British microscope builder John Cuff introduced an innovative new design in the mid 1700s that would be copied for many years to come. Cuff's microscopes were well constructed with a mechanical operation that was superior to other microscopes of the period.\n\nGeorge Adams Compound Solar Microscope - Crafted by English instrument maker George Adams, this compound brass solar microscope was made in London around 1750.\n\nJeremiah Sisson Convertible Monocular Microscope - Based on the 1756 design of Dr. Stephen C.T.
