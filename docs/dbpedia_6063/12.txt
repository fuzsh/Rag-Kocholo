Steve McQueen’s Shame (A-) is a tough and gritty look at sex addition through a central character played by Michael Fassbender in a fierce and primal performance. His disturbing relationship with all women in the film, including with his sister played by Carey Mulligan, is absorbing and insightful. The “New York, New York” scene in a high-rise nightclub is haunting, as are most all of the sequences in the film, actually. The big city plays a critical role in the isolation the filmmaker captures, as the film is elegantly and hauntingly shot. It’s one of the best films of its year, despite being a tough subject.
