        "text": "Director: Steve McQueen\n\nNominated: Best Picture; Best Actor; Best Supporting Actor; Best Actress; Director; Editing; Production Design; Best Adapted Screenplay\n\nI’ve found my film of the Oscars! 12 Years A Slave captivated me from the very first frame. I suppose it helped that I have huge respect and admiration for Steve McQueen and his work, but I think even without that this would still be my film of this years Oscars season.\n\nMcQueen makes the audience confront the difficult, uncomfortable and often taboo things that we would normally overlook. It’s something I first noticed when watching Bobby Sands waste away on hunger strike in Hunger (2008) and then again when given an insight into the world of sexual addiction in Shame (2011). 12 Years A Slave asks the audience to witness and question the atrocious actions of White Americans during the 1800s, at the height of slavery. And while there may no longer be slavery in America or the UK, as McQueen said in his acceptance speech at the BAFTAs, “there are 21 million people in slavery as we sit here. I just hope that 150 years from now our ambivalence will not allow another filmmaker to make this film.” No body should ever be a slave! McQueen, and everyone involved in 12 Years A Slave, pushes people to react and abandon any ambivalence towards the more troubling aspects of the human condition and that makes for a powerful film.\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor is salient as Solomon Northup. He has an incredibly expressive face and is capable of displaying a multitude of emotions non-verbally. Watching the way he carries himself alter throughout the film is interesting. I felt that the moment he joined in singing “Roll, Jordan, Roll” was the one moment when he abandoned hope, a moment made all the more intense by McQueen’s lengthy close up.\n\nMcQueen is the sort of director who doesn’t shy away from things be they nudity in Shame or the casual violence so prevalent in 12 Years A Slave. Some of the whipping scenes and the aftermath of them are really quite graphic and made me wince. Lupita Nyong’o is a revelation as Patsey, the slave girl unfortunate enough to attract the attention of Epps. The scene where she is whipped is one of the most traumatic to watch – beaten in intensity only by the long-held shot of the aborted attempt to hang Northup.\n\nAs always Michael Fassbender is exceptional. He has formed one of those partnerships with McQueen, similar to Johnny Depp and Tim Burton, where their collaborations produce the best work out of both of them. There is an innate darkness and menace to Fassbender’s character Edwin Epps, which makes him irresistible to watch. He’s my pick for the win but I’m a self-confessed Michael Fassbender fan (turning round to find him standing next to me while volunteering at the BAFTAs is the highlight of my year so far!!)\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch gives another memorable, albeit brief, performance as Ford, a sympathetic yet ultimately impotent slaver. There was no noticeable passing of time until the film reached its climax with Northup’s return to his family as a free man once more, finding his children grown along with a young grandson. The gradual aging of Northup is very subtle – you only really notice it at the end of the film. This is definitely my favorite film nominated this year. It sits at the top of a pile of some exceptional films. I’d love for it to be recognized properly by the Academy.\n\nDirector: Steve McQueen\n\n2011\n\nMichael Fassbender is one of the most captivating actors currently working. Every performance commands your attention (and I should know having recently gone on a Fassbender film marathon) and amongst all those powerful performances his role as Brandon in Shame is one of the stand out roles – if not his best to date. “As Brandon he is physically and emotionally exposed, delivering an honest and brave performance of a man trying to find a lie from transitory and disparate parts.” (927, Simon Ward, 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die) There’s a quiet intensity to Brandon, well Fassbender too, that makes his character so intriguing … and yes attractive! He’s not a big talker which actually makes his performance all the more mesmerizing. He conveys a wealth of emotion, admittedly with lust being the predominant emotion, with his eyes and facial expressions.\n\nMore than anything Brandon is a conflicted character. He’s trying to maintain the appearance of his outward life – a young man with a successful job in New York City – while at the same time trying to deal with his sexual addiction. Sissy’s unexpected appearance forces Brandon to begin to deal with, or confront, many of his issues, predominantly his sexual addiction. His home is not longer his own and his sanctuary, where he can be himself, has been removed. As Simon Ward says “his cold but functional life is thrown into disorder with the arrival of his sister, Sissy, a superbly damaged Carey Mulligan” (927) And she is so very superbly damaged! I’ve said before I think that Carey Mulligan is one of the most talented rising stars to come out of cinema in recent years. She is the perfect foil for Fassbender’s Brandon. Where he has internalized everything, keeping it all under tight control, Sissy has become an extrovert. Their relationship is a strange one that has some underlying sexual tension to it.\n\nMcQueen has said that he kept the film very open-ended which is true, it is. As such it throws up a multitude of questions like where do Brandon and Sissy go from here? Does Brandon every get a handle on his addiction? But it also made me wonder what had happened to Brandon and Sissy when they were younger. There are moments when you see through the cracks in Sissy’s cheerful facade to the damaged person underneath.\n\nFrom the subject matter of the film there is a lot of nudity as you would expect. Both Fassbender and Mulligan seem perfectly at ease with it. There is a somewhat voyeuristic nature to McQueen’s choice of shots. A number of scenes are shot from behind the characters creating the feeling that we are overhearing a private conversation. It makes for an interesting visual tone. “Shot in long takes, many scenes play out in real time.” (927) And his New York has a different feel to it too – striking a careful balance between being a seedy underworld and the bright over the top tourist traps. In essence he creates a realistic feel to a big city.\n\nThe subject matter of this film, sexual addiction, is one that is still very much in the shadows and could it could easily have become a sordid film. However that hasn’t been the case thanks to McQueen and Fassbender who handle a delicate subject with a directness that is refreshing. They maintain a sense of realness without passing any judgement on either the addiction or the sort of lifestyle it can lead to. Shame is a really interesting film with masterful performances from its two leads."
