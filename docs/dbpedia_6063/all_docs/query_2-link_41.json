        "text": "I read recently that the director and the star of Shame, Steve McQueen and Michael Fassbender, didn’t hit it off the first couple of times they met. McQueen has revealed that he thought the Irish-German actor too cocksure and arrogant. But on their third meeting, they bonded when Fassbender gave McQueen a ride on his motorcycle, during which the two of them launched simultaneously into a duet of “Love Lifts Us Up Where We Belong.” McQueen describes this as their “’Officer and a Gentleman’ moment.” This is the greatest thing I’ve ever heard.[1]\n\nIt also may go some way to explaining the lengths to which Fassbender is willing to go for McQueen in Shame, a dark and challenging interrogation of the (post-9/11?) self which requires a performance of utter fearlessness.\n\nFew spoilers ahead so be careful:\n\nFassbender plays Brandon Sullivan, a professional, middle-class Irish-American living in New York, struggling with the very modern phenomenon of sex addiction. His life takes a turn when his troubled sister Sissy, played by Carey Mulligan, moves in with him after the breakdown of her relationship, and when their problems overlap as their lives entwine, both react in extreme and self-destructive ways.\n\nFassbender and Mulligan necessarily carry the film – there is no complex plot here, only complex characterisation – and neither one is ever less than convincing. While there is a sense that much of Mulligan’s story is left untold, she conveys the essentials to us with a heartbreaking mesh of quiet needfulness and piercingly raw anguish.\n\nAs for the lead, there is no point beating around the bush here[2]; Michael Fassbender is incredible, sensational, and any other positive superlative you care to use. The film’s opening image of Brandon lying in bed, staring into space blankly and hopelessly, sets the tone for what is to come. Neither rested nor completely sated, the look on his face is one of temporarily pacified addiction.\n\nThis brings me to my next point, which is that the film’s treatment of addiction is to be commended, especially since a compulsion so very 21st-century in essence could be easily misrepresented on film. There is no confusion here with a man who simply can’t settle down and wants to sleep around; Brandon’s more extreme behaviour, such as publicly touching a woman whose boyfriend stands beside her, and receiving oral sex[3] from another man in a permissive gay bar, conveys only urgent, rock-bottom desperation. Furthermore, this sexual binge – encompassing the two acts above, along with engaging in a threesome with two prostitutes – is embarked upon following a failed attempt to actually form a meaningful relationship with a woman, just as an alcoholic in a similar situation may have binged on drink.\n\nLighter scenes of Brandon gently flirting with women in a bar, chatting to other men, and going on a first date with a co-worker are enjoyable and almost poignant, as only the audience get to see both sides of his character and are granted an insight into how attractive Brandon is; bar his sexual compulsion and its effect on his relationships, he seems pretty great.\n\nHowever, overall, the film suffers by times by indulging McQueen’s artistic bent, in the form of very long shots and scenes with very little dialogue, which are instead carried by music. While this can be deployed to great effect – when Sissy takes more than five minutes of screen time to sing New York, New York in a bar with only her face, then Brandon’s face, in-shot – many others suffer from being unnecessarily over-long. Similarly, any attempt at making a societal judgement or political statement about sex or sex addiction plays second-fiddle to McQueen’s shot construction and soundtrack. The common criticism of (what I would judge to be) a similar film, Nicholas Winding-Refn’s Drive[4], as ‘style over substance’ may be equally applicable to Shame, but this in my opinion is more of a bugbear for the latter; I don’t necessarily care how ‘The Kid’[5] from Drive began moonlighting as a getaway driver, but in observing Brandon’s desperation and his awkward relationship with Sissy, I can’t help but wonder what happened to him – to them –\n\nthat makes them act the way they do. Shame is in essence a character study, and by omitting this kind of detail, it feels somehow incomplete. Maybe wondering about the root and cause of addiction is to miss the point, as the film explores only the effect, but peer-reviewing would reveal that others share my curiosity.\n\nIrish-American Psycho: A clumsy comparative analysis\n\nFrom the opening scenes of Brandon getting out of bed, walking through his stylishly sparse apartment and tending to his daily routine, I was struck by how much Shame reminded me of the film adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis’ American Psycho from 2000. Hence my alternate title for the film, Irish-American Psycho[6].\n\nBrandon in Shame doesn’t brutally murder the prostitutes he picks up, obsess over business cards or profess any interest in pop music from the 1980s. (Spoiler alert!)\n\nBut like Patrick Bateman, the protagonist of Ellis’ novel[7] who was later portrayed on film by Christian Bale[8], he has an executive-level, white-collar job in a good part of the city, and lives in a trendy white-walled apartment. And like Patrick Bateman, Brandon leads a charmed life, juxtaposed with moments of darkness which go almost unnoticed. When noticed, they are half-heartedly explained away, and the character is given an ‘out’ of some kind. In a subplot which is just about fifteen years too late for American Psycho, Brandon arrives at work to learn that his computer, which had been taken away after downloading a virus, was ‘filthy’ – his boss describes the glut and styles of pornography found by tech support on his hard drive, before concluding with the punch-line, ‘you think it was your intern?’ This scene, along with Brandon’s breakdown in the ramparts of New York at the end of the film, could be seen to echo Bateman[9]’s agonized phone call to his lawyer, Harold, in which he confesses that he’s probably killed about twenty people, the result of which is the lawyer laughing it off when they next meet, and Bateman crying helplessly down the phone to his secretary.\n\nSimilarly, in the novel American Psycho (though not in the film), there is a suggestion that some aspect of Bateman’s past disturbs him deeply and that his murderous behaviour and various (shallow?) insecurities may be linked to this familial identity. There is some non-explicit reference to his father and who he is, and having dinner with his brother makes him supremely uncomfortable. This is evoked in Shame through the presence of Sissy, whose past self-harm and suicidal tendencies are her manifestation of the pain that she and Brandon appear to share.\n\nThere has been recent news about Lionsgate optioning a remake of American Psycho, and setting it in current times[10]. Personally, I think Shame is perfectly adequate, if not as a straight remake, as a film which updates the New York of American Psycho, and shows us the modern-day equivalent of the materially-obsessed, sociopathic Bateman. They are similar in many ways, but the 25-year-gap between the events depicted also contributes some subtle changes. Brandon is a more ambiguous character than Bateman, his redeeming features sitting uncomfortably alongside his dark side. He is handsome and fit, but without the exhausting eighties-style effort and narcissism – as Sissy questions in disgust ‘the shit you use in your hair’, one can only imagine her reaction to Bateman’s honey and almond body scrub, cooling facial masks and water-activated gel cleansers. Similarly, Brandon’s jogging[11] is as adequate an exercise for the character as Bateman’s act of completing a thousand stomach crunches per day is for him.\n\nCulture changes, sure, and our heroes change, but human emotion and response to trauma is, if not universal, treated in a fairly standard way in screenplays. Both men become destabilised and engage in all-out self-destruction after distressing their girlfriends and breaking up with them: Brandon’s aforementioned sexual spree comes just after he fails to consummate his burgeoning relationship[12] with Marianne, resulting in him moodily asking her to leave, while Bateman, dismissing his fiancée with the greatest break-up line of all time (‘you’re just not terribly important to me’), leaves her sobbing in a restaurant while he embarks on an indiscriminate city-wide massacre of old women, police officers and night porters[13].\n\nBateman, while meditating on a sign that says ‘No Exit’, experiences ‘no catharsis’ at the close of American Psycho, revealing that his confession ‘has meant nothing’. Whether or not this is the case for Brandon is debatable, as Shame ends with a scene that echoes one from its very beginning, which depicts Brandon looking at the same woman on the subway who so entranced him several journeys ago. Though Brandon has had something of a wake-up call after his hedonistic night out a few scenes prior, I’d consider it fairly open to interpretation whether or not he will repeat his actions from the start of the film, and be compelled to follow the woman when she gets off the train. We don’t get to follow her, or Brandon, on or off the train beyond that point… but I found myself hoping that the ‘No Exit’[14] sign wasn’t lit up for him, that Brandon finds his way off the tracks he’s been circling like a shark for the past 98 minutes, and goes somewhere else with his life.\n\n-SG"
