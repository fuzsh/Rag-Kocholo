        "text": "Supermarket manager John Fisher wakes to find himself restrained to a chair with a shotgun rigged to point at his head. A disguised voice over the loudspeaker tells John that he is attached to a polygraph and must tell the truth. Otherwise, a lie will trigger the weapon. The voice coerces John into confessing an extramarital affair. John’s wife regains consciousness nearby and discovers that she too is restrained. John tells his wife that he loves her and the gun fires. Scotland Yard detective James Trent is assigned to investigate the murder.\n\nJames takes his pregnant wife Kellie to see Dr. Tom West. During their consult, Tom volunteers information to Kellie that he performed an illegal late-term abortion for James in the past. James realizes that the killer from the grocery store is listening over the phone and forcing Tom to reveal the truth. When Tom asks James to help him, the killer remotely accelerates Tom’s pacemaker and kills him.\n\nJames calls his ex-girlfriend Sarah in New York to ask for her help profiling the case. A psychology professor, Sarah is reluctant to involve herself because of her troubled past with James, which includes the abortion mentioned by Dr. West.\n\nAt John the Baptist Church, Father Bartholomew Damien regains consciousness to discover an electric shock collar fastened around his neck. The disguised voice then comes over the speaker system and forces Father Damien to admit that he performed dodgy marriages in exchange for cash so that couples could get their green cards. James arrives at the church just as Father Damien is shocked to death.\n\nBecause he was present for two of the deaths, James becomes a person of interest and is taken off the case. He continues investigating on his own anyway and makes another plea to Sarah for help. She refuses. James decides to fly from London to New York to convince Sarah in person to work up a profile for him. James’ wife becomes incensed that he is going to see his ex, but James convinces her to stay with a friend while he is gone so that she will be safe.\n\nJames arrives at the university where Sarah teaches in New York. After he departs his cab, the taxi driver receives a phone call from the disguised voice. James and Sarah confer over the religious element of the case as they try deducing the killer’s motives. When their encounter leads back to Sarah’s apartment, James leaves suddenly after Sarah goes in for a kiss.\n\nJames and Sarah reconvene the next day to continue mulling over the case. When they learn of a copycat murder that occurred in New York, James and Sarah go the crime scene and discover the body of James’ cab driver.\n\nSarah takes James to see her brother Harry, who is still cold towards James over how he treated his sister during their relationship. Harry shows them a threatening note he received from the killer and everyone realizes that they are all targets.\n\nFellow Scotland Yard detective Lee Stooks shows up unannounced in New York. James asks Lee to look into Harry while he and Sarah continue their own work. Lee breaks into Harry’s apartment and finds guns, polygraph machines, and books on lie detection. Harry returns home unexpectedly and enters a standoff with the detective. He and Lee shoot each other. Harry dies, but Lee’s discovery points to Harry as the murderer.\n\nSarah and James share a glass of wine on her balcony. An argument breaks out between the two of them and James realizes that Sarah knows his wife is pregnant even though he never told her. Poison from the drugged wine kicks in for both of them. Sarah confesses that she orchestrated the murders and the mystery with the help of a London contact named Victor to bring James back into her life. She tells James that the antidote to their poison is in two locked boxes that can only be opened when the truth is told. James forces Sarah to open one, which prompts her to tell James that he will die alone. The box opens and James drinks the antidote.\n\nBefore Sarah dies, James realizes that she enacted a plan to have James’ wife killed in London. James calls his captain at Scotland Yard and learns that Kellie was found murdered. Distraught, James jumps off Sarah’s building to his death. The captain hangs up the phone and it is revealed that he was coerced by Victor to lie to James and that Ellie is actually still alive.\n\nReview:\n\nThe UK box cover for “Shame the Devil” touts it as a British version of “Saw.” Perhaps in keeping with the film’s theme of telling the truth or suffering the consequences, at least the production is upfront at the outset about whose template lies face down on the glass of its Xerox machine.\n\nShawnee Smith wakes from unconsciousness to find a reverse bear trap fitted to her face. A disguised voice then --- sorry, strike that --- A London supermarket manager wakes from unconsciousness to find a shotgun contraption pointed at his face. A disguised voice then explains that the trigger is attached to a lie detector and there is about to be an inquisition. Tell the truth and live. Tell a lie and die.\n\nThings don’t turn out so well for that man. Nor do they go any better for the next pair of victims instructed to tell the truth and “shame the devil.” Scotland Yard detective James Trent is assigned to the case. The more he digs into the biblical connections surrounding the killer’s motivation, the more he realizes that the only person who can help him is his psychologist ex-girlfriend Sarah. Much to the chagrin of James’ pregnant wife Kellie, James jumps the pond to New York where he and Sarah can work on uncovering the madman’s identity. Trouble is, the killer appears to have crossed the ocean, as well.\n\nForgiving the movie’s copycat premise and far-fetched twists for a moment, “Shame the Devil” turns out enough interesting moments to give its mystery an initial allure. It may be a rip of each X and every O from Jigsaw’s playbook, but I guiltily admit that the story had me curious about the killer’s possible identity and the apparent Ten Commandments connection between the crimes.\n\n“Shame the Devil” rides the middle of the road on nearly all creative fronts. The New York and London locations look nice. Plentiful exteriors and competent photography open up the production value and it appears evident that real money was put into the effort. On the other hand, the editing cutting it together gets cheeky. Segues between scenes employ music video montages of clinking wine glasses, echoed dialogue, and bible passages as de facto chapter headings that read as overinflated and unnecessary symbolism. Lump that in with some repeated dialogue lines and minor detail inconsistencies and it looks like the screenplay left the editing phase one draft too early.\n\nWhile the setup can keep an attention span engaged for the first half of the film, it is the latter half where the script rides off the rails with improbable plot devices like poisons, antidotes, and polygraph-triggered lock boxes. Like many fictional serial killers, the maniac of “Shame the Devil” has a diabolical plan so ludicrous that even the detective and the profiler cannot pinpoint if he is killing violators of the Ten Commandments, men with the first names of Jesus’ apostles, or following some other whacked out methodology entirely. Looking back on it when all is revealed, you realize that it is the most ridiculously overcomplicated scheme ever devised to accomplish what the objective ultimately is.\n\nSPOILERS\n\nWorse, the ending cheats completely by revealing the co-conspirator to be an unseen character first mentioned in the final few minutes of the film. “Victor showed me the way,” says the primary killer. Who the hell is Victor? I honestly wonder if Victor was a last minute addition to explain how the cab driver was killed at the same time James attended Sarah’s lecture, and/or to shoehorn Doug Bradley into what basically amounts to a superfluous role.\n\nCasting a familiar genre face in a throwaway part is nothing new for producers of low-budget thrillers desperate for marketing bullet points. Many a four and five-figure paycheck has been cut to B-movie names for a few hours work just to say “so and so” appears in this movie. “Shame the Devil” takes the trophy for most egregious transgressor of this trick by billing Doug Bradley as one of its stars. If you’re seeing “Shame the Devil” for the “Hellraiser” icon, don’t. Bradley says literally just two words in an undistorted voice and appears in only one brief shot right before the end credits. That shot is of him donning a hat in the shadows. Since his face is obscured, the only way to even know it is Bradley is because the credits say so.\n\nEND SPOILERS\n\nAs I type these myriad ways the movie cuts corners with plotting and disappoints with delivery, I’m now second-guessing why I graded it as high as three out of five stars. Truth be told, there isn’t enough incentive to spend any more time thinking about it.\n\nWhile the preposterous resolution is a letdown, the buildup maintains enough mild intrigue to put itself on par with an average episode of “Law and Order” or “Criminal Minds.” Really, “Shame the Devil” is neither no more nor no less offensive than those options as a way to occupy 90 minutes of disposable crime-drama entertainment.\n\nReview Score: 60"
