        "text": "Home Alone 2: Lost In New York is one of those rare sequels that many people found to be even more charming than the original. It has the added excitement of being set in New York City, and it features all the primary cast members of the first film. Even child star Macaulay Culkin came back to star in Home Alone 2.\n\nAlthough the second Home Alone movie required suspension of disbelief, it was a big hit and became the third-biggest grossing movie of 1992. The Big Apple is a major part of the movie to the point where it really became a character itself, and Kevin McCallister’s pure enjoyment of the city is infectious.\n\nIn a clip that is now extremely sad given what happened only nine years later, Kevin is seen visiting the World Trade Center. He also goes to shops like Quong Yuen Shing & Co. that have since closed. However, for the most part, you can still visit many of the places that are featured in the film.\n\nHere’s what you need to know to plan your own New York City adventure and visit the key locales from the beloved modern classic Christmas movie.\n\nFly Into LaGuardia Airport\n\nNew Yorkers have their choice of multiple airports to get in and out of the city. However, if you want to fly into the city like Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) did, choose LaGuardia Airport. In Home Alone 2: Lost In New York, Kevin gets his first glimpse of the city through the window of the airport.\n\nHe learns that his family is in Florida while he is in New York. Instantly distressed, his worries fade as it dawns on him that the stresses from his family won’t hinder him from enjoying a great holiday, and he is free to do as he pleases in the big city. So, in that spirit, savor the freedom you’ll have to explore New York City as you make your way through LaGuardia Airport.\n\nTake A Taxi Over The Queensboro Bridge\n\nYoung Kevin took a yellow cab over the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge into the city. Seeing Manhattan getting closer is always thrilling, and you might want to take the same route to recreate the wide-eyed wonder from the film.\n\nVisit Radio City Music Hall And Empire Diner\n\nNext, the movie shows a montage of Kevin having a grand old time in the city. We see Radio City Music Hall and Empire Diner. You may want to enjoy a delectable Impossible burger and fries at Empire Diner. (Perhaps avoid taking fliers, though, which Kevin takes during his visit.) Then see a show at the Radio City Music Hall. Their holiday show has been a Christmas tradition for some New Yorkers for decades.\n\nExplore The Battery\n\nKevin also visits the coin-operated binoculars at The Battery, which was called Battery Park when Home Alone 2: Lost In New York was filmed. According to Insider, the binoculars have since been removed, but there is still much to enjoy at this 25-acre scenic park that’s located at the southern tip of Manhattan.\n\nVisit The Statue Of Liberty\n\nKevin spots the Statue of Liberty through the binoculars in The Battery. It’s one of the awe-inspiring, historical spots in the city that every traveler should visit on their first trip to New York.\n\nWhile Kevin merely looks at it, you’ll want to take the time to see it up close. If you are able to take on the physical exertion of climbing the equivalent of 20 stories of stairs, you can even trek up to the crown. Alternately, explore the museum at the lower level.\n\nStay At The Plaza\n\nThe Plaza is one of the most iconic, beloved luxury hotels in Manhattan. Kevin chooses to stay here because he heard a commercial for the hotel that called it “New York's most exciting hotel experience\"! That could very well be true.\n\nIf you stay here, you may want to also enjoy room service and the pool like Kevin did. Also don’t miss out on booking their delectable vegan afternoon tea experience. It’s great for plant-based diners and omnivores alike, and it will rival anything Kevin enjoyed during his extravagant room service meals.\n\nAlso, be sure to take a stroll to the Grand Army Plaza. It’s across the street from The Plaza. That’s where the trouble seemingly starts for Kevin when he’s spotted by Harry and Marv, the comedically incompetent criminals from the original Home Alone.\n\nWalk Around Central Park\n\nCentral Park is a large park that spans over 843 acres, and it is situated between the Upper East and Upper West sides of Manhattan. There are several spots to visit within the park that were key locations in the movie. There’s the Bethesda Fountain at Bethesda Terrace at 72nd Street. There’s also the Historic Wollman Rink where the criminals go ice skating.\n\nThen there’s the Gapstow Bridge in Central Park where we see the Pigeon Lady (Brenda Fricker). Sadly, the movie doesn’t give the Pigeon Lady a name, which is a shame considering how dehumanized homeless people are in our society anyway. That tragically hasn’t changed since Home Alone 2: Lost In New York premiered in 1992. Nevertheless, the sweet friendship between Kevin and the Pigeon Lady is at the heart of the movie, and they have some poignant scenes together.\n\nSee A Concert At Carnegie Hall\n\nCarnegie Hall is among the most famous concert halls in the world, and it’s a gorgeous concert hall to visit when you are in the city. In Home Alone 2, the Pigeon Lady takes Kevin to a secret spot in the hall where she listens to the beautiful music for free, and they have a heartfelt talk.\n\nVisit Rockefeller Center"
