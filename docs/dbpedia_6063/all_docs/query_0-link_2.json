        "text": "STEVE McQUEEN, the London-born artist-turned-filmmaker, has dark memories of his first visit to New York City. Literally: he was here for the 1977 blackout.\n\n“I was 7 years old,” he recalled. “It has a big impression. There was a T-shirt: ‘Where were you when the lights went out?’ A lot of people were stealing. It was quite exciting.”\n\nA laugh comes from the man seated next to him. “A big party,” said Michael Fassbender, the Irish-German actor and star of the duo’s new film, “Shame.” His first time in New York? “I did a Guinness commercial here,” Mr. Fassbender replies, in a smooth brogue. “About a guy who swims to New York from Ireland.” The city, he said, “was everything I imagined it to be.”\n\nThey are an unlikely couple — the bespectacled, neurotic artist and his rakish, heartthrob muse — but it may be even more improbable that a pair of Europeans have created one of the more memorable cinematic Manhattans in years. “Shame,” which opens Friday in select cities, is a wrenching saga of sex addiction set in executive-suite New York, where self-destruction plays out against minimalist décor, sophisticated hotels and other trappings of upscale urban life.\n\nDespite frequent sex scenes so explicit it has received an NC-17 rating, “Shame” is a deeply unerotic portrait of Manhattan, replacing the city’s usual romance with an antiseptic chill. Brandon, Mr. Fassbender’s character, spends his days toiling at an anonymous Midtown firm and his nights pursuing anonymous sex in any form. He locks eyes with women on the N train and brings prostitutes back to his sterile pornography-laden Chelsea high-rise. This is no easy subject matter, and the film has proved divisive among critics at early screenings, although Mr. Fassbender received best-actor honors at the Venice Film Festival for his role.\n\nThat this tale of breakdown and addiction, aided by the immediacy of the Internet, is set in modern-day New York is no accident, although the initial impetus for the filmmakers to cross the Atlantic was more practical than aesthetic. In England, “no one wanted to speak to us about sex addiction,” explained Mr. McQueen, as he sipped tea the other day with Mr. Fassbender at the Standard Hotel, itself the scene of several of Brandon’s trysts.\n\nMr. McQueen, whose mainstream debut, “Hunger,” also starred Mr. Fassbender in examining a famous hunger strike at a prison in Northern Ireland, is a stickler for research. But when he and his co-writer, the British playwright Abi Morgan (whose credits include the forthcoming Margaret Thatcher biopic, “The Iron Lady”), set out to interview recovering addicts in London, they found that many refused to speak, apparently spooked by an unsympathetic British media.\n\nMr. McQueen found that New York’s streets offered a visual reinforcement of his message that this addiction can strike in any community, no matter how refined.\n\n“New York is a landscape that even if you haven’t been there, people recognize it,” he said. “Before I ever went to New York, I saw American cop shows and stuff like that. It’s a location that sort of neutralizes everything.”\n\nFor Mr. McQueen, the idea was to create a film that could capture the toll of self-abuse without allowing viewers an easy way to keep their distance.\n\n“Everyone can relate to sexual addiction, because everyone has sex,” he said. “Now alcohol addiction or drug addiction, you can give these things up to some extent. But sex addiction, you have to live with sex, and therefore there’s a relationship with most other people in the audience.”\n\n“It was a topic that has hardly been covered at all, or looked at properly,” he added.\n\nCertainly, in the cinema, sex addiction is often played for laughs (as in “Choke”), but even more serious takes, like “Auto Focus,” tend to use illness as metaphor: Bob Crane’s sex addiction as a lens onto Hollywood decay. Few directors delve as deeply as Mr. McQueen into its full human consequences.\n\nMr. Fassbender, who went on an extreme diet for weeks to prepare for his role as the hunger striker Bobby Sands in “Hunger,” is accustomed to his director’s demanding standards. But he said the 25-day shoot for “Shame,” which required him to simulate several sex acts and even urinate on camera, was at times even more trying.\n\nMr. McQueen, genuinely surprised, asked, “Why was it more difficult than ‘Hunger’?”\n\nMr. Fassbender thought for a few moments. “Bobby Sands was such a confident character in his beliefs,” he said, and Brandon “is somebody that doesn’t think very highly of himself at all. The opposite. What he’s doing is going about abusing himself; he’s damaging himself badly. Living with that, I think it kind of got to me at certain times.”\n\nThe “Shame” shoot was Mr. McQueen’s first extended stay in the city since a stint at New York University film school in the early 1990s. His less-than-pleasant experiences in Manhattan restaurants informed one of the movie’s lighter moments, when an overeager waiter bothers Brandon on a date. “That’s kind of indicative of a lot of meals in New York,” the director said with a laugh.\n\nMr. Fassbender chimed in: “The service thing is brilliant here, but sometimes it’s too much. Every time you’re getting into conversation it’s like, ‘Is everything all right here? Can I get you anything?’ ”\n\nIt was around this time in the interview that the two found themselves embroiled in a somewhat darker New York moment. Mr. McQueen is a precise conversationalist — “I want to get this right!” he exclaimed at one point, struggling with a sentence — and so he was rather annoyed when a loud crunching bass line began pumping through the bar’s speakers. It was 4 p.m., and the place, the exclusive celebrity-friendly Le Bain, was nearly deserted.\n\n“Excuse me?” Mr. McQueen bellowed. “Can you turn the music down?”\n\nHe was met by a manager, clearly unmoved. “I have people coming in,” he said, talking over Mr. McQueen’s protests.\n\nThe director stayed polite — “Look, I don’t want to fight with you,” he said — only to be met with a smirk. “I don’t want to fight either,” the manager said.\n\n“Whatever,” Mr. McQueen said, waving him off, but the manager persisted. “What does that mean?” he asked, in a mocking tone. “What is ‘whatever’ about?”\n\nIt was a bizarre, aggressive moment, and Mr. McQueen seemed to sour after that. He had lost track of his earlier point, and, as the manager walked away, he uttered a quiet, vigorous expletive. The Hudson River, framed by the tall glass windows behind him, shimmered on its way past the island, but Mr. McQueen did not turn to look.\n\n“New York is not owned by anyone,” he said later. “That’s what makes an interesting city. It is a city of how many stories — thousands, hundreds of stories, millions of stories. That’s the beauty of working here.”"
