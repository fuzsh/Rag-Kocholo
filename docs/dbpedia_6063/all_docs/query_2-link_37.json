        "text": "Sometimes life gets so busy, one doesn’t have time to do even the minor things one wants. For me, the holiday break was a good time to catch up on some movies I’d been wanting to see.\n\nOne was the 2011 British drama “Shame,” Steve McQueen’s sobering and brilliant tale of sexual addiction in modern-day New York. I’ll be totally honest — while the buzz the film got during award season in 2012 got my attention, my interest was also piqued by reports of star Michael Fassbender’s full-frontal nude scenes. He’s hot, I’m gay — what can I say?\n\nThe film was truly great — if you haven’t seen it, it’s by all means recommended. But a couple things about it bothered me. Now that so much time has passed since it was in theaters, I feel they’re safe (spoiler alert!) to discuss.\n\nFirst, the film is a textbook example of one of the frustrations of working in LGBT media. A huge part of my job, obviously, is parsing the endless deluge of movies, TV shows, recordings, theatrical productions, books and more that are released with LGBT content. Of course it’s humanly impossible to get to everything (I have a great stable of freelancers who help), but it’s not uncommon for a film like this to come along without any indication it has gay content — zero pitches from publicists, nothing indicating gay content in the trailer and very limited availability (most major theater chains don’t show NC-17-rated films).\n\nGranted, it’s a relatively minor (and fleeting) scene, but it’s enough to warrant the “of LGBT interest” tag, Fassbender’s nude scenes notwithstanding.\n\nThe scene itself — in which Fassbender’s ostensibly straight character Brandon gets blown by a guy in a gay sex club — raises a bounty of questions: does Brandon have a few percentage points of bisexuality in his DNA? Is he so horny and desperate (perhaps more likely considering the central theme of the film) that having just been denied admittance in a straight club, he resorts to the gay bathhouse across the street? Or are the filmmakers implying the character is so fucked up, he’ll even resort to gay fellatio, as if that’s the apex of sexual depravity? Placed near the end of the film as Brandon’s sexual addiction reaches fever-pitch intensity, that’s likely at least part of what writers Steve McQueen (who also directed) and Abi Morgan are floating.\n\nIt’s impossible to pin them down on it — the film (and this is a big part of its brilliance) leaves just the right amount of information opaque and thus open to interpretation. In stark contrast with the raw sex scenes, thematically “Shame” never hits you over the head.\n\nI’ll leave it to the psychologists to discuss the likelihood of a straight person being so engulfed in the throes of sexual addiction he or she would engage in a sexual act that conflicts with their sexual orientation. I have no idea how often such things happen in the real world.\n\nThat McQueen’s highly effective film — the lead performances by Fassbender and a perfectly cast Carey Mulligan alone make it worth seeing — gives us so much to ponder is but one indication of its greatness.\n\n‘Soft Power’\n\nThrough Sept. 15\n\nSignature Theatre\n\n4200 Campbell Ave. Arlington, Va. Starting at $40\n\nSigtheatre.org\n\nThere’s a wonderful scene in “Soft Power” where Hillary Clinton goes underground. She’s just lost the election and she’s eating a lot of bad takeout and seeing no one. But she’s willing to make an exception for one man. He’s Xue Xing, a Chinese theatrical producer from Shanghai whom she briefly but memorably met on the campaign trail.\n\nOnce he convinces her to venture outdoors, Hillary doffs the food-stained robe and dowdy sleeping cap to magically reveal a chic black shirt dress with full skirt and a bouncy bob of blonde tresses. Next, the duo elegantly dances across the stage (and presumably the country) for a better view of the romantic Golden Gate Bridge. It’s quite the moment.\n\nBilled as a musical fantasia, “Soft Power,” a terrific collaboration between playwright David Henry Hwang (“Yellow Face,” “M. Butterfly”) and composer Jeanine Tesori (“Fun Home,” “Kimberly Akimbo”), is currently playing at Signature Theatre in a revised, taut version of its earlier off-Broadway incarnation. At about 90 minutes, it’s substantially shorter, and this time an Asian actor, the marvelous Grace Yoo, is playing Hillary.\n\nThe story unfolds at a rapid, highly entertaining pace. On the cusp of the 2016 election, Xue Xing (an all-around pitch perfect Daniel May) is eager to peddle some soft power (i.e. “to co-opt rather than coerce”). His mission in America is to put a pro-Chinese musical on the Great White Way. Sadly, DHH the playwright he’s commissioned to do the job can’t find a viable way into the assignment.\n\nLike David Henry Hwang, DHH (Steven Eng) is the son of immigrants. He possesses limited knowledge of China and doesn’t speak Chinese. Also, like Hwang, who was stabbed by a random stranger near his home in Brooklyn in 2015, DHH is violently attacked on the streets of New York. It’s while recovering in hospital that DHH falls into a prolonged fever dream in which he reconciles feelings about China and America set against a backdrop of ardor, and classic Broadway and Hollywood musicals. Like so many dreams, the characters are blends of real people and places.\n\nStaged by Ethan Heard, Signature’s associate artistic director who also happens to be Chinese-American, queer, and proficient in Mandarin, “Soft Power” boasts a top-notch, largely Asian cast that ably plays varied races from wide-ranging walks of life. Broadway costume designer Helen Q. Huang creates a rather soigné look drawn from the real-life candidate’s practical workaday uniform. Set designer Chika Shimizu cleverly creates distinct settings using straightforward signage, subtle graffiti, and some smoky glass.\n\nBilly Bustamante’s choreography conveys energy and emotion ranging from a tiki torch bearing mob to a Fred and Ginger expression of budding romance. And music director Angie Benson skillfully conducts the 10-person orchestra beautifully rendering Tesori’s both eclectic and memorable score.\n\nThe show’s razzle-dazzle number “I’m With Her,” features Hillary in full campaign mode at a busy McDonald’s restaurant. Initially, high above the crowd, dressed in an ivory-colored coat, she evokes Evita. As she descends into the adoring fray, it’s more a blend of oily Harold Hill, brassy Reno Sweeney and a bit of Baby June really selling it on the Orpheum circuit. In short, all the glad-handing madness of an American election.\n\nThe feel-good fun is abruptly interrupted when a preppy kid in a red baseball cap, Holden Caufield (an aptly angsty Joey Urgino standing in for Nicholas Yenson), crashes the lovefest proclaiming how he can’t stand “phonies” so he’s voting for the other guy.\n\nWith varying degrees of success, the playwright employs humor to explore contrasting cultures, democracy, exceptionalism, and gun control. At one point, a delightfully fey Chief Justice (Andrew Crispi) musically lays out just how voting works including the Electoral College, which doesn’t ensure a victory for the candidate garnering the most votes. Xue Xing isn’t impressed.\n\nHwang’s isn’t the only work about Asians suffering at the hands of emboldened racists. Chisa Hutchinson’s “Redeemed,” a piece inspired by an uptick in anti-Asian hate crime in the early days of the pandemic (think “kung flu”), made its world premiere at the Contemporary American Theatre Festival in West Virginia in the summer of 2023.\n\nThe Black bisexual playwright’s compelling two hander is set in the visiting room of a high security prison where an Asian American woman meets with the white man who murdered her gay brother when he heard him speaking Chinese in line at an ATM. There’s no singular way to talk about domestic terrorism. Both pieces work but in different ways."
