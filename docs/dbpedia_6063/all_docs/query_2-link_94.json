        "text": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- If you’ve ever dreamed of becoming an actor and find yourself wondering how you can achieve your dream and one day become a star parading on the red carpet, perhaps you should talk to Elizabeth Masucci, who’s delighted to be featured in “Shame” — her first film — which has drawn critical acclaim and is slated to open in theaters today both here and across Europe.\n\nThe plot centers on Brandon, played by Michael Fassbender, a New Yorker who’s incapable of intimacy with women because of his addiction to sex. At the peak of his struggle with this addiction, his unstable younger sister, played by Carey Mulligan, moves into his apartment, rousing memories of their shared traumatic past, and Brandon’s life begins to disintegrate. It should be noted that “Shame” is a truthful and courageous exploration of sexual need and how it affects our lives.\n\nElizabeth, a member of the New York City theater community for the past five years, plays a businesswoman who is one of Brandon’s most witty and intriguing inamoratas. They meet at a bar, and Elizabeth, after parrying advances by Brandon’s boss, falls for Brandon’s charms instead.\n\n“Shame” is directed by Steve McQueen (“Hunger”) and produced by Iain Canning and Emile Sherman of See Saw Films, also known for the Academy Award-winning film, “A King’s Speech.” The film is distributed by Fox Searchlight.\n\nBorn in Tottenville, a community where many Masucci family members still reside, Elizabeth was reared in Holmdel, N.J.\n\nNamed for her paternal grandmother, Elizabeth is a city-based actor and writer who began her career in the theater. However, her first passion in the performing arts was ballet, which she studied until moving to New York City to attend Fordham University at Lincoln Center. With her special affection for dance, she studied classical ballet for 14 years, trained extensively and took Royal Academy Ballet exams in Manhattan as a youngster.\n\nThe daughter of Janet and Andrew Masucci — and sister of Andrea and Jake — reveals that her first professional acting job was when she was 16 and appeared in a Japanese Latte commercial with actress Natalie Portman. Later, while in college, Elizabeth developed a deep interest in the theater.\n\nAsked about her favorite actresses, Elizabeth is quick to say that in addition to Ms. Portman, she especially admires Kate Winslet, Helen Mirren, Ms. Mulligan, Michelle Williams and Viola Davis.\n\nThe young thespian confides that when she took her first acting workshop, she chose to consult with an accent coach who was aware she hailed from the Staten Island/ New Jersey area, and assisted her with a standard American accent for more range in her acting career.\n\nElizabeth recounts that she initially turned to an acting career not only to find great roles in film, TV and theater, but also as a means simply to tell a good story.\n\nAs a point of interest, within the first two years following graduation, Elizabeth produced and acted in four plays: “Women of Manhattan,” “Rabbit Hole,” “Crimes of the Heart” and “Italian American Reconciliation.” More recently, she has spent time building out her experience on camera.\n\nIn addition to “Shame,” Elizabeth also has a principal role in the independent feature “Virgin Alexander,” which won best feature film at the Las Vegas Film Festival.\n\nHer other films include: “Putzel,” “Price Check,” “Theo,” and “Witches of Oz.” TV credits include: “Gossip Girl,” “Person of Interest,” “Royal Pains,” “The 22,” and “Are We There Yet?”\n\nCELEBRATIONS"
