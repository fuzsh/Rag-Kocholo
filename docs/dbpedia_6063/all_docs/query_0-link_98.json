        "text": "is on the phone to discuss his latest film, and, inevitably, we need to address the obvious by stating, No, it’s not\n\nthat\n\nSteve McQueen\n\n.\n\nThis\n\nSteve McQueen isn’t the famed American actor (who died in 1980, duh) but rather the 42-year-old British artist whose abstract and experimental work in short film and film installations won the prestigious\n\nTurner Prize\n\nin 1999 and saw him honored by Queen Elizabeth with the titles of OBE and CBE.\n\nIn 2008, McQueen turned his attention to narrative film and created\n\na staggeringly beautiful and emotional movie about\n\nBobby Sands\n\n, who, imprisoned by the British for his activities as a member of the Irish Republican Army, chose to refuse food until he died. In the lead,\n\nMichael Fassbender\n\n, who hadn’t yet emerged in such movies as “Inglourious Basterds” and “X-Men: First Class,” was shocking in appearance and galvanizing in energy, wit and commitment to the role. “Hunger” won awards all over the world, including the Cannes Film Festival, and marked Fassbender and McQueen as essential new talents.\n\nNow the two have reunited for\n\n\"Shame,\"\n\nanother searing film about a basic human need gone awry, which opens at Portland’s\n\nCinema 21\n\non Friday, December 16. Fassbender plays Brandan, an Irishman with a successful career in New York and a hidden addiction to pornography and casual, even sordid, sex. When Brandan’s estranged sister (\n\nCarrie Mulligan\n\n) appears suddenly in his life, he opens the door to her, and the messiness of his sex addiction spills into the open, threatening his career, his physical well-being, and his sanity.\n\nOnce again, Fassbender has thrown himself boldly into a role in which he bares his spirit, seemingly, as much as he does his body. Once again McQueen has found a filmic style that suits a disturbing subject matter. And, once again, awards and critical kudos have ensued.\n\nBut this time, there is controversy as well. “Shame” is filled with graphic scenes of sexual activity, and it has been branded by the Motion Picture Association of America with an\n\nNC-17\n\nrating, meaning not only that no one under the age of 17 can buy a ticket to it under any circumstances but that many theaters will not show it and many newspapers will not carry advertisements for it.\n\nIn his recent phone call, McQueen reflected on that reality as well as on the theme of the film, its setting, and his ongoing collaboration with Fassbender. His comments have been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nSo you've accidentally found yourself enmeshed in the arcana of the American movie rating system. What's that like for somebody who a) comes from another country and b) has a background in the uncensored world of fine arts?\n\nI was just saying to Michael (Fassbender), I didn’t even know what ‘NC-17’ was. I thought it was a rap band. I had no idea. I thought they were giving me an album. But, look, it’s one of those things where I feel that as long as people are able to see the movie, that’s all that counts. And I’m so happy that Fox Searchlight (the film’s distributor) are so supportive and willing to release the movie and have never discussed altering the movie in any way. All they want is for people to have a chance to see the film. As far as NC-17, violence seems to be the norm and what we do on a more human basis isn’t. Strange.\n\nYou and Michael have made two films together that it would seem would be very difficult for an actor -- really demanding physically. As a director, what's your role in these performances? Do you encourage, do you challenge, do you sit back and let him take risks?\n\nAll of that, really. There’s trust, there’s nurturing, there’s listening, there’s talking and telling. I think all of those things are involved with the performance because you can’t do it all on your own. I know I can’t. And at a certain point I have to let go and hope that Michael has the capacity to become what we’re trying for. The most important thing is his focus. Sometimes as a director you have to be like a boxing trainer: you put Vaseline on his cheeks, you put the water on his mouth, and you give him a little rubdown before he has to go back in for the next round.\n\nEven though you've written the script, and you know Michael, and you're there on the set while he's performing, do you ever find yourself surprised by what he delivers?\n\nSometimes, yes, absolutely, I am surprised. I mean, that’s what you want. And if it even happens once, you’re happy -- in life or as an actor. He becomes the character. Michael is very different from Brandon, but when he becomes the character then everything he does is a surprise to me because they aren’t the same fellow.\n\nYour two narrative features have addressed the primal human needs to eat and to procreate -- food and sex. And they're not pleasant: \"Hunger\" isn't about gourmandizing and \"Shame\" isn't about, as the phrase goes, making love. Is it your intent to, in effect, deconstruct the human animal?\n\nIt’s a coincidence, but a happy one. They’re two things that we must negotiate in our lives. And that gave me the passion to make films about them. In “Hunger,” Bobby Sands’ decision to give up eating is similar in that food and sex are two things that we can’t give up. They’re not like alcohol or drugs, say. And there really is no pleasure in sex for this character. Sexual addiction has as much to do with pleasure as alcoholism has to do with being thirsty.\n\nWhy is the film set in New York and not in London?\n\nA: Abi Morgan (McQueen’s co-screenwriter) and I started with the idea of a story about the internet and pornography and sexual addiction, and I thought, ‘Great.’ And I started to talk to people in London about the topic of sexual addiction and unfortunately no one wanted to speak to us. I think at the time it was something that was becoming prominent in the news, and people were suspicious of anyone asking them about it. And I spoke to a few experts in the field, and I found two of the top people were in New York, and they introduced us to a couple of people who were recovering from the condition, and I thought, ‘Why don’t we just make the movie here?’ And also I think that New York brings a visual thing to the film. It’s like a landscape, and you put the protagonist in the landscape of the city. What I mean by that is that most of the time in New York, people are living and working in the sky. And in this movie, that’s absolutely the case. Brandon’s in the sky in his office, in his apartment, and in the hotel. You’re always in the perspective of the city. The city and you are in one plane.\n\nHave you faced any particular challenges -- technical or conceptual -- in moving from art films to narratives?\n\nNo, not really. I’m not saying that it isn’t difficult at times, but nothing was particularly difficult. I’ve never been on a movie set in my life other than my own, so I’ve been able to create my own environment. And I love working with people who are experts in their fields, from hair to make-up to camera. And so to get those sort of people to help me make my movie has been joyous, not difficult. I feel like an artist who makes feature films. And I just do not see a difference between art films and feature films. It’s just the same thing as far as I’m concerned."
