        "text": "Ever since The Standard opened in 2009, looming high over the High Line and West Side Highway with its floor to ceiling windows, it’s been waiting for its close-up. At last, the sleekly sexy hotel — and its windows — figure prominently in a new movie, and wouldn’t you know, it’s rated NC-17?\n\nShame, the unsparing film with Michael Fassbender as a sex addled bachelor prowling Manhattan, features a prominent scene in a corner room at the Standard. For anyone who ever wanted a peek behind a door, the chicly contemporary Roman & Williams décor (and lots more) is on view – the clean lines, white walls, wood paneling and quiet luxury, with a large flatpanel TV in front of a window.\n\nThe curtains, of course, are wide open. Unfortunately, the view of the Hudson and downtown Manhattan is hampered by fog, especially early on. We weren’t sure whether to read something into this. Did the fog symbolize the confusion simmering in the tormented character played by Fassbender? Or was the movie simply shot on a foggy day?"
