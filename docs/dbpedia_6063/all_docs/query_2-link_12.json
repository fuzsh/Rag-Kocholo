        "text": "Film: Shame\n\nDirector: Steve McQueen\n\nProgram: Main Slate\n\nShowtimes: Oct. 7, Oct. 9\n\nWhy you should see it:\n\nShame is the much-anticipated second feature by British artist-turned-filmmaker Steve McQueen whose first film, Hunger, established him as a director to take seriously. It stars Michael Fassbender—deeply expressive even with little dialogue—as a sex-addicted New Yorker whose unstable sister, played by Carey Mulligan, moves in with him. The film captures the isolation of addiction, the desire for human connection, and the testing of boundaries between siblings. Shot on location in Manhattan, McQueen uses his now signature long tracking shots to present a convincing portrait of the lonely and dark corners of the city. Shame has gotten attention for scenes of explicit sex, but it is the actors’ complex and anguished performances outside of the bedroom that stay with you.\n\nTrack record:\n\nShame has played at the Telluride, Venice, and Toronto Film Festivals.\n\nAbout the director:\n\nSteve McQueen is a London-born artist and filmmaker. He was awarded the Turner Prize in 1999. Much of his artwork is projections of short black-and-white silent films, often starring himself. He made his first feature film, Hunger, in 2008. Michael Fassbender, in his breakout role, plays Bobby Sands, leader of the 1981 hunger strike in Ireland. It premiered at Cannes, where it won the Camera d’Or. It features the longest unbroken shot in a feature film (17 minutes).\n\nWhat the critics are saying:\n\n“Riveting, spectacular, passionate cinema.” —Andrew O'Hehir, Salon\n\n“Fluid, rigorous, serious cinema—the best kind of adult movie.” —Xan Brooks, the Guardian\n\n“A powerful, beautifully acted sophomore film.” —Oliver Lyttelton, The Playlist (indieWIRE)"
