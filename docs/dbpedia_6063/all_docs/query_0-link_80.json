His disturbing relationship with all women in the film, including with his sister played by Carey Mulligan, is absorbing and insightful. The “New York, New York” scene in a high-rise nightclub is haunting, as are most all of the sequences in the film, actually. The big city plays a critical role in the isolation the filmmaker captures, as the film is elegantly and hauntingly shot. It’s one of the best films of its year, despite being a tough subject.\n\nCheck Out Related News:"
