        "text": "Feeling the Halloween spirit, I decided to do a quick write-up on the eighth Friday the 13th Film, subtitled, Jason Takes Manhattan. However, the title should really be Jason Takes Vancouver, because due to budgetary restraints, almost the entire movie was shot there instead.\n\nSince it was significantly cheaper to film in Canada, it wasn’t uncommon for movies in the 1980s and 90s to have Vancouver or Toronto double for New York City (although hardly ever to great effect). But out of all of them, Friday the 13th Part VII might be the worst culprit, barely using any real NYC locations, and filming the majority of the “New York” scenes in a single, one-block alley. Even storywise, the first two-thirds of the movie didn’t take place in the large metropolis. Instead, it took place on a nondescript boat in the middle of nowhere. So maybe the title should’ve been, Jason Goes Yachting.\n\nBut since they did shoot a couple brief scenes in the Big Apple, I thought I’d take a closer look at the locations, as well as a bunch of the fake New York locations shot in Vancouver.\n\nOpening Credits\n\nThe movie starts with a couple establishing shots of New York City, but even this simple opening montage epitomizes how cheap production was. Aside from the shot of the Manhattan skyline (shown above), pretty much all the rest of the establishing shots were simply outtakes from other scenes that take place at the end of the film. The most noticeable one was of a bunch of punks hanging out in Times Square who end up being the same ones who confront Jason later in the story.\n\nIt’s really bizarre they didn’t have more of a variety of establishing shots of the city since that is one of the easiest and least expensive parts of on-location filming. That’s because it’s usually done by a second-unit team made up of a skeleton crew who can theoretically “steal” shots without getting a permit.\n\nArriving in New York\n\nIt takes over an hour before the movie gets us to New York City, and aside from these brief generic shots taken in the New York Harbor, the action quickly switches back to Vancouver, starting as soon as they reach the docks.\n\nThe online consensus seems to be that production shot the dock stuff in the industrial section near Downtown Eastside, just north of Centennial Road. But no one has provided any definitive proof, and since the area is generally closed off to the public, it’s probably not going to be solved anytime soon.\n\nI did notice that there are a few other similar-looking industrial areas located along Vancouver Harbor, so it’s possible this scene was shot at one of those instead. However, since we know it was definitely not shot in New York, I’m not overly concerned if it remains a mystery.\n\nAlleyway\n\nFor years, it’s been widely established that the majority of the “New York City” scenes were shot in Vancouver, Canada, but a lot of the exact spots were unknown. Then, a couple years ago, some of the production’s original call sheets were published online, and they provided specific details to some of the filming locations.\n\nFrom Day 7’s call sheet, you can see exactly what alley was used in these first scenes, which turned out to be the same alley used in almost all the other city scenes as well. The alley is located in Vancouver’s Gastown neighborhood, which is one of the oldest the city and has been the go-to place for filmmakers wanting to recreate New York City.\n\nInterestingly, since the studio was trying to keep the movie a secret during filming, the fake working title was “Ashes to Ashes,” and the Jason Voorhees character was listed as “Ethan” on all the call sheets.\n\nThis strategy seemed to work. In fact, actor V. C. Dupree, who played Julius the boxer, apparently didn’t know he was hired for the new Friday the 13th movie until he actually showed up on set.\n\nThe Boxing Match\n\nAfter investigating the established alleyway, it became clear that the beginning and ending to this scene took place there. And thanks to the very distinctive top on the building at 164 West Hastings Street, it was clear they shot the rooftop stuff on the neighboring building at no. 156, whose interior was later used in the diner scene.\n\nBy looking around in Google Street and Satellite Views, I was able to piece together all the angles used in the scene. The only part that confused me for a minute was the point-of-view shot looking down onto the main street. because I couldn’t find any matching buildings in any modern photos.\n\nThen, I considered that some of the buildings might’ve been replaced since 1989. So, I checked out some older views of Hastings Street in Google Maps and could see that one of the more prominent buildings in the POV shot did indeed get replaced around 2015.\n\nAfter I matched up the since-razed building at 308 W Hastings, along with the monument in Victory Square, I was able to get a better fix of where the camera was pointing in that POV shot.\n\nAs to the “before/after” images above, since I didn’t have access to the rooftops, I had to rely on Google 3D Satellite images to serve as the modern pictures. That’s why a couple of them look a little cartoony.\n\nThe Police Car\n\nI could tell they shot the first part of this rather bizarre scene in the all-too-familiar alleyway in Vancouver. I was able to pinpoint the exact spot by matching up an archway at the alley’s west entrance with what appears behind the Van Deusen character in the film.\n\nFinding the empty lot where the car exploded was easy since it was only a couple buildings away.\n\nWhile it was weird and absurd to have a “child Jason” suddenly appear, one of the more disconcerting things about this scene was the actor who played the New York cop. He absolutely had the most noticeably Canadian accent in the entire film, which seems like a very lazy casting choice. Of all the characters in the movie, a New York cop needed a thick local accent the most.\n\nThat being said, we do get a taste of the cliché Noo Yawk accent from a waitress (played by the director’s sister Peggy Hedden) in the subsequent “Diner” scene.\n\nKilling McCulloch\n\nOnce again, this killing scene took place in the alley south of West Hastings, just a few feet from where the last scene took place and the scene before that took place.\n\nThe one cool thing about this part of the movie is that the building McCulloch gets thrown out of has barely changed since 1989 (it’s just a little shabbier). As a result, it ended up being the most satisfying alley scene to match up.\n\nSubway\n\nAs mentioned countless times before, most of the city action took place in a one block area in Vancouver between Hastings and Pender Streets, but I knew this Subway scene had to have been shot somewhere else. Yet, I figured it probably wouldn’t be too far from the alley location.\n\nTo find it, the first thing I did was focus on the escalators inside the station, which I knew were not at New York’s 8th Street and Broadway, as indicated by the sign. (The real 8th Street station for the BMT looks nothing like that and is not deep enough to require such a long escalator.)\n\nKnowing it wasn’t shot in NYC, I just did a Google search for “Vancouver subway escalators” and almost immediately found a match in the Granville Station.\n\nUnfortunately, when I was in Vancouver in 2019, I hadn’t figured everything out for this location. So for the “before/after” image above, I had to use a random photo I found online for the “after,” which consequently didn’t line up perfectly with the “before.”\n\nWhile the Granville Station looked nothing like what existed in the New York subway system at the time, the set designers did do a great job with the sign. I’d even go as far to say it’s one the best fake MTA signs I’ve ever seen in film, matching the font and layout almost flawlessly. (Although, the movie failed in authenticity immediately afterwards when they entered the train car.)\n\nWhen it came to the exterior, I had hoped it was shot at the same station, but when I first looked around in Google Street View, nothing stood out.\n\nI then decided to look up the name “Derek London” whose sign appears behind Jason when he crashes through the door. After a little digging around, I found an address on Seymour, which I quickly assessed was the building that appeared across from the “Subway” entrance in this scene.\n\nTimes Square\n\nThis was the only principal NYC location used for Friday the 13th Part VIII, and anyone even vaguely familiar with the city could tell it was filmed in the iconic (and overused) Times Square.\n\nSince the scene started with a slow pan around the Square (milking this location for all its worth), it was easy to get a general fix on where it took place. Some of the big clues that helped me zero in on the exact spots were the McDonald’s (which has since been moved a couple blocks south) and the Marriott Marquis hotel (which is still there today).\n\nThe Marquis Marriott was pretty new to Times Square when they filmed these scenes in the spring of ’89 and was still considered a somewhat controversial addition to the area.\n\nWhen the gigantic hotel was first being planned in the late 1970s, it stirred up a great deal of criticism from the Broadway community because it would require the destruction of five old theaters on the site. Various lawsuits and protests kept delaying the start of construction, culminating in 1982 when several leaders in the theater community blocked bulldozers from knocking down the historic playhouses,.\n\nThe crowd included some famous faces from the stage and screen such as Christopher Reeve, Treat Williams, Richard Gere, and Susan Sarandon. Unfortunately, this last-ditch stunt didn’t delay things by more than a few hours, and ended with many of the protestors being escorted off the property in handcuffs.\n\nThree years later, the new hotel opened for business and became one of the most profitable in the Marriott chain.\n\nWhile the protests in 1982 ultimately failed in their specific goal, it did inspire the Landmarks Preservation Commission to be more proactive in dealing with the Times Square area. Within a few years following what’s come be known as “The Great Theatre Massacre,” the Commission landmarked around 25 theaters, thus saving them from possible demolition.\n\nWhen I first starting investigating the exact whereabouts of this filming location, the one “clue” that might’ve thrown me off the track was the subway entrance. As it turns out, the entrance was completely fake, not to mention, weirdly positioned at a 45 degree angle. The filmmakers obviously placed it there to create a more impactful visual —having the characters emerge smack center of Times Square— but it also added some artificiality to the scene. If you watch closely, you tell the actors were just crouching down below the railing and then just slowly rose up as if ascending the stairs.\n\nIt’s kind of sad that even the most authentic NYC location from the movie had to have a little fakery dropped in.\n\nDiner\n\nLike the alley scenes, the address of the diner was listed on the production’s call sheets which were recently released online. They even included a a nice little map showing its exact location at 156 West Hastings Street.\n\nBuilt in 1901 for a total cost of $10,000, 156 West Hastings was home to a variety of different businesses, such as a bicycle dealer, a plumbing company and sausage makers. By 1911, the retail space on the ground floor, which would later be used in this film, was occupied by the Trocadero Grill.\n\nWhen the restaurant first opened, it was advertised by owner Donald D McKinnon as “A Café for Highlanders, run by a Highlander,” which I guess meant it was tailored for a Scottish crowd. By the 1920s, after changing ownership, the Trocadero became a Greek restaurant with its own bakery and mezzanine balcony. It remained a Greek eatery at least into the 1950s, mainly catering to residents of nearby hotels and employees of local retail businesses.\n\nIn 1936, the Trocadero was the site of a notorious labor strike where the entire staff walked out for higher wages and better working conditions. One of the strikers, Marion Sarich, recalled in a 2001 interview:\n\n“I was a bus girl, I was working seven days a week at, I don’t know, I think it was 25 cents an hour. They weren’t allowed to work us over eight hours but they did. So we started organizing and had a strike.”\n\nBy 1984 and into the time this scene was filmed, the restaurant was called The Hastings Mill Restaurant, co-owned by Karl Engel, a former pastry chef at Vancouver’s Four Seasons Hotel. The Mill’s specialty seemed to be in the dairy category, and they even had an old fashioned soda fountain, which you can see in the movie. While charming in appearance, the Hastings Mill didn’t look like any New York diner I’ve ever seen.\n\nAt the time Friday the 13th Part VII was filmed there, the Gastown neighborhood in Vancouver was already starting to go downhill and the Mill eventually had to shut its doors. (I couldn’t find an official date, but I assume it was at some point in the 90s.)\n\nAs the 21st century rolled around, Gastown started to rebound, becoming a center for hip contemporary boutiques, as well as tourist-geared businesses. However, even today, the neighborhood has many pockets of poverty and criminality, stemming mostly from an ongoing opioid epidemic.\n\nBut the ground floor at a rennoved 156 W Hastings Street has since reopened. Now called Hastings Warehouse, it’s a trendy craft cocktail spot serving elevated bar food, while also embracing a rustic-industrial vibe.\n\nThe Ending\n\nBack in Times Square, I figured out the exact location of these last shots based on the Minskoff Theatre at 1515 Broadway which appears in the background. While most of the buildings around the Square have changed dramatically over the years, most of the theaters have stayed the same, including the Minskoff.\n\nYou can see in the film that back in 1989, the theater housed the Tony Award-winning revue, Black and Blue, which ended up playing there for two years. Today, it’s home to the world-famous musical, The Lion King, which first debuted in 1997 at the New Amsterdam Theatre then moved to its current location at the Minskoff Theatre in 2006.\n\nAside from the theater, everything else at the intersection of Broadway and 45th has changed quite a bit over the years, especially the Marriott Marquis building at 1535 Broadway which got renovated in 2014.\n\nAnd even though the tall and narrow skyscraper at One Times Square featured in this film’s closing shot is still around, it has received many technological updates since 1989.\n\nIt’s really a shame so little of New York was used in this eighth installment of the Friday the 13th series, as it was actually a pretty cool concept. But it was ultimately squandered by an inexperienced director and neutered by a frugal studio who didn’t want to shell out the extra cash necessary to film on location.\n\nIt’s one of those high concepts that needed to be done right, or just abandoned all together. Afterall, if you are going to have Jason and Manhattan in the title, you better deliver on that promise. The fact that they didn’t is probably why part eight is usually considered one of the worst in the franchise. (If they just named the film Jason Escapes Crystal Lake or something like that, audiences would’ve been pleasantly surprised when it ended up in NYC.)\n\nWhat might have been fun was to structure the story like a giant monster movie, such as King Kong, where everyone knows a supernatural killing machine is on the loose, ending with some big battle between Jason and the NYPD or the National Guard.\n\nAnyway, it is what is, and at the very least, Friday the 13th Part VIII has one of the coolest images from the entire series — a shot of the iconic Jason Voorhees in the middle of the iconic Times Square."
