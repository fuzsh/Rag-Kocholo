        "text": "If ambitious filmgoers let the NC-17 rating for “Shame” steer them clear of the sex-addiction drama starring Michael Fassbender that would be, in a word, a shame.\n\n“I’ve heard producers say, ‘I’m not sure the audience is ready for that kind of challenge,’ ” Fassbender said on the phone recently. “And I thought, ‘You arrogant bastard, how do you know?’ Give some credit to audiences. Audiences come into theaters with their own baggage and history and lives. The audience can teach me as much as I can hopefully reveal to them.”\n\nFassbender’s confidence in audience tastes and judgment is reflected in projects from “Shame” to the upcoming drama “A Dangerous Method,” from Quentin Tarantino’s “Inglourious Basterds” to “Jane Eyre” and “X-Men: First Class.” The latter is that too-rare species: a very fine tentpole flick with emotional gravity.\n\nFassbender is less worried about audience reaction than grateful for it. He has reason to be. In September, his raw performance as a New York City financial analyst who surfs porn sites, hires call girls and has a vexed and entwined relationship with his younger sister (Carey Mulligan) won him best-actor honors at the Venice Film Festival. As the movie rolls out gradually, clamor builds for an Oscar nomination.\n\nNudity at the outset\n\nGranted, “Shame” earns its rating outright and quickly as Brandon walks from his bedroom in the buff toward and then past the camera. Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way — director Steve McQueen and co-writer Abi Morgan seem to declare — we can get on to a compassionate, unsentimental portrait of compulsion and low-grade but persistent anguish.\n\nMcQueen has called sex addiction an “affliction.” But there is nothing “poor me” about the German-Irish actor’s performance.\n\nFassbender credits McQueen with the film’s undaunted yet humane gaze. “I trust Steve implicitly. It’s almost like we’re moving around in the dark together. You’re hoping to discover things and provoke and challenge each other,” he said.\n\n“Steve has this real openness and honesty with himself and those around him. He’s not afraid … well, he appears not to be afraid … to show a vulnerability, a femininity, a nerdish-ness, an insecurity, which most of us try to disguise, to put masks on, to not reveal. He makes you think there’s a great strength in that.\n\n“There’s a unity as well. We’re all trying to learn how to negotiate life. This film is very much about the here and now and about how people try to connect with each other. How they go about it. Some of them in a very destructive way.”\n\nTeamed for Bobby Sands film\n\n“Shame” is McQueen and Fassbender’s second outing together. In 2008’s “Hunger,” the actor shed more than 30 pounds to play Irish Republican Army volunteer and activist Bobby Sands, who died in a prison hunger strike he led in 1981. He was 27. His strike lasted 66 days.\n\n“Hunger” marked an auspicious debut (or sorts) for each. Fassbender had performed in a number of British television shows and a couple of films (including “300”) but the Sands story was his breakthrough role.\n\nMcQueen was a major figure in the art world, having been awarded in 1999 Britain’s Turner Prize, given to an artist under 50. Although he had created video installations, “Hunger” was his first movie.\n\n“Shame” secures Fassbender’s place among the most dynamic performers working on-screen today and the director’s place as a bold maker of difficult, beautifully composed films.\n\nSoon Fassbender will appear in David Cronenberg’s heady drama “A Dangerous Method.” He portrays psychoanalyst Carl Jung. The movie recounts the interpersonal and professional dramas of psychological frontiersmen Jung and Sigmund Freud. Keira Knightley portrays Sabina Spielrein , who was Jung’s patient, student, lover. (It’s due in Denver in early January.)\n\n“Shame” director McQueen sees Fassbender as a fellow traveler. “He’s an artist,” he told New York Magazine recently. “He’s not an actor. There are a lot of actors out there, but he’s actually an artist.”\n\nIn the same interview, however, McQueen was very stern in his insistence that “Shame” is not “a Fassbender movie.”\n\nHe’s right, in a sense. The movie’s a chamber piece of strong, enmeshed performances. Yes, he’s correct, of course.\n\nBut don’t believe him for a minute.\n\nLisa Kennedy: 303-954-1567 or lkennedy@denverpost.com"
