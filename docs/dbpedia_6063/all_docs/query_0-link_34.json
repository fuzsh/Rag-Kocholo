        "text": "Though released in early December 2011, the controversial buzz over Steve McQueen’s Shame began months prior when details of the films provocative nature, including multiple full-frontal scenes with star Michael Fassbender, came out after it received the infamous NC-17 rating. While such a rating pretty much guarantees box-office failure (the film only grossed $3 million domestically), studio Fox Searchlight Pictures never challenged the MPAA (take that Harvey Weinstein, who vigorously fought to change Blue Valentine’s rating the same year) and instead embraced the NC-17ness of the film, creating a marketing campaign chock full of sex, rustling bed sheets, and semi-nude bodies. The media quickly turned the film into the “movie with Michael Fassbender’s penis”, a generalization that may have led to a few nice jokes at awards shows but one that does a huge disservice to the film. Between a dynamite combination of acting and directing, Shame is a riveting, exhaustive drama about addiction and the connections it destroys and creates simultaneously. With McQueen’s latest, 12 Years A Slave, receiving rave reviews, tons of Oscar buzz, and a nationwide push over the next two weeks, there’s no better time to watch the director’s last masterpiece, Shame, which also features 12 Years co-star Michael Fassbender in the lead role.\n\nThe plot follows Brandon (Fassbender, robbed of an Oscar nomination), a handsome and successful thirty-something living in New York City, as he grapples day in and day out with sex addiction, a nasty habit that he tries to hide from his peers and that’s only made more complicated when his equally damaged sister, Sissy (the always incredible Carey Mulligan), shows up at his door needing a place to live. Yes, there is sex, but like any great film about addiction, the story is less about the addiction (lovemaking and one night stands) and focuses more on the disconnections Brandon has formed with the world due to his addiction and what a reconnection with his sister could do to change or ruin his current state of being (the film does an excellent job of showing what that state is and how it painfully feels). While we do get raw glimpses of sex every so often, it’s never joyous or warm or playful; it’s painful, cold, and unbearable, descriptions we come to identify Brandon with as well.\n\nExcitingly, Shame’s plot feeds two truly powerful performances from its main leads. In the hands of other actors, I’m not so sure how Shame would’ve played out, but with Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan dominating almost every shot, the film is acted flawlessly. If The Tree of Life, Drive, and We Need To Talk About Kevin weren’t enough, Shame was another 2011 drama with an overbearing silence that served as a searing emotional punch. Fassbender and Mulligan speak in the film but not often, and instead, every glance and every action they make help us understand each of their characters as equally damaged individuals. In the movie, a past family tragedy seems to be the reason why the two have disconnected over the years (a molestation possibly?), but McQueen never reveals the event that triggered it all; instead, he leaves Fassbender and Mulligan to show us the current emotional states of their characters, and man how they do. The two bare a withered, damaged history on their faces and through their expressions and it’s devastating to watch them spin out of control. It’s vulnerability of the highest order.\n\nEven more tremendous is McQueen’s direction. He traps his characters between frames constantly, either through windows or doors or the actual frame of the camera itself, which increases the vulnerability of the characters on screen through close ups and visually represents how the pressures, stresses, and nerves from addiction imprison the self. The stylized shots of lofty and expensive New York apartments only adds to the alluring visual style of the film too; in a movie all about what pleases the eye, McQueen wisely polishes each shot with a shiny gloss. Perhaps best is the extreme longevity in which McQueen holds his frames, a directing technique that has earned him a spot as a “hate him or love him” kind of filmmaker. It may not be everyone’s cup of tea because god only knows the average patience of a standard adult, but the long holding of frames in the film glued me to my seat as I tried to figure out every inch of every shot. Be it long shots of Brandon’s empty apartment with open doors and big windows (emotionless parallels to Brandon’s bleak, empty soul) or reaction shots of characters that stay on screen long after the reaction is over, McQueen’s direction may have you fidgety and checking your watch but there’s no doubt it all plays a fundamental role in the expierence of the film – while characters may be off doing things, the camera, and by extension you the viewer, are stuck in time and place, just like Brandon because of his addiction, just like Sissy because of her need for family, and so on.\n\nA tour-de-force scene of Mulligan’s Sissy giving a slow burning, melancholic rendition of “New York, New York” perfectly sums up everything I find so haunting and out right incredible about Shame. It’s a scene that shows just how painful Fassbender and Mulligan are in these roles and the lengthy frame holds of McQueen’s directorial style. Not only does Sissy get uncomfortably trapped in the frame as she sings, but so to does Brandon in a reaction shot that, as I said before, stays on screen long after Brandon has given his tearful looks of regret.\n\nIn case you missed it, Shame is a film I strongly recommend regardless of its sexual subject matter; just the acting and directing alone are worth the 2 hour run time. After seeing it and falling for it hard, the fact that it was ever called the “movie with Michael Fassbender’s penis” is outraging. Screw Fassbender’s privates, this film has Fassbender himself in an incredible, award-worthy lead performance (what a snub he wasn’t nominated!), and with Mulligan in a supporting role and McQueen at the helm, this is one film that will stick with you long after the final frame. I think Roger Ebert said it best when he concluded his 4-star review by writing, “This is a great act of filmmaking and acting. I don’t believe I would be able to see it twice.” It might be a haunting and mentally exhaustive experience, but Shame is a powerhouse drama, so what are you waiting for? Without a doubt, give Shame a try.\n\nMcQueen may not have been able to please the Academy with this one, which isn’t surprising given its subject matter, but it looks like his fortunes should change dramatically with 12 Years A Slave, the current co-front runner for Best Picture (along with Gravity). McQueen is likely to earn a Best Director nomination while Michael Fassbender is a lock for a Supporting Actor nomination. A brilliant director and deserving actor finally getting the recognition they deserve from the American film industry – now that’s beautiful.\n\nHave you seen Shame? Will you be seeing 12 Years A Slave this weekend?"
