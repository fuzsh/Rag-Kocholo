        "text": "Rating: 2 out of 5 stars\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nOpens locally Friday, December 16th, 2011\n\nRun Time: 1 hour 41 minutes, Rated NC-17\n\nStarring: Michael Fassbender, Carey Mulligan\n\nDirected by Steve McQueen (Hunger)\n\n​Shame is rated NC-17, but it didn’t have to be. It is a movie about sexual addiction, that itself is addicted to sex and nakedness. Be forewarned that this is not a movie for people uncomfortable with the material. There is plenty of sex, frontal nudity (both male and female), and adult content galore. At the risk of sounding prudish, couldn’t Shame have explored this subject with a bit of awareness that an audience will need to sit through it? There is a well-acted and shorter R-rated version of Shame buried somewhere underneath this one, and it’s a shame to think of how much more powerful that version could have been. Is the director trying to make a rebellious statement by releasing it as an NC-17 film? I think that a few cuts here and there would have been the bolder move actually."
