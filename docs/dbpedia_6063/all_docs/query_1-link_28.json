        "text": "The second domestic trailer for Steve McQueen’s adult drama Shame was released on Thursday.\n\nThroughout the minute and a half clip, a sad and somehow sexy version of “New York, New York” plays in the background. It turns out this is Carey Mulligan’s own beautiful voice carrying the tune. The song comes into play when Michael Fassbender’s character, Brandon, goes to a restaurant to see his younger sister sing.\n\nPHOTOS: The Dirty Dozen: Films that Narrowly Avoided an NC-17\n\nShame, which has an NC-17 rating, centers around Brandon, a compulsive sex addiction, whose insular life spirals out of control when his sister comes to town.\n\nSTORY: Nudity, Three-Ways, Hints of Incest: A Studio’s Plan to Sell ‘Shame’ to Oscar\n\nBecause of the highly sexual content of the film, including scenes of full frontal nudity from both Fassbender and Mulligan, the film received an NC-17 rating. Searchlight is not planning to appeal the rating or make any cuts to secure an R-rating. Instead, it’s readying a major awards push for the film.\n\nTHR’s Directors Roundtable: How to Fire People, Who to Steal From, and Amy Pascal’s Secret Advice\n\nMcQueen’s (who is featured in THR‘s director roundtable) erotic drama premiered at the Venice Film Festival, where Fassbender won the Best Actor award. It was also show at the Toronto Film Festival, and acquired by Fox Searchlight. The film will see release into theaters on December 2."
