        "text": "British artist and filmmaker Steve McQueen’s Shame opens with a single long shot of its leading man, Michael Fassbinder, lying naked under blue sheets, tussled on his bed like drapery in a renaissance painting. His hand rests near his waist line and the sheets swoop just below, cutting across his body, barely obscuring his pubic area. Fassbinder stares straight ahead, just off camera. As in his feature debut, Hunger, McQueen shows a mastery of simple, quite shots – sequences that focus on process as a way of revealing character. In this instance, the process is merely getting out of bed, and when Fassbinder finally gets up, the title of the film – “Shame” – appears across the screen in black letters. We know why (if not specifically) waking up was such a process.\n\nShame is a movie about addiction, and addictions shroud themselves in their own kinds of processes, which fits McQueen’s quiet, detailed brand of filmmaking. He builds up his characters image by image, small motion by small motion, and his work reminds us that investing an audience in a character sometimes requires little more than acquainting us through the camera with an individual’s intimate moments. In Hunger, McQueen opened by stepping through a prison guard’s morning routine, buttoning his shirt, wiping crumbs from a napkin on his lap. Similarly, Shame shows Fassbinder’s Brandon Sullivan brushing his teeth and going to the bathroom.\n\nNot five minutes into the movie and we see Fassbinder’s much chatted-about full-frontal nudity scene. If you’re sensitive to that sort of thing, stay away from the often naked and graphic Shame. But provocative sexuality and nudity prove to be some of McQueen’s most potent tools. With his film about sexual addiction, the director has to walk that tricky tightrope of exposing us to Brandon’s sexual deviancy while not portraying sex and sexuality itself as deviant by nature (a trap that has snared films like Paul Schraeder’s Auto Focus).\n\nAlso important to maintaining Shame’s appeal and efficaciousness is McQueen’s ability to maintain our identification with Brandon. Shame is a tightly-cropped character study, but it’s character drives the film through the many sordid aspects of his sex life. Brandon is addicted to sex, and for much of the film’s quiet first half-hour, we watch howBrandon goes about satisfying his incessant need. He wakes with faceless random women. He masturbates in his work bathroom. He stares at an attractive, young married woman on the other side of aNew York subway train with a mix of seduction and licentiousness. When his gregarious, if nerdy boss asks him out to go prowling for girls, he sits patiently and silently on the outskirts of the circle of flirters, working the women with his eyes and waiting for his prey like a big cat. Brandon is addicted to the pleasure of sex, but he also feeds on the game.\n\nMovies about addiction can often feel too one dimensional, too fixated on abnormality. We alternately pity and resist addicts on screen, and it is easy to distance ourselves from them. If Shame feels like it is trending in this direction it is in part because its world –Brandon’s world – is so cramped, claustrophobic. New York feels here like a rat maze, full of tight spaces. Light breaks through in the form a coworker, the beautiful Marianne (Nicole Beharie) who actually tries to engage Brandon in something that resembles a relationship. Not only does Brandon resist emotional intimacy, he can’t even have sex with Marianne, calling a prostitute soon after she leaves their failed encounter.\n\nThe central dramatic tension which fuels McQueen’s movie is the question ofBrandon’s self-imposed emotional isolation. To wrestle him back, it will take his sister Sisssy (Carey Mulligan). Like Brandon, Sissy suffers from some deep familial scar and is desperate and destructive in her own way. We first meet Sissy when she is naked in Brandon’s shower. She a singular sexual object that holds no sway on the 30-something addict, and yet it is her hysterical intrusion into his life that begins to crack through Brandon’s exoskeleton.\n\nWhile Shame is a brilliantly crafted study of its subject, its execution – the shallow-focused shots, high contrast whites, which blur-out Brandon’s complexion, at times reminiscent of both Aronofsky and Kieslowski – proves more seductive than its subject manner. Shame is a simple film, after all, probing a singular question. Can a man shackled by his own shame and lack of self worth, wrestle himself free? To get to an answer, McQueen takes us on an intoxicating ride, but it is not one that lingers."
