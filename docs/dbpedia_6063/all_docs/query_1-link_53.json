        "text": "This article includes the Suits filming locations. Although the series is set in New York City, it has been mostly filmed in Toronto, Ontario. After filming the pilot in New York City, producers shifted the series shoot to Toronto due to tax credits in Canada.[1]\n\nNew York City\n\nIn the pilot, as Mike Ross arrives in New York for his first day at — then — Pearson Hardman, he looks up at the well known Citigroup Center tower, at 601 Lexington Avenue. The tower is easily recognizable for its famous design where it seemingly \"hovers\" above the ground on pillars.\n\nIn the lobby, as Mike admires the view, we see Central Park from inside the tower.\n\nToronto\n\nExterior, lobbies and restaurants shots\n\nThe 51-story skyscraper known as Bay Adelaide West, a part of the Bay Adelaide Centre located in Toronto´s Financial District on 333 Bay Street, serves as the office of Pearson Specter Litt. It is often featured on establishing shots, exterior shots and shots of the lobby.\n\nFairmont Royal York lobby shot was featured in episode “Inside Track”, seen as a hotel's lobby where a board meeting of McKernon Motors was held. The lobby scene of Harvey and Jones DeBeque's meeting with Daniel Vega and Vega's attorney Dana Scott in DeBeque's hotel (episode “Play the Man”) was filmed in the lobby of The Ritz-Carlton Hotel on 181 Wellington Street West.[2]\n\nSet\n\nThe most seen set in the series is the one of Pearson Specter Litt's office. It includes Harvey Specter's office with his secretary Donna Paulsen's desk, Jessica Pearson's office, which used to be Daniel Hardman's before he left the firm in 2007, Louis Litt's old office (since the episode “Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner” belonging to Jeff Malone), corner's office currently belonging to Louis Litt (before Hardman's comeback it was a library, then Hardman's office and after his dismissal belonging to Stephen Huntley, Dana Scott and then for a short time to Jeff Malone), Mike Ross' office (old Harvey's office), Rachel Zane's office, associates' bullpen, associates's kitchen (also known as the water cooler area), library, bathroom, conference room, hallway and file room.\n\nThe Manhattan scenery behind the windows is made in form of mural backdrop (one for a daytime and another for a nighttime scenery).[3]"
