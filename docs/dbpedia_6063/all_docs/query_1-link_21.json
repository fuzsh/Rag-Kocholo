        "text": "This is a lovely scene from Shame which comes from the dudes at Digital Spy and shows Carey Mulligan singing a slowed down version of New York, New York while Michael Fassbender looks on. It’s a beautiful scene which sets the mood beautifully for this fabulous film. If you missed our review, you can see it here but suffice to say, we liked it a lot.\n\nShame stars Michael Fassbender, Carey Mulligan, James Badge Dale, Nicole Beharie, Hannah Ware, Elizabeth Masucci and is directed by Steve McQueen who previously worked with Fassbender on Hunger. This new movie deals with the topic of sex addiction with a script from Abi Morgan and it’s hard hitting stuff but it’s beautifully shot at this five minute scene with Carey singing is just fantastic.\n\nShame is released in UK cinemas today and you can see all our coverage here.\n\nSynopsis: Brandon (Michael Fassbender) is a New Yorker who shuns intimacy with women but feeds his desires with a compulsive addiction to sex. When his wayward younger sister (Carey Mulligan) moves into his apartment stirring memories of their shared painful past, Brandon’s insular life spirals out of control."
