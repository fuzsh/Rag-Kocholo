        "text": "For Mary Evans Babst in Switzerland, it was a summer of farewells. Her brother, a cousin, and several close friends died, and with COVID restrictions, farewells were not possible. After over a year, returning to church and Sunday Mass was a joy for Mary. In summer, her family invited heron a three-day Swiss Glacier Express trip to Zermatt and St. Moritz. “The cloud cover remained higher than the spectacular peaks, so we were able to admire the geological wonders of creation, as well as the engineering feats and human cost of dozens of bridges and tunnels built forour pleasure.” • There is sad news from Evie Higgins Beveridge in Scituate. Her husband, Nelson, and her brother, Jim, died during the summer. Please keep all of them in your prayers. Fortunately, Evie has many friends and some family near to support her at this difficult time. • I had a long conversation with Maureen Cohalan Curry. All is well with her in Bristol, Rhode Island. • In closing, the Dalys again were able to have the annual family reunion in July. Our daughter, Ann, came from London. A good time was had by all.\n\nWe heard from Shirley McKenna, who would love to hear from all of us. “Hi to all our Class of ’56 survivors! Our news from Dublin—hubby battling Parkinson’s but his many friends still walk him daily by the seafront...I’ve spent the year cataloging and boxing our collection of books accumulated over the years...it got me through our strict lockdown. We so miss the visits of our five children, 13 grandchildren, and great-grandson but as all are well, that is the greatest of blessings. Keep well, mentally and physically. Love to all.” • Ursula Connors lovingly cares for her husband John and is in good health herself. She frequently speaks with Gail. I think this is the first time our intrepid Sr. Gail O’Donnell hasn’t submitted her many activities, but we have spoken and she is as active as ever. • I (Cathy) participated in a phase-two clinical trial for macular degeneration. My daughter, Naomi, took me to Florida and maneuvered me around to the evaluations and surgery while she worked online. Happy results with sufficient improvement that enables me to continue driving. Two of my children wrote books: Dan Hickey’s A Classic Path Through High School for early teens, and Naomi Brickel’s Not to Spoil the Ending…but everything is going to be OK after the tragic loss of her 15-year-old son, Adam. Please, dear classmates, send me an email even just to say that you’re alive and well!\n\nGreetings to the great Class of ’57. Hard to imagine that our class will be celebrating our 65th Reunion this year. The kickoff to our 65th was a get-together in September held at the Cadigan Alumni Center, which was funded and named for Pat Cadigan ’57. Bill Cunningham spearheaded this wonderful event enjoyed by approximately 40 of our classmates. The event included the television viewing of the BC vs. Temple football game, followed by a Mass celebrated by classmate Father Gene Sullivan, DEd’81. • Received a note from Ed Hines indicating he and his wife, Anne, have ended their living in Naples, Florida, and have established themselves in Harwichport. Ed is still very active in veterans programs, the DAV, and the Wounded Warrior Project. • Paul Daly writes that he, Jim Devlin, and Jim Doherty recently were guests of Bill Cunningham for golf and lunch at Woodland GC. • Dick O’Brien reports that he and his wife, Jane, celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary in Ogunquit, Maine, with their three children and eight grandchildren. His daughters Kristen ’89 and Carolyn ’90 were of great help to them during the pandemic. His granddaughter, Maeve Holland, is a member of the Class of 2025. • Bill Cullinane has attained his Irish citizenship and celebrated it with a family golf outing in Chatham, where he and his wife reside. Be on the watch for more information on our upcoming 65th class reunion.\n\nElizabeth Doyle Eckl reports that after much thought and tired of dealing with worries of house maintenance, she has sold her house and made the “big move” to a rented condo not far from her old home. She has close friends there and all is working out well. Liz also had a joyful event with a family gathering at her oldest granddaughter Sophie Elizabeth’s wedding in the Shenandoah area of Northern Virginia. She sends warm wishes to her classmates. • Barbara Lowe Eckel writes of a bittersweet trip to her island home of Jamaica. The trip was mainly to visit her sister, who died two days after Barbara’s visit. Her group stayed at Half Moon in a villa where the staff planned a birthday party for Barbara in the beautiful surroundings of a wildlife sanctuary, botanical garden, and old-world charm. Despite dealing with arthritis, she is passionate about gardening in her community garden near her home. Barbara is pleased with all the advances of hearing aids, as she reminds us that her first child was born profoundly deaf. (Strange coincidence: Barbara was my freshman roommate at Newton; my grandchild who is a freshman at Tulane called me to say her freshman roommate in college is from Jamaica. [I assured her they would have a wonderful friendship, as I did.]) • Ellie Pope Clem writes of her dance, exercise, writing, poetry groups, etc., at the Colonnades in Charlottesville, Virginia. They also have a Catholic group with monthly visits from parish ministers.\n\nAnthony Busa ’59 and Bea Capraro Busa now spend most of the year in Naples, Florida. We thank Bea for the many years she organized the Naples luncheons. • Paul Fennell is smiling again now that he’s back to dancing a couple of times a week in Orlando. • We have our own “Spy Who Came in from the Cold” in Guy Guarino. Guy, of Ipswich, is finally able to share stories from his days as a communications intelligence analyst officer in the U.S. Army in the years surrounding the Korean “Conflict” and the Cold War. After ROTC and BC graduation, he worked with NSA agents and the Republic of Korea military intelligence community to intercept and interrogate North Korean agents who penetrated South Korea. Life was not without mishaps. One time, their small landing craft, returning in the Yellow Sea from North Korea under cover of darkness, ran aground on a sandbar. Guy and his colleagues feared the results when in the morning they were observed by locals and an unknown helicopter. Fortunately, they made it away. His identity and missions were seriously restricted: no letters home to friends or family, including his wife, Frances. To conceal his identity, he was paper-transferred from the Army Security Agency to another branch of the Army. Forty years later, Social Security had no record of his military service. Guy’s stories began to surface in June when he visited Omaha to watch his grandson, an All-American swimmer and U.S. Nationals bronze-medal winner from Auburn University, compete in Olympic trials. They visited the Strategic Air Command Museum where Korean War aircraft are exhibited. The visit prompted Guy’s grandson to ask questions and, for the first time, Guy shared some war experiences. • On a personal note, I, Marian Bernardini DeLollis, spent two grand weeks in a Wai’ula’ula estate at Mauna Kea on the Big Island in Hawaii. Getting there, though, required an 11-hour, direct flight from Boston to Honolulu, a brief layover, and an hour-long flight to Kona. I was hosted by my vacationing daughter and son-in-law Karen and Mark McLean, both ’88, and entertained by my grandson, Grayson (10), who is already an impressive golfer. Karen, Mark, and Grayson held their own, playing four award-winning, 18-hole courses. I just cheered them on.\n\nTrue to her Sacred Heart commitment, Rosemary Stuart Dwyer has been working on plans for the next AASH National Conference in spring 2023. It will be held in Rhode Island at the second Elmhurst, a boarding school which is housed in a lovely French manor. • Maureen O’Donnell Kent’s summer was highlighted by visits from her granddaughter, Jennifer, a sophomore at Notre Dame, and lunch with Sue Baxter and Bob Baxter in Rhode Island at the boat house in Riverton. The Baxters live in East Greenwich, Rhode Island, and the Kents in Wellesley. The Kents will return to Naples, Florida, in January. • Peg Keane Timpson enjoyed a summer of beach time and golf. She celebrated her third great-grandson’s christening with a big family gathering. Peg plans time in Florida during the winter. • Jo Kirk Cleary regrets being unable to continue her usual yard work. Instead, she purchased a rose bush in a container on rollers. This solution serves her well. Busy grandchildren were only able to make a few day trips to the Cape, but Jo enjoyed beach dinners with her brothers and their wives. Her youngest grandchild is now on a football team and she looks forward to his games. • Julie Saver Reusch is adjusting to apartment living. The benefit: a smaller space makes it easier to clean. • Marge George Vis’s activities include tedious visits to doctors in search of final healing of her left hip replacement and two skin surgeries on her left shin. She totters and weaves slowly, but is now without a cane or walker. She enjoyed visits to her family cottages during the summer, and in January she spent five weeks in Cabo San Lucas with friends. She hopes to return in 2023. • While Judith Young Runnette has no news to report, she hopes everyone enjoyed a happy and blessed holiday season. • Sue Fay Ryan stays busy in her waterfront condo in North Palm Beach, Florida. Herosteoporosis and macular degeneration are under control and a personal trainer helps her maintain good health. She republished her first book and is working on her second bilingual book for elementary students in English and Spanish immersion programs. Each of the books will be posted on her website. • The Schorrs are holding their own in New Jersey. Last fall, they visited Madison, Wisc., where they watched the Army/Wisconsin game and met their grandson’s future in-laws. They look forward to this wedding in July. I hope all are thinking reunion 2023!\n\nI received news from our classmate Tom Tierney, Carroll School, of Arlington. He writes that he takes his morning walk to a neighborhood Dunkin’ Donuts where he joins his contemporaries in a discussion/argument about the day’s news. After an hour or so, he walks home, mad. Why don’t these guys understand? Next day, same routine, but I suppose it’s good for the blood circulation. He is also a longtime season ticket holder for BC hockey. He described his first visit this season for a game: In the Comm. Ave parking garage near the Forum, he looked out at the Lower Campus and realized that the “Plex” was gone, replaced by a lovely lawn. Who still remembers the ponds that were there when we were parking and then walking up those long wooden stairways? He also looks forward to the Laetare Sunday Mass and Brunch and the Veteran’s Memorial Mass on campus. • John W. Fitzgerald, physics major, late of South Boston and Dorchester, now of San Francisco, writes with a family story that belongs in the category of “suspect genes.” His grandson, Kyle Walsh, a freshman at UCLA, while enjoying a COVID-induced first semester in Hawaii, had his surf board rise up, strike him in the face, and break his jaw. Fitzie never should have left the bosom of Carson Beach. So, stay well and send some news.\n\nDouble Eagles Joe Shields ’61, Jim Reilly, Allan McLean, Matt Connolly, and myself were among the attendees at a special luncheon on the Boston College High School campus marking 65 years since our graduation. BC adjunct professor Dave Twomey ’62 was the architect of this event. Sadly, Matt passed away a few weeks thereafter. A graduate of BC Law School, he was a former U.S. Marine Corps officer as well as a career prosecutor and deputy district attorney for Norfolk County. • The social highlight for the class was the previously postponed celebration of the 60th anniversary of our BC graduation. Although attendance was limited in size, the following stalwarts were on hand for a delightful luncheon in historic Gasson 100: Eugene and Maura Connors, Paul and Jean Cunningham, Pauline Doherty and Paul Croke ’55, Joyce Dwyer, Vin and Peggy Failla, Bernie and Pat Gleason, Bob and Alice Hart, Gerard Hayes, Robert and Sheila Kelley, Tom and Sandra Kelly, Allan and Mary Ann McLean, Jack McNealy, Bob and Alyce Morrissey, Fred and Ann Marie O’Neill, Jim Reilly, Jane (Shea) Sullivan, Fr. Leo Shea M.M., John Sheehan, and Carolyn (Duffy) Winer. • Well-deserved kudos are due to our one-man committee of classmate Fred O’Neill and to Corinne Wyson ’16 and her dedicated colleagues from the Alumni Association for the success of this memorable milestone. • The Waltham Little League has honored retired dentist Vin Failla with a permanent trophy in his name celebrating his many years of volunteering with the city’s young people. • Checking the calendar our 65th is only three years away! Sláinte.\n\nAs promised, we highlight our grandsons. Nan Anderson Coughlin has a BC-grad football player, working in finance in San Francisco. Her other grandson is a junior at Trinity College on its golf team. Her great-grandson lives in Omaha. • Anne Canniff Boyle’s eldest grandson is a lawyer in Detroit. A med student, the second is at Mayo studying to be a plastic surgeon, while the third is a Chicago high schooler active in track and basketball. She also has eight- and seven-year-old grandsons. • Joan Dimenna Dahlen’s grandson is a doctor on the Harvard Medical faculty. Number two is a UC-Santa Barbara grad and a project manager. Number three is a freshman at Westfield Community College in New Jersey. Number four is a 15-year-old, accepted to Paper Mill Playhouse, an educational performance venue. • Lennie Coniglio DeCsepel’s seven- and four-year-old grandsons attend St. David’s School in NYC. • Betsy DeLone Balas’s 17-year-old grandson in California is interested in engineering. He built and launched a rocket in the Nevada desert. Two grandsons live in Raleigh: a 14-year-old, 6'2\" basketball player and his 12-year-old brother, a swimmer. • Mickey Mahon MacMillian’s grandsons are graduates of UMass Amherst and Providence College. • Carole Ward McNamara’s grandsons all had scholarships to their various schools. The eldest graduated Colgate, played hockey, and is now in commercial real estate. His brother, a BC grad, also played hockey. The next two hockey players are Holy Cross grads. A University of Oklahoma grad is in sports manufacturing. Grandson number six graduated from Penn State in engineering, then changed jobs to become a singer, guitar player, and music composer in Nashville. His brother, in veterinarian studies at Colorado State, had an internship working in a sanctuary with wild animals. Her eighth grandson, born at four-and-a-half months, is visually impaired but graduated from New England Academy and has a scholarship to Merrimack College. • Dot Radics McKeon has a grandson working for Google, a sophomore in high school, and a sixth grader. • Suzanne Kenney Gaetano’s grandson at the University of Vermont is a sophomore interested in being an Air Force pilot. • Kathy McDermott Kelsh’s grandsons are: a junior at BC, a freshman at University of Denver, a senior at Chaminade High School, and fourth, third, and first graders. • The Alumni office has started to develop class celebration plans for delayed class reunions of 2020 and 2021, together with 2022, the weekend of June 3–5, 2022.\n\nBrigid O’Sullivan Sheehan traveled to Pocasset on Cape Cod to enjoy a visit with Babs Kager this summer. Babs recently moved to the Cape to be closer to her daughter. • Mary Nolan Calise and Janet Miele organized a second mini NC’61 reunion at Janet’s house on the Cape in August. Attendees were Gael Sullivan Daly, Paula Keane Teeling, Nancy O’Neil, Nancy Campanella Lacobucci, and Linda Gray MacKay. Babs Kager and Micky McQueeny Matthews were to join but last-minute family commitments precluded that. • Juliana Fazakerly Gilheany wrote in the fall, “This semester NYU is totally remote. Fordham is hybrid, which is hard. I lecture two hours in a mask facing about 30 students and simultaneously on Zoom.” • Maryann Morrissey Curtin writes that she and Ellen MacDonald Carbone “are braving the Boston traffic to attend the Boston Symphony. We have attended for the past 25 years. We have enjoyed the evening starting with dinner at the Symphony Cafe. We have had rather same seats. We are happy to have a time to discuss world, family, and friends’ events; philosophy; and the latest books we are reading. If anyone in the area wishes to join us… !” • Although Bob and I had to cancel our Rhine cruise trip in September, we were able to join three of our children, their spouses, and grands for a few days in Colorado in July. While we did it in stages (thanks to our Denver son’s planning) going from an altitude of 502' to 5,200' in Denver, to 9,600' in Breckenridge, and to 11,440' in Keystone can take your breath away. Stay in touch, stay well, and, as Juliana says, “stay safe.”\n\nJoyce Francis McDevitt and Patricia Stabile Marma have remained friends since graduation. When Patty and her daughter Marijean ’86—long-time residents of Ft. Lauderdale—came north in July to visit a South Shore family, they spent an enjoyable day in the North End with Joyce. • Life is good with Paul Apholt. He and his wife, Eleanor, have recently returned from attending homecoming weekends for two grandsons, one at the University of North Carolina and the other at Gonzaga University. Representing Boston College is their youngest daughter, who is getting married next summer. • At a recent social event marking the 75th launching of the Exchange Club of Needham, Paul Deeley received the president’s pin from his wife, Maureen. • We offer our sincere condolences to the families of the following classmates: John Breen graduated with a BS in physics. He leaves his wife, Kathleen, and five children. He loved collecting Lionel trains. David Allen majored in accounting. He leaves his wife, Freda, and three children. Kevin Leary founded VPNE Parking Solutions in 1990, a company he successfully built with his son, Kevin. He was very supportive of organizations like Camp Harborview, Nativity Prep, and Christmas in the City. He leaves his wife, Mary Kelleher, and six children. For Donald Lemieux, a BC accounting degree was followed by a law degree from American University. He maintained a private law practice in Falls Church, Virginia. He is survived by his wife, Carol, and three children. After starting out at BC in the pre-med program, Stephen Burns completed his career as chief of radiology at a hospital in Warwick. He leaves his wife, Nancy, and four children. John Jenney attained a doctorate of law. He practiced with the Massachusetts court system as first assistant registrar of probate for Norfolk County. He is survived by his wife, Kathleen. While Frank Faggiano achieved a successful career as a VP in human resources, he devoted himself to helping young people find their career path and supporting the BC baseball program. • I’m guessing it’s the age, but there’s a lot of reminiscing going on. When Gerald Greely recalled that Frank and I met freshman year, Jerry shared that he met Mary Anne in history class at Gloucester High and have been dating ever since. • Good to hear from Louis Kirouac, another proud Bishop Bradley High School grad. Hoping you and all you hold dear are well.\n\nAnne Morgan O’Connor passed away July 1, 2021, after a long battle with Alzheimer’s. Following graduation from Newton, Anne earned a master’s degree in education and, after raising her three children, got a second master’s degree with a focus in library science. • Ellen Markey Thurmond reminded me that she went to school with Anne from kindergarten through college. Ellen also told me that she had a great mini-reunion luncheon with Mary Ellen McShane Troy, Jayne Murray Peterson, and Peggy Kugler McLaughlin while visiting Alice Hurley Dickinson in Minnesota. • Ellen called to tell me that Kitsy Cavanaugh Fogerty passed away suddenly on August 5. Kitsy had gone to Newton Country Day School with several of our classmates. She spent much of her married life in New Canaan and Darien, Connecticut, raising four children while teaching in elementary school and later holding positions in public relations and marketing for Labatt USA. While at lunch with Tan Cooney Sklut, Maura O’Neill Overlan, Jackie Gegan Mooney, and Anne Gallagher Murphy, they raved about Kitsy being a super athlete. Tan and Jackie remembered her Newton team always beating their Elmhurst team in field hockey. • None of us had seen Tan for years, but she promised to put a Newton luncheon on her calendar for next year’s trip to Rhode Island from California. I hope she can make it for our 60th reunion, June 3–5. It is always so great for us to reconnect. BC does an amazing job for us, so mark your calendars and stay tuned! • Janet Richmond Latour paid a visit back to the Bay State from South Carolina and had lunch with Anne Gallagher Murphy and me. She is happily settled in her new home, playing lots of golf and bridge. • Several of our classmates have recently moved. Beth Graham O’Mara has moved with her husband from Wilton, Connecticut, to an independent/assisted living place in Darien. Beth is an avid reader and is always giving me good suggestions. • In my last note I had said that Cathy Power Schibli and her husband had just moved to Weavertown, New York. However, after visiting friends and family in Switzerland and another daughter in Germany last summer, she’s cleaning out once again, and moving to Germany, where they will settle in Nordhorn. Cathy had met her husband, who is Swiss, while studying in France when she left Newton after sophomore year. They have lived between Switzerland and the States while raising their five children, so this move is not such a big change for them. • When we were freshmen, a couple of “boys” at Holy Cross and a couple of “girls” in our class organized a mixer. We matched people up by interests, height, where they were from, etc., and off to Holy Cross we went on buses. I actually came across that list cleaning out this summer and was reminded that a few marriages resulted from it—I think it may have been a first “match.com!” Dr. Fauci wasn’t on it, as he must have been in the lab or library! • Pat Wolf ’68 thanked me for including the Newton College website 885ncsh.org in my last news notes and said she hoped “alums would e-mail her memories that they would like uploaded in general or for a particular RSCJ.” She has uploaded some of their PhD dissertations, as well. Pull out the class directory we sent you from 2017 and start calling your friends about our 60th Reunion in June! We hope to have a great turnout.\n\nRetired newspaper columnist Joe Gergen P’10, emails from Lido Beach about nostalgia: sharing a third-floor dorm, the fire escape balcony, at “hotbox” St. Joseph’s Hall, with John Casey. Joe extolls John’s remarkable freshman “earned” selection, only underclassman BC team on the “College Bowl” TV quiz show. John’s answering barrage was a golden highlight. He excelled in graduate math at Michigan and Brown University. He was a founding member of the Northeastern University computer science department and a professor for the better part of 40 years. • Joe DuBois passed away December 2019 after bravely facing Parkinson’s and Lewy body dementia effects. Joe was a McLean, Virginia, resident since 1970. He obtained a master’s from BC in 1965, a PhD in mathematics from Lehigh University in 1968. He had a 34-year accomplished career at the U.S. Department of Labor within the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and retired in 2009 as director in the office of statistical analysis. His impressive work wonderfully impacted workers’ safety nationwide. Forever an Eagle. No retirement recluse, world traveler. Left his wife, Joan, daughter Karen DuBois Kelly ’91, son Jim, and four grandchildren. • In Cape Cod last summer, Paul Hardiman; Carol and Jim Norton, P’90; Kay and John Golden; Mary and Bob Uek, P’89, ’90; Brian Sullivan, MA’65, P’87, ’90, ’93, ’01 and Oky Goldman; and Judy and Frank Carney, P’92 gathered. • In February 2020, Bill Murphy retired from a 50-year legal career. He was a partner at Parker Coulter Daley & White, and later Curtin Murphy & O’Reilly P.C. Bill boasts two BC daughters: Dorothy ’89 and Deborah ’97. • Last summer, Ann Marie and Bob Reardon, MA’66, P’91, hosted their annual Martha’s Vineyard four-day weekend. Gathered were George Bourque; Wayne Budd, H’13, P’90; Frank Catapano, P’88; John Pellegrini; Eddie Spain, P’90; Gerry Ward, P’92, ’96, ’98. Bob has beaucoup praise for their deserving spouses. • Bill Haley is teaching electrical theory at Anne Arundel Community College in Arnold, Maryland. • On his 81st birthday, Frank Connolly surrendered his long-running, prodigious part-time vocation: alpine skiing instruction in Telluride, Colorado. He relocated near his dear Jackson, New Hampshire. Given BC’s relative proximity, he hopes to partake in alumni activities. Welcome back, Frank. • In October, Eagles returned to venerable Lewis Grille. On the agenda: pub grub, buzz, old times. Gathered were Frank Carney; John Cuneo; Dick Gould; Bob Grazado; Paul Hardiman; Mike Lydon, MBA ’70; Jim Norton, P ’90; Ed Rae; Bob Uek; Carl Young, JD’66.\n\nThis is the year, ladies! Most of us will turn 80 this year. In the spirit of what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger: celebrate! Call a Newton friend or friends and celebrate together. Celebrate being 80! Celebrate being able to! Say a prayer for those who went before. Viva 80! Viva LXXX! • Marj Dever Shea, Jo Egan Maguire, and Carol Donovan Levis have been putting their heads together for another group outing. The memories of the summer gathering linger: Wouldn’t another lunch be fun as well? Contact them with your ideas. • Meanwhile in Connecticut, Susie Moynihan Spain reports that their lunch group—Carol Singleton Dockery, Carolyn McInerney McGrath, Maureen Lambert Roxe, and Dorothy Daly Voris—plan to meet for lunch this fall at the Waccabuc Club. • Susan McAuliffe Brown posted a lovely series of winter photos of her house and garden on Facebook: beautiful, serene, quiet. They almost made me miss winter. • You may know that Carol Donovan Levis’s grandson, Will Levis, is the starting quarterback for the University of Kentucky. We watched most of his games: so exciting! Football has never been much my thing (I remember my roommate Anne Gallagher Southwood trying to educate me with a chart of Xs and Os, which basically baffled me) but it’s pretty darn exciting watching Carol’s grandson play. • Looking forward to the Naples report this winter: Who will be there? Will they have their annual lunch? More later.\n\nMichael Densmore lives in Punta Gorda, Florida, where he is “enjoying retirement and all that beautiful Southwest Florida has to offer: golf, beaches, softball, etc.” • Ron Martino writes: “All is well with Maureen and I in Newburyport. We are pleased to see one child of one of our three BC-graduated kids now at BC and potentially more looking to apply.” • Bill and Ruth Bennett made an eastern odyssey from their home in Arizona in September ’21. On their trip they were able to catch the football games vs. Colgate and Mizzou, and spend some time in Maine and Cape Cod visiting friends and classmates. • Friends and former students of Bill Collins are currently involved with endowing a scholarship in his name at BC High. If you would like to help push them over the goal, contact the development office at BC High. • John Martini writes, “Our family operates Martini Vineyards in the Finger Lakes region of New York. We use some of the grapes we grow to produce the wines under the Anthony Road Wine Co. label.” • Tom Mulvoy: “I told Sister Eleanor Frances, my seventh-grade teacher, that I wanted to work on a newspaper. Some 66 years later, I’m doing just that. After 35 years at the Boston Globe, from which I retired as managing editor in 2000, and six years running a journalism seminar at the Heights, I took on a new job as a three-day-a-week associate editor with the Dorchester Reporter, a weekly from my boyhood neighborhood. • Stephen Curley sent this note: “John (Jack) T. Shea, my freshman roommate and lifelong best friend, passed away peacefully in December 2020.” • Bill Cormier: “After nearly 30 years leading a large local real estate company, I and a business partner formed Hourihane, Cormier & Associates in 1998 in my hometown of Rochester, New Hampshire. My wife, Cally, and I live on Great Bay and are finally getting back to visiting our children Monique ’90, a corporate General Counsel in Atlanta and Billy ’92, a high-yield bond salesman with JP Morgan in London. • Ann Carty-Thrailkill retired from the Palo Alto VA hospital as a nurse practitioner. She returned to Boston in early May 2021 for the funeral of her younger brother, who died of cancer. Her daughter, who graduated from BC in 1989, lives in Boston and works for Wellington Co. Her son lives in Chicago, and is a chemist and patent attorney for a pharmaceutical company. Ann’s grandson is a Harvard grad who lives in New York and works on Wall Street; her granddaughter is a third-generation BC grad who also works on Wall Street. • Milly and Fred Dunfey have moved from Tucson, Arizona, to Westborough to live at Del Webb Chauncy Lake. “We both have played pickleball all over the country, winning a couple of national tournaments along the way. We moved to be closer to family after nine years in Tucson.” • Jim Spillane is back in Indonesia at the Jesuit university in Yogyakarta, where he has been teaching three courses most semesters: business ethics, professional ethics, and international economics. • The cover of the Summer 2021 edition of Boston College Magazine featured a letter from Arthur Doyle when he was director of admissions for BC. The letter in question welcomes the first woman admitted to A&S. Arthur was also known as the first director to reject an applicant from BC High (which caused great consternation at the Jesuit residence at BC High). • John Moynihan has stepped down from the role of class correspondent, and the Alumni Association thanks him for sharing news on behalf of the class of 1964. Please send any future news to classnotes@bc.edu.\n\nMy big news is the birth of my granddaughter, Eliza Lamb Caviness, on July 2, 2021, to my daughter, Alexis, and her wife, Celeste. Eliza’s sisters are enthralled, which will probably last until Eliza decides to assert herself. So, add in my grandson in California, I now have four grandchildren, ages seven and under. I may be too old for this. • Sue Roy Patten said that since she and Chuck moved to Fort Myers, she has become involved with the Florida Repertory Theatre. Her passionate interest is in the youth program. This year they’re doing Macbeth and Sue is the show sponsor. From Sue: “I had a wonderful Shakespearean education in high school and at Newton and am looking forward to getting involved. I’ll tread carefully and try to dress in a manner the teens will find OK but appropriate to a 79-year-old!” • After receiving her master’s in social work from BC in 1966, Maureen (Reenie) Davis was a high school social worker in Simsbury, Connecticut, for 35 years, retiring in 2011. She now lives in Harwichport, Cape Cod. Her seventh grandchild was born in May 2021 and Reenie said, “Who would have thought at 78 I would be a grandmother again?!” Her granddaughter, Hailey Davis, writes music singles available on YouTube and is also helping create a more sustainable environment. She launched the “Reformation Program” with a Boston retail brand, 1987 Active, focused on recycling past clothing collections. • Katy Withers Higgins and husband, John, live in a life-plan community in Washington, D.C. John is the commissioner of their advisory neighborhood council and the family now refers to him as the “commish.” It’s a nonpolitical, voluntary position that works on issues such as schools, racism, transportation, and affordable housing. Their older son lives and works in Brussels. Their younger son and family live less than a mile from Katy and John. • Thanks to all for getting in touch. After so much isolation, connecting feels wonderful.\n\nKathy Hogan took care of the records of this class in the School of Education. She also attended the Evening College, as did many BC secretaries, and Kathy worked on The Heights. After she left BC, she went back to college at Bridgewater State, found her creativity, graduated with honors, and has never looked back. Kathy loves teaching and ended up teaching ESL to adults for 10 years. She also started the Reverend Maurice V. Dullea, S.J. ’17 Scholarship Fund in 1996 (her uncle was the AD from 1940 to 1957), and this is the 20th year it’s been awarded. This led Kathy to seeing the connection between sports and physics. Her blog is sportscience-kathy.blogspot.com. • After 30 years living in Cape Coral, Florida, David Skehan and his wife, JoAnne, have moved and purchased a new home in Ormond Beach, Florida. David and JoAnne celebrated their 45th wedding anniversary and his semi-retirement after 35 years of leading his company, Skehan & Associates, Inc. 2021 also marked the death of an era with the passing of David’s older brother, Thomas F. Skehan ’54, who lived in York, Penn., had seven children, 40 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren. Tom was 88. David and his two brothers, Tom and John J. Skehan ’51, were the first in their Brighton-based family to attend Boston College. • The South Dakota Historical Society Press has published Warren “Sandy” Barnard’s 17th book, George Armstrong Custer: A Military Life, which is a biography of the Civil War and Indian wars officer. In addition, he and his wife, Betty, celebrated their 55th wedding anniversary in late July. • A special thank-you to Ed Lonergan, who orchestrated the 60th reunion of our class at Matignon High School. It was a great event. Since so many of the Class of ’61 went on to Boston College, we had an enjoyable time renewing both Matignon and Boston College friendships. We remembered our deceased Matignon/BC classmates: Jim Sullivan, Eleanor Thornton Sullivan, and Rosemary Thomas MacKinnon.\n\nHello, Newton friends. I am updating my mailing list, so please take a minute to send your latest email address to me at the below address. • Pat Cecil Bikai transferred in her sophomore year but remembers with fondness her roommates: Rosa Aparicio, Marti Schikel Imbraham, and Chiyoko Aikawah. Pat and her husband, Pierre, visited Japan just before the pandemic and, with Marti’s help, were able to enjoy a wonderful visit with Chiyoko. Upon their return, Pat continued on her archeology projects and recently published a book, Petra: The North Ridge about the extensive excavation at the World Heritage Site. • MaryLou Comerford Murphy enjoyed a family reunion in Hyannis Port, during the summer. Those present included her three grandchildren Andrew, Aidan, and Maggie, who were named for their great-grandparents. • Angie McDonnell Larimer and husband, Tom, moved to a retirement community at the same time that Tom was hospitalized with congestive heart failure. Two weeks later, Angie fell and shattered her shoulder. All is well now. Tom has recovered and Angie has a new shoulder! • Nancy Cuniff Cole is selling her big home that she converted to a B&B. Nancy will miss the fun but not the work. • Your writer enjoyed a busy summer reuniting with friends and family. She spent three weeks in Denver and Kauai with son Mike ’90 and his family in June and July. In August, 23 members of the extended Mason family enjoyed a week in Georgia. • Big news! Save the dates June 3–5 for a long-awaited reunion. Watch your mailbox for details. Please send your email address. Be happy!\n\nBonnie Gorman wrote in, “I have been busy saving the world from COVID by volunteering at a COVID vaccine clinic we set up in Quincy for the Metro Boston area. Also working hard on advocating for a single-payer universal healthcare system here in the U.S. just like the rest of the developed world!” • Sadly, Christopher Mungovan passed away on March 16, 2021. He is survived by his spouse of 49 years, Marilyn Mungovan; their two children, Margo and Reed; his brother, John; and grandchildren. Chris was commissioned an Army lieutenant through the ROTC program at BC. He went on to serve with the 1st Infantry Division (the storied Big Red One) in Vietnam during 1967–1968. • Joseph Meehan added, “Just enjoying general life in High Rise in Fort Lee, New Jersey. My wife and I both hail from New Jersey, Diane from Fort Lee, I’m from Maplewood. We enjoy dining out with friends both new and old and occasional trips to the shore or Poconos. Very proud of my four grandsons. Two started kindergarten in September; Alrik Meehan in Westchester, New York, and James Whalen in Montclair, New Jersey (his mother, Meghan Meehan, is BC 2000!). Glad to see BC football on TV so often this fall. Been in touch with PD, a.k.a. Paul Delaney, in Florida.”\n\nOur class held a wonderful mini-reunion on Zoom in October with 34 classmates in attendance. Many thanks to Sandra Puerini Del Sesto who did a masterful job pulling it all together. We had small discussion groups on meaningful topics, several instant polls (48% attend Catholic Mass regularly and 33% do not attend any church services at all), a report on our fundraising efforts for the Caroline Putnam Fund, and more! Stay tuned for communications on our actual, in-person, 55+1 reunion June 3–5, 2022. Because of COVID delays, this reunion will include members of 60% of the Newton classes. If you had friends in the Classes of 1965 and 1967 you may see them on campus as well! • Several members of our class have a regularly scheduled video call with Martha Roughan, RSCJ, who is living with dementia. If you’d like to brighten Martha’s day with a greeting card, you can send it to her at Teresian House, 200 Washington Avenue Extension, Albany, NY, 12203. • Sandra Puerini Del Sesto reports that she is still working at her craft (part-time). During COVID she was asked to design and deliver many virtual trainings nationally in behavioral health planning and ethics, which she enjoyed doing. She also serves on several state and national boards and is mentoring new people to fill those roles. • Ros Moore and her husband, Michael St. Clair, moved to Lasell Village (an educational retirement community) in Newton this past August. Ros enjoys taking classes, swimming in the pool, and chauffeuring one of her granddaughters on a weekly basis. She also belongs to two book clubs and arranges flowers for the complex. Her younger son, Travis, married his husband during the pandemic in an outdoor ceremony on Long Island, with eight people in attendance. • Condolences are offered to Sheila McIntyre Barry, whose husband, Jim Barry ’66, died on August 8 after a long, courageous battle with Parkinson’s. He held an MBA from Suffolk and a doctorate from Northeastern, and was a popular coach and educator at Cape Cod Community College and later at the U.S. Naval Academy, where he taught leadership and ethics and took their hockey team to two national championship tournaments. Sheila and Jim were married for 54 years and raised five children—three of whom were adopted from Bangladesh, India, and the Dominican Republic, respectively.\n\nPeter Lincoln has been elected chairman of the board of the Liberty Bay Credit Union in Braintree. He also became a grandfather for the first time with the birth of Bodie Samuel Lincoln to Peter’s son, Jonathan, and daughter-in-law, Courtney. • Mark Branon plans to spend this winter in Hawaii with his two youngest granddaughters and their parents, as he was unable to do so last year due to COVID. Mark has eight grandkids in total. • Jerry Levinson, an economics major in CSOM, passed away in September. Jerry had a long battle with multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease. Jerry never let his disabilities define him or slow him down. After many years in San Diego, he and his wife, Dorothy, returned to New Jersey to retire and be near family. The class extends its condolences to Dorothy, his sons Keith, Michael, and Ryan, and to Sasha, his golden retriever. • Richard Moran writes that after leaving BC (A&S chemistry major) and Milton, he went to Buffalo, New York, to pursue a PhD in pharmacology and biochemistry at SUNY Buffalo and Roswell Park Cancer Institute. Then on to Madison, Wisc., for postdoctoral at McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research. Next up was USC as a professor in the department of biochemistry and molecular biology. Richard then came back east to the Massey Cancer Institute in Richmond, Virginia, as associate director for research. He worked at Massey for the next 24 years. He retired in 2015 and moved back to the Boston area, settling in Marshfield. He is the father of four: Tim, Terry, Erin, and Keith, all of whom have advanced degrees in engineering or biology. Richard is married to a lovely lady from Zimbabwe who is also a retired professor of molecular biology and founding member of the field of epigenetics. • Bill “Blake” Murray, who we mentioned in our last column, passed away suddenly in Rye, New York. Blake was an economics major and in a second career, taught in both the U.S. and China. He was Brooklyn-born, an Army veteran, served in Vietnam, and was awarded the Bronze Star. Attending services from the Class of ’67 were Fred Faherty, Mike Ford, Rob Wilde, Bill Kitley, Joe Kiely, Peter Canning, Tom Walsh, Joe Alves, Pat Hogan, Ralph DeSena, Pris Tessier DeSena, Doug Miller, Ken McDonald, Bill Zak, and John Kelleher. The class extends its condolences to Blake’s wife, Maurine, daughters Courtney Storz (Erik)and Brooke Murphy (Charles), and seven grandchildren. • Mike Equi has died. Throughout his lifetime, Mike battled Friedreich’s ataxia, a rare progressive degenerative movement disorder that ultimately robbed him of his mobility and his primary career (dentistry), but never sapped his good humor, intellectual curiosity, or faith. Mike earned his DDS from Columbia and was a Navy veteran. He was predeceased by his beloved Martha so we extend the class’s condolences to his children and family. • Looking forward to our 55th Reunion. Stay tuned!\n\nLife has challenges: Last report in October noted that Mary Lou Hinchey Clemons decided to return to New England from Michigan after 10 years to be closer to family and friends. Now, she reports happily making that transition to senior living in Exeter, New Hampshire, although she misses her son and grandson. • A more challenging report came from Denise Hern Wood, who’s recuperating from a shattered hip suffered last July. Her doctors say it will take a year to heal! • On a sad note, I heard fromMarianne Bracken O’Neil that Randi Slaatten Sack passed away on October 2, 2021, in her hometown of Rye, New York. There’s a great story of her life experiences in her obituary at grahamfuneralhomerye.com. She was ill for close to 10 years but previously had taught for 20 years. She then enjoyed a second home in Boston for another 20 years where she and husband, Joe, did real estate business and cheered on “their” Red Sox. She and Joe had three children and nine grands. • Also, in early October news of the unexpected passing of Arnie Reisman, husband of Paula Lyons, surfaced. Online searching found a wonderful tribute in the Martha’s Vineyard Times extolling his wonderful wit and extensive writing. As a couple they enjoyed traveling frequently and widely. Recent events curbed some of that, much to their dismay. Our condolences to both families. • Unfortunately, I also have to add my own personal sad note. My husband, Bill, passed away in October after many months fighting cancer. He is at peace now after a full life—53 years married to me and two years cruising the Newton campus as a young Naval officer stationed in Boston. Over the years, he traveled through all 50 states and across five continents, courtesy of his Naval career and insurance-business educational responsibilities. (Yes, I have made all 50 states; he made sure.) • For now, just savor your wonderful memories from back at Newton, nearly 55 years ago—many which changed your lives forever. Remember in your thoughts and prayers those whose lives are still being challenged. If you want a walk down memory lane now, try Googling “885ncsh.org”, a website created by Pat Wolf NC’68, with stories about the wonderful ladies who broadened our minds as our teachers and friends. You can share your own memories there, too.\n\nWinter greetings from warm and sunny California. • Bob Alcarez reports that for many years fellow classmates have been meeting monthly for breakfast in Braintree. The group includes Norm Cohen, Richard Smith, John Mullaney, John Mulholland, Phil Piscatore, and John McColgan. • Pradeep Nijhawan and his wife, Deb, have permanently retired to Sun City Center, Florida, after having lived for fifty years in Kokomo, Indiana. They have enjoyed connecting with fellow Eagles who were also members of the BC International Club. • Congratulations to Dr. John Trapani, emeritus professor of philosophy at Walsh College in North Canton, Ohio, who has added to his many laurels in academia by receiving the 2021 Lifetime Achievement Award. He continues his professional trumpet playing in the 17-piece John Trapani Big Band. • Sadly, Bob Kelley reports the tragic loss of his son Bryan Kelley ’01. A proud Eagle alum, young Bryan’s favorite BC memory was the awesome Flutie-to-Phelan TD pass. He could recite verbatim the Dan Davis radio call of the play. May Bryan soar like an Eagle on eagles’ wings. • Several classmates, including Frank Vidmar and Paul Deschenes, reported on the loss of heir friend, Bob Gass. Bob was a remarkable gift to our world, serving the Randolph, community for 40 years as town meeting member and school committee member for 25 years. He coached Little League for over thirty years and founded Randolph Youth Basketball. The Randolph Middle School gymnasium was named in his honor. Both his public and personal life were dedicated to education and youth, particularly as an advocate for those with special needs. Proud Eagles Frank Vidmar and Bob held BC basketball season tickets together for 40 years. Additionally, Bob and his son, Michael ’98, held BC football season tickets. Bob, with his wonderful sense of humor, was known as being compassionate, kind, and caring to all, devoted to his family, friends, and town. Flags in Randolph were flown at half-mast for a week after his passing. On July 28th, more than 200 people gathered for his public memorial. To his beloved wife, Diane; their children Jon, Michael, and Callie; and his grandchildren, we offer our deepest sympathy for this true man for others. • Take care and be kind to yourselves, my friends. Go, Eagles!\n\nKudos to Pat Wolf for developing a Newton College website: 885ncsh.org. Take a look at the impressive job Pat has done on this site, which includes yearbooks and issues of the school newspaper, among other items. • Barry Noone Remley writes, “Life is good—wonderful, especially now that we can spend time maskless with all the people we love.” • Barry and Jeannie Sullivan celebrated their March birthdays with a visit at Ellen Mooney Mello’s Vero Beach home and then returned the favor while hosting and celebrating Ellen’s June birthday on the Cape. Barry divides her time between a home in Silver Springs, Maryland, and a newly constructed cottage 75 miles outside of D.C. on a property on the Shenandoah River. Barry moved her award-winning architectural furnishings company, Salvations, to the new location and is lucky to have her son as a neighbor. In addition to owning her own company, Barry finds time to play an excellent game of tennis and do unique sketches of the places she visits. She credits her very neat penmanship to a calligraphy class she took senior year at Newton taught by none other than fellow classmate Jeanne Daley. • Jeannie Sullivan is in the process of building a new home in Rhode Island. She recently took two weeks off from her job as manager of a high-end Newport restaurant to care for Ellen, who had open heart surgery in late September. Ellen is back in her Greenwich home recuperating and very grateful for all that Jeannie did to help her on the road to recovery. • Carol Duane Olson and her husband, Bob, recently had a 200-years celebration—50 years of marriage plus 75.5 and 74.5 years of age. The festivities at their Snowmass Village, Colorado, home included many family and friends. In the six-degrees-of-separation category, it should be noted that back in the 1980s, Carol was the above-mentioned Ellen’s law professor at Pace University. May you all be in good health and able to share and celebrate these special days with those near and dear to you.\n\nJim Malone and wife Alice were blessed to have spent their 32nd consecutive summer on Nantucket in 2021. This summer was highlighted by Jim’s 9th hole-in-one in June, and their daughter Katie’s marriage to James Gallen on October 9. The Malones returned to their home in Charlottesville in late October. • Neil Maher reported that as a chemistry major at BC, it took decades for him to appreciate the literature, philosophy, and history courses that were part of the A&S curriculum. After much stalling, Neil has now enrolled in a humanities program at Hood College. His first couple of courses brought him back to Massachusetts, looking at what led to the Salem Witch Trials and also to an examination of the cultures of some of the world’s great cities. • Rick Carroll reported that on October 2, 2021, he and classmates Bob Budic, Pat Daly, Kathy Daly, Kevin McGuire, Roger Mooney, Bart Nichols, Bill O’Dowd, and Henry Stamm attended a memorial service for their good friend Gene Buehler, a former trustee of the University. The service, organized by Gene’s wife, Deborah, was held at the Harrington Athletics Village at Boston College. • Mike Morrissey indicated that he is not ready for retirement yet as he is having too much fun to stop now. Mike recently accepted the position of chairman of the board of Protective Life, a Fortune 500 provider of life insurance and annuities. • I hope all of you are doing well. Please take the time to write/email me and let me know what is new with you.\n\nKathy O’Connell Peterson, a fellow Ohioan, wrote that like me she’s been on Zoom every Monday night with some of our classmates since spring 2020. She connects with Kathie McCarthy, Martha Verrier McCarthy, Kathy Bednarz McLoughlin, Jess Twaddle Packard, Marge McGah Scanlon, Alicia Silva Ritchie, Joanne Pozzo (who left after sophomore year), and sometimes Laurie Bryan! This camaraderie started freshman year in Stuart. There would be a mutiny if they didn’t meet every Monday! • Alicia Silva Ritchie reiterated the magic of Monday Zooms. She has ventured with family to their cabin in Minnesota, to San Diego to see friends, and to Denver to see grandchildren. She and Daniel have moved to an apartment with no stairs or gardens in a new neighborhood ready for exploration. • Teddy Thompson Helfrich sat down with a glass of Prosecco to read the BC Magazine and decided to write. After 43 years as a Spanish teacher/foreign language department chair at Brockton High School and an adjunct community college professor, she has retired. Remote learning convinced her. Sadly, her husband passed away seven years ago. She has three stepsons, a foster daughter, six grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren. Teddy lives in Hingham, and periodically sees Kathy O’Neill Jodka and Sheila Carroll Curtis. • As a retired pharmaceutical scientist, Dene Davis Ryan reports how proud she is of the people in her industry and how remarkable the accomplishments in vaccine development are! She was fortunate to spend time with family at her Jersey Shore home and hopes to get out and enjoy the world again and rebook trips to San Diego, a French river cruise, and a 50th wedding anniversary celebration in Florida. • When Pat East Allison comes from Houston to her Cape Cod home, she and Julie Lombardy Goulet and their husbands connect. Patt Smith Peterson and Chip visited the Goulets in Narragansett. All three couples met up for a dinner in Newport. Julie is looking forward to celebrating her 74th birthday with Judy Miller Cummins NC’70. They both celebrated their mutual 21st birthdays together! • Noreen Weaver Shawcross is heading to Bonita Springs, Florida, for most of the winter. She hopes to connect with Beth Cangemi Heller and Bea Cerrito Goldstein. She marvels how so many of us have stayed connected! • Ana Perez Camayd went to Maryland in January 2020 for the birth of grand-twins and stayed through the lockdown with her sweet “quaranteam.” Luckily, Zoom allowed her stay in touch with her boards: the Clipper Foundation (housing, youth, and foster care), Muñiz Academy (dual-language high school she helped found), and Conexion (mid-career leadership and mentoring). • Pat Connolly Henry drove from Delaware with a dear friend, who is challenged with cancer, to Vermont, so the friend could see her old neighbors, a group of very vibrant seniors! Aren’t we all? • Jill Hendrickson Daly has been to New Hampshire, New Jersey, and New York to see family. • Pam DeLeo Delaney, Polly Glynn Kerrigan, and Bebee Carroll Linder all met up on Block Island. • Sue Davies Maurer visited the San Juan Islands. • Kathy Hartnagle Halayko has been to Hilton Head. • Susan Power Gallagher has a new granddaughter, Isabel “Izzy” Mary. • Paula Fisher Paterson has been to Jackson Hole, Nashville, and Chicago to visit sons. She has a new grandson, Matthew Alexander. He and his siblings and parents have moved to Russia for a while to be close to his mom’s family. • If you want to get away, check out “relaxing getaway St. Croix” on Airbnb. Winnie Loving would love to host someone from Newton. • A big thanks to all who wrote. As you see from my message above, Kathie McCarthy Zoomed every Monday night with her group of friends. I sadly tell you that she passed away from leukemia, having only been diagnosed two months before.\n\nCongratulations to Andrea Moore Johnson, Brookline Commission for Women’s annual Woman of the Year! Andrea was honored for her work as co-founder and advisor to Women Thriving. This impressive nonprofit co-creates learning and leadership opportunities for women facing economic, social, and racial inequities. • Rita Houlihan, who sat in a fully vaccinated theater for the first time since early 2020, reports: “NYC Broadway and Off-Broadway shows are back! Just being there, seeing the marquee, the playbill, people waiting at the stage door, was a thrill. There’s nothing like live theater. I’m so grateful for the scientists whose research made COVID vaccines possible! By the way, the ‘turn off your cellphones’ announcement is now ‘Keep masks on at all times and turn off your cellphones!’ People were happy to be there and happy to comply!” • Kathy Sheehan observes: “Emerging from the COVID emergency is almost as confusing as going into it. Now we think going to the movies is brave. I decided the safest place to go is a nail salon; they were cleaning everything long before COVID. Live theatres here require proof of vaccination and a mask. When you purchase coffee, you can remove your mask only while sipping. Lesson learned: pulling the mask down, not up, is the most efficient way to do this. Our building’s chief engineer gave a tour explaining how reverse osmosis filters remove minerals, purifying our drinking water. A resident asked if this water was safe for plants. Plants have clearly taken on a new importance to us! I’ve only left Virginia twice—to go to New Jersey. New Jersey is the new Italy!” • Annie Impink Hall, who lost her sister, Mimi (and two years earlier, her brother, Ed), to metastatic melanoma, writes: “Never miss an opportunity to lather sunscreen on yourself or your loved ones! Gathering for my sister’s funeral in the midst of COVID strengthened my resolve to live every day filled with the confidence that God’s grace is with us. I’m blessed—my two daughters and five grandchildren live nearby, so we maintained a family pod during the height of the pandemic. Being with them, and watching my grandchildren’s resilience, made navigating COVID’s troubling waters a bit easier. Blessings and good health to all! Are we really 73 years old?!”\n\nOctober 14, 2021, was a gorgeous day with a lingering summertime feel for our group of twenty NCSH ’71 graduates to celebrate 50 years since we had left our Newton Campus. JoAnne Kennedy was our gracious hostess at her New Canaan, Connecticut, home, welcoming folks from the Northeast with a few others sprinkled in. Blue hydrangea centerpieces and burgundy tablecloths were a reminder of our school colors (thanks to Mary Jo Dolliver Taddie’s keen long-term memory), along with the ribbons decorating the silver compacts engraved with “NCSH ’71”, which everyone received as a memento of the special occasion. A delicious catered buffet luncheon followed an hour-and-a-half-long chat session, where the stories never ended, and everyone mingled freely, reminiscing about college life, Filene’s Basement, Tony’s Pizza, Villager and John Meyer clothing, apartments and roommates, meeting husbands, starting careers, raising children, traveling...the list goes on. I circulated taking notes, attempting to have something to write about each person. We are all active in so many ways. • Christine Moran keeps busy with strength training, attending concerts at Madison Square Garden, and taking trips that include snorkeling with Alice the whale shark. • Priscilla Cosgrove has been happily retired from a career in insurance for six-and-a-half years. • Beth Cooney Maher has retired from her nonprofit position, is enjoying time with her grandchildren, and looking forward to traveling more. • Jean McVoy stays active at the Outer Banks and just had a nice reunion on Martha’s Vineyard with her sister (NCSH ’68) and family. • Sharon Zailkas Lena is a semi-retired nurse and the proud mother of two active Army colonels: Rich, a brigade commander at Ft. Rucker, Alabama, and Chris, an orthopedic surgeon at Walter Reed. She also has two wonderful daughters-in-law and three beautiful granddaughters. • Marie Robey Wood is also semi-retired. She continues to write for Potomac Lifestyle, participates in three book clubs and Capital Speakers Club, and loves spending time with her two grandchildren. • After beginning her professional life teaching philosophy, Mary Nelson found her niche in the IT field. She’s now happily retired and living in NYC. • Delly Markey Beekman is the mother of four children, a retired CEO of a nonprofit, and a traveler, who especially enjoys the Dolomites in Italy. • Jane Hudson splits her time between Old Saybrook, Conn., and St. Petersburg, Florida, where she is a docent at the St. Petersburg Museum of History. • Jane Maguire is a retired attorney, enjoying traveling the globe. • Another retiree is Kathy Morrison McShane, who is enjoying her six grandchildren and hoping to resume travel soon. • Jane Cavanaugh has retired from a career in social work and is active with her local school board in Deep River, Conn. To be continued next time.\n\nPlease plan now to attend our 50th Reunion next year. • Mary McShane retired four years ago from working for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. She discovered and fell in love with the Irish language in 1980. Mary is teaching Irish-language with Cumann na Gaeilge. COVID-19 prevented her annual summer trip to Galway, where she takes Irish– language classes in Connemara. The greater Boston area is still her home, but she does get down to New York City occasionally to visit her family. • Thanks to Marilyn “Penny” Price Nachtman, we have news from Agnes Acuff Hunsicker ’71. Agnes made the Boston area her permanent home many years ago. Her last professional job was with MIT. She retired sooner than she had planned, in 2014, to care for her mother. Agnes has three children and seven grandchildren, all of them living in New England. The oldest grandchild is 28 and the youngest is 4. • Lisa Kirby Greissing, Margot Dineen Wilson, and I had dinner to celebrate the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in the greater Washington, D.C., area. Lisa has this update: “My newest grandson, the third child of my son Michael and his wife, Maria, was born on March 5, 2021. His name is Anthony for Maria’s father. My granddaughter Maggie just finished eighth grade at Stone Ridge School of the Sacred Heart and will stay for high school. She is the daughter of my oldest son, Jay!” Margot, a broker with Washington Fine Properties, is very busy with our sizzling realty market. • For Mary-Catherine Deibel, the suggestion from Mary Sullivan Tracy to have Zoom calls with classmates during the pandemic mitigated their pandemic isolation and blues. As the director of development at the Cambridge Center for Adult Education, Mary-Catherine worked to raise money throughout the pandemic and financial crisis. For a narrative about her longstanding friendship with David Waters, CEO of Community Servings (a nonprofit that provides medically tailored, nutritious, scratch-made meals to chronically and critically ill individuals and their families in Massachusetts), visit the Archive StoryCorps website. Mary-Catherine and her business partner at Upstairs at the Pudding helped form Community Servings and its events in its early days. She has been on the board of Community Savings for many years. Before I say anymore, please listen to the podcast. • My mailbox has plenty of room for news. Enjoy the fall.\n\nBob Miecuna recently retired from the historic Yonkers Raceway Track at Empire City Casino after a 35-year career as the official race secretary at the track. Congratulations to Bob as he enters his retirement and celebrates his remarkable career! • Edwin “Ned” Moore wrote with some life updates: “Connecticut Yankee through and through. Live at the shore of Long Island Sound. I was shamed into lots of healthy activities, long walks along the water, biking, and golf (someday I will master the game). Happily married to Donna for nearly 45 years. We are the proud parents of three wonderful children, all BC grads and spread out around the country. We have eight grandchildren, one a hockey fanatic who we see at BC, and one who is crazy about football and may give the Eagles a look if Nick Saban doesn’t find him first. Easy, guys, they are only 10 years old. Good luck to the Eagles, and thanks for everything.” • Michael O’Keefe added, “In answer to the question posed, I did not change jobs. In fact, at the end of this term, I will have been in my office for 40 years. Twenty years as an assistant district attorney, and 20 years as the district attorney of the Cape and Islands. It’s been a great ride. All the best to the Class of ’73.” • Norene Buczynski Freeman is very happy to announce that her first children’s book, Do You Know How Wonderful You Are?, is now for sale on Amazon. After her first grandchild was born, she was inspired to write the 38-page rhyming and lushly illustrated book to celebrate the goodness and precious qualities all children possess. Norene believes that every child is holy and needs to know it. She hopes this book helps kids from all backgrounds realize that “no matter what bad may have happened to you or what bad you might have done, too, there is a light inside that no one can harm, no matter their might!”\n\nHi everyone. Mimi and I heard from Alice Bene Kociemba this summer. She was excited to share the news of a poetry anthology that she co-edited, From the Farther Shore: Discovering Cape Cod and the Islands through Poetry, released by Bass River Press. The collection of 118 poems travels throughout the Cape, Elizabeth Island, Martha’s Vineyard, and Nantucket, focusing on famous landmarks and people, traditional industries, and the natural beauty, all of which have made the region a world-renowned destination. The poets range from the well-known and established to those who are just starting in their promising careers. “Many of my classmates have fond memories of the Cape and Islands, and the book is a way to savor those experiences again.” The book is available at independent bookstores that can order it online or through the Cultural Center of Cape Cod’s Bass River Press. • Kate Novak Vick reported that during the fall, she and classmates Anne Rafferty Crowley, Kathie Sullivan Murray, Joan Stuckey Mitchell, Liz Regan, as well as Susan Badwey NC’74 met at Joan and Tom Mitchell’s house on Deep Creek Lake in western Maryland. The group tries to rendezvous once a year; however, COVID-19 kept them apart in 2020 so this visit was especially wonderful. Aside from seeing good friends and enjoying amazing food and drinks provided by the hosts, they made a visit to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Fallingwater and some of his other designs in western Pennsylvania. • Rosemary Murphy Kitts related that she and her husband, Stephen, are living happily in Yardley, Penn. Their children are all grown and married. Emilie (a BC graduate) lives outside Denver with her husband and two little boys. Kathryn and her husband are now living in The Hague and relish their travels throughout Europe. Elizabeth and her husband just welcomed their first child in September. Her son, his wife, and their two daughters live in Brooklyn, where they enjoy a busy life. • Mimi Reiley Vilord celebrated her 70th birthday with her husband, Randy, in Hawaii. They visited Oahu and Maui and had a fabulous time. Their youngest daughter is expecting her third child, making this their 15th grandchild! Does she win the prize? • Ken ’71 and I celebrated the marriage of our third daughter at the end of May. It was a wonderful outdoor (COVID-safe) wedding! Our entire family was able to take a vacation this summer on Long Beach Island, New Jersey, for the last week of August. • Email us anytime with news and we can post it in the next magazine. Take good care.\n\nThanks to all who took time to send updates. I wish everyone a happy and healthy new year! • I received a great note from Diane George, who is the twirling coach at Villanova. Many of us still appreciate how much the band and the twirlers added to the great atmosphere and fun of the football games. Diane was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when we were sophomores, and in October she was recognized by the Joslin Diabetes Center for her exemplary managing of the disease over these 50 years, through diet, exercise, and use of insulin.

What a great tradition. • More grandbaby news: Ed and Paula Fraser Donnelly have a new granddaughter, and Jim and I hope she will be able to play with our new granddaughter (baby number seven) at the beach next summer! Please stay well.\n\nGreetings, friends! A heartfelt thank-you to the BC Alumni Association for planning a memorable 45th reunion filled with overflowing laughter and excitement. Our Reunion, in combination with other classes, began Friday evening under the tent adjacent to the McMullen Museum. The venue was ideal for reconnecting and reminiscing on treasured memories of our years at the Heights. Classmates enjoyed scrumptious food, a fabulous dessert bar, dancing to fine music, watching past ’75 videos and photos, and the sheer joy of being together. All of us attended at least one event during the October 15th weekend: Amaza Reid, Catherine Lind Finstein, Dennis Orr, Donna Matteodo, Dorothy Di Pesa, Frank Mastrocola, Gerard Kells, yours truly, Janet Horrigan, Jayne Mehne, Kathie Cantwell McCarthy, Kathleen Bannon Magee, Kevin Conway, Marc Melikian, Mark Riley, Michael Markey, Nancy McCleary, Paul Conroy, Paul Finstein, Richard Rigazio, Shawn Sheehy, Susan Murphy, Thomas Cannon, Thomas Kniffen, Vincent Quealy, William Fallon, and Steve Carroll. • Vinnie Quealy attended the Reunion events and enjoyed catching up with many longtime friends, was delighted to serve on our class Reunion gift committee, and always glad to find ways to remain connected to BC. The generosity of classmates continuing to support BC over the course of an especially challenging Reunion year was gratifying for him. Most recently, Vinnie has been active with the Boston College Ireland Business Council (BCIBC). The role of the BCIBC is to connect Boston-area business leaders and Irish business leaders to promote business expansion and investment between the two communities. • It was a pleasure for me to meet and chat with Gerard Kells and his wife, Kimberly ’76. They enjoyed Reunion weekend with close friends, Kevin and Beth Worgul (both ’76), Kevin Conway, and Mike Markey and his wife, Marie. Gerry was amazed at the many changes that have taken place on campus and seeing many of the beautiful new buildings. They all laughed at the fact that some of the Mods are still there! • Jack Zarkauskas graduated in ’75 with a BS in accounting and MBA in ’87. He worked for 40 years in financial services in Boston and retired from State Street as a risk manager in 2016.

She will serve on the program, finance and facilities, strategic planning, community advisory, and the compliance NECHE committees. • I look forward to hearing from you and want to extend my best wishes for a happy, healthy, and blessed 2022.\n\nSo happy to usher in 2022 with a wonderful update from Deborah Melino-Wender. “2020 was an incredible year: retirement, leaving our beloved Newport, Rhode Island, and family and friends for a cross-country move to San Diego at the height of the pandemic, our first grandchild (Aaron, now 18 months), and so much more! We are thrilled to be so much closer to our kids and their families.” Daughter, Tori, and her husband, Anthony, live in L.A., close enough for frequent visits. Taylor and wife, Kim, and little Aaron live across the street in downtown San Diego, and they take care of Aaron two days a week. Alex and wife, Olga, live nearby in the South Park neighborhood, too! “We laugh that we’ve spent more time with them in the last year than in the previous 10! We have been each other’s ‘pod’ during the pandemic. So very grateful!” They are settling in and embracing all that California has to offer: dog beaches, wonderful farmers markets with year-round fresh produce, and the beautiful weather, with road trips to Big Sur, Santa Barbara, Palm Springs, and Joshua Tree. As Deb said, “The changes in landscape here are incredible and the desert is beautiful!” She is also reconnecting with some old activities, getting back into teaching yoga and starting to play the violin again. “I wish I could hand out earplugs to my neighbors!” They try to stay physically active and hope that their recent good health continues. She’s looking forward to more new adventures and would love to hear from any Newton Dollies who may come out her way! • Helen Fox-O’Brien and husband Dana are great and staying healthy in Connecticut. They had the pleasure of hosting their NYC COVID-refugee daughter and her then boyfriend, now husband, for 15 months! They were married on a beautiful day in September and ended up relocating down the street in Riverside. “We are thrilled and blessed!” Like many, Helen has been working from home but getting ready to go back into the office this February. Two recent “escape from Zoom prison” trips to Boston were a welcome change of scenery. She hopes to celebrate with many of us at our upcoming Reunion, June 3–5! Thanks for all your news and continuing to stay in touch.\n\nOur Reunion year (45th!) came in very trying times, with predictable adverse effects. Many classmates will return at their leisure given the tenor of the times. Change is in the air, as always on the Heights. The Flynn RecPlex is gone and there is a needed Fish Field House to augment athletics. The women’s lacrosse team is the reigning national champion! What a great achievement! Saturday, September 11 was the 20th anniversary of the murderous terrorist attacks on our nation and way of life. It was moving to see it remembered at football games across the land, and right to recall that it took two of our classmates’ lives. Danielle Delie was remembered by many, and her plaque at the campus Labyrinth Memorial was visited for thoughts and prayers. On Long Island, New York, a memorial service for Eddie Papa was hosted by his widow, Patti, and their four daughters, celebrating all facets of Eddie’s too-short life. One could hear the music across the miles, and see Ed’s radiant smile once again. • The aging process has affected many of us, so take a moment and spare a prayer for those in need. This writer greatly appreciated the company of Kathy Murphy, Beth Hurley, and Pola (Papetti) Buckley in such a time of need! Congratulations to all our retirees and those who have become grandparents! Amazing! • Dr. Walter and Pat O’Hara Rok celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary last June after renewing their vows in Cana, Israel. Pat served as a nurse at Seekonk High School for many years and retired last summer. Dr. Walt is still a pediatrician in Fall River, with an emphasis on medical management. Fun time is spent on their motorboat and with their first grandchild in the D.C. area. Walt and Pat volunteered for the Moderna COVID vaccine trial in autumn 2020. Walt and Pat continue to “Rok” on in Barrington, Rhode Island. • Wishing all a healthy and happy winter and spring and deliverance from these trying times. God bless.\n\nChristine K. Barrett’s first granddaughter, Audrey Root, who was reluctant to enter this world, was born to her eldest daughter, Antonia, who was so sick that the family didn’t even say the word “baby” until she was seven months pregnant. When Audrey was born, they didn’t know her gender until one hour after the birth! Very funny! Christine’s son, James, married Bronte Butler, at the Las Vegas Springs Preserve in December 2019. James is a top-20 recruiter for Total Quality Logistics (supply chain trucking nationally), and Bronte is with the City of Las Vegas, collecting traffic fines. Christine’s younger daughter, Nora, after five years in Las Vegas, is progressing from EMT to a nationally licensed paramedic. She completed a year working for both Vanderbilt Medical Center and now Sumner County as a first responder/paramedic. Christine and her husband, Bill, continue in semi-retirement; she administering the state high school equivalency exams, and Bill’s working as a golf marshal. She gives a shout-out to her classmates for our 45th reunion coming soon. • Eileen Moran read Lou Chrostowski’s update in the prior edition of the BC Magazine, prompting her and Mark Fortunato to visit Lou while on vacation in South County, Rhode Island.

Marybeth (Tallarida) Machesney, whose husband, Michael Machesney ’77, with whom I worked at the Eagle’s Nest, said that’s also where she met him, and the rest is history; they celebrated their 43rd wedding anniversary in 2021. Between jobs and grad school (Texas A&M for Michael), they’ve lived in five different states. Moving was hard, she wrote, but it provided a way to see parts of the country and how others lived that they never would have experienced if not for the moves. Their three grown children live in New York City, Austin, and outside Madison, Wisc. Marybeth and Michael live north of Milwaukee, not far from their youngest who lives with her husband and their first grandchild, Beckett. Marybeth said a true silver lining to COVID was getting to see all three of her adult children for most of the pandemic. • Kathleen Norris is enjoying life as emeritus professor of educational leadership while still teaching doctoral-level research methods and dissertation courses at Plymouth State University and master-level leadership courses at Granite State College in New Hampshire.

The following is what he sent to several of his New Jersey classmates: “I wanted to talk about this friendship we have all had for the last 45 years. It is a beautiful thing and I think we sometimes take it for granted. What we have I am told happens rarely, that 25-plus college friends stay so close over the years sharing good times and rough times. For myself, I feel blessed to be part of the group, never more than this past week. Unless you have been in a similar situation as me, you cannot imagine how all the kind words gave me strength and resolve, and increased my determination to get better. I will add one last thought: After talking to Fr. Keenan, I think the friendships we have are centered around love; we all love each other.” Indeed!\n\nDoug Miller retired after three decades as a trial attorney with two large Chicago law firms.

Friday, October 15, a group of ’86 Eagles joined alumni from the Classes of ’85, ’90, and ’91 in a heated tent on Lower Campus and we just dominated the event with dancing, laughing, toasting, and reminiscing about our glory days! There were two photo booths that captured the reunion memories of BC forever friends whether freshmen floormates, Mod roommates, athletes, class couples, friends. The message was consistent—everyone has amazing friendships of 39 years that will last forever. It was awesome to hear how many groups were freshman floormates; from Cushing, Keyes (North and South), Hardey, Duchesne (East and West), Upper, Lower, and off campus were all represented. If you think back to 1982, you made one of your best life decisions to attend Boston College and become a graduate of the Class of 1986 and with primitive computers, no cellphones, no internet, a five-hour drop-add line, paper housing questionnaires. No matter where you were placed you found your forever friends!
