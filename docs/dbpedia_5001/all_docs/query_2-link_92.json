        "text": "For nearly twenty years, Jay Leno had been a puzzle to those who view comedy in the Freudian context, as rage dressed in a smile. His act was clean, his work ethic was puritan, his offstage life was without spectacle, and, in defiance of the nasty-comic cliché, he himself was famously nice. Leno willingly signed autographs and chatted with strangers in airports—an opportunity that presented itself often in a road schedule of some two hundred dates a year. His peers called him “the hardest-working comedian in show business,” which wasn’t the same as the “funniest comedian in show business,” but when he was chosen to succeed Johnny Carson as the host of the “Tonight Show,” last spring, after a six-year apprenticeship, even those who thought Leno didn’t merit the job on sheer talent believed that, somehow, he deserved it.\n\nOn the night of Sunday, September 20th, four months after he ascended to the most celebrated post in late-night television, Leno was visited at home by two NBC executives. They told him that the network had decided to fire the executive producer of the “Tonight Show,” Helen Gorman Kushnick, who was his longtime friend and manager and who had, at his insistence, accompanied him to the show. They presented him with a choice: he could leave with her or he could keep his job, without her. Leno balked. Kushnick had been his manager for seventeen years, guiding his career with bird-dog concentration toward the prize that they had finally won. He felt that the victory was as much hers as his. What he considered loyalty, however, the NBC executives suggested was in fact “an addiction.” Borrowing the language used to prod drug and alcohol addicts into treatment, Warren Littlefield, the president of NBC Entertainment, told Leno, “This is an intervention.” He cautioned Leno that he must free himself from Kushnick before she destroyed his career.\n\nEven by Hollywood’s standards, it was an unusual drama. In the space of four months, the genial Leno’s “Tonight Show” had become the source of so many intrigues and power plays, and of such unease inside the network, and antipathy outside, that NBC executives were beginning to see it as the locus of the many anxieties plaguing them. Helen Kushnick was by no means the first producer of a television show to annoy network bosses, but then this fall has been a very edgy time at NBC. When the General Electric Company bought the network, six years ago, NBC was at its crest—not only hugely profitable but admired by TV critics and by Wall Street. Since then, its respected chairman, Grant Tinker, has left; its respected head programmer, Brandon Tartikoff, has left; and NBC has plunged from first in the ratings to last. Rumors that G.E. means to unload NBC are so persistent as to have acquired in industry chatter the tenor of a fait accompli—the only remaining question being who the buyer will be. Barry Diller, the former chairman of Twentieth Century Fox; Martin S. Davis, the president of Paramount Communications; and, most recently, Bill Cosby have been mentioned as suitors.\n\nUnder Johnny Carson, the “Tonight Show” was a safe, reliably profitable corner of the day for the network. When he departed, a risk had to be taken on “Tonight” for the first time in thirty years. Although NBC went to great expense and effort to make the Carson-to-Leno transition seem like a seamless evolution, it was accompanied by much uncertainty. At issue was not only the new host’s force of personality but also his ability to preserve “Tonight” ’s hegemony on the celebrity circuit. For the men who ran the network, a seemingly trivial disagreement over booking guests was about to become a matter of dire consequence.\n\nCarson had been the undisputed leader of the late-night pack; a call from “Tonight” virtually assured that a guest would decline other offers. But with Carson gone the competition—particularly from “The Arsenio Hall Show”—intensified. Kushnick decided to clarify “Tonight” ’s position: she imposed a rigid policy of exclusivity, which in essence demanded that Leno’s guests forgo any other offers—including future ones. If they chose to appear on a competitor’s show, they would not be welcome on “Tonight.” It was a rule viewed by many in Hollywood as an instrument of vendetta. Although there had been booking pressures exerted by Carson’s staff over the years, these had stayed out of the papers. Kushnick’s behind-the-scenes capers were quickly becoming an embarrassment. The subtext of the ensuing conflict, made increasingly plain to NBC executives in their meetings and conversations with agents and managers, was that the animosity generated by Kushnick’s embargo would inevitably spill over into other areas of NBC interest, such as an effort to lure new artists to its prime-time-program schedule.\n\nThat a booking controversy would become such a high priority for NBC’s top management reflects the immensity of the stakes. The “Tonight Show” is the centerpiece of NBC’s late-night franchise, a block of programs that includes “Tonight,” “Late Night with David Letterman,” and “Later with Bob Costas.” The late-night broadcast marketplace as a whole—including other network shows, such as ABC’s “Nightline,” and nationally syndicated programs, such as “The Arsenio Hall Show”—is expected by industry analysts to generate about six hundred million dollars in advertising revenues this year. NBC’s share will be disproportionately high—about two hundred and seventy million dollars—because its late-night programs attract the biggest audience. That money stream is even more cherished in a year such as this, when analysts expect the network to show a loss of about twenty-five million dollars. That is why, when Littlefield and John J. Agoglia, the executive in charge of NBC Productions, were trying to solve the “Tonight Show” problems, they were inclined to use urgent language; on one occasion, Littlefield likened the show to the Titanic veering toward an iceberg. In Kushnick, Littlefield and Agoglia saw an intense, combative woman who had never quite revved down from the long campaign to win the “Tonight Show” and was now directing her considerable energies toward destabilizing an already tenuous situation. They were willing to pay Kushnick the more than half a million dollars remaining of her nearly one-million-dollar salary if she would leave, but no one thought it would be that easy.\n\nThe connection between Leno and Kushnick was based on more than friendship: Kushnick looked after Jay Leno. He was everybody’s picture of a nice guy; she, on the other hand, has said of herself, “I’ve never been anybody’s favorite person.” On his climb to the top, Leno, a quietly ambitious man, avoided the feuds and jealousies and internal politics of his trade, and was able to do so largely because Kushnick was an eager combatant. “Jay and I have been together a long time, and he doesn’t do this part of it—he doesn’t do the ins and outs,” Kushnick has said. “He’s a very simple person. He’s a nice guy. He doesn’t think ill of anyone. He doesn’t have that kind of mind, to put things together and say, ‘Oh, this one’s doing this and that one’s doing that.’ I, on the other hand, have been in the business for twenty-five years. I totally understand the stuff that goes on.”\n\nAfter Leno was awarded the “Tonight Show,” he explained his philosophy regarding his career: “You go to work, you do the job—write joke, tell joke, get check—and the world will pretty much take care of itself.” Actually, Kushnick took care of the world, and if the price was a pronounced dependence upon her, Leno was willing to pay it. She provided him with near-total insulation from the noisy bother of commerce, channelling his mail, arranging his travel plans, handing him his travel money. Kushnick’s lawyer was Leno’s lawyer, her publicist was his publicist. If Kushnick was tough, as Leno sometimes heard club managers on the road say, that just meant he didn’t have to be.\n\nIt was a rare show-business relationship of trust—they were bound by no contracts—and of loyalty. Kushnick worked every angle to make sure that Leno was always seen at his best. When Tartikoff needed him to serve as co-host of the Emmy show a few years ago, Kushnick knew that Leno, who is slightly dyslexic, would have difficulty reading his lines on a teleprompter, and so she insisted that Leno’s script, instead of being rolled on the prompter, be “flashed”—a full page displayed at a time—to make it easier for him to read. She also demanded that Leno have two of his own writers for the show, so that he would be familiar and comfortable with the material. Once Leno and Kushnick were installed on “Tonight,” he left production matters entirely in her hands, and people who worked with them say that on those occasions when he intruded on her turf she would dismiss him, saying, “Go write your monologue, Jay. I’ll handle this.” “It’s a very strange relationship,” she said recently. “A lot of my relationship with Jay is the things that are unsaid. I just do it.”\n\nThe full extent of the insulation Kushnick built around Leno may be seen in the fact that he seemed only vaguely aware that controversies had been raging around “Tonight” for the past four months, and was genuinely perplexed when he realized how serious the situation had become. “I’ve been serving you steak dinners for the last eighteen years,” Kushnick explained to him then. “I just haven’t bothered showing you how I slaughtered the cow.”\n\nOn Thursday, September 17th, Littlefield and Agoglia telephoned Robert C. Wright, the president and chief executive officer of NBC, who was vacationing on Nantucket. They told him of their decision to fire Kushnick, and he asked what Leno’s response would be. Littlefield said the betting was even odds among the Burbank brass that Leno would walk out, and added, “My feeling is that Jay Leno will have incredible separation anxiety, but he will probably stay with the show.” Wright endorsed their decision.\n\nKushnick probably did not aid her cause when, the next morning, she was interviewed at length on Howard Stern’s nationally syndicated radio program. Her theory about the “Tonight” wars was that she had been “set up” by an alliance of powerful but insecure men. “I mean, that’s really what this is about,” Kushnick told Stern. “These guys have been operating for years, and they hate that a woman is in charge.”\n\nMeanwhile, Littlefield and Agoglia had decided not to pull the trigger right away. On Friday afternoon, Agoglia sent Kushnick a letter outlining several conditions of employment for the executive producer of the “Tonight Show.” Kushnick was forbidden to talk to the media without an NBC representative present, and she was forbidden to book guests and then cancel them, as she had done recently. The network may have been hoping that Kushnick would immediately break one of these rules, thereby allowing NBC to fire her “with cause.” (NBC would also save itself the remaining salary that it would owe her if she was fired outright.) Surprisingly, on Friday evening, Kushnick agreed to the restrictions. At the same time, rumors and what seemed to be veiled threats of a pending sex-discrimination lawsuit against NBC began to filter out of her office.\n\nLittlefield met twice with Leno on Friday. The first time, he called Leno into his office and told him that Kushnick was out of control and something had to be done. “The show’s doing O.K., right?” Leno asked. Littlefield said the show was “doing well—not spectacular, but well,” and then warned, “The town is going to rise up and choke you. They are rooting for you to fail, because of the hatred. It’s not just competitive—it’s their hatred for Helen Kushnick.”\n\nAt the second meeting, Kushnick was there, too. Again Littlefield issued his warning, and Leno observed, “You know, when they put John Sununu out of the White House it fell apart.” Kushnick defended herself, but, according to people at NBC, she soon lost her temper and stormed out of Littlefield’s office shouting expletives—though not before using the moment to point out heatedly to Littlefield that his own job was in danger and to name the various candidates vying to replace him. (“So, I shouldn’t be a diplomat,” Kushnick says of that exchange.) In a way, the disruption served Littlefield’s purpose. He turned to Leno and, sounding the theme of the Kushnick ouster, said, “If you love her, get her out of here. She can’t withstand it. She’s gone. She needs help.”\n\nLeno spent much of that weekend on the phone, with Kushnick; with their lawyer, Ronald Berg; and with a number of people who, reiterating what Littlefield had said, tried to convince him that “Helen needs help.” At one point, Leno asked Littlefield what would happen if he walked out with her, and Littlefield took a gamble: he said he hoped that Leno would stay, but that if he left, NBC would replace him with David Letterman.\n\nAt ten o’clock on Monday morning, Kushnick and Berg arrived at Agoglia’s office. Agoglia handed Kushnick a letter of dismissal, and she handed it to Berg, saying, “Jay will not approve this.” She went to the studio, and later Leno appeared in Agoglia’s office with the letter. He said that he did not support NBC’s decision, and left. The rest of the day was strangely routine. Kushnick produced the show, as usual. Afterward, she was handed a letter ordering her off the NBC lot. Agoglia and Littlefield had considered having her escorted away, but the image of uniformed guards hustling a producer from the grounds suggested bad public relations, so they decided to do nothing until she left on her own volition. When she did, the locks on her office doors were changed, and copies of a picture of her were distributed to the NBC guardhouses, like little “Wanted” posters. She did not return.\n\nOn Monday night, Leno issued a statement to the press saying, “I feel NBC’s actions are unwarranted in light of the success of the show to date, and I continue to support Mrs. Kushnick.” But what spoke more loudly was the fact that he came in to work on Tuesday. He attended the noon staff meeting—something he’d rarely done before—and gave a little speech. As two of those in attendance recall it, he told the staff that Kushnick had great ideas and deserved credit for launching the show, but that he’d recently learned how bad things had got, “and I’m sorry for that.” He said he wanted the show to be a fun place to work, and promised that, from then on, it would be.\n\nUnlike Johnny Carson, who employed a comic to warm up the audience before each “Tonight” taping, Leno performs the nightly ritual himself. Wearing his off-camera uniform of jeans, sneakers, and denim shirt, he mixes it up with the audience in a relaxed performance that some people believe often surpasses his on-camera monologues. As Leno was in mid-ritual one night, a week or so after Kushnick’s dismissal, someone in the audience asked, “What’s your best moment since taking over the show?” Leno stopped cold, as if the good moments had been purged from his memory. “What is the best moment?” he said, puzzling. “The best moment . . . best moment . . . Hmm. I’ll have to think about that. Anybody else?”\n\n“Yeah, what’s your worst moment?”\n\n“Oh, that’s easy. Right now!”\n\nThe line got a good laugh, and it rang true. Over the past decade, Leno had seen Kushnick, his protector, endure a series of personal tragedies, and he had vowed to look out for her. In 1983, her three-year-old son, Samuel, died of AIDS. In 1987, she was found to have breast cancer. Two years later, her husband, Jerry, who had been Leno’s co-manager, died of cancer. On his deathbed, Jerry Kushnick had made Leno promise that he would always be there for Helen. In 1990, her cancer recurred, and she underwent a mastectomy; she was still in chemotherapy when she negotiated Leno’s move to the “Tonight Show.” Through it all, Leno told her that he would put his career on hold if necessary, and he has tried to fill in as a surrogate father to Samuel’s twin sister, Sara, now twelve, who calls him Uncle Jay.\n\nBut Kushnick is right: doing battle is not in Leno’s nature. When he was growing up, in Andover, Massachusetts, his father, Angelo, taught him how to make people laugh—a useful trick in his trade, which was selling insurance. Yet Leno felt he was more like his mother, and even then he didn’t understand the games that boys play; he shunned football, because he didn’t want to knock people down. During his many years on the road, he travelled with his wife, Mavis, a writer and amateur astrologer he met in 1976 at the Comedy Store on the Sunset Strip. He often runs his material by Mavis; he does not want to offend.\n\nHelen Gorman, the daughter of an Irish truck driver and an Italian-immigrant housewife who settled in East Harlem, was born to rumble. Bobby Colomby, a senior vice-president at Sony Music, who has known her for many years, says, “I call her a warrior, because she will just obsess on something and just push and push and push.” In 1988, after one particularly arduous negotiating session with Harris Katleman, then the president of Twentieth Century Fox Television, over a client’s TV series, Katleman refused to deal further with her, and summoned an intermediary to sew up the deal. An acquaintance of Kushnick’s says that she is the kind of person who will spend a vacation in Hawaii arguing with other vacationers over whose beach chair will go where. “I don’t have a problem with not being liked,” Kushnick says. “Jay and I have a great relationship; my daughter likes me. You can’t please the whole world.”\n\nIn 1973, when she was working in Los Angeles as an agent at International Creative Management, she met her future husband, then a New York lawyer whose clients included entertainment figures. Jerrold Kushnick, who was married at the time and had two teen-age daughters, obtained a divorce and moved to Los Angeles; he and Helen were married in 1979. In the early 1970’s he had created a management company, and his business partner, the comedian Jimmie Walker, had been an effective recruiter, bringing in, among others, David Letterman, Elayne Boosler, and Debbie Allen. Walker’s recollection is that he introduced Jerry Kushnick to a friend of his from Boston, Jay Leno. (Helen says that she spotted Leno doing his act after he moved to Los Angeles, and that she introduced Jerry to Leno.) As the business started to take off, Jerry Kushnick decided to reorganize it with Helen, and in the process Walker was edged out. He remains critical of Helen, believing that she undermined his relationship with Leno. “That was a very illegitimate deal that Helen pulled off,” he says now. Kushnick responds that her husband was in charge of the matter, “and I can’t ask him about it.”\n\nA year after their wedding, when she was thirty-five, Helen gave birth to twins. Sara and Samuel were born two months early, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and spent several weeks in the neonatology unit, where they both received a series of blood transfusions. Samuel, who was in and out of intensive care with respiratory problems, was transfused twenty times. After the infants were brought home, Helen noticed that although they were relatively healthy, Samuel was not growing as fast as Sara. Then, soon after his second birthday, Sam caught a cold, which, over the following months, led to more serious infections. Despite the Kushnicks’ concern over Sam’s fevers and perpetually runny nose, the doctors they consulted frequently characterized their son’s problems as the common maladies of childhood. In September of 1983, Sam was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. He was coughing and feverish, and his lips had taken on a blue tinge. The next day, the hospital reluctantly gave the Kushnicks its diagnosis: Sam was suffering from a kind of pneumonia common in patients with AIDS.\n\nSamuel Kushnick died nineteen days after entering Cedars, and the Kushnicks began a crusade to find out what had happened. They learned that the community blood bank at Cedars, the twenty-second largest in the country, had been contaminated by the AIDS virus in the early nineteen-eighties, and they pressed the hospital to get in touch with the parents of other children who had received transfusions in that period. The Kushnicks felt that Cedars and the American Red Cross, which administered the blood bank, were stonewalling them. Partly in response to the Kushnick case, which received national attention, the hospital instituted a program for alerting other parents. Helen Kushnick later helped to draft national guidelines for the treatment of pediatric AIDS and was a founding director of the American Foundation for AIDS Research, or AMFAR.\n\nThe Kushnicks’ battle with Cedars lasted for four years and, in a way, it informed Helen’s conflicts with NBC when, nine years after her son’s death, she and Leno landed the “Tonight Show.” “This is very similar to me,” she says. “I mean, this is about the system, and the system not being right, and that’s what the Red Cross was. In 1983, when I said, ‘I’m going public with this,’ I was told, ‘Oh, they’ll get you,’ and ‘They’re real powerful, Cedars-Sinai and the American Red Cross.’ And I said, ‘ “Get” me—what?’ So this situation that I’m in right now is really no different to me. I don’t know why I’m always the person fighting the system. I guess that’s just my role in life.”\n\nOne of the first jokes Helen Kushnick heard Jay Leno tell onstage broke her up. It was 1975. He was performing at the Comedy Store, and he told the crowd that he had just arrived from Boston and couldn’t get used to the West Coast: “The beach is on the wrong side.”\n\nHelen became Leno’s agent shortly thereafter, and arranged for Jerry Kushnick to become Jay’s manager, so that they could represent him together. Apparently, that wasn’t much of a struggle. Jimmie Walker remembers that Jerry had reservations about taking on the young Boston comic with the remarkable jaw, saying, “He doesn’t earn enough to cover expenses,” but Helen saw something she liked. “His material was so different from what everybody else was doing, which was very raunchy, and all the four-letter words,” she says. “He was saying things that people were thinking, and making it come out funny. And I thought, Isn’t this nice? A thinking comedian.”\n\nShe came to hold high aspirations for Leno and to dream of his becoming the comic of his generation, but first he had to get work. Leno’s Comedy Store appearance was an unpaid gig. He had been sleeping in his car, and once spent a night in jail after being picked up for vagrancy. There wasn’t yet a comedy club in every strip mall—young comedians had to hope for a break on one of the TV talk shows. But Jay Leno wasn’t an easy television sell. Casting directors didn’t think much of his acting skills or his looks. One of them, according to the Leno legend, even recommended plastic surgery on the now famous Leno chin, saying, “He has a face that will scare small children.” Undeterred, Kushnick sent Leno out on the road, and he worked as the opening act in dinner theatres, doing standup while the tables were cleared. He wasn’t making much money, and when he was short on the down payment for his first house the Kushnicks lent him ten thousand dollars. Over the years, many of the Kushnicks’ clients switched management, but Leno never strayed.\n\nIt has become another part of the Leno legend that when Johnny Carson first saw him perform he told the young comic that he didn’t have enough jokes. In the early seventies, every young comic’s dream was to land a guest spot on the “Tonight Show.” Carson finally invited Leno to appear on “Tonight” in 1977, but his real television home had yet to be created. It arrived, in 1982, in the form of “Late Night with David Letterman,” which became to a younger, hipper audience what Carson’s show was to grownups. Letterman gave his pal Leno a standing invitation to be a guest, and Leno made the most of it. By then, Leno had become established in comedy’s first rank. In 1986, the Kushnicks asked Brandon Tartikoff, then the president of NBC Entertainment, to bring Leno to the network. In June, Tartikoff, although he wasn’t sure exactly what Leno would be doing, signed him.\n\nA few weeks earlier, Joan Rivers,who had been Carson’s exclusive guest host, had left NBC to try her hand at her own show. Tartikoff and Carson subsequently chose Leno and Garry Shandling as “Tonight” guest hosts, with the two comics alternating on Mondays—Carson’s day off—and during his vacations. But after a while Shandling became preoccupied with his cable show and dropped out. Leno geared up. Tartikoff says, “With Helen and Jerry behind him, he was honing and polishing, and taking material out on the road, so when he came in and did a monologue once a week or every two weeks it was killer stuff.”\n\nBy the time Leno was named Carson’s exclusive guest host, in 1987, it was apparent that there were just two contenders for Carson’s job: Leno and Letterman. Letterman was the distinct favorite, having had his own nightly show on NBC for five years, but Leno, the underdog, tried harder. Kushnick, knowing that Leno needed to learn how to work with writers, hired a team of gagmen to work with him. When he was on the road—and that was almost always when he was not on “Tonight”—she arranged for him to meet with local entertainment reporters and visit the local TV stations affiliated with NBC. When the network needed a performer for a function, Leno always raised his hand. This was a campaign, and little things might make the difference.\n\nMeanwhile, Carson was hanging on, and that was fine with Tartikoff. The NBC programmer had always appreciated the fact that as long as Carson was at NBC the eleven-thirty time slot was something he didn’t have to worry about. If the king’s ratings were dropping a bit, if his audience was getting older, Tartikoff could live with that as long as Carson could—it was Carson’s call. However, Tartikoff remembers, by 1990 “Helen began to say, ‘So, what’s next? When’s the king going to die?’ ” Someone in the Leno-Kushnick camp decided to help things along, and planted a story in the New York Post suggesting that NBC meant to dump Carson in favor of Leno. It didn’t hasten Carson’s departure, but it did make him mad. Ever since, relations between Carson and Leno (neither of whom mentioned the other on the air during the transition) have remained cool.\n\nIn February of 1991, Carson told Tartikoff that he would retire from“Tonight” sometime in the next year. By then, Tartikoff was halfway out the door to his new job, as chairman of Paramount Pictures (a post from which he resigned last week). The task of choosing Carson’s successor fell to Warren Littlefield.\n\nWhile Leno was actively campaigning for the job, Letterman and his manager, Jack Rollins, never approached NBC about “Tonight.” Although Letterman had created a successful franchise, Leno had the strong support of the affiliated stations he had been wooing for five years. Moreover, while Letterman’s idiosyncratic humor was well suited to the post-midnight time period, he was unproved at eleven-thirty, and Leno was a known quantity there. The choice of Leno would also make the programming pieces fit neatly. If Letterman got the job, Kushnick warned, Leno would leave for CBS, but if Leno got the job NBC could keep Letterman, whose contract had another year to run. In the end, Littlefield and John Agoglia decided not even to discuss the job with Letterman, reasoning that if he said yes they’d have a problem. In June of 1991, the network announced Leno’s appointment.\n\nBypassing Letterman proved a short-term solution, a miscalculation that NBC is now paying for, as Letterman entertains offers from NBC’s competitors.\n\nKushnick and NBC got off to a bad start. True, the network had given her the job she’d asked for (and had bought out her management company for seven million dollars, even though her client list had dwindled to Leno and three writers). But she was annoyed that she had had to ask for the job. “If I were a man,” she would say to people, “would I have had to ask?” Others later wondered whether the network would have so readily raised the question of psychological problems with a male employee. (Jane Rosenthal, the executive vice-president of Tribeca Productions, Robert De Niro’s film company, and a longtime friend of Kushnick’s, dismisses the talk of her instability. “If Helen had been going to crack, she would have cracked after Sam died. And then Jerry died, and she still hadn’t cracked up. And then the breast cancer reappeared, she had a breast removed. The other stuff is just business, you know?”) Then, there was the show’s changing relationship to the network. For the last dozen years of his reign, Johnny Carson had owned the “Tonight” franchise—a concession that NBC had granted him in order to settle a contract dispute. Between eleven-thirty and twelve-thirty every week night, Carson and his staff had had complete autonomy, and near-complete control over the NBC airwaves. If some news or sports event caused the “Tonight Show” to start late, for example, it was entirely Carson’s decision whether there would be a show at all. When Carson left, however, ownership of the franchise reverted to NBC, which was delighted to have it back. NBC executives felt an eager sense of proprietorship. The trouble lay in the fact that Helen Kushnick did as well.\n\nFrom the beginning, she was outspoken in her view of the way the network was run, which was that much of it was not run well. Her criticism was directed particularly at NBC’s top management—Wright, Littlefield, and Agoglia—whom she considered to be amateurish, and sometimes she mused aloud about the frustration of having to explain the television business to them. She came to sense a particular antipathy toward her on the part of Robert Wright. After the first couple of weeks on the show, Kushnick received a note of congratulations from Wright’s wife but nothing from Wright himself; Kushnick saw the gesture as a kind of sex discrimination, and said so. Finally, after Leno told Wright that it would be nice if he congratulated Kushnick himself, Wright sent her a personal note. (Kushnick later held it up as evidence that NBC had endorsed her stewardship of “Tonight.”) But her disapproval reached downward, too, and eventually she offered her opinion about virtually every NBC department that had dealings with the “Tonight Show.” “Her goal was to get Jay that job, and it appeared that once that was in place, and once everything was rolling along, she couldn’t stop pushing,” Bobby Colomby says. “It was like a momentum that was just ongoing, and once there were no more walls to knock down she began to create imaginary walls.”\n\nKushnick’s detractors in show business pointed to her tenure at “Tonight” as a classic instance of the “power corrupts” principle, but to Kushnick her job was the same one it had always been: to advance the cause of Jay Leno. “I just put blinders on and was doing my job,” she says. Responding to the possibility that NBC might suddenly have an unwelcome hole following the “Tonight Show” if David Letterman departed, Kushnick suggested to Warren Littlefield that “Tonight” could fill the first thirty minutes of Letterman’s slot, expanding to ninety minutes—its original format. Littlefield thanked her for the suggestion, but she didn’t leave it at that; instead, she telephoned Kevin Goldman, a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, and his subsequent story about her proposal further antagonized the already touchy Letterman camp.\n\nA short while later, Kushnick informed Agoglia that she wanted to buy NBC Productions. She said that some investment bankers she knew were already interested. When Agoglia didn’t warm to the idea, she stormed off.\n\nIt has been forgotten in Hollywood, perhaps unfairly, that Kushnick didn’t actually start the battle that caused her to lose the war. A month before Carson stepped down, Arsenio Hall assailed Leno in Entertainment Weekly, ridiculing his frequent efforts to portray their incipient late-night duel as friendly competition. “I always hear that Jay and I are friends when they interview him,” Hall was quoted as saying. “I have no problem about saying good things about my competitors, but Jay Leno and I aren’t friends! And you know what? I wasn’t anointed, O.K.? No one put the late-night silver spoon in my mouth. I earned every drop of mine. . . . And I’m gonna treat him like we treated the kid on the high-school basketball team who was the coach’s son. . . . We tried to kick his ass, and that’s what I’m going to do—kick Jay’s ass.”\n\nSome said that the statement stemmed from an unpleasant impulse on Hall’s part, and was unnecessarily personal, but the competition for the late-night audience is a high-stakes enterprise, and in that regard Hall’s comments showed tactical instinct. Against Johnny Carson, “The Arsenio Hall Show” was viewed as an interesting but certainly lesser late-night choice, but with Carson on his way out Hall’s assault had the effect of elevating his show, suggesting a battle between equals.\n\nWhen Kushnick arrived, she responded characteristically: the “Tonight” staff became more aggressive in its booking efforts, pressuring publicists and agents to offer their clients to Leno first. There was some grousing around town, but, so far, Kushnick and her team were guilty only of heightening the intensity of a well-established practice among competing talk shows.\n\nThen came Kushnick’s attempt to thwart an appearance by ElizabethTaylor on “Arsenio.” Kushnick was angered that Taylor would choose “Arsenio,” especially considering that the purpose of the appearance was to promote Taylor’s AIDS foundation. Kushnick telephoned Taylor at home, reminded the actress of her own involvement in the aids arena, and asked her to cancel the “Arsenio” booking and appear on “Tonight” instead. But Taylor wouldn’t be moved. Kushnick then began to press Taylor about the propriety of her fund-raising, questioning whether the foundation was a wholly legitimate effort and properly registered. Taylor interpreted these questions as a threat, and her attorney wrote Kushnick a letter demanding that she halt such inquiries. Word soon spread that Kushnick was feuding with and threatening to investigate Liz Taylor; Kushnick denied it. However, the Cirque du Soleil was scratched from the “Tonight Show” some weeks later because, according to one “Tonight” staff member, the circus act had “appeared at Liz Taylor’s benefit.” Kushnick says that the only reason for the cancellation was that the Cirque du Soleil had already been on the show several times in the recent past.\n\nIn August, when the “Tonight Show” went back on the air after the Olympics, Kushnick made a decision that, in the view of many in Hollywood, crossed the line. Irked by the criticism of her booking approach, Kushnick responded by enunciating a booking rule that was still more aggressive. “Her policy was: Every record company, every movie company, every publicist is going to have to choose from now on—either they do us or they do ‘Arsenio,’ ” a “Tonight” staff member recalls. The new Kushnick policy, apparently, demanded not only that guests appear solely on “Tonight” first but that they appear solely on “Tonight” forever.\n\nThe “Tonight” intrigues rated high in entertainment-industry buzz rooms over the summer, but in September the controversies became public when the country singer Travis Tritt, who had appeared on “Tonight,” broke the Kushnick rule and accepted an invitation from “Arsenio.” Kushnick called Ken Kragen, Tritt’s manager, and suggested that if Tritt appeared on “Arsenio” he would be banned from the “Tonight Show.” Tritt did “Arsenio,” and Kragen was enraged when another of his performers, Trisha Yearwood, was cancelled from “Tonight,” in what he saw as a retaliatory move. He expressed his anger in an article in the Los Angeles Times, and suddenly the Kushnick problem took on an urgent status at NBC.\n\n“This is a business that relies on personal relationships, and her behavior, of torching relationships, became intolerable,” John Agoglia says. “Internally, we no longer had a team rooting for her, and it had moved way beyond the occasional call to Warren and me from very angry people on the outside. This is a personal sort of business, and we can’t deal with that.”\n\nFor her part, Kushnick began to suspect that the troubles plaguing the show were not accidental but, rather, the work of people with an interest in seeing Jay Leno fail. Ken Kragen, in her view, was merely a dupe, recruited by her enemies. (She later pointed out in an angry exchange with NBC executives that Kragen had a production deal at NBC.) The real culprits were Bernie Brillstein, the powerful producer and talent manager; Michael Ovitz, the head of Creative Artists Agency; Brandon Tartikoff, who was now at Paramount; and other members of the “little power group that runs this town,” in Kushnick’s phrase. The enemies list seemed to grow daily, and eventually it included her friend Bobby Colomby. Kushnick believed that she had made enemies because she played the power game as well as the members of “the Boys’ Club,” as she put it, and they resented her for it. She also came to believe that NBC had changed its mind about Leno.\n\nKushnick was not reserved about these views, and as they bounced around Hollywood’s echo chamber they acquired the tenor of frantic rantings. Industry associates, many of them the very people she deemed suspect, would hear the latest Kushnick story, shake their heads, and say, “She needs help.” But, Leno would tell Kushnick, “just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean they’re not out to get you,” and he had a point. Most of the people Kushnick worried about did, in fact, have much to gain if she—and, by extension, Leno—were to fail. Brillstein represented Garry Shandling as well as Dana Carvey, who was being talked of as a replacement for “Letterman” and possibly for Leno; Ovitz represented Leno’s friendly rival David Letterman; Tartikoff’s Paramount produced “Arsenio Hall.” People in the business of promoting artists, such as Kragen and Colomby, would benefit if the “Tonight Show” eased away from its aggressive booking policies.\n\nAs the drama played itself out, David Letterman was poised offstage, like a gremlin prepared to make mischief. Letterman, it turned out, had been deeply aggrieved when NBC gave the “Tonight Show” to Leno without so much as discussing it with him, and people close to him say that he nursed his anger into a sustained rage. When Littlefield and Agoglia flew to New York last year to tell Letterman about their “Tonight” decision, he walked out of the meeting, according to one person who was present. He joked about his also-ran status on the air, and for a time he took to flashing Littlefield’s photograph on the screen and offering barbed commentary. Much worse for NBC, he went out and hired Michael Ovitz.\n\nWhile NBC was busy launching Leno’s “Tonight Show,” the Letterman issue didn’t seem especially pressing, because he was bound to the network until April of 1993. But as fall came and NBC’s new programs faltered in the ratings the prospect of losing Letterman assumed a chilling likelihood. Then Ovitz negotiated the right to talk to other suitors on Letterman’s behalf before his contract expired, a provision that was agreed upon last Friday. He will shop Letterman around for the next four weeks.\n\nIt is definitely a seller’s market. CBS, which has never had a successful eleven-thirty program, is desperate to hire Letterman, and has promised long-term security, as well as the most popular lineup of prime-time shows as a lead-in. Howard Stringer, the network’s president, has ingratiated himself in Letterman’s circle and has spent months preparing for the campaign to win him over. ABC is also keenly interested and can offer Letterman a midnight slot, with “Nightline,” at eleven-thirty, as a lead-in. Several companies are also dangling syndication deals in front of him; one rumor had a syndicator offering him twenty-five million dollars to leave NBC. “They can all write checks,” a member of the Letterman camp says. “The money is irrelevant.” Apparently, what matters to Letterman is getting a shot at the broader audience of the eleven-thirty time period, which NBC can deliver only if Leno is fired. Letterman, meanwhile, has said that he doesn’t want to be seen as the man who dumped Jay Leno.\n\nNBC’s hopes look dim, but it has one chance to keep Letterman. When Ovitz lays Letterman’s offers on the table, the network has the right to match the best bid. Although it won’t be able to offer an eleven-thirty time slot, it plans to promise Letterman the next best thing: that if Leno falters, Letterman will get the “Tonight Show.”\n\nIn the weeks since Kushnick was fired, Leno has become more engaged in the daily process of the show: he’s attending meetings, and, where once he was shielded by Kushnick, his door is now open to the staff. On the show, people around him say, he is more relaxed, and it’s beginning to be evident. The “Tonight” ratings were fine in October, but November presents a minefield. It is a “sweeps” month, when ratings are used to set local stations’ ad rates for the next quarter. The fact that Letterman will be out bargaining with NBC’s competitors can only intensify the pressure on Leno. NBC has told him of its plan to offer Letterman first crack at “Tonight” if Leno falters, and Leno knows that if he has a terrible November this may happen sooner rather than later. For Leno, it must be a surprising and unwelcome turn in a career course that seemed finally to have led him safely to his destination. Last May, when he became only the fourth permanent host in the thirty-eight-year history of the “Tonight Show,” Leno joked, in his opening monologue, about the longevity implicit in the job. Responding to the studio audience’s applause, he quipped, “Let’s see how you feel in thirty years.” Now, NBC’s expressions of confidence notwithstanding, he can’t be certain of lasting thirty weeks.\n\nKushnick, meanwhile, seems to be accommodating herself to life away from the show. She says she does not need “help,” and hasn’t sought it, although she did need a vacation. As for Leno, Kushnick says, “Jay will survive.” Then, perhaps reflecting on the future of Leno in the “Tonight” fray without her by his side, she adds, “I think that will be determined by how much this pressure gets to him. Running things, and interacting with people a lot on a daily basis, is not something he’s used to.” ♦"
