        "text": "On Friday, April 1 from 10am-2pm at the City Mission Chapel, Senator Camera Bartolotta along with City Mission, Southwestern Pennsylvania Legal Aid, and the Washington County Bar Association all came together to host a free legal clinic for City Mission residents and eligible community members.\n\nThe purpose of the âClean Slate Dayâ event was to help City Mission residents and eligible members of the community to obtain expungements or pardons for criminal records.\n\nâWe need to put people on a path to get back to the workplace, back to their family, and back to life,â said Senator Bartolotta. Â âWe need to remove barriers so people in our community can live happy and meaningful lives.â\n\nAn expungement is a legal court order that removes a criminal record from public view when appropriate, which helps to give a second chance to those who have turned their lives around. Courts can also consider âlimited accessâ requests to shield non-violent misdemeanor convictions from public view, so long as the person making the request has received no additional convictions for the past 10 years. Â At Fridayâs Clean Slate Day event, there were volunteer attorneys on hand to work one-on-one with individuals to help them navigate the expungement process. Â\n\nâA criminal record is a very real barrier to employment for our residents,â said City Mission Manager of Career Services, Brianna Kadlecik. Â And sustainable employment is a vital piece of the puzzle for them to get back to independent living. Â But a clean slate does not just help with employment. Â Kadlecik has seen criminal records create barriers for our residents to obtain housing, financial aid for education, and even a driverâs license â all things that could help to clear a path for them to a better life. Â Â\n\nâItâs a beautiful thing,â Kadlecik said of the Clean Slate Day event. Â âWe have 11 City Mission residents in attendance today. Â Residents who have attended in the past have been able to get answers to things they didnât think they would ever be able to get answers to.â Â\n\nFor Brian Gorman, the Executive Director of Southwestern Pennsylvania Legal Aid, Clean Slate Day is about giving people a second chance. Â âEverybody who comes here is looking to better themselves in some way,â he explained. Â âTheyâre looking for a job or a higher-income job. Â They could also be trying to go to school or to obtain housing, and their criminal record is preventing them from achieving those goals. Â So it not only gives people hope and redemption, but it also gives them tangible things that can help them create a better life.â\n\nIf those in attendance at the Clean Slate Day event were not eligible for expungements, there were also volunteer pardon coaches from the Washington County Pardon Project on hand to help walk them through the process for applying for a pardon with the Pennsylvania Board of Pardons at no cost. Â The process can take from one to three years to complete, but nonviolent misdemeanor and felony convictions can be pardoned if an applicant demonstrates a change in his or her life since the arrest along with an important need for the pardon, such as increasing employment opportunities. Governor Tom Wolf has pardoned nearly 2,000 applicants during his tenure as Governor of Pennsylvania.\n\nKyle Duff is the Project Coordinator for the Washington County Pardon Project. Â He works to recruit applicants and team them up with volunteer coaches to guide them through the process. Â âThe Pardon Project is a connection that helps people with criminal records overcome the barriers associated with their background,â he explained.\n\nâHope is the most important part of this whole thing,â he added. Â âHope is contagious. Â It can overcome fear and desperation.â\n\nDuff explained that the Pardon Project is such a vital part of Washington County life, because the county has become such a hub for the recovery community. âPeople come here from all over the state and all over the country for a chance at a new life. Â And many of them stay and build a life here. Â They get jobs and build careers and start families here. They become part of our community.â Â\n\nThe Pardon Project helps to give them a chance at a better life, which benefits the whole community, because the better they do in their new lives here in Washington County, the more they invest back into our local economy. Â They buy homes and cars. Â They help create a reliable workforce. Â They volunteer. Â They go to church. Â And ultimately, they help to strengthen the fabric of our community. Â\n\nâItâs great to see so many volunteers here who really want to help,â said Senator Bartolotta at the Clean Slate Day event. Â âThey know how cumbersome it can be, and they are here to help people stay on the right path, to stay focused on their goals.â Â\n\nShe added, âThere absolutely is hope! Â And there are lots of people who can help. Â Just pick up the phone.â"
