        "text": "Different things you do with Waze -- driving, reporting, editing the map -- will earn you different amounts of points. You receive the same number of points per kilometer driven whether you choose to display miles or kilometers (a table below translates the two measurement systems).\n\nWaze maintains a list of activities and points -- it is also shown below.\n\nYou can get more points either by driving more or by updating the map for areas where you already drive.\n\nWhat Is a Map Edit?\n\nMap edits are listed in your scoreboard. They also affect your total number of points -- each map edit increases your score by several points. \"Editing the map\" means making a change to one road segment. If you correct the spelling on 3 segments of the same road, you will earn three map edits. If you edit the same segment more than one time in a 24-hour day, you will only receive credit for the edit one time.\n\nFor example, if you correct the city name at the same time or a little later in the day, you have made two changes to the segment but will receive credit for one edit to the segment.\n\nWhat's the Difference Between a Change and an Edit?\n\nIn the map editor, any change is counted by the counter on the Save icon. A change is not the same as an edit. A change is any action that can be undone with the undo button. For example, if you select 10 segments at one time, correct the spelling of the name on all 10 segments, and select Apply, the change counter will increase by one. Why? Because you made one single, undo-able change. If you change one segment by moving 10 geometry points around a curve, each time you drag and drop a geometry point, that is a change and the change counter increases because you can undo each of these actions.\n\nIn the first example, those 10 segments changed all at once will get you credit for 10 edits. In the second example, those 10 changes will get you credit for 1 edit. In the first, you changed 10 different objects. In the second, you changed only a single object.\n\nAs a final, extreme example: if you update an existing long segment, give it a new name, change the city, change the road type, the direction, the lock level and elevation, then adjust the location of 100 geometry points, the save counter may show 160 changes. When you save, that is counted as a single edit to that segment.\n\nWhen you save a large number of changes at once, the system will not credit you with more than 150 points each time you save changes. If you have more than 150 points worth of changes stored up before you save, the edits will be saved to the map, but you only get up to 150 points. Remember that points are not displayed in the save icon, only changes. If you are concerned with the number of edits and points you receive for fixing the map, save more often and with fewer changes between saves to avoid doing uncredited work.\n\nThe details behind these calculations are discussed in this forum thread. Additional changes made to the point system are noted in this later forum thread.\n\nThe Table of Points\n\nActivity Points Unit Complete a drive 5 per drive Edit gas types and prices 8 per edit Report what you see 6 per report Add a voice report 9 per report Tap \"There\" or \"Not there\" on an alert 2 per tap Edit the map 3 edit Add a photo to a place 9 per photo Add an update to a place 3 per detail Adding house numbers 3 per house number Add a new street name 6 per name\n\nFor the latest information on points, please see The Waze Support Get More Points Page\n\nWhen you edit the map, you accumulate map edit points. You can also earn higher editing ranks. Both map edit points and editing rank are displayed when you use the map editor.\n\nYou can see your own editing rank AKA level from the Waze Map Editor (WME) on the top left of the screen.\n\nYour rank appears just under your username as \"Level #\". To the left of your username and level is an avatar icon unique to your level. In the WME when you select a segment, the properties drawer will show you the name (and rank) of the editor who created and last modified the segment. The number in parenthesis after the name, is the editor's current rank (not necessarily the rank they were when they made the edit).\n\nEditing permission\n\nYour editor rank affects the area of the map you can edit as well as your ability to \"lock\" roads, places, and cameras, edit locked roads, places, and cameras, and add closures to roads. For more information, please read about permissions in the Waze Map Editor. You can see the current lock rank of any segment, place, or camera by selecting the object and checking the information in the left pane. If you need help fixing an object that is locked above your rank, please read about editing objects locked above your rank.\n\nPromotion\n\nIn the USA, rank promotions are evaluated based on a combination of related factors including;\n\nEditing skill and knowledge\n\nEditing quality and finish\n\nCommunity involvement\n\nProper etiquette in communication\n\nMentoring participation\n\nEdit count\n\nSuspicious or damaging edits\n\nFactors relevant to promotion may be weighted differently at different ranks. Promotion to ranks 2 and 3 often focus more on knowledge level, skill, and quality of edits (with edit count used as a proxy). Promotion to ranks 4 and above often emphasize communication, community involvement, mentoring, and leadership.\n\nEdit count therefore is of diminishing importance to promotion at higher ranks. If one edits with the requisite skill and communicates with integrity and etiquette, and other rank-associated criteria are satisfied, one may be promoted before achieving the listed edit count for a given rank. If one does not demonstrate effective editing practices with quality edits and proper decorum, promotion may not occur even after one has achieved the listed edit count. This should be seen not as a reflection of one's worth as an editor, but only as a result of the decreased relevance of edit count especially as one reaches higher ranks.\n\nThe Formal Mentoring program is a great tool to help you learn the skills and knowledge you will need to be eligible for a rank promotion. Being in communication with your State Managers (SM) and/or Regional Coordinator(s) (RC) even before you are eligible, will also show you where you need to focus to become eligible for the promotion.\n\nIf you feel that you might be eligible for a rank promotion, please contact your local management team including your SM and RC to initiate a review, and the promotion process. Moving from rank 3 to 4, and higher, is not automatic and requires assistance, make sure to contact your managers/coordinator(s).\n\nRank specific details\n\nIcon Editing Rank (Level) Description\n\nSuggested Edit Count Editable Area Radius Unlocked Waze Mood Notes N/A (staff) Admin, System, or Basemap import N/A Includes segments which have not been created or edited by an actual user, but exist from the initial data import (called the basemap) will show this information. N/A Area Manager N/A Area Manager (AM) is a role not a rank, however this role along with some higher roles e.g. State/Country Manager give the editor greater permissions than listed for their rank in this table. Area Managers (AM) can edit anything within their assigned area except objects locked by higher-level editors. Editors of any rank can be granted AM rights, however in some countries there may be a minimum requirement before Area Managers are approved. Read the Area Manager section in the Wiki first before applying for an AM. 1 New users 1 mile All users start in this group, unless they are a member of one of the other special groups listed 2 Beginner Editors, over 3K edits, or IGN editors 2 miles Editors with 3k edits may be automatically promoted to rank 2 subject to the criteria specified in the promotion section.
