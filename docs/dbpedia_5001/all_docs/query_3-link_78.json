        "text": "Warrior Beach Retreat parade astonishing\n\nWe want to personally thank all who had a hand in promoting and coordinating the Warrior Beach Retreat and its festivities. Bay County holds such a special place in our hearts and minds. It is, hands down, the most patriotic town we have ever had the pleasure of visiting.\n\nWe were astonished at the community's support; from the parade, warriors' ceremony, restaurants, and hotel. We are grateful to all of the residents that came out on Thursday and lined the streets for the parade. It brings tears to our eyes to know that Americans still truly care.\n\nMany veterans never got the chance to be honored when they left theater/retired. This is what makes the ceremony and parade so incredibly special. It shows the veterans that what they did and sacrificed was worth it. Thank you just doesn't seem enough. The Cope family and Warrior Beach Retreat are helping change lives across the country and they can't do it without the support from such a great county.\n\n— Retired SSG Joseph Lowery and Christen Lowery\n\nSponsors made veterans feel special\n\nOn behalf of Mr. Calvin Jennings and SFC (R) Amanda Gunn-Jennings, we would like to thank the sponsors of the Fall 2022 Warrior Beach Retreat. Your generous donations allowed us to enjoy time with other veterans and their caregivers. We were taken excellent care of, and this time together enriched our marriage.\n\nYour support allowed us to stay at the elegant Bluegreen Bayside Resort & Spa. It was such a fantastic, safe place for us to connect. Also, local restaurants and incredibly gracious folks paid for our food during the retreat. We cannot thank them enough for the excellent establishments and great food selections.\n\nOn Oct. 27, Warrior Beach Retreat sponsored a parade for Veterans and caregivers. It was so beautiful to see locals waving the U.S. flags and thanking us for our service. My husband and I were overwhelmed with the love we felt. We greatly appreciate St. Andrews United Methodist Church for hosting the ceremony and dinner. Additionally, we would like to thank the Sheriff’s Office for escorting us throughout the retreat.\n\nIn closing, I thank Philip, Linda, and Jonathan Cope for their tireless efforts in support of Veterans and their families, we believe God placed them on this mission. This is the first retreat that my husband and I have attended together. Needless to say, the bar is exceptionally high for any future retreats that we will attend. Warrior Beach Retreat has laid the foundation for us to gain balance and healing. Thanks again to all the volunteers, sponsors, and locals for making this experience a success for us.\n\n— Calvin and Amanda Jennings\n\nVeterans showered with affection\n\nRecently my wife and I had the absolute privilege of attending Warrior Beach Retreat. We were greeted with such warm and welcoming staff and volunteers. We were treated with gratitude and support. We had an amazing time getting away from the stresses of everyday life. I highly recommend this retreat to every veteran.\n\nI would like to thank the community for really showing up for us in a special way. We were showered with gifts, spa treatments, letters from local children, police escorts and so much delicious food. The most incredible part of this experience had to have been the parade. Seeing how much the community cares and supports us, the waving flags, the broadcasted music, the soldiers saluting, and flyover was an experience I'll never forget. A special thank you to Phillip and Linda Cope for really putting their hearts into this retreat for us\n\n— SGT Joel Harden"
