In 1967 the family moved to Islip and in 1994, Ken married Cheryl Sutton, rekindling their youthful love after having gone their separate ways for some years. Ken was a diligent and hard worker, fighting against tough odds to eventually become co-owner of Babylon Plumbing Supply and a well-respected businessman. His quiet kindness, gentle manner, and generosity was an inspiration to everyone who knew him. This mellow demeanor (Cheryl calls it Zen) was belied by his passion for his super-fast, LOUD speed machines, including his beloved ‘67 Camaro, and his joy while riding his custom appointed mint Harley with his closest buddy, Steve. With his many friends, he enjoyed card games, weekly bowling outings, fine dining, and get-togethers for any occasion. Ken is survived by his wife and soulmate, Cheryl, three children, Cheryl’s daughter Sara, Ken’s daughter Nicole and son David, and five grandchildren; sisters Mary, Patricia, Nancy, and Rita; brothers Robert and Joseph; innumerable cousins, nieces and nephews, uncles and aunts; and many loving friends.
