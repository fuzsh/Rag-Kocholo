        "text": "Jack Stenger, the faculty adviser for a Warrior Wire, is a former newspaper journalist who during his early career worked reporting stints both at the Georgia State Capitol and in Mexico’s second largest city of Guadalajara. Other professional communications jobs had him working in collegiate public relations, financial services marketing, and as an ad agency copywriter. He’s an inveterate consumer of media, a daily subscriber of a national newspaper, and a lifelong observer of how the media and society intersect. He holds an undergraduate degree in journalism from the University of Georgia and a master’s degree in teaching from Georgia State University. Now entering his ninth year of teaching – and his ninth year of his Wire faculty advising -- Stenger is honored to work with such an outstanding corps of editor-leaders and an accompanying contingent of bright and motivated staff writers. His goal is to collaborate with the paper’s leaders to see the Wire make a strong showing in Athens in the spring where it’s hoped the paper vies for many Georgia Scholastic Press Association awards. In his spare time – which he really doesn’t have because of the mountains of papers he always has to grade – he reads Herman Melville, rides his bike around the city, and reads The Wall Street Journal while also grading his students’ papers in hipster coffee shops. His motto is “Fiat Lux” – and you can go to Google translate to see what it means. And his ambition is for all Wire staffers is that they become better writers, better reporters, and even better people on account of what transpires in the Wire lab."
