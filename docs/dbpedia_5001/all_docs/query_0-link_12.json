        "text": "Category: Creative Writing\n\nNostalgia… (#12)\n\nMartin Short, (famous actor on SNL, career included dozens of movies) was recently interviewed where he told a charming story. He, Gilda Radner, Paul Shaffer were born (as actors) at ‘Second City’, Toronto. In the early days, Martin was in a community theatre production of Fortune & Men’s Eyes. The director told the actors that, as the audience came in and took their seats, the actors would be pacing on stage, in a prison setting. In character, wearing only their underwear.\n\nGilda (whom Martin was dating at the time 1972), Paul and some other pals all planned to go see Martin one night. But, as the story goes, the thing Paul Shaffer was really excited about was they would all go for dinner after at the Shakespeare Steakhouse.\n\nSo on the night of the performance, Martin’s friends arrived and Paul, upon seeing Martin pacing, moved up the lip the of the stage and whispered, “Martin, Shakespeare Steakhouse is closed, wink once if Bavarian Seafood makes sense.”\n\nThis type of crazy thing happens all the time in live theatre. Short’s story brought to mind the time that my husband played Dr. Miranda, (a murderous ex-Nazi) in Death and the Maiden (a part that Ben Kingsley is famous for). Our theatre was so small that it didn’t have a curtain. Since Dr. Miranda is held hostage and tied up for most of the play, it meant that my husband, John, remained on stage, in character and tied up during intermission. With audience members coming and going. Actually, he volunteered as there was no logical way to get him untied and offstage.\n\nDuring intermission, a trio of white-haired senior ladies came tripping down the aisle and neared the edge of the stage. John (said later) prayed that they were not\n\ngoing to speak to him. They moved as close to him as they could and one of the dear old things winked and said to him, in a stage-whisper, “Psst! Psst! Mister! Do you want us to untie you?” Giggling and twittering they turned and found their seats again. John stayed in character but it was hard not to burst out laughing.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMY features INTERVIEWS with best-selling AUTHORS!

With one simple idea: Give yourself permission to write GARBAGE. You probably won’t actually write garbage but by giving yourself permission, you remove the block. What is writer’s block? It is the need for perfection..the need to avoid looking stupid. If you can’t write well you won’t write at all. Here’s an exercise:\n\nOpen your file; what you are working on.\n\nThink about what you wish you could write if you weren’t blocked.\n\nSet a timer for three minutes.\n\nNow write garbage!\n\nWrite as much as you can in three minutes.That’s it! The block is gone because you gave yourself permission to write garbage. But you might say: ‘I don’t want to write garbage, I want to write quality.’\n\nA little voice in your head is saying, ‘this is awful, stop! You look foolish.’ That is the block talking. The critic’s voice. The critic’s voice is a good thing but it is jumping in before it’s time; it’s judging your writing before it is even created. That’s writer’s block.\n\n“It is perfectly okay to write garbage–as long as you edit brilliantly.” C.J. Cherryh\n\n“Prose is architecture, not interior decoration.” — Ernest Hemingway\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMY BLOG features INTERVIEWS with best-selling AUTHORS!

It was my mom who first told me I should write seriously 🙂 That was almost 20 years ago when I still wrote in Hebrew. I just arrived to Australia and I was lonely, so for a few months I wrote a series of emails about life in a new country. Writing was my refuge, my way to rip all the loneliness out of me. The topic was Australia, but underneath all that it was just a way to make sense of the world inside of me. My second “serious” attempt with writing was in English. Same as my first attempt, I used writing as a way to share and reflect upon life’s journeys. Whether it be a trip overseas, my Ironman journey, or simply a random weekend escape, I played with the words like a new toy.\n\nQ. How long after that were you published?\n\nTG: I published my first book 20 years later. In between I blogged at http://fullylived.com/blog\n\nQ. What makes a writer great?\n\nTG: Skills + Passion + Dedication. I think it’s a winning formula.\n\nQ. and the all-important: What does the process of going from “no book” to “finished book” look like for you?\n\nTG. mmm… I wish I had a linear step-by-step process… In my case, the process looked methandienone buy in uk online more like me sitting at my desk and letting inspiration take over. Whatever felt right at the moment.\n\nQ. How has your life experiences influenced your writing?\n\nTG. I’d say A LOT. My life experiences as well as my challenges provided me with valuable lessons that I couldn’t learn otherwise.\n\nSomehow, in our society, we’ve decided that struggling is the enemy.But if you’ve ever or embarked on a big and meaningful journey, you know that discomfort and pain are simply part of our growth.Struggling is not the enemy. Hopelessness is;When we feel hopeful about our journey ahead, when we move in a meaningful direction, then struggling is not the problem.On the contrary, it can be part of our joy. Because the struggle is for our dream. And we know that we are giving it our all.\n\nQ. Is there anything else you’d like our readers to know?\n\nTG. Consistent action in the direction of your dreams. It may take a month, it might take a year, it might take a decade. but you will eventually make it if you take consistent action.\n\nTo purchase: The Art of Fully Living\n\nDid you miss part I yesterday?

Mornings on Main is another winner. Characters that you fall in love with. ‘Gram’ was a favorite of mine. She owns a quilting shop and, even though she suffers from short-term memory loss (don’t we all?) she’s feisty and loves her shop, her friends, and her life.\n\nJillian and Connor present a sweet love story as Jillian curates Gram’s historic and valuable quilt collection.\n\nJodi Thomas’ writing is suburb. Her stories move along and her characters entertain the reader. There’s never any doubt (in my mind) about whether the newest book out by Jodi will be any good. They always are…and in this case, I got a lesson about the art of quilting, the historic significance of quilting and the social aspect of quilting…all of which I had little knowledge about. This is a good read and I highly recommend it.\n\nJodi writes:\n\n‘Three women’s stories together as the stories of the town’s history are displayed in quilts. Quilts have always fascinated me. I remember lying under my grandmother’s quilt from that drifted down from the ceiling. I remember my mother quilting long after her mind had had been invaded by Alzheimer’s. I loved seeing my sisters’ quilts displayed on their bedroom walls.\n\nOne of my first memories is lying beneath the quilting frame and listening to my mother and her friends talking as the needles flew. I learned that for them it was never about how fine the stitches were, it was about the friendships, the creative adventure, the love that went into each quilt.\n\nYears later, I was in my late thirties and just beginning to write. My mother was moving into Alzheimer’s. She’d set in the study with me and quilt on a little frame while I typed away on my stories. As the years passed and my skill as a writer grew, while her skills slowly vanished we both still loved those morning working together.’\n\nBut, I don’t quilt. My mother quilted, my grandmother quilted. Both my sisters quilt.I have a quilt room in my house full of handmade quilts dating back five generations.\n\nMy mother only read my first book before she stopped reading completely. I’ll never forget what she said about my patchwork stories that blend together. She said, “Jodi, you quilt with words.”\n\nwww.amazon.com Release Date: April 10th\n\nJodi was a guest blogger on my site\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMY BLOG features INTERVIEWS with best-selling AUTHORS!

If you have an unfinished novel, play, or story…you don’t have to necessarily work on it every day. Too much pressure! A successful writer DOES try to write every day but you can write anything. Maybe you’re not in a creative mood today to work on your novel. So write on your blog or write a piece of poetry. Or a short story. Whatever it is, you don’t have to finish it TODAY. Just write! Write every day! Write something!\n\n“Remember these stories, Tlaga. My people live inside them.

Recently, teens have taken to their cell phones and computers to do the same. Blacks against whites against browns. All good kids at their core, but divided by the color of their skin.\n\n#32 in the series of short plays for the classroom.\n\nThis series has been very popular, over the years, with teachers and students. Sets, costumes, props are not needed. Most pertain to real life issues for teens so these plays are meant to open a dialogue between teens and their teachers. Or, at the very least, to experience live theatre.\n\nAll ‘G’ rated so no adult content. When profanities are used, as teens do in real life, they are optional and can be easily eliminated.\n\nAvailable at www.amazon.com and all other fine book stores.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMY BLOG features INTERVIEWS with best-selling AUTHORS!

Thanks!\n\nTo Purchase\n\nThe White Rhino Hotel by Bartle Bull ~~ A Review\n\n6 out of 5 quills\n\nThe White Rhino Hotel ~~ A Review\n\nA sweeping epic reminiscent of Hemingway, Steinbeck and Kipling. But, none of these…a unique voice that will touch you deeply if Africa touches you.\n\nThe setup for the legion of characters and the landscape of Africa took about 100 pages. By then I was hooked by the richly developed people that fill Bull’s story. The writing is pure prose.\n\n“Remember these stories, Tlaga. My people live inside them. When a tale is told, everyone who ever heard that story is alive again….”\n\n“An alphabet makes the words that keep a people together….”\n\nThe story is dusty, hot, dangerous and violent. But so is Africa. Just when the new settlers think they’ve domesticated the continent, warrior ants, a herd of elephants and floods storm through. Bull’s characters populate Africa but never effect it, much less conquer it. Olivio, the grotesque dwarf. The reader can’t help themselves, they love and hate him at the same time. The star-crossed lovers, Anton and Gwenn. Hugo von Decken and his son, Ernst. German pioneers homesteading their piece of Africa. The list goes on and on.\n\nThe story begins in (literally) the last days of World War I as a German unit traverses the plains of Africa, toting along their prisoners of war, some severely wounded. I don’t write spoilers so that’s about all I will tell of the story. I adore fiction that teaches me history. I had no idea of a Soldiers Lottery for land in West Africa after the world war ended. Whereby soldiers who fought in Africa could enter a lottery and homestead land that belonged only to the African native.\n\nThis is their story. But it’s also Africa’s story; how it was fought over and then the land was passed out as booty after the war. Given away even though none of it belonged to any white man.\n\nI highly recommend this book. Take your time, savor each word, taste the air of Africa.

Sweazy, Author….Interview (part 2)\n\nQ. What first inspired you to write your stories?\n\nLS. As a kid I played with Hot Wheels cars like a lot of little boys. I liked making up stories about where the cars were going and why. It started there. On the floor as a six year old boy, under the feet of adults, listening to their stories, and to the voices in my head.\n\nQ. What comes first to you? The Characters or the Situation?\n\nLS. Characters. Always.\n\nQ. Do you ‘get lost’ in your writing?\n\nLS. Yes. Those are the good days. When the world and time disappears. I hope the writing does the same thing for readers.\n\nQ. Who or what is your “Muse” at the moment?\n\nLS. My muse has always been my desire to become a better writer.\n\nQ. Tell us about writing westerns.\n\nLS. I have always loved westerns. I grew in the 1960s and there were a lot westerns on television. Bonanza, The Wild, Wild West, The Rifleman,\n\netc. And we could only get three channels on our little black and white TV in small town in Indiana. Add in that I grew up in a house without a father, those cowboys became my heroes, the good guys who stood up to the bad guys, and showed me who the bad guys were. I needed that. I learned a lot from those westerns.\n\nTime went by, and westerns kind of fell out of favor. Detective stories took over. I grew up and went about my life. After I started writing seriously, an editor asked me to write a mystery short story with a modern-day Texas Ranger as the main character. I’d published in the small press, and this was my first chance to publish professionally in an anthology, Texas Rangers, to be published by Berkley (Penguin Random House). The editor, the venerable Ed Gorman, liked the story, “The Promotion,” and bought it. What I didn’t know was that story was going to be published in a western anthology, not a mystery anthology. And then the magic happened. My first professionally published short story went on to win the WWA (Western Writers of America) Spur Award that year. I was floored. I went to the convention in Spokane, Washington and met a lot of great writers; Elmer Kelton, Don Coldsmith,\n\nRobert Conley, and Loren Estleman to name a few. Westerns felt like home. I knew the stories and the characters, so I started writing westerns in hopes of getting one published. Three years later, my agent, who I met at that first WWA convention, sold the first two books in the Josiah Wolfe, Texas Ranger series. I went on to write six books in that series, and I’m happy to say the series is still gaining readers today, almost ten years after the first book, The Rattlesnake Season, was published.\n\nThe demise of the western has long been forecast, but I don’t believe it. Westerns are mortality tales, crime stories, and the only all-American genre we have. Westerns are like jazz, an American contribution to world of literature. Hollywood still makes westerns and they seem surprised when one of them draws a big audience. But I’m not surprised. Western characters are our people. We know their struggles of their stories. All readers ask is that westerns are authentic and honest. And that’s the kind of novels, and stories in general, that I try to write.\n\nThe conclusion to this Interview with Larry will appear March 16th.\n\nDid you miss Part 1?

In my opinion, if your action is good in a screenplay, the dialogue can be mediocre and often is in blockbusters. If your dialogue is crisp and interesting and helps drive the story, you’ve done a better job than most in Hollywood.’\n\nWhile you can buy books and software to do the job for you it’s always good to have a grasp of the general spacing standards. The top, bottom and right margins of a screenplay are 1″. The left margin is 1.5″. The extra half-inch of white space to the left of a script page allows for binding with brads, yet still imparts a feeling of vertical balance of the text on the page. The entire document should be single-spaced.\n\nThe very first item on the first page should be the words FADE IN:. Note: the first page is never numbered. Subsequent page numbers appear in the upper right hand corner, 0.5″ from the top of the page, flush right to the margin.\n\nScreenplay Elements\n\nBelow is a list of items (with definitions) that make up the screenplay format, along with indenting information. Again, screenplay software will automatically format all these elements, but a screenwriter must have a working knowledge of the definitions to know when to use each one.\n\nScene Heading\n\nIndent: Left: 0.0″ Right: 0.0″ Width: 6.0″\n\nA scene heading is a one-line description of the location and time of day of a scene, also known as a “slugline.” It should always be in CAPS.\n\nExample: EXT. WRITERS STORE – DAY reveals that the action takes place outside The Writers Store during the daytime.\n\nSubheader\n\nIndent: Left: 0.0″ Right: 0.0″ Width: 6.0″\n\nWhen a new scene heading is not necessary, but some distinction needs to be made in the action, you can use a subheader. But be sure to use these sparingly, as a script full of subheaders is generally frowned upon. A good example is when there are a series of quick cuts between two locations, you would use the term INTERCUT and the scene locations.\n\nAction\n\nIndent: Left: 0.0″ Right: 0.0″ Width: 6.0″\n\nThe narrative description of the events of a scene, written in the present tense. Also less commonly known as direction, visual exposition, blackstuff, description or scene direction.\n\nRemember – only things that can be seen and heard should be included in the action.\n\nCharacter\n\nIndent: Left: 2.0″ Right: 0.0″ Width: 4.0″\n\nWhen a character is introduced, his name should be capitalized within the action. For example: The door opens and in walks LIAM, a thirty-something hipster with attitude to spare.\n\nA character’s name is CAPPED and always listed above his lines of dialogue. Minor characters may be listed without names, for example “TAXI DRIVER” or “CUSTOMER.”\n\nDialogue\n\nIndent: Left: 1.0″ Right: 1.5″ Width: 3.5″\n\nLines of speech for each character. Dialogue format is used anytime a character is heard speaking, even for off-screen and voice-overs. Normal upper and lower case is used.\n\nParenthetical\n\nIndent: Left: 1.5″ Right: 2.0″ Width: 2.5″\n\nA parenthetical is direction for the character, that is either attitude or action-oriented. With roots in the playwriting genre, today, parentheticals are used very rarely, and only if absolutely necessary. Why? Two reasons. First, if you need to use a parenthetical to convey what’s going on with your dialogue, then it probably just needs a good re-write. Second, it’s the director’s job to instruct an actor on how to deliver a line, and everyone knows not to encroach on the director’s turf!\n\nExtension\n\nPlaced after the character’s name, in parentheses\n\nAn abbreviated technical note placed after the character’s name to indicate how the voice will be heard onscreen, for example, if the character is speaking as a voice-over, it would appear as LIAM (V.O.).\n\nTransition\n\nIndent: Left: 4.0″ Right: 0.0″ Width: 2.0″\n\nTransitions are film editing instructions, and generally only appear in a shooting script. Transition verbiage includes:\n\nCUT TO:\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nSMASH CUT:\n\nQUICK CUT:\n\nFADE TO:\n\nAs a spec script writer, you should avoid using a transition unless there is no other way to indicate a story element. For example, you might need to use DISSOLVE TO: to indicate that a large amount of time has passed.\n\nShot\n\nIndent: Left: 0.0″ Right: 0.0″ Width: 6.0″\n\nA shot tells the reader the focal point within a scene has changed. Like a transition, there’s rarely a time when a spec screenwriter should insert shot directions. Once again, that’s the director’s job.\n\nSample of what your page should look like: [Source: The Writer’s Digest]\n\nother related posts by this blogger:\n\nHow To Write a Play\n\nHow To Format a Play\n\nHow To Format a Novel\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMY BLOG features INTERVIEWS with best-selling AUTHORS!

Thanks!\n\nTo Purchase\n\nHow To Format Your Novel\n\nAbout editing and proofing: I see a lot of self published books and sometimes the formatting is so bad I can hardly read the story. Don’t let this happen to your book. Proof the book, then proof it again, then proof it again, before you publish.\n\nFormat: you should give the reader’s eye somewhere to ‘rest’. This means you should have adequate ‘white paper’. If margins are not tight enough and too much text is on the page, it’s exhausting. When paragraphs are too long they also exhaust the reader.\n\nHere is a link https://forums.createspace.com/en/community/docs/DOC-1482 and a format I use exclusively. Or you can just go to:\n\n1] page layout in your doc\n\n2] margins\n\n3] custom margins and then put in the numbers.\n\n4] Be certain your ‘gutter’ number is 7.0 minimum\n\nMy publishing platform offers templates for whatever book size I am going to use. So I download the template and begin writing, from the very beginning, using that. It saves so much time in formatting later. Or if you have been writing a story for awhile, you cut/paste the manuscript onto the template. But you must proof it and edit it.\n\nEach chapter should begin on an odd numbered page. On that page the heading should be consistent; that is, 6 or 7 or 10 spaces down, but consistent. The chapter title should be centered. Don’t be afraid of the even numbered page opposite the new chapter being blank. That’s what your reader expects to see.\n\nThe header should be consistent: even-numbered page should have the author’s name and the odd numbered page, the title of the book. The pages leading up to the first chapter should NOT have headers.\n\nJustification: Your ‘alignment’ should be ‘justify’ rather than ‘left’. This gives your document clean crisp edges so it looks more polished. But I frequently find the program will default to ‘justified’ on a line of text that has only a few words and spreads them out inappropriately across the page. When this happens, highlight the text and choose ‘left’ alignment. That will clean it up. There should be NO spacing between paragraphs.\n\nYour copyright ‘Notice’ page: (Always on an even numbered page.) should carry weight. Many amatures list only the year of copyright, Title, ISBN number. Your page should look like this:\n\nNotice (centered)\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Trisha Sugarek. All rights reserved.
