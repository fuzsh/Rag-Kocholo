        "text": "Lift up the Word. Light up the World.\n\nâLord, you are a light to us,â prayed City Missionâs President Emeritus, Dean Gartland, at our annual National Day of Prayer meeting last Thursday. âMay your light shine through us to others. We pray for City Mission. Help us to continue to be a bright light in a dark time.â On Thursday, May 2, City Mission hosted our annual National Day of Prayer celebration in our Porter Pillow and Peggie Beaver Pillow Chapel. Leah Dietrich, Director of Residential Programs, acted as Master of Ceremonies, and Dr. Sally Mounts, Chief Development Officer, kicked off the event singing âWho Am Iâ by Casting Crowns. Next, City Mission staff members came up to speak and pray on a series of topics. Dean Gartland, prayed for City Mission. Manager of Church and Community Relations, Shelley Kubincanek, prayed for our local churches. Dr. Sally Mounts prayed for the military. Chief Financial Officer, Denny Kennedy, prayed for the state of Pennsylvania. Director of Development, Trisha Schum, prayed for the United States. Pastor Lance Whitlock, our Manager of Menâs Services, prayed for peace. RSS Supervisor/Chaplain, Jared Nolan, prayed for faith, and Volunteer Manager, Amanda Blakemore, prayed for children. The theme for this yearâs event was: Lift up the Word. Light up the World, and each speaker presented a unique twist on the theme. âThe churches in our community are such a beacon of light to each and every one of us,â said Shelley Kubincanek during her prayer for our local churches. âIn todayâs world where there is so much darkness, we need patience, kindness, humility more now than ever.â During Lance Whitlockâs prayer for peace, he explained, âItâs been said that weâre either going into a storm, we are currently in a storm, or weâre just coming out of a storm, but in the midst of it all, Jesus still speaks peace.â It was a beautiful ceremony to highlight the need for Godâs grace to shine down on us all so that we, in turn, have the capacity to give grace to others.\n\nThe Sweetest Sunday\n\nIn 1994, a group of City Mission volunteers and board members had a sweet idea! Sweet Sunday co-founders, Cindy Pfrimmer and Phyllis Ross began meeting regularly to discuss fundraising ideas, and one day, over a cup of coffee, the idea for the Sweet Sunday Dessert Festival was born. The first Sweet Sunday was held at the Holiday Inn on Racetrack Road in Washington. There were dessert vendors, celebrity judges, kidsâ activities, auction items, raffle baskets, and a line-up of live entertainers â the same event framework that we still use today. The premiere sponsor that year was Dr. Ron Salvitti, a local ophthalmologist and founder of the Southwestern PA Eye Care Center. Remarkably, Dr. Salvitti and his group at Southwest PA Eye Center have continued to sponsor Sweet Sunday every single year for the past 30 years. Bob Gregg from WJPA helped to promote that first Sweet Sunday, and to this day, he still helps promote Sweet Sunday. For the past 20 years, he has also broadcast live from the event, conducting interviews and making live announcements. Ross and Pfrimmer were expecting 500 guests at the very first Sweet Sunday, but an astounding 1500 showed up! The dessert festival has grown every year since then and has become City Missionâs largest fundraiser of the year and one of the premiere winter events in Washington County. This year, City Missionâs thirtieth anniversary presented by MPLX, is expecting over 3200 guests, 27 dessert vendors, and an amazing schedule of live entertainment, featuring Scott Blasey of The Clarks. As always, there will be raffle baskets, auction items, the cafÃ©, Kids Korner complete with your favorite characters from Royal Princess Engagements, and all the sweets you can possibly imagine! This yearâs event will take place on Sunday, February 25 from 12-5pm at the Hilton Garden Inn at Southpointe. All proceeds support City Missionâs life-transforming programs and services for the homeless. Sweet Sunday is the sweetest way you can help those in need in your community.

He was always doing something or going somewhere. On Monday October 9th, Doug made his final trip and went home to be with the one who changed and transformed his life, Jesus Christ. Doug was surrounded by family and friends when he made his final journey. Doug faithfully served City Mission in Washington, PA for over 24 years. His love for the work, and most importantly for God, showed in every moment of his day. He was a tireless advocate for individuals in recovery and his message of hope and testimony of faith have been heard around the globe. Doug served in many roles during his over two-decade time at City Mission: in the donations center; in the Programs department; and served as Chaplain - he touched countless lives in all his roles. Dougâs laugh and presence could be felt in any room and this helped him make connections, too numerous to list. He then turned those connections into help for many people finding their way into recovery and into church homes. Doug always took time for people - whether it was stopping to pray with someone, taking a phone call, or sending a text message. If he couldnât help with something, he always found someone who could. He served in the community through his ministry as the Pastor of Legacy Recovery Church - a part of Legacy Church International. He presided over many weddings and even more baptisms in the City Missionâs Porter Pillow and Peggy Beaver Pillow Chapel. Doug leaves a legacy of love, grace, and faith. No one will be able to replace Doug Bush. But together we can continue his work: by sharing the love of God with those who are hurting; giving one another grace; and remembering that a smile goes a long way. There is a section of scripture that reminds me of Doug. It is found in Mathew chapter 25 versus 35 â 36, âfor I was hungry and you gave Me food, I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in; I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.â For me, this verse describes Doug Bush. He will be greatly missed. Arrangements for Doug Bush are as follows: ï Viewing: Friday, October 13th from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM and 6:00 to 8:00 PM ï Funeral: Saturday, October 14th at 11:00 AM doors open at 10:00 AM All of the Above will be held at Life Church 100 North Main Street, Washington, PA 15301 After Service Meal: Saturday, October 14th, 12:30pm at City Mission, 84 W. Wheeling St, Washington, PA For those wanting to honor Doug and his Christ-focused legacy, the family requests making donations to either City Mission (www.citymission.org or by check to address listed above) or by check to Legacy Church International, 200 N Forrest Ave., Washington, PA 15301, noting Doug Bush in memorial. In His Name, Dean R. Gartland, MS On behalf of City Mission staff Friend of Doug Bush and President/CEO of City Mission\n\n\"An Unforgettable Experience\"\n\nâHomeless and veteran are two words that should never be in the same sentence,â City Mission Chief Development Officer, Dr. Sally Mounts, said to the crowd at the 1st Annual Washington County Warriors Rock Concert on Thursday, September 28 at Wild Things Stadium. âBut unfortunately, veteran homelessness is a reality, and because of that, we have an obligation to help. Thatâs why the City Mission has created the Crabtree Kovacicek Veterans House for homeless veterans. We hope that you all support our veterans, and just by being here tonight, you are helping us.â Proceeds from the rockinâ evening benefit City Missionâs Crabtree Kovacicek Veterans House and the 22 homeless veterans looking to turn their lives around at the Mission. Despite the gloomy, rainy weather, there was a good crowd at the event, safe and dry under a huge tent in the outfield grass of the stadium. After a helicopter flyover, flown by a local veteran, 11-year-old local singer, Josie Salvitti, sang the National Anthem. And then Gary Racan and the Studio E Band took the stage. They sang a variety of songs from all eras and genres. So there was something for everyone to enjoy. Woven in between the songs were video presentations featuring local veterans sharing the stories of their military service. Paul Karpan was the first veteran to be featured. He is a 101-year-old World War II veteran. Jim Balog, a US Army Aviation veteran, told the harrowing story of his helicopter crash during the Vietnam conflict. Dr. Dan Ravasio, veteran of the US Army Medical Corps, told the tale of helping to save the life of a female pilot who was the sole survivor of a helicopter crash during the war in Iraq. The woman whose life was saved is now a US Senator. Each veteran chose a song that had special meaning for them and the military service, and the Studio-E Band would play it. Paul Karpan, the WWII veteran, chose âIn The Moodâ by Glenn Miller. Dr. Ravasio selected âPiano Manâ by Billy Joel. Jim Balog requested âRiders on the Stormâ by The Doors. The event flowed smoothly and was incredibly compelling from start to finish. The most emotional part of the night was a presentation by a Gold Star Family. Judi Kovacicek and her daughter Renae Salvitti honored US Marine Lance Corporal Ryan Kovacicek who was killed in combat in Hit, Iraq in 2005. The story of their beloved son and brother was so moving that there wasnât a dry eye in the house. The event culminated in a celebration of every veteran in attendance and a firework display. It was truly a beautiful and memorable night. We would like to thank everyone involved with the event: John and Michaela Salvitti who spearheaded the event, Gary and Kim Racan and the Studio E Band for their enthralling performances and presentations, all the veterans who participated, Wild Things Stadium for hosting the event, all of the many event sponsors who made the evening possible, everyone who braved the weather to attend the event, all the volunteers, and everyone who pitched-in in any way to make this benefit concert such a resounding success! âWarriors Rock was an unforgettable experience for everyone who attended,â said Dr. Mounts, âmoving and meaningful, and a ton of fun!â\n\nMission Possible VIII\n\nCity Missionâs eighth annual Mission Possible 5K Run/1 Mile Walk, presented by AccuTrex Products, Inc. and benefiting the Crabtree Kovacicek Veterans House for homeless veterans, will be held at Peterswood Park in Venetia on Saturday, August 5 at 8am. âThis is a unique run because it was conceived to benefit a shelter for homeless veterans, and veterans feature prominently in the opening ceremonies and the event itself,â said City Mission Chief Development Officer, Dr. Sally Mounts, a retired Lt. Colonel in the US Army. The event was started eight years ago by Jeff McCartney, a local realtor and board member for the City Mission Board of Directors, as a way to raise funds in support of City Missionâs Crabtree Kovacicek Veterans House, which opened in July 2018 and houses 22 homeless veterans, helping to restore them to independent living. Once again, this yearâs Presenting Sponsor for the event is AccuTrex Products, Inc., a manufacturing company headquartered in Canonsburg. AccuTrex President and CEO, Marty Beichner, was named Pittsburghâs Vetrepeneur of the Year in 2020, a prestigious honor presented annually to one of the regionâs outstanding veteran business owners. âMarty and his wife Judy are long-time supporters of City Mission,â said Sally Mounts. âMarty was a Corpsman on the ground in Vietnam with the 2nd Battalion 26th Marines, and he understands veteransâ needs at such a visceral level.â US Army veteran, John, came to live at City Mission last September and found new life at the Crabtree-Kovacicek Veterans House. Before coming to the Mission, he desperately needed surgery. He was fighting every day through the pain. Since coming to the Crabtree-Kovacicek Veterans House, John has had four life-changing operations. The Mission supported him in his healing process by transporting him to and from medical appointments, connecting him with Veteransâ services and benefits, visiting him in the hospital, giving him meals and a place to sleep for as long as needed, and offering him love and encouragement at every step along the way. Now, he is on the road to recovery, but the Mission didnât just help him physically. âI thought I came to the Mission because I needed surgery,â John said, âbut God brought me here to learn lessons of humility and faith and trust. The people here have really been a blessing for me. The Mission has helped me to heal, and it has also given me an opportunity to be of service to God by serving others.â As a resident assistant in the Crabtree House, John helps mentor the other residents and supports new residents as they learn about and acclimate to our program. He also volunteers in our Career Training and Education Center where he helps City Mission residents obtain identification cards and find a job that is right for them. âThe Vets program at City Mission is awesome,â John said. âThere is a group of people coming together with common knowledge of whatâs available for veterans. And the staff here is really looking to see you succeed, and itâs all out of love. Iâm glad that I came to City Mission. Iâm glad that Iâve met the people that Iâve met here.â At City Missionâs veterans shelter, John has restored physically, but he has also renewed his sense of faith, purpose, dignity, and belonging. You can help other veterans just like John turn their lives around. Learn more or register today for the eighth annual Mission Possible 5K Run/1 Mile Walk at www.missionpossiblerun.org."
