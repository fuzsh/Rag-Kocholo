I’m watching the news after dinner when he comes to me holding a plastic sleeve of orange cheddar slices.\n\n“There are four slices of cheese missing,” he reports.\n\nBorn in 1929, the son of refugees, he has always been thrifty, saving the rubber bands from vegetables, sucking every fiber of meat from a bone, picking up grains of sugar from the table with a licked finger. I anticipate a complaint about my mother eating too much cheese.\n\nInstead he informs me, “It says on the package there are eleven slices. But they only gave us seven!”\n\nI try to clear up his confusion: “It’s not a brand new package.”\n\n“But I just opened it.”\n\n“No you didn’t. I opened it last week. We’ve eaten four slices. I made Mom a grilled cheese for lunch.”\n\nThe cheddar’s high level of sodium endangers his heart, so I had made him a sandwich with mozzarella instead. He’s unaware of the substitution, just as my grandmother didn’t know, decades before, that he taped shut the holes in her salt shaker. An industrial appraiser, he was always coming up with mechanical solutions. Now the zip lock seal on the cheese slices has confounded him, the package appearing as new.\n\nThis is the dance of dementia. Everyday tasks need elaborate explanation till they don’t matter. But now it’s imperative that he understand. This is why we wash our hands for twenty seconds. This is why old people must stay at home. This is why we didn’t wear masks but now we should. I have trouble understanding myself.\n\n“Four slices are missing!” he insists. “We have a lawsuit here!”\n\nThough one small part of my brain chuckles, most of my mind is fatigued. My father encouraged me as a child to write letters to the editor, to speak up against wrongdoing. How can he not understand there are more pressing matters outside our quarantine?\n\nThere are not enough masks. Tests are scarce. Black and brown people are disproportionately dying. As of today, over 30,000 people have died and roughly 600,000 people have been infected in the U.S. They are numbers, sterile, appearing on the tv screen. Not 1.5 million, I tell myself. At least they’re not as bad as our own private genocide.\n\nClose to 200 folks lost their lives in Massachusetts today. The state lists the dead by their age. There are usually a few in their 50s. A bunch in their 80s. Today there are several 100s. Who are they? Old people who were going to die soon anyway, unable to count their last breaths.\n\n“Why did you even open this?” I ask my father. “Are you hungry?”\n\n“I opened it because it says there are eleven slices and they only gave us seven!”\n\nI listen to his rage, a flag ripping in the wind. Our ability to fathom unimaginable loss, like a few slabs of cheese—missing.\n\nNancy Agabian is a writer, teacher, and literary organizer, working in the spaces between race, ethnicity, cultural identity, feminism and queer identity.

She takes the seat\n\nacross the aisle from me, slides over to the window.\n\nAt Downers Grove, she checks her watch,\n\npulls her cell phone from her purse.\n\nHello, Sweetheart. Are you already awake?\n\nHow are you feeling? Good! Did you sleep well?\n\nI laid your school clothes out for you on your chair.\n\nDon’t forget to brush your teeth. Will you do that for Mommy?\n\nThat’s my girl.\n\nThe Hinsdale station flashes by the window. We’re an express\n\nto Chicago now. Everyone around us sleeps, heads pulled into scarves,\n\ninto coats against the cold.\n\nYour breakfast is on the counter.\n\nBe sure to put the milk back in the fridge.\n\nYes, I miss Daddy, too.\n\nYes, I know. Me, too.\n\nMe, too.\n\nYou’d better get ready now. Mrs. Hennipen will be there soon\n\nto walk you to the bus. Don’t forget your key. It’s on your necklace.\n\nBrookfield passes.\n\nI love you, too, Sweetheart.\n\nHave a good day at school. ‘Bye.\n\nClutching the phone like a talisman,\n\nshe leans her head against the window;\n\nfalls asleep, nodding slighting\n\nin the lights of the stations we pass.\n\nJohn Hicks is a New Mexico poet.
