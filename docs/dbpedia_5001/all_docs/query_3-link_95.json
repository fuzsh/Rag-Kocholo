        "text": "By Gregory Sirico\n\nWarwick, NY. Ten years ago, Warwick and North Rockland Athletic programs created the Wounded Warrior Challenge where most spring teams compete on the same day with the intention of raising money and awareness for the Wounded Warrior Project. Saturday’s event on the Warwick campus did not disappoint from Wounded Warrior Project Speaker Jacob Norotsky to the competitiveness of every game…it was an exciting day for all. The Wildcats prevailed, winning the overall title and have won 3 of the last 4 years. North Rockland still holds the overall record recording 5 wins to Warwick’s 3 and one tie.\n\nWarwick boys lacrosse overcame a 4 – 3 halftime deficit to earn a win and the jv boys lacrosse team also won. Warwick girls varsity lacrosse lost a close game 9 – 7 and the jv girls earned the win 9 – 8. Varsity baseball battled back from an early deficit too but came up just short while the jv team played tough but earned a loss for the Wildcats. Varsity softball defeated the undefeated Red Raiders 1 – 0 and the jv girls lost a 2 -1 game. Tennis defeated North Rockland 4 – 3 in a very close match. The final school winner came down to golf…the girls team tied North Rockland and the boys pulled through for a 2 stroke win giving the Wildcats the overall title.\n\nThank you to the many volunteers that made the day special including students Alex Morse, Elizabeth Laino, Casey Fox, Nadia Ali and Kaylyann Mela. Roy Quackenbush came in early to prep the fields and parents Lindsay Frederick, Margaret Accardo, Kellyann Hennessy, Lori Sirico, Tara Judd and Tyler Frederick (MS student) helped with event coordination.\n\nThe event raised thousands of dollars for the Wounded Warrior Project Charity whose first office was in the clocktower building on Main Street in Warwick, New York. Many are already looking forward to next years event on the North Rockland Campus."
