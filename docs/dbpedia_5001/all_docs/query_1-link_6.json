        "text": "As we reflect on the events of the past weeks, the protests and demonstrations, the resulting conversations that are being had, in towns and cities, in the classroom and the boardroom, with family and friends, among black, brown and white people, across generations, the issues of racism and our societal flaws have become swiftly exposed.\n\nOne of the opportunities and essentials in front of us is to reflect on how we think about what we do, respond to the circumstances we face and reconsider the decisions we make. This requires us to revisit (or in some cases explore for the first time) the essentials of critical thinking.\n\nHow often do we examine how we think? Think about our biases, whether conscious or unconscious? Review the evidence that supports our decisions? Look at the accuracy of what we are thinking about doing? Reflect on the preciseness of our thinking or the assumptions we may have? Or even at the start, articulating clearly (even in our own minds) what are we trying to solve for? These are some of the essentials of critical thinking.\n\nWhile there are differing opinions of what critical thinking is (Korn, 2014), this one is especially provocative,\n\n“Thinking about your thinking, while you’re thinking, in order to improve your thinking.” Linda Elder, educational psychologist; president,Foundation for Critical Thinking.\n\nEmployers have long called out that students coming off of the college campuses are ill prepared when it come to critical thinking skills. (Belkin, Douglas, 2017) Even applying this more specifically, in a quantitative research study I conducted when I started teaching at the graduate level, critical thinking was the #1 skill that was identified as most important for long term success in the public relations practice. (Strayer, Jacqueline, 2016)\n\nBut when was the last time you actually engaged in critical thinking? Or were offered training on how to do it? And like emotional intelligence, critical thinking is one of those skills each of us can get better at.\n\nThe examination of our thinking, including importantly our decisions, whether they are in the boardroom or the family room, are vital for us to have productive and meaningful conversations about race, equality and making necessary swift progress. Being aware of our biases, assumptions and our interpretations of information is vital.\n\nSo, what must we do? We must embrace critical thinking, at every level. This means the teaching of critical thinking has to start in elementary school, so children examine what they think and how they see the world and make judgments about others and decisions in life. It must be taught in higher education as we prepare students for their careers and becoming the future leaders across the globe. And it must be taught in business, government, education and the non-profit world so that the decisions that are being made in those organizations are made with the highest level of thinking. And finally, and most importantly, it must be exhibited, taught and reinforced in the home, so we model the way and raise our children to examine their thoughts and ideas, confront bias and assumptions and give them freedom to become their very best selves. This is our moral imperative.\n\nReferences\n\nBelkin, Douglas (2017) “Exclusive test data: Many colleges fail to improve critical-thinking skills.” Wall Street Journal.\n\nKorn, Melissa.
