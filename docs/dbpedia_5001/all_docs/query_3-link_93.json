        "text": "My mom walked into my kitchen with a fistful of small sunflowers — the woodland wild ones that are so powerful they grow out of sidewalk cracks, highway medians and tree trunks. Dirt was dripping off of the freshly pulled roots, all over my kitchen floor.\n\n“Mother. What’s going on here?”\n\n“They were about to mow the empty lot so I asked if I could pull these and put them in your yard,” Mom said.\n\nI ushered her out the front door, dirt trailing her like a lost puppy.\n\n“I’ll just put them next to the wildflowers,” she said, digging a hole with her fingers and stuffing the roots into the ground.\n\nSpoiler alert: They died.\n\nWhen early spring arrives, I find the perfect time to spread my seeds (watch your mouth). I turn it into a dance party in the front yard and crush the stems and deadheads into the ground. I’m out there a-twistin’ and a-groovin’, shakin’ and a-movin’, smashing those seeds into the soil. (Usually with a mason jar of wine. Gotta keep warm.) My cosmos return every year, springing back into nearly 4-foot knock-out beauties.\n\nThis year, to my sheer pleasure, mom’s dead sunflowers from last year sprouted in all their glory. Three different plants are spitting out more than a dozen yellow faces, with flower buds popping up daily.\n\nMom was very proud of her accomplishment. So proud that she walked into my kitchen last week with a fistful of giant sunflowers. The ones that sprout up to 10 feet. They were nearly as tall as her.\n\n“Mother.”\n\n“I pulled these out of my community garden plot and want to plant them in your yard.”\n\nDirt following her through the house, I walked her out front and she did her thing.\n\nSpoiler alert: They died.\n\nNever fear, when I have my spring dance party in the front yard, I have high hopes that by next year at this time, I’ll have giant sunflowers that tower over my 6-foot-1-inch frame.\n\nAwkward tangent: Perhaps you read that Prairie Mountain Media is shuttering its 60,000-square-foot printing plant in Berthoud. The production of its newspapers, including Colorado Hometown Weekly, will be printed at The Denver Post’s production facility in Denver. Since Denver can’t print our current size, we’re going bigger.\n\nStarting next week, the Colorado Hometown Weekly will move to a broadsheet format.\n\nThink of it like a giant sunflower: long vertical pages with a big beautiful face. Plus, you can look trendy at the coffee shop, like you’re reading the New York Times or the Chicago Tribune.\n\n“Pay no heed,” you’ll tell passersby, “I’m just reading this cool local rag. You should get your hands on one. Everybody’s doing it. I’m currently enjoying it with my tea and crumpets.”\n\nThanks for reading and see you next week, bigger and always better."
