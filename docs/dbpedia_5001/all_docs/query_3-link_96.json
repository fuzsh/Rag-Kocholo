        "text": "SALT LAKE CITY, UT (Ivanhoe Newswire) – Whether you had a heart attack, bypass surgery, stents or have any type of heart condition, often cardiac rehab will be prescribed to help strengthen your heart. Until now, it was only for adults. But what about the 40,000 babies born with heart problems? Now a new type of cardiac rehab is being used for the youngest heart patients.\n\nTo say Ethan Delcid enjoys life is an understatement! But it’s been a long journey for this little guy.\n\nHis mom, Yannin Delcid says, “It was hard to see him be born ‘cause he was immediately taken away.”\n\nBlood was not flowing properly from his heart, Ethan had surgery at three days old, then again at three months. At four, Ethan needed a heart transplant.\n\n“I saw him very close to death, so it was hard to hold my faith up,” says Yannin.\n\nDen Ziebell, MD, pediatric cardiologist at the University of Utah and Primary Children’s Hospital explained, “He was getting physically weaker, and then there were some like mental health side effects of that.”\n\nThat’s when a team at Intermountain Primary Children’s Hospital turned to pediatric cardiac rehab. Just like the rehab for adults who have heart problems, only this cardiac fitness center turns grueling workouts into fun.\n\n“We were trying to keep it fun and interactive, make it seem like it’s play for him,” says Dr. Ziebell.\n\nWhile living in the hospital for more than a year — exercise physiologists helped to get Ethan’s heart pumping and stronger for surgery. And after 14 months — Ethan was ready when the call came.\n\n“You would never know that he has heart transplant,” says Dr. Ziebell.\n\nEthan is now ready to take on his next big challenge — kindergarten.\n\n“I’m a warrior!” exclaims Ethan.\n\nThe pediatric cardiac fitness center at Intermountain Primary Children’s Hospital is one of the first in the country, but they are beginning to pop up all over. Every child who is hospitalized with heart failure gets enrolled into the program, from age three to 18 years old.\n\nContributors to this news report include: Marsha Lewis, Producer; Matt Goldschmidt, Videographer; Roque Correa, Editor.\n\nSubscribe to our News 10 newsletter and YouTube page to receive the latest local news and weather.
