        "text": "BREAKING: Good journalism costs money.\n\nAnd we need a lot of both right now. We’re short of our August goal of $163,000 in online donations, and it’s not going to get any easier next month when election noise and news will be even louder. You know what’s at stake. And you know Mother Jones is up for it. Will you pitch in now so we can do our best work?\n\nMonika Bauerlein is the Center for Investigative Reporting’s CEO, and prior to that role she served as Mother Jones’ chief executive officer, and co-editor (with Clara Jeffery).
