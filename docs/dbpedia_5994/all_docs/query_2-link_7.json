        "text": "Recently, in a fit of tidy-mindedness, I went through my digital files to see if there was anything I could consign to the Recycle Bin. My eye fell on a folder entitled ‘East Yorkshire Regiment’. I hadn’t looked at this for ages. More years ago than I care to recall, my late and much-missed friend Peter Lawrence told me that he’d had a ‘good idea’. Pete was good at good ideas. \"I think we should take a British infantry regiment and find out what happened to its Regular officers who were on the Active List in August 1914,\" he explained.[1] \"Good idea,\" I replied. \"Which regiment?\" We decided that Pete would \"choose one at random\". I don’t know what random method of selection he adopted. I suspect it involved a list, a blindfold and a pin. Fate fell upon the East Yorkshire Regiment. Pete was very much a man of the Midlands and had no connections with Yorkshire or previous interest in the East Yorkshire Regiment. He began the preliminary work, but died tragically young before he got very far. The project was eventually put to one side, where it has remained until now. I decided to revisit Peter’s work and add to it, something made much easier by the transformational possibilities of the internet.\n\nThe Regular Battalions of the East Yorkshire Regiment\n\nThe East Yorkshire Regiment, like most British infantry regiments, had two Regular battalions, one stationed at home and one stationed abroad.\n\nThe 1st Battalion was based at York. It was mobilised as part of the BEF, in 18 Brigade (Brigadier-General E.C. Ingouville-Williams), 6th Division (Major-General J.L. Keir).[2] It moved to Edinburgh on 8 August, then to Cambridge on 14 August, landing at St Nazaire on 10 September 1914. It thus missed the early fighting and the Retreat from Mons. The Battalion’s commanding officer was Lieutenant-Colonel R.E. Benson.\n\nAbove: Lieutenant-Colonel R.E. Benson\n\nHe had been appointed CO on 15 August 1911 at the age of 48. This was par for the course with regard to infantry battalion command appointments in the Edwardian army. Ordinarily, Benson could have expected to serve a four-year tour as CO, ending in August 1915, before being promoted to full colonel, at which point his career would either have stalled or he would have moved on to a higher appointment or command.[3] As he had not passed staff college, the latter was unlikely.[4] The 1st Battalion joined the war in earnest on 19 September 1914 on the Aisne before being heavily engaged in the battle of Armentières (13 October-2 November), during the so-called ‘race to the sea’. The battalion was not involved in any of the major British offensives of 1915. 6th Division’s only engagement in 1915 to attract the notice of the post-war Battles Nomenclature Committee was ‘Hooge’, an insalubrious place and the site of the notorious German ‘liquid fire’ attack of 9 August 1915. On 26 November 1915 1st East Yorkshire (by then under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel J.L.J. Clarke)[5] was transferred to 64 Brigade (Brigadier G.M. Gloster), 21st Division (Major-General C.W. Jacob), as part of the rebuilding of 21st Division, following its disastrous baptism of fire at Loos. 1st East Yorkshire remained with 21st Division for the rest of the war.[6]\n\nIn August1914 the 2nd Battalion was based at Kamptee in India, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel M.J. Sweetman. It was recalled from imperial service, landing in England in December 1914, assembling as part of 83 Brigade (Brigadier-General R.C. Boyle), 28th Division (Major-General E.S. Bulfin) at Hursley Park, near Winchester. The battalion landed at Le Havre on 16 January 1915. Having been rushed from the heat of India to the cold and damp of northern France in the space of a few weeks the battalion experienced considerable problems of adjustment, suffering badly from frostbite.[7] Its first major action was on 22 and 23 April 1915, during the German gas attack against the Gravenstafel Ridge, followed by further fighting round Ypres, at St Julien (24 April-4 May 1915), on the Frezenberg Ridge (8-13 May 1915) (where it did well) and on the Bellwaarde Ridge (24 and 25 May 1915). The nature of the fighting was an unrelenting series of attacks and counter-attacks that belied the neat demarcations of the Battles Nomenclature Committee and was characterised by the Official History as ‘desperate fighting in a desperate position at the point of a salient’.[8] 28th Division’s time on the Western Front concluded with its participation in the battle of Loos (27 September-5 October), when it continually fell foul of the GOC I Corps, Hubert Gough.[9] Bulfin, who went home during the battle, recalled the experience of Loos as ‘a sort of horrid nightmare’.[10] On 26 October 1915 28th Division was transferred to the new Salonika theatre. 2nd East Yorkshire (by then under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel W.A. Blake)[11] sailed from Marseilles, arriving at Alexandria on 3 November and Salonika on 3 December. The battalion remained at Salonika for the rest of the war.\n\nThis pattern was not atypical of the experience of Regular infantry battalions. Eight Regular battalions (out of a total of 155) remained in India throughout the war.[12] A further 38 battalions served for the whole or part of the war away from the Western Front.[13]\n\nThe East Yorkshires’ Regular Officers\n\nIn August 1914 there were 66 Regular officers in the East Yorkshire Regiment: two lieutenant-colonels; eight majors; twenty captains; twenty-five lieutenants; and eleven second lieutenants. To these should be added another two second lieutenants who received Regular commissions in August 1914, but after the declaration of war. Both deployed to France in September 1914, but with the 2nd Battalion Duke of Wellington’s Regiment. There were also three Special Reserve officers, all second lieutenants, listed under ‘1st and 2nd Battalions’.[14] Most officers were shown as attached either to the 1st or 2nd Battalions, though a number were on extra-regimental or extra-battalion duties. Major J.L.J. Clarke was DAA&QMG Coast Defences, Eastern Command. Captain T.A. Headlam was an Instructor (GSO3) at the School of Musketry, India. Captain C.P. Berthon was Adjutant of the 3rd(Reserve) Battalion East Yorkshire Regiment. Captain F.H. Harvey and Lieutenant J.A.F. Mair were shown as employed with the Army Signal Service, but in fact Harvey had been a student at the Staff College since 22 January 1914. He was among a number of officers who were considered to have passed staff college following the outbreak of war.[15] Captain J.B.O. Trimble and Lieutenant M.B. Stow were serving with the Indian Volunteers, Trimble as Adjutant. Lieutenant W.S. Browne and Lieutenant J.B. Porter were serving with the West African Regiment. Lieutenant R. Wallace was Superintendent of Physical Training, India.\n\nAbove: Lieutenant (later Captain) Robert Wallace (died of wounds 6 May 1915)\n\nA few officers, although officially attached to one or other of the Regular battalions, were not currently serving with them. Major H.G.A. Moore (2nd Battalion) was commanding the regimental depot in Beverley and attached to the 3rd Battalion. Captains E.F. Twiss (2nd Battalion), A.R. Kino (1st Battalion) and D.G. Wrangham (2nd Battalion), Lieutenants J.H. Coles (2nd Battalion) and A. Grant (1st Battalion) were all also attached to the 3rd Battalion.\n\nAbove: Major Henry Moore (died as the result of a bayonet wound at Suvla Bay, 9 August 1915)\n\nThe twenty-four officers actually serving with 1st Battalion in August 1914 were, therefore: Lieutenant-Colonel R.E. Benson (CO); Majors W.H. Young and W.E. Campion; Captains B.W. Bogle, A.H. Wilson, E.L.P. Edwards, B. Lawrence, D.F. Anderson (Adjutant), F. Hind, M.G. Cowper and P.B. Maxwell; Lieutenants C.L. Leadley-Brown, V.E. Inglefield, F.H. Sasse, J.A. Markham, H.S.F. Cosens and N.V. Blacker; 2nd Lieutenants G.R. Smallwood, P. Clutterbuck, T.M. Robson, R.T.F. Scott, F. Carruthers, H.L. Willats and J.A. Hartcup. Three of these officers did not proceed with the battalion to France. Cowper, Carruthers and Willats were retained at home to help with raising and training the New Army, a pattern repeated throughout the battalions of the original BEF. They were replaced by three Special Reserve Officers, 2nd Lieutenants M.R. Pease, A.W. Meller and T.R. Bottomley, and by Lieutenant Hutchinson, who despite being listed as a 2nd Battalion officer, deployed to France with the 1st Battalion. This takes the number of officers who landed in France to twenty-five.[16]\n\nThe 2nd Battalion’s twenty-six officers were: Lieutenant-Colonel M.J. Sweetman (CO); Majors W.H. Armstrong, H.H. Powell, T.R.E.W. Warren-Swettenham and W.N. Pike; Captains O.C. Wilkinson, C.P.B. Riall, L.G. Hill, R.S. Hopkins and K.T. Woodmass; Lieutenants E.A. Bray, G.D.A. Douglas, K.A. Plimpton, H.F. Wailes (Adjutant), H.C.R. Saunders, A.G. Ottley, B.S.C. Hutchinson, W.W.B. Broadley, J.B.L. Noel, M. Eccles, A.E.C. Cart de Lafontaine and H.J. Hardiman; 2nd Lieutenants F.G. Prichard, O.J. Addyman, E.S. Wilson and P.N. Kennard. As we have seen, Lieutenant Hutchinson deployed with the 1st Battalion even though listed as being with the 2nd. Lieutenant Eccles transferred to the Indian Army on 13 August 1914, while 2nd Battalion was still In India. Major Armstrong was transferred to France to take command of 1st Battalion following the death of Colonel Benson. Armstrong held the command for only eight days (11-19 November 1914) before he himself was wounded, never to hold a command again. According to its War Diary, 2nd Battalion deployed to France on 16 January 1915 with twenty-six officers. The Diary, alas, does not provide a definitive list of who the twenty-six officers were, but we know that Lieutenant-Colonel Sweetman was CO. The company commanders were Major T.R.E.W. Warren-Swettenham, “A” Coy; Captain L.G. Hill, “B” Coy; Captain O.C. Wilkinson, “C” Coy; and Major W.N. Pike, “D” Coy. The Adjutant was Captain H.F. Wailes. Lieutenant O.G. Ottley was Machine Gun Officer.\n\nA Bloody War\n\nThe early fighting had a devastating effect on the 1st Battalion’s officers and not just the junior ones. Colonel Benson was wounded in what Peter Hodgkinson has described as 'a futile charge’ on 20 September and died a week later. Captain E.L.P. Edwards, OC “B” Coy, was killed on 20 September, Captain A.H. Wilson, OC “D” Coy, on 18 October, and Major W.E. Campion, OC “A” Coy, on 28 October.\n\nAbove: Captain Eric Edwards\n\nAbove: Major W.E. Campion\n\nBy the end of October, Captain B.W. Bogle was the only one of the original company commanders left alive. Two of “A” Coy’s officers, 2nd Lieutenants P. Clutterbuck and A.W. Meller, were killed on 20 September.\n\nAbove: 2nd Lieutenant Peter Clutterbuck\n\nIn 'B' Coy, Lieutenant B.S.C. Hutchinson was also killed on 20 September. Captain P.B. Maxwell died of his wounds on 24 September. ‘Pat’ Maxwell was one of the most promising officers in the East Yorkshire Regiment. He passed first out of Sandhurst in 1900, ‘being awarded the Queen Victoria Gold Medal, the Sword of Honour, and field glasses for proficiency in tactics’.\n\nAbove: Captain Peter ('Pat') Maxwell\n\nHe had combat experience on the North West Frontier of India during his service with the 35th Sikhs. He passed staff college in December 1913 in a cohort that included E.H.L. ‘Moses’ Beddington, L.E.O. Charlton, J.K. Dick-Cunyngham, H.C.T. Dowding, C.H. Foot, C.P. ‘Guffin’ Heywood, R.F.A. Hobbs, H. Karslake, G.H.N. Jackson, A.E. McNamara, E.N. Tandy and G.A. Weir, who went on to have significant careers during the Great War, and – in the case of Hugh Dowding – beyond. Trained staff officers were small in number in the British Army and their abilities at a premium. Losing one during the first clash of battle looks like carelessness. In “C” Coy, Lieutenant T.R. Bottomley was killed on 23 September, Captain B. Lawrence and Lieutenant H.S.F. Cosens on 27 October.\n\nAbove: Lieutenant T.R. Bottomley\n\nAbove: Lieutenant Harold Cosens\n\nThe OC 'C' Coy, Captain Bogle, and 2nd Lieutenant Robson were both wounded. In 'D' Coy, 2nd Lieutenant M.R. Pease was killed on 20 October and Captain F. Hind died of his wounds on 29 October. Of 'D' Coy’s original complement of officers only Lieutenant V.E. Inglefield survived the war.\n\nAbove: 2nd Lieutenant Mark Pease\n\nAbove: Captain Frank Hind\n\n6th Division was not heavily engaged in 1915, but the usual round of trench warfare continued to take its toll of the 1914 Regulars. 2nd Lieutenant R.T.F. Scott was killed on 16 March 1915.[17] Lieutenants J.A. Markham and F.H. Sasse died of their wounds, Markham on 7 May 1915 and Sasse on 8 May 1915. Thus, within less than ten months from the declaration of war, 1st Battalion East Yorkshire Regiment had lost sixteen of its original twenty-five officers, including its CO.[18]\n\nAbove: 2nd Lieutenant (later Lieutenant) Richard Scott\n\nAbove: Lt Frederick Sasse\n\nOverall, as Peter Hodgkinson has pointed out, ‘83 percent of [1st East Yorkshire’s] company officers who arrived in France had become casualties’.[19] It is difficult to disagree with Spencer Jones’s conclusion that the fighting of 1914 ‘had torn the heart’ from the pre-war Regular officer corps.[20]\n\nThe impact of combat was just as devastating on the 2nd Battalion as it was on the 1st. By the end of February five officers had been killed, including the OCs “A”, “B” and “C” Coys, and five wounded, including the Adjutant. 2nd Lieutenant Addyman was killed on 4 February by the same shell that wounded his company commander, Captain Wilkinson, who died the following day. Captain Warren-Swettenham was killed on 6 February. Captain Hill was killed on 17 February.\n\nAbove: 2nd Lieutenant (later Lieutenant) Oscar James Addyman\n\nAbove: Major Thomas Robert Eaton Wybault Warren-Swettenham\n\nBy the end of April the number of officers killed had risen to eleven, with seventeen wounded and one missing. The fatalities included two more ‘originals’, Captain Woodmass, killed on 23 April, and Lieutenant Ottley, killed on 22 May 1915.\n\nAbove: Captain Kenrick Talbot Woodmass\n\nThe War Diary listed the battalion’s officers on 30 June 1915. None of them was a 2nd Battalion officer from the August 1914 Army List: eight of the twenty-five officers named were not even East Yorkshires. A further two ‘originals’ were killed later in 1915, 2nd Lieutenant Prichard on 9 August and 2nd Lieutenant Wilson on 29 September. A further three were killed later in the war, Lieutenant Cart de Lafontaine on 9 July 1916, 2nd Lieutenant Kennard on 14 July 1916 and Lieutenant Saunders on 30 March 1918,[21] bringing the total number of fatalities from the original twenty-six officers to eleven.\n\nAbove: 2nd Lieutenant Frederic Prichard\n\nAbove: Lieutenant Cart de Lafontaine\n\nAbove: Lieutenant (later Major) Harold Cecil Richard (‘Sam’) Saunders DSO\n\nProfessional Opportunity?\n\nRichard Holmes once said to me that ‘all you needed to do to become a brigade commander in the BEF at the end of the war was to have been a Regular subaltern in August 1914 and still be alive’. When I tested this statement, it turned out not to be quite true. The principal start rank of the BEF’s brigade commanders at the end of the war was actually Captain. But Richard was right in essence, if not in fact. His statement captures not only the damaging early impact of the war on the Regular officer corps but also the professional opportunities it opened up for those fortunate enough to have survived. How well did the surviving Regular officers of the East Yorkshire Regiment fare in the professional opportunity stakes? The answer is not especially well.\n\nInfantry battalion command was, perhaps, not the best starting point for a successful career during the war.[22] The toll of COs was high. According to Peter Hodgkinson, ‘by the end of 1914, 18 of the Regular COs of August 1914 were dead, 24 had been wounded, and 10 had been invalided … five were prisoners of war, two had been lost through court martial, and six others replaced’.[23] 1915 was little better. In 2nd East Yorkshire’s parent division, the 28th, 10 infantry battalion COs were killed, 11 wounded, 6 invalided and one made prisoner of war. Others were replaced. One of these was Colonel Sweetman, who may be said to have fallen at the first fence in the promotion stakes. Only five weeks after assembling with 28th Division’s other battalions at Winchester, 2nd East Yorkshire found themselves, on 1-3 February 1915, holding very rudimentary and inadequate trenches near Hill 60, south of Ypres, in appalling weather. On 4 February 83 Brigade had a trench blown in and lost to the Germans.[24] Attempts to retake it were poorly organised. Colonel Sweetman paid the price. He was sent home, never to hold a combat command again.\n\nAbove: Lieutenant-Colonel Michael James Sweetman\n\nOf the Regiment’s eight Regular Majors only three survived the early fighting unscathed, Clarke, Young and Powell. Clarke’s career was the most successful. After commanding the 1st Battalion from 20 November 1914 until 17 March 1916, he was promoted to Brigadier-General. His two periods as GOC 52 Brigade, 17th (Northern) Division (18 March-20 November 1916 and 23 March-1 June 1917) were interspersed with a brief command of 3 Brigade, 1st Division (15-21 March 1917). He ended the war as GOC 43 Indian Infantry Brigade, Lahore. He retired in 1925 as a Lieutenant-Colonel (only one step up from the rank he would probably have obtained fairly soon had the war not occurred), but with the title of ‘Hon. Brigadier-General’. He was made CMG in 1916.\n\nMajor Young succeeded to command of the 1st Battalion after the death of Colonel Benson. He commanded 1st East Yorkshire until 10 November 1914, when Major Armstrong was brought in from the 2nd Battalion as CO. This looks very much like a vote of no confidence in Young. When he returned to a battalion command, it was as CO of the 2nd East Yorkshire (15 May 1915-8 June 1915). He was the battalion’s third ‘permanent’ CO. His third – and final - command was an external appointment as CO 2nd Battalion Yorkshire Regiment, 21 Brigade, 7th Division (later 30th Division). His first period (8 July 1915-30 Nov 1915) was ended by a wound. He returned on 5 December 1915 and remained in command until 1 October 1916, when he was invalided home.\n\nAbove: Major Walter Herbert Young (died 1940)\n\nYoung was an infantry battalion commander for 521 days, a far from contemptible achievement in what was a very demanding job. He was gazetted DSO on 1 January 1917 and three times mentioned in despatches. He retired with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel on 18 June 1919.\n\nMajor Powell ended the war as he began it - ‘Major, East Yorkshire Regiment’. He had two brief periods as Acting CO 2nd East Yorkshire (8 February 1915-9 February 1915 and 23 April 1915-8 May 1915). His second spell was ended by a wound. He appears to have spent the rest of the war as a Staff officer (GSO2, a Major-level appointment). The November 1918 Army List shows him as employed at the War Office.\n\nThe Captains of August 1914 fared especially badly in the early fighting. Eight of the twenty were dead by April 1915, including six of the original eight company commanders. The officer who had the longest and most successful career was the 1st Battalion’s Adjutant, Captain D.F. Anderson.\n\nAbove Captain Desmond Anderson\n\nHaving survived a wound on 20 September, his career eventually took the staff path. He was GSO3 V Corps (30 May 1915-9 February 1916), Brigade Major, 36 Brigade, 12th (Eastern) Division (10 February 1916-14 January 1917), GSO2 8th Division (15 January 1917-18 July 1917), GSO2 War Office (19 July 1917-22 February 1918), and GSO1 (chief of staff)in the reconstituted 25th Division (6 August 1918-22 April 1919). He continued in the army after the war, passed staff college, commanded the 1st East Yorkshire and rose steadily through a series of staff appointments. The outbreak of the Second World War found him MGGS Home Forces, in charge of Administration, Eastern Command. After a brief period of divisional command (45th and 46th Divisions) and a spell as Assistant Chief of the Imperial General Staff, he was promoted in December 1940to command III Corps, part of Persia and Iraq Command, with the rank of Lieutenant-General. He transferred to II Corps in 1943 and retired in 1944.\n\nSix of the East Yorkshire’s surviving captains commanded battalions at some point during the war. Captain Trimble held four battalion commands: 11th East Yorkshire, 17 August-16 November 1916; 9th Norfolk, 27 January 1917-26 February 1917; 1/5th Leicestershire, 23 April-27 November 1917;and 1st East Yorkshire, 28 November 1917-8 April 1918, a total of 470 days of infantry battalion command. On 22 March 1918, the second day of the German Spring Offensive, he organised a stubborn defence of the village of Saulcourt, allowing 110 Brigade to retreat, before withdrawing to positions near Longavesnes.[25] By the time they got back to the Canal du Nord the battalion was down to eight officers and 90 Other Ranks. His DSO was gazetted on 1 January 1918. He ended the war employed with the Machine Gun Corps. Captain Riall commanded 13th York & Lancaster (1st Barnsley Pals), 15 July -22 September 1916, and the 12th York & Lancaster (Sheffield City Battalion), 12 October 1916-8 May 1917, a total of 287 days. Captain Headlam was CO 10th East Yorkshire (1st Hull), 7 August 1917-13 April 1918 (249 days), ending the war as CO 4th (Reserve) Battalion Welsh Regiment.\n\nAbove: Captain (later Lieutenant-Colonel) Thomas Alexander Headlam\n\nBogle, the only one of 1st Battalion’s original company commanders to survive the fighting of 1914, was CO 2nd East Yorkshire, 8 June 1915-7 September 1915 (91 days), but was not used again as a‘permanent’ battalion CO. He was A/CO 2ndNorthumberland Fusiliers, 8-12 October 1915, and ended the war as A/Major, 2nd East Yorkshire, attached 11th (Service) Battalion East Yorkshire (2nd Hull).Captain Cowper, after a brief period (9-23 August 1915) as Acting CO 6thEast Yorkshire (Pioneers)was ended by a shrapnel wound to his back that required evacuation to Britain, he returned as CO on 8 March 1916 and retained command until the end of the war.[26] The Armistice found him as Temporary Lieutenant-Colonel, substantive Major, one rank up from August 1914. Captain Hopkins went with the 2nd East Yorkshire to Salonika and remained there, eventually commanding the battalion as its seventh and final wartime CO.\n\nOf the remaining captains of August 1914, Captain Harvey’s career took the staff path. Captain Berthon remained as Adjutant of the 3rd East Yorkshire until 17 February 1915, when he joined the 2nd Battalion. He ended the war as a Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel on the Staff. Captain Kino remained with the 3rd Battalion until 18 December 1914, when he joined the 1st Battalion. He was gazetted DSO on 23 June 1915 ‘for distinguished service in the field’, but spent part of 1915 in the Queen Alexandra Military Hospital, Millbank, suffering from rheumatism. He retired in the rank of Major with ill health on 24 July 1918 and died in 1924, aged only 43.\n\nCaptain Twiss remained at home when the 1st Battalion deployed, acting as Adjutant of the 10th (Service) Battalion, until 9 November 1914, he was then Adjutant 13th Battalion East Yorkshire Regiment (4th Hull), 10 November 1914-21 March 1917. After being attached 5thBuffs, 22 March 1917-5 October 1917, he spent the remainder of the war with the 7th Battalion East Yorkshire Regiment.\n\nThe outbreak of war found Captain Wrangham attached to the 3rd (Reserve) Battalion East Yorkshire. He was a staff officer (GSO3), 5 October-27 December 1914, before he joined his regiment. He ended the war as a substantive Major, attached to the 9th (Service) Battalion Worcestershire Regiment, which served in Mesopotamia and later with the North Persia Force. Major Wrangham served in India after the war and died there on 17 May 1920. He is buried at Peshawar.\n\nFour of the August 1914 subalterns went on to command battalions during the war.[27] Lieutenant Bray was briefly CO 6th East Yorkshire (Pioneers) (23 Aug 1915-18 Oct 1915), an appointment that was terminated by illness. He was not again used as a commanding officer. He ended the war as substantive Captain (Brevet Major) on the Staff, having been appointed DAQMG on 15 March 1916. Lieutenant Stow was Adjutant of the Eastern Bengal Volunteer Rifles when the war broke out. He remained in this post until 30 June 1915. He deployed to France on 17 August 1915 and was attached to the 1st Battalion East Yorkshire. He assumed command of 1st East Yorkshire on 17 March 1916 and died of his wounds on 1 or 2 July 1916 at No. 34 Casualty Clearing Station.[28]\n\nLieutenant Saunders, a captain from October 1914, served in France with the 2nd Battalion, January-February 1915, when he was wounded and invalided home. He was appointed to command the Officers Training School at Tynemouth with the rank of T/Major. He returned to France, this time with the 1st Battalion, in October 1915, as 2 i/c. He became the sixth CO 1st East Yorkshire on 2 July 1916, at the age of 34, after A/Lieutenant-Colonel Stow was killed. He held the post until 2 November 1916 (123 days), a period that included much fighting on the Somme and at the end of which he was invalided home. He returned to 1st Battalion in February 1917, but only as 2 i/c to his successor as CO, A/Lieutenant-Colonel R.H. Waithman (Royal Sussex Regiment). Saunders was appointed Chief Instructor at II Corps School on 28 April 1917, followed by III Corps School in December 1917. He was killed in action on 30March 1918 while commanding a scratch battalion formed from the Schools to hold a section of line during the German Spring Offensive. Lieutenant Coles became the ninth CO 1st East Yorkshire on 8 April 1918, but was killed in action seventeen days later during the Second Battle of Kemmel Ridge while conducting a very determined defence of Onraet Wood, south of Ypres, where the 1st East Yorkshire held the German attack for several hours that morning. Only three officers and 34 Other Ranks managed to extricate themselves from the attack.\n\nAbove: Lieutenant (later Captain and T/Lieutenant-Colonel) James Hugh (‘Jim’) Coles\n\nThe BEF of September 1914 was ‘infantry heavy’. Infantry made up almost 58 per cent of the BEF’s total strength. By October 1918 the BEF’s infantry component had shrunk to just under a third of total strength. Branches of the army that had not existed on the outbreak of war came on stream, while others that had been small before the war grew exponentially. This meant the possibility of professional enhancement outside the regiment for the East Yorkshire’s young Regular officers. Chief among these opportunities were the Army Signal Service, the Machine Gun Corps and the Royal Flying Corps. Lieutenants Plimpton, Noel and Blacker found their niche in the Machine Gun Corps. Plimpton spent the whole of his active service in Salonika, ending the war on the staff of XII Corps with the rank of T/Lieutenant-Colonel. Lieutenants Hardiman and Mair and 2nd Lieutenant Smallwood served with the Army Signal Service.\n\nAbove: Lieutenant (later Captain) Baptist Lucius Noel\n\nMair was on attachment to the Signal Service from 22 December 1913. He never served with the East Yorkshire Regiment after that date. He ended his career as a full Colonel in the Royal Signals (established in 1920). Smallwood was in career terms one of the East Yorkshire’s most successful Regular officers of August 1914, rising eventually to Major-General. He deployed to France in August 1914 as the 1st Battalion’s Transport Officer, but was seconded to the Army Signal Service on 25 November 1914. He remained with the Signal Service for the rest of the war, ending as a T/Major, substantive Captain. He passed staff college in 1923 and reverted to infantry employment, commanding 2ndEast Yorkshire, 1934-37. He spent much of the Second World War in East Africa, as Acting Commander 1st East African Division and commander of 23 Nigerian Brigade. He was promoted major-general in 1942 and became GOC Madagascar. His final appointment before retiring in 1946 was as Head of the Training Staff, Greek Army. He retired to Kenya and died there. Lieutenant Hartcup transferred to the Royal Flying Corps and eventually the Royal Air Force. He obtained his Royal Aero Club Aviator’s Certificate [No. 2068] at the Military School, Shoreham, on 26 November 1915, but his career in the RFC/RAF appears to have been administrative.\n\nThe remaining Regular subalterns of August 1914 had varied wartime careers. Broadley and Robson ended the war attached to the Colonial Office. Leadley-Brown was employed for most of the war as 2nd Ass. Supt. Ordnance Factories (3 September 1915-17 October 1916) and with the Ministry of Munitions (1 April 1917-1 November 1917). He went on half-pay on 25 December 1917, having apparently suffered health problems, possibly shell shock.\n\nAbove: Lieutenant (later Captain) Cuthbert Leadley-Brown\n\nGrant, following service with 6th Battalion East Yorkshire Regiment, was attached to the Egyptian Army from 25 June 1916. Carruthers, who had been held back in August 1914 to help train the New Army battalions, became Adjutant of the 7th Battalion East Yorkshire Regiment and remained with it for the rest of the war. Browne served with the West African Regiment until 11 August 1916 and then with 1/4th Northamptonshire Regiment TF as T/Major (1916-17), ending the war as Captain (T/Major), 1st East Yorkshire.\n\nAbove: Lieutenant W.S. Browne\n\nDouglas spent much of the second half of the war employed with 7th Training Reserve Battalion. Willats was retained at home in August 1914 and attached to 6th East Yorkshire, with which he served on Gallipoli, being badly wounded. He was accidentally killed in a training accident at Rugeley Camp in Staffordshire on 17 December 1916, aged 22.[29]\n\nWailes deployed to France with 2nd Battalion as its Adjutant. He was wounded (GSW and fractured arm) on 5 February 1915.After recovering, he seems to have spent the rest of the war as a Brigade Major. Porter ended his attachment to the West African Regiment on 5 October 1916. He spent the rest of the war with 1st Battalion East Yorkshire, ending in the rank of Captain.\n\nIn a totally unscientific comparison, I looked at the ‘career performance’ of Regular officers of the regiments that preceded and followed the East Yorkshire Regiment in the Army List, the West Yorkshire Regiment and the Bedfordshire Regiment. The comparison is not flattering to the East Yorkshire. Only one of the East Yorkshire’s Regular officers of August 1914 (J.L.J. Clarke) reached general officer rank during the war.\n\nAbove: Major (later Brigadier-General) John Louis Justice Clarke\n\nThe West Yorkshire Regiment produced six, four infantry brigade commanders[30] and two divisional commanders.[31] The Bedfordshire Regiment produced eight, five infantry brigade commanders,[32] an RFC Brigade commander,[33] a Corps chief logistics officer[34] and a divisional commander.[35] The greater career success of the Regular officers of the West Yorkshire and Bedfordshire Regiment is attributable to many reasons, not least chance, but what is apparent is the importance of having passed staff college, something in which the pre-war East Yorkshire Regiment may be thought under par.’\n\nFew who have read this article could fail to be struck, indeed moved, by the impact of the losses on the British Army as an institution and on the officer corps as a social group. In researching and writing it, I did not expect to confront my fundamental view of Britain’s war, but it has made me do so.\n\n‘But for the small British force ,’ wrote General Spears in 1930, ‘final and irremediable defeat would have overtaken France.’[36] I have always had doubts about this. The salvation of France in 1914 was secured by General J.J.C. Joffre. His decision to order the manoeuvre that resulted in the battle of the Marne was perhaps the decisive moment of the war in the west. It ensured that there would be no quick German victory and the German high command was always pessimistic about its ability to win a long war, especially a long war involving the British Empire. The BEF undoubtedly did useful work during the retreat from Mons by providing a speed bump on Germany’s ‘road to victory’, but it was always just behind the action on the Marne and even at 1st Ypres, the BEF’s greatest achievement, the French Army was predominant. Haldane created the BEF essentially as an economy measure and as a symbol of support for France. But he never intended it to be more than six infantry divisions and a cavalry division. Whether the French expected the BEF to make a military difference is doubtful, but they welcomed it as a symbol and guarantee of allied cohesion. Whether it could have contributed to allied cohesion by being employed elsewhere than on the Western Front is a moot point. Its use there certainly denied Britain’s carefully considered maritime strategy the military force that it required to be effective.[37] Perhaps this outcome was inevitable, perhaps it was necessary, as Kitchener argued, but it was also fateful, bringing about the kind of war that Britain had been so adept in the past at avoiding and tying British strategy and policy inexorably to France and its fate.\n\nProf JM Bourne\n\n[I am pleased to acknowledge the help of the following in the research and writing of this article: Dr Derek Clayton, Jeremy Dandridge, Dr Peter Hodgkinson, Andy Johnson (‘The Sage of Tipton’), Dr Bill Mitchinson, Jill Stewart (WFA) and David Tattersfield (WFA).

Major-General Smallwood died in Nairobi, Kenya, on 3 March 1977, aged 88. His elder son, Lieutenant Charles Anthony Russell Smallwood (1917-87), 88th Field Regiment RA, was captured at Singapore and spent the rest of the war in Japanese captivity. His younger son, Robert Evelyn Russell Smallwood (1920-2013), also reached the rank of major-general.\n\n2nd Lieutenant (later Captain) Patrick Noel Kennard (1893-1916), 2nd Battalion: b. Sleat, Inverness-shire, 15 October 1893, youngest of three sons of Major Cecil Waterhouse Kennard (1867-1938) and Mary Wilhlemina Noel Money (1863-1958); unmarried; ed. RMC Sandhurst, commissioned 22 January 1913. Kennard’s wartime career is somewhat elusive. It is uncertain whether he served with 2nd Battalion on the Western Front. He spent much of 1915 on sick leave. The CWGC and Officers Died show him as being killed on 14 July 1916 serving with the 1st Battalion. The only time that Kennard appears in the 1st Battalion War Diary is March 1916. From May 1916 the Army List shows Kennard as 1st Battalion, serving with 8th Battalion. Although there is no mention of him in the 8th Battalion’s War Diary, it seems fairly certain that he was one of the eight 8th Battalion officers killed in action on 14 July 1916. He was 22. Captain Kennard has no known grave; he is commemorated on the Thiepval Memorial, Belgium. His elder brother, Flight Captain Donald Ian Menzies Kennard (1891-1942), Air Transport Auxiliary, was killed on 14 September 1942. Service File: TNA: PRO WO 339/8834. Probate: £78 15s 4d.\n\n2nd Lieutenant (later Lieutenant) Peter Clutterbuck (1892-1914), “A” Coy, 1st Battalion: b. Great Stanmore, Middlesex, 30 August 1892, fourth of six children of Peter Clutterbuck JP (1856-1938), a gentleman of independent means (Lord of the Manor of Sarratt, Hertfordshire), and Fanny Blewitt (1862-1942); unmarried; ed. Harrow School and RMC Sandhurst, commissioned 3 September 1913; killed in action on 20 October 1914, aged 22. Lieutenant Clutterbuck has no known grave; he is commemorated on the Ploegsteert Memorial, Belgium, and the Harrow School Roll of Honour. Clutterbuck’s service file contains a statement from one of his men, Corporal Thorpe, stating ‘we all think he is a prisoner. He was a very fine officer and immensely liked, for he had no fear whatsoever’. This, and other confused and contradictory reports, encouraged Clutterbuck’s father to indulge the hope that his son had not been killed, hope that was eventually extinguished. Service File: TNA: PRO WO 339/9248. Probate: £91 6s 6d.\n\n2nd Lieutenant (later Captain) Thomas Mark Robson (1894-1957), “C” Coy, 1st Battalion: b.

Lancing College and RMC Sandhurst, commissioned 17 September 1913; killed in action 16 March 1915, when a bullet passed through a sandbagged trench parapet, hitting him in the head. Until recently 2nd Lieutenant Scott’s death was incorrectly recorded in the Commonwealth War Graves Debt of Honour Register as 13 March 1918. The entry also records his age at death as 24; he was actually 21. These errors are repeated on his headstone in Houplines Communal Cemetery Extension.[41] Lieutenant Scott is commemorated on the Lancing College War Memorial, and the Hulcote and Salford War Memorial, Bedfordshire. His younger brother, 2nd Lieutenant John Hastings Folliott Scott, 5th (Service) Battalion Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, was killed in action on 9 April 1917.
