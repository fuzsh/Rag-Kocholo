        "text": "Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated had its humble beginnings as the vision of nine college students on the campus of Howard University in 1908. Since then, the sorority has flourished into a globally-impactful organization of nearly 300,000 college-trained members, bound by the bonds of sisterhood and empowered by a commitment to servant-leadership that is both domestic and international in its scope. The Gamma Lambda chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated was chartered on the beautiful campus of Winston-Salem Teachers College, now Winston-Salem State University on January 29, 1949 by fourteen distinguished women.\n\nGamma Lambda - RAMsync\n\nMamie B.

On April 28, 1951 the Beta Iota chapter was charted on the campus of Winston-Salem State University by 11 young men.\n\nBeta Iota Chapter - RAMsync\n\nWilliam F.

These men were excluded from social events at the university and decided to form and incorporate Kappa Alpha Nu in 1911. One of the earliest black national social fraternities established in the U.S. one goal was to expand to other schools to help members attain high “intellectual, moral and social worth. “ On Friday, December 9, 1960 the Delta Chi Chapter was charted on the campus of Winston-Salem State University as the 116th chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi. The Chapter was chartered by 7 honorable achievers that strived and excelled in every field.\n\nDelta Chi - RAMsync\n\nBenjamin Dupree\n\nJerome P. Jewell\n\nMoses Lucas\n\nJames C.

Robinson\n\nOn September 19, 1963, at Morgan State College (now Morgan State University), 12 students founded what is now the nation's fifth largest, predominately African-American social service fraternity, Iota Phi Theta Fraternity Incorporated. Based upon their ages, heightened responsibilities, and increased level of maturity, this group had a slightly different perspective than the norm for college students. It was this perspective from which they established the Fraternity's purpose, \"The development and perpetuation of Scholarship, Leadership, Citizenship, Fidelity, and Brotherhood among Men.\" The Kappa Chapter of Iota Phi Theta Fraternity Incorporated was charted on the campus of Winston-Salem State University in 1970.\n\nKappa Chapter of Iota Phi Theta - RamSync\n\nFounding Members:\n\nAlbert Hicks\n\nLonnie Spruill, Jr.\n\nCharles Briscoe\n\nFrank Coakley\n\nJohn Slade\n\nBarron Willis\n\nWebster Lewis\n\nCharles Brown\n\nLouis Hudnell\n\nCharles Gregory\n\nElias Dorsey, Jr. Michael Williams\n\nOn Friday evening, November 17, 1911, three Howard University undergraduate students, with the assistance of their faculty adviser, gave birth to the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. This event occurred in the office of biology Professor Ernest E. Just, the faculty adviser, in the Science Hall (now known as Thirkield Hall). The three liberal arts students were Edgar A. Love, Oscar J. Cooper and Frank Coleman. From the initials of the Greek phrase meaning \"friendship is essential to the soul,\" the name Omega Psi Phi was derived. The phrase was selected as the motto. Manhood, scholarship, perseverance and uplift were adopted as cardinal principles. A decision was made regarding the design for the pin and emblem, and thus ended the first meeting of the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. The Mu Epsilon Chapter of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity Incorporated was charted on the campus of Winston-Salem State University on October 28, 1948.\n\nOmega Psi Phi Fraternity Incorporated - RamSync\n\nFounding Fathers:\n\nEdgar Amos Love\n\nOscar James Cooper\n\nFrank Coleman\n\nErnest Everett Just, Faculty Adviser\n\nPhi Beta Sigma Fraternity was founded at Howard University in Washington, D.C., January 9, 1914, by three young African-American male students. The Founders deeply wished to create an organization that viewed itself as “a part of” the general community rather than “apart from” the general community. They believed that each potential member should be judged by his own merits, rather than his family background or affluence…without regard to race, nationality, skin tone or texture of hair. They desired for their fraternity to exist as part of an even greater brotherhood which would be devoted to the “inclusive we” rather than the “exclusive we”. The Delta Alpha Chapter of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity Incorporated was charted on the campus of Winston-Salem State University in 1932.\n\nDelta Alpha Chapter of Phi Beta Sigma - RamSync\n\nFounding Members\n\nHonorable A.

Five coeds envisioned a sorority which would directly affect positive change, chart a course of action for the 1920s and beyond, raise consciousness of their people, encourage the highest standards of scholastic achievement, and foster a greater sense of unity among its members. Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc.- Omega Chapter was the first NPHC Sorority to be founded on the campus of Winston-Salem State University on May 8, 1948.
