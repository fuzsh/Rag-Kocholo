        "text": "Irish Barristers and the First World War\n\nThe Outbreak of War\n\nThe outbreak of war in July 1914 was a cataclysmic event whose effects would be felt across the continent of Europe. Ireland, as a part of the United Kingdom, was dealing with its own struggles, standing on the brink of Civil War. Parliament had recently voted to enact the Home Rule Bill. However, with the advent of the Great War, it was decided to suspend the introduction of Home Rule causing further unrest and uncertainty throughout the country.\n\nWhy Irishmen Volunteered to Fight\n\nMany Irish women also volunteered their services throughout the war. They worked tirelessly and heroically as nurses and voluntary aid detachments for organisations such as the Red Cross, often on the front line. The barristers commemorated in this exhibition are men, simply because at this time women were not permitted to enter the Bar or to join combat units. However, of note is the first practising female barrister, admitted to the Irish Bar in 1921, Averil Deverell , who drove with the ambulance corps in France for the duration of the War.\n\nIn addition, Irish civilians also played their part. 37,000 workers were involved in the ship building industry in Belfast and many munitions factories could be found throughout Ireland, with several state munitions factories being established and employing 2,100 people, mostly women, in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Waterford.\n\nIrish Barristers & The Great War\n\nGiven their history in politics and rebellion, it is not surprising that many Irish barristers volunteered for service in the British forces during World War 1. Like other professions, there were those amongst the members of the Bar who sought to play their part in what they saw as a fight for freedom and the protection of small nations. Many barristers were also graduates of TCD, where there was a very active Officer Training Corp.\n\nWhen World War 1 began there were approximately 300 members of the Bar. The Irish Law Times War Supplement of 1916 numbered those called to the Bar who chose to enlist at 126 (not all of whom were practising members of the Library). In addition, the supplement also refers to 95 barristers as having one or more sons serving, a total of 160 sons of barristers enlisted. As such the Great War had a very significant and personal impact on the membership of the Bar.\n\nTo support their colleagues fighting at the front, the Bar Council passed a resolution on the 27th November 1914 that would protect the practices of serving members, until they could return. They resolved that:\n\n….with a view to preserving so far as possible the practice of every barrister who is unable to attend to his business owing to his serving in His Majesty’s Forces, or otherwise in connection with the war (hereinafter designated as A.B.), the Bar Council recommends:\n\nThat all barristers should make it a point of honour to do what they can to ensure that A.B. may get back his practice intact when he resumes work at the Bar.\n\nThat all barristers, whether senior or junior to A.B., should, so far as is reasonable practicable, do the work of A.B.\n\nThat any barrister doing the work for A.B. should, after his signature to any pleadings or other documents, add “for A.B. now serving in His Majesty’s Forces” (or as the case may be), and if holding a brief should state to the Court for whom he is holding such brief and for what reason.\n\nBarristers who died during the Great War\n\nAlthough it is hard to get a precise figure on the number of Irish fatalities during the war, it is estimated that over 49,000 soldiers from the island of Ireland were killed. Of the 126 serving barristers, 25 lost their lives, so in May 1924 a memorial by the sculptor Oliver Sheppard was commissioned by the Bar and unveiled in Dublin Castle to commemorate the fallen. This public sculpture was later placed near the entrance to the Law Library in the Four Courts, after its reconstruction in the early 1930s, where it can still be seen today. The impressive bronze memorial lists the names of the 25 barristers who died in World War 1.\n\nEvery year, to commemorate their fallen colleagues, The Bar of Ireland holds a remembrance ceremony at the sculpture in the Four Courts.\n\nKnow that we fools, now with the foolish dead, Died not for flag, nor King, nor Emperor,— But for a dream, born in a herdsman’s shed, And for the secret Scripture of the poor.\n\nTom Kettle, To My Daughter Betty, A Gift from God\n\nThey shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old, Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning we will remember them\n\nRobert Lawrence Binyon"
