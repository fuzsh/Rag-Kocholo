        "text": "Lieutenant (Lt) (FAA) Roy BAKER-FALKNER, 600 Squadron. At the end of August 1940 when there was an urgent need for pilots, the call went out to the Navy, Coastal Command and Bomber Command Roy was one of these. He rose to the rank of LCdr DSO, DSC and was killed after flying off the Aircraft Carrier HMS Furious 18 June 1944. Roy Sydney Baker-Falkner was born on 3rd June 1916 in Nottingham, England; his father was stationed in Britain with the 79th Battalion Canadian Expeditionary Force. The family returned to Canada in early 1918, eventually moving to Saanich on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, to be close to their cousin, a magistrate at Steveston near Vancouver. In mid 1929, Baker-Falkner applied to join the Navy at Esquimalt naval base, British Columbia. As the Royal Naval College of Canada at Esquimalt had closed eight years previously, he was transferred to the United Kingdom on a Canadian Commonwealth Scholarship. Along with other RCN cadets, he enrolled for officer training at the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. In 1934, as a midshipman, he was appointed to HMS Kent, flagship of the China Fleet. In 1937 he transferred to the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm as a pilot, completing his pilot training with the Royal Air Force. Baker-Falkner earned his pilot’s wings in 1938 with the rank of Sub-Lieutenant RN/Flight Lieutenant RAF, and specialized in torpedo reconnaissance. He was appointed to an operational carrier-based squadron in HMS Glorious in the Mediterranean. On the outbreak of war in September 1939, his Fairey Swordfish squadron was actively involved in the search for the German warship Graf Spee in the Indian Ocean. Baker-Falkner returned to England in spring 1940, and was seconded to a shore-based squadron where he supported the evacuation of troops from Dunkirk and later participated in the Battle of Britain. He was one of the few Canadian naval officers to participate in this battle. He then was seconded to RAF Coastal Command, flying the venerable Swordfish biplane in mining missions against the German coastline. For his actions he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. After 15 months of operational duties, in August 1941 Baker-Falkner was attached as a pilot instructor to the Fleet Air Arm air station at RNAS Condor in Arbroath, Scotland, at which time he took part in the Royal Navy information film “Find, Fix and Strike”. He was appointed as commanding officer of 767 squadron in August 1942. Subsequently in October 1942 he was appointed to the Royal Navy aircraft testing squadron at RAF Boscombe Down as a test pilot, and proved instrumental in testing naval aircraft prior to their operational use by the Royal Navy. Chief amongst these was the dive-bomber, the Fairey Barracuda. Based on his unique skills with the Barracuda, he was given command of 827 squadron in August 1943, the first Royal Navy unit equipped with this advanced dive-bomber.\n\n84923 P/O Percival H. BEAKE 64 Squadron. In his own words “…the only shots I fired during the battle were at a friendly bomber, in error. Thank goodness I didn’t cause any damage…”. Awarded the DFC 05 September 1944, joined the RAFVR at Bristol in April 1939. Flying from Whitechurch Airfield on some evenings and weekends he had completed 50 hours training on Tiger Moths when war was declared. However, the mobilisation of all aircrew in Volunteer Reserve and Auxiliary Units overwhelmed the flying training facilities available and he was posted to No. 3 Initial Training Wing at St. Leonards on Sea where keep fit exercises and ground studies were the order of the day. It was not until 26/3/1940 that he was posted to Redhill to commence flying training again from scratch. Training continued on different aircraft until 31 August 1940 when he was posted to Hawarden where he first flew a Spitfire. After three weeks there he was posted to 64 Squadron at Leconfield. A month later the Squadron moved to Coltishall. It was not until 1o November 1940 that the Squadron was moved to Hornchurch in the London area by which time daylight raids by masses of enemy bombers had been discontinued in favour of night time raids. On February 2nd, 1941 Percy made a forced landing in a field at Sheperdswell in Kent. He tried to make a wheels-down landing to save his aircraft but ended up head down in the mud. Percy’s aircraft was a write-off and he suffered concussion for which he was treated in the RAF Officers Hospital in Torquay. He did not get back to the Squadron until March 27th. On May 16th the Squadron was posted to Turnhouse near Edinburgh. On June 26th Percy complained to the CO about the lack of combat opportunity there and the following day he was posted to 92 Squadron at Biggin Hill. On July 8, having taken part in a mission over France, he was shot down by an Me109 just after leaving the French coast but he managed to bale out over the sea and was picked up 18 miles east of Dover by an RAF Rescue Launch. Towards the end of October the Squadron moved to Digby in Lincolnshire and by the end of the year Percy had completed 100 operation sorties and was declared ‘tour expired’. In January 1942 Percy was posted to 601 Squadron which at the time was equipped with Aircobras. These aircraft had serious maintenance problems and were never made operational. However, the Squadron was re-equipped with Spitfires in March and was posted to Malta. The CO said “Beaky you are tour expired” so I can’t take you to Malta – you will have to go to instructing at an OUT. So it was he arrived at 58 OUT in Grangemouth on April 1st 1942. He remained instructing until the end of the year when he was posted to Harrowbeer in Devon as a founder member of a new Squadron – 193 – being formed to fly Typhoons. The Squadron became operational in April 1943. On February 8th, 1944, whilst flying over France they were lucky to see some FW 190s returning to Gael airfield. Two were on their landing approach. The leader touched down successfully but was immediately attacked and destroyed by Percy’s Wing Commander who was leading the operation. The second FW had decided to go round again but Percy shot him down and the ‘190 burst into flames when it hit the ground. At the end of March 1944 Percy was posted to 84 Group Support Unit which had been formed as a reserve of potential leaders to replace the expected casualties in the build up to the invasion. At the end of May I was posted to command 164 rocket firing Typhoon Squadron based on Thorney Island, its CO having been shot down by flak on the previous day.

Percy was awarded a ‘Mentioned in Despatch’ on June 8th and the DFC on July 25th. The citation read as follows:- This officer has commanded the squadron for several months and during this period has led his formation on many sorties against heavily defended targets with good results. He is a first class leader whose great skill, thoroughness and untiring efforts have contributed materially to the successes obtained. Squadron Leader Beake has destroyed two enemy aircraft.
