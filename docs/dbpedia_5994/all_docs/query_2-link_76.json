        "text": "Outbreak of War — Arrival of the wounded\n\nIn January 1915, the War Council approved a naval attack on the Gallipoli Peninsula. In February and March 1915, British warships bombarded the Turkish forts. These operations, as well as a half-hearted attempt to push through the Straits minefields failed. The army was then ordered to capture the guns from the land side.\n\nOn 25 April 1915, the 29th British Division landed on the beaches of Cape Helles, on the most southerly point of the Gallipoli Peninsula. The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) disembarked to the north of Gaba Tepe on the western shore of the peninsula, about 14 miles north of Cape Helles. The troops landed on the beaches in the face of a well prepared and determined enemy. The number of casualties was higher than expected.\n\nCasualties in the opening phase of the Dardanelles Campaign 25 April – 31 May 1915 Month Force Killed\n\nOfficers Killed\n\nOther\n\nRanks Wounded\n\nOfficers Wounded\n\nOther\n\nRanks Died wounds\n\nOfficers Died wounds\n\nOther\n\nRanks Died disease\n\nOfficer Died disease\n\nOther\n\nRanks 25–30 Apr Regular Army 49 795 110 2738 8 121 0 65 25–30 Apr Territorial 1 30 6 176 1 13 0 0 25–30 Apr Australian 49 594 110 2641 12 191 0 14 25–30 Apr New Zealand 8 267 26 672 3 75 0 19 25–30 Apr Royal Naval Div 2 10 7 107 0 7 0 0 TOTAL APRIL 109 1696 259 6334 24 407 0 98 May 1915 Regular Army 28 363 90 2187 15 120 1 9 May 1915 Territorial 15 218 64 1527 10 99 0 6 May 1915 Australian 75 1730 230 4995 26 443 0 24 May 1915 New Zealand 18 578 31 815 7 91 0 7 May 1915 Indian Native 1 120 14 365 0 0 0 0 May 1915 Royal Naval Div 33 462 87 1882 8 223 1 3 TOTAL MAY 170 3471 516 11771 66 976 2 49\n\nTable 1 \"Wounded\" means \"type of wound casualties\" not \"number of individuals wounded\". A soldier with a head and arm injury was counted as two.2\n\nThe HQ Staff at Mudros, on the island of Lemnos, had made inadequate preparations for the landings. They had assumed that the Turks would be driven back; that the men would make a rapid advance; and that it would be possible to establish hospitals on shore for collecting the wounded. Their estimate of the number of casualties was a mere 3,000.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Alfred Ernest Conquer Keble RAMC, Assistant Director of Medical Services (ADMS) at GHQ Mediterranean Expeditionary Force (MEF) refused to accept the casualty estimates. In the absence of the Director Medical Services (DMS) Surgeon General William George Birrell, who did not reach Mudros until 18 April, Keble prepared a medical plan for 10,000 casualties. This provided for the accommodation of 1,995 serious cases on two hospital ships, and for the collection of 7,300 not seriously wounded. However, Keble's plan relied on there being hospitals on the beaches. Without them, the wounded had to be evacuated by sea, without any possibility of separating the serious cases from those lightly injured.\n\nSo inadequate were the medical provisions for the reception of the sick, that an indignant Surgeon General Sir Neville Howse VC DMS Australian Imperial Force (AIF) asserted that he personally would recommend his Government when this war is over, under no conceivable conditions to trust the medical arrangements that may be made by the Imperial Authorities for the care of the Australian sick and wounded.3\n\nOn 8 July 1915, Sir A Markham asked the Under Secretary for War why the Secretary of State for War refused to give his consent to private persons sending out to Egypt private hospitals at their own expense; and whether as a consequence when the wounded from the Dardanelles arrived at Alexandria they were sent to the German Hospital to be nursed by German nurses? Mr Harold Tennant replied that private hospitals were not and are not now required in Egypt. The arrangements for the reception of the wounded at Alexandria are adequate in all respects.4\n\nDuring the landings on Sunday 25 April 1915, there were no Casualty Clearing Stations or Base Hospitals at Cape Helles and only two hospital ships at anchor off the coast. B Section of 87th Field Ambulance disembarked on Y Beach, Cape Helles with the 29th Division; C Section landed on X Beach Cape Helles. Y Beach was nothing more than a small strip of sand below a precipitous cliff gashed with steep, crumbling rocks and scrub covered gullies. First ashore on Y Beach were the men of the King's Own Scottish Borderers, followed by the South Wales Borderers, the Plymouth Battalion of the Royal Marines and B Section Bearers of 87th Field Ambulance under the command of Major C H Lindsay RAMC (T). A dressing Station was erected under the lee of the cliff.\n\nThe men used picks and shovels to excavate the gullies and establish sheltered treatment posts. The Bearer Sections of the Field Ambulance collected the wounded from the regimental aid posts. These were evacuated to the Advanced Dressing Station and onwards to the Casualty Clearing Station, the most important of which was near Lancashire Landing on W Beach, Cape Helles to where B Section of 87th Field Ambulance had been moved from Y Beach. From here, the wounded were embarked on lighters at a landing stage that was perforce also used to unload ammunition and supplies for the army. These lighters were towed by steam pinnaces to the hospital ship lying a mile or two off shore, and, without changing stretchers, were slung on to the ship by cranes. The hospital ships ferrying the injured to the Field Hospitals in Alexandria and Malta, took three and four days respectively to reach their destination.\n\nSir Ian Hamilton's despatch of May 1915, highlighted the difficulties faced by the Medical Services in collecting the casualties.\n\nThe Royal Army Medical Services have had to face unusual and very trying conditions. There are no roads, and the wounded who are unable to walk must be carried from the firing line to the shore. They, and their attendants, may be shelled on their way to the beaches, at the beaches, on the jetties, and again on their way out in lighters to the hospital ships. I can only express my own opinion that efficiency, method, and even a certain quiet heroism have characterised the evacuation of the many thousand of our wounded.8\n\nTransports or black ships were used to carry patients, a purpose for which they were never intended. They were neither adequately staffed nor equipped. On some of the black ships the wounded were exposed to the sun and heat, without food or drink for sixty to seventy hours. Horses and the wounded shared the same transports to Alexandria. The transports did eventually improve. More hospital ships, (painted white with a red cross), became available for the landings at Suvla Bay on 6 August, when the British 11th Division disembarked to the north of ANZAC Cove. Nonetheless, allegations were still made that during the landing of troops at Suvla Bay, the steamship Aragon conveyed 1,200 men from Gallipoli to Alexandria, a journey of five days, with only two surgeons on board.5 Seven Army and three Naval Hospital ships transported the wounded between the Dardanelles, Alexandria and the United Kingdom. In May 1915, another three ships were employed on so called ferry service.6\n\nOne of the hospital ships was the HMHS Soudan, a converted transport with bed accommodation for 202 cases and arrangements for 100 more beds in an emergency. Its Senior Medical Officer was Fleet Surgeon Trevor Collingwood MVO. On 25 February 1915, HMHS Soudan arrived at Tenedos and received 7 patients with shell wounds from the Agamemnon. From 25 February to 19 March, it admitted 137 naval casualties from the bombardment of the outer forts of the Straits. On 22 March, HMHS Soudan left the Dardanelles for Malta where 113 cases, including 76 wounded, were landed at the Royal Naval Hospital Bighi. Deputy Surgeon General James Lawrence Smith RN and Fleet Surgeon Bishop RN reported that 40 cases including shrapnel wounds had been received at Bighi on 25 March. Between 25 February and 2 May 1915, HMHS Soudan had treated 733 casualties of whom 570 were wounded and 163 ordinary medical and surgical cases.7 On 25 April 1915, HMHS Soudan was at the entrance of the Dardanelles to await casualties from the beach landings. By evening, 10 military officers and 342 soldiers had been received.\n\nThe first convoy of 600 badly wounded soldiers reached Malta on 4 May 1915, on HT Clan McGillivray. The men were under the medical care of Captain Vivian Benjafield Australian Medical Corps (AMC). Of these, 160 severe cases were admitted to Valletta Hospital; the remainder went to Tigné Hospital to be treated as convalescents. The Clan McGillivray moored in Sliema Creek where the slightly injured were disembarked to Tigné Steps, while the rest were taken off in lighters to Pietá. They were then moved by ambulance wagons and motor cars to Valletta Hospital.\n\nAmong the casualties on the Clan McGillivray was No 787 Pte Charles Pressey 9th Bn G Coy AIF who was admitted to Tigné Hospital with a gunshot wound to his left knee. Pte Pressey from Bundaberg Queensland had enlisted on 31 August 1914, aged 21 years. On 16 September 1915, he embarked at Malta on the Regina D'Italia for England and on 7 June 1916, joined the British Expeditionary Force in France from Monte Video Camp, Weymouth. Pte Pressey was injured in action in France and was medically discharged from the army with trench feet on 3 September 1918.\n\nDr Alice Hutchison, chief medical officer of the Second Serbian Unit of the Scottish Women's Hospital commented:\n\nThis was a day of waiting. The past preparations were made, beds made, dressing tables ready, dressings cut up, the wards bright with flowers and sunshine. At last, at 5 o'clock the bell clanged; the first batch of wounded had arrived. Down the long, stone corridor they came. A giant, gaunt and unkempt, led the van, towering over the little Maltese orderlies who supported him, his bandaged foot held stiffly in front of him. Ragged, dirty, hungry looking, some joking and others doggedly dejected, those who could walk trooped in. Quite silently followed the procession of stretchers with their still burdens. Until late in the evening they came; one by one the beds were filled while doctors and nurses dressed wounds many of which had remained untouched since first-aid was given at Gallipoli ten days ago.11\n\nThere was no end to the number of casualties arriving at Malta. On 5 May, 394 military wounded arrived in the HS Sicilia under the medical care of Lt Col Gimlette IMS. 200 of these were sent by lighter to Cottonera Hospital, the remainder to the Royal Naval Hospital Bighi. The worst cases were placed on the regulation stretcher and were swung on to lighters in a cot by means of a crane. Another 30 wounded disembarked from the HS Somali.\n\nHT Aragon arrived on 6 May with 641 cases on board under the medical charge of Lt McLoughlan RAMC. The patients were sent to Cottonera Hospital (20), Valletta Hospital (126); Tigné (250), St Georges (240) and the Blue Sisters (5 officers).\n\nOn 12 May, about 700 cases arrived in HT Caledonia bringing the total number of sick and wounded in the island to 2,593. The sick and injured disembarked at Marsamxett Harbour, near the Sliema Landing Stage. Minor cases were sent to St George's Hospital and cot cases to St Andrew's Hospital.\n\nOn 17 May HS Soudan proceeded to Gaba Tepe to receive 314 wounded from the ANZAC Contingent. The less severely wounded were transferred to HS Galeka, an army hospital carrier. On 24 May, HS Soudan arrived in Malta from the Dardanelles. It disembarked 85 NCOs and men who were sent to Cottonera Hospital, 7 officers to St Andrew's Hospital, 128 cot cases to Valletta Hospital. One casualty, Sgt Frederick Lane, died in harbour. HS Soudan also had seven wounded Turkish Prisoners of War who were admitted to Cottonera Hospital. On 26 May, Sergeant Halil Mohamed, one of the Turkish POWs, died at Cottonera hospital and was interred at the Ottoman Cemetery Marsa on 28 May 1915.\n\nOn 17 May, 773 wounded arrived from Egypt in the HT Braemar Castle and were transported mostly to Mtarfa and St Andrew's Hospitals by the Army Service Corps (ASC).\n\nOn 18 May, the Royal George brought 353 cases; the Southland brought another 776 cases, all from Alexandria. Dr Hutchison's diary entry for 20 May reads:\n\nOur patients are a cheery lot. Many of them are members of the brave Australian Contingent who did so much to help in the first terrible days of landing at Gallipoli and thrilling tales they tell of the happenings of those historic hours. Up and down the long wards they fling chaff and repartee to their comrades, wounds are a joke, pain a little bit of the day's work making them all the more eager to get back to the fighting line. Many are soon up and about in corridors and courtyard, lightly and comfortably clad in pyjamas and military caps; bandaged legs give the opportunity for fine competitions in hopping or the one-legged jump. And what must be the horror of the shades of the Knights when their old grey courts, those decorous courts in which one pictures the ritual of coloured procession and the solemn music of Gregorian chants, echo to the sound of the latest rag-time, the jingle of Tipperary or Who's your lady friend ?11\n\nOn 23 May 1915, HS Glengorm Castle arrived and embarked 200 sick and wounded for England.\n\nOn 28 July 1915, the British Prime Minister stated in the House of Commons that the total number of casualties among the naval and military forces engaged in the Dardanelles from the landings in April to 18 July, was 37,982. Of these, 8,099 were killed (officers 562, men 7,537), while the wounded numbered 29,883 (officers 1,375; men, 28,508).9\n\nIn October 1915, a combined Franco–British Force landed at Salonica (October 1915 – 30 September 1918) to assist Serbia in its war against Bulgaria. The campaign in Gallipoli was abandoned in early January 1916. Thus, the number of casualties arriving at Malta decreased so that by the end of March 1916, there were 20,000 beds but only 4,000 patients. In April 1917, submarine attacks on hospital ships made it unsafe to continue evacuating casualties to Malta from Salonica. The Hague Convention gave belligerents the right to stop and search hospital ships in order to ensure that no advantage was taken by them of carrying troops or munitions clandestinely on board. Officers commanding German submarines justified the sinking of hospital ships in consequence of their contravention of regulations which entitled them protection.\n\nThus, five General Hospitals, Nos 61, 62, 63, 64 and 65 were mobilized at Malta for duty in Salonica. Their medical officers, nurses and RAMC personnel were drawn from St Patrick's, St Paul's, St David's, Floriana and Spinola hospitals. On 6 July 1917, HMT Ship Abbassieh with Nos 61, 62, and 64 General Hospitals sailed out of Marsaxlokk Harbour escorted by two destroyers. It arrived at Salonica, (Thessalonika) Harbour, on 11 July 1917.\n\nThe total number of sick and wounded treated in Malta from 4 May 1915 to February 1919 was: 2,538 officers, 14 nursing sisters, and 55,439 other ranks, a total of 57,991 from the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, and 2,930 officers, 467 nursing sisters, and 74,733 other ranks, a total of 78,130, from the Salonica Expeditionary Force.10\n\nExpansion of the Military Hospitals – March 1915\n\nThere were two main expansions of the hospitals. The first took place in March 1915 when beds had to be found for venereal cases arriving from Egypt; the second was a massive increase in the number of beds to treat the casualties from the Gallipoli landings of 25 April 1915.\n\nOn 3 March 1915, the number of beds at Cottonera and Forrest Military Hospitals was increased by 500 to receive venereal patients from Egypt. It was assumed that only venereal patients would be arriving from Egypt and plans were devised accordingly. Forrest Hospital was expanded to 80 beds and was commanded by Major James Charles Gordon Carmichael. Authority was only received on 3 April to sanction an increase in the accommodation at Forrest Hospital to 160 beds and Mtarfa to 400 beds.\n\nThe task of organising the hospitals fell on Acting Colonel Richard Reginald Sleman RAMC (T) commanding officer 1st London (City of London) Field Ambulance (TF). On 14 September 1914, Sleman took over the duties of Deputy Director Medical Services (DDMS) from Colonel Michael William Russell. He was assisted by Lt Col Charles Chevin Cumming RAMC who acted as Deputy Assistant Director of Medical Services (DADMS). The Royal Engineers, commanded by Lt Col Seaman RE undertook most of the renovation works. Colonel R R Sleman remained in post until July 1915, when Surgeon General Hayward Reader Whitehead arrived form England. In April 1916, the Surgeon General moved to Salonica and was succeeded by Surgeon-General Michael Thomas Yarr.\n\nOn 11 March 1915, Colonel Sleman submitted detailed plans for accommodating an additional 3,500 patients at Cottonera and Valletta Hospitals and at St George's and St Andrew's Barracks. Work commenced on 20 March on converting the Long Ward of the Valletta Hospital for 200 beds. On 24 March, Mtarfa Barracks were handed over to Captain Andrew Elliot RAMC (T). On 29 March, a work party consisting of a sergeant and 16 men of 2nd/3rd London Regiment reported to Mtarfa to help get the hospital ready.\n\nThe following buildings were identified as being suitable for conversion into hospitals:\n\nSt Elmo Government Elementary School — 200 beds\n\nFlores College Strada Forni Valletta — 35 beds\n\nAuberge d'Aragon — 40 beds\n\nAuberge de Bavière — 75 beds\n\nDragonara House St Julians — 40 beds\n\nGovernment Elementary School Sliema — 300 beds\n\nZammit Clapp Hospital (on payment) — 60 beds\n\nOn 22 March 1915, Professor Salvatore Cassar Professor of Surgery in the Royal University of Malta and surgeon to the Central Civil Hospital Floriana offered his services as a surgeon, including those of six medical men and 18 students as dressers. On 1 April, Drs Grech and R Samut commenced working at Forrest Hospital while Dr Busuttil, Dr Said and Dr Ferro went to Mtarfa as civil surgeons attached to the RAMC. Civil medical practitioners holding temporary commissions in the RAMC were entitled to rations or allowances in lieu.\n\nOn 25 March, 19 cases of venereal disease were transferred to Forrest Hospital from HT Andania and Alaunia. Six boy scouts who wished to qualify for the War Badge were allowed into Forrest Hospital and carried out errands for patients.\n\nOn Monday 31 March 1915, about 500 sick Australian and New Zealanders, all venereal cases, arrived from Egypt on HT Atlantia. The worst cases with suppurating buboes, numbering about a 100, were sent by the Markham to St Julian's Bay and then taken off by stretchers to Forrest Hospital; the remainder of about 400 minor cases were sent to Mtarfa Hospital in two special trains. All gonorrhoea cases were admitted to Mtarfa Barracks; all cases of syphilis went to Forrest Hospital St Julians' Bay. Once recovered, the sick of the Australian Contingent were returned to Egypt. On 25 April, 30 convalescents embarked on HT Bamora and rejoined their units in Alexandria.\n\nExpansion of the Military Hospitals – Mediterranean Expeditionary Force\n\nOn 28 March 1915, HT Arcadia stopped at Malta with Surgeon General William George Birrell AMS Headquarters 29th Division on board. The DDMS informed him of what hospital accommodation was available at Malta. Subsequently, the Governor and Commander-in-Chief Field Marshal Lord Methuen cabled the War Office and offered the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, beds for 4,500 sick with a staff of 33 civil surgeons, 17 trained nurses and 34 semi-trained nurses. However, by 22 April only 500 beds were actually available with a possibility of expanding to 1,200 later. The total number of sick in the hospitals in Malta on 4 April was 624 including 521 venereal cases. By 26 April, it had dropped to a total of 553 patients.\n\nAt a conference held by the Governor at the Palace Valletta, DDMS Sleaman stated that 500 cases could be accommodated at Cottonera and Valletta Hospitals. Sufficient buildings to accommodate an additional 3,000 had also been identified but these required medical and nursing staff from England. He also recommended to train six probationers at Cottonera Hospital. The probationers were to be 23 to 38 years of age and be granted an allowance of £20 per annum with a pound a quarter paid in arrears for uniform upkeep. They were to be vaccinated against small pox and inoculated against enteric. Twenty probationary nurses were accepted for training at Cottonera Hospital as Voluntary Aid Detachments. All applicants to join the Military hospitals as nurses were to be made through Mrs Mifsud, Lady Superintendent St John Ambulance Brigade Valletta.\n\nOn 30 April 1915, Lord Methuen was notified that 1,000 sick and wounded were being sent to Malta from the Dardanelles. The HT Glen McGillivray with 600 slightly wounded and the Hospital Ship Sicilia with 400 cases were on their way. In the meantime medical personnel for 1,200 beds for Malta left England.\n\nOn 3 May 1915, Chief Engineer Seaman and Lt Col Charles Chevin Cumming inspected St Andrews, St Georges, Tigné and Forrest Hospital and concluded that St Georges Barracks was the least suitable for cot cases. On 15 May, an appropriate building was selected in Tigné and St George's Barracks and prepared as an operating theatre. Eight blocks at St Andrews Barracks had been refurbished and were ready for occupation. A conference held at the Palace Valletta on 13 May 1915, attended by Sir Frederick Treves and Sir Courtauld Thompsn BRC, decided to utilize the Jesuits College at Sliema (St Ignatius College) and the Bugeja Institute at Fleur de Lys. On 14 May, Chief Engineer Seaman accompanied by Professor Edoardo Magro, of the Faculty of Architecture at the university, visited the Institute and arranged for it to be taken over.\n\nMilitary Medical Units in Malta during the Great War 1915 – 1919 Building Opened on Initial Beds Total Beds Closed on Cottonera Hospital Pre war 167 802 Post war Valletta Hospital Pre war 36 524 Post war Forrest Hospital Pre war 20 186 Post war Mtarfa Barracks Pre war 55 1,853 Post war Tigné Barracks 2 May 1915 600 1,314 6 Jan 1919 St George's Barracks 6 May 1915 840 1,412 31 Oct 1917 St Andrew's Barracks 9 May 1915 1,172 1,258 Villa Dragonara 14 May 1915 12 20 29 Aug 1917 Floriana Barracks 4 June 1915 600 1,304 30 Apr 1917 Blue Sisters Hospital 6 June 1915 80 120 30 June 1917 Hamrun School 8 June 1915 108 117 5 July 1917 All Saints Camp 12 June 1915 1465 2000 Nov 1917 Auberge de Bavière 15 June 1915 105 155 14 Aug 1917 St Ignatius College 2 July 1915 155 196 Sisters' Hospital Floriana 10 July 1915 12 31 St David's 25 July 1915 464 1,168 1 May 1917 St Elmo Schools 12 Aug 1915 218 348 Oct 1917 St Patrick's 15 Aug 1915 1,000 1,168 27 Apr 1917 Ghajn Tuffieha Camp 15 Aug 1915 2,000 5,000 Jan 1919 St Paul's Hutments 25 Aug 1915 240 898 27 Apr 1917 St John's School 1 Sep 1915 400 520 9 Oct 1917 Fort Chambray Camp 4 Oct 1915 400 400 13 Mar 1916 Fort Spinola 6 Nov 1915 1,000 1,168 27 Apr 1917 Fort Ricasoli 6 Nov 1915 800 800 19 Feb 1916 Fort Manoel 16 Nov 1915 500 1,184 21 Dec 1918 San Antonio Palace 8 Dec 1915 50 50 19 Mar 1916 Verdala Palace 9 Dec 1915 30 30 17 Apr 1916 Mellieha Camp 1 Feb 1916 1,250 2,000 5 Sep 1917\n\nWar hospitals and Convalescent Camps during World War I10\n\nBetween 24 and 26 May 1915, Chief Engineer Seaman and DDMS Sleman inspected a number of buildings to ascertain their suitability as hospitals. Among those seen were: a Monastery at Pieta, a Government School at Sliema, a Monastery at St Julians, a House at Paola, Saura Hospital, Cini Institute Santa Venera, the Palace Valletta, San Antonio Palace, the Examination Hall Strada Cristoforo and various sites for the establishment of huts and canvas hospitals. Lord Methuen decided to erect a hut camp to the north of St Andrew's Barracks and to relocate the two territorial battalions which were under canvas at Pembroke to Ghajn Tuffieha, so as to make room for a canvas camp.\n\nThe actual number of available beds varied greatly. In August 1915, Malta had accommodation for 7,044 patients. In March 1916, when the needs of the Gallipoli campaign had been met, it had amounted to 13,500 and was reduced to 12,000. In July 1916, an outbreak of malaria among the troops in Macedonia brought more sick to Malta. Weekly convoys arrived with a number of sick increasing from 718 to 2,587 in successive weeks. To accommodate them, the beds in hospital and convalescent depôt were gradually increased to 25,570 by adding tentage to those hospitals formed in 1915. The highest figures were reached in October 1916, when the demands of the Salonica Force made it necessary to increase the number of beds to 24,570 beds. However, thereafter, the numbers began to fall until by September 1917, there remained only 5,943 patients many of whom were convalescent. To the end of August 1917, the total number of men treated in Malta was about 125,000. Of these, approximately equal numbers came from Gallipoli and from Salonica, the greater majority of serious surgical cases coming from Gallipoli.\n\nWar Hospitals in Malta 1915 – 1918\n\nThe mildness of the Maltese climate allowed many of the wounded to be treated in the open air. Balconies and verandahs became extensions to the main wards. No intact medical or surgical units were sent to Malta and the hospitals were organised using local resources. The Ospizio Depôt Stores of the Army Ordnance Department manufactured not only bedheads and bedside tables but also special splints, crutches, diet trays and disinfecting tubs. On 17 May 1915, a large quantity of timber was purchased by the Ordnance to meet the demand for hospital furniture.\n\nThe hospitals, of which there were 24 at one time, were variously located and varied also in the extent of their accommodation. In August 1915, the Station Hospital Cottonera had 374 beds and that of Valletta 400 beds; 685 beds were in civil buildings such as schools and auberges; 3,589 were in stone built barracks; and 1,996 under canvas. The great majority of these hospitals were provided with operating theatres and as far as possible surgical cases were kept in stone buildings or transferred there for their surgery. An X-ray apparatus was provided in all the more important buildings. Pte Walter Henry Scott (1892 – 1971) from Leicester was one of the radiographers working at Malta, possibly at St Andrew's Hospital. Scott arrived in Malta in 1916 and embarked for Salonica in 1917 with No 63 General Hospital.\n\nMost of the laboratory work was carried out in centralised laboratories, but the most important surgical hospitals of Cottonera and Tigné and the isolation hospital at Mtarfa each had their own fully equipped pathological departments. The majority of the hospitals were under the command of territorial or temporarily commissioned officers and practically all the civil medical officers and medical and surgical specialists held temporary commissions.\n\nThe kind of medical conditions seen in the hospitals depended very much on the phase of the campaign in which the soldiers had been injured. There were three main phases. In Phase One, which ran from Spring 1915 to the end of December 1915, the vast majority of patients came from Gallipoli. During this period, the conditions of the campaign on the peninsula called for a rapid evacuation and allowed very little surgical aid before arrival at Malta. Voyages of several days had to be endured by even the most gravely injured. Under such conditions wounds arrived in an advanced stage of sepsis. Towards the end of the Gallipoli Phase disease became more prominent than wounds and in the closing months, except for a group of frost bite, the surgical casualties were not excessive in numbers. The last of the Gallipoli patients were evacuated in Spring 1916.\n\nDuring Phase Two, which covered the Salonica Expeditionary Force, the sick did not arrive in Malta until the close of 1916. Owing to the existence of hospitals in Salonica surgical cases were dealt in theatre and never arrived in Malta in an acute or serious condition as those arriving from Gallipoli. The summer of 1916, provided a large number of medical casualties, mainly malaria of predominantly the Plasmodium vivax type with a few Plasmodium falciparum. In the second half of 1916, at least 75% of all admissions were for malaria. Some of the dysentery cases required surgical drainage of liver amoebic abscesses.\n\nIn Phase Three, which was the period after the autumn of 1916, the number of casualties from Salonica also decreased so that surgical work at the hospitals took on the routine work of a General Hospital in peace time.\n\nRoyal Naval Hospital Bighi\n\nThe naval medical services in Malta were commanded by Deputy Surgeon General James Lawrence Smith RN. There was good co-operation between the two medical services. The military offered temporary loan of personnel and the use of the military hospitals for sick naval ratings. In May 1915, all existing naval and military beds were pooled and made available for either service, depending on need. The Royal Naval Hospital Bighi was thus able to release 200 beds for the first influx of patients from Gallipoli. On 3 May 1915, 16 nurses of the Scottish Women's Hospital started work at Bighi Hospital. On 3 August 1915, five medical men were sent to work there, among whom was Dr P Debono.\n\nOn 20 August 1915, No 1315 Pte William Boyle 4th Field Ambulance C Section 33 years, labourer, was admitted to the Royal Naval Hospital Bighi. He arrived from ANZAC Gallipoli on HS Valdivia with influenza. He recovered and on 6 September was transferred to one of the convalescent camps. On 26 September 1915, he embarked at Malta for Egypt on HT Kawa and rejoined his unit at Mudros.\n\nSurgeon Herbert Mather Jamieson RNVR died at Malta on 26 September 1915, 33 years. He graduated MB Aberdeen in 1904, and for a number of years served as surgeon in the mercantile marine. At the beginning of the war his ship was commandeered for the transport of Australian troops to Gallipoli, and he volunteered for service with it. He was wounded off Gallipoli, but after recuperating for some time at home, he rejoined his ship, and died while serving at Malta. He was buried at Ta' Braxia Cemetery.17\n\nMilitary Hospital Cottonera\n\nCottonera Hospital August 1917\n\n(Mary Muscat's WWI photo album)\n\nSister McDougall Matron Cottonera Hospital 1917 (Mary Muscat's WWI photo album)\n\nCapt James Anderson and Capt Wheeler with staff Cottonera Hospital Aug 1917\n\n(Mary Muscat's WWI photo album)\n\nStaff of Cottonera Hospital August 1917\n\n(Mary Muscat's WWI photo album)\n\nCottonera Hospital with additional tentage near Zabbar Gate (Mary Muscat's WWI photo album)\n\nCottonera Hospital 1906 and its surroundings\n\n(RAMC/793/4/4)\n\nPatients leaving Cottonera Hospital for embarkation on HMHS Goorkha\n\n(Mary Muscat's WWI photo album)\n\nWard Five Cottonera Hospital Xmas 1916 (Mary Muscat's WWI photo album)\n\nWard Ten Cottonera Hospital\n\n(Mary Muscat's WWI photo album)\n\nCottonera Military Hospital near Zabbar Gate was opened on 28 August 1873. It had a capacity of 148 beds. It was the main hospital and HQ of 30 Coy RAMC in Malta until 29 June 1920, when the staff moved to Mtarfa Military Hospital. In 1929, it was offered on lease by the War Office to house St Edward's College.\n\nIn April 1915, Station Hospital Cottonera became a war hospital for surgical patients. It increased its bed capacity to 277 beds by utilising verandahs and RAMC barracks rooms. A further expansion to 802 beds was achieved in October 1916, by pitching tents in the hospital grounds.\n\nStaff known to have served at Cottonera Hospital in 1917 were: Sister Taylor, Captain McWalter RAMC, Captain E W Newland RAMC, Captain Wheeler RAMC and Captain Adam Patrick RAMC. Sister McDougall was matron of Cottonera Hospital in 1917.\n\nOn 4 February 1918, Colonel Sir Charles Ballance ligated the first part of the left subclavian artery in a soldier of the Dublin Fusiliers who had developed a traumatic aneurysm. In July 1916, the soldier had been wounded by a bullet above the left clavicle.\n\nOn 13 January 1918, he was admitted to Cottonera Hospital from Salonica under the care of Lt Col Dundon RAMC with a numb and painful arm. X-rays showed a bullet still lodged in his chest above the right seventh rib with an aneurysmal sac of the subclavian artery.\n\nColonel Ballance assisted by Captain James Anderson RAMC operated to remove the aneurysm; Lt Colonel Herbert John Shirley gave the anaesthetic. The patient made an uneventful recovery, complicated only by an attack of tertian malaria.22\n\nOn 16 August 1915, No 454 Cpl Howard Taylor McKern A Coy 4th Battalion 1st Infantry Brigade AIF 21 years, a farmer, died of wounds at the Cottonera Hospital. On 12 August, Cpl McKern was transferred to Malta from 1st Australian Casualty Clearing Station Mudros on the hired transport Dunluce Castle. McKern had sustained a compound fracture of his left tibia and fibula from a shrapnel received in the fighting on Lone Pine Ridge. The wound became septic, resulting in the death of Cpl McKern from toxaemia and gas gangrene.\n\nHe was buried at Pieta Cemetery by Padre L Alford. Matron Harris and Sister Walsh communicated with his family regarding the disposal of his belongings.\n\nOn 26 October 1915, No 568 Pte Percival Charles Merritt 11th Battalion 3rd Infantry Bde AIF, 29 years, died at the Military Hospital Cottonera from enteric fever.

Seven new two storey blocks were occupied at the beginning of the year. A small hospital of 42 beds was also built at the same time as the barracks. The hospital opened in June 1901 and was used for all minor cases amongst the troops stationed there and at Fort Bingemma. During the Gallipoli Campaign, this small hospital became absorbed within the large war hospital which opened in Mtarfa Barracks.\n\nOn 24 March 1915, Blocks A (209 beds), B (209 beds), C (98 beds) and D (98 beds) Mtarfa Barracks were handed over to Captain Andrew Elliot RAMC (T) who became officer in charge Mtarfa Barrack Hospital.\n\nOn 3 April 1915, authority was received to increase the accommodation at Mtarfa to 400 beds and that at Forrest Hospital to 160 beds. Some of the married quarters were also prepared to admit cases of infectious diseases. On 8 May, the hospital was visited by Sir Frederick Treves and Colonel Sir Courtauld Thomson, Chief British Red Cross Commissioner for Malta. Sir Frederick Treves suggested using a trolley to move patients to and from the operating theatre. On 17 May, Mtarfa Barracks Hospital received its first convoy of 221 wounded. As more beds were required the hospital rapidly expanded, so that it had 1,853 beds by October 1916.\n\nOn 28 May 1915, a ward was set aside for enteric cases but from July to September, the hospital was reserved for the treatment of infectious diseases. It admitted patients with the enteric group of diseases, predominantly Bacillary dysentery as most soldiers had been protected against typhoid. Vaccination against typhoid alone, however, did not confer protection against the paratyphoid group of diseases, unless the troops had been vaccinated with a combined typhoid/paratyphoid A and B vaccine.\n\nBetween July 1915 to July 1916, Capt R P Garrow RAMC MD DPH worked at the Military Infectious Hospital Mtarfa investigating the source of enteric fever. He later became Medical Officer of Health in Chesterfield and Hornsey. Major W Broughton–Alcock RAMC was officer in charge of the laboratory Mtarfa Military Hospital.\n\nThe majority of patients with enteric fever were admitted to Mtarfa from Gallipoli with a few from Mudros, Salonica and Malta. Bacteriological work was also carried out at the hospital by Capt N Campbell RAMC and Dr Gertrude Margaret Dobrashian who in 1916 was a medical officer and registrar at Mtarfa. Other women doctors attached to the Mtarfa military hospital were Constance Muriel Astley Maer and Barbara Martin Cunningham.\n\nThe Military Infectious Hospital Mtarfa was commanded by Temporary Lieutenant Colonel George Basil Price RAMC. On enlistment, Dr G B Price received a temporary commission as a Lieutenant. He arrived in Malta and was shortly promoted to captain. By 1918, he held the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. Although essentially a clinician, he spared no efforts in becoming conversant with the intricacies of the administration of an army hospital. For some months he was also acting consulting physician to the Malta Command.21\n\nMtarfa Barracks Military Hospital closed down in February 1919.\n\nOn 21 July 1915, No 1386 Pte George Alexander Mercer C Coy 9th Infantry Battalion AIF, 28 years, a miner, died at Mtarfa Military Hospital of enteric. He disembarked at Malta from the HS Gascon on 18 July 1915 but failed to improve. He was buried at Pieta Military Cemetery by Padre A G McKinnon on 22 July 1915.\n\nOn 28 July 1915, No 1712 Pte Clifton Bluntish 5th Infantry Battalion AIF 19 years, a labourer, was admitted to Mtarfa Military Hospital from the HS Sicilia with dysentery. Pte Bluntish recovered and was transferred to Ghajn Tuffieha Convalescent Camp on 9 October. On 13 February 1916, he embarked for Cairo on HS Simla but was admitted to No 1 Australian Hospital Heliopolis on 19 February 1916 with appendicitis.\n\nOn 21 September 1915, No 497 Pte William John Burnes B Coy 19th Infantry Battalion AIF 34 years, a labourer, died of peritonitis and appendicitis at Mtarfa Hospital. He had been admitted to hospital at ANZAC on 19 September 1915 and transferred to Malta on HS Gascon. He was listed dangerously ill on 20 September and died on 21 September. He was buried at Addolorata Cemetery. He left a nine year old son and a six year old daughter.\n\nMilitary Hospital Valletta\n\n47631 LCpl J R Parsons A Section 32nd Fd Amb 31st Bde 10th Div MEF at Valletta Hospital Aug 1915.

After 1905, the number of soldiers falling ill with Mediterranean Fever declined so sharply, that the hospital was used only as a Military Families Hospital and a regimental hospital for the Royal Malta Artillery.\n\nOn 22 March 1915, the Royal Engineers converted the Long Ward to accommodate 200 patients. The work was completed by 25 April, when the Long Ward was ready for occupation. On 27 April, the Medical Officer in charge of the hospital was authorised to equip it with an additional 340 beds. On 30 April, the Military Families Hospital was transferred to the Auberge d'Aragon. On 3 May 1915, 15 nurses of the Scottish Women's Hospital started working at Valletta Hospital when the first batch of wounded arrived from Gallipoli.\n\nIn January 1917, the Valletta Military Hospital was commanded by Major Timothy William Octavius Sexton RAMC with Miss Brown as Matron. Major Sexton left for Salonica on 26 May 1918. Another commanding officer was Lt Col Slaughter RAMC. A Lieutenant Gillies RAMC was also reported to have served at the Valletta Hospital.\n\nWomen doctors associated with the hospital were: Dr Elizabeth Jane Moffett Dr Helen Beatrice De Rastricke Hanson, Dr Margaret Bernard Dobson and Doctor Isobel Addey Tate. Dr Tate, Serbian Relief Fund attached to the RAMC, was the daughter of Mr John Tate of Portadown and Mrs Isabella Tate of Belfast. She received her medical education at Queen's College Belfast graduating MB BCh BAO (RUI) in 1899. She obtained her MD three years later and her DPH in 1904. At the beginning of the war she volunteered for work in Serbia and was afterwards engaged at the Graylingwell War Hospital Chichester. She arrived in Malta in August 1916. She initially served at St Paul's Camp Hutment Hospital before moving to the Military Hospital Valletta, where she took charge of the bacteriological laboratory.\n\nDr Isobel Addey Tate died of typhoid fever at 11 am on Sunday 28 January 1917, at her residence No 5 Victoria Junction Sliema. She was buried with full military honours at Pieta Military cemetery on 30 January 1917.18 A wreath was laid by her colleagues from Valletta Military Hospital and the orderlies and staff of Ward 20 A and Ward 20 C.19\n\nDr Elizabeth Jane Moffett worked in ophthalmology with Temporary Captain J Kirk RAMC MD (Ed) Specialist Ophthalmologist Malta Command. During Spring 1917, a convoy of 80 young seriously ill soldiers arrived at the Valletta hospital from Macedonia with acute war nephritis. All had oedema with blood and albumin in their urine. Moffet and Kirk carried out repeated examinations of their patients' fundi and described the retinal exudation and optic nerve swelling associated with the disease.20\n\nOn 6 September 1915, No 1368 Pte Ernest Percy Wright 12th infantry Battalion 3rd Bde AIF, 23 years, a labourer, died at the Military Hospital Valletta from septicaemia. Wright had been wounded at Gallipoli on 7 August when he sustained a compound fracture of his right leg from an exploding bomb. He was admitted to No 3 Advanced Dressing Station ANZAC Base, transferred to No 1 Australian CCS, and embarked on the Dunluce Castle on 7 August. He disembarked at Malta on 12 August where he was listed dangerously ill. He died of septicaemia on 6 September. Pte Wright was buried at Pieta Military Cemetery by Padre E E Smith.\n\nOn 1 September 1915, No 537 Pte Alexander McKinnon 1st Light Horse Regiment AIF Machine Gun Section 31 years, a miner, died of wounds at Valletta Military Hospital. Pte McKinnon had proceeded to join the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force on the Gallipoli Peninsula on 9 May 1915. He was shot in his right thigh on 7 August. He disembarked at Malta from the hired transport Dunluce Castle on 12 August and succumbed to his wounds. Pte McKinnon was buried at Pieta Cemetery by Padre A G McKinnon. He left his personal effects to his sister, Mary McKinnon who in July 1915 was working at the City Hospital Little Bromwich, Birmingham, England. In May 1916, Mary was at the Military Hospital Thornhill, Aldershot.\n\nSt Andrew's Barracks Hospital\n\nSt Andrew's Barracks (Courtesy D. Darmanin)\n\nSt Andrew's War Hospital\n\nH Block Staff St Andrew's Barracks c. 1918.\n\nSt Andrew's Barracks was built in 1903 but not occupied by troops until April 1905. On 14 March 1915, the barracks and the huts were inspected by DDMS Sleman who found that hospital accommodation for 1,000 patients could be provided there. On 13 April, Chief Engineer Seaman and the DDMS once again visited St Andrews Barracks and arranged for the necessary work to be undertaken to adapt the barracks as a hospital. On 15 April, the 2nd/2nd (City of London) vacated the barracks and work commenced on 19 April.\n\nThe hospital consisted of nine separate blocks of buildings with 144 beds in each. Blocks A to H were converted into surgical wards and Block J into a medical ward. The detention cells served as a dispensary, the school as an isolation hospital. In addition tentage was erected in the grounds for overflow patients and as accommodation for the men of the RAMC. Four medical orderlies shared one tent.\n\nSt Andrew's Barracks Hospital was taken over by the RAMC on 4 May 1915. It provided 845 beds. On 8 May, Major James Charles Gordon Carmichael RAMC was appointed officer commanding St Andrew's Hospital. He had arrived in Malta with his family on 29 January 1914, and had served as medical officer attached to 2nd/Cameronian (Scottish Rifles) at Mellieha Camp and had been officer in charge Forrest Hospital St Julian's. Major Carmichael left for France on 24 April 1917, leaving his family in Malta.\n\nJohn William Heekes was surgeon to St Andrew's Hospital. Miss E. Macfarlane TFNS was Acting Matron and Sister Leonora Millicent Allender QAIMNSR served as Charge Nurse from 5 October 1815 to 8 April 1916. Others known to have served at St Andrew's were: Major Campbell RAMC, Captain E M Fannin RAMC, Captain Allen RAMC. The lady doctors were Bell Eliza Gould, Gilchrist Elizabeth Taylor, Gorrie Eleanor Amelia and Rougvie Mass Morrison. A Dr Nightingale and Sister Walsh were also recorded as having been at the hospital in June 1916.\n\nOn 9 May 1915, the hospital was visited by Sir Frederick Treves who made suggestions regarding the ventilation of the operating theatre and the conversion of an adjoining shed for sterilising all dressings. The first 300 wounded arrived on 12 May. St Andrew's Barracks Hospital expanded to 1,158 beds, including 60 beds for officers in the officers' mess. Between October 1916 and April 1917, sixteen soldiers invalided to Malta from Macedonia during the preceding five months developed Black-Water fever. There were three deaths. The patients were treated at St Andrew's and St David's Hospitals.\n\nFrom May 1915 to February 1916, it had admitted 9,506 patients, of which 1,636 were enteric and paratyphoid, 2,793 dysentery, 2,620 general disease and only 2,457 battle casualties.St Andrew's Barracks Hospital closed on 21 January 1919.\n\nOn 29 July 1915, No 56 Pte George Edgar Nurcombe A Coy 4th Battalion 1st Infantry Brigade AIF 19 years, a gas fitter, died of enteric. Pte Nurcombe arrived at Malta from Gallipoli on HS Gloucester Castle and was admitted to St Andrew's Hospital on 20 July 1915. He died of enteric fever on 29 July and was buried at Pieta Military Cemetery by Padre E Smith.\n\nOn 7 November 1915, No 403 Pte Edmund Connor 28th Battalion AIF 42 years, an engine fitter of locomotives, died at St Andrews Hospital from dysentery. He developed diarrhoea on 24 October and was admitted to 3rd Field Ambulance Gallipoli from where he was transferred to 13th Casualty Clearing Station on 27 October. He arrived at Malta on 2 November on the HS Rewa. He was listed as dangerously ill on 3 November and died on 7 November. Pte Connor was buried at Addolorata Cemetery by Padre T A Harker.\n\nSt George's Barracks Hospital\n\nHospital ship against St George's Barracks Hospital (Alice Welford Archives No 2010.064)\n\nSt George's Hospital with a VAD BRCS and Sister Louise QAIMNSR (AMS archives)\n\n1939 John King Smith died St George's Hospital 20 Nov 1915 (Addolorata Cemetery)\n\nSt George's Barracks was built in 1895 on the western side of St George's Bay. The company blocks were on two levels with the exception of blocks G and H. From 1904 to 1906, they were occupied continuously by one battalion. In 1906, St George's Barracks became a depôt for troops attending the annual musketry camp. The accommodation blocks were occupied for short periods at a time by detachments of different corps. The barrack rooms were infested with sand flies and mosquitoes. St George's Bay was the common bathing place for troops quartered at St Andrew's and St George's Barracks. One of the nursing sisters serving at St George's Hospital contracted Kala Azar (Visceral Leishmaniasis).\n\nOn 21 March 1915, St George's Barracks was assessed by DDMS Sleman as being capable of accommodating 520 patients. On 1 May, St George's Barracks was vacated and prepared to receive minor cases as a non-dieted hospital. It became a fully dieted hospital in September, when the number of beds increased from 840 to 1,000. St George's Hospital covered a large area as the majority of the wards were small, holding about 10 patients each. On 6 May, St George's Hospital received its first convoy of 237 patients. Between July and September 1915, St Andrew's, St George's and St Paul's Hospitals were almost exclusively used for dysentery and enteric cases. In July 1916, a further expansion took place by erecting tentage. In September 1916, St George's Hospital held a maximum of 1,412 beds. It closed down in October 1917.\n\nOn 8 August 1915, No 612 Pte William Robert Boyle 12 Battalion AIF 28 years, a labourer, was wounded by shrapnel in his leg and right shoulder. He was initially admitted to 3rd Field Ambulance from where he was transferred to 1st Australian Casualty Clearing Station. On 15 August Pte Boyle embarked on the HS Dunluce Castle. He was admitted to St George's Hospital on 12 August. On 26 August Pte Boyle was transferred on the HS Carnsbrook Castle to 4th London General Hospital Denmark Hill, England. On 22 August 1916, Pte William Robert Boyle was killed in action near Poziers, France.\n\nOn 15 November 1915, No 308 L/Cpl Frederick Keith Looker A Coy 22nd Battalion AIF 29 yrs, a bank clerk, died of jaundice. He fell ill with influenza on 24 October 1915 and was admitted to 6th Field Ambulance at ANZAC. On 28 October he was transferred to 1st Australian Casualty Clearing Station. On 2 November he embarked on HS Rewa and was admitted to St George's Hospital intensely jaundiced. He was listed dangerously ill on 13 November. L/Cpl Looker became comatose and died on 15 November. He was buried at Pieta Military Cemetery by Padre H Wheeler. His brother, Sergeant W R Looker 5th Battalion, also served at Gallipoli and died in France in 1916. His sister, Margaret Effie Looker, enlisted on 4 August 1915 as a staff nurse and served with No 2 and No 14 Australian General hospital in Egypt, France and England with the Australian Army Nursing Service.\n\nFort Tigné Hospital\n\nLt Joseph Mac Gowan 44 yrs, was stationed at St George's Hosp where he was seized with fever and died on 18 Sep 1915.

In 1913, the old wooden huts at the barracks were gradually replaced with modern barrack blocks. Three new blocks of married quarters, containing two to five rooms each for 21 families were also completed.\n\nTigné Barracks consisted of four blocks of three storeys each. Each floor in every block had four rooms which became 12 bedded wards and two small rooms used by the sisters and orderlies. On 1 May 1915, instructions were received to equip Tigné Barracks as a Convalescent Hospital. On 4 May, the first group of 370 slightly wounded patients reached the hospital. These were followed with another 200 cases on 6 May. At this time the hospital staff consisted of 1 Regular medical officer, 6 civilian surgeons, 1 RAMC and 12 civilian nursing orderlies.\n\nOn 20 May 1915, an operating theatre were built at Tigné and St Georges Barracks. In June 1915, Tigné Barracks Hospital was upgraded to a fully dieted hospital and reopened on 14 June as a surgical hospital with 600 beds. The officers mess was adapted into an officers hospital with 40 beds. The married quarters became the accommodation block for nursing sisters and orderlies. From September 1916 to July 1917, the number of beds was expanded by the erection of marquees in the hospital grounds. Tigné Barracks Hospital closed on 6 January 1919.\n\nSurgeon–Major Robert Randon RMA was officer commanding Military Hospital Tigné. His adjutant was Captain Reginald Wilton Treon Clampett MB (Univ Dub) who had been promoted from Temporary Lieutenant to Temporary Captain in June 1916. Captain Clampett relinquished his commission in August 1919. One of the women doctors at Tigné Hospital was Dr Beatrice Coxon.\n\nBoy Scouts, who wished to obtain their War Badge were used as general messengers in military hospitals. They were employed at Bighi, Floriana, Valletta, Cottonera, St Andrew's, Tigné Verdala and the tea rooms at Sliema. The scouts ran errands and did odd jobs for the patients besides taking specimens to the Central Laboratory for examination and X-ray plates to outlying hospitals.\n\nDuring the summer and autumn of 1916, many cases of bacillary dysentery were admitted to Tigné hospital from Macedonia. The officers involved in dealing with dysentery cases were: Capt J. Speares RAMC; civilian surgeon Peter Paul Debono attached to the RAMC; Capt Coleman RAMC and Capt Todd RAMC who both collected sera, Lt Col Price RAMC, OC Mtarfa Hospital and Lt Col O'Sullivan RAMC, Director of Laboratories at Malta. Dr Walter A Gilmour CBE MD FRACP DPH also served in the RAMC as a pathologist and bacteriologist in Malta, Salonica and Italy.\n\nDysentery is a general term applied to conditions characterised by the passage of blood and mucus in the stools. In amoebic dysentery the mucosa and sub mucosa of the colon is invaded with the parasite Entamoeba histolytica. Bacillary dysentery is due to infection of the wall of the colon with a variety of organisms. The two main groups are the Bacillus dysenteriae (Shiga) group, which gives rise to an intensely acute and severe form and the Bacillus dysenteriae (Flexner) group, which gives rise to a milder clinical type. The main complications of dysentery are acute hepatitis and acute liver abscesses (amoebic dysentery), perforation of the colon and gangrenous proctitis (either infection), and synovitis with effusion into the large joints (Bacillary dysentery only).\n\nOn 3 October 1915, Major William Aberdein Malcolm RAMC (TF) died in Malta of enteric fever contracted at the Dardanelles. He was the fourth son of George Malcolm of Dundee. He was educated at Edinburgh, where he graduated Bachelor of Medicine (MB) and Master in Surgery (CM) in 1883. After filling the appointments of house-surgeon and general superintendent of the Ayr County Hospital, he became surgeon to the North Islington and Holloway Dispensary. He was successively anaesthetist, casualty officer, registrar, and clinical assistant in the skin department at the Great Northern Central Hospital. Malcolm was also medical officer to the Post Office, and honorary medical officer to the Charity Organization Society. He was a Fellow of the London Medical Society, a member of the Harveian Society, and a past president of the North London Medico–Chirurgical Society. He joined the 11th (County of London) Battalion of the London Regiment (Finsbury Rifles), as Lieutenant and Medical Officer on 21 October 1902, and attained the rank of Major on 21 November 1914.\n\nDiarrhoeal diseases formed one of the largest problems in Gallipoli. In the summer of 1915, Cape Helles was synonymous with the red flux of dysentery. During June, July, August and September 1915, there was a low rainfall accompanied by a comparatively high temperature and an abundance of flies. This created ideal conditions for the spread of fly borne diseases such as the enteric group of diseases and viral hepatitis. From October onwards, the fall in temperature and the increased rainfall decreased the incidence of diarrhoea remarkably, while amoebic dysentery was replaced with bacillary dysentery. The incidence of paratyphoid A infections which caused a more severe diarrhoea than infections with paratyphoid B also increased.\n\nOn 26 November 1915, No 456 Pte William McKinnon B Coy 25th Battalion, 32 years, a labourer, died of wounds. He had sustained a shrapnel injury to his abdomen on 2 November 1915. He was admitted to 16th Casualty Clearing Station at ANZAC from where he was transferred to Malta on HS Devanha. He was admitted to Tigné Military Hospital on 12 November and was listed dangerously ill on 23 November. Pte McKinnon died on 26 November 1915 and was buried at Pieta Military Cemetery by Padre W Cowan.\n\nOn 2 October 1915, No 2026 Pte Archie McPhee 16th Battalion AIF 36 years, a sleeper cutter, died of wounds at Tigné Hospital Malta. He had been shot in the knee on 27 August 1915 and was transferred from Gallipoli to Mudros. He disembarked at Malta on 4 September from HS Devanha. Pte McPhee died of his wounds and was buried at Pieta Military Cemetery by Padre W G Pearce.\n\nSt Paul's Camp Hutment Hospital\n\nSt Andrew's and St George's Barracks with area location of hospitals.\n\nPte Walter Henry Scott at home St Paul's Camp Hutment Hospital near St Andrew's Barracks. (Courtesy archive W H Scott supplied by his grandson P Scott)\n\nSt Paul's Hospital Camp (Courtesy D Darmanin)\n\nSt Paul's Hutment Hospital consisted of 850 beds in 34 modern huts of the special War Office pattern for hutment hospitals. The huts were shipped from England and erected on high ground near St Andrew's Barracks overlooking the rifle ranges at Pembroke. They had no verandahs and were not suitable for the hot Maltese summer. The Royal Engineers provided concrete bases for all the huts, a large stone kitchen, water carriage throughout the entire hospital and electric light.\n\nThe first convoy of 153 patients arrived on 25 September 1915, but the full complement of 792 beds was not ready until the end of October. A YMCA marquee was erected in the hospital grounds in early November 1915. RAMC orderlies were in charge of the wards until nursing sisters arrived for duty in early November. The hospital admitted patients from Salonica with malaria and dysentery. Phlebotomus or sand fly fever was also common. This was a self limiting febrile illness with severe frontal headaches treated by the early administration of opium.\n\nMajor Surpell RAMC was officer in charge of St Paul's Camp Hutment Hospital; Miss Clements was Matron. In 1816, Dr Isobel A Tate worked at St Paul's Hospital before moving to the Military Hospital Valletta. Dr E A Seale was another doctor attached to the RAMC for a year who worked at St Paul's Hospital.\n\nBy January 1916, the hospital was practically empty and some of the wards were closed down; it only had 180 patients in February. St Paul's Hospital closed down in May 1916. The remaining patients were transferred to other hospitals, while the marquees were struck and packed away. The hospital staff left on 29 May for All Saints Convalescent Camp.\n\nHamrun Technical Institute Hospital\n\nThe Technical Institute at Hamrun was built in 1912 and except for the basement had not been used. It was situated on the western outskirts of the town. On 11 May 1915, DDMS Sleman and Lt Col Seaman RE visited Hamrun Technical College and found that the premises could be converted into a temporary hospital, once baths and gas cooking apparatus were installed. The Hamrun Hospital was opened in June 1915 and run by the British Red Cross Society. It had 106 beds. It received its first patients on 10 June 1915, every bed being filled in less than an hour. In November 1915, it was converted into an officers hospital with 80 beds and came entirely under the control of the military authorities.\n\nLt Arthur Donald Griffith FRCS RAMC (T), an ophthalmologist, was officer commanding. On 10 March, he received additional pay as specialist while working as an ophthalmologist in Malta. The nursing duties were performed by No.1 Mediterranean Nursing Unit – a voluntary body of ladies organised by Lady Ian Hamilton. The hospital closed in July 1917.\n\nAuberge de Bavière Hospital\n\nThe Auberge de Bavière in Valletta was the headquarters of the Command Paymaster and had been an Officers' Mess for the infantry in Lower St Elmo Barracks. On 21 May 1915, the pay office relocated to No 9 Strada Zecca and the Auberge was handed over to the Royal Engineers. It was ready to receive casualties on 15 June. It had a hundred beds which were increased to 155 in August 1915. Surgical cases of a very severe nature were admitted to the Bavière Hospital. During the autumn of 1915, it received most of the serious perforating injuries of the head. Of the 33 cases under the care of Colonel William Thorburn, 15 died from meningitis while 18 recovered sufficiently to be sent to England. Twenty–four cases of compound fractures of the skull required surgical intervention. There were only a small number of patients with injuries to the spinal cord but many with peripheral nerve injuries. Most of the spinal casualties were sent to England without any surgical intervention, other than an occasional laminectomy to relieve pressure on the spinal cord. The Auberge de Bavière Hospital closed on 14 August 1917.\n\nOn 31 July 1915, No 502 Tpr Frank Vendy C Coy 4th Light Horse Regiment AIF, 24 yrs, a saddler, died at the Auberge de Bavière Hospital. Frank had sustained a compound fracture of his skull on 21 July 1915. He was admitted to 1st Australian Casualty Clearing Station and transferred to Malta on 29 July on HS Sicilia, where he was listed as dangerously ill. He died of wounds received in action at Gallipoli. On 2 August Tpr Vendy was buried at Pieta Military Cemetery by Padre W G Pearce.\n\nOn 14 August 1915, No 1389 Cpl Frederick Hanson Merry 1st Battalion AIF, 23 years, a grocer, died at the Auberge de Bavière Hospital. Merry had been hit in the head by a piece of shell at Lone Pine on 6 August. He was transferred to Malta on 12 August on HS Dunluce Castle but died of his wounds.\n\nFloriana Barracks Hospital\n\nMap showing Floriana Barracks between 1900 and 1902 (TNA:WO 78/2459)\n\nFloriana Market became an Officers Mess for Floriana Barracks\n\nFloriana Barracks Hospital\n\nFloriana Barracks consisted of an old barracks situated between the Civil Hospital and the former Poor House or Ospizio, and a new barracks, called Lintorn Barracks, after the Governor of Malta General Sir John Lintorn Simmons (1884 – 1888). The latter consisted of three modern blocks with corresponding outbuildings which were erected in 1903. Each block was built to the same plan and consisted of double stories with two rooms on each floor. A and B Blocks faced the parade ground in an easterly direction, C Block was built at right angles and faced north. Between these blocks and the harbour on the west were three disused cemeteries. On 22 May 1915, No 20 Piazza Maggiore was taken over by the engineers and adapted for nurses quarters.\n\nOn 25 May 1915, the 2nd/4th (City of London) vacated Floriana Barracks; on 26 May instructions were issued to convert Floriana Barracks into a hospital. On 3 June, Floriana Barracks was transformed into a hospital with 600 beds, which increased to 700 beds in November 1915. The barrack rooms made excellent wards for 25 cases each, the NCO's bunk becoming a duty room. The Officers Mess in the former Floriana Market became a nursing sisters' home. The adjoining residences of the Commanding Officer and of the Commander Royal Engineers were shortly afterwards turned into a hospital for 30 sisters. The women doctors were accommodated in the married quarters of Floriana Barracks.\n\nOn 9 June, the first 249 patients arrived and a further 236 were admitted on 14 June 1915. The hospital treated mainly surgical cases. It was commanded by Lt Col Kennet Bruce Barnett with Miss Osborne as Matron.Another officer who commanded Floriana Hospital and Ghajn Tuffieha Camp was Lt Col Edward Leopold Rowse RAMC (T) of Putney who served in Malta from 1915 to 1918. One of the women doctors attached to Floriana Hospital was Ethne Haigh.\n\nFloriana Barracks Hospital closed in April 1916 but reopened in September 1916 with 704 beds to prepare for the influx of malaria patients from Macedonia. In December 1916, it increased its beds to 1,304 through the use of hospital marquee on the parade ground. The hospital finally closed on 30 April 1917. Sister Margaret McKay McKenzie QAIMNSR is known to have worked at the hospital from September 1916 until she left for Salonica on 12 April 1917 on HMHS Llandovery Castle.\n\nOn 5 December 1915, 1796 Pte Edgar Gordon McLean A Coy 27th Battalion AIF, 21 years, a steamboat officer, died at the Military Hospital Floriana. He had sustained a gun shot wound to his abdomen at Gallipoli on 25 November 1915 and was admitted to 16th Casualty Clearing Station. Pte McLean was transferred to Malta on 3 December on the HS Glenart Castle. He was listed as dangerously ill on 4 December and died of his wounds the following day. He was buried at Pieta Military Cemetery by Padre M A Farren.\n\nOn 13 September 1915, no 1781 Pte Brady Felix John 18th Battalion AIF, 21 years, a deck hand, died at the Military Hospital Floriana. On 27 August 1915, Pte Brady had been shot in his chest and shoulder in Gallipoli. His lung was perforated. He was transferred to Mudros and onwards to Malta on HS Nile on 5 September. He was admitted to Floriana Hospital on 9 September, listed dangerously ill on 10 September and died of his wounds. He was buried at Addolorata Cemetery on 14 September.\n\nSt Ignatius College Hospital\n\nStaff of St Ignatius Hospital in the garden of the hospital. Dr I Stenhouse is in third row wearing a hat.

Adjacent to it, in Old College Street was the Jesuit's Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus which opened in 1881. The Jesuit's College closed down in July 1907 and remained unused for many years.\n\nOn 11 May 1915, DDMS Sleman and Lt Col Seaman RE accompanied Sir Frederick Treves and Sir Courtland Thompson BRC on an inspection of the Jesuit's College and Bugeja Institute and found that with alterations both premises could be converted into temporary hospitals. On 13 May, a conference was held at the Palace Valletta in the presence of Sir Frederick Treves and Sir Courtland Thompson BRC and the DDMS, where it was decided to put the Jesuit's College and Bugeja Institute in hand for hospitals. In April, the Royal Engineers refurbished the building converting it into St Ignatius Military Hospital with 155 beds. An operating theatre with an X-ray room were installed.\n\nSt Ignatius Hospital was initially used as a surgical facility. The first batch of 84 patients arrived on 2 July 1915. In 1917, the hospital was adapted to take mental patients. St Ignatius Hospital closed in January 1919. One of the woman doctors working as a surgeon at St Ignatius hospital was Dr Isabella Stenhouse. Dr Stenhouse qualified in 1913 from Edinburgh University where she won the Dorothy Gilfillan prize for the most distinguished woman medical graduate of the year. On 24 July 1916, she was contracted by the Army Medical Department for a period of twelve months on a salary of twenty four shillings a day, inclusive of all allowances, except travelling expenses on duty. A gratuity of £60 was payable at the end of her contract. In 1915, a major in the RAMC received 28 shillings a day in pay and field allowances while a civilian medical practitioner, newly recruited into the New Army, was given 24 shillings a day. Dr Stenhouse arrived in Malta in August 1916 and embarked for Egypt on 4 May 1918.\n\nSt David's Hospital\n\nPte Percy Roberts and Pte Albert F Pilcher Australian Light Horse Field Ambulance AIF at St Patricks Hospital Tal Bal Lal 4 Oct 1915.

The rocky ground for the large hospital marquees was levelled by the engineers and roads, paths, gardens, kitchens, ablutions, baths and stores were constructed. The camp commandant was Major Charles Henry Carr RAMC.\n\nOn 25 July 1915, St David's Hospital was ready to receive 500 patients. By August, it had become fully equipped for 1,000 beds. Initially, St David's admitted mild surgical and convalescents, but like all other hospitals it was soon busy with the ever increasing stream of dysentery and enteric cases. In April 1916, the number of beds was reduced to 400, but in July 1916, it was increased once again up to a maximum of 1,168 beds.\n\nOn 13 October 1915, the Presbyterian Guild Tent was opened at St David's Hospital by HE the Governor Lord Methuen. The large recreational tent was a gift from the Guild of the United Free Church of Scotland which raised the necessary funds following an appeal from the the Rev Albert G MacKinnon Senior Presbyterian Chaplain.\n\nBetween October 1916 and April 1917, sixteen soldiers invalided to Malta from Macedonia during the preceding five months developed Black–Water fever. There were three deaths. The patients were treated at St Andrew's and St David's Hospitals. The medical staff at St David's Hospital were: Lt Barrett RAMC and Dr Hollway Edith Blake. From February 1917 to July 1918, Capt Adam Patrick RAMC treated patients with malaria from Macedonia with intravenous quinine bihydrochloride and antimony tartrate23.\n\nOn 2 May 1917, St David's Military Hospital mobilised as No 62 General Hospital. It arrived at Salonica on 11 July 1917. The staff included: Lt Col Carr Charles Henry, Commanding Officer, Capt Prance C H G, Capt Leigh B H, Capt Glen D, Capt Barrett W C P, Capt Morgan R J, Capt Gore W G, and Lt (QM) Percy J W. The lady doctors were: Drs Hollway Edith Blake, Murphy Josephine Lillie, Fergus Annie Grange, and Murray Mary Dorothea. In addition there were a Matron, 8 sisters, 1 staff nurse (QAIMNSR) and 15 VADs, 1 Warrant Officer, 3 Staff Sergeants, 11 Sgts, 5 Cpls, 5 L/Cpls and 111 RAMC ptes. No 62 General Hospital embarked for Salonica on the HMT Ship Abbassieh in July 1917 and arrived at Salonica on 11 July 1917.\n\nOn 27 September 1915, No 281 Pte Cassidy William Leslie 18th Battalion AIF, 18 years, a labourer, was admitted to St David's Hospital with diarrhoea and debility. He arrived in Malta on the hired transport Dunluce Castle. On 1 November he was well enough to be transferred to Ghajn Tuffieha Convalescent Camp. He embarked for Alexandria on 20 December 1916. On 17 June 1919, Pte Leslie was awarded the Military Medal for bravery in the field.\n\nOn 31 August 1918, during the operation against Mont St Quentin near Péronne he showed total disregard to his own safety when he attended the wounded under heavy machine gun and shell fire. A party of engineers were repairing a bridge which was being heavily shelled. The bridge was hit and there were a number of casualties. Cassidy and two others at once went to their assistance, dressed their wounds and assisted them to the Dressing Station. They then returned and carried other wounded men away while under constant shelling. Later when their company sustained heavy casualties, Cassidy and others carried from the front line many wounded while under heavy machine gun and shell fire. They worked continuously for 10 hours saving the lives of a number of wounded men who would have died had they not been moved at once.\n\nOn 18 July 1915, No 207 Cpl Charles Edward Bromley 7th Battalion AIF, 25 years, a Fitter, disembarked at Malta from Gallipoli from the HS Gascon. He was admitted to Tigné Military Hospital with severe conjunctivitis. On 2 August he was transferred to St David's Hospital and when he had recovered sufficiently was moved to All Saints Convalescent Camp. Cpl Bromley left Malta for Egypt on 23 March 1916 on the HS Essequibo. On 27 March 1916, he was admitted to 3rd Australian General Hospital with dysentery. In July 1917 he was posted to the Armourers' School at Woolwich. On 11 August 1918, Cpl Bromley married staff nurse Elsie Rose Edwards at Woolwich Register office. They returned to Australia in November 1918.\n\nSt Patrick's Hospital\n\nCapt Foley and Sister Rutledge H Lines St Patricks Hospital July 1916 (Mary Muscat's WWI photo album)\n\nPatients in B2 tent St Patricks Hospital with Sister Stacey QAIMNSR Aug - Oct 1915\n\n(RAMC 1081/1/8 photo album of Pte Percy Roberts AIF).\n\nPatients at St Patricks Hospital with Sister Leavey QAIMNSR Aug - Oct 1915\n\n(RAMC 1081/1/8 photo album of Pte Percy Roberts AIF)\n\nMajor Evans at St Patricks Hospital 1917 (Mary Muscat's WWI photo album)\n\nSister Clements Matron St Patricks Hospital 28 Jan 1917 (Mary Muscat's WWI photo album).\n\nCapt Underwood, Capt foley and Lt Peck at St Patricks Hospital 1916 (Mary Muscat's WWI photo album)\n\nCapt Clow with patients from Lines G 7 St Patricks Jan 1917 (Mary Muscat's WWI photo album).\n\nCapt Hedley RAMC at St Patricks Hospital 6 March 1917 (Mary Muscat's WWI photo album)\n\nRAMC NCOs at St Patricks Hospital 1917 (Mary Muscat's WWI photo album)\n\nLt Binley RAMC at St Patricks Hospital 1917\n\n(Mary Muscat's WWI photo album).\n\nCapt Will RAMC in H Lines St Patricks Hospital 1917 (Mary Muscat's WWI photo album).\n\nSt Patricks Hospital at Tal Bal Lal (Mary Muscat's WWI photo album)\n\nSt Patrick's Hospital was similar in equipment, size and general features to St David's. The hospital marquees were laid out on terraced fields some distance from the sea, but the ground was open and easily drained. The ground floor of a large farm house was adapted to take hospital stores, while the rooms on the first floor were converted into a Sisters' Mess. The hospital had a recreation hall for patients. On 15 August 1915, St Patrick's Hospital received 466 minor walking cases which were transferred from other hospitals. By the end of month the hospital had filled up 978 of its 1,000 beds.\n\nSt Patricks Hospital closed in 1917. The nursing staff including the volunteers moved out on 29 April 1917 and were redistributed to the other hospitals. On 25 June 1917, St Patrick's Military Hospital was reconfigured as No 61 General Hospital. The medical and nursing staff consisted of: 12 officers, 8 lady doctors, 38 female nursing staff, 3 Warrant Officers (one QM) and 204 other ranks. Colonel A. Kennedy was officer commanding. On 4 July 1917, No 61 General Hospital left Malta on HMT Abbassieh escorted by HMS Aster and HMS Azalia. About 13 miles off Malta its two escorting vessels struck mines, resulting in the sinking of HMS Aster. HMT Abbassieh and the remaining escort returned to Malta and anchored off Marsaxlokk. On 6 July 1917, HMT Abbassieh with 61, 62 and 64 General Hospitals sailed off escorted by HIM Japanese destroyers J and K. It entered Salonica (Thessalonika) harbour on 11 July 1917.\n\nOn 10 October 1915, No 300 Tpr Thomas Charles Edwards 12th Light Horse Regiment, 26 years, a Settler, was admitted to St Patrick's hospital with dysentery. He fell ill at Gallipoli on 4 October and was admitted to 1st Australian Casualty Clearing Station from where he embarked on the HS Assaye for Malta. He recovered from his illness and on 20 November was admitted to All Saints Convalescent Camp. On 2 December 1915, he embarked on HMT Nile and returned to his unit. On 17 April 1919 Cpl Edwards was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal.\n\nOn 25 September 1918, during the attack on Semakh he displayed conspicuous gallantry in capturing enemy positions single handed. He captured fourteen of the enemy and all through showed a fine example of dash, courage and devotion to duty.\n\nNo 187 L/Cpl Leslie Featherstone Australian Provost Corps, 18 years, a farmer, disembarked at Malta from Gallipoli from the HS Assaye. He was admitted to St Patrick's Hospital on 10 October 1915 with Rheumatic Fever. On recovering he was transferred to All Saints Convalescent Camp from where he rejoined his unit on 7 December 1915.\n\nSt Elmo School Hospital Valletta\n\nIn July 1915, two civil Government Schools, St John's and St Elmo, which occupied the site where now stands the Evans building in Merchant Street Valletta, were refurbished and converted into a hospital. St Elmo school was destroyed by bombings in the Second World War which also demolished the nearby historic Nibbia Chapel. The basements were used for stores. School children were moved to the old barrack rooms at Fort Lower St Elmo. St Elmo Hospital became operational on 12 August 1915. It had 218 beds with the verandah running along the class rooms accommodating an extra 100 beds. The hospital admitted mainly surgical casualties. It remained a surgical hospital even when the rush of enteric cases had transformed most of the other surgical units into medical ones. Miss Stones was Matron of St Elmo Hospital. The hospital closed in 1918.\n\nOn 16 February 1918, Dr Sarah Marguerite White MD MS assisted Colonel Ballance in an operation to remove a bullet from the right ventricle of the heart of No 75965 Tpr Robert Hugh Martin Derbyshire Yeomanry. Tpr Martin, 21 years, had been wounded on 14 November 1917. He had exploratory surgery at 40th Casualty Clearing Station Hospital Salonica, from where he was transferred to No 63 General Hospital Salonica. On 13 January 1918, Tpr Martin was admitted to St Elmo Hospital with the bullet still in his right ventricle. On 16 February, an attempt was made to remove it. Lt Colonel Herbert John Shirley gave the anaesthetic. The bullet lay near the apex of the heart on the right side of the posterior inter–ventricular groove inside the ventricle. Col Ballance, assisted by Dr White, removed the bullet with a pair of artery forceps introduced into the cavity of the right ventricle. Tpr Robert Hugh Martin survived the operation but died on 14 March from sepsis.24\n\nOn 4 October 1915, No 1662a Pte Boag Henry Ernest 18th Battalion AIF 25 years, a pitman, was wounded in his right thigh by a bomb shrapnel at Gallipoli. He was transferred to Malta on HS Assaye from 1st Australian Casualty Clearing Station. On 10 October, Pte Boag was admitted to St Elmo Hospital, and on recovering was transferred to St Peter's Convalescent Camp Ghajn Tuffieha. He was discharged from St Peter's on 20 December 1915 and returned to Egypt on HT Bornu on 8 January 1916.\n\nSt John's Hospital Sliema\n\nSt John Hospital checking linen sent to laundry\n\n(Mary Muscat's WWI photo album)\n\nSt John Hospital Qm Stores (Mary Muscat's WWI photo album)\n\nSt John Hospital Xmas 1916 (Mary Muscat's WWI photo album)\n\nSt John's Hospital detachment Christmas Dinner 1916 (Mary Muscat's WWI photo album)\n\nSt John's Hospital 1 Sep 1915 – 9 Oct 1917 in the Government Elementary School, Blanche Huber Street, Sliema.\n\nSt John's School in Sliema was commenced in 1908 and completed in 1910. It had been used for a short time as barracks for troops but these left on 22 August 1915. On 1 September 1915, the children from the Government Elementary School were moved to the Carmelite Convent in Balluta Bay and the school became St John's Military Hospital. 50 school rooms arranged on two floors around a quadrangle made excellent wards for 400 patients, which, with the addition of the verandahs provided ample accommodation for 510 patients.\n\nSt John's hospital had its own operating theatre and X-ray room and had been fitted out as a surgical hospital. However, it had to become a medical hospital to cope with the large number of enteric cases arriving at Malta. In September 1916, St John's Hospital increased its beds to 520 beds. It closed in October 1917.\n\nOn 22 September 1915, No 1131 Pte Kenneth Bayliss B Coy 17th Battalion AIF, 18 years, a machinist, was admitted to St John's Hospital from HS Somali with gastritis. On 10 October, he was moved to Mtarfa Hospital. He recovered and was transferred to Ghajn Tuffieha Convalescent Camp on 29 November. Pte Bayliss returned to Egypt on 4 January on HT Bornu. On 14 April 1916, he was admitted to No 3 Australian General Hospital Abbassia with pulmonary tuberculosis and was invalided home to Australia on HS Kawowna.\n\nStaff Nurse Dorothy Mortimer Watson TFNS died at St John's hospital on 13 March 1917.

Twenty eight of the huts were used as wards; the rest as operating theatres, dispensary and recreation areas. The buildings around the barrack square were converted into stores, offices, quarters for sisters and the VAD detachment and an officers' mess. The lazaretto on Manoel Island was used as an officers hospital of 80 beds.\n\nIn February 1917, Manoel Island Hospital had 850 beds, but expanded to 1,184 beds by the erection of 38 hospital marquees on the parade ground between the hutments. Manoel Island was also prepared to serve as a military quarantine station for cases of cholera and smallpox, if the need arose. The sisters' quarters and mess were briefly used as a small infectious hospital for sisters, but in February 1916, this small hospital closed down and reopened at St George's Hospital.\n\nOn 5 November 1915, the first 50 patients infected with scabies were isolated in tents on Manoel Island. On 3 December 1915, another 195 patients were admitted. The casualties included a number of Indian Native troops. Manoel Island Hospital closed on 2 December 1918.\n\nLt Colonel Herbert John Shirley, Consulting Anaesthetist Malta Command was in charge of the Manoel Military Hospital. Colonel Shirley had enlisted and served with the British Expeditionary Force as a lieutenant colonel in the 2nd/5 Lancashire Fusiliers. In 1917, he exchanged to the RAMC. At the end of the war he served as the Senior Medical Officer in a motor transport division of the Royal Army Service Corps. He retained his military rank when as a brevet colonel he commanded the Artists' Rifles.\n\nSpinola Camp Hospital\n\nSpinola Hospital: Capt Oscar De Jong, Capt H G R Jamieson, ? Capt Allamy, ?

The old fort consisted of four empty gun emplacements, three magazines, one married quarter and a few small buildings. Around the fort was a moat; between the moat and the sea was an area of very rough and irregular rocky glacis where hospital marquees were pitched. The fort was adapted for administration and stores. A kitchen was provided in a wide passage in the centre of the fort; the underground magazines became linen, pack and clothing stores where an ablution and bath room were made in the two large gun emplacements.\n\nSpinola Hospital opened in early November 1915 but was not actually used till January 1916 and then for 169 patients only. It was initially equipped with 300 beds. By the end of December 1915, it had received 1,022 patients. It was closed in March 1916 but re-opened with 300 beds in September 1916. It expanded to a maximum of 1,168 beds in October 1916.\n\nThe lady doctors at Spinola Hospital were Dr Margaret Ann Hendry Stewart, Dr Elizabeth Mary Edwards and Dr Margaret Gemmell Ormiston. Another medical officer at Spinola Hospital was Dr Oscar M de Jong RAMC MB ChB DPH who arrived in Malta on the HS Britannic on 18 October 1916.\n\nDr Oscar M de Jong (1888–1924) was born in Ardwick, Manchester in 1888. He was the son of Dr E M de Jong. He was educated at Manchester where he graduated MB ChB with honours in 1914. He took the DPH the following year and was offered a research fellowship in the Faculty of Public Health of Manchester University, but was unable to accept due to military service. During the war de Jong served in Salonica, Malta and England. He was an Honorary Clinical Assistant in the skin department of the Liverpool Royal Infirmary, and medical officer to the venereal diseases clinic at the Royal Southern Hospital, Liverpool. In 1923, he presented a paper on the aetiology of dermatitis affecting baker's hands, where he showed that those who mixed flour soaked in a salt solution were at risk of developing a salt crystal dermatitis.25 Dr de Jong was an assistant director of the clinical laboratory of the Manchester Royal Infirmary, and assistant Medical Officer of Health at Liverpool and Salford. On 18 January 1924, Dr de Jong died at his residence Eversley Blundellsands, 26 Rodney Street Liverpool, from pneumonia.26\n\nSome of the medical and nursing staff of Spinola Hospital were incorporated into No 64 British General Hospital. This deployed to Salonica on 1 June 1917 on HMT Abassieh. The hospital staff were: Captain Douglas (pathologist), Captain H G R Jamieson (assistant pathologist), Dr M A H Stewart (assistant surgeon), Captain H G Johnson (anaesthetist), Captain H C Smythe (radiographer and dermatologist).\n\nFort Ricasoli Hospital\n\nIn October 1915, Fort Ricasoli was converted into a hospital of 800 beds, of which 224 were in 8 barrack rooms and 576 in tents pitched on the large parade ground. The hospital received its first casualties on 6 November 1915. By the end of the month it had admitted 503 sick. Another 942 patients were admitted in December 1915 and January 1916. No further admissions to Fort Ricasoli Hospital were made after 27 January 1916. The hospital closed down at the end of March 1916.\n\nOn 16 November 1915, no 74 Tpr Robert James McCreedy 2nd Light Horse Regiment Machine Gun Section AIF, 24 years, a Shunter, died at Cottonera Hospital. On 29 May 1915, Tpr McCreedy sustained a shrapnel injury to the right side of his face. On 31 May, he embarked at Gallipoli on HS Neuralia. He arrived at Malta and was admitted to St Andrew's Hospital on 5 June 1915. On 26 June he was transferred to the depôt at Fort Ricasoli and returned to the Gallipoli Peninsula on HS Ascania on 19 July 1915. On 7 November 1915, he had a severe attack of cholecystitis and was admitted to hospital at Gallipoli. He was transferred to Malta on HS Devanha on 12 November with jaundice but was certified as having died of pneumonia at Cottonera Hospital on 16 November 1915. Tpr McCreedy was buried at Pieta Military Cemetery by Padre A G McKinnon.\n\nBlue Sisters Hospital\n\nIn May 1915, the Mother Superior and Nursing Sisters of the Little Company of Mary offered their services and beds in their nursing home Casa Leone XIII and the adjoining Zammit Clapp Hospital. The sisters were known as the Blue Sisters from their distinctive blue veils. The hospital opened on 6 May 1915 with 50 beds for officers. The charge of maintenance of officers and others at Blue Sisters Hospital and Villa Dragonara was 2s 6d a day.\n\nIn June 1915, Pte Arthur Behrend East Lancashire Regiment, 18 years was admitted to the hospital with dysentery. In his book Make me a soldier, Behrend mentions a Giovanni Rutter, a doctor at the Blue Sisters' hospital who was said to have had a characteristic beard.\n\nConvalescent Camps Malta 1915 – 1919\n\nConvalescent Depôts received officers and men who required no further medical or surgical intervention and who although not yet fit for duty were likely to become so in a reasonable short time. The Convalescent Depôts ensured that acute beds in military hospitals were not blocked by those who no longer needed them. The patients admitted to these establishments had not only to be well enough to look after themselves, but also, be able to contribute to the construction and running of the camps.\n\nThe British Red Cross Society, the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), the Church Army and private individuals all co-operated to create an ambiance where the troops could relax, read newspapers, write their letters and recover their strength. The Malta Union Club placed a portion of their premises at Ghar id-Dud Sliema at the disposal of the Ladies Committee to serve as tea room. In November 1915, the Australian Branch of the British Red Cross Society donated £2,000 for the construction of Australia Hall. The building was erected by the Royal Engineers on a central site between St Andrew's and St Paul's Hospitals. It opened in January 1916 as a recreation hall for 2,000 convalescents in the St Andrew's, Pembroke and St George's catchment zone. The hall was managed by the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) and the British Red Cross Society. In May 1916, however, Australia Hall was placed under the sole management of the British Red Cross Society.\n\nAll Saints Convalescent Camp\n\nAll Saints Convalescent Camp leave pass issued to 38591 Cpl E V Mills on 29 Jan 1917.

Stanhope)\n\nAll Saints Camp Jan 1916\n\nOn 8 June 1915, Lieutenant Colonel Mabin from New Zealand, was ordered to prepare a camp for 1,000 convalescents. The camp was later expanded to 1,600 by the addition of extra tentage. All Saints Convalescent Camp occupied rough and rocky ground rising well above the sea. It was situated near St Andrew's Barracks and the camps and hospitals of St Paul's and St David's. It overlooked the Pembroke Rifle Range. Only two permanent buildings existed which were used for stores. Most of the work of leveling the ground and cutting drains in the rock was accomplished by the convalescents themselves. The Royal Engineers assisted with the erection of two kitchens, ablutions and drying rooms and the necessary sanitary work. Water had to be laboriously carted from St George's Barracks and the water ration was limited to one gallon per head for almost a month. The situation only improved when the engineers assembled a 5,000 gallon tank.\n\nOn 12 June 1915, the first batch of 420 convalescents were admitted from Tigné Hospital. By 29 June there were over 1,000 men in the camp. As water was scarce those who were able to, were encouraged to keep clean by sea bathing. Only a skeleton staff was maintained and practically all the camp work was undertaken by the convalescents. Parades for bathing, Swedish drill, and route marches were established, and soon the men became fit enough to return to their units. In March 1916, All Saints Camp moved to the site of Spinola Camp Hospital which had closed down.\n\nFort Chambray Convalescent Camp Gozo\n\nIn October 1915, Fort Chambray in the neighbouring island of Gozo opened as a convalescent camp for 400 rank and file. It supplemented the over crowded camp of All Saints. Fort Chambray Camp Gozo had its own journal The Fort Chambray Gazette.\n\nThe camp was rather isolated as the convalescents had to cross the channel between Malta and Gozo if they wanted to meet their regimental comrades. Fort Chambray Convalescent Camp processed 1,579 men, who were all returned to active service.\n\nFort Chambray Convalescent Camp was shut in March 1916.\n\nConvalescent Camp Ghajn Tuffieha\n\nGhajn Tuffieha Convalescent Camp Aug - Oct 1915\n\n(RAMC 1081/1/8 photo album of Pte Percy Roberts AIF).\n\nGhajn Tuffieha Convalescent Camp August - October 1915\n\n(RAMC 1081/1/8 photo album of Pte Percy Roberts AIF).\n\nGhajn Tuffieha Camp\n\nConvalescent Camp Ghajn Tuffieha\n\n(Courtesy J Camilleri)\n\nChurch Army and CEMS Camp Hall 1916 Ghajn Tuffieha Camp\n\nConvalescent camps Ghajn Tuffieha\n\nIn August 1915, work began on converting the military camp at Ghajn Tuffieha into a convalescent hospital for 5,000 patients. Early in August, the Governor, Lord Methuen ordered a portion of the camp at Ghajn Tuffieha to be opened as a disciplinary compound for those causing trouble in the hospitals. The camp was in its very early stages of development and the rooms had trestles and boards but no mattresses. Consequently when the first batch of 400 trouble makers arrived on 8 August, they were not too pleased to learn that they had to sleep on the hard ground. The following morning they complained vociferously to the Governor, who had unwisely visited the detention compound. Through his intervention, however, sufficient blankets and beds were transported to the camp on 9 August. By the end of the month Ghajn Tuffieha Camp had 2,000 beds, which increased to 3,000 in September.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Maurice RAMC was placed in charge of the camp. Three camps were formed initially with a central headquarters. The Engineers provided kitchens, ablution rooms, and necessary sanitary conveniences. In July 1916, Major George Lane RAMC (SR) was appointed Commandant of the Military Convalescent Hospitals at Ghajn Tuffieha. In October 1914, Captain Lane was promoted Major and granted the temporary rank of Lieutenant Colonel while in command of the Camp Hospitals. In November 1918, he was placed on the retired list on account of ill health contracted on active service.\n\nColonel Lane expanded the camp to house 5,000 convalescents. This was built by the men themselves, and took nearly twelve months to complete. A number of self supporting camps were established each named after a saint: St Peter's, St Lawrence, St Barnabas, St James, and St Anthony. Each camp took a thousand convalescents and had its own quartermaster. A medical officer took charge of each camp. An assistant medical officer was placed in those camps with over a 1,000 convalescents. The medical officers administered the camps and ensured the men were fit to return to active service. Each camp was organised to be as self supporting as possible. The staff of the Convalescent Depôt included a Headquarters staff with offices for the commandant, adjutants, paymaster, camp quartermaster, sanitary officer and camp sergeant major with a chief clerk and his clerks drawn from the convalescents. The camp workers cooks, nursing orderlies, mess orderlies were all selected from the convalescents.\n\nEach camp had its own vegetable garden and a ten acre plot was set aside for the cultivation of potatoes. The camp also had a poultry yard to provide fresh eggs. A number of workshops were built by the convalescents under the supervision of a convalescing officer of the Royal Engineers. Printing and tailoring workshops were constructed. Items produced at the workshops were sold to the public and any money raised was added to the welfare fund. The men also organised theatrical groups and produced a Christmas Pantomime. The British Red Cross Commissioner provided a motor lorry to take the men to the near by recreation rooms erected by the Church Army.\n\nThe camp included a cot hospital consisting of three or four special huts with accommodation for 100 cases. The hospital had its own dispensary, kitchen, pantry, pack store and bathroom. The camp hospital admitted only minor sick. Those who had not improved within a couple of days were returned to the military hospitals. Four dental officers attached to the RAMC worked in the hospital. Ghajn Tuffieha Convalescent Camp closed in January 1919.\n\nMellieha Convalescent Camp\n\nIn November 1915, the infantry camp at Mellieha Bay was prepared by the Royal Engineers as a convalescent camp. On 19 January 1916, 100 hospital beds and 500 convalescent beds were ready and on 30 January the whole of the first camp was completed.\n\nPatients started to arrive on 31 January and shortly amounted to 1,050 patients.\n\nSt Michael's Mellieha Convalescent Camp closed in August 1917.\n\nVerdala Convalescent home\n\nIn December 1915, Verdala Palace in the grounds of the Boschetto Gardens was converted into a convalescent hospital for 30 officers. It was open from December 1915 to April 1916.\n\nSan Antonio Palace Convalescent home\n\nIn January 1916, San Antonio Palace became a rest home for 60 nurses from the military hospitals and from the Royal Naval Hospital Bighi. It provided the over worked nurses with a well deserved and much needed respite. The home closed on 19 March 1916.\n\nVilla Dragonara St Julians\n\nVilla Dragonara near St George's Bay was made available as as a convalescent home for 12 officers by Marchesa Scicluna, who also generously donated £100 a month for its upkeep during a period of 12 months. The home was used from May 1915 to August 1917 and was administered by the British Red Cross Society.\n\nHospital Staff Malta 1915 – 1919\n\nOn the outbreak of war, the average strength of the Malta garrison was 5,977 men. The peacetime establishment of the RAMC in Malta in 1914 was 23 officers including 2 quartermasters, 150 other ranks RAMC and 12 nursing sisters of the Queen Alexandra Imperial Military Nursing Service (QAIMNS).\n\nIn April 1915, there were only 9 medical officers, 14 nurses QAIMNS and 220 RAMC rank and file on the island. These were augmented with twenty-seven civilian doctors, 11 nurses, and 65 male nursing orderlies of the Malta St John Ambulance Brigade. It was fortuitous that on 28 April, the 2nd Unit of the Scottish Women's Hospital had stopped at Malta while on its way to Serbia. This had four lady doctors, eight matrons, 30 fully trained sisters and 20 V.A.D.s (Voluntary Aid Detachment). One of the woman doctors was Alice Hutchison. On 30 April, she was informed that her hospital was to remain in Malta to nurse the wounded, who were daily expected from Gallipoli. The staff were offered quarters at the Camerata Valletta. They were distributed between Royal Naval Hospital Bighi (16 nurses) and Valletta Military Hospital (15 nurses). The 2nd Scottish Women's Medical Unit was paid £250 1s 8d for its services. It left Malta for Serbia on 23 May 1915.\n\nMedical Officers in Malta 1914 – 1919\n\nThe war hospitals which mushroomed in Malta were staffed by a large number of British civilian medical practitioners who, prior to the introduction of conscription, volunteered their services to the military. Malta was not necessarily their first destination of choice. One volunteer who found himself in Malta penned his umbrage in the British Medical Journal of 5 April 1919.\n\nI volunteered for France in 1915 and was told by the authorities that my application was accepted.
