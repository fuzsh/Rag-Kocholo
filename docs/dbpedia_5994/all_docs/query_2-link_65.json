D. Kroemer\n\nSubmitted by: Arlene Goodwin agoodwin@ctlnet.com\n\nGARRETTS GROWTH FROM 1871 TO 1936\n\nThe history of the city of Garrett really begins in 1871, when the survey of the Baltimore and Ohio and Chicago railroad, known as the Chicago division, was made. Chief Engineer, J. L. Randolph, Charles Archaniel, T. G. Baylor, W. A. Pratt and Mr. Manning started the survey at a point which they called Chicago Junction, two miles south of Centerton, off the old Sandusky City, Mansfield and Newark railroad, which they had previously leased. The survey was made for a distance of 262 miles west from Chicago Junction, through Ohio, Indiana, and into Illinois to a place eight miles south of Chicago, where it intersected the Illinois Central railroad, the intersection was called Baltimore Junction and is now Brookdale.\n\nConsiderable difficulty was experienced in building the road of the Chicago division, because of the marshy character of the land in this vicinity. As this territory was heavily wooded, it was considered more practical to construct trestles over the swamps and ravines than to attempt to fill them by grading. The number of trestles built on this division was 396, and they would have made nine miles of continuous trestle if they had been connected. The largest trestles were west of Garrett and there were three of the nine miles mentioned east of here to Willard. The Big Marsh trestle, about four miles west of Bremen, was 3,832 feet long, and contained 319 pile trestles, four piles being driven for each trestle. In 1882 this trestle was filled with sand out of a pit on south side of the Walkerton coal chutes.\n\nThe highest trestle was four miles west of Defiance. It was thirty-five feet high and was known as Whites Mills. The trestle west of Garrett coal chutes was 1,142 feet long and was built over the Tamarack swamp. The swamp was so densely covered with brush and tamarack trees that the lake in the center of it was not visible from the railroad. The center of the lake was covered with peat eight feet thick, and had broken through in 1873 when the road was graded. When the pilings were driven the contractors claimed they drove some of the piles 620 feet, which claim led to court litigation. The surveyor claimed that he had sounded the lake and had found 82 feet to be the greatest depth. People thought at the time that the pilings had been driven at an angle into the lake. This trestle was filled in, in 1886 and 87, first with clay, which proved to be too heavy, and then with old timbers and cinders. The track was supported on a pontoon of old car sills, and bridge stringers. Every morning the track would be down as the pontoon settled, as much as two feet overnight. J. R. Skilling, who had charge of the work, testified to this in his 1912 reminiscences, and said that to his knowledge there was sixty feet of pontooning crushed down in this sink.\n\nHow Site was Chosen\n\nBy 1874 the construction was nearly finished and the Baltimore Land and Improvement Company sent a special agent out to locate a suitable division point. The company was composed of John King, William Keyser, J. K. Cowen, J. L. Randolph and W. C. Quincy, Washington Cowen, father of J. K., was made special agent. A total of 604 ½ acres was bought by the agent for the site of Garrett.\n\nThe division point was chosen to be four miles east of Albion at a place known as Easters Crossing. But because enthusiastic speculators raised the price of their lands so high, Mr. Cowen abandoned the location and quietly came from Auburn Junction to the present site of Garrett. He negotiated with the farmers and closed the contracts for their land before they were aware that he was buying all the land around for a purpose. He purchased a total of twelve farms. With one of the farmers he had considerable trouble. The farmers name was Christ Long and he was mentally unbalanced. He lived in a one story log cabin with a dirt floor, and he and his hogs lived and slept together there. During the preliminary surveys, Long always met the engineers at the boundary of his land with a pitchfork and forbade their trespassing, which led to considerable parleying before they could enter. One day, however, one of the chairman pointed the transit rod at Long and he took to his heels, thinking it was a gun. When Cowen tried to purchase his farm, Long demanded payment in gold. Even after he had been paid in gold, he refused to move out of his log hut because he claimed he had lost $500 of the $1,500 he had received. He finally was crowded out by the buildings. His wife, some years previously, had eloped with another man and had taken Longs ox team and wagon.\n\nCowen traced her through several states and two years later located her in Nebraska, and then had to pay her $15 to get her to sign the deed.\n\nThe fifty acres upon which Garrett was laid out cost, $17,000 and within six months a total of $90,000 worth of lots were sold from it.\n\nForm New Township\n\nEight of the twelve parcels of land purchased by Mr. Cowen were in Butler township and four lay in Richland township. The town was laid out by Beverly L. Randolph and was situated in two townships. In June, 1876, a new township was formed and named Keyser after William Keyser, the second vice president of the B & O. The original plat of Garrett was recorded at Auburn on April 9, 1875, and was named Garrett in honor of John W. Garrett, president of the B & O. Nathan Tracy bought the first lot in Garrett, and O. C. Clark bought the two immediately after and constructed the first house in Garrett at the southwest corner of Randolph and King streets, housing a dry goods store and the first postoffice, on the second floor, with A. W. Pratt as the first postmaster, Mr. Tarney erected a two story house on his lot, which was what is now the empty lot at the southeast corner of Cowen and Quincy streets, and he ran a boarding house there for years. Business houses followed rapidly, a good many of them being two story and the owners living above with their families. Most of them located centrally in what is now the business section. It was nearly two years after the town was established before there was a school here.\n\nIn 1876 the town was incorporated, and the first town trustees were elected, Charles Linkenhelt, Hiram Hogue and W. E. Pratt, the trustees, appointed J. R. Skilling marshal.\n\nGarrett continued as a town corporation until the spring of 1893. The first city officials were Charles W. Camp. Republican, mayor, William J. Martin, city clerk, B. Hunsel. Treasurer, and D. W. Dare, marshal. The councilmen were William Hathaway and David Seely, S. L. Fryer and E. P. Kenyon, William Hays and E. E. Clark. Mr. Camp held the office of mayor for three terms, serving nine years. E. B. Thumma succeeded him.\n\nThe other city officials under Mr. Camp were L. J. Gengler, attorney, and W. N. Hershberger, Dr. J. A. Clevenger, S. L. Fryer, O. M. Shrock and Emil Hill, councilman.\n\nMr. Thummas assistants were J. D. Brinkerhoff, attorney; William Watson, clerk; O. F. Clark, treasurer; William Schudel, marshal; D. O. North, engineer; G. C. Scott, superintendent of water and light; Timothy DeBrular, A. P. Moste, C. W. McLaughlin, R. Lantz, C. W. Camp, councilman.\n\nIn 1910 W. J. Frederick was elected mayor and after his death, his term was finished by Geo. M. Schulthess. Their councilmen were C. Lindoerfer, Leslie Stoner, Will Franks, M. J. Driscoll and Isaac Whirledge. E. M. McKennan was city attorney and W. A. Duerk was chief of police.\n\nDr. Clevenger Made Mayor\n\nDr. J. A. Clevenger followed Mr. Schulthess in 1914 and his council consisted of Mr. Whirledge, Mr. Lindoerfer, Mr. Farnks, Mr. Stoner and A. G. Houser. R. L. Hollopeter completed Mr. Housers term. Mr. Brinkerhoff again served as city attorney.\n\nMr. Schulthess served the next full term as mayor and Conrad Schomberg, C. L. Woodcox, J. E. Manion, C. E. Lewis and Mr. Stoner were elected to the council,\n\nMr. Lindoerfer finished Mr. Lewis term. E. B. Henslee served at this time as attorney.\n\nW. B. Hays served only one year of the term that started in 1926. J. B. Brinkerhoff took the office when Mr. Hays resigned to become postmaster. C. E. Lightner, H.M. Van Lear, A. H. Stearns , R. E. Sarber and Mr. Manion were elected to the council. C. B. Hamilton took Mr. Stearns place when he moved to Willard. F. A. Nash served as attorney and T. H. Caffrey was appointed chief of police, which position he held until a few months ago.\n\nIn 1930 J. S. Patterson was elected to the office of mayor and his council consisted of Delbert Hartle, J. M. Trimble, C. N. McCully, Add Quince and Mr. Manion Following Mr. McCullys death, A. R. Moore served, until he and Mr. Trimbel were transferred to Arkon, O., and Mr. Schulthess and J. F. Ansbro finished their terms. W.W. Sharpless had held the position of city attorney since he was appointed in 1830.\n\nSome of the names which have been connected with the office of treasurer are Barney Hunsel, J. J. Stoehr, D. R. Hershberger, T. C. Little, A. J. Little, and H. E. Wert. Mr. Wert was elected to the office in 1913 and has held it ever since. The offices of clerk and treasurer were consolidated two years ago and he has since maintained that office. Walter W. Mountz was the clerk before C. U. Bowers was elected in 1913. Mr. Bowers held the office until it was abolished in 1933.\n\nMarshals who served before Mr. Caffrey, some of them for short terms, were Albert Palmer, Walter E. Saxer, Gover C. Sapp, Harry Miller, Felix Vananda and Geo. H. Shisley, Clayton Bailey was appointed chief of police a few months ago.\n\nThe present councilmen are H. T. Lanigor, Chas. Ort, L. C. Swartout, Mr. Ansbro and Mr. Schulthess, Fred L. Feick was elected mayor in 1934. He has been an attorney in Garrett for years. He is very well know throughout the state and nation, having been state legislative representative to the B. of R. T., state representative from DeKalb county and conciliator of the U. S. department of labor during the World war. He is a hale fellow well met, genial and friendly. He is deeply engrossed in his duties as mayor and has the interest of the community at heart. He had been very valuable in his service as chairman of the highway committee of the Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe Board of Public Works is composed of May or Feick, Mr. Sharpless and Mr. Schulthess.\n\nGarrett Attractions\n\nGarrett today has a population of 4,428 and is a choice location. It is within 20 miles of Fort Wayne and is only 150 miles from Chicago, the metropolis of the middle west. The county seat is only five miles distant. The city is easy of access with the important federal and state road 27 running through it, being on the Baltimore & Ohio railroad, and at the junction of the interurban line. The shipping facilities are excellent. Garrett is surrounded by splendid farming country. It is an unusually active city, containing probably more social, fraternal and civic organizations than any other town of its size.\n\nThe sanitary conditions in Garrett are the best. The sewage system is modern and is maintained perfectly. The drinking water from deep wells is clear and pure. The city has about seven miles of paved streets and the eleven miles of gravel and dirt streets are kept well oiled and graded. The sidewalks reach to the farthest limits. All the streets and alleys are well lighted and the boulevard lighting system on the main thoroughfares is not excelled in any town in this part of the country.\n\nAs great a change has been noted with the passing of the years in the vehicular traffic and conditions of the roads about Garrett as in the state of Garretts throughfares. From the days when a trip into town in the old buggy or spring wagon on Saturday was the big event of the week and it was a days job to go \"up street\" to shop, now a trip fifty or a hundred miles away and back to Garrett hardly needs to interrupt the days work. There are few roads about Garrett which are not passable in the worst weather, and with important state and national roads and the county roads kept in excellent condition. Garrett is easily accessible from all points.\n\nThe business houses are attractive and improvements are constantly being made. The new buildings are substantial and modern. There is always a good deal of building going on throughout the city. Although there is a great demand for houses, the rents remain low and there is hardly a house available.\n\nThe community spirit has been maintained at a high pitch. There are frequent community celebrations such as the Christmas program. The annual county muck crops show is a Garrett project and has attracted huge crowds. The annual Halloween celebration is a great community event and provides an outlet for the natural spirit of the occasion.\n\nThe city maintains two lovely parks with shade trees, luxuriant shrubbery and beautiful flowers, one in the block opposite the hospital and the Catholic church, and the other opposite the high school building. Each adds a touch of beauty to its section of town. The city keeps the streets and alleys in excellent condition and cares for the shade trees along the streets.\n\nThe citys third and largest park is now under construction at the southern edge of the city, in the blocks between Cowen and Peters streets. The projects which it is hoped will be completed by spring of 1936 are swimming and wading pools and an ice skating rink. When the park is finished it will provide facilities for a variety of other outdoor sports. The government has just contributed $21,000 of the $25,000 necessary to complete the work.\n\nHas Fine Utility Plant\n\nThe water, light and steam heat plant is the citys biggest utility. It was started in 1896 by a private company, consisting of J. D. Paul, C. B. Jones and Daniel Widmer. Dr. J. A. Clevenger is now the only living original stockholder. The plant was erected at a cost of $50,000, and the city purchased it after a short time, some time thereafter investing $10,000 more in improvements.\n\nA fine addition was constructed in 1929 and all new equipment installed. The plant is up-to-date and very efficiently operated. A 250,000 gallon water tower was put into service in 1926 with a new gravity system which maintains a constant and equal pressure at all times throughout the entire distribution system, offering an unlimited supply of water in any emergency that might arise. That same year two high-speed horizontal electrically driven centrifugal pumps were installed in place of the steam power pumping. In 1932, the remains of the old plant were wrecked and removed to make way for an addition to the new plant which doubled its size. With a sinking fund established, the cost of the additions or replacements will not at any time exceed the net earning power of the utilities. The net operating revenues have exceeded the operation and construction costs so that it is possible that the tax levy of the civil city will be eliminated eventually. The rates have been reduced frequently to such an extent that they are not a burden to the consumer.\n\nL. I. Klinker, the superintendent, and his family came to Garrett from Chicago in 1925. Mr. Klinker has had long experience in this line, and he has managed the city plant with great success.

I cannot recall all the names but will name those I can remember. Walter Nunn, William Seely, James Dunkin, Delmar Hill, Chas. Myers, Ed Gelhausen and Chas. K. Lantz. The fire apparatus was a hand pumper and hose cart. The water was furnished by a pump in the engine room at the B & O. At that time the water system of Garrett consisted of four blocks of 4-inch main. It started from the engine room, extended south on Peters street to King, east on King to Randolph, and south on Randolph to Keyser street. There were four hydrants, one on the corner of King and Cowen streets, one on the corner of King and Randolph, one on the corner of Keyser and Randolph, and one on the corner of King and Peters streets.\n\nIn 1891 the city fire department was organized with twelve members, who were: John F. Mager, Peter Behler, Chas. Lantz, A. W. Beehler, D. C. Beehler, Will Beechler, Harry Caldwell, L.J. Gengler, Tim DeBrular, Paul Seigel, Jack Murphy and Chas. Helfersty.\n\nAlso in 1891 the town board, which consisted of John Mager, Louis Sapp, Sam Teeters and G. W. Baker, purchased lot 17 in block 17 for $300 for the purpose of erecting a hose house. W. J. Frederick erected the house on Aug. 26, twenty feet wide by ten feet high, for $380.\n\nIn June the following year the town board authorized the marshal to give the members of the Volunteer Fire Department and the B & O Fire Department their poll taxes, which amounted to $1 a year, the first compensation they had ever received.\n\nThe fire department used the building which had been provided them by the town board until 1913, when they changed their quarters to the new city hall, where they have remained since. The original hose carts were used until February of 1917, when the city purchased the America-LaFrance fire truck still in use.\n\nIn July, 1931, the city and three townships, Keyser, Butler and Richland, bought the Boyer fire truck to be manned by the city firemen.\n\nThe present city fire department is composed of Owen Elson, Chas. K. Lantz, C. F. Lumm, L.C. Beber, P.B. Smith, G. C. Baysinger, L. A. Bryanski, Ralph Greenwalt, Hal Stoner, Russell Rowe, J. W. McGuire, Walter Coffing, Dewey Henderickson, Nate Hoeffel and Victor Carper. Fine club rooms were furnished at the city hall and business meetings are held there monthly. Fire practice is held once a month, also. Social affairs are held in the club rooms occasionally.\n\nThe Garrett Firemen are members of the Indiana Firemens Association and of the Northeastern Indiana Industrial and Volunteer Firemens Association. P. B. Smith of the local firemen is the president, and former presidents from Garrett were Geo. Shondel and Geo. Hetenhouser. The annual meting will be held in Garrett next June 10 and 11.\n\nThe members of the firemen who have served as fire chief and the years of their leadership are as follows: P. F. Behler, 1901-02-08; John B. Mager, 1903-04-05-09; Chas. Helferty, 1906-07; Chas. Lantz, 1910-14-15-16; A. W. Beehler, 1911-12-13-17-18-19; Nate Hoeffel, 1919-20-21-22; Arthur Stearns, 1923-23-25-26; Leslie Stoner, 1927-28-29-30-31; Owen Elson, 1932-33-34-35-36.\n\nCharles K. Lantz is the only remaining member of the original Volunteer Fire Department who is still active in the organization.\n\nGARRETT POSTOFFICE\n\nGarretts postoffice has had a long and varied career. When the railroad first went through this section a mail office was established on the second floor of the frame building on the southwest corner of King and Randolph streets. Railroad mail was distributed through this branch to the officials in charge of building the road.\n\nThe first postoffice was established in 1875 in the building on the corner of Keyser and Cowen streets, north opposite the Garrett Herald office, with W. E. Pratt as the first postmaster. He was followed by Alexander Phillips, Mrs. Mary Thomas, H. M. Bicknell, E. B. Thumma, Charles Sullivan, Amanda Sullivan, Timothy DeBrular, H. M. VanLear, O. H. Betts, W. B. Hays and the present postmaster, A. G. Houser.\n\nThe postoffice has had many location in the 60 years of its existence. From its first site it was moved to the M. W. Johnston brick building on West King street, later to a frame building across the street; then a block further south; then to the room on West King street, where Griests barber shop is now, and finally to its present location in the Abell building on East King street.\n\nThe volume of the business of the Garrett postoffice has made a steady increase. The general receipts are substantial and the money orders have been extraordinarily heavy recently. There have been as many as 164 orders written in one day.\n\nThe employes of the postoffice have increased from two assistants and rural carrier in 1903 to the present force of eleven besides the postmaster. Walter Erickson is assistant postmaster and the clerks are Paul Grimm, Waldo Grimm and Carl Grimm, with Chester Starner and Harry Springer as substitutes. The city carriers are Dean Bechtol, Norval Withrow and Nelson Conkle and J. G. Lawhead is the rural carrier. Rural delivery was established in 1903. Mr. Bechtol and Mr. Conkle have served about twenty years and Paul Grimm and Waldo Grimm have been members of the force fourteen years. Mr. Lawhead had been rural carrier sixteen years.\n\nThe service in Garrett is the most efficient. The postoffice being situated on the Baltimore and Ohio and on the interurban, the star routes or mail delivery by truck, going through Garret afford rapid and direct delivery to any point. The star route from Fort Wayne to Montgomery, Mich., was established five or six years ago. And the star route from Garrett to Milford and return was installed just a few months ago. Air mail service has been reduced to 6 cents per ounce.\n\nMr. Houser was appointed postmaster in 1933. He is courteous and accommodating and is fulfilling his position to the utmost.\n\nWord was received not long ago that the site for the new postoffice had been selected. It was announced that the southeast corner of Keyser and Cowen streets, a total of 125x150 feet, would be used, the properties of Dr. M. E. Klingler, Mrs. Clemma Beehler and D. B. & D. E VanFleit being cleared to make way for the $62,000 structure. Tentative plans were said to be for one-story and basement with and exterior facing of brick and stone trim. Twenty-five men will be employed during the entire building on the major and minor contracts, and 125 men will be employed indirectly in the production of materials to be used in the construction of the building.\n\nThe selection of this site will greatly improve the appearance of that section of the city and will probably tend to encourage the normal spread of the business section in the general direction.\n\nGARRETT LIBRARY\n\nOne of Garretts most valuable assets is the public library, at the southwest corner of Houston and Randolph streets. The institution is comparatively new, having existed only since 1910.\n\nAt that time a group of people interested in the formation of a library met with the intention of raising by subscription enough money to buy books. It wasnt until two years later, however, that a library board was formed. It was composed of J. S. Patterson, Francis M. Merica, A. J. Little, Mrs. Mary Copenhaver, Mrs. H. W. Mountz and Mrs. B. A. Byers. Grace Zerkle was appointed librarian of the 1,400 books and the library was situated above the, what was then Betts news stand on West King street. A city tax was levied for maintenance.\n\nAs soon as possible advantage was taken of Andrew Carnegies general offer to build a library if the site was procured by the library supporters. This was done under the leadership of D. B. VanFleit. The building was erected and opened to the public in 1915. At that time if contained 1,700 books, and at the end of the year the supply of books had been increased to 2,342, with 1,346 registered borrowers, and the circulation for the year was 18,409.\n\nIn 1926 Miss Zerkle resigned as librarian and her place was taken by her sister, Mrs. Lena Martin, her assistant at present is Mrs. Ethelinda Stroh. The last report stated that there were 2,927 borrowers, the number of books was 9,927 and the circulation for the year 44,165. The number of reference books is 3,050 and of periodicals 59.\n\nThe main floor of the library contains the general reading room, the juvenile section and a reference section. The seating capacity is 48. There are accommodations for 20,000 books. The basement contains an assembly hall large enough for small public gatherings a magazine file room and an unpacking room. The Health Culture club and the Athene club donated money for buying furniture. In the last year a new table and eight chairs have been added to the main floor equipment.\n\nThe Keyser township schools serve as branch libraries. Because of the library being hard to reach, the pupils and adults in Keyser township have the opportunity of using books which are sent to their schools about five times a year. About 40 books are sent at one time and the lot is changed regularly so that there is frequently a new supply.\n\nThe library is a neat and well-kept property. There are continual improvements, recent ones being five new roller maps, a lovely oil painting of Andrew Carnegie which is a gift celebrating his centennial anniversary, and a picture collection which will be on file in the file room on the main floor. School children occasionally submit art work for display and the librarian makes it a practice to keep displays of different sorts in the library all the time. There are more than a dozen miniature villages and historical scenes which are on display seasonally. Annually during National Book Week the library uses a store window for a showing of new adult and juvenile books. One of the finest sections in the library is the International Alcove, the books of which are sent by the Carnegie Endowment for International. Peace. There are both childrens and adults books and they are kept on reserved shelves. A new Webster dictionary, a new Columbia encyclopedia and a new atlas have recently been purchased.\n\nThe library board now consists of: Mrs. H. W. Mounts, president; W. A. Clefford, vice president; Mrs. W. G. Symon, secretary; W. S. Painter, Mrs. Mary Copenhaver, A. G. Houser and A. W. Gallatin.\n\nThe grounds surrounding the library are one of the citys show places. In 1928 the prize given by the Chamber of Commerce for \"better yards\" was won by the library.\n\nCHURCHES:\n\nMETHODIST\n\nIn 1876, when Garrett was of course in its infancy, a Rev. Welsh of Auburn, came here and organized a group of twelve charter members to form the Methodist Episcopal church. These member were: Mrs. J. G. Philbrick, Mrs. Margaret Stoner, Mr. and Mrs. Michael Zimmer, Mr. and Mrs. Mason Tarney, Mr. and Mrs. George Clarkston, Mrs. Magdalene Beehler, Mrs. Mary Reyher, J. W. Stoner and \"Grandma\" Darling. They held their meetings in an old frame building between King and Quincy on Cowen street that had formerly been used as a saloon. In 1880 they constructed a brick church on Cowen street just south of the structure now in use. In 1911 construction was begun on the present church.\n\nSome time before that Rev. Perry Powell was minister and his word among the young men and boys of the community has never been forgotten. He organized the \"Holy Grail\", which had a large membership and a lasting influence in the church. The teachers of the Sunday school classes at the time of the removal to the new church were: Mrs. C. B. Jones, who held nearly every office in the church at various times and will long be remembered for her cheer and service. Mrs. Odd Clark, Mrs. Arthur Treesh, H. A. Hinklin, Mrs. George Childers, Mrs. Flo Reneman, Miss Ada Mountz, Mrs. J. G. Philbrick, Mrs. John H. Zeek, Mrs. Rebecca Hart, Dr. M. E. Klingler, Mrs. Fritz, Mrs. Hobart Wright, Mrs. H. W. Mountz, Mrs. J. L. Gehrum, Mrs. Frank Conkle, Mrs. Oda Englstrom, Mrs. Will Franks, Mrs. Margaret Stoner, Harry M. Brown and Rev. Charles Tinkham. Howard W. Mountz was superintendent of the Sunday school, J. D. Brinkerhoff was chorister, Archie Childers was secretary and Mrs. Maud Updyke was pianist.\n\nRev. Tinkham was here at the time the new church was built. The circles and classes of the church contributed money for the building. Rev. Tinkham remained in Garrett for nine years and his departure was greatly regretted.\n\nRev. B. H. Franklin came two years ago from Decatur. He is quite a sportsman and has made many friends in Garrett. He is a member of the Lions club and other civic organizations.\n\nThere are many societies in the church, including the Womans Home Missionary society with Mrs. H. F. Casteel as the president, the Womens Foreign Missionary society with Mrs. A. W. Gallatin as president, and their auxiliary to juniors the 3 Ms and Standard Bearers. There are the Ladies Aid, of which Mrs. David Wagner is president, and the Harmony, Elizabeth, Phoebe, East Side and Philathea Sunday school classes and Mary Martha Sunday school classes circles. The Sunday school classes which are particularly active are the Willing Workers, of which Mrs. Sherman Brubaker is president, the Mary Martha Class, of which Mrs. Geo. G. Gelhausen is president. The Philathea class, with Mrs. Grace Herberger as president, and the Wesley Brotherhood, of which E. N. Miser is president. Junior church contains the Epworth League, of which Eloise Conkle is president, and the Junior League, of which Mrs. Bert Milks has charge.\n\nM. A. Sheets is superintendent of the Sunday School and Mrs. Sheets is leader of the choir. Dr. W. G. Symon is organist and Marguerite Conkle and Mrs. Harry Hill are alternates. The Wesley Brotherhood sponsors Boy Scout troop 162, of which Gary Woodcox is the master. W. S. Painter is president of the executive committee consisting of the board of trustees, of which H. W. Mountz is chairman, and the stewards, of whom A. W. Gallatin is chairman. There are now 826 members of the church.\n\nPRESBYTERIAN\n\nA congregation of the Presbyterian faith first met in the German Methodist church on Cowen street in 1905 or 06, and finally were organized there with the Rev. Chas. G. Sterling as their minister. They rented the St. Matthews Reformed church for a period of a year and held their services there, and then for a time returned to the German Methodist church. Later they bought the Reformed church building and many of the remaining members of that church joined the Presbyterians. At that time the church was known as the Reformed Presbyterian church, but the name has since been reverted to its first form.\n\nIn the church there are several societies that are markedly active. There are two circles and two missionary societies. Mrs. Jordan is president of the adult society and Vera Silberg is leader of the younger group. The True Blue class had been very ambitious for the church and the Inner Circle has been deeply interested. Mrs. W. A. Clefford has been leader of the choir for more than 25 years. Mrs. B. H. Eastes is the charge of a missionary group of the children.\n\nRev. H. J. Jordan and his family came to Garrett 7 years ago from Benson, Ariz. Since he had been here the church has been redecorated and repaired. The True Blue class installed steam heat and also furnished radiator covers, the total cost being $1,100. They cleared that debt in about 3 years.\n\nRev. Jordan has taken interest in many affairs outside his church work. He is chaplain of the American Legion and has been important in the Boy Scout movement.\n\nLUTHERAN\n\nIt was somewhere between 1865 and 1870 when Rev. Reichmann, then located at Avilla, began mission work among the scattered Lutherans in and around what is now Garrett, conducting services in the private homes of Harry and Fred Bartels. He was followed by Rev. Steinback. Later Rev. C. B. Preuss came over from Avilla and he obtained permission to conduct services in the Keyser public school-house. Under this leadership at Lutheran congregation was organized on Dec 10, 1887, under the name of Zion Evangelical Lutheran congregation. A constitution was drawn up an signed by the following eleven charter members: Albert Peters, Ernest Wedo, Carl Stahl, Christ Wagner, Fritz Kobi, Fritz Grieschke, John Schunk, John Kobi, Henry Reusze, Chas. Weiss and Gottfried Weiss.\n\nTwo years later this young congregation built its own house of worship on the corner of Keyser and Walsh streets, on a lot which was donated by the city of Garrett. Following is a list of the pastors who have served here: Rev. F. Keller, Rev. Otto Schumm, Rev. H. B. Kohlmeier, Rev. C. Giese, Rev. K. Krotke, Rev. G. Bloedel, Rev. E. T. Lochner, and the present pastor, Rev. Wm. Hartman, who has been in Garrett since 1927. Rev Hartman attended Concordia Seminary at Springfield, Ill. There are now 165 communicants in the church. They comprise a total of 70 families.\n\nThe church has just been newly papered and varnished inside and a program was given to celebrate the completion of the work. The Ladies Aid of the church withstood the expense, which was more than $100.\n\nIn 1923 the old building was raised and a basement put under it. It was repainted and re-shingled and the interior redecorated. A new heating plant, new pews, altar and pulpit were installed at a total cost of $4,000. Roy Mayfield, Fred Stoll and Rudolph Wessel were the building committee at that time.\n\nThe Ladies Aid of the church and the Z. E. L. Young Peoples Society are both exceptionally active and their presidents are Mrs. John Dannenberg and Harold Dannenberg.\n\nThe Lutheran Ladies Aid is perhaps the oldest organization of its kind in Garrett. Those of the charter members who are still living are Mrs. Henry Bartels, Mrs. Rosie Schunk, Mrs. August Diederich, Sr., and Mrs. Herman Newman.\n\nPAROCHIAL SCHOOL\n\nThe church school was established shortly after the church was. There are at present 20 pupils. Edmund Janetzke, a graduate of River Forest Seminary, is the teacher. In 1923 the school house, which stands back of the church, was raised, a basement put under it, and hot air heating and new furniture and modern equipment installed at an extra cost of $2,200.\n\nCHURCH OF CHRIST\n\nThe Church of Christ, which has grown to be one of the largest churches in Garrett, had humble beginnings. A small congregation started to meet for Sunday school and occasional sermons by out-of-town ministers shortly after 1900. The Episcopal parish house on West Houston street was used as a church. These meetings were discontinues for a time and in 1905 the congregation was reorganized with less than 50 members.\n\nHunsels hall was used of a while and then the German Methodist church on South Cowen street was the meeting place. Finally the Gage dance hall on the site of the present church was purchased and used until the new church was erected there in 1917. J. Marion Small was pastor at the time the new church was built and the edifice cost about $25,000.\n\nThe present pastor is the Rev. Price Roberts. He and his family came to Garrett from near Elwood. He has been minister here for four years and in that time had held two evangelistic meetings. The membership has now reached a total of nearly 600. Since the Rev. Roberts had been here the indebtedness of the church has been reduced from $1,600 to $500. Recoping and repairing the roof recently cost $200, bringing the total debt of the church to $700.\n\nThe ladies of the church have several active circles. They are the Loyal Womens class with Mrs. Kenneth Busz as president, Circle No.3 with Mrs. D. E. Nethercot, as president, the Loyal Aid with Mrs. J. D. Grimm as president, and the Bethany class with Mrs. B. O. LaRue as president. Mrs. Roberts leads the Junior Christian Endeavor Society and Ruth Wisenbaugh is president of the Senior organization of the same name. John Kettering is president of the Loyal Mens class.\n\nTHE NAZARENES\n\nThe Nazarene church is one of the newer organizations locally. It was formed less than three years ago, in 1933, after having met for six weeks in the rooms above the Kroger store. There were 24 charter members. The meetings then were held in the frame building on the southeast corner of Cowen and Keyser streets. The congregation recently purchased the Oliver Pipes property at the corner of Randolph street and First avenue. The Rev. O. B. Gray and family occupy the house there and plans have been made for the erection in a near future of a church on the vacant lot.\n\nThe Rev. Gray and his family came to Garrett in August, 1935, from Parker, Ind. They have been highly successful in their work and the prospects for the Nazarene church are excellent. The pastors son William Gray, and his wife are both interested in the young peoples work. William Gray is a vocal teacher and Mrs. Gray is a teacher of music. They have organized an undenominational chorus club, which meets weekly in the rooms over the Kroger store.\n\nBAPTIST\n\nA group of seven women convened in the German Methodist church, which stood near the corner recently designated for the new postoffice, and organized the Baptist church in 1885. They were Mrs. C. N. Bell, Mrs. G. W. Mudd, Mrs. Frank Hartsox, Mrs. Thomas Stewart, Mrs. Sarah Cobler, Mrs. Lydia Osborne and Miss Addie Ford. Elder H. J. Finch of Auburn, was present and came to Garrett later as the first pastor. Rachel Traster and Sabina Bretz were baptized at the first meeting.\n\nIn a short time Hunsels hall was rented by the church for $2 a month. The Rev. J. M. Davies, the father of Mrs. Lotta Stewart of South Cowen street, was the first resident pastor. The Rev. C. G. Roadarmel, a brother-in-law of Mrs. Grace Eagan and Mrs. Geraldine Denison, was at one time the minister here. The Rev. Billy Pierce was also and outstanding pastor.\n\nThe Rev. and Mrs. Sam Hartsox were sent as missionaries from this church to Africa a good many years ago. Miss Goldie Nicholson is now serving as missionary to Japan.\n\nThe church, which stands at the corner of Cowen and Keyser streets, was erected in 1888 at a cost of $8,000. The following year a revival increased the membership considerably. In 1903 the edifice was remodeled at an additional cost of $3,000 and a $1,500 pipe organ was given to the church by A. J. Stewart in memory of his daughter, Effie.\n\nThe Baptist Young Peoples Union, headed by Paul Brown, and the junior B. Y. P. U. are very active in the church. There are a Ladies Aid with Mrs. John Elllington as president and a missionary circle with Mrs. Lotta Stewart as president. The Childrens World Crusade is a missionary organization under the charge of Miss Fairie Cole. Four adult classes of the church meet monthly for business meetings and a unionized service. John Ellington is president of the mens class.\n\nThe membership of the Baptist church has increased steadily and is now of a substantial size. Claude Hoover of Fort Wayne, is superintendent of the Sunday school, John Roos is senior deacon, Mrs. Stewart is the clerk, and Miss Thais Cobler is organist and choir director.\n\nCATHOLIC COMMUNITY\n\nThe size of the Catholic community and the completeness of its equipment here are primarily due to the efforts of Rev. August Young, the towns first priest. Father Young was born in France in 1842 and came to America nineteen years later. He was educated in Pennsylvania and came to Huntington, Ind., for his first work as a priest. He was given all the territory around Garrett for his work and conducted services for the first time where Garrett now stands in 1872. After the town was built he held meetings in a tent and in a year or so constructed a small church next to where the Catholic school building is. In 1886 he was assigned to the Garrett charge alone and at once erected his home, which is now E. M. Alleys house. Two years later he built a two-story brick schoolhouse between his residence and the church. In 1893 it was necessary to enlarge the church. Four years later Father Young purchased eight acres of land and laid out Calvary cemetery, which is in the south-west part of town.\n\nFather Young died twelve years ago, and his passing was mourned by everybody in Garrett, Catholic and Protestant alike, and by many friends elsewhere.\n\nBuilding a New Church\n\nFather Young after his retirement was succeeded in the pastorate by the Rev. Francis A. King, who labored for his eight years here to procure funds for the erection of a new church. He purchased the rest of the land at the southeast corner of Houston and Ijams streets, just opposite the hospital for the site of the proposed church.\n\nFather King died in 1927, beloved of all who knew him, and in that same year the Rev. John G. Bennett came to this parish.\n\nFather Bennett was born at Dunnington, Ind., and obtained his education at St. Josephs College, Collegeville, Ind., and St. Meinrads Seminary, Spencer county, Ind. He was for thirteen years assistant rector of St. Patricks church, Fort Wayne. Immediately after coming to Garrett he began the actual plans for the new rectory and church that both Father Young and Father King had so desired. The rectory was completed in a year, and dedication services were held for the church on Thanksgiving day, 1929. The church will seat 450 persons, and it cost approximately $80,000. The two structures add immeasurably to the beauty of the city.\n\nThey are in Italian Renaissance style, built of buff brick and terracotta. The priests sacristy to the right of the altar is connected with the rectory by a beautiful cloister. The basement of the church contains well appointed kitchen and pantries and a large recreation room which serves as a dinning room and for social affairs.\n\nFather Bennett has done a great deal of good for his people and or the community. He has taken a great interest in civic affairs. He is a member of the Lions club, has served as president of the Chamber of Commerce, of which he is still an active member, and is secretary of the LaVoie Corp., which was started in Garrett, but is now located in Auburn.\n\nOrganizations in the church include the Holy Name society for men, with Frank Seifert as president, the Rosary society for the married ladies, with Mrs. Herman Richter as president, and the Blessed Virgin Sodality for the young ladies, with Ursula Vanderbosch as president. All are spiritual organizations. The East Side and the West Side circles are active socially. The Knights of Columbus and the Daughters of Isabella are Catholic orders. There is a club among the children in the parochial school called the Busy Bees.\n\nHospital Well Equipped\n\nFather Youngs greatest work was the establishment of the Sacred Heart hospital. He purchased the property of W. G. Satterfield at the corner of Ijams and Houston, and immediately converted the residence there into a temporary hospital, continuing the plans for the new structure, which was dedicated in 1903. In 1918 considerable remodeling was done, and a large new wing was added. The total investment is now about $200,000. Father Young next doubled the capacity of the parochial school by building an addition.\n\nThe hospital has quarters for forty-five patients, with twenty private rooms that contain two beds each. The large operating room is completely equipped for surgical work. Several years ago the Tri Kappa sorority furnished the equipment for a modern nursery containing facilities for taking care of six babes, and some time later a complete delivery room was added. The sorority maintains these rooms.\n\nThe operating room contains a Scanlan Morris white-lined dressing sterilizer, steam heated, and a fine X-ray machine is located in a room nearby. Adjoining the operating room are the doctors quarters, including a counsel room, a lounge, showers and a solarium. The Psi Iota Xi sorority recently presented the hospital with an Oxygenaire, and oxygen tent for use in pneumonia and other similar cases.\n\nThere is a beautiful chapel in the hospital, and services are conducted by the chaplain, the Rev. George Hasser, who resides in the hospital.\n\nThe Sacred Heart hospital is the property of the Franciscan Sisters, a Catholic order whose mother house is at Joliet, Ill. The hospital is usually filled to capacity, and attracts patients from many points. It does not maintain resident physicians, but is open to all doctors, every facility being at their disposal, and the Sisters assisting in every way possible\n\nIn the annual report of last year it can be noted that of 462 cased admitted, 91 were part pay or charity. There were 1,002 meals served free to the poor, and the cost of free services rendered during the year was $1,545.36.\n\nThe number of the Sisters employed in the hospital, and in maintaining the Sister home is 17 and as teachers in the school is 6.\n\nThe Catholic school has at present 170 pupils in the grade and high school in Garrett. There are the full eight grades of grammar school and four years of regular high school training. The purpose of the church schools is to give religious training along with the school work. The burden of the church schools over the country falls only on the Catholic population, and it is estimated that about $200,000,000 is saved the taxpayers annually by these schools.\n\nGARRETT PUBLIC SCHOOL\n\nAs soon as there were settlers here a movement was started for a school building in Garrett, and in 1876 the first school board was appointed. Dr. S. M. Sherman, Dr. A. S. Parker and N. W. Lancaster were the trustees appointed and they immediately prepared for the construction of a school house. Before building could be begun, the trees had to be cleared from the heavy wood, and a $6,000 structure was raised. That building still stands and is in use today as the Central grade school.\n\nBut before the school could be built a group of children started to study in an empty room on Cowen street, on the corner north of the Baptist church, which had been the Garrett News printing office owned by A. S. Parker. Butler township had purchased new seats and desks for its building and gave the old ones to the new school and Mrs. A. S. Parker was the teacher.\n\nIn January of 1877, however, the students were able to move into the new building.\n\nIn the meantime Father August Young had completed a new Catholic church and opened a select school there. Miss Josephine Bissett, whose father was foreman of the roundhouse here, was the teacher, and the school was maintained until the public school was opened.\n\nA review of the early teachers in Garrett will be interesting:\n\n1877Miss Jackman, principal; Miss Collar, intermediate; Miss Widney, primary; 120 pupils.\n\n1878Wm. Baker, principal; Cora Everett, intermediate; Myra K. Zeigler, primary; 123 pupils.\n\n1879J. C. Otis, principal; Nettie Rowe, intermediate; Miss Zeigler, primary; 135 pupils; Miss Powers of Auburn, completed the principals term that year.\n\n1880Frank W. Rawles, principal; Emma Mills, grammar; Lottie Chilson, intermediate; Maggie Dolan, primary; 214 pupils.\n\n1881C. M. Merica, principal; Thomas S. Merica, grammar; Miss Mills, intermediate; Miss Dolan, primary; 238 pupils.\n\nThere was a steady increase in the enrollment and the teachers didnt change so quickly from that year on. Garrett prided itself on having the finest school system in the county.\n\nThe first class was graduated from the Garrett schools in 1885 and there were but four members: Charles Sembower, William Ward, Lulu Milborne and Maud Tarney.\n\nAbout that time the school house was completed at an added cost of $3,500 to accommodate the larger number of students. In 1900 the North Side building was built at a cost of $5,000, and in 1906 the high school building was constructed on the lots east of Central building. It cost $20,000, and was by far the finest school house in this part of the state. At that time F. M. Merica was superintendent. The Mericas had much to do with the progress of the school system here. F. M. Merica had served as principal before he was made superintendent, and his uncle, C. M. Merica, and a brother, Thomas Merica, had held the position before. They were a prosperous family whose parents, Mr. and Mrs. Wm. Merica, lived on a farm south of the city, and the Mericas were always prominent in Garretts affairs.\n\nHigh School Grounds Attractive\n\nWhen the new building was completed there were 740 pupils in the public schools in Garrett. Elmer Harrel was principal, Mrs. Flora Thomson Jones was assistant principal and the teachers were: Will Franks, Harry M. Brown, Marie Spencer, Vera VanAuken, Dola Broughton, Georgia VanFleit, Mattie Dick, Geraldine Sembower, Ada Chew, Ethel Maloney, Nellie Carey and Eva Satterfield. Dr. J. F. Thomson, C. U. Bowers and S. B. McCullough served at that time on the school board. Some of the names which had been prominently identified with the board in previous years are: J. William Wagner, C. Reyher, H. F. Sembower, W. J. Frederick and Warren McNabb.\n\nAbout 16 years ago conditions became so crowded in the schools that the board contemplated additions to the central buildings, but the age of the grade school building made those impractical, and finally land was purchased at the east end of Houston street, plans being formed for the erection there of a high school. What had been the high school building was converted into the junior high school. The new building cost $78,000. The grounds about the high school have become one of the show spots of Garrett, with a profusion of shrubbery and lovely trees. The building faces the new city park between Houston and Keyser streets and this park is growing prettier every year.\n\nThe high school building has been used for twelve years now, and a good sized addition to it will be started soon. It will contain the shops and sewing rooms now located in the junior high building, a lunch room, enough class rooms to house the junior high school student, steel lockers, and other necessities. At present there are a well-equipped kitchen, laboratories, commercial rooms, vocational rooms, offices and a library. Lockers and showers are provided for track and football boys, but these are not sufficient to care for visiting teams. The heating and ventilating system is modern.\n\nThe library has grown under the direction of Mrs. Helen Ellis to be an integral part of the school. There were few books in 1926, when Mrs. Ellis took it over, and there are now approximately 2,000 volumes. What was formerly the principals office has been transformed into a library and reading room, but considering the size of the school, this does not reach the standard size by one-fourth. The books carried are to a large extent reference volumes, and the school library carries only a small line of fiction, not intending to offer competition of the public library. However, the institution is one of great value to the students.\n\nThe appearance of the school land back of the building has been greatly improved in the last ten years by the draining of the swamps. Two tennis courts, two football fields, a baseball field and a cinder track have been laid out on what was formerly waste ground. The rest of the land is now lawn and trees have been planted. The school board has been improving that part of the property and the athletic association a few years ago constructed a fine fence around the track and fields.\n\nActivity in Athletics\n\nAthletics have been a part of the schools activities for a great many years. Garrett is recognized a shaving one of the best athletic set-ups in northern Indiana, and it has been constructed since the building of the high school. First came the football field, with the other improvements being made gradually from time to time.\n\nGarrett has teams participating with other schools in football, basketball, track, and in former years there have been baseball and tennis teams. Until a few years ago Garrett high school had girls basketball teams and they were recognized as state champions a number of times.\n\nC. E. Bryan has been coach of the high school boys athletic teams since 1928 and Paul Bateman has been his assistant for several years, besides teaching agriculture. Coach Bryan teaches boys physical education classes. Sectional basketball tournaments have been held here for a number of years since the construction of the new gymnasium in 1927 and Garrett has been the winner of the sectionals three times. Garretts athletic teams and activities, especially the sectional tournaments, have brought much attention and credit to the city.\n\nThe high school students indulge in many extra curricular activities. The clubs represent the varied interest of the student: boys and girls glee clubs, dramatic club, Bible club, radio club, English club, athletic club, discussion club, etc. The Future Farmers club is affiliated with state and national organizations of the same name. Hi-Y club for boys and Girls Reserve and its freshman associate the Blue Triangle, clubs for girls have been active here for many years and all serve a worthy purpose. The high school band was started about six years ago and was fostered by the Business and Professional Womens club, which raised money with the aid of other organizations for the purchase of the larger instruments. Fred Casner, a recent graduate of the school, this year took over the leadership of the band. The bank masters have received their compensation from private lessons to the members of the band. The school orchestra has existed for several years and is now under the direction of Gilbert Cobler. The members furnish their own instruments and pay for their own lessons, and they willingly play for high school functions an are often invited to entertain for community affairs.\n\nDivided into Home Rooms\n\nThe Home Room programs are an innovation in the school. The total number of students is divided equally into ten home rooms. For a weekly study of active interest and worthwhile knowledge which is not received in high school textbooks. Intramural athletic activities are confined to the boys and the girls not indulging in basketball and other game except for their own entertainment in their health classes. Boys, however, have football, basketball, baseball, tennis and track. The high school contains and athletic association, which is affiliated with the state organization composed of the principals and coaches, with its purpose the control of training and eligibility rules.\n\nThe list of high school teachers follows: E. V. Minniear, principal and social science; Marie Thrush, dean of girls and English; Mildred Evard, English; Mrs. Helen Ellis, Latin and Librarian; Myra Montgomery, commercial; Marguerite McKinley, vocational home economics; Mrs. Nina Fitch, social science; O. B. Rose, mathematics; Paul Wilkinson, mathematics and physics; Paul J. Bateman, vocational agriculture; Russell Sherman, chemistry and English; C. E. Bryan, boys coach and physical education; W. G. Woodcox, industrial arts; Helen Jennings girls coach and physical training; Gilbert Coble music and art.\n\nAfter the new high school was constructed the building used as the high school prior to that time was occupied by the junior high pupils and the fifth and sixth grades, while only grades one to four used the Central building. This arrangement continued until the beginning of the second semester of this school term on Jan. 20, 1936, when the whole arrangement was changed.\n\nThe unfitness of the Central building for further use necessitated the change. An addition to the high school will soon be started, the dimensions to be 85 feet 6 inches north and south and 227 feet east and west. The addition is necessary to take care of the 170 seventh and eighth grade pupils who were moved to the high school building at the start of the second semester. There is a little difficulty now in handling the additional students together with the 354 who were already there. Temporary class rooms were established, some classes combined and some periods eliminated to make way for the extra students until the addition is completed. Garrett will then have six year high school.\n\nAlong with the removal of the junior high school students to the high school, the pupils in the Central building were moved to the junior high building, grades one, two and three occupying the lower floor and grades four, five and six occupying the up-stairs floor.\n\nWith the shifting of pupils came another important change, the depart-mentalization of grades four, five and six. Classes in these grades are now conducted in the same manner as those in the high school, with the pupils going to different class rooms for instruction in different subjects from different teachers.\n\nThe junior high school building has the sewing and manual training rooms, and the school book store and a small library. Will Franks has been principal of the junior high school for many years but relinquished this position to go to the high school to finish his last year of teaching with the seventh and eighth grades. Other junior high teachers transferred to the high school by the change are: A. F. Morris, Miss Ella Trimble, Miss Ruth Harsh, W. G. Woodcox and Helen Jennings.\n\nTeachers of grades four, five and six are: Jesse Ober, acting principal, Miss Lois Cobler, Miss Velma Hall and Harry Rahmer.\n\nTeachers of the first three grades are: Vera Silberg and Lilah Gilbert, grade 1, Mrs. Martha Bardsley and Miss Gilbert, grade 2; Hazel Harvey, grade3; Mary Dean and Harry Rahmer, grade 4.\n\nThe North Ward building houses the first six grades and the teachers are: Archie Fretz, principal and grades 5 and 6; Olive Deihl, grades 1 and 2; Alice Hall, grades 3 and 4.\n\nThe fine looking gymnasium at the corner of Lee and Keyser streets was built in 1927 at a cost of $35,000. There is a large stage for the production of school plays and community affairs and a new loud speaker system was installed last year. Due to a lack of funds, the gym does not have the proper equipment for physical training classes, but it is hoped that it will be supplied soon.\n\nThe school board consists of Dr. J. W. Thomson, president, Dr. J. A. Clevenger, secretary, and D. B. VanFleit, treasurer.\n\nIs Credited Highly\n\nW. S. Painter came as superintendent to Garrett from North Vernon, Ind., in 1924. He is an upstanding person and has made a great improvement in the schools record and discipline, tardiness and absences. Under the state board of education Garrett is judged in the first class commission and the high school comes up to the standard of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools.\n\nMen who have been members of the school board since 1907 include: C. H. Heinzerling, D. B. VanFleit, J. P. Gephart, H. M. Brown, Dr. J. W. Thomson, Dr. J. A. Clevenger, C. J. Rollins and Harry Brinkman. Mr. Heinzerling, Mr. Gephart and Mr. Rollins were on the board at the time of the building of the new high school. Some of the teachers are pioneers of the Garrett schools. Will Franks has the longest record of teaching, having taught here for fifty years. He started teaching in the township schools in DeKalb and Noble counties in 1878 and in 1886 came to Garrett. He claims he graduated in 1492 and truthfully says that he has attended every senior banquet given in Garrett for 100 years. He is beloved of his hundreds of former pupils and can count among then some three generations. He is the \"grand old man\" of the schools.\n\nAda Chew was known for many years for her knack at getting the children \"Started right.\" She had the record when she retired in 1934 of having taught for fifty-two consecutive years, forty-one of them in Garrett schools. She was at one time principal of the Central building. She said when she retired because of ill health that she had hoped to die \" in the harness,\" but she deserved a rest from those long strenuous years.\n\n\"Mattie\" Dick Bradsleys record is not far short of these. She is in her fortieth year of teaching her and taught in the county schools for five years before that. She can be proud of an unblemished record of patience and service.\n\nA good many of our teachers are veteran, ten and fifteen years records being in order. Marie Thrush leads these by being in the twenty-first year here. She is also dean of girls and has an active part in the students extracurricular activities.\n\nR. M. Merica was followed in the superintendency by M. D. Renkenberger, M. C. Huffman, Ray Pellet and George C. Carroll, the latter a Garrett product, now holds the position of superintendent of schools in Terre Haute. He was superintendent here when the new high school was built in 1922.\n\nAmong the early superintendents was Chas. Dugan, later president of a bank at Decatur.\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nGREATER GARRETT IMPROVEMENT CO.\n\nWhen the Baltimore & Ohio removed its shops from Garret in 1925, local business interest under the leadership of Chas. Abell formed what was designated as an Industrial Committee composed of Mr. Abell, chairman, H. M. Brown, D. B. VanFleit, J. D. Brinkerhoff and C. H. Heinzerling. They were entrusted with a fund of $6,390 subscribed for use in the promotion of industries. An industrial secretary was employed and he made a contact with Louis J. Keller of Chicago, a brassier manufacturer.\n\nMr. Keller became interested in establishing a factory here and it was necessary to furnish him with a building. The Garrett Industrial Association was then formed, with Geo. M. Schulthess as president, W. T. Eagan vice president, Geo. H. Tuck secretary, Herman Stern treasurer, and with these officers H. M. Brown, Monte L. Green, Chas. Abell, D. B. VanFleit, O.C. Clark and C. B. Hamilton comprising the board of directors.\n\nStock was sold and the total amount collected was $23,329, including $10,000 subscribed by the Baltimore & Ohio. A fine brick building with 10,000 feet of floor space was erected on East King street at an original cost of $18,866. It was occupied by the Francine Brassiere Co., headed by Mr. Keller. As the business developed Mr. Keller needed more room and he and the industrial association collaborated in the erection of an addition of 5,000 feet capacity, costing $8,000. The company occupied the premises until July, 1834, and had a force at one time of 150 people.\n\nThe building was vacant for a time and was then occupied for several months by the Lavoie Corporation, which was engaged in building a new type of passenger bus. In the summer of 1935 the industrial association, with the co-operation of the Chamber of Commerce and the industrial committee, interested David Rothstein of Chicago, in establishing a garment factory here. He started operations with a few employees and now has about eighty-five people on the payroll, with the prospects of more being added in the near future, The plant is operated under the name of Natures Rival Co.\n\nThe Industrial Association several years ago promoted to help finance a foundry that is located on East Quincy street and is operated under the name of Garrett Brass and Aluminum Foundry Co. Through the efforts of the association, the Ira J. Mix Dairy Co. of Chicago, established a milk plant just east of Randolph street and north of the B & O station, This business is now being operated by the Fort Wayne Milk Producers Corporation and buys milk from farmers in the vicinity, in an amount of about 95,000 pounds a day. The company is a branch of the VanCamp Milk Co.\n\nThe Baltimore & Ohio has been represented on the board of the industrial association by its local chief executive. The other directors at this time are Geo. M. Schulthess, W. T. Eagan, D. B. VanFleit, Herman Stern, C. H. Heinzerling, J. D. Brinkerhoff, O. C. Clark, H. M. Brown and C. B. Hamilton, with Mr. Schulthess president, Mr. Eagan vice president, Mr. VanFleit secretary and Mr. Stern treasurer. Mr. Eagan took the place of the late Mr. Abell on the Industrial Committee. The latter organization aided Rosenberry Bros. in starting a wood working plant they are operating on East Quincy street. The laundry on West King street is another institution that has been established in recent years through the co-operation of the commercial organization.\n\nHIENZERLINGS HARDWARE\n\nThe store known as \"Heinzerlings, the Pioneer Hardware,\" dates back to Garretts beginning. John L. Davis, an Auburn merchant, constructed a frame building on the southwest corner of Randolph at Keyser street in 1875 and opened the first hardware store in the settlement. In 1894 F. H. Mountz bought the business, which had been moved to a building on the present site of the Hershberger building, just south of the Garrett State Bank. Mr. Mountz transferred his stock to its present location at 120 North Randolph street, in the building newly erected there by Emil Hill.\n\nCarl H. Heinzerling came to Garrett as a boy with his parents from Sandusky, O., in 1892. In his early teens he worked for John Lumm, father of Charles F. Lumm, in his tin shop. Then, he was employed in Clark & Teeters hardware, which was situated where the I. O. O. F. building is now. E. E. Clark sold his share of the business to S. S. Teeters and some time later A. J. Little entered the firm. Their business house was destroyed by fire July 1, 1900, and the partners constructed the building on West King street now occupied by Littles hardware. Following the fire, Mr. Heinzerling continued there as a clerk until Sept. 1 of the same year. Then he entered the employ of Mr. Mountz, and on Sept. 14, 1904, he and John B. Coffinberry purchased the business. When Mr. Coffinberry died in 1912, Mr. Heinzerling became the sole owner. Since 1930 his son, Harry D. Heinzerling, has been associated in the business with him.\n\nThe main room of the hardware store is 25x125 feet in size, and several years ago a wing 25x65 feet was added to the back of the building, making it one of the largest hardware stores in the county. Mr. Heinzerling has a large stock of 25,000 items, featuring reliable and nationally known products. Well known merchandise includes General Electric refrigerators, ranges and household electrical appliances, Hoover vacuum sweepers, Sherwin-Williams paints and varnishes, American wire fencing, Maytag and Speed Queen electric and gasoline-powered washing machines, Keen Kutter tools, Aladdin lamps, Armstrong linoleums, and Glow Boy heaters. They carry high grade cutlery, Mirro aluminum kitchen utensils and Spaulding sporting goods, Winchester, Savage and Remington firearms, a full line of ammunition, and fishing tackle. They also specialized in farm and vegetable seeds.\n\nMr. Heinzerling has been a leading merchant for over 30 years, and has certainly been one of Garretts most constructive citizens. He has been very active in community and other affairs. He is considerable of a sportsman, being a member, and at present vice-chief of the Okoboji Indians, a national organization of trap-shooters, and a member of the Isaak Walton League, for the conservation of our game and fish and their habitat. He was for some years a member of the school board, and has been active in the Chamber of Commerce, the Lions club, the Country club, and is a member of the board of directors of the Masonic Temple Association. He is one of the three founders of the Creek Chub Bait Co., and also serves as a director of the Garrett State Bank.\n\nMETZNERS LAUNDRY\n\nBusiness has shown a very steady and healthy increase at Metzners Laundry since Harry E. Metzner of Fort Wayne, became owner and manager on Nov. 1, 1934. He purchased the laundry from Mr. and Mrs. Ernest Glenn and at that time the name was changed from the Garrett Modern Laundry to the present name.\n\nSixteen persons are employed at the plant on West King street. Miss Ilene Young of Fort Wayne, is forelady, Fred Jensen of South Lee street is superintendent and Mrs. Marion Dreibelbis is in charge of the office. Mr. Metzner manages the operations and divides his time between the plant and the Fort Wayne office of the laundry at 3508 South Calhoun street.\n\nTwo trucks are owned and used by the laundry to cover the routes. The territory serviced includes south to Fort Wayne, west to Wawasee, north to Kendallville and Angola and Pokagon state park, and east to Butler. Practically all the towns within that radius are reached. Virgil Swalley of South Cowen street and Victor Somers of Fort Wayne, are the drivers. The latter handling the Fort Wayne route and Mr. Swalley taking care of the Garrett and other routes.\n\nWith thirty-five years of experience in the laundry business before coming here, Mr. Metzner is well qualified to give his customers the best and most efficient service possible. The plant is equipped with the latest modern equipment and can and does operate on practically the same basis as a large city establishment. One of the new departments instituted since Mr. Metzner took over the laundry is the lace curtain department which cares for the laundering of window furnishings in the most modern way and the service is equal to that found anywhere.\n\nThe laundry enjoys a large business from the lakes north and west of here during the summer and is anticipating an unusually good 1936 season. Contracts for the laundry work for three large CCC camps in this section of the state were entered into at the start of this year.\n\nMr. Metzner wishes to comment on and thank the people of Garrett and vicinity for the fine spirit of co-operation shown to him and the laundry since he has been owner. Likewise, the people of Garrett and out of town patrons are appreciative of the excellent laundry service, which Mr. Metzner had made available to them.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Metzner live in Fort Wayne at 815 West Wildwood. They have a son and daughter, both married.\n\nJUANITAS BEAUTY SHOP\n\nJuanita Eldridge Willson was trained for her beauty culture work by Opal Gordon Harvey at Auburn. She started her work as a beautician above the Gingerys department store, and moved into the shop she now occupies in 1929. She had graduated for Garrett high school, and therefore was fairly well acquainted in town. And by dint of long hours, a courteous manner, and excellent work, she has acquired an enviable business. She has the best of equipment and an attractive shop. She gives permanent waves, marcel waves, shampoos and finger waves, manicures, facials and eyebrow arching. She is the agent for Contours and Marrow beauty preparations.\n\nMrs. Willson is an active member of the Sigma Phi Gamma sorority and has made many friends outside her business in Garrett. She is a member of and has attended conventions of the National Hairdressers Association and other societies.\n\nHEINLENS DEPT. STORE\n\nJerome P. Heinlen had made a great success as a young merchant in Garrett. He is owner of the department store on North Randolph street known as Heinlens Dept. Store. Mr. Heinlen came to Garrett with his parents, the G. F. Heinlens, from Waukesha, Wis., when he was two years old. When he was only sixteen he entered the employ of the B & O in the car maintenance department. After two years he became a clerk in the Clark & Co. market, where he remained for eight years. In 1917 he entered the army and was located at Fort Wayne and Detroit. The following year he returned to this work at Clarks.\n\nIn 1921 Mr. Heinlen started in the mercantile business for himself in the Slifer building on the west side of North Randolph street across from his present location. After four years he purchased the building from Mrs. Rozelda Hoover in which he is now located. It was at that time an old frame building, one of the early store buildings constructed in Garrett, built in 1885 by David E. Hoover. Eleven years ago Mr. Heinlen remodeled the building, practically rebuilding it, and it is now a fine structure with a large floor space and a fine apartment on the second floor where Mr. Heinlen and his family make their home. Mr. Heinlen also owns the Cities Service property at the corner of Randolph and Railroad streets. Five years ago he bought the filling station and grocery at St. Michaels corner on road 27 five miles north of Waterloo.\n\nMr. Heinlens store is a fine department store with a large stock of staples, canned goods, notions, ready-to-wear and yard goods, The expressive slogan used by this store is \"Everything to wear, to eat, to use.\" Mr. Heinlen has three rural huckster routes, and his is the only store in Garrett maintaining this service.\n\nMr. Heinlen is well known in this vicinity and he has supported civic enterprises and is a member of the Chamber of Commerce. He has been active in the American Legion and belongs to other fraternal organizations.\n\nSTUMPS GRAIN AND COAL CO.\n\nThe Stump Grain & Coal Co. of Garret owns a modern elevator located on East Quincy street that has served the farmers about Garrett in an excellent manner since the beginning of the century.\n\nCharles Abell purchased the business in 1912 and built the modern and complete building which is still being used. The elevator had previously been managed by J. S. VanHouten, Charles Girardot, Fred Schulthess, Fyke Brothers and Hawley Bros. Charles Abell operated the business from 1912 to 1919, when a group of farmers purchased it and managed it by means of a board of nine directors. Mr. Stump bought the property from the Farmers Elevator Co. a year ago. The elevator affords splendid shipping facilities and enjoys an extensive business.\n\nSince Mr. Stump bought the elevator he has installed a hammer-mill, a feed mixer, a new 15-ton scales, and has made various other improvements which greatly add to the service which can be rendered to the community. Mr. Stump handles all kinds of grain, salt, coal, seed, feed, fertilizer, fence posts, tile, farm machinery and farm equipment.\n\nRIEDHARTS\n\nStanley Riedhart was born in the mountains of Austrian Tyrol. He comes from a family of thirteen children. As a boy he was a mountain guide and climber. He played the violin and sang in the world famous Passion Play presented in the village of Brixlegg in 1903. He learned the tailors trade at his fathers home in Austria. He left home when a young man, full of ambition to see the world. He worked in Paris, France, Belgium, Germany, and Switzerland before he came to this country, where he intended some day to own his own home and business.\n\nMr. Riedharts uncle, Joseph Singler, a native of Austria also, came to Garrett in 1876 and opened two stores, a general merchandise and a meat market, at the present site of the Singler home on South Cowen street. After twelve years he moved his business to Randolph street where he had erected a new store building, which is still being used by the Reidhart Co. When Mr. Riedhart reached Garrett he was employed in the store, and in 1912 he purchased a half interest in the business. By 1919 he was the sole owner of the store and building, he immediately started improvements, constructing a new front on the store and an addition to the rear. He installed modern equipment, electric refrigeration in the meat department, steam heating and new lighting and fixtures.\n\nRiedharts is one of Garretts few stores which has remained in one building for as long as fifty-nine years, and has had only one change of ownership since it was started in 1876.\n\nMr. Riedharts volume of business had shown a steady increase from year to year. He specializes in Little Elf Food Products, government inspected meats, dry goods and general merchandise. He has his own delivery system. Service to the community is his hobby, and his store is always a delightful place to shop.\n\nStanley, as almost everybody knows him, takes great interest in civic affairs and is active in many organization.

The excellent mechanical features combined with the beauty of the car make it one of the most attractive automobiles on the market.\n\nGARRETT ICE COMPANY\n\nThe Garrett Ice Company was incorporated in 1922, and during that year construction of a modern ice manufacturing and storage plant was started. The first board of directors consisted of J. I. Morrison, A. A. Cole and A. O. Brong.\n\nIt was one of the first plants in this part of the country to be powered by a fuel oil, or Diesel engine. Every modern development in ice manufacturing equipment was incorporated in its construction, and the raw water system (a system of manufacturing ice from unheated water, properly softened and run through pressure filters) is at this time the one favored by leading engineers. The companys docks are a regular icing station for the Baltimore & Ohio railroad, in addition to which the railroad purchases a substantial quantity of ice for purposes other then refrigeration cars. This is used on engines, cabooses, dining care, coaches, and in the local offices.\n\nA large volume of wholesale business is conducted, the bulk of this tonnage being handled by owners of truck lines who make retail deliveries in surrounding cities, extending as far as Lake James. It is estimated that 50 per cent of the companys entire receipts are derived from sources outside of Garrett.\n\nActive officers of the company are A. A. Cole, president, and Mrs. Nova Cole, secretary. They carry a full line of ice refrigerators and say that there is a steady increase in the demand both for ice and for ice refrigeration.

He and Mrs. Johns were married in 1903 and they have two daughters, Mary Edythe, who teaches in the Huntingtown high school, and Beverly, a student at Miami University at Oxford, O.\n\nROYAL THEATRE\n\nThe history of the Royal theatre is one of the most interesting stories that could be written about any business in Garrett, and that is because so many people are interested in todays movies of the early days.\n\nLegitimate shows, musical programs and home talent shows always appeared in Wagners Opera House after that building was built in 1889. When the first moving picture machines appeared in town they were in the ferm of the \"10c a look\" machines still to be found at carnivals and amusement parks. Then came the nickelodeons, so named because of the admission price was everywhere, and for several years, five cents. The first movies were shown in a tent with sawdust floor, and camp chairs to sit on, on the vacant lot just south of Schunks garage. Fred Paul and Cummings were the proprietors of the \"theatre.\" At the same time Joe Krantz, about 1907, opened a nickelodeon in the fame building now occupied by Sherwoods Shoe Shop.\n\nIn 1908 the first real theatre was opened in the Zeek building on Randolph street just south of the bank. John H. Zeek established the Pastime theatre with all the latest equipment, which included a silver screen curtain in place of the cotton cloth screens used before that time, and picnic chairs to seat 150 people. He later put in 250 chairs, and in 1909 installed seats.\n\nThe Edison and S. & A. companies were some of the first producers and some of the stars who were well known in the early flickers were Francis X Bushman, Beverly Bayne, Alice Brady, Florence Lawrence, Florence Turner, Mary Pickford, Charles Chaplin, G. W. Anderson in Westerns, John Bunny and Emily Whalen, Katherine Williams in serials, Red Berry, a juvenile, Clara Kimball Young, Gloria Swanson, Hoot Gibson in Westerns, Alice Joyce, and Ham and Bud in comedies.\n\nChas. J. Rollins built the present Royal theatre in 1913. Some of the men who managed it were Alva Widmer, Raymond L. Behler, and H. A. Giles. Wayne Smith, A. C. Kalafat and H. E. Hart bought the Royal in 1929. The Pastime theatre was sold to Frank Owens in 1917, and then successively to Alva Widmer, Otto Heinzerling, H. D. Chapel and L. C. Swartout. Mrs. Giles managed both the theatres then for a time. The Pastime was closed in 1931 by Smith, Kalafat & Hart.\n\nMr. Kalafat is a native of Greece, having come to this country from his homeland in 1916. He went first to Hicksville, and then managed an ice cream parlor in Auburn for twelve years. Since his purchase of the Royal theatre he has managed it capably and has maintained a high standard of pictures. Apparatus for talking pictures was installed in 1932. Mr. Kalafat shows the most outstanding pictures of the major companies, including Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount, 20th Century-Fox and Warner Bros. First National.\n\nSTERN CLOTHING CO.\n\nOver twenty-five years of sincere service is the record of \"Stern Value,\" the only store in Garrett which has had no change in either management or location in that time.\n\nHerman Stern and Harry Weinberg came from Michigan City July 5, 1910, to look at the stock of the Leigh Hunt clothing store, which was for sale. This did not meet their requirements, so they decided to try to rent the Fountain building which housed the Rollins grocery, as Mr. Rollins was selling out.\n\nHiring a horse and buggy from the Denny Johnston livery, they drove out to see Richard Fountain and a leasing agreement was made, which was drawn up at the E. M. McKennan law office.\n\nThen ensued a period of great activity. The boxlike show windows contained small panes of double strength glass. This was replaced with plate glass, but the size of the windows was not increased at that time. After arranging for the building of proper shelving on the interior, both partners left Garrett to purchase stock and fixtures. They took possession of the store Sept. 1, 1910, and had their grand opening on the fourteenth.\n\nMany changes have been made since that time. Both windows and interior have kept pace with the trend of modern merchandising. Today their slogan, Stern Value, stands for \"The Brightest Spot in Garrett,\" a store where value and integrity of purpose will continue to help build for Garrett an enviable reputation as a trading center.\n\nGARRETT ELECTRIC & SUPPLY CO.\n\nIf one is looking for electrical or plumbing supplies or appliances he can be almost sure to find what he wants at the Garrett Electric & Supply Co. at 122 East King street, of which M. A. King is manager.\n\nThe business has been in its new location in the Clevenger building for only the last six weeks, moving there from the Schelter building at 212 South Randolph street. Mr. King started in business in Garrett in the Schelter building in 1920, doing electrical and plumbing work and handling supplies. After several years he moved his business to 115 North Randolph street and then back to the Schelter building, and now to its new location.\n\nBesides the usual electrical and plumbing supplies the Garrett Electrical & Supply Co. also handles washing machines, electric refrigerators, glass and light hardware.\n\nMr. King came from Defiance, O., in 1911 and lived on a farm north of Cedar Creek before coming to Garrett in 1920. He and his family live at 304 East Quincy street.\n\nNORTH SIDE SERVICE STATION\n\nA combination service station and grocery store is operated by J. J. Smith at the corner of Randolph and Clark streets, called the North Side Service Station. Mr. Smith has been running the business for almost a year, taking it over after the death of the former proprietor, Paul Olinger.\n\nSinclair gas and oils are the products handled for automobiles, and in the store besides groceries are stocked candies, cigars, cigarettes, ice cream, baked goods and soft drinks.\n\nBefore going into business Mr. Smith had many years of experience in local groceries and meat markets. Mr. Smith and a daughter, Margaret, and son, Harold, live at 811 South Franklin street.\n\nBAND BOX HAT SHOP\n\nBack in the days of monstrous chapeaux, when large plumes and lifelike vegetable gardens were used to trim the creations of velvet and taffeta, there was of necessity always a millinery in Garrett. Some of the names familiar to the ladies of Garrett are Miss Stickney, who had a shop in the building now used as an interurban station: Mrs. Ella C. Vivian, who "
