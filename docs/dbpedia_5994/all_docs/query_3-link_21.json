        "text": "Elizabeth Ann Bayley Seton, a widowed mother of five children, came from a prominent family in New York City. In the early 1800s, she was ostracized from her family and friends after converting to Catholicism.\n\nElizabeth moved to Baltimore, and under the protection of the Sulpician Fathers of St. Mary’s Seminary, she opened a school for the education of girls, a concept relatively unheard of at the time.\n\nShortly thereafter, with Bishop John Carroll’s approval, she and her small group of women took vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. In 1809 Bishop Carroll, who had designated her “Mother” Seton of the little community of sisters, encouraged her to expand their efforts and to devote themselves to educating young girls in the arts, sciences and Christian living.\n\nWith a generous gift from Samuel Cooper, property was purchased in Emmitsburg, Maryland in 1809. That same year Elizabeth and her band of sisters moved to Emmitsburg and opened Saint Joseph’s Academy and Free School, which evolved into Saint Joseph College.\n\nElizabeth Ann Seton died on January 4, 1821. Her legacy included laying the foundation for Catholic school education in the United States; establishing a community of religious women, the Sisters of Charity of St. Joseph; and in 1975, being canonized as the first native-born saint for the United States.\n\nAs registration increased at the Academy, the curriculum expanded to meet the needs of the changing world. Professors from nearby Mount St. Mary’s and visiting instructors from Baltimore were added to the Sister faculty. In the prospectus of 1879-80, there is an announcement of a postgraduate department, especially designed for the graduates of the Academy or other institutions. It consisted of a thorough course in reading, belles’ letters or time devoted to the attainment of a greater skill and proficiency in art or music.\n\nAn amendment of the original charter was sought and obtained in 1902. This enabled “the Sisters of Charity, the faculty and teachers of said corporation, St. Joseph’s, to confer degrees, collegiate and academic.” The program offered by the school at this time was equivalent to that of a Junior College. The catalog issued in 1902-03 lists primary, preparatory, academic and postgraduate courses, noting that those who completed postgraduate work were entitled to a baccalaureate degree in arts or sciences. It was not until 1907-08 that a distinction was made between the collegiate and academic departments. In the collegiate course, two electives were required. Choices were Latin, Greek, Spanish or German. At the end of the third or junior year, a gold medal and certificate of graduation were offered to women who did not intend to take a degree, but those hardy students who persevered to complete the fourth year received a baccalaureate degree an uncommon and extraordinary event for a woman in the early part of the twentieth century.\n\nShould the recipient of the degree wish to return to Saint Joseph’s for a fifth year of college work, she might do so, thus becoming eligible for a master’s degree in the arts. The certificate and gold medal, which culminated the three-year course, were discontinued in 1912, and the first class to complete a four-year program together and graduate as full-fledged “bachelors” was the Class of 1914.\n\nCredit for the development of Saint Joseph’s from Academy to College belongs to Sister Francis Lawler. She had come to Saint Joseph’s in 1898 as “senior teacher” and was made Directress of the Academy in 1906. Keenly aware of the renaissance of education in the early twentieth century, Sister Francis worked tirelessly to develop the curriculum and to meet the requirements necessary to make Saint Joseph’s a first-class liberal arts college. When the separation of the collegiate and academic departments was completed in 1907, Sister Francis became “Dean of the College” as well as Directress of the Academy and Principle of the elementary school. She retired as Dean in 1929.\n\nFor the first 90 years after the founding, many women associated with St. Joseph’s returned to the Valley to renew their friendships and visit their former home.\n\nSister Augustine Park, the fifth successor to Mother Seton as Directress of the Academy, thought it was time to form an association of graduates and students of the Academy to link them together in friendship for each other and for the school.\n\nThis all started the afternoon of June 16, 1897, when Sr. Augustine initiated the organization of the Alumnae Association with Mary Wade Kalbach, Class of 1871, Elizabeth Keenan White, Class of 1865 and M. Stella McBride, Class of 1897. Acting as co-founders, the three alumnae received the graduates of 1897 as charter members of the new Alumnae Association. A simple constitution was drawn up along with objectives of the Association. It was placed under the patronage of Mary Immaculate “to keep graduates and former students in close touch with their school and with each other.”\n\nDuring the Association’s meeting on June 12, 1912, a suggestion was made by Clara Douglas Sheeran, Class of 1894, to form “sewing guilds” in various cities and localities where many alumnae lived. The object of the “guilds” was to keep members in touch with each other and current on news from the Academy. The guild would contribute articles made by alumnae to the sisters for use in their hospitals, asylums and homes for the poor. These guilds became chapters and a chairperson became the “regents” for the chapter. The original eight “sewing guilds begun in 1912-13, grew to 23 clubs spanning the United States.\n\nToday, more than 50 years after the closing of St. Joseph College, its Alumnae Association, comprised of approximately 1,700 living alumnae, is a strong, vibrant, philanthropic organization financially supported by 660 active members who contribute annually to the Association and its philanthropies.\n\nMay 2024\n\nSpring Greetings to SJC Alumnae!\n\nWe just finished our annual reunion, celebrating the class of ’74, who came back in numbers even though they never graduated from SJC. It was great to see their spirit and happiness at being together. Nadine Brainard Smith ’74 said “So glad I came. It’s the first one I have been to and I am coming next year’. Pat Zeigler Conley ’69, said “It’s always fun. It is great to see so many familiar faces.’ And Eileen Stanford ’64 said “Words can’t express how I feel. Reunion was beyond our wildest dreams’.\n\nWe have ONE MORE REUNION – April 3-6, 2025. There is a ‘save the date card’ included in this mailing, please keep it as a reminder for our last reunion. We expect to have 300+ alumnae there PLUS guests, based on numbers class agents supplied late last year. The board met with the Wyndham and with FEMA to make sure we have enough space to accommodate these numbers. The Wyndham has basically given us the whole downstairs of the hotel, so that space should work. FEMA doesn’t have a space to accommodate those numbers inside any building, so we will be holding different activities on Friday to get everyone on campus. The brochure will go out in mid-October to all alumnae and registration will open up November 1 for both the hotel and SJCAA activities. If you want to get into specific activities, please register asap. Events will be first come, first serve. Registration will close March 1. We will have a professional photographer at events both Friday and Saturday to capture these memories. Those photographs will be in the final 2025 Valley Echo which will go to all dues payers.\n\nAfter 2025, our reunions will be joint with the Mount, which is held the first full weekend in June. There will be some SJC specific activities – a college dinner the night MSM holds class dinners (if there are a good number of SJCAA attendees), and the Friday tours of our old campus.\n\nAt our annual meeting, Mary Jackson, Program Director PA Program, MSM School of Health Professions spoke. Mary expressed her gratitude for the generous gift from the SJCAA for the school. The new building is in progress and opening has just been rescheduled to January 2026. During the pre-accreditation process, suggestions were made to make the classes stronger. MSM President Trainor said “The university’s decision to take additional time will enable us to incorporate additional components and create a nation-leading program from the start.” All SJCAA donors will be invited to attend the grand opening ceremony. We will keep you updated on timing, but it will probably be October 2025.\n\nSJCAA has raised $233,000 of the $250,000 we committed to contribute to the school. Mary Ann McWhorter Riley SJC ’74 challenged the alumnae to contribute for the first time, or contribute again, and she will match the next $5,000 donated to the school (May 1 through March 2025). Mary Ann did not graduate from SJC but she says Joe’s will always be her identity on so many levels. Mary Ann believes that SOHP is a continuation of Mother Seton’s dream to serve.\n\nI personally have been amazed at how quickly SJCAA responded to this new initiative which will help keep the SJCAA name alive in the Valley. The lobby will be named the “Saint Joseph College Alumnae Lobby” which students and visitors will see as they enter the building. There are other tributes to SJCAA within the lobby which a special subcommittee of alumnae from ’63 to ’74 are working on with the Mount. Information will be shared with the Association when everything is approved. A donation form is enclosed with this mailing if you would like to make a new or additional donation to SOHP. To date, 137 alumnae have contributed to this cause.\n\nOur Finance Chair, Claire Maurer, updated us on the financial state of the Association. 2023 was the first year we lost money, a total of $3700. Our losses could have been almost $18,000 but were reduced by credits from the Wyndham and from MSM. Losses for 2024 and 2025 in total are projected to be over $53,000. As of now, we have $40,000 in dues towards our budget of $50,000 for 2024. For those of you who have already given dues, THANK YOU. No need to send in more dues. Anyone who is not current with dues is receiving a dues envelope with this letter. We ask that you think about contributing to the Association – there are only two more dues’ drives remaining. Any remaining monies in our treasury when we merge with the Mount Alumni Association will be donated to charity.\n\nAgain, thank you for your continued support through all these years. We expected that we would be losing money for many years by now – and thanks to the generosity of the Association, we just went into the red in 2023. That support has been overwhelming to us and shown us how much the members appreciate all the work we do, as volunteers, to ‘stay alive to 2025’. Thank you for your generosity and for the members who are not current with their dues, thank you for paying them now.\n\nHave a good Spring and we will update you as we have more news. Looking forward to seeing many of you at the final SJCAA reunion April 3-6, 2025. It will be one for the history books!\n\nKaren Mattscheck ‘72\n\nSJCAA President\n\nReunion 2022 was one for the books. We had three class celebrating their 50th, the classes of 1970, 1971, 1972. It was a memorable weekend! We finally got to be “All Together” and everyone couldn’t stop talking. Well, I did, as I lost my voice!\n\nThe Class of ’70 had 29 Alumnae attend and we sure enjoyed the hospitality suite hosted by Alberta Johnson Baker, Helen Burke Rasmussen and Kathleen McNaney Younkin. We had a place to congregate and of course, cheer on North Carolina, loudly. At the Friday Night Class Dinner, Maryann Lesso gave a fantastic summary of our four years at Joe’s. Carol Ervin Sharkey gave a short synopsis at the Saturday Banquet, and Mary Ann Wiberley Shattuck presented our Class Gift to Barbara Rupert, a member of the Mother Seton School Board. Barbara Rupert informed us that our Gift helped 34 families.\n\nThe Class of ’71 had 28 alumnae attend and they had a great Class dinner together on Friday night. Their Class Gift of $6,000.00 was presented on Saturday night to Mother Seton School.\n\nThe Class of ’72 was out in force to celebrate their actual 50th, enjoying the Presidential Suite at the Wyndham. Their Friday Night Class Dinner was made even more special by the Video presented by Joe Doherty, MSMU C’70, the husband of Mary Mehl Doherty. Joe was officially inducted into the SJC C'72.\n\nAt our Saturday Breakfast and Annual Meeting, Karen Mattscheck awarded our SJCAA Scholarship at Mount St. Mary’s University to Margaret Widman, MSMU C’22 and Angela Vodola, MSMU C‘23.\n\nMaryann Lesso, C'70 received the Legacy Award. Maryann has been a Worker Bee on the Alumnae Board running the “Store”, Reunion Chair and now Editor of the Valley Echo. She has been instrumental in upgrading the publication and using color photos on the cover and in the magazine.\n\nThe Saturday Night Banquet was a little different, as we had 3 classes celebrating their 50th. The Hassell Cup Award and Sr. Mary Kelley Award were won by the Class of ’72. There was a tie between the Class of ’51 and Class of ’55 for the Class of 1952 Award, also known as the Husbands’ Memorial Cup, awarded to the class with the highest percentage of husbands and other guests in attendance.\n\nThe highlight of Reunion was the Campus Tour. Merrill Sollenberg, our FEMA contact, recruited a team that truly made the tour special for us. Kathleen Robinson Moritis, Class of ’70 wrote that everyone was so welcoming. It really did feel like homecoming…like the people who bought your childhood home welcoming you back to look around and listen to your stories.\n\nOnly 3 Reunions left! Mark your calendars for April 13-16, 2023. The Class of ’73 will celebrate their 50th, but all are invited attend Reunion 2023.\n\n- Mary Ann Wiberley Shattuck, ’70, Reunion Chair\n\nReunion 2023 celebrated the Class of ’73 as our “Golden Girls”. They were the last four- year class to graduate from Joe’s and 36 of them came to party. The Presidential Suite was hopping but they all found they couldn’t last past 10:00 pm! Ellen Smelas and her Class of ’63 celebrated their 60th with 22 classmates. Eleven from the Class of ’68 who were celebrating their 55th joined with three from the Class of’58 celebrating their 65th, for their Friday night dinner.\n\nThere was one fly in the ointment! At 6:40 am on Saturday we were all startled by the fire alarm going off in the hotel. We found ourselves going downstairs in our pajamas to find it drizzling outside. The Fire Department came, inspected the hotel, then we all climbed back up the stairs. It was the topic of conversation at Saturday’s Breakfast and Annual Meeting. Karen Mattscheck ’72 presented the SJCAA Scholarship at Mount Saint Mary’s University to Angela Vodola ’23, a 2022-23 recipient and Rachel Warren ’24. Due to Alumnae generosity the Scholarship will be $6,800.00 for the coming academic year. The 2021 Legacy Award was finally presented in person to Kate Graham ’68 for her contributions on school publication – The Valley Echo and Allegra as photographer, writer and editor - which began during her first days in the Valley in 1964. The 2023 Legacy Award was presented to your humble servant Mary Ann Wiberley Shattuck ’70 for my years of service on the Board and running Reunion since 2015. It is an honor I will treasure.\n\nThe Saturday Night Banquet was full of fun visiting with our classmates. Martina Esther Sabo ’73 presented us with some wonderful words. She quoted from Luke, Chapter 8 verse 2 about “certain women”. “Consider these synonyms of the word certain: which includes: convinced, positive, confident, firm, definite, assured and dependable as they supported Jesus Christ in His Ministry. These descriptors speak of us to one degree or another and speak to our common heritage at St. Joseph’s College. We span decades with those attributes and we share a joint legacy of virtue and action…. May we declare as certain women that Jesus is the Christ, our Savior and Redeemer. May we tightly hang on to Him and to one another in the years to come. “\n\nThe Hassel cup was awarded to the Class of ’63 for the highest percentage of members in attendance. The Sister Mary Ellen Award went to the Golden Class of ’73 for the highest number of members in attendance. Finally the Class of 1952 Award also known as the Husband’s Memorial Cup was awarded to the Class of ’68 for the highest percentage of husbands and other guests.\n\nSunday Buffet Breakfast came too soon. It was time to say goodbye to friends we have known since our first days at Joe’s. We have a special bond.\n\nWe have only two more Reunions. I encourage you to contact your classmates now and plan to attend Reunion 2024 - April 4 – 7.\n\nMary Ann Wiberley Shattuck ‘70\n\nReunion Chair\n\nReunion Summary 2024\n\nWhat an amazing Reunion this was. The Class of ’74 celebrated their 50th in grand style. For a class that didn’t get to graduate from St. Joseph’s College they came to Reunion 25 strong. As Pattie LaNeve Mullaney put it, “I am still HUNG OVER with HAPPINESS!! It was a special event to be “All Together”. Thank you everyone!”\n\nThe Class of ’69 celebrated their 55th and according to predictions was not going to have very many attendees. Well, those predictions proved wrong as 31 showed up ready to renew old friendships. The Class of ’64 not to be outdone had 27 Alumnae return to celebrate their 60th Anniversary. We also had 3 from the Class of ’54 and one from ’58 who had their children bring them. They got to see the special women our Alumnae are.\n\nAt Saturday’s Breakfast and Board Meeting Karen Mattscheck “72 presented the SJCAA Scholarship at Mount Saint Mary’s University to Rachel Warren and Colin Long.

Trudie has been on the SJC Board for many years holding several jobs from Vice President, President, Communications Chair but most importantly Class agent for the Class of ’74. She has been the glue bringing her class together for many Reunions and especially their 50th celebration this year. Congratulations.\n\nOur Saturday evening began with Mass at the Basilica. Always the highlight of our reunion, we came together to celebrate our time at St. Joseph’s and remember our classmates with the candle lighting ceremony. From there we went to our Banquet and celebrated with our Golden Jubilarians who regaled us with their remembrances of Joe’s. For the Class of ’74 who did not get to graduate from our college they still remarked “here we are, 50 years later to re-connect and celebrate and laugh again as we honor our small school in the middle of nowhere and St. Elizabeth Ann Seton who had the vision and courage to start it all.” The Class of ’74 generously donated $8,824.63 to Mother Seton Elementary School and $11,785.00 to the SJCAA Scholarship at MSMU.\n\nThe evening was not complete without the presentation of our Traditional Reunion Awards. The Hassell Cup awarded to the highest Percentage of members in attendance went to our Golden girls from the Class of ’74. The Sister Mary Ellen Award went to the Class of ’69 who had the highest Number of members in attendance. The Class of ’52 Award, the Friends and Family Cup went to the Class of ’54.
