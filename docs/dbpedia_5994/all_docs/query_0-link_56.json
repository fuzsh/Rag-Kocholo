        "text": "Former Justice Millard Caldwell was the 54th Justice on the Supreme Court. He served from 1962 to 1969. His family had owned plantations and farmed before and after the Civil War, and Caldwell and his family lived on five different plantations during his childhood. He determined to go to college in 1914, entering Carson-Newman College and excelled in sports. His hot-headed spirit on the field resulted in his dismissal in 1915.\n\nHe then joined the Army and channeled his vigor in more constructive ways. After World War I, he returned to college at the University of Virginia, where he earned a law degree and settled in the Florida Panhandle where he practiced law and banking, and soon entered politics.\n\nElected to the Florida House of Representatives in 1929, he served two terms, then served in the United States House of Representatives until 1941.\n\nIn 1944, he ran successfully for governor of Florida. In 1950, he accepted a Civil Defense position in Washington, DC. He returned to the private practice of law in Florida in 1952 with strong anti-Communist beliefs.\n\nIn 1960, Caldwell helped Farris Bryant win the governor’s race and two years later, was appointed to the Florida Supreme Court at age 65. Caldwell retired from the court, at age 72, due to age restrictions in the constitution, and pursued legal and business work until his death.\n\nQuick Facts about Justice Caldwell"
