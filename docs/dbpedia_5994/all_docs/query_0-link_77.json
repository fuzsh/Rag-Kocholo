        "text": "1913\n\nReflecting Progressive Era frustrations with government inefficiency and corruption, Jesse S. Reeves, chair of the University of Michigan's political science department, proposes America's first master's in municipal administration.\n\nWhile Reeves is primarily focused on international law (and in 1930 will serve as a technical advisor at the League of Nations Hague Conference), he believes \"that the University has a distinct opportunity, not only in offering a public service to the people of the state [of Michigan]…but in leading the way in the training of municipal experts.\"\n\n16th Amendment permits a graduated income tax.\n\n1914\n\nUniversity of Michigan announces the nation's first graduate degree in municipal administration; a three-month professional experience in municipal governance is required for graduation. Robert T. Crane, who served as consul in Argentina and Guadalupe, is appointed director.\n\nA Bureau of Reference and Research in Government is established to ensure that courses are tied to the most pressing issues faced by municipal government leaders.\n\nFirst joint master's degree, in public works administration, offered with the University's engineering department. Many more will follow.\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson signs the Federal Trade Commission Act on September 26, 1914. The Federal Reserve System, established at the end of 1913, begins operations.\n\n1916\n\nLent D. Upson, first director of the Detroit Bureau of Government Research, is recruited to teach weekly seminars in municipal governance and to coordinate student internships in Detroit. His starting salary: $0. Later, the bureau will become the Citizen's Research Council of Michigan. \"The right to criticize government,\" says Upson, \"is also an obligation to know what you are talking about.\"\n\n1917\n\nCapen A. Fleming becomes the first student to earn the Master of Municipal Administration degree. Following graduation, the Kansas native moves to San Francisco, where he will serve as manager of the Chamber of Commerce Department of Industry.\n\nUnited States declares war against Germany on April 6; Selective Service Act signed into law on May 18.\n\n1919\n\nOver the last two years, World War I has prevented many students from continuing their studies; no municipal administration degrees are conferred this year.\n\nThe University of Michigan opens the Michigan Union building. It's a gathering space, but only for men.\n\nVersailles Peace Treaty signed on June 28; League of Nations established to promote world peace.\n\nThe 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is ratified, prohibiting the sale and manufacture of alcohol.\n\n1920\n\n19th Amendment is ratified on August 18, giving American women the right to vote.\n\n1922\n\nThomas H. Reed takes over as director, serving for the next twelve years. Reed is an academic who taught at Berkeley, but also a municipal government leader who served as city manager of San Jose, California and executive secretary to California Governor Hiram Johnson. Reed places emphasis on practical municipal problems.\n\nReed continues the commitment to hands-on professional development opportunities for students, \"You can't teach all there is to know about managing a city academically. You cannot put it in the form of lectures, or get it into a textbook, and give it to a young man, and let him read it, and send him out a full-fledged city manager. He has to cut his eye-teeth upon some kind of a city manager problem.\"\n\n1927\n\nCharlotte Mary Conover Jones becomes first alumna. As field secretary for the Dayton Ohio League of Women Voters, Conover Jones helps coordinate citizenship schools for women, an active lecture series, and municipal research projects for local leaders.\n\nA number of international students graduate this year, including Rudolfo Kawi Hidalgo, from the Besao Mountain Province of the Philippines. Hidalgo, the son of a rice farmer, will go on to represent his district in the Philippine Legislature.\n\n1928\n\nArthur W. Bromage joins the faculty as a specialist in municipal affairs.\n\n1929\n\nIn response to pressure from alumnae, the University of Michigan opens the Michigan League–it's open to students, faculty, and staff, but only women.\n\nStock market crashes on October 29; Great Depression will soon follow.\n\n1931\n\nIone Dority (AB '23, ABLS '27) is hired to build the research collection in public administration. By 1940, she's gathered 25,000 books and documents and nearly 50,000 pamphlets. The material is broad in scope, but Dority places special emphasis on materials of relevance to the State of Michigan.\n\n1933\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt inaugurated on March 4: \"... A host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of existence, and an equally great number toil with little return,\" he says. \"This nation asks for action, and action now.\"\n\n1934\n\nA grant from the Horace H. Rackham estate allows the Bureau of Government to expand research programs; bureau begins work on an analysis of fiscal policy during the Great Depression.\n\n1935\n\nThe degree program is discontinued for two years due to low enrollment during the Great Depression, but Harold D. Smith, a 1925 alumnus, runs the research bureau while serving as first director of the Michigan Municipal League.\n\nSmith goes on to serve as budget director for the state of Michigan, then as budget director for the U.S. under Franklin D. Roosevelt. He oversees the U.S. budget from the end of the Great Depression to the launch of the United Nations and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, part of today's World Bank.\n\nThe Social Security Act of August 14 provides aid for the elderly and others in need.\n\n1936\n\nThe Institute of Public and Social Administration is formed by an interdepartmental committee. The goal: to expand the curricular focus from municipal administration to public administration more broadly.\n\nA Charles Stewart Mott Foundation grant allows for another expansion of Bureau of Government research. The primary focus: Michigan taxation and finance. Publications offer a condensed analysis of property tax delinquency, retail sales tax, highway finance, and more.\n\nA second joint-degree is offered--the master’s in natural resource administration--with the School of Natural Resources.\n\n1939\n\nIt's been twenty-five years since the launch of the Master of Municipal Administration degree program. All told, only sixty-seven students have earned the degree, an average of three per year.\n\n“The most valuable resource of this nation is the soil,” writes Ayers Brinser in Our Use of the Land, a book describing America’s land use problems through the Dust Bowl. Brinser is part of the interdisciplinary group that spearheads a comprehensive curriculum review for the institute in the late 1960s, leading to a shift from administration to policy. “Gold is more spectacular; iron has in two generations made men richer; copper has opened up greater possibilities of advancing techniques. But, it is the soil which produces the lasting and essential wealth of the nation,” he writes.\n\nWorld War II begins as Germany invades Poland.\n\n1940\n\nMary Ellen Heitsch Ward graduates. The only female in her class, she's announced as \"Mr. Heitsch\" at commencement. She is engaged in public service and administration ever after, and becomes a particularly passionate advocate for people living with disabilities, a cause she serves for more than five decades.\n\n1941\n\nWorld War II interrupts the studies of many students and class offerings are reduced. The required professional experience is maintained through a partnership with the Michigan Civil Service Commission.\n\n1944\n\nBretton Woods Conference is held July 1–22, gathering hundreds of delegates from Allied Nations to regulate monetary practices.\n\n1945\n\nThe United Nations is formed on October 24.\n\n1946\n\nThe Institute of Public Administration is born, led by an interdisciplinary executive committee of deans and directors.\n\nBetty Lou Bidwell (MPA ’50) begins her studies in public administration. Her memoir of the time period, and scrapbook of photos and memorabilia, paint a picture of a thriving institute and tight-knit community. “The couple of dozen students in the [public administration] program were a varied group. Some were veterans, there to prepare for a career in government, and many were married. Along with the faculty and research assistants, we enjoyed a lively social life together. We organized a Michigan Chapter of the American Society for Public Administration with regular meetings, excellent speakers and great refreshments. We held parties regularly on Friday afternoons—any excuse for a party!—and in the spring held big picnics at a local park, including spouses, children and faculty members. One year some of us traveled to Washington, D.C. by train to attend the annual national conference of the ASPA,—an adventure by itself.”\n\n1947\n\nJohn W. Lederle serves as director from 1947-1960 when he leaves to become president of the University of Massachusetts. A former Detroit lawyer, Lederle consults for the United States House and Senate and serves on a number of state boards and commissions.\n\nJune 5, Marshall Plan pledges support to European nations to rebuild after WWII.\n\n1949\n\nThe October Newsletter to Graduates reports, \"If we get very much prouder of all our graduates, we'll be bursting at the seams… we can boast of 2 city managers, 3 administrative assistants to city managers, 3 \"professors,\" 11 in state government, 2 at Washington, as well as numerous graduates scattered through personnel and planning agencies, citizens' groups, research offices, etc. from Maine to California. Not bad, for a post-war crop…\"\n\n\"The famed spring picnic (Second Annual) was a riproaring success,” reports the Institute of Public Administration’s May 1949 Newsletter to Graduates. “A mob of 72 ASPA’ers…turned up on May 8th at the Dexter-Huron Metropolitan Park….After miscellaneous contests including spirited egg tossing and a three-legged race (won by Gene Moody and bride), the group adjourned to the baseball field where Dorrit’s Delinquents suffered defeat at the hands of Bromage’s Firefighters, 9 to 2.”\n\nHarding Hughes (MPA ‘48) is tapped to conduct a complete classification and pay survey for Winston-Salem, NC’s 1,200 jobs. Among his responsibilities, making field audits. “Exciting but not enjoyable event occurred when the Fire Training Lieutenant coaxed me up the 85 ft. aerial ladder. Up at the top of the building, the lieutenant first tried to sign me up for the fire department, then yelled down for a net for me to jump into. I took one quick look at the ground, declined both invitations, and returned to terra firma immediately, if not sooner--by the ladder.” (October 1949 newsletter)\n\nGerald R. Ford runs for his first public office to support the Marshall Plan–wins his U.S. Congressional seat with an impressive 60.5 percent of the vote.\n\n1950\n\nIn an arrangement with the U.S. Department of State, the institute hosts eleven young German administrators for a five-month democracy program.\n\nHaven Hall burns down. No one is badly hurt, but the Bureau of Government collections suffer extensive damage. About a third of the collection is beyond recovery, much of the rest is water-logged.\n\nBetty Lou Bidwell (MPA ‘50) takes a break from her work at the Ohio League of Women Voters to attend the Ohio State game at U-M. She favors IPA students with a visit, and “some well-chosen remarks about cultivating the grass roots in Ohio,” reports the student newsletter. They honor her with a tinseled chapeau and certificate of merit. The certificate recognizes Bidwell for, among other things:\n\n“dashing through the offices, thus creating a self-propelled air-conditioning system,”\n\n“keeping the staff on edge for days while deciding whether to work in New York or Ohio,”\n\n“sympathetically listening to all tales of trials and tribulations,” and\n\n“handling mail, typing, saving stamps, criticizing reports, and performing a multitude of other chores too numerous to mention.”\n\n1952\n\nU.S. Agency for International Development grant allows faculty to help establish the National College of Public Administration and Governance at the University of the Philippines. Letters from Manilla discuss the resurrection of Rizal Hall (after WWII bombing damage), residential and in-service courses for current and future public servants, a growing library, and more.\n\n1953\n\nLarry Mohr (MPA '63, PhD '66) meets Odetta at a North Beach bar in San Francisco. The two will go on to record the live folk/blues album, Odetta and Larry (aka The Tin Angel), released by Fantasy Records the following year. From 1966 until his retirement in 1999, Larry will teach scores of aspiring public servants at U-M.\n\n1954\n\nChief Justice Warren, delivering the opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education, concludes that “in the field of public education the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. . .\"\n\n1955\n\nRosa Parks refuses to give up her seat on an Alabama bus.\n\n1957\n\nThe institute opens a field office on the ninth floor of the Bank of Lansing building. Lansing staff coordinate research projects for state clients and organize internships for public administration students.\n\n1958\n\nInstitute staff conduct a comparative study of prison camps in Canada and the U.S., as well as several state studies on administrative service growth, workmen's compensation, natural resources management, controls on state agency spending, and more.\n\n1960\n\nFerrel Heady, one of the founders of comparative public administration, is appointed director of the institute. He believes that all public administration students should be knowledgeable about the governance systems used abroad, and advocates for incorporating a comparative perspective into all courses. In 1966, Heady publishes Public Administration: A Comparative Perspective, now in its sixth edition.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy announces the concept of the Peace Corps during a Presidential campaign stop on the steps of the Michigan Union. \"How many of you who are going to be doctors are willing to spend your days in Ghana?\" he asked the students huddled around the steps. U-M students rally around the concept and more than a thousand pledge to serve.\n\n1962\n\nU.S. Agency for International Development contract sends IPA faculty to Taiwan to assist in the development of National Chengchi University's Department of Public Administration.\n\nJean Drew Lightfoot (MPA ‘50) is featured in Jet magazine. “Meanwhile, Jean Drew Lightfoot, now acting director of the Community Relations Conference of Southern California, will begin work early in September as special assistant to the director of the office of public liaison in the State Dept. Mrs. Lightfoot, who holds a master’s degree in public administration, was formerly employed at Howard University.”\n\nCuban Missile Crisis\n\n1963\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. gives “I have a dream” speech\n\n1964\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson delivers \"Great Society\" speech at U-M commencement. \"The Great Society rests on abundance and liberty for all. It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice….But that is just the beginning.\"\n\nThomas H. Reed (director 1922-1934) returns for the 50th anniversary of the program. In the 1920s and early '30s, says Reed, \"we generally patted ourselves on the back that we were doing something unique here.\" That's no longer the case. Similar training programs have sprung up at a number of universities.\n\nTwo-hundred and fifty-one students have graduated in the last 25 years, an average of ten per year.\n\nJohnson signs Civil Rights Act on July 2, Economic Opportunity Act on August 20, Food Stamp Act on August 31, and others.\n\nNice prognosticating.\n\nAt a panel on the future of public administration, Deil S. Wright (MPA '54, PhD '57) sums up the first fifty years of research, and tries to peer ahead to 2014. Wright's predictions include:\n\nhigh-speed computers will make it easier to handle scores of variables, and will reduce the effort and cost of analyzing data;\n\ngreater methodological sophistication, more sophisticated theories, and more studies confirming causal relationships;\n\na combined empirical-normative approach;\n\na closer relationship to the policy process that will \"force researchers to have a concern for value judgments based on the[ir] research findings;\"\n\nbetter and more relevant information for decision-making, but no easy answers for administrators; and\n\nthe continued growth of interdisciplinary studies and more research in which a given problem is approached simultaneously with different techniques.\n\n1965\n\nUniversity of Michigan faculty organize first teach-in to protest the war in Vietnam. Thousands of students attend. Teach-ins will follow at universities around the nation.\n\n1967\n\nLansing field office closes. Ferrell Heady, director of the institute, recruited to the University of New Mexico.\n\nNovember 29, Robert McNamara resigns his post as Secretary of Defense to lead the World Bank. McNamara and his \"whiz kids\" employed advanced statistical methods and systems analysis to streamline the Pentagon. They also contributed to the escalation of the Vietnam War.\n\n1968\n\nA comprehensive review of the institute is launched, led by an interdisciplinary advisory council that deliberates on the future of public administration. The council believes many practical skills can be learned on the job, and suggests refocusing the curriculum on \"an analytic toolkit\" and cutting-edge \"problem-solving methodologies.\"\n\nTwenty-nine year old Pat Crecine is appointed director of the transitioning institute and serves in that capacity until 1973, when he's recruited to Carnegie-Mellon where he's first dean, then senior vice president and provost. In 1987, Crecine becomes the 9th president of Georgia Tech.\n\nThe Institute of Public Policy Studies (IPPS) is launched; it's the nation's first public policy degree program (others will soon follow). Crecine and his colleagues dramatically reshape the curriculum. The pioneering interdisciplinary social science core emphasizes economic and statistical analysis, an understanding of the political environment of policy, and the importance of organizations to successful implementation. This will become the gold-standard approach, employed by policy schools everywhere.\n\nPatrick Crecine and others attend “Half-Baked Ideas Seminars” and share “Smirking Papers,” with the goal of getting feedback while ideas are in the early stages of development and new ideas and collaborations are easier to integrate. “The norm is one of minimal preparation, polish, and ego involvement,” he writes.\n\n1970\n\nU-M students protest war and discrimination. A massive teach-in on the environment is held in March, attracting roughly 50,000.

He encourages faculty to take leaves of absence to serve government agencies. \"When faculty members return,\" he says, they immediately see ways to improve the curriculum, \"to better prepare students for entry into government.\" He pushes to integrate realistic problem-solving exercises into policy courses.\n\nIPPS PhD and postdoc programs are launched with gifts from the Ford Foundation and National Institute of Mental Health. Early graduates include Patrick Larkey (MPP '71, PhD '75), who goes on to direct the Department of Social and Decision Science at Carnegie-Mellon University and John Padgett (MA/MPP '74, PhD '78), who becomes professor of political science, history, and sociology at the University of Chicago.\n\nFord grants Nixon full pardon. Foreseeing a long litigation, bitter controversy, divisive national debate, and challenges to the credibility of government at home and abroad, Ford says, \"It could go on and on and on, or someone must write the end to it. I have concluded that only I can do that, and if I can, I must.\"\n\n1975\n\n\"In order to maintain a balance of trade we are now beginning to export Ph.D.s as well as import them,\" writes Jack Walker, director of the Institute of Public Policy Studies, in a March 20, 1975 memo to faculty and staff. \"Pat Larkey, or the first product with the letters IPPS Ph.D. tatooed across his forehead, has accepted a position as Assistant Professor in the University of British Columbia's School of Business. Besides unlimited funds for travel and research assistance, and excellent facilities and colleagues, he has rainbow trout in his backyard (salmon are in the front), ski slopes on the mountains overlooking the city, and total wilderness an hour by car outside Vancouver. The only drawback is that he will no longer be the highest paid graduate student in the world. Now he is the highest paid Assistant Professor in the world, but that definitely is a step down.\"\n\n1976\n\nFirst endowment is established in honor of Arthur W. Bromage, a beloved faculty member and public administrator.\n\nFord signs the Government in Sunshine Act on September 13, narrowing the authority of agencies to withhold information from the public and requiring most agencies to give advance notice of meetings and to hold them openly.\n\n1977\n\nPresident Carter launches Presidential Management Intern Program to entice public management graduates into federal service. First IPPS PMIs are Andy Moxam and Stephen Deal.

This will become a core component of the school's curriculum in the years ahead.\n\nRobert Axelrod begins research for The Evolution of Cooperation (Basic Books, 1984). The book, which has been translated into 12 languages and is taught and read around the world, earns him a MacArthur Foundation genius grant (in 1987) and the first National Academy of Sciences award for \"behavioral research relevant to the prevention of nuclear war.\"\n\n\"IPPS Goes International.\" Newsletter announces a new international track to prepare students for mid-level positions at USAID, the World Bank, the United Nations, and other agencies.

Gramlich serves first stint as director of the institute from 1979-83. He'll serve a second stint, too; then a third. A nationally recognized economist, Ned spends the next decades balancing prominent public service commissions (Governor of the Federal Reserve Board among them) with the mentoring and training of aspiring public servants.\n\nFifteen policy schools and research institutes become charter members of the Association of Public Policy and Management (APPAM); among them, the Institute of Public Policy Studies.\n\nDepartment of Education Organization Act signed October 17.\n\n1981\n\n“IPPS Automates,” designing software to replace faculty, reports IPPS RIPPS, an irreverent student newsletter that stormed the institute from 1981-83. “Michael Cohen, found packing his bags for California, muttered, ‘I kept emphasizing the human factor and job satisfaction, but once they got rolling, there was no stopping them. They just kept screaming, ‘Efficiency, Automation, Computerization!’” Among the authors of IPPS RIPPS, Jeff Mackie-Mason (MPP ’82), now dean of the U-M School of Information.\n\nGeorge Johnson wins “Best Dressed Professor” from The Michigan Daily after an energetic letter-writing campaign, including Gary Woodard’s pithy nomination: “George Johnson is best, dressed.”\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control reports the first cases of what will become known as AIDS.\n\n1983\n\n\"Ned Gramlich, the Mr. Rogers of the policy world, is stepping down from his directorship as of July 1,\" reports IPPS RIPPS. Paul Courant, \"a man of different temperament, a modern-day (shorter) Rasputin, who has for years influenced the decisions of Milktoast Gramlich,\" takes the reigns from 1983-1987. Later asked if he anticipates any significant changes in the structure of the institute, Courant responds, \"Not really, Helene [McCarren] will still be running the place.\"\n\nPublic Policy and International Affairs (PPIA) program is launched by the Sloan Foundation in a national effort to help underrepresented minorities prepare for leadership roles in public service. IPPS signs on, and has never looked back–a point of pride. During three decades, more than 15 percent of the 4,000 Public Policy and International Affairs Fellows will complete their studies in Ann Arbor. Alumni include Foreign Service officers with USAID, senior policy advisors to the United Nations, vice presidents at major corporations, program managers at national nonprofit advocacy groups, and more.\n\n1984\n\n1985\n\nScientists discover hole in earth's ozone.\n\n1987\n\nEdie Goldenberg becomes the first female director of the institute–during her two-year tenure, she helps to lay the groundwork for IPPS's transition to a school. Edie's next post? Dean of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts–a role she'd fill for nearly a decade.\n\nElena Delbanco replaces Tish O'Dowd as IPPS' part-time writing tutor. Increasing numbers of students turn to her for help and over time, additional writing instructors are hired. Today, three instructors teach writing courses and work one-on-one with the Ford School's students. We'd like to say the school's intense focus on policy writing is \"unique,\" but Delbanco outlawed that word here years ago.\n\n1989\n\nWith initial funding from the Rockefeller Foundation and ongoing support from the Ford Foundation, Sheldon Danziger organizes a postdoctoral training program on poverty and public policy for minority scholars.\n\nSeventy-fifth anniversary of the program. In the last twenty-five years, 783 have graduated from the program, an average of 20 per year.\n\nJoel Smith (MPP '82), part of the EPA's strategic studies branch, co-edits a highly publicized Report to Congress entitled, \"The Potential Effects of Global Climate Change on the United States.\" The report states that increased production of greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, could cause the earth's atmosphere to warm by 3 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit within 100 years causing rising sea levels, increases in northern crop acreage, dieback of southern forests, and severe water supply shortages in California.\n\n1990\n\nAlumni/ae Advisory Board meets for the first time, \"The advent of the Board is part of what I am coming to think of as the \"growing up\" of IPPS,\" says Paul Courant, during one of several stints as director. \"In addition to being a window on the practice,\" Courant says, \"I hope that the Board will also serve as a door (or, perhaps, as a Star Trek-like teleporter) between IPPS in Ann Arbor and IPPS in the rest of the world.\"\n\n\"The IPPS computing center (i.e., closet) has recently become a much happier place,\" reports the newsletter.
