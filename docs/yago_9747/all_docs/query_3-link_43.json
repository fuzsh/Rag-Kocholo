The film watches as Matty attempts to both crawl his way out of addiction and atone for an event that happened during a memory blackout. “Abel Ferrara’s ”Blackout,” a film featuring sex, drugs and Claudia Schiffer, caused a stampede when it was shown at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival. “- The New York Times\n\nIf… Dog… Rabbit…, 1999 (35mm) Written, Directed, Produced & Starring: Matthew Modine\n\nJohnnie Cooper (Matthew Modine) served time for an armed robbery, in which his father and brother also participated.

He is so damaged by what he saw that he has completely shut himself off from reality, imagining that he is actually a bird. Birdy is confined to a mental hospital, where the doctors are at a loss as to how to treat him. In an attempt to help, Al, his best friend from high school — and who was also in Vietnam — visits him every day to try to get through to him.\n\nEquinox, 1992 (35mm) Director: Alan Rudolph\n\nWith sinuous lensing from his frequent ‘90s cinematographer Elliot Davis, Rudolph puts a menacing yet contemplative spin on the storytelling tradition of good twin/bad twin. Matthew Modine expertly delineates his portrayals of the separated at-birth brothers; one is a timid mechanic raised by salt-of-the-earth M. Emmet Walsh and pining for Laura Flynn Boyle, while the other is a flashy thug in Fred Ward’s crime ring and married to Lori Singer. Shall the twins meet?\n\nI Am What You Imagine, 2023 (DCP) Director: Matthew Modine\n\nMatthew Modine’s award-winning new short film, I Am What You Imagine, is a sensual exploration of the unexplainable. Featuring the voice talents of Ruby Modine and long-time Kubrick collaborator Leon Vitali (in his final performance), the short uses sound, music, and expressionistic imagery to take viewers on a journey of the heart and mind.
