        "text": "Is there a better use of music in a film than Tom Waits' Somewhere cover at the end of this film? Maybe What'd I Say in Cosmic Ray for pure effect... but there is no more appropriate use of music I can think of, both because Waits' raspy voice sounds like Nick Nolte's, and because Waits' mannered, overtly stylized performance style gives way to such a torrent of emotion in this song. To appreciate the song requires one to look beyond his idiosyncrasies as a vocalist and fully accept what he is doing as a genuine expression of real feeling. This is much like what Rudolph expects us to do with his films and his characters; think about the moment‚Ä¶\n\nIt is not the typical silly romantic movie, but even so, it fails to convince me and I cannot empathize with the characters. I like the general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe movie (the premise is based on two couples who deceive each other) but not how it is carried out. The performances are not bad but I don't love them.\n\nFinal Score : 68% üçè\n\nsorry but fuck this.\n\nlook at that poster. read that synopsis.\n\nyou'd assume an underwatched middling romcom? even Amazon says that its a \"stylish dramedy\". huge mistake.\n\nthis film is sheer anti-sex nightmare. its fucking Crash (1996) for your mum and dad. Its one of those films that makes you feel like theres another, new organ inside your body liquefying into blackness and feeding your brain gangrenous pieces of itself.\n\nthis film is about sexual hurt, infidelities complex knowledges, marital mistakes made raw, its about the sheer vicious directionless pain of loss and sex's completely temporary high to trick ourselves into feeling that our present, thanks to our past, is absolutely fine, despite the wallpaper peeling and the damp entering‚Ä¶\n\nEducating myself on the victims of Helen Hunt‚Äôs Oscar Win, Julie Christie in Afterglow was able to afflict emotion on a radiant and compassionate tone. The nuance of her relations with Nick Nolte‚Äôs character really shine in a valued effort. While the direction doesn‚Äôt do much for the two of them, the layered script compiles of strength and bewitching imagery.\n\nüîúMrs. Brown\n\nJulie Christie has the kind of face you find on the covers of romance novels, and surely one of the reasons she was cast in \"Dr. Zhivago\" was that she would look so good on the poster. She projects the wounded perfection of a great beauty who has had the wrong sort of luck. In \"Afterglow,\" only her third role in the 1990s, Alan Rudolph has given her the sort of character she knows inside out: bemused, sad, needful, mysterious. - Ebert\n\nNick Nolte, Jonny Lee Miller, and Lara Flynn Boyle fit their roles, but this role fits Christie perfectly. It feels written for her. I wish there was another movie with this same cast in this same universe, but‚Ä¶\n\nJulie Christie is gorgeous, she's too damn good of an actress that she had to elevate this dull, humdrum, and lifeless film. I finished this film feeling completely nothing. The two pairing that I thought sparked some chemistry was Julie and Jonny's chatacter. It had a nice concept but it was executed so poorly. It could've done much better, but the route that it took was just not it.\n\nGrade: C-\n\nüîôThe Conjuring\n\nSometimes I forget why I loved Alan Rudolph movies so much when I first moved to NYC. Part of me thinks it must be related to nice memories I have associated with that time of my life. Going to the Quad, watching movies on film prints, staying for the Q&As, being with friends.\n\nBut that would be selling the filmmaker short. The thing that always comes through with the best Alan Rudolph films is this realism they all have despite being unlike any reality I‚Äôve ever been apart of. When I watch one of his movies I‚Äôm in a slightly different world but one that feels so lived in and plausible. Love is there but slipping through your fingers.\n\nA comedy/drama that is all over the place, the tone shifts constantly. It can be frustrating to watch, but thankfully Nick Nolte and Julie Christie are just too talented to let it fall apart. Full of coincidences, might be hard to buy for some viewers. Nice to see Lara Flynn Boyle in something, its been ages. Jonny Lee Miller looks like a baby in this!"
