        "text": "Jeffrey Byron (Jonny Lee Miller, Sick Boy from Trainspotting), an ambitious man in his twenties from Montreal, is a corporate executive with a large company and fate smiles on him. However he is too conceited to see that his wife Marianne (Lara Flynn Boyle) is not feeling very happy. Marianne looks after their luxury apartment, but above all wants to have a baby. On the other side of town we become acquainted with the rocky marriage between the taciturn odd-job man Lucky (Nick Nolte) and his wife Phyllis (Julie Christie). She was once a B-film actress and now spends much of her time watching her old films on video. As with the Byron’s, sex is low down the list, albeit for different reasons. The departure of their daughter during one of their quarrels throws another shadow over their relationship. When Lucky has to do some odd jobs in the Byron house, Marianne immediately falls for this charming guy. In the meantime, Jeffrey has met Phyllis and falls in love with this more mature and refined lady.Alan Rudolph, who looked into the world of writer Dorothy Parker two years ago in Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle, is also on form in his latest film. Helped by an excellent cast and with his own scenario, Rudolph manages to make an entertaining comedy of morals about adult family problems in the big city.\n\nFilm details\n\nCountry of production\n\nUSA\n\nYear\n\n1997\n\nFestival edition\n\nIFFR 1998\n\nLength\n\n113\"\n\nMedium/Format\n\n35mm\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish\n\nPremière status\n\n-\n\nDirector\n\nAlan Rudolph\n\nCinematography\n\nToyomichi Kurita\n\nScreenplay\n\nAlan Rudolph\n\nProducer\n\nSandcastle 5\n\nSales / World rights holder\n\nMoonstone Entertainment, E1 Entertainment Benelux"
