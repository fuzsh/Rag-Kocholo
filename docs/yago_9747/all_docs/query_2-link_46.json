        "text": "Carl Jung once said, “The sole purpose of human experience is to kindle a light in the darkness of mere being.” That is what this film is all about: chasing joy, facing fears, and loving recklessly. It is a coming-of-age story that centers on five boys and their experiences growing up in Beloit. Bonding over a shared passion for parkour, the boys explore everything from abandoned buildings to the great outdoors, finding strength in one another and discovering what it means to be human.\n\nFrom police encounters to cliff jumping, camping-gone-wrong disasters to devastating injuries, this film is packed full of exciting twists. Exhilarating panoramic shots give perspective on the intensity of these parkour stunts, and the camera angles will have audiences gripping the edges of their seat with white knuckles! I felt an emotional connection to the boys from the first moment I watched them laughing together in a messy living room. It is clear they are deeply connected to each other and are willing to go to crazy lengths to be in one another’s’ lives–even when that turns out to be costly.\n\nThe film covers topics like domestic abuse, addiction, and mental health. Yet these boys find the strength to overcome hardships, and they refuse to be defined by the obstacles they face. That’s what parkour is about: moving past obstacles with creativity, courage, and tenacity. For these friends, parkour transcends athletic movement–it is a way of life, a reflection of how to face both physical and emotional challenges.\n\nThis story is genuinely moving. Its lightheartedness will spark laughter, and the honesty of these boys will leave audiences pondering the rich value of friendship. The film is more than the sum of its action-packed stunts and clever camera shots–it invites us all to contemplate our lives and inspires us to recognize our humanity and find our inner strength. As one of the friends remarked in the film, “It’s a bit cliche to say, we do only live once.” With only one life to live, why not try to be everything we can be? Our lives can be as full as we choose to make them–and who we choose to be is up to us. So if you are seeking encouragement to be the best version of yourself, ‘Afterglow’ is the film you need to see!\n\nFrom police encounters to cliff jumping, camping-gone-wrong disasters to devastating injuries, this film is packed full of exciting twists.
