        "text": "You've probably heard the story that there are no new ideas in Hollywood and that any new film is simply a variation on one of only a handful of the original stories. Whether that's true is debatable, but if a new film is done in a unique way, or given a new spin, it will often feel fresh and audiences will forget that, in essence, they've seen the story many times before. If not, the movie feels like a tired retread of so many movies that came before it. Unfortunately, \"Afterglow\" falls into the latter category. How many times have we seen films were the partners of spouses involved in an affair meet, and then have an affair of their own? While this film tries to throw in a few variations -- an over-the-hill \"B\" movie actress who laments her lost career and her runaway daughter -- they're not enough to bring new life to this latest try in the affair genre.\n\nThe performers involved certainly give it some decent tries, and film does offer a decent cast. Nick Nolte, who we've always enjoyed, delivers what's probably his best subdued performance since his Oscar nominated role in \"The Prince of Tides\" (1991). Like that film, here he plays against what's become his normal, gruff-voiced stereotype character popularized in films such as \"48 Hours.\" Possessing a wide and varied resume of films, we hope this role will overshadow some of his more disastrous movies such as \"I Love Trouble\" (with Julia Roberts).\n\nJulie Christie makes her second rare appearance in a film within a year since last year's \"Hamlet.\" Once a big star in Hollywood (and an Academy Award nominee for 1971's \"McCabe & Mrs. Miller\"), Christie had all but disappeared from major films, no doubt due to the lack of roles for older women. Like Nolte, we've always enjoyed Christie's performances and here she gives a sort of Faye Dunaway take on her aloof character. Unfortunately she's given lines such as \"My soul needs an overhaul\" and \"The hard part is finding out too late it can't last\" that probably looked great in the script but sound artificial coming from her mouth. Still, it's good to see her on the big screen again and hopefully she'll be given better roles after this film.\n\nLara Flynn Boyle and Jonny Lee Miller finish out the adulterous foursome and adequately perform their roles. Boyle finally gets a bigger role after a career of supporting and smaller bit parts. Miller, however, doesn't get to do much other than play the creep (which he does quite well) -- and is nearly unrecognizable from his role in last year's \"Trainspotting.\"\n\nDirector Alan Rudolph (1994's \"Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle\" and 1991's \"Mortal Thoughts\" with Demi Moore), goes back to the type of film he's more comfortable with, and that's showcasing troubled people. Like fellow director Mike Figgis (\"Leaving Las Vegas\" and \"One Night Stand\"), however, he doesn't create a story that' s fun to watch. I'll freely admit that I'd rather see a fun or happy story any day over a soap opera-ish film dealing with troubled people. Who needs or wants to see films about that? It's readily available in real life and trivialized in the many daily soap operas, so if it's going to be done on the big screen, I want to see something that sparks my interest.\n\nWhile the performers involved give it their best, they can't overcome Rudolph's less than inspired direction and the lackluster screenplay (that he also wrote). The coincidence factor -- where things too easily happen in the story -- is extremely high and only hurts the plot. Jeffrey and Phyllis just happen to sit next to each other in a bar and lo' and behold they later find out that they're the significant others! (What are the odds of that happening?) And Marianne just happens to hire Lucky, an adulterous plumber who can fix her own \"plumbing\" dilemma. (Quite convenient!). Some clever writing (creating situations that would develop from the characters being more proactive) could have gotten around those \"problems\" and made everything seem quite logical. Yet Rudolph doesn't see to care that they're so preposterously remote that they derail any momentum he was building.\n\nThe only moments that uniquely stand out involve a few lines playing off the main character's name (Oh what a \"lucky man\" you are, etc...) and some odd moments where Rudolph speeds up the film and shows characters zipping around the screen. Although such moments are way out of place and the motivation behind them is unclear at best (other than to get through a slow scene rather quickly), at least they add a little pizzazz to an otherwise tired, worn out, and old as the hills plot. If it weren't for the performances, this would be an awful film, but as it stands, it's simply repetitive and mediocre. We give \"Afterglow\" a 3.5 out of 10."
