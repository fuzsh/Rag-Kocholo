        "text": "Directed by Alan Rudolph and released in 1984, this Comedy/Drama/Romance is part of the 2018 Cinetopia Film Festival in conjunction with the symposium The Unreal Reality of Alan Rudolph: Conversations with the Filmmaker & Collaborators. Buy tickets through Cinetopia or at the door.\n\nAbout the movie:\n\nRudolph hit a high note with this utterly seductive and knowing L.A. story, popular at the Quad in its initial run. On the night shift, “The Love Line” radio host Geneviève Bujold offers romantic counseling, which she herself could use given unresolved issues with erratic lover Keith Carradine, his other lover Lesley Ann Warren, her married lover Patrick Bauchau, and his frustrated wife Rae Dawn Chong. The title song and others are performed on the soundtrack by Teddy Pendergrass.\n\nFull symposium schedule: https://www.lib.umich.edu/announcements/symposium-celebrates-unreal-reality-indie-director-alan-rudolph"
