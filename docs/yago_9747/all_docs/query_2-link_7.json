        "meta_description": "The Afterglow: Directed by Yolanda Torres, Joan Álvarez Durán. With Paul Coster, Claudia Trujillo, Sarah Tyler Shaw, Marc Aguilar Sebastián. THE AFTERGLOW weaves a tale of obsession, its denial and eventual acceptance, where the ghosts of the past refuse to be ignored any longer. Oliver Price is a successful writer whose personal life was marked by a sinister childhood encounter: his sexual awakening at the hands of a dead girl. Since then, Oliver has stubbornly clung to an obsession with finding a dark, almost supernatural relationship. One day Oliver believes he has found what he is seeking in his dead brother's girlfriend, an enigmatic girl who seeks refuge by his side as she tries to recover her memories, destroyed in an apparent suicide attempt. The relationship between Oliver and Laura darkens with obsession and by a strange nature which threatens to destroy them both.",

        "text": "THE AFTERGLOW\n\nA small gem of vampires that traps us in a hypnotic narrative telling a story of impossible love. In line with films like Let the right one in,The Afterglow becomes one of those cult movies that reviews the vampire genre with the elegance of Murnau or Herzog.\n\nIntelligently structured, the script maintains a sense of tension, guiding us through a series of events, each increasing the suspense throughout the film. With carefully chosen, minimalist dialogs. The treatment of the atmosphere, characters, aesthetics lead us on an internal quest of the characters, alluding to classic expressionist themes such as the state of the soul, fears, fantasies and dreams. It is this element, dreams, that brings great beauty to the film. They are present in the shots and angular perspectives that give the work an air of mystery and uncertainty. The shadows so present, mainly connected to the protagonist, are one of the many details that have been taken carefully crafted in the film.\n\nThe actors are fantastic; Paul Coaster is drawn as a writer haunted by a memory which drags him into an addictive degradation towards Claudia Trujillo, Laura in the film, a magnetic woman who at times makes you want to hug her and at others, makes you want to run, great work by the directors of the film.\n\nIn short, a small vampire cult gem to whom lovers of good vampire movies would not mind offering our best blood film.\n\nLaura Muñoz (Screenwriter)"
