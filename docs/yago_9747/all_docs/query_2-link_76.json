For more information, please visit this link: Resurfaced Reviews.\n\nAfterglow\n\nRating\n\nDirector\n\nAlan Rudolph\n\nScreenplay\n\nAlan Rudolph\n\nLength\n\n1h 59m\n\nStarring\n\nNick Nolte, Julie Christie, Lara Flynn Boyle, Jonny Lee Miller, Jay Underwood, Domini Blythe, Yves Corbell, Alan Fawcett, Michèle-Barbara Pelletier, France Castel, Genevieve Bissonnette, Claudia Besso\n\nMPAA Rating\n\nR\n\nBasic Plot\n\nAn ex-B-movie star. Her fix-it husband. A young businessman. His baby-wanting wife. They come together in one of the few love quadrangles in memory.\n\nReview\n\nJulie Christie plays an aging former B-movie star, Phyllis ‘Phyl’ Mann. Her life has been very traumatic including the loss of her daughter Cassie many years earlier.\n\nNick Nolte is Lucky, her husband and the man she never gets to sleep with. He spends most of his time doing ‘fix-it’ jobs for female clients and providing extra services for those who want them.\n\nJonny Lee Miller is Jeffrey Byron. His life is looking up as he is one of the movers-and-shakers of the business he works for. He has two brief sexual thoughts about his secretary, Helene Pelletier (Domini Blythe), while the man in the office across the hall, Donald Duncan (Jay Underwood), has a few sexual thoughts about him.\n\nLara Flynn Boyle is Marianne, Jeffrey’s wife. She wants to have a baby, but Jeffrey does not. She’s hit her fertile period and is desparate to have a child. Enter Lucky and all four characters start inter-mingling in one way or another.\n\nOverallre are some brilliant pieces of cinematography. There was a lot of editing that should have been done. While the entire sequence with Duncan is interesting and create some funny moments, it could have easily been left out. It had no real point to the film.\n\nChristie gives the only shining performance in the film rest are merely window dressing.\n\nAfterglow, while occasionally an entertaining movie, focuses too much on sex and not enough on character.\n\nAwards Prospects\n\nJulie Christie gives a fine performance, but not an Oscar-worthy one. Nothing else stands out in this film as extremely exceptional.\n\nReview Written"
