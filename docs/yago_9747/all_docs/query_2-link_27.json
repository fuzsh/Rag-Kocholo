        "text": "The effort involved in producing Afterglow was as tremendous as the film itself. All the equipment, diesel power, cameras, food, tents, and the crew and athletes were shuttled across international borders, stuffed into an array of planes, trains, automobiles, and helicopters to then be hauled through chest deep snow. Over the course of 6 weeks, 14 people utilized more than 9,000 lbs of gear in a logistical feat that defies logic. We employed pulley systems and expended gallons of blood, sweat, and tears as far as 70 miles from the nearest human civilization. In wrapping up at each location, care was taken to leave each scene in as pristine condition as it was found.\n\nThe team was forced to develop custom camera rigs and lights for filming during the deepest nights when the temperatures dropped as low as -15 Celsius. The project required a switch to nocturnal life with the work day beginning at 7:30PM and concluding at 7:30AM. The crew and athletes had to rely on mental strength and determination to cope with acute sleep deprivation and the extreme cold.\n\nThe scope of the project was massive. From researching custom-fabricated LED lights to designing specialty LED ski suits, the Sweetgrass crew also needed innovative systems to transport lights across landforms of massive scale. Merging Hollywood-style production with backcountry savvy Sweetgrass aimed to showcase how wildly different the experience of skiing could be using the power of color and light.\n\nThe crew braved frigid temperatures, slept on glaciers for days, and lugged 50+ lb camera packs day in and day out. After countless hours in the field, and even more behind the editing keys, AfterGlow was born."
