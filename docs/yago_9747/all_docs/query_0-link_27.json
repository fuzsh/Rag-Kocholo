        "text": "Blu-ray Release Date: Jan. 19, 2021\n\nPrice: Blu-ray $14.59\n\nStudio: MVD Visual\n\nMVD Visual has bundled a pair of romantic comedies directed by Alan Rudolph and issued them as a well-priced double feature Blu-ray.\n\nFirst off, Nick Nolte (48 Hrs.), Julie Christie (Darling), Lara Flynn Boyle (Men in Black II) and Jonny Lee Miller (Trainspotting) star in the wry 1997 romance Afterglow, which concerns a handyman who wreaks havoc and builds romance in two marriages. Desperate to have a baby, Marianne hires Lucky Mann to remodel a nursery. There’s just one problem: Marianne’s not pregnant and her husband isn’t interested in sex. So what’s a handyman to do?\n\nIn bizarre, unrelated turns of events, Ray (Keith Carradine, Nashville) and Helen (Sondra Locke, Bronco Billy) each happen upon large sums of money which give them the chance to re-invent themselves. Ray Meets Helen from 2017 features an all-star supporting cast that includes Keith David (The Nice Guys), Samantha Mathis (American Psycho) and Jennifer Tilly (Bound)."
