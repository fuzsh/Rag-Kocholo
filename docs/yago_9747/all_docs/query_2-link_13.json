        "text": "Every film has its own set of challenges, but this one came with a laundry list.\n\nWith so many iconic moments and great performances throughout its existence, we really had to hone in on overarching themes as opposed to individuals, because the Relays have always been larger than one athlete. We really had to do our research to pick and choose which stories to include and then figure out if there was archival footage or photography of that particular year. In many cases, there wasn’t. Especially in the early years. During the first twenty some odd years of the relays, film footage of the event didn’t exist because the technology was in its infancy. This proved to be a challenge on more than one occasion and we had to find other mechanisms to tell that part of the story.\n\nFrom a production standpoint, we were only able to film one modern Penn Relays – the 125th anniversary. What we didn’t know at the time, however, was that it would be the end of the 125 year consecutive streak due to COVID19, with the 126th running canceled. We actually found this out during the post- production process (which took place during Philadelphia’s stay at home order). This resulted in us having to adjust some of our creative decisions pretty late in the game. Needless to say, working as a remote team also had its own set of unique challenges, especially with the amount of archival footage we were dealing with throughout the process. I can’t say enough about how thankful I am for such a great diverse, team and how they persevered throughout the entire process under incredible circumstances.\n\nIn a time when our country couldn’t be more divided, it was a joy to tell a story that involved bringing people together and embracing our differences. By the end of the project, I had such a beautiful experience and developed an incredible amount of admiration for the way sports can unite us."
