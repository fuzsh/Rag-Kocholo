        "text": "Probably only Alan Rudolph, the director of Choose Me and Trouble in Mind, could have come up with the quirky vision of heaven that he has created in his new film, Made in Heaven. Instead of the customary sanitized billows of clouds, Rudolph’s heaven is a place where all your most romantic ideas seem to have flowered.\n\nHeaven is where you can spend all your time painting, while the Paris cityscape stretches out through your window; where all the streets are cobblestoned; where a bench next to a lakeside rises up over the water during a lovers’ conversation. This is, quite simply, the way Heaven really should be, a place where God is a sympathetic, slightly ornery red-haired man named Emmett.\n\nThis heaven is where Mike (Timothy Hutton) ends up after his young death in the 1950s. In Heaven, Mike meets another soul, Annie (Kelly McGillis), with whom he falls in love.\n\nFine. But according to the screenplay by Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon (the obviously talented writers of Stand by Me), souls are constantly being recycled. So Annie must leave Heaven to enter the body of a baby being born on Earth, in the 1950s, and Mike begs Emmett for the chance to be born on Earth, too, and somehow find his true love. Emmett agrees, but Mike only has 30 years to locate the reborn Annie.\n\nAnd so the film leaves Heaven for a tumultuous time on Earth. Mike and Annie are new people, with no conscious memory of their past lives, and they find vastly different paths to take; she as a successful toymaker and unhappy wife of a director of TV commercials, he as an illegitimate poor child who grows up to be a drifter, crisscrossing the country in search of a something he just can’t remember.\n\nRudolph allows the movie to become an impressionistic portrait of recent times, with an especially keen ear for the way music drops into lives and helps give meaning to an era. But the romance remains of primary importance, and Rudolph remains unabashedly true to his lovers.\n\nWith his customary indulgence for eccentricity, Rudolph has populated Made in Heaven with strange and wonderful actors. He’s got members of his stock company popping up in small roles, and he’s got prominent musicians doing cameos: Ric Ocasek as a grease money, Tom Petty as a gambler, Neil Young as a truck driver who helps the hero down the road.\n\nAnd there are strange, uncredited bits, including Ellen Barkin as a floozy who uses Hutton in a scam. Most notable guest appearance is by Debra Winger (Hutton’s wife), who plays God. It isn’t just a cute stunt, either; Winger creates a complex character. She even establishes that, perhaps in response to all his awesome responsibilities in Heaven and Earth, God is a chain-smoker.\n\nFirst published in The Herald, November 1987\n\nFor Rudolph’s stock company, I must have been referring to folks like John Considine and Dirk Blocker – and Tom Robbins is in here, too. The cast is crammed with good people: Maureen Stapleton, Amanda Plummer, Ann Wedgeworth, Don Murray, David Rasche, James Gammon. My memory is that the movie doesn’t really work, but is pretty fun to watch along the way. This review has too much synopsis going on, but (writing an hour or so after seeing it, no doubt) I seem to be pleasantly in the movie’s mood.\n\nAlan Rudolph continues to stake his claim as the most intriguing and original young director in America. His independently produced films (Choose Me, Trouble in Mind) are stunning, seductive movies, and even the projects he occasionally makes within the studio system (such as last year’s Made in Heaven) are more interesting than almost anything else around.\n\nWith his newest film, The Moderns, Rudolph has realized a dream project that he’s been trying to make for nearly a decade. It’s quintessential Rudolph: a deceptively drowsy look at the various intellectual and sexual configurations within a group of offbeat characters, marked by the director’s tilted sense of humor, surrounded by a superb score (by Mark Isham) and played out in a luscious setting.\n\nThat setting is Paris, 1926, where some American expatriates are devouring the city that Hemingway called “a moveable feast.” The focal point is Hart (Keith Carradine), a painter who is coerced into forging some masterpieces. But his main concern is the re-emergence of a woman (Linda Fiorentino) from his past, who is now married to a brutal businessman (John Lone, fresh from his title role in The Last Emperor).\n\nOthers include the icy (but tres chic) society dame (Geraldine Chaplin) who commissions the forgeries; a sardonic art dealer (Genevieve Bujold) who declares, “Art is only an infection. Some people get it, some people don’t”; a gossip columnist (Wallace Shawn, simply a joy); and Hemingway (Kevin J. O’Connor) who is affectionately used as Hart’s comic foil.\n\nRudolph and his co-screenwriter, the late Jon Bradshaw, have given these characters some stylized dialogue. You can’t quite get a handle on it; some characters speak in epigrams that may or may not be serious, and Hemingway stands in the corner saying things that are poetic and comic at the same time: “It’s easy to be hard-boiled in the daytime. But at night….” Just when you think things are getting thick, the gossip writer scuttles in and announces, “I just ran into Maurice Ravel in the men’s room. He didn’t recognize me!”\n\nThe characters inhabit a loving re-creation of the cafes, galleries, and studios of Paris (filmed, with appropriate irony, in Montreal). Rudolph and cinematographer Toyomichi Kurita don’t aim for a slavish period homage, but for a living place full of dark corners, smoky rooms, and the breath of artistic creation.\n\nThe movie is full of irony, such as the thought that Hart’s lasting contribution to art history might be the forgeries he so grudgingly creates, and that in the end the characters escape the disintegrating Paris scene for the siren song of Hollywood.\n\nBut Rudolph always brings a sweetness to his films, and The Moderns has a typically off-center happy ending. The happy ending doesn’t diminish the emotional complexity of the film and its characters. It just increases the sense that The Moderns is one of those movies one could easily live inside.\n\nFirst published in the Herald, May 26, 1988\n\nThey showed this at the opening night of the Seattle International Film Festival that year, and a friend and I, full of Hemingway enthusiasm, went over to Rudolph at the party to say how much we’d gotten a kick out of the depiction of Hemingway in the movie. Whereupon Rudolph seemed to want to get away very quickly—I think he was used to people criticizing that aspect of the picture, and misunderstood our approach. Whatever. Then all those years later Woody Allen went and worked his own variation on the theme.\n\nIn the opening shot of Choose Me, characters wander into a street scene and start dancing to the sounds of the funky music on the soundtrack. Highly unrealistic, and it serves as a warning: You either sway to the peculiar rhythms of this idiosyncratic film, or you will be left behind.\n\nI’ve seen Choose Me with two separate audiences, and the reaction was quite different with each. One crowd was with the film every step of the way, knowing when to laugh and when to stop laughing. The other audiences seemed puzzled by the whole thing, almost as if it couldn’t see where anything was leading.\n\nThe latter reaction is understandable, because Choose Me is a comedy and a romance and a film noir and even a musical, all rolled up into one mysterious package. But getting to the heart of that mystery is an intoxicating journey. It’s true; you never know quite know where you stand with this movie, as though it were deliberately keeping you off balance. But if felt I was in capable hands throughout, and never for a moment feared that the film was heading for a fall.\n\nIt has the logic of a screwball comedy, in which strangers meet, sparks are kindled, and everyone becomes accidentally and inextricably involved with everyone else. Beneath the comic structure, Choose Me simmers with urgent passion, so that its laughs have meaning.\n\nThe film considers the various romantic entanglements of: Dr. Nancy Love (Geneviève Bujold), a radio psychologist who counsels her callers about love but doesn’t know much about the subject; Eve (Lesley Ann Warren), owner of a bar and one of Love’s frequent callers; Mickey (Keith Carradine), a habitual liar who walked into Eve’s bar looking for the previous owner but fell in love with the current proprietor; Pearl (Rae Dawn Chong), barside poet; and Zack Antoine (Patrick Bauchau), self-styled gangster, Pearl’s husband, and Eve’s lover.\n\nEach relationship builds on the other ones, in a grid of coincidence and cross-purpose. Orchestrating all this is writer-director Alan Rudolph, who is probably tired of being called a protégé of Robert Altman. But he was, and he’s since made Welcome to L.A., Remember My Name, Endangered Species, and others. Rudolph’s films have always taken chances, but this film takes even more. It also pays off on more.\n\nWith cinematographer Jan Kiesser, and with a very low budget, Rudolph has created a sensual look for the movie (and, with the Teddy Pendergrass songs, a very sexy sound, too). Much of the action takes place at night, and the characters resemble nighthawks on the prowl, scouring the lonely edges of Los Angeles for a little companionship.\n\nThe people are special, and the fact that they are played by misfits and almost-stars adds to this. Carradine, who was in Rudolph’s Welcome to L.A., continues to carve his own niche in the recent cinema, always seeming to turn up in small, personal projects. Warren, queen of the TV-movie in the early ’70s, rings true, even when saying things like, “I don’t own any man—and no man owns me,” one of the many lines that seem inspired by old movie dialogue.\n\nBujold, who doesn’t work all that often and never quite became the big star she could have been, is superb as the talk-show host. It’s easy to satirize this particular kind of pop figure, and the film does get funny material out of it, but there is much subtlety in Bujold’s performance. It’s a wonderful part, and Bujold, as the omnipresent goddess of the airwaves, becomes the glue that holds the many enticing aspects of this film together.\n\nFirst published in the Herald, August 24, 1984\n\nThis was kind of an important independent film, although it doesn’t get a lot of credit for that. It was a gigantic hit in Seattle, a city that has cozied up to Rudolph’s films in general (and he to Seattle, having shot Trouble in Mind here a couple of years later and keeping a house hereabouts). Choose Me has a real appreciation for people, without ever losing its odd, stylized snap."
