*** MARK ISHAM, “Afterglow: Music From the Motion Picture” Columbia

Much like its namesake, the Alan Rudolph-directed film, “Afterglow” is a moody, impulsive affair. Isham--who also scored Rudolph’s “The Moderns,” as well as Robert Redford’s “A River Runs Through It” and Jodie Foster’s “Nell” among others--has expanded the music he wrote for Rudolph’s cross-generational tale of two intertwined couples to make this 10-song collection.

He has collected a masterful cast: saxophonist Charles Lloyd, pianist Geri Allen, violinist Sid Page, vibist Gary Burton, bassist Jeff Littleton and drummer Billy Higgins, with Isham on trumpet--and he sets them off against one another in various entanglements, much like the characters in the film.

Lloyd’s tenor plays the most captivating role, and, indeed, the moods here often resemble those on the saxophonist’s own recordings. Lloyd sounds especially good against Allen’s intuitive accompaniment, and the disc gives an extended chance to appreciate Higgins’ stirring brush work. Isham and Page both add mournful touches.

But, again like the movie’s characters, the musicians sometimes stand apart rather than fall together. Only one number, “The Frenzy,” illustrates the movie’s emotional turmoil. All else is somber, thoughtful.
