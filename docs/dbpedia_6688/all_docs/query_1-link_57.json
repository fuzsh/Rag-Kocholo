        "text": "The summer movie season kicks off in theaters this month with “The Fall Guy,” “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” “Furiosa” and more big budget studio tentpoles. Streaming platforms are also going big with buzzy originals (from Prime Video’s “The Idea of You,” starring Anne Hathaway, to Netflix’s star-studded comedy “Unfrosted”) as well as some of the best movies of 2023 (Sean Durkin’s “The Iron Claw” and Michael Mann’s “Ferrari”) making their debuts on platforms such as Netflix, Max, Hulu and more.\n\nWhile certainly not classified under “best,” Sony’s comic book flop “Madame Web” is also making its streaming premiere this month on Netflix. Cast member Sydney Sweeney said after the film struggled to get to the $100 million mark worldwide that she accepted a role in the tentpole as a business decision to get her foot in the door at Sony, where she was able to make her box office hit “Anyone but You” (which is now streaming on Netflix).\n\n“To me, that film was a building block, it’s what allowed me to build a relationship with Sony,” Sweeney told GQ U.K. “Without doing ‘Madame Web’ I wouldn’t have a relationship with the decision-makers over there. Everything in my career I do not just for that story, but strategic business decisions. Because I did that, I was able to sell ‘Anyone but You.’ I was able to get ‘Barbarella.’”\n\n“Madame Web” became such so infamous on social media upon its theatrical release that it won’t be surprising to see the movie head to the top of the Netflix charts this months as curious viewers tune in to see what all the fuss was about. Check out a full rundown below of the biggest movies new to streaming in May."
