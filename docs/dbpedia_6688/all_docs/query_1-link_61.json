        "text": "Travis Kelce reportedly spoke to Taylor Swift for hours on the phone after Swift cancelled three of her Eras Tour stops amid terror threats from ISIS, even suggesting that he could leave Kansas City Chiefs training camp in order to be with her, according to sources close to the couple who spoke with The Sun. Swift cancelled her stops in the city after authorities arrested two suspects, aged 17 and 15, in connection with a terror plot masterminded by another 19-year-old ISIS sympathizer who wanted to “kill himself and a large number of people during the concert,” according to CNN. “Travis contacted Taylor very fast and talked with her for a while to show support and see how she was feeling with that tense situation,” a source close to the situation told the Sun. “You can tell that he was helping her feel better and made her laugh, to make this situation and the day she went through end up on a more fun note,” the source added. Kelce and Swift reportedly “did spend some long hours on the phone yesterday,” adding “he has one of his phones always right next to him when he goes to sleep in case she needs to talk to him.” Kelce also reportedly “suggested flying to Austria to be there for her if she wanted him to do so, even if it was for a day or two.”"
