        "text": "Active - 1930 - 1967 | Born - May 23, 1898 in Homestead, PA | Died - Sep 11, 1981 in Greenwich, CT | Genres - Comedy, Drama, Romance, Musical, Crime | Height: 5’ 7”\n\nAt age ten, Frank McHugh began performing in his parent’s stock company, side by side with his siblings Matt and Kitty. By age 17, McHugh was resident juvenile with the Marguerite Bryant stock company. Extensive vaudeville experience followed, and in 1925 McHugh made his first Broadway appearance in The Fall Guy; three years later, he made his movie debut in a Vitaphone short. Hired by Warner Bros. for the small role of a motorcycle driver in 1930’s The Dawn Patrol, McHugh appeared in nearly 70 Warners films over the next decade. With his nervous laugh and hangdog look, he appeared in over 90 movies in the first dozen years he worked at Warners.\n\nHe was often cast as the hero’s best pal or as drunken comedy relief; his peculiar trademark was a lightly braying laugh. Highlight performances during his Warners tenure included Jimmy Cagney’s pessimistic choreographer in Footlight Parade (1933), “rude mechanical” Quince in A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1935), an erstwhile poet and horserace handicapper in Three Men on a Horse (1936) and a friendly pickpocket in One Way Passage (1932) -- a role he’d repeat word-for-word in Till We Meet Again, 1940 remake of Passage. He continued showing up in character roles in such films as Going My Way (1944) and A Tiger Walks (1964) until the late 1960s. McHugh was also a regular on the 1960s TV series The Bing Crosby Show and F Troop.\n\nAvailable Films:\n\nTrivia:\n\nHe made 11 movies with his close friend James Cagney, more than any other actor. These were The Crowd Roars (1932), Footlight Parade (1933), Here Comes the Navy (1934), Devil Dogs of the Air (1935), The Irish in Us (1935), A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1935), Boy Meets Girl (1938), The Roaring Twenties (1939), The Fighting 69th (1940), City for Conquest (1940), A Lion Is in the Streets (1953).\n\nPlayed the same character (the petty thief running away from Chinese authorities) both in One Way Passage (1932) and its remake, 'Til We Meet Again (1940). The character was called Skippy in the first film and Rockhingham T. Rockingham in the second."
