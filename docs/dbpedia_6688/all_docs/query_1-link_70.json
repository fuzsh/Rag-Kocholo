        "text": "Bring the Drama is the new six-part series from BBC Arts and Wall to Wall Media for BBC Two and iPlayer opening up the world of screen drama to eight people who have always dreamt of becoming professional actors but have never had the opportunity.\n\nHosted by actor and comedian Bill Bailey, the eight aspiring actors are mentored over six weeks by renowned casting director Kelly Valentine Hendry, who has cast shows including Bridgerton, Gangs of London, Ghosts and Broadchurch. In each episode, the aspiring actors are welcomed onto some of the real-life sets from celebrated UK dramas such as Peaky Blinders, EastEnders and Silent Witness and tasked with working together to recreate iconic scenes with the real scripts, real cameras and the real time pressures that professional actors face. As they gain experience in different forms of screen acting they are given advice and guidance from a host of established actors including Natalie Cassidy (EastEnders); Genesis Lynea (Silent Witness, Champion); Charles Venn (Casualty, Dream Team); Ed Speleers (Downton Abbey, You) and Rochenda Sandall (Line of Duty, The Rig), as well as working with industry experts from the Peaky Blinders fight co-ordinator to the intimacy co-ordinator from Sex Education.\n\nAs the eight discover, the job of a screen actor is far from easy - and each production provides new challenges and opportunities for the actors to learn and find out whether they have the talent and skills needed to take the next step into the professional industry. At the end of the intense learning process, casting director Kelly selects three actors she feels are industry-ready to present their showreel at a major industry showcase for the chance to secure representation from a leading agent.\n\nAll eight actors secured their place in Bring The Drama through an open casting call process and were selected from almost 2000 amateur actors from across the UK. Chosen for their raw talent, none have been to drama school or found a way to break into acting professionally, having held back by a variety of factors and access issues.\n\nAs well as the direct guidance all eight receive in the series from industry professionals and specialist coaches, they also leave the process with a professionally shot showreel and follow up sessions with industry experts.\n\nIP\n\nBill Bailey Q&A\n\nTell us about Bring the Drama and what audiences can expect?\n\nBring the Drama follows the fortunes of eight amateur actors who have been selected from thousands, who have had no formal training or professional experience, and are given the opportunity to film famous scenes from some of our best loved tv shows. Each week, the actors have to audition for the main roles in these scenes, which are filmed with a full tv crew, and then they are edited and screened to the cast. Whoever has impressed top casting director Kelly Valentine Hendry, will be named Cast of the Week, and Actor of the Week, and eventually she will select just three actors who go through to a final showcase, and the chance to get a top agent, and pursue their screen career.\n\nWhat made you want to be involved in the series?\n\nI thought it was a great way to give some aspiring actors an amazing opportunity, and also, itâs a brilliant insight into the whole process of acting, filming and casting.\n\nWhat do you hope viewers will take away from the show?\n\nI think it will be great fun for viewers because theyâll be watching some of the most famous scenes in TV, reinterpreted by this raw and untested cast, directed and mentored by the stars of those shows.\n\nWhy do you think itâs important for the series to give these particular aspiring actors an opportunity?\n\nWell acting is a tough business, and it can often seem almost impossible to break into. All the actors on the show have faced their own challenges which have for various reasons prevented them from pursuing their dream. Theyâre a terrific bunch, all from different backgrounds and walks of life, theyâre all genuine, self-deprecating and grounded but theyâve all known that acting is what theyâve wanted to do, their whole livesâ¦ so itâs actually very heartening seeing them thrive on this show.\n\nAs someone who has been in the industry for a long time, what would your advice be to those starting their careers?\n\nI think you have to be determined, and resilient. Itâs a precarious profession, and thereâs often setbacks, and rejection. So, you have to be quite mentally tough, and be able to keep going. And being quite realistic and grounded about things helps.\n\nWhat was it like working alongside Kelly Valentine Hendry?\n\nIt was absolutely brilliant to work with Kelly â her insights into the casting process and the finer points of acting itself were fascinating. She has an unerring instinct for spotting a good performance and for challenging the actors to step out of their comfort zone, and her perception and honesty was invaluable for the entire cast.\n\nThe aspiring actors each week are coached by guest judges, what do you think they gained from the experience?\n\nI think it was real eye-opener for our actors. I donât think they were quite prepared for how hard the process is. The early starts, the short rehearsal time, the pressure of delivering a performance in front of a full crew was a really steep learning curve. But they responded brilliantly, and I think they all gained a huge amount from the experience.\n\nDid you see a difference in the aspiring actors from when filming began to when they finished?\n\nIt was wonderful to see the actors improve week by week. You could see them visibly gaining in confidence, and they all worked so well together, as one supportive ensemble. Whatever they do next, I think they have all gained a huge amount of knowledge about the business, which will stand them in great stead for whatever they do next.\n\nMeet the Professionals\n\nKelly Valentine Hendry - Casting Director\n\nTell us about Bring The Drama and what audiences can expect\n\nItâs not the same as some of the other big talent shows - we donât show you the huge selection process. We only focus on the group of people who we think have a shot at doing well. Hopefully the audience will enjoy watching people who are passionate about being actors get a taste of the profession in the real world. They will see how hard it is but equally how rewarding it is when you succeed. We arenât saying that drama school is not a great way of getting on the ladder - it is an excellent way to start. But many canât afford it and it is exciting to throw this experience out there to others.\n\nWhat made you want to be involved in the series?\n\nIt was really important to me that an authentic and fair process was put in place. The duty of care had to be at the forefront of this process and I wanted to be there to see that it was adhered to. I couldnât have been happier with it. I am very out of my comfort zone too - I have never been in front of the camera before and I learnt a lot which will definitely make me a better casting director. I pride myself on inclusion when I cast so I was very invested in this format.\n\nHow was it working with Bill Bailey and the guest mentors?\n\nThey say you should never meet your heroes â¦ in this case it couldnât be further from the truth. He is the perfect person to front the show because he has been there and experienced many of the pressures. He is one of the most talented, funny and generous human beings I have ever met. And it didnât stop there. The guest mentors, many of whom I have worked with before, were a dream. Our cast were very lucky to have worked with them all and I get the impression that they were also impressed with our actors too. They are all very talented and have had a huge amount of experience in our industry so their advice was golden.\n\nWhat do you hope viewers will take away from the show?\n\nI hope that the viewers get a parallel experience of watching what someone can achieve without professional training if they are given a chance but at the same time, how in reality being an actor requires a huge amount of skill, determination and hard work. You hear a lot of people saying âoh I could have done thatâ but the reality is something quite different. Also I think it is so much fun to see what goes on behind the scenes and then also watching our actors on set at some of our most popular shows. The biggest take away is for it to encourage someone to give our industry a shot with the understanding of how difficult it can be. Dream big but dream with realism.\n\nHow important do you think Bring The Drama is in highlighting barriers within the industry?\n\nWe all know already that there are barriers to many of the arts. They have historically been there for those that can afford it. Not only the schools and courses but the accommodation in the cities that offer them. Also you need help when you are not working to sustain and of course the mental health struggles that go alongside it all. We will follow 8 people who have a range of reasons why they didnât pursue their dreams and hopefully we will show that for some of them it prevented a very real career where they would be living their dream. Everyone deserves a shot at that.\n\nWhatâs the biggest difference you saw in the actors throughout the process?\n\nIt is a roller coaster because I donât get to see what they are really thinking behind the scenes. I saw an ebb and flow of confidence. They started with loads and then the process and rejection ate away at them and then they had to really dig deep to bring it back. That is the harsh reality of being an actor at any level. I loved seeing them watch themselves on screen and see themselves doing real scenes on real sets. I think it was quite emotional for all of us at times.\n\nWhat is it that you look for when casting for roles? Are there any particular traits or skills that you feel someone needs to possess?\n\nWhen I am casting I have quite a few variables going on. You have to find people who tick many, many boxes from the obvious ones like being the best actor technically, to hitting the algorithms that make it work for the network (who brings viewers) and then do they look like the family they are meant to be in, do they have the authenticity of the character.\n\nGemma Crooks - Acting Coach\n\nTell us about Bring The Drama and what audiences can expect?\n\nThe audience can expect to see a process of what is required of the actor when working on screen. It's a chance to start to understand the various elements that go into being a screen actor and how working in collaboration with others is a vital soft skill that artists need to consider.\n\nWhat made you want to be involved in the series?\n\nBeing able to go to drama school is a privilege and not everyone has access to actor training that leads to the opportunities to meet agents and casting directors. Having the opportunity to work with non-actors that would have otherwise found it extremely hard to get this opportunity to learn, grow and experience the world of screen acting was exciting to me, it felt like a win for all of them right from the start of the process.\n\nWhat do you hope viewers will take away from the show?\n\nI hope that viewers will take away a newfound understanding of the craft of acting and the collaborative effort it takes to create quality screen content. It's the hard work that actors, acting coaches, casting agents, directors, writers, producers, director of photography, runners, and catering do every day to bring stories to the screen so the audience can enjoy a moment of escape. There is a process that happens behind the screen that we don't often get to see. I hope the audience get to witness the hard work that goes on and how important it is to support the arts. Everyone has their part to play, and we wouldn't have wonderful shows without them all.\n\nHow important do you think Bring The Drama is in highlighting barriers within the industry?\n\nBring The Drama is a reminder that we need to move towards an industry that is active in the pursuit of inclusivity. Barriers do exist in the industry, we must acknowledge this. We want actors to have agency, but if there are procedures and biases that don't consider all people, then we won't move forward in what stories we tell, how we tell stories and who creates them. We have to be active in our change and be responsive to what's causing the barriers and be bold enough to break them.\n\nWhat was it like working with Kelly Valentine Hendry and Bill Bailey?\n\nWorking with Kelly and Bill felt effortless, and this is because they both understand what being a collaborator is. The process felt like building an ensemble to do a job that honours the craft of acting. Bill was fantastic in his care for the contributors throughout the process and Kelly is very knowledgeable. She offered so much insight and was very generous with her advice to the contributors. Both were super supportive throughout the process. It was a great team.\n\nWhatâs the biggest difference you saw in the actors throughout the process?\n\nThe biggest difference I saw in the contributors over the duration of the show was how much they started to consider themselves as actors. They started to gain more confidence and discover their own process when approaching a new piece of text.\n\nMeet the Actors\n\nChris Flynn\n\n23, Warrington\n\nTell us about Bring The Drama and what audiences can expect?\n\nBring The Drama is about aspiring actors who have struggled to get into professional acting and want to know how to breakthrough. Audiences might think it will be easy, you just learn your lines and thatâs it but itâs really not. Itâs one of the most difficult jobs. Youâve got long hours, you have to learn lines and the movement involved, and especially for me being deaf, Iâm having to sign and have dialogue with people, and learn movement but itâs very exciting and encouraging to watch.\n\nWhy did you apply for the show?\n\nI used to think thereâs no way I can be an actor but my older sister tried to influence me to get into it. We both did a self tape to her director over zoom and he asked âwhoâs this ladâ, and she told him that I was her younger brother and he said âhe can actâ and encouraged me to apply for the Royal Exchange Theatre. At the start I was really nervous because Iâve never done anything like it before but I really enjoyed it and started to fall more in love with acting and then this opportunity came up and so I decided to apply.\n\nTell us about your background in acting and what had led you to this point?\n\nFrom the age of 18 to 21 I went to the Royal Exchange Theatre and loved it. I did two big performance shows there and we had an amazing team. Then I went to the Storyhouse for a year, which really challenged me in a good way, having to stand on stage and learn lines, itâs really challenging but it was a privilege to do it.\n\nWhat do you feel has held you back from fulfilling your dream?\n\nSo I wasn't very good at school because I'm deaf and have learning difficulties and wasnât given enough support. Going to college changed my life though as they gave me the support I needed and access to sign language interpreters and I grew from there. Then going to Royal Exchange Theatre and Storyhouse, I finally found my dream.\n\nWhat was your experience like filming the series?\n\nIt was one the best six weeks of my life. It was such a cool experience meeting all the people involved, weâd never done it before and so it was a dream to a part of it.\n\nWhat was it like working with Bill Bailey?\n\nHeâs such a nice guy, very funny and hilarious. It was like being part of a family, he wanted to make sure that everybodyâs ok and we had lots of conversations and we spoke about being deaf and sign language which was cool.\n\nAnd how was it working with the rest of the team including Kelly, Gemma and the guest mentors?\n\nKelly is an incredible woman. Sheâs also really into sports and a fellow Manchester United fan so we really got on.\n\nGemma was really interesting too because sheâs a drama school teacher and so is trying to get you to be a better actor and she really helped me with understanding the script, what the words mean and helping me connect to them.\n\nThe guest mentors are incredible professionals, they are of such a high level of standard having done so many shows, they were teaching us how to say the words and lines, such an amazing learning experience.\n\nWhat has been your biggest key takeaway from the show?\n\nBeing on the set of Peaky Blinders and being taught stunts and movement. I learnt so much from it, it was the best day of my life being on the set of one of my favourite shows.\n\nWhat would be your dream role?\n\nMy dream role would be in Ted Lasso because I love football, so why not become the first deaf professional in the premier league. That would be cool.\n\nIs there anyone in the industry that you admire and look up to?\n\nChristopher Nolan, heâs an amazing, incredible mastermind. Heâs done so many action films which I like.\n\nDo you have any stand out moments from filming?\n\nDefinitely being on the set of Peaky Blinders! Itâs my favourite programme and so it was a dream come true to act on the set.\n\nDelasi Zikpi\n\n27, West London\n\nTell us about Bring The Drama and what audiences can expect?\n\nBring The Drama is a rollercoaster of emotions that demonstrate the power of what people can achieve when pursuing their dreams and passions! 8 actors with varying degrees of experience are given a crash course into the lives of working actors! Audiences can expect to see a journey (for me) from a novice to a much more confident and knowledgeable actor. The show has a very warm feel due to the way we really bonded as a cast. The limitless love and support given to each other was amazing and I'm incredibly grateful to have shared the experience with such a brilliant, talented cast.\n\nWhy did you apply for the show?\n\nI applied for the show because I felt it was time to put myself out there and take every opportunity that was presented to me. This seemed like the perfect opportunity to showcase my natural talent whilst gaining more skills and education to make the next steps to become a professional actor!\n\nTell us about your background in acting and what had led you to this point?\n\nMy background in acting started from school, I used to absolutely love doing drama in school and even took it for both GCSE & A Level where my performances were graded really high! I love performing!\n\nWhat do you feel has held you back from fulfilling your dream?\n\nI feel the reasons for me not being able to fulfill my dream of becoming a high-level actor are multifaceted. The first of which comes from a lack of understanding how exactly I would pursue this dream, I had no idea how to get an agent, and how to get my foot into the professional industry. The second main holdback for me was finances, it's extremely expensive to pay for high-quality showreels, headshots etc.\n\nWhat was your experience like filming the series?\n\nFor me, filming the serious scenes was really enlightening. I feel that I learnt so much about myself as an actor and a person. I definitely don't think I started strong at all! But as the weeks went by, I learnt more about the power of becoming more comfortable within myself and how that manifested itself in my acting. Also gaining the education of being on live sets, doing long days, having to learn scripts so quickly, all gave me a glimpse into just what it takes to be a professional actor....and as gruelling and difficult as it can be......I'D DO IT FOREVER!\n\nI was so blessed to work with such a fantastic cast and crew who supported me throughout and helped me gain more confidence as the show progressed. I found a new family that I'm proud to be a part of!\n\nWhat was it like working with Bill Bailey?\n\nWorking with Bill was amazing! He's so genuinely, effortlessly funny and made the set so lively! What I also loved about Bill was his willingness to get involved and be one of us! I also really appreciated the feedback he'd give to me as it gave me a lot of confidence.\n\nAnd how was it working with the rest of the team including Kelly, Gemma and the guest mentors?\n\nWorking with Kelly was amazing! I really appreciated her honesty. You could tell that whenever she gave feedback it was with the intention to help us improve. She used her experience to teach us so, so much and I think it really helped change my trajectory during the show.\n\nWorking with Gemma was so fun and empowering, she taught us so much in the masterclasses, real tangible skills that we were able to take to set. I also feel that Gemma's advice was so vital to my personal progression on the show. She's so knowledgeable and was able to help me break through barriers I'd faced early on. I'm so extremely grateful to her and would love the opportunity to work with her again!\n\nWorking with the guest mentors didn't feel real at times. Seeing legends like Natalie Cassidy had me starstruck throughout! They were all so supportive and gave such useful feedback that I was able to incorporate in real time. I particularly loved working with Charles Venn & Ed Speleers who gave me such memorable moments....one in particular when Ed said \"you're trying to work me out of a job\"! I couldn't believe it! So grateful to them all for taking the time out to join our journey.\n\nWhat has been your biggest key takeaway from the show?\n\nMy biggest take away would be - to be yourself. That's the best way to make acting authentic, finding parts of you that can be related to the story or character and using them to bring your performance to life. Another big takeaway is that despite how gruelling, tiring, scary, the process was at times, I'd do it again and again, I WILL do it forever because I loved every single bit of it!\n\nWhat would be your dream role?\n\nMy dream role is to be cast as Black Panther! I absolutely love Marvel and loved Chadwick's portrayal of T\"Challa and hope that I would be able to do the role justice! Now I need to get on the radar of Sarah Finn. Hopefully this is the first step!\n\nIs there anyone in the industry that you admire and look up to?\n\nMy favourite actors are Denzel Washington, and Leonardo DiCaprio, I think they're the best to ever do it! I also take great inspiration from people such as Letitia Wright, Daniel Kaluuya, Damson Idris and John Boyega who I believed have all paved a way for the newest crop of young Black British Actors.\n\nDo you have any stand out moments from filming?\n\nI would love to thank everyone involved, from the amazing cast, fantastic crew and the amazing guest directors too!\n\nGeorge Heron\n\n62, County Durham\n\nTell us about Bring The Drama and what audiences can expect?\n\nViewers of the show will share our experience of being thrust into drama school level workshops that then prepare us before being thrust on set on some of the biggest shows on TV. The viewer will get to see how auditions are conducted and how the casting director drove us to dig deeper. They will also get to see us working alongside the cast and team of the shows that they are so familiar with. I guess many will be thrilled to see us have this opportunity and want the same for themselves if the opportunity came around with another series.\n\nWhy did you apply for the show?\n\nI applied to the show because I wanted to show my skills and prove to myself that I have it in me to be an actor; something that I have always believed I had but never had the opportunity to explore or demonstrate.\n\nTell us about your background in acting and what had led you to this point?\n\nI was in the Royal Navy and back in 1979 I appeared on stage in a âgang showâ style cabaret. I loved the experience of being on stage but thatâs where it ended, that was until I retired after 25 years as a Police Officer and in 2019 I decided to go to an acting workshop where the âbugâ hit again and I loved the buzz of it all. When I saw the Bring The Drama advert, I knew this was my big chance.\n\nWhat do you feel has held you back from fulfilling your dream?\n\nI guess life got in the way, I was in the Royal Navy, then joined the police force working long hours so doing âotherâ stuff was never an option. Of course, I was getting on in years too so my age played a part, I mean, I never thought that anyone would hire a 50+ greying man with no experience. After the workshops I looked around for training courses here in the North East. Alas there were no adult training opportunities within 100 miles so that too held me back; and then came Bring The Drama.\n\nWhat was your experience like filming the series?\n\nFilming the series was hard work but revealing and exciting. Being on set for long periods made me realise that acting is not the glamourous job that people think, itâs hard work, yet very rewarding at the same time. I loved the whole experience; I never thought that at 61 I would get such a chance so when it came along, I grabbed it with both hands and held on tight for what was indeed an experience that I will never forget & forever be grateful for.\n\nWhat was it like working with Bill Bailey?\n\nBill Bailey was amazing to work with. He was engaging, helpful and I think I can now call him a âmate of mineâ, he even asked if I wanted to come see his new tour. A great man that took time to listen to us and was genuinely interested in me and my career story.\n\nAnd how was it working with the rest of the team including Kelly, Gemma and the guest mentors?\n\nI never thought that I would ever get the opportunity to work with people like Kelly, Gemma, and professional mentors that would teach me so much. I mean, an intimacy coach, dance coach and fight coach; nowhere else would such opportunities be found under the same umbrella so to speak, so this was an amazing experience and I learned more than I ever expected.\n\nWhat has been your biggest key takeaway from the show?\n\nI think my biggest take from the show was that I can do this; I can be an actor. I learned about myself too. Being an officer for so long left me with a âwallâ behind which I was expected to be a certain person. I learned that such walls get in the way & often hold you back so over the 6 weeks of filming and with the help of Gemma and others, I learned to pull the wall down and open up more.\n\nWhat would be your dream role?\n\nI donât really have a dream role. Of course, you might be forgiven for thinking that I would make a great TV cop, and yes, maybe I would but I think a more down to earth, gritty man on the street role, the working man trying hard to make ends meet type of role would be something that I would love to try.\n\nIs there anyone in the industry that you admire and look up to?\n\nI really do admire the work of Stephen Graham. A gritty northern actor who is so versatile and believable in everything he is cast in. I also admire Sheridan Smith, another very believable and honest actor who has such a range, from comedy to drama and she can even knock out a good tune too. I think Sarah Lancashire played a stunning role in Happy Valley and I admire her for what was a very honest and believable police role from her.\n\nDo you have any stand out moments from filming?\n\nFor me the outstanding moment was episode 5: Downton Abbey. I loved the other scenes, some more than others; Casualty for instance was, in my mind, a bit of a âcar crash momentâ, but Downton was âthe oneâ. I loved the costume, the feeling of it all, the dance, the music, the grandeur of that one moment in time. That for me was the acting that I had waited so long to experience.\n\nJanice Sampson\n\n67, Sheffield\n\nTell us about Bring The Drama and what audiences can expect?\n\nI think audiences can expect to follow 8 people on a journey of self-discovery, as they face the trials and tribulations of working in television.\n\nWhy did you apply for the show?\n\nAt first, I wasn't going to apply because I believed I would be too old, but then I thought, bugger it, I'm going to give it a go.\n\nTell us about your background in acting and what had led you to this point?\n\nMy background in acting came about through writing. I joined a writing for film and TV class and at the end of each session we were cast in something one of us had written. At first I was mortified, then a few classes in I started to enjoy it and was getting picked often. From there we went to an âacting on filmâ class where I learned to walk into a room without looking at the camera - never learned how to walk out of one! Whilst taking part, a fellow attendee asked if I would like to join their amateur dramatic group, which I did and since then I have formed a theatre company and professionally staged plays that I have written. I joined Sheffield Peoples Theatre and appeared in many of their productions, mostly amateur but some have been paid. In short I have written a lot and performed in stage plays, radio plays and two student films\n\nWhat do you feel has held you back from fulfilling your dream?\n\nWhat held me back when I started the journey into both writing and acting was that I had responsibilities, children, bills to pay and a job.\n\nWhat was your experience like filming the series?\n\nFilming the series was brilliant. A massive learning curve, so many memories and a bunch of truly wonderful people to experience it with\n\nWhat was it like working with Bill Bailey?\n\nBill was an absolute joy, down to earth, funny, knowledgeable. An all round treat\n\nAnd how was it working with the rest of the team including Kelly, Gemma and the guest mentors?\n\nAll the crew became our friends, we loved them and had many a laugh. Kelly was focused, we also had lighter moments but she was the one we had to impress. Gemma gave us so much help and advice, she was like our sister.\n\nWhat has been your biggest key takeaway from the show?\n\nThe biggest thing that I have taken from the show is that my age is no barrier, I just need to relax, not put too much pressure on myself which I felt I did sometimes on the show.\n\nWhat would be your dream role?\n\nI also have many dream roles. I would love to be in Doctor Who, or on a soap, a comedy, a crime drama or even on Loose Women. In fact, there isn't much I would discount.\n\nIs there anyone in the industry that you admire and look up to?\n\nI think Sarah Lancashire is ace, and so is Joanna Lumley. I admire so many male and female actors that I would be here all day.\n\nDo you have any stand out moments from filming?\n\nNot so much a stand out moment but definitely the thing that took me by surprise was how long it all takes, hours and hours and hours. You quickly develop respect for all involved in the process.\n\nJordan Skelly\n\n27, Manchester\n\nTell us about Bring The Drama and what audiences can expect?\n\nBring the Drama is the first of its kind and unique, combining reality with televised drama. People can expect a deeper understanding of the acting world, a whole cohort of incredible actors all learning about themselves and seeing behind the scenes of the biggest dramas on the BBC\n\nWhy did you apply for the show?\n\nI was scouted for the show by a northern consultant who had seen me perform my poetry at theatres around Manchester.\n\nTell us about your background in acting and what had led you to this point?\n\nI wouldnât call myself an actor, Iâm more of a storyteller. My main art form is poetry, however I make multi-disciplinary theatre, and acting is another element of my desire to share stories with the world. I love live performance, most of my work is generally performed in a live capacity but Bring The Drama has opened the doors of TV and thatâs a very exciting avenue to explore.\n\nWhat do you feel has held you back from fulfilling your dream?\n\nThereâs been a few factors that have limited me in becoming a full-time artist. As a working-class person, financial boundaries have got in the way, being unable to pay for drama school, sacrificing travel, relationships and stability to focus on sharing stories. I also suffer from poor mental health at times which can really limit your confidence.\n\nWhat was your experience like filming the series?\n\nFilming the series was genuinely life changing thereâs no other way to put it, meeting people like Bill Bailey and Kelly Valentine Hendry was surreal and always having something new to play with was so rewarding, and it was validating to know that we were seen by the right people and given a chance to shine.\n\nWhat was it like working with Bill Bailey?\n\nBill Bailey was wonderful to work with, obviously his humour is very quick, so he always had us laughing but heâs also very warm. In between masterclasses and on set he was always very approachable and had great words of encouragement.\n\nAnd how was it working with the rest of the team including Kelly, Gemma and the guest mentors?\n\nAuditioning for Kelly was such an incredible opportunity, getting direction and notes from someone at the top of their field has given me huge confidence. If you can audition for Kelly you can audition for everyone, but she was also genuinely invested in us doing the best we could. Gemma was a lifeline, offering practicable skills and support throughout, even arranging one to ones with us to support us even further. Working with Gemma who has worked at the top drama schools in the country helped to bridge the gap between the wider acting world and our experience. The guest mentors were phenomenal, it was a great experience to meet these wonderful actors and work with them on the shows they helped to create, often in scenes they shot which was incredible. Jason White our fight coordinator was wonderful too and very forthcoming and open but full of amazing stories from his career.\n\nWhat has been your biggest key takeaway from the show?\n\nThereâs been a few takeaways from this show, firstly the ones who make it are the ones who donât give up. Acting is about resilience and complete belief in yourself. Iâve learned various ways to access stories and character and learned key skills for working on a set. Iâve also learned a lot about myself, who I am, what Iâm capable of and what kind of storyteller I am.\n\nWhat would be your dream role?\n\nA dream role or the kind of work Iâd like to make would be something real and gritty. Something in the vein of Life, the BBC drama about the prison system or Shane Meadows This Is England. We joked on set that I could play a young Thomas Shelby during the war which would be very cool.\n\nIs there anyone in the industry that you admire and look up to?\n\nThere are a few people in the industry that I think are incredible. Phoebe Waller Bridge and what she did with Fleabag from stage to screen I think is amazing. Michaela Coel and the tone of her work I think is another incredible standard to hit. I love actors like Stephen Graham, Andrew Scott, Joe Gilgun, David Tennant and Jodie Comer.\n\nDo you have any stand out moments from filming?\n\nStand out moments from filming, well week one was a great week for me watching back that scene and seeing myself act for the first time was amazing. Being on set for Peaky Blinders was an experience Iâll never forget, everything from costume to the set was perfect and I felt like I lost myself in that role. Also when the cast and crew allowed us to experiment with the gender of characters it was very affirming.\n\nLizzie Alabi\n\n26, London\n\nTell us about Bring The Drama and what audiences can expect?\n\nBring The Drama gives opportunities for people from all walks of life a chance to pursue an acting career despite all the barriers. It gives an opportunity to learn more about the industry, meet other like-minded people and meet some amazing industry professionals. You can expect to see laughter, tears, hard work and a whole lot of fun from all involved. There are so many surprises from the guest mentors, the amazing set locations and beautiful costumes we all wear.\n\nWhy did you apply for the show?\n\nI wanted a chance to explore my creativity through acting as I hadnât seen a lot of opportunities that catered to me. I wanted to learn more about on screen acting and meet other people on similar journeys. I applied for this show because it gives people like me an opportunity to be part of something bigger. Itâs so inclusive for all people.\n\nTell us about your background in acting and what had led you to this point?\n\nI have always loved acting and in secondary school, I made sure I was in all the productions we had but I didnât know acting as career was an option for me. As I got older I took acting classes here and there on the side as I was working in a 9-5 job. I have done a few theatre productions and realised I love the craft so much that I wanted to pursue it as a career. I met other creatives who helped me build a community and wanted the same things I did, a career in acting and here we are.\n\nWhat do you feel has held you back from fulfilling your dream?\n\nA lack of opportunities around me. I didnât know anyone who pursued acting when I was growing up. It wasn't something that was encouraged. My upbringing was not one where acting was even an option because we focused on the traditional subjects in school. I didnât know about drama schools or how to even go about auditioning for one. I also did not have the resources to fund my acting career.\n\nWhat was your experience like filming the series?\n\nIt was wonderful to meet and work with all the other contributors. That made it less daunting because you werenât alone. Filming was tough because the days were long and there was so much to do, but doing what you love makes it all the more enjoyable. I realised there's a lot that goes into being an actor, it's hard work. Most people watching will never know how tedious it can be to film but I enjoyed my experience and would do it all again with the same cast and crew. Playing different characters each week was so much fun but also a challenge because you would get so into the scene and then have to leave it for the next one and learn new lines. The process was just as enjoyable as the end product.\n\nWhat was it like working with Bill Bailey?\n\nBill Bailey is a legend. We couldnât believe when he walked into the room. I was gob smacked. I had gone from seeing him on my screen to him knowing my name standing in front of me. I couldnât believe it but Bill is one of the nicest people ever. He was so funny and so supportive to every one of us. He joined in where he could and affirmed us positively throughout the process.\n\nAnd how was it working with the rest of the team including Kelly, Gemma and the guest mentors?\n\nI still canât believe we met and worked with such amazing individuals. Kelly was incredible. She was so humble and so supportive. She gave some of the best advice that I will be using forever in my career. So professional and genuinely wanted to see all of us do well.\n\nGemma was amazing. Iâm yet to see a better teacher and mentor than her. Super supportive and helpful. Every class was taught with intention and she never made me feel stupid or question why I was there. She impacted my life for the better with all her advice and techniques that she showed me.\n\nThe guest mentors were wonderful. They each brought a different approach to getting into character or a scene which was helpful to me because I learnt different ways to approach honest emotions, placement, and being present in the scenes whilst being part of a team. They were all so kind and willing to help us when we felt nervous on set.\n\nWhat has been your biggest key takeaway from the show?\n\nBelieve in yourself more and never give up, you are enough to pursue your dreams. Enjoy the process!\n\nWhat would be your dream role?\n\nTough one, Iâm not sure but a role that has a positive impact on the people watching.\n\nIs there anyone in the industry that you admire and look up to?\n\nThereâs so many but in particular would be Lashana Lynch and Daniel Kaluuya\n\nDo you have any stand out moments from filming?\n\nI remember going on the EastEnders set and seeing the Queen Vic pub for the first time. When we were filming, I just couldnât believe it was there. Another one was going to Birmingham for Peaky Blinders to learn how to fight safely with Jason, that was unbelievable. I still remember the scenes that took place there. The beautiful moments of filming Downton Abbey in the amazing costumes.\n\nLuca Gittens\n\n24, Runcorn (lives in London)\n\nTell us about Bring The Drama and what audiences can expect?\n\nBring The Drama is a family show for all audiences with such a warm feeling. Itâs given individuals, like myself, who have a strong passion and love for acting, a genuine taste of what it's like working in the industryâfrom auditioning and being cast to working on real sets with professional television crews and experienced actors. The show offers the audience a real insight into how challenging the industry can be and on top of that, it has highlighted challenges that people like myself and the rest of the cast have faced when trying to break into the industry, whether that be financial hardships or accessibility needs.\n\nWhy did you apply for the show?\n\nThe day I came across the ad for the show applications was the day I decided I could no longer attend Drama School in New York. I have always dreamt of having a career in onscreen British dramas and have been an avid watcher over the years. It almost felt like I had to apply. Having never been to Drama School, I knew that what I would learn from the masterclasses, auditions, to onset experience would be invaluable â like a crash course in the industry. I truly believe that when one door closes, another door opens, and you will always end up where you're meant to be with hard work and courage.\n\nTell us about your background in acting and what had led you to this point?\n\nComing from a very creative family, my parents enrolled me in acting, singing and dance classes from a very early age. It was at 6 years old, being cast as Nancy from Oliver Twist, performed at a local theatre, that I knew I wanted to be an actor. From then on, I studied drama throughout high school and college, and I was cast as Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz in a school play. With no ties to the industry, I felt quite naive about what it took to break in and the necessary steps. So, I decided to study Film Production at University to make connections and understand the technicalities of filmmaking, as well as how to collaborate closely with a director.\n\nAfter completing my degree in Film, I was offered a scholarship at NYCDA.\n\nWhat do you feel has held you back from fulfilling your dream?\n\nGrowing up, my family wasn't financially well-off. My dad raised me as a single father because my mum struggled with her mental health over the years. She was a significant part of my life, but my dad was my main caregiver. Coming from a small town with limited opportunities, traveling to auditions in big cities like London was financially challenging. Although my parents were always supportive and encouraging to the best of their abilities, we had little understanding of getting an agent and finding work until I was older. When I felt I had a real shot after getting into Drama School, my mum unexpectedly passed away from pneumonia, so I didn't feel ready to move away so soon and we couldn't raise enough funds for the living expenses during the training.\n\nWhat was your experience like filming the series?\n\nIt felt like a complete dream come true, and at every moment, I was just so grateful for the opportunity. Each week, I could see real growth as I was learning new things about myself and my craft. At times, it was challengingâlearning scripts and preparing for roles with such short notice. We were really thrown into the deep end, but by the end of week 5, I felt we were all beginning to learn how to swim.\n\nWhat was it like working with Bill Bailey?\n\nHe is exactly the same on/off camera! A complete joy to be around and always had a way of making you feel completely at easeâ¦ and, of course, laugh, like all the time! He was always getting involved in our masterclasses, which just added so much fun. If Bill was making a fool of himself, you felt like you could too.\n\nAnd how was it working with the rest of the team including Kelly, Gemma and the guest mentors?\n\nKelly is such a strong, admirable woman. I mean, she really is the real deal in the industry. Yet, you really get the sense that she completely cares about us and what this show means to us and to other people who havenât had the easiest start. We would always say at the end of each casting, 'Gosh, Kelly is really good at what she does,' because the roles just seemed so spot on each time, along with her feedback. Gemma was my rock during filming. She gave us all the confidence to be more playful with our work and helped us find what each of us had that was unique to offer. Working with the guest mentors was one of the most beneficial parts of the process, being able to see firsthand how experienced actors break down a script and implement it on set.\n\nWhat has been your biggest key takeaway from the show?\n\nI learned from Gemma to play and go with my impulses! Donât overwork a text with every action. Prepare well enough, but then leave it at the door. Go on set and let the magic happen. And also, my amazing cast, mentors, and crew, who I just adore. Iâve now made some incredible friends for life!\n\nWhat would be your dream role?\n\nThe character of Marianne Sheridan from BBCâs Normal People, played by Daisy Edgar Jones is a dream role for me at this stage of my life. Sheâs such a bold, strong female character with a lot of nuances and layers. Iâve always loved romance as a genre and enjoy delving into complex emotions. From an actor's perspective, it has everything in it to challenge you.\n\nIs there anyone in the industry that you admire and look up to?\n\nJodie Comer is an actor I really admire because sheâs had to work twice as hard for her success, coming from a working-class background. I see a lot of similarities in our backgrounds, and she is from Liverpool, which is really close to my hometown. Her versatility as an actor is mind-blowing, from portraying Villanelle in BBCâs Killing Eve to playing Kathy, a Chicago wife of a reckless bike rider in Jeff Nicholsâ The Bikeriders. Sheâs proof that with hard work and determination, you can succeed at what you put your mind to.\n\nDo you have any stand out moments from filming?\n\nA moment I wonât forget is when Charlene McKenna, one of the guest mentors, gave feedback that she felt working with me was like working with one of her peers. Just starting out in the industry, being professional and great to work with is so important to me, so I donât think feedback can get any better than that. I was on cloud nine!\n\nRehanna Bernard\n\n47, West London\n\nTell us about Bring The Drama and what audiences can expect?\n\nBring The Drama is an amazing show that really highlights some of the challenges we face entering the industry and an insight into the hard work actors put into their craft.\n\nWhy did you apply for the show?\n\nI applied for the show as I thought it was a unique opportunity to gain insight to an industry that I had little access to.\n\nTell us about your background in acting and what had led you to this point?\n\nWhen I was in my 20s, I was in a small church drama group and loved performing in our skits and plays. For 20 years, I put that âhobbyâ aside and focused on travelling and careers helping other people. Following a near death experience and loss of my eyesight followed by losing my job and a worldwide pandemic. I rediscovered my love for acting and decided to pursue it as a career but wasnât sure how. When I saw an advert for the show, it felt like an answered prayer!\n\nWhat do you feel has held you back from fulfilling your dream?\n\nI feel a number of things held me back initially. I had never seen a visually impaired actor and I didnât know if it was even possible to act professionally with a visual impairment. I also felt it might be too late and that I might be too old to start following this career path. Lastly, I just didnât know where to start. I tried one itâs a mess at an online drama school, which didnât really work for me, and I knew getting an agent was important, but I didnât have a showreel! I was at a loss of what to do next to follow my dream career.\n\nWhat was your experience like filming the series?\n\nFilming this series was surreal! The highlight for me was meeting the other seven incredible actors who have now become my âBring The Drama familyâ. It was definitely an intense experience, but also it was an absolute privilege to take part and work on so many iconic British dramas!\n\nWhat was it like working with Bill Bailey?\n\nBill is absolutely hilarious! Heâs also very down to earth and he added great energy to the experience.\n\nAnd how was it working with the rest of the team including Kelly, Gemma and the guest mentors?\n\nWorking with Kelly was an honour. She kept things very real with us regarding how the industry actually works, which I really appreciated. She certainly knows how to do her job as I found myself always agreeing with her casting decisions which gave me a lot of respect for the work she does. Gemma was an absolute angel! I learnt so much from her and took away really useful skills from the workshops she did with us. I will definitely continue to use them in my acting career. It was amazing meeting all of the guest mentors, and receiving feedback from them was so helpful and gave me a great boost of confidence.\n\nWhat has been your biggest key takeaway from the show?\n\nMy biggest key takeaway from the show is that it is possible to have an acting career with a visual impairment. It just takes a few adjustments, openness from the industry and understanding from fellow actors and anything is possible.\n\nWhat would be your dream role?\n\nI have always dreamed of being cast in Bridgerton (like the rest of the acting world!) and of course that would be a dream. However, what this show taught me is that there are many roles I would never have considered that Iâd be eager to try now. My dream role is one where I can fully showcase my acting skills, not focus on my disability and be authentically me.\n\nIs there anyone in the industry that you admire and look up to?\n\nAs cliche as it may sound, I have a lot of admiration for the likes of Denzel Washington and Viola Davis for their passion and believability in every role they play. I also admire and respect Michaela Coel and Issa Rae for writing and performing in their own work and doing it incredibly well. Thatâs definitely something I would like to do in the future.\n\nDo you have any stand out moments from filming?\n\nA standout moment from filming for me was the moment I realised how amazing my fellow actors were in helping me to shine! I donât want to give too much away, but every one of them played an amazing part in my own personal journey on the show, and I canât wait for the world to see it."
