        "text": "With all these 100 degree days and brutal heat, I think most of us are officially done with summer. Well, while fall temps haven't moved into the area yet, one fall staple is up and running: Spirit Halloween.\n\nWhether you want to get an early jump on your costume, just do some window shopping or get into the spooky spirit, several area Spirit Halloween stores are officially open in North Louisiana & East Texas.\n\nWhere Will Spirit Stores be Located in Shreveport, Monroe & East Texas?\n\nI guess if there's one 'downside' to Spirit Halloween is that they are rarely in the same locations 2 years in a row. Most are only open a few months out of the year and move into different retail locations every year, depending on what properties are available and other factors.\n\nThe good news is that Spirit is pretty good about keeping customers updated on where stores are and when they'll open.\n\nAccording to the Spirit website, here's where stores are located and when they'll be opening. Note that some locations are marked 'Opens August' without a specific date, so there's not a clear date or time on when these locations will be up and running."
