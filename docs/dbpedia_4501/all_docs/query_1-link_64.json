It has grown into a much more serious concern. Let’s\n\nhave a look at these four.\n\nI started off with Marcus Maeder, one of the main artists on the label, and whom I’d say is\n\nthe boss (but no doubt he isn’t), whose ‘Non-Human’ “deals with the presentation of imaginary\n\nobjects and processes through music. Music as a time-based art can describe objects and make\n\nthem come alive in a completely different way than can be done using images. On non-human,\n\nobjects that elude human perception or that are beyond conventional descriptiveness find their\n\nmusical expression: dormant entities, the reality of a star, the phase space, etc. find a form of\n\npresentation and experience in which it is attempted to realise artistically/musically that which\n\neither exists only as a theoretical concept or can be described verbally only in a very abstract way;\n\nthe musically translated terms on non-human come from the realm of physics, cosmology and\n\nspeculative realism”. Sorry for the long quote, but it is perhaps an example of the serious; almost\n\nphilosophical approach Maeder has these days. The ten pieces on ‘Non-Human’ are relatively short,\n\nmostly between three and four minutes, which a few exceptions, and throughout the music is very\n\nquiet, sometimes even below the threshold of hearing. I have no idea how it works with space and\n\nobjects, but I could very well believe this has something to do with sound bouncing around in\n\nspaces and resonances/reflections being picked up and treated again. I was thinking along all the\n\nlines of a do-it-yourself package, in which the listener actively engages himself in tweaking volume\n\nand equalisation to get his own individual piece out of it. As I ripped a piece for the weekly podcast\n\nI noticed, when I normalized (making the loudest sound bit 0db) a wealth of sound information that\n\nI didn’t hear when I played the CD. As it is now, on CD, it is all quite a radical listening experience.\n\nMusicwise I was reminded of the work of Asmus Tietchens.\n\nMartin Neukom’s CD is twice as long, and clocks in at almost eighty minutes and it has fifteen\n\nstudies, using “eight van der Pol oscillators are arranged in a circle. Each of these oscillators has\n\nvariable parameters frequency, nonlinearity and a gain and is coupled with his neighbours by variable\n\ncoupling factors and delay times in both directions”; Wikipedia tells me “in dynamics, the Van der\n\nPol oscillator is a non-conservative oscillator with non-linear damping”, plus a lot more which goes\n\nway over my head, as much, actually, as the rest of Neukon’s description. It all has to do with the\n\ninteraction between these oscillators, responding (or not) to each other, if I understand correctly.\n\nIt is perhaps also based on how the music sounds. The music is pretty much audible and indeed in\n\nthese fifteen pieces one hears the oscillations working overtime, bouncing around and along and\n\nagainst each other. All of this sounds like an investigation in pure tones; there is no ornament, no\n\nprocessing to sweeten things, or additionally colour but things are as they are, even when there is\n\nplenty of variation in these pieces. Not inside a single piece, as once the ball is rolling it very much\n\nstays the way it in, even though sounds may slow down or speed up a bit. Sometimes all of this is\n\nchirping high, or very low, or a combination of this, sometimes being steady waves or broken up\n\ntones. Neukom’s music is also a radical listening experience, but it is more the wealth of pieces\n\nthat is simply a bit much, but one could create (another DIY move) their own greatest hits of this\n\nand have really strong forty-minute album.\n\nFrom Thomas Peter I reviewed a collaborative work with Hans Koch not so long ago (Vital\n\nWeekly 1017), but it was not since Vital Weekly 682 that I heard some of his own music. On\n\n‘Thornbill’ Peter uses sound recordings from various public places as well as private residences.\n\nSome of these are noisy, other are very quiet. “What interests him in these snapshots of the\n\nacoustic status quo is the complexity, the density ratios and the inconspicuous musical links.\n\nPeter transcribes movements, pitches and rhythms, attempting to extrapolate a grammar.” The\n\ninput, the field recordings are no longer to be recognized as such as the transformations he applies\n\ninside the computer bring out something radically different. He also uses electronic sounds and\n\nrecordings of acoustic instruments (that’s perhaps cheating?). One could say that Thomas Peter\n\nis someone who uses field recordings, electronic sounds, acoustic sounds and lots of computer\n\ntechnology to create his music, and as such he is not much different from so many others\n\n(thinking here for instance of Marc Behrens or Roel Meelkop). There is perhaps a bit less of a\n\nconcept here, certainly compared to Maeder or Neukom, but it means that outcome is somewhat\n\nless of a radical experience and the idea here is to have six pieces of music, all which are delicate\n\nand highly enjoyable. Thomas Peter treats his sounds with much respect and goes about playing\n\nhis music with much refinement. There are acoustic treatments, sustained tones, minimal\n\ndevelopment from time to time, the odd crackle, and perhaps it is not something you haven’t\n\nheard before (for instance by the two already mentioned), Thomas Peter delivered a great release;\n\nintense and fragile, careful and suspenseful.\n\nAnd finally there is Schurer, also known as Bernd Schurer, who also worked as Shatterer Of\n\nEarth and Teleform, and was, in the mid 90s, part of Das Erdwerk. He too seemed to have no\n\nreleases since 2008 (‘Parallax’, also Vital Weekly 637); I have no idea what he has been up to\n\nsince then. The pieces on ‘Blind Material’ have been recorded between 2008 and 2015 and have\n\nben part of installations (ah, that explains), and recorded straight to disc. The music “concerns\n\nitself with the possibilities of non-signal based presence in sound, stasis and contingency as well\n\nas psychoacoustic illusions. In his work blind material, Schurer sonifies various processes using\n\nstochastic methods, which can neither be predicted nor directly composed” and as far as I\n\nunderstand recorded using speakers in various configurations in a space and then superimposed.\n\nIf the other three releases on Domizil from today seem to have something ‘new’, something that\n\nis very much ‘now’, the music by Schurer sounds perhaps a bit old fashioned; a bit like electronic\n\nmusic from decades ago (but then crisp and clear, and not on old scratchy record) and it sounds\n\ngreat. I was thinking along the lines of modular synthesizers for this release, more than laptop\n\ntechniques (and as usual I might be all-wrong of course). In the long ‘Soliloquy Synthesis’ there\n\nmight also be field recordings and it is a surprisingly mellow piece of music. The three shorter\n\npieces before that and two after that are more a tour de force, with quite wild blocks of sound,\n\nsometimes ear-piercing loud, full of life and force, with that long piece of solitude in the middle.\n\nWhereas Thomas Peter gave us a work of great carefulness, Schurer gives us some great power,\n\nand just like the other three releases it is another side of the coin of radical listening.

British and Dutch ensembles,\n\nlike the London Sinfonietta and De Volharding, but also a Norwegian one, which brings us to this\n\nrelease, have performed his work. Asamisimasa is an ensemble from Oslo. On board are Tanja Orning\n\n(cello), Hakon Stene (percussion), Anders Forisdal (guitar), Kristine Tjorgerson (clarinet) and Ellen\n\nUgelvik (piano). Crane works with this ensemble since 2008. The ensemble performs five works of\n\nCrane on this release, composed between 1998 and 2009. John White seems a fairly common\n\nname, but my instinct says the opening track ‘John White In Berlin’ is a reference to composer John\n\nWhite, you may know from the Obscure Records releases by Brian Eno. In the program for a concert\n\nin Oslo in April 2013, Crane writes: “I use simple and basic musical objects; common chords and\n\nintervals, arpeggios, drones, cadences, fragments of scales and melodies. The materials may seem\n\nfamiliar – perhaps even rather ordinary – but my aim is to find a fresh beauty in these objects by\n\nplacing them in new structural and formal contexts…” This makes one and one is two, if you ask\n\nme, as this counts also for White and other composers in the Obscure Records series. All five\n\ncompositions illustrate that Crane works in similar territories. Overall the music develops slowly\n\nand is built constructed from elementary and simple musical ingredients and procedures. Nice\n\nharmonies and colouring, simple melodies, warm drones. In effect his minimalistic music is of a\n\nmeditative nature. Evocative, and strongly dependent on a performance in right spirit, in order to\n\nbring alive what these compositions are about. The ensemble does a very satisfying job!

This time we have him in a very recent live recording, in a set with pianist\n\nSophie Agnel, recorded on June 22th, 2016 at Dom Club in Moscow. Agnel is new to me. We find\n\nclassically trained Agnel on several recordings of improvised music since 1997, playing with people\n\nlike Lionel Marchetti, Jerome Noetinger, Phil Minton, a.o. Since 2012 she has a trio with Steve Noble\n\nand John Edwards. Together with Catherine Jauniaux she developed a musical project for children.\n\nThe piano is her main instrument. She also developed a new instrument, the so-called cordophone\n\nthat functions in electro-acoustic settings. Also she is member of the all-star Orchestre National\n\nde Jazz. In 2007 she joined a quartet of Lazro, and from then on both Agnel and Lazro met on\n\ndifferent occasions. Both are experienced improvisers as the six improvisations on this cd prove.\n\nWe hear communicative and sensible interactions between the two. Agnel uses also the inside of\n\nthe piano in her playing creating fascinating sounds and colours. Together they develop stories\n\nconvincingly, including introvert and lyrical passages as well as dynamic outbursts, always well\n\nproportioned, delicate and with poetry. (DM)\n\n––– Address: http://www.fou.records.com\n\nQUENTIN TOLIMIERI – PIANO (CD by PFmentum)\n\nQuentin Tolimieri is a composer, pianist and improviser based in New York City. His work has been\n\npresented in Europe and North America. Much of his composed work concerns electronic music,\n\nlike the three-hour multi-channel work ‘Three Comedies’ that was presented at Sound Art\n\n(Denmark). Also they are a few works for small ensembles. So far only one composition of him\n\nis featured cd, on ‘West Coast Soundings’ (2014), an album of modern classical compositions\n\nreleased by Wandelweiser Records. ‘Piano’ is his first album and it is a solo-album for piano. The CD\n\nhas eight works recorded on two day in November 2015 in a Brooklyn Studio. Tolimieri composed\n\nall the works, except ‘Green Dolphin Street’ by Bronislaw Kaper and ‘Well, you needn’t’, a composition\n\nby Thelonious Monk. ‘Green Dolphin’ shows Tolimieri of his most lyrical side. In other tracks, like\n\n‘Shorty’ or the Monk-composition, one inevitably thinks of Conlon Nancarrow who composed for\n\npianola. His attacks, the rapid rally’s he plays, all this is familiar with the ‘unplayable’ works of\n\nNancarrow. Tolimieri’s music seemingly moves uncoordinated in many directions, sounds chaotic\n\nand gets lost in ornamenting. But the opposite is the case. This is very thoroughly put together\n\nwith humour and vision. It is complex, but not for its own sake. On the other hand his\n\nconstructions are very transparent in a way, moving around a strong nucleus. Yes, there is a\n\nstrong logic at work here. Truly vibrating music of a dazzling beauty. A name to watch! (DM)\n\n––– Address: http://www.pfmentum.com\n\nHANS P. KJORSTAD & RASMUS KJORSTAD – PUSINISHI ULLA (CD by Talik)\n\nBrothers Hans and Rasmus Kjorstad come from South Fron in Gudbrandsdalen, Norway. Both\n\nstudied at the Norwegian State Academy of Music and became prominent fiddlers in the Norway\n\nfolk scene. With ‘Pusinishi Ulla’ they make a very interesting debut. They play eleven folk tunes,\n\nall composed long time ago by different Norwegian composers. Compositions that representative\n\nfor the area they come from. The brothers grew up with this music and play it from early youth.\n\nBut one can easily hear this is not meant as a nostalgic or traditionalist exercise. On the contrary,\n\nthey interpret the music in a way that does justice to the original compositions, but that is also\n\nvery up to date and fresh. There is urgency and relevance in their captivating performances. I can’t\n\njudge what they have added to the originals. But is evident that they seek to actualize this\n\ntraditional music that they love. Both have a great technique and skill at their disposal. And their\n\ninterplay is very convincing and enjoying. Also it is as if they seek for a universal of global scope.\n\nIn a piece like ‘Sa Lokka E Over den Myra’, they make allusions to blues, African music, etc. By trying\n\nto be as personal and local as one can be, they made an excellently recorded album that will appeal\n\nto listeners all over the planet. Great! (DM)\n\n––– Address: http://www.talik.no\n\nATHANA – INVISIBLE COLORS (CD by Athana)\n\nAthana is the project of Norwegian guitarist and composer Als Terje Hana. Hana played on dozens\n\nof recordings as a studio-musician. In the 90s he was member of the Stavanger-based rock band\n\nLeif & Kompisane. Athana (A.T.Hana) is Hana’s personal outfit. And ‘Invisble Colors’ is the 13th\n\nrelease of this project that he started in 2005. I gave this one really a good listening – which is of\n\ncourse my job as a reviewer – as I had great difficulties with an earlier release of them that I\n\nreviewed for Vital Weekly. First some facts. Involved are Torgeir Nes (electronics), Øyvind Grong\n\n(bass, tuba ) , James Bond (percussion ) and Alf Terje Hana (guitar, electronics). With this quartet\n\nAthan climbs the stage. For this new studio recording there is also participation of Stewart\n\nCopeland (The Police), Gary Husband (John McLaughlin, Jeff Beck, Mike Stern, etc.), among others.\n\nAthana deals in groovy ambient textures, drenched in electronics, with electric guitar meandering\n\nthrough this landscape. I don’t hear ideas that are pleasantly uncomfortable, nor comfortably\n\nunpleasant, if you know what I mean. Instead pompous soundscapes built without much fantasy.\n\nThere is a discrepancy between the impressive, massive sound on the one hand, and the lack of\n\ncontent, musical ideas on the other. Well, I can’t connect it to my aesthetics, so it may be better I\n\nkeep my mouth shut. On the other hand, this is a very professional outfit and recording, and surely\n\nwill appeal to others who are into progrock-related heavy drones.

I see the Kleefstra brothers\n\nperform their music every year, sometimes even twice a year, Romke on guitar and Jan standing,\n\nwaiting to recite a few lines of his poetry in the rare language (beware; not dialect) that is Frisian.\n\nOf their trio with guitarist Bakker, I only heard ‘Griis’ (Vital Weekly 824), but he too pops up in\n\ntheir various configurations in which they all perform (also incorporating Machinefabriek from time\n\nto time). Over the many years that they have been active one can’t say that the music changed a\n\nlot, or perhaps, if it changes at all. I am not sure if that is something they want or do, changing,\n\nbut it still sounds like the very first time I heard the Kleefstra brothers (maybe back in Vital Weekly\n\n627, with the first Piiptsjilling release); long sustaining sounds played on the guitar, feeding\n\nthrough loop devices, delay units, reverb, chorus and what have you, and in each of the five pieces\n\nthere is Jan Kleefstra’s poetry lines (translation included), which evokes images of a bare, empty\n\nland hit by a stale cold wind, coming from the sea side and a massive grey air above that. Just the\n\nway the part of The Netherlands, Friesland, is at this time of the year. It all has a sombre mood.\n\nWhen I see them live I think it’s great music, but somehow more suited for home consumption,\n\nand now I hear this new record I think it is perhaps not a bad idea if there would be some kind of\n\nchange in the music. I would think it is time for small change in the menu.\n\nThere are five pieces on this CD, but somehow it seems to me that the fifth track is by error\n\nthe same as the fourth one; who knows, maybe one day this version will be a collector’s item?\n\n(FdW)\n\n––– Address: http://midirarecords.com\n\nNORMA REAKTSII & DADHIKRA – SPAWN OF LIFE (CD by Frozen Light)\n\nSMALL THINGS ON SUNDAYS – FARE FORWARD (CD by Frozen Light)\n\nWINTERBLOOD – PASSAGGIO SOPRANNATURALE (miniCDR by Frozen Light)\n\nWith this trio of new releases on Russia’s Frozen Light label, I started out with the one project I\n\nhad not heard of before, or actually two; we have one Norma Reakstii working together with\n\nDadhikra, and with both of these having an e-mail address in .Ru, I can assume they are from\n\nRussia. The Frozen Light website(s) don’t have any information about these project yet, but the\n\ncover has a short outline about life on earth suffering occasional mass extinctions, millions of years\n\nago, and that destruction of life also helped evolution. One dominate group disappearing and\n\nanother one replacing it; I am sure there is some sort of politically engaged message in this, that\n\nsomehow relates to mankind. Unless of course it’s all about fossils, artefacts from yesteryear, as\n\nthis release is dedicated to Charles Doolittle Walcott, a well-known palaeontologist. The three pieces\n\nhere are named after geological areas, and with each of these we have two, the previous and the\n\nnext one. Now, I am no expert, but this extinction was surely not the result of a single day action,\n\nbut each piece has the sub title ‘one day of brahma’. The music is pretty noise based, not harsh\n\nnoise, but gentle amount of distortion is surely present in all of this. It is very hard to say what\n\nkind of sound sources have been used in this release; it could really be just anything. Within the\n\nmusic there is hardly any clue, except a large amount of distortion and ‘Cretaceous-Palaeogene’\n\nalso some feedback, and which is by result the loudest piece on this release. I played this with\n\ninterest, but was not blown away by it. For a noise release it was not bad, even when not much\n\nthought seemed to go into the compositions themselves and how to make them engaging for\n\nthe listener. I heard better in that respect, but then luckily this wasn’t some pointless HNW release\n\neither, so that’s always good, I think.\n\nMusic from Small Things On Sundays, Danish duo consisting of Henrik Bagner and Claus\n\nPoulsen has been reviewed before, on many occasions, and as recently as Vital Weekly 1059.\n\nBoth members are also very active it other projects and have their own labels. At the core of\n\ntheir instruments one always finds ‘various treatments of vinyl records’, bowed guitar, radio,\n\nprocessing and resampling. The music of Small Things Of Sundays can go in various directions,\n\nranging from quite delicate to very chaotic and messy. On this new CD it works out in the first\n\nway, the highly atmospheric path is what they walk here and they do an absolutely great job.\n\nMore (well, or less) than before, the sound of vinyl is not something that one easily recognizes\n\nhere, and that, in my book, is something that I enjoy very much. Sometimes the whole turntablism\n\nposse works on my nerves, and I go thinking ‘well, yeah, scratchy records, so what’, but whatever\n\ntreatments Bagner and Poulsen are using, it surely doesn’t reveal, or hardly, the fact that they\n\ncome from vinyl sources. Small Things On Sundays play the ambient card here very much and as\n\nsuch I was reminded of zoviet*france (always a plus in my book) even when Small Things have their\n\nown approach. I would say this is one of the best releases I heard from them so far and the best\n\npiece is ‘Into The Unknown’ (perhaps an area ready for improvement are the titles they choose for\n\ntheir pieces), in which they have slowly meandering, drone like sounds, with some chirping insect;\n\nat first there was someone outside with a rusty bicycle, but the sound didn’t go away, and I realized\n\nit was inside the music.\n\nAnd hot on the heels of Stefano Senesi’s latest full length ‘Culti Segreti’, he now follows with\n\n‘Passagio Soprannaturelle’, a four-track miniCDR, in a very limited edition. Upon listening to this\n\nmusic, I would think that this the successor to their album ‘La Via Di Neve’, which was reviewed in\n\nVital Weekly 1020, as this has the same approach to using keyboard sounds; long sustaining\n\nsounds and it sounds very mellow; just the kind of winter music I guess, and exactly that same\n\nreference I made back then, also because it was wintertime around these woods too. The second\n\npart of the title piece has a somewhat darker ring to it, compared to the three other pieces. This\n\nwas some fine mood music for sure, but more for the die-hard fans who couldn’t get enough of\n\nthe pieces on ‘La Via Di Neve’, and who wanted four somewhat shorter new pieces. I thought it\n\nwas rather neat and sweet, for what it was, and nothing outstanding. (FdW)\n\n––– Address: http://www.frzl.ru/\n\nPERLONEX – PERLONOID (CD by Zarek)\n\nIGNAZ SCHICK ELECTROACOUSTIC SEXTET – THE RETURN OF THE OLD SCHOOL\n\n(CD by Zarek)\n\nIGNAZ SCHICK & OLIVER STEIDLE – ILOG (CD by Boomslang Records)\n\nIt was not a difficult choice where to start with this trio, even if I like to take a risk or two. I\n\nhadn’t heard any music from Perlonex in a few years, so it was good to see something new\n\nagain. Although the word ‘new’ is merely relative, as ‘Perlonoid’ was recorded in 2010 by this\n\ntrio of Ignaz Schick (turntable, objects, sine waves, live-electronics, feedback), Jörg Maria Zeger\n\n(electric guitars, live-electronics, feedback) and Burkhard Beins (drums, percussion, objects,\n\nzither). This is the start of a couple more archive releases as well as new music later this year.\n\nThe group has been on a hiatus for some years, partly due to all of these people playing with so\n\nmany other improvisers, all over the world. The last time I heard music by Perlonex it was recorded\n\nwith Charlemagne Palestine, well before this was recorded, and it is interesting to see that also\n\n‘Perlonoid’ has a minimalist touch, with however a very maximum dynamic range. The piece is\n\nforty-six minutes and moves in two waves from quite mellow via crescendo to something very\n\nloud. It is like they performed the same piece twice in a row, but of course there are many small\n\ndifferences. It is a heavily layered, orchestral piece that keeps building layer upon layer and in\n\ntheir two peaks becomes very forcefully loud. Essentially, so I was thinking, this is a drone record,\n\nbut then played by a trio of musicians, working with an odd range of instruments and sounds. On\n\nSchick’s turntable we don’t find any vinyl, but objects rotating (and I read that this was the last\n\ntime he did use it like this; now he’s back to using vinyl again), but that is something that we\n\nhardly find back in the music. Only at the break in the middle and the last two minutes one hears\n\nthe instruments as they are. It starts out with an ominous drone already. This is a fascinating\n\npiece of music; minimal, maximal, powerful and highly intense. I would recommend this at a high\n\nvolume and let the sound wash you away.\n\nMore archive music was found by Schick, which was recorded at the A L’arme Festival in\n\n2013, who invited him to gather an ensemble. Schick listed himself on alto saxophone and flutes,\n\nMatthias Müller (trombone), Toshi Nakamura (no-input mixer), Marta Zapparoli (tapes, electronics),\n\nWerner Dafeldecker (ac. guitar, live-electronics) and Paul Lovens (selected drums & percussion).\n\nSchick brought along a bunch of graphic scores and after the rehearsals he took them away and\n\neverybody played from memory, which is an interesting idea of course. The two pieces are twenty-\n\nthree minutes and these are most curious. Whenever Schick picks up his saxophone and starts\n\nplaying it, the pieces become a tad too much free jazz for me, and it’s something I simply don’t\n\nlike very much. Having said that I must also there is so much more about this music than just free\n\njazz. These six players bounce all over the spectrum when it comes to improvising and that is\n\nactually very nice. Sometimes it’s all introspective, glitch and scratch like and before you realize it\n\nthese six players are in a totally different area with their music, either something noise based with\n\nsome piercing sine waves, ambient, drone like or even a bit of post rock acoustic guitar stuff,\n\ncourtesy of Dafeldecker. And of course the totally free improvisation but then sans saxophones\n\nis also part of this. It makes all of this a highly varied release and while I didn’t like the full 100%\n\nof it, pretty much a lot of it I very much enjoyed.\n\nAlso received and let’s say I didn’t notice the fact it was released in 2015, is a CD by Ignaz\n\nSchick, here back at the turntable, teaming up with Oliver Steidle on drums, percussion and Kaoss\n\nPad. I never heard of him before. They might be calling themselves Ilog, but it might also just be\n\nthe name of the release. They label the music as jazz-core/noise and have been playing together\n\nsince 2013. The core part of the description of course refers to hardcore as that’s what this music\n\nis about; a full-on attack on the senses via mostly chaotic drumming that is usually superfast, even\n\nwhen there also exceptions, such as the first part of the third piece, ‘Movement 3’. I have no idea\n\nwhat Schick puts on his turntable this time; it can be objects but just as easily it can also be vinyl,\n\nbut if so then I have no idea what this vinyl could be. It goes, I would think, through a bunch of\n\nsound effects, and comes out with much distortion and feedback. This is some powerful music\n\nindeed, one that drained the energy out of me, but I mean that in a positive way. Here too I can’t\n\nsay it was something that I enjoyed for 100%, but like the previous release, I enjoyed most of it. I\n\nwould this is explosive duo should be a real treat in concert.

Yershova plays the piano, an acoustic one, and uses the\n\nrecordings inside computer-based electronic music, involving beats, rhythms, textures, glitches\n\nand which may or may not be derived from the same piano recordings. That is, I must admit,\n\nsometimes hard to believe. Before Yershova called this piano drone music, but I don’t see that\n\nmentioned now. It is not really drone like music in the classical sense of the word, even when\n\nthere is quite a bit of that be found here. That is perhaps the one thing I really enjoyed about\n\nYershova’s music; the way she crafted her piano samples to make them sound like a rhythm\n\nmachine. On top of that, and that’s what perhaps this makes far less from drone music, Yershova\n\nplays the piano and that sounds rather lively, playful, spacious, melodic, sad and joyful; all sorts\n\nof moods drop by, and, like on the previous release, some of this sound perhaps a bit too much\n\nlike new age music, such as the title piece, and lacks the ambient qualities of say that recent Brian\n\nEno album. But in her more up-tempo pieces, the ones with the steady techno tick, ‘Anarchic Piano’\n\nfor instance, she taps into the field of dance music with a fine sense for the minimalist tradition\n\n(Reich, Glass), which works very well. In other pieces she’s more abstract and in these pieces a bit\n\nshorter and more to the point, and the addition of these pieces makes up that this is finely varied\n\nalbum.

Subbotin on drums\n\nand voice, which is different than the first time I heard their music as Schperrung (see Vital Weekly\n\n1041). Again the release is over an hour long, starting and ending with some highly obscure field\n\nrecording from a hydroelectric power station. Apparently the music is all about ‘water and\n\nelectricity’, so Bilha writes me, and ‘white border is a bed where the humans are sleep’, which\n\nmakes me none the wiser. Very much like the previous release I heard this deals with the world of\n\ntormented rock music, and this time reduced to one guitar, one amplifier, some stomp boxes and\n\nvery occasionally the use of a microphone. The guitar is sometimes a bit out of tune, and Bilha\n\ncan’t play properly, or pretends not to, and it makes all of this very much the outsider rock music\n\nthat many people like. I think I miss out the use of drums on this release, as that seemed to add a\n\nbit of variation that I seem to be looking for here; now it’s all a bit too much a stripped down guitar\n\nwork in need for some additional sounds or instruments. Though not bad, I would think it could all\n\nhave been a bit shorter; a more selective mind could have been made up, I’d say before sticking this\n\ninto the shiny cover.

Back then I compared it with Town And\n\nCountry and Ben Vida. Landis is a guitarist and dances many dances. His music can go out to\n\nbeing full on noise to very introspective and quiet. With a title like ‘Slow Names’ it is no rocket\n\nscience that music in this series is mainly from latter categorization. It is all played on acoustic\n\nand electric guitars in a rather loosely improvised mood, and with some fine space around him; if\n\nI would be in a romantic artistic streak I’d say Landis set up his recording studio in some back alley\n\nin New York City, and the amplifier is not set to very loud, but the sound of the six strings bounce\n\nagainst the high walls, and if we look up we only see a bit of blue light and the passing of large grey\n\nclouds. Sometimes Landis turns his microphone in the opposite direction and picks up some street\n\nnoise, such as the elevator sounds of ‘Here, Let Me Show You’ or the warbled talk in ‘The Color Of\n\nIt’, but these are exceptions; most of these pieces are instrumentals. If one name springs to mind,\n\nthen it would be that of Loren Mazza Connors (even when Mazza no longer seems to be part of his\n\nname) with whom Hey Exit shares a similar desolate guitar sound. Much of this seems to be played\n\non the electric guitar, with a sufficient amount of reverb to it. It is all together perhaps a bit of a\n\nlong release, clocking at sixty-six minutes, and as such it could have been a bit shorter and/or have\n\na bit more variation, but with a good wine, this is all perhaps a bit nit-picking.
