        "text": "Cindy Browne Rosefield (bass)\n\nCindy has been an active freelance performer, recording artist and educator for over 35 years. Her jazz roots are \"long and strong\", having been mentored by Bill Evans' bassist Chuck Israels. Her musical interests are quite eclectic, including many underserved musical styles that form the 'melting pot' of the great American musical legacy. Current projects include folk and ethnic ensembles -- most notably a 20-year stint with Wake the Dead (a creative blending of Grateful Dead and Celtic music).\n\nJason Lewis (drums)\n\nJason is a freelance drummer and educator based in San Jose. He has an eclectic background, including classical and jazz. His associations and recordings are numerous, most notably with Boz Scaggs, the NLS trio (Paul Nagel, Jason Lewis, John Shifflett), and Kristen Strom.\n\nTom Reynolds (keyboards/composer/arranger)\n\nTom is a performer/arranger/composer who returned to the fold after a 25-year hiatus. He was active as a trumpeter/keyboardist in the Bay Area music scene through the 1980s, most notably with Mark Levine and Chuck Clark. His playing and writing are informed by both classical and jazz idioms, and his piano improvisation style is particularly influenced by classic mainstream post-bop horn players (Tom Harrell, Woody Shaw, Kenny Dorham, Joe Henderson). His vocal work visits the ‘golden era’ of the Great American Songbook, but is also influenced by the singer/songwriter tradition."
