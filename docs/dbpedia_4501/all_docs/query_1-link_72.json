        "meta_description": "While David Bordwell and others have used the films of John Huston as textbook examples of what is considered the classical visual style of Hollywood cinema, few have noted that, by contrast, Huston's approach to music often defies conventions of film scoring. This becomes evident when examining several aspects of Huston’s use of music and sound, including his choices of composers, the application of the leitmotif technique, the use of music to establish conflicts of cultures, the interaction of sound and silence, treatment and placement of diegetic and non-diegetic aural elements, the incorporation of songs, and his use of music to emphasize the psychological dimensions of his characters. Citing examples from more than two dozen of the director’s films, a consideration of these concepts in this essay demonstrates Huston’s deliberate deviations from conventional scoring methods and contradicts the charge of some critics that the director often was indifferent to the technical aspects of his films, such as music.",

        "text": "The author would like to express his appreciation to Dr. Lesley Brill, in whose graduate seminar on John Huston at Wayne State University this work began, and who has continued to support and encourage this research.\n\nIntroduction\n\n1 Gideon Bachmann, “How I Make Films: An Interview With John Huston.” Film Quarterly 19.1 (1965): 3-1 (...)\n\n“I hate decorative music. I want the music to\n\nhelp tell the story, illustrate the idea, not just to\n\nemphasize the images. That means that it must\n\nhave a certain autonomy.” (John Huston)\n\n3The director himself has had little to say regarding the scoring of his films. In his autobiography, Huston discusses his working methods almost solely in terms of the visual elements. His only reference to the function of music in films occurs in his discussion of the scoring of The Maltese Falcon (1941), in which he states: “As with good cutting, the audience is not as a rule supposed to be conscious of the music. Ideally, it speaks directly to our emotions without our awareness of it, although, of course, there are moments when music should take over and dominate the action” (Huston 80).\n\n5In his autobiography, Miklos Rozsa discusses his sole association with Huston on The Asphalt Jungle (1950) and indicates the director’s involvement with the composing process:\n\nI wrote the prelude and asked Huston to come and hear it. He didn’t like it. He said it was doing what innumerable preludes had done already, telling the audience that what they were going to see was super-colossal, tremendous, fantastic, the greatest picture of all time; and then came—just a picture. What he wanted was a tense but quiet opening, and that is what the picture has now. (Rozsa 144)\n\nVariations on a Thematic Approach: Motifs and Themes in Huston’s Films\n\n8The status Warner Brothers gave to Huston’s first directorial effort is indicated by the assigning of Deutsch, who at the time was mainly scoring lower budget productions, rather than one of Warner’s top composers, such as Max Steiner or Erich Wolfgang Korngold, to the project. The success of the film elevated Huston to the top rank of directors at the studio. For his next project, he was assigned the melodrama In This Our Life (1942), starring the studio’s leading actress Bette Davis as a woman named Stanley who steals her sister Roy’s lover. The film was scored by Steiner, a composer known for his prominent use of leitmotifs. In his liner notes for the RCA release Classic Film Scores for Bette Davis, Tony Thomas claims that\n\nthe real artfulness of this score is his delineation of the two main characters. […] Stanley is destructive, petulant and mean, and Steiner characterizes her with a fragmentary theme based on a two-note motif that is an ingenious bit of film scoring […] The theme for Roy, on the other hand, suggests a well-adjusted, warm woman. (Thomas, liner notes)\n\n9But the use of these motifs is actually more complex than Thomas suggests. The romantic theme he equates with Roy is associated throughout the film with the potential for positive romantic resolutions, as opposed to the lack of resolution provided in Stanley's theme (which Thomas connects to the unresolved nature of her life). A more character-specific motif associated with Roy is a playful twelve-note pattern, introduced in the strings when Roy talks to Peter about wanting to make a home for him as he is packing to leave her [13:40-15:20]. A darker version of the motif is heard when she acknowledges that they agreed their marriage would have “no strings” (an ironic word choice given Steiner’s typically lush orchestration) [15:40-16:22]. The Roy motif is heard again when she arrives at Stanley’s apartment after the suicide of Roy’s husband with whom Stanley has run off [50:25-54:45], and later when she visits the mother of a man falsely accused of a hit-and-run Stanley committed [1:13:10-1:14:53].\n\n11Another major theme in the score (“Texas Memories”) becomes associated with Curtin’s longing for a rural communal existence. The first appearance of the theme [40:01-40:50] is motivated by Curtin’s reference to listening to the sounds of guitars at night while working as a peach picker, a moment which breaks down traditional definitions of diegetic and non-diegetic sound, since the source is identified in the dialogue but not visible on screen. The theme appears at two other points: during a reference to the harvest in Cody’s letter [1:15:37-1:16:32] and in the finale when Howard suggests that Curtin contact Cody’s wife about trying to get a job harvesting fruit [2:04:24-2:04:57]. The brief melody serves as a nostalgic reflection and also provides a link between Cody and Curtin.\n\n12Following Huston’s departure from Warner Brothers, the scores for his films show less reliance on character associated themes. The principal motifs in The African Queen (1951), scored by Allan Gray, are identified with the title object and with the romance that develops between missionary Rose Sayer and steamer captain Charlie Allnutt, rather than with the individual characters, while the unifying element in Georges Auric’s rather sparse score for Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison (1957)—the Huston film that most closely resembles The African Queen—is a sprightly scherzo construction that becomes associated with the actions of characters running up or down a hill on the island where the action takes place; it receives its most striking variation in the treatment that accompanies the flight in the rain of nun Sister Angela from drunken Marine Allison [1:23:11-1:24:14].\n\n13Alex North’s first collaboration with Huston, The Misfits, makes more traditional use of a main theme, but what is of particular interest is the manner in which North enables the theme to fluctuate between diegetic and non-diegetic aspects of the scoring to emphasize the various characters' need to connect with one another. Diegetic uses of the theme occur in early scenes, including a muzak treatment heard in the diner where showgirl Roslyn Taber and her friend Isabelle Steers go after Roslyn’s divorce [10:50-15:53], and a jazz variation as Roslyn dances with truck driver Guido and comments that “We’re all dying” [26:36-28:15]. Later, the theme gradually replaces the source music from a bar as rodeo cowboy Perce Howland and Roslyn talk outside and he tells her about his mother [1:06:24-1:10:50]. The versatility of North’s theme is demonstrated in the eerie treatment it is given in the scene in which Roslyn dances around a tree [28:35-29:24], and in the dramatic scoring in which the theme is combined with a propulsive ostinato as Guido drives recklessly while drunk [1:12:54-1:14:55]. Even the film’s conclusion [2:04:01-2:04:46] defies scoring conventions, since North does not provide the expected recapitulation of his main theme and the unresolved quality of the concluding music reinforces the visuals (which do not even provide a traditional card announcing “The End”).\n\nMusic as Signifier of Cultural Conflict\n\n15The atmosphere of musical parody suggested in the score for The Mackintosh Man is also evident in Jarre’s scores for The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean and The Man Who Would Be King, and the latter’s juxtaposition of British colonial songs with traditional Indian instrumentation demonstrates another characteristic of the scores for Huston’s films. Many of these scores make use of conflicting elements that reflect a clash of cultures or ideologies, and this conflict is often established during a film’s opening credits. Indicative of this approach is Bronislau Kaper’s score for The Red Badge of Courage, which combines traditional folk tunes with more contemporary scoring that expresses the hero's state of mind. A sense of conflict is established at the outset, as Kaper weaves folk pieces in a fugue-like arrangement—the music even conflicts with the MGM lion, as drum beats combine with the animal’s roar during this opening trademark. Hugo Friedhofer’s score for The Barbarian and the Geisha (1958) is founded on a heroic main theme that dominates a more romantic motif. As William Darby and Jack Du Bois observe in American Film Music,\n\nFriedhofer consciously subsumes his romantic melody to his main theme to continuously suggest the dominance of one plot element over the other. This arrangement can be heard in the opening credit sequence […]. We hear the romantic theme, rendered by a harp, only within the larger contours of the main theme. (Darby and Du Bois 213-14)\n\nThe Eloquence of Silence\n\n19Death in Huston’s films is often silent. Benjamin Frankel’s delicate woodwinds cut off to announce the passing of the poet Nanno in The Night of the Iguana (1964) [1:48:06-1:48:17]. In Reflections in a Golden Eye, the music swells in a Rozsa-esque construction in the final scene [1:46:44-1:47:47], but stops abruptly when Army major Weldon Penderton throws open the door to his wife’s room, returning as the camera begins to pan wildly after he shoots Private Williams [1:48:13-1:48:55]. Silence emphasizes the brutality of the moment when Heron runs down and bludgeons a serf in A Walk With Love and Death [1:00:07-1:00:16], and only after he cradles the dying man does music enter to provide mournful comment [1:00:28]. In The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean, the death of Maria Elena is signified by the end of the theme that has been playing on her music box. The discovery of the body of the flute player in Under the Volcano is unscored, with the sound of a wood flute appearing after a comment is made that it is too late to help him [1:10:14]. Such moments strongly illustrate Huston’s principle, stated in an interview with Gideon Bachmann, that music has its greatest impact when used economically, and the deliberately placed moments of silence in his films allow the music to have greater impact than if the scenes were fully scored.\n\nThe Integration of Non-diegetic Sound\n\n20One particularly striking use of the juxtaposition of silence with natural sounds also provides perhaps the most direct delineation of the distinction between diegetic and non-diegetic elements in all of cinema. During the opening of Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison (1957) [0:20-2:32], music is heard only when a written credit appears on the screen; as each credit fades, the music gives way to natural sounds and returns only when the next credit appears, thus equating non-diegetic music with the non-diegetic visual element of the written credits. As indicated in North’s handling of the main theme in The Misfits, the music in Huston’s films often shifts between non-diegetic background scoring and music that is part of the physical environment. The early diegetic music in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre [1:12-7:36; 10:07-10:55; 14:16-15:59] or the folk tunes played on harmonica in The Red Badge of Courage [for example, from 5:36-6:52] are intended to stand in marked contrast to the non-diegetic dramatic scoring, which in both of these films is used to externalize the inner conflicts of the lead characters. Source music becomes an important part of establishing the setting and atmosphere of Moulin Rouge and The Dead. The dominance of source music in the 1952 musical biopic’s lengthy opening scene increases the impact of the entrance of the background score at the moment when Toulouse-Lautrec first stands up [18:56]. In the 1987 adaptation of James Joyce’s famous story, which Pauline Kael has described as being “about the music that men and women make, and especially about the music of Irish voices” (Kael 404), non-diegetic music appears only briefly, and significantly, during the lengthy party scene, when spinster Kate reflects on a young English tenor named Parkinson [45:40-46:25]. A brief instrumental passage also acts as a coda to the singing of “The Lass of Aughrim” before being replaced by a dance tune [1:04:06-1:04:17]. Nondiegetic scoring dominates the last section of the film, but it is made up of tunes previously heard as source music and for which specific associations have been established.\n\n22As with the use of silence, the acknowledgement of source music acts to increase the dramatic impact of the non-diegetic scoring. An indication of Huston’s philosophy regarding the use of diegetic and non-diegetic music is indicated in a discussion recounted in Goode’s The Making of the Misfits. At a meeting with Huston, writer Arthur Miller and other members of the production team prior to writing the score, North commented, “The source music should be interwoven against the personal music,” and in keeping with the director’s tendency to reject obvious music choices, the composer noted, “The only thing I’m trying to avoid is ‘cue’ music, where music comes in on a specific line.” In discussing the handling of the music in an early scene in a bar in Reno, Huston observed, “My feeling is against any outside comment in that scene in back of the saloon. If they’re playing some godawful hoe-down music in that bar, that might be the best comment. If you make a comment against a comment on the screen, you're in trouble.” Reinforcing Huston’s concern with having the music reiterate what was already apparent in the dialogue and visuals, North concluded, “There is so much that is said so right on the screen that to duplicate it in music would be a mistake” (Goode 298). In the final film, the “godawful hoe-down music” from the bar is gradually replaced with the main theme as Perce reveals his background to newly divorced Roslyn, and the subtle blending of source and personal music provides one of the most poignant moments in the film. The discussion of the Misfits score suggests that, at a time when the diegetic and non-diegetic aspects of a film’s score often were regarded as separate entities (with the former even often dependent on material that was owned or could be cheaply licensed by the studio), Huston regarded them as equally significant elements that should be integrated in creating the soundscapes of his films.\n\nSong Interludes and Vocal Performances\n\n23 One aspect of Huston’s integration of source music into the overall score that deserves special attention is his use of songs. With the obvious exception of Annie (1982), Huston’s single foray into the film musical, the director was seldom given to staging production numbers. The song number in Moulin Rouge becomes a natural element of the overall flow of the opening scene (despite its establishment at the beginning of the film the song, which became a popular success, surprisingly is not used as a dominant musical motif in the background score) [10:34-14:05]. More intrusive—and perhaps deliberately so—is the cloying song interlude in The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean [51:20-53:23], which is presented in such an overt way that it seems intended as a parody of the “Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head” number in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (George Roy Hill, 1969). In other instances, Huston has used songs not as set-pieces, but as an outgrowth of the dramatic action, often employing them for ironic counterpoint or to reinforce a central theme.\n\n25More subtle than these deliberately ironic comments are familiar tunes that are used to define characters or provide insight into their feelings. The conflicting personalities of the two leads in The African Queen are reinforced by the songs which bookend the film, opening with the singing of a religious hymn that reflects Rose’s missionary work [1:33-5:25] and ending with Charlie singing a sea shanty [1:44:03-1:44:18]. The use of character associated songs is also evident in Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison, through Allison’s singing of “Don’t Sit Under the Apple Tree”; the tune is woven into the background scoring at key points to express the deeper connection that develops between Allison and Sister Angela. This connection is also expressed in the score’s coda after Sister Angela has accompanied the stretcher carrying the wounded Allison down the hill to the beach. The final cue combines a sprightly march with a more somber reflective theme underneath that reinforces the distinct personalities of the two main characters and indicates their inevitable return to their respective callings, although the intertwining of the two themes also suggests the unification of their spirits [1:45:37-1:46:00].\n\n26In many films, Huston incorporates songs that emerge organically as part of the dramatic action. A tense scene in Key Largo (1948) involves racketeer Johnny Rocco goading alcoholic former showgirl Gaye Dawn into performing the song “Moanin’ Low” by promising her a drink, and then humiliating her [56:54-58:27]. By contrast, the rendition of “Arrayed for the Bridal” by aging music hall performer Julia in The Dead serves as a nostalgic recollection, and Huston reinforces the notion visually by incorporating shots of various mementos in an upstairs room during her performance [30:10-32:21]. In A Walk With Love and Death (1969), Heron’s visit to the castle Dammartin where he will meet Claudia is instigated when he meets a servant in the woods singing a song about a lover who has gone off to war [8:03-9:14], and the conflicting forces in the film are represented vocally through the chant heard during a religious procession [18:07-19:10], and a song associated with the knights [54:01-55:04]. If, as indicated earlier, death itself is usually silent in Huston’s films, remembrance of, or reflections on, it often occur through song, as in the battle remembered in war correspondent Hugh Firmin’s song about the defense of Madrid sung at an outdoor cafe in Under the Volcano [1:13:42-1:15:20], the haunting rendition of “The Lass of Aughrim” which reinforces Gretta’s recollection of a long dead lover in The Dead [1:01:41-1:04:17], the uses of “John Brown’s Body” (sung in a particularly effective moment by a dazed soldier) [31:50-32:33] and “When Johnny Comes Marching Home” in The Red Badge of Courage [10:37-11:14], and soldier of fortune Daniel Dravot’s dramatic delivery of “Minstrel Boy” as he prepares to meet his fate near the end of The Man Who Would Be King [2:03:29-2:04:18]. Like the other musical elements in his films, Huston does not employ songs merely as a background element, but incorporates them in places where they make a significant (and perhaps in the case of Judge Roy Bean satiric) contribution to the narrative.\n\nPsychological and Physical Music\n\n27The selectivity with which Huston uses music in his films has resulted in scenes of particularly strong dramatic impact. Perhaps nowhere is Huston’s use of music to reinforce physical action and psychological states more evident than in the climactic round-up of the wild horses in The Misfits. One extended cue begins with a solo horn as Guido expresses his love for Roslyn, then carries over to the roping of a mare, and climaxes as Roslyn runs into the desert and screams [1:48:57-1:51:43]; the musical linking of the actions suggests that they all contribute to the heroine’s anxiety. In his analysis of the scoring of this scene, which he describes as a four-act ballet, Irwin Bazelon comments on the highly stimulating nature of the action music, but adds: “North’s music captures something more: it conveys a feeling of the romanticism and high adventure of yesteryear and touches upon the loneliness of aging cowboys whose way of life has passed” (Bazelon 80). During Gay’s final confrontation with one of the horses the music emphasizes his internal struggle as much as the external action of roping the animal.\n\n28In keeping with Huston’s interest in externalizing the psychological states of his characters, music becomes particularly effective in portraying the potential madness of his characters. Notable examples include: the frenzied theme that reaches a crescendo as the deranged Dobbs stares into the flames of the campfire in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre [1:39:13-1:40:06]; the scoring of the soldier Jim’s madness in The Red Badge of Courage, which begins softly but becomes increasing agitated, giving way to driving percussion supported by sustained string lines as he runs up a hill, cutting off momentarily as he reaches the top, and ending on a plaintive horn solo as he collapses [35:31-36:36]; the quietly repeated pattern which conveys Brother Samuel’s breakdown in The African Queen [13:10-14:40]; Auric’s alternating of darker and lighter passages in Moulin Rouge as Toulouse-Lautrec first contemplates suicide and then is seized with inspiration, ending with the positive theme dominating as he walks out the window into the sunlight [1:07:22-1:11:36]; and Goldsmith’s Herrmannesque scoring of the prologue in Freud, which equates the atonal effects and electronic sounds with the mysteries of the human psyche [1:43-3:08].\n\nConclusion\n\n30While such varied moments may not have established a recognizable “Huston sound,” they demonstrate the director’s commitment to employing music that is significantly descriptive, rather than merely decorative. More than simply reinforcing the visual elements, the music in Huston’s films, at its best, provides a psychological dimension to the characters and incidents beyond what is conveyed in the visuals and through dialogue. If Huston’s visual style has been described as classical, his musical style is often unconventional. In his eclectic choice of composers, his willingness to experiment with more modern musical forms, and his unusual application of traditional film scoring techniques, Huston challenged established approaches to film music and anticipated practices that have become more common in film scoring in recent years. Despite his own limited observations on the subject, an examination of the music in Huston’s films indicates that the director regarded it as an equally important aspect of the narration, which could be selectively but deliberately employed to provide contributions that could not be achieved through the other communicative elements of film, allowing the music in his films to achieve the “certain autonomy” that the director desired."
