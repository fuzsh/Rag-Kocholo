        "text": "Faculty\n\n2023 Faculty\n\n“A genuine pianistic talent who tempers his performance with genuine musical sensitivity.” VIENNA\n\n​\n\n\"Under the baton of American conductor Robert Ward the Wiener Residenz Orchester responded not only with energy and precision, but with great musical sensitivity.\"\n\nVIENNA\n\n​\n\nRobert Ward\n\nFestival founder and Artistic Director ROBERT WARD maintains an active career as pianist, orchestral conductor, chamber musician, director of international music festivals, juror at prestigious competitions, and master teacher.\n\nA native of Illinois, his early piano teachers were pupils of the legendary Russian virtuosa Isabelle Vengerova, of Beethoven specialist Artur Schnabel, and of Emil von Sauer, one of the last pupils of Franz Liszt.\n\nHe first came to international attention when the U.S. State Department sent him on a 10-country tour of Latin America to introduce Samuel Barber’s PIANO CONCERTO.\n\nAdvanced studies took him to Vienna on an Austrian Government Grant to study at the renowned Akademie für Musik with Professor Dieter Weber and to the Salzburg Mozarteum for study with pianist - conductor Carlo Zecchi, a pupil of Busoni. While on a Fulbright Award to Italy for study with famed German pianist Wilhelm Kempff, he received the Prix di Positano for his Beethoven performances.\n\nWidely acclaimed a master-teacher, his former students are on the faculties of music schools and conservatories across the US, Europe and Asia. The National Foundation for Advancement in the Arts named Robert Ward a Distinguished Teacher in the Arts for “inspiring young artists and having the most profound influence on their artistic development.” He received the MTNA President’s Award “for Outstanding Service as Coordinator for International Outreach” and the inaugural Award of Excellence “for Service to Youth and Music” presented by the Austrian-American Council of North America. Robert Ward is currently Lecturer in Chamber Music at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.\n\nMaking his conducting debut at age 17, Robert Ward has conducted college and professional orchestras in the U.S. and Europe. He is a founding director of the California Philharmonic Orchestra in Los Angeles, has conducted the Pasadena Pops and the Haydn chamber orchestra at Caltech. Since 2006 he has appeared as guest conductor with the Wiener Residenz Orchester and its larger entity, the Vienna International Orchestra. Currently he conducts the Chamber Orchestra of the Slovak State Opera, orchestra-in-residence at Concerto*Fest*Europa.\n\nIn 1997 Professor Ward co-founded Piano*Fest*Austria in Bad Aussee, Austria, later changing its location and name to Concerto*Fest*Austria when the program expanded to present talented young artists as concerto soloists with the Wiener Residenz Orchester.\n\nDuring this period he traveled frequently to present master classes in such cities as Shanghai, Chungdu, Beijing and Taichung (Taiwan), while spending several summers in Prague on the artist faculty of the AMEROPA International Chamber Music Festival.\n\nWith Professor Adam Wibrowski, a colleague from the Paris Conservatoire, he founded Bratislava: First International Piano Week in 2015.\n\nThe following summer, on the invitation of the St. Petersburg (Russia) Philharmonic Society, he presented a 2-week series of Master Classes entitled “Building Bridges.”\n\nIn summer 2017 Robert Ward returned to Bratislava to found and direct Concerto*Fest*Europa, \"An Academy for the Study and Performance of Classical Concerti.” At the conclusion of the 2-week program, the participants present a series of Festival Concerts with the highly- regarded Chamber Orchestra of the Slovak State Opera in elegant 18th century palais. This program is proud to showcase some of the most gifted “Stars of Tomorrow.”\n\nDuring the pandemic, the musical world suffered under the heavy restrictions imposed by governments on public concerts. Sadly, the hopes for a return in 2022 were erased with the Russian invasion of neighboring Ukraine and the risks it imposed on international travel. Nevertheless, at the urging of potential soloists in Southern California, a one-week version of Concerto*Fest*Europa was presented in Los Angeles in September 2022 under the prestigious auspices of the Da Camera Society.\n\n*****************************\n\nIt is with great anticipation and celebration that Concerto*Fest*Europa returns to Europe for summer 2023!\n\nArpad Patkolò\n\n​\n\nReceiving his first violin at age seven, young Arpad seemed to understand instinctively its basic principles, and after only three months, he began performing. He entered various competitions for young musicians and in short time was winning awards.\n\n​\n\nThroughout his advanced studies he was a laureate in prestigious competitions such as the Czechoslovak Competition (1983, 1985) and the Dušek Competition in Prague, among others. Upon completing his artist Diploma, he performed Tchaikovsky’s Violin Concerto in D major.\n\n​\n\nSeeking to further his artistry, he participated in masterclasses taught by distinguished violinists and renowned master teachers.\n\n​\n\nSoon after, he was engaged by the Slovak National Theatre Opera Orchestra where he now serves as the principal concertmaster.\n\nArpad Patkolò is an avid chamber musician, and for a number of years, has performed with a trio in Switzerland and in a string quartet with professional colleagues. In addition, he appears frequently with his wife, who is a pianist.\n\n​\n\nHe is highly sought-after as a concertmaster for various orchestras in the region, regularly performing in Vienna where he leads a chamber orchestra; as both concertmaster and soloist with the Wienerklassik orchestra which tours throughout Europe and China, and as a guest concertmaster with the German Passau Orchestra. For many years he has performed with the European chamber orchestra “Spirit of Europe.”\n\nJulia I Chin\n\n(Director’s Note: We welcome Julia I as our 2023 Festival Artist.
