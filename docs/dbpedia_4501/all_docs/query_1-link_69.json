Its notable alumni include several presidents of other notable universities, scientists, actors, and of course musicians. The orchestra performs a variety of contemporary and classic literature from the standard jazz repertoire at festivals at home and abroad, and has featured various guest artists such as Jon Faddis, Louie Bellson, Bob Mintzer, Wycliffe Gordon, Ingrid Jensen, Jimmy Heath, and many others. The ensemble’s European tour with trumpeter Wayne Bergeron will take them to Jazz Festivals and other events in Italy, Switzerland, Slovenia, and Austria.\n\nConductor and musical pedagogue at Stanford University Jazz Orchestra Mike Galisatus received many teaching awards in the course of his distinguished career. He started out conducting South San Francisco, El Camino, and Aragon High School bands before becoming a professor of Music and director of Bands at the College of San Mateo. His exceptional teaching abilities soon earned him the position of director of the Stanford University Jazz Orchestra which he holds today. He is also an active trumpet player and has recorded with the likes of Louis Bellson, Natalie Cole, Frank Sinatra Jr., Mary Wilson, Kenny Washington, Gladys Knight and many other notable musicians. Michael is in demand as an adjudicator throughout California, and has appeared as guest conductor for many bands. He was president of the California Music Educators’ Association – Bay Section and currently holds the office of Jazz Representative there.\n\nWayne Bergeron is one of the world’s most sought-after musicians. Studio sessions, film dates, international touring, jazz concerts, guest appearances, and clinics keep him busy not only in his hometown of Los Angeles but worldwide. Bergeron first came to prominence when he landed the lead trumpet chair with Maynard Ferguson’s band in 1986. Bergeron’s list of recording credits extends from Ray Charles to Green Day. Other musical icons he played with include Katy Perry, Beyoncé, Barbra Streisand, Michael Bublé, The Jonas Brothers, Burt Bacharach, Seth MacFarlane, Natalie Cole, Celine Dion, Seal, Diana Krall, Tito Puente, Christina Aguilera, Dianne Reeves, Michael Bolton, Earth Wind & Fire, The Pussy Cat Dolls, My Chemical Romance, The Mars Volta, Chicago, Rosemary Clooney, Diane Schuur, Barry Manilow, Lee Ann Womack, Lou Rawls, Eric Marienthal, Kenny G., and David Benoit.\n\nBergeron has worked on over 500 TV & motion picture soundtracks. A partial list of his film credits includes Red Notice, Turning Red, Soul, Bob’s Burgers, Ford vs. Ferrari, Toy Story 4, Frozen 1 & 2, The Lion King (2019), The Secret Life of Pets, Wreck it Ralph 2, Crazy Rich Asians, Sing 1&2, Moana, Frozen 1 & 2, Get On Up, Toy Story 3, Monsters University, High School Musical 3, Get Smart, Superman Returns, The Simpsons Movie, Dreamgirls, Hairspray, Mission Impossible 3, Ice Age 2, Spiderman 1 & 2, Team America and South Park. Furthermore, Bergeron’s trumpet solos are featured on motion pictures including West Side Story (2021 Steven Spielberg), La La Land, Sing, The Incredibles 1 & 2, Rocky Balboa, The Secret Life of Pets 2, Rough Night, Jazzman’s Blues, Vacation Friends, Ted 2, Minions, Minions 2: The Rise of Gru, Spies in Disguise, Jersey Boys, The Green Hornet, The Interview, Despicable Me 1, 2 & 3, Duplicity, Princess & the Frog, The Perfect Game and many others. His numerous TV credits include the Academy Awards, Golden Globe Awards, SAG Awards, NBC, ESPN & TNT sports themes, American Idol (2001-02), Emmy Awards, Grammy Awards, Animaniacs Reboot, Family Guy, American Dad, Simpson’s, Will and Grace, King of the Hill, Futurama, Buzz Lightyear, Hercules, to name but a few.\n\nBergeron’s greatest love, however, is playing lead in big bands. He has recorded and played with some of Los Angeles’ most respected bands including Gordon Goodwin, Arturo Sandoval, Pat Williams, Sammy Nestico, Jack Sheldon, Chris Walden, Tom Kubis, John La Barbara and others. He is, however, in no way limiting himself to jazz bands, in fact he has done guest appearances with the L.A. Philharmonic, The New York Philharmonic, Cleveland Orchestra, Dallas Symphony, Taiwan Symphony, and Tokyo Philharmonic.\n\nBergeron’s first solo effort, ‘You Call This a Living?’ received a Grammy nomination for Best Large Jazz Ensemble. His second album, ‘Plays Well With Others’, released on the Concord Jazz label in 2007, was met with the same widespread critical acclaim. Bergeron released his personal favorite album ‘Full Circle’ in January of 2016. Perhaps Grammy winning composer and bandleader Gordon Goodwin said it best, when he described Wayne as a “once in a lifetime lead trumpet player.”\n\nComplimentary tickets, courtesy of Adria Media Ljubljana, can be collected at the Imago Sloveniae office (Gornji trg 16, Ljubljana) by 30th June 2023 every workday from 10 am to 4 pm. On the day of the concert, they can be collected at the Entrance Pavilion in front of the main entrance to Ljubljana Castle and at the bottom station of the castle funicular railway.\n\nIn collaboration with:"
