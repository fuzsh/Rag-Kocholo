        "text": "Annual Awards Competition Recognizes Young Emerging Musicians\n\nThe Los Angeles Philharmonic announces the winners of the 2005 Bronislaw Kaper Awards for Young Artists. The January 15 competition was held on stage at Walt Disney Concert Hall for the strings instrumental category with violinist Yumi Man of La Crescenta winning first place; violinist Ken Hamao of Santa Monica winning second place; cellist Brook Speltz of La Ca√±ada winning third place; and violinist Jennifer Liu of Oak Park being named Most Promising Musician.\n\nA total of fifteen young string players between the ages of 10 and 17 competed in the first round where they were required to play excerpts from a Romantic work, a 20th century/contemporary work, and a Bach solo sonata, partita, or suite. Seven string players moved on to the finals and performed excerpts from a concerto of their choice.\n\nA panel of leading musicians served as judges for the competition including Los Angeles Philharmonic musicians Barry Socher (violin), Mark Kashper (violin), Ingrid Hutman (viola), and Gloria Lum (cello). Also on the panel was Chad Smith, Artistic Administrator, Los Angeles Philharmonic Association.\n\nAward winners receive monetary awards: first place receiving $2,500 (made possible by the Foothill Philharmonic Committee); second place receiving $2,000 (made possible by Los Angeles Philharmonic Concertmaster Emeritus David Frisina); third prize winning $1,000 (made possible by the West Valley Committee of the Los Angeles Philharmonic); and Most Promising Musician winning $500 (made possible by Encore).\n\nThe Bronislaw Kaper Awards For Young Artists are held annually by the Los Angeles Philharmonic for the piano and strings instrumental categories, which alternate each year. Named in honor of the late Bronislaw Kaper, a renowned film composer who served for more than 15 years as a member of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Association's Board of Directors, the Awards encourage the development of young and gifted musicians.\n\n# # #"
