        "text": "1952 song by Bronisław Kaper\n\n\"Invitation\" is a song by Bronisław Kaper with lyrics by Paul Francis Webster, which originally appeared in the film A Life of Her Own (1950). Although it was nominated for a Golden Globe award for Best Score in the original film, it only became a jazz standard after being used as the theme in the 1952 film Invitation.[1] Tony Thomas notes that it was selected for the film for its degree of poignance.[2] It is considered to be Kaper's second best known song after \"On Green Dolphin Street\".[3] JazzStandards.com describes it as a \"lush and haunting score\" and notes that it is most associated with John Coltrane, who recorded it in 1958.[1] Howard Morgen, who arranged it for guitar, writes that the \"haunting\" tune has \"long been recognized by jazz players for its potential as an interesting mood piece\" and \"still sounds fresh and contemporary today.\"[4]\n\nGeorge Shearing arranged the song for piano, while Frank Mantooth arranged a Latin version of it.[1] Dakota Staton covered it on her 1958 album Dynamic! In 1961, Rosemary Clooney recorded the song with a lush arrangement by Nelson Riddle and featured it as the first track on her album Love,[5] where the lyrics acquired special poignancy, given that Clooney and Riddle, both married, were having a doomed affair at the time.[6]\n\nIt has since been recorded by the vocalists Carmen McRae,[7] Freddy Cole, Andy Bey, and Patricia Barber; pianists Bill Evans,[4] Randy Halberstadt, Steve Kuhn, and Renee Rosnes; saxophonists John Coltrane, Joe Henderson, Herb Geller, Vincent Herring, Sahib Shihab, and Don Braden; trumpeters Roy Hargrove and Brian Lynch; bassist Ray Drummond; and vibraphonist Cal Tjader (on his album Latin Kick), among others.[1] David Frackenpohl arranged a version for guitar, which was published in the 2004 Mel Bay book Jazz Guitar Standards: Chord Melody Solos.[8]\n\nJazz critic Ted Gioia notes the following:[9]\n\n\"Invitation\" is an example of the peculiar process of \"survival of the fittest\" that has shaped the jazz repertoire. ... [It] has survived solely because jazz musicians have enjoyed playing it. This song was probably too complex for the mass market in 1952, and it certainly is far beyond what passes for popular music today. During the course of its 48-bar form, \"Invitation\" uses all 12 tones as a chord root at least once, and the harmonies are thick with ... higher extensions. ... \"Invitation\" is still inviting enough to keep the jazz musicians interested, and is likely to hold on to this constituency for some time to come.\n\nSome significant recordings\n\n[edit]\n\nLes Brown - vocal by Jo Ann Greer. 78 rpm single for Coral Records 61047, backed with Sitting in the Sun, recorded in Hollywood (1953)\n\nGeorge Wallington - George Wallington with Strings (1953)\n\nJohn Young - Young John Young (1956)\n\nCal Tjader Sextet - Latin Kick (1956)\n\nDakota Staton - Dynamic!
