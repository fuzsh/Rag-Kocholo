        "text": "saying how limited the 'Zimmer sound' is!\n\nIf only I had said that? I said the scoring in this film feels \"atomic\" and \"elemental\"... to me... (how many \"this is my opinion\" qualifiers should one post need?) The musical material feels... to me... to be very irreducible, concept-driven. The main idea in the score is literally a scale or pitch collection. The musical atoms create musical form by building up \"crystals\" of the same thing, tessellating and re-arranging. I do admire the creativity within those self imposed limits. I don't believe I ever said those limits constitute some kind of \"Zimmer Sound\" ... that would be tantamount to saying \"Zimmer doesn't write tunes\" or something equally silly in the face of Rango, Sherlock Holmes, Hannibal, The Thin Red Line.... as people have said 10x already, Dunkirk got the score it got because of the kind of movie it is. A \"Nolan movie\" if we want to use that as shorthand for a certain aesthetic. The more Nolany it gets the less I like it, that's all. As you said: a matter of taste.\n\nIn my humble opinion, I thought Greenwood's score to Phantom Thread was far superior to anything else nominated. This 'House Of Woodcock' piece is sublimely beautiful, and will be remembered for decades to come, I think...\n\nI think Greenwood's \"problem\" is that he's writing from the standpoint of the modern concert arena rather than from the Hollywood film score tradition. While his music garners deserved attention thanks in no small part to PT Anderson who mixes his scores prominently in his films, I think the voters are still hardwired to vote for scores that are either tuneful and memorable, or else present some kind of novelty (ie Midnight Express, Chariots of Fire, BrokeBack Mountain, etc etc).\n\nSophisticated music or its application to film is much less understood and garners far less attention. Greenwood's There Will be Blood, in my opinion, is the greatest score of the 21st century, not because it draws upon Bartok, Varese, and Penderecki, but in its application. Who in the world would marry those stark, emotionally ambiguous idioms to an early turn of the century film about industrialization and religion in America? It's the same intelligent sophistication that goes for Dunkirk- it challenges the viewer's expectations of what music is and how it functions in a dramatic narrative. Would I put Dunkirk on as pure listening enjoyment? Probably not. Does it impact its film in a way that makes a profound statement? YES! And at the end of the day, that is film music's primary function: to serve the film the best way it can. Sometimes the music can operate on both plains and be as enjoyable freed from its filmic confines like Interstellar which plays like a ballet or symphony to me. But that's a bonus and not a requirement of the gig, especially if the movie calls for a very different approach.\n\nI often wonder what people thought of David Shire's Taking of Pelham 1,2,3 with its marriage of big band instrumentation and serialism. Was it accepted? Did people think Shire had gone batty? Did the filmmakers even know what a tonerow was or because it was dressed up in 70s funk/jazz, it didn't really matter?\n\nIt's important for film composers and filmmakers to continue pushing the boundaries of what music for film is and I applaud HZ and Greenwood for probing those areas as much as a I salute directors like Nolan and Anderson for being receptive to these intelligent approaches.\n\nWhen it comes to judging who is going to win an Oscar (for anything) not just music scores or songs, where most people go wrong is they try to use their personal judgement on what they think is good.\n\nWhat they don't do, and what they should do, is make a judgement on the Oscar committee and historically what they think is good. That way you'll get closer to understanding Oscars and the bullshit that surrounds it.\n\nLet me put it another way. Hitchock, Herrmann, Goldsmith and T. Newman in their entire careers, which adds up to getting on for 200 man years I could guess, have won 2 oscars between them. And there are numerous other examples. So on the music oscar, Desplat was always going to win it because (a) the type of film (b) because of the type off music and (c) because the oscar committee think that way. And good luck to him and them.\n\nThat is all I need to know.\n\nFinally! A thread at v.i. control focused on Hans Zimmer that isn't about how to get proper spiccato eights sounding; Braaams in brass, large percussion sounds and grooves, synth plugins and the size or quality of his latest sample library! Look at the names that are being mentioned, Leonard Bernstein, Leonard Rosenman, Bronislau Kaper, Jerry Goldsmith, Bernard Herrmann and of course Mr. Williams. My purpose in this thread (using just one example of HZ's unique and innovative writing) is precisely to look at what he is actually achieving in his work and his proper place in film history. The topic is fugue and the subject (pun intended) is Hans Zimmer!\n\nNow, if you simply take all that's been said here and the musical examples and take note of the fact that the structure I refer to is done with concrete sound-motives, you have what is rightly a first in all of film. That is a major achievement pure and simple and obviously has gone unnoticed. It cannot be hyperbole to point it out. It is a factually accurate observation. I have also made the point that the impulse to do something of this nature is a rare creative artistic gesture whether in the film context or without. Also that the composer should rightfully be compared to non-film composers since the advent of electronic music who may or may not have done such a thing.\n\nI thought for sure someone would have found this cue by now. I don't own the film and don't have time to sit down with it but I'll see what I can do.\n\nIf you say so, but a fugue doesn't strike me as particularly a 'gut' device, and Zimmer an unlikely exponent of the form -- in fact, one of his many legacies is arguably the steady reduction of the use of counterpoint in mainstream film scoring.\n\nI meant his instinct to even use such a structure. There is a ton of brain-power behind the actual execution of it as would be necessary in programming alone not to mention composing and fitting things together where psychologically it's profile and effect strike you as a Bach construct not that of a modern film composer.\n\nWell, there's a single well-known piece which signposts itself as such in the album title (and wherein the strict fugal part is dispensed with fairly quickly in the film itself), but I can think of many other fugue passages -- in Black Sunday, Home Alone, Land Before Time, Total Recall etc. Even Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote one for the Odessa File...\n\nYes and I have received a welcome education on the subject here by some of the informative posts. Nonetheless they all seem to confirm the fact that no one has done such a thing with non-melodic/harmonic material.\n\nThe inclusion of a fugue per se in that score wouldn't dispel any of those criticisms -- it could well be a bombastic and repetitive fugue. As a general point, I think for anyone inclined to those conclusions about Zimmer, Dunkirk is likely not the score that will change their minds, fugue or no fugue.\n\nThe inclusion of a fugue would in fact dispel criticisms along the lines of a typical, synth score that offers nothing new. Criticisms I read here before I saw the film. None of the other criticisms are mine btw. I think HZ is a delicate composer in the extreme who is capable of large musical gestures. The fugue is not the work of a bombastic composer but a forward thinking music innovator.\n\nThis seems to be the official upload to YouTube of \"Dunkirk\"'s OST:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpOW2x1fl4dzL6LnSRtJw1AnjTlZYnDYX\n\nCan the OP find his fugue there? From his description in #11 I think it might be track 4, \"Supermarine.\"\n\nI'm looking and listening. HOME is the closest thing I've found but I don't think that's it.\n\nSomething that occurred to me when no one was able to easily identify it is the fact that I saw it in Imax and so the vertical sound plane was 30 feet high or whatever with even more considerable width. All the elements were spread out over these two planes and so there was considerable delineation of the sound-parts. That isn't going to translate on desktop computer speakers. I will keep searching.\n\nHeavens though really: just listening to a couple cues such as THE OIL really makes me shake my head. Anybody who has ever layered sustaining and repetitive ideas and tried to make them fluid, dynamic, harmonically interesting, natural sounding and breathing (and for considerable length) has to know HZ does the impossible here. Just stunning music making and all the while riffing on a diminished chord. I'm always baffled at casual dismissal of these innovative, major achievements in music and film scoring. To say nothing of the perfect wedding of such to picture. That cue just blew me away totally.\n\nI often wonder what people thought of David Shire's Taking of Pelham 1,2,3 with its marriage of big band instrumentation and serialism. Was it accepted? Did people think Shire had gone batty? Did the filmmakers even know what a tonerow was or because it was dressed up in 70s funk/jazz, it didn't really matter?\n\nThe whole thing is built over an ostinato (non-twelve tone), and it's written in the style of the highly chromatic jazz of the era anyway. So the lead may be twelve tone, but the listener has a clear sense of being grounded by the ostinato. It may be serial in certain particulars, but it's not a true dodecaphonic piece. It obviously was accepted I guess - it made it into the film and was nominated for a BAFTA.\n\nRosenman's The Cobweb from 20 years earlier -- a heavily (if not always strictly) twelve tone score -- certainly sounds more like what Webern/Berg/Schoenberg et al would have recognised as dodecaphonic music, so Shire wasn't really blazing any trail here, though the juxtaposition with jazz was neat."
