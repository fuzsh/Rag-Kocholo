While critics were not found of either the novel or the film, the latter was widely popular among audiences and won an Academy Award for best special effects.

Though Kaper was known for composing hit film and Broadway scores, “On Green Dolphin Street” did not experience immediate popularity.

“On Green Dolphin Street” became a jazz standard after Miles Davis recorded a version in 1958, which many consider the best early cover of the tune.

The Miles Davis Quintet went on to record the song several times, including versions with John Coltrane and Sonny Stitt.

Over the years multiple artists have recorded “On Green Dolphin Street,” including Tony Bennett, Eddie Harris, Ella Fitzgerald, Joe Williams, Herbie Hancock, Paquito D’Rivera and many more.

Author Sebastian Faulks wrote a novel titled On Green Dolphin Street, published in 2003, in which the main character hears Miles Davis playing the title song as she moves to Greenwich Village in the 1960s.
