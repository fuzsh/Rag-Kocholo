        "text": "This haunting 1984 film gives a personal side to the ruthless 1970s Cambodian genocide.\n\nNew York Times reporter Sydney Schanberg first shared his story in a page-turning Sunday magazine article. The Cambodian correspondent narrowly escaped in 1975 when the Communist Khmer Rouge invaded. But his desperate efforts to sneak out his loyal interpreter failed. Dith Pran was forced to endure years of near-starvation under the new totalitarian regime, while Schanberg (Sam Waterson) blamed himself back home.\n\nHaing S. Ngor, also a Khmer Rouge victim, won an Oscar for supporting actor as Pran. The film was nominated for seven Oscars including best picture. It also won for cinematography and editing and looks terrific in this Blu-ray debut."
