        "text": "The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) and The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (1939): The shield is apricot and is surrounded by vines and plants. The latter has the lighter concept.\n\nRope (1948): The WB logo is superimposed on the opening shot. The shield is unnaturally pale.\n\nUnder Capricorn (1949): It appears as usual, but the word \"Presents\" is absent.\n\nA Star is Born (1954) and Rebel Without a Cause (1955): The Warner Bros. logo is above Los Angeles at night.

It then morphs and shrinks to become a circle.\n\nJohn Paul Jones (1959): The WB shield is in a gold/safety orange/old burgundy color scheme, and the word \"Presents\" is absent.\n\nThe Nun's Story (1959): Uses the same shield from The Young Philadelphians on a black background. The logo zooms in as it fades in. Often plastered with a recent WB logo on some newer prints.\n\nA Summer Place (1959): The Warner Bros. shield is superimposed over a beach at sunset.\n\nThe Sundowners (1960): The WB shield is in a 30's style and has no banner around it. It is superimposed on an Australian grassland background.\n\nThe Sins of Rachel Cade (1961): We see a black and white WB shield on a black background. It then morphs into the outline of Angie Dickinson's character, Rachel Cade.\n\nSplendor in the Grass (1961): The shield is carved onto a granite background.\n\nGay Purr-ee (1962): The WB shield is inside a blue rounded rectangle with \"PRESENTS\" in a red rounded rectangle, amongst other colorful rounded rectangles.\n\nAdventures of the Road Runner (1962): The bannerless WB shield is on a red-orange sign, and the words \"WARNER BROS. PICTURES\", in a cartoon-ish font, are on a bright red sign, with the word \"Presents\" in a red script font below.\n\nThe Music Man (1962): We see a very large array of uniformed marchers moving forward, two further in front who are carrying on either side a wide red banner with the Warner Bros. logo on it. The camera then zooms in on the banner to show the usual logo.\n\nGypsy (1962): We start out with an orchestra on a stage. When the music starts, the outline of the shield is formed on a curtain, and then the inside afterward. The shield is gold.\n\nCritic's Choice (1963): Cartoon posters of musicals appear one by one until they make up the background. Then the white shield from The Young Philadelphians fades in.\n\nKingdom of Saguenay (1963): The shield's banner is metallic. Also, the shield is in the middle of the screen and \"PRESENTS\" is absent.\n\nMy Fair Lady (1964): The logo is colored shadow brown and is on a flowerbed background, with the words in Edwardian Script font.\n\nThe Great Race (1965): The bannerless WB shield is on a completely different background, with \"PRESENTS\" in the \"Posse\" font, used in the opening credits for the 1959-1973 series Bonanza.\n\nThe Battle of the Villa Fiorita (1965): The 3D shield from the 1950s appears on a different sky background. The shield is now metallic, and looks slightly different from the previous version.\n\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966): The shield is put on a black background and is in black & white like film itself.\n\nBonnie and Clyde (1967): The shield is put on a black background and is sepia toned.\n\nThe Omega Man (1972): The WB shield is superimposed over Charlton Heston driving a car. The banner reads \"A KINNEY LEISURE SERVICE\".\n\nWhat's Up, Doc? (1972): Both variants have the logo in gold on a brown book:\n\nOpening: As we zoom out, we see a hand opening the book to the inside cover, and then to text which says \"Warner Bros., A Warner Communications Company Presents\".\n\nClosing: The final page reads \"Distributed by Warner Bros.\". The book is then closed.\n\nBlazing Saddles (1974): The 1948-1967 WB shield on a black background burns up to start the movie. The words \"WARNER BROS. PICTURES\" are also glowing. Seen after the 1972 logo.\n\nAlice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974): The 1948 WB shield is used, accompanied with the start of \"You'll Never Know\", as performed by Alice Faye in the 1943 film Hello, Frisco, Hello. Seen after the 1972 logo and the David Susskind credit.\n\nThe Outlaw Josey Wales (1976): On American Heroes Channel airings, the current logo with the TimeWarner byline is still and is tinted in sepia.\n\nThe Late Show (1977): The logo features the 1937 shield without Jack L. Warner's name and \"Presents\". Apparently, this film was supposed to be a modern-day detective story with a 1940s feel to it.\n\nThe Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie (1979): A replica of the 1936-1964 Merrie Melodies cartoon intro (including red rings and a blue center) is used with the red and white WB shield and Bugs Bunny on the top of it saying \"Eat your heart out, Burt Reynolds!\" Only seen at the end of the movie.\n\nThe Main Event (1979): The 1972 logo is on a purple background.\n\nTime After Time (1979): The 1948-1967 WB shield zooms in on a cloudy background while the classic 30's fanfare plays in the background. Seen after the 1979 Orion/WB logo.\n\nBugs Bunny's 3rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales (1982): It starts with the regular logo, then it has the \\\\' logo with a circle of the 1940s cartoon logo which comes out of the \\\\'.\n\nThe Killing Fields (1984): The 1984 logo starts off bylineless. Then, the byline fades in.\n\nCity Heat (1984), Under the Cherry Moon (1986), and Heartbreak Ridge (1986): The logo is in black and white. However, on Under the Cherry Moon, the logo starts in color but fades to B&W.\n\nThe Goonies (1985): The logo fades to a skull with crossbones.\n\nSesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird (1985) and Here's Looking at You (TV Movie):\n\nNote: the opening and closing credits only apply to Follow That Bird.\n\nOpening: We get a brief 2-D animated segment where a cartoon Big Bird finds an air pump and a balloon. He inflates the balloon and it turns out to be a \"W\", which pops off and flies into the sky, where it morphs into the \"W\" in the \"WB\" shield as the rest of the shield forms around it. While this happens, Big Bird announces that \"Sesame Street is brought to you today by the letters W and B.\"\n\nClosing: The closing in-credit logo is yellow.\n\nThis also appears on the latter title, with John Williams' Superman theme playing over it.\n\nPolice Academy 2: Their First Assignment (1985): The theme music starts over it. The inside of the shield has a forest green tint.\n\nPee-Wee's Big Adventure (1985): The \"PRESENTS\" variant of the normal logo (with the fanfare) makes a cameo at the beginning of the overblown film adaptation of Pee-wee Herman's adventure to find his bike. Pee-wee is visiting with the hobo character and his pals when it appears on the screen in the background.\n\nThe Color Purple (1985): The logo has a very slight maroon tint.\n\nRainbow Brite and the Star Stealer (1985): At the very end of the film, instead of the regular 1972 closing logo, we see the \"Distributed by\" WB shield bug seen on movie posters from 1985-90, tinted in rainbow like the credits, and scrolling with the credits.\n\nOne Crazy Summer (1986): The logo turns crudely drawn, with wiggling clouds. The byline & clouds dissipate as an evil-looking animated pink bunny, who wears a red-white striped helicopter cap (like the one seen in the following movie) and has the picture of a No Rhino sign on his body, opens the shield from inside. He laughs, and then we zoom into his mouth, seeing the opening title zoom in toward us, transitioning to the opening.\n\nWho’s That Girl? (1987): The Warner Bros. logo with byline appears as animated on a granite background. We zoom up to the logo, the shield opens like a door, and out comes a cartoon Madonna, who closes the shield and poses sexy for the camera. The logo goes up and she moves down to make way for the opening credits.\n\nDaffy Duck's Quackbusters (1988): The 1984 logo starts with only the sky background, but then the shield zooms in as it would on Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies, stopping at its usual place, and then the byline fades in. A re-orchestrated version of the fanfare from the LT short Porky's Preview starting with a roaring sound as the shield zooms in plays over. This comes directly after the Daffy Duck short Night of the Living Duck, which opens the film.\n\nBatman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992): The WB shield is a metallic orange and the byline is in a different font. The background fades to the opening shot and the logo fades out.\n\nGremlins 2: The New Batch (1990): Instead of the normal shield logo, a replica of the classic 1936-1964 WB \"circles\" cartoon logo comes up, with its text and minus the shield (\"PICTURES, INC.\" is removed in favor of \"A TIME WARNER COMPANY\"). The shield then zooms up with Bugs Bunny riding it, and the text fades out. Daffy Duck then comes on screen, angrily pushes him off the shield (\"50 years of you hogging the spotlight is ENOUGH!\"), and tries to ride it... well, it doesn't work as good for him. They also have another Looney Tunes-style ending after the credits, with Porky doing the usual \"That's all Folks!\" ending before Daffy, like before, complains of Porky hogging (no pun intended) the spotlight, saying \"60 years of hogging the end title is enough\". Daffy tries to say the end line, but like before, is stopped when the shield with Chuck Jones' credit comes out, hitting him in the face. He gets back up and weakly says \"Fade out.\"\n\nWarner Home Video movie intro (1990): The logo begins as usual (with Max Steiner's fanfare playing), until Bugs Bunny interrupts. He pops into the logo and tells the audience that the movie can't begin until you wish him a Happy Birthday. It then cuts to various Looney Tunes clips as a chorus sings \"Happy Birthday to You\". It then cuts back to Bugs looking rather satisfied. This appeared on an Italian VHS of Caddyshack and UK VHS releases from 1990, including Driving Miss Daisy, Hard to Kill and The Witches.\n\nPure Country (1992): The logo fades to a sunset background where the credits take place.\n\nBatman Forever (1995): The shield transforms into the Batman logo.\n\nTwister (1996, US version): The shield appears from the clouds, zooming in slowly. This is only on the US release, while international prints use the Universal Pictures logo.\n\nMars Attacks! (1996): A little flying saucer flies around the shield.\n\nBatman & Robin (1997): Same as Batman Forever, but the shield transforms into a frozen Batman logo.\n\nConspiracy Theory (1997): As part of the opening shot, the logo is shown. Then, the camera then pulls back to show it as a billboard on the side of a bus.\n\nContact (1997): The shield is in a dark crystal blue color, and the sky is in dark blue.\n\nLethal Weapon 4 (1998): The music is off sync with the logo. After the music is over, the shield explodes into a fireball, transitioning into the opening title sequence.\n\nYou've Got Mail (1998): The background fades into a computer screen and the shield becomes pixelated. It zooms out to reveal the rest of the computer screen and its icons. (If you notice, in the bottom right corner, there is an America Online icon, which is a coincidence; Time Warner would merge with AOL in 2001.)\n\nJack Frost (1998): The shield & text is covered with snow and ice. Also, the cloud background is tinted in dark red. When the animation finishes, it pans downwards.\n\nThe Matrix (1999), The Matrix Reloaded (2003), and The Matrix Revolutions (2003): The logo is tinted in green, with the sky background in black and white, and the graphics altered so they look \"computerish\".\n\nTrue Crime (1999): The 1984 logo appears, as with all 1999-2014 Eastwood movies.\n\nThe Big Tease (1999): The logo animates as normal, however various noises associated with hairdressing, such as a hairdryer and the buzzing of a shaver, play over the music.\n\nHouse On Haunted Hill (1999): The logo is tinted in dark gray to symbolize the film's theme.\n\nDeep Blue Sea (1999): Before the logo is even faded completely, the background turns black while the shield turns into the 1984 shield tinted in blue, and water starts to appear as the logo ripples.\n\nSouth Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut (1999, Non-US version): The logo is a bit darker, but fades to the opening shot at the end.\n\nThe Exorcist: Extended Director's Cut (1973, 2000 reissue): The entire 1992 WB logo is in black and white.\n\nSpace Cowboys (2000): This and the following Village Roadshow logo aren't animated. Also, they are put on a black background, and the logos are in the same light blue color scheme as the first five minutes of the movie. The font in this logo differs, as well.\n\nSwordfish (2001): The logo flickers as if it was on a problematic computer screen.\n\nThir13en Ghosts (2001, USA): The logo is tinted in light gray. This is only on the US release, while international prints use the Columbia Pictures logo.\n\nOsmosis Jones (2001): The logo comes up looking like an amoeba with tentacles.\n\nOcean's Eleven (2001): This and the following Village Roadshow logo are tinted in baby blue.\n\nValentine (2001): This and the following Village Roadshow logo are tinted in crimson. It is also the first film to use the 1999 logo with the AOL Time Warner byline.\n\nHeist (2001) and Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood (2002): The 1948-1967 shield with the AOL Time Warner byline is seen that was used on Flags of Our Fathers, with clouds in the background, and on Heist the old fanfare is heard and it fades into a black and white, shortened Morgan Creek logo.\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone (2001):\n\nThe logo is slightly dimmed compared to the normal version.\n\nOn the DVD menu, the logo is set on a night time cloudy background. And just like the teaser trailer, It decomposes as owls fly by.\n\nOn the Magical Movie Mode 4K Ultra HD/Blu-ray release, the Golden Snitch is seen flying around the logo.\n\nBlood Work (2002): The 1984 logo is used with \"An AOL Time Warner Company\" on the bottom.\n\nGhost Ship (2002): The opening logos are tinted brown, and the typical Warner Bros. logo is instead an intentionally chintzy Fifties style logo. Also, the byline is in the ITC Garamond font.\n\nJuwanna Mann (2002): The logo is sepia-toned.\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002): The shield appears high in the clouds as the camera zooms through it.\n\nScooby-Doo (2002): The logo animates as normal, but the cloudy background is brighter and different. When a chunk of the shield disappears with a chomping sounds as if it were bit out, the music stops abruptly and we hear Scooby-Doo do his famous laugh, and then a zoom out has the shield turn into a Scooby-Doo dog collar with the initials \"SD\" on it. Underneath is a \"A Mystery Inc. Company\" byline.\n\nQueen of the Damned (2002): The logo is black and white and the background is a dark cloudy sky.\n\nCradle 2 the Grave (2003): The background fades into a city skyline, leaving only the shield.\n\nDreamcatcher (2003): The logo is covered in snow.\n\nLooney Tunes: Back in Action (2003): Just the normal logo with the prototype byline but everything but the shield fades out and we see the shield zooming out on the red rings that immediately make you think \"Looney Tunes.\" The title appears on the rings. Over this variation is the classic instrumental composition of \"What's Up, Doc?\" arranged and composed by Jerry Goldsmith.\n\nMatchstick Men (2003): The opening studio reflection is tinted blue. When the shield reveals itself, it changes to its normal colors. Also, the logo is set against a swimming pool.\n\nMystic River (2003): The bylineless logo stands still on a black background in black and white.\n\nGothika (2003, USA): The logo is tinted in Leyden blue. This is only on the US release, while international prints use the Columbia Pictures logo with the same variation.\n\nThe Last Samurai (2003): Just the normal logo with the \"TIME WARNER\" byline in the same font used during the AOL Time Warner era, but in a sky blue and black color scheme.\n\nNew York Minute (2004): A rock version of the fanfare plays over the logo, and the logo zooms back on a clock face.\n\nThe Polar Express (2004): The shield is icy on a black background and is still or \"frozen\".\n\nOcean's Twelve (2004): This and the following Village Roadshow logo aren't animated and the background is multicolored.\n\nThe Aviator (2004): The 1948-1967 logo is used with the TimeWarner byline in a gold and silverish blue color and the clouds aren't animated.\n\nScooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed (2004): The logo is leyden blue and put on a night sky background.

It is completely still. Strangely, this appears on Encore HD airings of Superman: The Movie, plastering the white \"\\\\'\" on black background (although the older logo is intact on SD airings).\n\nUnaccompanied Minors (2006): Just as the animation is almost done, a plane ticket (which is later revealed to be for the opening credits) flies around the shield and a huge pile of snow falls on the shield, causing it to break in half. It is then ploughed out of the way to make room for the Village Roadshow Pictures logo.\n\nSuperman Returns (2006): There's the first bits of the famous triumphant Superman fanfare heard somewhere in the middle of the current logo.

Also, it is put on a black background.\n\nLady in the Water (2006): The logo plays normally for a few seconds until it cuts to its last few seconds.

Also, it's snowing in the background.\n\nBeowulf (2007, Non-US version): The logo is in 3D and moves in a slightly different animation.\n\nOcean's Thirteen (2007): A combination from the previous Ocean films: The logos are light-blue colored and also animated, the background is multicolored, green and red vertical/horizontal bars, start to appear over the logos and very nice piece of music (The Riviera Affair by Neil Richardson) is heard during all this. The animation was inspired by the opening titles to the 1975 television series Switch as well as WOR-TV's The Four O'Clock Movie, of which the opening music was initially utilized.\n\nThe Astronaut Farmer (2007): The logo is silver and the background is a twilight sky while the logo glows.\n\n300 (2007): The WB logo is in stone and a mock version of the theme \"As Time Goes By\" is heard during the first six seconds.\n\nThe Brave One (2007): The WB shield is transparent and the background is a skyline of a city.\n\nThe Invasion (2007): The shield is tinted in hunter green and the animation happens differently.

On the latter, the cloudy background is different.\n\nGet Smart (2008): The WB shield appears like a machine, then opens to space, transitioning to the Village Roadshow Pictures logo.\n\nRocknRolla (2008): The logo is scratched out on a brown wall, along with the Dark Castle Entertainment logo.\n\nSpeed Racer (2008): Each logo (WB, VRP and Silver Pictures) is already formed and placed on a kaleidoscopic background created from the logo shown. The shield also \"shines\" from left to right.\n\nThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008, International): Like the variation of the Paramount Pictures logo, We see buttons fall down, resembling the Warner Bros. shield and the byline. Then, more buttons fall, transitioning to the Paramount Pictures logo. A still version of this variant appears at the end on international prints, while US prints use a still of the Paramount's variant for this film.\n\nGran Torino (2008): Same kind of logo like on Flags of Our Fathers, except it's gray.\n\nThe Dark Knight (2008): The logo is in a navy blue tint.\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009): Still the same dark style is used, only this time there is lightning in the background.\n\nWatchmen (2009): The WB logo is black on a goldenrod background, and \"WARNER BROS. PICTURES\" is in the font Futura (as opposed to Times New Roman). Same as the DC, Legendary Pictures and Paramount Pictures variants.\n\nTerminator Salvation (2009, USA): The shield is gray, animates diffrerently, and has been static shocked.

Also isn't animated.\n\nWhiteout (2009): The shield is in gold and moves differently, then opens to aurora.\n\nThe Box (2009): The logo along with the Radar Pictures and Media Rights Capital logos are in black and white.\n\nInvictus (2009), Hereafter (2010), J. Edgar (2011), and Trouble with the Curve (2012): Same kind of logo as on Flags of Our Fathers and Gran Torino, except it's in black and white.\n\nNinja Assassin (2009): The shield is metallic and moves differently.\n\nThe Firm (2009): The logo turns neon, with the letters \"W\" and \"B\" in raspberry pink and the shield border in blue.

Afterwards, when the white \\\\' finishes zooming in on a red background, the word \"WARNER BROS. PICTURES\" in the Handel Gothic font fades in below the \\\\' logo instead of \"A WARNER COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY\". Afterwards, the WarnerMedia byline (in its usual font) fades in below \"WARNER BROS.

The 2019 shield is metallic silver against a dark cloudy background with fire burning beneath it. The variant of the WB logo is the reference to Scorpion, one of the characters from the game where the film is based on. The shield also breaks into pieces after the byline fades out as it transitions and transforms into the New Line Cinema logo, which also freezes as it's formed. A snowfall occurs in the cold moonlit cloudscape, in which the NLC logo variant refers to Sub-Zero, who is also one of the characters from the game.\n\nThe Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It (2021): Similar to the other Conjuring films, but with the 2021 WB/NLC logos instead.

At the end, the background fades to black, similar to the 2020 logo, then the shield and byline follow suit a second later.\n\nThe Matrix Resurrections (2021) and The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience (2021, Tech Demo): Similar to Cry Macho, the shot of the backlot is removed, just leaving a black background (though it's still on the reflection).

Then, it reveals an ornate WB shield in gold with a blue interior, with the \"WB\" letters in glittery silver. Necklaces and jewelry made of gold and rubies surround the shield and there are golden lines on the background. The Warner Bros. Discovery byline, also in gold, fades in underneath.

If you look closely during the shield's reveal, four jewelry-styled replicas of the studio's iconic water tower are colored in gold.\n\nBlack Adam (2022): The WB-NLC logo is rough metallic on a dark, stormy background.
