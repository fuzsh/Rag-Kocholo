        "text": "NORMAL, Ill. (WMBD) — The McLean County Health Department has reported its first bird to test positive for the West Nile Virus in the county this year.\n\nAccording to the health department, the positive sample came from a dead crow reported in the 61761 zip code in Normal.\n\nThe health department said it will begin distributing door hangers to notify residents about symptoms to watch out for.\n\nBirds like crows often carry the virus. Mosquitos that bite the infected bird can then spread it to other animals and humans. Symptoms of West Nile can include headaches and a slight fever, with more extreme cases leading to disorientation, a high fever, and even paralysis or death, according to the health department.\n\n“Adults 50 years or older and people with compromised immune systems are at the greatest risk of developing severe symptoms,” Angie Crawford, MCHD senior environmental health practitioner, said. “If symptoms become severe enough to seek medical attention it is important to let medical staff know of any mosquito bite in the past 14 days so they can test for West Nile virus.”\n\nSo far, 48 counties in Illinois have had positive West Nile tests in 2024, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health. IDPH is also reporting five positive human cases, including one positive human case in Tazewell County.\n\nFirst positive mosquito sample of West Nile virus reported in Peoria County\n\nThe MCHD warned that human infections mainly occur in mid-summer and early fall. People can reduce their risk of catching the virus by using repellant and removing areas of standing water from their property that mosquitos might use to lay eggs.\n\nDead birds should also be reported to the health department by calling (309) 888-5482.
