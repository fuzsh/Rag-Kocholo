Rick Flag will likely recognize her as June Moone, Enchantress’ host.\n\nThe two will likely attempt to free her, recognizing that she is being held hostage by the Undead King. Katana's actions, where she spared Harley and led Rick and Clayface to Moone, suggest she may have switched sides due to Moone's capture.\n\nSuicide Squad Isekai Episode 10 is expected to end in either the defeat or submission of the Undead King, given that it is the season finale. Additionally, Princess Fione might be crowned queen, aiding the squad in completing their mission. However, whether these events will occur in the episode or lead to a cliffhanger remains uncertain.\n\nSuicide Squad Isekai Episode 9 recap\n\nSuicide Squad Isekai Episode 9 begins with Cecil in the council room, where he is confronted by the minister who is using the Thinker's helmet to control the guards. The knight commander manages to evade him and reach Princess Fione, who is under threat from the imposter Queen ‘Aldora.’\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe imposter reveals herself as the Undead King, having killed the real queen to take her place and wage war between the Kingdom and the Empire, gaining power from the increasing number of dead. Princess Fione, after escaping with Cecil, despairs at the loss of her mother.\n\nAfter being comforted by Cecil in Suicide Squad Isekai Episode 9, she decides to take control of the situation by embracing Harley's chaotic style, painting her face like her. When the minister finds the two in the Princess’ chambers, she makes quick work of the minister using Harley’s bat.\n\nOutside, the Undead King is seen raising the dead and attacking the townspeople, creating a holographic projection of herself to scare the citizens. However, Princess Fione counters her using a similar projection, asking the people not to despair.\n\nShe then leads the Kingdom's forces against the Undead. The Undead King attempts to stop Fione by bringing down the castle with streams of rising water. Killer Croc emerges from the water to attack the princess in Suicide Squad Isekai Episode 9.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNanaue quickly comes to her aid, mistaking her for Harley due to the make-up. The Suicide Squad soon arrives, and they decide to split up: Harley and Deadshot pursue the Undead King and her zombies, while Clayface, Peacemaker, and Rick Flag decide to assist Nanaue and protect Fione.\n\nDuring their battle, the Undead King summons Enchantress to challenge Harley and Deadshot. As a building collapses onto the two, Arthur returns to help them in Suicide Squad Isekai Episode 9, in a much larger form. Harley eventually figures out how to use her magic, utilizing a magic crystal attached to her gun to shoot down Enchantress.\n\nCornering her, Harley interrogates Enchantress, realizing that someone important to her is being held hostage by the Undead King. Meanwhile, Cecil uses guns to rescue Deadshot from the zombies, while Peacemaker leaves Rick Flag and Clayface to assist King Shark.\n\nKatana then confronts Rick Flag and Clayface, almost defeating Clayface in battle. However, she instead chooses to retreat, and Suicide Squad Isekai Episode 9 ends as she leads them to a location where they encounter an undead monster with a woman resembling Enchantress trapped within it.\n\nFor more news from the Suicide Squad Isekai anime, stay up-to-date with Pinkvilla.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n*The release dates and times provided are accurate at the time of writing and are subject to change at the discretion of the creators."
