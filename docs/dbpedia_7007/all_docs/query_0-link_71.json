The film is the true story about one man’s quest to end thirty years of unsolved murders in a frightening modern day Gomorrah – the toxic waste land of oil refineries known as the Killing Fields. With his NY transplant partner, Jake (Sam Worthington) starts to unravel the web of conspiracy and closes in on the killer and the truth. Ultimately, he will risk everything and stop at nothing to save the next innocent from becoming the last victim.\n\nThe film’s cast also includes Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Chloe Moretz and Jessica Chastain."
