        "text": "For centuries, the work of the press has informed and shaped our everyday lives. Whether it be our perception of the world around us or the many debates over even the most meaningless of news topics, the distribution of factual and analytical reporting has influenced us all.\n\nAs such, it only makes sense that journalism is a recurring feature of any film plot that either includes or addresses newsworthy stories. A headline in the paper, a reporter at the scene and a news anchor behind the desk; the press are represented across a range of genres, as both heroes and villains.\n\nThe importance of journalism in society has inevitably led to some films directly focusing on the role of the press, in stories based on both reality and fiction. Pursuers of truth, corruption and of course, a good story, journalists in film can represent the very best and worst that humanity has to offer. With a long history of cinematic portrayals, this film will look at ten of the greatest journalism films of all time.\n\nThe Killing Fields is as of much a story about journalism as it is about survival. An adaptation of Sydney Schanberg devastating New York Times report on the Cambodian genocide, the film portrays the experiences of Schanberg and fellow journalist Dith Pran. Through the perspective of these two reporters, the powerful epic is a brutal exploration into the systematic persecution and various other crimes against humanity committed by the Khmer Rouge regime.\n\nAs one of the most gripping and harrowing cinematic depictions of war crimes ever made, The Killing Fields received widespread critical acclaim. Recipient of seven Oscar nominations, of which it won three, the film's production quality and message still holds up to this day.\n\nHaing S. Ngor (Pran) was the biggest breakthrough performance of the film. Just like the character he portrayed, Ngor was too a survivor of the genocide, escaping to Thailand after four years in a authoritarian labour camp. With no acting experience, Ngor's performance was first of a tragically cut-short acting career. Awarded with the Best Supporting Actor award at the 1985 Oscars, Ngor became just the second non-actor to win an academy award in actor category."
