        "text": "ON Jan. 20, 1980, The New York Times Magazine published a remarkable memoir, ''The Death and Life of Dith Pran,'' by Sydney Schanberg, then The Times's metropolitan editor and today a Times columnist but who, from 1972 until 1975, was The Times's correspondent in Cambodia, covering the decline and fall of the United States-backed Lon Nol regime in its civil war with the Communist Khmer Rouge forces.\n\nMr. Schanberg received the 1976 Pulitzer Prize and a number of other awards for his pieces filed from Phnom Penh, but not until ''The Death and Life of Dith Pran'' was he able, at last, to come to terms with the experience he had lived through and that, subsequently, haunted him.\n\nNot for nothing does the magazine piece carry the subhead, ''A Story of Cambodia.''\n\n''The Death and Life of Dith Pran'' is, in Mr. Schanberg's words, about Cambodia ''as a nation pushed into the war by other powers, not in control of its destiny, being used callously as battle fodder, its agonies largely ignored as the world focused its attention on neighboring Vietnam.''\n\nThat's a large subject but Mr. Schanberg was finally able to comprehend it - and to allow us to share that comprehension - in his moving, precisely detailed recollection of a single friendship. The friend was Dith Pran, his Cambodian assistant for three years, the man who saved his life and those of several other correspondents when the victorious Khmer Rouge occupied Phnom Penh. Mr. Schanberg's agony was that he was not able to protect Mr. Dith when the Khmer Rouge began their systematic purge of all educated Cambodians and especially those who had worked with the Americans during the previous regime.\n\nWhile Mr. Schanberg and other Western correspondents were still in sanctuary in the French Embassy in Phnom Penh in 1975, Dith Pran slipped out of the compound and disappeared. In the years that followed, almost everybody except Mr. Schanberg, who returned to New York, eventually assumed Dith Pran to be dead, one of the estimated three million out of seven million Cambodians who were either massacred by the Khmer Rouge or died of starvation or disease.\n\nThat Dith Pran did survive provided the shape and the heart of the Schanberg memoir.\n\nAll this needs saying by way of introduction to ''The Killing Fields,'' the ambitious, serious new film that, with great care and respect, has been based on ''The Death and Life of Dith Pran.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
