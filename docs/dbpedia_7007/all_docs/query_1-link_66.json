        "text": "Warner Brothers Pictures was incorporated in 1923 by the four Warner brothers, Harry, Albert, Sam and Jack. The company had begun its movie making career earlier however, when it produced its first film in 1918. In 1925 Warner Bros. acquired the Vitagraph Company, in Brooklyn, New York, expanding its holdings from the East to the West coast. Warner Bros. pioneered sound motion pictures with Don Juan (1926) and The Jazz Singer (1927). Additional purchases in the twenties included First National Pictures and Fox West Coast Theatres. During the thirties and forties, Warner Bros. entertained the American public with such classic films as The Public Enemy (1931), The Story of Louis Pasteur (1936), The Adventues of Robin Hood (1938), Dark Victory (1939), The Maltese Falcon (1941), Casablanca (1943), Mildred Pierce (1945), Johnny Belinda (1948) and White Heat (1949).\n\nWarner Bros. entered the age of television in the fifties. Financial difficulties in the sixties, however, resulted in a takeover by Seven Arts Productions, Ltd. In 1969, the company was acquired by Kinney National Services, Inc. and the newly formed Warner Communications, Inc. became the entertainment arm of Kinney's corporation which produced financially successful films such as Gremlins, Lethal Weapon and Batman. In 1989 Warner Bros. was bought by Time, Inc. The new corporation is now known as Time-Warner.\n\nThe Warner Brothers production slides consist of publicity and production color slides for motion pictures produced or distributed by Warner Brothers Studio from 1979 until 1991. Early years of the collection contain many gaps with the first film being a 1979 release followed next by a 1983 release. From 1987, however, the collection is relatively complete. Some productions contain many images and a full record of the picture while other productions only have one image. Some of the motion pictures with significant numbers of images include The Color Purple, Little Shop of Horrors, Empire of the Sun, Innerspace, Lethal Weapon, The Lost Boys, The Witches of Eastwick, Tequila Sunrise, Above the Law, The Accidental Tourist, Arthur 2, Beetlejuice, Clara's Heart, Clean and Sober, A Cry in the Dark, Dangerous Liaisons, Everybody's All-American, Feds, Batman, Bert Rigby, You're a Fool, Cookie, Her Alibi, Driving Miss Daisy, In Country, Lethal Weapon 2, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, See You in the Morning, Tango & Cash, Young Einstein, Men Don't Leave, Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead, New Jack City and Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves.
