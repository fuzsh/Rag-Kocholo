        "text": "HAMPTON COUNTY, S.C. (WCSC) - The only surviving son of disbarred Lowcountry attorney and convicted killer Alex Murdaugh has filed a defamation lawsuit in Hampton County.\n\nThe suit, filed by Richard “Buster” Alexander Murdaugh Jr. claims that multiple media companies, including Warner Bros, Netflix and Gannett Co., and Michael DeWitt Jr. “falsely accused” him of being involved in the murder of Stephen Smith.\n\nGannett is the company that publishes the Hampton County Guardian newspaper, and DeWitt is listed as an editor of the newspaper, the lawsuit states.\n\nThe body of Stephen Smith was found on Sandy Run Road in Hampton County on July 8, 2015. An autopsy determined Smith died from injuries after he was struck by a vehicle.\n\nSLED reopened the case in June 2021, shortly after the murders of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh based on information discovered during that initial investigation. However, investigators have not said what information they found during the Murdaugh investigation that led them to take a second look at the Smith case.\n\nNo one has ever named any of the Murdaughs as suspects in connection with Smith’s death.\n\nThe lawsuit lists Blackfin, Inc., Warner Bros, Discovery, Inc., Warner Media Entertainment Pages, Inc., Campfire Studio, Inc., The Cinemart LLC, Netlfix, Inc., Gannett Co., Inc. as defendants.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery, Inc. and Blackfin Inc. produced the series “Murdaugh Murders: Deadly Dynasty”, which according to suit, includes a ten-minute segment that alluded to Buster as the murderer of Smith. The series was distributed through Discovery+ and the Investigation Discovery channel.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery, Inc. and Campfire Studios Inc., who created and produced “Low Country: The Murdaugh Dynasty”, are included because of allegations of false statements that suggest Buster, along with his friends, murdered Stephen Smith by striking him with a baseball bat.\n\nAccording to the suit, the show accused Murdaugh of murdering Stephen Smith because of his sexual identity. The series was distributed through HBO Max, now known as Max.\n\nNetflix’s series “Murdaugh Murders: A Southern Scandal” depicts “a young man with red hair carrying a baseball bat,” the lawsuit states. The series also includes statements that imply the Murdaughs, specifically Buster, were involved in Smith’s death. The Cinemart LLC created, produced and profited from the series.\n\nDeWitt, the only individual listed in the suit, appeared in the Netflix series and discussed his time as an editor of the Hampton County Guardian.\n\nIn the documentary, DeWitt was recorded saying the following:\n\n“We were hearing all of these rumors about a possible connection.”\n\n“There is some truth to it.”\n\n“We could not put the Murdaugh name in the story unless we wanted to face lawsuits. We said a prominent well-known family was rumored to be involved. Everyone knew who we were talking about. We published the story and we waited. People would come up to me in the Piggly Wiggly and pat me on the back. We’re so thankful you had the courage to run the story. We did everything but put the Murdaugh name in the story.”\n\n“I began to have a bad taste in my mouth about the members of the Murdaugh family as many people in the community did.”\n\n“The statements were made with reckless indifference to the truth,” the lawsuit stated regarding DeWitt’s time on the documentary.\n\nThe lawsuit claims Murdaugh’s reputation has been “irreparably damaged, and he has suffered mental anguish.” His attorneys say Murdaugh is seeking actual damages, punitive damages and the costs of the lawsuit.\n\nShaun Courtney Kent, the attorney representing Murdaugh, has not yet responded to a request for comment on the lawsuit."
