        "text": "Biographical History\n\nEd Bleier (1929- ) is an American radio and television executive. His career has paralleled the history of electronic media, with important roles in \"new media\" creation for Warner Bros., Warner Communications, and Time Warner. As of 2007 he was a board member of Blockbuster Inc., CKX Inc, and of RealNetworks, whose focus is streaming media over the Internet.\n\nBleier began his professional career with WNEW's \"High School Hour\" and The Long Island Press. He wrote for the Syracuse (New York) Herald Journal and for several Syracuse-area radio stations, and managed promotion for the DuMont Television Network and New York's Channel 5. In the early 1950s, while working at New York's Channel 7 and later at ABC, he instituted television-time sales to movie companies.\n\nWhile studying at Syracuse University he worked as a copyboy for ABC News, and by the 1960s he was a senior executive there, having worked as Vice President for Daytime and Children's Programming and Sales; General Sales Management; and Marketing, Public Relations and Strategic Planning. Among his \"firsts\" at ABC were the first integration of African-American characters in daytime dramas and establishing ABC's first Saturday morning children's block, built around Warner Bros. Bugs Bunny/Looney Tunes cartoons. Over 40 years he oversaw some 100 variations of Looney Tunes programming on ten different cable and broadcast networks, propelling the characters into the top slots in both television and licensing/retail.\n\nBleier left ABC (succeeded there by Disney executive Michael Eisner) to become President of Warner Bros. Domestic Pay-TV, Cable and Network Features division, where he worked closely with Warner's cable systems to develop basic and pay-tv networks including MTV, Nickelodeon, TMC and others; co-created the corporate plan for home video; drove after-market sales of TV series and feature films to record-breaking levels; and pioneered new digital media markets such as content-on-demand and pay-per-view. From 2002 to 2005, Bleier served as Senior Adviser to the company.\n\nIn 2003 Bleier wrote the New York Times best-seller The Thanksgiving Ceremony, a work which grew out of his own first-generation American experiences (the book's foreword was written by well-known columnist and Syracuse University alumnus William Safire).\n\nBleier's pro bono work has included serving as steering committee chairman for 13 of the Aspen Institute's Communications Leaders Conferences, meetings which encourage dialogue between the communications industry's senior creative and business executives and their counterparts in government, economics and science. He was chairman of the Center for Communication, President of the International Radio and Television Society, Vice-Chairman of the International Television Council, Chairman of the Academy of the Arts of East Hampton's Guild Hall, and a former board member of the Keystone Center for Science and Environment and the Martha Graham Dance Company. He has participated in two United Nations World TV Forums and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a trustee of the Charles Dana Foundation.\n\nReturn to top\n\nScope and Contents of the Collection\n\nThe Edward Bleier Papers consist of 50 years of accumulated professional memorabilia and material covering the history of television (including books, industry, references, business plans, etc.) and animation (the classic Looney Tunes), various movies, posters, art books and pictures, architecture, audio tapes, etc. The collection is divided into nine series.\n\nAnimation files consist of professional working papers, documents and contracts about Warner Brothers animation characters: Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Road Runner. This series includes correspondence with the animator Chuck Jones on various projects. There are also folders of deal work for all three television networks regarding cartoon programming. Of particular interest are a copy of the complete movie storyboards for Daffy Duck's Fantastic Island.\n\nCable files consist of internal documents and correspondence relating to the development of basic and pay-TV networks and pay-per-view digital media markets.\n\nLicensing files comprise the bulk of the collection, and center on the licensing of Warner Brothers movies on network, cable and pay-per-view television channels. The documents with each movie vary but consist mainly of ratings analysis, negotiations, sales pitches, and general correspondence. Many films include notes from Bleier's office to movie directors on editing \"objectionable\" material, such as nudity or foul language, to allow for presentation on network television. Also included are documents regarding an appeal to the Motion Picture Association of America regarding the rating of the popular film, All the President's Men.\n\nMedia consist mainly of videotapes of lectures given by Bleier and his television appearance on Martha Stewart Living. There are also various Warner Brothers screeners and copies of speeches by Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick.\n\nMemorabilia contains miscellaneous commemorative industry \"thank you\" gifts, most commemorating conferences, anniversaries, and cable networks functions. There are also a few photographs and clippings.\n\nMiscellaneous material contains an assortment of papers, clippings, brochures, and other miscellaneous material.\n\nPrinted material contains network TV program reports from 1987-1993 on cable television development and Warner Brothers TV movie distribution. This series also contains material and programs for awards and parties, such as the Guild Hall.\n\nProject files contain a broad collection of working papers and projects throughout Bleier's career, including correspondence, deal work, contracts and working documents for individuals such as Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, Greg Ford, Hal Geer, Jeff Bergman and Terry Lennon. Other projects include the creation of home video VCRs, the New York Cosmos Soccer Team revival, and facility information on Rockefeller Center/Radio City Music Hall.\n\nThanksgiving Ceremony files center on the preparation and publication of Bleier's book The Thanksgiving Ceremony published in 2003. There is extensive research on Thanksgiving recipes and research on the holiday as well as partial and full drafts of the book, e-mail correspondence and sales agreements. Events surrounding the book's publication are represented by book release party information, invitations and book reviews.\n\nReturn to top"
