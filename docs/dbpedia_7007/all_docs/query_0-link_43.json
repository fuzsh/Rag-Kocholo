The film took home Best Supporting Actor, Best Editing and Best Cinematography at the 1985 Oscars (for films released in 1984). It was also nominated for four other major categories that year including Best Picture, Screenplay, Actor and Director. The film is directed by Roland Joffe, whom most recently I remember directed that Elisha Cuthbert horror movie Captivity, and has a cast of Sam Waterston, John Malkovich, Craig T Nelson, Julian Sands and Haing S Ngor (who won the Oscar for this role).

He convinces his friend and translator Dith Pran (Ngor) to stay with him to report on the bloodbath perpetrated by one of the most brutal regimes of the 20th century and on the United States ‘ role in precipitating the horror. The two continue to work until the Khmer Rouge, the terrorist government that killed nearly 3 million, arrests them. Schanberg is eventually released and returns to New York . Pran is sent for execution but barely manages a daring escape from the killing fields and from Cambodia .
