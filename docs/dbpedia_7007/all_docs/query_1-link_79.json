        "text": "What is the responsibility of a studio that produces a major film depicting a huge governmentwide conspiracy in the killing of President John F. Kennedy?\n\nWith the release of Oliver Stone's movie \"J. F. K.,\" the film community is asking about the ethical, artistic and even legal responsibility of the studio, Warner Brothers, which released the $40 million film that asserts Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone and may not even have fired a shot in the Kennedy assassination. Instead, the movie, which opened Friday around the nation, implicates, directly and indirectly, the White House, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States military, big business, anti-Castro Cubans, the Dallas police force and an assortment of fringe figures in New Orleans.\n\nHollywood is vexed by the film, and no movie in recent years has stirred the kind of discussion here that \"J. F. K.\" has.\n\nAt issue is whether Warner Brothers, in helping finance and distribute the movie, adheres to Mr. Stone's provocative point of view, which has been attacked by critics in newspapers and magazines as a distortion of the facts. Or does Warner Brothers, like any studio, produce its films for one reason, to make money, brushing aside the artistic, political, moral and ethical implications of any film, including \"J. F. K.,\" which had the substantial involvement of the town's most powerful agency, Creative Artists Agency, representing Mr. Stone, the film's star, Kevin Costner, and numerous other actors.\n\nOne of the top producers in Hollywood, echoing a view commonly expressed here about the film business in general, said political and ethical questions about a film like \"J. F. K.\" were simply dwarfed by money considerations: \"All these guys sit in a room, look at what a picture will cost, look at Oliver's talent and track record, look at the fact that they'll get Costner and they say, 'This is a good roll of the dice for us.' All the rest really doesn't count.\" The Role of the Studio\n\nAt the moment the issue confronting Hollywood is does a studio -- or for that matter its parent company, Time Warner -- view its role as merely giving total free rein to a prominent director and, in the process, hope to turn the movie into a financial success? Or at what point does a studio exercise its leverage and blunt the highly charged message of a film maker like Oliver Stone?\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
