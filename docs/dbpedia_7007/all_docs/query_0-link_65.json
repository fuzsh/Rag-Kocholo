        "text": "President Nixon's Secret Bombing of Cambodia\n\n2404 Words | 5 Pages\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the most controversial war the United States had ever been involved in during its rich two-hundred year history would engulf the country, ultimately leading to the collapse of a president, and the division of a nation. The Vietnam War was a military struggle fought in Vietnam and neighboring countries from 1959-1975 involving the North Vietnamese and NLF (National Liberation Front) versus the United States and the South Vietnamese (\"The Vietnam...\"). In 1969, newly elected President Richard M. Nixon, aiming to achieve \"peace with honor\" in Vietnam, began to put his \"Vietnamization\" policy into place -- removing the number of American military personnel in the country and transferring combat roles to the South Vietnamese (\"Speeches...\"). But at the same time, Nixon resumed the secret bombing of North Vietnam and launched B-52 bombing raids over Cambodia, intending to wipe out NLF and North Vietnamese base camps along the border. The intensive secret bombing, codenamed Operation Menu, lasted for four years and was intentionally concealed from the American public; meanwhile, Nixon ordered the invasion of Cambodia by United States troops, arguing that it was necessary to protect the security of American units. This invasion into an allegedly neutral country was cause for much protest in the States, especially on college campuses such as Kent State University, where students rioted and held walk-outs. Ultimately, the secret bombing of neutral Cambodia was deliberately conducted without the consent of Congress, violating the articles outlined in the United States Constitution, and would have been grounds for impeachment had Nixon not resigned under the cloud of the Watergate scandal in August of 1974 (\"Richard M....\n\nFilm Analysis Of The Movie: Imitation Of Life\n\n1743 Words | 4 Pages\n\nThis paper entitled, Imitation of Life is based on the movie Imitation of Life. This movie is set in the 1940s. In the movie, an African American woman by the name of Annie becomes the care taker of a Caucasian woman's (Lora) daughter, Susie. In the movie, the caretaker Annie has a daughter named Sarah Jane. Sarah Jane is the product of a rape, performed by a Caucasian man, which results in her being fair skinned and able to pass as a Caucasian woman, which she does for a long time. Due to the fact this movie focuses on the themes of identity and class, I will use the following psychological views and tests to discuss how psychology can be demonstrated every day. The Kenneth\n\nBook Analysis: The Sacred Willow\n\n1104 Words | 3 Pages\n\nFollowing the personal narrative from the civilians of the time, it is as informative as it is suspenseful and immersive. With that said, the book follows the stories of individuals and not necessarily strictly a timeline, making it confusing at times. There are also a few words and concepts only familiar to a Vietnamese person, which could cause the reader to misunderstood the author’s point. Any foreigners who are interested in the Vietnam War or Vietnamese modern history, in general, will find this book interesting as it shows the reasons behind why the Vietnamese people were fighting so hard. On the other hand, younger Vietnamese generations, especially those studying in North America, should also read this book as will help you understand those who fled Vietnam after the Fall of Saigon and be empathetic to why they are so hostile and bitter to modern\n\nMethods used to make Opening Battle Sequence of Saving Private Ryan Shocking and Realistic\n\n1518 Words | 4 Pages\n\n...this really portrays the realism of war. Overall the use of de-saturated film and handheld cameras is an effective way of portraying the film. It does not only portray the film but also realistically portrays war. Scenes which are sometimes horrific or disturbing to watch give us a tiny insight in to the horrific scenes of war. I feel this is the most realistic war film without actually being there. Spielberg successfully took this film to new levels with not always showing brave and noble men. Spielberg has reached the limits of modern film with his effects and constant persistence to find realistic effects. The opening scene is like a starter of a meal or a taste of what is about to come. It shows how these men are brave but scared. I think the film portrays the diversities of emotions experienced by the men. Overall I think this is a realistic and effective film.\n\nThe Murderball Film Analysis\n\n1198 Words | 3 Pages\n\nThis documentary portrays the life of wheelchair-bound individuals that are professional rugby players. A few of the players take the spotlight in this independent film such as; Mark Zupan, Joe Soares, and Keith Cavill. These particular individuals were chosen as the icons of this movie because of their phenomenal spirit and determination. The most heartfelt and inspirational story was of Mark Zupan who plays for the United States Quad Rugby team. He was the victim of a tragic car accident provoked by his best friend who was driving while intoxicated. This misfortune left him paralyzed from the waist down while his friend was unharmed. Zupan is an amazing individual that was able to forgive his friend and still involve him in his life. He\n\nThe Bad And The Beautiful Film Analysis\n\n509 Words | 2 Pages\n\nThe Bad and The Beautiful (1952) and State and Main (2000) are films within films that unmask Hollywood Cinema as a dream factory and expose the grotesque, veneer hidden by the luxury of stars. The Bad and the Beautiful, directed by Vincent Minnelli, is a black and white film narrated in flashback form. The films theatrical nature requires more close-ups than wide-screen shots to capture the character’s psychological turmoil. For example, Fred and Jonathan’s car ride is captured in a close-up to signify their friendship; however their relationship deteriorates after Jonathan’s deceit. While the camera zooms out, Fred stands alone motionless. Here, Fred is captured from a distance at eye-level and he becomes ostracized by the film industry and\n\nAnalysis Of The Movie Fatal Attraction\n\n1380 Words | 3 Pages\n\nFor my final essay, I have chosen the movie “Fatal Attraction”, and I will focus on Alex Forrest and her mental disorder. Borderline Personality was displayed in the movie and Alex had almost every symptom of this disorder. Throughout this essay, I will be discussing Alex’s characteristics, intelligence, motivation, stress, social influences and/ or personality theories, treatment, and if the depiction of the disorder and treatment is consistent with what was discussed and read in the course.\n\nHistorical Inaccuracies In The Devil's Arithmetic\n\n466 Words | 1 Pages\n\nAnother accuracy in this movie was the concentration camps in this movie, they were portrayed very well. Just like history, immediately after arriving at a concentration camp, they were split up and divided by gender and age. As soon as they arrived people who the Nazis did not see fit to work were killed. Along with this people\n\nField Of Dreams Film Analysis\n\n1471 Words | 3 Pages\n\nBesides an initial voiceover narration introducing Ray Kinsella (Kevin Cosner), his beloved wife Annie (Amy Madigan), and their young daughter Karin, this is the first scene in Field of Dreams, released in 1989 and directed by Phil Alden. The voice-over establishes the expectation of the film as being a sensible story about a loving couple trying to run a family farm in Iowa, and the subsequent scene (pictured above) quickly deconstructs that expectation. While working in his field one night, Ray hears a voice whispering “If you build it, he will come.” From then on, there are no more misconceptions about Field of Dreams being anything but an unapologetic fantasy in which an Iowa farmer mows down his fields to build a baseball diamond where\n\nThe Cambodian Genocide\n\n985 Words | 2 Pages\n\nCambodia would become a battle ground for American troops fighting in Vietnam for four years; the war would kill up to 750,000 Cambodians through U.S. efforts to destroy suspected North Vietnamese supply lines. This devastation would take its toll on the Cambodian peoples’ morale and would later help to contribute to the conflicts that caused the Cambodian genocide. In the 1970’s the Khmer Rouge guerrilla movement would form. The leader of the Khmer Rouge, Pol Pot, was educated in France and believed in Maoist Communism. These communist ideas would become important foundations for the ideas of the genocide, and which groups would be persecuted.\n\nAnalysis Of The Film War Horse\n\n1373 Words | 3 Pages\n\nThe movie I chose to analyze for historical accuracy was War Horse. This movie was set in the First World War, starting in Britain but the story also explored France and Germany during this time period as well. Three scenes will be analyzed: the trench warfare scene between the British and the Germans, the scene where the British soldiers were gassed, and the scene where the British were getting patched up and nursed. War Horse does well to stick to the historical accuracy of what happened during the First World War due to the fact that the three scenes that I have chosen to analyze are not embellished and are close to what really happened.\n\nMalick's Badlands Essay\n\n2124 Words | 5 Pages\n\nThe reclusive film director Terrence Malick has to date, only directed a small number of films. His twenty year hiatus between directing Days of Heaven (1978) and The Thin Red Line (1998), may provide the explanation for such a sparse back catalogue. Malick’s refusal to talk with the media, has led to hearsay, as to how he occupied his time during the hiatus. Malick’s directing debut Badlands (1973) is a collection of concepts, all carefully moulded together to create one iconic piece of film. This process draws in and also alienates the audience. Malick’s style is positively noted by critics to be influenced by European philosophy. This is clearly due to Malick’s study of philosophy at Harvard and Magdalen College Oxford. There is no given explanation to the mindless violence featured within the film, mainly due to the films resistance to the straight forward approach. The familiar and the unknown are carefully merged together. The only way of gaining an understanding into the hidden meanings within Badlands is by breaking down the film, by looking at the characters, the use of sound, the visual setting and the films genre. The illusionary effect of Malick’s style means that all is not as it seems."
