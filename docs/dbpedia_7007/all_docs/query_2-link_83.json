        "text": "Continuing my look into the stories behind movie related things we all take for granted, this week’s choice is The Warner Bros. logo.\n\nThe history of Warner Brothers is an interesting one. The brothers Wonskolaser emigrated, together with their parents, from Russian controlled Poland to the United States. Their father changed their surname to Warner. When the brothers were older they started screening the movie The Great Train Robbery in a vacant store, which they called the Bijou. In 1903 they bought a small theater and turned it into a Nickelodeon called the Cascade, where people could watch movies for, as the name implies, a nickle. In 1904 they founded a distribution company and around the time of the first World War they started producing movies. They opened their studio in Hollywood in 1918 and slowly the company began growing and was the first studio to release a talkie in 1927 called The Jazz Singer. For more history on the Warner Brothers I suggest watching the documentary The Brothers Warner.\n\nThrough the years the studio logo went through changes as well.\n\n1923-1929\n\nThe original version of the logo already had a shield (it’s unclear why it was chosen) and the WB, but also a picture of the actual studio.\n\n1929-1936\n\nHere the picture of the studio has disappeared and the letters WB fill the whole shield. The text shows “WARNER BROS. PICTURES, Inc and The Vitaphone Corp. present”\n\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\nVitaphone was a sound film process used on feature films and nearly 1,000 short subjects produced by Warner Bros. and its sister studio First National from 1926 to 1930. Vitaphone was the last, but most successful, of the sound-on-disc processes. The soundtrack was not printed on the actual film, but was issued separately on 16 inch (40 cm) and, later, 12 inch (30 cm) phonograph discs recorded at 33 1/3 rpm, a speed first used for this process. The discs would be played on a turntable indirectly coupled to the projector motor while the film was being projected.\n\n1936-1937\n\nIn the next version of the logo the shield zoomed into view out of the clouds, followed by the text “WARNER BROS. PICTURES, Inc. Present” appearing over it.\n\n1938-1948\n\nThe logo has now has more depth to it and a banner has the text “WARNER BROS. PICTURES, INC.” on it.\n\n1948-1967\n\nThe classic WB logo colors, gold and blue, are introduced. Sometimes the clouds are the background, but it’s also shown superimposed on the movie itself, as is the case in this screenshot from Rope.\n\n1967-1970\n\nAt the end of the sixties a big change was made to the logo as Seven Arts productions acquired a controlling interest in Warner Bros. It appeared in yellow or white and was quite simple.\n\n1970-1972\n\nWhen the newly formed Warner Bros-Seven Arts was acquired by Kinney National Company it decided to drop the Seven Arts from the name and the logo changed again.\n\n1972\n\nOnly used for a very short period, the logo looked like it had in the past.\n\n1972-1984\n\nIn 1972 the logo was redesigned by the legend himself, graphic designer Saul Bass and has a stylised W.\n\n1984-2001\n\nIn 1984 the classic logo returned with not a lot of difference compared to earlier versions.\n\n1998-2011\n\nIn 1998 a CGI version of the logo was introduced which started with a picture of the studios, a ripple going across it and slowly turning to reveal the logo.\n\n2011-\n\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g14nw9zENvI]\n\nThe newest version which transforms into the New Line Cinema logo."
