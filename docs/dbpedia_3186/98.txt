Gervaise Macquart (Maria Schell) is a beautiful Parisian laundress, whose lover, Lantier (Armand Mestral) walks out on her. She eventually marries Henri Coupeau (François Perier), a roofer who has an unfortunate accident. As her now crippled husband descends into alcoholism, Gervaise tries to make ends meet on her own. Life becomes even more complicated when Lantier returns and befriends Henri. Meanwhile, the man she really loves, Goujet (Jacques Harden), is sent to prison.

One of France's most respected directors of the postwar era: René Clément (Forbidden Games) directed this searing psychological drama. “Gervaise”, his vivid 1956 adaptation of Emile Zola's 1877 masterpiece “L'assommoir”, is not to be missed. An uncompromising depiction of a lowly laundress's struggles to deal with a crippled, alcoholic husband while running her own business, “Gervaise” was nominated for an Oscar, and the indomitable Maria Schell earned best actress honors at the Venice Film Festival.

Hailed "Best Film from Any Source" by the British Film Academy. Winner of "International Cinema Press Federation Award" at the Cannes Festival. Winner at the Venice, Berlin and Tokyo Film Festivals.

The pen of Emile Zola...the Paris of Renoir!

Customer review: “Gervaise”, directed by Rene Clement, is one of the most beautifully visual film ever made. This director was certainly blessed with unparalleled artistic ability, and it is a honor and joy to view his films. And, of course, Maria Schell's once in a lifetime performance delivers a real knock-out punch. MUST SEE!
