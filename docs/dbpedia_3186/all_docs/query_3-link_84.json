        "text": "I have given very clear instructions that the French only produce films that are lightweight, empty and, if possible, stupid. I think they'll be content with this.\n\n— Joseph Goebbels, May 1942.\n\nDuring the German occupation, 220 films were made in France, most of them following Goebbels's orders. Among the exceptions were some of the 30 made by Continental, which is odd because Continental, with offices at the corner of the Champs-Elysees and rue Washington, was entirely German-run and financed and was headed by Alfred Greven, a former World War I pilot and friend of Hermann Goering.\n\nFilmmaking at Continental is the subject of Bertrand Tavernier's film \"Laisser-passer,\" which has opened at 20 Paris cinemas. An epic about small acts, it runs nearly three hours and at times is as confused and incoherent as life was then.\n\n\"I didn't want a linear narrative,\" Tavernier says. \"I wanted the camera style to have the instability that people had in their heads, to be as ignorant of what was coming next as the characters were. When they faced an event or a person their understanding was fragmentary and the film tries not to give more information than those people had.\n\n\"I don't really know who Alfred Greven was and neither did people at the time. I wanted to show how people saw him, not what we have learned about him since.\"\n\nWhat is certain about Greven is that he was a professional filmmaker with plenty of money at his disposal and the wish to make good films while conforming to his masters' dictates. He produced turkeys and also enduring classics; he employed collaborators and also Jean-Paul Le Chanois, who was not only Jewish but a Communist. At one point, deploring the shortage of good writers because most of them were Jewish, Greven has the effrontery to ask the scenarist Jean Aurenche if he can recommend any Jewish colleagues to work for him.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
