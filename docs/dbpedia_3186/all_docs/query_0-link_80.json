        "text": "René Clément (1913-96) worked for years on documentaries before making his feature debut immediately after the second world war with La bataille du rail (1946), a celebration of the role of railway workers in the Resistance. It won the international jury prize at the first Cannes film festival, and his most famous movie, Forbidden Games (Les jeux interdits), also about the second world war, won an Oscar as best foreign language movie.\n\nSet in 1940, this delicate, beautifully paced film centres on a middle-class five-year-old (Brigitte Fossey), orphaned by the Luftwaffe while fleeing from Paris, and her new friend, a young peasant lad (Georges Poujouly), who become obsessed with the rituals of burial as the war goes on around them. The film is both deeply moving and darkly comic, and the performances of Poujouly and the infinitely expressive Fossey (both of whom had acting careers as adults) are among the finest ever given by children.\n\nThe disc contains an informative documentary that includes an interview with Fossey, who later appeared in Truffaut's The Man Who Loved Women. As a vitriolic, self-serving spokesman for Cahiers du Cinéma, Truffaut did much to destroy the reputations of Clément and the screenwriters Pierre Bost and Jean Aurenche who wrote Forbidden Games. It's released along with three other Clément films: Gervaise (1956) – his masterly adaptation of Zola's L'Assomoir – and two late thrillers, The Deadly Trap (1971, starring Faye Dunaway and Frank Langella) and And Hope to Die (1972, starring Jean-Louis Trintignant and Robert Ryan)."
