I didn’t know drinks opened that door You giving me the creeps cos you want more I want you to leave and that’s for sure Cos we want more Yeah we want more No you can’t own me I’m not yours Just cos I’m in a skirt Doesn’t invite you no I’ll wear what I want and that is so Cos we want more Yeah we want more There’s a level of respect see that line Don’t cross it with me don’t waste your time This feminine force won’t allow it no This masculine push won’t devour it so It’s our right to say when it’s yes or its no Its our right to say when its fast or its slow As soon as we grasp this the quicker we’ll grow Yeah its our right to say when its yes or its no Cause we want more Yeah we want more And we want more and more and more and more Yeah we want more and more and more and more and more Yeah we want more\n\nSo of course you were supposed to call me tonight You were supposed to call me tonight We would have gone to the cinema And after that to the restaurant The one you like in your street We would have slept together Have a nice breakfast together And then a walk in the park together How beautiful is that? You would have said I love you In the cutest place on earth where some butterflies are dancing with the fairies I would have waited like a week or two But you never tried to reach me No, you never called me back You were dating the bleach blond girl If I find her I swear, I swear I'll kill her I'll kill her She stole my future She broke my dream I'll kill her I'll kill her She stole my future When she took you away I would have met your friends We would have had a drink or two They would have liked me 'Cause sometimes I'm funny I would have met your dad I would have met your mom She would have said Please can you make some beautiful babies? So we would have had a boy called Tom And a girl called Susan born in Japan I said it was a love story But you don't wanna get involved I said it was a love story But you're not ready for that Me neither I'll kill her She stole my future She broke my dream I'll kill her I'll kill her She stole my future When she took you away She's a bitch, you know All she's got is blondness Not even tenderness Yeah, she's clever-less She'll dumped your ass for a model called Brandon He will pay for beautiful surgery 'cause he's full of money I would have waited like a week or two But you never tried to reach me No, you never called me back You were dating the bleach blond girl And if I find her I swear You know I swear I'll kill her I'll kill her She stole my future She broke my dream I'll kill her I'll kill her She stole my future When she took you away I'll kill her I'll kill her She stole my future She broke my dream I'll kill her I'll kill her She stole my future When she took you"
