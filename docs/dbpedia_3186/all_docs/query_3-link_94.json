        "text": "Long non-competes for quants in hedge funds and trading firms are standard, and Citadel and Citadel Securities are no exception. Accordingly, after almost two years of waiting, a quantitative researcher from Citadel Securities, has resurfaced at a high frequency trading in Singapore.\n\nZhenkai Lu joins Tower Research Capital as an on-site quantitative researcher. Lu joined Citadel Securities as a researcher in 2017 and left again in May 2022. Since May 2022, he says he's been on gardening leave.\n\nLu spent the bulk of his tenure in Dublin, working on European and US markets, but moved to Australia for the last year of his employment to work on the Hong Kong single stock option market.\n\nIt's not clear what Lu did while he was out of the market. Pierre Bost, a former PM for Eisler Capital, resigned in July and spent six months as a \"kitesurfing apprentice\", which was apparently his \"penance\" for doing so. He also resurfaced recently, at hedge fund Balyasny in London.\n\nCitadel Securities declined to comment.\n\nClick here to create a profile on eFinancialCareers.
