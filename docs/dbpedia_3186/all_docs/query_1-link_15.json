        "text": "THE French cinema had a long and distinguished existence before the arrival of the New Wave in 1959, but you would barely know it from the handful of older French films released on DVD in the United States.\n\nJean Renoir is well represented, as are Jacques Tati and Jean Cocteau, but filmmakers as celebrated and influential as Julien Duvivier, Henri-Georges Clouzot, Claude Autant-Lara and Yves Allégret barely exist on video apart from a few of their most famous titles.\n\nLast week the Criterion Collection quietly released a few more. The “Essential Art House” collections are box sets, each containing half a dozen titles from the Criterion catalog, presented without Criterion’s copious extras and offered at a discount price ($99.95). The latest volume, the fourth, contains three worthy, familiar movies  Alfred Hitchcock’s “39 Steps” (1935), Akira Kurosawa’s “Throne of Blood” (1957) and Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s “Tales of Hoffmann” (1951)  and three hard-to-find films: Marcel Carné’s 1939 “Jour Se Lève,” previously available only as part of the $850 box “50 Years of Janus Films”; and two Criterion debuts, Anatole Litvak’s 1936 “Mayerling” and René Clément’s 1956 “Gervaise.” (The discs are also available individually for $19.95.)\n\nOf the three only “Le Jour Se Lève” has any real claim to greatness, but together they represent a welcome expansion in the American marketplace of what was once proudly known as the French “tradition of quality.” It was François Truffaut who turned that phrase into a sarcastic opprobrium with his notorious 1954 article, “A Certain Tendency of the French Cinema,” published in Les Cahiers du Cinéma. Truffaut, an ambitious 21-year-old critic, attacked the establishment with such vigor and vitriol that careers were damaged, opening the way for Truffaut and his Cahiers colleagues to lead a new movement in French filmmaking a few years later.\n\nRead today, Truffaut’s piece seems hyperbolic and moralistic, as when he attacks the screenwriters Jean Aurenche and Pierre Bost and the school of psychological realism they represented: “For them, psychological realism inevitably requires that men be base, infamous and vile,” and “the films they write are even more base, vile and spineless than anything French art has produced to date.”\n\nThat seems a bit much to say of “Gervaise,” for example, a film that Aurenche and Bost wrote for their frequent collaborator René Clément, two years after Truffaut’s article appeared. An adaptation of Zola’s 1877 novel “L’Assommoir,” the film softens, if anything, the harsh naturalism of Zola’s work, turning his working-class heroine, Gervaise (Maria Schell), from a hopeless alcoholic into a sprightly go-getter.\n\nOn sets that meticulously recreate 19th-century Montmartre, Gervaise struggles to support herself, her children and her layabout husband (François Périer) by opening a laundry. The film may not be as innovative or exciting as “The 400 Blows,” but it is a skillful, craftsmanlike work. Its principal fault lies in Aurenche and Bost’s desire to do justice to the book’s big set pieces  a fight among women in a washhouse, a wedding dinner that devolves into anarchy  which make the film seem a bit blocky and static.\n\nThe pessimism of “Gervaise” has its roots in the “poetic realism” of the prewar French cinema, a movement bred by the failure of the idealistic Popular Front and the growing threat of war from Hitler’s Germany. It says a lot about the encroaching atmosphere of hopelessness and defeat that both “Mayerling” and “Le Jour Se Lève”  major hits of the period  chronicle spectacular acts of suicide, leading the audience step-by-step toward a pre-ordained conclusion.\n\nThe fatalism of “Mayerling” is historical: the film relates the tragic romance between Crown Prince Rudolph of Austria (Charles Boyer) and Baroness Marie Vetsera (Danielle Darrieux), which culminated in an apparent suicide pact and a scandal that weakened the Austrian empire. The director, Anatole Litvak, was a Ukrainian Jew who had worked in Germany and would leave the next year for Hollywood. His film, particularly as it nears its conclusion in the Mayerling hunting lodge, has a powerfully claustrophobic atmosphere, as if the walls were closing in not merely on the characters but also on the continent as a whole.\n\nGrandly performed by Boyer and Ms. Darrieux, who would reunite in Max Ophuls’s 1953 masterpiece “The Earrings of Madame de...,” the film remains a classic of morbidity, shaped by an emotional authenticity that none of its many remakes achieved (including one by Litvak himself, a 1957 television drama with Audrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrer).\n\nThe fatalism of “Le Jour Se Lève,” by contrast, is expressed in formal terms, most famously in one of the earliest and most influential uses of flashback. So novel was the technique, as devised by the screenwriters Jacques Viot (story) and Jacques Prévert (dialogue), that an opening text was thought necessary to orient the audience: “A man has killed ... trapped and besieged in a hotel room, he recalls the circumstances that made him a murderer.”\n\nThe man is François (Jean Gabin, in a classic performance), a factory worker who seems the embodiment of the dreams and disappointments of the Popular Front. He has killed Valentin (Jules Berry), an oleaginous music hall performer, who taunted François by telling him he slept with both François’ young fiancée (Jacqueline Laurent) and his older mistress (Arletty).\n\nCarné’s direction emphasizes a sense of enclosure and isolation: the interior of François’s hotel room was shot on an unusual, four-sided set (the actors and technicians had to climb in from above); the exterior was a six-story facade that seems to stand alone on a desolate back lot street, built in vertiginous perspective. (The production was designed by the great Alexandre Trauner.)\n\nBoth “Mayerling” and “Le Jour Se Lève” are classic studio films that do nothing to hide their artificiality, a characteristic that also might have irritated the young Truffaut, who would spend at least the first part of his career in pursuit of an antithetical naturalism and spontaneity. Fifty years on we can forgive these films for not being what they were never intended to be. And there’s a whole lot more where they came from.\n\nALSO OUT THIS WEEK\n\nX-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE The Marvel superhero with animal senses, retractable claws and an adamantium skeleton (Hugh Jackman) and how he got that way, directed by the South African filmmaker Gavin Hood (“Tsotsi”). With Liev Schreiber, Taylor Kitsch and Ryan Reynolds. A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times in May that, “the outsize emotions that give any decent superhero epic its adolescent, pop-operatic gravity are diminished by the sheer hectic confusion of the storytelling.” (Fox, Blu-ray $39.99, standard definition $29.99, PG-13)\n\nAN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON John Landis’s deft blend of comedy and horror, starring David Naughton as an American tourist who has a most unfortunate experience on the moors, gets a Blu-ray upgrade and a standard definition remastering. The movie, Janet Maslin wrote in The Times in 1981, “gets off to a wonderful start.” With Jenny Agutter and Griffin Dunne. (Universal, Blu-ray $26.98, standard definition $19.98, R)\n\nSTAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION MOTION PICTURE COLLECTION Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) pilots an updated Starship Enterprise through four feature films spun off from the 1987-1994 television series, now offered in Blu-ray.

Mr. Scott wrote in The Times in April that “there is nothing especially simple about life on the steppe, or, more crucially, about the emotions of the people who dwell on it, and the viewer quickly loses the sense of their foreignness, which is replaced by a feeling of recognition.” (Zeitgeist, $29.99, not rated)"
