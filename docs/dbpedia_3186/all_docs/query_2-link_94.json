Like the Georgian belle that she is, her office is evocative of her femininity and elegance, with a modern twist (see her reception area and powder-room wallpaper!).

        "text": "Thanks to L’Oréal Paris USA____, I recently got an opportunity to visit Dr. Gervaise Gerstner____, one of New York’s top cosmetologists and the consulting dermatologist to L’Oréal Paris USA as the brand’s ambassador, at her very pretty Park Avenue office. Like the Georgian belle that she is, her office is evocative of her femininity and elegance, with a modern twist (see her reception area and powder-room wallpaper!). And she was absolutely beaming, not only because of her latest beauty obsessions, but also because she fell in love not too long ago and recently got married to a major Texas gentleman.\n\nSo, I asked her:\n\nS.H.G.: What are you really into lately that is giving you such radiance, other than your newly-wedded-bliss glow?\n\nG.G.: Well, I am currently obsessed with 1) face masks; 2) essences (i.e., toning waters); 3) cleansing oils; 4) Clarisonic-Pro____; 5) fat dissolution.\n\nS.H.G.: O.K., I’m totally down with all that, but please elaborate!\n\nG.G.: I think that the concept of infusing or customizing a face mask (think Hannibal Lecter) with lightening-brightening treatment is on the horizon, and the ones out there could be better, hence my excursion to Seoul, Korea, buying up every single face masks that I could pack into my luggage! But for the U.S. market, I really like the Skinceutical mask____, which is reasonable in price. I am endlessly in search of that two- or three-day glow mask—and I like the idea of developing with a customized aspect.\n\nS.H.G.: O.M.G, I am off to Seoul in April and I cannot wait until I get there to do further research! I'll come down and we can compare notes. In the meantime, \"dissolution of fat,\" do tell!"
