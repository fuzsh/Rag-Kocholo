        "text": "Gervaise Ollivander was a pure-blood wizard who came from a long line of wandmakers who had operated in Diagon Alley since his earliest ancestors arrived in England with the Romans, and set up stall (subsequently shop) to sell to ancient British wizards. He was the son of Gerbold Octavius Ollivander, and the father of Garrick Ollivander.[3]\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nGervaise Ollivander was born before 1890 likely,[1] somewhere in Great Britain. He was born into the wizarding Ollivander family, who had been in the wand-making business since 382 B.C.[3]\n\nCareer as a wandmaker[]\n\nGervaise took up the family business in London, studying further into wandlore and becoming an accomplished wandmaker.[3]\n\nHe and his wife, a Muggle-born witch, had at least one child, Garrick sometime in, or prior to, 1909.[3]\n\nAccording to Gervaise, it was impossible to fool a wizard or witch who carried a wand of cedar wood, an opinion that his son shared.[3]\n\nAs it was practise at the time, a customer would often present the wandmaker with a magical substance to which they were attached, or had inherited, or by which their family swore.[3] As such, Gervaise used a wide variety of wand cores. Early in his career, his son Garrick saw his father working with substandard wand core materials such as Kelpie hair, Kneazle whisker and troll whisker. It was then that he conceived the ambition to work with only the finest cores, and thus discover the ideal wand.[3]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nPottermore (Mentioned only)\n\nWizarding World (Mentioned only)\n\nNotes and references[]"
