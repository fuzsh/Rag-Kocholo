        "text": "IF ever there was a director who could be expected to put upon the screen a faithful pictorial representation of Emile Zola's most sharp and scorching works, that director is the Frenchman René Clement. It was he who made \"The Battle of the Rails,\" a vivid drama of the sabotage activities of French Resistance railway workers in World War II. It was he who also directed that brilliant anti-war film, \"Forbidden Games,\" an ironic study of war-torn children. He's the man for Zola, that's for sure.And he has proved it beyond the slightest question in his mordant French film, \"Gervaise,\" a screen translation of Zola's \"L'Assommoir\" (\"The Dram Shop\"), which opened at the Baronet yesterday. Gervaise is the name of the heroine—the mother of Nana, by the way—and she is beautifully, tragically played here by the fine German actress Maria Schell.Those who have read and remembered Zola's excruciating tale of indigent working-class Parisians around the middle of the last century will have in their minds some powerful images of life in the squalid, reeking slums—of tender acts and cruel ones, poignant aspirations and dark despairs. These images will not be violated. M. Clement has put them on the screen in a style of pictorial naturalism that has scarcely been matched since Erich von Stroheim's classic \"Greed.\"He and his brilliant screen writers, Jean Aurenche and Pierre Bost—the same who prepared the screenplays for the memorable \"Devil in the Flesh\" and \"Forbidden Games\"—do not let us off from one iota of the squalor and cruelty in this story of a poor, abused young mother who struggles valiantly but vainly to survive.There's the business of her being deserted by the worthless father of her two small children at the start and her consequent guttersnipe battle with a neighborhood vixen on a sloppy laundry floor. There is unblinking recognition of the ruttishness of the human herd and shattering displays of the dipsomania and the complex jealousy of the weakling artisan the heroine weds. There's a climactic scene in which this fellow has delirium tremens to such an extent that he tumbles his piteous world about him. It is a scene filled with horror and shame.But M. Clement has also worked into his picture some of Zola's more compassionate, human scenes, and these he has done with glowing humor, affection and loveliness. For instance, the marriage of Gervaise with the man who later brings their life to ruin is a beautifully simple envisioning of the complexities of hope and tenderness. And the sequence of Gervaise's birthday party, with its wonderfully clear little looks at the natures of various little people and its flow of dramatic interludes, is as charming a section of footage as any adult could ask to see. These blendings of the happy with the dolorous complete the picture's theme of irony.While Fraeulein Schell is undoubtedly the matchless focal figure in this film and plays it with a range of feminine feeling that fairly staggers one with awe and sympathy, she is brilliantly assisted. François Perier as the poor chap she weds gives a desolating demonstration of the erosion of confidence and hope. Armand Mestral is slick as her cheap lover, Suzy Delair is sly as the local shrew and Jacques Harden is dignified and tender as a bearded blacksmith who loves Gervaise in vain. Little Chantal Gozzi plays Nana as a child and is elevated by M. Clement's camera (and his feeling for the raw candor of children) into a formidable symbol of a future peril.An excellent musical score by Georges Auric, sensitive black-and-white camera-work and even good English subtitles assist in making this two-hour-long film a deeply moving flow of human revelation, one of the best the screen has offered this year."
