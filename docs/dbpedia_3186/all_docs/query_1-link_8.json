        "text": "Excellent adaptation of the Emile Zola novel L'Assommoir which captures the earthiness of life for the Parisian working class in the 19th century. Maria Schell won the Best Actress award at Venice for the title role, a laundress battling through the obstacles that fate and the fickle men in her life place in her path. Schell is outstanding and is surrounded by a phalanx of capable character actors who breathe life into their sharply written roles.\n\nRené Clément paces the story perfectly and exhibits a great eye for detail, such as the mud that cakes the Sunday best outfits of the guests on Gervaise's wedding day. The environment they inhabit is wonderfully realised and loses the sense of being a…\n\nGERVAISE (1956) France, b/w, 112m.\n\nDirected by René Clement.\n\nScreenplay by Jean Aurenche, based on the 1876 novel \"L'Assommoir\" by Émile Zola. Part of Zola's twenty-volume Les Rougon-Macquart series.\n\nMaria Schell has the title role of Gervaise, a good-natured, hard-working laundress with two children.\n\nArmand Mestral is the leisure and unreliable cad she lives with, but also the father to her children.\n\nFrancois Périer is a good-natured and good-working plumber that marries Gervaise when she is deserted by her man.\n\nJacques Harden is a friend of the couple Périer-Schell.\n\nA good man and a reliable friend.\n\nSuzy Delair is a formidable opponent to her enemies.\n\nAll of the film is EXCELLENT; full of Zola's 19th century Paris with authentic-looking environment,…\n\nThis is a superb and faithful adaptation of one of the best novels by my favorite author, Emile Zola. Director René Clément perfectly recreates the time period, mood, and atmosphere of Zola's 1877 novel L'Assommoir. The story charts one woman's gradual descent from a promising future into poverty, alcoholism, and vice. Shot in silvery tones of black and white, the film is set in a neighborhood that looks like a dirtier version of a Gustave Caillebotte painting straight out of the 1870s. Maria Schell is both enchanting and pathetic in her virtuoso performance as Gervaise, and the entire supporting cast is excellent. Zola was a pioneer when it came to writing novels with working-class protagonists. His works often show that…"
