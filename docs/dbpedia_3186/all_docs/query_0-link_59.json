        "text": "THE WATCHMAKER OF ST PAULS\n\nFrance, 1973, 100 minutes, Colour.\n\nPhilippe Noiret, Jean Rochefort.\n\nDirected by Bertrand Tavernier.\n\nThe Watchmaker of St. Paul's is a successful first film by French director Bertrand Tavernier. It boasts excellent performances by its two stars, fine actors in so many French films in the '70s and '80s. The screenplay is by Jean Aurenche and Pierre Bost, authors of so many adaptations of classic novels to French films in the '50s e.g. Stendahl's The Red and the Black, Zola's Gervaise and Rene Clement's Forbidden Games. They were not in favour by the New Wave but Tavernier worked with them in the '70s - in the post-New Wave French cinema. The screenplay is based on a novel by George Simenon. The Watchmaker of Everton. Set in America, the story has been transferred back to France. The film is a police story but focuses very much on the character of the watchmaker, his values and their being shaken by the events in which his son is involved. There is a lot of political and social comment on France in the '70s. The setting is Lyons. Tavernier's own city. As a point of curiosity, the watchmaker character appears briefly in a sequence from Tavernier's 1980 film A Week's Vacation. It helps update the audiences with what has happened in the meantime.\n\n1. The style of French film of the '70s? A move back to traditional film-making from the New wave?
