        "text": "Ohorongo Cement in Namibia has partnered with Carbo Namibia, a Namibian manufacturer and exporter of charcoal products, in an attempt to increase its energy saving initiatives and lower its carbon footprint.\n\nOhorongo initially approached local charcoal producers within the Otjozondjupa region to procure charcoal fines to utilise as alternative fuel. Prior to Ohorongo procuring the fines, it was essentially a waste product, as it was not viable for export purposes. Through their supply agreement with Ohorongo, local charcoal suppliers can now sell the byproduct, creating employment and additional income. At the same time, the quantities of coal imported as fuel is reduced and less local currency is spent on foreign markets.\n\nOhorongo has recently taken delivery of a 80m3 side tipper to receive volumes of charcoal at the cement plant.\n\nCurrently, Ohorongo uses 58 per cent wood chips, 28 per cent RDF and 14 per cent charcoal, with the total share of alternative fuel use to date being 42.7 per cent, with a target of 56 per cent by 2020 and a long-term target of 80 per cent, reports New Era Live.\n\nPublished under Cement News"
