        "text": "#Bitumen is a #hydrocarbon #material, #black and #paste-like, which is most widely used in #moisture #insulation and #asphalt #construction. Due to the fact that #bitumen is a #petroleum #derivative and its #production is carried out in #oil #refineries, it has different #grades and types, each of which has a special #application. In this article, we will examine the situation of bitumen in the #Iranian and world #market, and we will give some tips on how to supply this #valuable #material in the commodity #exchange. #Globalbitumen #market #status The #important feature of #bitumen is its #impermeability to water and its #adhesion. In general, more than 100 million tons of #bitumen are used in the #world, of which about 40% is #consumed in #Asia. The share of #America and the #Caribbean is about 30% and 18% is consumed in #European #countries. #Russia and #CIS #countries account for 7% of #consumption, and #Africa and #Oceania together account for 5% of the total global #bitumen #consumption. www.faragambitumen.com\n\nIs #Ghana not rich in any #natural #resources? Let's find out below as we focus on them for this week's Country Potential Series. #Ghana, a West African country, is rich in natural resources that have significantly shaped its economy and development. These resources include #gold, #cocoa, #timber, #oil, and #bauxite. #Gold mining sector: Ghana is the leading producer of gold in Africa and ranks among the top 10 gold-producing countries globally (Ghana Chamber of Mines, 2021). #Agriculture: Ghana is also the world's second-largest cocoa producer, supporting the livelihoods of over 800,000 smallholder farmers (Ghana Cocoa Board, 2021). #Timber: Including diverse species of trees (teak, Ceiba, abachi, mahogany) provide employment and raw materials for the wood products industry (Forestry Commission of Ghana, 2020). #Oil and gas industry: Exploitation of offshore oil reserves is opening up new opportunities for economic growth and investment in the energy sector ( Ghana National Petroleum Corporation, 2021). These resources remain a foundation for future progress and prosperity.\n\nmore than 200,000 of these super bred tenera oil palm seedlings are still available at Okitipupa Oil Palm Plc. you can book for yours before they are all sold out in preparations for 2024 planting season @ #1,500/seedling.

The emerging standout in Southern Africa's fertilizer industry is causing waves in the sub-region with a firm commitment to achieving self-sufficiency in fertilizer supply, significant investments, and the establishment of major compound and chemical fertilizer complexes in Zambia and Zimbabwe. Yaochi Huang, the Founder & CEO of United Fertilizer Capital (UFC) Limited, has already commenced operations in Zambia with a new NPK steam granulation plant, making UFC the largest producer of NPKs in the SADC region. This venture attracted a substantial $250 million investment. Furthermore, Mr. Huang has allocated over $590 million for the construction of a coal-based urea production plant in Zambia, nearing completion. Not content with these accomplishments, Mr. Huang intends to expand further by investing an additional $700 million to replicate the operations in Zambia, building NPK and urea plants in Zimbabwe. These endeavours are truly impressive, which is why AFRIQOM has decided to focus on Zambia for its next Africa Fertilizer Conference. The AFRIQOM Fertilizer Club Africa Conference is scheduled to take place in Zambia from the 10th to the 12th of June. During the conference, we'll have the opportunity to be live in the Zambian Ecosystem.
