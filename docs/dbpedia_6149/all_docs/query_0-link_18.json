        "text": "Namibia: The Industrial Development Corporation (IDC), a South African development finance institution, says it would like to increase its share in Ohorongo Cement. It has made the statement in response to the acquisition of a majority stake in the cement producer by Singaporeâ€™s International Cement Group in March 2019, according to the Namibian Sun newspaper.\n\nThe IDC owns a 14% stake in Ohorongo Cement. It says it is committed to Ohorongo Cement and that it wants to support Namibia's indigenisation programme through local ownership. It is talking to other shareholders including the Development Bank of Namibia (DBN), which owns an 11% stake in Ohorongo. The DBN has also expressed concerns on the takeover by International Cement Group."
