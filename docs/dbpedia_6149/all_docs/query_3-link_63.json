        "text": "OPUWO -- 28 Nov 2023 (NAMPA) Twenty-five Opuwo youths have received brickmaking and business skills training, along with a starter pack to start their own businesses, from the FirstRand Namibia Foundation Trust and Ohorongo Cement.\n\nThe two-day training was held at the Opuwo Urban Constituency office last week.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, FNB Commercial Relationship Manager Kaarina Matheus highlighted the significant role skills development plays in Namibia's economic growth agenda.\n\n'Namibia needs advanced technical and vocational skills, in addition to a flexible workforce that can adjust to rapid shifts in demand especially in the construction sector. That's why we are here today. We believe that by investing in programmes such as the brickmaking training initiative, we will empower the youth of Opuwo to play an active role in building our communities, while also providing much-needed direct investment in the region,' she said.\n\nThe starter packs consist of various items including a wheelbarrow, safety boots and glasses, gloves, cement, brickmaking moulding and brushes.\n\nThe collaboration between the two entities is valued at over N.dollars 300 000.\n\nIn a speech read on her behalf during the training, Minister of Industrialisation, Trade and SME Development Lucia Iipumbu commended the initiative, saying it marks a significant step towards not just construction of buildings, but towards a more sustainable and empowered community.\n\n'In the face of a challenging employment landscape, this project stands as a beacon of hope, contributing substantially to the socio-economic development of our beloved town. Opuwo town, like many others, grapples with the harsh reality of high unemployment rates. Today, however, we come together to inaugurate more than just a brick-making venture - we inaugurate a catalyst for change, a vehicle for progress, and a source of livelihood for our fellow citizens,' she said."
