This, in turn, is driving ready-mix firms to get creative with the production of concrete. With limited natural sand available, demand for manufactured sand (M-sand) across Turkey is rising. CDE Group’s EvoWash sand wash system assists concrete producers by guaranteeing high-value, in-spec products straight from the belt. Research from Aggregates Europe - UEPG suggests that Turkey was the fourth-largest aggregates producer in Europe in 2022, producing 300 million tonnes of aggregates, including sand and gravel, crushed rock and marine aggregates[1]. CDE currently has 19 EvoWash plants in Turkey, and the number of plants in the market is set to almost double in the near future. #washing #manufacturedsand #turkey Doğan ÖZEL Aimee M. David Kinloch Lauren McMaster Kelly Shields Sarah Corr Clemence Badier Thomas Doyle Eunan Kelly Emma Mc Aleer Laura Burns Amy Conway\n\nHere is an insight into how we produce concrete at the Pharo Ready Mix Concrete batching plant, from start to finish. The journey begins with efficient raw material handling, and employing advanced systems for aggregates, cement, and water storage. Throughout the batching process, precise measurements and a unique mixing method ensure unparalleled quality. Noteworthy is the plant's strict adherence to quality control standards, guaranteeing consistency in every concrete mix. Robust transportation logistics play a crucial role, with multiple vehicles on-site to fulfil local project demands promptly, minimising delays and showcasing our commitment to project timelines and client satisfaction. The introduction of Pharo RMC to the market has made concrete more affordable. It is also providing an opportunity for increased construction projects in Somaliland due to a wider more affordable market. #concreteconstruction #BuildingABetterFuture #safetyawareness #qualityservice #qualityconstruction\n\nWhat is Bitumen 60/70 Uses? Bitumen 60/70 is commonly used in the construction and infrastructure industries. The numbers \"60/70\" refer to the penetration value, which is a measure of the consistency or hardness of the bitumen. Penetration value is determined by measuring the depth in tenths of a millimeter to which a standard needle will penetrate vertically into a sample of bitumen under specific conditions of temperature and loading. In the case of bitumen 60/70, the penetration value ranges between 60 and 70 decimillimeters (0.6 to 0.7 cm). Bitumen 60/70 has various uses, including: Road Construction: It is commonly used as a binder in asphalt mixes for road construction. It provides the necessary adhesive properties to bind aggregates together and create a durable road surface. Pavement Maintenance: Bitumen 60/70 is used for maintenance and repair work on existing roads. It can be applied to fill cracks and seal the road surface, preventing further deterioration. Waterproofing: Bitumen's waterproofing properties make it suitable for various applications, such as waterproofing roofs, foundations, and basements. Roofing: In some regions, bitumen 60/70 is used as a roofing material. It is applied in layers to create a waterproof and weather-resistant roof covering. Pavement Emulsions: Bitumen emulsions, which are a mixture of bitumen and water with an emulsifying agent, are used for surface treatments and road maintenance. Bitumen 60/70 can be used to create stable emulsions for these purposes. Asphalt Production: Bitumen 60/70 is used as a binder in the production of various types of asphalt mixes, including hot mix asphalt (HMA) and warm mix asphalt (WMA). Industrial Applications: Bitumen is used in various industrial applications, such as manufacturing of roofing felt, adhesives, sealants, and corrosion protection coatings. https://lnkd.in/eiDr2MMV #bitumen_60_70 #bitumen60_70 #bitumen #road_paving #tar #asphalt #penetration_bitumen #petroleum_bitumen #bituminous #road_construction #asphalt_paving #asphalt_pavement #kuwait #uae #dubai #taiwan #china_bitumen #malaysia_bitumen #india_bitumen #korea_bitumen #europe_bitumen #asia_bitumen #vietnam_bitumen\n\n𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝘁𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆, 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗱 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆. Concrete is a locally sourced material, compared with steel which must be imported or timber which is often shipped from as far away as Eastern Europe. In addition the ingredients that go into making concrete – aggregates, cement, and water – are also sourced locally. Most ready-mixed concrete is only transported 20km to 30km from the production plant to the construction site. 𝗦𝘁𝗶𝗺𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝘆 Concrete is a local business, employing local people. There are over 4,000 people directly employed in the aggregates and concrete products industry throughout Ireland. 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗱 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗲𝗿𝘀 The local concrete business has been an integral part of the local economy for decades and in many cases, generations. Local skills and expertise, built up from years of experience, continue to be used today to manufacture high quality and innovative and exciting new products to meet the ever-changing needs of clients. 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗦𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 Responsible sourcing of construction products is an increasingly important issue for specifiers and clients. Of all construction products, concrete is best placed to deliver the highest level of responsible sourcing due to the local availability of materials and short delivery distances. Because concrete is locally sourced it means that monitoring its supply chain and ensuring its adherence to environmental, social, regulatory and legislative requirements is straightforward. #WhyConcrete #ConcreteBuilt #BuiltToLast"
