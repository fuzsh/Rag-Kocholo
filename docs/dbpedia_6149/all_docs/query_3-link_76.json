This document provides an executive summary of an environmental impact assessment and management plan for a proposed cement manufacturing plant and quarry in Namibia. It outlines that Ohorongo Mining plans to establish a quarry and cement plant with sufficient limestone reserves for over 100 years. The assessment evaluated potential environmental and socioeconomic impacts of the project. Key impacts identified include effects on vegetation, aquatic fauna, air quality, and employment opportunities. Most impacts were found to be of low or medium significance if mitigation measures are implemented. The assessment concludes the project is feasible and recommends conditions to minimize environmental effects and maximize local benefits.",
