        "text": "Economic, Policies, and Social Updates From The Villager -paper Ohangwena Aquifer To Be The North's Second Primary Water Source The government will allocate N$250 million from the N$3.3 billion (including N$1.8 billion in loans) for water infrastructure to develop the Ohangwena Aquifer. A feasibility study on Phase 1 of the Ohangwena II Wellfield Project, launched in February 2022, established that the aquifer can sustainably yield significant quantities of fresh water. This prompted the government to initiate the construction phase of various components of a bulk water supply scheme. Currently, Ohangwena is supplied with piped water from the Kunene River via the northern canal and the Oshakati purification centre. making it the second primary source of bulk water in the Central Northern Water Supply Area.\n\n#Dangote , in a significant effort to enhance intra-national trade and commerce, achieved a milestone in 2019 by completing the longest stretch of concrete road in Nigeria ‚Äì the 43-kilometre Obajana-Kabba road in Kogi state. This dual carriageway stands out for its durability and low maintenance nature, when compared to traditional asphalt roads. The economic significance of this road cannot be overstated, serving as a crucial link connecting travellers from the North to the South. Due to its strategic importance, it ranks among the busiest roads in the country. Beyond the immediate benefits to transportation, good road networks play pivotal roles in fostering economic growth. It ensures improved access to education and healthcare, creates more opportunities for tourism and recreation, and opens up different regions for investment attraction. Dangote's commitment to enhancing infrastructure extends beyond the Obajana-Kabba road in Kogi state. The construction of a 26-kilometre concrete road in Itori, Ogun state, and the concrete reconstruction of 35-kilometre Apapa-Oworonsoki-Ojota Expressway in Lagos further underscores the company's dedication to Nigeria's economic development through robust and sustainable road networks.\n\nThere‚Äôs more to real estate than just buying or renting houses. Here are some property types you can consider when making an investment in real estate üëáüèæ üè°Residential properties are the most common type of property in Nigeria and include apartments, houses, and villas. üè£ Commercial properties are designed for business use and include retail spaces, office buildings, and industrial properties. Retail spaces are typically located in high-traffic areas and are used for shops, restaurants, and other businesses that sell goods directly to consumers. üå≥ Agricultural land is land used for growing crops or raising livestock. It is a valuable asset in Nigeria, as the country has a large agricultural sector. Agricultural land can be used for a variety of purposes, including farming, ranching, and forestry. üìà Land for investment is land that is purchased with the expectation of increasing in value over time. This type of land is often located in areas with good prospects for development or in high-demand locations. üèñÔ∏è Land for special uses is land that is not suitable for general residential or commercial use, such as beachfront property, agricultural land, and land with environmental restrictions. This type of land can still be valuable, but it requires more consideration before purchase. #realestaye #realestatenigeria #realestateabuja #realestateadvisor #realestateinfluencer #realestatelagos #constructioncompany\n\nWe recently got featured on Punch Newspapers where we highlighted our goal to empower 100,000 farmers by 2025.

Despite receiving limited assistance from the Department of Works, companies have had to endure these high costs. Ramu Agri Industries currently maintain the main highways in the Ramu, Gusap and Dumpu corridor, ensuring that production can continue and vehicle maintenance costs are reduced. Industry figures have called for better infrastructure and increased police presence and community awareness for security. A 2018-2019 review found sugar, an important input in the diet of most urban and semi-urban communities, consumes a considerable portion of an average Papua New Guinean's household budget. #PNG #Leafsplash\n\n#KwameNkrumahMemorialDayTrivia. Most of us know Kwame Nkrumah spearheaded infrastructure development in Ghana but how many of the developmental projects he undertook do we actually know by name?

Tema Harbour and it‚Äôs Industrialization 3. Tema Motorway 4. Valco Aluminum Smelter 6. Akuse Irrigation Project 6. University of Ghana 7. KNUST 8. University of Capecoast 9. Korle-bu Teaching Hospital 10. Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital 11. Ridge Hospital An endeavor which left a positive and lasting impact on Ghana's development and infrastructure landscape, so much that, it‚Äôs quite hard to imagine the country without them. #KwameNkrumah #happymemorialday #legacy #development #memorialdaytrivia #Ghana #infrastructure #tbmcmann\n\nCHEVY CASTLE ACRES, CHEVRON, LEKKI* Chevy Castle Acres estate is a sophisticated blend of affordable nature for investors who sees the future far beyond.

Limestone Calcined Clay Cement (LC3) represents a revolutionary cement technology poised to address this issue. Leveraging locally sourced materials and benefiting from reduced production costs, LC3 has the potential to enhance the affordability of housing and infrastructure throughout the continent. Cement producers in Africa are increasingly adopting greener production methods to reduce CO2 emissions. These initiatives include upgrading clinker production technologies and utilizing alternative fuels. Additionally, there is a significant focus on Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs), which can substantially lessen the environmental impact of traditional cement and concrete production.
