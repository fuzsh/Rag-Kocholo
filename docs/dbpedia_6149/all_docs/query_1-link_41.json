It also marks the second time that the acquisition of Schwenk Namibia by a foreign investor has fallen through.\n\n\"Given the relationship between Whale Rock Pty Ltd and the acquiring group, the implementation of the proposed merger will increase and strengthen the dominant position of the merged undertaking,\" the commissioned continued.\n\nPublished under Cement News"
