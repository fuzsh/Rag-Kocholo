The new packaging line will increase the packaging of cement from 4400 bags/hour to 6800 bags/hour. Ohorongo Cement has also installed a two t big-bag filling station for special projects.\n\nThe NAD150 million investment was constructed using the latest technology and inaugurated by the Deputy Minister of Mines and Energy, Honorable Kornelia Shilunga, who described the investment as a testament to the importance that Ohorongo Cement attaches to the development of the country.\n\nShe further commended the company for setting the bar high for future investors in terms of execution, standard and quality for all value addition products. “This further strengthens our credibility as a nation that, in as much as we invite investors, we also expect them to produce products that are of world class and quality,” Honorable Shilunga said.\n\nThe speaker of the National Assembly Hon. Prof. Peter Katjavivi, former Mines and Energy minister Isack Katali, the Hon. Governor of the Otjozondjupa Region, Hon.
