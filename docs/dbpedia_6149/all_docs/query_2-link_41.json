        "text": "Stefanus Nashama\n\nFirst National Bank (FNB), in collaboration with the FirstRand Namibian Foundation Trust and Ohorongo Cement, has provided valuable support to over 25 youths in Opuwo, with a social investment valued at more than N$300,000.\n\nDuring the launch of a two-day training workshop over the weekend in Opuwo, Kaarina Matheus, FNB Commercial Relationship Manager, explained that this social investment is aimed at empowering the youth in Opuwo through training in brickmaking and business skills. She also highlighted that FNB, through FirstRand and Ohorongo Cement, is providing a full starter pack equipped with the necessary equipment to kick-start their businesses.\n\nThe starter pack includes items such as a wheelbarrow, safety boots, safety glasses, gloves, cement, builder’s sand, a 4 x 5-meter PVC sheet, and brushes, among others.\n\nMatheus stressed the vital role that skills development plays in Namibia’s economic growth agenda. She emphasized the need for advanced technical and vocational skills and a flexible workforce capable of adapting to rapid shifts in demand, particularly in the construction sector.\n\nInvesting in brickmaking training is seen as a platform for Opuwo’s youth to actively participate in building Namibian communities. Matheus stated, “This will empower the youth of Opuwo to play an active role in building our communities and provide much-needed direct investment in the region.”\n\nKristofina Nghishidimbwa, an Economist in the Ministry of Industrialisation, Trade, and SME Development, also spoke at the launch on behalf of Minister Lucia Iipumbu, who was unable to attend due to official commitments. Nghishidimbwa emphasized the value that this initiative adds to brick construction in Opuwo, describing it as a step towards building a more sustainable and empowered community.\n\nIn light of the challenging employment landscape, Nghishidimbwa regarded this project as a beacon of hope. She noted that the support significantly contributes to the socio-economic development of Opuwo town, which, like many other towns, grapples with high unemployment rates.\n\n“Today, however, we come together to inaugurate more than just a brick-making venture – we inaugurate a catalyst for change, a vehicle for progress, and a source of livelihood for our fellow citizens,” she stated."
