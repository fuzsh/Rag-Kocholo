        "text": "Through the Ohorongo Otavi Community Trust (OOCT), Ohorongo Cement has donated 2300 bags of cement to the Minister of Education, Arts and Culture.\n\nThe donation is valued at N$230 000 and was donated in support of the celebration of the Day of the African Child, which is celebrated annually on 16 June. This year, the theme is ‘The 2030 Agenda for sustainable development for children in Africa: Accelerating protection, empowerment and equal opportunity.’\n\n“The decision was also fuelled to benefit education, as a result of the numerous requests for cement donations, of which the majority came from schools. As a responsible corporate citizen, Ohorongo Cement, through OOCT, agreed to donate cement to the education sector through the Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture,” said Hans-Wilhelm Schütte, the Managing Director of Ohorongo Cement.\n\nOhorongo Cement will continue to support projects that add social value to Namibia.\n\nThe donation was received by Honorable Katrina Hanse-Himarwa, Minister of Education, Arts and Culture, on behalfs of the Ministry. She expressed her gratitude to Ohorongo Cement for its continued support of education.\n\n“You have played your part in ensuring that our children can have an enabling, learning and teaching environment. I am confident that this donation is not an end in itself, but a means to an end,” she said.\n\nThe cement donation will go towards the construction of extra classrooms, and ablution and cooking facilities for schools in the central northern region and eastern region of Namibia."
