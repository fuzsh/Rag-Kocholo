Ohorongo (Pty) Ltd. is one of the first of Namibia's cement manufacturers and owns one of the most modern cement plants in Africa. It was constructed over the course of two years by leading international engineering company Polysius, with local companies involved in the provision of infrastructure and the building of civil works, at a total initial investment of N$ 2.5 billion. Since then, the company invested further into a composite cement plant and a third packaging line, and a new depot in Ondangwa, bringing the total investment to date in excess of N$ 3 billion. Ohorongo commenced production in December 2010 and has a current production capacity in excess of a million tonnes of high-quality cement annually, for both local consumption and special projects. All raw materials required for the production process are sourced in Namibia and the entire value chain takes place within the country, which makes Ohorongo products a 100% proudly Namibian product. The company purchases and stores diesel on site for use in the cement manufacturing process as well as for machinery and vehicles. The Diesel is sourced from Engen Namibia (Pty) Ltd. ENGEN Namibia (Pty) Ltd is a leading marketer of liquid fuels and lubricants in the country and aims to ensure that all their clients and facilities are compliant with the relevant environmental and industry legislation. It is against this background that Engen has appointed Environam Consultants Trading (ETC) to apply for an Environmental Clearance Certificate (ECC) for this site on their behalf.
