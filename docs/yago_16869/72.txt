Roberta Taylor made her professional debut at the Citizens Theatre in 1976 and went on to perform in over 16 productions over three decades from 1976 to 1995. She returned in 2014 to play Gertrude in Dominic Hill’s production of Hamlet, with her husband Peter Guinness as Claudius.

She always had her heart set on working at the Citz.

For nearly 80 years, the Citizens Theatre has been renowned for its daring and provocative productions and Roberta Taylor was an actor who was at the heart of developing that reputation through her seminal performances in dozens of productions.

When asked in an interview in 2014 for some of her highlights, memorable performances included her debut in The Seven Deadly Sins by Bertolt Brecht “where my whole performance was in bra and knickers and a bunch of balloons” and Mikhail Lermontov’s Maskerade, wearing a necklace so large it “brought blood”.

She also fondly recalled rehearsing Private Lives in ten days – a production that audiences queued round the block to see. Michael Coveney in the Guardian also cites this production as a ‘majestic high comedy performance’ in which Roberta was outrageously funny.

She worked with Rupert Everett and Gary Oldman in Proust’s A Waste of Time and in 1990, she played in the famous revival of Brecht’s Mother Courage with Glenda Jackson.
