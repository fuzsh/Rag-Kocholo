        "text": "Polpo Productions in association with Jermyn Street Theatre presents Reunion, by John Caine, at the Jermyn Street Theatre, an Off West End venue in Piccadilly, central London from 13 Apr to 5 May 2012.\n\nStarring husband and wife Roberta Taylor & Peter Guinness.\n\nA couple face a crisis and the exploration of the moral and ethical questions that surround whether one has the right to choose the time to die.\n\nIt is directed by Anthony Biggs , designed by Nicolai Hart-Hansen, lighting by David W Kidd.\n\nDiagnosed with an incurable and relentlessly progressive degenerative disease, Raymond has decided that he wants out before the illness takes over. However if he is to end it, he needs the help of Antonia. Raymond, an atheist, has no ethical concerns about killing himself, nor does he believe that anyone else has the right to interfere in his decision but, as a lawyer, he does realise the potential legal implications for Antonia if she assists in his suicide. For Antonia, a practising Catholic, the criminal consequences that might result from helping Raymond to die are of less concern than the religious and moral issues. As the couple struggle towards a resolution of what both of them, from their different viewpoints, consider to be the crucial questions, they gradually reveal more of the thoughts and emotions that they have kept hidden, during the twenty-five years of their marriage."
