        "text": "EastEnders has shared a touching tribute to the late actress Roberta Taylor, who sadly died at age 76. On their official Instagram page, EastEnders showcased a photo from Roberta's tenure as Irene Raymond on the soap, saying: \"We're deeply saddened to hear that Roberta Taylor has passed away.\"\n\nThe show honoured her memorable portrayal of the \"formidable\" Irene Raymond, saying the late star had \"made an impact with audiences from the first moment she arrived\" in the soap's famed Albert Square. EastEnders also said that Roberta would \"always be remembered fondly by everyone that worked with her\", reports the Mirror.\n\nRoberta's death follows a battle with the emphysema. The much-loved actress died on Saturday, July 6 due to complications from a fall a few months earlier, which resulted in an infection that led to pneumonia.\n\nREAD MORE: Loughborough's Coronation Street icon turned away from set\n\nRoberta was best known for her role in EastEnders as well as for her portrayal of Inspector Gina Gold in ITV's The Bill. During her time on Albert Square which spanned 1997 to 2000, the character of Irene was involved in numerous storylines and romantic entanglements. Among these was her notable relationship with Terry Raymond, portrayed by Gavin Richards.\n\nTributes have been flooding in following news of her death. Doctor Who star Nicholas Pegg said: \"Beautiful, brilliant Roberta Taylor. Adored by millions for her roles in The Bill and EastEnders. Outstanding in Shakespeare, Inspector Morse, and all points in between. A mighty raconteur, a demon at Scrabble, and a dear friend. Thoughts are with her family and her beloved Pete.\"\n\nStuart Antony, who worked with her on The Bill, also shared his sadness. He said: \"Sad to hear lovely Roberta Taylor has passed away. She was a joy to work with and always great looks forward to our chats - RIP x\".\n\nRoberta is survived by her husband, fellow actor Peter Guinness. She also has a son Elliott, a granddaughter and two stepbrothers."
