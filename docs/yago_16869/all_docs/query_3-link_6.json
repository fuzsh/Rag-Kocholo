        "text": "Tributes paid to EastEnders star Roberta Taylor\n\nThe BBC One soap opera EastEnders has paid tribute to the actress Roberta Taylor, who has died at the age of 76.\n\nShe was best known for playing Irene Raymond in the show between 1997 and 2000, as well as for a later role as Insp Gina Gold in ITV police drama The Bill.\n\nHer agent Roxanne Vacaa said she died on 6 July.\n\nIn a statement on Instagram, EastEnders said it was \"deeply saddened\" at the news.\n\n\"Roberta made an impact with audiences from the first moment she arrived in Albert Square with her performance as the formidable Irene Raymond,\" the tribute read.\n\n\"Roberta will always be remembered fondly by everyone that worked with her and our love and thoughts go to her family and friends.\"\n\nEastEnders producer Kyri Zindilis posted a photo on X of Taylor alongside fellow stars including Barbara Windsor and Pam St Clement, which was taken during filming of an episode of the soap set in Spain.\n\n\"Devastated to hear this - I adored Irene Raymond,\" he wrote.\n\n\"We have this picture printed out and up on the wall in the Story Department, and it always makes me smile. RIP Roberta Taylor.\"\n\nTaylor's character Irene was involved in storylines including cheating on her husband Terry Raymond (Gavin Richards) and her difficulties with her children by former husband Ted Hills (Brian Croucher).\n\nFrom 2002-2008, she starred in The Bill as Insp Gina Gold, a chain-smoking whisky drinker with a sarcastic manner and a temper, who drew comparisons with her EastEnders character.\n\nTaylor, who was born in Plaistow and grew up in the Isle of Dogs, was also known for appearances in TV dramas Bleak House, Luther, Casualty and Inspector Morse, as well as the film adaptation of Roald Dahl's The Witches.\n\nAllow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

But it's also a story that says, 'If you trust too much, you're dead'.\"\n\nTaylor was married to Peter Guinness, also an actor, and had one son, Elliott, with her former husband, Victor Taylor."
