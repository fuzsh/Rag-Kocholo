        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n24 Jul 2024, 14:12\n\nCredit: Rex\n\nEastEnders and The Bill star Roberta Taylor has died at the age of 76, her agent has confirmed.\n\nThe actress, best known for her roles as Irene Raymond in the long-running London-based soap opera and Inspector Gina Gold in the ITV police drama passed away on Saturday 6th July.\n\n“Sadly I can confirm that Roberta died on July 6th. She was 76,” Taylor’s agent Roxane Vacaa said in a statement released on Wednesday (24th July).\n\n------------------------------------\n\nDON'T MISS:\n\nEmmys 2024: Baby Reindeer, The Crown and The Bear among nominees - see the full list\n\nRev Richard Coles on Strictly Come Dancing -'it's a wonderful show with a dark heart'\n\nFans delighted as This Morning reveal summer hosts covering Ben Shephard and Cat Deeley's seven week break\n\n------------------------------------\n\nTributes quickly poured in for the star, who had also starred in dramas including Luther, Casualty and Inspector Morse.\n\nThe BBC’s official EastEnders social media accounts shared a photo of Taylor as Irene along with the caption: “We’re deeply saddened to hear that Roberta Taylor has passed away.\n\n“Roberta made an impact with audiences from the first moment she arrived in Albert Square with her performance as the formidable Irene Raymond. Roberta will always be remembered fondly by everyone that worked with her and our love and thoughts go to her family and friends,” the statement finished.\n\nEastEnders producer Kyri Zindilis also shared a tribute to Taylor, saying on X (formerly Twitter): “Devastated to hear this - I adored Irene Raymond... RIP Robert Taylor.\"\n\nThe Witches star played Irene in EastEnders from just 1997 to 2000, but her storylines involving her onscreen husband Terry Raymond (Gavin Richards), former husband Ted Hills (Brian Croucher), and her character’s children meant she departed following a memorable three years on the show.\n\nTaylor starred in The Bill from 2002 to 2008, and released a personal memoir in 2005 entitled Too Many Mothers: An East End Childhood, in which she told the story of her early life and her family’s complex history.\n\nMost recently, the TV star appeared on our screens in dramas including Father Brown, The Foreigner, and Shakespeare & Hathaway: Private Investigators."
