        "text": "Her character arrived in Albert Square as Irene Hills, a divorcee reconnecting with her estranged children, Sarah and Tony. After Irene married Terry Raymond, a recovering alcoholic, they ran the grocery store First Til Last, but she could not resist the temptations of their young lodger, Troy Harvey.\n\nTerry eventually twigged and evicted him. Although he forgave Irene, life was never the same, and Terry called his wife’s bluff by offering her money to leave and travel the world. To his shock, she accepted and left. Nevertheless, two years later, he headed for Portugal after she told him on the phone that they should give their marriage another chance.\n\nSoon afterwards, Roberta Taylor was making a big impression in The Bill. Viewers knew they had a tough character in their midst who had no wish to make friends.\n\n“I’ll have your nuts in a jar!” she told one officer. Alongside this, her formidable alcohol intake led to her being caught drink-driving, though she is saved by a colleague rigging the test results. Inspector Gold also weathered accusations of bullying from a young female constable.\n\nThe actress was born Roberta Alexandra Mary Roberts on February 26, 1948 in Plaistow, east London, to Winifred Roberts, a trolley-bus conductor, and Robert Archer. Until she was five, she and her mother lived with her grandmother, grandfather, four aunts and an uncle.\n\nWhen Roberta was five, her mother married Arthur Marney and had two more children and the family lived in Millwall on the Isle of Dogs. She recalled her childhood in her unsentimental 2006 autobiography, Too Many Mothers: A Memoir of an East End Childhood.\n\nShe taught Rupert Everett how to apply make-up\n\nOn leaving school at 15 with no qualifications, she worked in secretarial jobs, then trained as a dental nurse. She also took drama classes at Toynbee Hall, Whitechapel, married Victor Taylor in 1966 and had a son, Elliott, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1976. In the same year, she joined the Citizens Theatre, Glasgow, after training at the Central School of Speech and Drama, where she taught Rupert Everett how to apply make-up and met Peter Guinness. They eventually married in 1996.\n\nGaining a grounding at the Citizens had been her ambition since seeing photos of performances there. ​\n\nOne of her first plays was The Seven Deadly Sins by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill. ​\n\nShe soon showed a talent for investing a subversive streak into serious material. The Financial Times critic praised her “chunky, impulsive, outrageously camp on occasion, statuesque, funny” Amanda in Noel Coward’s Private Lives (1984). Then she was a memorable Mrs Cheveley in Oscar Wilde’s An Ideal Husband (1986). Later in Glasgow, she played the sex worker Yvette in Brecht’s Mother Courage (1990), alongside Glenda Jackson.\n\nHer other notable stage roles included Catherine Petkoff in George Bernard Shaw’s Arms and the Man at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester (1989), and the nurse in Romeo and Juliet (Lyric, Hammersmith, 1995). In 2014, she returned to the Citizens as Gertrude in Hamlet, opposite her husband Peter Guinness playing Claudius. Guinness was also her boyfriend for a time in The Bill (2006-07).\n\nHer final stage role was on a 2018 tour of Jonathan Harvey’s jukebox musical Dusty as Dusty Springfield’s slyly subverting mother.\n\nShe is survived by Peter Guinness, along with her son from her first marriage."
