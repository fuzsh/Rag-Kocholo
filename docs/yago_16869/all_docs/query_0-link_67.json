        "text": "The actress was best known for playing Irene Raymond in the BBC soap\n\nEastEnders actress Roberta Taylor has died at the age of 76. The soap icon was most recognised for her portrayal of family head Irene Raymond on the BBC programme from 1997 to 2000. She later starred in ITV's The Bill, taking on the role of Inspector Gina Gold from 2002 until 2008. The actress, who suffered from emphysema, tragically died on July 6 following a fall two months prior.\n\nThe fall reportedly 'aggravated her underlying ill health with pneumonia', according to her obituary in The Guardian. Her final major TV series was the comedy Shakespeare and Hathaway, in which she starred alongside Jo Joyner and Mark Benton.\n\n‌\n\nREAD MORE: Family pay heartbreaking tribute after boy, 2, diesREAD MORE: Mystery surrounds boarded-up pub at the heart of Merseyside town\n\nMaking her debut in Albert Square in the 90s, Taylor's character Irene was the backbone of the Hills family. She dropped by to see her estranged children Sarah, portrayed by Daniela Denby-Ashe, and Tony, played by Mark Homer, reports Birmingham Live.\n\nOver her three years with the soap, Irene had an affair with toyboy Troy Harvey - played by Jamie Jarvis - and tried to resolve marriage issues with husband Terry Raymond, played by Gavin Richards. She previously told the Mirror: \"EastEnders has been a fantastic experience. But I'm pleased to be leaving. I was always thinking \"when can I learn my lines?\".\n\n‌\n\nLiverpool Echo Icon\n\nSign up to FREE email alerts from ECHO Daily News\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

I didn't want to do things at half-cock.\"\n\nShe added: \"I had a lot of fun playing Irene, and Gavin, who plays my screen husband Terry, and I got on brilliantly. Irene was a complicated lady.\n\n\"I never knew what was going to happen next, but that's what life is like. We worked hard at our characters. People thought we were comical but actually there was a lot of sarcasm.\"\n\n‌\n\nBorn in Plaistow, east London, Taylor left school without any qualifications and took on secretarial work. She trained as a dental nurse while taking drama classes.\n\nShe leaves behind her actor husband Peter Guinness, son Elliott, a granddaughter and two stepbrothers."
