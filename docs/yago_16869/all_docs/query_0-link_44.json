        "text": "Much-loved TV and soap star Roberta Taylor has sadly died at 76, with friends, family, and fans penning tearful tributes in memoriam.\n\nWhen a performer you’ve long admired passes, it isn’t easy to hold back the tears. But when it was somebody you watched on TV as often as weekly? The pain stings all the more. For many fans of Roberta Taylor, that was the case. The English actress was well-known for roles in numerous shows that became unmissable staples in the UK, but she also starred in movies across her impressive career too. Unfortunately, she has now passed away.\n\nTV star Roberta Taylor dies at 76, agent confirms\n\nRoberta Taylor’s agent, Roxane Vacaa, has released a statement confirming that the celebrity has, indeed, passed away, regrettably joining a host of other TV stars we’ve lost this year.\n\n“Sadly I can confirm that Roberta died on July 6th,” she revealed. “She was 76.”\n\nThe Guardian reports she had emphysema, her health taking a turn after suffering a fall two months ago that provoked her ill health with pneumonia. She is survived by her husband, Peter Guinness, her son Elliott, her granddaughter Ellis, and two stepbrothers, Brian and Lionel.\n\nEssentially UK TV royalty, Roberta starred in some of the most beloved shows on the box. Most memorably, she portrayed the no-nonsense Inspector Gina Gold in The Bill, a long-running police procedural series that ran between 1984 and 2010. She starred for six years from 2002.\n\nPrior to that, she shone playing Irene Raymond in the immensely popular soap EastEnders, playing the part between 1997 and 2000 before moving on to The Bill a couple of years later.\n\nUS audiences will also have seen her on their screens too. She played Chef Witch in the 1990 movie adaptation of the iconic Roald Dahl fantasy-horror book The Witches. More recently, she was also in the crime drama Luther (she played Celia Lavender) starring Idris Elba.\n\nHer most recent role came courtesy of the British drama Shakespeare & Hathaway: Private Investigators, as she tackled the role of Gloria Fonteyn up until 2022.\n\nTributes honor her as a ‘wonderful actress’\n\nA series of emotional and earnest tweets have sprung up in the wake of the heartbreaking news that Roberta has moved on.\n\n“Heartbroken to hear about the passing of Roberta Taylor,” an Eastenders page shared. “Loved by millions as Irene Raymond in EastEnders, Inspector Gina Gold in The Bill plus much more. Sending all our love to her family and friends at this tragic time.”\n\n“She went on to be an absolute star in The Bill,” a fan of the show tweeted. “Probably the best Inspector the show ever had.”\n\nPraising her as “brilliant” and “versatile”, the stream of appreciation is flowing online. “She was a wonderful actress,” another mourned. “She will be sorely missed. My heart goes out to her family and friends.”\n\n“So sad to read this,” yet another reacted to the distressing news. “Hugely talented lady, had a great screen presence.”\n\nAs so many have echoed, thoughts are with her loved ones during this time."
