        "text": "Roberta Taylor, celebrated for her performances in “EastEnders” and “The Bill,” has passed away.\n\nHer agent, Roxane Vacaa, confirmed the news, stating, “Sadly, I can confirm that Roberta died on 6 July. She was 76.”\n\nBorn in London, Taylor gained widespread recognition for her portrayal of Irene Raymond in “EastEnders” from 1997 to 2000. Her character, the head of the Hills family, was central to numerous engaging storylines.\n\nREAD MORE: Team GB athlete Charlotte Dujardin withdraws from Paris Olympics amid controversy for ‘whipping horse 24 times’\n\nAfter her departure from Albert Square, Taylor made a return to television in 2002, taking on the role of Inspector Gina Gold in ITV’s “The Bill,” a part she embodied for six years.\n\nBeyond these iconic roles, Taylor also made appearances in notable series such as “Luther,” “Casualty,” and “Inspector Morse.” She featured in the film adaptation of Roald Dahl’s “The Witches” as one of the sinister witches and appeared in the 2005 BBC period drama “Bleak House.”\n\nTaylor’s distinguished career extended to the theatre, including significant work with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Her final stage appearance was in the musical “Dusty” in 2018, and her last television role was Gloria Fonteyn in the comedy series “Shakespeare & Hathaway,” a role she played until 2022.\n\nIn 2005, Taylor released her memoir, “Too Many Mothers: An East End Childhood,” in which she delved into the complexities of her family’s history. She had previously shared with TV Times magazine the unusual circumstances of her upbringing, where she and her siblings were frequently cared for by her mother’s various siblings.\n\n“EastEnders” producer Kyri Zindilis paid tribute by posting a photo on social media platform X, featuring Taylor alongside Pam St Clement and Barbara Windsor during a filming session in Spain. Zindilis wrote,\n\n“Devastated to hear this – I adored Irene Raymond. We have this picture printed out and up on the wall in the Story Department, and it always makes me smile. RIP Roberta Taylor. #EastEnders.”\n\nTaylor is survived by her second husband, actor Peter Guinness, and her son Elliot from her previous marriage to Victor Taylor. According to The Guardian, she had been battling emphysema and experienced a fall two months prior, which contributed to a decline in her health and subsequent pneumonia."
