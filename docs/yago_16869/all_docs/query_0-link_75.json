        "text": "EastEnders has shared a poignant tribute to the late actress Roberta Taylor following the announcement of her death on Tuesday.\n\nThe soap's official Instagram account posted a touching image of Roberta from her days on the show, expressing their deepest sympathies to her loved ones and honouring her memorable portrayal of the \"formidable\" Irene Raymond in Albert Square. Their message read: \"We're deeply saddened to hear that Roberta Taylor has passed away.\n\n\"Roberta made an impact with audiences from the first moment she arrived in Albert Square with her performance as the formidable Irene Raymond. Roberta will always be remembered fondly by everyone that worked with her and our love and thoughts go to her family and friends.\"\n\nRoberta passed away at 76 years old after battling lung disease emphysema. She died on July 6 following complications from a fall that led to an infection several months prior.\n\nHer health deteriorated further when she developed pneumonia, reports the Mirror.\n\nBest known for her roles as Irene in EastEnders and Inspector Gina Gold in ITV's The Bill, Roberta leaves behind her husband, actor Peter Guinness, her son Elliott, a granddaughter, and two stepbrothers. Her final significant appearance on television was in the detective comedy series Shakespeare and Hathaway.\n\nRoberta, who joined the cast of EastEnders in 1997 as the headstrong matriarch of the Hills family, graced the soap until 2000, portraying the mother to Sarah (played by Daniela Denby-Ashe) and Tony (portrayed by Mark Homer).\n\nThroughout her time on the show, Roberta's character was central to numerous plots and romantic entanglements, notably with Terry Raymond, played by Gavin Richards.\n\nThe entertainment world is mourning the loss of the legendary star, with tributes flooding social media. Nicholas Pegg expressed his sorrow on Twitter: \"Beautiful, brilliant Roberta Taylor. Adored by millions for her roles in The Bill and EastEnders. Outstanding in Shakespeare, Inspector Morse, and all points in between. A mighty raconteur, a demon at Scrabble, and a dear friend. Thoughts are with her family and her beloved Pete.\"\n\nEastEnders' story producer Kyri Zindilis shared his grief online: \"Devastated to hear this I adored Irene Raymond. We have this picture printed out and up on the wall in the Story Department, and it always makes me smile. RIP Roberta Taylor.\"\n\nStuart Antony, who worked with Roberta on The Bill, also paid his respects: \"Sad to hear lovely Roberta Taylor has passed away. She was a joy to work with and always great fun when I saw her - RIP x\".\n\nReflecting on her departure from the soap in 2000 during an interview with the Mirror, Roberta discussed the demands of her role: \"I was always thinking, 'When can I learn my lines? ' I gave over much of my life to the show and if I was to carry on at such a pace I'd have to continue to put my life on hold.\n\n\"I didn't want to do things at half-cock [...] I had a lot of fun playing Irene, and Gavin, who plays my screen husband Terry, and I got on brilliantly. Irene was a complicated lady. I never knew what was going to happen next, but that's what life is like. We worked hard at our characters. People thought we were comical but actually there was a lot of sarcasm.\""
