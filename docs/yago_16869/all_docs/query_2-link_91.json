        "text": "Please go to the Management page to see the couple of clients for whom I am their Manager. This page will show you my Regular 'Other Clients' who all use me in differing ways, but ways their Agent doesn't cover. If you want to approach them about their performingwork scroll down for their Agency details.\n\n​\n\nSocial Media\n\nincreasingly, whether we like it or not, social media feeds are becoming an important and useful tool for promoting projects - and fans do want to know where they can see your work. It can also help to glean support for any charities for whom you are an advocate. But it's important to use it carefully .. my clients use me to run Official News Feeds for them, clearly presented as being that and not as a personal feed. It means their professional work, or charitable interests, can be promoted but without the client needing to do the whole 'hey, look at me' self-promotion themselves.\n\nIt's great if the client is also happy to supply the occasional message or photo but can also be effective with no obvious personal input from them!\n\n​\n\nPayment\n\n​\n\nSome of my Business Management Clients pay me a % of their earnings.\n\nFor those paying me hourly: I don't charge a retainer and they pay me only when they need me to do something for them. I have a daily rate but I charge pro-rata - often an email or a phone call is all they need, and I charge only for the time it takes to do that. It's then logged on a running timesheet. I am also happy, by arrangement, to work out of conventional office hours if you are working.\n\n​\n\nGeneral Assisting\n\nOther clients use me more as an assistant; which can mean running their social media, managing their diary and fanmail, or organising appearances. Lately it's involved helping them get digitally smart; setting up new phones and iPads, or learning how to manage their life online.\n\n​\n\nSee individual headings below for more information on those roles.\n\n​\n\nFan Mail\n\nit can be overwhelming to have fan mail dropping through the door piecemeal and then piling up for whenever it can be tackled. My clients arrange for their Agency to forward all fan mail to me > I recce it quickly and alert them to anything they need to know about immediately; otherwise I have it ready for a sit down with them whenever that good moment occurs. They also like that it gets taken it away, packaged up and posted!\n\n​\n\nSome just like a printed comp slip in, some like it to look like a more personal message back, some like to see it all, some are happy for me to just send signed ones .. you choose.\n\n​\n\nNB: Jenny Agutter fanmail: please do not send fanmail to 194 Amyand Park Rd, TW1 3HY at the moment. That address is changing following my house/office move and I will update when we know the permanent new address. If necessary email clare@clareeden.com\n\n​\n\nPaperwork Spring-Cleaning\n\n​\n\nSome manage their paperwork very well themselves most of the time and just ask for help when they are working away, or on a long contract. Or to do the occasional spring-clean of their home office and clear a backlog. Sometimes it's just useful to do a financial spring clean - a spotlight on those savings accounts that are now only gaining 0.1% interest - or why you're paying insurance on a phone you traded in three years ago... (charged hourly; and my time has always ended up being covered by something we unearthed!)\n\nAd-Hoc\n\n​\n\n* sometimes clients just need help on an emergency or one-off situation such as moving house, crashing their car, or party plans - 'sagas' being a speciality!\n\n* it may be something that benefits from my particular skill-set and experience, or something they just don't have the time or the inclination to manage themselves."
