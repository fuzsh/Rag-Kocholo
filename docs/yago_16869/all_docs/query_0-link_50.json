She was 76.\"\n\nThe London-born actress was popular with TV audiences for playing Irene Raymond in EastEnders between 1997 and 2000.\n\nHer character was the matriarch of the Hills family and came with a number of compelling storylines.\n\nAfter leaving Albert Square, Taylor returned to TV in 2002 as Inspector Gina Gold in ITV's The Bill - a role she played for six years.\n\nTaylor was also known for appearances in Luther, Casualty and Inspector Morse.\n\nShe also featured in the film adaptation of Roald Dahl's The Witches as one of the malevolent magic practitioners, and in 2005 BBC period drama Bleak House.\n\nTaylor enjoyed a distinguished theatre career, including with the Royal Shakespeare Company.\n\nHer final stage show was the musical Dusty in 2018, while she appeared in her final TV role as Gloria Fonteyn in the comedy Shakespeare & Hathaway for four years until 2022.\n\nIn 2005, the actress published her childhood memoir Too Many Mothers: An East End Childhood in which she explored her family's complex lives.\n\nRead more on Sky News:\n\nFans fume at 'disgusting prices' to see US singer\n\nBBC reveals list of highest paid stars\n\nShe previously told the TV Times magazine how she grew up in a \"peculiar family\" in which she and her siblings and cousins were \"swapped\" between her mother's brothers and sisters.\n\nEastEnders producer Kyri Zindilis posted a photo on X of Taylor with Pam St Clement and Barbara Windsor filming an episode of the soap in Spain.\n\nHe wrote: \"Devastated to hear this - I adored Irene Raymond. We have this picture printed out and up on the wall in the Story Department, and it always makes me smile. RIP Robert Taylor. #EastEnders.\"\n\nAt the time of her death, Taylor was married to her second husband Peter Guinness, also an actor. She has one son Elliot with her former spouse Victor Taylor.\n\nTaylor had suffered from emphysema and had a fall two months ago which led to worsening health and pneumonia, according to The Guardian."
