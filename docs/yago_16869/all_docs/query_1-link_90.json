        "text": "Roberta Taylor, known for her role as Gina Gold in “The Bill,” was celebrated for her acting career. Besides earning acclaim for her performances, she touched the hearts of those who knew her work and her personal life.\n\nRoberta Taylor joined EastEnders in 1997 as Irene, the mom of Sarah and Tony in Walford.\n\nDuring her three years on the show, Irene had several romantic relationships, including one with Terry Raymond and a steamy affair with her lodger, Troy Harvey.\n\nThese storylines made her character more interesting and added to the drama of EastEnders at the time.\n\nThen, she played Inspector Gina Gold on The Bill from 2002 to 2008 and made it a household name again.\n\nShe also appeared in several TV series, including Doctors, Sharman, Holby City, Silent Witness, Shakespeare and Hathaway, and Inspector Morse.\n\nFrom Theatres To the TV Industry, Roberta Taylor Made A Whopping Earnings\n\nRoberta Taylor’s career extended into theatre, notably at the Glasgow Citizens Theatre from 1980 to 1992.\n\nDuring this period, she portrayed various roles, including La Duchesse de Guermantes, in a stage adaptation of Marcel Proust’s “A la recherche du temps perdu” (Remembrance of Things Past) titled “A Waste of Time.”\n\nShe also appeared in Noël Coward’s “Design for Living,” Oscar Wilde’s “A Woman of No Importance,” and “An Ideal Husband.”\n\nIn 1992, she played Princess Kosmonopolis in “Sweet Bird of Youth,” and in 1995, she portrayed the Nurse in “Romeo and Juliet” at the Lyric Hammersmith.\n\nDuring that period, daily pay rates varied widely depending on the contract terms, ranging from as little as €50 per day to higher rates of €150 to €200 per day.\n\nFurther, the roles in popular daily soaps like EastEnders and The Bill led Roberta Taylor to earn substantial amounts ranging from €15,000 to €50,000.\n\nRoyalties Brought in Bulky Figures for Roberta Taylor\n\nThough Roberta Taylor made rare television appearances after the 90s, she still earned remuneration through residuals or royalties.\n\nThese earnings come from agreements in their contracts that entitle them to a percentage of revenue whenever the shows they’ve appeared in are aired again or distributed through other platforms.\n\nHer only recent appearance was a guest appearance on the TV series Casualty, which marked her return to television projects.\n\nMoreover, Taylor earned through her first book, Too Many Mothers, and her debut novel, The Reinvention of Ivy Brown.\n\nThese works likely contributed to her income through book sales and any related royalties or advances.\n\nRoberta Taylor’s net worth is estimated to be around €2 to €3 million ($2.1M to $3.2 M) in 2024. This includes earnings from her extensive career in television, theatre, and writing.\n\nAdditional Information"
