        "text": "British actress Roberta Taylor has died at the age of 76, her agent has confirmed.\n\nThe East London star was known for her roles as tough Inspector Gina Gold in The Bill and amorous Irene Raymond in EastEnders.\n\nShe died earlier this month.\n\nA statement from theatrical agency Roxane Vacaa said: “Sadly I can confirm that Roberta died on July 6th. She was 76.”\n\nTaylor also made appearances in Luther, Casualty, and Inspector Morse.\n\nShe was featured in the film adaptation of Roald Dahl’s The Witches as one of Grand High Witch’s followers and in the 2005 BBC period drama Bleak House.\n\nIn EastEnders from 1997, Taylor’s character was involved in storylines including cheating on her husband Terry Raymond (Gavin Richards) and her difficulties with her children by her former husband Ted Hills (Brian Croucher).\n\nShe left in 2000 when Irene appeared to head off to travel the world.\n\nTwo years later, she was cast in The Bill as the new inspector at Sun Hill police station.\n\nShe portrayed Gina Gold, a chain-smoking whisky drinker with a sarcastic manner and a filthy temper, who drew comparisons with her EastEnders character until Taylor left the soap in 2008.\n\nIn 2005, the actress published her childhood memoirs, Too Many Mothers: An East End Childhood, where she explored her family’s complex lives.\n\nShe said to TV Times magazine that she grew up in a “peculiar family” in which she and her siblings plus cousins were “swapped” between her mother’s brothers and sisters.\n\nTaylor said she had not seen her father since she was a child and did not wish to meet him.\n\nShe said: “My book is the story of the love of my mum’s life, a married man she met when she was 18, my father.\n\n“At the time it was very difficult – my birth stopped her being free for the rest of her life.\n\n“It’s a gritty story and ultimately it’s one of personal triumph. But it’s also a story that says ‘If you trust too much, you’re dead’.”\n\nEastEnders producer Kyri Zindilis posted a photo on X of Taylor with Pat Butcher (Pat St Clement) and Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) filming an episode of the soap set in Spain.\n\nHe wrote: “Devastated to hear this – I adored Irene Raymond. We have this picture printed out and up on the wall in the Story Department, and it always makes me smile. RIP Robert Taylor. #EastEnders.”\n\nTaylor leaves behind her second husband, Peter Guinness, also an actor, and one son, Elliot, who she had with her former spouse, Victor Taylor."
