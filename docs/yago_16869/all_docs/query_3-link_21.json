        "text": "ROBERTA Taylor has died at the age of 76 on July 6 2024, following a struggle with health issues for some months.\n\nAfter appearing on our screens in 1979, she went on to have a celebrated career in TV before passing away in 2024.\n\nWho was Roberta Taylor?\n\nRoberta Taylor was an icon on the small screen, appearing in some of the biggest British shows.\n\nShe was famed for playing Irene Raymond in EastEnders and bobby Gina Gold in The Bill.\n\nRoberta had a true cockney upbringing.\n\nShe was born on February 26, 1948, in Plaistow, East London, before moving to the Isle of Dogs when she was young.\n\nBoth her parents were bus conductors, but she was raised by her mother, grandmother and aunties after her dad, Robert, left home when she was young.\n\nRoberta credited her upbringing with the strong woman she grew up to be.\n\nWhat was Roberta Taylor's cause of death?\n\nRoberta died on July 6, 2024, from pneumonia, following a fall several months earlier.\n\nThe 76-year-old had also suffered with emphysema, caused by smoking for many years.\n\nShe is survived by her son, Elliot, from her first marriage to Victor Taylor, as well as her second husband, Peter Guinness, and granddaughter.\n\nBBC EastEnders paid tribute to her on Twitter, saying she \"made an impact on screen from the moment she arrived in Albert Square\".\n\nThe post added: \"Roberta will be remembered fondly by everyone that worked with her. Our love & thoughts go to her family & friends.\"\n\nWhat TV shows did Roberta Taylor star in?\n\nRoberta was known for playing tough, no-nonsense characters that audiences fell in love with.\n\nShe is known for her TV work, but did star in a number of films including The Witches in 1990 and The Turnaround in 1995.\n\nEastEnders (1997-2000)\n\nFor many, their first introduction to Roberta was when she played Irene Raymond in EastEnders.\n\nShe joined the show in 1997.\n\nIrene was a bold, matriarchal character, with a wide range of dramatic plot lines, involving new age trends and younger men.\n\nOne of her biggest and most scandalous plot lines involved an affair with Troy Harvey, who was almost half her age.\n\nThis liaison put a strain on her marriage to Terry, who eventually gave her the money and a car to leave.\n\nIrene drove off into the sun and to freedom in Alicante, Spain, leaving Roberta free to explore other characters beyond Walford Square.\n\nThe Bill (2002-2008)\n\nAfter leaving EastEnders in 2000, Roberta joined ITV’s The Bill in 2002.\n\nShe took on the role of Gina Gold, a hard-drinking, tough-talking Inspector at Sun Hill police station.\n\nHer character tackled some hard-hitting plot lines, including her own character’s arrest for drink driving and a long-time rivalry with arch-villain Irene Radford, played by the late Lynda Bellingham.\n\nAfter the kidnap of the fan-favourite character Dale Smith, known as “Smithy”, Gina finally decided to quit the force.\n\nShakespeare & Hathaway\n\nRoberta continued to act after leaving The Bill in 2008.\n\nShe starred in BBC drama Luther, wrote a novel, and appeared in several plays.\n\nIn 2018 she joined the cast of Shakespeare & Hathaway: Private Investigators as Gloria Fonteyn, a costume shop owner.\n\nGloria is pals with the investigators' sidekick Sebastian.\n\nRoberta left the show in 2022.\n\nWho was Roberta Taylor's husband Peter Guinness?\n\nRoberta married her second husband, Peter Guinness, in 1996 after many years of dating.\n\nThe couple met at the Glasgow Citizens Theatre where she worked from 1980 until 1992.\n\nLike Roberta, Peter is a star on TV and stage.\n\nHe appeared in a number of blockbusters including in Alien in 1992 and Sleepy Hollow in 1999.\n\nPeter played Ray Sykes in Coronation Street and in 2024 starred as Sir George Chapman in ITV drama Red Eye.\n\nThe couple even appeared on screen together on The Bill, with Peter playing Gina Gold's lover.\n\nThe couple did not have any children together."
