        "text": "EastEnders has paid tribute following the death of former cast member Roberta Taylor.\n\nThe Guardian first reported on Tuesday (July 23) that the actor passed away at age 76 from pneumonia following a period of ill health.\n\nIn response to the sad news, an EastEnders spokesperson commented: \"We're deeply saddened to hear that Roberta Taylor has passed away. Roberta made an impact on screen from the moment she arrived in Albert Square, as Irene Raymond. Roberta will be remembered fondly by everyone that worked with her. Our love and thoughts go to her family and friends.\"\n\nThe esteemed TV actor originally appeared in EastEnders from 1997 to 2000 as Irene Raymond, the matriarch of the Hills family.\n\nRelated: EastEnders spoilers for next week\n\nPerhaps the most iconic moment from Irene's tenure in Albert Square came during the 1999 Christmas Day episode when her husband Terry Raymond discovered her affair with a younger man.\n\nThe classic soap duo eventually got back together, but Terry could see Irene was unhappy during a couples' holiday in Spain with Frank Butcher and Peggy Mitchell as well as Roy Evans and Pat Butcher. Terry offered Irene money to start a new life away from Walford — but was stunned when she took him up on his offer as part of the character's exit.\n\nRoberta had an impressive TV career that involved a second signature role — as the hard-living Inspector Gina Gold on The Bill between 2002 and 2008.\n\nRelated: EastEnders boss teases returning characters for 40th anniversary\n\nOther memorable roles included playing one of the title characters in the classic 1990 movie The Witches opposite Anjelica Huston and Rowan Atkinson.\n\nIn more recent years, Roberta guest starred in Casualty in 2017 in addition to making a one-off appearance in Luther two years later. She also featured in Doctors and Holby City.\n\nIn a statement released to Digital Spy, Roberta's management team commented: \"Roberta was a hugely talented actress with a fierce intelligence, great humanity and unflinching integrity.\n\n\"Her subversive streak and courage brought originality to every part she played. To her many friends she was wonderful company. Fun, warm, witty, loyal and always with that razor sharp mind. She was an exceptional woman and she leaves a great void.\"\n\nEastEnders airs on Mondays - Thursdays at 7.30pm on BBC One. The show also streams on BBC iPlayer, where most episodes drop early at 6am ahead of their TV broadcast."
