        "text": "The handsome, heavy-eyed features of actor Roberta Taylor, currently to be seen twice weekly atop a police uniform in \"The Bill\", where she plays tough-talking Inspector Gina Gold, are familiar to most TV viewers.\n\nNow a new and colourful side to the actor will be revealed in her first book, Too Many Mothers: A Memoir of an East End Childhood (Atlantic, October), which proves Taylor to be a gifted writer with a startling family background.\n\nShe grew up as the illegitimate daughter of an East End bus conductor, in a family often desperate for cash, and left school at 15 with no qualifications. But Too Many Mothers is neither a nostalgia-fest nor another tale of childhood suffering--it's a clear-eyed, unsentimental and fiercely humorous account of the many unusual characters with whom Taylor grew up.\n\n\"I've been asked before to write an autobiography and I can't think of anything more boring than actors writing about their lives. I don't read books like that myself,\" she explains during a break in filming on the set of \"The Bill\". \"But Toby [Mundy, Atlantic's m.d.] twisted my arm and said I could write anything I liked. Because I'm an actor, characters are very important to me. I was going to write a novel, but then I found that I needed to get out the characters I know first.\"\n\nTaylor is well known for playing the character of Irene Raymond in \"EastEnders\", but her own family stories put the plotlines of that soap to shame. In Too Many Mothers, we hear about her scheming matriarch of a grandmother, a woman who could lie \"so comfortably\", and from whom no money or saleable goods were safe. Her misdeeds even included filching her daughter Doll's wedding collection on the eve of her marriage.\n\nThen there was shifty aunt Vi, who had frequent spells in jail, and married three Indian brothers in turn, known casually by the family as \"Raj, Taj and Bobtail\". And there was aunt Flo, prone to epilepsy and with a metal plate in her head, who \"disappeared down the Ganges\" and was never seen again.\n\nTaylor says she likes people who acknowledge \"the monster within\", and tells a funny anecdote about her nan at her grandfather's funeral, doing all the voices.\n\n\"My nan was sitting in a chair crying--it was all about the money for the funeral; he wasn't insured. My grandfather's in a box in the back room. There's a knock on the door, I go, and it's a neighbour carrying a blue Lurex suit. She goes, [perkily] 'Mary there?' Nan comes out and she goes, 'Thanks, Mavis.' She brings the suit in and we say, 'What's that?' And she says, 'Oh, it's all right, I'm going on this beano tomorrow.' And she's forgotten that she'd been sobbing her heart out 10 minutes before.\"\n\nThat was fairly typical of East End resilience, she says. \"It was a family joke for years, about how Aunt Flo disappeared down the Ganges. I find it odd that nobody seemed to shed any tears about it. You got a clump round the ear if you got sentimental, that was being self-indulgent--but you could get away with murder if you made them laugh.\"\n\nNow that she has \"leapt out of my own class by accident\", middle-class folk still misunderstand her robust cockney humour, she says.\n\n\"People think I'm a sarcastic bitch, but that's my way of talking affectionately. I try to use it as my role as Gina, it's a homage to my family really. And I tried in \"EastEnders\". Before I went into \"EastEnders\", I was thinking, 'Why are they so miserable? The East End is not miserable.' So I used to try to go in and go, 'ba-boom!' But you know there's only so much you can do with miserable writing.\""
