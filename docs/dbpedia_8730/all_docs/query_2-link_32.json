        "text": "Denmark PM Mette Frederiksen is said to have been left shocked and suffering whiplash after being struck by a man while walking in the centre of Copenhagen.\n\nThe assault took place in a square in the city's old town when a man walked up to the politician and hit her.\n\nThe attacker was swiftly arrested, but there is no word yet on a motive.\n\nEuropean Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen called it a \"despicable act, which goes against everything we believe in and fight for in Europe\".\n\nThe attack on another European leader comes less than a month after Slovak PM Robert Fico was shot several times as he greeted supporters. He survived and has since undergone surgery.\n\nTwo witnesses - Marie Adrian and Anna Ravn - described the Copenhagen assault to the local newspaper BT, saying: \"A man came by in the opposite direction and gave her a hard shove on the shoulder, causing her to fall to the side.\"\n\nThey said that while it was a \"strong push\" the prime minister did not hit the ground and that she sat down at a nearby caf√© to recover.\n\nMette Frederiksen's office said that the incident had left the politician \"shocked\" and that she was suffering \"minor whiplash\".\n\nA 39-year-old man is due to appear at a hearing at the Frederiksberg Courthouse on Saturday afternoon in connection with the incident.\n\nThe attack comes two days before Denmark votes in the EU election.\n\nMs Frederiksen, leader of Denmark's Social Democrats, had earlier taken part in a European election event with her party's lead candidate Christel Schaldemose.\n\nThe Social Democrats are the biggest party in Denmark's coalition government. They still lead the polls, but their support has fallen back considerably in recent months.\n\nDanish Environment Minister Magnus Heunicke said on X: \"Mette is naturally shocked by the attack. I must say that it shakes all of us who are close to her.\"\n\nEU chief Charles Michel said on X that he was \"outraged\".\n\n\"I strongly condemn this cowardly act of aggression,\" he said.\n\nMs Frederiksen, 46, became prime minister in 2019 after taking over as leader of the centre-left Social Democrats four years earlier. This made her the youngest prime minister in Danish history.\n\nSoon after, she became embroiled in a spat with then-President Donald Trump after she rebuffed his idea of the US buying Greenland.\n\nMr Trump called her comments \"nasty\" after she dismissed the suggestion of such a land deal as \"absurd\"."
