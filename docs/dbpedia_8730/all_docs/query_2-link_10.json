        "text": "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen canceled planned election events after being attacked in Copenhagen Friday evening, with only hours left until polls open in Denmark for the European election.\n\nThe prime minister’s office said that the attack “caused minor whiplash,” according to a statement released on Saturday and reported by local media. Overall, the Danish leader is “in good condition, but shaken by the incident,” according to the statement.\n\nHer office said Frederiksen’s planned participation in events on Saturday in Herlev, Rødovre, Roskilde, Holbæk and Slagelse has been canceled, according to the media reports.\n\nA 39-year-old man was arrested in the assault and went before a judge in a hearing Saturday in the Copenhagen City Court. The suspect was described as tall, dark-haired and wearing a T-shirt and a hoodie, according to local media reports from inside the courtroom.\n\nThe judge ruled that the name of the defendant cannot be made public to safeguard his personal security. He will be held in custody until at least June 20.\n\nThe Copenhagen police said on X that the attack did not appear to have been politically motivated.\n\nThe details of the assault Friday evening are still unclear, with eyewitnesses telling local media that the attacker gave Frederiksen a strong push.\n\nThe assault came shortly before Danes head to the polls in the European Parliament election on Sunday, at a time of heightened tensions following a spate of attacks on politicians across Europe. Frederiksen’s Social Democrats party is ahead in the latest polling ahead of Sunday’s election.\n\nEUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nThe attack prompted an outpouring of support from senior politicians across the EU.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called the assault a “despicable act” and said it “goes against everything we believe and fight for in Europe,” in a post on X.\n\n“I strongly condemn all violence against our political leaders,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on social media. “NATO allies stand together to protect our values, freedom, democracy and the rule of law.”\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron called the assault “unacceptable” in a post on X. “I strongly condemn this act and wish Mette Frederiksen a speedy recovery,” Macron said."
