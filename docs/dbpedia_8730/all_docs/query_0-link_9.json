        "text": "2024 succession in the Kingdom of Denmark\n\nMargrethe II announced her abdication (effective 14 January 2024) as Queen of Denmark during her New Year's Eve address to the nation on 31 December 2023. She was succeeded by her elder son, King Frederik X, on 14 January 2024.[1][2] Margrethe's abdication was the first voluntary abdication of a Danish monarch since that of King Eric III in 1146.[3]\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nQueen Margrethe II had previously said she would never abdicate the throne.[5] In an interview in 2012 to mark her ruby jubilee, she said: \"In my eyes, it's part of the position that you have when you inherit a monarchy: It is a task you have handed down to you, and that you keep as long as you live, the way my father did and my grandfather before him\".[6] The Queen rejected the possibility of abdication in an interview in 2016, and said: \"In this country we haven't gone in for that way of handing over. It's always been: you stay as long as you live. That's what my father did and my predecessors. And the way I see it too\".[7][8] In another interview in 2016, she said that her son will become king \"when I am no longer here\".[9]\n\nUpon the death of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom on 8 September 2022, Margrethe II became Europe's longest-reigning monarch, the world's only queen regnant, and the longest-serving incumbent female head of state.[10] In an interview earlier that year, Margrethe said that Elizabeth II had made an \"enormous impression\" on her, saying \"the fact that she was dedicating her life. I understood what that meant. This is for life. That is the whole point of my life\".[11]\n\nAnnouncement\n\n[edit]\n\nQueen Margrethe II made the surprise announcement of her abdication on live television in her New Year's Eve address on 31 December 2023. She said that time had \"taken its toll\", and her number of ailments had increased, and she cannot undertake as many duties as she managed in the past. The Queen cited her extensive back surgery in February 2023, and said that the operation made her reassess her position and consider \"whether now would be an appropriate time to pass on the responsibility to the next generation\".[12]\n\nThe Queen thanked the public for their \"overwhelming warmth and support\" over the years; the changing governments for their \"rewarding collaboration\"; and the parliament for \"always vesting their confidence in me\". She expressed her hope that the new king and queen will be met with the \"same trust and devotion which have fallen to my lot\".[12]\n\nIt is understood that, prior to the announcement, the only people aware of Margrethe's intention to abdicate were the Danish prime minister, her cousin King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, and a select few others.[13][14][15] She informed her sons of her decision only three days before the announcement.[16][17]\n\nAbdication\n\n[edit]\n\nThere is no tradition of abdication in Denmark, and Margrethe II's abdication was the first time in 878 years that a Danish monarch has voluntarily relinquished the throne; the only other to do so was King Eric III in 1146. Nevertheless, the Act of Succession envisages that an abdication can take place, as section 6 of the Act stipulates that specific provisions which are based on the monarch's death also apply when the monarch abdicates the throne.[3][18][19]\n\nCeremony at Christiansborg Palace\n\n[edit]\n\nThe abdication of Margrethe II took place at Christiansborg Palace on 14 January 2024, the 52nd anniversary of her accession to the throne.[20]\n\nAt 13:35 CET, Crown Prince Frederik, Crown Princess Mary and their children left Frederik VIII's Palace for Christiansborg Palace. Two minutes later, the Queen made the journey from her residence in Christian IX's Palace to Christiansborg Palace in the Golden Wedding Anniversary Coach.[21][22][23]\n\nAt 14:00, the Queen, Crown Prince Frederik and Prince Christian participated in a meeting of the Council of State, with the cabinet ministers and the council of state secretary in attendance.[21] The moment the Queen signed the declaration of her abdication, Crown Prince Frederik acceded to the Danish throne as King Frederik X.[24][25] Queen Margrethe then gave up her seat and offered it to the new King. At the same time, the new heir-apparent to the throne, Crown Prince Christian, took the seat to the right of the King. After this, a visibly moved Queen Margrethe said \"Gud bevare kongen\" (God save the king) and left the Council Chamber.[26][27] After the meeting, the former monarch returned to Christian IX's Palace in a motor car. At 14:30, the new King and Queen hosted a reception for specially invited people.[21][28]\n\nAt 15:00, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen proclaimed the new king from the balcony of Christiansborg Palace.[29][30] According to Danish state custom, the Prime Minister proclaimed three times: \"Her Majesty Queen Margrethe II has abdicated. Long live His Majesty King Frederik X!\" This was followed by the traditional ninefold cheer from the crowd of tens of thousands who turned out to witness the proclamation.[31][32] The King then made a speech and presented his royal motto: \"Forbundne, forpligtet, for Kongeriget Danmark\" (United, committed, for the Kingdom of Denmark).[21][33] After his speech, the King was joined on the balcony by his family, including the new Queen Mary and Crown Prince Christian.[34]\n\nAfter the proclamation, gun salutes were fired from the Sixtus Battery on Holmen, Copenhagen. At Amalienborg, the royal standard was lowered at Christian IX's Palace and raised at Frederik VIII's Palace to mark the King's accession. The King and Queen then returned from Christiansborg Palace to their residence in Amalienborg in the Golden Wedding Anniversary Coach, escorted by the Guard Hussar Regiment's mounted squadron.[21][22][35] After arriving at Amalienborg, the royal family appeared on the balcony of Frederik VIII's Palace.[36]\n\nAt 17:00, royal colours were transferred from Christian IX's Palace to Frederik VIII's Palace to mark the change of monarch.[30][37][38] At the Yellow Palace, a book of congratulations was set up from 15:00 to 19:00, to allow the public to send greetings to the King. A congratulation list was also opened on the website of the Danish royal house.[39]\n\nTo mark the change of monarch, flags were flown from all state buildings and state ships throughout the Danish Realm on 14 January 2024.[40]\n\nChanges in royal titles\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing his accession, Crown Prince Frederik has been styled as \"HM The King\", and Crown Princess Mary became \"HM The Queen\". The royal couple are henceforth known as the King and Queen of Denmark.[41] Prince Christian, who became the heir apparent, is referred to as \"HRH Crown Prince Christian\".[41]\n\nQueen Margrethe II retained the style \"Her Majesty\" and is known as \"HM Queen Margrethe\".[29][41] She also became eligible to be installed as regent in the event of the incapacity of the King and Crown Prince Christian. As regent, Margrethe can perform the duties of the head of state on certain occasions, for example during Frederik and Christian's stays abroad.[42]\n\nCommemorative events\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 15 January 2024, the King and Queen, and members of the royal family, attended the Danish Parliament's celebration of the King's accession. During a meeting in the Chamber, the Speaker and the Prime Minister delivered speeches, and later, the Prime Minister conveyed the message from the King to parliament. Afterwards, a reception was held in the former Landstinget Chamber.[43][44]\n\nOn 21 January 2024, the royal family participated in a celebratory church service at Aarhus Cathedral with representatives of Denmark and the City of Aarhus in attendance. The service was led by Royal Chaplain-in-Ordinary and Bishop of the Diocese of Aarhus Henrik Wigh-Poulsen.[21]\n\nTo mark the abdication, Frederiksborg Castle hosted an exhibition of Queen Margrethe II's portraits, including the famous silkscreen portrait by Andy Warhol as part of his Reigning Queens series.[45] The Danish Broadcasting Corporation and TV 2 teamed up to organise a tribute show for Queen Margrethe titled \"Danmarks dronning – den største tak\" (Denmark's Queen – the greatest thanks), which was broadcast live from Kongens Nytorv on 12 January 2024.[46][47] The Danish Broadcasting Corporation also produced the documentary \"Dronningen og statsministrene – i al fortrolighed\" (The Queen and the Prime Ministers – in complete confidence), which features interviews and archive material about the Queen's relationship with her nine Danish prime ministers.[48][49]\n\nCelebrations in Australia\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Australia, public buildings across Tasmania including the Tasman Bridge, the Launceston Town Hall, and Devonport's paranaple convention centre were illuminated in the colours of the Danish flag on 14 January 2024. The Tasmanian Government donated A$10,000 to the Alannah and Madeline Foundation in honour of Queen Mary's international patronage.[51] To mark Mary's elevation to Queen, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the federal government's donation of A$10,000 to Wildcare Tasmania to support the conservation of the Tasmanian devil.[52]\n\nA hand-made Huon Pine occasional table will also be gifted by the Tasmanian Government to the King and Queen. Hobart Lord Mayor Anna Reynolds marked the occasion by planting a blue gum tree; with the Lord Mayor of Copenhagen planting a reciprocal tree in the Danish capital to honour \"the enduring bond between the two cities\".[53] The Premier of Tasmania, Jeremy Rockliff, said there was \"always an open invitation\" for Mary and Frederik to visit Tasmania.[54] Books of congratulations were set up at Government House in Hobart from 15 to 19 January, to allow Tasmanians to congratulate the royal couple.[55]\n\nIn Tasmania, celebrations were held at Taroona Beach, while a high tea took place at the Shot Tower in Taroona. Parliament House in Hobart flew the Danish flag on 14 January.[56] In Wollongong, south of Sydney, the Danish Club of Australia hosted Danish expats and their families for a picnic to mark the royal transition. In Melbourne, people gathered at the Danish Club at Denmark House to celebrate.[54]\n\nChanges in the Royal House\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing the change of monarch, several adjustments were made in the management of the Royal House.[57]\n\nChristian Schønau, chief of the court of Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary, succeeded Kim Kristensen as Court Marshal of the Royal House of Denmark on 14 January 2024. On the same day, Private secretary Henning Fode resigned after 16 years in office. A new private secretary was not appointed as the required duties are to be carried out by the Court Marshal in the new reign.[57]\n\nIn the newly established \"Court of Her Majesty Queen Margrethe\", Kim Kristensen took office as chief of court. Lasse Harkjær, the Master of Ceremonies resigned on 1 March 2024 to take up the position of Chief of Staff in Queen Margrethe's Court. Harkjær was succeeded as the Master of Ceremonies by Anders Friis on 1 March 2024.[57]\n\nOther changes\n\n[edit]\n\nAll royal patronages and honorary positions held by Queen Margrethe II, Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary ended upon the change of monarch on 14 January 2024. They will later be reviewed and decisions will be made regarding which patronages are to be continued or redistributed.[58]\n\nAll royal warrants ended upon the abdication, as they are given by the reigning monarch. Current holders of royal warrants will be able to continue to use the title \"Purveyor to the Royal House of Denmark\" until the warrant ends or one year after the abdication (14 January 2025). A decision will be made later on the future arrangement regarding royal warrants.[58][59]\n\nHonorary titles, such as lady-in-waiting, chamberlain and master huntsman, were not affected by the change of monarch, and the same applied to already awarded orders and medals.[58]\n\nReactions\n\n[edit]\n\nDanish Realm\n\n[edit]\n\nThe news of Queen Margrethe's abdication was described as a \"surprise\" and a \"shock\", as many people had expected her to remain on the throne until her death.[60][61][10] Danish newspapers hailed the Queen for her 52 years of service, with the broadsheet Weekendavisen describing her speech as \"personal and perfectly balanced\" with \"no drama, no unnecessary pathos ... an abdication that can only take place in Denmark.\"[13]\n\nIn a statement, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen thanked the Queen for \"her lifelong dedication and tireless efforts for the Kingdom\" and described her as the \"epitome of Denmark\".[61][62] In her New Year's address on 1 January 2024, Frederiksen spoke of the shock and disbelief felt by Danes the moment the Queen announced her abdication and said it was \"as if the time came to a standstill.\" She thanked the Queen for her years of service and said:[63]\n\nFor generations, the Queen has been our rallying mark. A holding point when everything else was in motion. Part of what we come from. And who we are. The Queen has managed to speak to us as a people. Both for new and old Danes. Both for young and old people. And to the whole kingdom – Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Through great changes, the Queen has held on to the art, the culture, the virtues, and the ancient wisdom. And an international outlook. To preserve the tradition. Our traditions. And at the same time being a modern head of state for a modern country – it is an art of balance that commands both devotion and respect. It is exactly that renewal that the Queen is continuing with the decision to step down and let a new generation make room. Now we are embarking on a new chapter for Denmark. We will miss Queen Margrethe, whom we love so much. But the fact that the Royal House lives on as an institution is largely the merit of Margrethe the person.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Troels Lund Poulsen noted that the Queen's decision to abdicate shows both her \"wisdom\" and the monarchy's \"strength and durability for Denmark\", and said that the new King \"will be able to lead the Danish monarchy safely into a new era, where tradition and renewal will be able to follow each other.\"[64][65]\n\nSpeaker of the Folketing Søren Gade thanked the Queen for \"being a thoughtful and unifying person for the entire Danish kingdom\", and said that \"by adapting the royal house step by step\", Margrethe \"managed to renew the royal house as an institution.\"[66]\n\nOther Danish politicians also paid tribute to the Queen, including Minister of Foreign Affairs and former Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Leader of Liberal Alliance Alex Vanopslagh, Leader of the Social Liberal Party Martin Lidegaard, Leader of the Danish People's Party Morten Messerschmidt, Leader of the Conservative People's Party Søren Pape Poulsen, Leader of the Green Left Pia Olsen Dyhr, Leader of New Right Pernille Vermund, Political spokesperson of the Red–Green Alliance Pelle Dragsted, Lord Mayor of Copenhagen Sophie Hæstorp Andersen, and Mayor of Aarhus Municipality Jacob Bundsgaard.[64][67]\n\nAksel V. Johannesen, prime minister of the Faroe Islands, hailed Margrethe as the \"epitome of stability and majesty\", and thanked the Queen for her \"great work and faithfulness.\"[68]\n\nMúte Bourup Egede, prime minister of Greenland, said that the Queen has been \"liked and respected by many Greenlanders\", and he thanked Margrethe \"for her 52-year reign, dedication and commitment to Greenland\".[69]\n\nForeign\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing the change of monarch on 14 January 2024, several foreign leaders congratulated the new King and Queen.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
