        "text": "Queen Margrethe II of Denmark is to abdicate and bring to an end the longest reign of any current Monarch in Europe.\n\nThe Danish queen will give up her throne on January 14th 2024, the 52nd anniversary of her accession. She will be succeeded by her elder son who will become Frederik X.\n\nThe Danish Royal Household has announced that further details about the abdication will be made shortly – it takes place in exactly two weeks time.\n\nHer decision to step aside is unprecedented in recent Danish history.\n\nNow, the Danish government has confirmed Margrethe will continue to be ‘Her Majesty’ following the abdication.\n\nOther abdications in the past decade across Europe have led to a variety of titles for the monarchs who have given up their thrones.\n\nIn Belgium, Albert II retained the title of king after he stepped aside in July 2013. Juan Carlos I of Spain also kept the title of king following his abdication in June 2014.\n\nHowever, in the Netherlands, the retiring monarch chose a different style. Following her decision to step aside, in April 2013, the former Queen Beatrix became known as Princess Beatrix.\n\nAt the end of 2022, Queen Margrethe decided to change the titles of four of her grandchildren. The sons and daughter of her younger son, Prince Joachim, lost their HRH and prince or princess style and are now known as either Count or Countess of Monpezat."
