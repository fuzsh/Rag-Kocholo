        "text": "Four days after being assaulted in a busy Copenhagen square, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen of Denmark said she was carrying out her duties as leader but still recovering, in her first interview since the assault.\n\n“I am not quite myself yet,” said Ms. Frederiksen in an interview on Tuesday with DR, Denmark’s public broadcaster, adding that she had stepped back from some activities against the backdrop of elections for the European Parliament on Sunday.\n\nMs. Frederiksen said that she had needed time with family after the assault, which left her shaken and concerned about the tenor of political debate. “It is very intimidating that there is someone who crosses the last physical limit that you have,” she said.\n\nMs. Frederiksen, the leader of the center-left Social Democrats, was in Kultorvet, a busy square in Copenhagen’s Old Town, when she was assaulted on Friday. The police said that a man hit the prime minister with a clenched fist on her right upper arm, according to DR, and her office said that she had sustained minor whiplash.\n\nThe police in Copenhagen arrested a 39-year-old man in relation to the assault, and have said that they do not believe it was politically motivated. The man pleaded not guilty to preliminary charges of violence against a public servant in court on Saturday, according to DR.\n\nThe man said he did not disagree with Ms. Frederiksen’s political positions and called her a “really good prime minister,” DR reported. A prosecutor in court said it was probable that the man had been under the influence of alcohol and drugs, according to the Copenhagen police.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
