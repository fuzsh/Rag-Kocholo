        "text": "Anwar Hussein/WireImage\n\nDuring her own Golden Jubilee celebration, Queen Margrethe of Denmark took time to acknowledge the death of Queen Elizabeth.\n\nOn Saturday, Queen Margrethe, 82, hosted a gala to celebrate her 50-year reign at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen. Before the event's festivities began, Queen Margrethe called for a minute of silence to honor Queen Elizabeth.\n\nThe minute of silence was not the only way Queen Margrethe recognized the loss of Queen Elizabeth. She also cut back on a majority of events that were scheduled for the weekend, leaving the gala as the sole celebration for Saturday.\n\nRELATED: Queen Elizabeth's Coffin Seen for First Time as It Travels from Balmoral Castle to Edinburgh\n\nIDA MARIE ODGAARD/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty\n\nQueen Margrethe also called for the cancelation of the Horse Squadron of the Guard Hussar Regiment, the carriage drives that were scheduled to circle the Royal Stables, the parade of the guards at Amalienborg, and a concert at Kong's Nytorv. A Copenhagen City Hall visit was also postponed, with a new date to be scheduled at a later time.\n\nFor more on Queen Elizabeth, listen below to our daily podcast PEOPLE Every Day.\n\nSunday's events — church at Our Lady Church, a dinner on the Dannebrog for Nordic rulers and a Christianborg dinner — will continue as planned.\n\nIn honor of Queen Elizabeth and the British royal family, Denmark's Queen also sent a special letter to King Charles that read, \"Your mother was very important to me and my family. She was a towering figure among the European monarchs and a great inspiration to us all. We shall miss her terribly,\" per Reuters.\n\nRELATED: Kate Middleton Shares Prince Louis' Heartbreaking Words: 'Grannie Is with Great-Grandpa Now'\n\nThe two monarchs were more than just fellow queens: They were said to be close friends — and even distant cousins.\n\nSERGEI GAPON/Anadolu Agency via Getty\n\nThey are related to Denmark's King Christian IX, whose daughter was Elizabeth's great-grandmother, Queen Alexandra. On Queen Margrethe's mother's side, the two are related through Queen Victoria via her granddaughter Princess Margaret of Connaught.\n\nIn a previous interview with ITV, Queen Margrethe opened up about her friendship with Queen Elizabeth and their nicknames, with Margrethe's being Daisy and Elizabeth's being Lilibet.\n\n\"That's the way we have known each other always,\" Queen Margrethe said, according to Newsweek, adding, \"That is what we call each other when we see and speak to one another. We are definitely affectionate, but I don't want to splash it all over the place!\"\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up to date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nDennis Oulds/Central Press/Getty\n\nBuckingham Palace announced Queen Elizabeth's death on Thursday.
