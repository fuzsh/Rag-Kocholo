This unprecedented decision, the first by a Danish monarch in nearly 900 years, was announced on New Year's Eve and was attributed to the queen's health issues. The abdication ceremony occurred on the balcony of Christiansborg Palace in the Danish capital. King Frederik X automatically assumed the throne, leading to Denmark having two queens—Queen Margrethe retaining her title, and Frederik's wife becoming Queen Mary. The eldest son, Prince Christian, is now the crown prince. Unlike the UK, Denmark does not have a coronation ceremony; instead, the prime minister formally proclaims the new king from Christiansborg Palace.",
