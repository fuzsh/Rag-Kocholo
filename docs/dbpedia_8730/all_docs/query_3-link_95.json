        "text": "COPENHAGEN: Denmark’s prime minister proclaimed Frederik X as king on Sunday after his mother Queen Margrethe II formally signed her abdication, with massive crowds turning out to rejoice in the throne passing from a beloved monarch to her popular son.\n\nMargrethe, 83, is the first Danish monarch to voluntarily relinquish the throne in nearly 900 years. Many thousands of people gathered outside the palace where the royal succession took place, the mood jubilant as the Nordic nation experienced its first royal succession in more than a half-century, and one not caused by the death of a monarch.\n\nDenmark’s monarchy traces its origins to 10th-century Viking king Gorm the Old, making it the oldest in Europe and one of the oldest in the world. Today the royal family’s duties are largely ceremonial.\n\nMargrethe signed her abdication during a meeting with the government at the Christiansborg Palace, a vast complex in Copenhagen that has been the seat of Danish power for centuries. It now houses the Royal Reception Rooms and Royal Stables as well as the Danish Parliament, the prime minister’s office and the Supreme Court.\n\nPrime Minister Mette Frederiksen next proclaimed Frederik king from the balcony of the palace before the cheering crowd.\n\nFrederiksen read the proclamation three times, which is the tradition, as Frederik stood beside her wearing a ceremonial military uniform adorned with medals. He was then joined on the balcony by the new, Australian-born Queen Mary and the couple’s four children, and the crowd spontaneously sang the national anthem.\n\n“My hope is to become a unifying king of tomorrow,” Frederik said. “It is a task I have approached all my life.”\n\nIt is the custom for each new sovereign to adopt a royal motto as a guiding principle for their reign, and Frederik’s is: “United, committed, for the kingdom of Denmark.”\n\n“I want to return the trust I meet,” the new king said. “I need trust from my beloved wife, you and that which is greater than us.”\n\nFrederik kissed Mary, the queen, who wore a white dress with a sash over one shoulder, and another great cheer rose from the crowd.\n\nThey then left Christianborg Palace in a horse-drawn coach as church bells rang out, and headed to their Amalienborg residence, where they once again appeared before people cheering and waving the nation’s flag of a white cross on a red background.\n\nFrederik, who was visibly moved, placed both hands on his heart in a gesture of thanks.\n\nThe abdication document was earlier presented to Margrethe as she sat at a massive table covered in red cloth around which royals and members of the Danish government were seated. Frederik sat beside her.\n\nAfter signing it, Margrethe, dressed in a magenta skirt suit, rose and gestured to Frederik to take her place. “God save the king,” she said as she left the room using a cane for support.\n\nThe abdication leaves Denmark with two queens: Margrethe keeps her title, while Frederik’s wife becomes Queen Mary. Frederik and Mary’s eldest son Christian, 18, has become crown prince and heir to the throne.\n\nCiting health issues, Margrethe announced on New Year’s Eve that she would step down, stunning a nation that had expected her to live out her days on the throne, as is the tradition in the Danish monarchy. Margrethe underwent major back surgery last February and didn’t return to work until April.\n\nEven the prime minister was unaware of the queen’s intentions until right before the announcement. Margrethe had informed Frederik and his younger brother Joachim just three days earlier, the Berlingske newspaper wrote, citing the royal palace.\n\nPeople from across Denmark gathered outside parliament, with many swarming streets decorated with red-and-white Danish flags. Several shops hung photos of Margrethe and Frederik, while city buses were adorned with small Danish flags as is customary during royal events. Many others across the kingdom of nearly 6 million people followed a live television broadcast of the historic event.\n\n“It was worth the four hours wait,” said Anders Pejtersen, 25. He made the trip from Aalborg, in northern Denmark, to witness Frederik’s proclamation. His mother, Helle Pejtersen, said “it was intense.”\n\nMarina Gregovic, 32, a Copenhagen resident, said she believed Frederik “will be fantastic. And we loved his speech.”\n\nRoyals across Europe sent their congratulations including UK King Charles III, whose late mother Queen Elizabeth II and Margrethe were third cousins.\n\nCharles said he was committed to working with them “on ensuring that the enduring bond between our countries, and our families, remains strong.”\n\nEarlier in the day, the royal guards’ music band made their daily parade through downtown Copenhagen, but wore the red jackets used to mark major events, instead of their usual black.\n\nThe last time a Danish monarch voluntarily resigned was in 1146, when King Erik III Lam stepped down to enter a monastery. Margrethe abdicated on the same day of January that she ascended the throne following the death of her father, King Frederik IX, on Jan. 14, 1972.\n\nAustralians also turned out on the streets of Copenhagen to celebrate one of their own becoming queen.\n\n“I think it’s good that she’s not from royalty and has a normal Australian background. We can relate more to that, because she’s from a middle-class background, and we are too,” said Judy Langtree, who made the long journey from Brisbane with her daughter to witness the royal event.\n\nA survey — commissioned by Denmark’s public broadcaster DR — published Friday showed that 79 percent of the 1,037 people polled by the Epinion polling institute said that they believed Frederik was prepared to take the reigns and 83 percent said they thought his wife Mary was ready to become queen. The survey margin of error was 3 percentage points, DR said.\n\nThough a hereditary monarchy might seem contradictory to the egalitarian principles of modern-day Denmark, the royal family remains highly popular and the anti-monarchist movement is small.\n\n“The republicans in Denmark have no future,” former parliamentary Speaker Pia Kjærsgaard said on public television.\n\nLOS ANGELES: A woman allegedly known as the “Ketamine Queen,” who prosecutors say sold “Friends” actor Matthew Perry the drugs that would kill him, didn’t look very regal when she appeared in a Los Angeles court this week.\n\nIf they can prove their case against Jasveen Sangha — that she made thousands of dollars from the troubled celebrity, selling him ketamine from her North Hollywood drug emporium — she might never see the outside of prison again.\n\nIn the meantime, her court appearance in a green Nirvana sweatshirt and baggy sweatpants was a far cry from the party-filled jet set lifestyle that investigators say she normally leads.\n\nThe dual British-American national was one of five people charged in connection with the October 2023 death of the much-loved Perry, who was found unresponsive in the pool of his swanky Los Angeles home.\n\nOthers included Perry’s live-in personal assistant, a go-between and two medical doctors who are alleged to have sold $12 vials to the celebrity for as much as $2,000 each, as they exchanged texts wondering “how much this moron will pay.”\n\nBut it was the arrest and charging of Sangha that has particularly shone a light on the seedy side of Hollywood glamor.\n\nCourt documents allege Sangha, 41, ran a huge drug operation out of her comfortable apartment — dubbed the “Sangha Stash House” — where investigators discovered ketamine, methamphetamine, cocaine and prescription medication like Xanax.\n\nHer source for the ketamine, she told broker Erik Fleming — who is also charged in connection with Perry’s death — was a “master chef” and a “scientist” through whom she boasted she could “fill any order.”\n\n“She only deal[s] with high end and celebs,” Fleming is said to have written to Perry’s personal assistant. “If it were not great stuff she’d lose her business.”\n\nPhotos posted on the Internet show Sangha partying with actor Charlie Sheen, a man with well-documented addiction problems.\n\nHer own Instagram account is packed with proof of a glitzy lifestyle that appears to include trips on private jets and plates of caviar in an airport lounge.\n\nOther photos show her sporting a range of designer wear, including jewelry from Van Cleef & Arpels, shoes by Louis Vuitton and clothes from Chanel.\n\nBut the high-roller lifestyle was apparently funded through a trade in misery, exploiting the desperation of addicts like Perry.\n\nThe dozens of doses of ketamine she allegedly sold him came in unmarked glass vials with a cheap blue plastic cap.\n\nProsecutors say Sangha was a consummate saleswoman, offering a sample for Perry to try before he committed serious money.\n\n“It’s unmarked but it’s amazing,” she allegedly texted the middleman. “He [can] take one and try it and I have more if he likes.”\n\nAnd the final batch Sangha is alleged to have supplied — the one that resulted in Perry’s death at just 54 — came with a sweetener: ketamine lollipops, prosecutors say.\n\nHours after news of the actor’s death emerged, Sangha set out to cover her tracks, investigators say, ordering middleman Fleming to “delete all our messages.”\n\nTwo weeks later, she jetted off to Tokyo, posting smiling pictures of her posing in a kimono.\n\nThe trip was one of around a dozen foreign jaunts she has taken since Perry died, a Los Angeles judge heard on Wednesday, which have also included Antigua and Mexico.\n\nThat judge remanded Sangha in custody on Wednesday and ordered her to stand trial in October, after hearing her deny all charges.\n\nIf convicted of conspiracy to distribute ketamine and the other charges she faces, Sangha could be jailed for the rest of her life.\n\nSalvador Plasencia, one of the doctors also charged with supplying Perry, also denied the charges he faces.\n\nThe other defendants have either pleaded guilty or agreed to do so in relation to their charges. They face between 10 and 25 years in prison.\n\nDENVER: A man who was convicted of pointing a gun at Burger King drive-thru worker who wouldn’t accept drugs for payment and later shooting at other people elsewhere the same night has been sentenced to 143 years in prison.\n\nProsecutors who announced the sentence Thursday said the drive-thru incident was the beginning of a series of crimes Eugene Robertson carried out in the Denver suburb of Aurora on Oct. 17, 2022. No one was wounded.\n\nIn April, a jury found Robertson guilty of 17 crimes, including eight counts of attempted murder. The sentences for many of the crimes were stacked on top of each other, leading to a long sentence. Robertson had faced a maximum sentence of more than 400 years when he was sentenced Aug. 9.\n\n“I hope this century-long prison sentence serves as a warning that my prosecutors and I will not tolerate violent crime in our community,” 18th Judicial District Attorney John Kellner said in a statement.\n\nAfter Robertson pointed the gun at the drive-thru worker, prosecutors said he walked into a convenience store across the street and pointed a gun at the head of a clerk. When Robertson saw there was a surveillance video camera system there, he shot at the screen and left, then shot toward two people outside in the parking lot, Kellner’s office said.\n\nThe Sentinel Colorado in Aurora previously reported that a witness at the convenience store store told police there seemed to be “something off” about Robertson and that he was “talking about God” and carrying a Bible with a purple cover.\n\nLater that night, a woman who was friends with Robertson called 911 to report that he had fired shots after she refused to open the door of her apartment, where she was with several people, prosecutors said.\n\nPolice spotted Robertson at the woman’s apartment complex. He hid behind some bushes before being arrested, prosecutors said.\n\nWUHAN, China: Turning heads as they cruise past office buildings and malls, driverless taxis are slowly spreading through Chinese cities, prompting both wariness and wonder.\n\nChina’s tech companies and automakers have poured billions of dollars into self-driving technology in recent years in an effort to catch industry leaders in the United States.\n\nNow the central city of Wuhan boasts one of the world’s largest networks of self-driving cars, home to a fleet of over 500 taxis that can be hailed on an app just like regular rides.\n\nAt one intersection in an industrial area of Wuhan, AFP reporters saw at least five robotaxis passing each other as they navigated regular traffic.\n\n“It looks kind of magical, like a sci-fi movie,” a local surnamed Yang said.\n\nBut not everyone shares Yang’s awe.\n\nDebate around safety was sparked in April when a Huawei-backed Aito car was involved in a fatal accident, with the company saying its automatic braking system failed.\n\nA minor collision between a jaywalker and a Wuhan robotaxi last month re-ignited concerns.\n\nTaxi drivers and workers in traditional ride-hailing companies have also raised fears of being replaced by artificial intelligence — although the technology is far from fully developed.\n\nWuhan’s driverless cabs are part of tech giant Baidu’s Apollo Go project, which first received licenses to operate in the city in 2022.\n\nInitially only five robocars ferried passengers around 13 square kilometers (five square miles) of the city of around 14 million.\n\nBaidu says the taxis now operate in a 3,000-square-kilometer patch — more than a third of the total land area of Wuhan, including a small part of the city center.\n\nIn comparison, US leader Waymo says the largest area it covers is 816 square kilometers, in Arizona.\n\nWhen a car reaches its pickup point, riders scan a QR code with their phones to unlock the vehicle — with the front seats blocked off over safety concerns.\n\nThe fares are currently heavily discounted, with a thirty-minute ride taken by AFP costing just 39 yuan ($5.43) compared with 64 yuan in a normal taxi.\n\n“They are stealing our rice bowls, so of course we don’t like them,” Wuhan taxi driver Deng Haibing said, using a popular Chinese term for livelihoods.\n\nDeng said he fears robotaxi companies will push traditional drivers out of business with subsidized fares, before raising prices once they achieve domination — similar to the strategy employed by ride-hailing apps in the 2010s.\n\n“Currently the impact isn’t too big because robotaxis aren’t fully popularized and can’t drive everywhere yet,” Deng said.\n\nThe robotaxi fleet is a tiny fraction of the tens of thousands of taxis and ride-hailing cars in Wuhan.\n\nMore and more Chinese cities are rolling out policies to promote self-driving services though, part of a national push for tech supremacy.\n\nBaidu and domestic rival Pony.ai have for years tested models of varying autonomy levels in industrial parks around the country.\n\nShanghai issued its first batch of provisional permits for fully driverless cars last month, and the capital Beijing has approved fully autonomous robotaxis in suburban areas.\n\nThe southwest city of Chongqing and southern tech hub of Shenzhen also have pilot projects underway.\n\nTechnology wise, there’s still a long way to go before self-driving taxis become ubiquitous though, according to Tom Nunlist, tech policy analyst at Trivium China.\n\n“Everybody seems to think autonomous driving is inevitable at this point, and frankly, I don’t know that it is,” he said.\n\n“Presently fully autonomous driving tech is simply not ready for large-scale deployment,” he said.\n\nEven in Wuhan’s Apollo Go taxis — which can spot obstacles and wait scrupulously at intersections — ultimate responsibility for safety still lies with human officers monitoring rides remotely.\n\nDuring one ride in an Apollo Go car, one manipulated the car’s built-in touchscreen to remind AFP reporters to put on their seatbelts.\n\n“Safety personnel provide strong assurances for your ride via remote 5G assistance technology,” the Apollo Go app tells users.\n\nRobotaxis are also far from able to replicate the human touch.\n\n“Some customers have disabilities and (driverless cars) definitely wouldn’t be able to help them, and some passengers are carrying large items,” ride-hailing driver Zhao said.\n\n“Only a human can help.”\n\nPREVALLE, Kosovo: As firefighters in southern Kosovo prayed for rain in their battle against wildfires in the Sharr Mountains National Park, a young man on a motor-bike approached them and said: “I am here to help.”\n\nAllmedin Smaili, 26, a dentist from the nearby town of Prizren, has been helping firefighters for seven days to stop a fire in the park where he and his friends usually go with their motorbikes to enjoy the thrill of riding over the harsh terrain.\n\nTwo men at the fire department base fill backpack waterbags of 25 liters each and Smaili transports them to other firefighters to use to douse the flames as huge areas of pine trees burn.\n\nMost of the time he carries two backpacks with water totalling 50 liters, food and bottles of drinking water.\n\n“When I saw what firefighters are going through and how committed they are I told myself I have to do something,” Samili said as he prepared to transport more water.\n\nOn Wednesday, Smaili called three other friends to transport more water as breeze stopped the flames and a US helicopter from the NATO peacekeeping mission in Kosovo started to drop water. The challenge is to stop slow burning trees which can ignite again with a more destructive fire.\n\n“To reach the highest point with water on our back we need three hours and the boy (Smaili) was doing it in less than ten minutes,” said Flamur Hoti, the firefighters’ commander.\n\n“We never imagined he could be so helpful.”\n\nVideo from his GoPro camera shows Smaili handing water to his new colleagues as his motorbike sped along trails made by brown bears and wild goats.\n\nSteep slopes can be seen from his left and right side through traces of old burned areas which are still visible.\n\nFire trucks can not reach the terrain some 1,900 meters above the sea level.\n\n“Cross motor-bike is a hobby for me but this week in turned into a real job,” he said, smiling. “When I see the impact, it gives me pleasure and I never got tired during these days.”\n\nA US judge on Wednesday said he was planning to issue an order forcing Alphabet’s Google to give Android users more ways to download apps, but would not micromanage the tech giant’s business, following a jury verdict last year for “Fortnite” maker Epic Games.\n\nUS District Judge James Donato in San Francisco heard from technology experts and lawyers for Epic and Google about proposed reforms in the blockbuster antitrust case.\n\nDonato showed impatience for Google’s protests about the costs and difficulty of implementing many of Epic’s proposals, and signaled he would issue a ruling that would maximize users’ and developers’ flexibility to download and distribute apps outside the Play store.\n\n“You’re going to end up paying something to make the world right after having been found to be a monopolist,” Donato said.\n\nHe said his injunction will be about three pages long and will ensure Google knows what the “rules of the road are.”\n\nDonato said he will rule in the coming weeks and set up a three-person compliance and technical committee to implement and monitor the injunction.\n\n“Google foreclosed competition for years and years and years. We’re opening the gate now and letting competitors come in,” Donato said.\n\nGoogle declined to comment, and Epic did not immediately respond to a request for one.\n\nEpic’s lawsuit accused Google of monopolizing how consumers access apps on Android devices and how they pay for in-app transactions.\n\nThe Cary, North Carolina-based company persuaded a jury in December 2023 that Google unlawfully stifled competition through its controls over app distribution and payments.\n\nEpic has asked Donato to require Google to make it easier for Android users to download apps from third-party app stores, such as Epic’s, and from other Internet sources. It also wants the court to forbid Google from automatically installing its Play store on Android devices.\n\nGoogle has denied harming competition, and it told Donato that Epic’s proposals “would make it nearly impossible” for the Alphabet unit to compete and harm consumer privacy and security.\n\nGoogle lawyer Glenn Pomerantz told Donato on Wednesday that Google should not be forced to distribute its rivals’ app stores. “Competition will be worse if you impose a duty that you have to deal with your competitor,” Pomerantz said.\n\nEpic’s lawyer Gary Bornstein urged the court to direct Google to act quickly to implement his injunction.\n\nGoogle faces another threat to its business practices in a separate government lawsuit in Washington, D.C. challenging the company’s dominant search engine.\n\nLast week, US District Judge Amit Mehta ruled for the US Justice Department and said Google had illegally monopolized web search, spending billions to become the Internet’s default search engine. Google has denied the claims.\n\nMehta has set a Sept. 6 hearing to discuss a timeline for the court to impose remedies on Google in that case."
