        "text": "Today, Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary\n\nofficially become King and Queen of Denmark.\n\nTheir accession comes two weeks\n\nafter Queen Margrethe II announced her abdication\n\nin a shock turn during her annual New Year's Eve speech.\n\nIn keeping with Danish tradition\n\nsince the introduction of the Constitution in 1849,\n\nthe Prime Minister will appear\n\non the balcony of Christiansborg Palace,\n\nofficially announce the abdication of the Queen,\n\nand declare, Long lived the new King.\n\nAnd with that, Denmark enters the era of Frederik the 10th.\n\nIt couldn't have come at a better time.\n\nFrederik and Mary's approval ratings are currently\n\nat 84 and 85% respectively.\n\nThey have increased their number\n\nof official engagements in recent years,\n\nand the sense among Danes is that they are ready.\n\nFrederik met his now wife,\n\nthe Scottish Australian Mary Donaldson,\n\nat the Slip Inn in Sydney during the 2000 Olympics,\n\nand after an initially secret romance,\n\nthey married four years later at the Copenhagen Cathedral.\n\nThey have four children, the eldest, Prince Christian,\n\ncelebrated his 18th birthday this year at the palace.\n\nMary's such a hit,\n\nthe Australian and British newspapers\n\nwere at war over her nationality.\n\nHer parents are from East Lothian,\n\nbut moved to Tasmania before she was born.\n\nEven so, the official coat of arms created for her\n\nreferences Scotland and the MacDonald clan\n\nfrom which she hails.\n\nMary has put a tremendous amount of work\n\ninto becoming Danish.\n\nShe's traveled widely, learned the language to a high level,\n\nand become the glamorous, most prominent face\n\nof the royal family.\n\nThe result, she is the nation's highest polling royal,\n\neven above Margrethe.\n\nNo wonder she's said to have inspired the Princess of Wales.\n\nTogether, the new king and queen\n\nhave also weathered scandal.\n\nAn affair allegation sprung up late last year\n\nafter Frederik was spotted on a night out\n\nwith the Mexican socialite, Genoveva Casanova.\n\nBut the story never took off in Denmark\n\nlike it has in the global press.\n\nCasanova has separately denied the rumors,\n\nbranding them malicious.\n\nInsiders say Frederik and Mary have a winning formula.\n\nMary naturally excels when handed responsibility.\n\nFrederik has a relaxed, charismatic style\n\nthat looks set for success.\n\nPeter Thygesen, the Senior Editor\n\nat Denmark's leading broadsheet, Politiken,\n\nsays they have big shoes to fill.\n\nMargrethe II is already a legacy with immense respect,\n\nand they will only earn and retain the same by hard work."
