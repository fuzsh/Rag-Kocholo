        "text": "For the past five decades, Queen Margrethe of Denmark has delivered a message on New Year's Eve to wish her subjects well for the coming year.\n\nBut on the last night of 2023, she surprised everyone when she announced this speech was her last.\n\n\"I have decided that now is the right time. On 14th January, 2024 — 52 years after I succeeded my beloved father — I will step down as queen of Denmark,\" Margrethe said on live television.\n\n\"Thank you to the many, many people who on special occasions and in everyday life have embraced me and my family with kind words and thoughts, turning the years into a string of pearls.\"\n\nIn two weeks, Margrethe will abdicate in favour of her son Crown Prince Frederik and his Australian-born wife Princess Mary.\n\nAfter experiencing some health issues in recent months, Margrethe said she had decided the time was right for her to step down.\n\nThe 83-year-old became the longest-serving living monarch in Europe in 2022 upon the death of her third cousin, Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nMargrethe has long enjoyed the adoration of her subjects, with 72 per cent of Danes approving of the monarchy.\n\nBut her decision to abdicate comes during a tumultuous period for the House of Glücksburg.\n\nFrom a feud with her youngest son over his children's titles, to a Spanish tabloid's claims of infidelity, the last few years have been dramatic for the Danish monarchy.\n\nNow it will be up to Margrethe's heir to steady the ship.\n\nThe girl who was never meant to rule and her 'alpha male' husband\n\nPrincess Margrethe entered the world in April 1940, just a week after Germany invaded Denmark.\n\nHer father took the throne two years after his nation was liberated from Nazi occupation.\n\nGrowing up in the royal residence of Copenhagen, Margrethe was the first of three daughters born to the crown prince and princess.\n\nBut she would not become an official heir until her father changed the laws of succession shortly before her 13th birthday.\n\nA studious and well-travelled young royal, Margrethe graduated from Denmark's most prestigious institutions and continued her studies abroad in Paris, London and at Cambridge University.\n\nWhile juggling her public and social engagements, Margrethe studied philosophy, prehistoric archaeology, political science, and became fluent in five languages — Danish, French, Swedish, English and German.\n\nIt was during her time at London's School of Economics that she first met French diplomat Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, a \"flamboyant alpha male\" who would become her husband of almost 50 years.\n\nThey married in 1967 and welcomed two sons in quick succession: Prince Frederik, the future king, was born in 1968, and his younger brother Joachim a year later.\n\nIn 1972, Margrethe's father King Frederik delivered his traditional New Year's address to the nation, wishing for a prosperous year ahead. But within hours he had fallen ill, and two weeks later, the king died.\n\nHis daughter became the second female monarch in Denmark's history.\n\nWhile Queen Margrethe balanced her royal duties with raising her two sons and pursuing her artistic passions in illustration, set design and costuming, her husband agitated for more official recognition.\n\n\"It is no secret that [Henrik] for many years has been unhappy with his role and the title he has been awarded in the Danish monarchy,\" the Royal Danish House's director of communications told a newspaper in 2017.\n\nThe prince consort had publicly refused to be buried next to the plot reserved for his queen unless she saw fit to bestow him with the title of king consort.\n\nUltimately, she did not. Upon his death in 2018, Henrik was cremated, with his ashes scattered across the seas and placed in the garden at Fredensborg Palace.\n\nQueen Margrethe last year surpassed Christian IV as Denmark's longest-reigning monarch.\n\nBut her 51st year on the throne would prove to be one of the most tumultuous yet.\n\nA controversial decision enrages the queen's son\n\nMany of the Scandinavian royal families have undergone dramatic changes in recent decades to modernise and keep their cost to the taxpayer relatively low.\n\nThe Danish government used to pay an annual subsidy of $AU22 million to support Margrethe, her two sons and their families.\n\nBut in 2016, Queen Margrethe agreed to a change in funding that means only the heir to the throne — in this case, Frederik and Mary's first-born son Christian — will receive a state-funded salary.\n\nPrince Christian's siblings and cousins will be expected to get jobs and support themselves when they're old enough.\n\nThe family said it accepted the decision, and always planned for the monarch's grandchildren to support themselves.\n\nBut six years later, further efforts to streamline the House of Glücksburg caused a schism between the queen and her youngest son.\n\nIn 2022, she announced that Prince Joachim's four children would surrender their titles of prince and princess and henceforth be styled as count and countess of Monpezat.\n\n​\"​Prince Joachim's descendants will thus have to be addressed as excellencies in the future,\" her office said in a statement.\n\n\"The queen's decision is in line with similar adjustments that other royal houses have made in various ways in recent years.\"\n\nBut Prince Joachim immediately went public, claiming that his mother had blindsided him with her decision and deeply hurt the feelings of her grandchildren.\n\n\"We are all very sad,\" Prince Joachim told Danish outlet Ekstra Bladet.\n\nAn angry Joachim disputed his mother's claim that he was given four months' notice of the decision, insisting he was told just days before she made the announcement.\n\nThe usually drama-free Danish royals began to fight with each other through public statements.\n\n\"We understand that there are currently many emotions in the game, but we hope that the wishes of the royal family to make the royal house future-proof will be respected,\" Queen Margrethe said through her office.\n\nDespite the scandal, Margrethe refused to back down, insisting she was acting in the long-term interests of House of Glücksburg.\n\nShe did, however, issue a very public apology to her son and his children.\n\n\"I have made my decision as queen, mother, and grandmother,\" she said.\n\n\"But, as a mother and grandmother, I have underestimated the extent to which much my younger son and his family feel affected. That makes a big impression, and for that I am sorry.\"\n\nA Spanish tabloid makes sensational cheating claims\n\nIn late 2023, rumours began circulating that the future King of Denmark had cheated on his wife, Crown Princess Mary.\n\nPrince Frederik was photographed on an outing with Mexican socialite Genoveva Casanova in Madrid, in late October.\n\nWhile the photos, first published by Spanish magazine Lecturas, appeared to show nothing more than the pair strolling through a park and entering an apartment building, they were enough to whip the tabloid press into a frenzy.\n\nLecturas published an exclusive issue splashing the paparazzi shots, alongside a salacious account of Frederik and Casanova's \"date\" — which it claimed included a trip to the museum before dinner and a flamenco show.\n\nMs Casanova has denied any romantic relationship with Prince Frederik and posted a legal letter to her Instagram, threatening action against the magazine and demanding a retraction.\n\nShe has remained otherwise silent about the outing with Prince Frederik since November.\n\nAnother Spanish outlet, ¡Hola!, printed Ms Casanova's statement and explained that a mutual friend had been unable to attend the exhibition in Madrid and asked Ms Casanova to accompany the prince instead.\n\nThe Danish royal family has refused to engage on the subject, with a spokesperson telling Danish publication B.T they \"do not comment on rumours or insinuations\".\n\nJust days after the story first came to light, Prince Frederik and Princess Mary stepped out together in Copenhagen alongside Queen Margrethe as part of official engagements with visiting royals from Spain.\n\nIn two weeks, they will accede to the throne.\n\nPrincess Mary will become Australia's first ever monarch as she takes on the position of queen consort alongside her husband.\n\n'Many of us have never known another monarch'\n\nWhen Queen Margrethe became monarch in 1972, only 42 per cent of Danes were in favour of keeping the monarchy.\n\nDuring her five decades wearing the crown, she has steadily won back the faith of her subjects to become one of the most popular monarchs in Europe.\n\nBut despite recent scandals in an otherwise blemish-free reign, Margrethe said she feels confident in her decision to step down.\n\nShe underwent extensive back surgery last year and she said her convalescence gave her time to think.\n\n\"The surgery naturally gave rise to thinking about the future – whether the time had come to leave the responsibility to the next generation,\" she said.\n\nDenmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen will soon become the country's first female leader to proclaim a new monarch.\n\nShe paid tribute to the outgoing queen, and heralded the arrival of a new era in Danish history.\n\n\"Although the duty and role of the sovereign have been inherited for over 1,000 years, it is still difficult to comprehend that the time has come for a change of throne,\" she said."
