        "text": "Written by Darcy Gresham\n\nAt 6.00pm on New Year’s Eve, Queen Margrethe of Denmark addressed the nation. This particular year, however, her speech shocked Danes everywhere — the beloved monarch announced her abdication would follow just two weeks later. It was declared that, on 14 January 2024, Crown Prince Frederik would become Frederik X, succeeding his mother after her fifty-two years on the throne. This news sent ripples throughout the country and brought into question both the place of abdication in monarchic succession and Margrethe’s achievements as a twenty-first century Queen.\n\nThe Danish monarchy stretches over one thousand two hundred years, making it one of the oldest in the world. It has seen rulers such as Harald Bluetooth, and Alexandra (daughter of Christian IX) who became Queen of the United Kingdom upon marrying Edward VII. Queen Margrethe, who officially abdicated on 14 January, is only the second female monarch in the history of Denmark. Her official title is Margrethe II, but as the previous Margrethe I reigned between 1376—1412 there is little confusion created by the omittance of her regnal number. While many rely upon the Horrible Histories song as a useful tool to remember the British line of succession, since 1513 practically all Danish monarchs (bar Margrethe) have been named Frederik or Christian, it is not as useful in this context. The current generation is no exception with Frederik X’s son and heir apparent named Christian.\n\nQueen Margrethe has been, and is still, adored by millions across Denmark, Greenland, and the rest of the world. Affectionately known by her nickname ‘Daisy’, her steadfast rule and much-loved manner made her exceedingly popular. As many a Danish tour guide will proudly tell you, she was formerly a chain smoker only quitting in the past year due to health concerns. These tour guides tend to elaborate this story with claims that she specially imported cigarettes from Greece – such cigarettes have since been banned in Denmark due to their health risk, but her status permitted certain concessions. The ‘Ashtray Queen’ did cease smoking in public in 2006, but it is no secret that she continued this habit in private. It was preferred that she no longer glamorise the habit as photographs of Margrethe, cigarette in hand, appeared in many publications, including Vogue. Furthermore, a keen Tolkien fan may note her illustrations in the Danish edition of Lord of the Rings and the British editions published by the Folio Society. One would have to be exceptionally keen though, as she used her pseudonym ‘Ingahild Grathmer’ an anagram of her first and middle names when drawing.\n\nBeyond her charming personality and intriguing hobbies, she is seen as a modernising monarch; able to retain traditional elements whilst simultaneously bringing the institution firmly into the twenty-first century to ensure popularity ratings that many other royal families would undoubtedly be envious of. On assuming the throne in 1972, polls showed only 45 per cent of Danes favoured a monarchy. However, through decades of work Margrethe has raised this to a staggering 82 per cent. Part of her modernisation strategy included allowing both her sons to marry ‘commoners’ – famously the new Queen Mary is the daughter of Tasmanian academics, meeting the then-Crown-Prince at a bar in Sydney during the Olympics.\n\nAnother method of modernisation saw the slimming down of the monarchy. Margrethe stripped four of her grandchildren of their royal titles in 2022 sparking a quarrel with their father—her son Prince Joachim—over the issue. Citing the extended freedoms of lives outside formal affiliations with the Royal House of Denmark, the decision by the Queen was seen to allow the children a larger role in shaping their own lives as well as streamlining the core of the royal family. The children of Prince Joachim are now known as the Counts and Countess of Monpezat, but there was public outrage voiced by Prince Joachim and his wife Princess Marie. The princess claimed her daughter—aged 10 at the time—had been bullied at school over the loss of her title. There is debate in Britain over similar issues, with streamlined monarchies proving not only more popular but crucially decreasing the cost of the institution to the taxpayer — it seems the Danish model is one to look to as an example.\n\nThe modest nature of the monarchy was visibly illustrated by the recent coronation of Frederik X that was rather understated, particularly in comparison to that of King Charles. It comprised of a procession and proclamation in parliament by the Prime Minister followed by a balcony appearance. There was distinct sentiment in the capital of Copenhagen that, whilst nothing especially grand or commemorative was taking place, there would still be many following events closely. Crowds came out in their hundreds to catch a glimpse of the new King, but the whole event saw little of the exuberant splendour that other coronations command. This new era of Danish rule has only just begun, and it is yet to be seen how Frederik fares, but one thing is more than clear – Margrethe has concretely paved the way for the future.\n\nThe Danes’ darling Daisy is still beloved across the Kingdom, and memory of her reign will likely only solidify her popular place in history. In recent days news of a television show, likely inspired by the success of the Crown, is set to air in the near future under the Danish title ‘Af Guds nåde’— ‘by the Grace of God’—referencing the immense sense of God-given duty the Queen felt. Denmark has calmed down again since the coronation excitement at the start of the year and life is much the same — you are not greeted with an explosion of monarchism in Copenhagen, but if you ask any passing Dane, they will recall Margrethe’s reign with affection and admiration.\n\nBibliography\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/01/all-of-denmark-is-crying-danes-react-to-margrethe-iis-abdication\n\nhttps://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/queen-of-hearts-arts-how-denmarks-queen-margrethe-ii-dragged-royalty-to-modernity-in-her-52-yr-reign/articleshow/106436741.cms?from=mdr\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/19/life-and-abdication-of-danish-queen-margrethe-ii-to-be-dramatised-for-tv\n\nhttps://denmark.dk/people-and-culture/monarchy"
