        "text": "On January 14, 1972, Denmark welcomed in a new monarch as Queen Margrethe II ascended the throne.\n\nThe moment, nearly 52 years ago, was celebrated across the Scandinavian country last year and today – January 1, 2024 – saw the royal announce she was finally stepping down from the throne.\n\nMargrethe, who is Europe's longest-reigning living monarch, announced during her New Year's Speech that she would abdicate on January 14, 2024 – the 53rd anniversary of her own accession.\n\nThe shock move means Australia will have its first ever queen, as Crown Princess Mary elevates to the position alongside her husband Prince Frederik.\n\nREAD MORE: Denmark's Queen Margrethe II to step down from throne\n\nMargrethe's announcement follows months of speculation after the Danish royal battled a bout of ill health.\n\nIn April last year, Queen Margrethe made her official return to public duties after taking leave following a major operation on her back.\n\nThe monarch had \"extensive\" surgery following years of mobility issues.\n\nQueen Margrethe of Denmark's most eye-catching royal jewels\n\nThe operation was a success and was followed by a lengthy period of rehabilitation and rest, with the palace saying \"there will still be a number of major tasks that the Queen cannot complete as planned in the coming months\".\n\nMargrethe II is now Europe's longest-serving monarch and, after the death of her cousin Queen Elizabeth II of Britain in September 2022, is the world's only reigning Queen.\n\nBut she is far from your average Queen and has become known for her quirky sense of style, her love of the arts, sense of humour and most importantly, her fierce love of her country and monarchy – a dynasty that has been in power for more than 1000 years.\n\nWho is Queen Margrethe II?\n\nAt head of the House of Glücksborg, the family that has occupied the Danish throne for nearly 160 years, is Queen Margrethe.\n\nMargrethe II was born on April 16, 1940 at Amalienborg Palace, in Copenhagen, the daughter of King Frederik IX and Queen Ingrid, born Princess of Sweden.\n\nShe has two sisters, Princess Benedikte (born in 1944) and Queen Anne-Marie of Greece (born in 1946).\n\nIn 1953, when Margrethe was 13 years old, the Act of Succession gave women the right to succeed the throne but only if there was no male heir. Prior to that, her uncle was next-in-line.\n\n\"That was what made the biggest impression on me back then with the amendments to the throne law in 1953, when I was 13 years old, that now my future was a hundred percent in Denmark,\" Queen Margrethe told Danish magazine SUNDAY, ahead of her Golden Jubilee.\n\n\"And I was very happy about that. I can clearly remember that. It's actually a great thing to get to know the main frame of one's life so early,\" adding that not many people have that privilege.\n\nWhen her father died on January 14, 1972, Margrethe became the first Danish Sovereign under the new Act of Succession.\n\nREAD MORE: A look inside one of Europe's oldest monarchies, Denmark's royal family\n\nThe Act of Succession was changed again in 2009, three years after the birth of Margrethe's grandchild Prince Christian, which gave the regent's eldest child the right to inherit the throne regardless of gender.\n\nShe is a great-great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria and is a third cousin of Queen Elizabeth II. The Danish royal family has blood ties to many of Europe's royal houses including those in Britain, Norway, Greece, Russia and Sweden.\n\nA royal love story\n\nShe was married to Prince Henrik for 51 years before he died in February 2018.\n\nThey wed on June 10, 1967, when Margrethe was heir apparent. French-born diplomat Henri Marie Jean André became Prince Henrik of Denmark upon the wedding, which took place at the Church of Holmen in Copenhagen, followed by a reception at Fredensborg Palace.\n\nHenrik presented Margrethe with one of the most impressive, and unusual, rings upon their engagement. Made by French jewellery house Van Cleef & Arpels, the ring features two large cushion-cut diamonds, set diagonally on a yellow gold band. The style is known as a 'toi et moi' ring, meaning 'you and me' in French.\n\nQueen Margrethe continues to wear her engagement ring, even after his death.\n\nThe monarch and Prince Henrik have two sons, Crown Prince Frederik and Prince Joachim.\n\nTheir eldest son Prince Christian is second-in-line to the throne.\n\nPrince Joachim is married to Princess Marie and they have two children, Count Henrik and Countess Athena. Prince Joachim was previously married to Princess Alexandra and they have two sons, Count Nikolai and Count Felix.\n\nIn September 2022, Queen Margrethe shocked Denmark, and much of the world, by announcing all of Prince Joachim's children would lose their prince and princess titles in 2023.\n\nThe move, she said, was done to enable the children to craft their own futures without the burden and responsibility of being a royal.\n\nBut it was met with anger and hurt by Prince Joachim and his wife Princess Marie, and his ex-wife.\n\nCount Nikolai also spoke out about his grandmother's decision, expressing his dismay.\n\nREAD MORE: A closer look at Prince Joachim, Princess Mary's brother-in-law\n\nThe children lost the right to use their His/Her Royal Highness titles from January 1 this year.\n\nThey now go by the titles of Count/Countess and are referred to as Their Excellencies.\n\nThe accession but no coronation\n\nThe Danish monarchy can be traced back to Viking ruler Gorm the Old, nearly 1000 years ago.\n\nWhen absolutism was introduced in 1600s, the elective monarchy was replaced by inherited monarchy. But in 1849, the monarchy's status was overhauled from absolute to constitutional.\n\nThat meant when Margrethe became Queen, she didn't have a coronation as such, but her reign was proclaimed to the people of Denmark.\n\nInstead of a celebration, the monarch is essentially in mourning during the proclamation, as the crown is passed from the old to the new.\n\nOn January 15, 1972, Margrethe travelled from Amalienborg in an open-top carriage to the nearby Christiansborg Palace, where she presided over her first State Council meeting as Head of State. She had previously been given a seat on the council in 1958 in the King's absence.\n\nREAD MORE: Why there'll be no coronation for Princess Mary, Prince Frederik\n\nDressed head to toe in black, complete with a veil, she stood on the balcony for her proclamation as Queen. Prime Minister Jens Otto Krag declared: \"King Frederik IX is dead. Long live Her Majesty Queen Margrethe II.\"\n\nAt 31, she was officially Denmark's new monarch and Queen of the Faroe Islands and Greenland.\n\nThe crowd gave a salute before Queen Margrethe II gave a speech asking for God's help in her new role.\n\nShe and her husband Prince Henrik were joined by their sons, Prince Frederik, who was three, and Prince Joachim, who was two.\n\nThe Queen's main roles are to represent Denmark abroad and to be a figurehead at home. Under the constitutional monarchy, she cannot independently perform political acts but signs all Acts of Parliament which only come into force when they have been countersigned by a Cabinet Minister.\n\nThe Queen's motto is \"God's help, the love of The People, Denmark's strength\".\n\nSpeaking about her role as Queen to The Telegraph UK in 2016 Margrethe said: \"Little girls seem more inclined to dream of being princesses nowadays than they ever were before, at least as far as I can see.\n\n\"It's not for me to say whether royalty still has an aura – I look at it in a fairly matter-of-fact way. When I was a child I didn't enjoy princesses in fairy tales in the least because I wasn't that way. I wasn't pink and tinsely at all.\"\n\nWhen the time comes for Crown Prince Frederik to take the throne, with his wife Crown Princess Mary, neither will have a coronation.\n\nA highly educated Queen\n\nMargrethe went to school at Zahles Skole, in Denmark, and the University of Copenhagen, with a stint at a boarding school in England.\n\nShe later moved to England to attend the University of Cambridge, to study prehistoric archaeology, then back to Denmark to study political science at Aarhus University. Margrethe also attended the Sorbonne in Paris and the London School of Economics.\n\nAlong with Danish, she speaks French, Swedish, English and German.\n\nREAD MORE: Princess Mary's photographer on why the royal has 'melted the hearts of the Danes'\n\nMuch like the late Queen Elizabeth II of Britain, Margrethe was active in wartime. She performed voluntary service with Women's Flying Corps from 1958 to 1970 and received comprehensive training in the Women's Air Force.\n\nShe retains military connections with the UK, beginning with her appointment in 1972 as Colonel-in-Chief of The Queen's Regiment, and in 1992, as Colonel-in-Chief of The Princess of Wales' Royal Regiment.\n\nMargrethe the artist and designer\n\nSince childhood, art has played a major role in Margrethe's life. She is a celebrated artist in Denmark and across Europe and her work has featured on stage and screen.\n\nIn early 2021, Netflix hired Margrethe as a set designer for fantasy film Ehrengard, due for release in 2023. She will oversee the scenography and costumes for the movie, which is based on a 1962 novella by Danish author Karen Blixen.\n\nOver the years the monarch has expressed her talents in painting, church textiles, watercolours, prints, book illustrations, découpage works, scenography and embroidery.\n\nShe's exhibited her work in various galleries, and even drew the illustrations for Danish editions of Lord of the Rings.\n\nAt Christmas, she was applauded on stage at the premiere of The Snow Queen at the Tivoli Concert Hall for her work on the production's costumes. In 2019, Margrethe worked on the Christmas ballet The Nutcracker.\n\nThe monarch has worked on more than 10 professional productions, and her costume designs have featured in two films, The Snow Queen and The Wild Swans — both adaptations of Hans Christian Andersen stories.\n\nIn 2019, Princess Mary carried a beaded clutch bag featuring a large 'M' to an art exhibition in the queen's honour, that was handmade by Margrethe, one of many embroidered items that are now on display in a museum.\n\nWhen asked about how she finds time to juggle her royal duties and her passion for the arts, Queen Margrethe said it was all about balance.\n\n\"I've lived with this duality for many years now and I feel that the duty that I have gives an edge to the fact that I like expressing myself in art, but the duty part of my life is nourished by the fact that I'm able to work in my art, able to produce something myself,\" Queen Margrethe told The Telegraph UK.\n\n\"I don't think I can really separate the two influences — the two go more or less hand-in-hand.\"\n\nHer nickname is 'Daisy'\n\nAt the funeral of her cousin the Duke of Edinburgh in April in 2021, a floral wreath was sent to St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle and signed \"Daisy\".\n\nQueen Margrethe got the nickname after her grandmother, Crown Princess Margareta of Sweden, and is affectionately called \"Aunty Daisy\" by some of the other European royals, including those in Sweden and Norway.\n\nIn Sweden and Denmark, the name \"Margareta\" sounds similar to a common Nordic flower, which is in English is known as a Leucanthemum. But as that name is hard to pronounce, and the flower looks like a daisy, many call it as such, and when the Swedes found this out they began calling the royal 'Daisy'.\n\nMargrethe's grandmother died before she was born, but when the new princess came into the world she quickly inherited the nickname.\n\nQueen Margrethe often signs letters and documents as Daisy and regularly wears a large diamond brooch in the form of a daisy that once belonged to her mother and grandmother.\n\nAlso, the national flower of Denmark is the daisy and when Queen Ingrid gave birth to Margrethe, royal jeweller Georg Jensen presented her with a special version of its now-iconic daisy jewels.\n\nQueen Margrethe regularly wears the Georg Jensen daisy jewels and has others in the floral motif.\n\nQueen Margrethe is a smoker\n\nThe Queen has smoked cigarettes for much of her adult life.\n\nThe Telegraph described her laugh as \"a cigarette laugh\", with Margrethe previously saying, \"I smoke wherever there's an ashtray\".\n\nHer love of jewels and flamboyant clothing\n\nQueen Margrethe's jewellery collection is one of the grandest and most eclectic among Europe's royal houses.\n\nWhile her personal pieces are numerous, the most important of her jewels are The Crown Jewels, of which there are four sets (known as a parure).\n\nThey include the brilliant-cut diamond set, an emerald set, a pearl-ruby set and a rose-cut diamond set which all consist of necklaces, earrings and brooches, and one of them includes a diadem. The sets can be divided up so that individual pieces can be combined in different ways.\n\nFor one of her first official portraits in the years after her coronation, Queen Margrethe wore the Emerald set.\n\nAll of the Crown Jewels originally belonged to Queen Sophie Magdalene, who was married to Christian VI. In 1746, she specified in her will that her jewels should be at the disposal of the sitting queen, arguing \"In this Royal House, there are so few jewels and not any crown jewels at all\".\n\nOver time, Sophie's pieces have been altered by succeeding queens as jewellery styles have evolved over time.\n\nMargrethe is also instantly recognisable for her love of bright clothing, often in bold prints, many of which she has made or designed. One of these is her so-called \"happy\" raincoat, made from a very colourful floral print with matching yellow rainhat.\n\nQueen Margrethe's legacy\n\nIn an interview for her Golden Jubilee, the monarch was asked about what she wanted her reign to be remembered for.\n\n\"There is at least one thing, and I have said this before: you want to be remembered for making an effort. I think that is very important.\n\n\"To make an effort is to use what one has in oneself. It is different what we each have. But it means that you concentrate on what you have to do, and that you come up with what you hope you have in you in the individual situations.\n\n\"And it does not have to be in big and landmark moments. This also applies to quite everyday things. If you make an effort, it helps a lot.\"\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here"
