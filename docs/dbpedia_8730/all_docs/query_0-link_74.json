        "text": "Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has proclaimed Frederik X the new King of Denmark on the balcony of Christiansborg Palace on Sunday, after Queen Margrethe II gave up the throne.\n\nMore than 100,000 people turned out for the unprecedented event in the Danish capital Copenhagen.\n\nThe Queen finalized and signed her abdication, which was first announced in her New Year's Eve address, at a meeting with the Danish Cabinet.\n\nAfter signing it, left the room with tears in her eyes, saying: \"God bless the king.\"\n\nHer 55-year-old son, Crown Prince Frederik, was then proclaimed King Frederik X at the Christiansborg Palace.\n\nThe 83-year-old Margrethe is the first Danish monarch to voluntarily step down in almost 900 years. She has reigned in the small Scandinavian country for exactly 52 years, taking the crown on January 14, 1972.\n\nShe keeps her title while Frederik's Australian-born wife becomes Queen Mary.\n\nMargrethe makes way for King Frederik X\n\nThe crowds showed up ahead of the ceremony despite the winter chill.\n\nMargrethe has been a very popular figure in Denmark and the news of her abdication had come as a surprise to all, including Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen who had not been made aware of the intention before her announcement.\n\nThe queen said that she had taken the decision after having health issues that resulted in her having back surgery last year.\n\nFrederiksen will be the one to proclaim the crown prince who will become King Frederik X.\n\nObservers said that Frederik, who enjoys the support of 80% of Danes, will likely differ quite a lot from his mother. He is considered more of an informal figure.\n\nThe Danish monarch has a largely ceremonial role but is required to sign government legislation into law\n\nlo,ab/msh (AP, AFP)"
