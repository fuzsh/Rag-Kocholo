        "text": "Denmark has a new king following the historic abdication of the country's longest-reigning monarch Queen Margrethe II.\n\nBraving near freezing temperatures, thousands of people converged on central Copenhagen for the succession where the 83-year-old passed on the throne to her eldest son with the signing of a declaration in parliament.\n\nKing Frederik X is now the head of Europe's oldest monarchy.\n\nThe former crown prince, 55, was then formally proclaimed king by the country's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on the balcony of Christiansborg Palace in the heart of the Danish capital.\n\nIn his first speech as king, Frederik told the large cheering crowds: \"My hope is to become a unifying king of tomorrow.\n\n\"It is a task I have approached all my life.\n\n\"It is a task I take on with pride, respect and joy.\"\n\nThe king, who at one point was seen to wipe away a tear, was then joined on the balcony by his Australian-born wife Mary, 51, who is now queen, their children Christian, 18, who is the heir to the throne, Princess Isabelle, 16, and twins Princess Josephine and Prince Vincent, both 13.\n\nKaren Holk Jeppesen, 31, a communications consultant who had travelled to Copenhagen for the royal occasion, said: \"It's very rare to witness a real historical moment that you know will be written about in the history books.\"\n\nKasper Wiigh Larsen, 45, said: \"It has really been worth it to stand here and wait all day.\"\n\nUnlike in the UK, there is no coronation ceremony in Denmark.\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camila have sent their \"very best wishes\" to the royal couple.\n\nThe King wrote: \"I look forward to working with you on ensuring that the enduring bond between our countries, and our families, remains strong, and to working together with you on issues which matter so much for our countries and the wider world.\"\n\nHe also paid tribute to \"the many years of service\" of Frederik's mother.\n\nMargrethe stunned the nation of nearly six million on New Year's Eve when she announced her decision to abdicate after 52 years as queen, becoming the first Danish sovereign in nearly 900 years to do so.\n\nShe cited health reasons having undergone major back surgery last February.\n\nDanish royal expert Thomas Larsen said: \"The queen has been here and she has been on the throne for more than 50 years. And she is an extremely respected and popular figure, so people hadn't expected this and they were in shock.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nQueen Margrethe's reign in pictures\n\nWho is the former 'party prince' and Denmark's new monarch?\n\nThe abdication comes 52 years to the day after Margrethe ascended the throne following the death of her father, King Frederik IX.\n\nShe will retain her title as queen.\n\nThe last time a Danish monarch voluntarily resigned was in 1146, when King Erik III Lam stepped down to enter a monastery.\n\nDenmark's monarchy traces its origins to 10th-century Viking king Gorm the Old, making it the oldest in Europe and one of the oldest in the world.\n\nToday the royal family's duties are largely ceremonial.\n\nThe new King and Queen will take the throne at a time of huge public support and enthusiasm for the monarchy."
