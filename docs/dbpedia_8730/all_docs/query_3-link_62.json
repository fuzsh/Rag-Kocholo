        "text": "Danish Queen Margarethe II abdicates throne, her son Frederik X proclaimed king Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen declared 55-year-old man and Australian-born Princess Mary as King and Queen of state Denmark's longest reigning monarch, Queen Margrethe II, has officially stepped down after 52 years on the throne. The 83-year-old queen signed the official declaration of her abdication in favor of her 55-year-old son, Prince Frederik, at the Christiansborg Palace. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen declared Frederik X and Australian-born Princess Mary King and Queen of Denmark. Queen Margarethe II stunned the nation on the New Year’s eve when she announced her decision to abdicate. She is the first Danish monarch in nearly 900 years to voluntarily relinquish the throne. Queen Margarethe’s II abdication violates the country’s centuries-long tradition when the ruling monarch leaves the throne only with his or her death. However, 81% of the country’s residents think that her decision is right and only four percent disagree with it. #business #finance #financialservices\n\nMany of us are challenged with how we communicate with our women - it can be a true battlefield. But rest assured, it's the same for our queens. Take this classic convo between a woman and her man: She: \"We have to communicate about this. Communication is key.\" Him: \"Talking never works!\" She: \"Yes it does.\" Him: \"No it doesn't.\" End of the conversation. But what if she'd say \"What does work for you then?\" That way she didn't have to play the demanding part, the actual male part but the queen's part. She stated her point and was open to hearing his point instead of inflicting an \"only-possible\" way. I experienced this myself over the years and see it over and over again with my clients. We, men, are fixers, we want to solve problems, our queen's problems above all. But if there's no space for that because we don't take it or because we have been absent emotionally and our queen had to fill that 'male' space by becoming the fixer substitute, we become cornered over the years. If our queen gives us that space back by retiring as the fixer or at least makes us understand that we have to play that role, we then can be the man again. And sometimes, my man, sometimes it's just about being there and holding her in your arms - she doesn't want us to fix everything, sometimes she just wants us to be there, in our strength and in silence. #menscoaching #lifecoaching #mensmentalhealth PS. Turn the volume up\n\nAs today's \"Big Men\" battle it out for the top post, let us remind ourselves of our Melanesian roots and the kind of traditional leadership that built egalitarian societies for millenia. This photo taken in the 1880s by Reverend James Chalmers is that of Her Majesty Queen Koloka of Namoa. Koloka was Queen of the Lala (Nara) people who in the present day live in the Kairuku District of Central Province. Here's how Chalmers described Queen Koloka: \"The chieftainess, Koloka, and her husband, were most attentive, and reminded one much of kind, loving chiefs and chieftainesses in Eastern Polynesia.\" With the current debate on equitable distribution of national resources, what lessons can we learn from the egalitarian ideals of the past? How do we resolve the conflict between western social stratification and Melanesian egalitarianism? How to we reconcile western adversarial politics with Melanesian consensus? I wonder what Queen Koloka would have had to say."
