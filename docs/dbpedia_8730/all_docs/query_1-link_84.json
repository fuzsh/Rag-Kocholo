        "text": "(born 1940). Margrethe II served as queen of Denmark for 52 years. She became queen upon the death of her father, King Frederik IX, on January 14, 1972.\n\nMargrethe Alexandrine Thorhildur Ingrid was born on April 16, 1940, in Copenhagen, Denmark. She was born a week after Nazi Germany’s invasion of Denmark during World War II. She spent the war years in Denmark and later attended private schools in Denmark and England. She continued her studies at several European institutions of higher learning, including the University of Cambridge in England and the Sorbonne in Paris, France.\n\nIn 1953 a change to the Danish constitution allowed women to succeed to the throne. Margrethe, the king’s eldest daughter, assumed the title of “throne heiress” at that point. As such, from her 18th birthday, she regularly took part in meetings of the Council of State in preparation for her future duties as queen. (The Council of State is an executive body comprising the Danish monarch, cabinet ministers, and heir to the throne.)\n\nOn June 10, 1967, Margrethe married Count Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, a French diplomat. He afterward took the title of Prince Henrik. Their first child, Crown Prince Frederik, was born on May 26, 1968. A second son, Prince Joachim, was born on June 7, 1969.\n\nAs queen, Margrethe II served as Denmark’s ceremonial head of state. Her duties included appointing the prime minister and the cabinet ministers in consultation with the legislature, known as Folketing. In 2022 she celebrated her Golden Jubilee, marking 50 years on the throne. When Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom died in September of that year, Margrethe II became Europe’s only ruling queen and the longest-serving European monarch still reigning.\n\nIn a televised address on December 31, 2023, Margrethe II announced that she would soon abdicate, or give up the throne. She said the back surgery that she had undergone earlier in the year had led to a period of reflection about the future. She ultimately decided that “now is the right time” to pass on her responsibilities. On January 14, 2024—the 52nd anniversary of her becoming queen—she formally abdicated in favor of Crown Prince Frederik. He took the throne as King Frederik X."
