        "text": "The monarch’s role in Denmark is one head of a constitutional monarchy. The Danish Constitution outlines Queen Margrethe’s role: she is the head of state of Denmark and Commander-in-Chief of the Danish Defence Forces.\n\nThough she cannot act independently with regard to politics, all laws are passed in her name and are only legal once she signs—and a cabinet minister countersigns the act.\n\nShe holds joint legislative power in Denmark with the Folketing (the Parliament). Though she could deny any bill, royal assent or dismiss the Prime Minister or any government ministers, it’s not a power that she has ever exercised. The last time this occurred was when her grandfather, Christian X, dismissed the government, which led to the Easter Crisis of 1920.\n\nSeveral further regulations in the Danish Constitution outline how a monarch must be raised and the duties they must carry out to reign. Queen Margrethe, or any Danish monarch, cannot reign in foreign countries without the permission of Parliament.\n\nA monarch must be 18 years of age in order to reign, as must the heir to the throne; and if the monarch is underage when ascending to the throne, a statute will be issued to dictate what happens with regards to a regent, or if there is no heir, the Parliament will elect a monarch and determine a succession.\n\nThe Danish monarch must be a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church and, before their reign begins, must declare their intention to follow the Danish Constitution in writing.\n\nQueen Margrethe’s duties are funded by the Civil List, which is a grant determined by the Parliament to pay for official duties, the upkeep and maintenance of residences and other state property pieces needed during her reign. There cannot be a debt on the Civil List. Additionally, annuities are provided to members of the Royal Family as determined by Parliament but are limited to activities and duties within the Danish realm.\n\nConcerning constitutional matters, the Danish Constitution reads: “The King shall have supreme authority in all the affairs of the Realm, and shall exercise such supreme authority through the Ministers.”\n\nQueen Margrethe has permission to act on behalf of Danish interests internationally but cannot carry out any duties that would see Denmark’s territory increase or reduce, terminate any treaties, or agree to any acts that would require Parliament action.\n\nQueen Margrethe regularly hosts Council of State meetings where she gives royal assent to bills and meets with the Prime Minister to discuss matters of state. When elections are held, she invites the winning party to her residence and asks them to form a government in her name.\n\nShe carries out state visits, both incoming and outgoing, and receives the credentials of ambassadors to Denmark. As the fount of honour in Denmark, Queen Margrethe alone can appoint titles.\n\nQueen Margrethe, as monarch, is also head of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Denmark, though she jointly shares this responsibility with Parliament.\n\nIn order to rule, the Danish monarch must be a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church; it’s also a requirement of the members of the Danish Royal Family. Spouses are not required to convert, but both Prince Henrik (late consort of Queen Margrethe) and Crown Princess Mary converted to Lutheranism upon marriage.\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark extends to the realms of Greenland and the Faroe Islands, both of which count Queen Margrethe as their head of state. Both countries, though, have a significant degree of self-governance."
