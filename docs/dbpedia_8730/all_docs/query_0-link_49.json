        "text": "Figured I give some insight to treaties and a call to action. TRC call to action: 94. We call upon the Government of Canada to replace the Oath of Citizenship with the following: I swear (or affirm) that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, Her Heirs and Successors (King Charles now), and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Canada including Treaties with Indigenous Peoples, and fulfill my duties as a Canadian citizen. [6] Did you know: Between 1760 and 1923, the British Crown signed 56 land treaties with Indigenous Peoples. The ones we mainly see now are the numbered treaties. Curious to know if anyone recently swore an Oath of Citizenship to see if it was implemented?\n\nHis Royal Majesty, Oba N’Edo UkuAkpolokpolo Ewuare II of Benin, a king among king , His assertion that Benin people founded lagos had been Misinterpreted and taken out of context by Certain group and individual,who felt offended by the Monarch remarks, his Royal majesty was basically referencing historical fact, the Oba of benin was referring to Isale EKo, not the lagos Mainland and it Environs, importantly his Royal majesty err in his erroneous belief that, the benin founded or discovered lagos, instead of using the word they conquer and settled in isale EKo a major part of the lagoon island, the benin horde arrived and set up War camp in isale EKo, the Name EKo remains a living testimony of the historical presence of the benin occupation force during the late 15 century , the bini war troop only named the island as Isale EKo, not lagos and it Environs, it is a historical fact that the First Settler , who are the Aboriginal settler were the Aworis & ijebus. Olofin ogunfunimire an intrepid hunter from ile-ife lead an Awori Migration down through the Ogun river, he settled in present day isheri , his Co-traveller and Sons dispersed and founded iddo, Agege,Ado ota, Ogudu, Agboyi, irenpa, Ebutte-metta...... Aromire one of Olofin ogunfunimire founded Isale EKo where he Cultivate pepper farm and his subject engage in Fishing. So the Claim by Oba of benin that the benin founded lagos is incorrect, But it is historical fact that Benin war troop defeated the Aworis on the island, and established a War Camp , the Benin empire was expanding it territory during the 16 Century, at these time , the Empire was at peak, it was already a Formidable Maritime power in the bight of Benin, at this time the portuguese were already a Maritime trading partner with the Benin empire, Oba Orohobua (1550 to1578) Continue the expansionist policy of his Predecessor, Oba Orohobua was a learned king , he was educated by the portuguese jesuit school in portugal. During his Expansionist raid, he made the lagoon island , specifically isale EKo as a War Camp , he defeated the Aworis settler on the island, the War Camp 'EKo', became the name of the town, Which the king Portuguese Advisor renamed it Lagos, because of it lagoon System, the establishment of this War Camp on Lagos island appeared to have Marked the beginning of benin Control and influence in Lagos, the truth is benin influence and conquest introduce Dynastic development and Absolute Monarchy into lagos.\n\n👑 Denmark's Queen Margrethe II abdicated after a 52-year reign, with the ceremony held today. Queen Margrethe, a distant cousin of the late Queen Elizabeth, assumed the throne at the age of 13. Her reign holds historic significance, as the constitution was rewritten to enable a woman to succeed the throne. She was known to be a chain smoker, flamboyant, and with a passion for art and archaeology. She was a scenographer, a costume designer, and a book illustrator. The Queen certainly offers valuable lessons for other rulers and Organizations: 1. 𝐃𝐨𝐧'𝐭 𝐛𝐞 𝐚𝐟𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐦𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬: Queen Margrethe's decision to reduce the number of Danish royals, despite family backlash, to cut public costs demonstrates the importance of tough decisions in the face of long-term sustainability. Making tough, strategic decisions are important to ensure Org success. 2. 𝐄𝐦𝐛𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐞 𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐫𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲: She was known for being approachable. Many of the royals attended state schools. They were widely seen as hardworking and approachable. This included actively engaging on social media, televised events and documentaries. Accessibility, relatability and evolving with time helped her connect to younger generations. Approval rates remained consistent at 80%+. Through transparency and relatability, Organizations can connect better with their customers and stakeholders. 3. 𝐊𝐧𝐨𝐰 𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐧 𝐭𝐨 𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝐝𝐨𝐰𝐧: Just like Queen Margrethe's decision to abdicate, (rulers) and Organizations should recognize the right time to pass the baton. 4. 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐬𝐮𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧: The transition to Crown Prince Frederik highlights the importance of grooming future leaders, ensuring they are ready to take over when the time comes. Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark held military positions, was dedicated to public service, and promoted Danish interests, particularly in sustainability, health, and sports. He's also an accomplished athlete, an International Olympic Committee member, and a key diplomat, strengthening international ties. Similarly, Organizations should ensure a succession plan is in place. 5. 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐢𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐝𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 & 𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞: The Queen’s dedication to serve her Country and promote the Danish culture and arts serve as an example for Organizations to demonstrate commitment towards their mission and stakeholders.
