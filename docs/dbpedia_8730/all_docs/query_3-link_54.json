        "text": "Denmark’s prime minister has proclaimed Frederik X king on the balcony of Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen, after Queen Margrethe II formally signed her abdication, ending her 52-year reign as the country’s longest-serving monarch.\n\nTens of thousands of people gathered on the streets of the Danish capital on Sunday to greet Frederik and bid farewell to Margrethe, who became the first Danish monarch in nearly 900 years to abdicate voluntarily.\n\nAt 3pm exactly, the doors to the Christiansborg balcony opened and the new king came out waving, as he was met with huge cheers from the thousands standing outside and an explosion of silver confetti. The crowd, some dressed in crowns, others drinking champagne, waved red and white flags.\n\nHe was joined by the prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, who thanked the outgoing queen and praised the new king before leading a chorus of cheers, raising her arm as she did so. “Long live King Frederik the 10th,” she said.\n\nThen it was the turn of the new king, who paid tribute to his mother, his wife and his family before being joined by the new Queen Mary, dressed in white, followed by their four children: Christian, 18, who is heir to the throne, Princess Isabelle, 16, and twins Princess Josephine and Prince Vincent, 13. Australian-born Mary is the first commoner to become queen in Denmark.\n\nIn his first speech as king, Frederik said from the balcony: “My hope is to become a unifying king of tomorrow. It is a task I have approached all my life. It is a task I take on with pride, respect and joy.”\n\nFrederik had automatically become the new king earlier in the day when his mother signed an abdication declaration in the Council of State. She left the room with tears in her eyes, saying: “God bless the king.”\n\nThe abdication comes two weeks after a surprise announcement in her New Year’s Eve speech that left much of the country reeling. Even Frederiksen, a Social Democrat and previously not considered a royalist, said the queen’s handling of the role had converted her.\n\nCoachloads of people from around the country arrived in the capital, as well as visitors from around the world, for the once-in-a-generation event and many of the city’s hotels were fully booked.\n\nMany children wore homemade cardboard crowns and all-in-one warm suits, holding red and white flags to greet the passing procession of the outgoing queen and incoming king. There were also Greenlandic flags and Australian flags, the latter on display in reference to the nationality of Queen Mary.\n\nMany spectators carried vacuum flasks to help them stay warm in temperatures that were close to freezing, as well as cans of beer and mini-bottles of champagne. Queues formed outside hotdog stands, and bicycle stands were full.\n\nAccording to protocol, there was no coronation ceremony: Denmark has not had once since the introduction of the constitution in 1849. Instead the succession officially took place at Christiansborg Palace, when the queen signed a declaration of her abdication.\n\nAmong the crowds outside the palace was Rikke LaCour, 47, who had organised a day-long schedule for her friends, who were dressed in red capes, crowns and holding signs of support, to celebrate.\n\nThe day started with a 6am outdoor swim and was planned to end with watching the fireworks at the Tivoli Gardens amusement park.\n\nHolding a handwritten cardboard sign that said “Frederik X king of the people”, LaCour said: “We will stay here until they leave, then go back and have some champagne and cakes with monograms and then fireworks.”\n\nHer friend, Karin Beukel, also 47, added: “We’re celebrating both of them [the outgoing queen and the new king]. She’s done a tremendous job and it’s OK she’s now going on pension … The coming king is ready. And then we’re just here to have fun. It’s a good day to celebrate. Why not?”\n\nLotte Christensen, 39, took her four-year-old twins August and Laura to watch the procession as it passed Kongens Nytorv.\n\nShe said: “They saw the abdication on New Year’s Eve and that’s quite big for a four year old. It’s something a lot of kindergartens have been talking about this week.”\n\nAmong those to send their good wishes to the outgoing queen was her cousin Sweden’s King Carl Gustaf, who wrote on the Swedish royal family’s Instagram page: “Your Majesty, dear cousin Daisy. When you step down today from your high office as Queen of Denmark, I want to say a warm thank you for the good cooperation over the years.”\n\nFrederik and Mary are assuming the role at a time when they and the Danish monarchy have high approval ratings, according to polls. Mary met Frederik at the Sydney Olympics in 2000. They have four children.\n\nMargrethe, who had previously said she would remain on the throne for life, did not give a reason for her decision to step down but said that the back surgery she underwent in February last year had led her to consider her future."
