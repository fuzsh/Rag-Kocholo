        "text": "Denmark’s Royal Family is one of the oldest monarchies in the world, and its seat is Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen. As a visitor to the city, you can experience life as lived by the current Danish Royal Family, as well as their ancestors, as you walk down cobblestone streets and around gilded palaces, as well as in glorious deer parks and in Copenhagen shops.\n\nIn 2022, the Royal Family will stand in an even larger spotlight than usual as Queen Margrethe celebrates 50 years on the throne with Golden Jubilee celebrations and events throughout the year.\n\nBut no matter when you visit Copenhagen, there are multiple ways to experience the royal city and participate in experiences fit for a queen. Discover castle ruins buried beneath the city going back hundreds of years, and court purveyors offering the perfect souvenir for you to take home. See a throne, once believed to be made of unicorn horns and go behind the scenes at a real royal palace. March beside the Royal Guard down the city streets accompanied by a piped band, and sip tea in a royal court-approved tea shop. Whatever you’re interested in seeing in Copenhagen, there’s almost certainly a royal connection.\n\nIn 2022, Queen Margrethe II will mark her Golden Jubilee. It celebrates her 50-year reign as head of state of Denmark, the Faroe Islands, and Greenland.\n\nOver the past half-century, the Queen has represented Denmark at home and abroad and is a much-loved figure in the country. Her motto ‘God’s help, the love of the people and the strength of Denmark’, reflects her approach to her role.\n\nThroughout 2022, Denmark will be celebrating its monarch with events around the country, including in Copenhagen.\n\nEvents from the Royal House's calendar to celebrate the Golden Jubilee:\n\n10 January - HM The Queen will hold a press conference at Amalienborg.\n\n14 January - HM The Queen’s Golden Jubilee. Among other events, the Queen will attend the Privy Council meeting and later lay a wreath at Frederik IX and Queen Ingrid’s grave to remember the 50th anniversary of the king’s death.\n\n21 May - In honour of the Queens Golden Jubilee, an international ballet gala has been arranged at the Tivoli Concert Hall with prominent and world-class ballet dancers from all around the world. The ballet gala is divided into 3 acts, showcasing the world's leading ballet companies and their distinctive history and traditions. The ballet will be attended by her Majesty the Queen along with members of the Danish Royal Family. For those who do not secure a ticket in the Concert Hall, the entire ballet gala will be shown live on a big screen in front of the Concert Hall on the Lawn. Furthermore, Tivoli guests can look forward to the official opening of an exhibition in the Tivoli Gardens on the 21 of May with selected ballet costumes designed by the Queen through her 20 years of artistic work at Tivoli.\n\n10 September - Due to the sad announcement about Queen Elizabeth II's death on the 8th of September, it is HM the Queen's wish to cancel the grand changing of the guard at Amalienborg Castle at 12:00. The visit to Copenhagen City Hall with entertainment is postponed until a later date. The command performance on the Old Stage of The Royal Danish Theatre will continue to be held in a modified form. In addition, the evening’s planned musical performance at Krinsen on Kongens Nytorv is canceled.​​\n\n11 September - Celebratory church service at the Church of Our Lady – Copenhagen Cathedral will go forward in a modified form. At midday, a luncheon will be held on the Royal Yacht Dannebrog. In the evening, The Queen will hold a gala banquet at Christiansborg Palace, which will be carried out in a modified form. The royal family, foreign guests and representatives of official Denmark will participate. TV 2 will host an entertainment show.\n\n23 September - The Queen will hold a soirée for the Government, the Danish Parliament, and Danish members of the European Parliament. The soirée is part of the celebration of the jubilee of The Queen’s accession to the throne, and, in addition to having dinner, the guests and the royal family will also be entertained in the Great Hall at Christiansborg Palace."
