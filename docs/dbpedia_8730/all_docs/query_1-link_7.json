Click to download the free sample version Download sample\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMargrethe II is the world’s only Queen regnant, the longest-reigning European monarch, and considered the longest-serving incumbent female head of state, reigning for almost fifty-one years. Margrethe declared during her annual New Year’s Eve address on December 31, 2023, that she would abdicate in favor of her son, Crown Prince Frederik, on January 14, 2024, the 52nd anniversary of her accession.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information about Margrethe II, or you can download our 22-page Margrethe II worksheet pack to utilize within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nMargrethe was born a Princess of Denmark on April 16, 1940, at Frederik VIII’s Palace, in her parents’ palace at Amalienborg.\n\nMargrethe was the first child of King Frederick IX and Queen Ingrid. Her father was King Christian X’s oldest son, and her mother was the sole daughter of King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden.\n\nMargrethe was named after her late maternal grandmother, Crown Princess Margareta of Sweden. She was given the Icelandic name órhildur because her paternal grandfather was also King of Iceland at the time of her birth.\n\nDue to changes in succession laws enacted in the 1850s, when the Glücksburg branch was chosen to succeed, only men could ascend to the Danish throne at the time of her birth.\n\nThe process of rewriting the constitution began in 1947, shortly after Margrethe’s father ascended to the Queen, and it became evident that Queen Ingrid would not have any more children.\n\nThe popularity of Frederick and his daughters and the increased prominence of women in Danish life triggered the complex process of changing the constitution.\n\nThe plan had to be approved by two succeeding Parliaments and then by a referendum, which took place on March 27, 1953. According to male-preference cognatic primogeniture, a female can accede to the throne only if she has no brother; the new Act of Succession allowed female succession to the throne of Denmark. As a result, Princess Margrethe became the putative successor.\n\nMargrethe met French diplomat Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, who was legation secretary at the French Embassy in London while she was studying in London. They announced their engagement on October 5, 1966, and married on June 10, 1967.\n\nLaborde de Monpezat was given the title and style of His Royal Highness Prince Henrik of Denmark due to his new position as the wife of the Danish heir presumptive.\n\nMargrethe gave birth to her first male child on May 26, 1968, less than a year after the wedding.\n\nDanish rulers were traditionally named Frederick or Christian. She chose to keep this by becoming a Christian and naming her oldest son Frederik. On June 7, 1969, a second child, Joachim, was born.\n\nLIFE AS A QUEEN\n\nShortly after delivering his New Year’s Address to the Nation at the 1972 turn of the year, King Frederick IX became unwell and died 14 days later on January 14, 1972. Margrethe ascended to the throne at 31, becoming Denmark’s first female monarch under the new Act of Succession.\n\nPrime Minister Jens Otto Krag declared her Queen from the balcony of Christiansborg Palace on January 15, 1972. Queen Margrethe II gave up all of the monarch’s previous titles except for the title to Denmark.\n\nThe Queen’s primary responsibilities are representing the Kingdom overseas and serving as a unifying figure at home.\n\nShe does the latter by, among other things, opening exhibitions, attending anniversaries, and inaugurating bridges.\n\nAs a constitutional monarch, the Queen does not participate in party politics or express political views. Although she has the right to vote, she chooses not to use it in order to avoid the appearance of partisanship.\n\nThe Queen formally appoints the government once it has been formed. Officially, the Queen is the head of state, and as such, she presides over the Council of State, commonly known as the privy council, where acts of legislation agreed upon by parliament are signed into law. The Cabinet of Denmark exercises practically all of the Queen’s formal powers.\n\nMargrethe’s thorough understanding of and connection to all sections of the Danish Realm has been the foundation of her reign.\n\nThe Queen is colonel-in-chief of the Princess of Wales Royal Regiment, a British Army infantry regiment, continuing a tradition that began in 1906, when Edward VII, married to Alexandra of Denmark, appointed his brother-in-law, Frederick VIII of Denmark, colonel-in-chief of the then Buffs.\n\nMARGRETHE IN THE PUBLIC’S EYE\n\nThe Guardian, a British daily newspaper, named Margrethe one of the fifty best-dressed over-50s in March 2013, and on her 80th birthday, she was tagged “An Unsung Style Heroine of the British Vogue.”\n\nShe is credited with modernizing Danish royalty throughout her half-century reign. When she was crowned nearly 52 years ago, only 45% of Danes supported the monarchy, with the majority believing it had no place in a contemporary democracy. Conversely, Margrethe has managed to avoid scandal and modernize the institution by permitting her two sons to marry commoners.\n\nThe Danish monarchy is presently one of the most popular in the world, with more than 80% of Danes supporting it.\n\nDENMARK UNDER MARGRETHE’S REIGN\n\nDenmark and the European Union\n\nDenmark formally sought to join the European Communities (EC), the forerunner to the European Union (EU), on August 10, 1961. However, then-French President Charles de Gaulle opposed British admission, and Denmark refused to join the EC without the United Kingdom.\n\nThe European Union is a transnational political and economic union of 27 member nations predominantly centered in Europe.\n\nDenmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom joined the EC on January 1, 1973, after a lengthy discussion and a change in the French presidency.\n\nThe EC gained acceptance and appreciation in Denmark by most Danish people in 1986 when the Single European Act was passed.\n\nDanes raised political awareness of Euroscepticism and had a reputation as reluctant Europeans. The first Danish Maastricht pact referendum was held on June 2, 1992, but the pact still needs to be ratified due to a vote count of less than 50,000.\n\nFollowing the failure, the pact was amended by adding the Edinburgh Agreement, which provides four Danish exclusions. The pact was eventually ratified the following year, on May 18, 1993, following a second referendum in Denmark.\n\nIn October 2012, Denmark Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt requested a 1 billion kroner rebate in the European Union’s budget. Denmark and the European Union agreed on a seven-year budget in February 2013 to approve the Danish demand.\n\nThe Danish Unified Patent Court membership referendum was accepted with 62.5% of the vote on May 25, 2014, which led to a referendum on the Home and Justice Affairs opt-out, held on December 3, 2015.\n\nABDICATION\n\nMargrethe II announced her abdication as Queen of Denmark in a New Year’s Eve address on December 31, 2023. The abdication took effect on January 14, 2024, and she was succeeded by her eldest son, King Frederik X. Margrethe’s abdication marked the first voluntary abdication of a Danish monarch since King Eric III in 1146.\n\nWhen Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom died on September 8, 2022, Margrethe II became Europe’s longest-reigning monarch, the world’s sole Queen regnant, and the longest-serving female head of state.\n\nThe Queen mentioned her severe back surgery in February 2023, stating that the operation caused her to reconsider her position and examine whether she needs to pass the responsibility to the next generation.\n\nAccording to Helen Russell’s article, ‘All of Denmark is crying’: Danes react to Margrethe II’s abdication, published in The Guardian, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, the Danish prime minister, and a few others were the only people aware of Margrethe’s intention prior to the announcement.\n\nMargrethe II of Denmark Worksheets\n\nThis fantastic bundle includes everything you need to know about Margrethe II across 22 in-depth pages.
