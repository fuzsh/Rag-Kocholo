        "text": "Margrethe II (Margrethe Alexandrine 횧처rhildur Ingrid; born 16 April 1940) was the Queen regnant of Denmark from 1972 until her abdication in 2024.\n\nPrincess Margrethe was born at Amalienborg Palace, Copenhagen. Her parents were Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Ingrid. She was baptised on 14 May 1940 at the Naval Church in Copenhagen. As King Christian X of Denmark was also the King of Iceland at the time of her birth, the Princess was given an Icelandic name, 횧처rhildur (spelled with the Icelandic thorn character, simplified as \"th\").\n\nShe studied archaeology at Girton College, Cambridge, from 1960 to 1961. She was also at the London School of Economics in 1965.\n\nMargrethe was not born to be monarch, even though she was the eldest child of the Crown Prince, later King. At the time of her birth, only males could ascend the throne of Denmark.\n\nThe act of succession was changed in 1953.\n\nHer father King Frederik IX died in 1972, and Queen Margrethe II became the first female Danish Sovereign.[1][2]\n\nIn 2018, her husband Prince Henrik died of pneumonia in February and her first cousin Princess Elisabeth died in June.\n\nOn 31 December 2023, during her annual New Year's Eve address, Margrethe announced that she will abdicate the throne in favour of her son, Crown Prince Frederik, on 14 January 2024, exactly 52 years after she ascended the throne to Frederik X.[3] [4]\n\nTitle\n\n16 April 1940-14 January 1972 Her Royal Highness Princess Margrethe of Denmark\n\n14 January 1972 -14 January 2024 Her Majesty The Queen of Denmark\n\n14 January 2024 Her Majesty Queen Margrethe"
