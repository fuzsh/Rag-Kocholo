        "text": "Queen Margrethe II was the previous reigning monarch of Denmark. Born in 1940, she was the longest-serving monarch in Denmark’s history.\n\nQueen Margrethe announced her abdication from the throne during her New Year address this year, and stepped down as the Queen of Denmark on 14 January 2024.\n\nHow old is Queen Margrethe of Denmark?\n\nMargrethe Alexandrine Þórhildur Ingrid was born on 16 April 1940, making her 83 years old.\n\nMargrethe is the eldest child of King Frederick IX and Queen Ingrid, and she has two younger siblings, both sisters – Princess Benedikte of Denmark who was born in 1944, and Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark (now Queen Anne-Marie of Greece) who was born in 1946.\n\nMargrethe married Henri de Laborde de Monpezat in 1967, and the pair had two sons: Frederik and Joachim.\n\nHow long has Queen Margrethe been queen?\n\nQueen Margrethe II has reigned as the monarch of Denmark for almost 52 years, and is currently the longest-serving monarch in the entire world.\n\nMargrethe succeeded to the throne on 14 January 1972 following her father’s unexpected death, and was 31 years old when she became Queen.\n\nDuring her annual New Year’s Address, Queen Margrethe announced that she would be abdicating from the throne, and will step down as the Queen of Denmark on 14 January 2023, exactly 52 years to the day since she became Queen.\n\nThe reason for her abdication is as a result of her recent illnesses and injuries. In her New Year’s Address, she said that time had taken its “toll”, and her number of “ailments” had increased, and that she cannot undertake as many duties as she managed in the past.\n\nIn the official statement from the Danish Royal Family, they stated “When HM The Queen abdicates at the Council of State on Sunday, 14 January 2024, it will be the first time in nearly 900 years that this has happened in Denmark – thus, it will be an extraordinary and historic event.”\n\nHow tall is Queen Margrethe of Denmark?\n\nQueen Margrethe is actually relatively tall, standing at 1.82m or 5 feet and 10 inches tall.\n\nIn fact, the entire Danish Royal Family is quite tall with Queen Margrethe’s father being 1.92m tall, and her two sons, Frederik and Joachim, being 1.83m and 1.88m respectively.\n\nIs Queen Margrethe related to Queen Elizabeth?\n\nThanks to Queen Victoria of England, many of the royal families across Europe are related to one another. Victoria earned herself the nickname ‘Grandmother of Europe’ as she encouraged her children to marry strategically, and many of her nine children married into European royalty.\n\nQueen Margrethe II of Denmark was related to the late Queen Elizabeth II of England through Queen Victoria as well as King Christian IX of Denmark, and the two monarchs were third cousins.\n\nDoes the royal family of Denmark speak English?\n\nIn short, yes, the Danish royal family are known to be fluent in English. However, most members of the royal family speak Danish the majority of the time."
