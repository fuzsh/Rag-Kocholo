        "text": "Baptism\n\nWelcome to Baptism – the sacrament that opens the door of faith to your child and into the Roman Catholic Church. The baptism of your child offers a great opportunity to deepen your appreciation for and experience of the faith.\n\nTherefore at St. Anthony Church in Wailuku, there is a mandatory Baptism Class that both parents and godparents must attend. The Baptism Class is to help prepare you and help you understand more about the sacrament. The class helps clarifies each person’s role in the child’s faith formation and spiritual growth. Thus, why it is very important that parents and godparents make time for this class.\n\nFor Baptism, you may select two godparents/sponsors. However, only one is required. If one is chosen, he/she must fulfill the qualifications listed on the Baptismal godparent(s) Form. If two are chosen, one must be male and one female; also, at least one must fulfill all godparent requirements.\n\nThe following is a checklist for you to help in getting the necessary documents to our office before the baptism of your child(ren).\n\nConfirmation is a sacrament of Christian Commitment and a deepening of baptismal gifts. Like Baptism and Eucharist, it is a Sacrament of Initiation for Catholics and of faith in God’s fidelity to us. It confers on a person a greater responsibility in Christian life.\n\nOur program for youth covers a two year period of instruction for students. A copy of your baptismal certificate is required when you register for classes and schedule an interview.\n\nResponsibilities of the Parents:\n\nAttendance at Parent Orientation meeting and others as required\n\nAssisting your child’s readiness for the reception of the sacrament and then respecting that decision\n\nParticipation in the major liturgical celebrations of the program\n\nEncouragement of the newly confirmed to continue his or her involvement in the parish\n\nResponsibilities of the Candidate:\n\nSelection of a Sponsor\n\nFaithful attendance at the Catechetical sessions\n\nInvolvement in 100 hours of Christian service projects\n\nParticipation in retreats, liturgical services, interviews and other activities of the program\n\nWriting a formal request for Confirmation to the Pastor\n\nSelection of a confirmation name (i.e. a Saint’s name) and submit a report on selection.\n\nResponsibilities of the Sponsor:\n\nAttendance at meetings for Sponsors\n\nPossession of basic knowledge of the theology of initiation and an understanding of the essential nature of Christian Community\n\nA commitment of personal time to the candidate throughout the entire period of preparation\n\nContinued renewal of his or her own spiritual life during the process of preparation\n\nWillingness to give time to the candidate even after the celebration of Confirmation\n\nContinued contact with the youth of preparation regarding the progress of the candidate\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact us at (808) 244-4148 or sacmaui@rcchawaii.org\n\nTo register, go to the Forms page and complete the Religious Education registration form.\n\nBaptized children who are in at least the second grade are eligible to begin their preparation for the sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist. In our parish, this is a two-year process with students receiving their First Reconciliation in May of year one and their First Communion in May of year two.\n\nChildren who have been baptized but not received First Reconciliation and First Holy Communion and who are at least in the 5th grade are eligible to participate in the Sacramental Preparation program. This program prepares the student to receive First Reconciliation and First Holy Communion. It is a two-year process with students receiving Religious Education instruction at their appropriate grade level in their first year and Sacramental Preparation in their second year. This program is available to students in grades 5 to 11.\n\nTo learn more or enroll your child, please contact us at (808) 244-4148 or sacmaui@rcchawaii.org\n\nYoung people have gifts that can transform a faith community, if the community is open to those gifts and the changes that they may necessitate. Youth ministry is as much about helping young people as it is about helping young people to share their gifts with the parish community.\n\nYouth Ministry, as defined by the US Bishops in Renewing the Vision, includes middle school youth (grades 6-8) and high school youth (grades 9-12). These age groups should be ministered to within different programs and events because of age and developmental differences.\n\nGoals of Catholic Youth Ministry:\n\nGoal 1: To empower young people to live as disciples of Jesus Christ in our world today. (RTV, p.9)\n\nGoal 2: To draw young people to responsible participation in the life, mission, and work of the Catholic faith community. (RTV, p. 11)\n\nGoal 3: To foster the total personal and spiritual growth of each young person. (RTV, p. 15)\n\nTo learn more about or join our Youth Ministry, please contact us at: (808) 244-4148 or sacmaui@rcchawaii.org\n\nAdult faith formation is a process, an approach, a philosophy.

Developing and strengthening one's relationship with the person of Jesus as well as with his Body, the Church, is tantamount. Confirmation empowers the faithful to more fully live out their baptismal call; sacramental preparation should be offered with this goal in mind.\n\nLet us help you get started on the confirmation process! Please contact our office at (808) 244-4148 or sacmaui@rcchawaii.org\n\nA pdf version of the full guidelines for Adult Confirmation can be found here: https://www.catholichawaii.org/media/647264/adult-confirmation-guide.pdf\n\nCatholic schools exist for the formation and education of their children in the Catholic faith, gospel values, traditions, and the love and knowledge of the person of Jesus Christ.
