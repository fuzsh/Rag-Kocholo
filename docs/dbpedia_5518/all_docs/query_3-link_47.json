        "text": "Home\n\n>\n\nCatholic Living\n\n>\n\nVocations\n\n>\n\nDeacons\n\n>\n\nHawaii Deacons\n\nThe Ministry of the Deacon\n\n\"Brothers, select from among you seven reputable men, filled with the Spirit and wisdom, whom we shall appoint to this task...\" Acts 6:3\n\nThe ministry of the Permanent Diaconate is new, yet in another sense, ancient; it traces its roots to the time of the Apostles.\n\nThe Diaconate flourished as an official ministry in the Early Church but, in time it became a step toward priesthood and, thus, became a transitional office. The Second Vatican Council restored the Permanent Diaconate as a unique way to serve the people of God in a threefold ministry of word, sacrament and charity.\n\nThe introduction of the Ministry of the Permanent Diaconate to the diocese of Honolulu in 1978 was a bold and forward thinking event that demonstrated a true commitment to providing this service in a unique and powerful way.\n\nThe Deacon is empowered by his bishop to administer Infant Baptism, witness marriage, officiate at wakes, funerals and burial services, administer sacramentals, preside at prayer services, distribute Holy Communion, Proclaim the gospel and deliver the homily.\n\nThe Deacon's ministry of charity calls him to areas of need in which he demonstrates particular expertise or talent. These areas may include hospital/hospice chaplaincy, prison ministry or other works designed to assist the poor and marginalized members of society.\n\n\"The deacon is the Sacrament of Service\"\n\nBishop Larry Silva\n\nCanonical & Diocesan Requirements of All Applicants\n\nHave a history of active service in parish or diocesan ministry.\n\nHave proven leadership within a parish or diocesan institution.\n\nHave demonstrated ability to relate well to people regardless of ethnic, racial, or cultural background, sex, religion, or economic status.\n\nHave potential ability to represent the Church in applying Gospel values to contemporary concerns and issues.\n\nHave an acceptance of Magisterial teachings with particular acceptance of the teachings of Vatican II.\n\nBe an active, fully initiated (Having received Sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist) male member of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nBe of mature faith, good reputation, and have a sense of the nature of the Permanent Diaconate as a vocation in Holy Orders.\n\nBe a legal resident of the United States and have resided in the Diocese of Honolulu for a minimum of three (3) years.\n\nBe, at a minimum, a high school graduate or equivalent and demonstrate the ability to do advanced academic studies via prerequisite on-line work.\n\nBe at least 35 years of age at time of ordination.\n\nBe able to provide a doctor's certification of good health.\n\nBe able to fulfill formation requirements extending over a period of five (5) years.\n\nBe able to speak, understand, read and write English to specific levels of competency.\n\nBe a practicing Catholic for at least three (3) years prior to submitting application.\n\nConcerning Marriage and Celibacy\n\nMARRIED APPLICANTS must:\n\nBe validly married in the Catholic Church.\n\nObtain the written consent of his wife who must be willing to participate in all formation sessions.\n\nFamily Responsibility is primary. The applicant must give due consideration to the ages of his minor children. During the period of formation, time demands on both the applicant and the wife will be significant. This fact must be carefully considered, especially by a family with young children.\n\nAn UNMARRIED applicant must understand the current Church discipline requiring celibacy for life for the Permanent Deacon. He should discuss this requirement thoroughly with his pastor, another priest, or an unmarried deacon.\n\nA WIDOWED applicant must have a minimum of three (3) years readjustment/grieving period before applying.\n\nInquiry and Application Process\n\nApplications will be accepted only after attendance at a Deacon Formation Inquiry Weekend. Upcoming dates and details will be published in the News & Events section of this website and in the diocesan eNewsLetter. If interested, we invite you to visit our Inquiry and Application Process page.\n\nAttendance is mandatory for all those contemplating the submission of an application.\n\nMarried applicants must attend the weekend as a couple. Applications will not be accepted without the wife's attendance.\n\nAll expenses (including airfare for neighbor islanders) will be borne by the diocese. Voluntary donations to offset the expense will be accepted upon completion of the weekend.\n\nAcademic Prerequisites\n\nSuccessful completion of three designated courses (Catholic Beliefs, Introduction to Scripture and Survey of Catholic Doctrine) offered \"on-line\" through the Virtual Learning Center for faith Formation (VLCFF) will be required prior to entering Aspirancy Year (the first year of Formation).\n\nInformation on registration for the VLCFF is available through the University of Dayton. For questions or assistance in registering for VLCFF courses, please contact Lina Carahasen, Administrative Associate, Office of Permanent Deacon Formation at lcarahasen@rcchawaii.org."
