For the county, see Honolulu County, Hawaii. For other uses, see Honolulu (disambiguation).\n\nScript error: No such module \"Unsubst\".

It is an unincorporated county seat of the consolidated City and County of Honolulu, situated along the southeast coast of the island of Oʻahu,[lower-alpha 1] and is the westernmost and southernmost major U.S. city. Honolulu is Hawaii's main gateway to the world. It is also a major hub for business, finance, hospitality, and military defense in both the state and Oceania. The city is characterized by a mix of various Asian, Western, and Pacific cultures, as reflected in its diverse demography, cuisine, and traditions.\n\nHonolulu means \"sheltered harbor\"[9] or \"calm port\" in Hawaiian;[10] its old name, Kou, roughly encompasses the area from Nuʻuanu Avenue to Alakea Street and from Hotel Street to Queen Street, which is the heart of the present downtown district.[11] The city's desirability as a port accounts for its historical growth and importance in the Hawaiian archipelago and the broader Pacific region. Honolulu has been the capital of the Hawaiian Islands since 1845, first of the independent Hawaiian Kingdom, and after 1898 of the U.S. territory and state of Hawaii. The city gained worldwide recognition following Japan's attack on nearby Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, which prompted decisive entry of the U.S. into World War II; the harbor remains a major naval base, hosting the U.S. Pacific Fleet, the world's largest naval command.[12]\n\nAs Hawaii is the only state with no incorporated places below the county level,[13] the U.S. Census Bureau recognizes the approximate area commonly referred to as the \"City of Honolulu\"—not to be confused with the \"City and County\"—as a census county division (CCD).[14] As of the 2020 U.S. Census, the population of Honolulu was 350,964,[15] while that of the urban Honolulu census-designated place (CDP) was 802,459. The Urban Honolulu Metropolitan Statistical Area had 1,016,508 residents in 2020.[5] With over 300,000 residents, Honolulu is the most populous Oceanian city outside Australasia.[16][17]\n\nHonolulu's favorable tropical climate, rich natural scenery, and extensive beaches make it a popular global destination for tourists. As of May 2021, the city receives the bulk of visitors to Hawaii, between 7,000 and 11,000 daily. This is below the 2019 passenger arrivals of 10,000 to 15,000 per day.[18]\n\nHistory[]\n\nScript error: No such module \"For related page\".\n\nPage Template:Stack/styles.css has no content.\n\nEvidence of the first settlement of Honolulu by the original Polynesian migrants to the archipelago comes from oral histories and artifacts. These indicate that there was a settlement where Honolulu now stands in the 11th century.[19]Template:Unreliable source? After Kamehameha I conquered Oʻahu in the [[Battle of Nuʻuanu]] at [[Nuʻuanu Pali]], he moved his royal court from the Island of Hawaiʻi to Waikīkī in 1804. His court relocated in 1809 to what is now downtown Honolulu. The capital was moved back to Kailua-Kona in 1812.\n\nIn November 1794, Captain William Brown of Great Britain was the first foreigner to sail into what is now Honolulu Harbor.[20] More foreign ships followed, making the port of Honolulu a focal point for merchant ships traveling between North America and Asia. The settlement grew from a handful of homes to a city in the early 19th century after it was selected by Kamehameha I as a replacement for his residence at Waikiki in 1810.[21]\n\nIn 1850, Kamehameha III moved the permanent capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom from Lahaina on Maui to Honolulu.[21] He and the kings that followed him transformed Honolulu into a modern capital, erecting buildings such as St. Andrew's Cathedral, [[ʻIolani Palace]], and [[Aliʻiōlani Hale]]. At the same time, Honolulu became the center of commerce in the islands, with descendants of American missionaries establishing major businesses in downtown Honolulu.[22]\n\nDespite the turbulent history of the late 19th century and early 20th century—such as the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893, Hawaiʻi's subsequent annexation by the United States in 1898, followed by a large fire in 1900, and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941—Honolulu remained the capital, largest city, and main airport and seaport of the Hawaiian Islands.[23]\n\nAn economic and tourism boom following statehood brought rapid economic growth to Honolulu and Hawaiʻi. Modern air travel brings, as of 2007 , 7.6 million visitors annually to the islands, with 62.3% entering at Honolulu International Airport.[24] Today, Honolulu is a modern city with numerous high-rise buildings, and Waikīkī is the center of the tourism industry in Hawaiʻi, with thousands of hotel rooms.\n\nGeography[]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the Urban Honolulu CDP has a total area of Template:Convert/km2, of which Template:Convert/km2, or 11.56%, is water.[25]\n\nHonolulu is the most remote major city in the U.S. and one of the most remote in the world.[26] The closest location in mainland U.S. is the Point Arena Lighthouse in northern California, at Template:Convert/nmi.[27] (Nautical vessels require some additional distance to circumnavigate [[Makapuʻu Point]].) The closest major city is San Francisco, California, at 2,300 miles (3,701 km).[26] However, islands off the Mexican coast and part of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska are slightly closer to Honolulu than the mainland.\n\nThe volcanic field of the Honolulu Volcanics is partially located inside the city.[28]\n\nNeighborhoods, boroughs, and districts[]\n\nDowntown Honolulu is the financial, commercial, and governmental center of Hawaii. On the waterfront is Aloha Tower, which for many years was the tallest building in Hawaiʻi. Currently the tallest building is the 438-foot (Template:Convert/pround m) tall First Hawaiian Center, located on King and Bishop Streets. The downtown campus of Hawaiʻi Pacific University is also located there.\n\nThe Arts District Honolulu, located in both in downtown and Chinatown, is on the eastern edge of Chinatown. It is a 12-block area bounded by Bethel & Smith Streets and Nimitz Highway and Beretania Street – home to numerous arts and cultural institutions. It is located within the Chinatown Historic District, which includes the former Hotel Street Vice District.[29]\n\nThe Capitol District is the eastern part of Downtown Honolulu.
