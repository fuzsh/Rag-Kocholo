        "text": "Home > About the Hawaii Benedictines\n\n\"Listen carefully...to the master’s instructions, and attend to them with the ear of your heart...See how the Lord in his love shows us the way of life.\"\n\n-Prologue to the Rule of St. Benedict\n\nAs Benedictines we are a part of the oldest religious order in the Catholic Church. Our way of life has been followed for nearly 1500 years and is based on Holy Scripture, particularly the Gospels, and the Rule of St. Benedict. Our monastic schedule centers around the praise and worship of God in the celebration of the Eucharist and in the recitation of the Psalms three times a day. Individual prayer and spiritual reading foster intimacy with the Lord Jesus.\n\nEvery monk is motivated by a single goal: Union with Christ. Typically, each Benedictine monastery has its own distinctive characteristics. The Hawaii Benedictines form an integrated community of both women and men. We give emphasis to Life in the Spirit; thus we gratefully accept the activity and gifts (charisms) of the Holy Spirit which Jesus promised to his disciples. Our community also fosters a special love for Mary, the Mother of Our Lord. Daily we pray the rosary together.\n\nWe are a passionate, joyful fellowship of monks, oblates, and volunteers who strive to “listen with the ear of our hearts” in order to both “choose the better part” like Mary by sitting at the feet of Jesus and to “go and make disciples of all nations” like the Apostles within the vibrant multicultural community of the Hawaiian Islands. If you are seeking peace, healing, inspiration, or guidance we invite you to come on retreat. If Christ is calling you to pursue a vocation to religious life within a monastic community that is both contemplative and active, then we welcome you to come visit our ohana (family).\n\n“This message of mine is for you, then, if you are ready to give up your own will, once and for all, and armed with the strong and noble weapons of obedience to do battle for the true King, Christ the Lord.”\n\n-The Rule of St. Benedict\n\nIdentity\n\nThe Benedictine sisters and brothers of Mary, Spouse of the Holy Spirit Monastery desire to respond daily to Our Lord’s invitation to live an abundant life. With the Gospel as our guide we profess to live in these times the values of Our Lord Jesus Christ. We willingly embrace the monastic way of life seeking to open ourselves to God who is always seeking us. The source and foundation of authenticity in a Benedictine monastery is the Holy Spirit. In all things the members strive for fidelity to the Church. Inspired by the Gospel, the Rule of St. Benedict, centuries of Benedictine tradition—and yet attentive to the changing conditions of the times—our monastic way of life serves as a witness to the reality of God’s presence among all people.\n\nWe are a monastic community of celibate men and women, invited by God, touched by his love, and prompted by the Holy Spirit to seek union with Jesus. Professing conversion of life, stability, obedience, celibacy, and poverty, we seek to liberate ourselves through these vows to follow Christ along the narrow way that leads to eternal life. Through a balanced rhythm of prayer, work, leisure, and study, our way of life promotes an environment conducive to the well-being of persons, the building of relationships, and service to others.\n\nWith Mary, patroness of the monastery, as Mother and guide, we desire to give our “Yes” to Jesus. She brought forth Jesus, giving God flesh through her faith. Following her example, we give our “Yes” to God and abandon ourselves to the Holy Spirit so that Jesus may take flesh in our lives. In this school of the Lord’s service, following the Benedictine Rule, we are enabled to run along the way with hearts enlarged by love, so that, united with Christ, we can say with St. Paul, “It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me” (Galatians 2:20).\n\nCharism and Mission\n\nWe live a life of both prayer and action. Our goal is to promote authentic peace—God’s peace—within every person. Our mission is to spread the light of Christ and to minister to the spiritual needs of the people of the Catholic Diocese of Honolulu and to all the people of Hawaii. All are invited to share in the monastery’s daily life of prayer and work, including: chanting the Divine Office, celebrating daily Mass, praying the Rosary, adoring Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament, meditation, spiritual reading, and the work of cooking, cleaning, maintenance, and taking care of the beautiful grounds.\n\nIn our outreach we desire to keep our hearts open to the many needs of the people of Hawaii. All visitors are welcomed like Christ and every guest receives the blessing of prayer. Spiritual direction, day retreats for groups and overnight retreats for individuals, days of reflection, formation of oblates in Benedictine spirituality, and healing prayer are provided at the monastery. We have seen the power of prayer, witnessing its effects in promoting healing and wholeness in individuals and families. We are committed to prayer for all the people of these islands and the world.\n\nMembers of the monastic community also minister outside the monastery in various apostolates. In addition to offering a year-long series of classes in Benedictine spirituality in preparation for becoming an oblate, the monastery also has a longtime association with the Basic Christian Community of Hawaii. The Benedictines also participate in Hawaii’s Catholic charismatic movement, pro-life ministries, youth and young adult ministries, spiritual direction, healing and deliverance ministries, and ministry to those suffering from economic and social inequality. The priests also occasionally assist local parishes in celebrating Mass and the Sacraments.\n\nHistory"
