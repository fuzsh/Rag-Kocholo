        "text": "The current mission is the oldest of the three and dates back to 1889. Following a fire, a new church in Honomu was built and was subsequently blessed by the Bishop of the Territory of Hawaii in 1921. That same decade saw the construction of both St Anthony and Immaculate Heart of Mary Parishes. Ironically, both of the other parish churches would experience fires, too. These occurred in the in the mid-1980s and the current church buildings date from the latter part of the 1990s.\n\nThe history of our community can actually be traced back to at least 1866 with the establishment of Star of the Sea Church in Kalaoa, located on what is now called the Scenic Route. Being around that long, our community has shared in all that East Hawaii has experienced in the last century and a half. These include natural disasters - earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions - as well as the economic displacement caused by the demise of the sugar industry on the island. With the end of sugar growing and harvesting on the island, agriculture, primarily the growth and harvesting of papaya, macadamia nuts, sweet potatoes and ginger continues. Our parish members are entrepreneurial and many trades are professions are represented in our community.\n\nWhile we are one community, the two parishes remain distinct and independent of each other but they do share a pastor. In addition, Good Shepherd and Immaculate Heart of Mary Mission share a Pastoral Council as well as resources devoted to Religious, Sacramental and Liturgical Education.\n\nOur community reflects the island on which we live. We are a diverse people who share a common faith and share freely what has been so graciously given to us.Our community stretches along the Hamakua Coast on the island of Hawaii and comprises two churches and a mission. The two churches are Immaculate Heart of Mary Church in Papaikou and, going north along the coast, St Anthony Parish in Laupoahoe. Good Shepherd Mission is in Honomu, approximately half way between the two parishes, and is officially attached to Immaculate Heart of Mary Church. The current mission is the oldest of the three and dates back to 1889.
