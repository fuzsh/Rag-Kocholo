        "text": "The Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace stands as one of the relatively rare cathedrals in Hawaii.

Its construction was finalized in August 1843. When Libert Boeynaems took charge of the cathedral, he had grand aspirations of transforming it into a Gothic masterpiece, akin to those found in Europe.
