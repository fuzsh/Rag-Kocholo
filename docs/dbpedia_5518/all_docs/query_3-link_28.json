        "text": "SACRAMENTS\n\nBaptism\n\nFor infants, contact the office for a registration form, and to find out the next preparation classes for Parents and Godparents. For older children and adults, enroll them in one of the following programs.\n\n1st Holy Communion, Confirmation:\n\nReligious Education (K-8), Youth Ministry (9-12), Young Adult Ministry, and RCIC/RCIA are starting in September. Contact the office for more information\n\nHoly Matrimony:\n\nMarriage is a very significant event and requires preparation to celebrate it properly. If you are planning to marry, the Diocesan policy is that you see a Priest and begin the preparation at least six months prior to the wedding date. Please call the rectory for an appointment.\n\nCannot Marry in the Catholic Church Due to Prior Marriage?\n\nPope Francis streamlined the process to petition for a declaration of nullity to make the process shorter. He also eliminated the mandatory fee. If a person is able to prove in this process that their prior marital bond was invalid for some reason, then he or she can marry in the Catholic Church or validate a current civil marriage. For assistance in petitioning, you can contact Fr. PJ Camiring, Vanessa Mark, BJ Schreiner or Sister Lucinda at [808-988-3308] who can assist you as an advocate.\n\nVocations:\n\nContact Fr. Nick Brown\n\nFunerals Arrangements\n\nThough not a Sacrament, when death occurs, contact the parish office immediately\n\nFeast of St. Bartholomew\n\nAugust 24\n\nIn the New Testament, Bartholomew is mentioned only in the lists of the apostles. Some scholars identify him with Nathanael, a man of Cana in Galilee who was summoned to Jesus by Philip. Jesus paid him a great compliment: “Here is a true Israelite. There is no duplicity in him”. When Nathanael asked how Jesus knew him, Jesus said, “I saw you under the fig tree”. Whatever amazing revelation this involved, it brought Nathanael to exclaim, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel”. But Jesus countered with, “Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than this”.\n\nNathanael did see greater things. He was one of those to whom Jesus appeared on the shore of the Sea of Tiberias after his resurrection. They had been fishing all night without success. In the morning, they saw someone standing on the shore though no one knew it was Jesus. He told them to cast their net again, and they made so great a catch that they could not haul the net in. Then John cried out to Peter, “It is the Lord.”\n\nWhen they brought the boat to shore, they found a fire burning, with some fish laid on it and some bread. Jesus asked them to bring some of the fish they had caught, and invited them to come and eat their meal. John relates that although they knew it was Jesus, none of the apostles presumed to inquire who he was. This, John notes, was the third time Jesus appeared to the apostles.\n\nSaint Louis IX, King of France\n\nAugust 25th\n\nThe Seventh Crusade\n\nWhen, in 1248, Louis IX went to liberate the Holy Land, he embarked with his bride, Margaret of Provence, but he was taken prisoner. Once released and returned to his realm, he undertook great reforms, including in particular the interdict of the judicial duel (or trial by ordeal). He funded hospitals and monasteries and realized his great project: building the \"Sainte-Chapelle\" as a shrine of light and colored glass intended to accommodate the relics, especially the thorns of Christ’s crown, which he had acquired from the Byzantine Emperor. To his sister, Blessed Isabel, he gave the lands of Longchamp to build the abbey for the Sisters of Saint Clare.\n\nLouis IX, King of France\n\nHis reign saw an era of great cultural, intellectual and theological evolution. Saint Louis loved to host his Saint Bonaventure and Saint Thomas Aquinas at his table. With Robert of Sorbon, he founded the Sorbonne University in 1257. He followed with great care the completion of the cathedral of Notre Dame, in particular the rosettes and porticoes. His greatest concern was to pacify, to reconcile with enemies and to extinguish conflicts, specifically the one between France and England. He dreamt of returning to the Holy Land and of converting the Sultan of Egypt: nevertheless, he would never reach beyond Carthage, in present day Tunis, for disease would kill him on August 25, 1270.\n\nThe Prestige of Paris\n\nUnder the reign of Louis IX, Paris became the most prestigious city of Western Christianity, with its university, Sainte Chapelle and Notre Dame. No one was surprised that his canonization process began only two years after his death, especially in view of the miracles and healings that took place at his grave. In 1297, at the end of a long investigation, Pope Boniface VIII raised Louis IX to the glory of the altars, making him one of the saints of the Catholic Church. August 25, the anniversary of his death, became his canonical feast. Louis IX, king of France, was one of the first lay people to become recognized as a saint through the process of canonization.\n\nJustice and Peace\n\nThroughout his life, Louis IX was committed to reigning with justice and in peace, according to his call to holiness, which he lived in his role as a statesman. The sovereigns of Europe appealed to his wisdom. Known then for his sense of justice and for his love of God and the poor, he is represented with the symbols of the cross, the hand of righteousness, and the cincture of the Franciscan tertiaries, of whom he is the Patron saint."
