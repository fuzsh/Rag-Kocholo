It handles petitions for declarations of marital nullity and other judicial causes that come before the bishop for adjudication.\n\nThe Office for Canonical Affairs promotes a greater understanding of the law of the Church (canon law) and helps assure that the provisions of canon law are implemented correctly and equitably. It provides canonical advice, education and assistance to the bishop, diocesan and parish staff, religious orders and other Catholic institutions and associations, and the faithful of the diocese.\n\nDeclarations of Nullity:\n\nTo petition for a declaration of nullity based on a Defect of Consent using the Ordinary Process, click here. This file has the preliminary investigation form, petition, and witness list for a formal cause seeking a declaration of marital nullity. You can fill in the form on the computer, print it out, and bring it to your parish priest or deacon in the Diocese of Honolulu whom you would like to serve as your procurator-advocate. The priest or deacon completes the last page. For more information on the steps of the process and grounds, click here.\n\nHave you been asked to serve as a witness for a Honolulu diocese marriage nullity cause? Click here for a witness form. You can type the form on the computer, print, sign, and mail to Tribunal. You can also scan and email the form to us, although it must include your signature.\n\nTo petition for a declaration that a marriage was not binding due to a Lack of Canonical of Form, click here. This petition is only for a marriage involving one or two Catholics, if not before a priest or deacon and two witnesses, and if no dispensation from canonical form is granted by the bishop. This applies only to Catholics. It does not require the ordinary nullity process. Only documents proving that the marriage took place outside the Catholic Church without a dispensation and without ever being validated are necessary.\n\nMarriage Services:\n\nProvided by the Office for Canonical Affairs:\n\nGrants marriage dispensations and permissions\n\nGrants ecclesiastical approval for interdiocesan marriages for marriages taking place in Hawaii or for marriages going outside of Hawaii Sample letter of permission for marriage elsewhere\n\nProcesses Pauline privilege petitions\n\nGrants Radical Sanations\n\nCatholic Engaged Encounter:\n\nHawaii Engaged Encounter On-line Registration\n\nMarriage Manual:\n\nThe following are the documents and forms included in the Diocese of Honolulu Marriage Manual:\n\nList of Tabs\n\nMarriage Preparation Norms\n\nPrenuptial Investigation with Affidavits Affidavit of Freedom to Marry\n\nDispensations and Permissions Radical Sanation Petition\n\nHow to Handle Prior Marriages\n\nLack of Canonical Form\n\nDefect of Consent (Ordinary Process)\n\nPauline Privilege\n\nInitiation Resources:\n\nFlow Chart for the Sacraments of Initiation\n\nNorms for the Preparation for and Celebration of the Sacraments of Initiation and First Penance\n\nAdult Initiation Inventory\n\nGodparent/Sponsor Certification Form Certificación para Padrinos y Madrinas\n\nList of Churches and Ecclesial Communities with Valid Baptism\n\nOther Documents:\n\nSacramental Register Instruction\n\nParish Finance Council Norms\n\nNorms for Associations of the Faithful, Movements, Programs, and Other Organizations\n\nInstruction Regarding Allegations of Sexual Harassment and Sexual Misconduct Against Clerics\n\nDecrees about Offerings for Sacraments, Funerals and Blessings and about Mass Offerings\n\nPriest Personnel Norms\n\nInstruction Regarding Sacraments and Funerals in Situations Involving Physician Assisted Suicide"
