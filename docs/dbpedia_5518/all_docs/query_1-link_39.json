        "text": "Kailua (Hawaiian pronunciation: [kɐjˈluwə]) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Honolulu County, Hawaii, United States. It lies in the Koʻolaupoko District of the island of Oʻahu on the windward coast at Kailua Bay. It is in the judicial district and the ahupua'a named Ko'olaupoko. It is 12 miles (19 km) northeast of Honolulu – over Nu‘uanu Pali.\n\nIn the Hawaiian language Kailua means \"two seas\" or \"two currents\", a contraction of the words kai (meaning \"sea\" or \"sea water\") and ʻelua (meaning \"two\"); it is so named because of the two former fishponds in the district (Kawainui and Kaʻelepulu) or the two currents that run through Kailua Bay.\n\nKailua is primarily a residential community, with a centralized commercial district along Kailua Road. The population was 50,000 in 1992. In 2017 census, the population had dropped to 38,000. The population was 40,514 at the 2020 census.\n\nPlaces of note in Kailua include Kailua Beach Park, Kaʻōhao or Lanikai Beach, Kawainui Marsh, Maunawili Falls, and Marine Corps Base Hawaii. It was home to Barack Obama’s winter White House.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history\n\nDuring the reign of King Kākuhihewa and his successors, Kanekapu, Kahoowaha, Kauakahiakahoowaha, and Kualiʻi, Kailua replaced Waikiki as the residential seat of the Oʻahu Rulers (aliʻi nui of Oʻahu). Many ancient temple ruins, such as those at Ulupo Heiau State Historic Site, are in the area. After the Oʻahu army's defeat by King Kamehameha the Great at the Battle of Nuʻuanu in 1795, the political capital and residential seat of the aliʻi nui of Oʻahu was relocated from Kailua to Honolulu.\n\nBeach\n\nKailua Beach is crescent-shaped, about 2.5 miles (4.0 km) long, and ranging between 50 and 150 feet (15 and 46 m) wide. The ocean bottom fronting the beach slopes gently to overhead depths without any coral heads. Light to medium waves support surfing and bodysurfing. The steady trade winds make Kailua Beach a top windsurfing and kitesurfing destination. Robby Naish, first World Champion of windsurfing and Professional Windsurfers Association Hall of Fame inductee, grew up in Kailua.\n\nSea kayaking and stand-up paddleboarding to the protected seabird sanctuaries Flat Island and the Nā Mokulua, popularly known as \"the Mokes\", have become increasingly popular water activities at the beach.\n\nGeography\n\nKailua is located at (21.397370, −157.739515). Nearby towns include Kāneʻohe, Maunawili, and Waimānalo.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has an area of 10.6 square miles (27.4 km2), of which 7.8 square miles (20.1 km2) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2) (26.62%) is water. A significant portion of the water area is Kawainui Marsh, the largest wetland in the Hawaiian Islands and a Ramsar Convention site.\n\nKaʻōhao/Lanikai\n\nKaʻōhao (pronounced [kəʔˈoːhao]) is the earliest known Hawaiian name for the place known as \"Lanikai.\" Kaʻōhao means \"the tying\" and is derived from an old story in which \"two women were tied together here with a loincloth after being beaten in a kōnane game\". Kaʻōhao was commercially developed in the 1920s and renamed \"Lanikai.\" It is now an unincorporated community in Kailua on the windward coast at Kailua Bay. Lanikai Beach was rated one of the world's top ten beaches by Sherman's Travel Magazine. The area is known for its white, powder-like sandy beach and its hiking trail along the Kaʻiwa Ridge to the World War II military bunkers commonly known as the \"Lanikai Pillboxes\". Because of its small community and easy access to its famous beach, Lanikai has one of Hawaii's most expensive real estate markets. It is served by Kailua's zip code, 96734.\n\nClimate\n\nKailua has a tropical savanna climate.\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical population Census Pop. %± 2020 40,514 — U.S. Decennial Census\n\nAs of the census of 2020, there were an estimated 40,514 people and 12,387 households with an average of 3.04 people per household in Kailua. The population density was 5,212.8 inhabitants per square mile (2,012.7 inhabitants/km2), which was less dense than that of Honolulu (5842.0 per square mile or 2255.6/km2). There were 4,322 housing units in Kailua at an average density of 121.7 per square mile (47.0/km2).\n\nThe racial makeup of Kailua was 44.8% White, 0.9% Black or African American, 0.2% Native American, 19.3% Asian, 4.4% Pacific Islander, 1.4% from other races, and 29.0% from two or more races. The Kailua population had a greater percentage of White residents and a lower percentage of Asian residents than the state in aggregate (25.3% and 38.6% respectively). 8.6% of the Kailua population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.\n\n12.7% of Kailua residents reported having a language other than English spoken at home, less than the state average of 26.1%. The age of the population in Kailua was varied, with 5.8% of inhabitants being under the age of 5, 21.6% being under the age of 18, and 19.3% being above the age of 65. For every 100 females, there were 97.4 males.\n\nThe median annual household income in Kailua was $122,706, and the per capita annual income was $51,260. 5.0% of the population in Kailua was estimated to be below the poverty line, which was below the state average of 11.2%. Approximately 35.0% of businesses in Kailua were minority-owned, a rate nearly double that of the national average of 18.7%.\n\nTourism\n\nHistorically, most tourism on the island of O'ahu has centered around Waikiki and other tourism-designated areas. But tourism has also been a major economic force in Kailua, and tourism-related jobs have historically made up roughly one-third of total employment in Hawaii. The Obama family vacations, as well as coverage from various social media and travel sites, sparked new interest in Kailua as a tourist destination and led to an influx of tourists to Kailua. This influx led to pushback from some Kailua residents, prompting proposals of legislation to limit tourist activity there.\n\nWinter White House\n\nBarack Obama vacationed in Kailua between 2008 and 2012. In 2010, 2011, and 2012, the Obama family stayed in the rented, ocean-front house Plantation Estate in the Paradise Point Estates. The house was built by developer Harold Kainalu Long Castle, who also lived there. Obama also took a vacation break in August 2008 at a different house in Kailua, Oahu Lani, during the 2008 United States presidential election.\n\nEducation\n\nPublic schools\n\nThe Hawai'i Department of Education operates the public schools.\n\nElementary schools in the CDP include Aikahi, Enchanted Lake, Kaʻelepulu, Kailua, Kainalu, Keolu, and Maunawili. Kailua Intermediate School, Kalaheo High School, and Kailua High School are also in the CDP. Kailua High and Maunawili Elementary were defined as being in the Maunawili CDP as of the 2000 Census, but in Kailua CDP as of the 2010 Census.\n\nKaʻōhao Public Charter School was previously known as Lanikai Elementary Public Charter School and opened in 1964. It became a charter school in 1996, and it received its current name in 2017.\n\nMokapu Elementary School is on the nearby Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH), outside of the CDP but with a Kailua address.\n\nArea private schools\n\nCatholic schools of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu:\n\nSt. Anthony School\n\nSt. John Vianney School\n\nOthers:\n\nFilms\n\nMovies and TV shows filmed in Kailua include:\n\nCommunity\n\nKailua hosts various events throughout the year, from block parties to fireworks.\n\nNotable people\n\nMike Akiu, American football player\n\nWally Amos, founder of the \"Famous Amos\" cookie brand\n\nAlpha L.
