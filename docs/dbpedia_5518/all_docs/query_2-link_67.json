        "text": "Msgr. Albert G. O’Connor, a beloved priest of the Diocese of Sacramento for more than 56 years, died on April 11 in Sacramento. He resided most recently at Mercy McMahon Terrace in Sacramento.\n\nBishop Jaime Soto will preside at a funeral Mass on Thursday, April 25 at 10:30 a.m. in the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, located at 1017 11th St. in Sacramento. A reception will follow the Mass in Mercy Hall. The burial will follow at 2:30 p.m. at St. Mary Cemetery, located at 6509 Fruitridge Road in Sacramento.\n\nThe viewing and vigil will be held on Wednesday, April 24, at Holy Spirit Church, located at 3159 Land Park Dr. in Sacramento. The viewing will begin at 4 p.m. and the vigil will begin at 7 p.m.\n\nMsgr. O’Connor, pastor of Holy Spirit Parish in Sacramento from September 2005 to July 2010 and of St. Joseph Parish in Elk Grove from April 1986 to August 2005, retired on July 1, 2010 and was named Pastor Emeritus of Holy Spirit Parish.\n\nPrior to serving at St. Joseph Parish, he served as chancellor of the Diocese of Sacramento from 1980 to 1986, while in residence at St. Mel Parish in Fair Oaks. He also served as vice chancellor of the diocese from April 1973 to October of 1980, while also serving as administrator of Immaculate Conception Parish in Sutter Creek from April 1978 to October 1980.\n\nFrom January 1972 to October 1980, Msgr. O’Connor served as Vice Officialis of the Tribunal, while in residence at St. Anne Parish in Sacramento. He was assistant pastor of Sacred Heart Parish in Sacramento from September 1969 to February 1972, and of St. John Vianney Parish in Rancho Cordova from September 1967 to September 1969.\n\nHe was named Chaplain of His Holiness by Pope Paul VI on May 12, 1977. He most recently served on the diocese’s Presbyteral Council from 2012 to 2014 and on the College of Consultors from 2001 to 2021.\n\nMsgr. O’Connor was born in a small town in Galway, Ireland called Milltown, the youngest of six children born to Patrick O’Connor and Mary Catherine McGoldrick. After his father’s sudden death in 1955, Mrs. O’Connor moved her family from Milltown and settled in Dromod, County Leitrim, where Mrs. O’Connor was born and raised. Msgr. O’Connor attended grade school there for one year and then enrolled at St. Jarlath College, Tuam, where he spent his high school years and graduated in 1961.\n\nHe enrolled in 1961 at All Hallows College in Dublin, where he met James Murphy (now Msgr. James Murphy of the diocese), who told him he was studying for the Diocese of Sacramento. He made a request to the seminary president that he study for the Diocese of Sacramento and was accepted.\n\nHe was ordained to the priesthood on June 18, 1967 in the All Hallows Seminary chapel by Bishop John Scanlon, an alumnus of All Hallows and a priest of the Archdiocese of San Francisco, who became bishop of the Diocese of Honolulu.\n\nIn January 1972, Bishop Alden Bell asked Msgr. O’Connor if he would assume the leadership of the diocese’s Tribunal. Later, under Bishop Francis Quinn, he served for six years as chancellor of the diocese.\n\nMsgr. O’Connor’s term as chancellor was challenging and he was involved in all matter of diocesan business. During this time, the diocese was changing and many new things were introduced, such as establishing job descriptions, pay classifications and a retirement plan for lay employees.\n\nDuring his tenure as pastor of St. Joseph Parish in Elk Grove, he oversaw the tremendous growth of the Catholic population in a city which grew from 10,000 people in 1986 to more than 135,000 people in 2005. This growth called for establishing a mission church in the Laguna area of Elk Grove, which later became Good Shepherd Parish. At the same time, the Rancho Murieta area became a mission church of St. Joseph Parish.\n\nUnder Msgr. O’Connor’s leadership, a new St. Vincent de Paul Mission Church and hall were built in Rancho Murieta in 2000, while the facilities at St. Joseph Parish were enlarged to meet the growing Catholic population in Elk Grove.\n\nAs pastor of Holy Spirit Parish in the Land Park area of Sacramento from 2005 to 2010, Msgr. O’Connor directed the renovation of the rectory, the parish school, and the complete renovation of the church.\n\nUpon his retirement in 2010, Msgr. O'Connor said the happiest times in his ministry were those of serving the people in a parish, either as an associate or as a pastor. For him, the people were always wonderful, supportive and helpful, and serving them was the joy of his life.\n\nHe is survived by his sisters, Sister Theresa O'Connor, FMI, of Eastpointe, Michigan, and Veronica Ryan of West Sussex, England."
