        "text": "The following is the List of the Catholic bishops of the United States, including the five overseas dependencies of the U.S. The Catholic Church in the United States comprises 177 Latin-rite dioceses and 17 Eastern Catholic eparchies led by diocesan bishops or eparchs, plus the Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA. Dioceses led by archbishops are called archdioceses.[1] In archdioceses and some large dioceses, one or more auxiliary bishops serve in association with the diocesan bishop. There are thirty-two Latin-rite and two Eastern Catholic archbishops who serve as metropolitan archbishops of their respective Latin-rite ecclesiastical provinces or Eastern Catholic metropoliae. (One archbishop — that of the Archdiocese for the Military Services — is not a metropolitan.) As of August 2009, five of these metropolitans are cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nAll active and retired bishops in the United States and the Territory of the U.S. Virgin Islands — diocesan, coadjutor, and auxiliary — are members of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB).\n\nIn addition to the 195 dioceses, there are several dioceses in the nation's other four overseas dependencies. In the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the bishops in the six dioceses (one metropolitan archdiocese and five suffragan dioceses) form their own episcopal conference, the Conferencia Episcopal Puertorriqueña.[2] The bishops in U.S. insular areas in the Pacific Ocean — the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Territory of American Samoa, and the Territory of Guam — are members of the Episcopal Conference of the Pacific.\n\nProvince of Anchorage[]\n\nSee: Category:Roman Catholic Ecclesiastical Province of Anchorage\n\nThe Metropolitan Province of Anchorage comprises the state of Alaska.\n\nRoger Lawrence Schwietz, OMI, Archbishop of Anchorage\n\nFrancis Thomas Hurley, Archbishop Emeritus of Anchorage\n\nDonald Joseph Kettler, Bishop of Fairbanks\n\nEdward James Burns, Bishop of Juneau\n\nProvince of Atlanta[]\n\nSee: Category:Roman Catholic Ecclesiastical Province of Atlanta\n\nThe Metropolitan Province of Atlanta comprises the states of Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.\n\nWilton D.
