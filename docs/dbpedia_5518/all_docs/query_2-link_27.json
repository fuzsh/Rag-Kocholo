Alapaki.\n\nPerhaps many of you are already aware and informed of the death of our beloved former pastor +Fr. Alapaki Kim.\n\n+Fr. Alapaki peacefully died in the Lord on Wednesday, May 8th on the Big Island. Though much sorrow and emptiness may be felt in our hearts we are consoled at his death because of our faith and the faith that +Fr. Alapaki lived and as a faithful priest who served the Lord well.\n\n“He who sat on the throne said, I am making everything new.” Revelation 21:5\n\n+Fr. Alapaki who lived in faith knew and held in his heart of the promise of the resurrection and thus despite his grave illness was always strong in faith and never lost the sight of the love of God. Truly we all, especially in St. Rita Parish was blessed by his 25 years of his faithful priesthood in service as a shepherd in our parish.\n\n“His master replied, well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s joy.” Matthew 25:23.\n\nLet us keep +Fr. Alapaki in in our prayers as we remember his contagious smiles and his aloha. We pray; Eternal Rest Grant Unto +Fr. Alapaki O Lord, and Perpetual Light Shine Upon Him. May +Fr. Alapaki and all the souls of the faithful departed in the mercy of God, rest in peace, Amen.\n\n“I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die.” John 11:25.\n\nAloha from Saint Rita Catholic Church, Nānākuli, Hawaii\n\nParish Mission Statement - \"We, the people of God of St. Rita Parish in Nānākuli, are united in our belief and in our commitment to Jesus Christ.
