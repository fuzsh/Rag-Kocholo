This darkness reflects the uncertainty and disillusionment of the post-war era.\n\nSalvatore Quasimodo’s Free Verse Style\n\nQuasimodo is also known for his use of free verse, which diverged from traditional poetic forms and allowed greater freedom of expression.\n\nFlexibility: Free verse gave Quasimodo the flexibility to change rhythm and metre, reflecting the fluctuating emotions and thoughts in his poetry.\n\nLyrical Quality: Despite the lack of a strict structure, his free verse retained a lyrical quality that captivated readers.\n\nModernist Influence: This style aligned with the modernist movement, which sought to break away from conventional forms.\n\nFree Verse: A type of poetry that does not follow specific patterns of rhyme or metre, allowing the poet more flexibility.\n\nMortality in Salvatore Quasimodo’s Works\n\nMortality is another significant theme in Quasimodo's poetry.
