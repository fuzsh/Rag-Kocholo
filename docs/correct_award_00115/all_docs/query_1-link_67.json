        "text": "Italian poet, critic, and translator, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1959. Salvatore Quasimodo's works fall roughly into two periods, divided by World War II. His early poems were difficult with their metaphysical and complex imagery. In later works in his humanistic period he was more concerned with the contemporary history, social conditions, horrors of war, and the problems of human suffering. Many of his poems depict the landscape of Sicily.\n\n\"Here the earth is finished:\n\nwith strain and with blood\n\nI make myself a prison.\"\n\n(from 'Horses of Moon and of Volcanoes,' Ed � subito sera, 1942)\n\nSalvatore Quasimodo was born in Modica, a small town near Syracuse, Sicily, the son of Gaetano Quasimodo, a railway officer, and Clotilde Quasimodo (n�e Ragusa). His father's work took the family to Messina, where they arrived two days after the great earthquake of 1908.\n\nQuasimodo started to read and write at an exceptionally early age and show interest in Greek lyric poetry. When his parents felt that technical training would lead to a more practical career, Quasimodo was sent to the Palermo technical college and then he moved in his teens to Rome, where he studied engineering at the Polytechnical Institute. Because of financial problems, he left the school without completing an engineering degree, but was qualified as a surveyor. For a period he worked for a construction firm.\n\nIn 1926 Quasimodo was appointed to the government Civil Engineering Department. The new job took him to many differents parts of Italy. Eventually he returned to the south in Reggio Calabria, where he wrote his first poems. Quasimodo's brother-in-law, Elio Vittorini, who became a novelist, introduced him to the literary circles. Among his friends were Eugenio Montale, Giuseppe Ungaretti, and Alessandro Bonsati.\n\nAfter meeting Monsignor Rampolla del Tindaro, a Sicilian priest, Quasimodo began to learn Greek. His earliest poems appeared in magazines. His first collection, Acque e terre (Water and Land), came out in 1930, but it included poems written when he was eighteen. Two of the most famous works in the collection are 'Vento a Tindari' and the three-line 'Ed � subito sera': \"Everyone stands alone on the heart of the earth / transfixed by a ray of sun: / and suddenly it's evening.\" (trans. Patrick Barron) Water and Land contained nostalgic poems about Sicily, and reveal moods of loneliness and melancholy. It was followed by Oboe sommerso (1932), Erato e Apollion (1936), and Poesie (1938), in which Quasimodo expression showed influence of symbolism. In 1938 he resigned from his work, and settled in Milan, where he worked as an assistant to Cesare Zavattini, who was editor of several periodicals. Quasimodo was named in 1941 professor of Italian literature at Milan's Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory.\n\nDuring WW II Quasimodo joined a member of an anti-Fascist group, and was briefly imprisoned at Bergamo. His most widely read book, Ed � subito sera, appeared in 1942. After the war in 1945 he became a member of the Italian Communist party. When the party insisted that he should write political poems, he resigned in protest. Giorno dopo giorno (1947) reflected his country's hardships and his horror at Italy's role in the war. It has been characterized perhaps the best volume of poetry to come out of World War II in any country. With the following collection, La vita non � sogno (1949), Quasimodo placed himself in the role of \"rifare l'uomo\" (remake man), a poet of engagement - at moments his poesie sociale bitterly attacked failures of Christians in front of the hopes given by Communists.\n\nQuasimodo's first wife Bice Donetti died in 1948, and he married in 1948 Maria Cumani, a dancer. They separated permanently in 1960. Cumani later acted in Paolo and Vittorio Taviani's I sovversivi (1967), Liliana Cavani's Galileo (1968), Franco Rubartelli's Veruschka (1971), Franco Rossi's Porgi l'altra guancia (1974), and other films. Quasimodo's daughter Orietta was born out of wedlock in 1935 to Amelia Spezialetti, whom he had first met in 1931. Quasimodo's love letters to the feminist writer Sibilla Aleramo (Rina Pierangeli Faccio, 1876-1960), who was engaged in affairs with many male writers, were published in 1983.\n\nQuasimodo died suddenly. While presidenting over a poetry competition in Amalfi, he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and died in Naples, on June 14, 1968. His last four volumes of verse show a continuing concern for social justice, but there are also fond memories of past friends and past loves. His final collection of verse was Dare e avere (1966, To Give and to Have). Besides the Nobel Prize, Quasimodo reveived several other literary prizes, including the Premio Viareggio in 1958 and the Taormina Prize, which he shared with Dylan Thomas in 1953.\n\nRecurrent themes in Quasimodo's works are memories of childhood and the life and culture Sicily. He connects his impressions of the landscape to literary associations, and the cultural heritage from Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and other invaders. In the 1930s he became a leader of the 'hermetic' poet with Eugenio Montale (1896-1981) and Giuseppe Ungaretti (1888-1970), abandoning realism. Hermetic poets were accused of obscurity. They were guided by listening to their own inner voice, and they often used difficult private symbolism. \"Poetry, even lyrical poetry, is always 'speech,'\" Quasimodo said once. \"The listener may be the physical or metaphysical interior of the poet, or a man, or a thousand men.\"\n\nAfter WW II Quasimodo's poetry dealt largely with social issues, reflecting deep concern of the fate of Italy. In 'Discourse on Poetry' he wrote: \"... a poet is a poet when he does not renounce his existence in a given country, at a particular time, defined politically. And poetry is the liberty and truth of that time, and not abstract modulations of sentiment.\" A modernist but acutely conscious of the tension between tradition and innovation, he wrote many essays on literature and translated classical writers and drama, among them such writers as William Shakespeare, Moli�re (Tartuffe), Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Virgil, Catullus. Quasimodo's light-hearted prose translation of Romeo and Juliet from 1949 was performed in Verona. His translations from European and American contemporaries include e.e. cummings and Pablo Neruda.\n\nFor further reading: 'Quasimodo' by G.Cambon, in Chelsea 6, pp. 60-67 (1960); Quasimodo by N.
