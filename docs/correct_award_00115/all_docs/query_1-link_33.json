        "text": "Salvatore Quasimodo\n\nAwards:\n\nNobel Prize in Literature-1959\n\nNobel Committee in its citation stated that the prize was given for \"his lyrical poetry, which with classical fire expresses the tragic experience of life in our own times.\"\n\nBorn: 20/08/1901 in Modica, Italy\n\nDied: 14/06/1968 in Naples, Italy of Cerebral Hemorrhage.\n\nCitizen: Italy\n\nLanguage: Italian\n\nQuasimodo was attracted to poetry at a very early age. At the age of 16, he founded a journal, Nuovo giornale letterario ( New Literary Journal) and published his first poems.\n\nAfter graduating from the local Technical College,Messina in 1919, he moved to Rome to study engineering but abandoned the course midway because of his poor economic condition. Instead, he joined a job as a technical draughtsman to earn livelihood.\n\nIn 1929, he moved to Florence where he met poet Eugenio Montale and Alessandro Bonsanti and was influenced by *Hermetic movement and published his first collection, Acque e terre (Water and Earth) in 1930. In 1931, he was transferred to Imperia and then in 1932 to Genoa. In the same year, he published, Obor Sommerso, which included all his lyrics from 1930 to 1932. In 1934, he moved to Milan and devoted himself to fulltime writing. In 1945, he became a member of Italian Communist Party.\n\nIn 1968, June while he was on a lecture giving tour, he had cerebral hemorrhage and succumbed to the same.\n\nQuasimodo's literary career are divided into two distinct phases, Hermetic period which lasted till Second World War and Post-Hermetic period characterized by disgust and sense of absurdity of war . Both the periods were seamlessly integrated in a poetic quest to understand various stages of life and countdown to death.\n\n* Hermeticism in poetry is a form of obscure and difficult poetry, as of the Symbolist school, wherein the language and imagery are subjective, and where the suggestive power of the sound of words is as important as their meaning\n\nNotable Works: Acque a terre -- Water and Land(1930),Oboe sommerse --Sunken Oboe (1932), Odore di Eucalyptus- Scent of Eucalyptus (1933) ,Erato e Apolion -- (1936), Poesie-- (1938), Ed e Subito Sera-- And Suddenly it's Evening (1942), Giorno dopo giorno- Day after Day (1947)"
