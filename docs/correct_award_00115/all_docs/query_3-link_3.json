        "text": "Salvatore Quasimodo (born Aug. 20, 1901, Modica, Italy—died June 14, 1968, Naples) was an Italian poet, critic, and translator. Originally a leader of the Hermetic poets, he became, after World War II, a powerful poet commenting on modern social issues. He received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1959.\n\nQuasimodo was born in Sicily and was the son of a railroad employee. He was first educated near Syracuse and at Messina, studied engineering and mathematics at Palermo, and then left for the north, graduating as an engineer in Rome. He had liked to write even as a child, and, though he spent the next 10 years as an engineer for the Italian government, he wrote poetry in his spare time.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Poets and Poetic Form\n\nQuasimodo’s first poems appeared in the Florentine periodical Solaria. Initially he was a disciple of the Hermetic poets Giuseppe Ungaretti and Eugenio Montale. After the publication of his first poetry collection, Acque e terre (1930; “Waters and Land”), Quasimodo gradually became a leader of the Hermetic poets. After 1935 he abandoned engineering to teach Italian literature at a conservatory in Milan. Quasimodo’s later poetry collections—Oboe sommerso (1932; “Sunken Oboe”), Odore di eucalyptus (1933; “Scent of Eucalyptus”), and Erato e Apollion (1936)—have the dry, sophisticated style and abstruse symbolism of Hermeticism but include many poems that veer away from personal preoccupations to contemporary issues. With two final collections, Poesie (1938) and Ed è subito sera (1942; “And Suddenly It’s Evening”), his Hermetic period came to a close.\n\nAfter the war Quasimodo’s social convictions shaped his work from the publication of Giorno dopo giorno (1947; “Day After Day”) until his death. Many of his poems recalled the injustices of the fascist regime, the horrors of the war, and Italian guilt. Later poems in the same vein, simple in language, exhibit a concrete and immediate imagery. Later volumes include La terra impareggiabile (1958; The Incomparable Earth)—with an inscription from Aeschylus, “I say that the dead slay the living”—Tutte le poesie (1960), and Dare e avere (1966; To Give and To Have and Other Poems)."
