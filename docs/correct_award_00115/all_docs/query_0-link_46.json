        "text": "Salvatore Quasimodo Italy\n\nSalvatore Quasimodo was born of Sicilian parents in Modica, near Syracuse, in 1901. Interested in becoming an engineer, he enrolled at the Politecnico in Rome, also studying Latin and Greek at the University there, but did not complete his studies. He obtained a position with the Italian government's civil engineering corps, and in 1930 saw the publication of three poems in the avant-garde magazine Solaria, and then his first full-length collection, Acque e terre (Waters and Lands). Two years later, his second collection, Ã’boe sommerso (Sunken Oboe) appeared. In 1938, he left his government position and became editor of the weekly magazine, Tempo; three years later he was appointed to the Chair of Italian Literature at the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory in Milan."
