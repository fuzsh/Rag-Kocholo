He obtained a position with the Italian government's civil engineering corps, and in 1930, saw the publication of three poems in the avant-garde magazine 'Solaria', and then his first full-length collection, 'Acque e terre' (Waters and Lands). Two years later, his second collection, 'Oboe sommerso' (Sunken Oboe) appeared.In 1938, he left his government position and became editor of the weekly magazine, 'Tempo'; three years later was appointed to the Chair of Italian Literature at the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory in Milan.

He also became known as a translator - of the Greek and Roman lyric and epic poets (Sophocles, Aeschylus, Euripides, Ovid and Virgil among them), Shakespeare, Moliere and twentieth-century writers such as Neruda and e.e. cummings. Quasimodo was awarded the Etna-Taormina International Prize in Poetry along with Dylan Thomas in 1953 and, in 1959, the Nobel Prize for literature - \"for his lyrical poetry, which with classical fire expresses the tragic experience of life in our own times\".
