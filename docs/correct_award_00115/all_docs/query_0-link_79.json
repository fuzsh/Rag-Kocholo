He abandoned his studies because of financial pressures. In order to support Bice Donetti, with whom he began to live in 1922 and whom he married in 1925, he worked at several jobs: as a technical designer for a builder; as a store clerk; as a maintenance technician for a large department store in the capital; and with the Italian army engineering corps. As an army worker he was transferred to Reggio Calabria, where in 1928 he decided to compose verses, an activity that increasingly occupied his attention. Quasimodo moved to Florence in 1929, at his brother-in-law Elio Vittorini’s invitation, and there, the following year, he published three poems in the journal Solaria, and, in the same year, his first book of verses, Acque e terre (Waters and Lands). This book signaled the appearance on the Italian poetic scene of a young, yet mature, hermetic poet. The influence of Giuseppe Ungaretti is evident from the first fragment of this collection: “Ed è subito sera” (And Suddenly It’s Evening)–which became the title poem of a book in 1942:\n\nOgnuno sta solo sul cuor della terra\n\ntrafitto da un raggio di sole:\n\ned è subito sera\n\n(Each one stands alone in the centre of the earth\n\npierced by a ray of sun:\n\nand suddenly it is evening)\n\nThis first book also defines the first period of Quasimodo’s poetry, which was heavily influenced by hermeticism, a movement recognized in Italian poetry since 1925, date of publication of Poeti d’oggi, the first anthology of Italian hermetic poets prepared by Giovanni Papini and Pietro Pancrazi. Quasimodo’s first phase also includes Oboe sommerso (Sunken Oboe, 1932), Erato e Apòllion (1936) and Poesie (1938). Hermeticism became the most important Italian poetic school between the two world wars and includes, besides Quasimodo, the works of Ungaretti and Eugenio Mon-tale. Its poetic process is based on analogy and associative images, and it conveys pessimistic meditations on the human condition. Yet, despite an aversion to illusions, the hermetic poet typically believes in poetic beauty. Therefore, critics have seen in Quasimodo a tension between a world of despair, anguish, and solitude, and a mythical paradise lost, the golden island of his childhood, which he enshrined in Greek mythology and ancient traditions, in a setting among the sea and rocks of the Sicilian landscape. “Vento a Tindari” (Wind at Tindari) perhaps best expresses this tension:\n\nTindari, mite ti so\n\nfra larghi colli pensile sull’acque\n\ndell’isole dolci del dio,\n\noggi m’assali\n\ne ti chini in cuore.\n\n(Tindari, I know how pleasant\n\nyou hang on the water between the wide hills\n\nof the sweet islands of the god,\n\ntoday you assail me\n\nand lean into my heart.)\n\nThe fear of alienation from his native land compels Quasimodo to conjure up archetypes of the Sicilian landscape:\n\nSalgo vertici aerei precipizi,\n\nassorto al vento dei pini,\n\ne la brigata che lieve m’accompagna\n\ns’allontana nell’aria,\n\nonda di suoni e amore,\n\ne tu mi prendi\n\nda cui male mi trassi\n\ne paure d’ombre e di silenzi,\n\nrifugi di dolcezze un tempo assidue\n\ne morte d’anima\n\n(I climb up vertical aerial peaks,\n\ncaught in the wind of the pines,\n\nwhile my lighthearted company\n\nmoves further away in the air,\n\nlike a wave of sound and love,\n\nand you take me\n\nyou whom I left unwillingly\n\nand fears of shadows and of silences,\n\nshelters of sweetnesses once assiduous\n\nand death of the soul)\n\nThe elegance and clarity of this composition owes much to a twofold influence: the Greek poetess Sappho and Giacomo Leopardi, who deeply influenced Quasimodo, especially during the hermetic period.\n\nHis second book, Oboe sommerso, is the one that best represents Quasimodo’s hermeticism. His ideal island becomes the archetype of a metamorphosed poetland, in which even human organs are identified with plants or with the mysterious biological process of nature, with a psychological counterpoint of archaic memories. A good example is “Nell’antica luce delle maree” (In the Ancient Light of the Tides):\n\nCittà d’isola\n\nsommersa nel mio cuore,\n\necco discendo nell’antica luce\n\ndelle maree, presso sepolcri\n\nin riva d’acque\n\nche una letizia scioglie\n\nd’alberi sognati.\n\nE i tuoi morti sento\n\nnei gelosi battiti\n\ndi vene vegetali\n\nfatti men fondi:\n\nun respirare assorto di narici.\n\n(Island city\n\nsubmerged in my heart,\n\nnow I descend in the ancient light\n\nof the tides, near the graves\n\non the edge of waters\n\nloosed by a joy\n\nof dreamed trees.\n\nAnd I feel your dead\n\nin the jealous pulsations\n\nof plant-like veins\n\nwhich are not so deep:\n\nand an intense breathing of nostrils.)\n\nAn example of what critics have defined as Quasimodo’s parola-mito (word-myth) is “Parola,” in which the poet conjures an ideal landscape as if nature itself had become animated as a splendid woman ready to embrace him and yet, at the last moment, elusive and unconquerable:\n\nTu ridi che per sillabe mi scarno\n\ne curvo cieli e colli, azzurra siepe\n\na me d’intorno, e stormir d’olmi\n\ne voci d’acque trepide;\n\nche giovinezza inganno\n\ncon nuvole e colori\n\nche la luce sprofonda.\n\nTi so. In te tutta smarrita\n\nalza bellezza i seni,\n\ns’incava ai lombi e in soave moto\n\ns’allarga per il pube timoroso,\n\ne ridiscende in armonia di forme\n\nai piedi belli con dieci conchiglie.\n\nMa se ti prendo, ecco:\n\nparola tu pure mi sei e tristezza.\n\n(You laugh because I waste away for syllables\n\nand bend sky and hills, blue hedge\n\naround me, and helms’ blowing noise\n\nand voice of quivering waters;\n\nbecause I deceive youth\n\nwith clouds and colors\n\nthat the light submerges.\n\nI know you. Wandering beauty\n\nlifts your breasts,\n\nsqueezes your hips and with a gentle motion\n\nopens up your timid pubis,\n\nand lowers in harmony forms\n\ndown to your feet and ten shells.\n\nBut if I take you, there:\n\nyou too are words to me, and sadness.)\n\nThe intimate religious dimension of Quasimodo’s hermeticism is present in “Curva minore” (Lesser Curve), in which recurrent words such as vento (wind), erba (grass), ombra (shade), and sera (evening) acquire a haunting connotation, placed as they are in a descending order from a dynamic allegory (“E fammi vento”) to a gradually subdued reality. The poem reveals a pantheistic lyricism:\n\nPèrdimi, Signore, ché non oda\n\ngli anni sommersi taciti spogliarmi,\n\nsí che cangi la pena in moto aperto:\n\ncurva minore\n\ndel vivere m’avanza.\n\nE fammi vento che naviga felice,\n\no seme d’orzo o lebbra\n\nche sé esprima in pieno divenire.\n\nE sia facile amarti\n\nin erba che accima alia luce,\n\nin piaga che buca la carne.\n\n(Confuse me, Lord, do not let me hear\n\nthe quiet secret years emptying me,\n\nso that I can change sorrow for open motion:\n\na lesser curve\n\nof life is what is left for me.\n\nAnd make me wind that I may sail happily,\n\nor seed of barley or leprosy\n\nwhich may express itself in full becoming.\n\nLet it be easy loving you\n\nin the leaf of grass absorbing light,\n\nin the flesh-decaying sore.)\n\nMuch of Quasimodo’s literary achievement rests on his masterful translations of the ancient Greek poets in Lirici greci (Greek Lyric Poets, 1940), which quickly became the focus of a long-debated literary question concerning the role of the translator. Not only did the book reveal Quasimodo’s originality as a translator, but many would consider this translation his finest work, because of the modern flavor he elicited from texts thousands of years old. Also, he revealed a broader register and a more universal spectrum of tonalities than the usual hermetic style of his own previous collections. A case in point is this fragment from Sappho:\n\nTramontata è la luna\n\ne le Pleiadi a mezzo della notte;\n\nanche giovinezza già dilegua,\n\ne ora nel mio letto resto sola.\n\nScuote l’anima mia Eros,\n\ncome vento sul monte\n\nche irrompe entro le querce;\n\ne scioglie le membra e le agita,\n\ndolce amaro indomabile serpente.\n\nMa a me non ape, non miele;\n\ne soffro e desidero.\n\n(The moon has waned\n\nand the Pleiades are gone in the middle of the night;\n\neven youth is waning,\n\nand now I am alone in my bed.\n\nEros shakes my soul,\n\nlike wind on the mountain\n\nsweeping through the oak-trees;\n\nand it unties and agitates my limbs,\n\nsweet bitter indomitable snake.\n\nBut for me no bee, no honey;\n\nand I suffer and want.)\n\nIn a note appended to his translations from Greek lyrics, Quasimodo asserted: “queste mie traduzioni non sono rapportate a probabili schemi metrici d’origine, ma tentano l’approssimazione più specifica d’un testo: quella poetica” (these translations of mine are not linked to possible metrical schemes in the original, but attempt the most specific textual approximation: a poetic one).\n\nQuasimodo tried to re-create the original feelings. This unusual manner of approach, therefore, has deeper implications for the development of Quasimodo’s poetic style than if he had confined himself to the humbler work of a translator. By concentrating more on catching the spirit rather than the letter of the originals he did, in fact, succeed in enlarging vicariously his own experience, especially during those rare moments when he fully identified himself with the inner feelings of others. Cases of such identification, for instance, are to be found in his translations from Sappho and Alcaeus, because the poetry of both left a definite mark on his own work. Other examples of stylistic gains come from the syntactical or rhetorical patterns inherited from classical texts, notably classical Latin originals. In all probability he learned through the mediation of these influences that he learned, at least partially, to shake off his hermetic straitjacket and base his themes and melodies on deeper lyrical patterns.\n\nAfter the hedonistic ideal and the fin de siècle aes-theticism of the decadent and crepuscular movements, the new school called hermeticism searched for a new form of expression. The direction seemed to point to “pure poetry,” or “poetics of the word,” even if the style and language of poetry seemed to have acquired new meaning, because of the unusual analogies and associations. From the vantage point of chronological perspective in relation to that poetic school, one can say that whereas Ungaretti could qualify as a baroque hermetic, and Montale as an essential hermetic, Quasimodo, the last of the hermetic poets, seems to have been a classical hermetic. Some critics, such as Guillermo de Torre and Angelo Romanó, have stated that, up to a certain point, Quasimodo continues the French Parnassian school of poetry because of his intimate nostalgia for an ideal, lost land. In the case of Quasimodo this fabulous, mythical land is the land of the orange blossoms, Sicily. The Mediterranean Quasimodo, lost in an ultramodern city, submerged in comfort and technological gadgetry–an alienating universe from the simple world of his childhood–felt intimately related to that past land of his dreams. This attitude can be seen–and for some critics this would mean a limitation of his poetry–in the repetitions of certain key words that became commonplace in his first books, such as deserti (deserts), paradiso (paradise), stelle (stars), notte (night), vento (wind), and mare (sea). According to this interpretation, Quasimodo expressed his nostalgia for a lost paradise with a series of commonplaces.\n\nOn the other hand, this approach could indicate the limitations of criticism solely concerned with style.\n\nThat is why it is so important to identify the poetic moment that supercedes the nostalgic longing and actually testifies to a poetic redemption of that Mediterranean paradise of ancient times. With Quasimodo, Italian poetry has regained the vigor of the Mediterranean world of the Magna Graecia, which still survives in southern Italy, with her sea, her rocks, and her cities, and mirrors the intimate soul of the poet, its interpreter. That is why it is paramount to assign the proper place to Quasimodo’s translations of ancient Greek poets. His translations are, in one sense, interpretations, succeeding in bringing back the ancient text and giving it a present-day tonality and flavor, in words and phrases chosen to preserve the original vigor of connotations and analogies.\n\nAfter Romanticism, literary criticism became concerned with the dimension of time, from a linguistic point of view. According to this linguistic dimension, the critic can place a given poetic text in its precise historical and cultural context. This quality of modern literary criticism has been applied to the lyrical creative process, which in its turn has acquired a critical dimension of its own, so that the poetic text can and does bring forth the essential character of a cultural phenomenon, chosen as his lyrical target by the poet. In the case of an ancient text, this method worked splendidly for Quasimodo, since his translations aspire to be actually updated versions of the original work: the translator has sought to give new life and relevancy to these works for the benefit of his contemporary reader.\n\nThis quality of updating ancient texts, so evident in his translations, was a decisive dimension of his evolution as an original poet. Quasimodo succeeded, perhaps better than anyone else, in expressing for a twentieth-century audience the telluric presence of the Mediterranean world and achieving through that expression a universal dimension achieved through the use of archetypes and myths. What readers still admire today in the work of the Sicilian poet is that feeling of a newly discovered landscape of the world in its primeval vigor, without intermediate reflections, so that one has the impression that the only man alive is Ulysses and the only trip that counts is his journey to the ideal Ithaca.\n\nModern Italian literature has frequently dealt with the myth of Ulysses, because in it one can mirror the alienation of modern man, who has abandoned his native land for a Utopian dream but has found himself in the midst of wars and violence, of the denial of permanent values of civilized man, in the shadow of hatred and tyranny. The myth is still the same, but the man has changed. This man is still looking for his own roots, but instead he finds himself trapped by a way of life that he has neither chosen nor can change. For Giovanni Pascoli, Ulysses is the man beloved by the goddess, Calypso, who departs for his last destination in order to see again, at the end of his life, the place of an unknown happiness. For Umberto Saba, Ulysses is a traveler who has not kept a place for the only woman who loved him. For Quasimodo, Ulysses is the symbol of Mediterranean man, whom he conceives as a dimension of every man and, at the same time, as an impossible archetype, gradually and inexorably transformed by the advancing technological society.\n\nQuasimodo’s new humanism has been linked to his Marxist sympathies. But one can discount a direct relationship between his outspoken political views and his innermost lyrical vocation. From this point of view, Quasimodo’s poetry is better described in terms of a cycle rather than stages, a cycle that begins with the “pure poetry” of Acque e terre and culminates with the humanistic poetry of Giorno dopo giorno (1947, Day after Day). The link between the two is the philosophical search for the essence of the Mediterranean man. For Quasimodo the linguistic search of hermeticism was enriched by the philosophical search in his humanistic poetry. Linguistics and philosophy go hand in hand, so the linguistic sign carries a philosophical content. The lesson of Giambattista Vico had been that all language is metaphorical. Behind each word there is an original attitude. For instance, Homer’s language amounts to an inventory of a civilization. When linguistics discovers an ontological message in a word, it converges into philosophy. The principle of the search for the deeper meaning of a word is a fundamental method of any translator. Quasimodo is best defined as a poet-translator, as we can see in one of his most popular poems, “Vento a Tindari,” the last stanza of which reveals how the translator has enriched his own poetry:\n\nTindari serena torna;\n\nsoave amico mi desta\n\nche mi sporga nel cielo da una rupe\n\ne io fingo timore a chi non sa\n\nche vento profondo m’ha cercato.\n\n(Serene Tindari come back,\n\na sweet friend wakes me up\n\nso that I can bend over from a rock in the sky\n\nand I pretend fear to whoever ignores\n\nwhat deep wind sought me out.)\n\nQuasimodo believed that Homer’s voice preceded Greece. It was Homer who had “formed” Greek civilization. This belief was held, before Quasimodo, by Gian Vincenzo Gravina and Vico. This is one reason why in a sense the experience of World War II found Quasimodo ready to address the “new” mission of poetry, that of rifare l’uomo (remaking of man).\n\nIn 1938 Quasimodo left his engineering job with the army because Arnoldo Mondadori hired him as drama editor for the weekly Tempo. Then, in 1941, he moved to Milan to become professor of Italian literature at Conservatory Giuseppe Verdi. In Milan he met several writers, artists, critics, musicians, and intellectuals, such as Arturo Martini, Giuseppe Cantatore, Aligi Sassu, Leonardo Sinisgalli, Luigi Rognoni, Arturo Tofanelli, Edoardo Persico, and Mario Novaro. In the afternoon they met at the Caffè Biffi; in the evening the animated conversations continued at the Caffe Savini. This was also the time of Quasimodo’s meeting Maria Cumani, a dancer who, after the death of Bice Donetti in 1946, became his second wife and mother of their only son, Alessandro. His relationship with Cumani has been preserved in the collection of love letters Quasimodo wrote to her between 1936 and 1959, the year of their legal separation: Lettere d’amore a Maria Cumani (1973).\n\nThe war brought about a profound change of style and motives, alluded to in various collections of Quasimodo’s poetry and essays, such as Giorno dopo giorno, La vita non è sogno (1949, Life is Not a Dream), Il falso e vero verde (1954, The False and True Green) and La terra impareggiabile (1958, The Incomparable Earth). On the war Quasimodo wrote in “Discorso sulla poesia” (published with Il falso e vero verde in 1956) that “la guerra muta la vita morale d’un popolo” (war changes the moral life of a nation). He felt that hermeticism was finished by 1945 and defined this movement as “l’estremo antro fiorentino di fonemi metrici” (the extreme Florentine pastoral cave of metrical phonemes). If one follows Quasimodo’s own account of the changes in his poetry brought about by the war, one realizes that he saw correspondence between the events leading up to the war and the end of hermeticism: “La guerra ha sorpreso un linguaggio poetico che maturava una partecipazione con gli oggetti della terra per raggiun-gere l’universale. Le allegorie si erano dissolte nella solitu-dine della ditta tura.” (War had surprised poetic language [and] that matured a participation with the objects of the earth in order to reach universality. The allegories had vanished in the solitude of the dictatorship).\n\nIt is possible that Quasimodo wanted to see it that way, because it provided him with a new ideological identity, since his contribution to the anti-Fascist movement was much less decisive than that of other Italian writers and intellectuals of his own generation, such as Giacomo Matteotti, Ignazio Silone, and Benedetto Croce. The truth was probably much more complex than that. Once Italy lost the world war and the country plunged into a state of virtual civil war, with the North controlled by the Germans and the South by the Allied forces, all the sympathies of the Italian people went out to those who had resisted fascism even at the height of its power. In the postwar era hardly anyone in Italy argued the right of the Communists to be the moral voice of the nation. One of the most fascinating chapters in Italian history ensued. Anxious to regain respectability, the northern capitalistic bourgeoisie, which had profited and prospered during the Fascist regime but had also supported the war effort, began to support the leftist intelligentsia, knowing how literary prizes, academic posts, and prestigious positions would be coveted by the intellectuals, writers, artists, musicians, and poets who would become aware that an ideological realignment was necessary for most of them, who had lacked the courage and the vision of Matteotti, Silone, or Croce. Communist propaganda made the most of this change, encouraging it and supporting it with a visible campaign in its publications and its cultural policies, especially within the influential movie industry, which was soon totally dominated by the Left. The postwar years were decisive in the restructuring and reorganization of the cultural institutions and academies of Italy, including the universities. Totally subservient to the regime prior to the war, afterward they became the battlefield for what was known in later years as the lottizzazione, the parceling of exclusive influence to a given party, with the three leading parties (Christian Democrat, Communist, and Socialist) receiving the lion’s share. Clearly, in such an environment no artist would ever succeed if left to his own devices. Without the support of an influential leftist group, no verses would be effective. Thus Quasimodo’s repeated forays as a speaker and a writer made him appear more “engaged” than he really was. Ultimately, Marxist critics claimed Quasimodo as one of their own, while justifying the moral committment already implied in the considerations of the Swedish Academy when it decided to award him the Nobel Prize in 1959.\n\nQuasimodo’s humanism is none other than a label conceived for the broader consumption of a society romantically in love with the Left but solidly anchored to material possessions, aware of its sins and willing to reward the severe poet who, from the height of his underdeveloped, and therefore innocent, island, can freely dispense his musical warnings of doom. The compositions of Giorno dopo giorno represent this new humanism, understood as the interpretation of a nation, its moral voice. A case in point is the opening poem of the book, “Alle fronde dei salici” (On the Willow Boughs):\n\nE come potevamo noi cantare\n\ncon il piede straniero sopra il cuore,\n\nfra i morti abbandonati nelle piazze\n\nsull’erba dura di ghiaccio, al lamento\n\nd’agnello dei fanciulli, all’urlo nero\n\ndella madre che andava incontro al figlio\n\ncrocifisso sul palo del telegrafo?\n\nAlle fronde dei salici, per voto,\n\nanche le nostre cetre erano appese,\n\noscillavano lievi al triste vento.\n\n(And how could we sing\n\nwith the foreigner’s foot upon our hearts,\n\namong the dead abandoned in the squares\n\non the frozen grass, amid the lamb-like\n\nbleating of the children, amid the black howling\n\nof the mother rushing up to her son\n\ncrucified on the telegraph pole?\n\nAs an offering, on the willow boughs\n\nour lyres, too, were hung,\n\nquivering slightly in the sad wind.)\n\nThere is a sophisticated double level of connotations, both pointing out the renunciation of hermeticism. The first level is a denunciation of the brutality of war in general, and, in particular, the civil war that devastated northern Italy after the armistice of 8 September 1943 between Italy and the Allied nations. The poet also is an anguished witness of the carnage and destruction of war, and his usual style is no longer justified; his hermeticism, like the lyre offered by the poet to assuage the sorrow of his countrymen, is buffeted by the sad winds of war. To this first connotative level, one can add a second, which becomes the melodic structure of the new style, hinged on the hendecasyllabic tonality of the whole poem, which is at the same time a classical retreat and a reassuring foray into the consoling harmony of the highest tradition of solemn Italian poetry, demanding a role in the somber, almost funereal landscape of the apocalyptic vision of Quasimodo:\n\nGiorno dopo giorno: parole maledette e il sangue\n\ne l’oro. Vi riconosco, miei simili, o mostri\n\ndella terra. Al vostro morso è caduta la pietà,\n\ne la croce gentile ci ha lasciati.\n\nE più non posso tornare nel mio eliso.\n\n(Day after day: unbearable words and the blood\n\nand the gold. I acknowledge our common origin, monsters\n\nof the earth. Piety has died torn to pieces by you,\n\nand the gentle cross has abandoned us.\n\nNor can I ever go back to my Elysium.)\n\nThe success of Giorno dopo giorno depends on Quasimodo’s ability to strike just the right note between admonition and regret, in order to capture the sympathy of the reader. The biblical tone confers on the poems the extra ethical authority required, after the empty rhetoric of fascism, to spread a message of solidarity equally pleasing to the Left and to progressive Catholics. In fact, the essential style of the book was something of a novelty, although illustrious models could be found, especially in Dante, Girolamo Savonarola, and Leopardi. It was Quasimodo’s ability to revive the best tradition of Italian poetry and combine it with the ever-present classical allusions in dealing with the topic of the war that made the book an instant success, in Italy and abroad. None of the subsequent books would achieve the same popularity.\n\nLa vita non è sogno represents a reconciliation between his Sicilian roots and the adopted Lombard environment, as in “Lamento per il Sud” (Lament for the South):\n\nLa luna rossa, il vento, il tuo colore\n\ndi donna del Nord, la distesa di neve …\n\nIl mio cuore e ormai su queste praterie,\n\nin queste acque annuvolate dalle nebbie.\n\nHo dimenticato il mare, la grave\n\nconchiglia soffiata dai pastori siciliani,\n\nle cantilene dei carri lungo le strade\n\ndove il carrubo trema nel fumo delle stoppie,\n\nho dimenticato il passo degli aironi e delle gru\n\nnell’aria dei verdi altipiani\n\nper le terre e i fiumi della Lombardia.\n\nMa l’uomo grida dovunque la sorte d’una patria.\n\nPiù nessuno mi porterà nel Sud.\n\n(The red moon, the wind, your coloring\n\nof woman of the North, the wilderness of snow &\n\nMy heart is now in these plains,\n\nin these waters clouded by mists.\n\nI have forgotten the sea, the heavy\n\nshell blown by Sicilian shepherds,\n\nthe singsong of the carts along the roads\n\nwhere the carob tree quivers in the smoke of the stubble,\n\nI have forgotten the flight of the herons and the storks\n\nin the air of the green plateaus\n\nfor the lands and rivers of Lombardy.\n\nBut man cries everywhere for his country’s destiny.\n\nNo one will ever take me South again.)\n\nThe solemn enumeration recalls the nostalgic verses of Acque e terre, but there is an almost narrative tonality, which allows for a resigned solution to the conflict that dominated his early poetry. The aftermath of the war still demands the poet’s attention. He still has a message of redemption, and his priest is Orpheus, the new archetype, capable of shaking man from the depths of his moral depression:\n\nE tu sporco di guerra, Orfeo\n\ncome il tuo cavallo, senza la sferza,\n\nalza il capo, non trema più la terra;\n\nurla d’amore, vinci, se vuoi, il mondo.\n\n(And you, Orpheus, filthy with war,\n\nlike your horse, without the whip,\n\nraise your head, the earth no longer shakes;\n\nshout your love, if you want, you can conquer the world.)\n\nAt this point Quasimodo, having lost the initial enthusiasm of Giorno dopo giorno, relapses into conventional phraseology and poetic schemes, so that one can perceive an alternating mood, from an outright propagandistic effort to a pristine neohermeticism, as represented in two different compositions, “II mio paese e l’ltalia” (My Country is Italy) and “Quasi un madrigale” (Almost a Madrigal):\n\nLà Buchenwald, la mite selva di faggi,\n\ni suoi forni maledetti; là Stalingrado\n\ne Minsk sugli acquitrini e la neve putrefatta.\n\n(There Buchenwald, the gentle wood of beeches,\n\nits cursed ovens; there Stalingrad\n\nand Minsk on the swamps and the putrified snow.)\n\nIn contrast with this superficial demagoguery, there is the example of neohermeticism:\n\nII girasole piega a occidente\n\ne già precipita il giorno nel suo\n\nocchio in rovina e l’aria dell’estate\n\ns’addensa e già curva le foglie e il fumo\n\ndei cantieri. S’allontana con scorrere\n\nsecco di nubi e stridere di fulmini\n\nquest’ultimo gioco del cielo.\n\n(The sunflower turns to the west\n\nwhile the day already plunges into his\n\ndecaying eye and the summer wind\n\nbuilds up and already is bending the leaves and the smoke\n\nof the builder’s yard. It vanishes with a dry\n\nrushing of clouds and bursting of thunders\n\nthis last play of the sky.)\n\nThe last books show a poet in search of his social Utopia. Alienation and the nuclear threat are dominant themes in his last poems, such as “In questa citta” (In This City) and “Ancora dall’inferno” (Still from Hell):\n\nIn questa città c’è pure la macchina\n\nche stritola i sogni: con un gettone\n\nvivo, un piccolo disco di dolore\n\nsei subito di là, su questa terra,\n\nignoto in mezzo ad ombre deliranti\n\nsu alghe di fosforo funghi di fumo;\n\nuna giostra di mostri\n\nche gira su conchiglie\n\nche si spezzano putride sonando.\n\n(In this city there is even the machine\n\nthat grinds the dreams: with a token,\n\na quick, a small disk of sorrow\n\nyou are there in no time, on this earth,\n\nunknown amid delirious shadows\n\nupon phosphorous seaweeds and mushrooms of smoke:\n\na merry-go-round of monsters\n\nturning around shells\n\nwhich crack putrefied with a sound.)\n\nThe city is like a Dantesque hell, an alienating environment for everyone who happens to be trapped inside:\n\nNon ci direte una notte gridando\n\ndai megafoni, una notte\n\ndi zagare, di nascite, d’amori\n\nappena cominciati, che l’idrogeno\n\nin nome del diritto brucia\n\nla terra. Gli animali i boschi fondono\n\nnell’Arca della distruzione, il fuoco\n\nè un vischio sui crani dei cavalli,\n\nnegli occhi umani. Poi a noi morti\n\nvoi morti direte nuove tavole\n\ndella legge. Nell’antico linguaggio\n\naltri segni, profili di pugnali.\n\nBalbetterà qualcuno sulle scorie,\n\ninventerà tutto ancora\n\no nulla nella sorte uniforme,\n\nil mormorio delle correnti, il crepitare\n\ndella luce. Non la speranza\n\ndirete voi morti alia nostra morte\n\nnegli imbuti di fanghiglia bollente,\n\nqui nell’inferno. (From “Ancora dall’inferno”)\n\n(You will not announce screaming one night\n\nthrough the bullhorns, one night\n\nof orange-blossoms, of births, of loves\n\njust begun, that the hydrogen\n\nin the name of the law scorches\n\nthe earth. The animals and the woods melt\n\nin the ark of destruction, the fire\n\nis a snare on the horses’ skulls,\n\nin human eyes. Then to us dead\n\nyou dead will tell us new codes\n\nof the law. In the ancient language\n\nnew signs, outlines of daggers.\n\nSomeone will babble on the remains,\n\nwill again invent everything\n\nor nothing in the identical destiny,\n\nthe whispering of streams, the crackling\n\nof the light. Of hope\n\nyou dead will not speak to our death\n\nin the funnels of boiling mud,\n\nhere in hell.)\n\nThis poem expresses mankind’s longing for peace, the horror of the impending nuclear holocaust forever looming on the horizon since the time of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the obscure forces of history incessantly at work, with the poet imagining a distant day when civilization will start again from scratch in order to repeat the same mistakes. This is a pessimistic viewpoint, one which contrasts with the more civic call to moral regeneration and social commitment of compositions such as “Varvàra Alexandrovna” and “Solo che amore ti colpisca” (Only if Love Should Pierce You), collected in Dare e avere (1966; translated as To Give and to Have, 1969). In the first poem, composed during an illness in the Soviet Union in memory of a nurse who took care of him, Quasimodo identifies in her and her solidarity a new spirit of mankind:\n\nsei la Russia, non un paesaggio di neve\n\nriflesso in uno specchio d’ospedale\n\nsei una moltitudine di mani che cercano altre mani.\n\n(you are Russia, not a snowy landscape\n\nreflected in a hospital mirror\n\nyou are a crowd of hands searching for other hands.)\n\nIn the second poem the poet identifies love as the new religion, capable of tying every person to the essence of humankind: “ricorda che puoi essere l’essere dell’essere // solo che amore ti colpisca bene alle vis-cere” (remember that you can be the being of the being // if only love should pierce you deep inside).\n\nIn one of the last compositions of La terra impareggiabile, “Una risposta” (An Answer), Quasimodo flashes the magic name of Ulysses. Ulysses appears amid the mystical desire of the poet to reach out to God:\n\nSe arde alia mente l’ancora d’Ulisse…\n\nSe in riva al mare di Aci, qui fra barche\n\ncon l’occhio nero a prua contro la mala\n\nsorte, io potessi dal nulla dell’aria\n\nqui dal nulla che stride di colpo e uncina\n\ncome la fiocina del pesce-spada,\n\ndal nulla delle mani che si mutano\n\ncome Aci, viva formare dal nulla\n\nuna formica e spingerla nel cono\n\ndi sabbia del suo labirinto o un virus\n\nche dia continua giovinezza al mio\n\npiù fedele nemico,\n\nforse allora sarei simile a Dio–\n\nnell’uguale fermezza della vita\n\ne della morte non contrarie:\n\nonda qui e lava, larve\n\ndella luce di questa già futura\n\nchiara mattina d’inverno–risposta\n\na una domanda di natura e angoscia\n\nche folgora su un numero miliare,\n\nil primo della strada torrida\n\nche s’incunea nell’al di là.\n\n(If Ulysses’ anchor is fire to the mind …\n\nIf by Aci’s sea, here amid boats\n\nwith the black eye at the bow against bad\n\nluck, I could from the empty air\n\nhere from nothing suddenly screaming and hooking\n\nlike the harpoon of the sword-fish,\n\nfrom nothing of hands changing\n\nlike Aci, make alive from nothing\n\nan ant and push it on the cone\n\nof sand of its labyrinth or a virus\n\nthat brings unending youth to my\n\nmost dedicated enemy,\n\nperhaps then I would be like God–\n\nin the firm sameness of life\n\nand death not opposing each other:\n\nwave here and lava, larvae\n\nof the light of this already future\n\nclear winter morning–answer\n\nto a question of nature and anguish\n\nwhich bolts a milestone,\n\nthe first on the torrid road\n\nwhich penetrates in the world beyond.)\n\nAlways the poet-translator, Quasimodo succeeded in blending all the most diverse materials of his poetic style. The neohermetic technique is alive in this poem, except for a religious tonality, and the classical hero is placed at the beginning with the verb arde signifying a Dantean allusion to the fire that surrounds Ulysses in Canto XXVI of the Inferno. We have here the three lyrical ingredients of Quasimodo’s poetry: hermeticism, classicism, and biblical mysticism. Furthermore, the hendecasyllabic structure that predominates throughout this composition reinforces the traditional technique of the allusion, which finds a corresponding “allegoric” mode with an authority such as Dante, giving to the word àncora of the first verse a referential meaning, confirmed by arde and the fact that Quasimodo’s text is itself “anchored” on firm hermetic tradition.\n\nAfter being awarded the Nobel Prize, Quasimodo achieved international recognition and received several invitations to speak and to read his works. In 1961 he traveled to Germany, Hungary, Romania, Spain, Mexico, Norway, and Bulgaria. In Spain he was met with great enthusiasm, especially in Barcelona, by leading Catalan writers such as José María Castellet, Carlos Barral, and Juan Goytisolo. In January 1963 at the Freie Universitat in West Berlin, Quasimodo gave two lectures: one on the Italian theater and another on contemporary Italian poetry. This was his second visit to West Berlin. In 1960 at the Kongress Halle he had given a reading of his verses. In the spring of 1963 he was invited by the Istituto Italiano di Cultura to London and Dublin. In London he visited Chiswick to pay homage to Ugo Foscolo’s memorial in the church cemetery at Turnham Green. He also was invited to go to Oxford and Cambridge for a lecture at the University Arms Hotel. In the summer of 1963 he returned to Norway. Then in November of the same year he went on an extensive tour of Yugoslavia. In January 1964 he went to Paris, accompanied by his secretary, Annamaria Angioletti–who later published a somewhat sensational account of her personal relationship with the poet, E fu subito sera (1969)–and Pericle Patocchi, a Swiss writer and Quasimodo’s French translator. The Nobel Prize winner was introduced to the Parisian intellectual elite at the prestigious Istituto Italiano di Cultura by Andre Chamson of the French Academy. This period of travel, according to Angioletti, coincided with Quasimodo’s deepest distrust of the media.\n\nLouis Aragon once attributed the resentment of the French media, especially the Parisian press, when the Nobel Prize was awarded to Quasimodo, to ignorance (“Hommage à S. Qj,” Lettres Françaises, 5-11 November 1959). In Italy, objections were due more to political reasons than to literary rivalries. Although his critics appeared to regret his departure from hermeticism, in fact they opposed his political choices. Nevertheless, in the years following the Nobel Prize his name became familiar to millions of Italians. However, following a period of great popularity, which steadily increased abroad, Quasimodo’s fame in Italy seemed to diminish. The poet believed, perhaps with some reason, that the old political opposition had succeeded, at least temporarily, in banning his name from the Italian media.\n\nIn June 1965 Quasimodo was invited to read at the Spoleto “Festival dei Due Mondi.” In January 1966 he was in Grenoble, France, to do another reading of his verses. He took an extended tour of Switzerland in January 1969. In June of the same year he took his last trip outside Italy, when he was invited by Oxford University to receive an honorary doctorate. In February 1968 he was invited to a ceremony at the Capitolium in Rome for the celebration of Ungaretti’s eightieth birthday. During the banquet Ungaretti exclaimed to Quasimodo, in the presence of leading Italian writers and artists, such as Eugenio Montale, Alberto Moravia, Giacomo Manzù, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Libero Bigiaretti, Alfonso Gatto, Libero De Libero, and Piero Piccioni: “Manigoldo, lo sai che ti voglio bene” (Scoundrel, you know I like you). On 14June 1968, while presiding over the jury for a poetry prize in Amalfi, Quasimodo was taken ill with a brain hemorrhage and died shortly afterward.\n\nIt would be difficult to compare Salvatore Quasimodo with any other Italian poet, except the last three great nineteenth-century poets, Giosué Carducci, Giovanni Pascoli, and Gabriele D’Annun-zio. Probably no other Italian poet in the first decades of the twentieth century exercised such a deep and lasting influence as Quasimodo has. However, his lyrical contribution after the war seems to pale when compared to his success as a prewar hermetic poet and translator. After the war his political stance was a detriment to his artistic achievement whenever he committed himself too strongly to prevailing fashions and descended to a documentary kind of poetry. Overall, his name and poetry are to be considered at the very center of the latest developments of Italian poetry, making him the decisive experience for the newest generations of Italian poets.\n\nLetters\n\nLe lettere d’amore, edited by Guido Le Noci (Milan: Apol linaire, 1969);\n\nLettere d’amore a Maria Cumani (1936-1959), edited by David Lajolo (Milan: Mondadori, 1973);\n\nSalvatore Quasimodo–G.
