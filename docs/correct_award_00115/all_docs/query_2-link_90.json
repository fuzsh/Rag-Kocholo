        "text": "August 15, 2021\n\nMy heart inclines to you in solitude,\n\nthe exile of obscure senses\n\nin which what formerly appeared\n\nour own transmutes and loves,\n\nand now is buried in the night.\n\nArcs of air are shining\n\non your face; you appear now, just\n\nat the time when first dismay afflicts,\n\nyou make me blanch; the mouth is slow\n\nbefore the light of mirth.\n\nTo have you I am losing you,\n\nand I do not suffer: still you are fair,\n\nunshaken in the gentle pose of sleep:\n\nserenity of death, ultimate joy.\n\nJuly 30, 2019\n\nI don't speak Italian, but enjoy \"reading\" it with an English translation side-by-side, and Quasimodo is special, having visited Modica and Ragusa. \"Reading\" Farnsworth's translation went slowly and not altogether enjoyably. Except for some later pieces the lines were flat and made the poet seem BORING. Pulled out Bevan's translations and found immediate differences and improvements, i.e. sharper images, more idiomatic expression, philosophical depth and emotion. But then again, I am far from an expert."
