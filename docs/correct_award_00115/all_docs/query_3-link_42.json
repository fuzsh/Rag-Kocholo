        "text": "(Milan: Edizioni Apollinaire, 1969).\n\nFIRST EDITION. BEAUTIFULLY PRINTED IN MILAN, ITALY. With 75 photographs and reproductions of 40 love letters written to the dancer Maria Cumani in the 1930's.\n\n'Traditional literary critique divides Quasimodo's work into two major periods: the hermetic period until World War II and the post-hermetic era until his death. Although these periods are distinct, they are to be seen as a single poetical quest. This quest or exploration for a unique language took him through various stages and various modalities of expression.\n\nAs an intelligent and clever poet, Quasimodo used a hermetical, \"closed\" language to sketch recurring motifs like Sicily, religion and death. Subsequently, the translation of authors from Roman and Greek Antiquity enabled him to extend his linguistic toolkit. The disgust and sense of absurdity of World War II also had its impact on the poet's language. This bitterness, however, faded in his late writings, and was replaced by the mature voice of an old poet reflecting upon his world.\n\nIn the 1950s Quasimodo won the following awards: Premio San Babila (1950), Premio Etna-Taormina (1953), Premio Viareggio (1958) and, finally, the Nobel Prize for Literature (1959). In 1960 and 1967 he received honoris causa degrees from the Universities of Messina and Oxford, respectively.\n\nIn his last years the poet made numerous voyages to Europe and America, giving public speeches and public lectures of his poems, which had been translated in several foreign languages. Item #27872\n\nFirst Edition, one of 1000 copies only. Profusely illustrated, with letters in reproduction by this Nobel Prize winner. 75 photographs and 40 love letters written to the dancer Maria Cumani. Folio, publisher's original stiff printed wrappers, lettered in black on the upper cover and spine, and housed in the original slipcase. [228] pp. A fine copy in the original slipcase, a bit of light wear."
