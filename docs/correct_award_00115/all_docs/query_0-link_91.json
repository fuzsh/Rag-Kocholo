This quote emphasizes that behind every accomplished artist lies a humble beginning. No artist simply materializes with expertise and mastery in their chosen field. Instead, they embark on a journey of exploration, learning, and growth, marked by a progression from a novice to a professional. It is through the pursuit of their craft, experimentation, and perseverance that artists evolve and refine their skills, ultimately attaining the status they now command. Quasimodo's words remind us that no matter where we currently stand on our creative journey, being an amateur should not deter us. Instead, it should inspire us to continue developing our talents, as it is through dedication and continuous effort that true artistic brilliance is born.",
