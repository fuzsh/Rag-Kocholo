        "text": "“We live as long as anybody remembers us“\n\nDante Alighieri, 1265 – 1321\n\nWhat is heaven.world\n\nheaven.world is a virtual platform to set up memorials and to design individual memorial pages and gravesites for deceased people as well as for deceased animals. It offers the creation of a lasting memorial site and place of remembrance for family, friends, acquaintances, the general public as well as for owners of animals.\n\nWhy heaven.world\n\nThe loss of someone close or a beloved animal by death always results in pain and grief.\n\nPeople visit symbolic places to come to terms with grief and loss. Rituals such as visiting the graveyard support people and help them to cope better with pain and grief.\n\nHowever, it is not always possible to keep up these habits. Regular visits to the grave may be impeded or made entirely impossible by long distances or ailments.\n\nheaven.world offers a corresponding alternative by providing the possibility to set up a virtual memorial which can be designed personally and individually. This memorial can be accessed at any time and can be adapted and modified to the corresponding circumstances and requirements.\n\nWhat does heaven.world have to offer\n\nA virtual memorial for deceased people can be set up by a straightforward registration process on heaven.world. It is possible to create either a memorial page open to the public or a private one protected by password.\n\nThe platform offers the possibility to either mark the actual location of a deceased person or animal on a map of the world or to pick a fictional place. Memorial sites, memorial pages as well as graves can be designed in accordance with creeds, religious confessions and personal ideas.\n\nheaven.world does not differentiate between race, citizenship, origin and social status.\n\nThe user of heaven.world acknowledges that the information published on this website is only valid under Swiss Jurisdiction.
