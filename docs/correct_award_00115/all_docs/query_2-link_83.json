        "text": "What is your background with biology and/or literature? Did you always have an affinity for both, or was becoming a writer and working in the literary space always the ultimate goal?\n\nI began writing poetry in middle school, and by that time I had long since immersed myself into the world of biology. Among my first experiences was realizing that knowledge connected to the life sciences added something entirely different to the interpretation and enjoyment of a text than did knowledge of the humanities. As a high school student in Debrecen, it was through Péter Melius Juhász, Mihály Csokonai Vitéz, Fazekas, Diószegi, and others that I realized (with help from teachers, naturally) that there was a time period of Hungarian literature, European literature even, when it was self-evident to observe the world through the eyes of a universe filled with life. I endeavored to make use of my biological knowledge from the beginning (the Vadnarancsok [Wild Oranges] volumes are a testament to this zeal), and then it just became my nature, became the norm.\n\nHaving a foot in both the sciences and the arts doesn’t fit the typical narrative of being more inclined to one or the other. Did this factor into your education or professional life at all? Did writers scoff at your more technical background, or did the scientific community roll their eyes when you said you wanted to write?\n\nIt is customary to judge scientific activity by publication and citation data, and literary activity by readers. We assume the result of a reader’s work will differ when they peruse a journal article or a poem; each reader’s knowledge, the nature of their field, and their interpretational framework is also different. This is true in my case too: I mainly studied the cultural history of the rose, the range of symbolism associated with it throughout different cultural periods of Europe (with detours into the Arab-Turkish world as well). That is, I gave ample reason for literary types to use monographic works on rhodology.\n\nI garnered the horror of the literary world first, and I was not characterized by the word “biologist,” but branded with it. In the early days of my career this vexed and upset me, but I now know this was a sign of my own uncertainty, that perhaps I myself found their suppositions credible: the appearances of knowledge are rhetorical. In scientific life, despite the fact that many of my colleagues secretly flirt with high literature, they tend to not take seriously my kind of, as they say, scribbling. It is often the case that those who have achieved outstanding success in some specialty or other are brave enough to form an opinion in any other field as well. After the several volumes of Wild Oranges became disreputable, when they were transferred from the literary scene into cultural politics, not one colleague equivocated or used it against me. Of course, there are those for whom either my literary work or my cultural historical work is unknown.\n\nIn one of our previous interviews, Eszter T. Molnár talked about how for much of history, study of both the humanities and the natural sciences was required for an educated, creative mind. In the nearly 30 years you’ve been working in education and academia, have you seen any shift in students’ receptiveness to diverse disciplines outside of their main degree? Is education (specifically in the sciences) becoming too specialized nowadays, or is there still a place for a more wide-ranging, Renaissance-style education?\n\nAt one time, it was not left to high school alone to provide a general education. In university education, it was the norm to offer broader learning around one’s specialization – not so any more. There are literary programs where they don’t teach the antiquities or the history of thinking, or life science programs, even with a biological emphasis, where there’s no discussion of taxonomy or biophysics. In the era of specialization, modern society abandons any introduction to frontier areas and related fields of study, to the results from other branches of science and art and the methods that led to those results, to the processes and characteristics of thinking; ultimately, the transmission of knowledge is the purview of a precious few. There are educational systems which are goal-oriented, which do not view mere comfort-enhancing knowledge and learning as a useful value, and which do not hoist the need for self-education up among the goals of society. Obviously very few people see the whole of culture, but it is not worth giving up comprehensive education in the interest of any sort of hinted at image of education or people. Ultimately, it is about our need for a more complete, understandable life than the one we have now. In other words, our need for social experiences. In any case, it is my experience that, if not in the world of university students and educators and researchers, those living in the world of the natural and cognitive sciences have a higher proficiency in the arts or social sciences than the other way around.\n\nIn what way does biology play a role in the content or style of your writing? Does it work its way into plot points or overarching themes, or influence the structure of your writing in a meaningful way? Or is it more of a bonus add-on – interesting and unique if it happens to show up in a text, but not necessarily crucial to the story?\n\nMy writing, when arranged into volumes – regardless of whether it’s poetry or short prose – is often seen as fragmented, rich with hiatus and embellishment, full of clues and traps, and not least of all diary-like, in that it is read as if it were minimalist text. Perhaps this too leads to a coherent interpretation of the works; after all, the good reader loves to investigate. But it was from biology, and from the most important part of biology, that which deals with the process of evolution, that I learned how great the distinction is between history and a series of events. And what kind of attention, let’s call it fate, is needed for something to become history, beyond just a fixed start point and end result. That is, it is necessary to point out the pattern of random occurrences, phenomena, and events, it is through the organization of the volume that the algorithm providing meaning must also be represented. That is to say, though I did have stories related to biology twenty or thirty years ago, I no longer do (if we ignore the fact that I am, of course, a part of the living world), but the creation and organization of a text is modeled after the living world. I cannot see human culture as separate from the animate and inanimate world, nor the minute microcosm as separate from the macrocosm.\n\nYou have significant experience not just with biology and literature, but also anthropology. Where do you see anthropology on the science-humanities spectrum? To the lay person it may seem to straddle the line between the two; is there any truth to that? Has your experience in this field had any impact on your writing?\n\nBiological anthropology and cultural anthropology are today hopelessly separated, although if we look at transdisciplinarity, if we consider human ecology and emphasize the social scientific aspects in it, we can light upon a series of revolutionary innovations. Man who appeared in the Holocene has reached a point in the Anthropocene (as they love to say these days) where he can clearly see the extent to which he has human characteristics. The interest in anthropological questions moved Olga Tokarczuk and the better part of contemporary prose writers in an ecology direction, the burgeoning of the biopoetic movement questions authorship, the loss of anthropocentricity brings up the reinterpretation of aesthetics – these problems need to be showing up in work, and not only in my own, but in that of others too.\n\nAre there other writers out there who have a background in the sciences you think the literary community should know about, or any scientists/writers who were particularly influential for you?\n\nThere are many variants that exist between the poles of scientific writer and literary scientist, from Umberto Eco to Marguerite Yourcenar to our own Vilmos Csányi. And then there are those writers with scientific knowledge, who could fail to mention Andrea Tompa or Otto Tolnai among them? And there are the young colleagues who are choosing doctoral programs for self-education, surely some scientists will be born from among them. As to which writers of this disposition had a big impact on me: first and foremost Jorge Luis Borges, well-versed in Arab natural philosophy and also a literary historian. And of course Goethe.\n\nIs there a story involving biology you’re just dying to write, or some aspect of biology you want to work into a future story? Something that hasn’t quite taken shape yet, but that you’d love to make happen?\n\nAll forms of de- and rehumanization drive me to despair, which is exactly why they excite me. It would be nice if there was time and opportunity to create such complex works in which everything one is engaged with could appear together. As this would lead to a cultural theory founded on biology and with an evolutionary bent, I am not the right person to put it together, but I hope that I can provide data in service to such a project.\n\nIf you could sit down for a coffee and chat with any scientist and any writer, living or dead, who would they be and whose autograph would you ask for first?\n\nThere’s no need to respond in the conditional. In my circle of acquaintances and my everyday life, I nurture a variety of relationships with many scientists, and with only slightly fewer writers and artists. Even if I’m not asking for their autographs, I am getting their latest works with a dedication.\n\nI would surely remain silent before the dead, and I don’t think they would strike up conversation with a man struck dumb."
