        "text": "Editorial Review\n\nProduct Description\n\nSalvatore Quasimodo (1901-1968) was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1959 for `his lyrical poetry which with classical fire expresses the tragic experience of life in our time'. Jack Bevan's remarkable translation of Quasimodo's entire poetic oeuvre fills a great gap in our knowledge of twentieth-century European poetry. `The poetry is textured like shot silk, yet the elegance and syntactical lucidity with which Jack Bevan has worked to bring these poems to English readers enables them to stand as poems in their own right', as Peter Scupham wrote of Jack Bevan's translation of Quasimodo's last poems, `Debit and Credit'.\n\nQuasimodo's strong and passionate poetry continues to testify to the human (and inhuman) realities which have created our modern world: as the Italian critic Giuliano Dego wrote, `To bear witness to man's history in all the urgency of a particular time and place, and to teach the lesson of courage, this has been Quasimodo's poetic task.' ...

These poems show Quasimodo at his best as he explores the complex emotions associated with memories of particular events and places, in lyric verse of grave and passionate eloquence. None of the poems have previously appeared in book form in England. ...

Excerpt:Alessandro Baricco (born January 25, 1958 in Turin , Piedmont ) is a popular Italian writer, director and performer. His novels have been translated into a wide number of languages. He currently lives in Rome with his wife and two sons. Life and works After receiving degrees in philosophy (under Gianni Vattimo ) and piano , he published essays on music criticism : Il genio in fuga (1988) on Gioachino Rossini , and L'anima di Hegel e le mucche del Wisconsin (\"Hegel 's Soul and the Cows of Wisconsin \", 1992) on the relation between music and modernity .

Baricco debuted as a novelist with Castelli di rabbia (translated as Lands of Glass ) in 1991. In 1993 he co-founded a creative writing school in Turin , naming it Scuola Holden after J. D.
