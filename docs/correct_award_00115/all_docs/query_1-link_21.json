        "text": "(1901–68). The 20th-century Italian poet, critic, and translator Salvatore Quasimodo was one of the leaders of the Hermetics—poets whose works were characterized by unorthodox structure, illogical sequences, and highly subjective language. Later in his career he became a powerful voice for political and social reform. He received the Nobel prize for literature in 1959.\n\nQuasimodo was born on Aug. 20, 1901, in Modica, Italy. He was first educated near Syracuse and at Messina, studied engineering and mathematics at Palermo, and then left for the north, graduating as an engineer in Rome. He had liked to write even as a child, and, though he spent the next ten years as an engineer for the Italian government, he wrote poetry in his spare time.\n\nQuasimodo’s first poems appeared in the Florentine periodical Solaria. A follower of the Hermetic poets Giuseppe Ungaretti and Eugenio Montale, Quasimodo gradually became a leader of the movement after the publication of his first poetry collection, Acque e terre (1930; Waters and Land). After 1935 he abandoned engineering to teach Italian literature at a conservatory in Milan. Quasimodo’s later poetry collections—Oboe sommerso (1932; Sunken Oboe), Odore di eucalyptus (1933; Scent of Eucalyptus), and Erato e Apollion (1936)—have the dry, sophisticated style and obscure symbolism of Hermeticism but include many poems that deal with contemporary issues. Poesie (1938) and Ed è subito sera (1942; And Suddenly It’s Evening) were the last volumes of his Hermetic period.\n\nAfter World War II Quasimodo’s social convictions shaped his work, beginning with Giorno dopo giorno (1947; Day After Day). Many of his poems recall the injustices of the Fascist regime, the horrors of the war, and Italian guilt with concrete imagery and simple language. Later volumes include La terra impareggiabile (1958; The Incomparable Earth), Tutte le poesie (1960), and Dare e avere (1966; To Give and To Have and Other Poems).\n\nQuasimodo published an astonishing range of translations, including classical poetry and drama, six plays of William Shakespeare, Molière’s Tartuffe, and the poetry of E.E. Cummings and Pablo Neruda. He edited two anthologies of Italian poetry and wrote many significant critical essays, collected in Il poeta e il politico e altri saggi (1960; The Poet and the Politician and Other Essays) and Scritti sul teatro (1961), a collection of drama reviews. Quasimodo died on June 14, 1968, in Naples, Italy."
