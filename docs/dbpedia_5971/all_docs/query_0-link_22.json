She was 62.\n\nBird had anaplastic thyroid cancer and died in her sleep, the BBC said.\n\nShe had had an operation to remove a large tumor in April, the statement said. Bird also helmed Mad Love (1995), a romantic drama starring Drew Barrymore and Chris O’Donnell; the crime drama Face (1997) starring Robert Carlyle; and Ravenous (1999), a tale about cannibalism with Carlyle and Guy Pearce.\n\nPHOTOS: Hollywood’s Notable Deaths of 2013\n\nWith Carlyle, journalist Mark Cousins and Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh, she set up the production company Four Way Pictures.\n\n“Such a sad day today. RIP Antonia Bird. Farewell my beautiful friend,” Carlyle wrote on Twitter.\n\nCarlyle also appeared in Priest (1994), which played the Toronto International Film Festival, starred Linus Roache and Tom Wilkinson and dealt with issues of celibacy and homosexuality.\n\nA native of London, Bird had been in preproduction on the feature drama Cross My Mind, a film about three lonely people. She recently helmed episodes of the drama The Village for the BBC."
