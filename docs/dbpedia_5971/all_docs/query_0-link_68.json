        "text": "Mad Love Drew Barrymore, Chris O'Donnell Directed by Antonia Bird PG-13 99 minutes\n\nCasey (Ms. Barrymore), the kind of girl who sets off false alarms at school, falls in love with Matt (Mr. O'Donnell), a more responsible type. When her parents object to the relationship, the two teen-agers run away together. They live an adolescent fantasy of freedom and independence until Casey starts acting weird. VIOLENCE Very little: one cigarette is poked in the face of a bad guy, and there's one brief fist fight. SEX Some, expressed as passionate kissing and ecstatic facial expressions. PROFANITY A smattering. FOOTNOTE Auto theft seems to be acceptable, and there doesn't seem to be much of a moral (unless it's \"Don't leave town without your medication\"). For Which Children? AGES 3 to 9 They'll be bored and possibly upset by some of Casey's behavior. AGES 10 and up The idea of playing grown-up is sure to be appealing, but because of the talk of suicide and the playfully reckless driving, the film should probably be reserved for the emotionally mature among this age group.
