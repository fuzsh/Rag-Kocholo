        "text": "Nixon\n\n\"This is a man of many masks. Who can say they have seen his\n\nreal face?\" -- Adlai Stevenson on Richard Nixon\n\n\"It's the lie that gets you.\" -- Richard Nixon\n\nOLIVER STONE directs Academy Award¨-winning actor ANTHONY HOPKINS in the title role of \"Nixon.\"\n\nAlthough he is one of the most chronicled public figures\n\nof the 20th century, Richard Milhous Nixon remains an enigma to\n\nmany, his decisions, motives and behavior often shrouded in\n\nmystery. \"Nixon\" is a dramatized attempt to understand the man\n\nbehind the tarnished presidential seal, who, to paraphrase his\n\nown words, scaled life's greatest heights and plunged into its\n\ndeepest valleys.\n\n\"Nixon,\" with visual and thematic boldness, tells the\n\nextraordinary personal story of America's controversial 37th\n\nPresident: a man whose lifelong quest for public acceptance\n\nthrough political power constantly eluded him ... even when he\n\nheld the highest office in the nation.\n\nWith the ill-fated 1972 Watergate break-in and its tragic\n\naftermath -- culminating with the President's 1974 resignation\n\n-- as its focus, \"Nixon\" examines its subject's complex life:\n\nhis difficult youth in Southern California as the son of a poor\n\ngrocer and a stern Quaker mother; the shattering loss of two\n\nyoung brothers to the ravages of tuberculosis; his tender but\n\noften troubled relationship with wife Pat, who despised having to\n\nshare her husband with the rest of the world.\n\nWe also see Nixon's incredible political life, during\n\nwhich he held the offices of Congressman at age 33, Senator at\n\n37, and Vice-President at 39, before losing the Presidential\n\nelection of 1960 and the California gubernatorial race in 1962,\n\nmaking his startling comeback six years later to win two terms as\n\nPresident.\n\nThe panorama of American life in this century is played\n\nout as a vast impressionistic backdrop to Nixon's emblematic life\n\nand career, allowing Stone the unique opportunity to re-examine\n\nevents seen in some of his previous films -- including \"Born on\n\nthe Fourth of July\" and \"JFK\" -- but from a completely different\n\nperspective.\n\nThe life of Richard Nixon unspools with the inevitability\n\nof classical tragedy, as his political career finally crumbles\n\nbeneath the weight of his past, his ambitions, and his blindness\n\nto events occurring just outside his often remarkable range of\n\nvision.\n\nPortraying Nixon's friends, family and enemies is a cast\n\nheaded by JOAN ALLEN as Pat Nixon, POWERS BOOTHE as Alexander\n\nHaig, ED HARRIS as Howard Hunt, EDWARD HERRMANN as Nelson\n\nRockefeller, BOB HOSKINS as J. Edgar Hoover, MADELINE KAHN as\n\nMartha Mitchell, E.G. MARSHALL as John Mitchell, DAVID PAYMER as\n\nRon Ziegler, DAVID HYDE PIERCE as John Dean, PAUL SORVINO as\n\nHenry Kissinger, MARY STEENBURGEN as Hannah Nixon, J.T. WALSH as\n\nJohn Ehrlichman and JAMES WOODS as H.R. Haldeman.\n\nJoining them is an ensemble corps that includes such noted\n\nactors as MASON ADAMS, ROBERT BELTRAN, TOM BOWER, COREY CARRIER,\n\nMICHAEL CHIKLIS, JULIE CONDRA, JOHN DIEHL, JOANNA GOING, DAVID\n\nBARRY GRAY, DAN HEDAYA, JOHN BEDFORD LLOYD, TONY LO BIANCO, JAMES\n\nPICKENS, TONY PLANA, GEORGE PLIMPTON, SAUL RUBINEK, BRIDGITTE\n\nWILSON, and MARLEY SHELTON.\n\nFrom Hollywood Pictures, \"Nixon\" is an Illusion\n\nEntertainment/Cinergi production produced by Clayton Townsend,\n\nOliver Stone and Andrew G. Vajna from a screenplay by Stephen J.\n\nRivele, Christopher Wilkinson & Oliver Stone. Script consultancy\n\nis by noted Los Angeles Times columnist Robert Scheer, writer\n\nChristopher Scheer, author/historian John Newman and former Nixon\n\nassociates Alexander Butterfield, John Dean and John Sears. The\n\nbehind-the-scenes creative team includes such past Stone\n\nassociates as Oscar-winning (\"JFK\") director of photography\n\nRobert Richardson, production designer Victor Kempster, costume\n\ndesigner Richard Hornung, editors Hank Corwin and Brian Berdan,\n\ntwo time Oscar-winning (\"The Right Stuff,\" \"Speed\") sound mixer\n\nDavid MacMillan and five-time Academy Award¨-winner composer John\n\nWilliams, who previously scored Stone's \"Born on the Fourth of\n\nJuly\" and \"JFK.\" The co-producers are Eric Hamburg and Dan\n\nHalsted, with Richard Rutowski as associate producer.\n\nABOUT \"NIXON\"\n\nThere is perhaps no character in American history who has\n\nmore loyal supporters and savage critics than Richard Nixon.\n\nVilified by many as a warmongering incarnation of everything\n\ndysfunctional and brutish about American democracy, he is\n\nalternately heralded and feted as a terribly misunderstood man of\n\ngreat wisdom, skill and courage who did much to bring peace to a\n\nwar-torn world. The truth, as usual, is much more complicated\n\nand subtle.\n\nRichard Nixon was, to many who knew and worked with him, a\n\nvery strange person. He was capable of quiet kindness, political\n\ncourage and devout loyalty to family and friends, but he was just\n\nas likely to be cowardly, quirkily amoral or suddenly,\n\nexplosively, unforgettably vicious. His aides tell of a\n\nsporadically brilliant man whose mind wandered about like a dog\n\ntracking many scents, gnawing at an idea only to drop it\n\nsuddenly, chase a rabbit, and then return to the original bone.\n\nFor want of better terms, Nixon had a dark side and a\n\nlight side that were diametrically opposed, and everyone who knew\n\nhim saw both at one time or another -- including the public. A\n\nstark ambition united this split personality, lifting him up from\n\npoverty and anonymity and wedging him firmly into the American\n\nconsciousness. Once launched, Nixon was like an out-of-control\n\ncomet, wheeling about, spitting rocks and sulfur, lighting an arc\n\nacross the night sky.\n\nWhether as the bloodhound on the trail of \"Communist\"\n\nAlger Hiss, pulling the heartstrings of America with his\n\nshameless \"Checkers\" speech, or making peace overnight with a\n\nbillion \"Red\" Chinese, Nixon loved to hit the two-strike, bottom-\n\nof-the-ninth homer. He always thought of himself as the underdog\n\nand a persistent self-destructive streak seemed designed to\n\nensure that he always was.\n\nA man of endless ironies, Nixon made his political\n\ngrubstake as a Cold Warrior and McCarthyite attack dog at the\n\nheight of American power, but ended his career as the president\n\nwho nursed d tente to the table, and effectively divided the\n\nCommunist Bloc.\n\nIt is this fascinating, complex man that director Oliver\n\nStone approaches in his newest film, \"Nixon.\" The director is\n\nonce again diving deep into the woods of American history -- and\n\ndisturbing the many ghosts that live there. A dramatic blend of\n\nhistorical fact and interpretation, the film is rooted in both\n\nsolid research and the dramatic license necessary to create a\n\ncompelling, full-blooded motion picture that stands on its own as\n\nentertainment.\n\nAmericans -- historians included -- have such wildly\n\ndiverse memories and understandings of Richard Nixon, some will\n\nbe angered, offended or disappointed that \"their\" Richard Nixon\n\nis not on celluloid. Some will complain that the \"monster\" was\n\ntreated with kid gloves, while others will find it blasphemous\n\nthat a former president of the United States could be portrayed\n\nas occasionally drunk and incoherent, spouting obscenities.\n\nHistorians will argue about the weight and importance given\n\nvarious incidents, policies, sources and conflicts.\n\nThe writers of \"Nixon\" have gone to great pains to insure\n\nthe film's veracity to the fullest extent possible. Richard\n\nNixon has to be considered one of the most investigated,\n\nscrutinized and exposed men of power history has known, a fact\n\naiding the writers in their efforts. Using the myriad serious\n\nand reliable biographies, memoirs, government documents, tape-\n\nrecorded conversations, congressional hearing transcripts,\n\ninvestigative works and oral histories that have been compiled\n\nover the last several decades, they have been able to sometimes\n\nuse direct quotes taken from tapes, scenes vouched for by many\n\nparticipants and facts attested to by diverse and independent\n\ninvestigators and journalists.\n\nThe script of \"Nixon\" has been annotated by its authors,\n\nciting over 80 major historical works. (The annotation is\n\navailable upon request and is being published by Hyperion as\n\nNIXON: An Oliver Stone Film.) Several controversial aspects of\n\nNixon's life are dealt with in the film, although they by no\n\nmeans dominate the other aspects of his overall story. These\n\ninclude the mysterious wiping out of the 18-and- a-half minutes\n\nof tape, Nixon's drinking and pill taking, FBI director J. Edgar\n\nHoover's personal life and relationship with mobsters, and the\n\nperiodic references in the film to \"Track 2,\" a plot organized by\n\nthe White House and CIA to assassinate Fidel Castro. (Track 1\n\nwas a parallel plan that was to be effected simultaneously, the\n\ninsertion of CIA-trained troops into Cuba to lead an anti-Castro\n\nrevolt -- what was to become the failed Bay of Pigs invasion.)\n\nTrack 2, which was well-documented in the 1970s by the U.\n\nS. Senate's Church Committee Report on \"Alleged Assassination\n\nPlots Involving Foreign Leaders,\" was a sordid affair which saw\n\nthe White House directing the CIA to hire known mobsters like\n\nJohnny Roselli to oversee the assassination of Castro (with at\n\nleast eight attempts failing miserably).\n\nThe film addresses Nixon's role as Vice President in\n\nestablishing the U.S. government's overt and covert operations\n\nagainst Fidel Castro. Although Nixon's involvement has been well\n\ndocumented by historians over the years (including Arthur\n\nSchlesinger and Michael Beschloss), it has been little noted by\n\nthe media and is not generally known by the American public. The\n\nfilm suggests that Nixon may have felt in later years that what\n\nhe helped to start in the 1950s got out of hand in the 1960s,\n\nwith catastrophic results. (Bob Haldeman has written of Nixon's\n\nconstant references to the \"Bay of Pigs,\" which Haldeman\n\nspeculated was Nixon's code word for the Kennedy assassination.\n\nFour of the seven principal Watergate figures were involved in\n\nthe Bay of Pigs, and Nixon directed Haldeman to tell CIA Director\n\nRichard Helms to help stop the FBI from pursuing Watergate\n\nbecause it would \"open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing.\")\n\nNowhere in \"Nixon\" is it claimed, however, that Richard\n\nNixon himself played any role in Track 2 activities after he was\n\ndefeated by Kennedy in 1960. In fact, a key scene has Nixon (who\n\nin fact was in Dallas the day of the assassination, leaving a few\n\nhours before) resisting the pressure of a group of influential\n\nTexans and Cubans entreating him to run against a President they\n\ndarkly hint may not be as invulnerable as he seems.\n\nBut it is clear that Nixon had a strong suspicion within\n\nhours of the JFK assassination that it was the work of extremist\n\nright-wingers. The first thing he worriedly asked J. Edgar\n\nHoover was \"Was it one of the nuts?\" (\"Nuts\" is the word Nixon\n\nusually used for the fringe conservatives.) It is a complex and\n\ndramatically important linchpin of the film that Nixon benefited\n\ngreatly both from JFK's death and that of his younger brother\n\nfive years later (when Nixon saw Robert Kennedy as his most\n\nlikely -- and most formidable -- Democratic opponent).\n\nNixon, according to several sources, suffered from\n\nsurvivor's guilt -- he watched his older brother Harold and\n\nyounger brother Arthur die of tuberculosis -- and the deaths of\n\nJFK and RFK, which cleared the way for Nixon's ultimate political\n\nascendance, could only have added to this guilt.\n\nIn addition to a number of scholarly works -- such as\n\nJonathan Aitken's Nixon: A Life, Stephen Ambrose's three-volume\n\nbiography on Nixon, Tom Wicker's One of Us: Richard Nixon and the\n\nAmerican Dream, Fawn Brodie's Richard Nixon: The Shaping of His\n\nCharacter, Roger Morris' Richard Milhous Nixon: The Rise of an\n\nAmerican Politician and Garry Wills' Nixon Agonistes -- useful\n\nsources for \"Nixon\" were memoirs (those of Nixon, Dean, Haldeman,\n\nKissinger, Ehrlichman, Hunt, etc.), interviews (i.e. the Nixon-\n\nFrost sessions) and documentaries, such as \"Watergate,\" shown on\n\nThe Discovery Channel. Scenes were also drawn directly from\n\nofficial transcripts -- Nixon's resignation speech, for example -\n\n- and documentation kept by the participants themselves. Of\n\ncourse, the transcripts of those Nixon tape recordings that have\n\nbeen released to the public -- a tiny percentage of the total --\n\nwere also useful sources for Watergate-related dialogue.\n\nThe producers also met with a wide range of political\n\npeople who lived through Nixon's era, including Alexander Haig,\n\nJohn Dean, E. Howard Hunt, Eugenio Martinez, Leonard Garment, Ron\n\nZiegler, John Sears, Elliot Richardson, Steve Hess, Robert\n\nMcNamara and Paul Nitze. Former Assistant to the President and\n\nSecretary to the Cabinet Alexander Butterfield, and former\n\nSpecial Counsel to the President John Dean, both served as two of\n\nthe several technical advisors to \"Nixon.\"\n\nAs stated on the first page of the script, \"Nixon\" is an\n\nattempt to understand the life of America's 37th President. It\n\nis neither hagiography nor horror show, but an effort to explore,\n\nwith integrity and compassion, a most remarkable and disturbing\n\nman of our time.\n\nABOUT THE PRODUCTION\n\nRichard Nixon was a man who lived not one, but several\n\nlives, some of which ended in disaster, others in triumph. His\n\nfinal exit was in fact one of his greatest successes, as he was\n\nlaid to rest extolled by fellow former Presidents, world leaders,\n\npoliticians, historians and admirers. Several candidates for the\n\n1996 Presidential race have lifted the Nixon banner high,\n\naspiring to what they perceive to be his finest qualities.\n\n\"It's a year after his death,\" says the filmmaker Oliver\n\nStone about his reasons for making this film, \"and Nixon remains\n\none of the most fascinating and frustrating figures of 20th\n\ncentury American history. He's, in fact, a man of the century -\n\n- he lived through the promise of the California pioneers, the\n\nDepression, World War II, the Cold War, Vietnam, the war at home\n\nduring those years, the end of the Cold War and world Communism.\n\nIt's almost as if he embodies everything that's right and wrong\n\nabout America in general and American politicians in particular.\n\nThere's no question that he was brilliant, but he used it for\n\nless than noble ends. His potential was limitless, but\n\nultimately was limited by powers that even he couldn't control.\n\n\"To some degree,\" Stone says, \"Nixon\" is about the\n\nillusion of power. Nixon himself said that he had been to the\n\nhighest peaks and the lowest valleys. He is a giant of a tragic\n\nfigure in the classical tradition. Humble origins, rising to the\n\ntop, then crashing down in a heap of hubris.\"\n\nOliver Stone decided to take on the task of interpreting\n\nRichard Nixon's life on film after two other projects failed to\n\ncome together for the director. \"We (our company) had developed\n\ntwo consecutive projects about strong but fatally flawed\n\npolitical leaders -- General Manuel Noriega and Eva Peron --\n\nwhich for one reason or another we decided not to proceed with.\n\nI was particularly interested in doing a character study of a\n\npowerful leader against a large historical backdrop, and Eric\n\nHamburg -- who had come to work with us from Indiana Rep. Lee\n\nHamilton's staff in Washington, D.C. and was extremely helpful in\n\ngetting the JFK Records Act passed in 1992 -- suggested Richard\n\nNixon. Eric met with Stephen Rivele and Christopher Wilkinson\n\nand asked them to submit a treatment. The idea appealed to me.\n\nI thought the time was right for a serious examination of this\n\nextraordinary man.\"\n\nStone hired these two inspired writers with whom he wrote\n\nthe script.Looking for Nixon\n\nAs the screenplay by Stephen J. Rivele, Christopher\n\nWilkinson and Stone was completed -- with further contributions\n\nby political columnist Robert Scheer, Christopher Scheer,\n\npolitical analyst and author John Newman and former Nixon counsel\n\nJohn Dean -- the director had a crucial casting matter to\n\nconsider . . . who would portray Richard M. Nixon?\n\nThis was no easy issue. Unlike figures of history past,\n\nNixon, gone for only a year, is still very much alive in the\n\npublic mind and imagination. Stone's task was to find an actor\n\nwho could breathe life into his subject without falling into\n\ncaricature, and someone with the physical and artistic stamina to\n\nhandle a tremendously demanding role that would require 55 days\n\nof intense work in a schedule that was limited by budget\n\nconsiderations to 61 days. The script was a thick 170 pages.\n\nStone soon pinpointed the man he wanted . . . Sir Anthony\n\nHopkins, who has demonstrated over the course of his remarkable\n\ncareer on stage, screen and television the ability to tackle\n\nnearly any role in whatever genre, whether it be classical,\n\ncomedic, contemporary or historical. And the fact that he was\n\nchoosing an actor born in Wales to portray one of the most famous\n\nof American presidents was of little concern to Stone.\n\n\"Some of Tony's previous roles have shown a melancholy,\n\nlonely quality that was perfect for Nixon,\" continues Stone. \"He\n\nalso has the right look to play the man. But aside from\n\neverything, he's just a great actor who can, I believe, play\n\nanything he sets his mind to.\"\n\nAs for the actor, the modest Hopkins was not, at the\n\noutset, quite so confident as the director who was seeking his\n\ntalents: \"When my agent told me that Oliver Stone was sending me\n\na script about Nixon, I said 'Well, I can't think of any English\n\ncharacters who were involved with all that.' He said, 'No, he\n\nwants you to play Nixon!' And I thought, well, this man is\n\ncrazy, and even though I loved the script, I told Oliver that I\n\ndidn't think I could possibly play Richard Nixon.\n\n\"The next thing I knew, Oliver turned up in London, and on\n\nmy way to meet him for breakfast, I sensed that this wasn't just\n\nan opportunity to play a great part. I sensed that it would be a\n\npersonal challenge to me, not just as an actor, but to me\n\npersonally. A chance to see if I had the guts to do something\n\ntruly ambitious and risky. I suddenly realized that it would be\n\ninsane to turn it down. So 24 hours after we met for breakfast,\n\nI phoned him up when he returned to Los Angeles and told him that\n\nI wanted to do it. Oliver said 'You're sure?' I said\n\n'Absolutely sure.' And he said 'You can't turn back now.' So I\n\ntook a deep breath and moved toward a project which turned out to\n\nbe the most exciting I've ever been involved with.\"Assembling the\n\nCast\n\nWith Hopkins on board, Stone proceeded to populate his\n\nenormous cast of characters with an accomplished group of\n\nensemble players, some of them major stars in their own right\n\ndevoting just a day or two to become involved with what they\n\nperceived to be an important film.\n\n\"The remarkable thing about our cast,\" says Stone, \"is\n\nthat even though it's filled with 'big names,' not one of them\n\nhas ever allowed themselves to become stereotyped in their\n\ncareers. All of them are great character actors.\"\n\nThe performers set about researching their characters and\n\nthe times in which they lived. Stone, Hopkins and James Woods,\n\nwho portrays White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman, made a\n\nresearch trip to Washington, D.C., where they spent time in the\n\nWhite House and other landmarks of the nation's capital and met\n\nwith Nixon intimates. Joan Allen, cast as Pat Nixon, spent hours\n\nreading about Mrs. Nixon and watching videotapes in New York's\n\nMuseum of Television and Radio Broadcasting. Some of the actors\n\nhad the opportunity to speak -- either directly or over the\n\ntelephone -- with the men they were to portray, including Powers\n\nBoothe (Alexander Haig), David Paymer (Ron Ziegler), David Hyde\n\nPierce (John Dean) and Paul Sorvino (Henry Kissinger).\n\nHopkins, meanwhile, immersed himself in an ocean of books,\n\nfilms and videotapes, studying Nixon's mannerisms and voice,\n\nseeking subtleties of interpretation in addition to the most\n\nobviously recognizable. In his research, Hopkins found himself\n\nseeking a \"place of empathy\" which would allow him to portray\n\nRichard Nixon in three human dimensions. \"I don't have any\n\njudgments, political or apolitical,\" explains Hopkins. \"I'm just\n\ntrying to play the human being that he was. I think the\n\nmechanism that got Nixon into the White House was also the\n\nmechanism that ended him. Whenever I watch his final walk to the\n\nhelicopter after resigning the Presidency, I find that so moving\n\nand tragic. My interpretation of that look on his face is 'What\n\nthe hell happened? Why have I blown it?' I think he blew it\n\nbecause he was tormented by the demons inside that he couldn't\n\nreconcile. Some people can overcome their inner demons and\n\nmonsters, and Nixon was one who just couldn't. And that's his\n\ntragedy . . . that's his pain.\n\n\"Nixon was a great man in his way,\" Hopkins continues,\n\n\"but he seemed to be an alien in his own land. You know, Nixon\n\nis much more popular overseas than he is in the U.S. He was a\n\nman who was awkward in society. When he went to Washington he\n\nwas disliked intensely, because of his political history. He was\n\nruthless, he was tough. He destroyed Alger Hiss, he destroyed\n\nHelen Gahagan Douglas. Those were the rules he lived by. But to\n\nbecome the President of the United States from those humble\n\nbeginnings in Yorba Linda and Whittier . . . that's an\n\nextraordinary man. That's not a little guy. That's a man driven\n\nby some great passion, some great vision.\"Organizing the\n\nProduction\n\nWhile script and casting were crystallizing, producer\n\nClayton Townsend was laying the groundwork for a rigorous\n\nproduction schedule which would call for the creative team to\n\ndevote full energies in bringing a large chunk of American and\n\nworld history to multi-dimensional life. And despite the huge\n\norganization that Townsend previously had to contend with on such\n\npast Stone projects as \"Born on the Fourth of July,\" \"The Doors,\"\n\n\"JFK,\" \"Heaven and Earth\" and \"Natural Born Killers,\" the\n\nproducer was faced with his biggest challenges yet.\n\n\"In terms of sheer logistics, 'Nixon' is the toughest film\n\nI've ever done,\" notes Townsend. \"We had to shoot an epic 170-\n\npage script on an economical budget in only 61 days.\" Although\n\nsuch locations as Washington, Virginia and North Carolina were\n\noriginally contemplated, Stone and Townsend decided upon Los\n\nAngeles as the primary shooting site when they learned that\n\nextensive White House sets had recently been constructed and\n\nutilized for the Castle Rock Entertainment production of \"The\n\nAmerican President\" on Stages 20, 26 and 30 at Sony Studios in\n\nCulver City, and Stage 15 of the nearby Culver Studios.\n\n\"We looked at the sets with our production designer,\n\nVictor Kempster, and we soon decided that these sets, with\n\nadditional work, could function perfectly as our Nixon White\n\nHouse,\" continues Townsend. \"And since so much of the film is\n\nset within the White House walls -- and Oliver likes to shoot in\n\ncontinuity as much as possible -- we decided to remain in the\n\nSouthern California area for as much of the production as\n\npossible.\"Washington in Los Angeles\n\nThe obvious challenge for Victor Kempster and his talented\n\nart department team -- including art directors Don Woodruff,\n\nRichard Mays and Margery Zweizig and set decorator Merideth\n\nBoswell -- was to create interior and exterior environments that\n\nwould be absolutely believable backdrops for the story primarily\n\nset in Washington, D.C. and its environs...almost entirely on\n\nSouthern California soundstages and locations.\n\nAs noted by producer Townsend, the White House sets\n\noriginally constructed for \"The American President\" presented an\n\nexcellent foundation for Kempster and his staff to extensively\n\nre-dress and re-build for the Nixon White House according to\n\nhistorical detail. \"Fortunately for us,\" says Kempster, \"the\n\n'American President' designer did quite a nice job on the\n\nresidential wing, so we mostly had to re-decorate that one, and\n\nbuild the Lincoln Sitting Room from scratch, because that wasn't\n\npart of their scenery.\n\n\"The Oval Office and West Wing we had to re-do quite a\n\nbit, because 'The American President' is a contemporary romantic\n\nfantasy, and our film had to be rooted in the reality of\n\nhistory.\" The results of the painstakingly detailed work were\n\nso amazingly authentic that even technical advisor Alexander\n\nButterfield -- who worked in the White House every day for five\n\nyears as Assistant to the President and Secretary to the Cabinet\n\n-- did a double take the first time he saw it. \"I was amazed,\n\ndumbfounded. I couldn't believe what I was seeing -- the\n\nRoosevelt Room first, then the Oval Office, then the Cabinet Room\n\n-- everything to scale and precisely as I remembered it. Not\n\nonly the sofas, desks, tables and chairs, but the little things,\n\ntoo -- the clocks, the President's pens, paintings, textiles and\n\npatterns. I was honestly transported back in time to the early\n\n'70s. I couldn't stand there and look around without feeling\n\ncertain that I was in Washington. In fact, the entire first week\n\nof shooing in the Oval Office and the Cabinet Room had me\n\nconfused. On the set, I was in Washington. I couldn't think\n\notherwise. Yet, whenever I left the soundstage and emerged out\n\ninto the sunlight, there I was on the Sony Studio property . . .\n\nin the middle of Los Angeles.\"\n\nKempster and his art department heads benefited from a\n\nresearch trip to Washington, during which \"we were treated\n\nbeautifully by people at the White House. We had a very\n\nextensive tour there, and spent a lot of time measuring and\n\nexamining small details.\" They also spent hours of research in\n\nthe White House Archives, studying photographs of the White House\n\nrooms during the Nixon Administration.\n\n(It certainly didn't hurt matters that set decorator\n\nMerideth Boswell, who hails from Arkansas, is an old family\n\nfriend of Bill Clinton.)\n\nPerhaps the art department's most amazing feat would be\n\ntheir awesome full-scale re-creation of the Lincoln Memorial\n\ninterior sanctuary on Stage 30 of Sony Studios. Renovation and\n\nhighly visible scaffolding on the actual Lincoln Memorial in\n\nWashington made it impossible for the filmmakers to shoot the\n\nscene there in its entirety, but the set on Stage 30 was to be an\n\nawesomely effective substitute.\n\nThe actual statue of President Lincoln -- 19 feet tall,\n\nand 33 feet from its imposing base, exactly as is Daniel Chester\n\nFrench's original -- was sculpted from polyurethane foam. Head\n\nsculptor Fred Arbegast utilized not only the exact dimensions of\n\nthe real article in Washington, but one of Lincoln's actual death\n\nmasks for detailing on the head. Some of the major entry columns\n\nand six of the side columns were also sculpted by Arbegast and\n\nhis crew of five in Styrofoam. The Shoot\n\nPrincipal photography on \"Nixon\" commenced on May 1, 1995\n\ninside the Oval Office set at Sony Studios -- an Oval Office\n\ndressed exactly as Nixon's, with its imperial golds and blues,\n\nbird statues on the shelves, Presidential desk sparsely\n\noutfitted. For Anthony Hopkins, a lifelong America-phile, it was\n\na true day of destiny. Stone had already decided in the pre-\n\nproduction phase to eschew \"mask\" makeup for Hopkins' Nixon,\n\nchoosing instead to allow the actor to create Nixon from the\n\ninside out, with subtle physical alterations.\n\nSays the director, \"I didn't want the audience to sit\n\nthere and say 'Wow, what a fantastic makeup job! He looks\n\nexactly like Nixon!,' instead of concentrating on the character\n\nand story. We wanted to suggest Nixon rather than a nightclub\n\nimpressionist's act, which would only distract the audience.\n\n\"In fact, we did experiment for several tests and at great\n\nexpense with Nixonian prosthetics -- the jowls and prominent\n\nnose -- but you always risk the Madame Tussaud pitfall. Tony is\n\na strong enough actor so that you don't need those effects.\"\n\nAnd so, working with a hairpiece, Nixon-esque upper teeth,\n\nbrown contact lenses and more prominent eyebrows, key makeup\n\nartist John Blake and key hair stylist Cydney Cornell transformed\n\nAnthony Hopkins on a daily basis into Richard Nixon. The\n\ntechnical advisors and visitors to the set who had known and\n\nworked with Richard Nixon -- Alex Butterfield, John and Maureen\n\nDean, former campaign manager John Sears, E. Howard Hunt -- were\n\nastonished to find that through body language, gestures and\n\nvoice, the late President was resurrected before their eyes.\n\n\"Anthony Hopkins has very definitely captured the essence\n\nor aura of Nixon,\" notes Butterfield. \"First of all, his years\n\nof voice training have given him the ability to nail down the\n\nprecise pitch and tone of Nixon's voice ... this in addition to\n\nmastering the American accent. Secondly, he has the posture of\n\nNixon, the gestures and mannerisms, down pat. Many viewers may\n\nnot know of Nixon's odd way of gesturing and others may not\n\nrecall them. But those who knew Nixon well may be astounded.\"\n\nAlso of note was special makeup artist Gordon Smith's\n\nremarkable work on Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger and Bob\n\nHoskins as J. Edgar Hoover, as well as Blake and Cornell's\n\ndesigns for the remainder of the huge cast, many of whom strongly\n\nresemble their real-life counterparts.\n\nAdding to the historical accuracy of \"Nixon\" were the\n\ncostumes designed by Richard Hornung, more than 5,000 in all,\n\ncovering a 60-year-long stretch of styles and fashions for both\n\nmen and women. \"My favorite period was the early '60s,\" says\n\nHornung, \"but the '70s was the ugliest time ever for fashion.\n\nAnd it was hard finding enough clothes that were conservative\n\nenough for what those working in the White House had to wear,\n\nbecause so many colors and shapes of early '70s design were so\n\noutlandish. So we had to make nearly everything for Anthony\n\nHopkins, Joan Allen, James Woods and many of the other actors.\"\n\nCinematically, Oliver Stone and his longtime collaborator,\n\ncinematographer Robert Richardson, sought to develop a style\n\nunique to the project. \"'Nixon' is different from anything we've\n\ndone previously, including 'JFK' and 'Natural Born Killers,'\"\n\nsays Stone. \"Falling back on what we've done before would be\n\nuninteresting to me, Bob Richardson and everyone else on the\n\ncrew. It's exciting to experiment and re-invent. We're using\n\nthe widescreen format, which allows for dynamic compositions and\n\ninteresting spatial use of the screen, but I think we've fallen\n\ninto a style somewhere between \"JFK\" and \"Natural Born Killers.\"\n\nAlso visually inspired by \"Nixon\" was production designer\n\nKempster, who in addition to the White House sets, had to create\n\ndozens of other environments to the story's vast backdrop.\n\nThese included an exact re-creation of the television\n\nstudio in which Nixon debated John F. Kennedy in 1960, filmed at\n\nVideo Image, a company which would also provide computerized\n\ncomposites for \"Nixon\" which would place Anthony Hopkins in the\n\nsame frame as actual historical personages; the musty,\n\natmospheric Beijing office of Mao Tse-Tung, created in a ballroom\n\nof downtown L.A.'s Park Plaza Hotel; and also at Sony Studios,\n\nNixon's private office in Washington's Old Executive Office\n\nBuilding (O.E.O.B.), a Los Angeles Ambassador Hotel suite in\n\nwhich Nixon and his campaign team watch his Presidential\n\ncandidacy fall to John F. Kennedy, and the podium from which\n\nNixon delivered his triumphant speech upon being named the\n\nRepublican Party's candidate for the 1968 race; the \"California\n\nDeco\" grounds of Santa Anita Racetrack in Arcadia doubled for San\n\nDiego's Del Mar track, where a reluctant Nixon is met by J. Edgar\n\nHoover and gangster Johnny Roselli.\n\nOne of the most notable re-creations was an entirely\n\nconvincing White House gate, constructed at one of the entrances\n\ninto El Dorado Park in Long Beach. Local residents --\n\nparticularly those who had visited the real thing in the nation's\n\ncapital -- were amazed to discover that their local recreation\n\narea was such a dead ringer with the addition of those wood-and-\n\nplaster gates.\n\nOutside of the Los Angeles area, the \"Nixon\" company\n\nalighted to the Circle K Ranch in the Santa Ynez mountains of the\n\nCalifornia Central Coast region, which had both the look and\n\nsurrounding topography to suggest a large spread in the hills\n\noutside of Dallas, Texas.\n\nAnd in the town of Redlands, on a road running between\n\ncitrus groves, location manager Jeff Flach discovered the ideal\n\nlocation for the Nixon family's East Whittier grocery\n\nstore/filling station and white frame house. A realistic image\n\nof a California that existed 60 years ago, production designer\n\nVictor Kempster built the evocative grocery store from ground up,\n\nand totally reconstructed an abandoned home to resemble the\n\nenvironment where Richard Nixon spent his most formative years.\n\nNearby, in Riverside, the magnificent Mission Inn was utilized to\n\npresent the backdrop for a brief scene re-creating the 1940\n\nmarriage of Richard Nixon and Patricia Ryan...who indeed took\n\ntheir vows at the very same Mission Inn 55 years ago. Another\n\nimage of the past was conjured up in Fillmore, with a 1952 Nixon\n\n-- with Pat by his side -- campaigning for congressman from the\n\nback of a vintage train. (John Dean has a cameo appearance in a\n\nclose-up shot as a man in the crowd listening to Nixon.)\n\nThe last days of filming in Los Angeles were done on the\n\nharbor off the coast of San Pedro, with the beautiful 1930s-era\n\nyacht Electra standing in for the Presidential yacht Sequoia,\n\nwhere Nixon and his key staff discuss matters of State over a\n\ntense dinner on the Potomac. Washington Finale However, there\n\nwas some poetic justice in the fact that the \"Nixon\" production\n\nwas to wrap not in L.A., but in Washington, D.C., where Stone and\n\ncompany worked in torrid summer heat to capture both the look and\n\nfeeling of the nation's capital.\n\n\"Trying to obtain permissions to film these scenes was\n\nquite difficult,\" says producer Clayton Townsend. \"The\n\nnegotiations required several trips to Washington, and high-level\n\nconversations.\" An important nighttime meeting between John Dean\n\n(David Hyde Pierce) and Watergate conspirator E. Howard Hunt (Ed\n\nHarris) was shot on the Inlet Bridge, with the illuminated\n\nJefferson and Washington Memorials dramatically looming in the\n\nbackground. Shots of Anthony Hopkins as Nixon, ascending the\n\nsteps of the real Lincoln Memorial, tied in with the sequences\n\npreviously shot at Sony's Stage 30. It was a fitting finale in\n\nthe early morning hours of July 27, 1995 for a production of\n\nuncommon ambitiousness.\n\nToward the end of filming, the actors took a moment to\n\nruminate on their weeks of hard work and dedication filming\n\n\"Nixon.\"\n\n\"I've worked with some really good directors,\" says\n\nAnthony Hopkins, \"all of whom are different. And I don't reduce\n\ntheir stature because I'm working with Oliver Stone. But I think\n\nhe's the most provocative, dangerous director I've ever worked\n\nwith, and at 57 years of age, I'm glad I had the guts to accept\n\nhis offer to play Nixon.\n\n\"Oliver will make you do take after take if it's not\n\nright, and he'll knock down the crutches that you have...which is\n\nwonderful emotional and spiritual growth for an actor.\"\n\n\"Anthony Hopkins is magnificent as both an actor and a\n\nhuman being,\" notes Joan Allen, who portrays Pat Nixon. \"You\n\nknow, Tony has really dug into the depths of this very\n\nparadoxical figure, and he's both extremely warm and supportive\n\nas a fellow actor.\n\n\"As for Oliver Stone, he's worked very, very hard on the\n\nscript as a writer, and I had a wonderful time working with him\n\nas a director. Oliver is a true actor's director, with an\n\nunerring eye for dramatic accuracy. He's very supportive, and\n\ntruly directs you.\"\n\n\"Oliver has been very focused on his sense of the history\n\nof the piece, and not just the drama of the piece,\" adds James\n\nWoods. \"I was initially shocked by how compassionate the script\n\nis towards Richard Nixon as a man, and it's to Oliver's credit\n\nthat the film has a view of this man in a way that might surprise\n\neveryone.\"\n\nAdds Mary Steenburgen, \"I think Oliver Stone has a lot of\n\nrespect for the life of Richard Nixon.\"\n\nConcludes Stone: \"I've been asked if this film makes any\n\nmoral judgments on Richard Nixon. 'Moral' is a dangerous word.\n\nIt's not for me to make moral judgments or draw simplistic\n\nconclusions from the life and career of Richard Nixon. Good and\n\nevil live side-by-side in every human being, but when they're in\n\npositions of great power -- as Nixon was -- those dualities can\n\naffect the entire world. Like all of us, Richard Nixon was a\n\ncatalog of complexities and contradictions. The audience will\n\ndraw their own conclusions, or better yet, question the history\n\nthat evolves on screen.\n\n\"Like 'JFK,' I hope that 'Nixon' will inspire debate and\n\nindependent thinking.\"\n\nABOUT THE CAST\n\nSIR ANTHONY HOPKINS (Richard M.
