I came into Mad Love assuming that it would be a schlock-fest with a few okay moments, but ended up pleasantly surprised with how touching, relatable and real Mad Love's portrayal of bipolar disorder was! Drew Barrymore's Casey goes through episodes of hypomania and depression, as well as mixed episodes. She's more than \"quirky\" - she lives with mental illness. She's a cute, witty and…"
