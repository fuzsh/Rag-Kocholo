No need for sentences or paragraphs, but do clearly signal what your examples are from the film in short phrases. To do this:\n\n1) Identify the ISA/RSA **by the name Althusser gives them** (can include the one we modified in lecture)\n\n2) Then list as many example(s) from Sorry to Bother You as you can that you found for each category.\n\nIt's okay to transcribe your notes from the film (not a photograph, but written/typed/transcribed/pasted), but they must be your own notes, of course!"
