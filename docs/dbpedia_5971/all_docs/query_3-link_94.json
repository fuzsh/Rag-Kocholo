        "text": "Must-see movies are futuristic classics that shouldn’t be missed. Of course, not every must-see is perfect. That’s why we’ve rated them 1-5 on the patented “crunchy goodness” scale.\n\nTitle: Mad Love\n\nDate: 1935\n\nVitals: A famous pianist suffers a potentially career-destroying injury to his hand until a seemingly benevolent doctor offers him a miraculous, futuristic hand transplant. Unfortunately, the doctor is a freakazoid in love with the pianist’s wife, and he grafts the limb of an executed murderer onto the pianist’s arm. Put simply, the new hand would rather do some choppin’ rather than play Chopin.\n\nFamous names: Peter Lorre, Karl Freund\n\nCrunchy goodness: 5\n\nStunt casting: Peter Lorre, whose expressively anguished face and raspy voice made him the king of 1930s horror flicks, plays the mad doctor with a skill that puts the rest of the cast to shame.\n\nSight you’ll never unsee: The pianist practicing knife throwing in his parlor between concertos.\n\nCopycats: The plot of this movie, based on the novel The Hands of Orlac, has become a kind of mini-genre that includes movies like The Hand, as well as other flicks where people receive transplants that take over their lives. What sets this first entry in the genre apart is that it’s also the story of a mad doctor’s freakish, stalkery love for an actress, whom he hopes to impress with his limb-swapping experiments."
