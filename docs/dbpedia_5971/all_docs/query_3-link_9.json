However, Dr. Gogol (Peter Lorre), her biggest fan, won't let her go so easily. When Stephen's hands are destroyed in an accident, Dr. Gogol's obsession with Yvonne leads him to replace Stephen's hands with those of a knife-wielding murderer who was sentenced to death. Soon, Stephen's new hands develop a mind of their own.",
