        "text": "The Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) will be doing a retrospective of acclaimed Swedish actor Max von Sydow’s films from Tuesday, November 27 through Friday, December 14. I’m a big fan of Max von Sydow’s work and I consider him a master of his craft, so I’m definitely looking forward to catching one or two films in the series – I probably won’t be able to see more than that since my college semester is winding down and I have a lot of projects and exams coming up.\n\nI have seen five Max von Sydow films: The Seventh Seal (1957), The Virgin Spring (1960), Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), Awakenings (1990) and Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011). My single favorite role of those five is Frederick in Hannah and Her Sisters, in which Max does not have much screen time, but he certainly makes the most of it.\n\nExtremely Loud & Incredibly Close, for which Max got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination last year, is particularly moving because his character never says a word; he relies on facial expressions, other physical gestures, a notepad and, as an extra intriguing detail, the words “yes” and “no” tattooed on each hand.\n\nIf I had to pick two screenings that I want to make it to, I would choose The Magician (1958, dir. Ingmar Bergman) and Death Watch (1980, dir. Bertrand Tavernier). The Magician is not the best-known of Max’s collaborations with Ingmar Bergman, but I am fascinated by the still photos I have seen from it. The Magician also stars Ingrid Thulin, Gunnar Björnstrand, Naima Wifstrand, Bengt Ekerot, Bibi Andersson, Lars Ekborg, Erland Josephson and Birgitta Pettersson, all notable Swedish actors. By comparison, Death Watch has a cast starring actors from all walks of international filmdom: besides Max there’s Romy Schneider, Harvey Keitel, Harry Dean Stanton, Thérèse Liotard, Caroline Langrishe, William Russell, Bernhard Wicki and even a young Robbie Coltrane.\n\nSilver Linings Playbook is another award-worthy 2012 film. I saw a preview of it last night at the Museum of Modern Art, after which director David O. Russell had a conversation with two moderators. (For whatever reason there was no Q&A.)\n\nJennifer Lawrence was the real surprise for me. If you’re like me and all you know her from is X-Men: First Class (sorry, Hunger Games fans), you’ll be really blown away by her performance in Playbook. Her character has a vibrancy and firecracker quality that I haven’t seen from a new young actress in quite some time. Bradley Cooper also gives an excellent performance. The two of them have great chemistry and shine in their dancing scenes.\n\nRobert De Niro and Jacki Weaver do fantastic work as Cooper’s parents. De Niro has one of his best acting showcases in years. Weaver’s American accent isn’t perfect, but she’s always so enjoyable to watch that I didn’t mind much. Paul Herman, whom you might recognize from a number of Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese films, has a nice little role as Randy, one of De Niro’s bookmaking pals. I didn’t see a point to Chris Tucker’s character, except for one or two bits of advice he gives Cooper and Lawrence regarding their dance rehearsals. Otherwise, the comedic aspects of Tucker’s character didn’t work well.\n\nAll in all, it’s a fine film that deserves to be seen.\n\nThe MoMA film entrance, post-film. Shot from outside, looking in through the window with the curtains drawn.\n\nThe Birds. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Arguably the last Hitchcock “masterpiece,” The Birds introduced Tippi Hedren to the world. Hedren isn’t the most talented actress Hitchcock ever worked with, but she does a nice job as our lovely blonde protagonist. Suzanne Pleshette, Rod Taylor, Jessica Tandy and Veronica Cartwright round out the main cast, along with appearances from memorable character actors like Ethel Griffies, Charles McGraw, Joe Mantell, Malcolm Atterbury (the guy who stood across from Cary Grant at the crossroads bus stop in North by Northwest), Elizabeth Wilson and Doodles Weaver. Notably, the film does not have a score; rather, Bernard Herrmann served as “sound consultant,” in charge of the bird noises. The lack of music makes the horror even more effective, especially during the scene when the birds gather and attack at the schoolhouse. Unlike the later Hitchcock flick Frenzy, The Birds avoids the feeling of being an “ugly” story. Its colorfulness, thanks to the cinematography (by Hitchcock regular Robert Burks), costumes, art direction and set decoration, adds greatly to the impact.\n\nCharade. Directed by Stanley Donen. I fondly recall the first time I saw this delightfully romantic comedy-thriller: when I was about eight or nine years old I caught Charade on TV (AMC, to be exact). I was hooked from the moment the film started. For years I had been a big fan of Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn so I was pleased by their pairing. Their chemistry is divine, despite the 25-year age difference between them. They are ably supported by Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy, Ned Glass and Jacques Marin, among others. Solving the plot’s Hitchcockian mystery is part of the entertainment, besides seeing so many wonderful actors in their prime. Besides Hepburn’s cosmopolitan appeal, the exciting Parisian setting, including a number of scenes shot on location, imbues the film with a real sense of sophistication. All told, Charade is a whole lot of fun.\n\nHud. Directed by Martin Ritt. Paul Newman has long been an icon of youthful coolness and later-in-life charity, but it’s important to remember what a mesmerizing actor he was. As the title character, the cruel “man with the barbed wire soul,” Newman’s raw charisma is electrifying. Patricia Neal deserved her Best Actress Oscar win; few actresses could portray unglamorous women with the same intensity she had. Melvyn Douglas also snagged an Oscar, earning the title of Best Supporting Actor for playing Newman’s aging, truth-telling father. Perhaps most underrated in the cast is Brandon De Wilde as Paul Newman’s younger brother, who looks up to Newman despite his loathsome habits. De Wilde popped up in a bunch of notable 50s and 60s films, always doing first-rate work. The true star of the film, however, is James Wong Howe’s Oscar-winning cinematography. Filmed on location in Texas, every vista is illuminated – for better or worse – by what looks like natural light.\n\nJason and the Argonauts. Directed by Don Chaffey. This larger-than-life childhood favorite of mine benefits from the genius of special effects/stop-motion animation master Ray Harryhausen. Talos, the giant statue that comes to life on the Isle of Bronze, remains a fearsome villain even in the today’s modern age of CGI. The colors of the film are gorgeous, especially the costumes and makeup that Nancy Kovack wears. The acting is maybe not the best it could have been, although Kovack and lead actor Todd Armstrong are decent enough as Jason and Medea respectively. My favorite performances are probably the ones given by Honor Blackman (later Pussy Galore in Goldfinger) as Hera and Patrick “Second Doctor Who” Troughton as Phineas. Moreover, there’s the enjoyably loud, brassy Bernard Herrmann score and the excellent set pieces designed to represent the mythic Mount Olympus.\n\nThe Silence. Directed by Ingmar Bergman. If you’ve ever read The Guardian UK, you may have seen their ongoing series of essays called “The Film That Changed My Life.” In my case, I might point to The Silence as one such film. It’s not simply a scandalous art house feature famous for its themes of explicit sex, implied incest and lesbianism; it is a film which challenges the viewer to see and feel things that mainstream American films did not discuss at that time. Not even today do you usually expect to see a scene involving female masturbation, let alone in a movie from 1963. I consider The Silence a turning point in my film-watching history because it changed the way I understood the power of the cinematic narrative. As a 16-year-old watching the film alone during an early morning showing on IFC (this was years ago, back when IFC was still commercial-free), I felt that I was witnessing a story unlike any other. The story told through its two lead actresses, Ingrid Thulin and Gunnel Lindblom, is a forerunner of the complicated females in later Bergman films like Persona and Cries and Whispers. New York Daily News critic Wanda Hale referred to The Silence as “the most shocking film I have ever seen”; I think you would be hard-pressed to disagree that it is a film which continues to hold power over its audience.\n\nLast night my mother and I attended the opening night of the Pierre Étaix retrospective at the Film Forum. First we saw the short film Heureux Anniversaire (1962), which won the 1963 Academy Award for Best Short Subject, Live Action Subjects and the 1964 BAFTA Award for Best Short Film. Afterward, M. Étaix – who is currently experiencing his very first trip to NYC – was introduced to briefly thank us for being in the audience and to thank the Film Forum for its excellent projection and film quality (he spoke too soon; a couple of times throughout the film there were technical issues with changing the reels and the theater lights flickering on and off, not to mention horrible microphone feedback problems during the Q&A). But the feature film, the Palme d’Or-nominated Le Grand Amour (1969), was indeed just that: a grand film full of delightfully comedic – and sometimes poignant – remarks about the state of married life.\n\nM. Étaix generously answered many questions in the Q&A, even after the microphone fiasco that made the audience members have to shout or relay what they said to an usher who would in turn shout back to M. Étaix and the Film Forum’s French translator. When asked who his favorite contemporary directors were/are, M. Étaix first said Clint Eastwood, which of course got a big laugh. He then named William Friedkin and Stanley Kubrick, which made sense given Étaix’s earlier discussion of his appreciation of horror films and how closely comedy and suspense are linked. (He also said he was a fan of Hitchcock.)\n\nI took the above photo of the Film Forum after leaving the event, which I think was approximately 9:45 pm. I loved the glow of the sign, which looked more wondrously magical than I had ever seen it before. It was obvious to me that Pierre Étaix’s “grand amour” – for comedy, filmmaking and his co-star/wife at the time, Annie Fratellini – is a love that everyone in the audience shared last night. We all basked in the glow of the film and the glow of the Film Forum.\n\nLast night I had the pleasure of seeing the Jacques Demy film Lola (1961) at the Museum of Modern Art. I had never seen the film – or any Demy film – before, but I figured that Lola, which was Demy’s first feature film, would be a good place to start. I was especially excited because the film, which was screened in Theater 1, was introduced by its star, Anouk Aimée. Ms. Aimée walked past me both on her way to the podium and back up the aisle; I sat on the aisle of the third row of the left side seats. That’s always the best place to sit if someone is going to talk at MoMA. That way you can see whoever is speaking at the podium and when you watch the movie, your view is unimpeded.\n\nStanding at the podium for only a few minutes, Ms. Aimée looked beautiful for age 80. Her hair was down and she wore simple, elegant black clothes. I was both surprised and pleased to see that up-close, her face looked almost exactly as it did half a century ago. Another nice surprise was having J. Hoberman, whose writing I quite like, sitting a few rows behind me.\n\nThe film was charming, although the real star was Marc Michel. For whatever reason, Michel has not appeared in many notable films, despite a career that started in 1955 and is still in existence today; the most famous of his films, besides Lola, would be Jacques Becker’s Le Trou (1960), Luigi Comencini’s Bebo’s Girl (1963), Jacques Demy’s The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964) and Just Jaeckin’s Madame Claude (1977). Michel is wonderful in Lola. I wondered while watching the movie if his character’s name, Roland, was chosen because of the “Song of Roland,” the heroic poem written during Charlemagne’s reign as king. I remember learning about the poem in a high school French class. (According to Wikipedia, “The Song of Roland” is the oldest surviving major work of French literature.) Michel feels like a hero; he’s a romantic, though he sometimes tries to hide that aspect of his personality.\n\nMichel’s character, Roland Cassard, is the real heart of Lola. He is the character that I, as the viewer, cared most about and wanted to find happiness. Michel reprised the character in Demy’s later film The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, which I would very much like to see. In the meantime, it’s nice to know that Michel is still in the acting profession.\n\nThe above photo shows Marc Michel in Cracking Up (2004), directed by Christian Lara. Lara also directed Summer in Provence, a recently completed film starring Michel, who will turn 80 in December.\n\nWhile I did not love everything about Lola, there were many things about it that I appreciated. Photographed in beautiful black-and-white by Raoul Coutard – who shot films by Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut and Costa-Gavras, among others – everything about Lola looks artful. I will certainly try to see more films by Jacques Demy and/or films starring Anouk Aimée or Marc Michel."
