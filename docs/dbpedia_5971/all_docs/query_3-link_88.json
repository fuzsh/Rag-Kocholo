        "text": "From \"Splendor in the Grass\" to \"Endless Love,\" Hollywood has always found it difficult to portray teen-age passion in a way that isn't saccharine or condescending. If \"Mad Love\" does a better job than many Hollywood movies at maintaining a level-headed psychological credibility, this story of young lovers who impulsively flee their middle-class backgrounds still comes hazed in a thick romantic mist.\n\nPaula Milne's screenplay is essentially a modern variation of a standard \"nice boy meets bad girl\" scenario, retooled for the age of therapy and infused with feminist understanding. Casey Roberts (Drew Barrymore), the wild girl with whom Matt Leland (Chris O'Donnell), a straight-arrow student, becomes intoxicated, isn't really bad; she's manic-depressive.\n\nWhen Matt and Casey meet, they are fellow students in a posh Seattle high school. He first notices her while she is is angrily kicking the back of her Volkswagen Beetle. As Matt soon comes to discover, this tantrum is only a mild indication of Casey's volatility. The seriousness of her problem begins to be apparent when she breaks a fire alarm at school to get his attention while he is taking his college board exams.\n\nAfter a fight with her bullying father, Casey attempts suicide and is put in a mental hospital. Matt helps her escape, and after camping out in a redwood forest for a couple of days, the pair head toward the Mexican border. Before their adventure ends, they have wrecked one car, stolen another and come into possession of a gun.\n\nMatt, whom Mr. O'Donnell portrays with a steady, understated gravity, is the sort of angelic youth who used to be played by a moist-eyed Robbie Benson. Growing up in a single-parent household with a workaholic father, he is an A student and a devoted, even-tempered caretaker for his younger brother and sister, 9-year-old twins who are just too cute for words.\n\nIn the much showier role of Casey, Ms. Barrymore is just as understated, and this restraint lends her portrayal of a dangerously flaming creature a layer of poignancy. The charismatic young actress with bee-stung lips and a reckless gleam in her eye plays Casey not for badness but for sadness. Her acts of bravado are clearly the desperate gestures of someone fending off inner demons, although the movie is unnecessarily coy about revealing the nature of her mental illness.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
