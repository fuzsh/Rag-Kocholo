        "text": "The 20th Tallgrass Film Festival\n\nPresented By ARCHER HOTELS\n\n(September 28-October 2)\n\nAnnounces Ravi Kapoor’s FOUR SAMOSAS and Matthew Eskey’s THE MOJO MANIFESTO: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF MOJO NIXON double up as the Opening Night Gala selections\n\n20th Anniversary highlights include musical performances by Mojo Nixon and the Toadliquors, The Embarrassment, a work-in-progress screening by Kansas-based Academy Award-winner Kevin Willmott, Ad Astra Award presentation to Troma legend Lloyd Kaufman and more!\n\nWichita, KS (August 29, 2022) – The Tallgrass Film Festival announced this year’s film lineup celebrating its 20th Anniversary on September 28-October 2. Ravi Kapoor’s Four Samosas will be the Opening Night Gala selection, joining the previously announced gala presentations, which include the world premiere of Daniel Fetherston and Danny Szlauderbach’s, We Were Famous, You Don’t Remember: The Embarrassment, Bryan Darling and Jesse Finley Reed’s All Man: The International Male Story, Bradford Thomason and Brett Whitcomb’s Butterfly in the Sky, and Camille Hardman and Gary Lane’s Still Working 9 to 5. Troma Films legend Lloyd Kaufman will receive the festival’s Ad Astra Award, also previously announced.\n\nTallgrass FF’s lineup includes 53 features and 14 short film programs with 195 films, highlighted by the film festival’s signature Stubbornly Independent, Female Filmmakers, and Gordon Parks competitions. The 20th Anniversary celebration will also include a return visit and salute to Tallgrass Film Festival’s former Executive Director Lela Meadow Conner, film programmer Eric Moore, and a special work-in-progress screening from Academy Award-winner Kevin Willmott.\n\nTallgrass FF program director Andre Seward said, “This edition of Tallgrass will be one to remember for sure. We say the same thing every year: this year’s films are the best we’ve seen. There is no doubt that it is true for this year as well. I am very proud to be able to present the line-up that we have for our 20th anniversary. The wide range of genres and styles will give everyone a chance to find something to fall in love with during the festival.”\n\nTallgrass FF Executive Director Melanie Addington added, “The films selected this year embrace the same stubbornly independent spirit as Tallgrass, from freedom of speech fighters to almost famous indie musicians. The best part is that many of the directors, actors, documentary participants, and musicians will be coming to Wichita with those films and will be joining amazing film personalities like Lloyd Kaufman, Kansas favorites like Kevin Willmott and The Embarrassment, as well as our beloved Lela Meadow Conner and Eric Moore, to make this a true extended Anniversary party for film lovers here in Wichita.”\n\nThursday, September 29, Kapoor’s Four Samosas will make its Kansas premiere as the Opening Night selection. The comedy follows the exploits of a wannabe rapper and his crew, who concoct a brilliant plan to steal her dowry of family jewels to disrupt her wedding and make a fortune in the process. Also making its Kansas Premiere is Matthew Eskey’s The Mojo Manifesto: The Life and Times of Mojo Nixon, which follows the origin story of the enigmatic rocker Mojo Nixon tracing the musical journey, including the touring, the record deal, college radio airplay, and MTV exposure that lead to unexpected mainstream success. Kapoor and star Venk Potula will attend and participate in a Q&A after the Four Samosas screening, and Mojo Nixon and the Toadliquors will play at the Opening Night Gala after party.\n\nAs previously announced, Friday, September 30, Tallgrass will host a Double Gala event with the world premiere of Daniel Fetherston and Danny Szlauderbach’s documentary We Were Famous, You Don’t Remember: The Embarrassment and Bryan Darling and Jesse Finley Reed’s documentary All Man: The International Male Story. We Were Famous; You Don’t Remember: The Embarrassment is the highly anticipated film about the Kansas band The Embarrassment, which scored an intensely loyal following in Wichita and beyond while not quite courting mainstream success. The presentation of the film will include a reunion concert of the band’s members, including a post-screening concert at the after-party. In recognition of the All Man presentation, RMI will present Wichita Male Models at the after-party.\n\nBradford Thomason and Brett Whitcomb’s Butterfly in the Sky will be the Centerpiece Gala selection following the Filmmaker Awards presentations, Camille Hardman and Gary Lane’s Still Working 9 to 5. Butterfly in the Sky looks at the history and influence of the beloved “Reading Rainbow!” series by one of the most adored television hosts of all time, LeVar Burton. Camille Hardman and Gary Lane’s Still Working 9 to 5 focuses on the cultural zeitgeist, one of the highest-grossing comedies of all time 9 to 5.\n\nAs part of its salute to Ad Astra Award honoree Lloyd Kaufman and Troma, along with the film festival’s traditional “Conversation on Film” it hosts with Ad Astra honorees, Tallgrass will be screening his cult classic, The Toxic Avenger (1984), Poultrygeist (2006), as well as his latest film, #ShakespearesShitstorm (2020) which naturally involves a mad scientist and his blind daughter on the run from evil pharmaceutical execs, and how he seeks to wreak vengeance upon them by feeding mass amounts of laxatives to whales, among other things.\n\nTallgrass FF’s three signature competition categories (Stubbornly Independent, Female Filmmaker, and Gordon Parks) will each bring grand prizes of $5000 this year.\n\nThe Stubbornly Independent Competition (for domestic narrative features made for under $750,000) includes HP Mendoza’s Attack, Decay, Release, a sci-fi musical chronicling a human migration following decimation from a pandemic. The Svane Family Foundation for ARK commissioned the film, a collection of 100 art pieces interpreting the narrative of Noah’s Ark. Anna Baumgarten’s Disfluency, about a formerly promising young female academic piecing together the trauma that caused her to leave school short of graduation looks. Daniel Yoon’s micro-budget comedy/drama East Bay follows a Korean American man who “throws in the towel” at age 39, deciding there is no point in trying to be happy and successful since we’re all probably living in a simulation anyway. Though the film is just being released, it features Crazy Rich Asians star Constance Wu in her first film role.\n\nAmong the Female Filmmaker Competition films is Nicole Mejia’s A Place In The Field. The film follows a veteran who receives a package and special request from a friend he served with, setting him off on a cross-country journey to fulfill a promise made while in combat. Jordan Danger’s dramedy God Save the Queens focuses on four Drag Queens finding common ground and more at a therapy retreat which requires each of them to relive past traumas in glorious detail. Erin Bernhardt and Din Blankenship’s Refuge looks at a white nationalist leader and former veteran who is forced to confront his hatred for Muslims when he receives an unexpected text from a Muslim refugee and heart doctor who needs his help.\n\nThe Gordon Parks Competition for Black Excellence in Filmmaking includes Jon-Sesrie Goff’s After Sherman. In the film, Goff’s exploration of coastal South Carolina as a site of pride and racial trauma is interrupted by the tragic and shocking shootings at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Kofi Ofosu-Yeboah’s Amansa Tiafi (Public Toilet Africa) follows a woman’s quest to pay an old debt by returning to the place where she was gifted to a white art collector as a little girl. Making its world premiere will be Damon Jamal Taylor’s Black Daddy: The Movie, a captivating look at the experience of fatherhood by black men.\n\nAdditional highlights include a special work-in-progress screening of Academy Award-winning screenwriter Kevin Willmott’s directorial effort No Place Like Home: The Struggle Against Hate in Kansas. Taking its cue from C.J. Janovy’s book No Place Like Home: Lessons in Activism in LGBT Kansas, the film takes us on a tour of the deep red state to meet people who have found themselves in a battle for LGBTQ rights in the most unlikely places – including rural Trego County, Salina, and Topeka. Janovy and Willmott will be on hand before the screening for a book signing.\n\nIliana Sosa’s What We Leave Behind is presented in partnership with Array and Tallgrass. The film takes us on a journey with 89-year-old Julián as he takes one last bus ride to El Paso, Texas, to visit his daughters and their children — a long trip he has made without fail every month for decades. Travis Heying and Roy Wenzl’s Emmy-winning documentary Once Was Lost: The 70-Year Search for Chaplain Emil Kapaun. The film looks at the remarkable life story of Kapaun, who was raised on the plains and farm fields of central Kansas, became a catholic priest, and later an Army chaplain whose service led to him posthumously receiving the Medal of Honor in 2013 and even the potential for Sainthood.\n\nFor more information on the Tallgrass Film Festival and to purchase passes and tickets, please go to: https://tallgrassfilm.org/\n\nOpening Night Gala Selection\n\nFour Samosas Kansas Premiere\n\nDirector: Ravi Kapoor | Country: United States; Running Time: 80 min\n\nDetermined to disrupt his ex-girlfriend’s engagement by stealing her dowry, underachieving, wanna-be rapper Vinny and his eccentric neighborhood pals concoct a plan to take her family jewels from a supermarket safe in LA’s “Little India.”\n\nLloyd Kaufman/Troma Films Salute\n\nPoultrygeist (2006)\n\nDirector: Lloyd Kaufman | Country: USA, Running Time: 102 min\n\nWhen the American Chicken Bunker, a military-themed fast-food restaurant, builds its latest chain restaurant on the site of a Native American burial ground, the displaced spirits take revenge on the unsuspecting diners and transform them into chicken zombies.\n\n#ShakespearesShitstorm (2020)\n\nDirector: Lloyd Kaufman | Country: Albania, USA; Running Time: 94 min\n\nMad scientist Prospero runs away with his blind daughter Miranda to Tromaville, hiding from evil pharmaceutical execs, including his sister Antoinette.
