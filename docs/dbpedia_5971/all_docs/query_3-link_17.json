        "text": "this is a wickedly perverse and bold film. i knew i’d be in love when a clenched fist hurled through an icy window with the cast credits scrawled on it. part of the pleasure is purely aesthetic. peter lorre’s bulbous, roaming, yearning eyes. frances drake’s cascading hair and silken dresses. but really it comes down to karl freund’s work as a director. what piqued my interest with watching this film was keeping in mind freund’s work as a cinematographer with german expressionist masterworks like “the last laugh” and “metropolis”. you can see the echoes of this history in the consuming shadows that drape the surfaces and faces of the film. here shadows don’t just consume but flutter, grow, deepen, and…\n\nImpossible?\n\nImpossible.\n\nNapoleon said that word is not French!\n\nLeave it to Peter Lorre to be the iconic bad man with huge pathos. Instead of feeling for the Orlacs and their terrible dilemma we are left feeling bad for and aching with a mad doctor. The reserved yet perverse man struggles with his inner demons at the impasse of unrequited love; stopped cold in his tracks and unable to get out of his own dark corner of loneliness. While decisions are poorly made between characters, Lorre somehow still comes out on top as the hero in a bizarre way, simultaneously the catalyst of the good and bad and what consequences come staggering forth.\n\nKarl Freund nails the gothic horror elements with greasy,…\n\nThere’s a moment where Bald Peter Lorre looks down the eye of the camera and I’m pretty sure I felt him pierce right through nine decades and into my still wavering soul. Captured not unlike a great starlet, in floods of moonlight and soft focus, the great Gregg Toland forces the looming figure of our good doc to really pop against Expressionistic shadows and darkened sets. At once, exemplifying his pain and highlighting a grotesque figure for all to see.\n\nLorre digs deep to pull off this character that is one on hand, bordering on the edge of obsessive, creepy insanity and the other, strangely sympathetic. Menace and pathos all in the same multi-thousand yard stare. We see a man,…\n\nPeter Lorre is the pervert's pervert, the ur-incel - as bald as an egg and dabbed with sweat beads as sticky as morning dew on a blade of grass. He goes to see a play every night to ogle his favorite actress, but this isn't a normal stage production, this play is a horrorshow where the object of his obsession is tied up and tortured. He goes so far as to procure a wax replica of her for his home (alluding to a necrophiliatic tendency??) and by the end he tries to choke her to death with her own hair. If there's ever a such thing as Halloween ever again, I'm going to try to dress like him in the…\n\nHooptober Fest 5.0\n\nFilm 2/46\n\nSix films from before 1970 (1/6)\n\n--\n\nA body horror tale of obsession with a lot of build up for a rather short unsatisfying pay off. Often it's okay if it's all about the journey rather than the destination, but this one seemed to be hinting that the audience was going to get more--more violence, more weirdness, more something, but the conclusion felt comparatively tame.\n\nAt the end I found myself wondering if the film was being limited by an adherence to the source material, or maybe because of the new restrictions that came with implementation of the Hays Code...but from what I can gather the source material is considerably edgier than the film, and…"
