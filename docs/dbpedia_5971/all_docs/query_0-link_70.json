        "text": "I confess, I have a soft spot for intelligent spy/action films. (One of my all-time faves is the addictively rewatchable 1968 classic Where Eagles Dare, starring Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood. I dare you to not enjoy that film! üòâ )\n\nAnother film I highly enjoy is the 1975 film Three Days of the Condor, starring Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway, both in their primes, as well as the always excellent Max von Sydow. It was directed by Sydney Pollack, whose specialty was directing smart, well-acted movies, including They Shoot Horses, Don‚Äôt They? (1969), The Way We Were (1973), Absence of Malice (1981), Tootsie (1983), Out of Africa (1985), and The Firm (1993).\n\nThis film ages surprisingly well, and it‚Äôs almost scary how prevalent and relevant the central mystery still is. I won‚Äôt give it away ‚Äî it‚Äôs the MacGuffin! The only aspect that doesn‚Äôt age that well is the kidnapping-turned-love-story side plot involving the two main stars. This unnecessary subplot also provided the basis of the entire ad campaign for this film, also referenced in the DVD menu. [Insert eye rolls here.]\n\nAlso, this film does NOT include an actual reel librarian. But there are good reasons I‚Äôm including it here on this blog, even though it is technically a Class V film (which means no librarian on screen).\n\nThe film opens on a close-up of a book scanning machine, with rows of books behind a bank of technology. If you thought you were seeing a library ‚Äî complete with librarian wearing glasses ‚Äî you would be forgiven. We also get a peek at book archives a bit later:\n\nAs Joseph Turner (Robert Redford) rides up in a bicycle, there‚Äôs also a close-up of the building‚Äôs sign that reads ‚ÄúAmerican Literary Historical Society.‚Äù So one might reasonably assume now that this a story featuring archivists, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nThe whole building is a front. Literally. It‚Äôs actually a base for CIA agents who analyze books and other materials for codes and terrorist activities. Robert Redford is one of those agents, a researcher, and ‚ÄúCondor‚Äù is his code name. As he later describes his job:\n\nI work for the CIA. I am not a spy. I just read books. We read everything that‚Äôs published in the world, and we feed the plots ‚Äî dirty tricks, codes ‚Äî into a computer. And the computer checks against actual CIA plans and operations. I look for leaks, I look for new ideas. We read adventures and novels and journals. Who‚Äôd invent a job like that?\n\nAnd he is SO GOOD at this job that he uncovers a terrorist organization that unwittingly hits too close to home. This begins a chain reaction that ends up leaving his co-workers dead; by accident, Joseph is ‚Äúliterally out to lunch‚Äù when the assassins hit his workplace. No spoilers ‚Äî all of this happens in the first 15 minutes of the film! For the remaining 100 minutes, Joseph is on the run to both (a) stay alive and (b) find out why he and his co-workers were targeted. Along the way, he kidnaps Kathy (Faye Dunaway), and they eventually end up in bed together. As you do. (See also 2002‚Äôs The Bourne Identity, which is another personal spy/action favorite. But they did the whole female-sidekick-turned-lover angle MUCH better.)\n\nBy the way, while Turner/Condor is out at a neighborhood deli getting lunch orders, we get to listen in on his conversation with the cook and another regular customer:\n\nDeli guy: Hey, Shakespeare. How‚Äôs it going?\n\n[As they converse, Joseph rattles off a few facts about Van Gogh and Mozart.]\n\nAnother guy at the counter interjects: Where am I? The New York Public Library?\n\nDeli guy: Hey, that‚Äôs a very bright man.\n\nOther guy: It‚Äôs very educational. That‚Äôs why I come in here.\n\nWe also ‚Äúlisten in‚Äù on several scenes in which CIA operatives ‚Äî all men, of course, including Cliff Robertson as Higgins and John Houseman as Mr. Wabash ‚Äî discuss the situation. There is suspicion that Condor himself is a double agent. Although their scenes basically serve as exposition, the background info we learn about Joseph Turner/Condor is very interesting, revealing that he is smart, motivated, resourceful, and lucky.\n\n‚ÄúCondor. Researcher, tide pool. Likes to read comic strips.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúTwo years military service. Signal corps. Telephone line and longline Switchboard maintenance, six months overseas. Worked at Bell Labs Communication Research. College on the G.I. Bill.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt expect too many mistakes from his man. True, he does seem rather more interesting than just another of our reader researchers.‚Äù\n\nIn a beginning scene, Turner/Condor solves a mysterious death by referencing a Dick Tracy story. Toward the end discussing another incident, he confesses, ‚ÄúI read about it in a story.‚Äù\n\nIn a scene where the CIA operatives discuss Condor, there‚Äôs this revealing sideline:\n\nCIA agent: Where did he learn evasive moves?\n\nHiggins: He reads.\n\nCIA agent: What the hell does that mean?\n\nHiggins: It means, sir, that he reads everything.\n\nTurner/Condor also earns that Shakespeare moniker, as evidenced by this back-and-forth with Higgins:\n\nHiggins: I‚Äôm not armed.\n\nJoseph: They could be df-ing us if you have a transmitter hidden somewhere in your clothes. What‚Äôs this?\n\nHiggins: DF? You do read everything, don‚Äôt you?\n\nJoseph: This is no goddamned book. Somebody or something is rotten in the company.\n\nThat last line, of course, is a reference to the line ‚ÄúSomething is rotten in the state of Denmark‚Äù from Shakespeare‚Äôs play Hamlet.\n\nThree Days of the Condor also explores themes of the power of mixing both human brain power and technology, although the lines to ‚Äúbook some computer time‚Äù to analyze text elicit a chuckle or two. This is the central theme of several reel librarian films, including the 1957 comedic classic Desk Set. (Hint: It‚Äôs an either/or fallacy, the conflict between humans and computers. You benefit from having BOTH.)\n\nThere are also a few similarities in tone and subject matter with the Cold War drama, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965), starring Richard Burton. In that film, spy Alec Leamus (Burton) pretends to quit the Secret Service and defect to the Communists. As part of his cover as a failed spy, he starts work as a librarian at the Institute of Psychical Research. In Three Days of the Condor, Joseph Turner pretends to work as a literary society archivist, but is in actuality a CIA agent and researcher. Also, the library in the 1965 film is real ‚Äî we meet other librarians ‚Äî but in the 1975 spy film, the literary society is fake.\n\nAll in all, there is much to appreciate in Three Days of the Condor (1975), a highly intelligent and engaging spy thriller. Too bad there isn‚Äôt an actual reel librarian, but I think we can all agree that Joseph Turner would have been an EXCELLENT librarian if he had so chosen to be, yes?\n\nAnd I will leave you with shots of Robert Redford in his prime, wearing glasses and a shirt unbuttoned to his chest.\n\nYou‚Äôre welcome. üòâ\n\nSources used:\n\nThree Days of the Condor. Dir. Sydney Pollack. Perf. Robert Redford, Faye Dunaway, Cliff Robertson, Max von Sydow. Paramount Pictures, 1975.\n\nThere are many kinds of librarians in both the real and reel world, including school librarians (also called ‚Äúteacher librarians‚Äù or ‚Äúlibrary media specialists‚Äù); academic librarians (who work in college/university libraries); public librarians; archivists; and special librarians (who work in different kinds of libraries, like those in businesses or government offices), among others.\n\nI thought it would be fun to first do a round-up of school librarians. Looking through my Reel Substance lists, a majority of the reel school librarians end up in Classes III and IV, meaning most of them are supporting or minor characters. Also, most of the school librarian characters fulfill the roles of Comic Relief and Information Providers ‚Äî again, no surprise there. This is common of most reel librarian roles.\n\nClass II:\n\nThis category includes reel librarians who are major characters, but their profession does not directly affect the plot. It‚Äôs interesting to note that all three in this category are actually student library workers at their school libraries.\n\nMy Science Project (1985):\n\nRaphael Sbarge plays Sherman, the school nerd and know-it-all who works in the school library. He ends up being a Liberated Librarian.\n\nPump Up the Volume (1992):\n\nStudent library assistant, Nora (played by Samantha Mathis), investigates the new high school student‚Äôs identity through the books he checks out. Nora is a cool character and fulfills the role of a Spirited Young Girl.\n\nScent of a Woman (1992):\n\nThis coming-of-age story features a young prep school boy (Chris O‚ÄôDonnell) and an alcoholic blind man (Al Pacino). O‚ÄôDonnell is a student library assistant at a private prep school and is another Liberated Librarian.\n\nClass III:\n\nThis category includes supporting, minor characters, and includes a mix of Comic Relief, Spinsters, and Information Providers.\n\nBig Bully (1996):\n\nIn this comedy, a writer (Rick Moranis) returns to his Minnesota hometown to teach a creative writing course to middle schoolers. On his first day, he revisits the school library and encounters Mrs. Rumpert, who remembers the book he never returned to the school library. This crude, stereotypical portrayal serves as Comic Relief.\n\nChristine (1983):\n\nIn this horror film, a teenager tries to talk to a pretty girl in the school library ‚Äî and incurs the wrath of the middle-aged school librarian, a Spinster Librarian.\n\nThe Last American Virgin (1982):\n\nThis quintessential ‚Äô80s flick includes a brief ‚Äî but memorable ‚Äî fight in the school library. The school librarian serves as both an Information Provider and a Spinster Librarian.\n\nYou can more priceless reaction shots of this school librarian in my analysis post here.\n\nThe Neverending Story III: Escape from Fantasia (1994):\n\nSchool bullies steal a book that functions as the portal between worlds, and a young boy must find the book. In the opening scene, the boy hides from the bullies in the school library. Freddie Jones plays Mr. Koreander, the school librarian and typical Information Provider.\n\nThe New Guy (2002):\n\nThis film features a memorable opening scene, with perhaps the most crass behavior from a reel librarian! Justine Johnston plays school librarian Mrs. Whitman, who gets all handsy in her memorable Comic Relief role.\n\nRead my analysis post of this film in this post.\n\nYou can also read what goes into an analysis post, which features the steps of creating the post about The New Guy.\n\nPrimary Colors (1998):\n\nIn this fictionalized account of Bill Clinton‚Äôs presidential candidacy, the film begins with a visit to an urban school and an introduction to a ‚Äúvery special librarian,‚Äù Miss Walsh, a klutzy but dedicated teacher and school librarian.\n\nAllison Janney plays the school librarian and fulfills the role of both Comic Relief and Information Provider.\n\nThe Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1969):\n\nThis classic, award-winning film features a scene in the school library, in which a stern school librarian kicks two girls out of the library for making too much noise.\n\nMemorable quote: ‚ÄúThis is a library, not a fun fair!‚Äù\n\nThe Substitute (1996):\n\nEx-marine John Shale (Tom Berenger) goes undercover as a high school substitute teacher in order to investigate a gang. The middle-aged librarian has her own ‚ÄúLiberated Librarian‚Äù moment and stands up to the hoodlums, who start a shoot-out with John in the school library.\n\nUp the Down Staircase (1967):\n\nThe school librarian in this film, the aptly named ‚ÄúMiss Wolf,‚Äù appears in several short scenes as the school librarian at a tough, inner-city high school. Not a flattering portrayal of a Spinster Librarian/Comic Relief reel librarian.\n\nClass IV:\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man (2012):\n\nIn this reboot of Spider-Man, creator Stan Lee camps it up in a librarian cameo. Definitely a memorable Comic Relief role!\n\nYou can read my first impressions post of the film here.\n\nCarrie (TV, 2002):\n\nThis TV remake has a few scenes set in the school library, and a school librarian can be glimpsed in the background. She serves as an Information Provider.\n\nRead my analysis post of this TV movie here in this post.\n\nDangerous Minds (1995):\n\nAn ex-Marine (Michelle Pfeiffer) struggles to connect with her students in an inner city high school. There is one scene set in the school library, and you can glimpse two school librarians in the background, more Information Providers who help set the school library scene.\n\nHigh School High (1996):\n\nIn this parody of films like Dangerous Minds (see above), a na√Øve teacher (Jon Lovitz) gets a job at a high school in the ‚Äòhood ‚Äî and gets heckled by a mean-girl school librarian.\n\nKiller Movie (2008):\n\nAnother parody, this one of school slasher flicks, this film features one scene in a school library ‚Äî and a memorable shot of a scary-looking school librarian. If looks could kill.\n\nClick here to read my analysis post of Killer Movie.\n\nMad Love (1995):\n\nHigh-schoolers Matt (Chris O‚ÄôDonnell) and Casey (Drew Barrymore) fall in love and flee on a road trip. The nosy school librarian, an Information Provider, rats out Casey‚Äôs bad-girl behavior.\n\nMy Bodyguard (1980):\n\nA new kid hires the school outcast to protect him against a school bully. There‚Äôs a brief scene in the school library, and the school librarian provides background to the setting.\n\nWherefore art thou, Giles?\n\nIf you‚Äôre wondering about a big hole on this list, as it does not feature Giles ‚Äî the famous Giles ‚Äî on the TV series Buffy, the Vampire Slayer (1997-2003). It‚Äôs because he‚Äôs a main character on a long-running TV series, rather than in a film or TV movie. But fear not, you can read more about my post on the first episode of the long-running TV series by clicking here.\n\nSources used:\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man. Dir. Marc Webb. Perf.

Warner Bros., 1967.\n\nA couple of years ago, when I started this blog, I received a reader comment adding the TV movie The Color of Magic (2008) to my Master List. The TV movie is adapted from two of Terry Pratchett‚Äôs books, the 1983 work of the same name (although it is spelled in the English way, The Colour of Magic, the first in his famous Discworld series) and the second book in the series, The Light Fantastic. About a year ago, a work colleague recommended Terry Pratchett‚Äôs book Men at Arms to me, as it is another book in the series that features the librarian character. I haven‚Äôt read The Colour of Magic yet, but I did enjoy Men at Arms, especially Pratchett‚Äôs sense of humor. So when on a recent trip to the public library I spied a DVD of The Color of Magic, I checked it out.\n\nI had been warned that this TV movie was bad ‚Äî even my work colleague, who loves the Discworld series, said it wasn‚Äôt very good. It is overlong, as it was conceived and developed as a two-parter. It‚Äôs also very cheesy in execution and special effects. Where the tone of the books is funny and whimsical, the movie feels silly and belabored; the filmsuffers from a lack of charm that is evident in Terry Pratchett‚Äôs writing. So, yes, this was another instance in which I watched this film so YOU DON‚ÄôT HAVE TO. üòâ\n\nI also did not understand the general plot ‚Äî this TV movie suffers from too.much.plot. ‚Äî until I read this very detailed synopsis entry of the film in the Discworld Wiki site. This entry is SO detailed, but if you are unfamiliar with the Discworld books, suffice to say that (SPOILER ALERTS):\n\nThe Octavo is the greatest of all spell books and very dangerous, and it lives in the cellars of Unseen University.\n\nWizards keep killing ‚Äî or attempting to kill ‚Äî each other, because that‚Äôs what wizards do.\n\nTim Curry plays an evil-minded wizard named Trymon (no big casting stretch there) and wants to rule with help from the Octavo‚Äôs spells.\n\nOne wizard, Rincewind (played by David Jason), is the worst of the wizards because he can‚Äôt remember any basic spells or even to show up on time to wizard meetings.\n\nRincewind is therefore expelled at the beginning of the movie, which wreaks havoc because his mind inadvertently contains a spell from the Octavo. (This is also why he‚Äôs the worst wizard and can‚Äôt remember any other spells.)\n\nSean Astin ambles cluelessly through the movie as Twoflower, a rich tourist who hires Rincewind as his guide. They go on adventures outside the city but eventually come back for the final showdown against Trymon.\n\nThe Head Librarian starts out in human form‚Ä¶ and then gets turned into an orangutan. Yes, an orangutan. Even in primate form, he continues to be Head Librarian of Unseen University.\n\nThe Librarian is played in human form by Nicholas Tennant, and in ‚ÄúOrang Utan‚Äù form by actor Richard da Costa, who also plays the Luggage. (That is a very strange sentence to write.)\n\nBooks also lead other, secret lives in the L-Space in the Discworld series ‚Äî and as a member of the Librarians of Time and Space, the Librarian of Unseen University has an understanding of L-Space and its powers. It is no wonder that this TV movie highlights the Octavo, as Brian Cox (!) narrates that the ‚Äúgreatest of all spell books, locked and chained deep in the cellars of the Unseen University, the spells imprisoned in its pages lead a secret life of their own. And Rincewind‚Äôs departure ‚Ä¶ has left them deeply troubled‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nThe next scene involves the Head Librarian, deep in conversation with the Arch Chancellor. The Head Librarian reveals a lot of plot in this scene ‚Äî and indeed, provides plot details throughout to several characters ‚Äî so his primary role in this TV movie is that of an Information Provider.\n\nThe Librarian also reflects the fear others have of Trymon, who is power-hungry and trying to bump off any wizard in his way to the ‚Äúroom at the top.‚Äù\n\nLibrarian: ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just glad he doesn‚Äôt want to be Head Librarian.\n\nTrymon [who‚Äôs been eavesdropping and bursts into the room]: Perish the thought, Horace. And I am looking for a book.\n\nThe next shot reveals the Unseen University Library in all its dusty, disorganized glory. The Librarian retrieves the book Room at the Top: How to Succeed at Wizardry! (first chapter: ‚ÄúKnife in the Back‚Äù) for Trymon and continues the theme of the previous conversation.\n\nLibrarian: The position of Head Librarian isn‚Äôt one that really appeals to you, sir?\n\nTrymon: No. [smirks]\n\nLibrarian: Oh, good.\n\nTrymon: It is quite possible that the next Arch Chancellor may well smile upon those who understand the importance of things being well organized.\n\nA rumbling, creaking sound from the cellars ‚Äî the groans of the Octavo ‚Äî interrupt this conversation.\n\nTrymon: Is everything in order down there?\n\nLibrarian: Oh, yes, absolutely. Everything is in alphabetical order, in fact.\n\nGROAN.\n\nThe Librarian, at least while in human form, comes off as quite cowardly and sniveling. He reacts in fear, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an accident that camera angles play up his diminutive form. (For more on the Librarian character in the books, click here.)\n\nIn fact, I grew so tired of the Librarian cowering in and around Trymon ‚Äî all the while supplying him with the information he needed to move forward with his evil plan ‚Äî that almost halfway through the TV movie, I shouted out, ‚ÄúI am SO READY for the Librarian to turn into an orangutan!‚Äù And, yes, that is another strange sentence to say out loud and write.\n\nThe movie complied, as at the end of the first half, the Librarian gets accidentally gets turned into a primate by a spell released by the Octavo. The Arch Chancellor and the other wizard rush to the library, to be greeted with the Librarian sitting on his desk. Not at his desk, but ON his desk.\n\nEven if I hadn‚Äôt know the Librarian got turned into an orangutan ‚Äî he‚Äôs already in his primate form in Men at Arms ‚Äî I could have guessed where the plot was going, based on the number of bad puns he slips in before the accident:\n\nBetter not monkey around with it [the Octavo], or who knows what will happen.\n\nIt‚Äôs the Octavo. It‚Äôs going really ape.\n\nI was relieved that after he got turned into an orangutan, his vocabulary became limited to variations of ‚ÄúOoook!‚Äù\n\nThe Librarian does not have as many scenes in the second half of the TV movie, but he does help Trymon find another book in the library. Trymon threatens him and also gives him a banana for his troubles (‚Äúit‚Äôs not as if bananas grow on trees‚Äù) ‚Äî which proves to be his own downfall. Literally.\n\nAt the end of the film, Trymon holds all the spells but the final spell in the Octavo and is engaged in a battle with Rincewind and the bumbling tourist, Twoflower, at the top of the tower. The camera then cuts to a close-up of the Librarian with a banana in his mouth (oook?), and then we get a lovely wide shot of the tower in silhouette. And who in the world would be able to scale a tower like this‚Ä¶ but an orangutan librarian?!\n\nAnd that banana? Well, a banana peel just HAPPENS to find its way underneath Trymon‚Äôs foot as he prepares to send one final spell toward Rincewind. Trymon is then blasted by his own ricocheted spell!\n\nAlthough Rincewind gets all the glory, it‚Äôs the Librarian who actually ended up saving the day! (Typical.) At the end, as Rincewind and Twoflower make their way out of the tower, the Librarian drops over the side of the wall and toward Rincewind. (Apparently, Richard da Costa studied real orangutans in a zoo to learn how they moved ‚Äî not that it helped.) Rincewind hands the Librarian a banana and tells him to ‚ÄúGo on, you sort this all out.‚Äù\n\nI think HE ALREADY DID. Ungrateful wizard. Ooook, indeed.\n\nThe Head Librarian is a minor character who appears in short scenes throughout The Color of Magic (2008), and therefore winds up in the Class III category of reel librarians. I‚Äôve already mentioned how he fulfilled the role of Information Provider, and considering the bad puns and overly crude portrayals ‚Äî both in human and ape form ‚Äî he also serves as Comic Relief. We are definitely laughing AT him, even if that laughter could be characterized as nervous laughter. Plus, his last trick with the banana peel is the oldest, broadest slapstick humor there is, right?\n\nUntil next week ‚Ä¶ and make sure you look where you step! And be nice to librarians while you‚Äôre at it. Bananas optional. üòâ\n\nSources used:\n\nThe Color of Magic (aka The Colour of Magic, TV movie). Dir. Vadim Jean. Perf.

The Time Traveler‚Äôs Wife (2009) is a romantic drama based on the best-selling 2003 novel by Audrey Niffenegger. The love story between Henry, a time-traveling librarian (played by Eric Bana) and Clare, an artist (played by Rachel McAdams) provides the central plot, as the film jumps back and forth in time, mirroring Henry‚Äôs travels. The two actors do all they can to provide gravitas and chemistry to the movie, but the tone and execution do end up feeling a little heavy-handed.\n\nAny kind of time-traveling-themed film involves its own brand of suspension of disbelief, as the audience has to accept somewhat circular logic and avoidance of plot holes (see also The Lake House and Premonition for other recent examples). This kind of story works better in print, and I did read the book years ago to see if Henry was a librarian in the book (he is). What‚Äôs intriguing about this variation on time travel is that Henry can‚Äôt choose when he travels back in time, and this brings on a whole host of problems and relationship instability.\n\n*POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERTS*\n\nHenry doesn‚Äôt get to keep his clothes when he travels, so most of his time spent time-traveling seems to involve breaking into places to find clothes, only to leave yet another pile of clothes as he disappears again. Also, Henry is older when he goes back in time to meet Clare, who is 6 years old when they meet for the first time on Clare‚Äôs timeline (incidentally, Henry is also 6 years old when he first travels through time). A 6-year-old girl and a 30-something-year-old man who later marry? Yeah, the creep factor is always there.\n\nFor a romantic hero, Henry is also unusual, because he often has to resort to petty theft, lock-picking, and sometimes back-alley brawls during his travels. (At one point, he also uses his abilities to win the lottery. Personal morality and ethics take a slip when one slips in and out of time.)\n\nIt‚Äôs hard out there for a time-traveling librarian. üòâ\n\nThe two library scenes come fast and furious, both occurring within the first five minutes of the film. Three-and-a-half minutes in, we get our first shot of the library archives, as Henry travels back to his present (naked and shivering and emotionally drained). Henry wearily puts on his clothes, which are in a bundle on the library floor.\n\nAfter a heavy sigh, Henry then bends down to pick up rare books in a pile on the floor, affording us a close-up of his shoes. (Visuals of shoes feature heavily in this film, and a close-up of shoes in a field also graced the book‚Äôs cover.) Next, we see Henry bringing the stack of books to a patron in the library.\n\nPatron: That took you long enough.\n\nHenry: You have no idea.\n\nContrast that with the next scene, which brings sunshine and spring into the storyline. We also learn that Henry lives in Chicago. We get another wide shot of the library, this time bathed in sunlight and warm tones. The difference? This is when he first meets Clare, and they ‚Äúmeet cute‚Äù (or rather, ‚Äúmeet awkward‚Äù) in the library. Before Clare, his entire world ‚Äî including his work world ‚Äî feels cold and dark. With Clare, his world brightens ‚Äî literally.\n\nFun fact: Although the library is not named, these scenes were filmed in the Newberry Library in Chicago. This is also the library where Henry works in the book.\n\nIn this scene, we also get treated to another librarian, a young, red-haired woman perched in the stacks with a book cart in front of her. She looks quite professional ‚Äî much more professional-looking than Henry ‚Äî and is wearing a pin-striped Oxford blouse and a suit vest. This librarian is a typical Information Provider.\n\nClare: Excuse me. I‚Äôm looking for something on papermaking at Kelmscott.\n\nLibrarian: Our special collections librarian can help you with that. [She raises her voice to get Henry‚Äôs attention, who looks over at them.]\n\nHenry: Can I help you?\n\nClare: Henry? [Claire recognizes him, but he doesn‚Äôt seem to recognize her.]\n\nHenry: Yes?\n\nClare: Henry. It‚Äôs you. You told me this would happen. I‚Äôm supposed to act normal, but I‚Äôm not really acting very normal.\n\nHere‚Äôs Henry‚Äôs reaction to Clare‚Äôs recognition of himself. Awwwwwwwwkward.\n\nLong story short, Henry agrees to meet up with Clare. Boy meets girl. Boy disappears. Girl has to clean up the mess. You know, the same old story. üòâ\n\nAlthough there are no more physical scenes of the library, there are a couple more mentions of his profession:\n\n21 minutes in, Clare introduces Henry to her friends Gomez and Charisse. Gomez isn‚Äôt favorably impressed at first, saying, ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt get anything out of him except he‚Äôs a research librarian.‚Äù\n\n25 minutes in, Gomez goes straight to Clare after learning Henry‚Äôs time-traveling secret. Gomez asks if Henry‚Äôs around, and she responds, ‚ÄúNo, he‚Äôs at the library.‚Äù\n\nTruthfully, it is not important to the plot that Henry is a librarian ‚Äî except that it allows him to time travel, which IS the plot ‚Äî so this film winds up in the Class II category. However, because of the extensive scenes we get to see of Henry outside of the library, and the personality flaws we witness, I would argue he fills an atypical role for reel librarians. Henry‚Äôs personality is atypical of most romantic heroes, full stop, and his role as a reel librarian is also secondary to the central romantic drama. It is also atypical to highlight a reel librarian, male or female, who is quite physically active and fit. (See also Rene Russo‚Äôs character in the 1989 comedy Major League). Henry is fit out of necessity, in order to survive while time-traveling.\n\nThe filmmakers are also not afraid to be critical of the lead romantic hero. Twice, Henry describes himself as a ‚Äúpain in the ass.‚Äù\n\nOne could also argue that Henry‚Äôs role is that of a librarian as failure; that character type consists of self-perceived ‚Äúfailures‚Äù who resort to working in a library. And Henry did choose to be a librarian when he was younger and felt lost and unhappy ‚Äî before he had met Clare, and before he scientifically explored his condition. However, the ‚Äúlibrarian as failure‚Äù character type primarily fills the purpose of reflecting flaws in a library, or other social system or construct; this character type is also very closely tied to the library. In this film, the library is just an excuse.\n\nAlthough Henry‚Äôs occupation actually does make it to the back of the DVD case (‚Äú‚Ä¶ a handsome librarian who travels involuntarily through time‚Äù), like I said, it‚Äôs not really that important that he‚Äôs a librarian.\n\nHis occupation is only important because it provides him a way to make a living that, well, doesn‚Äôt get in the way of his time-traveling. His job, that of a special collections or archives librarian, affords him time to spend in the archives, alone, so that no one really notices when he‚Äôs gone. (Even when he‚Äôs gone for two weeks straight, we don‚Äôt hear anything about how that affects his work.)\n\nHow‚Äôs that for an endorsement for librarianship? Be a librarian so that NO ONE will notice if you‚Äôre even there or not. SIGH.\n\nThis film attempts to end as a testament to true love and how it can stand the test of time. But there is no such love for the library. Because once Henry wins the lottery ‚Äî surprise, surprise ‚Äî there is no more mention of the library. Who would continue to work in a library when there‚Äôs no need to work anymore?\n\nOn that cheerful note, I bid you farewell‚Ä¶ but you can count on me that I‚Äôll be back next week, same time, same place. üòâ\n\nSources used:\n\nThe Time Traveler‚Äôs Wife.
