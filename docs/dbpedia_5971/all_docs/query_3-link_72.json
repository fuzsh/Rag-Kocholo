In Laredo, Spain, in 1496, a fleet sets sail for Flanders to carry Princess Juana to the Brussels court where she is to wed the monarch later known as Felipe the Handsome. Sparks fly at their first meeting; their mutual attraction eases political obligations. Soon the deaths of her brother, sister and mother leave Juana the Queen of Castile and heir to the crown of Aragon. Though her marriage is changing, Felipe is fickle and prone to affairs, reasons of state prevail and their return to Spain is clamorous. The politically ambitious Felipe, however, plots to usurp her throne. His Flemish experts advise him to have Juana declared \"mad.\" But he underestimates her, as she will not abandon her crown, her people, or her beloved husband without a fight.",

Mad Love has all that and more.\n\nOctober 31, 2018\n\ndwells on questions of Joan's madness to the point of exhaustion\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nA sumptuously-appointed account of the life of the 16th-century Spanish royal Joan of Castile.\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nA chick flick of the first order, disguised by just enough historical detail to elevate the proceedings somewhat.\n\nJune 17, 2017\n\nNothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows.\n\nJune 17, 2017\n\nAranda's screenplay and direction are rather shallow, so that this bodice-ripper feels more like a Lifetime made-for-cable movie than an epic, tragic romance.\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nAccuracy and realism are terrific, but if your film becomes boring, and your dialogue isn't smart, then you need to use more poetic license.\n\nJune 17, 2017"
