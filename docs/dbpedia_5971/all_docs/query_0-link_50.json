        "text": "THE FRENCH MOVIE INDUSTRY has good reason for feeling the blues. For all the intravenous feeding it receives from the French treasury, for all its claims to be Europe's last surviving movie industry, fewer French went to see its films (and more went to see American ones) last year than ever before. Clearly, living off its past no longer suffices. Francois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Eric Rohmer and other directors who created the New Wave 35 years ago mean little to today's audiences. And no fresh wave of talent has taken their place.\n\nYet one French film has unexpectedly brought some cheer this year. For most of March, \"Gazon Maudit,\" or \"Bushwhacked,\" was No. 1 at the box office, beating out such American rivals as \"Disclosure,\" \"Stargate\" and \"Immortal Beloved.\" It is a comedy about a love triangle (ah, another French love triangle), albeit this time between a man, a heterosexual woman and a lesbian. What makes the film noteworthy is that it was written by and directed by a woman. So is it women that French cinema has been waiting for?\n\nFrench films, of course, have never failed to put on a pretty face -- whether it was Anouk Aimee, Brigitte Bardot or Jeanne Moreau in the early 1960's or Emmanuelle Beart, Juliette Binoche, Isabelle Adjani or Sophie Marceau today. But calling the shots off-camera was different. Back in the New Wave days, Agnes Varda was the exception that proved the rule. She made a number of successful films, not least \"Cleo From 5 to 7,\" but she was never left in doubt that directing was considered a man's business.\n\nAs recently as the 1980's, when Diane Kurys, Claire Denis, Aline Isserman and Chantal Ackerman were making low-budget movies in France, the rule still held. The big-name French directors -- Claude Berri, Bertrand Tavernier, Alain Corneau and the like -- were almost all male. Only Coline Serreau struck gold with \"Three Men and a Cradle,\" remade in the United States as \"Three Men and a Baby.\"\n\nBut now, the films of female French directors are seemingly everywhere, in festivals and theaters both inside and outside France. In New York, for example, Martine Dugowson's \"Mina Tannenbaum\" and Agnes Merlet's \"Son of the Shark\" were released last month. Ms. Varda is still busy at the age of 66, those in their 40's are finding it easier to launch projects, and, most significant, younger French women -- and, in the case of Josiane Belasko, the established actress who made \"Bushwhacked,\" not so young -- are making first and second films that are being noticed and often acclaimed. It is certainly too early to proclaim a new New Wave. It is probably premature to identify a movement. But there is no doubt that a phenomenon exists.\n\nMs. Denis's \"I Can't Sleep,\" Ms. Kurys's \"6 Days, 6 Nights\" and Nelly Kaplan's \"Plaisir d'Amour,\" are due in the United States later this year (Ms. Kurys's film opens on May 6). Five of nine semi-autobiographical films recently commissioned by the French-German cultural television channel, Arte, were by women. Three of the five movies nominated for best first features in this year's Cesars, the French Oscars, were also by women.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
