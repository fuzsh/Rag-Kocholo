        "text": "Media projects delayed for a decade or more\n\nThis article lists notable examples of media projects, including films, music, and video games, that were or have been in development for at least ten years after their first public announcement before release without being officially cancelled, a state known as \"development hell\", or, in the software industry, vaporware.\n\n1906: A film based on the 2004 historical novel was planned as early as when author James Dalessandro was researching 1906 as a prequel to his novel Bohemian Heart and he made a 38-page outline and six chapters of his novel when he found out the success of Titanic.[1] Warner Bros. Pictures had the script sold despite other companies entering in a bidding war.[2] Due to the big budget, Warner Bros. partnered up with Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar and it would have been the first time Pixar has been involved in a live-action film and the first time Pixar collaborated with a major production company other than Disney with Brad Bird directing though eventually he left the project due to working on Ratatouille.[3] Warner Bros. reserved all sound-studios available on their Burbank lot for production.[4] However, later that spring, Warner Bros. quietly released the reservations while Brad Bird continued rewriting the screenplay in order to lessen the massive scope of the story.[5] In 2011, it was reported by Brad Bird that the film project was still being developed. The issues he raised was his difficulty in narrowing the scope of such a manner as to be true to the story within the constraints of practical film length.[6] In February 2012, it was revealed that a rewrite of Dalessandro's script had been completed by Michael Hirst, and Brad Bird was now rewriting it yet again.[7] In June 2018, Bird mentioned the possibility of adapting the book as a TV series and the earthquake sequence as a live-action film.[8]\n\nAkira: Warner Bros. acquired the rights to make a live-action American adaptation of the anime film and its manga of the same name in 2002, and have made a number of attempts to film it.[9] Directors attached to the project since 2002 have included James Cameron, Stephen Norrington, Ruairí Robinson, the Hughes brothers, George Miller, Christopher Nolan, and Jaume Collet-Serra. It was announced in 2019 that filming would be done later that year, in a production produced by Andrew Lazar and Leonardo DiCaprio and directed by Taika Waititi. However, in August of that year, Waititi began work on the Marvel Studios film Thor: Love and Thunder, which once again put filming plans on hold.[10][11]\n\nAlien vs. Predator: Alien vs. Predator was first planned shortly after the 1990 release of Predator 2, to be released sometime in 1993. The production stalled for more than a decade, with frequent actor changes, restarts, and failed promotions of the film until its eventual release in 2004.\n\nAlita: Battle Angel: James Cameron's live-action adaptation of Yukito Kishiro's manga series Battle Angel Alita was in development hell starting in the early 2000s. The project was finally completed under the direction of Robert Rodriguez and released in 2019.[13]\n\nAmerican McGee's Alice: A film adaptation based on the dark fantasy video game that is loosely based on Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was in development prior to the game's release. The crew at Dimension Films were shown footage of the game and were impressed with the visuals. Miramax head, Bob Weinstein supported the film adaptation.[14] On July 5, 2000, FGN Online published an exclusive piece claiming that Electronic Arts had signed an agreement with Miramax to create a film based on the game with American McGee involved in the film's production.[15] Wes Craven and John August were attached as director and screenwriter, with McGee co-producing the film alongside Collision Entertainment, and Abandon Entertainment acting as international distributor.[14] No actors had yet been signed on, but Natalie Portman, Milla Jovovich, and Christina Ricci were rumored to be attached.[14][16] Later on, the film was confirmed to be computer animated with a release date of 2003.[17][18] On March 4, 2004, McGee reported that the project had moved from Dimension Films to 20th Century Fox.[19] On June 21, 2005, The Hollywood Reporter claimed that Universal Pictures had acquired the film and signed Sarah Michelle Gellar on for the lead role with Marcus Nispel attached to direct.[20] Rumors suggested that Jane March was going to be cast as the Queen of Hearts but it was denied.[21] In 2013, McGee wanted to buy back the film rights through Kickstarter. Since 2015, however, McGee said that the feature film had gone on a hiatus.\n\nAtlas Shrugged: Film and later television adaptations of Ayn Rand's novel were in development hell for nearly 40 years[22] before the novel was adapted as the first part of a trilogy in 2011. Part II appeared in 2012, and Part III was released in September 2014, but with three different actresses playing female lead character Dagny Taggart in each part.[23]\n\nAt the Mountains of Madness: Since 2006, Guillermo del Toro and Matthew Robbins wrote a screenplay based on H. P. Lovecraft's story but had trouble getting Warner Bros. to finance the project because Del Toro claimed that the studio was very nervous about the cost and it not having a love story or a happy ending (either of which is impossible to do in a Lovecraft story).[24] In 2010, it was announced to be a 3D film and James Cameron would be a producer while Tom Cruise would star in the film.[25] It was reported that Universal Pictures refused to green light the project due to del Toro wanting an R rating while the heads at Universal wanted a PG-13 rating.[25] Later on, the film was pitched to Netflix after signing a multi-year deal with the streaming service in 2020. The script was rewritten to make it a smaller, weirder, and more esoteric version in respect of the scenes that he has left out before.[26] Del Toro later stated that Tom Cruise feels too old to star in the film.[27] Del Toro also stated that the film could be a stop-motion film.[28]\n\nAtuk: A film adaptation of the novel The Incomparable Atuk. Norman Jewison first purchased the film rights in 1971, and since then there have been several attempts to produce it. One Hollywood legend holds that the project is cursed because of the premature deaths of various actors who expressed an interest in the lead role: John Belushi, Sam Kinison, John Candy, Phil Hartman and Chris Farley.[29]\n\nUntitled fourth Austin Powers film: Since 2005, plans for a fourth film of the Austin Powers series were in discussion but has not been announced since then despite various updates as years went on.[30]\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water: The film was first announced in 2010, aiming for a release by 2014. The timeline has been pushed back a total of 8 times, due to director James Cameron being occupied with other projects, the VFX (visual effects) team working on creating underwater motion capture, and the COVID-19 pandemic affecting production. However, the film was released on December 16, 2022, almost a decade after initial development began, with other sequels in development.[31]\n\nBajirao Mastani: The film was conceived in the 1990s and was finally announced in 2003 but was shelved indefinitely owing to its ever-changing cast. The film was finally revived in 2014 and went immediately in production and was released in December 2015.[32]\n\nBarbie: The idea of a live-action Barbie film had been in development at Cannon Films in the mid-1980s; little is known about it, other than a promotional blurb (with the plotline centering around Barbie showing her owner how all her dreams could come true), and it is unclear how far into development it got before Mattel ceased working with Cannon, following Cannon's live-action adaptation of Masters of the Universe (1987) flopping at the box-office.[33] Development on a film based on the Barbie toy line began in September 2009, when it was announced that Mattel had signed a partnership to develop the project with Universal Pictures and with Laurence Mark as producer, but nothing came to fruition.[34] In April 2014, Mattel teamed with Sony Pictures to produce the film, which would have Jenny Bicks writing the screenplay and Laurie MacDonald and Walter F. Parkes producing through the Parkes+MacDonald Image Nation banner they created. Filming at the time was anticipated to begin by the end of the year.[35] In March 2015, Diablo Cody was brought onto the project to rewrite the screenplay, and Amy Pascal joined the producing team.[36] Sony would again have rewrites done to the screenplay later that year, hiring Lindsey Beer, Bert V. Royal, and Hillary Winston to write separate drafts.[37] In December 2016, Amy Schumer entered negotiations to star in the title role with Winston's screenplay; Schumer helped rewrite the script with her sister, Kim Caramele.[38] In March 2017, Schumer exited negotiations, blaming scheduling conflicts with the planned June 2017 filming start; in 2023 she revealed she left the project due to creative differences with the film's producers at the time.[39][40] That July, Anne Hathaway was under consideration for the title role, with Sony hiring Olivia Milch to rewrite the screenplay and approaching Alethea Jones to direct as a means to interest Hathaway into signing on.[41] Jones was attached to direct until the rights were transferred to Warner Bros. Pictures in October 2018.[42][43] Margot Robbie was cast as the lead in 2019, after Gal Gadot turned down the role due to scheduling conflicts, and Greta Gerwig was announced as co-writer with Noah Baumbach before being confirmed as director in 2021.[44][45] The film was released on July 21, 2023, and it, alongside Oppenheimer, was a major commercial success.\n\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice: In 1990, Tim Burton commissioned a sequel to Beetlejuice called Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian, written by Jonathan Gems.[46] After multiple studio rewrites, in 1997 Gems stated that the film will never be made. In 2011, Warner Bros. hired Seth Grahame-Smith to write and produce a sequel.[47] In 2013, Winona Ryder expressed her interest in the sequel saying, \"I'm kind of sworn to secrecy but it sounds like it might be happening. It's 27 years later.\"[48] In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith said the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming by the end of the year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles.[49] In April 2019, Warner Bros. stated the sequel had been shelved; however, in February 2022, a sequel was announced, produced by Plan B Entertainment with Warner Bros. Pictures. Brad Pitt will serve as a producer, while Keaton and Ryder will reprise their respective roles. Principal photography began in May 2023, for an intended release date of September 6, 2024.[50][51][52]\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F: Since the mid-1990s, the 4th film to the Beverly Hills Cop franchise was being developed yet it was finally given the release date of 2024 via Netflix due to limbo.[53]\n\nBill & Ted Face the Music: An attempt to revive Bill & Ted came to fruition in August 2010 when franchise star Keanu Reeves indicated that a script for a third film was being worked on despite the fact that the character Rufus would not return, because the character's original actor, George Carlin, had died two years prior.[54][55][56] Dean Parisot was attached to direct by August 2012.[57] In March 2013 at the SXSW Film Festival, Alex Winter confirmed progress on the film was still being made.[58][59] In April 2016, Winter told Forbes that they had a script, a director, and a studio, and that they were planning to film by early 2017.[60] Reeves gave an update on the film in February 2017 during an interview on The Graham Norton Show, saying the story was written, and discussing the plot of the film: \"Basically, they're supposed to write a song to save the world, and they haven't done that. The pressure of having to save the world, their marriages are falling apart, their kids are kind of mad at them, and then someone comes from the future and tells them if they don't write the song it's just not the world, it's the universe. So they have to save the universe because time is breaking apart\".[61] During the New York City Comic Convention, Reeves revealed that the title would be Bill & Ted Face the Music.[62] The film was released on August 28, 2020.[63][64]\n\nBioShock: In 2008, it was announced that a film based on the 2K Games video game series was in development and Gore Verbinski got attached to direct yet it was cancelled due to budget concerns and executives not wanting to green lit an R-Rated story due to the failure of the Watchmen film.[65] In 2020, Netflix announced a new BioShock film is in development with Francis Lawrence directing.[66]\n\nThe Black Cauldron: Walt Disney Productions optioned Lloyd Alexander's five-volume book series in 1971, acquired the rights to Alexander's novels The Chronicles of Prydain, and began development of the movie in 1973. The release date was delayed several times. In July 1978, the studio pushed back the release date to Christmas 1984 due to their inability to animate realistic human characters, which caused The Fox and the Hound to be released in 1981. Re-production of The Black Cauldron began in 1980. Shortly before the film's initially planned 1984 theatrical release, a test screening of the rough cut of the film was held at the studio, but was met with negative feedback that claimed it was too intense and disturbing for the majority of the children in the audience, particularly during the climactic 'Cauldron Born' sequence. The newly appointed Disney studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg ordered certain scenes to be removed to calm things down. When producer Joe Hale objected to Katzenberg's demands, Katzenberg responded by taking the film and editing it himself. After Michael Eisner heard from Hale what Katzenberg was doing, he called him in the edit room and convinced him to stop. Though he did what Eisner told him, he requested that the movie should be modified and delayed from Christmas 1984 to July 24, 1985, so that the movie could be reworked. After 14 years of development, the movie was released on July 24, 1985, receiving mixed reviews from critics and becoming a box-office bomb.[citation needed]\n\nBlair Witch 3: A third film in the Blair Witch franchise was in talks since the October 2000 release of Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2. Despite rumors, development did not begin until September 2009 when creators Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez announced a third film in the works from Lionsgate, retconning any events from Book of Shadows. After several scripts were tossed around, Simon Barrett's script was pitched with Adam Wingard announced as director in 2013 under its working title, The Woods. The film—simply under its name, Blair Witch—was released on September 16, 2016, with polarizing reactions from critics and audiences, and was a disappointment at the box office.[citation needed]\n\nThe Bob and Larry Movie: A film adaptation based on the Christian cartoon series VeggieTales was in development since early 2000s. This would have been an origin story of the show hosts Bob the Tomato and Larry the Cucumber which would have revealed how they got their show made and would have explored how the fruit and vegetables were able to talk. This would have featured humans in the film and would've be the first VeggieTales-related media to do so.[67] After the box office bomb of Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie, Big Idea Entertainment fell into bankruptcy and the film got put on a hiatus due to the film's budget. In 2008, it was considered to be the sequel to The Pirates who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie, but talks stalled after the 2008 recession had led to the bankruptcy of VeggieTales owner Entertainment Rights and Classic Media. Series creator Phil Vischer claims that he has a copy of The Bob and Larry Movie on his laptop but can't share it due to being owned by Universal Pictures and DreamWorks Animation.[68] However, Big Idea is facing limbo due to problems going on which led to the departure of some key members of Big Idea thus putting the film in limbo.[69]\n\nBone: A film adaptation of the 1991 comic of the same name was in development since the late 90s with one attempt being under Paramount under the Nickelodeon Movies banner, A later attempt was under Warner Bros. in 2008 with another later attempt in 2016 with Warner Bros. Feature Animation. An animated series by Netflix Animation was announced in 2019,[70] but later cancelled in April 2022.[71]\n\nCall of Duty: Upon the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops III, it was reported that Activision Blizzard launched a studio called Activision Blizzard Studios and have plans for a film adaptation based on first-person shooter game series of the same name.[72] Stefano Sollima was attached to direct the film while Chris Pine and Tom Hardy were considered to be the lead roles for the Call of Duty film.[73] The plot of the film would've been described as a real soldier movie and not a war movie.[74] The film was originally going to begin filming in 2019 just to eye for a 2020 or 2021 release.[75] However, Sollima revealed that the film is indefinitely put on hold because it is not Activision's priority.[76]\n\nCaptain Planet and the Planeteers: Multiple attempts have been made to create a film adaptation based on the environmentalist superhero cartoon series. The earliest was in 1996 when it was just simply titled Planet.[77] Years later, Michael Reaves revised the concept as Dark Planet or Planet and it would have had a story much darker than its source material complete with a post-apocalyptic time period but the script was lost when Turner and Warner Bros. merged in 1996.[78] Other attempts were made in 2007,[79] 2011,[80] and 2013,.[81] Later in 2016, Paramount Pictures and Appian Way Productions were attempting to develop a new movie with Glen Powell as the titular superhero.[82] In early 2023, Powell claims that hurdles at Warner Bros. Discovery need to be cleared before moving forward.[83]\n\nCats: A film adaptation of the musical of the same name was in development in the early to mid 90s. As an animated adaptation by Amblimation but was abandoned with the studio's closure.[84] In December 2013, Andrew Lloyd Webber, creator and composer of the musical stage production Cats, teased that Universal Pictures, which had purchased the film rights to Cats many years earlier, was putting the project into active development.[85] In February 2016, it was reported that Tom Hooper was in negotiations to direct the film, and was considering actresses, including Suki Waterhouse, to star.[86] In May 2016, Hooper was confirmed as director.[87] In January 2018, Hooper and Working Title began officially casting for the film, while looking into the technical aspect of whether the film would be entirely live-action or animated, with Lloyd Webber announcing he would be writing a new song for the film adaptation.[88] On 24 October 2019, it was announced that the new song was titled \"Beautiful Ghosts\", written by Lloyd Webber and Taylor Swift.[89] The song was sung by Francesca Hayward, followed later in a reprise by Judi Dench, with a credits version sung by Swift.[90] The version sung by Swift was released on 15 November 2019.[91]\n\nCatwoman: An adaptation of the comic character as a spin-off of the 1989 Batman series since Batman Forever with Tim Burton as director and producer Denise Di Novi and writer Daniel Waters also returned.[92] Waters turned in his Catwoman script to Warner Bros., the same day Batman Forever was released. Burton was still being courted to direct. Waters joked that \"turning it in the day Batman Forever opened may not have been my best logistical move, in that it's the celebration of the fun-for-the-whole-family Batman. Catwoman is definitely not a fun-for-the-whole-family script\".[93] In an August 1995 interview, Pfeiffer reiterated her interest in the spin-off but explained her priorities would be challenged as a mother and commitments to other projects.[94][95] Ashley Judd as the lead in 2001,[96][97] but she eventually dropped out[98] so Nicole Kidman was considered.[99] When Warner Bros. canceled a Batman vs. Superman film scheduled for 2004, the studio decided to quickly produce Catwoman as replacement, starring Halle Berry.[100] Berry chose to be involved with the film after the cancellation of Jinx, a James Bond spin-off featuring her character Giacinta \"Jinx\" Johnson from Die Another Day (2002).[101] Josh Lucas was considered for the role of Tom Lone.[102]\n\nA Confederacy of Dunces: The Pulitzer Prize-winning novel has had a motion picture adaptation announced at least seven times, with some of the attempts even making it to a full script being written and most of the major characters of the novel cast, only to always stall and be abandoned.[103][104][105][106][107][108][109][110]\n\nDallas Buyers Club: The screenplay was written in September 1992 by Craig Borten. Through the 1990s he wrote ten different scripts, hoping for it to be picked up. It was unable to secure financial backing, going through three different directors, finally being released in 2013, with Jean-Marc Vallée directing.[111]\n\nThe Dark Tower: An adaptation of The Dark Tower had been in development since at least 2007.[112] The film was eventually released on August 4, 2017.[113]\n\nDeadpool: Deadpool was in development hell for more than 15 years.[114] In May 2000, Artisan Entertainment announced a deal with Marvel Entertainment to coproduce, finance and distribute a film based on American comic books publisher Marvel Comics character Deadpool.[115] In February 2004, New Line Cinema attempted to produce a Deadpool film with writer/director David S. Goyer working on the spin-off and actor Ryan Reynolds in the title role;[116][117] Reynolds himself became interested in the character after finding out that in Cable & Deadpool, Deadpool refers to his own scarred appearance as \"Ryan Reynolds crossed with a Shar Pei\".[118][119] By August, Goyer lost interest in favor of other projects.[120] In March 2005, after New Line put Deadpool in turnaround, 20th Century Fox became interested in moving forward on production for the project.[121] Fox considered a Deadpool spin-off early in the development of X-Men Origins: Wolverine, which had Reynolds cast in the role,[116] and after the opening weekend success of that film announced that it was lending Deadpool out to writers, with Lauren Shuler Donner acting as a producer.[122] Donner wanted the film to reboot the character of Deadpool, ignoring the version in X-Men Origins: Wolverine and including attributes that the character has in the comics, such as breaking the fourth wall.[123] Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick were hired to write the script in January 2010,[124] and Robert Rodriguez was sent an early draft of the screenplay that June.[125] After negotiations with Rodriguez fell through, Adam Berg emerged as a top contender to direct.[126] In April 2011, visual effects specialist Tim Miller was hired as director, making the film his directorial debut.[127] In September 2014, Fox gave the film a release date of February 12, 2016.[128] The film was released on that date to positive reviews[129][130] and became the ninth highest-grossing film of 2016 worldwide,[131] as well as the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, until it was surpassed by its own sequel, Deadpool 2, which itself was later surpassed by the film Joker.[132][133][134]\n\nDeath Note: This 2017 neo-noir supernatural teen horror film, loosely based on the Japanese manga and anime of the same names respectively, was in development since August 2007.[135] The American production company Vertigo Entertainment was originally set to develop the remake, with Charley and Vlas Parlapanides as screenwriters and Roy Lee, Doug Davison, Dan Lin, and Brian Witten as producers.[136] On April 30, 2009, Variety reported that Warner Bros., the distributors for the original Japanese live-action films, had acquired the rights for an American remake, with the original screenwriters and producers still attached.[137] In 2009, Zac Efron responded to rumors that he would be playing the film's lead role by stating that the project was \"not on the front burner\".[138] On January 13, 2011, it was announced that Shane Black had been hired to direct the film, with the script being written by Anthony Bagarozzi and Charles Mondry.[139] Warner's studios planned to change the background story of Light Yagami into one of vengeance instead of justice and to remove Shinigami from the story. Black opposed this change, and it had not been green-lit.[140] Black confirmed in a 2013 interview with Bleeding Cool that he was still working on the film.[141] In July 2014, it was rumored that Gus Van Sant would replace Black as the film's new director, with Dan Lin, Doug Davison, Roy Lee and Brian Witten producing through Vertigo Entertainment, Witten Pictures and Lin Pictures.[142] The film was eventually directed by Adam Wingard and was distributed by Netflix for an August 2017 release and received mostly negative reviews.[citation needed]\n\nDeep: Shane Acker expressed interest in creating more animated projects aimed for older audiences due to the severe lack of them. Like 9, Deep would have been another darker animated film and will take place in a post-apocalyptic world (although set in a different universe).[143] There were no further announcements, but a Facebook profile of the character \"the Scientist\" was updated with a rather cryptic message. The profile had been inactive since 2009, leading some to speculate the teasing of a sequel.[144]\n\nDie Hard 4: A fourth installment in the Die Hard franchise was in the works since 1998 with David Marconi, screenwriter of the film Enemy of the State, penning under its working title, WW3.com[145] and using John Carlin's Wired magazine article entitled \"A Farewell to Arms\", Marconi crafted a screenplay about a cyber-terrorist attack on the United States.[146][147] After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the project was stalled, only to be resurrected several years later and rewritten into Live Free or Die Hard by Doug Richardson and eventually by Mark Bomback.[148] Willis said in 2005 that the film would be called Die Hard 4.0, as it revolves around computers and cyber-terrorism. IGN later reported the film was to be called Die Hard: Reset instead.[149] 20th Century Fox later announced the title as Live Free or Die Hard and set a release date of June 29, 2007 with filming to begin in September 2006.[151] The film was the only film in the franchise to receive a PG-13 rating. It was a moderate box office hit, but as with the first three films, it received positive reviews from critics and audiences.\n\nDinosaur: The film was pitched back in 1988 by Phil Tippett as a stop motion animated film then in 1994 was changed to a CGI animated film after seeing Jurassic Park. The film also had problems with the story, Having many drafts written and even with the final draft a lot of cuts to the film had to be made. The film was in development for 12 years until its final release in 2000.\n\nDisney's Don Quixote: Ever since the 1940s, Disney wanted to do an adaptation of Don Quixote with various attempts being different from one another with various mediums for each different version including live action and animation with the latest news of Disney adapting the story was 2016.[152]\n\nDragon's Lair: Since the 80s, Dragon's Lair faced plans for a film adaptation but otherwise went to development hell. The first attempt was a fully animated film titled Dragon's Lair: The Legend which would have focused on how Dirk and Daphne met as teenagers and Mordroc was set to be involved in the plot. It would have also explained why Dirk was mute with ideas like being born mute or losing his voice due to a spell or event in the feature film. Despite this, Michael J. Fox was considered to voice Dirk. The first attempt never got made due to low interest from studios.[153] Eventually on 2015, Don Bluth and Gary Goldman made a Kickstarter page to pledge for a potential fully animated film based on the game of the same name.[154] The story would provide more backstory to Dirk and Daphne, but the latter's \"sexualized\" appearance would be toned down.[155] In 2020, it was announced that Netflix approved a live action adaptation of the game complete with Ryan Reynolds playing as Dirk.[156]\n\nDuke Nukem: Since the 90s, a film adaptation based on the shooter game series was in development. The earliest was when Lawrence Kasanoff announced he was working on the film. Plans were announced during 2001 for a live action Duke Nukem movie to be produced by Kasanoff's company Threshold Entertainment.[157] in 2008, Scott Faye said that was planning to produce the movie.[158] Gearbox Software CEO Randy Pitchford hinted on the making of the film in a 2017 interview.[159] In 2018, John Cena was announced as the star playing as Duke Nukem himself.[160] Legendary Entertainment acquired the rights to make a Duke Nukem film with the team behind Cobra Kai involved in production.[161]\n\nEvangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time: The fourth and final installment of in the Rebuild of Evangelion tetralogy, based on the anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion, was announced alongside Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo as the final part of the Rebuild tetralogy under its working title Evangelion: Final, as double feature for release in 2008.[162][163][164][165] Originally scheduled for a release in 2020, it was removed due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic thus later being rescheduled for January 23, 2021[166][167] until January 14, 2021, when the film was removed from the release calendar again.[168][169] The film was finally released in Japan on March 8, 2021,[170] to favorable reviews.\n\nThe Family Guy Movie: A theatrical film based on the hit Fox series Family Guy was announced since July 2007, over two years after the series was revived from cancellation, but series creator Seth MacFarlane declared it as \"nothing official\" at that time.[171] In TV Week on July 18, 2008, MacFarlane confirmed plans to produce a theatrically released Family Guy feature film sometime \"within the next year.\"[172] He came up with an idea for the story, \"something that you could not do on the show, which [to him] is the only reason to do a movie.\" He later went on to say he imagines the film to be \"an old-style musical with dialogue\" similar to The Sound of Music, saying that he would \"really be trying to capture, musically, that feel.\"[173] On October 13, 2011, MacFarlane confirmed that a deal for a Family Guy film had been made, and that it would be written by himself and series co-producer Ricky Blitt.[174] On November 30, 2012, MacFarlane confirmed plans to produce a Family Guy film.[175] The project was put on hold while MacFarlane worked on Ted 2.[176] On August 10, 2018, Fox announced that a live-action/animated film based on the series is in development.[177] In July 2019, MacFarlane confirmed that there will be a Family Guy movie, though the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney has made the timeline for the film's development and release unclear.[178]\n\nFantasia 2000: During Walt Disney's time when the original Fantasia was released, Disney himself considered making more segments for the film and thought of releasing the film in a continual release whereas new segments would replace older ones. It was scrapped due to the film's box office reception and mixed reviews from critics. In 1980, animators Wolfgang Reitherman and Mel Shaw worked on a spiritual successor to Fantasia titled Musicana which would've mixed jazz, classical music, myths, modern art, etc. The idea of a Fantasia sequel was revived shortly after Michael Eisner became chief executive officer of The Walt Disney Company in 1984, when Walt's nephew, vice chairman Roy E. Disney, suggested it to him at a lunch.[179] André Previn was at one point going to work on the sequel but refused to do so after learning that the sequel would feature songs from The Beatles rather than typical classical music. It took a further seven years before the film was reconsidered, after the 1990 reissue of Fantasia grossed $25 million domestically and the announcement of its limited availability on home video in 1991 prompted 9.25 million pre-orders. Disney saw its commercial success as a sign that there was enough public interest in the Fantasia franchise to make a sequel. Eisner finally gave the green-light to the film in 1991, and had Disney serve as executive producer on the basis that its production was funded by the proceeds from the video sales. Production began under the working title Fantasia Continued but was changed to Fantasia 1999 and later Fantasia 2000. It was originally going to be a \"semi-new movie\" where it would feature most segments from the original Fantasia with only a few new segments but it didn't work out well so the older segments had to be trimmed down to three consisting of The Sorcerer's Apprentice, The Nutcracker Suite, and Dance of the Hours. The former was chosen eventually as the only returning segment to feature in 2000. There was even some unused segments that were meant to be in the final film which include Clair de Lune and Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini. The film was officially announced on February 9, 1999 and was released on January 1, 2000 via IMAX and June 16, 2000 in the United States.\n\nThe Flash: Development of a film based on the comic book character of the same name began in the late 1980s when Warner Bros. hired comic book writer Jeff Loeb to write a treatment.[180] The project was later revived in December 2004 when David S. Goyer was brought on to write, direct, and produce a new version of The Flash after penning the script for Batman Begins.[181] After Goyer left the project in February 2007 over creative differences, Shawn Levy was hired to direct with a new draft written by Chris Bancato,[182] before both abandoned the project in October 2007 and David Dopkin was hired to revamp it as a spin-off to George Miller's then-planned film, Justice League: Mortal, with Adam Brody cast as the character.[183] Justice League: Mortal was later cancelled and the film was stuck in further development caused by the 2007-2008 Writers' Guild of America strike.[184] Warner Bros. began development again as part of their newly established DC Extended Universe in July 2013, with a planned release date of 2016.[185] In October 2014, Ezra Miller was cast as the character, with a theatrical release planned for March 23, 2018.[186] Miller portrayed the character onscreen in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), Suicide Squad (2016), and Justice League (2017). Several directors, including Seth Grahame-Smith, Rick Famuyiwa, and filmmaking duo John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, left the project over creative differences at various points from 2016 to 2018. Christina Hodson and Andy Muschietti were confirmed to be writing and directing, respectively, in November 2019.[187] Pre-production began in January 2020, with Principal photography lasting from April to October 2021 at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden. After multiple post-production setbacks and controversies surrounding Miller, the film was released on June 16, 2023, and became a commercial failure.\n\nFoodfight!: In 2004, the CGI film Foodfight was announced. Described as \"Toy Story in a supermarket\", the film promised to bring together over 80 famous advertising characters with voice talent including Charlie Sheen, Christopher Lloyd, Eva Longoria, Hilary and Haylie Duff, and Wayne Brady. Director Lawrence Kasanoff expected it to be a commercial hit and merchandise for the movie appeared on store shelves before the film had a release date. However, the film ran into many problems.[188] In late 2002/early 2003, Kasanoff reported that hard drives containing unfinished assets from the film had been stolen in what he called an act of \"industrial espionage.\" However, those who worked on the film did not recall this happening, with one assistant claiming that the original hard drives were saved and stored properly and believed that Kasanoff was simply not satisfied with them. A behind-the-scenes showreel Kasanoff put together to entice investors is the only significant surviving footage of the original incarnation of the film.[189] After several years, a trailer[190] was finally shown at AHM in 2011, a company bought the DVD distribution rights for the film in Europe,[191] and a quiet video-on-demand American release came in 2012.\n\nFreddy vs. Jason: A crossover between Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees was first attempted in 1987, but fell apart due to disagreements between Paramount Pictures and New Line Cinema, the respective owners of Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street.[192] After the release of Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday, which teased Freddy vs. Jason, New Line Cinema spent roughly $6 million on several unused scripts from over a dozen screenwriters, but eventually, Mark Swift and Damian Shannon produced a script that went into production. The film experienced controversy when it was announced Kane Hodder, the longtime actor for Jason, was to be replaced by a different actor, and experienced further controversy when it was revealed that the original 120-page script was to be cut down by a different writer. Both Swift and Shannon had to deal with studio interference and hesitation, as well as fighting a PG-13 rating and having to send out a questionnaire to gauge interest in the concept.[193] Finally, the film released on August 15, 2003, and grossed $116.6 million worldwide on a production budget of $30 million to a mild critical response.[194][195]\n\nFrozen: Beginning development in 1940 as a biopic about Hans Christian Andersen's life,[196] progress on the Disney–Goldwyn project halted in 1942 as the United States entered World War II, with Disney shifting its focus to wartime propaganda. Between 1992 and 2002, Disney attempted a revival of the project, with multiple versions of the film now stored in their Animation Research Library. These versions removed key elements such as a troll and a mirror, requiring creative solutions for the character Kai's departure. Attempts included a story line in Iceland where Kai joins a whaling ship to impress Gerda, while the Snow Queen rides an orca. Other versions experimented with adding comic side characters to the narrative but no one was able to transform the minimally defined characters and episodic plot into a compelling narrative. That was until it was put back into production in 2008 with Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee as directors and was released in 2013.[197]\n\nHellraiser: A remake of the original 1987 film was first announced by Clive Barker in October 2006 in which he stated he was writing the script and it was going to be produced by Dimension Films.[198] He also announced that Pascal Laugier was set to direct, but he was later taken off the project due to creative differences.[199] Then in October 2010, Patrick Lussier and Todd Farmer were announced to be writing and directing the film, but in 2011 they said they were also taken off the project despite drafting multiple scripts with different ideas.[200] Two years later in October 2013, Clive Barker announced he was to head a Hellraiser reboot starring Doug Bradley in his ninth film as Pinhead[201] but he announced in 2017 on Twitter that the script had been sent to Dimension Films years ago with no correspondence since.[202] Finally, Spyglass Media Group and David S. Goyer were confirmed to be working on a Hellraiser remake in May 2019, and in 2020 David Bruckner, Ben Collins and Luke Piotrowski were also confirmed to be directing and writing the script.[203][204] In October 2021, principal filming finally wrapped up; it was revealed that Jamie Clayton was to be playing Pinhead and the film was coming out on Hulu.[205]\n\nThe Incredible Mr. Limpet: Development for a remake of the 1964 film of the same name started in 1996 with Jim Carrey in the lead role and Steve Oedekerk as director. By March 1999, Oedekerk left the project following creative differences, while Carrey followed suit in July the same year. In April 2000, Mike Judge was also set to direct with filming set to begin in February 2001. In June 2009, Kevin Lima was attached to direct. In 2010, it was reported that Zach Galifianakis was in talks for the lead role. In March 2011, Richard Linklater entered negotiations to helm the project, and was announced as the director in January 2014. That same month, Femke Wolting and Tommy Pallotta had begun working on the design and animation on the project while Galifianakis would reportedly play the lead character. On July 8, 2014, it was announced that Jon Hamm, Danny McBride, Sarah Silverman, Kevin Hart, Josh Gad, Keegan-Michael Key, and Jordan Peele had entered talks for various roles in the film. On August 4, Linklater left the project to concentrate on his next film That's What I'm Talking About (released in 2016 as Everybody Wants Some!!).\n\nID Forever Part I and II: The sequels to Independence Day were in development hell from 1997 until 2009, when director Roland Emmerich announced the pre-production of the films, which were planned to be shot back-to-back.[206] However, ID Forever Part I was renamed to Independence Day: Resurgence for its release on June 24, 2016.[207]\n\nThe Irishman: The film had been in development since 2007.[208][209] It went on to have its world premiere at the 57th New York Film Festival on September 27, 2019, and received a limited theatrical release on November 1, 2019, followed by digital streaming on November 27, 2019, by Netflix.[210]\n\nUntitled The Jetsons film: Not to be confused with Jetsons: The Movie. Since 1985, there were various attempts to make a film adaptation of the Hanna-Barbera show of the same name. The earliest was a live-action film by Paramount Pictures but it never got made.[211] In 2001, Paul Foley and Dan Forman were hired to revise a screenplay with Rob Minkoff and Denise Di Novi as director and producer respectively.[212] Then came 2007 where Robert Rodriguez was in talks to make a live-action film based on the animated sitcom though he was uncertain about what project to pursue next.[213] In 2012, the latest announcement for a live action Jetsons film was that Van Robichaux and Evan Susser were hired to rewrite the script.[214] Then in 2015 it was announced that Warner Animation Group would develop a live action Jetsons film.[215] As of May 2017, Conrad Vernon became the director of the film.[216]\n\nJim Henson Idea Man: Since 2010, a biopic based on the life of Jim Henson has been in development at Walt Disney Pictures and The Jim Henson Company. Lisa Henson was the producer of the biopic while Michael Mitnick wrote the script.[217] The film was ultimately retooled as a documentary, which saw release on May 31, 2024.[218]\n\nJohn Carter: Several attempts to adapt the Barsoom series had been made since the 1930s by various major studios and producers, including a cartoon animated by veteran Bob Clampett.[219] In the 1980s, film producers Mario Kassar and Andrew G. Vajna bought the rights for Walt Disney Studios via Cinergi Pictures, with a view to create a competitor to the original Star Wars trilogy and Conan the Barbarian. Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio were hired to write, while John McTiernan and Tom Cruise were approached to direct and star. The project collapsed when McTiernan realized that visual effects were not yet advanced enough to recreate Burroughs' vision of Barsoom.[220] The film was picked up at Paramount Pictures in the early 2000s and several directors, Robert Rodriguez, Kerry Conran, and Jon Favreau, came and exited the project before Paramount decided not to renew the film rights.[221][220] Eventually filmmaker Andrew Stanton lobbied Disney to reacquire the rights, and he was hired as director for his live action directorial debut.[222] The film was released in 2012 as one of the most expensive films ever, and was a notorious flop at the box-office.\n\nJurassic World: The fourth film of the Jurassic Park series was in development hell ever since the release of Jurassic Park III in 2001 when it was first announced. After scheduling and release conflicts, the fourth film was eventually retooled as a soft reboot known as Jurassic World, which was released theatrically on June 12, 2015.\n\nUntitled Keith Moon biopic: For more than 15 years, The Who lead singer Roger Daltrey had a planned biopic based upon the late English drummer. Mike Myers was at one point intended to be the star of the biopic in an early attempt.[223] Later on after many years of development hell, Daltrey said that he was pleased with a script for the film and thus he vowed that the film can still be made.[224]\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Since 2007, Nintendo's Zelda series faced plans for a film adaptation. The earliest was when Imagi Animation Studios wanted to make an animated film adaptation of the video game franchise and thus made a pitch reel for a CGI Zelda movie. However, their version of the film got cancelled due to Nintendo not wanting to repeat the same mistakes as what happened with the live-action Super Mario Bros. film.[225] In 2013, Eiji Aonuma talked about how he wanted to make an interactive Zelda movie where players could bring their Nintendo 3DS into the cinema and players can participate in the film somehow.[226] Around June 2023, there were rumors suggesting that after the success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Universal and Illumination wanted to do a fully animated film adaptation of the video game series.[227] However, Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri denied the rumors.[228] In November 2023, it was finally announced that a live-action Zelda movie is in the works with Wes Ball directing while Shigeru Miyamoto and Avi Arad being the producers.[229] According to Miyamoto, he claims that he's been working on a Zelda movie for \"many years\".[230]\n\nLive 2 Tell: A film based on the rapper Tupac Shakur's screenplay that he had written during his incarceration in 1995, about a drug dealer's tale of redemption.[231] The project goes back to 2005, where IMDb listed it as currently in-production pending further development.[232] No information was published until 2011 when a company named NStar Studios picked up the project and planned to put it into production in 2012. With an estimated budget of $11 million, a crowdfunding campaign was started to raise $250,000 in 30 days, but it failed and NStar was never able to get the project off the ground.[citation needed] As of 2021, the film is still listed on IMDb with no further information available.[233]\n\nMad God: This stop motion experimental horror film had been in development for 30 years.[234]\n\nMad Max: Fury Road: In 1995, George Miller re-acquired the rights to future Mad Max films from Warner Bros.[235] The idea for a fourth instalment occurred to Miller in August 1998 when he was walking in an intersection in Los Angeles.[236] About a year later, while travelling from Los Angeles to Australia, the idea coalesced. Miller conceived a story where \"violent marauders were fighting, not for oil or for material goods, but for human beings.\"[236] The film was set to shoot in 2001 through 20th Century Fox, but was postponed because of the September 11 attacks that same year.[237] \"The American dollar collapsed against the Australian dollar, and our budget ballooned\", Miller said, adding that he \"had to move on to Happy Feet because there was a small window when that was ready\". Mel Gibson, who starred in the original three previous films, would not return to his role as the lead character. Miller ended up re-casting the role because of controversies surrounding Gibson and because he wanted Max to remain at a younger age, as the \"same contemporary warrior\".[236] Miller announced in 2003 that a script had been written for a fourth film, and that pre-production was in the early stages.[238] The project was given the green light to begin filming in the Australian desert in May 2003 with a budget of US$100 million, but the location was ruined by rainfall. Mad Max 4 then entered a hiatus in light of security concerns related to its Namibian shoot because of tightened travel and shipping restrictions at the onset of the Iraq War.[239][240] In 2007, after focusing on the animated musical comedy Happy Feet, Miller decided to pursue the project again. He briefly considered producing Fury Road as an animated film but abandoned it in favor of live-action. In 2009, Miller announced that filming would begin in early 2011. Tom Hardy was cast as the title character in June 2010, with production planned to begin that November. Principal photography was delayed several more times before beginning in July 2012. The film wrapped in December 2012, although additional footage was shot in November 2013.

J. Abrams wrote a script yet it was eventually abandoned.[424] Nat Mauldin wrote a prequel titled Roger Rabbit: The Toon Platoon (later renamed as Who Discovered Roger Rabbit) which would still feature characters from The Golden Age of American animation and it would have had Roger live on a farm during his early days and traveling to the west to seek his mother.[425] He also meets Jessica who happens to be his future wife. Roger was also going to be in the army while Jessica was kidnapped to do pro-Nazi Germany broadcasts and thus Roger and new character Ritchie Davenport goes on a quest to save her and thus being accompanied by several other Toons in their army. It would also reveal that Roger would reunite with his mom as well as his dad Bugs Bunny.[426] It was cancelled because just as soon as Steven Spielberg saw the script, he left due to not wanting to satirize Nazism after directing Schindler's List. Eventually it was reworked into a different story (Roger would have found himself in rising stardom on Broadway and Hollywood while still searching for his mother) in and test footage was made in Lake Buena Vista, Florida which consisted of CGI, traditional animation, and live-action which didn't please Disney. A second test entirely made the Toons CGI but the film was scrapped due to budget reasons.[427][428] Don Hahn doubts that a sequel would be made due to the rise of computer animation.[429] In 2009, another attempt was made through ImageMovers yet the human characters will be done via Motion capture much like films including The Polar Express and Disney's A Christmas Carol while the Toons would still remain in traditional animation.[430] It was cancelled eventually due to Bob Hoskins' retirement from acting in 2012 and later his eventual death,[431] the unsatisfactory performance of A Christmas Carol,[432] and the failure of Mars Needs Moms which led to projects like the Roger Rabbit sequel, Calling All Robots,[433] a remake of Yellow Submarine,[434] and The Nutcracker[435] to be cancelled. Later, Zemeckis said that a sequel could still be possible without Hoskins.[436] In 2013, it was announced that an animated Disney buddy comedy film starring Mickey Mouse and Roger called The Stooge which would have been based on the 1952 film of the same name and would have been a prequel.[437] In 2016, Zemeckis said that the sequel moves the story of Roger and Jessica into the next few years thus moving on from film noir to the world of the 1950s. It would also feature a \"digital Bob Hoskins\" due to Eddie being depicted as a ghost in the film. While hand drawn is still going to be used in the film, the chances of Disney green-lighting the film are \"slim\".[438] In 2018, Zemeckis claims that Disney is unlikely to ever make the sequel.[439]\n\nBig Nate: A TV series based on the comic strip of the same name since 1991 for a Saturday-morning cartoon on NBC.

Production for Detox began in 2000, but has been delayed several times as Dr. Dre wanted to concentrate on producing for artists that were on his Aftermath record label. Work for the upcoming album dates back to 2001,[459] where its first version was called \"the most advanced rap album ever,\" by co-producer Scott Storch.[460] Even at the beginning of Detox's production, it was announced that it would be Dr. Dre's final studio album,[460] which had been confirmed at different points throughout the album's 10-year production process.[461] Because Dr. Dre had stated he was tired of rapping about marijuana use and a stereotypical gangster lifestyle, he planned to make Detox a hip-hop musical telling the story of a professional hitman and his family, with an intended summer 2003 release date.[459] Initially announced in 2000 after the release of Dr. Dre's previous album 2001 (1999), Detox went through many iterations during its 11-year production period, failing to have a confirmed release date due to Dr. Dre believing the project \"wasn't good enough\". However, the album spawned two official singles, \"Kush\" and \"I Need a Doctor\". In January 2004, Storch listed guest appearances such as 50 Cent, Eminem, Game, and Snoop Dogg.

In September 2018, during Chance the Rapper's Open Mike event in Chicago, West made a surprise appearance and announced that he was working on a collaborative studio album with Chance titled Good-Ass Job.[467] Although, after the critical and commercial failure of Chance's debut studio album The Big Day, the collaborative project has seemingly been cancelled as no news has come out since and Chance's relationship with West significantly soured during the recording of Donda, West's tenth studio album.[468]\n\ni/o: The tenth studio album from British art pop musician Peter Gabriel, i/o began production in April 1995 following the conclusion of Gabriel's Secret World tour, concurrently with his seventh studio album, Up (itself not released until 2002).[469][470] Gabriel originally stated that the album would be released in 2004,[471] only for extensive touring in support of Up to delay these plans considerably. Gabriel repeatedly gave vague updates on the album's production over the following years, first stating in 2008 that he was \"shifting focus\" towards both i/o and his cover album Scratch My Back (which saw release in 2010) before later claiming in 2011 that i/o was still just a number of unfinished \"song ideas\" that he had yet to elaborate upon.[472] Gabriel would continue to post about the album's production during the remainder of the 2010s, ultimately stating on BBC Radio in April 2019 that he was planning on finishing songwriting for i/o by the end of the year. Despite his plans to \"get a record out\" by early 2020, the album was delayed further as a result of lockdowns imposed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In an interview with Uncut magazine for their September 2020 issue, Gabriel stated that despite the delays, \"I have enough songs to make a record I'm proud of,\"[473] and that a complete album could be expected at an indeterminate point in the future. The album's lead single, \"Panopticom\", was eventually released on January 6, 2023, with additional singles coming out each successive full moon that year.[474] The full album was released on December 1, 2023, 28 years and eight months after production began and nearly two decades after its originally announced release date. i/o received notoriety for its repeated delays, with Rolling Stone calling it the \"Chinese Democracy of Peter Gabriel albums\",[475] and Stereogum calling it \"the Smile (or perhaps the Chinese Democracy) of art-rock.\"[476]\n\nLook Outside Your Window: An unreleased studio album recorded by four members of the American band Slipknot. The material was written and recorded concurrently with the sessions for the band's fourth studio album All Hope Is Gone (2008). However, its emphasis on experimentation and a more melodic rock style kept it classified as a separate body of work from Slipknot's aggressive heavy metal sound. The album was scheduled for release during the latter half of the band's We Are Not Your Kind touring cycle, which was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After a few years of uncertainty, on January 2, 2023, percussionist Shawn Crahan spoke about the possibility of the album being released later this year.[477]\n\nThe Smile Sessions: Archival recordings of the Beach Boys' unfinished album Smile took nearly 45 years to compile for a dedicated release. Numerous complications contributed to its excessively protracted delay, including bandleader Brian Wilson's irrational fear of the album. Brother and bandmate Carl Wilson compared the album's structuring to editing a film, as compiler Alan Boyd explains, \"I think he was right about that. The kind of editing that the project required seemed more like the process of putting a film together than a pop record.\"[478]\n\nStarship: A studio album by Italian electronic band Eiffel 65, this would be their fourth album since 2003, and the first one after ending their \"Bloom 06 project\" in 2010. Members Gianfranco Randone and Maurizio Lobina reunited that same year with Gabry Ponte, who had left the band in 2005[479] to \"reunite once again to produce new music as well as touring\".[480] In an April 2012 interview, Jeffrey Jey commented that \"within the next two or three months\"[481] they would release \"some\" songs online. Four years after, on June 1, 2016, they released \"Panico/Critical\", their first single in twelve years. They have toured Europe with their \"New Planet Tour\" since 2010, mainly in Italy, and occasionally in other European countries, as well as in Australia in 2012.[482] As of 2021, the band is semi-active; Gabry Ponte has stated that he does not participate in record production and concerts, but he has never officially left the group either. In 2020, Italian rapper Shiva released a single called \"Auto Blu ft. Eiffel 65\", which is a remake of Blue (Da Ba Dee) with different lyrics. Some unreleased Eiffel 65 songs have been leaked, but the album remains unreleased almost ten years after its announcement, five years after their last original single was released, and eighteen years after their last studio album was released, with no further details or release date set for their new album, if ever.\n\nStill Sucks: This is the sixth album from American nu metal band Limp Bizkit, released a decade after the band's fifth album Gold Cobra was released in 2011. Production began when they left Interscope and signed up with Cash Money Records in February 2012, with attempts to release a new album under its initial name Stampede of the Disco Elephants. The first single \"Lightz (City of Angels)\" was released on October 26, 2012. After many delays, the second single for the album, \"Ready to Go\", featuring label mate Lil Wayne was released on April 16, 2013, to positive reviews.[483] The band officially left their previous label Cash Money Records on October 26, 2014.[484][485] In February 2016, Metal Injection reported that the band was still in the studio recording the new album.[486] The album remained unreleased, with no release date set for several years.[487] Guitarist Wes Borland has already completed writing and performing guitars for the record, but stated in late 2017 that frontman Fred Durst is still working on his parts.[488] Borland again reiterated the band's progress in November 2018.[489] In July 2017, Durst claimed on Instagram that the album had already been available online for a year and a half on Soulseek, but Borland refuted this saying he \"doesn't know what [Durst] is talking about.\"[490] In August 2021, the band announced they would begin releasing songs in close succession, leading up to the album's release, before announcing the album title as Still Sucks and the release date.[491] The album was released on October 31, 2021, to positive reviews. None of the previously released singles were included on the album.\n\nTime II: This is the upcoming fourth album by Finnish metal band Wintersun and a follow-up to their 2012 album Time I. Both albums were planned to be one full album tentatively titled Time. As of the commencement of recording in May 2006, frontman Jari Mäenpää stated that the album length would run over 65 minutes, and that it would be a concept album.[492] Furthermore, according to Mäenpää, the album's sound was to be highly intricate. Each song was said to contain about 200 tracks.[492] On February 27, 2009, Mäenpää announced through Wintersun's official website that the band would cancel all their live appearances, including Bloodstock Open Air and Summer Breeze, in order to make way for the slow progress of the album.[493] On April 26, 2010, Mäenpää announced on the Wintersun message board that \"Land of Snow and Sorrow\" was completely finished and that the tracks \"Storm\" and \"Silver Leaves\" would be done soon.[494] On November 17, 2010, the band members announced on Wintersun's official website that the album was close to being completed for the most part and that the synths and orchestrations might be finished around December 2010/January 2011. Jari intended to start mixing the album afterwards.[495] On December 25, 2010, Jari stated on the Winter Madness message board that \"Silver Leaves\" was finished except for some orchestrations. On December 26, 2010, Jari stated that three songs are finished and ready for mixing, and that four songs have \"bits and pieces\" missing, including vocals.[496] On March 19, 2011, Jari announced via the Winter Madness message board that mixing had been put on hold until late summer at the earliest due to various complications, ranging from a lack of 64-bit DAW plugins to noisy nearby construction.[497] Time was eventually announced to be split into two halves and released separately, with the titles of Time I and Time II. Time I was released in October 19, 2012 in Europe and October 22, 2012 in North America.[498][499] Since then, production of Time II was marred with years-long delays for a multitude of reasons, until 12 January 2024, when Wintersun announced on its social media that Time II is \"100%\" complete.[500] Three days later, on 15 January 2024, the band announced that \""
