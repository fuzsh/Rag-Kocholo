        "text": "It is known that for years and particularly in the most urbanized areas of the planet we have been suffering a setback in terms of cultivated biodiversity, that is to say in the diversity of varieties and species that we cultivate, mainly for culinary uses (but not exclusively, they can also be medicinal, tooling, symbolic or other), in fact, it is estimated that 75% of the agricultural genetic heritage has already been lost. This fact is associated with the homogenization of the diet and the expansion of the industrial model of food production on a global scale, privileging the use of a few seeds improved and standardized under production criteria ahead of the local varieties typical of each territory, more heterogeneous and diverse.\n\nLocal, traditional, old, peasant, free or country varieties are better adapted to organic farming conditions and are a key element for the resilience and food sovereignty of the territories. Because they have not been selected looking only for productivity, but uses and specific qualities that meet the demands of the agrosystem and are free to distribute. On the other hand, they diversify the food base of both traditional and current societies.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2000s there were very few initiatives in Catalonia and Spain that were working on the conservation of cultivated biodiversity. At that time in the Agricultural School of Manresa they had been carrying out prospecting of local varieties in Bages. In fact, from this small agroecological ecosystem of Bages emerged in 2002 the Esporus project, a seed bank that is located in Manresa promoted by the ERA, the Association of Agroecological Resources. Ester, founding partner of the Refardes who at that time was working at the Agricultural School together with Ernest, the other founding partner of Les Refardes, decided to promote a project that covered one of the gaps they detected at the time: prospecting and collecting seeds and the associated knowledge were being replicated and preserved in seed banks, but at the moment there was no initiative to promote on a small scale or average its use and that it made them reach a wider audience or to the same peasantry.\n\nThey believed that creating a project focused mainly on the replication and commercialization of the seeds of local varieties would help to renormalise their use and thus preserve them in vivo: extending their cultivation and consumption again, making them live seeds. This is how in 2003 the project of Les Refardes was born."
