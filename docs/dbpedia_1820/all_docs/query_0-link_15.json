        "text": "The Materials for Sustainable Development Conference (MATSUS24) took place from the 4th to the 8th of March 2024, in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nThis multisymposium conference dived into the progress that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to satisfy their own demands. The drive for sustainability in materials science and technology encompasses alternative energy technologies to mitigate problems with fossil-fuel technologies, and to increase energy efficiency, as well as the mitigation of undesirable environmental impacts from technology and economic growth; the efficient use of materials, the formation of a healthy and safe environment, and many others. The Conference consisted on a combination of symposia of basic and multidisciplinary science, and applied symposia focused on Sustainable Development areas.\n\nüèÖ Best Poster prize valued at 250‚Ç¨ from the Royal Society of Chemistry to Paula Pinyol.\n\nüèÖ Best Poster prize valued at 200‚Ç¨ from ACS Publications to Ana Herceg.\n\nüèÖ Best Poster prize valued at 200‚Ç¨ from ACS Publications to Helen Tyrrell.\n\nüèÖ Best Poster prize valued at 150‚Ç¨ book voucher from the Solar RRL by Wiley to Antony Litovoilis.\n\nüèÖ Best Poster prize valued at 150‚Ç¨ book voucher from the Advanced Energy Materials by Wiley to Venkata Siva Rama Krishna Tandava.\n\nüèÖ Best Poster prize valued at 150‚Ç¨ book voucher from ChemPhysChem by Wiley to Neus Munar.\n\nüèÖ Best Poster prize valued at 150‚Ç¨ book voucher from ChemPhotoChem by Wiley to Dorota Szepke."
