So, buckle up as Wingman navigates you away from the “tourist tax” and guides you through a trap-free travel experience with the following slide show…\n\nOverpriced Restaurants\n\nSome local places in prime locations might look appealing but often charge triple prices for mediocre food. Opt for dining spots a bit off the beaten path. Look for places filled with locals – it’s a sure sign of good food at fair prices.\n\nFake “Authentic” Souvenirs\n\nShops near major attractions often sell mass-produced items masquerading as local crafts. If you’re after genuine Tuscan souvenirs, head to smaller, family-owned stores. They offer unique, handcrafted items that truly reflect the region’s beauty.\n\nSketchy Parking Services\n\nParking can be a pain in San Gimignano. Be cautious of unofficial parking attendants who demand high fees for “safe” parking spots. Always use designated parking lots and ensure you pay the official rates.\n\n\"Free\" Bracelets and Roses\n\nBeware of friendly vendors offering “free” bracelets or roses; once you accept, they’ll demand payment. It’s a common scam to prey on tourists’ goodwill.\n\nInsider Tip: Politely decline and keep walking. Enjoy the charm of Florence without the unexpected expenses!\n\nFake Tour Guides\n\nSome unlicensed guides offer their services at popular sites but lack the knowledge and credentials of official guides. Book tours through reputable companies or your hotel to ensure a quality experience.\n\nTop Tip: Official guides often have badges or uniforms – look out for these to ensure you’re getting the real deal!\n\nExcessive Entry Fees\n\nSome attractions may inflate entry fees for tourists. Check official websites or local tourism offices for accurate pricing.
