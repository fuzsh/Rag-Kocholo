        "text": "Crystal structure\n\nThe structures of 1a and 1b were obtained at 120 K by SC-XRD. Both compounds crystallize in the triclinic space group P1̄. They are 3D neutral coordination frameworks formed by ErIII ions connected by trz2An bridging linkers. In 1a, the ErIII ion is ennea-coordinated with a {NO8} coordination sphere arising from two oxygens of three bidentate trz2An anilates, the N4 atom of one trz2An and two coordinated water molecules. The geometry of the first coordination sphere is closest to a spherical capped square antiprism (CSAPR-9) according to continuous SHAPE analysis ( and Table S9†).29 ErIII ions are linked to three neighboring ions through the oxygens of three trz2An anilates which coordinate in the bis-bidentate mode. This leads to layers with (6,3) topology forming six-membered rings with distorted hexagonal cavities along the bc plane (Fig. S2a†). Each cavity contains two anilato rings almost parallel to the layer (face-on) and four anilato rings almost perpendicular to it (edge-on). The largest Er–Er–Er angle in the hexagon is 134.4°, while the Er–Er distances of the diagonals of the hexagons are 12.8, 13.4 and 21.9 Å (Table S4†). These distances and angles are similar to those found in LnIII–anilato-based 2D compounds with an ennea-coordinated ligand field for the LnIII and spherical tricapped trigonal prism (TCTPR-9) geometry.30,31 The C–O and C–C bond lengths across the five-membered chelate ring for trz2An ligands also present typical values of anilato dianions (see Table S3†).30 A remarkable difference with respect to previous LnIII anilato-based 2D compounds is that these 2D layers are interconnected through the N4 atoms of the two 1,2,4-triazole substituted pendant arms of one of the three trz2An linkers coordinated to each ErIII (face-on linkers) ( ). This leads to a porous 3D framework, where neighboring layers are eclipsed along the a axis with hexagonal channels filled with water molecules ( ). The remaining N4 atoms of the 1,2,4-triazole substituted pendant arms of the other two trz2An linkers are hydrogen-bonded to coordinating water molecules.\n\nIn 1b, the ErIII ion is ennea-coordinated as well, showing a {NO8} coordination sphere with six oxygens of three bidentate trz2An linkers, two coordinated water molecules and the N4 atom of one trz2An ligand. The coordination geometry is nearest to a spherical tricapped trigonal prism (TCTPR-9) according to continuous SHAPE analysis29 ( and Table S9†). The structure shows layers with (6,3) topology in the [101] plane, in which each ErIII ion is connected to three other ErIII ions through bis-bidentate trz2An linkers forming rectangular six-membered cavities, which adopt a brick-wall structure where the long axes of all the rectangles are parallel (Fig. S2b†). Thus, the two largest Er–Er–Er angles are close to 180° (172.5°) (see Table S6†). On the other hand, ErIII nodes of the same layer are almost coplanar and are connected to ErIII nodes of other layers, through the N4 atom of the two pending triazolyl arms of one of the three trz2An linkers ( ), which are placed at the shortest side of the rectangular cavities, leading to a 3D framework. Finally, the C–O and C–C bond lengths across the five-membered anilato ring for trz2An linkers exhibit, as in 1a, typical values of anilato dianions (see Table S5†).30 The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of both 1a and 1b polycrystalline samples are fully consistent with the calculated ones (Fig. S3 and S4†), confirming the homogeneity and purity of the bulk sample. These polycrystalline samples were placed under vacuum in a Schlenk line and then sealed in a glove box in order to study if the vacuum could induce changes in the crystal structure. A structural change was observed in 1a leading to a new phase, 1a_des, where a loss of water molecules was found. Instead, no structural change was observed for 1b, as clearly shown in Fig. S5.† Remarkably, when 1a_des was left in air for two days, the sample is rehydrated forming the 1a phase as shown by PXRD measurements ( ). This proves that the dehydration/hydration process and the induced structural change are fully reversible.\n\nThe structure of the new dehydrated phase, 1a_des, was investigated by SC-XRD. A vacuum was applied to a single crystal of 1a, which was then transferred to a diffractometer at 120 K. A similar structure was obtained if a single crystal of 1a was heated at 360 K in the diffractometer with a small difference in the water pore content. The ErIII ion in 1a_des (under vacuum/heating) shows a {NO7} coordination sphere arising from six oxygens of three bidentate trz2An linkers, the N4 atom of one trz2An linker and one coordinated water molecule, different from the {NO8} one observed in 1a. This is due to the loss of one water coordination molecule. The coordination geometry is close to a triangular dodecahedron (TDD-8) ( and Table S10†), according to continuous SHAPE analysis.29 Er–O bond lengths are in the range of 2.266(16)–2.430(16) Å for 1a_des after vacuum (2.28(2)–2.442(13) Å for 1a_des at 360 K), while Er–N bond lengths are 2.46(2) Å for 1a_des after vacuum (2.464(18) Å for 1a_des at 360 K). Again, the C–O and C–C bond lengths across the five-membered anilato ring for trz2An linkers exhibit typical values of anilato dianions,30 1.22(3)–1.26(2) and 1.57(3)–1.60(3) Å for 1a_des after vacuum (1.22(3)–1.27(2) and 1.52(3)–1.54(3) Å for 1a_des at 360 K) (see Table S7†). As in the 1a case, the structure shows layers with (6,3) topology in the bc plane, but interestingly, they exhibit a drastic change from a distorted hexagonal 2D network to a distorted 3,6-brickwall rectangular structure. Thus, the six-membered rectangular cavities of the layers contain four face-on and two edge-on anilato rings in 1a_des, instead of the two face-on and four edge-on ones found in 1a (Fig. S2b†). Remarkably, the 3D framework is maintained thanks to the N4 atom of the two pending triazolyl arms of one of the three trz2An linkers located in the shortest side of the rectangular cavity (face-on linker), indicating that the connectivity is the same as that of 1a. Neighboring layers are eclipsed along the a axis, leading to rectangular channels ( ). These channels contain one crystallographically independent water solvate molecule forming a hydrogen bond with the coordinated water molecule. By heating the sample at 360 K, the solvate water molecule shows a disorder, and it was modeled with an occupancy of 0.5. This could be related to a more complete dehydration of the sample. As shown by PXRD, the phase of 1a_des is consistent with the calculated one from the CIF (Fig. S6†).\n\nIn conclusion, a structural phase transition from a hexagonal cavity to a rectangular one is observed when the 1a phase is dehydrated under vacuum or by heating the sample. This transition is fully reversible, as observed when the dehydrated phase (1a_des) is rehydrated.\n\nMagnetic properties\n\nDC magnetic susceptibility measurements of 1a, 1b, and 1a_des were carried out in the temperature range of 2–300 K using an applied magnetic field of 0.1 T ( and S10†). In the case of 1a, it was necessary to perform the measurements in a closed holder and in contact with H2O to prevent its dehydration and subsequent formation of 1a_des due to the vacuum of the squid chamber (∼2–3 mbar). We measure a χMT product at 300 K of 11.43 (1a), 11.36 (1b) and 11.58 (1a_des) cm3 K mol−1, which is close to the value expected for ErIII (11.475 cm3 K mol−1; 4I15/2), thus indicating that most of the ligand field split energy levels of the ground multiplet are populated at room temperature. χMT shows a slow and steady decrease upon cooling from 300 K to 50 K, which becomes sharper at lower temperatures reaching a value of 5.2, 5.5 and 6.1 cm−3 K mol−1 for 1a, 1b and 1a_des, respectively at 2 K. The decrease at low temperature is characteristic of the depopulation of these levels. The field dependence of magnetization was also measured in the 2–8 K temperature range by varying the magnetic field up to 5 T (Fig. S11 and S12†).\n\nTo further understand the observed magnetic behaviour of both phases, theoretical calculations were carried out using the SIMPRE computational package.32 The static magnetic susceptibility was successfully fitted by using the radial effective charge (REC) model33 (Dr = 0.98 Å and Zi = 0.161 for oxygens, and Dr = 1.20 Å and Zi = 0.05 for nitrogen) ( and S10†). This allowed the prediction of the magnetization curves, which are also in good agreement with the experimental data (Fig. S11 and S12†). The diagonalization of the crystal field Hamiltonian results in a ground state wave function mainly composed of 60% of the MJ = |±13/2〉 microstate in the easy axis direction for 1a and 1b, which is congruent with the observed slow relaxation of the magnetization. The first excited doublet is located at about 39 cm−1 and is mainly composed of the MJ = |±11/2〉 microstate (37%), mixed with |±3/2〉 and |±1/2〉 for 1a, while it is located at about 32 cm−1 and is mainly composed of |±15/2〉 and |±11/2〉 (63% between both of them) for 1b. The energy levels are approximately equispaced, and the total crystal field splitting reaches 355 cm−1. In the case of 1a_des, the loss of a water molecule that reduces the coordination number results in a drastic change of the ground state wave function, which is now described by a mixture between |±9/2〉 (64%), |±11/2〉 (14%) and |±7/2〉 (11%) microstates, while the first excited energy level is located at 42 cm−1 (see Tables S13 and S14†).\n\nThe dynamic magnetic properties were studied by susceptibility measurements performed with an alternating magnetic field (AC susceptibility). In the absence of a magnetic field, no signal in the out-of-phase molar susceptibility (χ′′) was observed. When magnetic DC fields of 0.09 T were applied, strong frequency-dependent peaks in both the in-phase molar susceptibility (χ′) and χ′′ appear with clear maxima of χ′′ below 2.2 K for 1a (Fig. S13†). On the other hand, the variable-frequency AC data of 1a at 2 K show a maximum at ca. 5800 Hz in χ′′ (see ). This is a clear indication that 1a presents a field-induced slow relaxation of magnetization. Interestingly, when 1a is dehydrated to give 1a_des, the χ′′ maxima are shifted to higher temperatures (3.6 K for 1a_des and 2.2 K for 1a at a frequency of 10 000 Hz under an applied DC field of 0.09 T) and at lower frequencies in the variable-frequency AC measurements (5800 Hz for 1a and 170 Hz for 1a_des at 2 K) as shown in and . When the same desolvated sample is measured again in contact with H2O, the initial magnetic behavior of 1a is restored in a reversible way. This result confirms that the structural changes of 1a after dehydration modify the magnetic properties, in agreement with the decrease of the mixing with lower microstates found from the theoretical calculations for 1a_des. Thus, although the ground state of 1a_des is dominated by a lower MJ value than for 1a, importantly, most of the wave function is described by high MJ values (88% between |±11/2〉, |±9/2〉 and |±7/2〉), thus resulting in a more negligible contribution from those with lower MJ values. This situation is more favourable to reduce fast spin relaxation through quantum tunneling of the magnetization (QTM) at low temperatures in 1a_des. In contrast, in 1a, the non-negligible contribution of nonaxial crystal-field terms increases the coupling to the degenerate Kramers doublets in high-order perturbation theory34 leading to poorer SMM properties. Another interesting aspect is that the loss of a water molecule erases its molecular vibrations, preventing them from coupling with the ligand field split energy levels, thus suppressing this possible vibration-induced magnetic relaxation channel.35 It is likely that the combination of both effects (a reduction in QTM and molecular vibrations) is responsible for the slight increase in the blocking temperature of 1a after dehydration, as dynamic magnetic measurements indicate. Interestingly, the modulation of SIM properties has not been observed in the isostructural Dy-MOF.36\n\nThe Cole–Cole plots (χ′′ vs. χ′) of 1a_des confirm the presence of a single relaxation process (see Fig. S15†). Thus, at fixed temperatures between 2.0 and 3.5 K, semi-circular plots were obtained and fitted using a generalized Debye model, yielding the α parameter in the range of 0.17–0.40. This indicates moderately broad distributions of the relaxation processes. In the case of 1a, only one temperature could be studied due to the lower temperature of the maxima in χ′′ (see Fig. S15†). Again, the Cole–Cole plot at this temperature suggests the presence of a single relaxation process (α = 0.31). The relaxation times (τ) of 1a_des at the different temperatures were determined from the Debye model. They were fitted to the Arrhenius expression for a thermally activated process (Orbach, τ = τ0 exp(Ueff/kBT)). However, the plots of τ vs. 1/T deviate from linearity at low temperatures, indicating the coexistence of multiple relaxation pathways as observed in other anilate-based LnIII complexes (Fig. S16†). We, therefore, applied the general model where the first, second, third and fourth terms include quantum tunneling, direct, Raman and Orbach relaxation processes, respectively.τ−1 = τQTM−1 + AH2T + CTn + τ0−1 exp(−Ueff/KBT)\n\nAccurate fittings were obtained using Raman and Orbach relaxation processes with values comparable to those found in other anilate-based LnIII compounds with C = 16(7) s−1 K−5.3, τ0 = 5.0(5) × 10−10 s and Ueff = 39(2) K for 1a_des (Fig. S17†).16,20,37,38 The calculated value of n (5.3(3)) is smaller than the ideal value of 9 found for Raman processes. This suggests that these Raman-like relaxations are attributed to acoustic and optical vibrations.39 Finally, temperature dependence of the τ values of 1a was not fitted because of the lack of data points.\n\nThe AC susceptibility measurements of 1b show strong frequency-dependent peaks in both χ′ and χ′′ with the clear maxima of χ′′ below 4.2 K when a magnetic DC field of 0.1 T was applied (Fig. S18†). The variable-frequency AC data at different temperatures show the maxima of χ′′ at 160 Hz at 2 K and ca. 6000 Hz at 4 K (see Fig. S19†). Therefore, they indicate a field-induced slow relaxation of magnetization in agreement with theoretical calculations. The Cole–Cole plots (χ′′ vs. χ′) confirm the presence of a single relaxation process (see Fig. S20†). Thus, at fixed temperatures between 2.0 and 4.0 K, semi-circular plots were obtained and fitted using a generalized Debye model, yielding the α parameter in the range of 0.12–0.21. This indicates narrower distributions of the relaxation processes than in the case of 1a_des. Temperature dependence of the τ values of 1b was fitted using Raman and Orbach relaxation processes with values comparable to those found in 1a_des and other anilate-based LnIII compounds with C = 11(5) s−1 K−5.6, n = 5.6(4), τ0 = 2.0(5) × 10−9 s and Ueff = 42(3) K (Fig. S17†).16,20,35,36\n\nPhotoluminescence properties\n\nPhotoluminescence (PL) was excited using short laser pulses at a wavelength of 355 nm and analysed both spectrally and temporally. Near UV laser irradiation photoexcites the trz2An linker dianion in all compounds. ErIII emission sensitization then occurs via the optical antenna effect through a ligand-to-metal energy relaxation pathway. As clearly seen in , ligand-centred emission of 1a and 1b measured under standard conditions appeared considerably redshifted and quenched with respect to that of the ligand dianion trz2An in the (Ph4P)2trz2An reference compound. This was rationalized as the consequence of strong singlet/triplet intersystem mixing (heavy-atom effect), ensuing a ligand-centred excited state that quickly relaxes toward the LnIII ion by ligand-to-metal energy transfer.40 In fact, as deduced by three exponential fitting of the PL decay profile and amplitude averaging of the time constants, the bare excited-state lifetime of trz2An measured in (Ph4P)2(trz2An) lies in the time scale of hundreds of picoseconds (∼460 ps, ), whereas the ligand-centred emission of 1a is nearly resolution-limited, hinting towards a quantitative ligand-to-metal energy sensitization with nearly unity efficiency. Similar considerations hold for 1b, where a monoexponential PL lifetime of ∼30 ps was observed. At room temperature (295 K), 1a and 1a_des exhibited different ErIII-centred (4I13/2 → 4I15/2) emission spectra, readily interpreted as a consequence of the different coordination environment experienced by ErIII in the two compounds ( ). Cooling 1a_des under vacuum conditions down to 77 K resulted in higher spectral definition of the crystal-field-split 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 optical transitions ( ). Up to 13 transitions could be clearly detected and fairly well fitted using a multiple Gaussian fit procedure, thereby demonstrating a non-negligible presence of hot bands (starting from higher energy states of the 4I13/2 multiplet) still at 77 K.41 A direct comparison between the emission spectra at 295 and 77 K allowed for a tentative identification of the zero-phonon transition, which was observed at 1529 nm. In turn, this enabled a direct comparison between the observed transition wavelengths and those inferred from the theoretically calculated energy spectrum of the 4I15/2 multiplet. Despite the strong vibrational quenching of the ErIII emission from coordinated water molecules, effectively reducing the ErIII excited-state lifetime from milliseconds to tens of nanoseconds,421a and 1a_des could be quite clearly distinguished on the basis of the decay profiles of the ErIII-centred NIR PL, the amplitude-averaged lifetime (extracted from biexponential fits) being 55 ns in 1a and 86 ns in 1a_des ( ). This was ascribed to the different quenching produced by two coordinated water molecules in 1a and only one water molecule in 1a_des. Upon cooling at 77 K, the PL lifetime of 1a_des increased to 107 ns possibly due to partial suppression of vibrational quenching. The PL properties of 1a could not be measured at 77 K because the experimental technique used for cryogenic measurements involves 1a dehydration and consequent phase transition to 1a_des prior to cooling. As shown in , 1b displayed practically the same room-temperature ErIII-centred NIR emission spectrum, both in air and under vacuum, in agreement with the results of PXRD measurements and confirming the existence of only one phase. The decay profile of the NIR PL showed a much lower sensitivity to environmental conditions, which was in part expected since in 1b the vacuum does not modify the number of water molecules coordinated to the ErIII ions ( ). Comparison of the 295 and 77 K emission spectra ( ) led to the identification of the emission peak centred at 1524 nm as the most probable zero-phonon transition in 1b, allowing for comparison of experiment and theory just as for 1a_des.\n\nReversible phase transition from 1a to 1a_des was confirmed spectroscopically by performing several air/vacuum (rehydration/dehydration) cycles, where highly reproducible emission spectra and decay transients were obtained (see Fig. S21†). Overall, theoretical calculations of the ground (4I15/2) multiplet spectra turned out to be consistent with the low-temperature emission spectra, with regard to both the energy splitting between the first two levels and the whole energy spread within the multiplet. The agreement is quite impressive for 1b, as clearly seen in ."
