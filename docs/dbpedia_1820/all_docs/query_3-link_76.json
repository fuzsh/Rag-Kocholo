        "text": "The chapter presents a brief overview of the characteristics of current multilingualism as opposed to the multilingualism of the past. The three main distinctions of the current multilingualism are specified: (1) the fact that the new linguistic dispensation relates to and affects the post-modern society as a whole; (2) the intensive and multifarious interaction between the two main trends of current language dispensation. The complex interplay between the two trends is dynamic and includes the perceptions and treatment of English with, and in opposition to other languages. It seems that no language has ever before given rise to such fervent controversy or has been positioned so seriously and problematically against other languages. In addition, it appears that never before was there such a strong and wide-ranging mutual dependency of the two tendencies, the spread of English and the diversification of languages other than English. (3) Typically, a set of several languages as a unit, rather than one single language performs the essential functions of communication, information and cognition for contemporary humankind.\n\nThis book offers a comprehensive exploration of bilingualism and multilingualism, delving into topics such as code-switching, corpus linguistics, languages in contact, and language policies. Featuring chapters authored by participants of the International Summer School of Bilingualism and Multilingualism (ISSBM 2022), this collection showcases heterogeneous student research and perspectives on language acquisition and diversity. ISSBM 2022, a collaborative endeavor between the University of Nova Gorica (Slovenia) and the University of Udine (Italy), was supported by the European University for Cross-Border Knowledge Sharing (ACROSS) and the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD). Taking place at the Chemnitz University of Technology (Germany) from September 12-16, 2022, the summer school sought to discuss linguistic research and stimulate dialogue on bilingualism, multilingualism, and second language acquisition. Additionally, the book includes a methodological reflection on translanguaging, with ISSBM 2022 serving as the case study. This compilation of proceedings serves as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and practitioners interested in the multifaceted world of bilingualism and multilingualism."
