Jappalang (talk)\n\nGood advice, I think it is fixed now. — GabeMc (talk)\n\nWhy is Astoria in single quotes (\"... recorded on Gilmour's studio/houseboat the 'Astoria',\")? As a houseboat, I think it should be in italics. Furthermore, the vessel/home was linked earlier in the article via the word \"houseboat\", which was in a quote. I think this is a bit misleading, goes against the MOS (which advises against linking words of quotes), and could be avoided (clarified) by naming Astoria to the quote; i.e. \"... a summit meeting on the houseboat [the Astoria] with ...\". Note that the MOS also recommends that very long quotes (those with four or more sentences) should be in blockquotes. Jappalang (talk)\n\nGood advice, I think it is fixed now. — GabeMc (talk)\n\nI am a bit doubtful over the flying pig and laser effect photographs. Do they qualify for works of art that warrant copyright protection? If so, derivative copyright issues could result? They are non-permanent installations, so freedom of panorama would not apply to photographs of them. Since they are the primary focus in these photographs, de minimis cannot be called on in defense. Not certain though... Jappalang (talk)\n\nI swapped them out of the article to be sure. — GabeMc (talk)\n\nI have not yet gone deep into the prose, but the source reliability issues are most concerning FAC-wise. Jappalang (talk)\n\nThanks for your time and valuable insights, unless I missed one, all the sources are now WP:RS. — GabeMc (talk)\n\nAfter reading a bit more, I believe the prose is quite good. Waters's personal relationships section seems a bit skimpy though. Did he get along well with his family (considering the number of divorces)? Overall, I think it can be taken to FAC. Jappalang (talk)\n\nAs per, \"Waters's personal relationships section seems a bit skimpy\", yes, it is skimpy, sources on Waters' personal life are scarce. I would gladly expand the section if a suitable bio were ever written, but to my knowledge, none exist of Waters outside his inclusion in books about the Floyd. — GabeMc (talk)\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nI've listed this article for peer review because… although it is rather short, I'm considering sending it to FAC, and I'm wondering if it's just too short to be appropriate there. Additional issue is the large photograph, which I am very proud of getting (it took a fair amount of detective work by me and a Nixon Library staff member) and which is big, but would be a shame to crop or reduce.\n\nThanks, Wehwalt (talk)\n\nRuhrfisch comments: This is a really interesting and well done article (which I am not surprised by, given the quality of your other work I have seen). I was already somewhat familiar with the story, but think there are a few places where a bit more information could be added to flesh things out. Here are some suggestions for improvement.\n\nI love the large image of the float and Nixon in the reviewing stand and definitely think it should be kept in the article. I also like all of the images (kudos for finding the float image and for the road trip to beautiful Deshler, Ohio). However, I do not think any of the current images are a great lead image. I see there is already a cropped version showing just Cole and Nixon at File:Cropped Bring Us Together.jpg and think this would make a great lead image. It shows Cole and Nixon and a replica of the original sign, and I think using it as the lead image would help the reader find Nixon more easily in the large image later in the article (I had to look a little bit to be sure I'd found him). I have no problem with having the crop and the original both in the article.\n\nIf for some reason the cropped image is not used as the lead photo, what about an image of Nixon, either on the day of his victory speech (if a free image is available) or from his inauguration day? As it is, Deshler is not mentioned in the lead (but should be), and then the lead image has only the cryptic caption \"Deshler Elementary School (previously Deshler High and Grade School)\" My guess is that most people read the lead or look at the images first, and having an image of Nixon's face as the lead would identify the article pretty quickly.\n\nI like the caption for the fire station as it relates it to the article nicley. I would try to do that for the school image, and the station image too - looking at Google Earth, the double tracks lead west, the single track in front of the station runnning left-right is the north-south track (right is north). The north-south track is the one which a train coming from Lima would have taken, so my guess is Nixon's train came in from the left on the tracks running across the image and departed to go north to Toledo by pulling out to the right.\n\nI also note that there was a news photo of Cole and her (redone) sign from the AP in several newspapers, such as this one after the election and before the inauguration. I have no idea if that would be justified as a fair use image (it may be the copyright was never renewed and it is free). If it could be used, this might be a good lead image.\n\nI see the upright parameter is used for the Deshler images - I think this makes them look too small, especially with the enormous float image in the article. Can they just be thumb sized?\n\nAs mentioned with captions, I would include Deshler in the lead. I think I would probably include the day of the whistle stop tour in the lead too.\n\nI think the article could use some more background to better provide context to the reader. These are probably only a sentence or maybe two for each point, but I think they would help make the article comprehensive (a FAC criterion).\n\nI would identify who Nixon's opponent was, and explain who LBJ was too (since he's in the quote). Otherwise someone not very familiar with the era might imagine Nixon was running against LBJ instead of his VP, HHH.\n\nI would also give some background information on Nixon's campaign and the whistle stop tour that day. Campaigning by train was something of an anachronism even then, and there is a nice contemporary New York Times article from page 1, describing the whistle stop tour Nixon Intensifies Blows at Humphrey On Ohio Train Tour, R. W. Apple Jr., Oct 23, 1968. Again this could be two sentences - the article describes the distance covered, the number of cars and engines in the train, the number of people on board and stops made, even gives what Nixon's speech was about in Deshler (crime is bad).\n\nThe Safire entry has some nice material on how the slogan resonated in a time of civil strife and division, and I think it would be worth including a little bit on that. It also mentions how the Democrats thought to use a similar slogan early in the campaign and abandoned it, which be worth including. Again, to someone familiar with the story, this is clear, but it is over 40 years ago now and many people will be fuzzy on exactly what the social scene was like then.\n\nI also think it could be made a bit clearer that Nixon was on the last car of the train when he spoke, facing the crowd from the train and somewhat above it, and that the ropes to hold the crowd back also let the train pull in safely.\n\nI would say that Deshler is in northwest Ohio and perhaps give the distance to Toledo, as Joe the Plumber is also from northwest Ohio, specifically Holland, a suburb of Toledo. The Greene ref points out the geographical closeness of the two incidents.\n\nI also think that I would call Bob Greene a columnist rather than a reporter - this may be just be because I do not like the man, but he is mostly known as a columnist and seems to do relatively little hard news reporting\n\nWhen I looked to see if I could find a photo of the rally / whistle stop, I found the NYT article and the picture of Cole linked above. I also found that there were a few brief stories where her opinion on Nixon was reported afterwards. I think it might be worth while to include these somehow - not only did Nixon's opponents use the phrase against him, but reporters checked on this young woman's opinion every so often and published it.\n\nDecember 3, 1969 - doing great so far (pay per view, did not read all of it)\n\nMay 12, 1970 story - still has faith in Nixon\n\nJuly 17, 1972 story - invited to work in Nixon's 1972 campaign\n\nJanuary 17, 1973 story - not invited to second Nixon inauguration\n\nAugust 9, 1974 - has no comment on Nixon now\n\nThis is just an odd coincidence, but Truman made a whistle stop in Deshler in the 1948 campaign. Not sure it is worth including in the article, but thought you might like the tidbit - see here\n\nHope this helps. If my comments are useful, please consider peer reviewing an article, especially one at Wikipedia:Peer review/backlog. I do not watch peer reviews, so if you have questions or comments, please contact me on my talk page. Yours, Ruhrfisch ><>°°\n\nI will work on these. Yes, I had been thinking a background/campaign section would be in order. I've found Cole's opinion as late as 1977, in the LA Times. I don't really want to focus on her, I want the focus to be on the slogan. She is a large part of it, of course (by the way, I am a little skeptical about her story, personally. Why did no one ever interview the classmate who laughed at the sign? Did she/he exist?). Nixon also visited Deshler in 1960, btw., he was very fond of these train tours (which he did in 1952 as well and possibly in other years). The reason Deshler was such a popular place to visit was because of the intersection of train lines. Excellent and well focused comments. I will probably not run this article at FAC until around November 1, as I am planning to go back to the Nixon Library in October and want to see if they have more clippings on this whole thing.--Wehwalt (talk)\n\nIf you keep only the current images, I would make the train station the lead image, as that is the most relevant of the Deshler images (IMO). I think a sentence or two on Cole's subsequent history would be useful - perhaps something like \"After the inauguration, Cole was interviewed at least six time for her opinion on Nixon between 1969 and 1977. Although she was invited to work on Nixon's reelection campaign in 1972, she was not invited to his second inaugural.\" It seems like people did not question her story then, so they did not ask her alibi witness(es). If she was going to lie, I suppose she could have just said she wrote her own sign all along. The world may never know... Ruhrfisch ><>°°\n\nThis looks great - I have two very minor nitpicks.\n\nIn the lead the sentence The sign was seen by Nixon or a member of his staff, and, after the election, President-elect Nixon mentioned the sign and adopted the phrase \"Bring Us Together\" in his victory speech as representing his administration's initial goals. might be objected to in FAC as it seems to indicate Nixon only mentioned the sign after the election (when the article makes it clear that he did so before at Madison Square Garden about a week after the Deshler stop).\n\nI understand the Joe the Plumber sentence, but it is a bit long and a bit awkwrd and I stumble a little every time I read it. Could it be smoothed out somehow? Not sure if it needs to be split or not. Please let me know when this is at FAC, and thanks for teaching me a lot about a subject I only knew a little about. Ruhrfisch ><>°°\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nThis is frequently visited technology page and an important subject.

Any help on this would be appreciative.\n\nThanks, Chris (talk)\n\nComments by Jappalang\n\nLead\n\nIt feels like the first sentence is having too much physical location squeezed in. The second is particularly long. Perhaps this can be restructured by taking out the Fitzsimmons Creek from the first sentence, combining it with the front few clauses of the second to form a new second sentence (describing the Centre's location in the Creek).\n\n- Done. Chris (talk)\n\nBest check the grammar, the creek is a mountain?\n\nThe creek is adjacent to the mountain. Fixed. Chris (talk)\n\nUmm, I do not see the fix... Regardless, I suggest changing\n\n\"Located on the lowermost slopes of Blackcomb Mountain near Fitzsimmons Creek, one of two ski mountains forming the Whistler Blackcomb resort, this venue hosted the bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton (individual sport where you slide down the track head first) competitions for the 2010 Winter Olympics, which was co-hosted by Vancouver and the Resort Municipality of Whistler.\"\n\nto\n\n\"The centre is part of the Whistler Blackcomb resort, which comprises two ski mountains separated by Fitzsimmons Creek.

Chris (talk)\n\nThose not familiar with the sport might wonder what is a \"start house\".\n\n- Explained. Chris (talk)\n\nWhat are \"Skeleton competitions\"? It could lead to misreading \"two skeleton races racers\" in a Dungeons and Dragons context... the funny side of such a misunderstanding leads me to think of Wikipedia:Randy in Boise.\n\n- Competitions changed to races.

Jappalang (talk)\n\n\"Safety concerns have affected the track design for the Russian National Sliding Centre that will be used for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.\"\n\nSo how is this related to Whistler?

Chris (talk)\n\nSeveral sections are long paragraphs; can they be broken into smaller paragraphs?\n\n- Splits have occurred in four sections, mostly history. Chris (talk)\n\nSeveral \"... with noun plus -ing ...\" constructs; please see User:Tony1/Noun plus -ing on issues with this construct.\n\nI have looked at every single item in the article looking for \"... with noun plus-ing ...\" and could not find any. Can you be a little more specific on this? Chris (talk)\n\nI found only two of them and both have been fixed. Chris (talk)\n\nAs such, I believe the article needs a further copy-edit.\n\nCopyedit process done except for track records lead. Have contacted the Slding Centre itself to rectify this. Chris (talk)\n\nAs a follow-up to this, the Sliding Centre told me to contact the FIL-Luge office. An e-mail was sent to them today. Chris (talk)\n\nWhy are almost every participant or competitor listed in the sentences? \"Such as\" and \"included\" are not lists; 2 or 3 examples are more than sufficient.\n\nNumber of competitors reduced in First testing and ceritifcation section. Chris (talk)\n\nThere are still quite many names in that section (bobsleigh has 6, skeleton has 5). Jappalang (talk)\n\nReduced to four for luge, three for bobsleigh, and three for skeleton per request. Chris (talk)\n\nDoes \"2010 Winter Olympics\" need this much information on the competitions? I can understand the issues that surround Kumaritashvili, but the races? Would that not be better covered in the Olympics article instead?\n\nLuge and skeleton covered on this. Reviewing bobsleigh now and will cut this section down accordingly. Chris (talk)\n\nBobsleigh has also been cut down. Chris (talk)\n\nI do not think it has been cut down enough. To me, it still reads as if every effort has been expended to cram all events into this section (why should disqualifications \"for violating the total weight rule\" matter for this track). I think it might be better to structure and summarize this section in a way that speaks of how many crashes there were, why they were due to the track, and what effects the crashes had on the track. Jappalang (talk)\n\nSkeleton disqualifications removed per request. Bobsleigh further analyzed and weight disqualifications removed per request. Other parts of the section reviewed and tweaked. Chris (talk)\n\n\"Strămăturaru's sister Raluca, who had completed her run before her sister and made it through without issue, rushed to the end of the observation deck to know about her condition as the public address announcer directed medical personnel to the scene. Violeta later withdrew before the event while Raluca finished 21st.\": Does Raluca's actions warrant this much detail when the article's subject about the track and not the event? Jappalang (talk)\n\nRaluca removed, but Violeta kept. Chris (talk)\n\nIf abbreviations are only used once (when the full name is mentioned) in the article, then they do not need to be abbreviated in the first place.\n\nSingle abbreviation listings removed per request. Chris (talk)\n\nWhy are there double commas in the Infobox? Jappalang (talk)\n\nChanged to breaks in the Infobox. Chris (talk)\n\nThey are still there: \"... Jon Montgomery (CAN) (Skeleton), , Both 2010 ...\", \"... Felix Loch (GER), , 2009)\", etc. Why is \"Both\" capitalized? Jappalang (talk)\n\nBoth removed. Periods are there as part of the infobox. Chris (talk)\n\nInfobox switched out from motorsports venue to stadium venue to avoid track record issue. Chris (talk)\n\nImage\n\nFile:Whistler Sliding Centre-track map english.svg\n\nOn what information/sources is the track layout based on?\n\nAccording to the Summary listing, it was based on the track map listed at the 2010 Winter Olympics website of the track map itself. Chris (talk)\n\nSomehow, I feel that perhaps omitting certain specifics could make for a more compact yet accessible article. Much is already there for FA, but polishing is perhaps what it needs now. Jappalang (talk)\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nI've listed this article for peer review because I think the article covers a variety of information abut the topic. The singer's history is well referenced and the topic covers all the major milestones theyshe had in her career.\n\nThanks, Tr33 swalow (talk)\n\nThis was opened by a user now blocked as a sockpuppet of the main contributor, who is banned from Wikipedia. Per discussion at Wikipedia talk:Peer review, this has been archived. Ruhrfisch ><>°°\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nI've listed this article for peer review because I would like to nominate it at WP:GAN, but I would like to know what is missing, esecially with the prose. Many thanks, TbhotchTalk C.\n\nFinetooth comments: This isn't quite ready for GAN, but it can get there. Here are a few suggestions for further improvement.\n\nI've never written an article about a music single, and I don't know exactly what the criteria are. Even so, it appears to me that the existing article has too many tables and that some of the information in them is repetitious or unnecessary. For example, \"Credits and personnel\" includes details about two songs other than \"Better in Time\"; if you deleted those details, the list would become much more succinct.\n\nAs a double A-side both song's personnel are needed, since those are discussed in the article, the same for \"You Bring Me Down\". TbhotchTalk C.\n\nIt's often helpful to look a featured articles to see how other editors have handled similar topics. WP:FA#Music has quite a few articles about singles. I've looked at several to examine the tables and charts, and they tend to be fairly simple and straightforward. See Hey Jude, for example.\n\nPassive voice. The article includes passive-voice sentences that would be stronger in active voice. For example, \"Background and composition\" begins with \"On 29 January 2008 the announcement that \"Better in Time\", along with \"Footprints in the Sand\", would be launched as double A-side singles on 10 March 2010 was made by Lewis's website.\" Much punchier would be: \"On 29 January 2008, Lewis announced on her website that \"Better in Time\", along with \"Footprints in the Sand\", would be launched as double A-side singles on 10 March 2010.\" The next sentence reads, \"Later the next month, they were selected as the official singles of the 2008 Sport Relief, a biennial charity organized by Comic Relief and BBC Sport.\" Better would be: \"Later the next month, 2008 Sport Relief, a biennial charity organized by Comic Relief and BBC Sport, selected them as their official singles.\" I'd suggest going through the whole article looking for similar passive constructions and re-casting them in active voice.\n\nBoth changed, but I'll left the GAN reviewer to check it. TbhotchTalk C.\n\nI found and fixed a few small errors, but I'm sure I didn't catch them all. It would be good to enlist the aid of a proofreader or copyeditor before heading to GAN.\n\nThank you for that, I'll take care about that. TbhotchTalk C.\n\nLead\n\n\"It was written by Andrea Martin and J. R. Rotem, and produced by the last.\" - Active and slightly more clear might be \"Andrea Martin and J.R. Rotem wrote the song, and Rotem produced it.\"\n\nNot done \"and Rotem produced it. It was...\" the double \"it\" does not sounds good. TbhotchTalk C.\n\nLyrically, \"Better in Time\" tells the history of a girl who cannot forget her ex-partner, and after all she knows that \"it will all get better in time. - Maybe \"and who knows that... \" would be more clear.\n\nadded TbhotchTalk C.\n\n\"The single achieved to be certified gold... \" - \"Achieved to be\" is a bit awkward. Maybe just \"was\"? Ditto for the same construction a couple of sentences later?\n\nchanged. TbhotchTalk C.\n\n\"after all she knows that \"it will all get better in time\". - Direct quotations, even if they are repeated in the main text, need in-line citations. One way to avoid having to source them twice is to paraphrase them in the lead and use the direct quote only once, with an in-line citation, in the main text.\n\nThe lead should summarize the article, sources are not needed there because it is supposed that they are in the text. TbhotchTalk C.\n\n\"it shows how Lewis performs in front of 'unrelated photographic set-ups' and shows what goes on behind the scenes.\" - It's not clear what the meaning of \"unrelated photographic set-ups\" might be. It's also not clear what \"shows what goes on behind the scenes\" might refer to. Specific examples would help make these two concepts more clear.\n\nI'm not an English speaker, but I understood the term \"unrelated photographic set-ups\"— in words of the BBC—. The writter tried to say, like television or a film set, that it was based on what's going on the set while Leona is in it. Personally, I would add this description, but is WP:OR. TbhotchTalk C.\n\nChart performance\n\n\"Better in Time\"/\"Footprints in the Sand\" - The Manual of Style suggests using something other than the front slash for combinations like this. Would \"Better in Time\" and \"Footprints in the Sand\" be OK?\n\nchanged. TbhotchTalk C.\n\n\"While \"Better in Time\" entered to the country chart... \" - \"Entered to\" sounds odd. Delete \"to\"?\n\nremoved. TbhotchTalk C.\n\nImages\n\nThe image of Lewis with the horse is awfully dark. Is it worth keeping? Couldn't the concept of \"unrelated photographic setup\" better be explained in words? What is the point of these setups? What are some of the others?\n\ntry the previous .TbhotchTalk C.\n\nTrack listings and formats\n\nReplace front slashes with \"and\"?\n\nDone TbhotchTalk C.\n\nReferences\n\nSomething is missing from the title in citation 3.\n\nFixed TbhotchTalk C.\n\nNotes\n\nThis probably should be renamed something like \"Works cited\".\n\nNot done Unneeded. 02:53, 18 September 2010 (UTC)\n\nThe book data should include the place of publication.\n\nDone TbhotchTalk C.\n\nI hope these suggestions prove helpful. If so, please consider reviewing another article, especially one from the PR backlog at WP:PR; that is where I found this one. I don't usually watch the PR archives or check corrections or changes. If my comments are unclear, please ping me on my talk page. Finetooth (talk)\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nI've listed this article for peer review because… I would like to areas of improvement for getting this article listed as a GA. Thanks, Zuggernaut (talk)\n\nLooks pretty good to me. I have a few style comments:\n\nthere are a few disambig links that should be fixed: [3]\n\none external link appears to be dead: [4]\n\nthe capitalisation of the titles in the References section should be in accordance with WP:MOSCAPS#Composition titles\n\nper Wikipedia:MOS#Dates ordinal suffixes with dates\n\nthe peer review script indicates that there are some contractions in the article such as \"weren't\". Generally contractions shouldn't be used unless they are direct quotes;\n\nthe References should be sorted into alphabetical order by author's surname;\n\nthere is an inconsistent date format in the article. For instance, \"January 1, 1818\", or \"1st of January 1818\" in the Flight of the Peshwa section. Consistency is the key, but you need to bear in mind that ordinal suffixes shouldn't be used, so I suggest \"January 1, 1818\";\n\n\"suzerainty\" should be linked, as it is a word that some readers might not understand;\n\nthe final part of the End of the war and its effects section should have a citation;\n\ndo you have any casualty figures? If so, they should probably be added to the infobox;\n\nthe End of the war and its effects section is very large, could you perhaps split the paragraph a bit?\n\nthe time format is not consistent with the WP:MOS#Times, for instance in the Subjugation of Holkar section, \"nine AM\" should be \"9:00 am\" (making sure to include the non breaking space). AustralianRupert (talk)\n\nLooks like a good start. Things to work on:\n\nAssume your reader is a 12-year-old American child with a modern atlas. Does this person know who Shivaji (mentioned in first paragraph without explanation) is?\n\nI think you need at least a paragraph describing in a little more detail the history of the Marathas (and specifically their relations with the British) in the 18th century. Presumably there are roots of conflict that are deeper than the proximate casus belli mentioned? (At one point you mention the war as \"mopping up\" after the second war, but give little background on the nature and course of that war.)\n\nThe article needs maps depicting campaign movements, not just geographic maps. File:India british expansion 1805a.jpg might be a good starting point, but I have no visual sense of what part of the subcontinent is the actual theater of war, and how forces moved within it.\n\nThis period in Indian history uses terminology that will be unfamiliar to casual readers from other cultures. Brief clauses explaining for example that the Peshwa was the nominal ruler of the empire, and what a \"resident\" is are necessary; do not assume that readers will click through to a linked page for these and other terms, like Pindari and Nizam (neither of which is explained or linked at first mention).\n\nYou use \"third anglo-maratha war\" several times in the article; this is unnecessary, we already know the name of the war. (If you have to distinguish from other wars, use a phrase like \"this war\" instead of \"the war\".)\n\nA war (or campaign) article should provide context for specific actions, and (in my opinion) be short on battle details, unless strategy or larger outcomes hinge on those details. Many campaigns consist of movements with few or no major battles; this is what you need to tell about here. The section \"Subjugation of Holkar\" is lacking in context; if I want a detailed description of the battle, I'll click through to the battle; tell me where Holkar is and why, and how and why the British came to target him and bring him to battle. I have no sense of where British and Maratha forces were concentrated to begin their campaigns, and where they went, or were intending to go when battles were engaged.\n\nIn a good way, many or most of the Indian leaders are named. Less so with the British, who are often faceless and nameless. Who led the forces against the Pindaris?\n\nThe British are sometimes referred to as \"English\".\n\nIn \"The Pindaris\" you say that Shinde and Holkar lost their territories in the second war. In the next paragraph you say that Shinde and Holkar are sheltering the Pindaris in their territory. Something is not right with this...\n\nYou never actually link in text the first two wars.\n\nWere there internal disagreements among the Marathas that are important to mention? the British?\n\nI don't know how strong your English is; the article definitely needs thorough copyediting.\n\n--Magic♪piano\n\nA lot of work's clearly gone into this.\n\nThe Khadki battleground is described, but the article could usefully tell the reader more about the general terrain of the campaign - is the region mountainous, desert, jungle etc.?\n\nYou mention that there were infantry, cavalry and guns, and that the British had higher technology, but the article might usefully explain a little bit more about what the armies were equipped with or what that higher technology was.\n\nThe British East India company is mentioned in the infobox, but in the prelude you talk about the British Empire - I think the two were different entities?\n\nI'd echo the recommendations above for getting some help with the copyediting - a lot of the language being used isn't quite right and detracts from the considerable research that's gone into the article.\n\nHchc2009 (talk)\n\nI think you have already received enough suggestions, so I won't burden you with many more. I really looked at the article as I am fascinated by the British Raj. Then I saw the phrase:\n\n\"...the armies lost battles and got slaughtered when a(<-delete) they encountered a river, unable to discover fjords or locate boats.\"\n\nI wondered about that. I suggest that it needs a bit more explanation. Perhaps dates and who the enemy was. Not too much though, as the article isn't about that. On the other hand, it might be better to just delete that phrase completely.\n\nYou also use the term \"fjords.\" Is that appropriate to India? I though that term was just applied in Scandinavia?\n\nMy major criticism, and I didn't look to see if this was already suggested, is that your Reference section is not alphabetized by author. This makes the references difficult to find. Thomas R. Fasulo (talk)\n\nI've made all of the recommended changes except:\n\ndo you have any casualty figures? If so, they should probably be added to the infobox;\n\nSeparate numbers for the various battles of the war are available but I thought adding them to obtain a casualty number for the war might amount to OR. I will keep looking for a source that gives a direct total number for the entire war. Zuggernaut (talk)\n\nI've made all the recommended changes except the following two items:\n\nThe article needs maps depicting campaign movements, not just geographic maps. File:India british expansion 1805a.jpg might be a good starting point, but I have no visual sense of what part of the subcontinent is the actual theater of war, and how forces moved within it.\n\nA war (or campaign) article should provide context for specific actions, and (in my opinion) be short on battle details, unless strategy or larger outcomes hinge on those details. Many campaigns consist of movements with few or no major battles; this is what you need to tell about here. The section \"Subjugation of Holkar\" is lacking in context; if I want a detailed description of the battle, I'll click through to the battle; tell me where Holkar is and why, and how and why the British came to target him and bring him to battle. I have no sense of where British and Maratha forces were concentrated to begin their campaigns, and where they went, or were intending to go when battles were engaged.\n\nI'm currently working on these and will continue looking for a map. Zuggernaut (talk)\n\nThe background material is significantly improved, I have a much better sense of who the players are; good work. For maps, if there are not period campaign maps to be found, you may have to make your own, using a more general roughly-period map either as a background, or something from which to trace boundary lines on a more schematic map. This can be done using Inkscape; see Battle of Ridgefield and Battle of The Cedars for maps I made using these techniques. Magic♪piano\n\nI've provided the context for the Holkar sub-section and locations/headquarters of all other Maratha leaders. The only item pending now is:\n\nThe article needs maps depicting campaign movements, not just geographic maps. File:India british expansion 1805a.jpg might be a good starting point, but I have no visual sense of what part of the subcontinent is the actual theater of war, and how forces moved within it.\n\nI will look at Inkscape and make the maps over the next week or two.\n\nThe geography was vast - I've made some changes and added terrain information for each Maratha leader's territory separately at the beginning of this section Third_Anglo-Maratha_War#Commencement\n\nThat makes it clearer. Hchc2009 (talk)\n\nI could not find too much information on the technology of the weapons of Marathas but I found some saying what they didn't have and that they mostly imported artillery. I've made those changes here -- Third_Anglo-Maratha_War#Prelude\n\nThat made it clearer for me. Hchc2009 (talk)\n\nNomenclature changes - The British East India company is now mentioned consistently, references to the British Empire are taken off. Zuggernaut (talk)\n\nOne subtlety that is often glossed over in histories of 18th century India is that some of the forces used were in fact British Army regiments; they were certainly present in some Indian conflicts of that time. I don't know if this is true of this conflict; I'd suspect it to be so. This would mean that the UK (and not just the BEIC) was also a participant in the war at some level. (P.S. the commanders in the infobox need fixing. I don't think Warren Hastings (d. 1818 in England) was involved; perhaps a different Hastings?) Magic♪piano\n\nI'm slightly confused about the whole UK-EIC-English-British nomenclature because I've found that some sources even refer to them as \"English\". To my knowledge using \"English\" is incorrect. Buy maybe it has to do with the history of the UK at that time? It looks like it was the different Hastings you've linked to. I will make that change. Zuggernaut (talk)\n\n\"English\" is definitely deprecated usage, at least for events since 1707. As far as EIC vs. UK, my understanding is at best incomplete, but goes like this. Before the passage of the India Act 1784 the EIC operated nominally independently of UK policy, but the need for Crown troops and collateral effects of company actions on diplomacy led to that act, which effectively put the government in control of the company, which continued to exist (until the 1857 rebellion, I guess). I don't know if or when the distinction between Crown and company troops was erased; it was certainly not at the time of Cornwallis in the 1790s, when the difference (over relative rank and pay between the two) was one of the problems he left behind. I'd be surprised if the large number of troops Hastings amassed did not include Crown or former Crown troops (this was peacetime in Europe, just after Napoleon). It should at some point be clear that such troops were present in India; details are of course for campaign or battle articles. Magic♪piano\n\nFixed fjords, provided more explanation why the armies got slaughtered.\n\nArranged references in alphabetical order. Zuggernaut (talk)\n\nI would like to see a little information about the Bombay Council and the Calcutta Council. What were these councils, and why were they at odds with each other?\n\nYou mention the \"foresight and persistence\" of Warren Hastings but we are not told what exactly he did. Could you provide some details? --Diannaa (Talk)\n\nYou state the Peshwa fled until January 1, but the battle was also on January 1 so that cannot be correct. Please check your sources and fix the date. I have marked the spot with a {{contradiction-inline}} tag.\n\nWhat do the words \"inam\" and \"watan\" mean? You do not define them, and we have no articles. --Diannaa (Talk)\n\nA lot of the material in the last three paragraphs appears to have been lifted directly from the sources. This is of course a copyright violation. Please re-work this material and put it in your own words. The last paragraph appears to have been lifted directly from MacDonald. And some in the first has come directly from Hunter and some from Black. I have removed the entire last section and it will all have to be re-worked, so sorry.\n\nCopy edits are now completed. --Diannaa (Talk)\n\nThe last three paragraphs have been rephrased or removed. Explanation for Watan and Inam has beeen provided in the form of footnotes. I will work on the remaining (first 3) bullet items over the next few days. Zuggernaut (talk)\n\nKeep up the good work. Regards, --Diannaa (Talk)\n\nIn the 18th century were the places called Bombay, Chennai, calcutta. Had the British taken them over and renamed them yet?\n\nArticle talks about Maharashtra as though it existed in the old days\n\nPage format in the footnotes were inconsistent wrt p and pp, and also things like 216-7 and 226-227. Also some of them need to be switched to ndashes YellowMonkey (new photo poll)\n\nSources confirm the names Bombay Council, Calcultta Council and administrative units such as Bombay Presidency, Madras Presidency are mentioned for our time period of interest (1817-1819).\n\nMaharashtra is mentioned independently twice - I will change that to Maratha Empire or something more appropriate. It is mentioned in conjunction with phrases like \"modern state of Maharashtra\" in 1 or 2 more places which doesn't seem inaccurate.\n\nWill fix the p/pp, numbering and dashes. Any links/help on how to run scripts to fix dashes? Thanks. Zuggernaut (talk)\n\nI used this script on the dashes. Sometimes it misses a few, but it usually gets most of them. AustralianRupert (talk)\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nI've listed this article for peer review because this article was nominated for GAR in July, but has been unstable since then. I want to get this article in good shape so that it can go through the GAR process and pass. There is work to be done on this article, and it needs a fresh look from editors who have not been involved in editing it and who are familiar with peer review and GA criteria. I was not the nominator for GAR, and I did not create the article.\n\nThanks, Minor4th\n\nComments by Polargeo\n\nThis article is not too far from GA but appears to be part of a general battleground which a current arbcom case is looking at Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Climate change. This does not really require peer review but meditation before GA status can be conveyed. Polargeo (talk)\n\nRuhrfisch comments: Interesting article, but I think it needs somewhat more work before it is ready for WP:GAN, aside from any edit wars / arbcom cases, etc. Here are some suggestions for improvement and thanks for working on this article.\n\nPer WP:LEAD, the lead should be an accessible and inviting overview of the whole article. Nothing important should be in the lead only - since it is a summary, it should all be repeated in the body of the article itself. However, there are somethings in the lead like the year the website was founded, that are only in the lead and infobox, but not in the body of the article itself.\n\nSimilarly, as a summary, my rule of thumb is to include every header in the lead in some way, but I do not really see how the \"Temperature records project\" section is in the lead.\n\nI think it is important in a History section to focus on the creator of the website and the mechanics of the website itself too. A bit of background on Watts would help to provide context to the reader, and how can this be a history if it does not include the start date?\n\nI would also include, if they are know, Watts' reasons for starting the blog in the first place - what motivated him to begin this? As it is, the History section begins in media res\n\nI would also include things like the structure of the website - when were moderators added? Who are the contributors besides Watts? What kind of traffic does it get? What kinds of forums are available for readers or for people to post at? We are told about a moderator in the Climategate section and Alexa rankings in 2010, and some is mentioned in the lead, but any more details in the article body would help.\n\nThe article should not include URLs in the text (surface stations) - that is what refs are for\n\nThe 2010 and Reception sections are very choppy - almost all one or two sentence short paragraphs, and almost no narrative flow. Can these be made into more of a story as to what is going on?\n\nSome refs are incomplete - 9 is just a title and 20 just a URL. Internet refs need URL, title, author if known, publisher and date accessed. {{cite web}} and other cite templates may be helpful. See WP:CITE and WP:V\n\nMake sure the refs used meet WP:RS - I have no idea if they do, but that is one way to avoid some controversy. Newspaper refs seems good, not sure on the others.\n\nAny chance for a free image? I looked at the article on Mr. Watts to see if there was one of him, and see he runs the Surface stations website too - this should be clearly stated in this article.\n\nWP:NPOV issues will be crucial here - are there repsonses to the websites' positions on all this that critque them?\n\nHope this helps. If my comments are useful, please consider peer reviewing an article, especially one at Wikipedia:Peer review/backlog (which is how I found this article). I do not watch peer reviews, so if you have questions or comments, please contact me on my talk page. Yours, Ruhrfisch ><>°°\n\nThank you for your comments Ruhrfisch. I think the editors of that article do not have this page watchlisted. I am going to link to this page on the WUWT article talk page and copy this post of yours for more exposure among the editors who are active on the article. Minor4th\n\nComments by Geometry guy\n\nBoth the lead and the article have \"In addition to its creator/founder, the blog...\" which mismatches the noun clause with the subject rather than the object of the sentence.\n\nWikilinks do not need to be repeated within a section: this happens with Christopher Monkton and Judith Curry for example.\n\nIt does not seem helpful or encyclopedic to describe Christopher Monkton as \"outspoken\". (There are spacing problems here too, and elsewhere in the article.)\n\nThe reader may first discover that Watts is a TV and radio meteorologist in The Times quote. The principle of least surprise may be a good guide.\n\nThe article is poorly structured. For instance \"Reception\" and \"History\" should not be conflated. (This would be a clear GA fail.)\n\nPatrick Michaels' credentials are misleading in that he is sceptical about AGW.\n\nThe first paragraph of \"Temperature records project\" is not well sourced; the second paragraph goes off-topic. (This would be a clear GA fail.)\n\nIn terms of general disagreements about the article and related topics, I have two comments:\n\nWikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a political journal or a news source; encyclopedic writing involves stepping back and looking at a topic from a distance (try to imagine how it would be viewed in 5 years time);\n\nIn an article written from the neutral point of view (which is a point of view) it should be hard to tell what the point of view of the editors is (beyond their support for the neutral point of view).\n\nGeometry guy\n\nThanks for your comments. Can you expand a bit on the \"history\" and \"reception\" -- I don't think any of the other editors are working on these items, and I'd like to address them as much as I can. I was starting to work on the structure and moving things around a bit, and I was thinking of making the \"History\" section more of a background section or general information section but didn't know what to title it. The reviews, awards, reception, criticism was all dumped in one section that served as a catch-all for one sentence bits that didn't fit together well. I'd like to work these items throughout the article if I can find a place for them. Further comments would be welcome. I have never worked on GA or addressing peer review. Minor4th\n\nThe first step would be to start a new section, entitled \"Reception\" or something similar. Move to that section both objective and subjective reviews of the site: objective reviews include webtraffic statistics, while subjective reviews include comments on the quality or popularity of the site in other sources. The history section could be retitled \"Background\", \"Origins\", or something similar. Geometry guy\n\nOk, so would the History/Background section then just be info about how the blog started and when it moved to a new host, added contribs, etc? Where in the order of subheadings would you put the Reception section? And what about notable content or notable guest writers? I'll figure it out if you dont care to keep commenting, but your input is appreciated. Minor4th\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nI am of the belief that this article may meet the criteria for B-class. I would like a second opinion verifying this.\n\nThanks, Tyrol5 [Talk]\n\nBrianboulton comments: In my view this article as it stands is probably borderline for a B. Assuming you want to lift the article's quality beyond that, here are some suggestions for you to consider:-\n\nChoice of title\n\nThe name \"Taurus Littrow\" means nothing to the great majority of people - it could refer to anything. If they knew the article was about a lunar valley they would much more likely be drawn to it. Have you considered adding the words (lunar valley) to the title?\n\nDone - Added \"(lunar valley)\" to the end of title.\n\nProse\n\nThere is rather too much reliance on links to explain names or terms which will be unfamiliar to the general reader, e.g. \"Tycho\", \"regolith\", \"ejecta\" etc. Readers shouldn't have to keep leaving the article to follow links in order to maintain their understanding. Some technical terms are unavoidable, and I'm not suggesting that every one be explained, but a little more clarity would be helpful.\n\nDone\n\nSome of the prose needs polishing. The following are samples and should not be taken as a complete list of required prose fixes:-\n\nThe first sentence is under-punctuated and has too many clauses, yet neglects to give a date for the Apollo 17 mission, information which is pretty vital for the sense of the sentence.\n\nDone\n\nThe last sentence in the lead reads: \"The valley was named by the crew of Apollo 17, and was subsequently adopted by the IAU in 1973.\" That reads as though the valley was adopted by the IAU. Needs rephrasing. IAU should be spelt out.\n\nDone\n\nOverall the lead is very brief, and needs to be expanded so that it is a more complete summary of the article.\n\nDone\n\nThe first sentemce of the \"Formation and geography\" section reads: \"The Taurus-Littrow valley is geologically diverse in that during its formation, lavas welled upward from the Moon's interior.\" It will not be obvious to the general reader why lavas welling upwards from the moon's interior leads to geological diversity. The next sentence begins \"As a result of this...\" It's not clear what \"this\" is referring to. Also in this paragraph you should mention that Cernan and Schmitt were members of the Apollo 17 mission.\n\nDone\n\nLater in the article, in the Composition section, we have: \"There are several geologic deposits on the valley floor originating from several different events in the geologic timeline of the Moon. One of these, the light mantle,...\" Again, what does \"these\" refer to? I imagine it means the geological deposits, but as written it seems to be referring to the \"several different events\".\n\nDone\n\nClunky: \"As Apollo 17 was the final lunar mission of the Apollo program, several scientific objectives were identified and several sites previously considered were given consideration again.\"\n\nDone\n\nImages\n\nI liked the photographs very much. However, the geological map, in the absence of any description or key, is not useful.\n\nDone Color key added.\n\nCitations\n\nThe article is rather lightly cited. The first two paragraphs of the Formation and geography section have no citations at all, and the same is true for the main paragraph in the Landing site selection section.\n\nDone - Citations clarified.\n\nDablink\n\nYour link on Copernicus goes to a disambiguation page.\n\nDone\n\nIt is for you to decide how far you want to take this article. I believe that attention to these points could certainly bring it within range of Good Article. Please contact my tlpage if you wish to raise any questions on this review, as I am not able to watch peer reviews at the moment. Brianboulton (talk)\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nI've listed this article for peer review because I would like to take it to FAC in the relatively near future, and would like some more feedback on it before that. It went through a GA review back in 2008, but has been significantly expanded since then. Comments specifically on excess horse jargon and prose would be appreciated.\n\nThanks, Dana boomer (talk)\n\nFinetooth comments: Well-done article, excellent images. Being a non-horse person, I can't say for sure that it's comprehensive, but it seems so to me. I found and fixed some small errors and MoS glitches, and I have just a few other suggestions, as follows:\n\nLead\n\n\"and by 1904 the first breeder's cooperative was formed\" - Should that be \"breeders' \"?\n\nFixed. Montanabw(talk)\n\n\"The breed is well-muscled, but with an elegant appearance.\" - Tighten to \"The breed is well-muscled but elegant\"?\n\nFixed. Montanabw(talk)\n\n\"as well as various under-saddle disciplines\" - \"Under-saddle\" is linked to \"equestrian\" in the \"Uses\" section. Should it be linked here?\n\nFlipped wikilinks to first appearance. Montanabw(talk)\n\nWorld Wars\n\n\"a Sardinian/Arabian cross stallion\" - The front slash and the word \"cross\" are a bit awkward. Would \"a crossbred stallion (part Sardinian and part Arabian)\" be better?\n\nMade a hyphenate; Sardinian-Arabian. Montanabw(talk)\n\n\"The year 1931 saw another breeders' cooperative established in East Tyrol, and the achievement of Haflinger breeding having spread throughout the entire Tyrolean province.\" - Since years don't literally see, a slight re-write might be better. Suggestion: \"In 1931, a breeders' cooperative was established in East Tyrol, and Haflinger breeding spread throughout the entire Tyrolean province.\"\n\nFixed. Montanabw(talk)\n\n\"All crossbred horses and colts not of breeding quality were able to be sold to the Army\" - Tighten by changing \"were able to be sold\" to \"could be sold\"?\n\nFixes. Montanabw(talk)\n\n21st century\n\n\"where state studs own the stallions\" - Word missing? Can studs own stallions?\n\nA \"stud\" is a facility (i.e. a farm). A stallion \"stands at stud\" -- so yes, a stud can own a stallion. Hope that clarifies matters. Montanabw(talk) 07:16, 20 September 2010 (UTC) Also wikilinked. Montanabw(talk)\n\n\"found that although there was a very proportion of inbreeding in the population\" - Word missing\"\n\nDid a minor rephrase (Dana, double check my edit on this, hope it's OK) Montanabw(talk)\n\nYup, looks good. I added a \"very\" before the \"small\" that you added because the amount is infintesimal. Dana boomer (talk)\n\n\"although other nations' registries have not yet entered a decision on the topic\" - Is that still true in 2010?\n\nDana needs to verify this one. Montanabw(talk)\n\nAs far as I can tell, this is still true. I'm basically trying to prove a negative, because so far none of the other registries have said anything about the topic. It's like they're all sticking their heads in the sand and hoping no one actually tries to register such as horse. Dana boomer (talk)\n\nBreed characteristics\n\n\"athletic with a natural tendency to be off the forehand\" - I'm getting more familiar with horse terminology by reviewing horse articles, but \"off the forehand\" is one I haven't encountered before. Could it be linked or briefly explained?\n\nThe concept here is that horses are more athletic if they are light in the front, shift their weight back and use their hindquarters more for impulsion...the source probably phrased it that way, which is a little weird even by horse lingo standards. Dana may have to see how the source uses the phrase; we may be able to make it a little less awkward. Montanabw(talk) 07:16, 20 September 2010 (UTC) Rephrased to \"light on the forehand.\" Might still be gibberish to the non-horse crowd, but more standard lingo within the horse world. May be room for further improvement, others sure can fiddle with it some more. Montanabw(talk)\n\nLinked to forehand (horse). Does that clear up the confusion? Dana boomer (talk)\n\nOther\n\nThe Commons link should be moved down to the \"External links\" section.\n\nFixed Montanabw(talk)\n\nThe dab tool finds three dabs.\n\nWhich ones?? Oh, got it, fixing... Montanabw(talk) 07:40, 20 September 2010 (UTC) DANA: Check my fix on Bozen, I think the correct one is the one now in northern Italy, not the one in Switzerland. Montanabw(talk)\n\nI hope these suggestions prove helpful. If so, please consider reviewing another article, especially one from the PR backlog at WP:PR; that is where I found this one. I don't usually watch the PR archives or check corrections or changes. If my comments are unclear, please ping me on my talk page. Finetooth (talk)\n\nThanks Finetooth! Great review, as always! Dana boomer (talk)\n\nPrevious peer review\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nI've listed this article for peer review because this article failed at WP:FAC, but had no opposition. I intend to renominate it on October 6. However, constructive feedback would be helpful.--TonyTheTiger (T/C/BIO/WP:CHICAGO/WP:FOUR)\n\nThere's a lot of material about the shoes thing in the summer camp; is it really warranted?\n\nI thought it was too extensive, but it was requested at the last FAC.--TonyTheTiger (T/C/BIO/WP:CHICAGO/WP:FOUR)\n\nOh. Maybe then you should add some material explaining the interest. I would understand if he had been in court over it or the accused crime was something serious, but as it is, I'm reading this material about a random basketball player and a minor youthful misunderstanding about shoes and wondering why it's in there. ('FAC wanted it' isn't a really satisfactory answer.)\n\nThe high school section is very long. I had a hard time keeping the chronology straight - perhaps you could sectionize it into 4 sections, 1 for each year, since there seems to be quite a lot of material for each one.\n\nI could only do three sections because he was not notable as a freshman. I also did the college section in the same way for consistency.--TonyTheTiger (T/C/BIO/WP:CHICAGO/WP:FOUR)\n\nLooks better.\n\nWhy is his childhood (pre-highschool) only covered way down in Personal? Wouldn't it make more sense to put before high school? He wasn't born shod and with a basketball in one hand.\n\nO.K. but it is hard to mesh with the chronology in the rest of the early life section so I put an overview at the top of the section.--TonyTheTiger (T/C/BIO/WP:CHICAGO/WP:FOUR)\n\nI'm not sure either that a TV cameo really makes sense in the same section as his Foundation.\n\nIn the current restructured format, where would you suggest putting it.--TonyTheTiger (T/C/BIO/WP:CHICAGO/WP:FOUR)\n\nWell, I think the usual thing is to have a 'Popular culture' section or something like Dennis Rodman#Media appearances. I'm sure you can scrape up a few more appearances.\n\nThanks for the impetus.--TonyTheTiger (T/C/BIO/WP:CHICAGO/WP:FOUR)\n\n'Washington era (1994–2001)' may be too big a section as is.\n\nThat is the only part of his career where he was a newsmaking all-star. Thus, it has more content.--TonyTheTiger (T/C/BIO/WP:CHICAGO/WP:FOUR)\n\nI meant sectionize it more. It's nearly a decade, there must be some finer subdivision.\n\nI have separated it into two sections. One has his All-rookie and All-star year (and the resulting big contract issue). The other section has the remaining years.\n\n--Gwern (contribs) 14:14 3 October 2010 (GMT)\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nI've listed this article for peer review because I really need help with the article. I can't seem to find enough information on the Internet regarding recording and production. The only listed is that the musician's record company allowed him to make his own schedule. Additionally, I'm not sure if some of the sources are verifiable and one of the links just died. Any other suggestions be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks, Magiciandude (talk)\n\nBrief commant: The title is completely meaningless to anyone who hasn't heard of this album. Titles should indicate what an article is about; this looks like a complete riddle. At the very least you should add (album) to the article, as is done with other album articles. Brianboulton (talk)\n\nAccording to the naming style under WP: Albums: When there is no other encyclopedic use of the album title, the article should reside at the normal name e.g. London Calling, not London Calling (album).. Magiciandude (talk)\n\nThat might work OK for English language titles, but what you have here is a Spanish phrase that not that many people will recognise even as that. I am suggesting that you give your readers some help, rather than simply complying with standard album naming guidelines. But it's up to you. Brianboulton (talk) (By the way, ref. 5 is a dead link)\n\nOkay, I took into consideration and decided to take your suggestion to rename this article into \"Ni Es Lo Mismo Ni Es Igual (album)\". Magiciandude (talk)\n\nI personally think that is a wise decision. If the consensus is insistent otherwise, it can always be changed back. I will try and review the article in the next day or two. Brianboulton (talk)\n\nA few more comments\n\nI have read through the article, and it obviously needs expanding; at present it is about a quarter of the length of the better album articles. A few examples: Be Here Now (album) 3,573 words, In Utero (album) 4,773, Debut (album) 2,270, Bad (album) 3,007. I took these at random from the FA and GA listings (all have (album) added to the name, incidentally).\n\nAs am not well-informed in this field I am unsure where you will find new sources dealing with this album, but why are you limiting youself to online sources? Other album articles use journals (Rolling Stone, Melody Maker, Entertainment Weekly etc.). Some use reviews in newspapers, some use books. I think the key to expanding this article is to look beyond the internet – and perhaps to make fuller use of the sources that you have. For instance, this longish article could surely be used to provide more interesting background information. This looks to be another underused source.\n\nSorry I can't help more. Brianboulton (talk)\n\nWell can anyone else lend a hand please? Magiciandude (talk)\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nI think this article is ready to be listed as a good article although there is a big backlog on the military history nominations list. I'm keen to hear where improvements can be made.\n\nThanks, Harrison49 (talk)\n\nRuhrfisch comments: Interesting article - thanks for working on it. I think this owuld have a hard time at GAN in its current state, so here are some suggestions for improvement with an eye to GAN.\n\nThe disambig links tool on this page finds two dab links in the article that need to be fixed\n\nThe lead does not really meet WP:LEAD and needs to be expanded to be a better summary of the article. The lead should be an accessible and inviting overview of the whole article. My rule of thumb is to include every header in the lead in some way\n\nThe article has a lot of short (one or two sentence) paragraphs that impede the flow of the prose. They need to either be combined with others or perhaps expanded.\n\nArticle needs more references, for example the last two paragraphs in Hillingdon House have no refs (and the one on the ghost especially needs a ref). There are also paragraphs with refs early, then some sentences following the refs which are not themselves referenced (but should be). For example The house and gardens, together with the surrounding parkland and artificial lake, created by damming the River Pinn, comprised over 200 acres (81 ha).\n\nMy rule of thumb is that every quote, every statistic, every extraordinary claim and every paragraph needs a ref.\n\nSome of the current refs do not have enough information. For example, internet refs need URL, title, author if known, publisher and date accessed. {{cite web}} and other cite templates may be helpful. Please see WP:CITE and WP:V\n\nPer WP:ITALIC and WP:MOSQUOTE quotations should not be in italics and should be in \"quotation marks\" (Churchill's quote)\n\nI think this is a WP:WEIGHT issue - the amount of material on WWII seems fairly slight, especially compared to the previous history. I think the WWII material should be expanded - how many aircraft were stationed there? How many sorties did they fly? What was the casualty rate for aircraft and pilots during the Blitz?\n\nSome of the material is organized by subject now, but I wonder if it would flow better if organized more chronologically? For example, a big chunk of the WWII section is about what happened to the facilities long after the war (museum).\n\nMake sure to provide context to the reader - this could use a year RAF Uxbridge became part of No. 22 Group. Units stationed at Uxbridge included the Headquarters Music Services and also the Queen's Colour Squadron of the RAF Regiment.[18]\n\nHope this helps. If my comments are useful, please consider peer reviewing an article, especially one at Wikipedia:Peer review/backlog (which is how I found this article). I do not watch peer reviews, so if you have questions or comments, please contact me on my talk page. Yours, Ruhrfisch ><>°°\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nI've listed this article for peer review because I want to upgrade it to GA status. I would like the entire article reviewed, and I would like advice on how to improve the article and get it ready for a GA nomination.\n\nThanks, The UtahraptorMy mistakes; I mean, er, contributions\n\nFinetooth comments: This is an interesting article, and in general it is easy to read. It's broad in coverage but might not be quite broad enough yet for GA. For example, is anything known about the history of the area before the mid-19th century? The biggest problem I see, however, is that the article relies heavily on sources that are probably not reliable as defined by WP:RS. Personal web sites, blogs, and dot-coms like Legends of America and Utah Travel Center, for example, are usually not considered reliable. It may be that the same or similar information might be found in the four books you list in the \"Further reading\" section. Those are most likely reliable sources per WP:RS and may include other valuable information about the town.\n\nI made a small number of proofing changes to the article, and here is a short list of suggestions about prose, style, and other matters.\n\nGeology\n\n\"This area features a variety of plant species not seen in any singular region.\" - I'm not sure what is meant by \"singular region\". Does it mean that these species are found together only in this region?\n\nSome of the material in this section has little to do with geology. Perhaps the Geology and Geography sections would do better combined as \"Geology and geography\", and repetition of material about Red Cliffs Recreation Area could be eliminated. \"Climate\" could be its own section.\n\nDiscovery of silver\n\n\"During its first year, Silver Reef did not have a smelter.\" - Link smelter?\n\nTown\n\n\"Immediately following the initial silver rush, a town site was plotted, and the town was hastily built.\" - \"Platted\" rather than \"plotted\"?\n\n\"Despite the fact that it was surrounded by Mormon settlements,\" - Tighten to \"Although it was surrounded by Mormon settlements... \"?\n\n\"Despite the fact that Mormonism was not Silver Reef's main religion,\" - Tighten?\n\nCrime\n\n\"Despite the fact that it had good relations with other towns,\" - Tighten?\n\nDecline\n\nThe Manual of Style advises against extremely short sections and subsections. I'd suggest removing the \"Closure of the mines\" subhead and just allowing it to be the last paragraph of the \"Decline\" section.\n\nTourism\n\nThis section has repetitious material and short subsections. I would suggest removing the subheads and the bolded, bulleted list, and re-writing this section in straight prose. For example, the section could still open with \"Silver Reef has since become a popular tourist attraction.\" The next sentences might say, \"After Silver Reef's mines closed, the Wells Fargo office was used as a residence until the late 1940s. After that, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. In the 21st century, the office is used as an art gallery and a museum.\" That it faced Main Street may not be important enough to include. The next paragraph could discuss the Rice Bank Building. And so on.\n\nNotes\n\nSome of the citations are incomplete, citation 13, for example. A good rule of thumb for citations to web sites is to include author, title, publisher, date of publication, url, and access date, if all of those are known or can be found.\n\nImages\n\nThe image licenses look fine except for the File:View of Silver Reef.jpg and File:Cosmopolitan Restaurant 1800s.jpg. It's not clear where the originals for these two came from. The immediate sources listed on the licensing pages are not the same as the original sources. If you can find out from the immediate sources where they got the photographs, you might be able to find them (in old books maybe) and fill in the missing information. They are probably public domain because of their age, but that's not certain from the information provided.\n\nI hope these suggestions prove helpful. If so, please consider reviewing another article, especially one from the PR backlog at WP:PR; that is where I found this one. I don't usually watch the PR archives or check corrections or changes. If my comments are unclear, please ping me on my talk page. Finetooth (talk)\n\nI'll get started improving the article. Thank you for your review. The UtahraptorMy mistakes; I mean, er, contributions\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nI've listed this article for peer review because this article failed 2 FARs this year already and I want to make sure all WP:FACR have been satisfied before I submit for its 3rd FAR this year.\n\nThanks, Ta-Va-Tar (discuss–?)\n\nFinetooth comments, first installment: Here are comments from the top through the \"Geography\" section. I will add more later but thought it might be helpful to post these now.\n\nThe dab tool at the top of this review page finds two links to disambiguation pages rather than their intended targets.\n\nDone fixed the second dab link, I think the first one is an intended dab link since it's at the other use line Ta-Va-Tar (discuss–?)\n\nLead\n\n\"Hong Kong's population is 95% ethnic Chinese and 5%... \" - It's generally preferred to use \"percent\" rather than the symbol in simple cases like this and to add a no-break space between the digits and the word \"percent\" to hold them together on line-break. WP:NBSP has details about the no-break code. Ditto later in the article, in the geography section and elsewhere.\n\n\"The Hong Kong dollar is the 9th most traded currency in the world.\" - Numbers from one to nine are usually written as words; i.e., \"ninth\".\n\n\"now Aberdeen Harbour/Little Hong Kong\" - Front slashes are ambiguous. Better would be to use \"and\" or \"or\" or a hyphen, whichever makes most sense.\n\nDone fixed in the lead paragraph. Ta-Va-Tar (discuss–?)\n\nEtymology\n\nMOS:COLLAPSE advises against using collapsing boxes in the main text, including captions. The hide-show pronunciation guide will fail FACR, I'm pretty sure, and should be changed to just \"show\".\n\nDone had to relocate the template, since it messes up the layout after set to always show... Ta-Va-Tar (discuss–?)\n\nIn this case, I think I gave bad advice. Since I posted the note above, I've realized that the weather box is also collapsible, and I've never heard anyone complain about the hide and show nature of weather boxes. The collapsible pronunciation guides may also be OK. I agree with you that the \"show\" mode messes up the layout. However, I don't know what the fix is. A third opinion might help. Ruhrfisch, Jappalang, or Brianboulton, all frequent PR reviewers, might be willing to look at this specific question if asked. Finetooth (talk)\n\nPre-colonial\n\n\"Eight petroglyphs were discovered on surrounding islands dating back to Bronze Age during the Shang Dynasty time period, which are believed to have been used to pacify bad weather.\" - A bit awkward. Suggestion: \"Eight petroglyphs, believed to have been used to pacify bad weather, were discovered on surrounding islands dating to the Bronze Age during the Shang Dynasty.\"\n\n\"incorporated the territory into imperial China for this first time\" - \"The first time\" rather than \"this first time\"?\n\n\"Military clashes between China and Portugal ensued resulting in the Portuguese expelled.\" - Doesn't quite make sense as written. Suggestion: \"Military clashes between China and Portugal led to the expulsion of the Portuguese.\"\n\nDone Ta-Va-Tar (discuss–?)\n\nPost-war\n\n\"When the People's Republic of China\" - Add the abbreviation PRC here too so that it will make sense by itself later; i.e., \"People's Republic of China (PRC)\".\n\n\"With the development of the manufacturing industry in southern China beginning in the early 1980s, Hong Kong's competitiveness in manufacturing declined and its economy began shifting toward a reliance on the service industry, which enjoyed high rates of growth in the 1980s and 1990s, and absorbed workers released from the manufacturing industry.\" - A bit too complex. I'd recommend breaking this into two sentences.\n\n\"a high degree of autonomy for at least fifty years after the transfer\" - Numbers bigger than nine are usually written as digits unless they start a sentence; i.e., 50.\n\nDone Ta-Va-Tar (discuss–?)\n\nModern times\n\n\"Since 1997\" might be a better head than \"Modern times\" since \"modern\" is less specific.\n\n\"In 2009, Hong Kong hosted the fifth East Asian Games competed by nine national teams.\" - \"Competed by\" is not used as a verb form. Suggestion: \"In 2009, Hong Kong hosted the fifth East Asian Games, in which nine national teams competed.\"\n\nDone Ta-Va-Tar (discuss–?)\n\nGovernance\n\nWP:MOS#Bulleted and numbered lists suggests using straight prose rather than lists whenever feasible. My suggestion here would be to use prose paragraphs without the bolded subheads or bullets. You might have to combine one-sentence items with other items to make paragraphs of reasonable length.\n\nDone compressed the list to single paragraph Ta-Va-Tar (discuss–?)\n\nDefence\n\n\"As a British Colony and later as a territory, defence\" - Dangling modifier. Suggestion: \"When Hong Kong was a British Colony and, later, a territory, defence... \".\n\nDone not sure if the comma after \"and\" is necessary Ta-Va-Tar (discuss–?)\n\nGeography and climate\n\n\"Hong Kong's long and irregular coast line provides\" - Tighten by one word by deleting \"line\"?\n\nDone Ta-Va-Tar (discuss–?)\n\nFinetooth (talk)\n\nFinetooth comments, installment 2: Here's the second batch. The article seems comprehensive, and the prose is generally fine. Minor prose, layout, and Manual of Style tweaks are in order, as noted. Be sure that the FACR concerns about images and sources have been addressed, and you should be OK for FACR 3. Good luck.\n\nText sandwiches\n\nThe Manual of Style advises against sandwiching text between two images. The \"Post-war\" section has a text sandwich. \"Governance\" has a slight one that could be eliminated by moving File:HK Government House 2005.jpg down a bit. Education has one that could be fixed by moving File:HKUST Sundial.JPG down a bit.\n\n✗ Not done ... maybe done? I edit in large resolution, it still looks sandwiching to me, but not sandwiching in lower resolution... is there a resolution standard? Ta-Va-Tar (discuss–?)\n\nThe standard is the thumb setting, but there are many exceptions based on what you think looks best. Images in the infobox and in maps and panoramas generally need to be bigger than thumb, and the settings are somewhat arbitrary. I generally aim for one image per section or more than one in sections big enough to accommodate them. If possible, I arrange images so that they don't overlap sections or interfere with edit buttons or make text sandwiches, and I try to place directional images so that they face into the page. Sometimes, though, there's an overriding reason for doing otherwise with one image or another, and a complicating factor is that the layout looks different on different screens. I'm working today on a laptop, which is all I have available to me at the moment. What looks slightly scrunched to me may look just fine on a bigger screen. Not sure. I suppose the best test is to see if any other readers mention the layout. Finetooth (talk)\n\nEducation\n\n\"including government aids and grant schools\" - Should \"government aids-and-grant schools\" be hyphenated?\n\nDone i think it should be hyphenated Ta-Va-Tar (discuss–?)\n\nTransport\n\n\"handling 3.74 million tonnes\" - I'd probably give this in short tons as well.\n\nDone added 4.12 million tons conversation Ta-Va-Tar (discuss–?)\n\nFootnotes\n\nRather than linking directly from the footnote text to external sites, I'd suggest creating in-line citations just as you have for the main text. I don't think the direct external links will pass FACR.\n\nDone replaced bare links with citation templates Ta-Va-Tar (discuss–?)\n\nFurther reading\n\n\"pp. 293\" - The abbreviation for a single page is \"p\". Ditto for all similar instances in this list.\n\nDone Ta-Va-Tar (discuss–?)\n\nFACRs\n\nTwo issues that came up during the most recent FACR involved image licenses and sourcing. I did not re-check the image licenses or look at the sources closely. However, it would be a good idea to make sure that the objections raised at the FACR have been addressed. It's fine to ask those reviewers to take another look.\n\nDone I checked all images and sources, but I'll also request previous reviewers to take a look as well. Ta-Va-Tar (discuss–?)\n\nI hope these suggestions prove helpful. If so, please consider reviewing another article, especially one from the PR backlog at WP:PR; that is where I found this one. I don't usually watch the PR archives or check corrections or changes. If my comments are unclear, please ping me on my talk page. Finetooth (talk)\n\nAnother Finetooth comment: I forgot to mention that the lead does not now conform to the WP:LEAD guidelines. The lead should be an inviting summary of the whole article. The existing lead covers only the top sections, but the sections from Geography on down have been neglected. I'd suggest a re-write that devotes less space to history and governance and includes something about Culture, Transport, and so on. A good rule of thumb is to include in the lead at least a mention of each of the main text sections. Finetooth (talk)\n\n✗ Not done I have rewritten the lead section, but now I'm not sure if it will satisfy criteria 1(a). Ta-Va-Tar (discuss–?)\n\nThat seems better. Finetooth (talk)\n\nNikkimaria's comments on sources and referencing (per request)\n\nSource for percentage of water area?\n\nWhat figures are you using to calculate that population density?

Also, please ensure that this article undergoes a thorough copyedit per User:Tony1/How to satisfy Criterion 1a. Other than these issues I have explained, this article looks good. Sjones23 (talk - contributions)\n\nRuhrfisch comments: Thanks for your efforts here so far - unfortunately I think this needs a lot more work, before it would pass at WP:GAN. Here are some suggestions for improvement.\n\nThe disambig links tool on this page finds 4 dab links that need to be fixed.\n\nThere are seven (7) WP:Fair Use images in the article, which seems to me to violate WP:NFCC (the montage of Jake Lloyd, et al counts as three). The two biggest problems are the two images each of Hayden Christensen, and two each of Sebastian Shaw. The image of Jon Stewart wearing the mask also seems doubtful - what understanding does the reader gain that could not be conveyed by text alone?\n\nI agree that the lead does not follow WP:LEAD. The lead should be an accessible and inviting overview of the whole article. Nothing important should be in the lead only - since it is a summary, it should all be repeated in the body of the article itself. My rule of thumb is to include every header in the lead in some way\n\nAnother serious concern is a lack of references - My rule of thumb is that every quote, every statistic, every extraordinary claim and every paragraph needs a ref.\n\nSome of the refs used lack sufficient information - one is just \"Newsweek\", which does not help the interested reader find the source very well. Internet refs need URL, title, author if known, publisher and date accessed. {{cite web}} and other cite templates may be helpful. See WP:CITE and WP:V\n\nI also am concerned that many of the sources used are not reliable sources and may not meet WP:RS or that better sources may exist. For example there is an interview with Jonathan WInzler about two books he wrote, but the books themselves are not used as sources.\n\nA model article is useful for ideas and examples to follow. Emperor Palpatine is a FA and seems like it owuld be a pretty good model to follow. Look at how much more detail is given on things that are not just \"this is what the character did in the movies\". This needs more material like that that is written from an out-of-universe perspective. Homer Simpson and Bart Simpson are also FAs and may be good models as fictional charaters.\n\nHope this helps.

Yours, Ruhrfisch ><>°°\n\nHave you investigated Wikipedia:WikiProject Films/Resources for more sources, or asked at WP:FILM for help finding more sources? --Malkinann (talk)\n\nNo I haven't yet. I will see what I can do when I have the time. And anyone else is free to do it too. − Jhenderson 777\n\nAnd I am going to use Palpatine and Jabba the Hutt as examples of how it should be done. − Jhenderson 777\n\nI recommend having \"References\" below \"Notes\" and using the {{Harvnb}} style. See Featured Article American Beauty (film) as an example that does this. A reader can follow the footnote, click on the author's name, and find the full reference. I think that the \"References\" section should include multi-page publications, so it appears Kasinki's book should be listed there. (If you cite one page from a book, we do not need a full reference, just the footnote.)\n\nIn addition, I think there could be further critical analysis of the character as a step toward comprehensiveness. Referring back to American Beauty, you can see a similar section for the film and the academic references cited for it. There are a couple of ways to look for such references. One is Google Scholar, and it helps to look for \"Darth Vader\" in article titles. This shows this as a potential reference. There may also be articles about Darth Vader without the eponymous title, but they're not readily apparent. You may need to mash up keywords to find relevant results. Also, if you use WorldCat.org, you can search for \"Darth Vader\" and filter for non-fiction or performing arts books. Books with \"Darth Vader\" in the book title or in a chapter title (where listed) will be displayed. 1, 2, and 3 are such examples. Erik (talk | contribs)\n\nTo be honest, Erik. That References/Notes recommendation sounds like something you can do. If so, go for it, if you feel like doing it! ;) − Jhenderson 777\n\nDone! :) Erik (talk | contribs)\n\nThanks! :) − Jhenderson 777\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nI'm nominating this list for Peer review, as I'd like a few suggestions on how to improve the article before I take it to FLC. Cheers NapHit (talk)\n\nComments Sandman888 (talk)\n\nThe image of the pink sweater might be a derivative, but I'm no expert on the rules.\n\ntable:\n\n\"Sponsor/team\" Surely it was not Italy who were the team, but the Italian cyclist association or similar?\n\nConsider removing the years it was not held and add a note to the previous and subsequent year. It'll make it much better sort-wise.\n\n\"time/points\" what is the first couple of entries? Hours? They don't sort right either.\n\n\"stage wins\" doesn't sort properly on Firefox on XP; if you sort it thrice it messes up.\n\nRuhrfisch comments: This looks fairly good to me - in addition to Sandman's comments, here are some suggestions for improvement.\n\nDoes the first sentence really meet WP:LEAD? The article should begin with a declarative sentence telling the nonspecialist reader what (or who) is the subject. The general classification winners are not even mentioned in the current first sentence\n\nI think of neighboring countries as being adjacent, or perhaps no more than one country away. The Netherlands does not meet this criterion in The race usually covers approximately 3,500 kilometres (2,200 mi), passing through Italy and neighbouring countries such as the Netherlands.[2]\n\nI would change the caption to something like Fausto Coppi, who won the Giro d'Italia five times between 1940 and 1953.\n\nCould the last sentence of the lead be more concise as something like The current champion is Ivan Basso of the Liquigas-Doimo team , who won the 2010 Giro d'Italia.[6]\n\nWhere possible, the article would benefit from switching from passive voice to active voice, so for example The Giro d'Italia was established in 1909 by newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport, after the success of the Tour de France which was inaugurated in 1903. could just be In 1909 the newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport established the Giro d'Italia, inspired by the success of the Tour de France, which started in 1903.\n\nPer WP:MOSQUOTE, this needs \"quotation marks\", not single quotes as in: Nicknamed the 'Iron Man of Tuscany' for his endurance...\n\nI think this needs a general copyedit - this needs at least some commas, and it might read better in active voice and it would also help to say who offered him the 22,000 lire So dominant was Binda that in 1930 he was called to the head office of La Gazzetta dello Sport where he was accused of ruining the race and was offered 22,000 lire to be less dominant which he refused.[9]\n\nProblem sentence: Spandiard Alberto Contador of Astana was the winner in 2008, he chose to focus on the Tour the following year, Denis Menchov was the victor.[22] Spandiard is not spelled correctly, and it is not super clear if Contador actually raced in the Giro in 2010 or not, and the year Mnchov won is also less clear than it could be. Perhaps somethng like Spandiard Alberto Contador of Astana was the winner in 2008; the following year he raced in the Tour de France instead, and Denis Menchov was the Giro victor.[22]\n\nHope this helps.

Yours, Ruhrfisch ><>°°\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nAs part of my plan of expanding articles on late antique/early medieval \"Barbarian\" European kings I've created this article with in mind of making it a GA. Concerning the completeness and objectivity of the article I'm confident it's OK; the articles difficulties may eventually manifest themselves in the quality of the prose. Most importantly I'd like a careful evaluation of the lead and if the article is ready to stand up to a GAN. Thanks for any help, Aldux (talk)\n\nComments by Jappalang\n\nI had this big problem with the article right from the start: Who are these guys? I was basically confused (even though this is supposed to be a biography of the subject) because I have no idea who are the Gepids and Lombards nor where is Pannonia or whatever else location is mentioned. The only thing that seems familiar to me is the Byzantine Empire. Sure there are links, but it is likely the reader is already lost (like me) and would not bother to read further or click them and go to another article (thus disrupting the reading experience) to find out.\n\nI suggest giving a familiar location in where (continent or general location, e.g. Middle East, Persia, Egypt, or something) this is taking place. Give the reader some familiar ground to grasp at and with which he or she can associate the subject.\n\nImages\n\nFile:SouthEastern Europe mid-6th century AD.png\n\nWhy is Euratlas.com's copyright not violated here?
