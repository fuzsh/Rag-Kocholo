S. P.; Damodaran, A. D.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nHigh purity individual rare earth oxides are increasingly used as major components in lasers (Y 2 O 3 ), phosphors (YVO 3 , Eu 2 O 3 ), magnetic bubble memory films (Gd 2 O 3 ) and refractive-index lenses and fibre optics (La 2 O 3 ). The determination of individual lanthanides in high purity rare earth oxides is a more important and difficult task. This paper reports the utilization of higher order derivative spectrophotometry for the simultaneous determination of dysprosium, holmium and erbium in high purity rare earth oxides. The developed procedure is simple, reliable and allows the determination of 0.001 to 0.2% of dysprosium, holmium and erbium in several rare earth.

Erbium-169 ('1 69 Er) is one of radioisotopes that can be used for radiation synovectomy (radio synovectomy) in the treatment of inflammatory joint diseases (arthritis) due to its Î²- particle emission (T 1/2 =9.4 days, E Î² maximum =0.34 MeV). The preliminary study on preparation of 169 Er by using natural erbium oxide (Er 2 O 3 ) target irradiated at TRIGA 2000 Bandung reactor has been carried out. The irradiated target was dissolved in hydrochloric acid solution and gentle warming. The optimum condition of 169 Er preparation was obtained by dissolution of 169 Er 2 O 3 by using 1N HCl solution. The radiochemical purity of 169 ErCl 3 was determined by paper chromatography, thin layer chromatography and paper electrophoresis techniques. The solution of 169 ErCl 3 formed was obtained with the pH of 1.5 â 2, clear, with the specific activity of 0.48 â 0.71 MBq/mg Er. The solution has the radiochemical purity of 98.32 Â± 1.28% and the radionuclide purity of 99.98%. Study on the stability of 169 ErCl 3 solution showed that the solution was still stable for 4 days at room temperature with the radiochemical purity more than 95%.

High purity erbium oxide is used as coating material for test blanket module of fusion reactor to prevent the tritium permeation. The total concentration of HRE (including Er) in only proven resource of rare earths in Indian monazite mineral is < 0.05%. Its separation from such a low concentration and also from host of other chemically similar elements like Y, Dy, Ho, Yb, Tm etc is quite difficult and challenging. A solvent extraction process employing PC88A and Aliquat336 has been developed for the purification of erbium oxide from two types of HRE fractions having % composition; (i) Y 2 O 3 : 0.18, Tb 4 O 7 : 0.28, Dy 2 CO 2 : 47.07, Er 2 O 3 : 35.03, HO 2 O 3 : 10.11, Yb 2 O 3 : 5.88, Tm 2 O 3 : 1.43 and (ii) Dy 2 O 3 : 6.39, Er 2 O 3 : 49.43, HO 2 O 3 : 10.43, Tm 2 O 3 : 2.7, Y 2 O 3 : 24.08, Yb 2 O 3 : 6.96. PC88A was used to process low Y content concentrate from chloride medium whereas Aliquat336 was found to be suitable in thiocynate medium to treat the concentrate with high Y content. Effects of process variables such as acidity, extractant concentration, total oxide concentration in feed, number of stages, phase ratio, scrubbing agent were investigated for both the systems\n\nInteraction of water vapor with erbium and erbium dideuteride films\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHolloway, D.M.; Swartz, W.E.

M.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe demonstrate a pulsed ring erbium-doped fiber laser based on graphene oxide (GO), employing a simplified Hummer's method to synthesize the GO via chemical oxidation of graphite flakes at room temperature. By dipping a fiber ferrule end face onto the GO suspension, GO is successfully coated onto the end face, making it a simple saturable absorption device. A stable Q-switched pulsed fiber laser is achieved with a low pump threshold of 9.5 mW at 980 nm. The pulse repetition rate ranges from 16.0 to 57.0 kHz. The pulse width and the pulse energy are studied and discussed\n\nMechanical properties of melt-derived erbium oxide\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nNeuman, A.D.; Blacic, M.J.; Platero, M.; Romero, R.S.; McClellan, K.J.; Petrovic, J.J.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nErbium oxide (Er 2 O 3 ) is a rare earth oxide that is chemically and thermally stable and has a melting point of 2,430 C. There is relatively little information available regarding single crystal growth of erbia or the properties of erbia. In this study, erbia single crystals have been grown in a Xenon Optical Floating Zone Unit (XeOFZ) capable of melting materials at temperatures up to 3,000 C. Erbia was melt synthesized in the XeOFZ unit in a container less fashion, proving for little chance of contamination. Crystals were grown in compressed air and in reducing atmospheres. A recurring problem with melt synthesis of erbia is the appearance of flakes at the edges of the melt zone during growth; these flakes disrupt the growth process. The processing details and an initial survey of the physical properties of erbia single crystals is discussed\n\nThe infra-red photoresponse of erbium-doped silicon nanocrystals\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKenyon, A.J.; Bhamber, S.S.; Pitt, C.W.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nWe have exploited the interaction between erbium ions and silicon nanoclusters to probe the photoresponse of erbium-doped silicon nanocrystals in the spectral region around 1.5 Î¼m. We have produced an MOS device in which the oxide layer has been implanted with both erbium and silicon and annealed to produce silicon nanocrystals. Upon illumination with a 1480 nm laser diode, interaction between the nanocrystals and the rare-earth ions results in a modification of the conductivity of the oxide that enables a current to flow when a voltage is applied across the oxide layer\n\nRate equation modelling of erbium luminescence dynamics in erbium-doped silicon-rich-silicon-oxide\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nShah, Miraj, E-mail: m.shah@ee.ucl.ac.uk [Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL, Torrington Place, London WC1E 7JE (United Kingdom); Wojdak, Maciej; Kenyon, Anthony J.

PL decay lifetime measurements of sensitised Er{sup 3+} ions are usually reported to be stretched or multi exponential, very different to those that are directly excited, which usually show a single exponential decay component. In this paper, we report on SiO{sub 2} thin films doped with Si-nc's and erbium. Time resolved PL measurements reveal two distinct 1.54 {mu}m Er decay components; a fast microsecond component, and a relatively long lifetime component (10 ms). We also study the structural properties of these samples through TEM measurements, and reveal the formation of Er clusters. We propose that these Er clusters are responsible for the fast {mu}s decay component, and we develop rate equation models that reproduce the experimental transient observations, and can explain some of the reported transient behaviour in previously published literature.\n\nSynthesis of erbium oxide nanosheets and up-conversion properties\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nChen, X.

Omi\n\n2012-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The erbium silicate formation processes during annealing in Ar gas were monitored by synchrotron radiation grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD in real time and the optical properties of the silicates were investigated by photoluminescence measurements in spectral and time-resolved domains. The GIXD measurements show that erbium silicates and erbium oxide are formed by interface reactions between silicon oxide and erbium oxides deposited on silicon oxide by reactive sputtering in Ar gas and O2/Ar mixture gas ambiences. The erbium silicates are formed above 1060 Â°C in Ar gas ambience and above 1010 Â°C in O2/Ar gas ambience, and erbium silicides are dominantly formed above 1250 Â°C. The I15/2-I13/2 Er3+ photoluminescence from the erbium oxide and erbium silicate exhibits abnormal temperature dependence, which can be explained by the phonon-assisted resonant absorption of the 532-nm excitation photons into the 2H11/2 levels of Er3+ ions of the erbium compounds.\n\nHigh purity samarium oxide from mixed rare earth carbonates\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nQueiroz, Carlos A. da S.; Seneda, Jose A.; Vasconcellos, Mari E. de; Pedreira Filho, Walter dos R.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nA simple and economical chemical process for the production of highly pure samarium oxides is discussed. The raw material, which was used in the form of rare earth carbonates was produced industrially from the chemical treatment of Brazilian monazite. Ion exchange chromatography was performed using a strong cationic resin that is typically employed in water treatment processes to fractionate rare earth elements (REE) without the use of retention ions. Under these conditions, 99.9% pure Sm 2 O 3 was eluted using the ammonium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at a controlled pH. The EDTA-samarium complex was separated from EDTA and then precipitated as oxalate and fired to samarium oxide. Molecular absorption spectrophotometry was used to monitor the samarium content during the proposed process, and sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used to certify the purity of the samarium oxide. Typical samarium oxide obtained from the proposed procedure contained the following contaminants in micrograms per gram: Sc (20.90); Y (11.80); La (8.4); Ce (4.3); Pr (2.5); Nd (5.1); Eu (94); Gd (114); Tb (3.6); Dy (2.5), Ho (2.3); Er (3.0); Tm (2.3); Yb (38,2); Lu (25.6). The high-purity samarium oxides produced in the present study can be used as an alternative to imported products in research and development applications.

A high quality copper film prepared by ion beam deposition under a substrate bias voltage of -50 V (IBD Cu film at V s = -50 V) showed an oxidation resistance as high as an ultra high purity copper (UHP Cu) bulk, whereas a Cu film deposited without substrate bias voltage (IBD Cu film at V s = 0 V) showed lower oxidation resistance. The growth of Cu 2 O layer on the UHP Cu bulk and both types of the films obeyed in principle a logarithmic rate law. However, the growth of oxide layer on the IBD Cu films at V s = 0 and -50 V deviated upward from the logarithmic rate law after the exposure time of 320 and 800 h, respectively. The deviation from the logarithmic law is due to the formation of CuO on the Cu 2 O layer after a critical time\n\nRelease characteristics of tritium from high-purity lithium oxide\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nO'Kula, K.R.; Vogelsang, W.F.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nRates of tritium release from neutronirradiated lithium oxide were determined from isothermal release experiments. High-purity, monocrystalline lithium oxide was purged ex-reactor with helium and helium-hydrogen gas streams. Overall release was found to be controlled by solid-phase diffusion, and was predominantly in the form of condensible species. The result of an independent concentration profile analysis at 923 K was in agreement with the gas release diffusion coefficient. Sweeping the Li 2 O with hydrogen-containing gas was found to enhance tritium removal during the early stage of each run\n\nEffect of Erbium Nanoparticles on Optical Properties of Zinc Borotellurite Glass System\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAzlan Muhammad Noorazlan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Erbium nanoparticles (NPs doped zinc borotellurite glasses have been prepared by conventional melt-quenching technique with the chemical composition {[(TeO20.70(B2O30.30]1-x(ZnOx}1-y(Er3O2y (where y=0.005,0.01,0.02,0.03,0.04,0.05. The structural properties of the prepared glasses were determined via X-ray diffraction (XRD analysis and FTIR analysis. It was confirmed that the prepared glasses are amorphous. The bonding parameters of the glasses were analyzed by using FTIR analysis and were confirmed to be ionic in nature. The refractive index increases as the content of erbium NPs increases. The optical absorption spectra revealed that fundamental absorption edge shifts to longer wavelength as the content of erbium NPs increases. The value of band gap had been calculated and shown to be decreased with an increase content of erbium NPs. The Urbach energy was shown to be linearly increased with an increase content of erbium NPs oxides.\n\nThe ion-exchange obtaining of high purity samarium oxide\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBrzyska, W.; Soltysiak, I.; Cygan, J.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe use of lactic acid - EDTA mixture as an eluent for the obtaining of high purity samarium oxide was studied.

As the result of 57% samarium concentrate elution with column load 1:3 and flow rate 0,4 cm/min, over 99% pure samarium oxide with 73% yield has been obtained.

The electrochemical conditions have allowed to obtain pores with the size ranging from 30 to 50 nm, which are much larger than those usually obtained by anodization in a pure sulfuric acid solution (<20 nm). The mechanism of the AAO growth is discussed. It was found that with the increase of applied anodizing voltage a number of incorporated sulfate ions in the aluminum oxide matrix increases, which was connected with the appearance of an unusual area in the current vs. time curves. On the surface of anodizing low- and high-purity aluminum, the formation of hillocks was observed, which was associated with the sulfate ions incorporation. The sulfate ions are replacing the oxygen atom/atoms in the AAO amorphous crystal structure and, consequently, the AAO template swells, the oxide cracks and uplifts causing the formation of hillocks. The same mechanism occurs for both low- and high-purity aluminum. Nanoporous AAO characterized by a very high regularity, not registered previously for low purity aluminum, was obtained. Furthermore, no significant difference in the regularity ratio between the AAO obtained on low- and high-purity aluminum, was observed. The electrochemical conditions applied in this study can be, thus, used for the fabrication of high quality\n\nSynthesis and luminescence properties of erbium silicate thin films\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMiritello, Maria; Lo Savio, Roberto; Iacona, Fabio; Franzo, Giorgia; Bongiorno, Corrado; Priolo, Francesco\n\n2008-01-01\n\nWe have studied the structure and the room temperature luminescence of erbium silicate thin films deposited by rf magnetron sputtering. Films deposited on silicon oxide layers are characterized by good structural properties and excellent stability. The optical properties of these films are strongly improved by rapid thermal annealing processes performed in the range of temperature 800-1250 deg. C. In fact through the reduction of the defect density of the material, a very efficient room temperature photoluminescence at 1535 nm is obtained. We have also investigated the influence of the annealing ambient, by finding that treatments in O 2 atmosphere are significantly more efficient in improving the optical properties of the material with respect to processes in N 2 . Upconversion effects become effective only when erbium silicate is excited with high pump powers. The evidence that all Er atoms (about 10 22 cm -3 ) in erbium silicate films are optically active suggests interesting perspectives for optoelectronic applications of this material\n\nHydrogen diffusion along grain boundaries in erbium oxide coatings\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMao, Wei; Chikada, Takumi; Suzuki, Akihiro; Terai, Takayuki\n\n2014-01-01\n\nDiffusion of interstitial atomic hydrogen in erbium oxide (Er 2 O 3 ) was investigated using density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) methods. Hydrogen diffusivity in bulk, on (0 0 1) surface, and along Î£13 (4â3â1)/[1 1 1] symmetric tilt grain boundaries (GBs) were evaluated in a temperature range of 673â1073 K, as well as hydrogen diffusion barriers. It was found that H diffusion shows the faster on (0 0 1) surface than along GBs and in bulk. Also, energy barrier of H diffusion in bulk estimated by DFT and MD methods is somewhat higher than that along GBs evaluated in the experiments. This suggests that H diffusion in Er 2 O 3 coatings depends on GBs rather than bulk. In addition, with a correction of GB density, the simulated diffusivity along GBs in MD simulations is in good agreement with the experimental data within one order of magnitude. The discrepancy of H diffusivity between the experiments and the simulations should be reduced by considering H concentration, H diffusion direction, deviations of the initial configuration, vacancy defects, etc\n\nProgress on erbium-doped waveguide components\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nBjarklev, Anders Overgaard; Berendt, Martin Ole; Broeng, Jes\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThe recent development in erbium-doped fiber amplifiers, and fiber lasers is reviewed.

Most of these applications require yttrium oxide of highest purity. Consequently there is a need for production of high purity yttrium oxide. Separation and purification of yttrium from other rare earths is a challenging task due to their close chemical properties. Liquid-liquid extraction and ion exchange have been widely used in the production of yttrium oxide of highest purity. Determination of impurities, especially other rare earths, in ppm level is required for process development and chemical characterization of the high purity Y 2 O 3 . Many methods have been described in literature. However since the advent of ICP AES much work in this area has been carried out by this technique. This paper describes the work done for determination of dysprosium (Dy) and terbium (Tb) in yttrium oxide using a high resolution sequential ICP AES. Emission spectra of rare earth elements are very complex and due to this complexity it is important to select spectral interference free analyte lines for determination of rare earths in rare earth matrix. For the determination of Dy and Tb in Y 2 O 3 , sensitive lines of Dy and Tb are selected from the instrument wavelength table and spectral interference free emission lines for the determination is selected by scanning around the selected wavelengths using 5 g/L Y solution and 5 mg/L standard solutions of Dy and Tb prepared in 4% nitric acid. It is found 353.170 nm line of Dy and 350.917 nm line Tb is suitable for quantitative determination. The signal to background ratio increases with increase in matrix concentration, i.e. from 1 to 5 mg/L. The optimum forward power is determined and it is found to be 1100W for Dy and 1000W for Tb. The instrument is calibrated using matrix matched standards containing 5g/L of Y matrix. Samples are dissolved in nitric acid and Y concentration is maintained at 5g/L.

Recently, use of Erbium oxide as structural coating material in fusion reactor has stimulated the interest in obtaining Erbium in pure form. The separation of Erbium from other rare earths such as Dy, Ho, Y, Yb, Tm etc is very difficult due to low separation factor owing to their similar chemical properties. Additionally due to very low concentration ( 2 O 3 : 1.09, Dy 2 O 3 : 58.07, Er 2 O 3 : 22.0, Ho 2 O 3 : 13.33, Yb 2 O 3 : 4.74, Tm 2 O 3 :0.67 is obtained during purification of Y by Aliquat 336 from thiocyanate medium. In the present investigation this HRE fraction is taken as the feed material for up-gradation of Er by an acidic extractant namely 2 ethyl hexyl - 2 ethyl hexyl phosphonic acid (EHEHPA)\n\nStudy of the densification of uranium-erbium system\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFreitas, Artur C.; Carvalho, Elita F.U.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe sintering process of UO 2 -Er 2 O 3 pellets has been investigated because of its importance in the nuclear industry and the complex behavior during sintering. The present study includes the development of nuclear fuel for power reactor in order to increase the efficiency of the fuel trough longer refueling intervals. The erbium is indicated for longer cycles, which means less stops to refueling and less waste. In this work, we studied the use of erbium oxide by varying the concentrations in the range of 1-9.8%, which was added to UO 2 powder through mechanical mixing, aiming to check the rate of densification and a possible sintering blockage. The powders were pressed and sintered at 1700Â°C under hydrogen atmosphere. The results show a sintering blockage in the UO 2 -Er 2 O 3 system that occurs in the range of 1500-1700Â°C temperature. Dilatometric tests indicate a retraction of 21.87% when used Er 2 O 3 at 1% mass concentration. This shrinkage is greater than is observed with higher concentrations or even without the addition of the burnable poison, providing with a better degree of incorporation of the element erbium, resulting in pellets with density suitable for use as nuclear fuel.

High-purity aluminium samples and mixtures containing different amounts of alumina were irradiated by 13 MeV 3 He particles. The aim of the investigation was to determine the oxide-layer thickness on the surface of internal aluminium granules. The measurement was carried out by determining the bulk oxygen concentration in the samples, and calculating the oxide-layer thickness, by using model conditions about the microstructure of the aluminium samples.

R.; Kabiraj, D.; Ojha, S.; Mandal, S.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nHigh vacuum evaporation and cold-rolling techniques to fabricate thin films of the rare earth lanthanide-erbium have been discussed in this communication. Cold rolling has been used for the first time to successfully fabricate films of enriched and highly expensive erbium metal with areal density in the range of 0.5-1.0 mg/cm2. The fabricated films were used as target materials in an advanced nuclear physics experiment. The experiment was designed to investigate isomeric states in the heavy nuclei mass region for exploring physics related to nuclear energy sources. The films fabricated using different techniques varied in thickness as well as purity. Methods to fabricate films with thickness of the order of 0.9 mg/cm2 were different than those of 0.4 mg/cm2 areal density. All the thin films were characterized using multiple advanced techniques to accurately ascertain levels of contamination as well as to determine their exact surface density. Detailed fabrication methods as well as characterization techniques have been discussed.\n\nPerioral Rejuvenation With Ablative Erbium Resurfacing.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCohen, Joel L\n\n2015-11-01\n\nSince the introduction of the scanning full-field erbium laser, misconceptions regarding ablative erbium resurfacing have resulted in its being largely overshadowed by ablative fractional resurfacing. This case report illustrates the appropriateness of full-field erbium ablation for perioral resurfacing. A patient with profoundly severe perioral photodamage etched-in lines underwent full-field ablative perioral resurfacing with an erbium laser (Contour TRL, Sciton Inc., Palo Alto, CA) that allows separate control of ablation and coagulation. The pre-procedure consultations included evaluation of the severity of etched-in lines, and discussion of patient goals, expectations, and appropriate treatment options, as well as a review of patient photos and post-treatment care required. The author generally avoids full-field erbium ablation in patients with Fitzpatrick type IV and above. For each of 2 treatment sessions (separated by approximately 4 months), the patient received (12 cc plain 2% lidodaine) sulcus blocks before undergoing 4 passes with the erbium laser at 150 Î¼ ablation, no coagulation, and then some very focal 30 Î¼ ablation to areas of residual lines still visualized through the pinpoint bleeding. Similarly, full-field ablative resurfacing can be very reliable for significant wrinkles and creping in the lower eyelid skin--where often a single treatment of 80 Î¼ ablation, 50 Î¼ coagulation can lead to a nice improvement. Standardized digital imaging revealed significant improvement in deeply etched rhytides without significant adverse events. For appropriately selected patients requiring perioral (or periorbital) rejuvenation, full-field ablative erbium resurfacing is safe, efficacious and merits consideration.\n\nStudy of the densification of uranium-erbium system\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nFreitas, Artur C.; Carvalho, Elita F.U., E-mail: artur.freitas@ipen.br, E-mail: elitaucf@ipen.br [Instituto de Pesquisas Energeticas e Nucleares (IPEN/CNEN-SP), Sao Paulo, SP (Brazil)\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThe sintering process of UO{sub 2}-Er{sub 2}O{sub 3} pellets has been investigated because of its importance in the nuclear industry and the complex behavior during sintering.

The vast majority of experiments focused on quantum degenerate atomic gases with short-range contact interaction between particles. Atomic species with large magnetic dipole moments, such as chromium, dysprosium, and erbium, offer unique possibilities to investigate phenomena arising from dipolar interaction. This kind of interaction is not only long-range but also anisotropic in character and imprints qualitatively novel features on the system. Prominent examples are the d-wave collapse of a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate of chromium atoms realized by the group in Stuttgart, the spin magnetization and demagnetization dynamics observed by groups in Stuttgart, Paris, and Stanford, and the deformation of the Fermi surface observed by our group in Innsbruck. This thesis reports on the creation and study of the first Bose-Einstein condensate and degenerate Fermi gas of erbium atoms. Erbium belongs to the lanthanide group of elements and has a large magnetic moment of seven Bohr magneton. In particular, this thesis describes the experimental apparatus and the sequence for producing a dipolar quantum gas. There is an emphasis on the production of the narrow-line magneto-optical trap of erbium since this represents a very efficient and robust laser-cooling scheme that greatly simplifies the experimental procedure. After describing the experimental setup this thesis focuses on several fundamental questions related to the dipolar character of erbium and to its lanthanide nature. A first set of studies centers on the scattering properties of ultracold erbium atoms, including the elastic and the inelastic cross section and the spectrum of Feshbach resonances. Specifically, we observe that identical dipolar fermions do collide and rethermalize even at low temperatures\n\nErbium diffusion in titanium dioxide\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLouise Basse\n\n2017-04-01\n\nFull Text Available The diffusivity of erbium in the anatase phase of titanium dioxide (TiO2 has been studied for various temperatures ranging from 800 Â°C to 1, 000 Â°C. Samples of TiO2, with a 10 nm thick buried layer containing 0.5 at% erbium, were fabricated by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering and subsequently heat treated. The erbium concentration profiles were measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry, allowing for determination of the temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients. These were found to follow an Arrhenius law with an activation energy of ( 2.1 Â± 0.2 eV.

Five sequential ion-exchange columns with a retention capacity of 170 g each have been used. The ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) was used as eluent. The cerium content has been determined by gravimetry and iodometry techniques. The resulting cerium oxide has a purity > 99%.

By using a coprecipitation method, the high quality indium tin oxide (ITO) were prepared with an average diameter of 34.1 nm. We used a typical Z-scan scheme involving a balanced twin-detector measurement system to investigated nonlinear optical properties of the ITO nanoparticles. The saturation intensity and modulation depths are 13.21 MW/cm2 and 0.48%, respectively. In an erbium-doped fiber (EDF) lasers, we using the ITO nanoparticles as saturable absorber (SA), and the formation of dark soliton is experimentally demonstrated. The generated dark solitons are centered at the wavelength of 1561.1 nm with a repetition rate of 22.06 MHz. Besides, the pulse width and pulse-to-pulse interval of the dark solitons is â¼1.33ns and 45.11 ns, respectively.

The best pyrolysis and atomization temperatures were determined for each lanthanide considered. Calibration curves were obtained for the pure elements, for binary mixtures formed by the matrix and each of the lanthanides studied and, finally, for the complex mixtures constituted by the matrix and all the other lanthanide of the group under scrutiny. This study has been carried out to examine the interference of the presence of one lanthanide on the behaviour of the other, since a lack of linearity on the calibration curves has been observed in some cases. Detection and determination limits have been determined as well. The detection limits encountered were within the range 0.002 to 0.3% for different elements. The precision of the method expressed as the relative standard deviation was calculated for each element present in each of the matrices studied. The conclusion arrived at is that the method can be applied for determining the above mentioned lanthanides present in the matrices studied with purity up to 99.50%.

The as-produced SWCNT samples were heat-treated in air for 20 h at 275-475Â°C and characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopes and TGA to establish oxidation temperature ranges of SWCNTs and carbonaceous impurities comprising the samples. Based on these oxidation temperature ranges, derivative thermogravimetric curves were deconvoluted, and differentiated peaks were assigned to SWCNTs and carbonaceous impurities. The compositions and the SWCNT purities of the samples were obtained simply by calculating the areal ratios under the deconvoluted curves. TGA studies on purity evaluation and thermal stabilities of SWCNTs and carbonaceous impurities are likely to provide us with a simple route of thermal oxidation purification to acquire high-purity SWCNT samples.\n\nRare earth impurities in high purity lanthanum oxide determined by neutron activation analysis\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nNguyen Van Suc; Desai, H.B.; Parthasarathy, R.; Gangadharan, S.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nIndividual rare earth impurities in high purity La 2 O 3 (â¥99.9%) have been determined by NAA after pre-separation of the matrix (La).

Synthesis of high-purity silane starts with a temperature assisted reaction of metallurgical silicon with alcohol in the presence of a catalyst. Alcoxysilanes formed in the silicon-alcohol reaction are separated from other products and purified. Simultaneous reduction and oxidation of alcoxysilanes produces gaseous silane and liquid secondary products, including, active part of a catalyst, tetra-alcoxysilanes, and impurity compounds having silicon-hydrogen bonds. Silane is purified by an impurity adsorption technique. Unreacted alcohol is extracted and returned to the reaction with silicon. Concentrated mixture of alcoxysilanes undergoes simultaneous oxidation and reduction in the presence of a catalyst at the temperature -20.degree. C. to +40.degree. C. during 1 to 50 hours. Tetra-alcoxysilane extracted from liquid products of simultaneous oxidation and reduction reaction is directed to a complete hydrolysis. Complete hydrolysis of tetra-alcoxysilane results in formation of industrial silica sol and alcohol. Alcohol is dehydrated by tetra-alcoxysilane and returned to the reaction with silicon.\n\nMIS High-Purity Plutonium Oxide Metal Oxidation Product TS707001 (SSR123): Final Report\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nVeirs, Douglas Kirk [Los Alamos National Lab.

Sample TS707001 represents process plutonium oxides from several metal oxidation operations as well as impure and scrap plutonium from Hanford that are currently stored in 3013 containers. After calcination to 950Â°C, the material contained 86.98% plutonium with no major impurities. This study followed over time, the gas pressure of a sample with nominally 0.5 wt% water in a sealed container with an internal volume scaled to 1/500th of the volume of a 3013 container. Gas compositions were measured periodically over a six year period. The maximum observed gas pressure was 138 kPa. The increase over the initial pressure of 80 kPa was primarily due to generation of nitrogen and carbon dioxide gas in the first six months. Hydrogen and oxygen were minor components of the headspace gas. At the completion of the study, the internal components of the sealed container showed signs of corrosion, including pitting.\n\nErbium-Based Perfusion Contrast Agent for Small-Animal Microvessel Imaging\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJustin J.

Temperature ramp experiments with thin erbium films indicated a significant reaction above 300 0 C, preceded by desorption of water vapor, hydrogen and nitrogen and/or carbon monoxide from the film surface. The sticking coefficients were plotted as a function of Langmuirs of carbon dioxide exposure. Between 400 and 600 0 C, the length of the exposure was found to be more important than the temperature of the exposure in determining the sticking coefficient. Some evolution of carbon monoxide was noted particularly in the 400 to 500 0 C region. An 80% conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide was measured at 500 0 C. The film pumping speeds were compared with published vapor pressure data for erbium.

In addition to easier handling due to all solid state technology, especially when operated in the fundamental mode, IR-PRK eliminates the potential of mutagenic side effects associated with UV-PRK. However, a successful IR-PRK for the clinic treatment in the near future demands both technological development of erbium lasers in different operation modes and clinical investigation of interaction between 3 micrometers radiation and human corneas. The excellent cooperation between university, company and hospital makes this possible. Uncoated thin plates made from infrared materials were found to be effective etalon reflectors with high damage threshold as high as 1 GW/cm2 for erbium lasers. Four kinds of such reflectors were successfully tested in Q-switched Er:YAG-laser at 2.94 micrometers and Er:Cr:YSGG-laser at 2.80 micrometers. Very stable operation of our erbium lasers with high output energy both in free-running and Q-switched modes is realized. First infrared photorefractive keratectomy (IR-PRK) for myopic correction in human corneas by a free-running erbium laser based on our new construction concepts was achieved.\n\nErbium doped stain etched porous silicon\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGonzalez-Diaz, B.; Diaz-Herrera, B.; Guerrero-Lemus, R.; Mendez-Ramos, J.; Rodriguez, V.D.; Hernandez-Rodriguez, C.; Martinez-Duart, J.M.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nIn this work a simple erbium doping process applied to stain etched porous silicon layers (PSLs) is proposed. This doping process has been developed for application in porous silicon solar cells, where conventional erbium doping processes are not affordable because of the high processing cost and technical difficulties. The PSLs were formed by immersion in a HF/HNO 3 solution to properly adjust the porosity and pore thickness to an optimal doping of the porous structure. After the formation of the porous structure, the PSLs were analyzed by means of nitrogen BET (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller) area measurements and scanning electron microscopy. Subsequently, the PSLs were immersed in a saturated erbium nitrate solution in order to cover the porous surface. Then, the samples were subjected to a thermal process to activate the Er 3+ ions. Different temperatures and annealing times were used in this process. The photoluminescence of the PSLs was evaluated before and after the doping processes and the composition was analyzed by Fourier transform IR spectroscopy\n\nErbium: alternative poison? stabilisation additive? what future?\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPorta, J.; Asou, M.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nErbium was proposed as alternative poison to gadolinium at a very early stage. The potential interest of this poison compared to gadolinium is that it presents a relatively low ( 167 Er) absorption cross section in the thermal range and a non-negligible resonance integral that lead to a relatively slow consumption kinetic rather adapted to long or even very long cycles. The poisoning mode adapted to this poison, homogeneous in low concentration (< 3 %), does not downgrade the power distribution, on the one hand, as the absorption is low and spatially homogeneous, and the thermal conductivity, on the other hand, as the addition in the fuel oxide is in low quantity. A review of knowledge acquired as regards Er, from the 1960's to now, is presented.

The results showed good crystallization of coating by baking in high purity flowing-argon at 973 K, and indicated that a little oxygen in baking atmosphere is necessary to crystallization of coating. The best baking temperature could be thought as 973 K, to get good crystallization of coating and avoid strong oxidation of steel substrate. The deuterium permeation test was performed for coated and bare 316ss, to evaluate the property of Er 2 O 3 sol-gel coating as a potential tritium permeation barrier. In this study, the deuterium permeability of coated 316ss is about 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than that of bare 316ss, and is about 2-3 orders of magnitude than the referred data of bare Eurofer97 and F82H martensitic steel.\n\nMIS High-Purity Plutonium Oxide Hydride Product 5501579 (SSR124): Final Report\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nVeirs, Douglas Kirk [Los Alamos National Lab.

Sample 5501579 represents process plutonium oxides from hydride oxide from Rocky Flats that are currently stored in 3013 containers. After calcination to 950Â°C, the material contained 87.42% plutonium with no major impurities. This study followed over time, the gas pressure of a sample with nominally 0.5 wt% water in a sealed container with an internal volume scaled to 1/500th of the volume of a 3013 container. Gas compositions were measured periodically over a six year period. The maximum observed gas pressure was 124 kPa. The increase over the initial pressure of 70 kPa was primarily due to generation of nitrogen and carbon dioxide gas. Hydrogen and oxygen were minor components of the headspace gas. At the completion of the study, the internal components of the sealed container showed signs of corrosion.\n\nActivation of erbium films for hydrogen storage\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBrumbach, Michael T.; Ohlhausen, James A.; Zavadil, Kevin R.; Snow, Clark S.; Woicik, Joseph C.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nHydriding of metals can be routinely performed at high temperature in a rich hydrogen atmosphere. Prior to the hydrogen loading process, a thermal activation procedure is required to promote facile hydrogen sorption into the metal. Despite the wide spread utilization of this activation procedure, little is known about the chemical and electronic changes that occur during activation and how this thermal pretreatment leads to increased rates of hydrogen uptake. This study utilized variable kinetic energy X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to interrogate the changes during in situ thermal annealing of erbium films, with results confirmed by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and low energy ion scattering. Activation can be identified by a large increase in photoemission between the valence band edge and the Fermi level and appears to occur over a two stage process. The first stage involves desorption of contaminants and recrystallization of the oxide, initially impeding hydrogen loading. Further heating overcomes the first stage and leads to degradation of the passive surface oxide leading to a bulk film more accessible for hydrogen loading.\n\nEnhanced local piezoelectric response in the erbium-doped ZnO nanostructures prepared by wet chemical synthesis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nReza Zamiri\n\n2017-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Pure and erbium (Er doped ZnO nanostructures were prepared by simple and cost effective wet chemical precipitation method. The successful doping with phase purity of prepared ZnO nanostructure was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD and their Rietveld analysis. The change in structural morphology of nanoscale features of prepared ZnO nanopowders on Er doping was observed from their scanning electron microscopy (SEM images. The presence of Er in prepared ZnO nanopowder was further confirmed from corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX spectra of scanned SEM images. Piezoelectric properties of before (green samples and after sintering of consolidated compact of synthesized nanopowders were successfully measured. The out-of-plane (effective longitudinal and in-plane (effective shear coefficients of the samples were estimated from the local piezoresponse.\n\nStudy on erbium loading method to improve reactivity coefficients for low radiotoxic spent fuel HTGR\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nFukaya, Y., E-mail: fukaya.yuji@jaea.go.jp; Goto, M.; Nishihara, T.\n\n2015-11-15\n\nHighlights: â¢ We attempted and optimized erbium loading methods to improve reactivity coefficients for LRSF-HTGR. â¢ We elucidated the mechanism of the improvements for each erbium loading method by using the Bondarenko approach. â¢ We concluded the erbium loading method by embedding into graphite shaft is preferable. - Abstract: Erbium loading methods are investigated to improve reactivity coefficients of Low Radiotoxic Spent Fuel High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (LRSF-HTGR). Highly enriched uranium is used for fuel to reduce the generation of toxicity from uranium-238. The power coefficients are positive without the use of any additive. Then, the erbium is loaded into the core to obtain negative reactivity coefficients owing to the large resonance the peak of neutron capture reaction of erbium-167. The loading methods are attempted to find the suitable method for LRSF-HTGR. The erbium is mixed in a CPF fuel kernel, loaded by binary packing with fuel particles and erbium particles, and embedded into the graphite shaft deployed in the center of the fuel compact. It is found that erbium loading causes negative reactivity as moderator temperature reactivity, and from the viewpoint of heat transfer, it should be loaded into fuel pin elements for pin-in-block type fuel. Moreover, the erbium should be incinerated slowly to obtain negative reactivity coefficients even at the End Of Cycle (EOC). A loading method that effectively causes self-shielding should be selected to avoid incineration with burn-up. The incineration mechanism is elucidated using the Bondarenko approach. As a result, it is concluded that erbium embedded into graphite shaft is preferable for LRSF-HTGR to ensure that the reactivity coefficients remain negative at EOC.\n\nFused salt processing of impure plutonium dioxide to high-purity plutonium metal\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMullins, L.J.; Christensen, D.C.; Babcock, B.R.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nA process for converting impure plutonium dioxide (approx. 96% pure) to high-purity plutonium metal (>99.9%) was developed. The process consists of reducing the oxide to an impure plutonium metal intermediate with calcium metal in molten calcium chloride. The impure intermediate metal is cast into an anode and electrorefined to produce high-purity plutonium metal. The oxide reduction step is being done now on a 0.6-kg scale with the resulting yield being >99.5%. The electrorefining is being done on a 4.0-kg scale with the resulting yield being 80 to 85%. The purity of the product, which averages 99.98%, is essentially insensitive to the purity of the feed metal. The yield, however, is directly dependent on the chemical composition of the feed. To date, approximately 250 kg of impure oxide has been converted to pure metal by this processing sequence. The availability of impure plutonium dioxide, together with the need for pure plutonium metal, makes this sequence a valuable plutonium processing tool\n\nThe effect of foil purity on morphology of anodized nanoporous ZrO{sub 2}\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nWierzbicka, Ewa; Syrek, Karolina [Department of Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Ingardena 3, 30-060 Krakow (Poland); Sulka, Grzegorz D., E-mail: sulka@chemia.uj.edu.pl [Department of Physical Chemistry & Electrochemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Ingardena 3, 30-060 Krakow (Poland); Pisarek, Marcin; Janik-Czachor, Maria [Institute of Physical Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kasprzaka 44/52, 01-224 Warsaw (Poland)\n\n2016-12-01\n\nHighlights: â¢ Anodization of Zr with different purities in an aqueous electrolyte was studied. â¢ The structural parameters of formed anodic oxides were compared. â¢ Effect of Zr foil purity on the hexagonal arrangement of pores and cells in anodic ZrO{sub 2} was investigated. â¢ Current efficiency and rate of anodic oxide formation were estimated. - Abstract: A two-step electrochemical formation of nanoporous zirconium oxide layers on different zirconium foils (purity 99.2% and 99.8%) was investigated. Anodizations were carried out at 20 V in an electrolyte composed of 1 M (NH{sub 4}){sub 2}SO{sub 4} and 0.15 M NH{sub 4}F. It was found that the thickness of grown oxide layer, and consequently, the rate of oxide formation depend slightly on the Zr substrate purity. The pore nucleation and anodization process occur easier in the presence of higher concentration of impurities. From top view SEM images, the structural parameters of oxide layers such as pore diameter, interpore distance, pore density, wall thickness and porosity of anodic oxide layers were estimated for both types of used substrates. On the other hand, cell size, intercell distance and cell density were evaluated from the bottom side of anodic oxide layers. A special emphasis was put on the qualitative analysis of hexagonal arrangement of nanopores and cells. The nanopore and cells arrangements in formed oxides were evaluated using various approaches based on Delaunay triangulations, angular distribution functions (ADFs) and pair distribution functions (PDFs). These results were supported by calculations of percentage of defective pores and cells for both types of used Zr substrates. The use of low purity Zr for anodizing does not affect drastically the morphology of formed nanoporous zirconia and offers a promising perspective to reduce production costs and increase availability of this material.\n\nHigh-performace cladding-pumped erbium-doped fibre laser and amplifier\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKotov, L V; Likhachev, M E; Bubnov, M M; Medvedkov, O I; Lipatov, D S; Vechkanov, N N; Guryanov, Aleksei N\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWe report cladding-pumped erbium-doped fibre laser and amplifier configurations.

Erbium salts meet all the previously listed characteristics and today they are emerging as a valuable catalytic solution to a number of organic transformations needing a Lewis acid catalyst in wet conditions or under alternative heating sources. This review aims to summarize the application of erbium salts in green organic transformations, with particular emphasis on their versatility under both homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions. The erbium saltsâ role in bifunctional catalysis is also presented.\n\nGeneralized rate-equation analysis of excitation exchange between silicon nanoclusters and erbium ions\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKenyon, A. J.; Wojdak, M.; Ahmad, I.; Loh, W. H.; Oton, C. J.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nWe discuss the use of rate equations to analyze the sensitization of erbium luminescence by silicon nanoclusters. In applying the general form of second-order coupled rate-equations to the Si nanocluster-erbium system, we find that the photoluminescence dynamics cannot be described using a simple rate equation model. Both rise and fall times exhibit a stretched exponential behavior, which we propose arises from a combination of a strongly distance-dependent nanocluster-erbium interaction, along with the finite size distribution and indirect band gap of the silicon nanoclusters. Furthermore, the low fraction of erbium ions that can be excited nonresonantly is a result of the small number of ions coupled to nanoclusters\n\nEnhanced light emission in photonic crystal nanocavities with Erbium-doped silicon nanocrystals\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMakarova, Maria; Sih, Vanessa; Vuckovic, Jelena; Warga, Joe; Li Rui; Dal Negro, Luca\n\n2008-01-01\n\nPhotonic crystal nanocavities are fabricated in silicon membranes covered by thermally annealed silicon-rich nitride films with Erbium-doped silicon nanocrystals. Silicon nitride films were deposited by sputtering on top of silicon on insulator wafers. The nanocavities were carefully designed in order to enhance emission from the nanocrystal sensitized Erbium at the 1540 nm wavelength. Experimentally measured quality factors of â¼6000 were found to be consistent theoretical predictions. The Purcell factor of 1.4 was estimated from the observed 20-fold enhancement of Erbium luminescence\n\nThe growth of crystals of erbium hydride\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGrimshaw, J.A.; Spooner, F.J.; Wilson, C.G.; McQuillan, A.D.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nCrystals of the rare-earth hydride ErH 2 have been produced with face areas greater than a square millimetre and corresponding volumes exceeding those of earlier crystals by orders of magnitude. The hydride, which was produced in bulk polycrystalline form by hydriding erbium metal at 950 0 C, has been examined by optical and X-ray techniques. For material of composition ErH 2 and ErHsub(1.8) the size of the grains and their degree of strain appears to depend more on oxygen contamination during formation and on the subsequent cooling procedure, than on the size of erbium metal crystals in the starting material.

A systematic search was conducted through Medline via PubMed, Embase, Cochrane databases, CNKI till December 2016. Randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomized controlled trials, or controlled clinical trials with data comparing the efficacy of erbium laser technology versus traditional drilling for caries removal were included. Fourteen studies were selected in our meta-analysis. Erbium laser technology showed an increased time when removing caries compared with drilling (mean difference: 3.48, 95% confidence interval: 1.90-5.06, PÂ drilling with regard to restoration loss, pulpal vitality, and postoperative sensitivity. Erbium laser technology showed an increased time for cavity preparation compared with traditional drilling. However, erbium laser technology reduced the requirement for local anesthesia. There was no significant difference between erbium laser technology and traditional drilling regarding restoration loss, pulpal vitality, and postoperative sensitivity.

These lanthanides have, during the last few decades, become more widely used in highly specialized technology. High purity, quality 4 N (99.99%) or even 5 N materials are needed for phosphors, lasers, optical fibers, X-ray films, and in contrast fluids for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, in a matrix constisting primarily of a single lanthanide, IDMS alone will not be effective due to isobaric interferences from the main elements or the mono-oxides formed in the ion source. On the other hand, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) may be used, but the detection limit will be in the order of 5 to 10 ppm/W. In this work a combination of HPLC and IDMS has been used to lower the detection limit to 1 ppm/W, where the sample is spiked before separation by HPLC, followed by IDMS analysis of the HPLC- fractions. In some cases the HPLC-process has to be repeated to remove the main element completly. Results are presented for Dy 2 O 3 and Nd 2 O 3 , but similar separating procedures can be applied for other rare earth oxides. 3 refs., 2 figs. 2 tabs\n\nProduction of high purity granular metals: cadmium, zinc, lead\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nShcherban A. P.\n\n2017-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Cadmium, zinc and lead are constituent components of many semiconductor compounds. The obtained high purity distillates and ingots are large-size elements, which is not always convenient to use, and thus require additional grinding, which does not always allow maintaining the purity of the original materials. For the growth of semiconductor and scintillation single crystals it is advisable to use \"friable\" granular high-purity distillates, which can be processed without the risk of contamination. For example, the European low-background experiment LUCIFER required more than 20 kg of high-purity granulated zinc, which was agreed to be supplied by NSC KIPT. This task was then extended to cadmium and lead. Motivated by these tasks, the authors of this paper propose complex processes of deep refining of cadmium, zinc and lead by vacuum distillation. A device producing granules has been developed. The process of granulation of high-purity metals is explored. The purity of produced granules for cadmium and zinc is >99,9999, and >99,9995% for lead granules. To prevent oxidation of metal granules during exposition to air, chemical methods of surface passivation were used. Organic solvent based on dimethylformamide used as a coolant improves the resistance of granules to atmospheric corrosion during the granulation of high purity Cd, Zn and Pb.\n\nMethod for measuring deuterium in erbium deuteride films\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBrangan, J.R.; Thornberg, S.M.; Keenan, M.R.\n\n1997-09-01\n\nDetermining the quantity of deuterium in an erbium deuteride (ErD 2 ) film is essential for assessing the quality of the hydriding process but is a challenging measurement to make. First, the ideal gas law cannot be applied directly due to high temperature (950 degrees C) and low temperature (25 degrees C) regions in the same manifold. Additionally, the metal hydride does not release all of the deuterium rapidly upon heating and metal evaporation occurs during extended heating periods. Therefore, the method developed must provide a means to compensate for temperature inhomogeneities and the amount of deuterium retained in the metal film while heating for a minimal duration. This paper presents two thermal desorption methods used to evaluate the kinetics and equilibria of the deuterium desorption process at high temperatures (950 degrees C). Of primary concern is the evaluation of the quantity of deuterium remaining in these films at the high temperature. A multiple volume expansion technique provided insight into the kinetics of the deuterium evolution and metal evaporation from the film. Finally a repeated pump-down approach yielded data that indicated approximately 10% of the deuterium is retained in the metal film at 950 degrees C and approximately 1 Torr pressure. When the total moles of deuterium determined by this method were divided by the moles of erbium determined by ICP/AES, nearly stochiometric values of 2:1 were obtained for several erbium dideuteride films. Although this work presents data for erbium and deuterium, these methods are applicable to other metal hydrides as well\n\nSteam purity in PWRs\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHopkinson, J.; Passell, T.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nReports that 2 EPRI studies of PWRs prove that impure steam triggers decay of turbine metals. Reveals that EPRI is attempting to improve steam monitoring and analysis, which are key steps on the way to deciding the most cost-effective degree of steam purity, and to upgrade demineralizing systems, which can then reliably maintain that degree of purity. Points out that 90% of all cracks in turbine disks have occurred at the dry-to-wet transition zone, dubbed the Wilson line. Explains that because even very clean water contains traces of chemical impurities with concentrations in the parts-per-billion range, Crystal River-3's secondary loop was designed with even more purification capability; a deaerator to remove oxygen and prevent oxidation of system metals, and full-flow resin beds to demineralize 100% of the secondary-loop water from the condenser. Concludes that focusing attention on steam and water chemistry can ward off cracking and sludge problems caused by corrosion\n\nTunable Q-switched erbium doped fiber laser based on metal transition oxide saturable absorber and refractive index characteristic of multimode interference effects\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMohammed, D.

Electric field is the main driving force for pore growth during anodization. However, impurities in aluminum can disturb the direction of the electric field. To confirm this, we anodized two different aluminum foil samples with high purity (99.999%) and relatively low purity (99.8%), and compared the differences in the surface morphologies of the respective aluminum oxide membranes produced in different electric fields. Branched pores observed in porous alumina surface which was anodized in low-purity aluminum and the size; dimensions of the pores were found to be usually smaller than those obtained from high-purity aluminum.

The setup uses a 7.7Â km dispersion compensating fiber simultaneously as the Brillouin and Raman nonlinear gain media and operates in conjunction with a 3Â m erbium-doped fiber as the linear gain medium. At a Brillouin pump (BP) wavelength of 1530Â nm, where Raman and erbium gains overlap each other, 34 Brillouin Stokes lines having line spacing of 0.075Â nm are created by using a Raman pump power of only 24.1Â dBm, an erbium pump power of about 22.1Â dBm, and a BP power of 6.5Â dBm in the proposed linear cavity. The system is highly efficient and is able to generate many comparable peak-power lines at a low pump power.

The manipulation of these equations allows us to regroup the parameters present in an EDFA, which we have named the A, B, C, D parameters, and they can be obtained experimentally from an erbium-doped fiber. Experimental results show that the measurement of these parameters allow us to estimate with very good correspondence the amplifier gain. (Author)\n\nA Filmy Black-Phosphorus Polyimide Saturable Absorber for Q-Switched Operation in an Erbium-Doped Fiber Laser\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTianxian Feng\n\n2016-11-01\n\nFull Text Available We demonstrate an erbium-doped fiber laser passively Q-switched by a black-phosphorus polyimide film. The multi-layer black-phosphorus (BP nanosheets were prepared via a liquid exfoliation approach exploiting N-methylpyrrolidone as the dispersion liquid. By mixing the BP nanosheets with polyimide (PI, a piece of BPâPI film was obtained after evaporating the mixture in a petri dish. The BPâPI saturable absorber had a modulation depth of 0.47% and was inserted into an erbium-doped fiber laser to realize passive Q-switched operations. The repetition rate of the Q-switched laser increased from 5.73 kHz to 31.07 kHz when the laser pump was enhanced from 31.78 mW to 231.46 mW. Our results show that PI is an excellent host material to protect BP from oxidation, and the BPâPI film can act as a promising nonlinear optical device for laser applications.\n\nMetallic oxide nano-clusters synthesis by ion implantation in high purity Fe10Cr alloy\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nZheng, Ce\n\n2015-01-01\n\nODS (Oxide Dispersed Strengthened) steels, which are reinforced with metal dispersions of nano-oxides (based on Y, Ti and O elements), are promising materials for future nuclear reactors. The detailed understanding of the mechanisms involved in the precipitation of these nano-oxides would improve manufacturing and mechanical properties of these ODS steels, with a strong economic impact for their industrialization. To experimentally study these mechanisms, an analytical approach by ion implantation is used, to control various parameters of synthesis of these precipitates as the temperature and concentration. This study demonstrated the feasibility of this method and concerned the behaviour of alloys models (based on aluminium oxide) under thermal annealing. High purity Fe-10Cr alloys were implanted with Al and O ions at room temperature. Transmission electron microscopy observations showed that the nano-oxides appear in the Fe-10Cr matrix upon ion implantation at room temperature without subsequent annealing. The mobility of implanted elements is caused by the defects created during ion implantation, allowing the nucleation of these nanoparticles, of a few nm in diameter. These nanoparticles are composed of aluminium and oxygen, and also chromium. The high-resolution experiments show that their crystallographic structure is that of a non-equilibrium compound of aluminium oxide (cubic Î³-Al 2 O 3 type). The heat treatment performed after implantation induces the growth of the nano-sized oxides, and a phase change that tends to balance to the equilibrium structure (hexagonal Î±-Al 2 O 3 type). These results on model alloys are fully applicable to industrial materials: indeed ion implantation reproduces the conditions of milling and heat treatments are at equivalent temperatures to those of thermo-mechanical treatments. A mechanism involving the precipitation of nano-oxide dispersed in ODS alloys is proposed in this manuscript based on the obtained experimental results\n\nPolyurethane doped with low-concentration erbium\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nCiobanu, C.; Stoica, E.; Cascaval, C.N.; Rosu, D.; Rosu, L.; State, M.; Emandi, A.; Nemes, I.; Petrescu, F.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nABSTRACT: Polyurethane (PU) with lactate structures inits conformation can be used as a biological and biodegradablepolymer.

Five sequential ion-exchange columns with a retention capacity of 170 g each have been used. The ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) was used as eluent. The cerium content has been determined by gravimetry and iodometry techniques. The resulting cerium oxide has a purity > 99%. This material was transformed in cerium nitrate to be used as precursor for the preparation of Zirconia-ceria ceramics by the coprecipitation technique.

(Christof)\n\n2001-01-01\n\nIn the first part of this thesis we investigate codoping of erbium-doped waveguide materials with different ions in order to increase the efficiency of erbium-doped optical amplifiers. Codoping with ytterbium can overcome the limitations due to the small absorption cross section of Er3+ in Al2O3 at\n\nFast and slow light property improvement in erbium-doped amplifier\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPeng, P. C.; Wu, F. K.; Kao, W. C.; Chen, J.; Lin, C. T.; Chi, S.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis work experimentally demonstrates improvement of the fast light property in erbium-doped amplifiers at room temperature. The difference between the signal power and the pump power associated with bending loss is used to control the signal power at the different positions of the erbium-doped fiber (EDF) to improve the fast light property. Periodic bending of the EDF increases the time advance of the probe signal by over 288%. Additionally, this concept also could improve the fast light property using coherent population oscillations in semiconductor optical amplifiers.\n\nGettering of carbon dioxide by erbium thin films\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMehrhoff, T.K.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nThe interaction of carbon dioxide and erbium thin films is characterized for temperatures in the region of 300 to 900 0 C and partial pressure of carbon dioxide near 5 x 10 -7 Torr. Dynamic film pumping speeds were measured against a mercury diffusion pump of known pumping speed and conductance. A quadrupole mass spectrometer was used to monitor the carbon dioxide flow which originated from a calibrated leak in the 10 -6 standard cm 3 /s range. Data reduction was via a dedicated minicomputer with associated printer/plotter. Temperature ramp experiments with thin erbium films indicated a significant reaction above 300 0 C. The reaction was preceded by the desorption of water vapor, hydrogen and nitrogen and/or carbon monoxide from the film surface\n\nSynthesis and characterization of erbium-doped SiO2 nanoparticles fabricated by using reverse micelle and sol-gel processing\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPark, Hoyyul; Bae, Dongsik\n\n2012-01-01\n\nErbium-doped SiO 2 nanoparticles have been synthesized using a reverse micelle technique combined with metal-alkoxide hydrolysis and condensation.
