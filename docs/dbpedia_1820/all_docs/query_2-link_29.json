The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases.\n\nHumidity\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nMura experiences some seasonal variation in the perceived humidity.\n\nThe muggier period of the year lasts for 2.3 months, from July 6 to September 17, during which time the comfort level is muggy, oppressive, or miserable at least 3% of the time. The month with the most muggy days in Mura is August, with 3.5 days that are muggy or worse.\n\nThe least muggy day of the year is March 9, when muggy conditions are essentially unheard of.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in Mura\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in MuramuggyJanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec0%0%10%10%20%20%30%30%40%40%50%50%60%60%70%70%80%80%90%90%100%100%Mar 90%Mar 90%Aug 1513%Aug 1513%Jul 63%Jul 63%Sep 173%Sep 173%muggymuggyhumidhumidcomfortablecomfortabledrydry\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Mura experiences mild seasonal variation over the course of the year.\n\nThe windier part of the year lasts for 5.2 months, from December 1 to May 7, with average wind speeds of more than 6.5 miles per hour.

Those scores are combined into a single hourly composite score, which is then aggregated into days, averaged over all the years in the analysis period, and smoothed.\n\nOur cloud cover score is 10 for fully clear skies, falling linearly to 9 for mostly clear skies, and to 1 for fully overcast skies.\n\nOur precipitation score, which is based on the three-hour precipitation centered on the hour in question, is 10 for no precipitation, falling linearly to 9 for trace precipitation, and to 0 for 0.04 inches of precipitation or more.\n\nOur tourism temperature score is 0 for perceived temperatures below 50Â°F, rising linearly to 9 for 65Â°F, to 10 for 75Â°F, falling linearly to 9 for 80Â°F, and to 1 for 90Â°F or hotter.\n\nOur beach/pool temperature score is 0 for perceived temperatures below 65Â°F, rising linearly to 9 for 75Â°F, to 10 for 82Â°F, falling linearly to 9 for 90Â°F, and to 1 for 100Â°F or hotter.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Mura typically lasts for 7.0 months (215 days), from around April 8 to around November 9, rarely starting before March 13 or after May 2, and rarely ending before October 20 or after December 2.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in Mura\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in Muragrowing seasonJanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec0%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%50%Apr 850%Apr 850%Nov 950%Nov 990%May 290%May 290%Oct 2090%Oct 2010%Mar 1310%Mar 1310%Dec 210%Dec 2Jul 30100%Jul 30100%NowNowfreezingvery coldcoldcoolcomfortablewarm\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature.

Within 10 miles contains very significant variations in elevation (3,199 feet). Within 50 miles contains large variations in elevation (9,554 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Mura is covered by trees (94%), within 10 miles by trees (57%) and cropland (20%), and within 50 miles by trees (38%) and cropland (25%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Mura, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 2 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Mura.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Mura according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Mura is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Mura and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nBarcelonaâEl Prat Airport (LEBL, 56%, 28 mi, south, -1,503 ft elevation change)\n\nAeroport de Girona - Costa Brava (LEGE, 44%, 43 mi, east, -1,047 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Mura and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
