        "text": "Wearing a sleeveless crew T-shirt and matching black gym shorts over a torn, threadbare blue sweatsuit, 33-year-old Giuseppe Abbagnale leans against the doorway of the Circolo Nautico di Stabia boathouse as the dawn light breathes a nascent green into the Bay of Naples.\n\n\"Where is he?\" growls the 6-foot-2-inch, 196-pound rower. It is 6 A.M. and Abbagnale and his brother Carmine should already be on the water. But Giuseppe (Peppiniello) Di Capua, the 5-3, 110-pound fireplug who has steered the Abbagnales to seven world championships since 1981 and is directing them toward Barcelona and a bid for a third Olympic gold medal, is late again.\n\n\"Where is he?\" Giuseppe asks again, glowering behind his newly grown black beard. Impassive, Carmine gazes out at the water, where a pair of fishermen stand up rowing their rocking wooden boats out to sea.\n\nA few minutes later, the coxswain arrives, looking like an overstuffed sleeping bag in his bulky sweatpants, two sweatshirts and padded blue windbreaker.\n\n\"Sorry guys,\" he says, bustling up to the boathouse. \"Where's the boat? Nice day, isn't it?\"\n\nGiuseppe Abbagnale does not move. \"You didn't do your duty,\" he charges.\n\n\"Duty,\" Di Capua fires back. \"I was up all last night with my 10-day-old baby. And he talks to me about duty.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
