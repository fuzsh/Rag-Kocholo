In contrast, we investigated the behavioral abilities of dopamine-deficient mice in which dopamine signaling was restored to only the medial striatum by viral rescue. These mice displayed intact spatial memory, visuospatial and discriminatory learning. However, acquisition of operant behavior was delayed, and their motivation to obtain food rewards was blunted. We compare these behavioral results with our published results obtained from mice with dopamine signaling restored only to the dorsolateral striatum. We observe that most behaviors are restored with dopamine signaling restored to either brain region and conclude that the action of dopamine in either one of these nonoverlapping striatal areas can support cognitive processes independently of dopamine signaling in the other area.",

        "text": "Results\n\nRestoration of dopaminergic signaling to the VM striatum\n\nTo assess the function of the VM striatum in learning, memory, and motivation, we selectively restored dopaminergic signaling in DD mice by bilaterally injecting CAV2-Cre into the VM striatum. The virus was retrogradely transported and activated Th gene expression in dopaminergic neurons within the VTA. Based on our previous work showing that feeding can be restored to DD mice with viral injections into the striatum (Szczypka et al., 2001; Hnasko et al., 2006), only those mice in which feeding was restored were used for the following experiments; they are referred to as virally rescued or vrDD-VM mice. The control mice for these experiments (sham controls) were also injected with CAV2-Cre at the same coordinates, but they already have an intact Th allele.\n\nTH expression was restored to dopaminergic neurons in the VTA of vrDD-VM mice (Fig. 1A–D), whereas only a few TH-expressing cells could be observed in the SNc of vrDD-VM mice (Fig. 1A–D). In the striatum, TH immunostaining was restored mainly to the core of the nucleus accumbens (Acb) and to the dorsomedial (DM) striatum, with some staining in the shell of the Acb and the olfactory tubercle (Fig. 1E–H). The DL striatum of vrDD-VM mice was completely devoid of TH staining (Fig. 1E–H). Higher resolution images of TH-stained sections from vrDD-VM mice show only a minimum amount of TH-positive immunostaining in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral striatum (supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). To estimate the anterior–posterior extension of TH immunostaining in the medial striatum of vrDD-VM mice, we also analyzed saggital sections. TH immunostaining was abundantly restored in the ventromedial striatum along the full anterior–posterior axis; TH expression in the dorsomedial striatum also extended along the anterior–posterior axis in a uniform manner, but the intensity of TH immunostaining was less intense than in the ventromedial striatum (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Quantitative analysis of DA and its metabolites by HPLC-electrochemical detection revealed that DA in the VM striatum was restored to ∼26% and in the DM striatum to ∼18% of control levels (Table 1). DA content in the DL striatum was ∼2% and in the VL (ventrolateral) striatum ∼4% of control levels, similar to levels found in DD mice (Szczypka et al., 2001). Striatal subregions and a more detailed representation of the minimal and maximum amounts of DA restoration in the striatum of vrDD-VM mice are depicted in supplemental Figures 3 and 4 (available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).\n\nFeeding and locomotion are restored in vrDD-VM mice\n\nAfter surgery, the DD mice were maintained on l-Dopa for 14 d to allow viral reactivation of the conditionally inactive Th genes. The vrDD-VM mice were no longer dependent on l-Dopa for survival and were able to maintain their body weight (Fig. 2A). Locomotor activity by the vrDD-VM mice over a 24 h period was the same as sham controls mice that were injected with CAV2-Cre (Fig. 2B).\n\nMemory and visuospatial learning are restored in vrDD-VM mice\n\nBecause DD mice do not perform any of the following tests (Darvas and Palmiter, 2009), we used caffeine in one group of DD mice to restore activity independently of DA signaling and l-Dopa in another group to test the abilities of DD mice with DA signaling restored to all brain regions. To assess the function of dopaminergic signaling in the VM striatum for memory, we first examined sham control, vrDD-VM, and caffeine- or l-Dopa-stimulated DD mice with an object recognition test. Only sham control animals (p < 0.01) and DD mice that were stimulated during all trials with l-Dopa (p < 0.05) spent significantly more time exploring the novel object during the preference choice test, as confirmed with a t test for differences of mean preferences from 50% (Fig. 3A). However, analysis of the total time spent exploring the sample objects during the first habituation trial showed that sham control, caffeine- and l-Dopa-treated DD mice had similar object exploration, whereas vrDD-VM mice displayed a strong reduction in object exploration (ANOVA, F(3,31) = 9.74, p < 0.01; Bonferroni's post hoc comparison, p < 0.01 for vrDD-VM against any other group) (Fig. 3B). Because the vrDD-VM mice did not explore the objects, it was not possible to draw a conclusion about their object memory.\n\nIn the Morris water maze, vrDD-VM mice were able to swim and to locate the hidden platform over the course of training (Fig. 3C). Two-way ANOVA of the escape latencies revealed significant effects for both training day (F(7,244) = 9.12; p < 0.01), group factors (F(3,244) = 67.01; p < 0.05), and interaction between day and group factors (F(21,244) = 3.01; p < 0.01). Sham control, l-Dopa-treated DD and vrDD-VM mice had no differences in escape latencies, as shown by Bonferroni's post hoc comparison (p > 0.05). Caffeine-treated DD mice did not decrease their escape latencies over the course of training and retained significantly higher escape latencies (each p < 0.01) when compared with other groups. Two-way ANOVA of swim speed showed a significant effect for the group factor only (F(3,244) = 38.81; p < 0.01), with similar swim speeds for l-Dopa- or caffeine-treated DD mice and vrDD-VM mice that were slightly lower than that of control mice (Fig. 3D). Analysis of the probe trials after 4 d of training (ANOVA with Bonferroni's post hoc test) confirmed significant preferences for the quadrant where the platform was hidden during training for sham control (F(3,39) = 16.94; p < 0.01), l-Dopa-treated DD (F(3,23) = 10.12; p < 0.01), and vrDD-VM mice (F(3,39) = 11.63; p < 0.01) (Fig. 3E). Whereas sham control and l-Dopa-treated DD mice preferred the target quadrants significantly over all other quadrants, vrDD-VM mice preferred the target quadrant only over quadrants 1 and 3. Analysis of the probe trials (ANOVA with Bonferroni's post hoc test) after 8 d of training confirmed significant preferences for the quadrant where the platform was hidden during training for sham control (F(3,39) = 24.22; p < 0.01), l-Dopa-treated DD (F(3,23) = 4.88; p < 0.05), and vrDD-VM mice (F(3,39) = 19.89; p < 0.01) (Fig. 3F). DD mice that were trained with caffeine and then tested after injection of l-Dopa (30 mg/kg) had no preference for the target quadrant. We conclude that visuospatial learning and memory in this task were restored in vrDD-VM mice.\n\nCue-dependent learning is restored in vrDD-VM mice\n\nWe also tested DD and vrDD-VM mice in a cue-dependent, discriminatory water-based U-maze. In this maze, mice swim to a choice point where they can see a cue indicating which of the two bent arms contains an escape platform. The location of the correct arm (left vs right) was varied randomly and mice were given 10 trials per day for 5 d. Two-way ANOVA of the percentage of correct trials per day revealed significant effects of group (F(3,140) = 24.18; p < 0.01), number of training days (F(4,140) = 20.40; p < 0.01) (Fig. 3G), and interaction between day and group factors (F(4,140) = 2.33; p < 0.05). As confirmed by Bonferroni's post hoc comparisons, there were no significant differences in learning between sham control, l-Dopa-treated DD and vrDD-VM mice (p > 0.05). Caffeine-treated DD mice did not improve their performance and differed significantly after the second training day from all other groups (p < 0.05), which all showed increased performance over the course of training. We conclude that restitution of DA signaling in vrDD-VM mice restored discriminatory learning.\n\nAcquisition of instrumental reward learning is impaired in vrDD-VM mice\n\nPrevious experiments have shown that DA is necessary for operant conditioning in a simple lever-pressing paradigm for food rewards (Robinson et al., 2007). We used the same operant-conditioning paradigm to examine learning and motivation by vrDD-VM mice. The overall pattern of results showed that vrDD-VM mice learned the instrumental lever-pressing response (Fig. 4A). They improved the number of lever presses per session significantly over the course of training (ANOVA, F(17,161) = 5.04, p < 0.01), but still retained an acquisition deficit when compared with sham control mice (two-way ANOVA, F(1,306) = 126.09, p < 0.01; Bonferroni's post test, p < 0.01 for days 01–05 and p < 0.05 for days 06–08) (Fig. 4A). To test the possibility that lever press responses by vrDD-VM mice resulted from reduced activity in the operant chambers, we also measured the number of food receptacle entries during all training sessions; vrDD-VM had significantly (p < 0.01) reduced magazine entries on the first day of training but had similar number of entries as sham control mice during the remaining training days (Fig. 4B). To assess their motivation to work for rewards, we tested vrDD-VM mice under a 3 h, progressive-ratio training schedule. Two-way ANOVA of the cumulative number of rewards earned per 5 min bin revealed significant effects of group (F(1,595) = 20.03; p < 0.01), time point (F(35,595) = 58.39; p < 0.01) (Fig. 4C), and interaction between day and group factors (F(35,595) = 7.412; p < 0.01). As confirmed by Bonferroni's post hoc comparisons, after 40 min all differences between sham and vrDD-VM mice were significant, suggesting that motivation to work for food rewards is strongly impaired in vrDD-VM mice. We assessed the break point as the time point at which the mice stop lever pressing for >15 min. Sham mice stopped responding after ∼86 min and vrDD-VM mice stopped after ∼ 38 min, significantly earlier than sham mice (t test, p < 0.05).\n\nComparison of the abilities of naive DD, vrDD-VM, and vrDD-DL mice\n\nA direct comparison of the abilities that are restored in vrDD-VM mice with results from our previous study with DD mice that have DA signaling restored to the dorsolateral striatum, vrDD-DL (Darvas and Palmiter, 2009), shows that DD mice could not perform any of the tasks, whereas the performance of most tasks by both groups of virally rescued mice was essentially the same as sham controls (Table 2). Among these tasks, the only difference between the virally rescued mice is that object exploration that was restored in vrDD-DL mice was not restored in vrDD-VM mice, and vrDD-VM mice had a larger motivational deficit. The vrDD-DL mice were reanalyzed using the same procedure as with the vrDD-VM mice (supplemental Fig. 5, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Motivation was estimated as the time point during the progressive-ratio schedule at which animals stopped responding for >15 min; data for vrDD-DL mice from our previous publication were reanalyzed accordingly. The impairment in the acquisition of an operant conditioning task was the same for both vrDD-VM and vrDD-DL mice.\n\nDiscussion\n\nTo evaluate the behavior of mice with DA signaling restricted to only part of the striatum and hence examine whether DA signaling in that brain area can support specific motivational, locomotor, and cognitive functions, we restored Th gene expression in DD mice specifically to dopaminergic neurons that project to the medial striatum. This strategy is fundamentally different from the typical approaches that set out to prevent DA signaling in specific brain regions to assess where DA signaling is necessary to facilitate normal behavior (Ungerstedt, 1971; Sokolowski and Salamone, 1998; Dickinson et al., 2000; Baldo et al., 2002). Although we refer to the mice studied here as vrDD-VM mice based on the site of injection, the mice have DA signaling restored to much of the medial striatum as described below. Nevertheless, there would be no DA signaling in the PFC, hippocampus, amygdala, or hypothalamus.\n\nDD mice can learn certain behaviors like conditioned place preference for morphine (Hnasko et al., 2005), cocaine (Hnasko et al., 2007), and l-Dopa (M. Darvas, unpublished data), a simple water escape task (Denenberg et al., 2004), and a spatial T-maze task (Robinson et al., 2005) even in the absence of DA signaling. However, they are unable to learn operant lever pressing for food rewards (Robinson et al., 2007), the novel object, Morris water maze, or cue-dependent U-maze (Darvas and Palmiter, 2009). Because DD mice are extremely inactive and unmotivated and will die of starvation without daily l-Dopa injections (Zhou and Palmiter, 1995; Palmiter, 2008), we have developed a procedure that allows discriminating between failure of DD mice to learn or to perform tasks. DD mice are trained in the absence of DA signaling but stimulated to locomote by caffeine injections, and then they are tested after training when DA signaling is restored with l-Dopa. If they have learned the task with caffeine but without DA, but failed to show their learning, then they should perform well after restoration of DA signaling. Together with our previous report about operant conditioning in DD mice (Robinson et al., 2007), we demonstrate here that DD mice that were treated with l-Dopa during both training and test sessions could perform the novel object, Morris water maze, or cue-dependent U-maze. Thus, any deficits in these tasks are likely attributable to acute dopamine deficiency and not to developmental abnormalities caused by the genetic manipulations.\n\nOur finding that viral injections into the VM striatum resulted in approximately equal restoration of DA content in both the VM and DM striatum, whereas in the midbrain the expression was predominantly restored to DA neurons of the VTA with only sparse restoration in the SNc indicates that VTA DA neurons not only project to the ventral striatum but also send a substantial number of projections to the DM striatum as well, thus delineating one contiguous DA projection area in the medial striatum. This observation is consistent with reports from retrograde labeling experiments, in which ∼15% of labeled terminals in the dorsal striatum originated from DA cell bodies in the VTA (Ikemoto, 2007). Furthermore, our data suggest that DA neurons projecting from the VTA have a widespread arborization within the striatum, which is consistent with the huge striatal arborization of individual DA neurons that project from the subSNc (Matsuda et al., 2009). Moreover, this DA projection area is congruent with a medial zone of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that are grouped together according to their afferent inputs from cortical, thalamic, hippocampal, and amygdaloid regions (Voorn et al., 2004). Although DA signaling was primarily restored to the medial striatum, there may be a very low level of DA signaling in other striatal regions as indicated by the low level of TH staining and low, but measurable, DA content in the lateral striatum. We were unable to discern any correlation between behavioral performance in the various tasks and the extent of DA restoration in different brain regions.\n\nContrary to observations from rodent models of Parkinson's disease, in which lesioning of DA neurons in the SNc results in deficits of visuospatial function and memory (Da Cunha et al., 2002; Mura and Feldon, 2003; De Leonibus et al., 2007), we did not observe any major deficits in visuospatial function or spatial memory in vrDD-VM mice, even though both the extent of TH staining as well as the DA depletion in the striatum were quite similar between those studies and our genetic model. A major difference between these models is the loss of DA signaling versus DA neuron cell loss, leaving open the possibility that the effects observed in lesioning models might be attributable to loss of cotransmitters and/or the responses to neuronal destruction (Willis and Kennedy, 2004; Palmiter, 2008).\n\nStriatal DA acts via presynaptic actions on glutamatergic afferents to MSNs and through postsynaptic actions on the MSNs themselves, thus regulating the glutamatergic input to MSNs (Sesack et al., 2003). This DA modulation of MSNs is highly important for striatal function as several studies report similar effects for blockade of DA signaling and blockade of MSN function in the striatum (Smith-Roe and Kelley, 2000; Corbit et al., 2001; Ishiwari et al., 2004; Bari and Pierce, 2005; Faure et al., 2005). One hypothesis about the striatal function of DA assumes that the striatum is organized in four regions that underlie different association processes that are posited to play a key role in behavioral variation and selection (Ikemoto, 2007). Projections to the VM striatum are proposed to be important for pavlovian types of associations linking cues to particular outcomes. The dorsal striatum is assumed to be divided in a medial system that supports action–goal associations and a lateral system participating in stimulus–response associations. Both these systems are thought to contribute to behavioral selection and are an important part of instrumental learning. One corollary of this theoretical framework is the proposition of a serial cascade of striato-nigral-striatal connectivity through which neuronal signaling from the VM striatum exerts control over processes in DL striatal regions, promoting the transition from goal-directed to habit-driven behaviors (Everitt and Robbins, 2005; Vanderschuren et al., 2005; Belin and Everitt, 2008). But our recent finding that mice with DA signaling restored exclusively to the DL striatum have intact visuospatial and discriminatory learning suggests that this serial processing is not an absolute requirement for learning (Darvas and Palmiter, 2009). Although DA signaling in the DL striatum allowed the mice to learn an instrumental lever-pressing task (Darvas and Palmiter, 2009), acquisition was greatly delayed, which might be attributable to a lack of DA in the DM striatum. Yet our finding that mice that have DA signaling only in the medial striatum still retain a substantial deficit in acquiring an instrumental task argues that proper acquisition of an instrumental response relies on signaling to both the medial and DL striatal areas and that later on the expression of the learned behavior can be supported by either two of these areas. Indeed, experiments in which MSNs were inactivated temporarily with GABAA agonists provide evidence that the ventral striatum might only transiently facilitate early learning, because during later phases of learning inactivation of the nucleus accumbens had only minor effects (Smith-Roe and Kelley, 2000; Hernandez et al., 2002; Ito et al., 2004; Atallah et al., 2007). However, it is also possible that restoration of DA to levels higher than those found in vrDD-VM mice is needed to overcome the deficits in operant conditioning that we observed here.\n\nInterestingly, comparison of the abilities of both vrDD-DL and vrDD-VM mice reveals that, with the exception of object exploration, both striatal areas are capable of supporting the same behaviors. This suggests that both spatial, discriminatory, and instrumental learning as well as spatial reference memory do not depend on dopamine signaling in a confined striatal area, even though DL or medial striatum have substantially different neuronal connections (Voorn et al., 2004). Signaling in these areas might still be based on different cognitive processes but support mastery of the cognitive tasks equally well. Future experiments will be necessary to determine whether the mouse behaviors observed with these rescued mice are goal directed or habit driven.\n\nTogether with evidence for the engagement of parallel striatal processes during spatial, procedural, and cue-dependent learning from previous reports (Devan and White, 1999; Hikosaka et al., 1999), our results fit well with the view that the learning process is very dynamic and recruits parallel neural circuits including the medial and DL regions of the striatum (Graybiel, 2008). This hypothesis does not preclude the possibility that once a behavior has become a habit that it will then rely primarily on DA signaling to the DL striatum or even extrastriatal areas. Another conclusion from our comparison of DA signaling in the DL and medial striatum of virally rescued DD mice is that motivation to engage in instrumental behavior appears to be dependent on signaling in different striatal subregions and that the drive to engage in explorative behavior might rely more on the DL striatum. However, the mechanisms underlying these differences between DA signaling in the DL and medial striatum are not necessarily equal; the reduced performance under a progressive-ratio schedule can result from both an impaired motivation and/or reduced incentive value of the reinforcer. The deficit seen in vrDD-VM mice could still be attributable to a motor deficit. Future studies probing the locomotor skills necessary for lever pressing in both vrDD-DL and vrDD-VM mice will resolve this issue."
