The first to fourth short period undulators SGU#17, SGU#03, SGU#01 and SGU#15 were installed at the 2.5-GeV Photon Factory storage ring in 2005, 2006, 2009 and 2013, respectively.

Piezo-driven linear stages are used as coarse stages of the microscope to realize excellent compactness, mobility, and vibrational and thermal stability. An X-ray beam with an intensity of â¼10{sup 7} photons/s was focused to a diameter of â¼40 nm at the sample. At the soft X-ray undulator beamline used with the microscope, a wide range of photon energies (250â1600 eV) is available. The microscope has been used to research energy materials and in environmental sciences.\n\nCharacterization of undulator radiation at the photon factory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMaezawa, Hideki; Suzuki, Yoshio; Kitamura, Hideo; Sasaki, Taizo\n\n1986-05-01\n\nSpectra of undulator radiation of the Photon Factory undulator, model PMU-2, were measured in a scale of absolute brightness in the soft X-ray region for various values of the K-parameter from 0.72 to 1.66. A significant reduction of the peak brightness was observed, whereas we also observed a relatively sharp edge at the high energy side of the first harmonic. The results show that the peak brightness and the band width are highly dependent on the beam parameters and the geometry of spectral observation.\n\nAutomated Sample Exchange Robots for the Structural Biology Beam Lines at the Photon Factory\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHiraki, Masahiko; Watanabe, Shokei; Yamada, Yusuke\n\n2007-01-19\n\nWe are now developing automated sample exchange robots for high-throughput protein crystallographic experiments for onsite use at synchrotron beam lines. It is part of the fully automated robotics systems being developed at the Photon Factory, for the purposes of protein crystallization, monitoring crystal growth, harvesting and freezing crystals, mounting the crystals inside a hutch and for data collection. We have already installed the sample exchange robots based on the SSRL automated mounting system at our insertion device beam lines BL-5A and AR-NW12A at the Photon Factory. In order to reduce the time required for sample exchange further, a prototype ofmoreÂ Â» a double-tonged system was developed.

Thus, in collaboration with Astellas Pharma Inc., we have constructed a new high-throughput macromolecular crystallography beamline, AR-NE3A, which is dedicated to SBDD. At AR-NE3A, a photon flux up to three times higher than those at existing high-throughput beams at the Photon Factory, AR-NW12A and BL-5A, can be realized at the same sample positions.

The beamline system consists of a front-end and two branchlines. One of the branchlines is used for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and radiation biology in the energy range of 1.8-6 keV and the other for X-ray diffractometry and XAFS studies as well as radiation biology in the range of 4-20 keV.

J. B.\n\n2003-08-01\n\nFuture networks will require very high throughput, carrying dominantly data-centric traffic. The role of Photonic Networks employing all-optical systems will become increasingly important in providing scalable bandwidth, agile reconfigurability, and low-power consumptions in the future. In particular, the self-similar nature of data traffic indicates that packet switching and burst switching will be beneficial in the Next Generation Photonic Networks. While the natural conclusion is to pursue Photonic Packet Switching and Photonic Burst Switching systems, there are significant challenges in realizing such a system due to practical limitations in optical component technologies. Lack of a viable all-optical memory technology will continue to drive us towards exploring rapid reconfigurability in the wavelength domain. We will introduce and discuss the advanced optical component technologies behind the Photonic Packet Routing system designed and demonstrated at UC Davis. The system is capable of packet switching and burst switching, as well as circuit switching with 600 psec switching speed and scalability to 42 petabit/sec aggregated switching capacity. By utilizing a combination of rapidly tunable wavelength conversion and a uniform-loss cyclic frequency (ULCF) arrayed waveguide grating router (AWGR), the system is capable of rapidly switching the packets in wavelength, time, and space domains. The label swapping module inside the Photonic Packet Routing system containing a Mach-Zehnder wavelength converter and a narrow-band fiber Bragg-grating achieves all-optical label swapping with optical 2R (potentially 3R) regeneration while maintaining optical transparency for the data payload. By utilizing the advanced optical component technologies, the Photonic Packet Routing system successfully demonstrated error-free, cascaded, multi-hop photonic packet switching and routing with optical-label swapping. This paper will review the advanced optical component technologies\n\nRecent advances in integrated photonic sensors.\n\nPubMed\n\nPassaro, Vittorio M N; de Tullio, Corrado; Troia, Benedetto; La Notte, Mario; Giannoccaro, Giovanni; De Leonardis, Francesco\n\n2012-11-09\n\nNowadays, optical devices and circuits are becoming fundamental components in several application fields such as medicine, biotechnology, automotive, aerospace, food quality control, chemistry, to name a few.

This wide energy range could be achieved by employing two undulators and two monochromators. Two different energy range undulators were installed tandem to a 9-meter straight section of PF storage ring. The 1{sup st} undulator is for VUV (30 eV) to SX (280 eV), while the other one is for SX (280 eV) to HX (4000 eV). It is also necessary to be equipped with two different monochrometors for energy abovemoreÂ Â» and under 2000 eV; grating monochrometor and double crystal monochrometor. One of the main purposes of this bemaline is spectroscopic study of light elements contained in several functional materials.

Current bioethanol and biodiesel can, however, not cover the increasing demand for biofuels and there is therefore a need for advanced biofuels with superior fuel properties. Novel cell factories will provide a production platform for advanced biofuels. However, deep cellular understanding is required for improvement of current biofuel cell factories. Fast screening and analysis (-omics) methods and metabolome-wide mathematical models are promising techniques. An integrated systems approach of these techniques drives diversity and quantity of several new biofuel compounds. This review will cover the recent technological developments that support improvement of the advanced biofuels 1-butanol, biodiesels and jetfuels. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The new system was designed to enable precise and fast measurements to correct the closed-orbit distortion (COD), as well as to feed back the orbit position during user runs. There are 42 BPMs newly installed, amounting to a total of 65 BPMs. All of the BPMs are calibrated on the test bench using a coaxially strung metallic wire. The measured electrical offsets are typically 200 micro m in both directions, which is 1/2-1/3 of those of the old-type BPMs. In the signal-processing system, PIN diode switches are employed in order to improve reliability. In the fastest mode, this system is capable of measuring COD within about 10 ms; this fast acquisition will allow fast suppression of the beam movement for frequencies up to 50 Hz using a global feedback system.\n\nDesign and Construction of a High-speed Network Connecting All the Protein Crystallography Beamlines at the Photon Factory\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMatsugaki, Naohiro; Yamada, Yusuke; Igarashi, Noriyuki\n\n2007-01-19\n\nA private network, physically separated from the facility network, was designed and constructed which covered all the four protein crystallography beamlines at the Photon Factory (PF) and Structural Biology Research Center (SBRC).

The WILGA conferences take place two times a year and the participants are young scientists from this country and abroad. This paper debates chosen topical tracks and some papers presented during the 31 WILGA Multi-Conference, which took place on 8-10 February 2013 at the Faculty of WEiTI PW. The January conference was attended by around 100 persons. Here we discuss closer the subjects of biomedical photonics, electronics and informatics, as well as chosen aspects of applications of advanced photonic, electronic circuits and systems. The 32 nd WILGA Symposium took place on 27 May - 02 June 2013 in WUT WILGA resort near Warsaw. These two editions of WILGA Conferences - January and May have generated more than 250 articles, from which around 100 were chosen by the Symposium and Conference Committees to be published in this volume of Proc.SPIE. WILGA Symposium papers are traditionally submitted via the WILGA web page [wilga.ise.pw.edu.pl] to the SPIE Proceedings publishing system [spie.org]. Email for the correspondence is: photonics@ise.pw.edu.pl. All Wilga papers are published in journals Elektronika, IJET-PAN and in Proc.SPIE.

The approach relies on secondary dispersal of grant funds to commercial developers through a competitive selection process. This \"App Factory\" model balances the practical reliance on multi-year funding needed to sustain a rehabilitation engineering research center (RERC), with the need for agility and adaptability of development efforts undertaken in a rapidly changing technology environment. This approach also allows us to take advantage of technical expertise needed to accomplish a particular development task, and provides incentives to deliver successful products in a cost-effective manner. In this article, we describe the App Factory structure, process, and results achieved to date; and we discuss the lessons learned and the potential relevance of this approach for other grant-funded research and development efforts. Data presented on the direct costs and number of downloads of the 16 app development projects funded in the App Factory's first 3Â years show that it can be an effective means for supporting focused, short-term assistive technology development projects.\n\nAdvances in graphene-based optoelectronics, plasmonics and photonics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNguyen, Bich Ha; Hieu Nguyen, Van\n\n2016-03-01\n\nSince the early works on graphene it has been remarked that graphene is a marvelous electronic material.

One of the flagship beamlines of the APS Upgrade is the In-Situ Nanoprobe beamline (ISN beamline), which will provide in-situ and operando characterization of advanced energy materials and devices under change of temperature and gases, under applied fields, in 3D. The ISN beamline is designed to deliver spatially coherent x-rays with photon energies between 4 keV and 30 keV to the ISN instrument. As an x-ray source, a revolver-type undulator with two interchangeable magnetic structures, optimized to provide high brilliance throughout the range of photon energies of 4 keV - 30 keV, will be used. The ISN instrument will provide a smallest hard x-ray spot of 20 nm using diffractive optics, with sensitivity to sub-10 nm sample structures using coherent diffraction. Using nanofocusing mirrors in Kirkpatrick-Baez geometry, the ISN will also provide a focus of 50 nm with a flux of 8Â·1011 Photons/s at a photon energy of 10 keV, several orders of magnitude larger than what is currently available. This will allow imaging of trace amounts of most elements in the periodic table, with a sensitivity to well below 100 atoms for most metals in thin samples. It will also enable nanospectroscopic studies of the chemical state of most materials relevant to energy science. The ISN beamline will be primarily used to study inorganic and organic photovoltaic systems, advanced batteries and fuel cells, nanoelectronics devices, and materials and systems diesigned to reduce the environmental impact of combustion.\n\nProceedings of the Advanced Photon Source renewal workshop.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGibson, J. M.; Mills, D. M.; Kobenhavns Univ.\n\n2008-12-01\n\nBeginning in March 2008, Advanced Photon Source (APS) management engaged users, facility staff, the distinguished members of the APS Scientific Advisory Committee, and other outside experts in crafting a renewal plan for this premier synchrotron x-ray research facility. It is vital that the investment in the APS renewal begin as soon as possible in order to keep this important U.S. facility internationally competitive. The APS renewal plan encompasses innovations in the beamlines and the x-ray source that are needed for major advances in science - advances that promise to further extend the impact of x-ray science on energy research, technologymoreÂ Â» development, materials innovation, economic competitiveness, health, and far-reaching fundamental knowledge. A planning milestone was the APS Renewal Workshop held on October 20-21, 2008. Organized by the APS Renewal Steering Committee, the purpose of the workshop was to provide a forum where leading researchers could present the broad outlines of forward-looking plans for science at the APS in all major disciplines serviced by x-ray techniques. Two days of scientific presentations, discussions, and dialogue involved more than 180 scientists representing 41 institutions. The scientific talks and breakout/discussion sessions provided a forum for Science Team leaders to present the outlines of forward-looking plans for experimentation in all the major scientific disciplines covered by photon science. These proceedings comprise the reports from the Science Teams that were commissioned by the APS Renewal Steering Committee, having been edited by the Science Teams after discussion at the workshop.Â«Â less\n\nIn-Factory Learning - Qualification For The Factory Of The Future\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nQuint, Fabian; Mura, Katharina; Gorecky, Dominic\n\n2015-07-01\n\nThe Industry 4.0 vision anticipates that internet technologies will find their way into future factories replacing traditional components by dynamic and intelligent cyber-physical systems (CPS) that combine the physical objects with their digital representation. Reducing the gap between the real and digital world makes the factory environment more flexible, more adaptive, but also more complex for the human workers. Future workers require interdisciplinary competencies from engineering, information technology, and computer science in order to understand and manage the diverse interrelations between physical objects and their digital counterpart. This paper proposes a mixed-reality based learning environment, which combines physical objects and visualisation of digital content via Augmented Reality. It uses reality-based interaction in order to make the dynamic interrelations between real and digital factory visible and tangible. We argue that our learning system does not work as a stand-alone solution, but should fit into existing academic and advanced training curricula.\n\nA trial of production of the plant-derived high-value protein in a plant factory: photosynthetic photon fluxes affect the accumulation of recombinant miraculin in transgenic tomato fruits.\n\nPubMed\n\nKato, Kazuhisa; Maruyama, Shinichiro; Hirai, Tadayoshi; Hiwasa-Tanase, Kyoko; Mizoguchi, Tsuyoshi; Goto, Eiji; Ezura, Hiroshi\n\n2011-08-01\n\nOne of the ultimate goals of plant science is to test a hypothesis obtained by basic science and to apply it to agriculture and industry. A plant factory is one of the ideal systems for this trial. Environmental factors affect both plant yield and the accumulation of recombinant proteins for industrial applications within transgenic plants. However, there have been few reports studying plant productivity for recombinant protein in closed cultivation systems called plant factories. To investigate the effects of photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) on tomato fruit yield and the accumulation of recombinant miraculin, a taste-modifying glycoprotein, in transgenic tomato fruits, plants were cultivated at various PPFs from 100 to 400 (Âµmol m(-2) s(-)1) in a plant factory. Miraculin production per unit of energy used was highest at PPF100, although miraculin production per unit area was highest at PPF300. The commercial productivity of recombinant miraculin in transgenic tomato fruits largely depended on light conditions in the plant factory. Our trial will be useful to consider the trade-offs between the profits from production of high-value materials in plants and the costs of electricity.\n\nAdvances in Multi-Pixel Photon Counter technology: First characterization results\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBonanno, G.; Marano, D.; Romeo, G.; Garozzo, S.; Grillo, A.; Timpanaro, M. C.; Catalano, O.; Giarrusso, S.; Impiombato, D.; La Rosa, G.; Sottile, G.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nDue to the recent advances in silicon photomultiplier technology, new types of Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM), also named Multi-Pixel Photon Counter (MPPC) detectors have become recently available, demonstrating superior performance in terms of their most important electrical and optical parameters. This paper presents the latest characterization results of the novel Low Cross-Talk (LCT) MPPC families from Hamamatsu, where a noticeable fill-factor enhancement and cross-talk reduction is achieved. In addition, the newly adopted resin coating has been proven to yield improved photon detection capabilities in the 280-320 nm spectral range, making the new LCT MPPCs particularly suitable for emerging applications like Cherenkov Telescope Array, and Astroparticle Physics.\n\nAdvances in explosives analysisâpartÂ II: photon and neutron methods\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nBrown, Kathryn E.; Greenfield, Margo T.; McGrane, Shawn D.; ...\n\n2015-10-07\n\nThe number and capability of explosives detection and analysis methods have increased dramatically since publication of the Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry special issue devoted to Explosives Analysis [Moore DS, Goodpaster JV, Anal Bioanal Chem 395:245â246, 2009]. Here we review and critically evaluate the latest (the past five years) important advances in explosives detection, with details of the improvements over previous methods, and suggest possible avenues towards further advances in, e.g., stand-off distance, detection limit, selectivity, and penetration through camouflage or packaging. Our review consists of two parts. Part I discussed methods based on animals, chemicals (including colorimetry, molecularly imprinted polymers,moreÂ Â» electrochemistry, and immunochemistry), ions (both ion-mobility spectrometry and mass spectrometry), and mechanical devices. In Part II, we review methods based on photons, from very energetic photons including X-rays and gamma rays down to the terahertz range, and neutrons.Â«Â less\n\nInterleaving lattice for the Argonne Advanced Photon Source linac\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShin, S.; Sun, Y.; Dooling, J.; Borland, M.; Zholents, A.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nTo realize and test advanced accelerator concepts and hardware, a beam line is being reconfigured in the linac extension area (LEA) of the Argonne Advanced Photon Source (APS) linac. A photocathode rf gun installed at the beginning of the APS linac will provide a low emittance electron beam into the LEA beam line. The thermionic rf gun beam for the APS storage ring and the photocathode rf gun beam for the LEA beam line will be accelerated through the linac in an interleaved fashion. In this paper, the design studies for interleaving lattice realization in the APS linac is described with the initial experiment result.\n\nHeterologous Synthesis and Recovery of Advanced Biofuels from Bacterial Cell Factories.\n\nPubMed\n\nMalik, Sana; Afzal, Ifrah; Mehmood, Muhammad Aamer; Al Doghaither, Huda; Rahimuddin, Sawsan Abdulaziz; Gull, Munazza; Nahid, Nazia\n\n2018-01-01\n\nMicrobial engineering to produce advanced biofuels is currently the most encouraging approach in renewable energy. Heterologous synthesis of biofuels and other useful industrial chemicals using bacterial cell factories has radically diverted the attentions from the native synthesis of these compounds. However, recovery of biofuels from the media and cellular toxicity are the main hindrances to successful commercialization of advanced biofuels. Therefore, membrane transporter engineering is gaining increasing attentions from all over the world. The main objective of this review is to explore the ways to increase the microbial production of biofuels by counteracting the cellular toxicity and facilitating their easier recovery from media. Microbial synthesis of industrially viable compounds such as biofuels has been increased due to genomic revolution. Moreover, advancements in protein engineering, gene regulation, pathway portability, metabolic engineering and synthetic biology led the focus towards the development of robust and cost-effective systems for biofuel production. The most convenient way to combat cellular toxicity and to secrete biofuels is the use of membrane transport system. The use of membrane transporters is currently a serious oversight as do not involve chemical changes and contribute greatly to efflux biofuels in extracellular milieu. However, overexpression of transport systems can also be detrimental to cell, so, in future, structure-based engineering of transporters can be employed to evaluate optimum expression range, to increase biofuel specificity and transport rate through structural studies of biofuel molecules.

A lot of unique features can be expected, such as low-power consumption, wafer-level testing, small packaging capability, and so on. The market of VCSELs has been growing up rapidly in recent years, and they are now key devices in local area networks using multimode optical fibers. Also, long wavelength VCSELs are currently attracting much interest for use in single-mode fiber metropolitan area and wide area network applications. In addition, a VCSEL-based disruptive technology enables various consumer applications such as a laser mouse and laser printers. In this paper, the recent advance of VCSEL photonics will be reviewed, which include the wavelength extension of single-mode VCSELs and their wavelength integration/control. Also, this paper explores the potential and challenges for new functions of VCSELs toward optical signal processing.\n\nMagnetic measurements of the injector synchrotron magnets for the advanced photon source\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKim, S.

While some applications, such as analysis of drug-protein interactions, require extremely high resolution and the ability to accurately correct for measurement artifacts, others require sensitivity that is high enough for detection of disease biomarkers in serum with concentrations less than 1 pg/ml. As the analysis of cells becomes increasingly important for studying the behavior of stem cells, cancer cells, and biofilms under a variety of conditions, approaches that enable high resolution imaging of live cells without cytotoxic stains or photobleachable fluorescent dyes are providing new tools to biologists who seek to observe individual cells over extended time periods. This paper will review several recent advances in photonic crystal biosensor detection instrumentation and device structures that are being applied towards direct detection of small molecules in the context of high throughput drug screening, photonic crystal fluorescence enhancement as utilized for high sensitivity multiplexed cancer biomarker detection, and label-free high resolution imaging of cells and individual nanoparticles as a new tool for life science research and single-molecule diagnostics.

However, prohibitively low production rate and mass concentration remain the major hurdles in industrial processes even though the biosynthetic pathways are comprehensively optimized. These limitations are caused by a variety of factors unamenable for host cell survival, such as harsh industrial conditions, fermentation inhibitors from biomass hydrolysates, and toxic compounds including metabolic intermediates and valuable target products. Therefore, engineered microbes with robust phenotypes is essential for achieving higher yield and productivity. In this review, the recent advances in engineering robustness and tolerance of cell factories is described to cope with these issues and briefly introduce novel strategies with great potential to enhance the robustness of cell factories, including metabolic pathway balancing, transporter engineering, and adaptive laboratory evolution. This review also highlights the integration of advanced systems and synthetic biology principles toward engineering the harmony of overall cell function, more than the specific pathways or enzymes.

After that date the particle colliders have increased their intensity, luminosity and energy by several orders of magnitude. Namely, because of the high stored beam currents and high rate of useful physics events (luminosity) the modern electron-positron colliders are called \"factories\". However, the fundamental physics has required luminosities by 1-2 orders of magnitudes higher with respect to those presently achieved. This task can be accomplished by designing a new generation of factories exploiting the potential of a new collision scheme based on the Crab Waist (CW) collision concept recently proposed and successfully tested at Frascati. In this paper we discuss the performance and limitations of the present generation electron-positron factories and give a brief overview of new ideas and collision schemes proposed for further collider luminosity increase. In more detail we describe the CW collision concept and the results of the crab waist collision tests in DAÏNE, the Italian Ï-factory. Finally, we briefly describe most advanced projects of the next generation factories based on the CW concept: SuperB in Italy, SuperKEKB in Japan and SuperC-Tau in Russia.\n\nA Renewal Plan for the Advanced Photon Source\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFischetti, Robert F.; Fuoss, Paul H.; Gerig, Rodney E.\n\n2010-06-23\n\nWith coordination from the APS Renewal Steering Committee (the members of which are the co-authors of this paper), staff and users of the U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory are in the process of developing a renewal plan for the facility. The renewal is a coordinated upgrade of the accelerator, beamlines, and associated technical structure that will enable users of the APS to address key scientific challenges in the coming decades. The cost of the renewal is estimated to be from $300M to $400M and to take approximately six years from start to finish.\n\nRenewal of the Advanced Photon Source.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGibson, J. M.\n\n2008-12-31\n\nTo ensure that state-of-the-art hard x-ray tools are available for US scientists and engineers who are solving key problems in energy, environment, technology development and human health, the nation's unique high-energy x-ray source needs a major renewal of its capabilities. The Advanced Photon Source renewal program responds to key scientific needs driven by our user community. The renewal encompasses many innovations in beamlines and accelerator capabilities, each of which will transform our tools and allow new problems to be solved. In particular the APS renewal dramatically expands two compelling avenues for research. Through x-ray imaging, we can illuminate complex hierarchical structures from the molecular level to the macroscopic level, and study how they change in time and in response to stimuli. Images will facilitate understanding how proteins fit together to make living organisms, contribute to development of lighter, higher-strength alloys for fuel-efficient transportation and advance the use of biomass for alternative fuels. Hard x-rays are also especially suited to the study of real materials, under realistic conditions and in real-time. The advances proposed in this area would help develop more efficient catalysts, enhance green manufacturing, point the way to artificial light-harvesting inspired by biology and help us develop more efficient lighting. The scope of the renewal of our {approx}moreÂ Â» $$1.5B facility is estimated to be {approx}$$350M over five years. It is vital that the investment begin as soon as possible. The renewed APS would complement other national investments such as the National Synchrotron Light Source-II and would keep the U.S. internationally competitive.Â«Â less\n\nNo Photon Left Behind: Advanced Optics at ARPA-E for Buildings and Solar Energy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBranz, Howard M.\n\n2015-04-01\n\nKey technology challenges in building efficiency and solar energy utilization require transformational optics, plasmonics and photonics technologies. We describe advanced optical technologies funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy. Buildings technologies include a passive daytime photonic cooler, infra-red computer vision mapping for energy audit, and dual-band electrochromic windows based on plasmonic absorption. Solar technologies include novel hybrid energy converters that combine high-efficiency photovoltaics with concentrating solar thermal collection and storage. Because the marginal cost of thermal energy storage is low, these systems enable generation of inexpensive and dispatchable solar energy that can be deployed when the sun doesn't shine. The solar technologies under development include nanoparticle plasmonic spectrum splitting, Rugate filter interference structures and photovoltaic cells that can operate efficiently at over 400Â° C.\n\nA closed-loop photon beam control study for the Advanced Light Source\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPortmann, G.; Bengtsson, J.\n\n1993-05-01\n\nThe third generation Advanced Light Source (ALS) will produce extremely bright photon beams using undulators and wigglers. In order to position the photon beams accurate to the micron level, a closed-loop feedback system is being developed. Using photon position monitors and dipole corrector magnets, a closed-loop system can automatically compensate for modeling uncertainties and exogenous disturbances. The following paper will present a dynamics model for the perturbations of the closed orbit of the electron beam in the ALS storage ring including the vacuum chamber magnetic field penetration effects. Using this reference model, two closed-loop feedback algorithms will be compared --moreÂ Â» a classical PI controller and a two degree-of-freedom approach. The two degree-of-freedom method provides superior disturbance rejection while maintaining the desired performance goals. Both methods will address the need to gain schedule the controller due to the time varying dynamics introduced by changing field strengths when scanning the insertion devices.Â«Â less\n\nAdvances in photonics thermal management and packaging materials\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZweben, Carl\n\n2008-02-01\n\nHeat dissipation, thermal stresses, and cost are key packaging design issues for virtually all semiconductors, including photonic applications such as diode lasers, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), solid state lighting, photovoltaics, displays, projectors, detectors, sensors and laser weapons. Heat dissipation and thermal stresses affect performance and reliability. Copper, aluminum and conventional polymeric printed circuit boards (PCBs) have high coefficients of thermal expansion, which can cause high thermal stresses. Most traditional low-coefficient-of-thermal-expansion (CTE) materials like tungsten/copper, which date from the mid 20 th century, have thermal conductivities that are no better than those of aluminum alloys, about 200 W/m-K. There are an increasing number of low-CTE materials with thermal conductivities ranging between that of copper (400 W/m-K) and 1700 W/m-K, and many other new low-CTE materials with lower thermal conductivities. An important benefit of low-CTE materials is that they allow use of hard solders. Some advanced materials are low cost. Others have the potential to be low cost in high-volume production. High-thermal-conductivity materials enable higher power levels, potentially reducing the number of required devices. Advanced thermal materials can constrain PCB CTE and greatly increase thermal conductivity. This paper reviews traditional packaging materials and advanced thermal management materials. The latter provide the packaging engineer with a greater range of options than in the past. Topics include properties, status, applications, cost, using advanced materials to fix manufacturing problems, and future directions, including composites reinforced with carbon nanotubes and other thermally conductive materials.\n\nAdvances in photon counting for bioluminescence\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIngle, Martin B.; Powell, Ralph\n\n1998-11-01\n\nPhoton counting systems were originally developed for astronomy, initially by the astronomical community. However, a major application area is in the study of luminescent probes in living plants, fishes and cell cultures. For these applications, it has been necessary to develop camera system capability at very low light levels -- a few photons occasionally -- and also at reasonably high light levels to enable the systems to be focused and to collect quality images of the object under study. The paper presents new data on MTF at extremely low photon flux and conventional ICCD illumination, counting efficiency and dark noise as a function of temperature.\n\nThe PNC-CAT insertion device beamline at the Advanced Photon Source\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHeald, S. M.; Stern, E. A.; Brown, F. C.; Kim, K. H.; Barg, B.; Crozier, E. D.\n\n1996-09-01\n\nThe PNC-CAT is a consortium of Pacific Northwest institutions formed to instrument a sector (number 20) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). Research is planned in a variety of areas, with an emphasis on environmentally based problems. The insertion device beamline is based on the APS undulator A and will be optimized for producing microbeams as well as for applications requiring energy scanning capabilities. This paper describes the basic layout and some special features of the beamline. Two experimental stations are planned: one general purpose and one dedicated to MBE and surface science problems. Both tapered capillaries and Kirkpatrick-Baez optics will be used for producing microbeams, and a large optical bench is planned for the main station to allow for easy accommodation of new optics developments. Design calculations and initial capillary tests indicate that flux densities exceeding 1011 photons/sec/mm2 should be achievable. All major components are under construction or in procurement, and initial testing is planned for late 1996.\n\nNational photonics skills standards for technicians\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHull, Darrell M.\n\n1995-10-01\n\nPhotonics is defined as the generation, manipulation, transport, detection, and use of light information and energy whose quantum unit is the photon. The range of applications of phonics extends from energy generation to detection to communication and information processing. Photonics is at the heart of today's communication systems, from the laser that generates the digital information transported along a fiber- optic cable to the detector that decodes the information. Whether the transmitted information is a phone call from across the street or across the globe, photonics brings it to you. Where your health is concerned, photonics allows physicians to do minimally invasive surgery using fiber-optic endoscopes and lasers. Researches using spectroscopy and microscopy are pushing the frontiers of biotechnology in activities as widespread as diagnosing disease and probing the mysteries of the genetic code. Advanced sensing and imaging techniques monitor the environment, gathering data on crops and forests, analyzing the ocean's currents and contents, and probing the atmosphere of pollutants. Transportation needs are being impacted by photonic sensors and laser rangefinders that will soon monitor and control the traffic on our nation's highways. In our factories, photonics provides machine vision systems that give a level of quality control human inspectors could never achieve. In manufacturing, lasers are replacing a variety of cutting, welding, and marking techniques, while imaging systems teamed with neural networks are producing intelligent robots. In short, photonics is paving our way into the new millennium. The skill standard is intended to define the knowledge and capabilities - the skills - that workers in the phonics industry need. Phonics will be one of the primary battlefields of the world economic conflict, and it is imperative that U.S. photonics technicians be skilled enough to allow the United States to remain competitive in a global marketplace.

The APS is relatively large (1104 m circumference) and, as such, an upgrade to a fourth-generation storage ring holds the potential for a two to three order of magnitude enhancement of X-ray brightness due to the approximate inverse cubic scaling of emittance with the number of dipole bend magnets.\n\nIMPEDANCE MEASUREMENT OF VACUUM CHAMBER COMPONENTS FOR THE ADVANCE PHOTON SOURCE (APS) UPGRADE\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSangroula, M.; Lindberg, R.; Lill, R.\n\n2017-06-16\n\nThe proposed Advance Photon Source Upgrade (APS-U) employs a multi-bend achromat (MBA) lattice to increase the photon brightness by two to three orders of magnitude.

At the same time, significant progress has been made in the development of energy-storage (ES) systems, which are essential components within the cycle of energy generation, transmission, and usage. Toward commercial applications, the enhancement of the performance and competitiveness of PV and ES systems requires the adoption of precise, but simple and low-cost manufacturing solutions, compatible with large-scale and high-throughput production lines. Photonic processes enable cost-efficient, noncontact, highly precise, and selective engineering of materials via photothermal, photochemical, or photophysical routes. Laser-based processes, in particular, provide access to a plethora of processing parameters that can be tuned with a remarkably high degree of precision to enable innovative processing routes that cannot be attained by conventional approaches. The focus here is on the application of advanced light-driven approaches for the fabrication, as well as the synthesis, of materials and components relevant to PV and ES systems. Besides presenting recent advances on recent achievements, the existing limitations are outlined and future possibilities and emerging prospects discussed. Â© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The development of photonic integrated circuits permits size, weight, power and cost reductions for spacecraft microprocessors, optical communication, processor buses, advanced data processing, and integrated optic science instrument optical systems, subsystems and components. This is particularly critical for small spacecraft platforms.

The model is based on Klyshko's advanced wave interpretation, but extends beyond it, providing a precise mathematical description of the advanced wave. The optical mode of the conditional photon is shown to be identical to the mode of the classical difference-frequency field generated due to nonlinear interaction of the partially coherent advanced wave with the pump pulse. With this \"nonlinear advanced wave model\" most coherence properties of the conditional photon become manifest, which permits one to intuitively understand many recent results, in particular, in quantum imaging.\n\nProgress on the Design of the Storage Ring Vacuum System for the Advanced Photon Source Upgrade Project\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nStillwell, B.; Billett, B.; Brajuskovic, B.\n\n2017-06-20\n\nRecent work on the design of the storage ring vacuum system for the Advanced Photon Source Upgrade project (APS-U) includes: revising the vacuum system design to accommodate a new lattice with reverse bend magnets, modifying the designs of vacuum chambers in the FODO sections for more intense incident synchrotron radiation power, modifying the design of rf-shielding bellows liners for better performance and reliability, modifying photon absorber designs to make better use of available space, and integrated planning of components needed in the injection, extraction and rf cavity straight sections.

However, with the advancement of technologies and the emergence of big data, simulation can be utilised to perform and support data analytics for associated performance gains. This requires not only significant model development expertise, but also huge data collection and analysis efforts. This paper presents an approach within the frameworks of Design Science Research Methodology and prototyping to address the challenge of increasing the use of modelling, simulation and data analytics in manufacturing via reduction of the development effort. The use of manufacturing simulation models is presented as data analytics applications themselves and for supporting other data analytics applications by serving as data generators and as a tool for validation. The virtual factory concept is presented as the vehicle for manufacturing modelling and simulation. Virtual factory goes beyond traditional simulation models of factories to include multi-resolution modelling capabilities and thus allowing analysis at varying levels of detail. A path is proposed for implementation of the virtual factory concept that builds on developments in technologies and standards. A virtual machine prototype is provided as a demonstration of the use of a virtual representation for manufacturing data analytics.\n\nEngineering propionibacteria as versatile cell factories for the production of industrially important chemicals: advances, challenges, and prospects.\n\nPubMed\n\nGuan, Ningzi; Zhuge, Xin; Li, Jianghua; Shin, Hyun-Dong; Wu, Jing; Shi, Zhongping; Liu, Long\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPropionibacteria are actinobacteria consisting of two principal groups: cutaneous and dairy. Cutaneous propionibacteria are considered primary pathogens to humans, whereas dairy propionibacteria are widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Increasing attention has been focused on improving the performance of dairy propionibacteria for the production of industrially important chemicals, and significant advances have been made through strain engineering and process optimization in the production of flavor compounds, nutraceuticals, and antimicrobial compounds. In addition, genome sequencing of several propionibacteria species has been completed, deepening understanding of the metabolic and physiological features of these organisms. However, the metabolic engineering of propionibacteria still faces several challenges owing to the lack of efficient genome manipulation tools and the existence of various types of strong restriction-modification systems. The emergence of systems and synthetic biology provides new opportunities to overcome these bottlenecks. In this review, we first introduce the major species of propionibacteria and their properties and provide an overview of their functions and applications. We then discuss advances in the genome sequencing and metabolic engineering of these bacteria. Finally, we discuss systems and synthetic biology approaches for engineering propionibacteria as efficient and robust cell factories for the production of industrially important chemicals.\n\nAdvances in integrated photonic circuits for packet-switched interconnection\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWilliams, Kevin A.; Stabile, Ripalta\n\n2014-03-01\n\nSustained increases in capacity and connectivity are needed to overcome congestion in a range of broadband communication network nodes. Packet routing and switching in the electronic domain are leading to unsustainable energy- and bandwidth-densities, motivating research into hybrid solutions: optical switching engines are introduced for massive-bandwidth data transport while the electronic domain is clocked at more modest GHz rates to manage routing. Commercially-deployed optical switching engines using MEMS technologies are unwieldy and too slow to reconfigure for future packet-based networking. Optoelectronic packet-compliant switch technologies have been demonstrated as laboratory prototypes, but they have so far mostly used discretely pigtailed components, which are impractical for control plane development and product assembly. Integrated photonics has long held the promise of reduced hardware complexity and may be the critical step towards packet-compliant optical switching engines. Recently a number of laboratories world-wide have prototyped optical switching circuits using monolithic integration technology with up to several hundreds of integrated optical components per chip. Our own work has focused on multi-input to multi-output switching matrices. Recently we have demonstrated 8Ã8Ã8Î» space and wavelength selective switches using gated cyclic routers and 16Ã16 broadband switching chips using monolithic multi-stage networks. We now operate these advanced circuits with custom control planes implemented with FPGAs to explore real time packet routing in multi-wavelength, multi-port test-beds. We review our contributions in the context of state of the art photonic integrated circuit technology and packet optical switching hardware demonstrations.\n\nProfessional development in photonics: the advanced technology education projects of the New England Board of Education\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDonnelly, Judith; Hanes, Fenna; Massa, Nicholas\n\n2007-09-01\n\nSince 1995, the New England Board of Education (NEBHE) has been providing curriculum and professional development as well as laboratory improvement in optics/photonics to middle school and high school teachers and college faculty across the United States. With funding from the National Science Foundation's Advanced Technology Education program, NEBHE's optics/photonics education projects have created a national network of educational and industry alliances resulting in opportunities in optics and photonics for students at participating schools and colleges. The cornerstone of NEBHE projects is collaboration among educational levels, career counselors and teachers/faculty, and industry and academia. In such a rich atmosphere of cooperation, participants have been encouraged to create their own regional projects and activities involving students from middle school through four-year universities. In this paper we will describe the evolution of teacher/faculty professional development from a traditional week-long summer workshop to a collaborative distance learning laboratory course based on adult learning principles and supported by a national network of industry mentors.\n\nFrontiers of X-ray research at the Advanced Photon Source\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDehmer, J.J.\n\n1995-12-31\n\nWith providential timing, the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory has begun to produce x-rays during the centennial year of Wilhelm Rongtgen`s discovery of a {open_quotes}new kind of rays.{close_quotes} When complete, this third-generation, 7-GeV positron storage ring will produce nearly one hundred intense x-ray beams, with a major emphasis on the laser-like (highly collimated, locally coherent) beams from undulator sources.

In recent years, this progress has resulted in developing advanced, complex, multifunctional and relatively cheap Photonic Integrated Circuits (PIC) or Hybrid Photonics Circuits (HPC) built of a collection of standardized optical, optoelectronic and photonic components. This idea is similar to the technology of Electronic Integrated Circuits, which has revolutionized the microelectronic market. The novel approach to photonic technology is now revolutionizing the photonics' market. It simplifies the photonics technology and enables creation of technological centers for designing, development and production of advanced optical and photonic systems in the EU and other countries.

Major advances in optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging are likely to occur through a quantum field approach to the technology. In this paper, which is the first part in a series on the topic, the quantum basis of OCT first order correlations is expressed in terms of full field quantization. Specifically first order correlations are treated as the linear sum of single photon interferences along indistinguishable paths. Photons and the electromagnetic (EM) field are described in terms of quantum harmonic oscillators. While the author feels the study of quantum second order correlations will lead to greater paradigm shifts in the field, addressed in part II, advances from the study of quantum first order correlations are given. In particular, ranging errors are discussed (with remedies) from vacuum fluctuations through the detector port, photon counting errors, and position probability amplitude uncertainty. In addition, the principles of quantum field theory and first order correlations are needed for studying second order correlations in part II.

A.\n\n1998-06-18\n\nOrbit correction is now routinely performed at the few-micron level in the Advanced Photon Source (APS) storage ring. Three diagnostics are presently in use to measure and control both AC and DC orbit motions: broad-band turn-by-turn rf beam position monitors (BPMs), narrow-band switched heterodyne receivers, and photoemission-style x-ray beam position monitors. Each type of diagnostic has its own set of systematic error effects that place limits on the ultimate pointing stability of x-ray beams supplied to users at the APS. Limiting sources of beam motion at present are magnet power supply noise, girder vibration, and thermal timescale vacuum chamber andmoreÂ Â» girder motion. This paper will investigate the present limitations on orbit correction, and will delve into the upgrades necessary to achieve true sub-micron beam stability.Â«Â less\n\nRecent advances in organic one-dimensional composite materials: design, construction, and photonic elements for information processing.\n\nPubMed\n\nYan, Yongli; Zhang, Chuang; Yao, Jiannian; Zhao, Yong Sheng\n\n2013-07-19\n\nMany recent activities in the use of one-dimensional nanostructures as photonic elements for optical information processing are explained by huge advantages that photonic circuits possess over traditional silicon-based electronic ones in bandwidth, heat dissipation, and resistance to electromagnetic wave interference. Organic materials are a promising candidate to support these optical-related applications, as they combine the properties of plastics with broad spectral tunability, high optical cross-section, easy fabrication, as well as low cost. Their outstanding compatibility allows organic composite structures which are made of two or more kinds of materials combined together, showing great superiority to single-component materials due to the introduced interactions among multiple constituents, such as energy transfer, electron transfer, exciton coupling, etc. The easy processability of organic 1D crystalline heterostructures enables a fine topological control of both composition and geometry, which offsets the intrinsic deficiencies of individual material. At the same time, the strong exciton-photon coupling and exciton-exciton interaction impart the excellent confinement of photons in organic microstructures, thus light can be manipulated according to our intention to realize specific functions. These collective properties indicate a potential utility of organic heterogeneous material for miniaturized photonic circuitry. Herein, focus is given on recent advances of 1D organic crystalline heterostructures, with special emphasis on the novel design, controllable construction, diverse performance, as well as wide applications in isolated photonic elements for integration. It is proposed that the highly coupled, hybrid optical networks would be an important material basis towards the creation of on-chip optical information processing.

To suppress the geometric and chromatic optics aberrations introduced by the strong sextupoles, achromat and quasi achromat schemes are applied in the lattice design to improve the beam dynamics performance. In this paper, some preliminary experimental investigation of the quasi achromat scheme at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) are presented. Three different operation lattices are compared on their beam dynamics performance. Although none of these operation lattices achieve ideal quasi achromat condition, they have certain relevant features. It is observed that fewer resonances aremoreÂ Â» present in the nominal operation lattice which is most close to quasi achromat required conditions.Â«Â less\n\nEndoplasmic Reticulum-Localized Two-Photon-Absorbing Boron Dipyrromethenes as Advanced Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhou, Yimin; Cheung, Ying-Kit; Ma, Chao; Zhao, Shirui; Gao, Di; Lo, Pui-Chi; Fong, Wing-Ping; Wong, Kam Sing; Ng, Dennis K P\n\n2018-05-10\n\nTwo advanced boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) based photosensitizers have been synthesized and characterized. With a glibenclamide analogous moiety, these compounds can localize in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells and HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma cells. The BODIPY Ï skeleton is conjugated with two styryl or carbazolylethenyl groups, which can substantially red-shift the Q-band absorption and fluorescence emission and impart two-photon absorption (TPA) property to the chromophores. The TPA cross section of the carbazole-containing analogue reaches a value of 453 GM at 1010 nm. These compounds also behave as singlet oxygen generators with high photostability. Upon irradiation at Î» > 610 nm, these photosensitizers cause photocytotoxicity to these two cell lines with IC 50 values down to 0.09 Î¼M, for which the cell death is triggered mainly by ER stress. The two-photon photodynamic activity of the distyryl derivative upon excitation at Î» = 800 nm has also been demonstrated.\n\nA factory concept for processing and manufacturing with lunar material\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDriggers, G.

By changing the reflectivity of the Sagnac loop reflectors (SLRs) and the phase shifts along the connecting waveguides, we tailor mode splitting in the CSLR resonators to achieve a wide range of filter shapes for diverse applications including enhanced light trapping, flat-top filtering, Q factor enhancement, and signal reshaping. We present the theoretical designs and compare the CSLR resonators with three, four, and eight SLRs fabricated in SOI.

This, combined with the short beam lifetime, will make injector reliability even more important than it is for top-up operation. We used historical data for the APS injector complex to obtain probability distributions for injector up-time and down-time durations. Using these distributions, we simulated several years of swap-out operation for the upgraded lattice for several operatingmodes. The results indicate thatmoreÂ Â» obtaining very high availability of beam in the storage ring will require improvements to injector reliability.Â«Â less\n\nA 2 m inelastic x-ray scattering spectrometer at CMC-XOR, Advanced Photon Source.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHill, J.
