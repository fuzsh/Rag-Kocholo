Since the previous studies using the chiral unitary model suggest that $\\Lambda(1405)$ may be explained by two poles in the octet and the singlet channels of the flavor SU(3), we calculate the HAL QCD potentials for the meson-baryon systems in...\n\nSearching for the dark matter is one of the major goals of contemporary astronomy and particle physics.
