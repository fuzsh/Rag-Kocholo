        "text": "Abstract\n\nCell-matrix adhesion is a central mechanical function to a large number of phenomena in physiology and disease, including morphogenesis, wound healing and tumor cell invasion. Today, how single cells responds to different extracellular cues has been comprehensibly studied. However, how the mechanical behavior of the main individual molecules that form an adhesion complex cooperatively respond to force within the adhesion complex has not been addressed. This is a key aspect in cell adhesion because how these cell adhesion molecules respond to force determines not only cell-matrix behavior but, ultimately, cell function. To answer this question, we develop a multi-scale computational model for adhesion complexes mechanics. Based on the classical clutch hypothesis, we model individual adhesion chains made of a contractile actin network, a talin rod and an integrin molecule that binds at individual adhesion sites on the extracellular matrix. We explore several scenarios of integrins dynamics and analyze the effects of diverse extracellular matrices on the behavior of the adhesion molecules and on the whole adhesion complex. Our results explains how every single component of the adhesion chain mechanically responds to the contractile actomyosin force and show how they control the tractions forces exerted by the cell on the extracellular space. Importantly, our computational results are in agreement with previous experimental data both at the molecular and cell level. Our multi-scale clutch model presents a step forward not only to further understand adhesion complexes mechanics but also to, e.g., engineer better biomimetic materials, repair biological tissues or arrest invasive tumor migration.\n\nAuthor summary Cell-matrix adhesions are directly implicated in key biological processes such as tissue development, regeneration and tumor cell invasion. These cell functions are determined by how adhesion complexes feel and respond to mechanical forces. Still, how forces are transmitted through the individual cell adhesion molecules that integrate the adhesion complex is poorly understood. To address this issue, we develop a multi-scale clutch model for adhesion complexes where individual adhesion chains, made of integrin and talin molecules, are considered within classical clutch models. This approach provides a rich mechanosensivity insight of how the mechanics of cell adhesion works. It allows to integrate accurate biophysical models of individual adhesion molecules into whole adhesion complex models. Our multi-scale clutch approach allows to extend our current knowledge of adhesion complexes for physiology and disease, e.g., the regeneration of biological tissues or arrest invasive tumor migration, and for engineering better biomimetic materials.\n\nIntroduction\n\nCell adhesions are central to maintain the right function of the cell [1]. Specifically, integrin-based cell adhesions are responsible for the attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix [2, 3] and are crucial for single and collective cell motility in development and disease [4]. We focus here on integrin-based cell adhesions, and we refer to this type of adhesion complexes (ACs) when we next talk about cell adhesion. ACs are made of an assembling of Cell Adhesion Molecules (CAMs) [5] linked together to establish a rich mechanosensitive and mechanotransductive system that regulates cell adhesion and function [6, 7]. Moreover, ACs grow and respond differently to a number of factors, including the rigidity of the Extracellular Matrix (ECM) [8, 9] and the contractile forces exerted by acto-myosin networks [10]. Today, our knowledge of how ACs respond to these factors is extensive thanks to mounting experimental evidences. In the remaining introductory section, we review the organization of the ACs and their regulation by the ECM.\n\nForce distribution and architecture in integrin-based cell adhesions\n\nAt the nanoscale, ACs are made of ECM ligands, transmembrane and cytoplasmatic proteins and a network of actin filaments and myosin motors (see Fig. 1). The hierarchical composition of the AC was analyzed by measuring the kinematics of each molecule by fluorescence speckle microscopy [11]. Integrins are weakly correlated with the actin flow, indicating that they should be attached to the immobilized ECM. On the other hand, α-actinin is fully correlated with the actomyosin network, suggesting that it is fully interconnected within the acto-myosin network. Vinculin and talin show a partial coupling to the actin flow, which indicates that these components connect the acto-myosin structures to the immobile extracellular binding sites. The relation of these components with the actomyosin flow suggested a stratified organization of the main adhesion molecules (Fig. 1). Three-dimensional super-resolution fluorescence microscopy confirmed this organization of CAMs and provided a more precise description of the nanoscale architecture of the AC [5]. They showed that integrins and actin are separated vertically ≈ 40 nm by a first signaling layer consisting of the integrin cytoplasmatic tails, a second layer of talin and vinculin, oriented at 15° with respect to the plasma membrane [12], and an actin regulatory layer containing zyxin and α-actinin, among others, that connects talin with the actin network. Therefore, these adhesion molecules lays mostly parallel to the cell-ECM contact plane. The link between integrins, talin, vinculin and the actomyosin network is probably the most determining connection of CAMs for cell-ECM adhesion [7].\n\nIn the inner cellular layer, the actomyosin network is made of a template of 10 to 30 actomyosin filaments, linked periodically through α-actinin and non-muscle myosin motors that fuse to finally form contractile stress fibers [13, 7, 14, 15]. Myosin motors generate a pulling force that has been implicated in the maturation [16, 7, 16], stability [10, 17] and disassembling [7, 16] of ACs. The force exerted by the myosin motors causes conformational changes in the main CAMs, such as talin and vinculin. Although it is now clear that myosin II plays a key role in the active force generation in cell adhesions [10, 18], how it controls the adhesion dynamics is not completely understood.\n\nThe second signaling layer is made of talin and vinculin. Talin is recruited from the cytosol to the adhesion site [19] and binds to the intracellular domain of integrins, the β-integrin unit, from one side, and to the actin cytoskeleton [20, 21] from its most-inner domain. The force exerted by the actomyosin fibers induces talin deformation and conformational changes [22, 23, 24] (more details on the talin structure and mechanics are discussed in Section). Upon unfolding of the talin rod domains, vinculin binds to the exposed talin domains through Vinculin Binding Sites (VBSs) [25]. The binding rates of vinculin to talin increases upon stretching of the talin rod [23, 24].\n\nIn the outer molecular layer, transmembrane integrin molecules connect the cell to the ECM [26, 3], via laminin, fibronectin or collagen. Integrins diffuse freely within the nascent adhesion. Because the cytoplasmic domains of integrins cannot directly bind to actin, integrins use talin and kidlin as intermediates elements to connect to the actin filaments. Then, upon force-induced activation [19], integrins cluster in the adhesion complex and the diffusivity of the integrins outside the adhesion reduces, which, eventually, leads to the formation of stable ACs [27]. Integrins switch from a low affinity state, where they appear bent and closed, to a high affinity state [28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. Low affinity integrins are activated by their attachment to talin, when they switch to an extended and closed, high affinity state. Integrin activation fosters the binding of integrins with the ECM [33], mediated by talin [34, 35] and vinculin signaling [36]. Once the whole adhesion chain is formed and the force in the chain increases, integrins change again their structure passing to an extended and open state.\n\nForce transmission through all these CAMs is central to the cell adhesion behavior. Force estimations at single integrins have been reported in ≈2-100 pN [30, 3]. Most of these measures were obtained by averaging across the entire adhesion plaque, which only provides an estimation of the actual forces experienced by single integrins. For example, a force value of 1-2 pN at individual integrins was calculated in adhered fibroblasts by estimating the number of bound integrins per unit area [37]. Similarly, a force of ≈10 pN was obtained from traction forces of ≈1 kPa in ≈ 500 integrins / μm2 [9]. FRET-based molecular sensors pinpointed the single integrin force in 1-5 pN [38, 39]. DNA-based sensors established a force range of 33-43 pN [29] in αvβ3 integrins, one of the most ubiquitous integrin across cell types. A detailed analysis of the lifetime of the αvβ3-fibronectin bond showed a maximum lifetime of the bond at 30 pN, vanishing above ≈60 pN [40]. Measures of the force sensed by talin [41] was pinpointed to 7-10 pN and the limit force when all domains are completely unfolded is 30 pN [24].\n\nAll these data suggest a narrow mechano-sensing force of few pN across the adhesion chains. Moreover, because the talin-integrin stoichiometry is approximately 1:1 in ACs [5, 42], an integrin and a talin connected in series and stretched from one end share the same force. In this situation, a 30 pN force would unfold all domains of the talin rod [24], and extreme case of the talin state, while the lifetime of the integrin-fibronectin catch bonds would be maximum and, therefore, force could still increase across the molecular chain. Whether this is a realistic, regular scenario in AC behaviour has not been yet shown experimentally.\n\nIn summary, there are differences in the force magnitudes measured on these molecules. Whether these differences are real and biologically designed for a right adhesion behavior, which is not consistent with the connection in series of these molecules, or they are discrepancies due to measuring errors, it is not clear.\n\nThe extracellular matrix architecture as a regulator of cell adhesion\n\nThe stiffness of the ECM and the spacing of the specific binding sites represent the most determining factors of the ECM for the cell adhesion behavior. The ECM rigidity directly determines the force transmission from the active contraction generated by the acto-myosin network through the CAMs. The behavior of cell adhesion as a function of the substrate rigidity was described by the motor-clutch hypothesis [43, 44, 45, 46]. When integrins bind to rigid substrates, myosin contractility builds force very quickly in each molecular chain and the CAMs must accommodate the imposed displacements. Unbinding rates become faster than binding rates, which limits force transmission to stiff substrates, and the AC completely disengage before other ligands have time to bind. This behavior has been termed ‘‘frictional slippage” [43, 46]. On the other hand, soft substrates deform substantially upon force application, which induce a low force transmission to the CAMs and a cooperative engagement of many bonds along time. As ligands keep binding, myosin contractility deforms the substrate, increasing the force transmission to the substrate, until the bonds reach the limit rupture force. At that point, the AC disassembles, and the cycle starts over. This behavior was previously termed “load-and-fail” dynamics [43, 46].\n\nThe AC behavior also depends on the adhesion-site patterning [9, 47]. The ECM is made of proteins, such as fibronectins and laminins, that serve as binding sites for cells to attach. In low ligand spacing and stiff substrates, the maturation of ACs is highly impaired, while in soft substrates ACs consistently mature into long-lived focal adhesions. However, when ligands are put apart by more than few hundreds of nanometers, focal complexes formation is impaired in both soft and stiff substrates [48, 47], probably due to a restriction in integrin clustering, suggesting an adaptor ruler of the order of nanometers that could control cell adhesion maturation. It has also been suggested that the local number and spacing, and not the global density or distribution of ligands, are sufficient to induce adhesion mechanisms [49].\n\nFurther research on the cooperative response of ligand spacing and the ECM rigidities in cell adhesion showed contra-intuitive results [50]. On soft substrates, only small nascent adhesions formed for ligand spacing of 50 nm and 100 nm. For these spacing, AC formation was observed only for substrate rigidities above 5 kPa and below 100 kPa, although it was not seen in glass. For 200 nm spacing, AC were observed to form below substrates of 5 kPa. Although most of these results could be described through a ruler mechanism, the formation of ACs for a spacing larger than 200 nm on substrates of ≈ 1 kPa, could not be explained by that hyposthesis.\n\nIn short, it is clear that the spacing of ligands and the rigidity of the ECM determine cell behavior. However, how specifically the cooperative mechanical response of the CAMs to these ECM aspects maps to the whole adhesion complex behavior is still not well understood.\n\nModels for cell adhesion and goal of this work\n\nDifferent physical models have been proposed in literature to assist current experimental studies for the rationalization of cell adhesion. Continuum models have been used to describe clustering and growth of ACs [51, 52, 53, 54, 55], and the role of the ECM [56] and of cell contractibility [53, 54] in adhesion mechanics. Discrete models have been also used to model cell-ECM mechanics [57, 58, 59]. By corse-grained models, it was also shown that the morphology and distribution of nascent adhesions depend on the nanoscale ligand affinity of β-1 and β-2 integrins [60]. Other approaches use repeated random sampling simulations, mostly through Monte Carlo (MC) and Gillespie methods, to model the dynamics of cell adhesion [61, 62, 63]. In this framework, the Molecular Clutch model [43, 8, 9] describes the specific binding/unbinding events of individual molecular chains, or clutches, and provides a simple but insightful explanation of cell adhesion mechanics as a function of the substrate rigidity. The clutch models relates the velocity of the retrograde flow of the cell, generated by the pulling forces of myosin motors, with the mechanical properties of the ECM and the clutches dynamics. It was first developed to reproduce the “load and fail” of adhesion in the growth cone of a neuron [43, 9]. The model has been further exploited since then, providing remarkable insights and qualitative understanding of how cell adhesions form, function and modify the whole cell mechanics [8, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68].\n\nAlthough previous models have explained many experimental observations and have rationalized different aspects of how cell adhesion works mechanically, many fundamental questions remain unsolved. One single AC is an intricate and dynamic compound of molecules, as we summarized above. However, current physical models simplify the actual internal organization of the ACs, which hinders important questions in cell adhesion mechanics. For example, how are the contractile forces transmitted to a single molecular chain? How is the mechanosensing process at individual CAMs during cell adhesion? How do individual molecular chains within the AC behave in different substrate stiffnesses? In this study, we derive a computational multi-scale clutch model to understand how the CAMs that populate an AC behaves during the adhesion process and how they regulate the behavior of the whole AC. In the following sections, we summarize the main features, results and limitations of current clutch models.\n\nReview of previous molecular clutch models\n\nThe clutch model integrates the mechanical response of the substrate and the clutches, that represent the molecular chains, under the contractile pulling of an actomyosin network. Each chain can bind with constant rate and unbind as force builds up on them. This binding and unbinding process is associated with the attachment and disattachment of integrins with the ECM. The solution of the clutch model relies on a repeated random sampling, which is usually solved by Monte Carlo or Gillespie methods. The model computes five main variables involved in cell adhesion behavior [43, 46]: the probability of the clutches of being bound, Pb, the substrate displacement, xsub, the clutch displacement, xc, the averaged forces in the clutches, Fc, and the actin network velocity, v. A detailed description of the model is presented in the Methods section.\n\nWe first analyze cell adhsion in terms of previous clutch models. We consider ACs crowded with integrins expressing either slip [43] or catch [8] bonds, which we refer to as slip and catch cases from now on. In what follows, and unless specified otherwise, we take model parameters for the on/off rates of slip and catch bonds from literature (see Methods, Table 2). We take values of a slip bond (see Eq. 4) that reproduced experimental data of chick forebrain neurons [43]. To reproduce cells crowded with catch bonds (see Eq. 5), we use model parameters that reproduced the lifetime of α5β1 integrins at its maximum activation state in presence of Mn2+ ions [40]. The results for the slip and catch cases are in Fig. A1. Our simulations reproduce previous results [43, 8, 46].\n\nTo better understand the model behavior, we analyze the time evolution of all model variables (see Figs. A4 and A5 for details). We specifically focus on the lifetime of each adhesion cycle, that is the average time from the formation of the AC until its complete disengagement. The lifetime of the AC of both slip and catch cases decreases as the stiffness of the substrate increases. In the slip case, the average length of the cycle for E = 1 kPa is 7.27 s and for E =10 kPa is 0.215 s. In the catch case, for E =1 kPa it is 4.25 s and for E =10 kPa it is 0.344 s.\n\nWe also review recent developments that have extended the original clutch model introducing the effect of talin and vinculin reinforcement [8, 71] (see Fig. A2 for details). Talin unfolding is a mechanosensing event triggered by force that exposes one VBS, where vinculin binds at a force-independent rate konv. The unfolding rate of talin, , responds to force according to Bell’s model as a slip bond. Talin refolding also depends on force [8]. If talin unfolds, it can either refold again or vinculin can binds to it, increasing integrin density by intadd = 24 integrins/μm2. The binding rate of integrins follows kon = kontdint, where kont is the true binding rate characterizing each integrin-fibronectin bond, and dint is the density of integrins in the AC. If the clutch unbinds before a vinculin binds to talin, integrin density is decreased by intadd, reflecting the fact that adhesions lose integrins if force application is decreased [72, 73]. In the model, integrin density is never allowed to go below the initial value nor above a maximum integrin density, mr = 15×103 integrins/μm2, as there is a limiting density of integrins, or separation between integrins, in the AC (see Fig. A10 for further details). Again, our results reproduce previous experimental and theoretical results [71, 8].\n\nLimitations in current clutch models for cell adhesion\n\nThe molecular clutch model successfully reproduces the adhesion behavior at the cell-scale, specifically the cell traction P and the actin velocity v, for different cell types (see e.g. [43, 8, 71, 46]). Therefore, it represents an excellent option when we aim at studying the behaviour of an entire cell. However, some parameters and variables of the model contradict previous experimental data. Most probably, this is due to a number of simplifications introduced in the modeling of the adhesion structure.\n\nThe first simplification is in the modeling of the substrate. The clutch models consider a single linear spring for the substrate, which naturally results in one single quantity for the substrate displacement. Considering a substrate with nano-patterned attaching locations where integrins adhere to, the displacement of the substrate should change point-wise, depending on the locations of the ligands. This issue has been tackled by including a number of spring elements to represent the ECM [50]. Previous clutch models have simplified the behavior of the chain of CAMs to a linear spring. Integrin and talin, which are key components of the AC [82, 11], are not directly incorporated but have a distinctive mechanical response [24, 3] that contribute significantly to the behavior of the AC. For example, the talin rod undergoes folding and refolding dynamics of all its domains and, moreover, each domain shows a non-linear force-displacement response to load [24].\n\nTo better assess the predictions at the molecular scale, we analyzed the deformation of each clutch and compare it to the actual behavior of individual CAMs. Integrins in their bent and closed configuration have a length of ≈ 11 — 13nm [32, 74], called low affinity state. Upon activation, they pass to an extended and open configuration, the high affinity state, with a length of 18 — 23nm [75, 12, 74], from which they can bind and create focal adhesions. α5β1 integrins can reach a total length of 50 nm, therefore integrins displacement can reach ≈ 30 nm. Similarly, the talin rod is ≈ 60 —80nm in length [76, 77, 12] in its open, fully folded state and its end-to-end length when fully unfolded under force reaches ≈ 800 nm [24]. This gives a total displacement up to ≈ 730 nm. In the model results, the displacement of the molecular chain has maximum value of ≈ 2 nm (Fig. A2). This displacement is two orders of magnitude smaller than the possible displacements of the integrin and talin molecules.\n\nIf the results of the deformations are not well reproduced, one may think that forces at individual molecular clutches could also be poorly reproduced. As we discussed in the introduction, forces have been measured in individual integrins (0 — 40 pN) and talins (0 — 30pN). To analyze the force at each clutch, we plot the mean value and standard deviation as a function of the stiffness of the substrate and the number of ligands nc for the reinforced case (see Fig. 2). If we neglect the peaks at the end of the cycles, which go up to an unphysical value of ≈ 1500 pN, we see that the forces remain similar for all three values of the substrate rigidity, up to ≈ 60 pN (Fig. 2 and Fig. A2). Although these values are closer to those reported at the individual molecular level, a force of 60 pN would completely unfold all talin domains, which represent an extreme case of the talin behavior.\n\nThe results of the lifetime of the AC are also shorter than in previous experimental data. The longest AC lifetime that we obtain is 6.52 s, found for the softest substrate However, previous experimental data show that the time after which the adhesion cluster becomes completely free, the AC lifetime, is ≈ 1 hour [79]. We also observe that the maximum vinculin/talin ratio is 2.5/30 = 0.083. Previous experimental results show vinculin/talin ratios of 1.4 [80] and 2.2 [81]. Perhaps, this is because there are more than one vinculin binding site on the talin rod, which has not been considered in the model.\n\nWe hypothesize that an improvement in the molecular characterization within the clutch models could describe more accurately the mechanics of cell adhesion and overcome the limitations and inconsistencies discussed above.\n\nResults\n\nThe main goal of this work is to develop a detailed model of the AC mechanics that may allow us to overcome the limitations discussed above and to further study the mechanosensing mechanisms triggered by the CAMs. To do so, we model a number of molecular chains made of a talin protein attached on top to an actomyosin network and on the bottom to an integrin molecule. We take a previous model of the talin mechanics that considers the conformational changes and non-linear deformation of each domain [24]. Moreover, each integrin molecule links extracellularly to the ECM. Using Green’s functions [83], we compute the deformation of the substrate around each ligand position. Then, we bundle together these individual molecular chains to form an AC (see Fig. 3).\n\nAlthough we follow the same clutch hypothesis described in previous section, we reinterpret the model. By bundling a number of molecular chains, the new multi-scale clutch model describes the dynamics of a single AC. The macroscopic variables of the model, such as P and v, represent now the traction under the AC and the velocity of the actomyosin network pulling on the AC. The model is detailed in the Methods section.\n\nRole of the ECM rigidity on an adhesion chain\n\nTo analyze the model behavior and the effect of the talin mechanics in the adhesion behavior, we first model a single adhesion chain where talin attaches to a substrate of various rigidities from one side and remains bound at any time step. We don’t include the integrin molecule between the ECM and talin. On the other end, talin links to an actin filament, that is also bound to nm myosin motors which are anchored to a fixed surface and generate a contractile force on the actin filament (see Fig. 3).\n\nWe run the model through the Gillespie algorithm using as final time tf = 8 s, which allows for the complete unfolding of the talin domains. We study the same range of substrate rigidities as in previous sections, E= 0.1-100 kPa. It is important to note that all model parameters are now based on the individual behavior of each CAM.\n\nWe plot the main model variables while varying the Young’s modulus of the substrate (Fig. 4). As we do not allow the chain to disengage, the displacement of the substrate xsub decreases while increasing the Young’s modulus of the substrate. xsub is the average over all ligand positions and, therefore, it depends on the displacement at each binder and the total number of bound binders. We do this to obtain substrate displacements comparable to experimental data, which are the average displacement over a certain region of analysis. The resisting force that myosin motors experience also reduces the velocity of the actin filament and, consequently, its total displacement with the increasing rigidity. As the rigidity of the ECM increases, the total displacement imposed in the chain is absorbed by the talin. Therefore, the elongation of talin rod, xtalin, varies from approximately its resting length in the softest substrates (E=0.1 kPa) to ≈350 nm in the stiffest (E=100 kPa). The force on the chain increases from zero to approximately 20 pN in the stiffest substrates. Consequently, the traction in the ECM also increases with the ECM stiffness. Importantly, we show forces and displacements of chain components in agreement with previous data (see again the discussion on the clutch models limitations above).\n\nTalin not only elongates but it also unfolds and refolds during time. At every unfolding event, the length of the talin rod further elongates. We found that, on average, most domains are folded for soft substrates (<10kPa). The unfolding events are mostly triggered starting from a substrate rigidity of ≈ 20 kPa. As we move toward stiff substrates (>30 kPa), the force increases and the domains unfold progressively (Fig. 4), being the R3 domain the most likely one to unfold, followed by the R5, R6, R10 and R11.\n\nRole of the ECM rigidity in α5β1 and αvβ3-crowded focal adhesions\n\nNext, we use our multi-scale clutch model to understand how ACs behave. We focus on ACs crowded with either α5β1 or αvβ3 integrins, among the most ubiquitous types of integrins.\n\nTo define the parameters of the integrin dynamics, we look into experimental values for integrin αIIbβ3 [88] and assume that α5β1 and αvβ3 behave similarly in terms of binding rates. Specifically, we take kont=0.005 μ2m s-1 and kont = 1 × 10-4μ2m s-1 for α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins, respectively. Because α5β1 integrins undergoes CMR, we increase its lifetime to reflect the fact that integrins that have been subjected to loading and unloading cycles have a longer lifetime [69]. We do not consider CMR for αvβ3 because, as far as we know, it has not been demonstrated for this type of integrins. The lifetime curves together with the experimental data for α5β1 [40] and αvβ3 integrins [8] are shown in Fig. 5.\n\nFor the Young’s modulus of the substrate, we take again the range E = 0.1 - 100 kPa. For the radius of the FA, we take a fixed value of a = 708 nm [50] with equispaced ligands at a distance of d = 100 nm. The number of equispaced ligands nc is then computed given the radius of the circular AC and the distance d, and we get nc = 158 binders (see Fig. A10). For the stiffness of the linear spring that models the integrin, we take κc = 10pN/nm [40, 69]. For the initial density of integrins, we choose [71, 8]. The stall force of a single myosin motor is Fm = 2pN [89] and we take a number of myosin motors equal to the number of ligands, following previous models [71, 43]. As for the unloaded actin velocity vu, we choose vu = 110 nm/s, similar to velocities measured in previous experimental data [90, 91, 92]. We summarize all values for the model parameters in Table 1.\n\nWe show the response of the ACs crowded with α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins as a function of the substrate rigidity in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, respectively. The cell traction increases with the ECM stiffness, reaching a maximum of ≈ 115 Pa and ≈ 100 Pa for cells crowded with αvβ3 and α5β1 integrins, respectively, at E =10 kPa and remain constant above 10 kPa. The velocity decreases with the increase of the substrate rigidity because of the opposing force to the actin network movement. The minimum velocity, which is again approximately constant above 10 kPa, is ≈ 60 nm/s and ≈ 50 nm/s for the αvβ3 and the α5β1 adhesions, respectively. These traction and velocity values are in agreement with previous clutch models and experimental results [71, 8] (see also previous discussion in Section).\n\nThe percentage of bound binders increases as the stiffness of the substrate increases, reaching maximum values of 49% and 16% for the α5β1 and αVβ3 cases, respectively, at E =100 kPa. The lower percentage for the αVβ3 case is due to the lower binding rate of this integrin, although its lifetime is larger than α5β1 integrins. The maximum force reached at the bound binders, Fc,max, increases from 10-12 pN at 0.1 kPa to 20 pN at 1 kPa in both types of integrins, and remains until 100 kPa. This is in agreement with force values reported at single talin and integrin molecules [24, 40, 69]. The average force over bound binders follows the same increase, with a plateau of ≈ 6.5 pN and ≈ 2pN for the αVβ3 and the α5β1 cases, respectively, between 10 kPa and 100 kPa. The difference between the two cases is due to the larger lifetime at low forces (<20 pN) and binding rates for αVβ3 integrins. The displacement of the ECM decreases as its stiffness increases. The displacement induced by the myosin motors in the molecular chains is mostly absorbed by soft substrates, while integrin and talin molecules absorb the displacement imposed when the substrate increases above the stiffness of these molecules. The maximum displacement of both integrins is ≈ 2nm, which is in the order of magnitude of previous experimental results [40, 69]. Again, the average integrin displacement is higher (≈ 0.2nm) for αVβ3, aligned with the larger average force. Similarly to other model variables, the displacement of talin increases until substrates of ≈ 10 kPa, and then it remains constant up to the stiffest substrates at ≈ 400 nm and ≈ 440nm for the α5β1 and the αVβ3 cases, respectively. These results are also in close agreement with previous experimental data of the force-displacement relation in the talin rod [24]. Partially, this difference in the talin rod elongation is due to a higher number of unfolded domains in the αVβ3 case. Furthermore, the probability of finding a bound binder with a vinculin molecule attached is higher in the αVβ3 case because there are more unfolded R3 domains, where vinculin attaches to. Strikingly, the overall number of vinculin molecules in the AC is larger in the α5β1 case (18) because the number of bound binders is larger. We also see a contraintuitive response in the density of integrins that, as we explained in the introduction, increases according to the increase in vinculin attachments. We show that the integrin density does not change in the α5β1 while it increases 2.5-fold in the αVβ3 case, even though both ACs have a similar increase in vinculin activity. This is because when a binder becomes free, the integrin density increases by intadd if a vinculin is bound to that binder and decreases by intadd if vinculin is not bound. Because αvβ3 integrins have a larger lifetime for forces below ≈ 20 pN, most molecular chains do not unbind before the final time tf and there is not a reduction in integrin density. Therefore, there is not an even correspondence between the value of dintnorm and the total number of vinculins bound for both integrins.\n\nIn summary, our results for the tractions and actin flow velocity, which represents the macroscopic variables of the model, are similar to the reinforced case shown in Fig. A2. These are important results because previous clutch models closely reproduce and predict experimental data of these quantities. However, our results also show a close agreement with results of forces and displacements at individual talin and integrin molecules during cell adhesion [24, 40, 69], which represents a clear step forward in the modeling and understanding of the mechanosensing of ACs. It is also worth to note that the two types of integrins analyzed, with two different lifetime landscapes, deliver similar cell tractions. These results indicate that although integrins behavior may change the dynamics of the AC and its mechanosensing response, the resulting cell tractions may not be altered.\n\nAdhesion dynamics in α5β1 and αVβ3-based adhesion complexes\n\nTo better understand the behavior of ACs crowded with α5β1 or αVβ3 integrins, we analyze the evolution of a single Gillespie simulation in time. We focus on a substrate rigidity of E = 2.5 kPa (see for results on different substrate rigidities). The model parameters are the same as in previous section.\n\nFor the α5β1 case, the adhesion enters a quasi-static phase in which the percentage of bound binders stabilizes to ≈ 50% after a short period of ≈ 3 s of transition from the initial free state (Fig. 8). At this quasi-static phase, the actin velocity decreases from the free 110nm/s to ≈ 50 nm/s and the traction at the adhesion patch increases up to ≈120 Pa. All other model variables that are averaged over the bound binders follow the same behavior (Fig. 8). The maximum force reached at a single binders is ≈ 15 pN and presents a peak of 50 pN after which the integrin attachment breaks. The maximum displacement of integrins is ≈ 6 nm. These results are again in agreement with previous data [40, 69]. In terms of the talin dynamics, we show a very rapid landscape of folding and unfolding events which occur every few ms (see Fig. 8 and SI). As we showed before, R3 is the domain with more unfolded domains, ≈ 40%, followed by R5, R6, R10 and R11, ≈ 20%. We also see a maximum talin displacement of ≈ 600nm, which represents a value close to talin fully unfolded contour length.\n\nThe results for the αvβ3 case have a similar behavior but present some differences. First, the initial transition phase between the free state and the quasi-static state is ≈15s and clutches reach a Pb ≈ 0.16. This is because the larger bonds lifetime cannot compensate the lower binding rates. The velocity and traction at the quasi-static phase reach ≈ 40 nm/s and ≈150 Pa, respectively. The maximum force and displacement present more peaks than in the α5β1 case. The peaks reach ≈40 pN and ≈4 nm, respectively, which are lower than in the α5β1 case and, again, in agreement with previous data [40, 69]. These differences are due to the larger lifetime of αVβ3 integrins below ≈ 20 pN, which explains the amount of peaks around that force value. The talin rod also shows a larger amount of unfolding events in all the talin domains. This is again because the lifetime of αvβ3 integrins for forces below ≈ 20 pN is larger than α5β1 integrins, which are force values at which most of the talin domains are unfolded. Indeed, we see again that the maximum displacement of talin increases up to ≈ 600 nm, close to the length of the fully unfolded state.\n\nAs we pointed out above, the mechanosensitivity of both ACs crowded with these integrins gives counterintuitive results. The α5β1 case has a larger amount of bound binders, which increases the available adhesion chains for vinculin binding. However, there is a limited number of unfolded talin domains. On the other hand, there are also approximately half of the molecular chains available for vinculin binding in the αVβ3 case, but there is a larger amount of unfolded domains in the talin rod, that fosters the large number of vinculin attachments. As a result, both cases present a similar increase in bound vinculins. However, as we discussed in the previous section, these increases do not follow a similar increase in integrin recruitment in both cases.\n\nIn short, our results show that an AC crowded with αVβ3 or α5β1 behaves very similarly in terms of the traction forces for different substrate stiffnesses. However, our results also suggest that ACs crowded with αVβ3 induce a richer mechanosensitivity response compared to α5β1 integrins in terms of adhesion reinforcement. The unfolding domains of the talin rod and their exposures to VBS further recruits more integrins into the AC, increasing the probability of bound chains. The integrin behavior plays a crucial role in the mechanotransduction of the AC because, when the unbinding rate becomes very fast, there is no time for the increase of force, for the unfolding of talin domains and, therefore, integrin recruitment is severely impaired. These differences may explain the role of different integrins in the mechanosensing of the cell [26].\n\nIntegrins behavior in AC dynamics\n\nBesides α5β3 and αVβ3 integrins, there are a number of integrins implicated in cell adhesion, e.g. α4β3, αIIbβ3, αVβ6 and αVβ8, with a diverse effect in the AC behavior [26]. Even for one specific integrin type, its behavior can change dramatically for different activation states, depending on the presence of different ions [40] or the level of CMR [69]. Consequently, its binding and unbinding rates can be altered. To further explore the effect of different integrin types in the AC behavior, we performed a series of simulations by simultaneously varying the integrin behavior and the substrate rigidity (Fig. 11). The range of parameters related to the integrins behavior and their effects in the lifetime of the bond are shown in Fig. 10. We take the same values of Section for the other model parameters. The effect of increasing the ECM stiffness for all integrins model parameters is an increase in the tractions forces, with the corresponding decrease in the retrograde flow (Fig. 11). Therefore, the effect of the parameters variations in the traction is similar to the previous clutch models and maintains the prediction capability of the clutch model. The increase in cell traction is accompanied by an increase in talin stretch and, therefore, in the number of unfolding events and in the number of vinculin molecules bound to the talin rod. However, as we also discussed above, this does not follow a substantial increase in integrin density.\n\nWe can gather the effects of integrins model parameters in two groups. An increase of Fb, koff,slip or koff,catch results in a decrease of the bound binders and force transmission, which reduces the cell traction. The decrease in the transmitted force is again followed by a reduction of talin stretch and vinculin attachments. This behaviour is more evident for variations of koff,catch. These results are expected as we are enhancing the rupture of the bond at low forces by increasing these three parameters. On the other hand, we see an opposite response when we increase kont, making the bonds to engage faster than the disengagement. Our results suggest that the on/off rates, which are indicative of different integrins and different activation states, results in very different AC behaviors.\n\nTo further analyze the effect of the integrins behavior in ACs, we perform a variation of Fb and koff,catch versus kont fixing the substrate stiffness to E=10kPa. Because variations of koff,slip have a small effect in the AC (Fig. 11), we leave it out of the analysis. The results are in agreement with the discussion above (see Fig. A6 for details).\n\nVariations in AC behavior due to ligand spacing\n\nFinally, we investigate the effect of ligands spacing in the behavior of ACs. As we discussed in the introduction, cell adhesion depends not only on the rigidity of the ECM but also on the spacing between attaching locations. We compute the ligand spacing as a function of the number of ligands in the substrate and of the AC radius (see Fig. A10 for details). We focus on ACs crowded with α5β3 integrins [50] and use experimental data of the adhesion length as a function of the substrate stiffness [50] for ligands placed 50, 100 and 200 nm apart. These data and the resulting number of ligands are summarized in Fig. 12. We analyze again the evolution of ACs for stiffness of the substrate in 0.1 — 100 kPa. The remaining parameters are the same as in Section.\n\nand increase as the stiffness of the substrate increases, with slightly higher values for substrates with ligand spacing of 50 nm than of 100 nm (Fig. 13). However, when the ligands are placed 200 nm apart, there is a sharp increase of these variables between 0.5 kPa and 2 kPa, overpassing the values for the 50 nm case at 2 kPa. Between 2 kPa and 10 kPa, we obtain a sudden decrease of the adhesion size down to 180 nm, and just 5 ligands, where it keeps constant. The overall behavior of the bound probability, Pb, the actin velocity, v, the average force Fc,bound, the displacements of the integrins, xint,bound, and talin, xtalin,bound, and the normalized density of integrins dint,norm is similar for the three distances. These results suggest that, on average, the behavior of the CAMs does not depend on the ligand spacing, although the maximum force and displacements of integrins and talins show striking differences depending on ligands spacing.\n\nThe substrate displacement depends on the displacement at each binder and the total number of bound binders. As we obtain a similar average force for the three cases, and a similar probability of bound binders, we obtain larger substrate displacements as we increase the number of ligands (Fig. 13). Likewise, the total number of bound vinculins depends on the number of bound binders as well as on the number of unfolded domains per talin. We show an increase of bound vinculins for the 50 nm and 100 nm cases as the substrate stiffness increases. The bound probability is comparable in these two cases and the stretch of the talin rod, and consequently the unfolding events, is higher in the 50 nm case. This explains the increase up to 80 and 20 bound vinculins for the 50 nm and 100 nm cases, respectively. However, the 200 nm case does not present an increase in bound vinculins in stiff substrates, because of the very low number of bound binders in substrates stiffer than 1 kPa. As previously discussed for ACs crowded with α5β1 integrins, the normalized integrin density is not affected by the increase in vinculin activity. Therefore, the effective integrin recruitment for the cases analyzed is mostly negligible and the differences shown in the talin mechanosensing (number of vinculin recruited) have no effect in the traction forces.\n\nFinally, the cell traction increases for increasing ligands number and substrate rigidities. The maximum tractions, found for the stiffest substrates are ≈ 75, 150 and 600 Pa for the 200 nm, 100 nm and 50 nm cases, respectively. Because the cell traction is computed as the ratio of all forces acting on the substrate over the area of the AC, and Pb is similar for the three distances, traction in the ACs increases for increasing number of ligands, which occurs for decreasing distance in a same adhesion area (see values at E = 5 kPa, Fig. 13) or, to a lesser degree, for increasing adhesion areas for constant ligands spacing (Fig. 13). These results indicate that the cell traction at a single AC is mostly determined by the behavior of the single adhesion chains and that the density of bound binders is the determining factor for the cell traction.\n\nConclusions\n\nIntegrin-based cell adhesion is a central mechanical function to the cell [1]. These cell adhesions are responsible for the attachment of cells to the ECM [3] and, therefore, for controlling cell motility in development, e.g. during neural formation [94], nuclear mechanotransduction [95] and diseases processes such as tumor invasion [96].\n\nIn this work, we have first carefully analyzed previous clutch models for cell-ECM dynamics. As previously shown [43, 8, 71], they closely reproduce the cell response at the whole cell-scale. We also identified a number of simplifications and inconsistencies with the mechanical response of previous experimental observations at the scale of the CAMs, which arise from an over-simplified description of the AC. First, the chain of CAMs was reduced to a unique linear spring that roughly gathers the responses of each individual CAMs. This is not just a structural simplification but, more importantly, it results in unphysiological values of the forces and displacements obtained at the molecular chains. Second, the substrate has been traditionally simplified to a single linear spring element that represent the deformation of the entire AC. The weakest link in the adhesion chain is identified in the integrin-fibronectin bond [8, 71]. It is clear that a group of integrins link to several attachment points in the ECM and, therefore, the deformation exerted on the ECM should change pointwise.\n\nTo address these issues, we adopted a detailed model of talin [24] that includes the non-linear mechanical behavior and the unfolding and refolding events of each talin domain. Then, we included detailed data on the integrin behavior [40, 69] and the subsequent vinculin binding to the talin rod. Moreover, we modeled the ECM deformation at each binding location by means of Green’s functions. We then integrated all these elements and solved the adhesion dynamics at the whole AC as well as the individual CAM scale.\n\nWe used our multi-scale model to understand how ACs crowded with either αVβ3 or α5β1 behave mechanically at both the AC and the molecular levels. Our results agree with previous clutch models and experimental data on traction forces. More importantly, our results on the deformation and force in each CAM closely agree with previous data. This is a key aspect of our model, because it allows us to analyze the whole AC dynamics, while significantly increasing the model predictions at the molecular scale. In other words, we have built the model from the basic components of the AC and, still, the model reproduces the results at the whole adhesion scale. For those parameters that may change depending on specific adhesion cases, such as the substrate stiffness or the type of integrin with which a specific cell is crowded, we ran a sensitivity analysis. This analysis allowed us to specifically pinpoint threshold values at which the traction force would increase or vanish. This is an important aspect in the cell function, because changes in cell traction are associated with alterations in the cell function, including tissue cohesiveness or cell migration.\n\nOur model also showed that ligand distance may not be, by itself, responsible for changes in CAMs response. However, we did show important differences in cell tractions. These differences are due to changes in the AC size. However, previous data on cell tractions for d = 50 nm and d = 100 nm in human breast myoepithelial cells showed a similar response [50]. The discrepancy between the model results and the experimental data may be due to the spatial scales analyzed. Indeed, we have mostly compared our computational results with experimental data at the whole cell scale (see, e.g., [8, 50, 43]). However, our model specifically tackles single ACs while the experimental traction forces are usually obtained as an averaged quantity over cell sections larger than the actual AC size. The density of ACs per area, and not only the size of the complex, may explain these differences. For example, a FA density higher for d =100 nm than for d = 50nm would give overlapping curves for the cell traction. We obtained very similar curves for the actin velocity when changing the distance between the ligands, and this is coherent with the experimental results [50]. However, our results refer to the velocity of the actin filaments within a stress fiber, while the experiments measure the retrograde flow velocity. Therefore, experimental data on single ACs will be helpful to validate the model and advance toward a better analysis of the AC behavior. Moreover, data on vinculin binding, integrin density and AC size while varying the substrate stiffness will help us to improve the model predictions.\n\nWe believe that we have advanced in the modeling and understanding of single ACs. However, there are still modeling aspects to improve for a better understanding of biological functions of cell adhesion. For example, epithelial cells follow a catch bond behavior with talin reinforcement [8, 71]. Neurons, on the other hand, follow a pure slip behavior [43]. How specifically the type of integrins within the AC impacts the adhesion response across multiple cell types is still poorly understood. To reproduce the traction forces on ACs of cells crowded with α5β1, we had to increase integrins lifetime 2-fold with respect to the actual values [40]. This inconsistency could be the result of a poor integrin dynamics modeling or missing mechanotransductive aspects in the model. The binding rates of vinculin to talin, konv = 1 × 108 s-1 was previously adjusted to fit experimental results [8, 71]. Previous data showed a vinculin binding rate of 0.2s-1 [97]. Probably, the model does not capture correctly some particular aspect of the AC behavior, which should be addressed, together with further experimental studies.\n\nOur model predicts that force itself cannot be responsible for AC disassembling because, at steady state, the rate of binding and unbinding reach a situation of semi-equilibrum in most of the cases. AC disassembling may be a downstream mechanotransductive result that we did not include in the model. Future studies should also focus on how forces induce mechanotransduction and biochemical processes to control AC disengagement. In line with this, we have considered that the AC remains always of the same size or, if we change it, it is directly imposed in the model based on previous experimental data. The analysis of the change in size during the entire formation and disengagement of the AC should also be addressed in the future.\n\nIn summary, we developed a clutch model to analyze single ACs at multiple scales. We have advanced in the understanding on how single CAMs that forms an AC behave. Overall, our model is a step forward in the efforts of rationalizing cell adhesion mechanics and it may also allow us to engineer the cell adhesion response to design better biomimetic tissues [98, 99, 100, 101, 102].\n\nMethods\n\nDescription of the clutch model\n\nFirst, the actin flow is simply computed by a force-velocity relation as: where vu is the unloaded velocity of the actin flow. The retrograde flow velocity reduces if the ratio between the reaction force in the substrate Fsub and the stall force of the myosin motors, Fsub, increases. In the case of mature ACs, thick stress fibers crowded by myosin motors pull on the adhesion patch with a total stall force Fstall = nmFm, where Fm is the force required to stall the activity of one myosin motor and nm the number of motors in the system.\n\nThen, the displacement of the engaged clutches is computed as Δx = vΔt, where Δt is the time step in the Monte Carlo or Gillespie simulation. The force at each i — th clutch, Fc,i, is given by where κc is the stiffness of each molecular clutch and xc,i is the displacement of the i – th molecular clutch. The substrate is represented by a simple Hookean spring such that the force on the substrate is Fsub = κsubxsub. The stiffness of the linear spring is κsub = E4πα/9, where E is the Young modulus of the substrate and a the radius of the AC. Then, the displacement of the substrate is obtained by solving the balance of forces between the neng engaged molecular clutches and the substrate as:\n\nOnce xsub is computed, we can obtain Fsub and the cell traction as P = Fsub/πa2, where (πα2) is the area occupied by a circular AC.\n\nOnce the force at each clutch, Fc,i, is obtained, we compute the binding and unbinding events at each molecular clutch. The nc molecular clutches are allowed to associate with the ECM, with rate kon, or to disengage, according to a dissociation rate . The Bell’s model is the simplest approach for a force-dependent unbinding rate that increases exponentially as where koff is the unloaded dissociation rate and Fb is the characteristic bond rupture force. This law follows a slip-behavior, meaning that as the force increases, the lifetime of the bond decreases exponentially (see Fig. 14). Experimental data also showed bonds that follow a catch behavior [40], in which the dissociation rate first decreases and then increases exponentially with the applied force as koff,slip and koff,catch are the unloaded dissociation rates, and Fb,slip and Fb,catch are the characteristic bond rupture forces, via the slip and catch pathways, respectively. The new bound and unbound clutches are then updated for the next time step when all the relations above are again computed.\n\nHowever, the catch bond model in Eq. 5 does not take into consideration the the Cyclic Mechanical Reinforcement (CMR) [69]. The CMR increases the lifetime of integrins when they are subjected to cycles of engagement and disengagement before a stable AC is formed. To take into account the effect of CMR, previous models increased the off rate at low forces (< 1 pN) (see Fig. 14) [8] and adopted an unbinding rate with CMR . We will use this particular form of in this section.\n\nFor all simulations in this section, we fix the radius of the AC to a =1700 nm. The number of ligands is nc =1200 in the catch case [8], which results in a ligands spacing of d = 100 nm (see Fig. A10 for details). To seemingly compare slip and catch cases, we keep d = 100 nm constant for the slip case, and fixing nc =75 [43] we obtain an AC radius of a = 447 nm. The remaining model parameters are summarized in Table 2. We analyze the model results in terms of the substrate stiffness, with Young’s modulus in the range of 0.1 - 100 kPa. This is the stiffness range found in biological tissues [70] and on which most in vitro studies have focused (see, e.g., [43, 8]). We analyze the probability of bound binders Pb, the actin velocity v, the cell traction P, the maximum and the average force over the bound binders, and Fc,bound, the maximum and the average displacement for bound binders and xint,bound, and the displacement of the substrate xsub. We average in time all these variables of interest to obtain the model predictions at specific stiffnesses of the substrate.\n\nComputation of the clutch model\n\nWe use MC simulations with constant time step, Δt =0.005 s. During the simulation time, many events of engagement and disengagement and, often, cycles of formation and rupture of ACs, take place. To evaluate the choice of the final time, we run MC simulations with different final times and choose tf = 100 s as large enough to achieve accurate results when averaging over time the MC simulations, while reducing at the same time the computational cost of the simulations (see Fig. A3 for details).\n\nThe actomyosin network pulls on the adhesion molecules thanks to the contractile forces of the myosin motors. An actin filament is bound to a number of myosin motors, nm, that generate contractile forces in the molecular chain. The velocity of the actin filament is again v = vu(1 – Fc/Fstall). Fc is the force at the molecular chain. The stall force is Fstall = nmFm, where nm = 40 and Fm = 2pN, giving a total stall force of 80pN per molecular chain (see Appendix,, for details). The total displacement of the engaged adhesion chain is given by xtot = vΔt.\n\nA multi-scale clutch model\n\nTo represent the talin behavior, we incorporate a full-length model of the talin rod mechanics [24], where all the 13 domains have their specific unfolding and refolding rates and a non-linear force-displacement relationship (Fig. 3). We assume that vinculin binds to the unfolded R3 domain, which induces integrins recruitment in the AC, as we described in the previous section. We also assume that actin binds to talin in the ending R13-DD part of the rod. The unfolding rates of the talin rod domains follow a Bell’s model and the folding rates follow an Arrhenius law [84, 24]. Mechanically, the folded domains behave as a freely-jointed chain (FJC), where the end-to-end distance of the folded domain, xfol, is l0 is the rigid body size of the folded domain and kBT is the thermal energy. The unfolded domains behave as a Worm-Like Chain (WLC), where xunf is the end-to-end length of the unfolded domain, A is the persistence length and L0 is the contour length. All talin model parameters are described elsewhere [24].\n\nTo model the integrin behavior, we use the binding and unbinding rates defined in Section for catch bonds. We use a linear spring to model the force-displacement relation in each integrin molecule, such that F = kc(xc — xsub). xint = xc — xsub is the displacement of the integrin molecule and xc is the displacement at the integrin-talin bond position.\n\nTo mechanically model the extracellular space, we use the Green’s functions in a semi-infinite and isotropic medium [85]. The Green’s function solution relates the elastic displacement in the i-direction at a point x due to a force in the j-direction applied at the origin as where μ is the shear modulus, v the Poisson’s ratio of the medium and x is the distance from the field point and the point of force application.\n\nWe consider a 2D substrate on the XY-plane, where are engagement points have coordinates x = (x, y). The angle θ = 15° between the adhesion chains and the substrate [5, 12] gives forces in the same direction and results in a substrate displacement with non-zero components in the three dimensions. Here, we consider horizontal forces and substrate displacements laying in the XY-plane. Moreover, we consider that all bound binders bear forces with the same direction as all actin filaments in the stress fiber and molecular chains bundle in parallel. Therefore our substrate displacements will have only one dimension and all chains pull on the ECM in the same direction. Therefore, the displacement of the substrate in the direction i due to the force also in the direction i is given as xsub,i = ĜFc,i, where Ĝ = Ĝii is the Green’s function referring to the only relevant direction i.\n\nWe call xsub the vector of one-dimensional displacements xsub(s) in all the points s inside the FA, and we call Fc the vector of forces Fc(b) in the ligand points b = 1,…, nc. Therefore, the displacement of the substrate at all sampling locations is given as xsub = Ĝ · Fc.\n\nOnce all model variables are solved, the traction exerted by the AC on the substrate is simple computed as P = F/A. As the Green’s function is singular at the point where the binder is bound and the force is applied, the displacement is computed at a distance of 5 nm from the binder.\n\nComputation of the multi-scale clutch model\n\nWe use here a Gillespie algorithm [86, 87] with variable time step, which is determined by the events rates: binding/unbinding of integrin molecules to the ECM and folding/unfolding rates of the talin rod. The time at which each event, i, happens is computed as t = – lnξi/ki, for all binders i = 1…nc. ξi are independent random numbers uniformly distributed over [0, 1] and ki is the event rate. After computing the time of all possible events at the current time step, we choose the minimum time ti and update the corresponding event.\n\nNumber of myosin motors and stall force\n\nIn order to find values for the number of myosin motors nm attached to an actin fibre and the stall force for a single myosin motor Fm, we look for an experimental value of the total stall force Fstall = nm Fm. The ensemble stall force can be written as [103]: where Fsm = Kx-bridgedstep is the stall force for a single motor, Nheads is the number of myosin motors and ρ(Fsm) is the duty ratio of a single motor at stall, which can be computed as:\n\nThe expression for the myosin off-rate is [104]:\n\nMyosins are a superfamily of motor proteins. Myosin II is responsible for producing muscle contraction in muscle cells in most animals, but it is also found in non-muscle cells inside stress fibres. Hence, it can be further classified into skeletal muscle myosin II, smooth muscle myosin II, and nonmuscle myosin II (NM II) [103]. More precisely, the myosins having a role in cell adhesion are NM IIA and NM IIB. NM IIA mediates the initial maturation of FAs, and NM IIB is found in fibrillar adhesions. Adhesions with NM IIA are dynamic, while those with NM IIB are very stable [105]. In the leading edge of the cell, both types are present, while NM IIA characterizes the rear edge and NM IIB is found in the actin close to the nucleus of the cell [106]. It has been demonstrated that 90% of the traction force generated by mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) on a fibronectin-coated substrate is lost with the removal of NM IIs, and that NM IIA is responsible for ≈ 60% of the force, whereas NM IIB accounts for the ≈ 30% [107, 108].\n\nUsing Eqs. 9, 10 and 11, with parameters in Table 3, we compute the ensemble stall force Fstall for NM IIA and NM IIB. Considering that in our setting there is a percentage of myosin motors of each type, we choose a total stall force in the range , and precisely Fstall = 80 pN. The stall force for a single myosin motor is found to be at least Fm = 1.7 pN [89], therefore, following Fstall = nm Fm, we consider nm = 40 myosin motors, each with a stall force Fm = 2pN.\n\nSupporting information\n\nSupplementary figures\n\nAll the figures of the model results in time for all substrates rigidities described in Section for α5β1 integrins are uploaded in here.\n\nAll the figures of the model results in time for all substrates rigidities described in Section for α5β3 integrins are uploaded in here.\n\nAll the figures of the model results in Section are uploaded in here.\n\nAll the figures of the model results in Section are uploaded in here.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe acknowledge funding from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (PID2019-110949GB-I00 P.S.), the European Commission (H2020-FETPROACT-01-2016-731957 to C.V. and P.S), the Generalitat de Catalunya (2017-SGR-1278 to P.S. and FI AGAUR 2018 to C.V.).\n\nReferences\n\n1.↵\n\nJ.
