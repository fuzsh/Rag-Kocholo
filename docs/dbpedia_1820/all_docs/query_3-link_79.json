        "text": "Vascular access in lipoprotein apheresis: a retrospective analysis from the UK's largest lipoprotein apheresis centre.\n\nPubMed\n\nDoherty, Daniel J; Pottle, Alison; Malietzis, George; Hakim, Nadey; Barbir, Mahmoud; Crane, Jeremy S\n\n2018-01-01\n\nLipoprotein apheresis (LA) has proven to be an effective, safe and life-saving therapy. Vascular access is needed to facilitate this treatment but has recognised complications. Despite consistency in treatment indication and duration there are no guidelines in place. The aim of this study is to characterise vascular access practice at the UK's largest LA centre and forward suggestions for future approaches. A retrospective analysis of vascular access strategies was undertaken in all patients who received LA treatment in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) Apheresis Unit at Harefield Hospital (Middlesex, UK) from November 2000 to March 2016. Fifty-three former and current patients underwent 4260 LA treatments. Peripheral vein cannulation represented 79% of initial vascular access strategies with arteriovenous (AV) fistula use accounting for 15%. Last used method of vascular access was peripheral vein cannulation in 57% versus AV fistula in 32%. Total AV fistula failure rate was 37%. Peripheral vein cannulation remains the most common method to facilitate LA. Practice trends indicate a move towards AV fistula creation; the favoured approach receiving support from the expert body in this area. AV fistula failure rate is high and of great concern, therefore we suggest the implementation of upper limb ultrasound vascular mapping in all patients who meet treatment eligibility criteria. We encourage close ties between apheresis units and specialist surgical centres to facilitate patient counselling and monitoring. Further prospective data regarding fistula failure is needed in this expanding treatment field.\n\nCurrent insights into the German Lipoprotein Apheresis Registry (GLAR) - Almost 5 years on.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchettler, V J J; Neumann, C L; Peter, C; Zimmermann, T; Julius, U; Roeseler, E; Heigl, F; GrÃ¼tzmacher, P; Blume, H\n\n2017-11-01\n\nIn recent years the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA), a paramount decision-making body of the German health care system required a reassessment of the approval of chronic lipoprotein apheresis therapy for regular reimbursement. Since 2005 an interdisciplinary German apheresis working group has been established by members of both German Societies of Nephrology. In 2009 the working group completed the indication for lipoprotein apheresis with respect to current cardiovascular guidelines and current scientific knowledge for the registry. In 2011 the German Lipoprotein Apheresis Registry (GLAR) was launched and data acquired over nearly 5 years can now be reported. All data were collected and analyzed during the time period 2012-2015. Over this time interval, 68 German apheresis centers collected retrospective and prospective observational data of 1.283 patients undergoing lipoprotein apheresis (LA) treatment of high LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and/or high lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) levels suffering from progressive cardiovascular disease (CVD). A total of 15,167 documented LA treatments were investigated. All patients treated by LA exhibited a median LDL-C reduction rate of 68.6%, and a median Lp(a) reduction rate of 70.4%. Analogue to the Pro(a)LiFe pattern, patient data were analyzed and compared with respect to the incidence rate of coronary events (MACE) 1 and 2 years before the start of LA treatment (y-2 and y-1) and prospectively one year on LA treatment (y+1). During the first year of LA treatment a MACE reduction of 97% was be observed. In the years considered, LA treatment side effects occurred at a low rate (ca. 5%) and mainly comprised puncture problems. For the first time data generated by the GLAR shows that LA lowers the incidence rate of cardiovascular events in patients with high LDL-C and/or high Lp(a) levels, progressive CVD and maximally tolerated lipid lowering medication.

In 2011 the German Lipoprotein Apheresis Registry (GLAR) was launched and data are available over nearly 5Â years now. During the time period 2012-2016, 71Â German apheresis centers collected retrospective and prospective observational data of 1435 patients undergoing lipoprotein apheresis (LA) treatment of high LDL-C levels and/or high LpÂ (a) levels suffering from cardiovascular disease (CVD) or progressive CVD. AÂ total of 15,527 completely documented LA treatments were entered into the database. All patients treated by LA showed aÂ median LDL-C reduction rate of 67.5%, and aÂ median LpÂ (a) reduction rate of 71.1%. Analog to the Pro(a)LiFe pattern, patient data were analyzed to the incidence rate of coronary events (MACE) 1 and 2Â years before the beginning of LA treatment (y-2 and yâ1) and prospectively two years on LA treatment (yÂ + 1 and yÂ + 2). During two years of LA treatment aÂ MACE reduction of 78% was observed. In the years considered, side effects of LA treatment were low (5.9%) and mainly comprised puncture problems. The data generated by the GLAR shows that LA lowers the incidence rate of cardiovascular events in patients with high LDL-C and/or high LpÂ (a) levels, progressive CVD, and maximally tolerated lipid lowering medication. In addition, LA treatments were found to be safe with aÂ low rate of side effects.\n\nEffect of mipomersen on LDL-cholesterol in patients with severe LDL-hypercholesterolaemia and atherosclerosis treated by lipoprotein apheresis (The MICA-Study).\n\nPubMed\n\nWaldmann, Elisa; Vogt, Anja; Crispin, Alexander; Altenhofer, Julia; Riks, Ina; Parhofer, Klaus G\n\n2017-04-01\n\nIn this study, we evaluated the effect of mipomersen in patients with severe LDL-hypercholesterolaemia and atherosclerosis, treated by lipid lowering drugs and regular lipoprotein apheresis. This prospective, randomized, controlled phase II single center trial enrolled 15 patients (9 males, 6 females; 59Â Â±Â 9 y, BMI 27Â Â±Â 4Â kg/m 2 ) with established atherosclerosis, LDL-cholesterol â¥130Â mg/dL (3.4Â mmol/L) despite maximal possible drug therapy, and fulfilling German criteria for regular lipoprotein apheresis. All patients were on stable lipid lowering drug therapy and regular apheresis for >3 months. Patients randomized to treatment (nÂ =Â 11) self-injected mipomersen 200Â mg sc weekly, at day 4 after apheresis, for 26 weeks. Patients randomized to control (nÂ =Â 4) continued apheresis without injection. The primary endpoint was the change in pre-apheresis LDL-cholesterol. Of the patients randomized to mipomersen, 3 discontinued the drug early (<12 weeks therapy) for side effects. For these, another 3 were recruited and randomized. Further, 4 patients discontinued mipomersen between 12 and 26 weeks for side effects (moderate to severe injection site reactions nÂ =Â 3 and elevated liver enzymes nÂ =Â 1). In those treated for >12 weeks, mipomersen reduced pre-apheresis LDL-cholesterol significantly by 22.6Â Â±Â 17.0%, from a baseline of 4.8Â Â±Â 1.2Â mmol/L to 3.7Â Â±Â 0.9Â mmol/L, while there was no significant change in the control group (+1.6Â Â±Â 9.3%), with the difference between the groups being significant (p=0.02). Mipomersen also decreased pre-apheresis lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) concentration from a median baseline of 40.2Â mg/dL (32.5,71) by 16% (-19.4,13.6), though without significance (p=0.21). Mipomersen reduces LDL-cholesterol (significantly) and Lp(a) (non-significantly) in patients on maximal lipid-lowering drug therapy and regular apheresis, but is often associated with side effects.

Therefore, a large animal model was established to characterize a new plasma fractionation membrane. Four sheep were randomized, controlled, and crossover subjected to double ofiltration lipoprotein apheresis with three specimens of FractioPES R having slightly different HDL sieving coefficients (S K ) (FPESa, 0.30, FPESb, 0.26, and FPESc, 0.22) versus a control fractionator (EVAL). S K and reduction ratios were determined for LDL, HDL, fibrinogen, IgG, and albumin. Compared to EVAL (0.42âÂ±â0.04 to 0.74âÂ±â0.08) and FPESa (0.36âÂ±â0.06 to 0.64âÂ±â0.04), S K for HDL were lower (Pâ<â0.05) with FPESc (0.30âÂ±â0.04 to 0.49âÂ±â0.10). Fibrinogen S K were higher (Pâ<â0.05) with EVAL (0.02âÂ±â0.01 to 0.40âÂ±â0.08) compared to FPESb (0.05âÂ±â0.02 to 0.26âÂ±â0.34) and FPESc (0.01âÂ±â0.01 to 0.21âÂ±â0.16). No further differences were determined. The animal model distinguished between minor differences in fractionation membrane permeability, demonstrating equivalent sieving of FPESa and EVAL and slightly inferior permeability of FPESb and FPESc.

BACKGROUND ON FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA: Familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic autosomal dominant disorder that is caused by several mutations in the LDL-receptor gene. The reduced number or absence of functional LDL receptors results in impaired hepatic clearance of circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) particles, which results in extremely high levels of LDL-C in the bloodstream. Familial hypercholesterolemia is characterized by excess LDL-C deposits in tendons and arterial walls, early onset of atherosclerotic disease, and premature cardiac death. Familial hypercholesterolemia occurs in both HTZ and HMZ forms. Heterozygous FH is one of the most common monogenic metabolic disorders in the general population, occurring in approximately 1 in 500 individuals. Nevertheless, HTZ FH is largely undiagnosed and an accurate diagnosis occurs in only about 15% of affected patients in Canada. Thus, it is estimated that there are approximately 3,800 diagnosed and 21,680 undiagnosed cases of HTZ FH in Ontario. In HTZ FH patients, half of the LDL receptors do not work properly or are absent, resulting in plasma LDL-C levels 2- to 3-fold higher than normal (range 7-15mmol/L or 300-500mg/dL). Most HTZ FH patients are not diagnosed until middle age when either they or one of their siblings present with symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). Without lipid-lowering treatment, 50% of males die before the age of 50 and 25% of females die before the age of 60, from myocardial infarction or sudden death. In contrast to the HTZ form, HMZ FH is rare (occurring in 1 case per million persons) and more severe, with a 6- to 8-fold elevation in plasma LDL-C levels (range 15-25mmol\n\nPleiotropic Effect of Lipoprotein-Apheresis on the Soluble Form of Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule (sALCAM) in Familial Hypercholesterolaemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nvon Bauer, RÃ¼diger; Oikonomou, Dimitrios; Sulaj, Alba; Kopf, Stefan; Fleming, Thomas; Rudofsky, Gottfried; Nawroth, Peter\n\n2018-06-11\n\nAtherosclerosis is an inflammatory disorder in which several converging immune responses modulate and induce lipid accumulation in macrophages. Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) has been described as a structural homologue of HDL-receptor and functions as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR), while its soluble form sALCAM is involved in ALCAM-dependent and -independent immune mechanisms. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of aggressive removal of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and lipoprotein(a) (Lp [a]) by lipoprotein-apheresis (LA) on sALCAM and blood viscosity as well as to evaluate its association with lipoproteins and serum markers of inflammation.

He received immunosuppressive therapy for two years, including prednisolone, cyclophosphamide, and cyclosporine A, but the NS persisted. Low-density lipoprotein apheresis (LDL-A) was initiated at a frequency of twice a month and continued for 9 years (203 sessions in total). His proteinuria reduced to less than 1 g daily after 9 years. LDL-A was stopped, and the NS has not relapsed for five years. This case suggests that long-term LDL-A therapy may be a treatment option for idiopathic MGN refractory to immunosuppressive therapy or short-term LDL-A.\n\nLDL apheresis in the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia: experience of Hospital Santo AntÃ³nio, Porto.\n\nPubMed\n\nPalma, Isabel; Caldas, Ana Rita; Palma, Isabel Mangas; QueirÃ³s, JosÃ© Alexandre; Madureira, Anselmo; Oliveira, JosÃ© Carlos; Palma, Paulo; Correia, Carlos; Ramos, Maria Helena\n\n2015-03-01\n\nHigh plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol are a risk factor for the development of premature atherosclerosis. Direct adsorption of lipoproteins (DALI) is an apheresis technique by which LDL cholesterol is selectively removed from whole blood. The present study describes our experience with DALI LDL apheresis in severely hypercholesterolemic patients. Three hypercholesterolemic patients suffering from atherosclerotic complications were treated fortnightly by DALI apheresis, in a total of 308 sessions between December 2008 and January 2013. All patients were on the highest tolerated dose of statins and other lipid-lowering drugs. The sessions were essentially uneventful, adverse events being recorded in only 3.6% of them. A mean 63.3% acute reduction in LDL cholesterol was obtained. DALI apheresis proved to be a simple, safe and efficient method of lipid apheresis in hypercholesterolemic patients refractory to conservative lipid-lowering therapy.

Lipoprotein apheresis (LA) is often required for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in severe FH. The objective of this study was to present the first experiences with LA in Malaysia, between 2004 andÂ 2014. We retrospectively collected data from patient records to assess the effectiveness, adverse effects, patient quality of life, and costs associated with an LA service for genetically confirmed homozygous and heterozygous FH. We treated 13 women and 2 men aged 6 to 59Â years, 10 with homozygous and 5 with heterozygous FH, all on maximally tolerated cholesterol-lowering drug therapy, for a total of 65 patient-years. Acute lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol post apheresis was 56.3 Â±Â 7.2%, with time-averaged mean lowering of 34.9 Â±Â 13.9%. No patients experienced any cardiovascular events during the period of receiving LA. Patients receiving LA experienced few side effects and enjoyed reasonable quality of life, but inability to continue treatment was frequent because of cost. LA for severe FH can be delivered effectively in the short term in developing nations, but costs are a major barrier to sustaining this mode of treatment for this high-risk group of patients. New drug therapies for FH, such as the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitors, and apolipoprotein-B100 antisense oligonucleotides may allow improved care for these patients, but costs and long-term safety remain as issues to be addressed.

However, the treatment remains quite expensive in Western Europe and the US. Apheresis tourism is a part of medical tourism or medical tourism specially related to therapeutic apheresis (TA) treatment in a foreign country on a cost effective basis. In the last couple of years, 'Medical Tourism' has become an upcoming and growing enterprise in India. The Indian Society for Apheresis (ISA) has taken a plunge at the opportune time and is trying to promote apheresis tourism in India. ISA is a member of various international apheresis organizations globally including the World Apheresis Association (WAA), the International Society for Apheresis (ISFA), the International Society for Artificial Organs (ISAO) and an associate of other national apheresis societies. The Indian Society for Apheresis (ISA) and the Ludhiana MediCiti (LMC) at Ludhiana Punjab are taking a big step in this direction. The therapeutic apheresis (TA) center at LMC is being set up as a Therapeutic Apheresis Institute and Research Center of excellence. The potential future impacts on the apheresis scenario are summarized.\n\nA successful model to learn and implement ultrasound-guided venous catheterization in apheresis.\n\nPubMed\n\nGopalasingam, Nigopan; Thomsen, Anna-Marie Eller; Folkersen, Lars; Juhl-Olsen, Peter; Sloth, Erik\n\n2017-12-01\n\nApheresis treatments can be performed with peripheral venous catheters (PVC), although central venous catheters (CVC) are inserted when PVCs fail or patient with history of difficult vascular access prior to the apheresis. Ultrasound guidance for PVC has shown promising results in other settings. To investigate if ultrasound guidance for PVC could be implemented among apheresis nurses. Second, how implementation of ultrasound guidance affected the number of CVCs used for apheresis per patient. Apheresis nurses completed a systematic training program for ultrasound-guided vascular access. All independent catheterizations were registered during the implementation stage. The number of CVCs in the pre- and postimplementation stages of the ultrasound guidance was compared. Six nurses completed the training program within a median of 48 days (range 38-83 days). In 77 patients, 485 independent ultrasound-guided PVC placements were performed during the implementation stage. All apheresis treatments (485/485) were accomplished using PVCs without requiring CVC as rescue. During the preimplementation stage, 125 of 273 (45.8%) procedures required a CVC for completion of apheresis procedures; during the postimplementation stage only 30 of 227 (13.2%) procedures required a CVC (pâ<â0.001). In the postimplementation stage, no CVCs were placed as rescue caused by failed PVCs but were only placed for patients where the ultrasound machine was unavailable. It indicates an effective success rate of 100% for ultrasound-guided PVC use. This study showed that ultrasound guidance could be implemented among apheresis nurses as a routine tool eliminating the need of CVC as a rescue.

This study was designed to compare the yield of CD3(+), CD3(+)4(+), CD3(+)8(+), CD19(+), CD3(-)56(+)16(+), and CD34(+) cells contained in apheresis products from 61 consecutive non-cytokine treated, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donors for lymphocyte collection with the corresponding apheresis-derived cell yield from 112 consecutive, HLA-matched donors for blood stem cell collection who received recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF, filgrastim) 6 microg/kg every 12 hours until cell collection was completed. Apheresis was started on day 4 or 5 of rhG-CSF treatment. The yield of lymphoid subsets was significantly different in the two sample groups, rhG-CSF treated product yields exceeding untreated product yields by a median of 2.1-fold (range: 1.3-2.6). However, the CD34(+) cell yield in rhG-CSF-treated apheresis products exceeded untreated products by 26-fold. A single untreated apheresis procedure was usually sufficient to collect a target dose of 1 x 10(8)/kg CD3(+) cells. Untreated apheresis products contained a median of 0.2 x 10(6)/kg CD34(+) cells. A potential engraftment dose of > or =0.5 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells per kg of recipient body weight was contained in 16% of 57 untreated apheresis products. One single apheresis performed in a normal, untreated donor provides a sufficient amount of CD3(+) cells for adoptive immunotherapy. Compared with that of an rhG-CSF stimulated apheresis product, the CD34(+) cell count is usually, but not always, below the engraftment dose range. RhG-CSF treatment has little effect on the yield of lymphoid subsets collected by apheresis but is highly selective of the release of CD34(+) cells.

The Spectra Optia (Terumo BCT) is a novel development of the precursor instrument, the Cobe Spectra (Terumo BCT). In this report, 146 autologous and 42 allogeneic donors undergoing apheresis on the Cobe Spectra using the mononuclear cell (MNC) program 4.7 or on the Spectra Optia using the new continuous mononuclear cell (cMNC) program 11.2 are compared. Viability of cells and collection efficacy within the apheresis products was comparable for autologous and allogeneic products collected with the MNC or cMNC method. However, we found a reduced duration of the apheresis procedure and lower hematocrit within the apheresis products when using the cMNC in autologous and allogeneic donors. Moreover, allogeneic donors collected substantially more CD34 + cells per kilogram of body weight when using the cMNC method. Differences in platelets before and after apheresis were substantially smaller in this cohort when compared to the cohort collected with the MNC method. Neutrophil and platelet engraftment after autologous or allogeneic transplantation with a product collected with the MNC procedure was comparable to a transplantation with a product processed according to the cMNC method. Comparison of the MNC (Cobe Spectra) and the cMNC (Spectra Optia) methods demonstrated an equal performance and outcome. However, advantages were present using the cMNC method with respect to apheresis duration and hematocrit within the apheresis product (autologous/allogeneic donors) and numbers of CD34 + cells collected, especially in allogeneic donors.

Angiographic examinations demonstrated total obstruction of the bilateral external iliac arteries and the bilateral superficial femoral arteries with collateral circulation to the distal vessels. Urgent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty dissolved the obstruction of the left external iliac artery, and subsequent low-density-lipoprotein apheresis ameliorated his progressive ischemia in the lower extremities. Femoro-femoral and bilateral femoro-popliteal bypasses were performed 31 days after the endovascular intervention, which achieved successful limb salvage with the relief of ischemic symptoms related to arteriosclerotic obliterans.

The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) publishes Guidelines on the use of therapeutic apheresis every 3 years with the goal of providing the best available evidence for apheresis practice as well as clinical expertise. The 2016 (7th ed.) ASFA Guidelines contain 87 diseases (up from 78 in the 6th ed.) and 179 indications. This review outlines three new therapeutic apheresis indications for hematological disorders. The three new nonmalignant and nontransplant-related hematological disorders discussed are therapeutic plasma exchange procedures for hemophagocytic syndrome, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome, and red blood cell exchange to prevent alloimmunization after exposure to rhesus (D)-positive red blood cells. All three indications are ASFA category III indications (i.e., optimal role of apheresis therapy is not established) with Grade 2C recommendation (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Although the three new therapeutic apheresis indications related to hematological disorders are ASFA category III with Grade 2C recommendations, along with other ASFA category III with Grade 2C recommendations, they may form the list of diseases for which basic, translational, and clinical research is needed to provide better evidence for clinical practice.\n\n[Apheresis in children: procedures and outcome].\n\nPubMed\n\nTummolo, Albina; Colella, Vincenzo; Bellantuono, Rosa; Giordano, Mario; Messina, Giovanni; Puteo, Flora; Sorino, Palma; De Palo, Tommaso\n\n2012-01-01\n\nApheresis procedures are used in children to treat an increasing number of conditions by removing different types of substances from the bloodstream. In a previous study we evaluated the first results of our experience in children, emphasizing the solutions adopted to overcome technical difficulties and to adapt adult apheresis procedures to a pediatric population. The aim of the present study is to present data on a larger number of patients in whom apheresis was the main treatment. Ninety-three children (50 m, 43 f) affected by renal and/or extrarenal diseases were included. They were treated with LDL apheresis, protein A immunoadsorption, or plasma exchange. Our therapeutic protocol was the same as described in the previous study. Renal diseases and immunological disorders remained the most common conditions requiring this therapeutic approach. However, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) was no longer the most frequent renal condition to be treated, as apheresis is currently the first treatment option only in cases of atypical HUS. In this series we also treated small children, showing that low weight should no longer be considered a contraindication to apheresis procedures. The low rate of complications and the overall satisfactory clinical results with increasingly advanced technical procedures make a wider use of apheresis in children realistic in the years to come.\n\nCosting complexities in mixed apheresis.\n\nPubMed\n\nTrenchard, P M\n\n1993-07-01\n\nFor mixed apheresis procedures {plasma (PMA) and platelets (PLTs) as products}, six cost-accounting methods are described for apportioning the unit procedure cost ($156.02; representative example) to the two products. The methods are derived from clinical/scientific apheresis principles, but provide a wide range of unit PLT costs ($14.10, 19.71, 34.37, 42.06, 43.82 and 52.00) which relate inversely to the corresponding unit PMA costs ($73.84, 63.01, 34.36, 19.37, 15.94 and 0.00). Two of the methods appear particularly appropriate, depending upon whether the procedure is driven by PLTs predominantly or by PMA+PLTs equally. The paper encourages apheresis physicians and scientists to debate the relative attributes of the methods, develop refinements of the same, and determine through dialogue that mixed apheresis costing models properly account for the clinical science of the service provided.\n\nApheresis training for nurses and physicians around the World.\n\nPubMed\n\nNeyrinck, Marleen; Vrielink, Hans\n\n2015-02-01\n\nA training program for apheresis nurses in leukocyte collection and therapeutic apheresis was developed by the Joint Task Force for Apheresis Education and Certification. This is a modular program with theoretical and practical information and knowledge. On request of the Indonesian authorities, in the capital of Indonesia Jakarta, a certification course for apheresis nurses/operators based on the training program described above was organized in December 2013. The course existed of themes related to apheresis, such as hematology, anatomy, physiology, calculations, adverse events, basics of apheresis, nursing aspects, quality, collection of cells for cellular therapies, pediatrics, and therapeutic collections (cell reductions and exchange procedures). A pretest and post-test regarding the knowledge and judgment in the themes described was taken in Bahasa Indonesia or in English. In total, 38 apheresis nurses and 32 physicians participated in the course. In the post-test, the nurses scored in a mean 72/100 and the physicians 77/100 (nurses vs. physicians: Pâ=â0.005), which was significantly better than the results of the pretest (54/100 and 53/100, respectively (Pâ<â0.0001 for both). In conclusion, with this course, 38 apheresis nurses/operators proved a significant increase of knowledge in the theory behind apheresis. This educational program provides an approach to educate and certificate apheresis nurses. It is also shown that also for physicians working in the field of apheresis, this course is of use increasing their knowledge regarding apheresis.

In the standard procedure, acid citrate dextrose (ACD-A) is used as anticoagulation and the adsorber is rinsed with a specially manufactured priming solution (PS). Using neutral trisodium citrate (TSC) instead of ACD-A might improve the acid-base homeostasis during DALI apheresis; moreover, applying wholesale hemofiltration solutions instead of the special PS might avoid the use of two separate solutions for both priming before and reinfusion after the treatment, thus simplifiying the procedure. The present study was performed to test the effect of neutral (TSC) anticoagulation and of two different commercially available hemofiltration (HF) priming solutions on the efficacy and biocompatibility of DALI apheresis. Five hypercholesterolemic chronic DALI patients were treated prospectively, on a weekly or biweekly basis, 3 times each by standard DALI-apheresis (A). by DALI using 4% TSC and bicarbonate-buffered HF BIC35-210 priming (B). as well as by DALI using 4% TSC and lactate-buffered HF 23 priming (C). After the sessions, the extracorporeal circuit (ECC) was rinsed with saline in study arm A and with the corresponding HF solutions in study arms B and C, respectively. Acute LDL-cholesterol reductions in the study arms A/B/C averaged 64/64/63%, for Lp(a) 62/64/62%, respectively (n=15). Clinically, all sessions were essentially uneventful and no clots were observed in the ECC. No major differences were found between the 3 study arms with respect to biocompatibility (elastase, C3a, thrombin-antithrombin, beta-thromboglobulin, bradykinin). DALI apheresis using TSC anticoagulation and HF solutions for both priming and reinfusion proved to be as safe and effective as the standard DALI apheresis. These modifications, however, further simplify the procedure.\n\nTherapeutic apheresis in Asia: An Indonesia single center experience.\n\nPubMed\n\nTriyono, Teguh; Vrielink, Hans\n\n2015-06-01\n\nIn developing countries, like Indonesia, apheresis is still a relative new procedure. Nowadays, therapeutic apheresis procedures are performed in the field of hematology and neurology, especially in the teaching hospitals in Indonesia. Therapeutic apheresis procedure, that is, leukocytapheresis, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), and thrombocytapheresis are already performed. In the period 2009-2013, 204 apheresis procedures in 137 patients to reduce the leukocytes, 72 TPE procedures in 17 patients, and 14 thrombocyte reductions were performed in the Sardjito hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. In the future, to improve the therapeutic apheresis implementation, it is important to increase the insurance coverage and also should be considered to introduce the apheresis medicine into the curriculum of appropriate physician programs in Indonesia. Especially in Indonesia, a lot of efforts are still being needed to improve implementation of therapeutic apheresis.

In this single-center prospective analysis, 52 healthy donors were investigated to determine the efficacy of intermediate-dose rhG-CSF 2x8 microg/kg donor body weight (bw) and intermediate large volume apheresis (LVA, median 12 l) to mobilize peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) for allogeneic transplantation. The median number of CD34+ cells in apheresis products was 0.45% and 2.2x10(6)/kg recipient bw per single apheresis. A total of 5.4x10(6)/kg CD34+ cells were collected with two (range: one to three) LVA. In the analysis of donor subgroups, higher peripheral blood (PB) and apheresis results were obtained in male vs female donors; however, donor weight significantly differed in both groups. Heavier donors displayed higher PB and apheresis CD34+ counts; however, when CD34+ cells/kg were adjusted to a constant bw, similar harvest results were calculated in males and females, demonstrating that gender per se does not, whereas bw does affect apheresis results. Younger donors had significantly higher PB CD34+ counts, higher CD34+ numbers per single apheresis, increased CFU, more T, B, and CD61+, comparable NK, and less CD14+ cells. A correlation analysis of donor age and apheresis results displayed an age-related decline of 0.46x10(6)/kg CD34 cells per decade of donor aging. Cell subsets in apheresis products were CD14 (49%), CD3 (22%), CD4 (13%), CD8 (7%), CD61 (20%), CD19 (5%), and CD16/56+ (3%) cells, with increasing CD14+ cells and decreasing CD3, CD4, CD8, CD61, CD19, and CD16/56+ cells on subsequent days of apheresis. Compared to our previous analysis using high- (2x12 microg) and low-dose (1x10 microg) rhG-CSF for allogeneic PBPC mobilization, the intermediate-dose showed a similar CD34+ mobilization potential to 1x10 microg rhG-CSF; however, with use of LVA, two instead of three (p<0.05) aphereses were\n\nThe potential of mipomersen, an ApoB synthesis inhibitor, to reduce necessity for LDL-apheresis in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nVogt, Anja; Parhofer, Klaus G\n\n2013-04-01\n\nLDL-apheresis is a treatment option for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) with country-specific thresholds for LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) for initiation. Apheresis also reduces lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and may be used to lower Lp(a) in high-risk patients. Mipomersen, an apolipoproteinB-synthesis-inhibitor, reduces LDL-C and Lp(a). We hypothesized that mipomersen may prevent the necessity for apheresis by reducing the both below thresholds. Data from a study in 123 patients with heterozygous FH and coronary artery disease on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy were used to evaluate in what percentage adding mipomersen resulted in lipid-levels below apheresis-thresholds. Different thresholds were tested: LDL-C â¥ 2.59 mmol/l, â¥ 3.36 mmol/l, â¥ 4.14 mmol/l, Lp(a) â¥ 60 mg/dl. Mipomersen decreased LDL-C by 28% (baseline 153 mg/dl), Lp(a) by 21% (baseline 45 mg/dl) (placebo no effect). Mipomersen reduced the percentage of patients with LDL-C â¥ 4.14 mmol/l from 39 to 2%, with LDL â¥ 3.36 mmol/l from 62 to 16%, with LDL â¥ 2.59 mmol/l from 98 to 54%, and with Lp(a) â¥ 60 mg/dl from 39 to 23%. When added to maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy, mipomersen may reduce the necessity for apheresis in many of these patients. In Germany, the threshold for apheresis for LDL typically is 2.59 mmol/l, for Lp(a) 60 mg/dl. Almost 50% of the patients could avoid apheresis with the addition of mipomersen. Further studies are warranted to evaluate whether patients who qualify for apheresis could be adequately controlled with mipomersen.\n\nLymphocyte apheresis for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell manufacturing in children and young adults with leukemia and neuroblastoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nCeppi, Francesco; Rivers, Julie; Annesley, Colleen; Pinto, Navin; Park, Julie R; Lindgren, Catherine; Mgebroff, Stephanie; Linn, Naomi; Delaney, Meghan; Gardner, Rebecca A\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe first step in the production of chimeric antigen receptor T cells is the collection of autologous T cells using apheresis technology. The procedure is technically challenging, because patients often have low leukocyte counts and are heavily pretreated with multiple lines of chemotherapy, marrow transplantation, and/or radiotherapy. Here, we report our experience of collecting T lymphocytes for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell manufacturing in pediatric and young adult patients with leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or neuroblastoma. Apheresis procedures were performed on a COBE Spectra machine using the mononuclear cell program, with a collection target of 1 Ã 10 9 total mononuclear cells per kilogram. Data were collected regarding preapheresis and postapheresis blood counts, apheresis parameters, products, and adverse events. Ninety-nine patients (ages 1.3-25.7 years) and 102 apheresis events were available for analysis. Patients underwent apheresis at a variety of absolute lymphocyte cell counts, with a median absolute lymphocyte count of 944 cells/Î¼L (range, 142-6944 cells/Î¼L). Twenty-two patients (21.6%) had absolute lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells/Î¼L. The mononuclear cell target was obtained in 100% of all apheresis harvests, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell production was possible from the majority of collections (94%). Mononuclear cell collection efficiency was 65.4%, and T-lymphocyte collection efficiency was 83.4%. Ten patients (9.8%) presented with minor adverse events during the 102 apheresis procedures, with one exception of a severe allergy. Mononuclear cell apheresis for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy is well tolerated and safe, and it is possible to obtain an adequate quantity of CD3+ lymphocytes for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell manufacturing in heavily pretreated patients who have low lymphocyte counts.

In women with genetic forms of hypertriglyceridemia, pregnancy may cause extremely elevated TG levels leading to potentially life-threatening pancreatitis attacks and chylomicronemia syndrome. The only safe medical treatment option during pregnancy is Ï-3 fatty acids, which have moderate TG lowering effects. Therapeutic apheresis could be used as primary treatment approach during pregnancy. We reported the effect of double filtration apheresis in one pregnant women with severe hypertriglyceridemia, therapeutic plasmapheresis and double filtration methods in the other severe hypertriglyceridemic pregnant woman; a 32-year-old pregnant woman (patient 1) with a history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis during pregnancy and a 30-year-old pregnant woman with extremely high TG levels (12,000Â mg/dl) leading to chylomicronemia syndrome (patient 2). Medical nutrition therapy and Ï-3 fatty acids were also provided. Double filtration apheresis (patient 1) and plasmapheresisÂ +Â double filtration apheresis (patient 2) were used. When we calculated the TG levels before and after therapeutic apheresis, maximum decrease achieved with double filtration apheresis was 46.3Â % for patient 1 and 37.3Â % for patient 2. However, with plasmapheresis TG level declined by 72Â % in patient 2. Plasmapheresis seemed to be more efficient to decrease TG levels. Iron deficiency anemia was the main complication apart from technical difficulties by lipemic obstruction of tubing system. Healthy babies were born. Delivery led to decreases in TG levels. It is concluded that during pregnancy therapeutic apheresis is an effective method to decrease extremely high TG levels and risks of its potentially life-threatening complications.\n\nWorld apheresis registry report.\n\nPubMed\n\nStegmayr, Bernd; Ptak, Jan; WikstrÃ¶m, BjÃ¶rn\n\n2007-02-01\n\nThe establishment of national apheresis registries has been helpful to learn about therapeutic profiles and adverse event incidences. During 2003, the World Apheresis Registry was established and centers from all countries were invited to participate to register their apheresis activities (at www.iml.umu.se/medicin). In this paper, we will report and analyze the first data retrieved from three centers, in 2 European countries, that registered a total of 388 therapeutic apheresis treatments in 122 patients, 95% due to acute indications. Statistical analyses were performed using an independent Student t-test and Fisher's test. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Fifty percent of the treated patients were women. The mean age of the patients was 51 years (+/-17, range 16-84) and there was no difference between genders (w 50.4, m 51.6 years). Diagnoses for treatment were mainly neurological and vasculitis. In 63% peripheral access was used with a central double lumen catheter, 22% in the jugular vein, 8% in the subclavian vein and 6% the femoral vein. Significant inter-center differences were seen in regard to the access used. The main technique used was centrifugation for conventional plasma exchange (86%), while other modes were leukapheresis, erythrapheresis, platelet apheresis, LDL-apheresis and adsorption of antibodies. Citrate was the only anticoagulant in 92%. During plasma exchange procedures using centrifugation, replacement was by albumin only (58%) or plasma, the latter often in combination with albumin (42%). Adverse events (AEs) were noted in 11% of the procedures. Patients with hypocalcaemia side effects with tingling sensations were included in those data as mild AE and as moderate AEs if they received calcium (Ca) medication. No patient died due to adverse effects. A mild AE was present in 1.8% and moderate in 8.5%. During two procedures (0.5%), the AE was considered severe and therefore the procedure was interrupted.

We analysed the salient apheresis features of a group of 175 allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplants conducted in two institutions in a 7-year period. The grafts were conducted using the \"Mexican\" non-myelo ablative conditioning regimen employing oral busulphan, i.v. cyclophosphamide and i.v. fludarabine. In all instances, the apheresis machine employed was the Baxter CS3000 Plus and donors were mobilised with filgrastim. The apheresis procedures were performed on days 0, +1 and +2, the end-point of collection being 5,000 mL of blood/m2 in each procedure. Three apheresis sessions were planned but the number was adjusted according to the cell yield. The final number of allografted CD34 cells ranged between 0.5 and 25.4 x 10(6)/Kg of the recipient's body weight (median, 5.2 x 10(6)/Kg). One to three apheresis procedures were needed to obtain a product containing more than 0.5 x 10(6) CD34 cells/Kg of the recipient, the median being two procedures; in 72 cases (41%) a single apheresis procedure was sufficient to obtain the target number of CD34 cells. The volumes of apheresis ranged between 50 and 600 mL (median, 400 mL). Since the median cost of each apheresis procedure is 900 USD, the fact that two apheresis procedures was spared in 72 cases and one apheresis was spared in another 65 cases, led to a total saving of approximately 188,100 USD. It can be concluded that, in many cases, allogeneic transplants can be completed with a single apheresis session and that there are considerable financial benefits from this practice.\n\n[Use of adsorption methods for plasma component apheresis].\n\nPubMed\n\nBang, B; Heegaard, N H\n\n1991-11-25\n\nPlasma-apheresis is a nonspecific and wasteful intervention requiring the use of potentially infectious and expensive replacement fluids. Selective removal of the unwanted plasma component circumvents most of the problems. For selective binding and removal of plasma components adsorption methods based on the principles of affinity chromatography have been useful. The ideal adsorption column still does not exist, but the number of clinical applications is increasing. The results vary, but the treatment has been used with success in hypercholesterolemia, and in patients with hemophilia with antifactor antibodies and patients with antibodies directed towards HLA-antigens awaiting renal transplantation. In conclusion selective plasma component-apheresis is an improvement in some diseases as compared to conventional plasma-apheresis. The technique is still being improved but large clinical trials examining the effects of plasma-component-apheresis have not yet been published.\n\nLow-density lipoprotein receptor-negative compound heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia: Two lifetime journeys of lipid-lowering therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nYahya, Reyhana; Mulder, Monique T; Sijbrands, Eric J G; Williams, Monique; Roeters van Lennep, Jeanine E\n\nWe present the case history of 2 patients with low-density lipoprotein receptor-negative compound heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia who did not receive lipoprotein apheresis. We describe the subsequent effect of all lipid-lowering medications during their life course including resins, statins, ezetimibe, nicotinic acid/laropiprant, mipomersen, and lomitapide. These cases tell the story of siblings affected with this rare disease, who are free of symptoms but still are at a very high cardiovascular disease risk, and their treatment from childhood.

Both coagulation and lipid metabolism are strongly associated with cardiovascular events. Lowering very-low- and low-density lipoprotein ((V)LDL) particles via dextran sulphate LDL apheresis also removes coagulation proteins. It remains unknown, however, how coagulation proteins are removed in apheresis. We hypothesize that plasma EVs that contain high levels of coagulation proteins are concomitantly removed with (V)LDL particles by dextran sulphate apheresis. For this, we precipitated (V)LDL particles from human plasma with dextran sulphate and analyzed the abundance of coagulation proteins and EVs in the precipitate. Coagulation pathway proteins, as demonstrated by proteomics and a bead-based immunoassay, were over-represented in the (V)LDL precipitate. In this precipitate, both bilayer EVs and monolayer (V)LDL particles were observed by electron microscopy. Separation of EVs from (V)LDL particles using density gradient centrifugation revealed that almost all coagulation proteins were present in the EVs and not in the (V)LDL particles. These EVs also showed a strong procoagulant activity. Our study suggests that dextran sulphate used in LDL apheresis may remove procoagulant EVs concomitantly with (V)LDL particles, leading to a loss of coagulation proteins from the blood.\n\nFrom bloodletting to apheresis in Japan.\n\nPubMed\n\nMazda, Toshio; Schmidt, Paul J\n\n2010-02-01\n\nThe ancient therapy of bloodletting that was universal in the West traveled to Japan 500 years ago on the trading vessels that carried physicians and barber-surgeons to care for the body and Christian missionaries to care for the soul. Then bloodletting was replaced by blood transfusion in the 19th century, only to return less than 50 years ago as apheresis. An understanding of those transitions can be gained from the story of the introduction of Western medicine to Japan and the events that have led to the practice of apheresis there today.

However, little is known about the potential pleiotropic effects of LA, particularly regarding the immune system and its regulation. Thus, in an attempt to analyse the potential effects of dyslipidemia and LA on the regulation of CD4 + T cells activation and lineage differentiation, we compared the CD4 + T cells cytokines secretion profiles of dyslipidemic patients before and after LA with the profiles observed in healthy donors. CD4 + T cells were isolated from 5 LA patients and 5 healthy donors and activated with anti-CD3 or anti-CD3Â +Â anti-CD46 antibodies. The supernatants were collected after 36Â h incubation and levels of secreted cytokines analysed by flow cytometry. Our results revealed a deep remodelling of CD4 + T cells cytokines secretion patterns in dyslipidemic patients compared to healthy donors, as reflected by a 15 times higher IFN-Î³ secretion rate after CD3Â +Â CD46 co-activation in dyslipidemic patients after LA compared to healthy subjects and 8 times higher after CD3 activation alone (pÂ =Â 0.0187 and pÂ =Â 0.0118 respectively). Moreover, we demonstrated that LA itself also modifies the phenotype and activation pattern of CD4 + T-cells in dyslipidemic patients. These observations could be of fundamental importance in the improvement of LA columns/systems engineering and in developing new therapeutic approaches regarding dyslipidemia and associated pathologies such as atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes.

It was suggested that granulocyte and monocyte adsorption apheresis might play an important role for ulcerative colitis. Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed. Medline and the Cochrane controlled trials register were used to identify randomized controlled trials comparing granulocyte and monocyte adsorption apheresis with corticosteroids, and comparing intensive with conventional apheresis in patients with ulcerative colitis. Nine randomized trials were eligible for inclusion criteria. According to pooled data, granulocyte and monocyte adsorption apheresis is effective for inducing clinical remission in patients with ulcerative colitis compared with corticosteroids (odds ratio, 2.23; 95% confidence interval: 1.38-3.60). However, the efficacy of granulocyte and monocyte adsorption apheresis was not dependent on the number of apheresis sessions. The intensive apheresis (â¥2 sessions per week) is more effective for inducing clinical remission than weekly apheresis (odds ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval: 1.12-3.93). The rate of adverse events by apheresis was significantly lower than that by corticosteroids (odds ratio, 0.24; 95% confidence interval: 0.15-0.37). Our meta-analysis reveals that intensive granulocyte and monocyte adsorption apheresis is a safe and effective treatment with higher rates of clinical remission and response for ulcerative colitis compared with corticosteroids.

Eleven patients, aged 55 Â± 9.3 years (mean Â± SD), were enrolled in the study. PTX3 soluble protein levels in plasma were unchanged by 2 sessions of LA; however, a downregulation of mRNA expression for PTX3 was observed, starting with the first session of LA (p < 0.001). The observed reduction was progressively increased in the interval between the first and second LA sessions to achieve a maximum decrease by the end of the second session. A statistically significantly greater treatment-effect correlation was observed in patients undergoing weekly treatments, compared with those undergoing treatment every 15 days. A progressive reduction in plasma levels of C-reactive protein was also seen from the first session of LA, with a statistically significant linear correlation for treatment-effect in the change in plasma levels of this established inflammatory marker (R 2 = 0.99; p < 0.001). Our findings suggest that LA has anti-inflammatory and endothelium protective effects beyond its well-established efficacy in lowering apoB100-containing lipoproteins.

We evaluated the relationship of the plateletpheresis device with bacterial contamination and reported septic transfusion reactions. Plateletpheresis was performed using Amicus (Fenwal, a Fresenius Kabi Company) or Trima (Trima Accel, TerumoBCT) from 2010 to 2014. All donations used inlet-line sample diversion and were tested by quality control (QC; Day 1) aerobic culture. Rates of bacterial contamination and septic reactions to PLTs were calculated for both devices. During the 5-year study period, plateletpheresis collections using Amicus and Trima devices totaled 1,486,888 and 671,955 donations, respectively. The rate of confirmed-positive bacterial cultures of apheresis PLT donations was significantly higher with Amicus than with Trima (252 vs. 112 per 10 6 donations [odds ratio {OR}, 2.3; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.8-2.9]). Septic transfusion reactions were caused by 30 apheresis PLT units from 25 contaminated Amicus procedures and three apheresis PLT units from three contaminated Trima procedures. The overall rate of septic reactions was significantly higher with apheresis PLT components collected with Amicus than with Trima (16.8 vs. 4.5 per 10 6 donations [OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.1-12.5]). All apheresis PLT components implicated in septic transfusion reactions had negative QC culture results incubated through Day 5 (i.e., false negatives). Apheresis technology affects bacterial contamination of plateletpheresis collections. The device-specific, higher rate of confirmed-positive bacterial culture results also correlated with a significantly higher rate of reported septic transfusion reactions to apheresis PLTs.

The interest in this is obvious, in terms of knowledge of the practice of apheresis, adverse events, and technical issues. However, because of the weight of data entry it could never be exhaustive and some data will be missing. While continuing our registry efforts and our efforts to match with other existing registries, we decided to extend the data collection to a medico-economic database that is available in France, the Programme de MÃ©dicalisation du SystÃ¨me d'Information (PMSI) that has covered reimbursement information for each public or private hospital since 2007. It contains almost all apheresis procedures in all apheresis fields, demographic patient data, and primary and related diagnoses, among other data. Although this data does not include technical apheresis issues or other complications of the procedures, its interest is great and it is complementary to the registry. From 2003-2014, we have recorded 250,585 apheresis procedures, for 48,428 patients. We showed that the data are reliable and exhaustive. The information shows a perfect real life practice in apheresis, regarding indications, the rhythm and the duration of apheresis treatment. This prospective data collection is sustainable and allows us to assess the impact of healthcare guidelines. Our objective is to extend the data collection and match it to other existing databases; this will allow us to conduct, for example, a cohort study specifically for ECP.

A bloodmobile was outfitted in the United States as a four-bed apheresis unit with capabilities including pathogen reduction, electronic blood establishment computer system, designated areas for donor counseling and laboratory testing, and onboard electrical power generation. After air transport to Liberia, the bloodmobile was positioned at ELWA Hospital, Monrovia, and connected to the hospital's power grid. Liberian staff were trained to conduct donor screening, which included questionnaire and onsite blood typing and transfusion transmitted infection (TTI) testing, and plasma collection and processing. The bloodmobile was operational within 3 weeks after arrival of the advance team. Of 101 donors who passed the pre-screening questionnaire, 32 were deferred. Twenty-eight of ninty-nine tested survivors were deferred for positive transfusion transmitted infection (TTI) tests; twenty-one were positive for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus. The majority of donors had type O blood; all but one were Rh positive. Forty-three survivors donated at least once; eighty-nine apheresis attempts resulted in eighty-one successful collections. Apheresis capability was emergently established in Liberia to support an efficacy trial of Ebola Convalescent Plasma. Extensive cooperation among multinational team members, engineers, logisticians, and blood safety technical personnel at the operational site was required to surmount challenges to execution posed by logistical factors. The high proportion of positive TTI tests supported the use of a pathogen reduction system to enhance product safety. J. Clin. Apheresis 32:175-181, 2017. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We determined MP subgroups from resting platelets, activated platelets and endothelial cells in donors and apheresis platelet concentrates (PC). MP were double stained with annexin V and CD61 (platelet-derived MP; PMP), P-selectin or CD63 (MP from activated platelets) and CD144 plus E-selectin (endothelial cell-derived MP; EMP) and detected by flow cytometry in platelet donors (n=36) and apheresis PC (n=11; Trimaâ¢). PC contained MP, mainly from resting platelets [93% (90-95)], and minor fractions of PMP from activated platelets [P-selectin(+) or CD63(+); 4Â·8% (3Â·2-7Â·7) and 2Â·6% (2Â·0-4Â·0)]. Compared to donors, levels of annexin V+ MP, PMP, P-selectin(+) and CD63(+) MP were 1Â·7-, 2Â·3-, 8Â·6- and 3Â·1-fold higher in PC (all P<0Â·05). During storage (1-5 days), levels of annexin V+ MP and PMP did not increase, although small increases in the fraction of P-selectin(+) or CD63(+) MP occurred (both P<0Â·05). PC also contained EMP, which were 2Â·6- to 3Â·7-fold enriched in PC compared to donors (P<0Â·05). Transfusion of apheresis PC also results in transfusion of HLA-carrying PMP and EMP. This might counteract the aim of reducing transfused HLA load by leucodepletion. The increases in PMP exposing P-selectin or CD63 reflect mild platelet activation during storage. We conclude that in leucodepleted platelet apheresis using fluidized particle bed technology, MP are harvested mainly from the donor by apheresis. Improvement in apheresis technology might reduce MP load. Â© 2010 The Author(s).

Soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) is an antiangiogenic protein believed to mediate the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia. We conducted an open pilot study to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of therapeutic apheresis with a plasma-specific dextran sulfate column to remove circulating sFlt-1 in 11 pregnant women (20-38 years of age) with very preterm preeclampsia (23-32 weeks of gestation, systolic BP â¥140 mmHg or diastolic BP â¥90 mmHg, new onset protein/creatinine ratio >0.30 g/g, and sFlt-1/placental growth factor ratio >85). We evaluated the extent of sFlt-1 removal, proteinuria reduction, pregnancy continuation, and neonatal and fetal safety of apheresis after one (n=6), two (n=4), or three (n=1) apheresis treatments. Mean sFlt-1 levels were reduced by 18% (range 7%-28%) with concomitant reductions of 44% in protein/creatinine ratios. Pregnancy continued for 8 days (range 2-11) and 15 days (range 11-21) in women treated once and multiple times, respectively, compared with 3 days (range 0-14) in untreated contemporaneous preeclampsia controls (n=22). Transient maternal BP reduction during apheresis was managed by withholding pre-apheresis antihypertensive therapy, saline prehydration, and reducing blood flow through the apheresis column. Compared with infants born prematurely to untreated women with and without preeclampsia (n=22 per group), no adverse effects of apheresis were observed. In conclusion, therapeutic apheresis reduced circulating sFlt-1 and proteinuria in women with very preterm preeclampsia and appeared to prolong pregnancy without major adverse maternal or fetal consequences. A controlled trial is warranted to confirm these findings.

It is used to increase the blood donor pool when blood group-compatible donors cannot be recruited for a patient because of a major ABO incompatibility or incompatible red blood cell antibodies in the recipient. Because granulocytes have little ABO and few other red blood cell antigens on their membrane, such incompatibility lies mostly with the contaminating red blood cells.

Removal of abnormal blood elements may succeed when all else fails.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcLeod, B C\n\n1991-05-01\n\nTherapeutic apheresis is a generic term that refers to removal of abnormal blood cells and plasma constituents. The terms \"plasmapheresis,\" \"leukapheresis,\" and \"erythrocytapheresis\" describe the specific blood element that is removed. Apheresis therapies can be performed in the ICU to manage a number of neurologic, hematologic, and autoimmune disorders, including myasthenia gravis, Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, sickle-cell disease, and Goodpasture's syndrome. Apheresis procedures generally require two points of contact with the circulation--one for blood withdrawal and one for return; the withdrawal site should sustain a flow rate of at least 50 mL/min. Although apheresis is generally quite safe, hemodynamic instability, hypocalcemia, and dilutional coagulopathy can occur.\n\nBlood banking and transfusion medicine for the apheresis medicine practitioner.\n\nPubMed\n\nJeffus, Susanne; Wehrli, Gay\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis article provides a concise overview of blood banking and transfusion medicine (BBTM) for the therapeutic apheresis medicine practitioner. It addresses the complete pathway from blood donor qualification to blood collection, to processing and storing blood components, to patient testing, to ordering blood components for therapeutic apheresis (TA) procedures, to preparing the component for transfusion, and finally to transfusion. The nurses, technologists, and physicians orchestrate these activities in concert to best serve patients undergoing TA procedures. Enhancing knowledge of these processes may improve the quality of patient care and the utilization of blood products.

A \"white-cloud\" physician is one who usually gets fewer cases. A \"black-cloud\" is one who often has more cases. It is unclear if the designation is only superstitious or if there is some merit. Our aim is to objectively assess this phenomenon in apheresis medicine at our center. A one-year prospective study from 12/2014 to 11/2015 was designed to evaluate the number of times apheresis physicians and nurses were involved with emergent apheresis procedures between the hours from 10 PM and 7 AM. Other parameters collected include the names of the physician, apheresis nurse, type of emergent apheresis procedure, day of the week, and season of the year. During the study period, 32 emergent procedures (or \"black-cloud\" events) occurred. The median time between two consecutive events was 8 days (range: 1-34 days). We found no statistically significant association between the \"black-cloud\" events and attending physicians, nurses, day of the week, or season of the year by Chi-square and Fisher's analyses. However, exploratory analysis using association rule demonstrated that \"black-cloud\" events were more likely to happen on Thursday (2.19 times), with attending physician 2 (1.18 times), and during winter (1.15 times). The results of this pilot study may support the common perception that some physicians or nurses are either \"black cloud\" or \"white cloud\". A larger, multi-center study population is needed to validate the results of this pilot study.

The purpose of the symposium was multifaceted, and included the following aims: (a) To discuss this state of research and key scientific questions in apheresis medicine; (b) To identify gaps in knowledge for relevant cardiovascular diseases, hematological and oncological diseases, infectious diseases and sepsis, renal diseases, and neurological diseases where there may be strong therapeutic rationale for the application of apheresis treatments; (c) To explore ways of coordinating therapeutic apheresis with other medical disciplines and treatment modalities; (d) To identify and prioritize the most important research questions to be answered in apheresis medicine; and (e) To offer NHLBI suggestions on how a structured research approach can be applied to the therapeutic apheresis research agenda in future years. The following document summarizes three such key proposals presented at the meeting for evaluating apheresis therapy for the treatment of pain in sickle cell disease, heparin induced thrombocytopenia, and leukostasis from acute myeloid leukemia. The challenges and limitations regarding apheresis therapy for each disease are discussed, and avenues for future investigation for each disease are outlined.

Apheresis teaching has inherited a strong clinical context where real patient problems are used in a hands-on environment. To optimize instruction, those involved in the education of apheresis professionals need to have (1) knowledge of how clinical laboratory medicine education has developed as a field, (2) an understanding of what is known from theory and research about how people learn, and (3) the skills to design teaching/learning activities in ways consistent with literature-based principles of adult education. These developments in education provide a context for curriculum projects currently underway by the American Society for Apheresis. Teachers must determine which competencies are central to the essence of a trained professional. Specific, robust, learning objectives targeted toward the development of higher levels of thinking, professional attitudes, and requisite skills are formulated to guide the learner toward mastering those competencies. Curriculum is developed for each objective, consisting of content and the best teaching/learning methods to help learners attain the objective. Appropriate assessment strategies are identified to determine whether the objective is being achieved. The integration of objectives, curriculum, and assessment creates The Bermuda Triangle of Education (Richter, The Circle of Learning and Bermuda Triangle in Education, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, 2004). When educators do not effectively navigate The Bermuda Triangle of Education, learning may disappear into the murky depths of confusion and apathy. When successfully navigated, the result will be a significant learning experience that leads to transformation through education. 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.\n\nTherapeutic plasma exchange performed in tandem with hemodialysis without supplemental calcium in the apheresis circuit.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhao, Yong; Ibrahim, Hiba; Bailey, Jeffrey A; Linden, Jeanne; Hickson, Elda; Haynes, Stefanie; Greene, Mindy; Vauthrin, Michelle; Weinstein, Robert\n\n2017-06-01\n\nTherapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and hemopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) collection are apheresis procedures that can safely be performed in tandem with hemodialysis. Despite the return of citrate-anticoagulated blood to the patient during HPC collection, it is not necessary to administer supplemental calcium during these procedures because the ionized calcium concentration is restored as the returning blood passes through the dialyzer. It is not known whether this applies to TPE, in which a mixture of blood and pharmaceutical albumin, an avid binder of plasma ionized calcium, is returned to the patient through the dialyzer. We report on three dialysis-dependent patients who required TPE and underwent tandem treatments without supplemental calcium in the apheresis circuit. Overall, ionized calcium fell 4-12% (Pâ=â0.0.024) and patients reported no symptoms of hypocalcemic toxicity. Tandem hemodialysis/TPE can be performed without supplemental calcium in the apheresis circuit. J. Clin. Apheresis 32:154-157, 2017. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Recently, miRNAs have been discussed as markers of vascular status including atherosclerosis. MiRNAs inhibit post-transcriptional processes through RNA duplex formation resulting in gene silencing or regulation of gene expression. We measured a profile of 175 plasma-circulating miRNAs using pre-defined Serum/Plasma Focus Human microRNA PCR Panels in pooled samples of 11 subjects with familial hypercholesterolaemia under long-term apheresis treatment. Subsequently we analysed expressions of ten pre-selected miRNAs potentially involved in lipid homeostasis in the same group of subjects. We compared plasma-circulating miRNA levels isolated from peripheral blood collected immediately before and after apheresis. The greatest differences in plasma levels were found in miR-451a, miR-16, miR-19a/b, miR-223 and miR-185. In subsequent individual miRNA assay we detected a significant increase in miR-33b levels after apheresis (PÂ <Â 0.05). Additionally, correlations between plasma lipids and miR-33a (PÂ <Â 0.04) and miR-122 (PÂ <Â 0.01) have been determined. Moreover, miR-122 levels in LDLR homozygotes were higher compared to heterozygotes after, but not before, apheresis treatment (PÂ <Â 0.04). LDL/Lp(a) apheresis has an impact on miRNAs associated with lipid homeostasis and vascular status. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Aim To assess effectiveness of granulocyte-monocyte apheresis in patients with steroid-dependent, azathioprine-intolerant/resistant moderate ulcerative colitis. Methods Consecutive patients fulfilling inclusion criteria were prospectively enrolled, treated by apheresis, and followed up for 12 months. The primary end point of the study was steroid-free clinical remission at 12 months, with no need for biologic therapy or surgery. Results From January to December 2013, 33 patients were enrolled. After one year of follow-up, 12 (36%) patients had clinical remission, were steroid-free, and had no need for biological therapy or surgery; 3 (9%) cases showed a clinical response (but not clinical remission). Moreover, 12 (36%) patients required biologic therapy, 4 (12%) underwent colectomy, and in the other 2 (6%) a reduction, but not withdrawal, of steroid dose was achieved. Conclusions Our study shows that a standard course of granulocyte-monocyte apheresis is associated with a 36% steroid-free clinical remission in patients with steroid-dependent, azathioprine-intolerant or resistant moderate ulcerative colitis. Apheresis might represent an alternative to biologic therapy or surgery in this specific subgroup of patients. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrial.gov NCT03189888.

Smit\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBACKGROUND Few African countries separate blood donations into components; however, demand for platelets (PLTs) is increasing as regional capacity to treat causes of thrombocytopenia, including chemotherapy, increases. Namibia introduced single-donor apheresis PLT collections in 2007 to increase PLT availability while reducing exposure to multiple donors via pooling. This study describes the impact this transition had on PLT availability and safety in Namibia. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Annual national blood collections and PLT units issued data were extracted from a database maintained by the Blood Transfusion Service of Namibia (NAMBTS). Production costs and unit prices were analyzed. RESULTS In 2006, NAMBTS issued 771 single and pooled PLT doses from 3054 whole blood (WB) donations (drawn from 18,422 WB donations). In 2007, NAMBTS issued 486 single and pooled PLT doses from 1477 WB donations (drawn from 18,309 WB donations) and 131 single-donor PLT doses. By 2011, NAMBTS issued 837 single-donor PLT doses per year, 99.1% of all PLT units. Of 5761 WB donations from which PLTs were made in 2006 to 2011, a total of 20 (0.35%) were from donors with confirmed test results for human immunodeficiency virus or other transfusion-transmissible infections (TTIs). Of 2315 single-donor apheresis donations between 2007 and 2011, none of the 663 donors had a confirmed positive result for any pathogen. As apheresis replaced WB-derived PLTs, apheresis production costs dropped by a mean of 8.2% per year, while pooled PLT costs increased by an annual mean of 21.5%. Unit prices paid for apheresis- and WB-derived PLTs increased by 9 and 7.4% per year on average, respectively. CONCLUSION Namibiaâs PLT transition shows that collections from repeat apheresis donors can reduce TTI risk and production costs.

In medically refractory cases, or where medical therapy is contraindicated, thyroidectomy may be required. To decrease perioperative thyroid storm and to reduce overall surgical risk, apheresis may be considered preoperatively to restore euthyroidism. We report a 46-year-old female with a history of cardiac arrhythmia and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy for which she received amiodarone. Months after discontinuation of amiodarone, the patient presented with wide complex tachycardia and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. Laboratory testing confirmed severe thyrotoxicosis which was subsequently refractory to medical therapy. Total thyroidectomy was required. Following a total of 10 apheresis treatments, thyroid hormone levels were reduced to near normal levels and the patient's symptoms improved. Thyroidectomy was performed without intraoperative or postoperative complication. In the setting of life-threatening, medically refractory amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis, therapeutic apheresis can effectively reduce thyroid hormone levels and restore a state of clinical and biochemical euthyroidism.

We have previously described selective plasma exchange therapy using a hemofilter permeable to substances that have a molecular mass of up to 100âkDa. The proof-of-concept studies and a Phase I study in patients with decompensated cirrhosis demonstrated that hemofiltration using an albumin-leaking membrane is safe and effective in removing target molecules, alleviating severe encephalopathy and improving blood chemistry. In this study a novel large-pore filter for similar clinical application is described. The performance of the filter was studied in vitro; it was found to effectively remove a wide spectrum of pathogenic factors implicated in the pathophysiology of hepatic failure, including protein bound toxins and defective forms of circulating albumin. Data on mass transport characteristics and functionality using various modes of filtration and dialysis provide rationale for clinical evaluation of the filter for artificial liver support using albumin apheresis.

We retrospectively investigated a total of 267 apheresis procedures from 1990 to 2013 on 93 children between 0 and 10 years old, including 89 patients and 4 healthy donors, with body weights of 6.3 to 44.0âkg. The median CD34+ cell yield per apheresis procedure was 2.3âÃâ10 6 CD34+ cells/kg (0.2-77.9âÃâ10 6 CD34+ cells/kg). Adverse events occurred in 11.6% of procedures (nâ=â31), including mild perivascular pain (nâ=â12), emesis (nâ=â9), hypotension (nâ=â3), urticaria (nâ=â2), numbness (nâ=â2), chest pain (nâ=â1), facial flush (nâ=â1), and abdominal pain (nâ=â1). Among hypotensive events, shock in a 9.6âkg one-year-old boy required emergency treatment in 1996. Thereafter, we adopted continuous injection of calcium gluconate, ionized calcium monitoring, central venous catheter access and circuit priming with albumin in addition to concentrated red cells. Since then we have had fewer complications: 16.4% per apheresis during 1990-1997 versus 5.8% during 1998-2013. No healthy pediatric donors suffered from any late-onset complications related to apheresis or G-CSF administration. By employing appropriate measures, peripheral blood stem cell apheresis for small children can have an improved safety profile, even for children weighing <10âkg. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we investigated the effectiveness of an alternative strategy: optimizing donor scheduling, prior to recruitment, at a hospital-based blood donor center. Analysis of collections, during the 89 consecutive months since opening of donor center, was performed. Linear regression and segmented time-series analyses were performed to calculate growth rates of collections and to test for statistical differences, respectively. Pre-intervention donor scheduling capacity was 39/month. In the absence of active donor recruitment, during the first 29 months, the number of collections rose gradually to 24/month (growth-rate of 0.70/month). However, between month-30 and -55, collections exhibited a plateau at 25.6 Â± 3.0 (growth-rate of -0.09/month) (p<0.0001). This plateau-phase coincided with donor schedule approaching saturation (65.6 Â± 7.6% schedule booked). Scheduling capacity was increased by following two interventions: adding an apheresis instrument (month-56) and adding two more collection days/week (month-72). Consequently, the scheduling capacity increased to 130/month. Post-interventions, apheresis platelet collections between month-56 and -81 exhibited a spontaneous renewed growth at a rate of 0.62/month (p<0.0001), in absence of active donor recruitment. Active donor recruitment in month-82 and -86, when the donor schedule had been optimized to accommodate further growth, resulted in a dramatic but transient surge in collections. Apheresis platelet collections plateau at nearly 2/3rd of the scheduling capacity. Optimizing the scheduling capacity prior to active donor recruitment is an effective strategy to increase platelet collections at a hospital-based donor center.\n\nStrategies to reduce line infections in a small child with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia who cannot yet receive LDL apheresis.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Misan; Barr, Janet; Kribs, Stewart; Filler, Guido\n\n2017-09-01\n\nPatients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia are optimally treated with low-density lipoprotein apheresis. Young patients who do not meet a weight threshold (25âkg) receive regular plasmapheresis. This approach may remove excessive immunoglobulins and vascular access set-up can be challenging. We report the case of a 4âyear-old child who exhibited repeated septic infections (5 in 6 months) and had recurrent access issues before two interventions were implemented: (1) the percutaneous central venous line was modified to two implanted paediatric ports, and (2) the patient started receiving two bags of Octaplasma at the end of each plasmapheresis treatment to account for the excessive loss of immunoglobulins. For the paediatric plasmapheresis access port, a 19-gauge Huber needle had to be used for the arterial port to prevent the collapse of the extension. These two simple changes have left the patient infection-free for 9 months. Â© BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017. All rights reserved.

Several studies have suggested a role for T cell doses in peripheral blood stem cell grafts in RIC HSCT. Because T cell dose is typically not known until after the collection, and apheresis blood volume is easily modifiable, we hypothesized that higher donor apheresis blood volumes would improve transplantation outcomes through an effect on graft composition. Thus, we analyzed the relationships between apheresis volume, graft composition, and transplantation outcomes in 142 consecutive patients undergoing unrelated donor allogeneic RIC HSCT. We found that apheresis volume â¥15 L was associated with a significantly decreased risk of relapse (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], .48; 95% confidence interval [CI], .28 to .84]; Pâ=â.01) and improved relapse-free survival (aHR, .56; 95% CI, .35 to .89; Pâ=â.02) and overall survival (aHR, .55; 95% CI, .34 to .91; Pâ=â.02). A high apheresis volume was not associated with increased rates of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease. These results demonstrate that an apheresis volume of at least 15 L is independently predictive of improved transplantation outcomes after RIC allogeneic HSCT.

We previously demonstrated that GMA was useful for treating neutrophilic dermatoses and associated arthropathy as it adsorbs Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18)-expressing neutrophils to the CA beads by the binding of complement component (iC3b) and CD11b expressed on activated neutrophils. The objective of this study is to further assess the clinical effectiveness of GMA in the treatment of neutrophilic dermatoses and associated arthropathy. The effect of GMA for skin lesions and joint lesions was assessed in 44 and 23 patients, respectively. Mac-1 expression on peripheral neutrophils was measured by flow cytometry. Skin lesions and arthropathy improved in 39 of 44 patients (88.6%) and 22 of 23 (95.6%), respectively. Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) expression on the peripheral neutrophils, 27.1âÂ±â6.66 MFI (mean fluorescence intensity) before treatment, was reduced to 17.9âÂ±â3.02 MFI by GMA (Pâ<â0.05). Clinical effectiveness of GMA for the treatment of intractable neutrophilic dermatoses and associated arthropathy was further confirmed. Â© 2013 The Authors.

To increase the likelihood that a product mix-up would be detected in the transplant center, we developed a simple protocol for extended blood typing and hence, for confirmation of donor/product identity, on a tube segment. Apheresis samples were applied, directly or after erythrocyte enrichment, to commercially available blood typing assays, including lateral flow cards and gel agglutination cards. Without sample modification, low hematocrit and high leukocyte count obviated definitive blood typing. Using the most simple erythrocyte enrichment protocol, that is, centrifugation, reliable blood group analysis became possible with either assay. Other, more cumbersome pre-analytical protocols were also successful but provided no advantage. The preferred method was validated on 100 samples; ABD was correctly identified in 100% of cases. Of the other Rh Ags, all except two 'small e', in both cases in heterozygous individuals, were detected; there were no false positives. A simple, inexpensive point-of-care assay for extended blood typing of apheresis products is available, which can reduce the fatal risk of administering the wrong stem cell product.\n\nRoutine bacterial screening of apheresis platelets on Day 4 using a rapid test: a 4-year single-center experience.\n\nPubMed\n\nDunbar, Nancy M; Kreuter, Justin D; Marx-Wood, Cynthia R; Dumont, Larry J; Szczepiorkowski, Zbigniew M\n\n2013-10-01\n\nThe platelet (PLT) Pan Genera Detection test (PGD) is a rapid bacterial detection system used to screen PLTs for bacterial contamination. We report a single center 46-month experience with secondary screening of apheresis PLTs by PGD testing. Existing testing records of apheresis PLTs screened by PGD from July 2008 to April 2012 were reviewed. All PLT units were initially screened by routine postcollection culture methods. Secondary screening using PGD was performed for indated PLTs on PLT storage Day 4 and for outdated PLTs on Day 8. A total of 8535 apheresis PLTs were available in inventory during the study period. Of these, 5030 (58.9%) were dispensed and transfused before PGD testing and 3505 (41.1%) underwent PGD testing on Day 4. Twenty-five units tested on Day 4 were PGD initial reactive (0.71%). All were confirmed to be false positive by repeat PGD testing in triplicate (n=20) or by confirmatory culture (n=5). An additional 364 units that were PGD nonreactive on Day 4 were approved for transfusion on Day 6 or Day 7 due to urgent clinical need. A total of 371 outdated units underwent repeat PGD testing before discard on Day 8; all were nonreactive. Secondary PGD testing of cult"
