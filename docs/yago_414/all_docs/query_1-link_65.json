The film was nominated for 7 Academy Awards (including Best Picture), with Tarantino being nominated for Best Director and winning for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nHe then collaborated with fellow filmmakers Allison Anders, Alexandre Rockwell, and Robert Rodriguez on the anthology film Four Rooms (1995), with Roth Antonio Banderas, Jennifer Beals, Paul Calderon, Sammi Davis, Valeria Golino, Madonna, David Proval, Ione Skye, Lili Taylor, Marisa Tomei, and Tamlyn Tomita.

Fox, Madsen, Daryl Hannah, David Carradine, Sonny Chiba, Julie Dreyfus, Chiaki Kuriyama, Gordon Liu, and Michael Parks.

He received his 3rd Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay, along with 2nd for Best Director, and first for Best Picture on the period drama Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), with DiCaprio, Pitt, Margot Robbie, Emile Hirsch, Margaret Qualley, Timothy Olyphant, Austin Butler, Dakota Fanning, Dern, and Al Pacino.\n\nTarantino’s films have garnered both critical and commercial success as well as a dedicated cult-following. In addition to his 2 Academy Awards, he has received many industry awards, including 2 BAFTA Awards, 4 Golden Globes and the Palme d’Or. He has also been nominated for an Emmy and 5 Grammys. In 2005, he was included on the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world.
