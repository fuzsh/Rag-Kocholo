        "text": "With the movie industry abuzz about the lack of inclusiveness in movies and, by extension, award shows, people have been citing television as a small screened standard for diversity. Admittedly television has always been far more progressive than cinema--now with hundreds of shows between broadcast, cable, premium channels and streaming services--it has to be. But truthfully even television's not that much better.\n\nSupernatural has always been pretty light in terms of race and quality female and LGBTQIA characters. Having stupidly killed off one of the only female and the only gay recurring character in series history, there has been a gaping hole in both departments since the demie of Charlie Bradbury. As a longtime fan and a black woman, it’s been a constant point of frustration with the show. It’s not about checking boxes or filling quotas, but when a show regularly references saving the world, all of factions of it should be represented.\n\nAfter last week’s devilishly disappointing episode, I had no expectations for “Into The Mystic,\" a monster-of-the-week case about people who die after hearing a primal scream. Fortunately, thoroughly enjoyed this episode! Grab your favorite vinyl, and let’s dive in, shall we?\n\nFrom Cynthia’s martial issues and launch of her eyewear collection to the petty competition for occupancy certificates between Moore Manor and Chateau Sheree, the eighth, and Nene Leakes-lite, season of The Real Housewives Of Atlanta, has yet to disappoint.\n\nNew housewife actress/director/Scout Mommy Kim Fields has been an polarizing and frustrating for addition to the cast. Fans of the show and Fields’ career were taken aback by a Kim's surprisingly homebodied personality. She's a woman who successfully avoided the perils of Hollywood and child stardom when few black women did, but can't bear being away from her husband for more than 12 hours. How does she direct “hundreds of hours of television” and corral petulant, ego-driven actors, but is overwhelmed by the prospect of a day on a boat with accomplished women? Did she even know what she was signing up for?\n\nAs if the wait for tonight’s first new episode of 2016—one that takes us back to the cage where Sam is trapped with Lucifer—wasn’t hard enough, a new “Supernatural” promo that’s positively dripping with angst and blood just dropped.\n\nStars Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki both tweeted a link to a promo shared by Shaving People, Punting Things, and it epically sets up the next half of the season in which Sam, Dean and Castiel each have an enemy to defeat.\n\nIt’s true that you don’t realize how much you love something until it’s gone. With most of m’shows on winter hiatus, I find myself wondering what my favorite characters are doing, and watching old reruns just to hear their voices. It’s a one-sided love affair, but I knew that going in. So now is the perfect time to share my favorite TV characters in no particular order...\n\nJump back to second gear, everyone! The entire cast of Friends is officially and finally reuniting in a two-hour NBC event honoring TV director James Burrows, who recently directed his 1000th episode of television last year (as well as 15 episodes of Friends), TVLine.com reports.\n\nThe special, airing February 21 on NBC, will also include reunions and stars from Burrows other successful shows, including Emmy-magnet Frasier, Will & Grace and Taxi as well as The Big Bang Theory and the recently-canceled Mike & Molly.\n\nWhile the format of the event has yet to be revealed—TVLine.com hints at a SNL 40-style sketch show—I hope it re-visits our favorite Friends nearly 12 years after their iconic series finale. Here’s what I imagine happens to the six BFFs who found love and some success in the Big Apple…\n\nDust off your favorite trucker cap and brush up on your Tori Spelling gossip because Bobby Singer is returning of Supernatural!\n\nActor Jim Beaver will once again reprise his role in this season’s 16th episode as beloved surrogate father to the world’s hottest demon hunters, TVLine.com reports.\n\nWait, there’s more! Bobby’s late BFF Rufus (Steven Williams) is returning too! EP Jeremy Carver told TVLine.com that the upcoming episode will feature the “wonderful relationship between Bobby and Rufus” in flashbacks as Sam and Dean (Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles respectively) re-visit one of Bobby and Rufus’ cold cases.\n\nRufus met his maker in the season 6’s “And Then There Were None.” Fan favorite Bobby died in the season 7’s fantastic “Death’s Door” but has returned several times, most recent being last season’s “Inside Man.”\n\nAll new episodes begin on January 20.\n\nWho else would you like to see return to Supernatural? Sound off below!\n\nPhoto Credits: ohnotheydidnt.livejournal.com\n\nThe 2016 Golden Globes unfortunately handed out more awkward and frustrating moments than trophies during its tediously broadcast on Sunday. Why is Mel Gibson or Quentin Tarantino even allowed at award shows? How come Melissa McCarthy, Andy Samberg or Kevin Hart couldn't tap in for the insanely snooze-worthy Ricky Gervais?\n\nThe silver lining of an overall sub-par awards show is that it made the few and far-between highlights feel nearly meteoric. Here were the best moments..."
