        "text": "This film shouldn’t be called My Best Friend’s Wedding. Julia Roberts and Dermot Mulroney do not play best friends. They play weird ex-fuck-buddies with a safety-net marriage pact that goes wrong. Horribly wrong. They have agreed they would marry if they were still single by the age of 28, but three weeks before that birthday, Michael O’Neal (Mulroney) calls to say he is to be married in just four days to someone else. It never crossed big-haired food critic Julianne Potter’s (Roberts) mind that the man of her dreams might fall for someone like Kimmy Wallace (Cameron Diaz). Kimmy is the opposite of Julianne. She is a 20-year-old, sickly sweet blonde whose daddy owns a baseball team. She’s your worst nightmare, in a twinset and pearls.\n\nAnd so the scene is set for your formulaic 90s romantic comedy: woman loves man, man possibly loves woman, but she has to convince him first. Will they? Won’t they? Normally, they do – of course – and we all go home happy.\n\nJulianne hops on a flight to Chicago in her mom jeans, armed only with a pack of cigarettes, to sabotage the wedding. There’s bad karaoke, an embarrassing gay fake fiance, and a feeling that all will come well in the end. Except … it doesn’t. Michael marries Kimmy and what seemed just a romcom turns into a heartbreaking tale of regret and loss.\n\nThere is one rule in romantic films of this ilk. You play along with the “jeopardy” that ensues in the middle third, when it seems the hero/heroine might not win their love, but you know that romance will win out in the end. Never Been Kissed, 10 Things I Hate About You, Clueless, Notting Hill: they all follow the same formula. And it’s a formula I get along with: it’s comforting. But My Best Friend’s Wedding whips that comfort away like a tablecloth from under a pretty tea set, smashing the china all over the floor.\n\nThe scene I find almost unwatchable takes place the day before the wedding. Julianne and Michael take a boat, just the two of them, along the Chicago river. Their anonymity allows them to look like the in-love couple they should be. They slow dance as he sings “their” song, The Way You Look Tonight, in her ear. Children giggle at their mushy display. And finally we realise that Julianne is not just a saboteur, but that she has loved this man for nine years. The reality that she might lose him becomes a palpable terror. And the film’s crescendo, the one moment where she has the chance to tell the truth, arrives. Michael stares into her eyes, searching, and says: “If you love someone, you say it. Right then … out loud.” We hold our breath, silently begging Julianne to just tell him. She stares back, the words are about to come out, and then ... nothing. The moment passes by and we know that her chance is gone forever.\n\nThe message runs contrary to everything romcoms tell us. It rallies against a thousand teenage fantasies. Maybe, just maybe, loving someone is not enough. Maybe we don’t all get our happy endings. Perhaps love does not conquer all. And perhaps you are simply not The One. As Julianne’s best friend George (Rupert Everett) spells out to her: “Michael’s chasing Kimmy, you’re chasing Michael. But who’s chasing you? No one. Get it?”\n\nSo the film draws to a close. Julianne watches Michael get married, stands in the sidelines as Michael and Kimmy dance to The Way You Look Tonight, and then she goes home. There is no reconciliation, there is no big turnaround. Just a woman in love and alone."
