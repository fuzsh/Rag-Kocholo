        "text": "In 1994, Jennifer Aniston was a 25-year-old actress worried her career was going nowhere. All four of her previous TV shows had been canceled, and her only credited film role to date was as a bratty teen tormented by a diminutive Irish demon in 1993's execrable horror flick Leprechaun.\n\nThen Friends came along. Although she originally auditioned for the part of Monica Gellar, she was cast as Rachel Green, the ditzy but well-intentioned golden girl of the group. The show was a phenomenal success, running for ten seasons and remaining as much of a cultural touchstone today as it was during the 90s (Netflix bought the rights for $500,000 an episode in 2015).\n\nEach of the six Friends characters became hugely famous, but Jennifer Aniston was undeniably the breakout star. She became an aspirational figure for 90s womanhood, from her layered 'Rachel' haircut to her brand of peppy optimism. By the time Friends was winding up in 2004, she was making $1 million an episode and had married Brad Pitt—it's easy to see why women wanted to be her.\n\nShe brought this star persona over into her movie career, choosing a number of Rachel-like roles in romantic comedies. These late 90s movies such as Picture Perfect, She's The One and The Object of My Affection were light and forgettable, but proved Aniston could pull an audience to the big screen.\n\nThe Good Girl, a 2002 indie dramedy, was a leftfield choice for Aniston and remains one of her most memorable roles. Her character, a depressed small-town cashier, subverted Rachel Green's fantasy rise to success, and instead portrayed an angstier and less glamorous version of a woman's quarter-life crisis.\n\nShe returned to mainstream comedies with Bruce Almighty the following year, and went on to rake in box office dollars with Along Came Polly, The Break-Up and Marley & Me, becoming a figurehead of the era's high-concept romcom boom.\n\nRecently, she's mixed in this ultra-commercial fare with unexpected choices like 2014's Cake, in which she underwent a makeunder to play a woman struggling with chronic pain. Unsurprisingly for a woman who made her career on TV work, she's fully on board with the current streaming service boom. Last year, she produced and starred in Dumplin', a Netflix musical comedy; she has two more Netflix original projects on the way.\n\nTo celebrate her 50th birthday on February 11, Newsweek has collected data from critical aggregation websites Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic and IMDb to find the 15 best-received movies of her career to date.\n\n=14.
