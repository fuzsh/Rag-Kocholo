        "text": "Kill Bill turns 20!\n\nEver since Quentin Tarantino broke into the movie scene with Reservoir Dogs in 1992, the term “Tarantinoesque,” both compliment and pejorative, has firmly entrenched itself in the pop culture lexicon. It describes an ego-driven mode of filmmaking, featuring hyper-stylized violence, tough and gamey yet melodious dialogue, disparate storylines that come together in some way (usually via lightly avant-garde editing), and crash zooms. So many crash zooms. They’re all there in the various genres he has paid homage to after trawling them for inspiration: martial arts (Kill Bill), crime (Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown), road action (Death Proof), war (Inglourious Basterds), and western (Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight).\n\nHis latest, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, released to critical, commercial, and awards acclaim. And now we’ve ranked them all of Quentin Tarantino’s movies by Tomatometer! —Alex Vo\n\n#1\n\nPulp Fiction (1994) 92%\n\n#1\n\nAdjusted Score: 106152%\n\nCritics Consensus: Injecting its compendium of crime tales with the patois of everyday conversation, Pulp Fiction is a cinematic shot of adrenaline that cements writer-director Quentin Tarantino as an audacious purveyor of killer kino.\n\nSynopsis: Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are hitmen with a penchant for philosophical discussions. In this... [More]\n\nDirected By: Quentin Tarantino\n\n#2\n\nReservoir Dogs (1992) 90%\n\n#2\n\nAdjusted Score: 97175%\n\nCritics Consensus: Thrumming with intelligence and energy, Reservoir Dogs opens Quentin Tarantino's filmmaking career with hard-hitting style.\n\nSynopsis: A group of thieves assemble to pull of the perfect diamond heist. It turns into a bloody ambush when one... [More]\n\nDirected By: Quentin Tarantino\n\n#3\n\nInglourious Basterds (2009) 89%\n\n#3\n\nAdjusted Score: 103052%\n\nCritics Consensus: A classic Tarantino genre-blending thrill ride, Inglourious Basterds is violent, unrestrained, and thoroughly entertaining.\n\nSynopsis: It is the first year of Germany's occupation of France. Allied officer Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) assembles a team... [More]\n\nDirected By: Quentin Tarantino\n\n#4\n\nDjango Unchained (2012) 87%\n\n#4\n\nAdjusted Score: 101464%\n\nCritics Consensus: Bold, bloody, and stylistically daring, Django Unchained is another incendiary masterpiece from Quentin Tarantino.\n\nSynopsis: Two years before the Civil War, Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave, finds himself accompanying an unorthodox German bounty hunter named... [More]\n\nDirected By: Quentin Tarantino\n\n#5\n\nJackie Brown (1997) 88%\n\n#5\n\nAdjusted Score: 94394%\n\nCritics Consensus: Although somewhat lackadaisical in pace, Jackie Brown proves to be an effective star-vehicle for Pam Grier while offering the usual Tarantino wit and charm.\n\nSynopsis: When flight attendant Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is busted smuggling money for her arms dealer boss, Ordell Robbie (Samuel L.... [More]\n\nDirected By: Quentin Tarantino\n\n#6\n\n#6\n\nAdjusted Score: 117344%\n\nCritics Consensus: Thrillingly unrestrained yet solidly crafted, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood tempers Tarantino's provocative impulses with the clarity of a mature filmmaker's vision.\n\nSynopsis: Actor Rick Dalton gained fame and fortune by starring in a 1950s television Western, but is now struggling to find... [More]\n\nDirected By: Quentin Tarantino\n\n#7\n\nKill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) 85%\n\n#7\n\nAdjusted Score: 93474%\n\nCritics Consensus: Kill Bill is admittedly little more than a stylish revenge thriller -- albeit one that benefits from a wildly inventive surfeit of style.\n\nSynopsis: A former assassin, known simply as The Bride (Uma Thurman), wakes from a coma four years after her jealous ex-lover... [More]\n\nDirected By: Quentin Tarantino\n\n#8\n\nKill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004) 84%\n\n#8\n\nAdjusted Score: 92309%\n\nCritics Consensus: Kill Bill: Volume 2 adds extra plot and dialogue to the action-heavy exploits of its predecessor, while still managing to deliver a suitably hard-hitting sequel.\n\nSynopsis: The Bride (Uma Thurman) picks up where she left off in volume one with her quest to finish the hit... [More]\n\nDirected By: Quentin Tarantino\n\n#9\n\nThe Hateful Eight (2015) 75%\n\n#9\n\nAdjusted Score: 91557%\n\nCritics Consensus: The Hateful Eight offers another well-aimed round from Quentin Tarantino's signature blend of action, humor, and over-the-top violence -- all while demonstrating an even stronger grip on his filmmaking craft.\n\nSynopsis: While racing toward the town of Red Rock in post-Civil War Wyoming, bounty hunter John \"The Hangman\" Ruth (Kurt Russell)... [More]\n\nDirected By: Quentin Tarantino\n\n#10\n\nGrindhouse Presents: Death Proof (2007) 63%\n\n#10\n\nAdjusted Score: 63913%\n\nCritics Consensus: Death Proof may feel somewhat minor in the context of Tarantino's larger filmography, but on its own merits, it packs just enough of a wallop to deliver sufficiently high-octane grindhouse goods.\n\nSynopsis: Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) is a professional body double who likes to take unsuspecting women for deadly drives in his...
