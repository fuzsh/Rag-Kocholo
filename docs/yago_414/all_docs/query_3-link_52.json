Portman plays a ballerina opposite Mila Kunis in the film.\n\nShe even joked about him in her acceptance speech when she won the best actress Golden Globe for her performance in that movie,\n\n“Benjamin choreographed the film, and also you might remember him in the movie as the guy when they ask, ‘Would you sleep with that girl?’ And he’s like, ‘Pffsh, no,’” Portman, who was at the time pregnant their first child, quipped. “He’s the best actor. It’s not true: He totally wants to sleep with me!”\n\nBoth Portman and Millepied are known for being private about their personal lives, which includes their family life with son Aleph, 12, and daughter Amalia, 7."
