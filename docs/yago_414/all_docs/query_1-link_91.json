        "text": "Undoubtedly one of, if not the most influential director of all time, every one of Quentin Tarantino’s films is iconic and critically acclaimed in their own right. Due to his upcoming birthday, (March 27) here are all of Tarantino’s films ranked (In my opinion).\n\n1. Pulp Fiction (1994) (Crime/Drama)\n\nThere is very little that can be said about a film held in such high regard by critics and audiences alike. Every aspect of Pulp Fiction is near perfect, and it is easily one of the most iconic films of all time.\n\n2. Django Unchained (2012) (Western/Drama)\n\nIncredible action sequences and vibrant cinematography mixed with camera work and editing that pays beautiful homage to the spaghetti western genre all make Django Unchained one of the best westerns of the 21st century. Every performance is unmatched, and the ending is built up to and executed beautifully.\n\n3. Reservoir Dogs (1992) (Crime/Drama)\n\nSimple but extremely effective, Reservoir Dogs takes a handful of strangers, dumps them in a sticky situation, and leaves them to fight amongst themselves. With its incredible writing and acting, Reservoir Dogs is a tense crime classic you won’t want to miss.\n\n4. The Hateful Eight (2015) (Western/Drama)\n\nThough many complain about the runtime, I would argue that the 175 minutes of The Hateful Eight flies by, despite the fact that 90% of the film takes place in one room. With its snowy landscapes and characters turned against each other, The Hateful Eight is essentially a western version of John Carpenter’s The Thing (coincidentally also a film starring Kurt Russel featuring music by the legendary Ennio Morricone.)\n\n5. Inglorious Basterds (2009) (War/Drama)\n\nPacked with a clever script, impeccable acting, and unforgettable ending, Inglorious Basterds is a gem of the late 2000’s and contains easily some of the best characters in all of cinema (in particular those portrayed by Christolph Waltz and Brad Pitt).\n\n6. Death Proof (2007) (Action/Thriller)\n\nA wonderful homage to grindhouse films of the 1970’s, Death Proof is darkly comedic and simultaneously disturbing, creating a thrilling and memorable viewing experience. Kurt Russel as Stuntman Mike McKay is easily one of the greatest cinematic antagonists of the 21st century thus far.\n\n7. Kill Bill vol. 1 (2003) (Action/Crime)\n\nKill Bill vol. 1 is an over-the-top, fun homage to 70’s martial arts movies, and it’s always a joy to watch. Great acting, cinematography, choreography, and even writing, which is usually not a pivotal part of most action films.\n\n8. Jackie Brown (1997) (Crime/Drama)\n\nJackie Brown may be a standard crime movie, but it does the genre better than most. The best thing about the film is undoubtedly the plot and the way it is presented, but it also features some amazing performances and sharp dialogue.\n\n9. Kill Bill vol.2 (2004) (Action/Martial Arts)\n\nDespite its low placing on this list, Kill Bill vol. 2 is still a good movie with vibrant imagery and tense fight sequences similar to the first film. It also wraps up the story nicely, leaving the audience satisfied and fulfilled.\n\n10. Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood (2019) (Comedy/Drama)\n\nExcellent acting and writing all around, but the film is brought down by its sluggish pacing, unnecessary scenes, and nearly 3 hour runtime. The film’s beginning and ending are both very well done, but the middle feels hollow and over exaggerated.\n\n11. My Best Friend’s Birthday (1987) (Short/Comedy)"
