        "text": "Tarantino’s Influences and the Particular Style\n\nPost by Jie Zhong (s3356143)\n\nQuentin Tarantino, being one of the most successful filmmakers, his films have been accoladed by a great many of fans and in the meantime have been criticized for shamelessly borrowing scenes and techniques from other films. Tarantino’s films are always a stand-out due to the combination of boldness, violence, energy, humorous dialogues and interspersed with popular cultures. Tarantino’s quintessential style is reflected in different aspects of his filmography. For instance, the non-linear way of narration, the homages to the directors whom he admires, the references and the influences from the movies that he likes; the themes are often revolved around gangster, crimes and revenge, and the integrating music; altogether have formed his unique style.\n\nCHAPTER I: THE INFLUENCES AND HOMAGES\n\nNumerous references have been adopted for his own films from the films he admires are frequently the centre point of the topic, when either himself been interviewed or his movies been mentioned in some articles or film reviews. It is even said that it is easier to find the films that he hasn’t taken any references from than the ones from which the references been taken. It is always hard to define when talking about that of what particular genre Tarantino’s films is, as the director’s works often combine Film Noir, Spaghetti Westerns, Japanese samurai, Chinese martial arts and even animation altogether in one piece. Take a look at Kill Bill: Vol. 1, the plot is said been borrowed from Francois Turffaut’s movie The Bride Wore Black, which is also about a bride been shot down at her wedding day and seek her revenge; the silhouette fight in the House of Blue scene is almost identical to the scene from the Japanese movie Samurai Fiction, only the background colour has been switched to blue instead of red; the tune Daryl Hannah whistles is exactly the same as the one Hywel Bennett does in Twisted Nerve; and Uma Thurman’s yellow tracksuit is the same as the one Bruce Lee wears in the Game of Death.\n\nFig 1. The silhouettes of fight scenes in Samurai Fiction and Kill Bill Vol. 1\n\nIn addition, the famous dance scene of Tarantino’s film Pulp Fiction that features Mia (Uma Thurman) and Vincent (John Travolta) in Jack Rabbit Slim’s, the audiences are aware of that the staffs working in the entire restaurant are dressed as a whole bunch of 50s icons, that includes Marilyn Monroe, Buddy Holly, Dean Martin, etc; shows the Tarantino’s way of paying tribute to these old stars.\n\nCHAPTER II: THE NON-LINEAR NARRATIVES\n\nAnother distinction of Tarantino’s films is the non-linear technique of narration, the method that is often used in novels and always is repeated an event with the perspective of different characters. For instance his breakthrough film Pulp Fiction, the apparent non-linear narrative is started at the very beginning of the movie, as the scene shows the characters Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are having a conversation in the diner, suddenly the scene has cut to introducing another two characters of the movie, Vincent and Jules, showing the duo are retrieving a black suitcase; and the movie ends with the same scene as the beginning, as the scene has been cut back to the diner with Pumpkin and Honey Bunny in.\n\nFig 2. Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are having a conversation in the diner.\n\nBecause of the non-linear narratives, his films always have intersected titles to tell audiences of a new section of the story; As in Inglorious Basterds, the title Chapter Three, German Night in Paris, 1944, June, appear right before the scene that Shosanna is changing the movie titles in the marquee of her cinema. The non-linear narratives technique in a way makes Tarantino’s works stylishly cool, and becomes the necessity of interpretation of the story in another.\n\nCHAPTER III: THE VIOLENCES\n\nViolence is a frequent subject in Tarantino’s films. For example in the sward fight scene of Kill Bill: Vol.1, many of the brides’s rivals have their blood spray from the wounds, Elle Driver’s eye is plucked by the bride in Kill Bill Vol. 2. And in Pulp Fiction, the head of the hostage of Vincent and Jules is blown up accidentally by a gunshot. There’s even a flashback scene in Japanese styled animation of Lucy Liu’s character O-Ren Ishii in Kill Bill: Vol. 1, that depicts O-Ren’s miserable past of her witnessing her parents been brutally killed, is drenched with blood.\n\nFig 3. The animated scene of O-Ren’s past.\n\nThe director himself claimed that he’s not responsible for what some people does after they see a movie, but is responsible to make the characters as true as he can for the audiences to see; he also thinks that if the kids will respond to violence naturally, it will make them good violent filmmakers but not violent human beings when they grow up.\n\nCHAPTER IV: THE SOUNDTRACKS\n\nLike his movies, the film soundtracks is diversified in a wide range of genres in Tarantino’s movies as well, which shows his rich knowledge at the field of music. Whether you like the movies or not, the soundtracks of his movies are always memorable and worth a listen. The music in his movies is more than just background music, it is well merged with the scenes and somehow brought out the particular mood. The tune that played when Elle Driver walking down the hospital corridor is the theme from the 1968 film Twisted Nerve; which delivers a mixed-up mood of unease, callousness and psychotic combined with the moving images.\n\nFig 4. Elle Driver walking down the hospital corridor.\n\nThe soundtrack plays at the scene before the Nazi night when Shosanna getting ready for the event is David Bowie’s Cat People. Even though a lot of people find it’s absurd to have a 1980’s pop song in a Nazi themed movie, he himself claimed as long as it serves the scene well and fits the mood, it scores. And music is not only served as soundtracks for Tarantino’s films, it is also a great inspiration to him prior to the movie making. According to one interview in 2012 “…I have a record room off of my bedroom. It looks like a used-record store, with record posters and bins of records broken down into genres. That’s a bit part of my think tank.” He would listen to the music and visualize in his mind of the scenes that he’s going to make for his films, if he found a couple of pieces, it would be getting closer to an actual movie.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nWebsites\n\nWikipedia, 2013, ‘Quentin Tarantino’ Viewed 29th Aug 2013\n\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino>\n\nRose, S, 2004, ‘Found: where Tarantino gets his ideas’, Viewed 29th Aug 2013\n\n<http://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/apr/06/features.dvdreviews>\n\nMcGrath, C, 2012, ‘Quentin’s World’, Viewed 29th Aug 2013\n\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/23/movies/how-quentin-tarantino-concocted-a-genre-of-his-own.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&>\n\nWhat Culture, 2013, ‘Quentin Tarantino: The Definitive Guide to Homages, Influences and References’, Viewed 29th Aug 2013\n\n<http://whatculture.com/film/quentin-tarantino-definitive-guide.php>\n\nScott, 2011, ‘Nonlinear storytelling in “Pulp Fiction” ‘, Viewed 12th Sep 2013\n\n<http://gointothestory.blcklst.com/2011/07/nonlinear-storytelling-in-pulp-fiction.html>\n\nWhat Culture, 2013, ‘10 Greatest Uses of Music in Quentin Tarantino Films’, Viewed 12th Sep 2013\n\n<http://whatculture.com/film/10-greatest-uses-of-music-in-quentin-tarantino-films.php>\n\nZuckerman, E, 2013, ‘Everything Quentin Tarantino Really Thinks about Violence and the Movies’, Viewed 12th Sep 2013\n\n<http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2013/01/quentin-tarantino-violence-quotes/60900/>\n\nQUENTIN TARANTINO\n\nBy Jiajia Tan S3344727\n\nCHAPTER 1: TARANTINO’S BACKGROUND\n\nQuestin Tarantino is a multi-faceted talent borne in Knoxville, Tennesse (America). He is a film director, screenwriter, producer, cinematographer and actor. Tarantino developed his passion for films and storytelling when he was young. Displaying his creativity at a tender age, Tarantino wrote sad Mother’s Day stories and ‘killed’ his mother in his imagination and felt terrible about that. Despite being a high school dropout, he studied at James Best Theatre for 2 years. He worked odd jobs before working at the video archive store as a clerk. It was through his stint at the video archive store that he learnt and expanded his knowledge on filmmaking. His success has come a long way since his first attempt at film with ‘My Best Friend’s Birthday’.\n\nCHAPTER 2: TARANTINO’S AWARDS & ACCOLADES\n\nNow acclaimed movie director of any movies such as Reservoir Dogs (1992), Pulp Fiction (1994), Kill Bill (2003), Inglorious Bastards (2009), Django Unchained (2012), Quentin Tarantino has bagged many accolades and awards. His films have achieved massive critical and commercial success globally. The awards include two Academy Awards , two Golden Globe Awards, two BAFTA Awards, and the Palme d’Or as well as Emmy and Grammy nominations. Pulp Fiction’s $8.5 million budget returned a massive box office gross of $214 million with seven Oscar nominations, winning Tarantino and his writing partner Roger Avary the award for Best Original Screenplay. Django Unchained won the best original screenplay at the 85th Academy Awards 2013. The film also received Oscar nominations for best picture, cinematography and sound editing. Tarantino is ranked 8th in Empire (UK) magazine as the greatest director and was also the head judge at the prestige Cannes Film Festival 2004.\n\nCHAPTER 3: MEDIA VIOLENCE\n\nMedia violence has always been a hot topic of discussion. Graphic violence has always been a major and reoccurring theme revolving Tarantino’s films. According to Vanityfair: In eight films, an estimation of 560 people died on-screen. Tarantino’s works are also often criticized for the crude dialogues in his movies, racial epithet like the use of the word “nigger”, vulgarities and violence. People regularly questioned the effects of media violence evident in his films on society. Despite critics about his films, Tarantino is unapologetic about his filmmaking and his aestheticization of violence in them. As quoted: “My work is kind of unmistakably me, and I like that about it. But you know, you are either going to really dig it or you’re gonna be against it.”\n\nEstimation of deaths in Tarantino’s Films\n\nAccording to Chicago Times (1993), Tarantino stated that he was “not responsible for what some person does after they see a movie”. His responsibility was “to make characters and to be as true to them as [I] possibly can.” Tarantino believed that violence was the best form of cinema entertainment. While some people hated it, many loved the violence on big screens in Hollywood. Even Kolker notes that “Action films are what Hollywood does best and let’s face it, they’re terrific — that kinetic energy, that ability to get things rolling and picking up steam. They’re not pretentious, and they’re fun.”\n\nThe use of violence in movies has seemed to captivate the audience despite the ongoing debate on whether media violence has actual influence on real-life violent acts. Some audience seek thrill through action-packed movies peppered with violence, while others wish to enjoy the tension and seek to witness justice served. The idea of “fantasy” and immersion in a fantasy world helps people experience the “flow” (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990).\n\nCHAPTER 4: TARANTINO’S INFLUENCE IN THE INDUSTRY\n\nTarantino also has huge influences on the filmmaking industry. Many films have been noted to be “tarantino-esque” such as Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, In Bruges, Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. Other Tarantino-inspired movies are Dead Fish, Catch 44, Hell Ride, The Immortals, 2 days in the Valley and Flypaper. (IMDb, 2012)\n\nDespite his huge success, Tarantino is upfront about borrowing references, as quoted: “I steal from every movie ever made. I love it – if my work has anything it’s that I’m taking this from this and that from that and mixing them together. If people don’t like that, then tough titty, don’t go and see it, alright? I steal from everything. Great artists steal; they don’t do homages.”. (Henry, B., 2013). He creates brilliant mash-up of various combinations of inspirations but does it very well. On top of that, Tarantino has great passion for his work and is very focused in what he does. Film has always been a huge part of his life and Tarantino loves it. Tarantino stated: “When I’m doing a movie, I’m not doing anything else. It’s all about the movie. I don’t have a wife. I don’t have a kid. Nothing can get in my way … I’ve made a choice, so far, to go on this road alone. Because this is my time. This is my time to make movies,” (Katy, H., 2009)\n\nSome of the filmmaking tips that Tarantino offers with his 20 years of filmmaking include: faking until you make it, stealing from great artists and making movies that are impersonally personal. (Henry, B., 2013). According to Tarantino: “Good filmmaking is Passion, Patience, and Perseverance.”\n\nWith every success story, there are always haters and fans, with polarizing points of views. However, it is without doubt that Tarantino is a true innovator in storytelling who creates a strong and highly stylized cinematic presence through his film with his characters and dialogues. The characters he creates feel real and his films always have connections to popular culture from the mention of Elvis, Marilyn Manroe, Superman, and Spiderman to Fantastic 4 etcetera in various scenes and dialogues. Tarantino was definitely ahead of his time and continues to be an inspiration to many in the industry.\n\n—\n\nReferences\n\nAli, G. 2013, The Intricate, Expansive Universe of Quentin Tarantino, viewed on 17 September, <http://au.ign.com/articles/2013/01/17/the-intricate-expansive-universe-of-quentin-tarantino.&gt;\n\nArun, K 2012, Masters of cinema: Quentin Tarantino, viewed on 17 September 2013, <http://movieretrospect.blogspot.com.au/2012/03/masters-of-cinema-quentin-tarantino.html.&gt;\n\nBrian.

[Stuff to Watch], viewed on 16 September 2013, <http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/have-you-seen-quentin-tarantinos-top-12-movies-stuff-to-watch/.&gt;\n\nPost by Gabriella Anita Ariffin (s3327179)\n\nQuentin Tarantino’s movies, often related to post-modernism and mass art, are always tender subjects of discussion even until today. This happens because Quentin Tarantino has succeeded in creating a new way of story telling through movie, enlightening the audience and making them feel absorbed in captivation. In the process of making such phenomena, the vivid idea of the story as well as every tiny aspect in film-making, such as camera technique; the actor and actress; and location and props is equally important. Within this essay, the writer will explain each of them in relation with some examples from Tarantino’s movies.\n\nCHAPTER I: THE STORY\n\nQuentin Tarantino’s screenplay is the shining jewel of his movie, which is influenced by theater playwriting rather than the Hollywood style. Interestingly, when writing his story, Tarantino does not want to play God. The characters’ decision and rational thinking will decide what happens in the story. Thus, as a writer, he often surprises himself with the final result. His screenplay is mostly focused on clever dialogues, which sometimes includes long monologue and conversation, with some additions of detailed actions. Therefore, the movie proceeds really slowly and steadily; influencing the audience’s feeling in the way he wanted to. He refuses to use emotional or blasting music or massive CGI to evoke appropriate feeling from the viewer.\n\nThe element of unexpectedness is perhaps one of the distinct qualities of the story line in Tarantino’s movie. Although all of them have the fundamental and well-known themes such as gang violent, revenge and war, the overall story is usually totally different from the other mainstream movies. Pulp Fiction is the most suitable example for this. Pulp Fiction’s story is based on gangster violence, but the story has nearly nothing related to gunfight or criminality. Tarantino once describe Pulp Fiction’s story line as ‘hanging out with the character’ for two days. Tarantino likes to tell a realistic story and within every storyline, he intends to play with the viewer’s expectation.\n\nAbove all, dark humor and irony is also a common theme in his movie. The way Tarantino injects humor in his movies is rather special because it is obvious that the characters in the movies are not telling a joke or trying to be funny. Some of the scenes will even confuse the audience. Whether it is laughable or not, the humor is there to take. The examples of such scenes include Marsellus being raped by a cop in Pulp Fiction, and when Beatrix Kiddo plucked Elle’s eyes in Kill Bill 2.\n\nFig. 1 Fight scene between Beatrix and Elle\n\nCHAPTER II: FILMING TECHNIQUE\n\nAll Tarantino’s movies are captured with a classic film camera. The reason he states is quite interesting because he believes that shooting in film is related to the magic of movie. He explained that when shooting with film, the director is not capturing movement, but still images. After the film is being projected, an illusion will then be created on the screen. Tarantino regards this illusion as magic, thus he does not want to lose it by using digital camera.\n\nThe camera angles Tarantino choose are often varying. He is doing it all in order to achieve dramatic scenes throughout the movie. However, some of the chosen angles have meaning and purposes. An example would be in Mr. White’s and Mr. Pink’s conversation in Reservoir Dogs. At first, the camera peeks into the room as he shoots from behind a wall before progressively getting closer and closer to the characters. Tarantino, in this matter, wants to make the audience feel like they are watching something private which they should not be allowed to see.\n\nAt the same time, Tarantino likes to use a lot of long static camera shot to capture long conversation between his characters or a long monologue. This allows the viewer to watch calmly and understand the exchanged words. Despite that, the shots are not all static. There are many scenes where the camera moves together with the characters’ rhythm in the movie.\n\nFig 2. Dancing scene in Pulp Fiction where camera move slowly around the characters.\n\nTarantino, who has never learnt film making officially in any institute got his film techniques from experience and from mimicking other movies that he had watched before. Some of his influences were from his favorites movies directors: Jean-Luc Godard and Brian de Palma.\n\nCHAPTER III: LOCATION AND PROPS\n\nAs mentioned before, location and props are one of the most important things in Tarantino’s movie. The perfect locations, which are often hard to find and sometimes located outside the country, must be able to explain the scene by itself. For example, the little house on the hill in the prologue of Inglorious Basterds symbolize safety and peace, the Sushi bar in Kill Bill 1 shows how secretive Hanzo Hatori is, the warehouse in Reservoir Dogs has become the stage for all the characters to be involved, etc. Each of the location is special for a particular reason in the scene.\n\nFig 3. Young Shosanna was running away from her hiding place.\n\nProps are also not merely tools from Tarantino’s point of view. In fact, the props are often symbols and are iconic for each of his movie. Samurai sword for example, is the icon for Kill Bill, Cars for Dead Proofs, bombs for Inglorious Basterds and Guns for Pulp Fiction. Without these props, there will be no Quentin Tarantino movie.\n\nFig 4. Samurai sword is an icon for Kill Bill movie.\n\nCHAPTER IV: CHARACTERS\n\nWhat is the story without characters, and what is a movie without actress/actor? They are the souls of story telling, and Quentin Tarantino loves each of them. Every character in his movies is special and all of them participate equally in order to create the world they are created in. Even the villains have distinct personalities, which makes them hard to be hated by the viewer. A Nazi soldier who acted really bravely when being interrogated by the bastards in Inglorious Basterds is the perfect example. Tarantino never tries to make it easy or make other secondary characters besides the main leads pointless and forgettable.\n\nFig 5. Nazi Soldier who is being interrogated by the Basterds\n\nFig 6. Each of the characters become an important aspect in telling the whole story.\n\nIn his journey of filmmaking, Tarantino often works with sought-after actress and actors. He has some favorite actors he wants to work with, and in some cases, he writes a specific character based on the actor. The example for this is Samuel Jackson in Pulp Fiction. However, Tarantino always takes his audition seriously and will only use talented performers, who he feels is suitable for the character inside his story.\n\nReferences\n\nBooks\n\nBarlow, A 2010, Quentin Tarantino: Life at The Extremes, ABC-CLIO, LLC, California.\n\nPeary, G 1998, Quentin Tarantino: Interviews, University Press of Mississippi, United States of America.\n\nArticles\n\nDeemer, C 1994, ‘The Screenplay of Quentin Tarantino’, Creative Screen Writing, issue From the Winter.\n\nLyman, R 2002.’Tarantino behind the camera in Beijing’, The New York Times, 5 September, p.E1.\n\nMacfarquhar, L 2003 ‘The Movie Lover’, The New Yorker, 20 October, p.147.\n\nWebsites\n\nWikipedia 2013, Quentin Tarantino, Wikipedia, viewed on 10 September <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino>.\n\nCompovision 2011, ‘Quentin Tarantino comments on Digital vs Film’, Youtube, viewed on 10 September 2013, <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BON9Ksn1PqI&gt;"
