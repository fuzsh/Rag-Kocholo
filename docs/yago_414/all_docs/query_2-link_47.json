        "text": "Research general contextual information about Pulp Fiction and its filmmakers.\n\n-Refer to the Contexts Of Film section to guide your independent research.\n\n-Present your research as either an infographic or an illustrated blog post.\n\n-Research widely and dig deep — detail will be rewarded.\n\n-Bear in mind the Core Study Areas and Additional Study Areas for this component.\n\nAll Core Study Areas:\n\n-Key Elements Of Film Form\n\n-Contexts Of Film\n\n-Aesthetics\n\n-Representation\n\n2 Additional Study Areas:\n\nAuteurship\n\nNarrative\n\nNotes on the director:\n\n-Tarantino originally wanted to be an actor\n\n-From a young age, Tarantino loved films, especially crime and gore\n\n-At 22, got a job at a video store\n\n-Worked on his first film, My Best Friend’s Birthday (Quentin Tarantino, 1987) whilst working at the video store. He directed, edited, co-wrote, co-produced and starred in the film\n\n-Similar to director Guillermo del Toro, Tarantino prefers to direct his own ‘indie’ movies, as they are more personal. These two directors do however, make Hollywood films\n\n-Repeated use of actors: Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Brad Pitt, and Leonardo DiCaprio (among others)\n\n-Inspired by the crime and gangster genre from the 30’s and 40’s. As a teen, Tarantino enjoyed a range of films, mainly watching films from his childhood – the 70s – which had a range of crime films and shootouts in Westerns\n\nTarantino’s auteurship and aesthetics Cinematography-Long takes and tracking shots that build suspense, and raise the expectation of a violent scene\n\n-Scenes from inside car boots\n\n-Corpse shots\n\nSound -Soundtracks are compilations of lesser-known songs that reflect the time period or pop culture (for example, 50s music in the 50s diner in Pulp Fiction)\n\nMise-en-Scene -Particularly in Pulp Fiction, Tarantino uses a non-linear, fragmented structure. His narrative is a key aspect of his auteurship.\n\n-Story told out of chronological order\n\n-The crime genre with ‘inappropriate humour’ given the context in the film\n\n-The theme of revenge, redemption or karma\n\n-Fake products and brands to make the film-world seem more realistic (such as ‘Red Apple Cigarettes’, or the ‘Big Kahuna Burger’ Jules steals from Brett). Also brands like McDonalds, KFC and Sprite are mentioned\n\n-Similar to the mention of McDonalds, KFC and Sprite, Tarantino uses themes, brands, objects or ideas (pop culture) that are prevalent at the time to make the film seem more real and more relatable\n\n-Black-and-white suits (easy to maintain continuity). Tarantino is able to reflect the situation with the suits, such as the clean-up-of-Marvin scene in Pulp Fiction – Vincent and Jules’ suits are bloodied and ruined after previously having been smart. In Reservoir Dogs, all the men wore suits because it was something all the actors had (therefore, it was more relatable, and it was recognisable as ‘smart’)\n\n-Gratuitous and disproportionate violence, torture scenes\n\nPerformance\n\n-Repeated use of actors (mentioned above), and occasionally, lesser-known actors. Additionally, the re-appearance of names, like Vincent Vega (Pulp Fiction) and Vic Vega (Reservoir Dogs (Quentin Tarantino (1992))\n\n-‘Foul language’, casual swearing that seems to ‘fit’ the film and context\n\nThese are reoccurring themes and features throughout Tarantino’s films, clearly showing his auteurship and clear vision of what a film should look like. His style (specifically, his use of fragmented narrative) is what makes Pulp Fiction an experimental film.\n\nRepresentation\n\nRace\n\nThe use of the n-word throughout the film was controversial. It was used often and by both black and white characters. There was also a positive outlook on race, with characters like Jules and Wallace in charge and dominant. Jules was the peacemaker and the one with common sense to change his murderous ways, and Vincent refused to change and was ready to kill both Honey Bunny and Pumpkin. This shows that he is ‘the good guy’ who is able to redeem himself, and Vincent is not, so he dies.\n\nWhen Jules and Vincent go to Brett’s apartment, Jules is portrayed as the most powerful. He jokes with Brett and his associates as he takes bites of Brett’s burger, commenting on how good it is – he momentarily sets-aside his job to casually discuss food. He is able to remain calm and in control of the situation while those he points his gun at can only sit and listen to him (also like Pumpkin in the final scene). In this scene, Vincent obeys Jules – he searches the cabinets Jules tells him to, and checks the briefcase, reporting back to Jules when he has found the briefcase and all of its contents. Later, when Vincent turns to talk to Marvin, he accidentally shoots him, which shows Vincent to be the ‘stupid one’ compared to Jules, the intelligent one. Despite Jules not being the mob boss, he is certainly one of the most powerful characters in the film.\n\nGender\n\nMia’s voice over the intercom while Vincent is lost in her house shows she has the control. Her voice adds a sexual element to this chapter, representing her as ‘mysterious’. The rumours around the ‘foot massage incident’ add to her mystery. She is powerful and dominant over Vincent (she is his boss’ wife, but also is sure of herself and her status). The camera cuts to her looking at security cameras, just showing her lips and fragments of her face. In addition, she can see Vincent, but he can’t see her – this allows her to order him to go to the intercom, so he can talk to her and he obeys. Vincent is lost and not in control – his performance shows he’s a bit on edge (he’s also on heroine). Mia is seen smoking and doing cocaine, which at the time, was seen as something a powerful man did.\n\nReception ”Against its budget of $8.5 million and about $10 million in marketing costs, Pulp Fiction wound up grossing $107.93 million at the U.S. box office, making it the first “indie” film to surpass $100 million. Worldwide, it took in nearly $213 million.”\n\nThe film was hugely successful, and not only because it was a Tarantino film – its experimental narrative made it unique and a must-watch, Tarantino opposed stereotypes, used well-known actors, a popular film genre and a niche soundtrack. All of this made it unique and shocking, which built on its reputation more and more.\n\nHowever, the film was also very controversial for its overt racism through use of the n-word. Despite Jules and Marcellus being two of the most powerful characters, the excessive use of the n-word can’t be ignored. Famous director Spike Lee has commented on the use of the word, and shown his dislike for the representation of black people in Pulp Fiction. He has said “[…] some people speak that way. But, Quentin is infatuated with that word […] I want Quentin to know that all African-Americans do not think that word is trendy or slick.” In fact, Lee and Tarantino have got into a feud over the word. Lee is not alone with this – many think 38 times is excessive, especially when it is coming from white characters. Despite the success of the film, the use of the word is definitely what caused the most conflict in opinions.\n\nDate: 15/09/22"
