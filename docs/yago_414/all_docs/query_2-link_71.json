        "text": "Re-interpretation of François Truffaut’s La Politique des auteurs Discourse Roh, Chul-Hwan In January 1954, an article in Cahiers du Cinéma provoked a controversial issue in the French film industry: “A Certain Tendency of French Cinema” written by François Truffaut. A young critic criticized bitterly contemporary French major films, called ‘Tradition of quality’. One of the main concepts used in this article, La Politique des auteurs (Authors' politics) became the core of Auteur theory (Author theory) discourse later on. After this discourse, Truffaut's opinion had become a turning point of cinema studies. For example, the classification like American movies as commercial movies VS. European films as art films was gone. Nowadays, almost everyone admits globally this concept, ‘film director as authors’. The existence of film d’auteur(author's film) is surely certain. “A Certain Tendency of French Cinema” has been still cited as the root of Auteur theory. However, many studies have misinterpreted Truffaut's article. What he had said in his article was partially obscured behind the name of Auteurism or Auteur theory. Also, there are some uncritically accepted errors which were made by the Anglo-American critics. This study looks into La Politique des auteurs once again to find out Truffaut's real intention. It wants to make a diagnosis of the analytic errors or some misinterpretations.\n\nIn “What Is An Author?,” Michel Foucault critiques the traditional notion that sees authors as their texts’ mere human creators. Instead of placing the author in a position of privileged authority, Foucault suggests that one should analyze the author as an evolving classificatory function of the text. While Foucault refers primarily to literary texts in this piece, he acknowledges that the author function can apply to other sources as well. Therefore, considering Foucault’s view of the author function in conjunction with auteur theory in cinema, which claims the director as the “author” of a film, fosters both a fascinating and constructive study. Mixing these theories together creates complications, as cinema and literature function in similar, but not identical ways; however, this dual analysis yields a beneficial outcome, as it raises profound insights for both mediums. In addition to “What Is An Author?” this essay will draw on François Truffaut’s “A Certain Tendency of the French Cinema” and Andrew Sarris’ “Notes on the Auteur Theory in 1962” to show how Foucault’s theory of the author can evolve and expand when applied to film directors."
