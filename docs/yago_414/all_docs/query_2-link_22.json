        "text": "“Experimental film is often the result of an auteur challenging established conventions with fresh ideas.” With reference to your chosen film option, how far do you agree with this statement?\n\nPlanning\n\n-Pulp Fiction (Quentin Tarantino, 1994) is considered to be an experimental film. Experimental film is thought to be any film that experiments with some aspects of filmmaking. -What are established conventions of film? Mention Levi-Strauss and Propp: widely accepted ideas. Tarantino doesn’t conform to their ideas, and chooses to ‘experiment’ with established ideas\n\n-Tarantino uses a fragmented structure – this does not conform, as he experiments with this filmmaking process\n\n>Pulp Fiction is split into three named chapters: ‘Vincent Vega and Marcellus Wallace’s Wife,’ ‘The Gold Watch,’ and ‘The Bonnie Situation.’ The diner scenes are unnamed.\n\n-Propp’s character types: usually a goody and baddy, Tarantino has all bad characters. This means there is limited binary opposition (between bad and bad, black and white). Instead, Tarantino makes characters more sympathetic using audience positioning\n\n-Films usually position an audience to see from the hero’s perspective\n\n>Tarantino positioned an audience differently in each new chapter so\n\ncertain characters are seen differently\n\n–Tarantino does not use these widely accepted ideas, and instead uses his own, different ideas. This adds to the belief that he makes experimental films\n\n-Usually films don’t have unnecessary dialogue, and oddly detailed characters. Scenes that could be reduced to a simple car journey, Tarantino makes just as long as following action. Because of this, his scripts are very lengthy – between 120 and 180 on average compared to a normal 100. Tarantino has conversations that don’t progress the plot\n\nHowever, Tarantino says he has ‘stolen from every film ever made’ – he reuses ideas as part of his auteurship\n\nVersion 1\n\nPulp Fiction (Quentin Tarantino, 1994) is considered to be an experimental film. An experimental film is thought to be any film that experiments with different aspects of filmmaking, whether it is frame composition, sound, character development or narrative structure. Experimental films challenge the well-established film conventions with different or ‘fresh’ ideas, usually due to the directors auteurship. For this reason, Quentin Tarantino is considered to be an experimental film director.\n\nClaude Levi-Strauss and Vladimir Propp are two theorists who developed ideas about film that are widely accepted to this day. Tarantino doesn’t conform to their ideas, and chooses to ‘experiment’ with established ideas. One of Propp’s theories suggests that there are multiple character types, one being the hero, and another being villain. Tarantino only has one character type – the villain. For instance, Jules and Vincent kill Brett and his roommates, and although Brett is the victim, he stole from Marcellus. This makes Tarantino’s approach to creating characters experimental and unconventional, because there isn’t a hero the audience can sympathise or relate to.\n\nA second theorist is Claude Levi-Strauss who suggested the presence of binary opposition in all films. To an extent, there is binary opposition in Pulp Fiction, but it is between different types of evil – the idea of binary opposition is manipulated. For example, when The Wolf is introduced to cover up the murder, he is made to be seen as the hero, when in fact, he is just as bad as the murderer, Vincent. There is opposition between The Wolf and Vincent, because Vincent doesn’t like to be told what to do, especially without ‘please and thank you’. Before The Wolf arrives, Jules and Vincent are asking Jimmy to help them cover up the body of Marvin – it takes some convincing, but Jimmy is eventually compliant. Tarantino has used the familiar concept of binary opposition to create tension between different evil characters to progress the film, and has also used audience positioning to make binary opposition into something new and ‘fresh’. Tarantino places an audience in such a way in each chapter that their sympathies shift throughout the film, creating a different type of opposition that does not follow the established theory of Levi-Strauss.\n\nBecause of Tarantino’s love for the crime and gang genre, his films often end up with a cast that are predominantly (if not completely) evil. This means Tarantino’s characters are villains, so there can be no binary opposition – this shows how his auteurship has influenced the challenge of Propp’s character types and Levi-Strauss’ binary opposition.\n\nSecondly, mainstream Hollywood films don’t usually have extensive scenes of dialogue, and unusually detailed characters. Scenes that could be reduced to a simple car journey, Tarantino makes just as long as the following action. Because of this, his scripts are very lengthy – between 120 and 180 pages on average compared to a normal 100 – having lengthy, unnecessary conversations is a key feature of his auteurship. The characters have mundane, everyday conversations, such as the car journey to Brett’s apartment. Jules and Vincent discuss fast food, such as McDonalds and KFC in Europe. This conversation resumes again when the two enter the apartment, and Jules begins to question Brett about his fast food breakfast, before brutally killing him and his roommates. This is unusual, and almost humorous; it undermines the violent nature of this scene, because, rather than being a quick, bloody assassination, the irrelevant conversation about fast food that precedes the killings makes the scene less serious. This lengthy dialogue and the detailed characters is something exclusive to Tarantino – his auteurship – and can’t be seen in other films that conform to established conventions. For reason, it can be said that Pulp Fiction is experimental as a direct result of Tarantino’s auteurship.\n\nThe most noticeable experimental feature that Tarantino employs is the use of a non-linear narrative that splits the film into chapters. In Pulp Fiction, the film is split into the chapters of: ‘Vincent Vega and Marcellus Wallace’s Wife’, ‘ The Gold Watch’ and ‘The Bonnie Situation’ (plus the unnamed diner scenes). These chapters are fragmented and told out of chronological order, which is not the established or usual method of story telling; this can also be seen in Reservoir Dogs (Quentin Tarantino, 1992) and Inglorious Basterds (Quentin Tarantino, 2009), showing his preference for this stylistic feature as part of his auteurship. This challenges normal, established film conventions with an unfamiliar, new idea that Tarantino has popularised in modern cinema and filmmaking. A ‘normal’ film would have a linear structure that is told chronologically – a structure that is widely accepted, and what an audience expects, but Tarantino does not conform to this idea.\n\nTarantino’s personal influence on the film and his auteurship results in Pulp Fiction being an experimental film. Andre Bazin said that when a director has full creative control over all aspects of their film, they are said to be an auteur. Tarantino challenges the usual filmmaking conventions by changing different aspects of the standard film structure into something more visually and conceptually interesting. He alters narrative and character development to create a style that is unique to him, and that do not follow the expected ‘rules’ of filmmaking. For this reason, I fully agree that Pulp Fiction is an experimental film.\n\nDate: 14/10/22\n\nResearch Quentin Tarantino’s auteur signature features and map these against specific described examples from Pulp Fiction\n\nFilm order\n\n1. Reservoir Dogs (Quentin Tarantino, 1992)\n\n2. Pulp Fiction (Quentin Tarantino, 1994)\n\n3. Jackie Brown (Quentin Tarantino, 1997)\n\n4. Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (Quentin Tarantino, 2003)\n\n5. Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (Quentin Tarantino, 2004)\n\n6. Inglorious Basterds (Quentin Tarantino, 2009)\n\n7. Django Unchained (Quentin Tarantino, 2012)\n\n8. The Hateful Eight (Quentin Tarantino, 2015)\n\n9. Once upon a Time in Hollywood (Quentin Tarantino, 2019)\n\n10. ???\n\nQuentin Tarantino can be described as an auteur for many reasons. He alters essentially all elements of film form to create his style, taking inspiration from pop culture and film before him. His style is seen across all the films he directed and wrote, and because he uses so many elements of film form to create his style, his films are easily recognised.\n\nTo start with, Tarantino weaves masses of pop culture references into his films, whether it is a reference to another era, film or icon in film history, or a shot or sequence resembling an older film. For example, in Reservoir Dogs, the film opens with the men talking about Madonna, and later discuss The Great Escape (John Sturges, 1963), starting the film off with two recognised names. Additionally, the entirety of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is based on 90s pop culture in Hollywood, which would be a familiar topic for the adult audience. In Pulp Fiction at the beginning of Vincent and Jules’ chapter, they discuss fast food, such as McDonald’s and KFC in a mundane conversation as they arrive at Brett’s apartment, juxtaposing the violence that is to come. Before going into the apartment complex, the two talk about ‘pilot episodes’, which is another pop culture reference that makes these two characters seem almost normal with real emotions beyond being heartless killers. It is references like this that makes Tarantino’s films distinguished from others, and is also relatable to some degree.\n\nThis leads onto Tarantino’s use of retro songs that have long since been relevant. Before Jules and Vincent are introduced, ‘Jungle Boogie’ plays as the credits roll. In a modern era, many of the songs Tarantino used are still popular today, and that is because Tarantino used them. Another example is ‘Little Green Bag’ in Reservoir Dogs, which is still heard in a modern era in film, TV and advertisement.\n\nThe retro-style is re-occurring in Pulp Fiction – the evening at Jack Slim’s diner is an iconic scene in which Vincent takes Mia Wallace out on the request of Marcellus Wallace. The whole diner is a throwback to the 50s with the waiters dressed as 50s celebrities, vintage cars, retro posters and 50s music. This set was one of the most expensive in Pulp Fiction, but it is the one scene everyone can remember from the film. It is made more iconic when Vincent and Mia dance to Chuck Berry’s ‘You Never Can Tell’, which is another song Tarantino brought back.\n\nA third example is Tarantino’s use of unnecessary, gratuitous violence. Many films before Tarantino featured violence, but few made viewers watch the horrible acts of excessive gore. Somehow, an audience being made to face the violence is ‘funny’ in an uncomfortable way, mainly because this is a new concept that an audience aren’t used to: viewers are used to being shielded from blood or violent crime, but when something as horrific as the rape scene in Pulp Fiction is on display in a long shot, it makes an audience uncomfortable, but they certainly don’t forget how they were made to watch. Another example is when Mia Wallace is injected with the large needle when she overdoses. The comically large needed and small crowd watching her make this grim scene funny in a way, because it makes an audience realise how ridiculous the whole ordeal is. Tarantino has said most of his inspiration came from films of the 70s which he calls ‘The Silver Age of Hollywood’; he has said that Bonnie and Clyde is what kick-started this new era, partially due to it’s unapologetic sex scenes, and violence.\n\nTarantino uses casting to aid in creating his style. He has a stable of actors that re-appear in his films such as Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Kietel, Tim Roth and Bruce Willis to name a few. Additionally, he uses actors who’s careers are declining and ‘revives them’. The best example of where Tarantino did this is when he casted John Travolta as Vincent Vega. Tarantino also has his characters causally swear, and this language seems to fit with the characters and genre of the film. As well as this, some of the characters use racial slurs which has sparked controversy. This use of foul language was rarely seen, but Tarantino made it work, and used it to create his signature style. Profane language fitted the style of the film, adding depth to the characters.\n\nThis leads onto Tarantino’s cast of strong characters. There are strong black characters in his films, as are there strong female characters – Mia Wallace and Jackie Brown are strong females, and Jules and Marcellus are strong black characters. Tarantino’s stable of strong, powerful female and black characters made him stand out at the time, because few films represented black characters equally, and women were usually given supportive or weak roles in retro Hollywood. For example, Jules was the more moral of the two hitmen, and was more competent compared to Vincent. Jules had more authority and was presented as more intelligent than Vincent on multiple occasions. He took control in Brett’s apartment, and in the diner scene while Vincent was in the bathroom. Mia Wallace was seen to be in charge of Vincent, and frequently told him what to do; she spoke to him over an intercom, putting her in a position where she could see everything he did, and all Vincent could do was listen. Her authority was also aided by the fact that Vincent was scared to upset her, and so anger Marcellus. This challenged the usual character types seen in Hollywood, which Tarantino employs to create his auteurship.\n\nTarantino also uses dialogue-heavy sequences in all of his films – dialogue that doesn’t progress the plot in any way. A lot of what characters talk about are pop culture references. For example, Jules and Vincent talk about McDonalds, KFC and Vincent’s time in Europe. All of this doesn’t add to the film or plot, but it does add depth to the characters that makes them relatable, and more human. The conversation about fast food doesn’t stop when the two hitmen enter Brett’s apartment – Jules sees the takeout Brett is having for breakfast, and begins a conversation about fast food and pop culture; Brett tells Jules that it is a ‘Big Kahuna Burger’ – a made-up brand. This is another display of Tarantino’s auteurship – he likes to create false brands and product placement as well as real ones (like Sprite or KFC) to add to the immersion of the film world. Any cigarette in the film is ‘Red Apple Cigarettes’, which has become a widely known brand linked to Tarantino’s films. These cigarettes make a brief appearance when Jules and Vincent meet up with Marcellus after covering up Marvin’s murder.\n\nA minor point that should still be mentioned is Tarantino’s use of a McGuffin in Pulp Fiction. The briefcase has no real purpose other than it is needed to cause conflict. Whenever the briefcase is present, there is conflict: in Brett’s apartment and in the diner, the briefcase is the centre of conflict; it is what causes Jules to kill Brett and his roommates; and what allows him to gain control of the situation in the diner. An audience are never told what is the the briefcase – some think it contains diamonds, and some thinks it contains Marcellus Wallace’s soul, which would explain the band-aid on the back of his head. Some have speculated that ‘when the Devil takes your soul, he takes it from the back of your head’, hence the band-aid, and why Jules and Vincent were hired to retrieve and protect the briefcase so fiercely. This also acts as an enigma code – an audience want to know what’s in the briefcase, how it was stolen etc.\n\nAnother feature of Tarantino’s auteurship is that fact that he uses 70mm film, and, where possible, shows his film in 70mm. Not only is this expensive, but it is also unique to Tarantino. 70mm cinemas are rare to find, so using 70mm is merely a display of his wealth, and shows the extent that he will go to to maintain his aesthetic choices, and not give in to the easier digital camera.\n\nThe final and most distinct point is Tarantino’s narrative structure. He uses a structure with an episodic or chapter-like narrative in Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and Inglorious Basterds. In Pulp Fiction, the story is divided into three episodes: Jules and Vincent, Marcellus and Butch and the Bonnie Situation. The structure is jumbled and told out of order which in turn informs an audience ahead of time before events happen, such as Vincent’s death when he is sent to kill Butch (unrestricted viewpoint). Reservoir Dogs is also split into chapters for each character, which makes the timeline non-linear. The structure in these three films is perhaps the most noticeable stylistic feature, and is what made the film so popular, yet controversial.\n\nAlthough all of this seems to create a different, individual style that is unique to Tarantino, beneath the surface, Tarantino re-uses ideas from previous films. For example, Kill Bill takes a lot of inspiration from The Game of Death (Bruce Lee, 1972). The fight sequences, the scenes on the bike and even the outfit of Uma Thurman is almost identical to Bruce Lee’s. Although Tarantino is widely considered to be an auteur, he has admitted that he ‘steals from every movie ever made’, drawing inspiration from different films or pop culture to construct a deceptively original, new style.\n\nDate: 13/10/22\n\nResearch and write about the career and influence of Quentin Tarantino.\n\nEarly films\n\nTarantino had a love for films from a young age; this love of films led him to work at a video store. While working there, Tarantino worked on his first screenplays: True Romance (Quentin Tarantino, 1993) and Natural Born Killers (Oliver Stone, 1994). He also appeared as an Elvis Impersonator in The Golden Girls (Terry Hughes, 1985-1992) at this time. In 1990, Tarantino left his job to work for Cinetel (a production company), which helped him to get his script for True Romance to director, Tony Scott, who bought the rights to it.\n\nAnother early film of Tarantino’s was Reservoir Dogs (Quentin Tarantino, 1992). He starred, directed and wrote the screenplay for this film, and the profits from Reservoir Dogs’ success helped to fund his future film projects (such as Pulp Fiction (Quentin Tarantino, 1994)). Some actors that frequently star in his films began their career with Tarantino in Reservoir Dogs – actors like Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Steve Busecemi both acted in Reservoir Dogs, and appeared in other Tarantino films, such as Pulp Fiction. He has said that heist filmslike Rififi (Jules Dassin 1955) and City on Fire (Ringo Lam, 1987) were a big inspiration for Reservoir Dogs.\n\nIn 1992, Reservoir Dogs was adored by audiences at the Sundance Film Festival. Arguably, Reservoir Dogs is what kickstarted Tarantino’s career – despite it not being as popular in the US, audiences overseas adored the crime film gone-wrong.\n\nTarantino’s next hit film was Pulp Fiction. It was unique, erratic and had pop culture and violence woven into its story. The combination of three stories told out of order, with a much-loved crime/gangster genre, and many recognised and popular actors helped to make Pulp Fiction so popular. In 1995, the film won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Pulp Fiction earned over $108 million in the US at the box office, making it the first independent film to earn over $100 million at the box office, and $213 million globally. It was so successful, in fact, that it won a Palme d’Or Award in 1994 (the highest prize awarded at the Cannes Film Festival).\n\nTarantino’s influence on Hollywood – The Tarantino Effect\n\nTarantino’s use of an unusual narrative, manipulation of narrative techniques, and unique visual style has been crucial to his success. However, such a style has created a lot of controversy. Tarantino’s gratuitous violence has sparked many debates, and even had some of his films banned in different countries (From Dusk Till Dawn (Quentin Tarantino, 1996) was banned in Ireland in 1996, for featuring ‘incredible gratuitous violence’). His use of the n-word has also cause a lot of controversy, specifically, from director Spike Lee.\n\nThe most noticeable feature in Pulp Fiction is the non-linear, fragmented structure which has been used in his other films (although much more subtly). Tarantino has a preference for prolepsis, especially in films that are mainly set in the present (such as in Reservoir Dogs). This shifting in time has been named the ‘Tarantino Effect’ by critics. Another feature of the ‘Tarantino Effect’ has been his use of pop culture references, his own ‘product placement’ (the Red Apple cigarettes and Big Kahuna Burger, both seen in Pulp Fiction), cameos of himself (Jimmy in Pulp Fiction, and Mr. Brown in Reservoir Dogs), repeated use of actors (such as Harvey Keitel, Samuel Jackson and Bruce Willis) and films that seem to connect (Vincent Vega from Pulp Fiction is the brother of Vic Vega – Mr Blonde – from Reservoir Dogs). There are many aspects of the ‘Tarantino Effect’, but the aforementioned are the most recognisable in his, and other films.\n\nAnother definition of the ‘Tarantino Effect’ is the evolution of Tarantino’s career. His career essentially started with Reservoir Dogs – a small, low-budget indie film, and has ‘evolved’ from smaller-scale films like this, to Hollywood sensations. Harvey Keitel’s acting and co-producing part in Reservoir Dogs was key in getting funding much easier – it was made on a budget of $1.2 million.\n\nBecause of Reservoir Dogs’ success, Tarantino found financing his next film – Pulp Fiction – a lot easier, managing to get an $8 million budget. Pulp Fiction marks Tarantino’s transition from small, indie film to Hollywood hits. Tarantino’s biggest budget was for the production of Django Unchained (Quentin Tarantino, 2012), which is where his transition from indie films to Hollywood films is most noticeable.\n\nTarantino’s success is also seen in his cast – he has had the opportunity to work with famous actors, such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Samuel L. Jackson and Brad Pitt (to name a few). Despite positive changes in his budget and cast, his films have remained the same quality, and fairly consistent in style, which has greatly helped to establish him in Hollywood, and made the ‘Tarantino Effect’ evermore influential.\n\nThe ‘Tarantino Effect’ has been seen to influence many Hollywood films in recent years, both in the impact of indie films in Hollywood, and in narrative/style. Many directors have been influenced by Tarantino in terms of style – most commonly, by the use of shifting timelines (non-linear structure with flashback/forwards), graphic violence and pop culture references. His influence is seen in Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind (Michel Gondry, 2004), which uses a non-linear narrative, and Smokin’ Aces (Joe Carnahan, 2006), which features violence influenced by the ‘Tarantino Effect’.\n\nIn terms of filmmakers evolving from low-budget, indie films to big Hollywood films, not many have done it as well as Tarantino. Many have struggled to compete with large studios, such as Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe, as studios such as the MCU have professional marketing strategies, ‘stealing audiences’ from smaller filmmakers. This isn’t to say indie filmmakers can’t have their ‘Hollywood dream’, but competition makes it much harder.\n\nDate: 29/09/22\n\nResearch general contextual information about Pulp Fiction and its filmmakers.\n\n-Refer to the Contexts Of Film section to guide your independent research.\n\n-Present your research as either an infographic or an illustrated blog post.\n\n-Research widely and dig deep — detail will be rewarded.\n\n-Bear in mind the Core Study Areas and Additional Study Areas for this component.\n\nAll Core Study Areas:\n\n-Key Elements Of Film Form\n\n-Contexts Of Film\n\n-Aesthetics\n\n-Representation\n\n2 Additional Study Areas:\n\nAuteurship\n\nNarrative\n\nNotes on the director:\n\n-Tarantino originally wanted to be an actor\n\n-From a young age, Tarantino loved films, especially crime and gore\n\n-At 22, got a job at a video store\n\n-Worked on his first film, My Best Friend’s Birthday (Quentin Tarantino, 1987) whilst working at the video store. He directed, edited, co-wrote, co-produced and starred in the film\n\n-Similar to director Guillermo del Toro, Tarantino prefers to direct his own ‘indie’ movies, as they are more personal. These two directors do however, make Hollywood films\n\n-Repeated use of actors: Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Brad Pitt, and Leonardo DiCaprio (among others)\n\n-Inspired by the crime and gangster genre from the 30’s and 40’s. As a teen, Tarantino enjoyed a range of films, mainly watching films from his childhood – the 70s – which had a range of crime films and shootouts in Westerns\n\nTarantino’s auteurship and aesthetics Cinematography-Long takes and tracking shots that build suspense, and raise the expectation of a violent scene\n\n-Scenes from inside car boots\n\n-Corpse shots\n\nSound -Soundtracks are compilations of lesser-known songs that reflect the time period or pop culture (for example, 50s music in the 50s diner in Pulp Fiction)\n\nMise-en-Scene -Particularly in Pulp Fiction, Tarantino uses a non-linear, fragmented structure. His narrative is a key aspect of his auteurship.\n\n-Story told out of chronological order\n\n-The crime genre with ‘inappropriate humour’ given the context in the film\n\n-The theme of revenge, redemption or karma\n\n-Fake products and brands to make the film-world seem more realistic (such as ‘Red Apple Cigarettes’, or the ‘Big Kahuna Burger’ Jules steals from Brett). Also brands like McDonalds, KFC and Sprite are mentioned\n\n-Similar to the mention of McDonalds, KFC and Sprite, Tarantino uses themes, brands, objects or ideas (pop culture) that are prevalent at the time to make the film seem more real and more relatable\n\n-Black-and-white suits (easy to maintain continuity). Tarantino is able to reflect the situation with the suits, such as the clean-up-of-Marvin scene in Pulp Fiction – Vincent and Jules’ suits are bloodied and ruined after previously having been smart. In Reservoir Dogs, all the men wore suits because it was something all the actors had (therefore, it was more relatable, and it was recognisable as ‘smart’)\n\n-Gratuitous and disproportionate violence, torture scenes\n\nPerformance\n\n-Repeated use of actors (mentioned above), and occasionally, lesser-known actors. Additionally, the re-appearance of names, like Vincent Vega (Pulp Fiction) and Vic Vega (Reservoir Dogs (Quentin Tarantino (1992))\n\n-‘Foul language’, casual swearing that seems to ‘fit’ the film and context\n\nThese are reoccurring themes and features throughout Tarantino’s films, clearly showing his auteurship and clear vision of what a film should look like. His style (specifically, his use of fragmented narrative) is what makes Pulp Fiction an experimental film.\n\nRepresentation\n\nRace\n\nThe use of the n-word throughout the film was controversial. It was used often and by both black and white characters. There was also a positive outlook on race, with characters like Jules and Wallace in charge and dominant. Jules was the peacemaker and the one with common sense to change his murderous ways, and Vincent refused to change and was ready to kill both Honey Bunny and Pumpkin. This shows that he is ‘the good guy’ who is able to redeem himself, and Vincent is not, so he dies.\n\nWhen Jules and Vincent go to Brett’s apartment, Jules is portrayed as the most powerful. He jokes with Brett and his associates as he takes bites of Brett’s burger, commenting on how good it is – he momentarily sets-aside his job to casually discuss food. He is able to remain calm and in control of the situation while those he points his gun at can only sit and listen to him (also like Pumpkin in the final scene). In this scene, Vincent obeys Jules – he searches the cabinets Jules tells him to, and checks the briefcase, reporting back to Jules when he has found the briefcase and all of its contents. Later, when Vincent turns to talk to Marvin, he accidentally shoots him, which shows Vincent to be the ‘stupid one’ compared to Jules, the intelligent one. Despite Jules not being the mob boss, he is certainly one of the most powerful characters in the film.\n\nGender\n\nMia’s voice over the intercom while Vincent is lost in her house shows she has the control. Her voice adds a sexual element to this chapter, representing her as ‘mysterious’. The rumours around the ‘foot massage incident’ add to her mystery. She is powerful and dominant over Vincent (she is his boss’ wife, but also is sure of herself and her status). The camera cuts to her looking at security cameras, just showing her lips and fragments of her face. In addition, she can see Vincent, but he can’t see her – this allows her to order him to go to the intercom, so he can talk to her and he obeys. Vincent is lost and not in control – his performance shows he’s a bit on edge (he’s also on heroine). Mia is seen smoking and doing cocaine, which at the time, was seen as something a powerful man did.\n\nReception ”Against its budget of $8.5 million and about $10 million in marketing costs, Pulp Fiction wound up grossing $107.93 million at the U.S. box office, making it the first “indie” film to surpass $100 million. Worldwide, it took in nearly $213 million.”\n\nThe film was hugely successful, and not only because it was a Tarantino film – its experimental narrative made it unique and a must-watch, Tarantino opposed stereotypes, used well-known actors, a popular film genre and a niche soundtrack. All of this made it unique and shocking, which built on its reputation more and more.\n\nHowever, the film was also very controversial for its overt racism through use of the n-word. Despite Jules and Marcellus being two of the most powerful characters, the excessive use of the n-word can’t be ignored. Famous director Spike Lee has commented on the use of the word, and shown his dislike for the representation of black people in Pulp Fiction. He has said “[…] some people speak that way. But, Quentin is infatuated with that word […] I want Quentin to know that all African-Americans do not think that word is trendy or slick.” In fact, Lee and Tarantino have got into a feud over the word. Lee is not alone with this – many think 38 times is excessive, especially when it is coming from white characters. Despite the success of the film, the use of the word is definitely what caused the most conflict in opinions.\n\nDate: 15/09/22"
