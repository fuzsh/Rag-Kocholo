        "text": "Know About\n\nThe game-changing director, Quentin Tarantino, is known all over the world for his artworks. He is a screenwriter, producer, actor, and director, basically a complete package. His movies are known for popular culture, ensemble casts, nonlinear storylines, extended scenes of dialogues, and a wide variety of other movies.\n\nTarantino started his career as an independent director with a crime thriller film Reservoir Dogs in 1992. He then later made a crime comedy film, Pulp Fiction, in 1994. The director has received two Oscars for writing Django: Unchained and Pulp Fiction; and a Golden Globe Award for the Best Screenplay for 2019 Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. Later the Oscar winner made The Hateful Eight, Grindhouse, exploitation slasher film Death Proof, traditions of kung fu films and Japanese martial arts, Kill Bill: Volume 1, etc.\n\nTarantino is one of Hollywood’s best directors; still, his talent has been overlooked in his undiscovered experiences and productions. We prepared a list of movies to highlight the lesser-known projects of Tarantino.\n\nFour Rooms (1996)\n\nFour Rooms is an anthology black comedy movie co-directed and co-written by Tarantino, Alexandre Rockwell, Allison Anders, and Alexandre Rockwell. The film is loosely based on Roald Dahl’s adult short fictional writings. The movie received negative feedback from critics. Still, the part that is directed by Tarantino and Rodriguez was being praised.\n\nFour Rooms got a horrible response on Rotten Tomatoes and held an approval rating of 13% based on 45 reviews. The site’s critical remark reads: Four Room comes stocked with a ton of talent on both sides of the camera, yet unable to deliver an uninspired anthology effort.\n\nThe movie got the Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress for Madonna.\n\nThe plot of the film sets in a fictional hotel in L.A. on New Year’s Eve. It follows rookie bellhop Ted, who has four most unexpected encounters throughout the night in four different rooms.\n\nMy Best Friend’s Birthday (1987)\n\nQuentin Tarantino starring My Best Friend’s Birthday, is a lost black and white amateur movie. The movie was shot in 70 minutes and released a version of 36 minutes. The Tarantino fan can stream the film on YouTube also. The plot of the movie has a similarity with the film True Romance which was written by Tarantino.\n\nMy Best Friend’s Birthday story follows a young man who tries to do something for his friend’s birthday; however, his efforts backfire badly. It stars Tarantino in the role of Clarence Poole and Craig Hamman in the role of his best friend, Mickey. Through miscommunication and mishap, Clarence falls in love with a woman and is in a romantic style.\n\nThe Man With The Iron Fists (2012)\n\nThe Man With The Iron Fists is a martial arts movie directed following a story of lone warriors who are forced to unite and save their home of Jungle Village. The project received mixed reviews from critics. Some praised the well-choreographed martial art moves but criticized the lack of refined direction. The film collected a gross of $20.5 million at the box office.\n\nThe plot of the film is set in nineteenth-century China in the Jungle Village. It follows a blacksmith who creates deadly weapons for the clans and uses the payments to buy freedom. The Man With The Iron Fists received a 51% approval rating from 86 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 5.1.\n\nHowever, Tarantino is not involved with the project; RZA used the words “Quentin Tarantino Presents” just for the sake of publicity. Since filmmaker RZA is a good friend of Tarantino, the Oscar winner was happy to help his friend. Previously, RZA also helped the director in the Kill Bill’s musically.\n\nMany other Quentin Tarantino’s movies could not make their place well in the famous Tarantino’s project list. If you are a fan of his work, please try to watch the films mentioned above."
