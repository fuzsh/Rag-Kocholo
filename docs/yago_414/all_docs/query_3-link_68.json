        "text": "Answered\n\nBirthday party venues on Peerspace typically cost between $80 — $220 per hour.\n\nLooking for birthday surprise ideas for a best friend to celebrate one of your favorite people? We get it! Planning a birthday surprise is one of the best ways to show someone you care about them. You not only plan their birthday party, but you also go to the extra effort of hiding the surprise the whole time you’re planning, until the day of the big reveal.\n\nIf you get other friends and even family members involved, your best friend is sure to feel incredibly loved and cared for. It will be an incredible way for them to begin the next year of their life. Ahead, we’ve put together some birthday surprise ideas for your best friend so you can plan a surprise that your bestie will never forget!\n\nAs you keep reading, you’ll notice that we’ve included information about Peerspace listings that would make excellent venues for the various ideas we’re suggesting. Peerspace is the internet’s most extensive marketplace for hourly event venue rentals, with thousands of surprise birthday party-worthy venues in cities across the globe. The platform is also super simple to navigate so you can find a space to plan your best friend’s birthday surprise with little effort. So now, let’s get to the list!\n\n1. Inspire your bestie by hosting a wellness-centric yoga party\n\nWe’re starting this list of surprise birthday party ideas with a suggestion for birthday besties who need to focus on their self-care routine. Treat your best friend and other guests to an afternoon at a gorgeous local yoga studio run by a professional instructor who can provide a private yoga party. It’s a great way to celebrate your friend’s birthday and help the birthday boy or birthday girl unwind while reminding them how much you care about their wellbeing.\n\nNot sure where to go to find the perfect yoga spot for your surprise party? Then you need to hop on Peerspace! We offer you access to amazingly stylish, private, and well-equipped yoga studios in every corner of the globe. For instance, check out this light-filled studio space in Victoria, Australia. It has space for 50 guests and comes equipped with floor-to-ceiling windows, blonde wood floors, adjustable lighting, and yoga gear for your surprise birthday party event.\n\n“Beautiful studio,” shares a Peerspace reviewer. “and the host Melissa, very communicative! Would definitely book this space again.”\n\nFor our stateside readers, you can also book a venue like this beautiful midtown yoga studio in St. Louis, MO. It is a 2,500-square-foot space with room for 75 guests, perfect if the surprise party you’re planning has a big guest list! The studio provides you with a kitchenette, speakers, tables and chairs, and parking, so it’s amenity-filled as well as beautiful.\n\n2. Treat them to a luxurious at-home spa day\n\nA riff off our first surprise birthday party suggestion for more beauty-centric besties is a surprise at-home spa day. Supply the sheet masks, the pedicure materials, and everything else you need for a full day of incredible pampering. Don’t forget the snacks and drinks, and consider inviting over a few of your other friends/your besties’ closest family members to make it an even more festive occasion.\n\nAnd by the way, if you need a space that would work well for a self-planned spa day that isn’t your own home or a friend’s house, you might go ahead and rent a space like this chic Atlanta beauty studio. It’s a luxurious and chic space that boasts several double-sided salon stations, comfy seating, and adorable neon lighting. This salon will give the whole day a more professional feel while providing plenty of excuses for taking selfie after selfie!\n\nIn fact, as a Peerspace reviewer shares: “Our hostess was helpful and kind. The space was beautiful and clean, and our guests really enjoyed how instagrammable the location was!”\n\nLearn more about how and where to rent a salon space near you for a day to discover your city’s best hidden gem salon/event spaces!\n\n3. Ask all your friends to write letters to your bestie\n\nThe typical birthday card only includes a few lines of hand-written notes to the recipient, more perfunctory than anything else. A real letter of at least a few paragraphs is sure to be significantly more meaningful.\n\nTherefore, ask all your best friend’s other friends to write a letter from the heart wishing them a happy birthday. Take the opportunity to reflect on the history of their relationship and the growth they’ve experienced together over the years – stuff like that. Present the letters to your friend as a big surprise and get ready to see their face as they read all the heartfelt notes.\n\nWhat’s like an Airbnb for birthday parties? Find out here!\n\n4. Take them on a surprise trip somewhere special\n\nIs your best friend open to spontaneity and loves travel? Then taking them on a trip somewhere special is an amazing way to commemorate your friend’s birthday. In fact, it’s basically the ultimate birthday surprise idea. Just imagine how shocked and excited they’ll be when they hear about the trip you’ve planned!\n\nThough everyone has different personalities and tastes, it’s hard to imagine anyone not loving an excuse to hang out at this Hollywood Hills Mediterranean oasis. You, your bestie, and your other guests can enjoy the palm tree-hedged pool, the poolside loungers, and the antique-strewn interior. Not only that, but the host has luxury cars on-site that you can take pictures with!\n\nThis is one of those Peerspace party-perfect venues that has tons of loving reviews from past renters. As an example: “This place was amazing, gave my photos such a great look and an amazing host as well. Super fun and I will definitely be booking again.”\n\nOn the other coast, you can also opt to book this bohemian-chic bar space with Tulum vibes in Brooklyn, NYC. Its incredible decor and vibes will help your friend feel like you’ve whisked them away to an exotic beachside destination, all without leaving your city.\n\nIf you love the idea of throwing a pool party for your bestie, be sure to also check out these fun pool party food ideas to create a menu that keeps all your guests happy!\n\n5. Delight them with 24 gifts over the course of 24 hours\n\nOne of our favorite birthday surprise ideas for your best friend comes from Birthday Inspire. Give your best friend one birthday gift for every single hour of their birthday. That’s a lot of gifts, but not all of the gifts have to be something big. Just the idea that you would go to the trouble of surprising them with this many birthday gifts will make your best friend feel incredibly loved and honored on their birthday.\n\n6. If you’re a friend who lives far away – visit!\n\nPerhaps one of the best birthday surprise ideas for a best friend who lives far away is to plan a surprise visit! Your best friend will be so delighted to see you and spend time with you that any other activities will just be the cherry on top.\n\nNo matter where they’re located, book a celebratory venue through Peerspace so that your bestie doesn’t have to host their own birthday surprise party spur of the moment. There are comfy, private, and stylish Peerspace available in cities across the globe, so plan ahead, book a great one in their city, and lead the birthday person and your friends there for a gathering.\n\nOne of the many, many beautiful examples that you can book through Peerspace include this light, airy, and modern house in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles, CA. It’s available to book for private events and boasts stylish indoor space and several outdoor areas with stunning mountain and canyon views. Definitely the makings for a wonderful surprise birthday!\n\n7. Surprise them with a bouquet of balloon memories\n\nSuggested by Birthday Butler, this is “sentimental, easy to do and inexpensive,” and we love it because it really shows a lot of thought and care put into the surprise.\n\nHere’s how you execute this surprise: “Get some helium balloons and tie strings to them. Add a photograph, favorite quote or poem to the bottom of each one . . . The birthday person will see them and say something like, ‘Oooh! For me?!’ … Soon, they’ll realize these are no ordinary balloons, but rather a floating tribute of memories and favorite things!”\n\nWhat an amazing way to surprise your bestie.\n\n8. Use a piñata to hide your surprise birthday gift\n\nIf you’re throwing your friend a party, then include a piñata. However, instead of filling it with candy, put something inside that your friend would never expect to receive. This could be tickets to a concert of their favorite musician, a gift certificate to a store they love, or something else entirely – get creative!\n\nFor inspiration, here are some suggestions for filling a piñata for adults courtesy of Apartment Therapy—their ideas range from Starbucks gift cards to bottle openers, movie tickets, guitar picks, and more.\n\nAlso, having access to the internet means having access to tons of incredible purchase options in virtually every category, and that includes piñatas. Thankfully, gone are the days of going to your local party supply store and picking up a piñata in one of only a few designs. Instead, you can pretty much find piñatas in the shape of whatever item you’re envisioning, whether that’s an avocado, a champagne bottle, or a multicolored robot. (Just search the web for the object you’re thinking of and the word “piñata” to find tons of options.)\n\n9. Throw them a sweet surprise picnic party\n\nPlan a surprise picnic party and bring your friend to your local park, having them think it’s just the two of you going on a walk or something along those lines. Then, strategically guide them to the place where the rest of your friends are waiting with a beautiful picnic and decor (especially atmospheric lighting like string lights, cafe bulbs, and LED tea lights) to jump out and say “surprise!”\n\nDo you and your bestie happen to reside in SoCal? If so, we recommend you book an amazing venue like this enchanting Spanish villa courtyard in Santa Ana, CA! This gorgeous spot comes includes outdoor seating, a gorgeous pool, and fun add-on services to create the perfect environment for your friend’s surprise birthday picnic party.\n\nCheck out what a Peerspace reviewer shared after booking this sweet spot for their own birthday party: “Mesa Bella is an amazing venue! Mark, the property manager is super friendly and very helpful through the entire process! The property grounds are well taken care of, the massive koi ponds are fun to watch, the lush foliage are well kept and helps to create the upscale/tropical feel we were looking for. There is a full kitchen, gas BBQ pit, deep freezer, Spanish styled locker room restrooms, rooftop views of the OC sunset, Circle driveway leading to a grand entrance…”\n\nHoping to throw an outdoor shindig? Then you need to see our other outdoor birthday party ideas!\n\n10. Rent a limo so they can cruise around town in style\n\nSurprise your friend by pulling up to their house in a stretch limo! Then, invite them inside so the two of you (plus some more friends, if you choose) can spend a night on the town traveling in luxury and style.\n\nThis is also a great idea to combine with suggestion #14 on this list (renting a luxurious venue through Peerspace), as riding in a limo will definitely contribute to the glamorous experience. Plus, not having to drive to the venue will help to ensure that your friend is thoroughly surprised by the destination!\n\nAs an example, our friends in Seattle, WA can head to this gorgeous and unique turn-key event space in Capitol Hill after picking up their bestie in a limo. It’s a luxury bar that serves inspired cocktails and a seasonal food menu in a fun science-themed setting!\n\n11. Ensure they’re shocked by throwing a half-birthday surprise party\n\nThe last thing your friend would expect is a half-birthday surprise party, which is what makes it the ideal surprise! This one will be memorable and frankly hilarious as an unexpected birthday idea. There’s also the added bonus that they can celebrate their birthday twice this year!\n\nCheck out how a Peerspace reviewer summed up their experience here: “Excellent mixologists, unique space, great food. Jordan was an excellent host throughout the process. I’d recommend this space.”\n\n12. Plan a surprise photoshoot to remind them how amazing they are\n\nDoes your friend like to have their photo taken? Then hire a photographer and rent a professional photo studio through Peerspace. Bring your bestie for a surprise birthday photoshoot without telling them what to expect. You can also even hire someone to do your friend’s hair and makeup first! It will be a day of indulgence with beautiful photos as a souvenir for your bestie to always remember.\n\nNeed the perfect setting? Then consider booking Montmartre at Hodgepodge Studios in Philadelphia, PA! We love this space since it’s so roomy and minimal yet stylish. The host also provides multiple set designs, props, and a changing area to make your bestie feel very comfortable and pampered. Birthday surprise ideas for a best friend like this ensure they feel like the superstar you know they are!\n\nAlong with the venue, gift your bestie these creative birthday photoshoot ideas for adults so they feel inspired!\n\n13. Conspire with your other friends to plan a birthday flash mob\n\nOkay, planning a birthday flash mob for your best friend will require quite a bit of coordination and secrecy. However, it’ll be worth it to see the shock and excitement on your friend’s face!\n\nBegin by discreetly gathering a group of enthusiastic flash mob participants. Choose a location with sentimental value for your friend or that suits the surprise element, making sure it can accommodate the size of your mob. Timing is also crucial, so make sure that the planned time, date, and location of your flash mob performance aligns with your friend’s schedule.\n\nNext, put together a simple yet energetic routine that everyone in the group can easily follow and memorize. If possible, take into account your bestie’s taste in music and dance as you plan. Once your flash mob routine is finalized, rehearse it with your group of friends to minimize unexpected issues on the big day. Use a group text to communicate about the plan, keeping everyone in the loop while maintaining the element of surprise.\n\nOn the day of the flash mob, you might want to have someone on hand to capture the priceless moment on camera and immortalize your friend’s amazement. The effort and thoughtfulness that have clearly gone into your planning are sure to warm your best friend’s heart and put a smile on their face.\n\n14. Surprise them by renting a luxurious wellness retreat space\n\nOne of the coolest things about finding a venue on Peerspace is the array of options that the platform can connect you to in your area. From small and affordable venues like apartments and backyards to luxurious spaces like mansions and villas that offer tons of amenities and incredible views. Peerspace has it all!\n\nIf you have the budget to accommodate it, you might tell your friend that you’re renting a standard party venue, but then surprise them when they show up to the location of the party and realize the venue is actually an unbelievably stunning space.\n\nCurious about examples of the kinds of highly luxurious retreat spaces we’re talking about? One of our favorites is Russi Retreat, a luxury indulgence home in West Palm Beach, FL. We love how it’s a space that combines wellness with fun to ensure a truly bespoke experience. While here, you and your bestie can enjoy the handmade barrel sauna, the cold water plunge pool, the hot tub, the games room, the tiki bar, the outdoor theater with surround sound, and more. It’s kind of like enjoying several birthday parties in one glamorous spot!\n\nSearch for birthday party venues near you on Peerspace and see what kind of stunning retreat spaces are available in your area! It’s your best bet for birthday surprise ideas for a best friend and any other event planning you’re doing.\n\n15. Be sure to delegate tasks to other friends when you can\n\nMarie Claire’s advice about throwing a great surprise party is “delegate, delegate, delegate.” They note that “planning a party can be a lot of fun, but it can also be a lot of work and often other people will want to help so let them as it takes some of the pressure off you on the night and helps everyone get into the party spirit.”\n\nFor instance, instead of hosting the party at your own place, you might ask if you can host it at a friend’s house, instead. This will save you considerable energy, especially when it comes to cleaning up after the party.\n\nBirthday surprise ideas for a best friend: conclusion\n\nPlanning a surprise party for a friend is a wonderful undertaking. But with these birthday surprise ideas for a best friend and an amazing Peerspace venue, it can be challenging to pull off!\n\nSo grab these surprise birthday party ideas, book a sensational Peerspace party venue, and dazzle the guest of honor!
