        "text": "Java Platform as a Service (PaaS) Leader Continues to Deepen Its Technical Bench Strength; Grows U.S. Headquarters in Boston\n\nBOSTON, MA. -- March 15, 2011 -- CloudBees, the innovation leader in cloud computing for Java, today named John Vigeant, a 10-year server and open source software veteran from Citrix Systems and XenSource, to Vice President of Business Development. In this role, he is responsible for expanding the CloudBees ecosystem and establishing partnerships with major IT companies looking to extend into the Platform as a Service (PaaS) market. Vigeant's appointment further grows the company's U.S. headquarters in Boston, where CloudBees will be building out its sales and marketing team.\n\nVigeant is the latest in a string of top talent that CloudBees has attracted in the last couple of months. Recent 'Bees' joining the company's stellar engineering team include: Ben Walding, CTO and long-serving operations manager of Codehaus; Paul Sandoz, formerly of Sun Microsystems, a member of the GlassFish team and co-specification lead of JAX-RS and Jersey; and Stephen Connolly, one of the original committers on Jenkins/Hudson, an avid contributor on Codehaus and an Apache Maven PMC member. Paul and Stephen will contribute to Jenkins and work on CloudBees' Jenkins continuous integration offerings. Ben will lead the forge effort on DEV@cloud, the company's integrated service to develop and build in the cloud.\n\n\"I am pleased to welcome this talented group to CloudBees. John's proven track record in establishing high value, strategic partnerships will be critical to CloudBees as we build out our partner ecosystem, while Ben, Paul and Stephen further strengthen our already strong and accomplished engineering team,\" said Sacha Labourey, CloudBees founder and CEO. \"CloudBees has been on a fast track since we emerged from stealth last year, and the contributions of our newest team members will help accelerate our growth and customer traction.\"\n\nThe CloudBees Platform, the only develop-to-deploy PaaS for Java, serves more than 4,500 customers. To date, over 200,000 Hudson/Jenkins build minutes have been logged on DEV@cloud and over 21,000 application deployments have been launched on RUN@cloud, which handles the functions of an \"application server in the cloud.\"With the CloudBees Platform, developers have everything they need to quickly and easily develop and deploy applications in the cloud-without having to purchase, configure and maintain hardware, and without having to program applications for a specific underlying infrastructure service (IaaS).\n\nVigeant joins CloudBees from Citrix, where he was one of five key founding team members of the XenClient project. In this role, he was responsible for business plan development functions that ranged from funding all the way to executing commercial license/OEM agreements with all the major notebook manufacturers. Vigeant came to Citrix through its 2007 acquisition of XenSource, where he oversaw the company's most strategic business development and OEM relationships with companies like Hewlett Packard, Dell and Citrix. Prior to XenSource, Vigeant was at Ximian, the Linux desktop and software management startup acquired by Novell.\n\n\"I am very excited to join CloudBees. Cloud is undeniably the next big wave in IT, and PaaS is shaping up to be the most strategic technology layer of the cloud,\" said Vigeant. \"CloudBees has an amazing team with deep middleware, business and entrepreneurial experience, and is well positioned to be a key player in the PaaS market.\"\n\nAdditional Online Resources\n\nOverview of the CloudBees Platform, including DEV@cloud and RUN@cloud\n\nSign up for the CloudBees platform\n\nFollow @CloudBees on Twitter\n\nRead the CloudBees blog\n\nAbout CloudBees, Inc.\n\nCloudBees (https://cloudbees.com ) is the only cloud company focused on servicing the complete lifecycle of cloud application development and deployment - without any servers, any virtual machines or any IT staff.
