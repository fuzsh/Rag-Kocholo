These decisions are never taken lightly, but are necessary to build the strongest foundation possible for the future.”\n\n[RELATED: Citrix Parent CEO: 15 Percent Of Workforce Cut, Layoffs ‘Designed To Strengthen’ CSG]\n\nCitrix Layoffs\n\nIn his post, Krause said “many of those roles, namely in Operations, Security and IT functions, we are working with partners who will rehire many of those individuals to continue providing outsourced services to Cloud Software Group.”\n\nA CSG spokesperson told CRN that the company cut about 1,000 employees worldwide across business units and corporate teams. About 500 of those employees should get “rehired in an outsourced capacity.”\n\nThis latest round of layoffs comes exactly a year after CSG cut 15 percent of its workforce, thousands of jobs, with plans for Citrix to focus on its top 1,000 customers and leave mid-tier and commercial accounts for service and support by solution providers.\n\nCitrix has about 13,000 partners worldwide, according to CRN’s 2023 Channel Chiefs.\n\nIn his post, Krause said the first full year of business for CSG – created in September 2022 when investment firms Vista Equity Partners and Evergreen Coast Capital took Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based Citrix private for $16.5 billion and merged it with Palo Alto, Calif.-based Tibco – left him “pleased with our progress” and “highly optimistic about our future.” CSG’s customer retention and financial results for the first fiscal year came “in ahead of plan.”\n\nCSG’s other subsidiaries include XenServer, NetScaler, ShareFile, ibi and Jaspersoft.\n\nMore than 100 million users worldwide use CSG offerings, according to the vendor.\n\nKrause said he wants “to build a $20+ billion diversified software company that develops, sells, and supports mission critical products that serve enterprises globally.”\n\nIn 2024, he wants CSG to “continue to simplify our internal processes, programs, and systems with more streamlined and centralized operations and “better align our go-to-market functions and resources with the strategy of the business units they support.”\n\nHe also sees room for improvement in further focusing CSG’s “product roadmaps on investing in the innovation that best meets our customers’ needs,” according to the post.\n\nLinkedIn users who posted about their departure from CSG include:"
