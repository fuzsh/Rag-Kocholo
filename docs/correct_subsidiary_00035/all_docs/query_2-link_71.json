        "text": "Hi guys\n\nTrying to understand the citrix flagship product and i am trying to connect the dots with other virtualization products like vmware and microsoft.\n\nXenApp is more of App virtualization and XenDesktop is more of Desktop Virtualization while XenServer is more like vmware and hyper-V right?\n\nIf XenDesktop is for Desktop Virtualization, it means i creates VM’s and then publish it out to the users? and as far as i understand the users connect to the vm’s through the receiver or the web interface called the store?\n\nBut still the users connecting via a laptop will still need an OS installed on it for them to even use the published VM so whats the marketing point here. please thats what i need to know\n\ncan xenapp also do desktop virtualization?\n\nXenServer is a virtual server hypervisor. Equate to VMWare, Hyper-V, etc.\n\nXenApp , formerly known as Presentation Server, allows you to access apps/desktops sitting on a server. Think Remote Desktop Services on steroids (it actually sits on top of RDS and you’ll need RDS CALs in addition to the XenApp CALs).\n\nXenDesktop is a VDI solution (compare to VMWare View). Instead of using a shared desktop from a server (XenApp) you’re hosting multiple virtual desktops for users to access. This allows more BYOD use since the work environment is still completely controlled and managed, regardless if users are sitting at their own computer, a company computer, a thin client, or a tablet.\n\nAlso, there’s XenClient , which is a hypervisor that runs on the end-user system as opposed to the server. It allows for offline usage of virtual desktops.\n\nAs to your question about XenApp, it’s desktop virtualization is akin to running multiple users on an RDS server. You’re all hitting the same system. If an app is installed, or upgraded, for one user, it’s done for all users.\n\nFor small companies, XenApp (or just Win 2012’s RDS) may be the way to go. XenDesktop requires a lot more infrastructure and has a much higher cost associated.\n\nEDIT: Added links.\n\nEDIT2: You may also want to take a look at Citrix’s VDI-in-a-Box product if you’re a smaller shop.\n\nThanks Kyle\n\nMaybe i missed this part from your answer.\n\nHow do the users connect to the VM’s on the Xendesktop server.\n\nFor instance, i have a laptop and need to connect to one of the VM’s on the XenDesktop. Do i need an OS installed on my laptop first? The reason i am asking is because i want to know the benefit.\n\nIf i need an OS installed on my laptop. it means i need to license that OS as well as the VM i am connecting to.\n\nCorrect, you have to have an OS installed on the client hardware. Since Citrix is device agnostic the underlying hardware / OS can be a wide assortment of options. That is what makes Citrix XenApp / XenDesktop so good. So you can access the same “desktop” from your Windows OS home machine, business machine, iPad, iPhone, Chromebook, Android device, Thin client, etc. You have to have an underlying OS with Citrix Receiver which then launches the connection, but what that underylying OS is can be a wide range.\n\nSo, using your example above of having a laptop, yes you would need an OS installed on the laptop first. This could be Windows, some flavor of Unix (with Receiver support), Max OSX… something.\n\nThe benefit is not (entirely) in saving costs. What it does do is provide a secure method of accessing your “workspace” that is in a central location from (almost) any device available while providing excellent administration capabilities (with a bunch of other benefits).\n\nCorrect.\n\nAnd just to clarify, XenApp and XenDesktop CAN be a huge cost savings. It’s all dependent on what is needed and used inthe environment. For example, in my environment we use XenApp and I would argue that it’s a HUGE cost savings from doing it the traditional Thick client way.\n\nWhy?\n\n90% of our in office workstaitons are thin clients that cost $270 apiece. NIce, but the big savings on those thin clients is not just the initial purchase, but rather it’s the fact that I pick thin clients that rarely or even almost never need updated during their lifespan which ranges from 5 - 7 years (with some being closer to 10 years). That’s a huge administrative cost savings. And when configured right they can truly be set it and forget it, I plug them in, turn them on, walk away. Doing an update is as easy as updating 8 servers (XenApp) instead of 250 workstations.\n\nNote: I used to work for a consulting company that was a reseller of Citrix.\n\nThe other thing to take into consideration is licensing - if you’re moving to XenDesktop, not only do you have XD licensing, but now you have Windows VDA License and Server CALs on top of what you already have (because you know anything that talks to AD M$ sticks a price on) - and if you’re wanting to do full productivity in your VDI, you’re going to have to have an office product, so unless you’re going OpenOffice, you’re gonna have M$ licensing for every desktop for Office as well."
