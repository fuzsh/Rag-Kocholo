        "text": "A Unified Portfolio: Citrix Products Renamed\n\nWe have been a Citrix Ready Partner for over 20 years, so we stay on top of all things Citrix. As a recognized leader in App and Desktop Virtualization, we are proud to be a long-standing partner with Citrix that enhances and simplifies printing, scanning, and user management in the Citrix Workspace environment.\n\nCitrix underwent a massive portfolio change when they changed all of their Citrix product names. They had hinted at the name change, but now it is official. Every product in the Citrix Workspace, Networking, and Analytics portfolios has changed in order to unify their products and create a more cohesive brand. The aim is to make the solutions more accessible and flexible for customers and simplify how users view the products. Drawn together under the undeniably cohesive Citrix branding, this is a push to cease thinking of the Citrix products as individual free-standing solutions.\n\nCitrix Workspace Products\n\n\"Citrix Workspace will become one unified, contextual, secure offering. Citrix Workspace offers a user-centric experience where everything you need to work is in one unified app, with access and performance made simple based on user context and IT-designed conditions.\"\n\nPreviously Named:\n\nNew Name:\n\nSharefile Citrix Content Collaboration XenMobile Citrix Endpoint Management XenApp secure browser Citrix Secure Browser XenServer Citrix Hypervisor XenApp Citrix Virtual Apps Xen Desktop Citrix Virtual Desktops Citrix Receiver Citrix Workspace App\n\nCitrix Networking Products\n\n\"The extensive Citrix Networking portfolio, pieces of which were formerly called NetScaler and Cedexis, will expand further into software-defined networking. Citrix will now be the primary name in app delivery, with trusted security and visibility through intelligent analytics.\"\n\nPreviously Named:\n\nNew Name:\n\nNetscaler ADC\n\nCitrix ADC\n\nNetscaler SD-WAN\n\nCitrix SD-WAN\n\nNetscaler App Security + Netscaler Firewall + Netscaler Web App Security\n\nCitrix Web App Firewall\n\nNetscaler Unified Gateway + Netscaler Access Gateway\n\nCitrix Gateway\n\nNetscaler Management and Analytics System\n\nCitrix Application Delivery Management\n\nNetscaler Secure Web Gateway\n\nCitrix Secure Web Gateway\n\nCedexis Platform\n\nCitrix Intelligent Traffic Management\n\nCitrix Analytics Products\n\n\"Citrix Analytics applies machine learning to provide user behavior analytics and proactive security insights. Citrix Analytics collects data across the portfolio, generating actionable insights enabling administrators to proactively handle user and application security threats, improve application performance, and support continuous operations.\"\n\nCitrix Partnership - A Citrix Ready Partner for 20+ Years\n\nAs a Citrix Ready partner, Tricerat offers unique, remote desktop printing solutions to extend and enhance the printing experience for Citrix customers. With our patented technology, a system admin can build printers effortlessly, print in Citrix Virtual Desktops and Citrix Virtual Apps, eliminate scanner driver management, and gain centralized control over profile management.\n\nTricerat's Citrix Ready solutions are able to accomplish the following:\n\nEliminate print driver management\n\nIncrease performance by reducing login times and spooler crashes\n\nDecrease time spent managing print servers by reducing compatibility issues\n\nRemove the complexity and confusion in enterprise print management\n\nAllow end users to print from any device, in any location, to any printer\n\nPrint in Citrix Virtual Apps, Citrix Endpoint Management, Citrix Virtual Desktops, VDI sessions, iOS/Android/Thin clients, Google Cloud print, Follow Me, secure print, and more\n\nWhen out-of-the-box functionality does not fit, Tricerat and Citrix work better together. Adding Triceratâ€™s pioneer print technology to the Citrix Products virtual mix achieves printing success, no matter the client type or mobile device your workforce is on."
