I can't seem to find a defenitive yes / no answers so I thought I'd ask the ServerFault community this simple question:\n\nDoes XenServer (in any version) support Storage migration such as VMWare's Storage VMotion capability, or Hyper-V's storage migration ?\n\nI'm trying to do a comparative study of all platforms but I can't find a website (preff. Citrix supported or any other \"legit\" source) where it say's a defenitive yes or no.\n\nAnyone able to answer this one for me ?\n\nCheers !"
