So I have to keep and XP netbook about to do management.\n\nEvery time I get a new Ubuntu Server ISO I see that it comes with something called OpenStack.\n\nDoes this mean I could replace Citrix XenServer with an OpenStack based system?\n\nHere are the key features I use:\n\nBooting VMs off of iSCSI hosted on a Synology NAS\n\nSnapshotting VM disks before upgrades to do roll backs\n\nCloning VMs off of those snapshots\n\nOverprovisioning RAM (each VM thinks it has it's own 3GB of RAM, but it all comes from a shared pool)\n\nPCI express passthrough of devices from host to VM (TV tuners at the moment)\n\nResource monitoring of the host and VMs (CPU, RAM, HDD, NET)\n\nSend restart and shutdown requests to the VMs without using the command line\n\nCreate single file backups of VMs including metadata.\n\nAll of those things I can do with the GUI (except 5, PCI passthrough requires manual hacking of the VM host file)\n\nCan I do all that with OpenStack?\n\nDoes it have a web interface instead of a fat client?\n\nI once tried hosting my VMs on Ubuntu Server with KVM and some sort of VM management tool from the Software Centre.\n\nIt was awful.\n\nThis isn't that is it? Or maybe it's a lot better now. (that was back in 2010 or 2011 I think)"
