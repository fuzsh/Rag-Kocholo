        "text": "When assessing the pros and cons of Citrix XenServer compared to VMware vSphere ESXi, the first thing to note is that these two software systems are developed and supported by different companies. The VMware vSphere ESXi is developed by VMwareÂ Inc.,Â whereasÂ XenServerÂ isÂ developedÂ byÂ Citrix.\n\nThough they perform similar roles, they do have a few distinct differences which make them unique. The main difference between the two is the intended usage of the software. The CitrixÂ XenServer is used by personal users and small to medium-sized businesses, while VMware vSphere ESXi is only intended for small to medium-sized businesses and is not structured for personal use.\n\nTechnicalÂ Specifications\n\nBoth of these software programs run the Bare Metal (Type 1) hypervisor type and support x86 and x64 architecture. Though they support various types of virtualization such as hardware-assisted virtualization and paravirtualization, only VMware vSphere ESXi does support full virtualization. Neither support operating system virtualization, which you can learn more about in our article on VMwareÂ vSphereÂ BestÂ Practices.\n\nBoth software suites support a variety of storage options. The difference between them, when it comes to virtualization, is that VMware does support FCoE and SSD for Swap and does not support USB, SATA, SAS, NFS, iSCSIâwhich are all supported by Citrix XenServer. Both of them support DAS, FC, and NAS storage while neither of them supports eSATA or RDM. Both systems have also gained lots of users in education, financial services, healthcare, and the government.\n\nRelated read: What are the main advantages of Citrix XenServer?\n\nCitrix Xenserver Vs. Vmware vSphere Pricing\n\nThe Citrix XenServer and VMware vSphere ESXi pricing comparison offer a few interesting insights into the different business models that they have adopted. XenServer is open source and free and does provide per-server licensing.Â\n\nVMware, on the other hand, requires a proprietary license and is licensed per processor. Both products do have a substantial client following dotted all over the globe irrespective of their pricing structure.\n\nVirtualÂ MachineÂ Limits\n\nBoth these software programs have a virtual disk size of 2000 GB, but the RAM per virtual machine does vary with VMwareÂ since it offers a staggering 1024 GB while the Citrix XenServer offers 128 GB per virtual machine.\n\nThe XenServer has a total of 16 virtual CPUs per Virtual Machine (VCPUs) and VMware has double this, at 32 VCPUs. XenServer provides a total of 7 Virtual Network Interface Cards (NICs) per virtual machine and 16 virtual disks per virtual machine. On the other hand, VMware vSphere ESXi has a total of 10 virtual NICs per virtual machine and a whopping 62 virtual disks per virtual machine.\n\nVirtualÂ NetworkÂ InterfaceÂ âÂ VMwareÂ vSphere\n\nÂ\n\nÂ VirtualÂ NetworkÂ InterfaceÂ âÂ CitrixÂ XenServer\n\nHost Server Limits\n\nVMwareÂ vSphere has a total of 120 (hundred and twenty) virtual machines per host with the RAM per host being at 2048 GB with a total of 2048 virtual disks per host.\n\nXenServer has a total pack of 75 (seventy-five) virtual machines per host with a RAM of 1024GB per host and 512 virtual disks per host.\n\nBoth systems have 160 (hundred and sixty) logical CPUs per host with the VMware capable of having a total of 2048 virtual CPUs per host. However, XenServer does not have any virtual CPUs on the host.Â\n\nAlso Read: VMware vSphere Best Practices\n\nVirtualization Management Features\n\nOne area where these programs tend to differ - and to a large extent explains the disparity in acceptance and usage levels between the two - is virtualization management.\n\nThe only key management feature that is supported by both software programs is Thin Provisioning.\n\nWhile VMware does not support Asset Management and Configuration Mapping, XenServer does support these two management features in addition to Thin Provisioning but does not support key features such as Dynamic Resource Allocation, Failover, and Live Migration. These three important features are on the other hand fully supported by VMware vSphere ESXi.\n\nIt should be noted though that if you are looking for other additional features such as Automated Workflows, High Availability (HA), Maintenance Mode, Shared Resource Pools and VM Backup / Restore then it is advisable to try out other software programs such as VMwareÂ vSphereÂ Essentials.\n\nBecome a Cloud Computing Professional\n\n101KCloud Job Roles Available Worldwide\n\n23.1%Annual Growth Rate\n\nAWS Solutions Architect\n\nLifetime access to 50 hours of e-learning content\n\n16 live demos of AWS services\n\nCloud Architect\n\nGet access to an MS Azure exam voucher for any one Azure course\n\nEarn a course completion badge/certificate on the MS Learn portal\n\nprevNext\n\nHere's what learners are saying regarding our programs:\n\nMario Scott\n\nSolutions Manager , DealerOps\n\nTransitioning from a cloud engineer role at, I saw the potential in DevOps and sought career growth. Lacking necessary skills, I enrolled in an AWS certification course to upskill. Now at DealerOps as a DevOps engineer, my salary rose by 50%. The hands-on labs were invaluable, boosting my confidence and enhancing my professional capabilities.\n\nRolly Hernando\n\nMy experience with Simplilearn has been great. I thoroughly enjoyed the course. I liked the Azure and AWS classes. I am grateful to all the instructors. The self-learning classes and practice labs helped me understand the concepts and provided in-depth knowledge.\n\nprevNext\n\nNot sure what youâre looking for?View all Related Programs\n\nSupportedÂ HostÂ OperatingÂ Systems\n\nThe next area that differentiates the two is supported host operating systems. Without a doubt, the Achilles heel of VMware vSphere is the number of host operating systems supported by the program.\n\nVMware vSphere does only support MS-DOS and Free BSD as hosts.\n\nOn the other hand, Citrix XenServer does support a plethora of host operating systems such as Novell Linux Desktop, Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS, Linux ES, Linux WS, and Red Hat Linux. Other OS supported include Windows 2000 Professional and Server, Windows 98 and 95, Windows Me, Windows NT Server, Windows NT Terminal Server, Windows NT Workstation, Windows Server 2003 Enterprise, Web and Standard Editions and Windows XP Home and Professional editions.\n\nSupportedÂ GuestÂ OperatingÂ Systems\n\nOn this front, the Citrix XenServer vs. VMware vSphere ESXi battle is relatively even as they both support the following guest operating systems: Novell Linux Desktop, Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS, Red Hat Linux ES, Red Hat Linux WS ,Red Hat Linux, Windows 2000 Professional , Windows 2000 Server, Windows 98 , Windows 95, Windows Me, Windows NT Server, Windows NT Terminal Server, Windows NT Workstation, Windows Server 2003 Enterprise, Windows 2003 Web , Windows 2003 Standard, Windows XP Professional, and Windows XP Home Edition.\n\nThe exception, however, is that VMware supports MS-DOS, Sun Java Desktop System, and Solaris x86 platform edition as guest operating systems, while Citrix XenServer does not support any of these three operating systems either as a host or guest operating systems.\n\nFind the Right AWS Course\n\nSimplilearn's AWS courses offer a comprehensive pathway for professionals aiming to master Amazon Web Services and enhance their career prospects in cloud computing.
