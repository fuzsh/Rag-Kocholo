        "text": "Citrix Systems recently closed its acquisition of XenSource, the shepherd for the open source Xen hypervisor and a leading provider of commercial solutions based on it. The acquisition plunged Citrix into the middle of the red-hot server virtualization market and spread the company's virtualization portfolio across most of the compute side of the IT infrastructure. Forrester believes that this acquisition strengthens the server-focused solutions previously delivered by XenSource but not to the degree that it changes its relative position versus VMware or Microsoft. However, we expect the desktop virtualization portion of its portfolio to benefit the most from the acquisition, bolstering Citrix' already strong leadership position.\n\nWant to read the full report?\n\nThis report is available for individual purchase ($1495).\n\nForrester helps business and technology leaders use customer obsession to accelerate growth.
