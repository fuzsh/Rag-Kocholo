        "text": "XenServer presents a compelling alternative to VMware, particularly for organizations concerned with rising costs. It offers competitive virtualization features, robust security, and excellent Citrix integration, at a lower total cost of ownership (TCO). XenServer has saved many organizations millions of dollars each by transitioning their fleet of hypervisor hosts to XenServer.\n\nFor customers evaluating a switch from VMware for Citrix workloads on their existing hardware, XenServer presents an economical value proposition to drastically reduce operating costs. Be sure to review the XenServer HCL as part of the evaluation process or reach out to us and we will gladly assist.\n\nXenServer maintains a hardware compatibility list (HCL) for CPUs, GPUs, NICs, servers, storage controllers, and storage platforms available here. The list is continually updated. Should you have any questions regarding hardware support, please do not hesitate to reach out to us, and we will work to get you the answer.\n\nYes, XenServer is well-equipped to handle graphics-intensive applications and pioneered GPU virtualization in partnership with NVIDIA. It supports GPU passthrough and vGPU technologies, allowing for efficient sharing of GPU resources among virtual machines while supporting live migration (XenMotion) between hosts. This capability makes XenServer ideal for deploying virtual desktops that require high-end graphics performance, such as those used in design, engineering, and multimedia applications. This capability has allowed organizations to centrally locate their 3D design workstations to reduce costs, increase security, and reduce the risks of data leakage.\n\nSeveral Citrix license editions provide an entitlement to Citrix Hypervisor (a rebranded version of XenServer), supporting up to Citrix Hypervisor 8.2 LTSR which goes end-of-support June 25th, 2025. XenServer 8 and onward is a newer, separate product and is not included in Citrix license entitlements and must be purchased. XenServer 8 Premium is presently on offer until December 1, 2024 free of charge, for customers to trial and transition to the next generation hypervisor. For more details, please visit here.\n\nEnvironments running Citrix Hypervisor will continue to remain under support until the end-date of the published product lifecycle. Customers who elect to remain with XenServer will want to upgrade prior to this date and purchase a XenServer Premium subscription. Until December 1, 2024, XenServer 8 Premium is available as a free upgrade up until the end-of-support date of Citrix Hypervisor 8.2. For more details, please visit here. Ferroque is available to discuss options, pricing, and provide migration support. Please do not hesitate to book a chat.\n\nXenServer 8 Premium has tiered SRP of $440-$875 per CPU socket per year as of March 2024. Please refer to official vendor pricing documentation here for the latest information. Ferroque is available to discuss options, pricing, and provide migration support. This pricing represents significant savings over other hypervisors. Please do not hesitate to book a chat."
