        "text": "Enables easier virtualization management and broader integration with enterprise systems\n\nNote: ESJ’s editors carefully choose vendor-issued press releases about new or upgraded products and services. We have edited and/or condensed this release to highlight key features but make no claims as to the accuracy of this vendor's statements.\n\nCitrix Systems, Inc. has released Citrix XenServer 5.5, a major upgrade issued just 75 days after Citrix made the full enterprise-class XenServer platform available for unlimited production deployment at no charge. Unlike basic hypervisors that have been free for years, XenServer offers powerful features such as centralized multi-node management, built-in storage, and full live motion.\n\n“Making XenServer free was not a one-time publicity move. It was an integral part of our strategy to accelerate the rate of virtualization adoption and address the more than 75 percent of servers that still have not been virtualized today,” said Peter Levine, senior vice president and general manager, virtualization management division, Citrix Systems. “The overwhelming download numbers we have seen in the last two months demonstrate that many customers are not happy with the growing cost and complexity of their existing virtualization solutions. By combining the free XenServer with the advanced management capabilities in Citrix Essentials, customers now have a proven alternative that meets all the requirements for enterprise-class virtualization at a fraction of the cost.”\n\nXenServer 5.5 adds new features that enable easier virtualization management and broader integration with enterprise systems. The latest version adds consolidated backup, enhanced conversion and search tools, Active Directory integration, and expanded guest support for virtually every version of Windows and Linux operating systems.\n\nAlso available today is release 5.5 of Citrix Essentials for XenServer and Hyper-V, providing advanced virtualization management capabilities for customers using Citrix XenServer or Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V. Citrix Essentials 5.5 enhances both of these high-growth virtualization platforms by adding expanded storage integration, automated lab and stage management and dynamic workload balancing.\n\nThe new XenServer 5.5 release is immediately available for download at http://www.citrix.com/freexenserver and other download sites. Citrix Essentials 5.5 for XenServer and Hyper-V are also available immediately for purchase or a 30-day trial version at http://www.citrix.com/essentials. Suggested pricing for Citrix Essentials starts at $2,500 per server, regardless of the number of processors."
