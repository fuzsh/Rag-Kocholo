Three decades later, that’s even more true than ever.\n\nIt’s what drives us to create technology that transcends the constraints of time, place, infrastructure, networks, and devices. And it’s the reason thousands of organizations around the world trust us to keep their apps available, their data safe, and their people productive—wherever and whenever work happens.\n\nAs the world of work is constantly changing, we’re committed to helping organizations stay agile to new ways of working, innovate through change, and move at the speed of their own ambition. And we believe a powerful employee experience means people can claim the space they need.\n\nHow do we do it? By ensuring your employees always have fast, easy access to the resources they need to do their best work, no matter where the job takes them or what's happening in the world around them.\n\nThe people behind our progress\n\nAt Citrix, we believe organizational strength stems from the success of individuals. In giving people the freedom to do what they love and be who they want to be. In whatever size, shape, or form that may take."
