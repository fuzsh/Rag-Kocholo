Xenserver was the previous version of Citrix Hypervisor.\n\nyou can see they provide both softwares, but i feel like it does the exact same thing, but then why call them differently and provide both?\n\nXenserver last version was 7.6 while the 8.0 version of the same Hypervisor is now called Citrix Hypervisor. Citrix supports multiple versions of their Hypervisor and currently only have one long term service release.\n\nSource: Here\n\nCitrix Hypervisor is the new name of XenServer, starting at Citrix Hypervisor 8.0. The previous version was XenServer 7.6.\n\nThe technology you trust from XenServer, the high-performance hypervisor optimized for virtual app and desktop workloads and based on the Xen Project hypervisor, is now Citrix Hypervisor.\n\nSource: https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/xenserver\n\nThey are not the quite same thing. In other words, XenServer is the name for older versions (7.6 and earlier) while Citrix Hypervisor is the name for newer versions (since 8.0)."
