        "text": "XenServer is now an entitlement of the Citrix for Private Cloud, Citrix Universal Hybrid Multi Cloud, and Citrix Platform License subscriptions for running your workloads.\n\nCitrix customers that have not yet transitioned to these new subscriptions can request to participate in a no-cost promotion for 10,000 XenServer Premium Edition socket licenses. Just like the free entitlement of Citrix Hypervisor for Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops and Citrix DaaS, these XenServer socket licenses can be used to support your workloads.\n\nThe duration of the promotional licenses is co-termed with the duration of your current or upcoming Citrix subscription. For example, if you have 1 year and 5 months left of your subscription, the promo licenses will be valid for 1 year and 5 months. If you renew your subscription during the promo period for 3 years, your promo licenses will be valid for those additional 3 years.\n\nGet started today!\n\nStart leveraging XenServer today, on us\n\nIf you purchased a new Citrix subscription after June 3rd, great news! Your XenServer entitlement is included and you can allocate XenServer licenses from your MyCitrix Account.\n\nIf you have not yet transitioned to the new Citrix subscriptions, or purchased a new Citrix subscription prior to June 3rd: an active request is required. Get in touch with your Citrix Sales representative or Citrix Channel partner, who will be able to complete your registration and delivery of licenses. If you donâ€™t have a partner, please use the partner locator.\n\nNext steps\n\nHow to benefit from XenServer long-term\n\nAfter your promo sockets expire, to continue using XenServer you need to renew the subscription for the required socket count. Note that the pricing is per socket, not core. This allows you to use powerful CPUs with a high core count, without having to pay extra on your server virtualization subscription.\n\nThe new XenServer 8 - the successor to Citrix Hypervisor 8.2 - will only recognize XenServer socket licenses. Citrix Hypervisor 8.2 will continue to recognize Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops or Citrix DaaS licenses until its End Of Life on 25th of June 2025."
