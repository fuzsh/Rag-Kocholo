        "text": "What’s new\n\nA goal of Citrix is to deliver new features and product updates to Citrix DaaS customers when they are available. New releases provide more value, so there’s no reason to delay updates. Rolling updates to Citrix DaaS are released approximately every three weeks.\n\nThis process is transparent to you. Initial updates are applied to Citrix internal sites only and are then applied to customer environments gradually. Delivering updates incrementally in waves helps ensure product quality and maximize availability.\n\nIt is possible that the updates mentioned in this documentation are being rolled out and are not accessible to all customers at the same time.\n\nFor details about the Service Level Agreement for cloud scale and service availability, see Service Level Agreement. To monitor service interruptions and scheduled maintenance, see the Service Health Dashboard.\n\nVirtual Delivery Agents (VDAs)\n\nVDAs for Windows machines generally are released at the same time as the Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops product.\n\nFor information about new VDA and HDX features, see the What’s new and Known issues articles for the current Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops release.\n\nFor information about VDA platforms and features that are no longer supported, see Deprecation. That article also includes platforms and features that will not be supported in a future release (such as which operating systems support VDA installation).\n\nImportant:\n\nIf the Personal vDisk (PvD) component was ever installed on a VDA, that VDA cannot be upgraded to version 1912 LTSR or later. To use the new VDA, you must uninstall the current VDA and then install the new VDA. (This instruction applies even if you installed PvD but never used it.) For details, see If the VDA has Personal vDisk installed.\n\nJuly 2024\n\nNew and enhanced features\n\nIntegrations and data exports. Citrix Monitor now provides a new UI for integrations and data exports. This feature helps to improve the awareness of the various interfaces and third-party integrations available in Citrix Monitor. The newly introduced Integrations and Data exports page lists the following:\n\nAvailable integrations\n\nSupported developer tools\n\nThis page also describes the REST API set up for data exports and provides reference links to the guides and documents to get started with the integrations and developer tools.\n\nCurrently, Citrix Monitor is integrated with the Power BI observability. You can use this feature to export performance data and events from Citrix Monitor to Power BI using the REST APIs.\n\nClick Integrations and Data exports from the left navigation menu. The Integrations and Data exports page appears.\n\nFor more information, see Integrations and data exports.\n\nEnhancement on triaging user profile load issues. Citrix Monitor now supports the Profile Load duration and container metrics collection from Citrix Profile Management container and FSLogix container. This enhancement assists admin to receive comprehensive profile usage and performance data in user session reports. With this data you can identify and resolve issues with greater efficiency. For more information, see Profile load.\n\nAdvanced alert policies. The Proactive Notification and Alerting feature of the Monitor is enhanced to include a new alerting framework named Advanced Alert Policies. With this feature, you can create alerts by including granular details for each element or condition, thereby enhancing the control over the alerts scope. Currently, these policies include alerts for cost savings and infrastructure.\n\nThis feature helps you to reduce excessive alerts which might lead to reduced responsiveness or effectiveness in addressing important issues. This policy helps to measure effectiveness of alert policies and engagement from admins.\n\nFor more information, see Advanced alert policies.\n\nEnhancements on alert content. The alerting feature of the Monitor is enhanced to include a CSV attachment and a JSON payload. With this enhancement, you can get alert details in a CSV attachment over email or as a JSON payload in case of a webhook. Using this CSV attachment and JSON payload, you can receive enriched content at a detailed level, aiding in the quick identification and resolution of issues.\n\nCurrently, this enhancement is available only on the following alerts:\n\nMachine uptime\n\nFailed power on actions\n\nFailed power of actions\n\nUnregistered machines (%)\n\nFor more information, see Enhancements on alert content.\n\nLocal host cache config sync failure alert monitoring. During an outage, High Availability allows sessions to be initiated using the locally cached configuration on Cloud Connector called Local Host Cache. This cache is regularly synchronized with the primary database to ensure availability during outages. If the configuration sync fails more than three times consecutively, Citrix Monitor sends a warning alert to the administrator.\n\nA predefined alert policy named Local Host Cache - Config Sync Failure has been introduced in Citrix Monitor to notify about configuration sync failures in the Local Host Cache. You can check Local Host Cache - Config Sync Failure alerts on Monitor > Citrix Alerts. Also, you can receive email notifications by configuring the email settings in the alert policy. For more information, see Local host cache config sync failure alert monitoring.\n\nFailed power on action and Failed Power off action alert. The Proactive Notification and Alerting feature of the Monitor is enhanced to include two new alerts, Failed power on action and Failed Power off action alerts based on the number of power-managed machines failed to power on or off in a delivery group. The new alert condition allows you to configure alert thresholds as the number of power-managed machines failed to power on or off in a delivery group.\n\nFor more information, see Failed power on action and Failed Power off action.\n\nInfrastructure monitoring (Preview). Citrix Monitor now offers visibility into the operational health of Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops components. This feature helps you to easily identify, troubleshoot, and resolve issues related to your infrastructure. Currently, the health of the Citrix Provisioning (PVS) and StoreFront components are monitored.\n\nTo support this feature, a new Windows executable named Citrix Infra Monitor is introduced. This helps with the collection and transmission of relevant health metrics from PVS or StoreFront servers to Monitor.\n\nThis feature helps you to get critical monitoring data sets and proactive alerts with respect to PVS and StoreFront servers system metrics on a single console in Monitor. Data is collected every five minutes from the monitoring components to ensure the latest information.\n\nThis feature aims to enhance operational efficiency by offering proactive monitoring, detailed metrics, and automated alerts, ensuring your Citrix infrastructure runs smoothly and efficiently. For more information, see Infrastructure monitoring [Preview].\n\nInfrastructure policy (Preview). This policy is introduced to create alerts related to the health of supported Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops components.\n\nOnce the Infrastructure monitoring setup is completed, you can use the health data available in Monitor to configure alerts for any required component. Admins can set conditions, scopes, and notification mediums to receive important alerts through emails or a json payload through webhooks. The alerts raised are also available in the Citrix Alerts section for analysis and management.\n\nAs part if this policy, the following four new categories are introduced:\n\nReachability\n\nDependent services\n\nImpact\n\nResource utilization\n\nYou can set different conditions and can modify the severity of the preceding categories as required in the Critical and Warning section. You can also schedule re-alert intervals for these alerts.\n\nConditions within each category can be set with the severity of Critical and Warning based on your organizational priorities. You can also schedule re-alert intervals for these alerts.\n\nFor more information, see Infrastructure policies (Preview).\n\nIncreased limit of replicas per image version in Azure. Azure has increased the maximum count of replicas for a gallery image single version to 100. With the increase in limit, you can now set the property SharedImageGalleryReplicaMaximum to a maximum value of 100 while creating an MCS machine catalog using the Azure Compute Gallery image. For more information, see Configure Azure Compute Gallery.\n\nManaging prepared images with the Images node. An Images node is now available in Web Studio, letting you prepare an MCS image (prepared image) from a single source image and deploy it across various MCS machine catalogs. This node facilitates complete image lifecycle management, enabling you to create image definitions, versions, and catalogs.\n\nImages prepared using this node can only be used in Azure and VMware environments. For detailed information on image management, see Image management (Preview).\n\nAlternatively, you can also create catalogs with prepared images using the Machine Catalogs node. For more information, see Creating machine catalogs.\n\nDetailed misconfiguration report. The misconfiguration alerts that are exposed in the Zones node of the Full Configuration interface provide general information about a misconfiguration in the resource location.\n\nWith this enhancement, a new PowerShell cmdlet, Get-ConfigMisconfigurationReport, provides a detailed misconfigurations report in the zone. Added details include information such as which Connector is misconfigured, what is the current misconfiguration, and what is the recommended configuration. See Troubleshooting for the documentation on misconfigurations.\n\nIntroducing user and desktop display names in the Search node. To improve your troubleshooting efficiency, we’ve introduced two new columns on the Search node:\n\nUser Display Name column on the Sessions tab. With this column, you can quickly identify sessions associated with a specific user.\n\nDesktop Display Name column on both the Single-session OS Machines tab and the Sessions tab. With this column, you can quickly identify the machine associated with a specific desktop.\n\nAdditionally, we’ve added corresponding filters for efficient searching. For more information about these two columns, see Machine actions and columns and Session actions and columns.\n\nModify desktop display names using Full Configuration. We’ve enhanced the Machine Allocation page for single-session OS static delivery groups by introducing a new column, Display name. With this addition, you can now modify desktop display names for machines assigned to users. For more information, see Manage user assignments.\n\nOptions to troubleshoot when ICA RTT or Session Logon Duration data fails to populate. Previously, when EUEM service or UPM service failed to run, the reason for failure in getting the data related to ICA RTT or Session Logon Duration wasn’t displayed. With this new feature, you can get the reason for failure and the corresponding solution for the failure. For more information, see Troubleshoot when ICA RTT or Session Logon Duration data fails to populate.\n\nSupport for Azure’s nested virtualization. With this feature, if you configure the master VM with nested virtualization enabled, then all VMs in the MCS machine catalog created using that master VM have nested virtualization enabled. This feature is applicable to both persistent and non-persistent VMs. You can update an existing MCS machine catalog and existing VMs to have nested virtualization through image update.\n\nCurrently, only Dv3 and Ev3 VM sizes support nested virtualization.\n\nFor information on nested virtualization, see the Microsoft blog Nested Virtualization in Azure.\n\nSupport for inheriting labels from a machine profile source to the VMs and disks in GCP. With this feature, MCS machine catalog VMs and disks (Identity Disk, Write-cache Back Disk, and OS disk) can now inherit the labels of a machine profile source (GCP VM instance or instance template). You can use the labels to distinguish instances owned by different teams (for example, team:research and team:analytics), and further use it for cost accounting or budgeting.\n\nFor more information on labels, see the GCP document Organize resources using labels.\n\nThis feature is applicable to persistent and non-persistent MCS machine catalogs.\n\nYou can create a new MCS machine catalog, update an existing catalog, and update existing VMs to inherit the labels from a machine profile source.\n\nFor information on creating an MCS machine catalog, see VMs and disks with inherited labels.\n\nSupport for inheriting custom tags from machine profile to the provisioned VMs. You can now add the custom tags of an SCVMM VM to the MCS provisioned VMs along with the default CitrixProvisioningSchemeId tag. To add the custom tags to the provisioned VMs, you must use the SCVMM VM as a machine profile while creating or updating an MCS machine catalog. If you remove a VM from a catalog, then only the CitrixProvisioningSchemeId is removed from the tag. The custom tags are not deleted from the VM. This feature applies to a new MCS machine catalog and new VMs added to an existing catalog. For more information, see Create a catalog with a machine profile.\n\nSupport for on-demand capacity reservation in Azure. With this feature, you can create an MCS machine catalog of Azure VMs with on-demand capacity reservation using a machine profile (VM or template spec). This feature is applicable to persistent and non-persistent machine catalogs. You can update an existing machine catalog and existing VMs to have or remove on-demand capacity reservation.\n\nFor more information on Azure on-demand capacity reservation, see the Microsoft documentation On-demand Capacity Reservation. For information on creating and updating an MCS machine catalog with on-demand capacity reservation, see Create a catalog of on-demand capacity reservation VMs.\n\nSupport for placing WBC disk on the same storage location as OS disk. In XenServer, VMware, and SCVMM virtualization environments, MCS now places Write-back cache (WBC) disk on the same storage location as OS disk if you configure the available OS storage list the same as the available temporary storage list while creating a host connection.\n\nThis implementation helps to reduce the complexity in managing the OS and WBC disks. For creating a host connection, see Create a connection and resources.\n\nEnhancement to Cost savings page. Cost savings page is enhanced with the following:\n\nEstimated Savings - The Estimated savings chart now includes additional filter options to view data for last 7 days and 30 days. It also shows savings in relation to the customer’s account-specific pricing.\n\nFilter by Tags - Displays the tag of the machines that is configured in the Autoscale settings in a WebStudio. You can also filter the data based on the tagged machines. In this case, you will get only the tagged machines summary.\n\nAverage logon duration - Displays the average time for a user to log on over the selected time duration.\n\nPower managed machines - The power managed machine chart now includes the hibernate state of the machine, which helps you to analyze how many machines are in hibernate state.\n\nFor more information, see Cost savings[Preview] section.\n\nGet warnings messages for hibernation failure. You can now get warning messages using a PowerShell command Get-ProvOperationEvent in case of hibernation failure of MCS-provisioned and existing hibernation-capable VMs. For more information, see Get warnings messages for hibernation failure.\n\nOption to update write-back cache settings post creation for Machine Creation Service (MCS) catalogs in the hypervisors.

Citrix Monitor now displays the details of sessions in active, disconnected, or in terminated state. Previously, you could see the details of active sessions only. With this feature, helpdesk admins can troubleshoot issues with a session that was ended or in terminated state. The session details are available for last 24 hours and last 2 days. You can view the following details of an ended or terminated session:\n\nMachine Details panel - Displays the available details of the machine where the selected session was launched.\n\nSession Details panel - Displays the available details of the selected session.\n\nSession logon duration - Displays the information on the logon duration taken for the selected session. You can view the chart on time taken for brokering, machine start-up, hdx connection, authentication, GPOs, logon scripts, profile load on disk, and interactive session.\n\nFor more information, see Diagnose historical user sessions.\n\nMachine uptime alert. The Proactive Notification and Alerting feature of the Monitor is enhanced to include a new alert, Machine uptime alert based on the uptime of a power managed machine in a delivery group. For every delivery group, for which the machines crossed the threshold, you will get an attachment or webhook alert for that delivery group alone.\n\nThe new alert condition allows you to configure alert thresholds as the number of hours per day, hours per week, or hours per month for a machine is turned on in a delivery group.\n\nFor more information, see Machine uptime alert.\n\nPublished desktop name. Citrix Monitor now displays the published desktop name in the UI. This new field allows you differentiate among user groups within the same delivery group. You can also generate custom reports for these user groups. This new field is added to Filters, Custom Reports, or to Machine Details section of Citrix Monitor UI.\n\nInfrastructure rightsizing. The Infrastructure Rightsizing page helps you to analyze the provisioning and sizing aspects of your delivery group based on the resources utilization. Based on this analysis, you can optimize the machine provisioning and sizing to match the utilization pattern. You can optimize your infrastructure cost by reducing spending on the unused resources. You can also choose to opt for lower CPU and memory specifications machines if the resource utilization is consistently lower than provisioned. You can optimize for performance by opting for a higher CPU and memory specifications machines if the resource utilization is consistency higher and see evidence of it impacting the session experience such as Logon and ICARTT metrics.\n\nYou can filter the Infrastructure rightsizing using the following:\n\nDelivery Group - You can filter for single session OS or multi session OS delivery groups\n\nTags - Tags are the tag names applied to the machine. So, you can filter machines with the same tags. You can select multiple tags up to five tags. When you select multiple tags, you can filter for all the machines which have at least one of those selected machine tags applied.\n\nTime period - You can filter the data for last 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days.\n\nThe Infrastructure rightsizing page offers:\n\nInsight in to the utilization details\n\nSummary of the resource utilization\n\nTrends on the resource utilization\n\nClick the Cost Optimization tab from the left menu on the Home page. And then, click the Infrastructure rightsizing tab to access the Infrastructure rightsizing page.\n\nYou can also click the Rightsize this delivery group link from the Infrastructure details section in the Cost Optimization tab > Cost savings to access the Infrastructure rightsizing page.\n\nFor more information, see Infrastructure rightsizing.\n\nLocal Host Cache activity dashboard. The new Local Host Cache dashboard under the Trends tab provides detailed information on user sessions and machines available during an outage on any Resource location or Zone. Administrators can use the details around number of machine registrations, reconnected sessions, and new sessions brokered to evaluate and audit activities while in Local Host Cache mode. The default selected data is for last 24 hours and for all zone and cloud connectors, with the ability to filter on time period, zone, and cloud connector. The Local Host Cache data is available for last 2 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, 1 month, and up to 90 days. For more information, see Available trends.\n\nSpecify CMEK global and regional keys from all projects. In Google Cloud environments, previously, you could only use customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) from within the same GCP project and the same region in which the hosting connection is created.\n\nWith this feature, you can now browse and use global or regional CMEK from all projects that are accessible to the service account. This feature enhances the flexibility to manage encryption keys. This feature requires extra permission for the following two service accounts:\n\nThe service account of the current project with which the hosting connection is created.\n\nThe Compute Engine Service Agent of the current project.\n\nFor more information, see Specify CMEK global and regional keys.\n\nDecoupled Workspaces, allow userGroup assignment. Decoupled Workspaces now allows for a more flexible and independent management of users and their associated workspaces. It simply means, you can create deployments without associating any users to it and instead assign the users to a deployment later. For more information, see Create a deployment.\n\nSupport to import Workspace images type. You can now import Workspace images type to create a desktop experience for users. For more information, see Import an image.\n\nExport function extended to all nodes in Full Configuration. You can now export records from the main view of any node in Full Configuration to a CSV file. Note the following:\n\nThe Export icon is disabled while data is loading, except for the Search and Applications nodes.\n\nFor nodes with the Columns to Display function, exported data includes only selected columns.\n\nSupport for adding notes for maintenance mode.
