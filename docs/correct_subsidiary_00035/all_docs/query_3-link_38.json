        "text": "Over the past few weeks we've released a series of blogs and videos showcasing how XenServer optimizes #Citrix PVS and MCS to accelerate VDA boots / reboots, accelerate Machine Catalog Updates, and help you get the most out of your existing infrastructure by reducing the load on your network, storage, and PVS servers. Citrix optimization blog series =================== Optimizing Citrix PVS with XenServer PVS Accelerator (https://lnkd.in/eM-bAxSQ) Optimizing Citrix Machine Creation Services with XenServer IntelliCache (https://lnkd.in/eUzc5Jbx) Using Read Cache with Citrix Machine Creation Services (https://lnkd.in/emtcYa_2) Optimizing MCS workloads with XenServer (https://lnkd.in/eWTvNWb8) Accelerate Citrix Machine Catalog Updates with XenServer optimizations (https://lnkd.in/edtDybVJ) Citrix optimization videos series ==================== XenServer PVS Accelerator: Side-by-side demo of optimization Citrix Provisioning Services (https://lnkd.in/e8QkmG93) XenServer PVS Accelerator: Technical Overview (https://lnkd.in/eaATYZi2) XenServer Intellicache: Side-by-side demo of optimization Citrix MCS (https://lnkd.in/emXxPVXj) XenServer Intellicache: Technical Details (https://lnkd.in/eVv7EZAg) XenServer Storage Read Cache for optimizing Citrix Machine Creation Services (https://lnkd.in/eWMvRd9e)\n\nCustomers vary widely in how they choose to monitor their IT environments, two of the most common approaches we encounter are based on SNMP and Nagios. That’s why, with the release of XenServer 8, we added support for both of these technologies. If you’re a #Citrix customer, we’d love to hear from you regarding which additional monitoring capabilities you’d most like to see. Let us know your thoughts, comment here or email us Feedback@XenServer.com\n\nIntroducing MCS Intellicache for CVAD and Citrix DaaS. Only available from XenServer, Intellicache optimizes #Citrix Machine Creation Services (MCS). Hypervisors not optimized for Citrix can put more load on your storage, take more time for virtual desktops to boot and for machine catalog updates. This in turn can lead to lost employee productivity, wasted admin time and delays in Citrix expansion projects. Intellicache from XenServer can speed up virtual desktop boot times, accelerate machine catalog updates and help you get the most out of your existing infrastructure when scaling your Citrix environment.\n\nNot every company is blessed in having a blisteringly fast network infrastructure. If you’re using XenServer to run your CVAD or #Citrix DaaS workloads, but don’t have access to a fast network then read on. Hidden away in the menu structure of the XenCenter UI is a little gem, with the snappy title of “Compress VM memory and vGPU data during VM live migration”. What’s it used for? During the live migration of a VM between XenServer hosts, the VM’s memory is seamlessly transferred as a data stream between the two hosts via the XenServer internal host network. In environments with limited network bandwidth, this process can sometimes be slower than desired. That's where XenServer’s migration memory stream compression comes into play. XenServer 8’s innovative compression technology significantly accelerates the memory transfer process by compressing the data stream, reducing the time required for migration even on slower speed networks. This ensures a smoother and more efficient VM migration experience, minimizing migration completion time and enhancing overall system performance. To enable Live Migration VM memory compression, simply use XenCenter to navigate to “XenServer Pool Properties” - then check the option box for VM memory compression. That’s it, no rebooting of hosts, restarting Xen or VMs needed! Please note, this feature is off by default, as for customers with super-fast networking it won’t improve performance and can even slow VM migrations down. Why not try yourself and see if you too can benefit from up to 3x faster migration times. This feature along with every other XenServer 8 feature is available in the Trial Edition, which can be downloaded freely from xenserver.com/downloads\n\nCitrix provisioning is the best way to deploy virtual desktops at scale. However, it is reliant on your existing networking infrastructure. If your networking infrastructure isn't prepared to handle the load, it can lead to slower boot times. PVS Accelerator, only available from XenServer, can accelerate virtual desktop boot times, machine catalog updates and your @Citrix expansion projects, while helping you get the most out of your existing infrastructure. Check out this demo video showcasing a side-by-side comparison, with and without PVS Accelerator:"
