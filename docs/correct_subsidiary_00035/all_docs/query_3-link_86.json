The Datacenter Edition may not be deployed in a Citrix Virtual Desktop or Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops environment.

Under the Device model, a “Device” is a device authorized by you to be used by any individual(s) to access instances of the product server software or service (locally or over a network). User and Device licenses may be reassigned only pursuant to Citrix’ policy, process and timescale for reassignment. See this Licensing FAQ. You may deploy network architectures that use hardware or software to reduce the number of Users or Devices that directly access the product server software or service. This is referred to as multiplexing or pooling. This does not reduce the number of licenses required to access or use the server software or service under either license model. A license is required for each User or Device that is connected to the multiplexing or pooling software or hardware front end. You must acquire and assign a license to each User or Device that accesses instances of the server software or service directly or indirectly, frequently or infrequently, even if the authorized User or Device is an automaton. Under the Concurrent model, a \"Concurrent\" device is a single device connected to a single instance of the server software. Under the Concurrent Session model, which is offered exclusively with Provisioning Services, a \"Concurrent Session\" is the number of physical or virtual machine sessions serviced by the product. \"Express\" versions of products are offered with limited term license and with NO WARRANTY, INFRINGEMENT INDEMNIFICATION OR SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE. Further, \"Express\" versions may not be used by any Citrix or non-Citrix service providers for a cloud/hosted production offering. The SKU description for each product or maintenance offering ordered confirms your product entitlements. In the event of a conflict between a SKU description and this table, the SKU description shall control.\n\n** See Software Maintenance descriptions at www.citrix.com/support/programs.html. Reinstatement of expired Maintenance is offered only at the sole discretion of Citrix. If offered, reinstatement and recovery charges may apply. Downgrades between Maintenance programs are not offered.\n\n*** See product specific end user license terms at http://www.citrix.com/buy/licensing/agreements.html (in addition to the content and notes above). Unless otherwise noted, each product license may be loaded on only a single license server or appliance instance, as applicable. With respect to an audit under the end user license terms, excess license usage will be determined based on peak license deployment and billed at the then-current Citrix suggested retail price for licenses and for maintenance on those licenses (for the lesser of the duration of the excess usage or two years). Charges for any additional findings, as well as audit fees, may apply. With respect to your purchase of a product trade-up or upgrade, or your implementation of a product release with new product licenses under Maintenance, you are permitted a 90 day grace period to run both your new and the old product licenses in production. This period runs from your purchase of the trade-up or upgrade, and from your download of the new release under your maintenance program. You agree to destroy the old licenses and retain no copies after the grace period. Certain products include a license overdraft feature that enables you to use a limited number of additional licenses to prevent access denial. Any overdraft feature is offered as a convenience, not as a license entitlement. Any overdraft licenses used must be purchased within 30 days of first use. Citrix reserves the right to remove any overdraft feature in new product releases.\n\nThis table may be updated by Citrix from time to time at its sole discretion. You are advised to check this table prior to each purchase.\n\nProduct Line*** Editions Unit Type* Term Maintenance\n\nNotes Citrix Hypervisor Standard and Enterprise CPU Socket Subscription Customer Success Services If you received this product as a component of another product, this product is licensed for an unlimited quantity of sockets, but only for supporting virtual machines within that product solution environment.\n\n* Unless otherwise noted above for a product, Citrix end-user license models are as follows: Under the CPU Socket model, a “CPU Socket” is an individual populated CPU socket on a server running the PRODUCT.
