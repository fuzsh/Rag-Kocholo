        "text": "Baptist Values\n\nIn 2018 the church voted to change its name to “FaithPoint – a baptist church”, but is primarily known as FaithPoint or FaithPoint Church. Historically, the name “baptist” was originally used (often in disdain) for those who believed strongly in loyalty to the Word of God and so preached and practiced baptism by immersion following salvation. We value the heritage of baptists, along with other Bible-believing churches, of faithfulness to core New Testament teachings such as:\n\nThe Word of God is our sole source for what we believe and what we practice. (2 Tim. 3:16)\n\nThe local church is responsible for its own government and direction. (Matt. 18:17)\n\nEach believer has access to God and needs no mediator other than Christ. (1 Tim. 2:5)\n\nThe pastor/elder/bishop and deacon are the only biblical offices. (1 Tim. 3:1-13)\n\nGenuine faith, both in salvation and sanctification, is a matter of the individual’s heart. This doctrine is known as soul liberty. (Gal. 2:3-5)\n\nOnly true believers qualify for church membership. (Acts 2:47)\n\nBaptism and communion are the only ordinances given to the local church. (Matt. 28:19-20; 1 Cor. 11:23-24)\n\nThe Bible teaches that the church is a spiritual organism, separate from the state, and that separation from ungodly behavior and doctrinal apostacy is the responsibility of true Christians. (Matt. 22:21; Rom. 12:1-2; Romans 16:17-18; Titus 2:11-15)\n\nFaithPoint recognizes that, unfortunately, the ‘Baptist’ label has been adopted by many churches that teach aberrant doctrine (e.g. the King James Bible is the only inspired Bible in the English language), insist on extra-biblical practices as Scriptural requirements (e.g. women prohibited from wearing slacks), or engage in highly offensive and unchristian behavior (e.g. protests at military funerals)\n\nBecause these (and other) errors have become, at times, points of confusion and stumbling blocks to the advancement of the Gospel, we choose to use the title “baptist” with discretion and wisdom as is best for impacting our community for Christ and furthering the Kingdom of God."
