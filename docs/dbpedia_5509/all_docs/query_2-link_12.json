        "text": "Henry Jacob began another Baptist movement of non-separatists. This movement became Particular Baptists and held to hyper-Calvinist theology.\n\nHenry Browne set up a Congregational Society in Norwich before being forced to flee with his followers to Holland. The movement was re-established in London. Societies, known as Independents, were founded in different parts of the country. Like the Baptists, each church was a separate body supporting its own minister, but might belong to a voluntary district association.\n\nRoger Williams accepted the post of chaplain to Sir William Masham at his manor house at Otes in Essex. His courtship of Jane Whalley was brought to an abrupt termination by the disapproval of her aunt, Lady Barrington. Stung by the rejection, the young clergyman became ill of fever and was nursed back to health by Mary Barnard, a member of Lady Masham's household. She is believed to have been the daughter of the Rev. Richard Barnard in Nottinghamshire. Rogers Williams and Mary Barnard were married at High Laver Church in Essex on December 15.\n\nTwo groups of Baptists emerge. Both believe that only those who put their trust in Christ can be saved, but while the so-called General Baptists believe that anyone can have such faith, the Particular Baptists believe that the only people capable of having such faith are those few who have already been pre-chosen by God.\n\nRoger Williams was ordered by the General Court (MA Bay authorities) to be banished from Massachusetts and threatened with deportation to England if he did not renounce his convictions. \"Whereas Mr. Roger Williams, one of the Elders of the church of Salem, hath broached and divulged new and dangerous opinions against the authority of magistrates, as also written letters of defamation, both of the magistrates and churches here, and that before any conviction, and yet maintaineth the same without any retraction; it is, therefore, ordered that the said Mr. Williams shall depart out of this jurisdiction within six weeks now next ensuing,\" etc. Williams publicly proclaiming that the MA Bay charter was invalid, since the king (James I) had no right to give away lands belonging to the Indians. He also denounced them for forcing religious uniformity upon the colonists. He believed in what he called \"soul-liberty\", which meant that every man had the complete right to enjoy freedom of opinion on the subject of religion.\n\nRoger Williams joined the Baptist faith and founded the first Baptist church in America. However, within a few months he withdrew from this group and became a \"Seeker\".\n\nBaptists persuade Roger Williams and Ezekial Holliman to accept their view of the church, and thus the first Baptist congregation in America is formed, in Providence, Rhode Island\n\nAt the request of Massachusetts, Williams' mediation prevented a coalition of the Pequots with the Narragansetts and Mohegans. He wrote of this service in later years: Three days and nights my business forced me to lodge and mix with the bloody Pequot ambassadors, whose hands and arms me thought reeked with the blood of my countrymen murdered and massacred by them on Connecticut River.\n\nRoger Williams went to England to obtain a charter to unite Providence with the settlements of Warwick, Newport and Portsmouth, which were coveted by MA Bay, Plymouth and CT. On the voyage wrote his Key to the Indian Languages. In his dedication he says, \"A little key may open a box where lies a bunch of keys.\" The charter he obtained proved to be very important as it was indisputable for the next 20 years.\n\nNewport Pagnell garrison moves to Leicester. Most probably, it was here that Bunyan's comrade was shot. \"When I was a soldier, I, with others, were drawn out to go to such a place to besiege it; but when I was just ready to go, one of the company desired to go in my room; to which, when I had consented, he took my place; and coming to the siege, as he stood sentinel, he was shot into the head with a musket bullet, and died.\" - John Bunyan, from \"Grace Abounding\".\n\nIn the month of July, in company with Dr. John Clarke and Mr. Crandall, Obadiah Holmes made a visit to William Witter, A Baptist, who resided at Lynn, Massachusetts. The day after their arrival being the Sabbath, they arranged to have a religious service at Witter's home. While Dr. Clarke preached, two constables presented to him the following warrant: \"By virtue hereof, you are required to go to the house of William Witter, and to search from house to house for certain erroneous person, being strangers and them to apprehend, and in safe custody to keep, and to-morrow morning at eight o'clock to bring before me. Robert Bridges.\"\n\nJohn Bunyan is scheduled to preach at the hamlet of Lower Samsell (November 12). Upon his arrival, he is informed that a warrant has been issued for his arrest. After a lengthy interview with Mr. Francis Wingate, and another with Wingate's brother-in-law, William Foster, (who unsuccessfully tries to persuade Bunyan into a concession), John was placed in Bedford prison. He was charged with \"devilishly and perniciously abstaining from coming to Church to ear Divine Service, and for being a common upholder of several unlawful meetings and conventicles, to the great disturbance and distraction of the good subjects of this kingdom, contrary to the laws of our sovereign lord and king.\" Within approximately eight days of John's arrest, his wife gives birth, only for the infant to die soon after. \"I am but mother-in-law to them, having not been married to him yet full two years. [Elizabeth, John's second wife, spoke this in 1661.] Indeed, I was with child when my husband was first apprehended; but being young, and unaccustomed to such things, said she, I being smayed at the news, fell into labour, and so continued for eight days, and then was delivered, but my child died.\" - John Bunyan's wife, from \"A Relation of My Imprisonment\"\n\nOrganization of General Assembly of all Associations of General Baptists in London.\n\nOn July 26, the Baptist churches of Lincolnshire, in their petition to Charles II., say: \"We have been much abused as we pass in the streets, and as we sit in our houses, being threatened to be hanged if but heard praying to our Lord, in our own families, and disturbed in our so waiting upon Him by continual beating at our doors and sounding of horns; stoned when going to out meetings ; taken as evil-doers, and imprisoned when peaceably met together to worship the Most High in the use of His most precious ordinances.\n\nA brief period of freedom follows re-incarceration \"He was let out again, 1666, being the year of the burning of London, and, a little after his release, they took him again at a meeting, and put him in the same jail, where he lay six years more.\"âCharles Doe, A friend and biographer of John Bunyan.\n\nElias Keach came to Pennsylvania and posed as a minister. While preaching he came under terrible conviction and had to stop. He confessed his lost condition and the people sent him to Elder Thomas Dungan pastor of the Cold Spring Baptist Church in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Elias Keach was saved there by the grace of God. He was baptized and ordained by the Cold Spring Baptist Church and as a missionary out of the Cold Spring Baptist Church he organized the Pennepeck Baptist Church (also known as the Lower Dublin Baptist Church) at Pennepeck, Pennsylvania."
