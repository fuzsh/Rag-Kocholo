The last such attempt from the American prospective was made in 2007, and the time has come for a new history of the Awakening that builds upon long-established scholarship and incorporates the most recent work on the subject. The foregoing volume is the product of nearly ten years of research, of writing and thinking, of rewriting and rethinking, thus giving proof to Heraclitus’s fabled dictum (as paraphrased by Plato) that “ ”—“you cannot step twice into the same stream.” Each time I have come to this stream, it has been different, and each time I am never the same swimmer. I have incurred a great many debts as I have made my way through various projects that culminate in the foregoing work, and to name them all would take up too much precious space, but several must be acknowledged. Firstly, I want to extend my gratitude to the archivists and librarians at the many repositories, in Britain and the United States, in which I had the pleasure to work and linger. Their friendliness and efficiency make research a far more pleasurable endeavor than it is already. A number of friends and colleagues have read various aspects of the manuscript or discussed the project with me at some length. Kenneth P. Minkema and Harry S. Stout read and gave me valuable notes on my initial project proposal, and Jon Butler, Stephen A. Marini, Jessica Millward, Angela Lahr, Douglas Winiarski, Jane T. Merritt, and John A. Grigg read sections of the manuscript or commented on elements of it at various academic conferences. Some themes were introduced at an Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture spring colloquium in 2002, with particular thanks extended to Ronald Hoffman and Frederika Teute for their probing questions and constructive criticism. The late Rhys Isaac generously offered to make some notes on selected early ix\n\nx Preface\n\nchapter drafts after a wonderful conversation we had during a reception at the Omohundro Institute’s Thirteenth Annual Conference in 2007. It was during that same conference that I enjoyed a delightful, convivial Indian meal with Christopher Beneke and Thomas Kidd, where transpired a great exchange of ideas that set me down the interpretative path taken here. The late Edwin Scott Gaustad, whom I first met at an American Society of Church History conference in Santa Fe in 2000, read several early chapter drafts and research notes, and was most encouraging in my pursuit of a secular interpretation of the Awakening. This book’s strengths are largely the product of their insightful guidance, while its weaknesses remain entirely my responsibility. I am indebted to Texas A&M University-Commerce, which awarded me a generous Faculty Research Enhancement Grant that provided much-needed funds to complete my research. A semester-long Faculty Development Leave gave me time to complete and polish the manuscript. I have been privileged to enjoy the guidance and support of Farleigh Dickinson University Press and Rowman & Littlefield Publishing Group, particularly Harry Keyishian and Kalman Goldstein, who were instrumental in shepherding this project to final publication. Genevieve Shifke and Karen Ackermann skillfully guided the book down the last leg of its journey to press. Their hard work is most appreciated. Friends and colleagues have variously offered encouragement and support, which at certain key moments imbued me with renewed energy and initiative to proceed with the work and bring it to completion, to say nothing of helping me keep my wits sharpened through many conversations about the Awakening, American religious history, the writing process, and many things having nothing whatsoever to do with any of those subjects. Thanks to Sung Bok Kim, Candis Murray, Jeannine Chandler, Gary Loura, Christopher Beneke, William F. Kuracina, Chad King, Connie Meyer, and Jimmy Allen. Most of all I thank my wife, Erica, and our children, Iain and River, who opened the door to a richer and more meaningful life. They have had to endure many months of my being sequestered in my office as I finished and revised the manuscript, and did so with humbling grace. This book is dedicated to them. John Howard Smith Commerce, Texas\n\nIntroduction The Problem of the First Great Awakening\n\nIn 1967, the eminent historian of early American religion William G. McLoughlin wondered, “Is not the history of America the history of the pietistic impulse in various formulations?” To McLoughlin and his predecessors, there was little doubt that the answer is a resounding “of course,” but the decline of Neo-Whig American historiography since the 1960s gradually cast doubt upon not only the answer but also the validity of the question itself. That religion and religious sensibilities shape individuals, groups, and cultures cannot be denied, yet the extent to which they do so has been and continues to be hotly contested among American historians seeking to define and explain the political and social evolution of the United States. The purpose of this book is to reinterpret the First Great Awakening’s place in American history as a cultural and political watershed in order to describe how, in McLoughlin’s assessment, “this existential characteristic [the ‘pietistic impulse’] . . . became permanently embedded in our national character,” and whether or not it constitutes “our national conversion,” as H. Richard Niebuhr—following Herbert Levi Osgood—proclaimed. On another level, its purpose is to call into question what is meant by an “awakening” in the religious sense, and to offer a new definition of the “First Great Awakening” that is more in keeping with recent advances in scholarship.1  THE RELIGIOUS LANDSCAPE OF BRITISH AMERICA The varieties of religious faith and practice in the early eighteenth-century British North American colonies occupied a very broad spectrum. New England was dominated by a Calvinist Congregationalism challenged by Presbyterianism, Anglicanism, and various Independent denominations such 1\n\n2 Introduction\n\nas the Baptists and Quakers. Within Congregationalism, fractures appeared and widened over divergent theologies, doctrines, and practices. The Middle Colonies were quite religiously diverse, as Dutch Reformed, Anglicans, Presbyterians, Lutherans, Congregationalists, Baptists, and other Independent denominations and sects variously competed and accorded with one another. The southern colonies were the most homogeneous, with firm Anglican establishments checking attempts by other denominations to make significant inroads, though Baptists in Virginia, Quakers in North Carolina, and Presbyterians throughout had begun to assert themselves. Missionary outreach to various Indian tribes remained halfhearted and at best disappointing, while slaveholders generally resisted pressures to Christianize their human chattels and the slaves themselves tended to reject their masters’ religion. A heightened lack of public piety and personal religious devotion led many ministers to worry about spiritual declension, while the educated classes found themselves attracted to atheism, Deism, Unitarianism, and Universalism, thus confirming the clergy’s growing concerns. Church attendance and membership among white colonists appeared to shrink dramatically, unable to keep pace with the explosive population growth through natural increase and immigration from Europe. The spread of religious indifference, the popularity of “folk religion,” rampant sectarianism, and contentious denominational rivalries led some ministers to call for a renewal of what they believed to be the far greater spiritual devotion of the previous century. A growing chorus of criticism against the influence of Enlightenment rationalism on Protestant Christian theology, formalism in church services, and status consciousness and “worldliness” among the clergy of nearly all denominations also resulted in a movement to restore seventeenth-century piety and clerical dedication. In the early 1730s, Jonathan Edwards of Northampton, Massachusetts, adopted the “plain style” of sermonizing practiced by his forebears and reaped a harvest of souls by reemphasizing traditional Puritan Calvinist doctrines of innate human depravity, total inability, and God’s implacable omnipotence. The Tennents of New Jersey and Pennsylvania— William Sr., Gilbert, John, and William Jr.—likewise oversaw ecstatic revivals in the Raritan and Delaware valleys through similar means. These revivals are but a handful of other such events cropping up throughout New England and the Middle Colonies, and the “New Lights” who fomented this renewal of conservative Protestantism championed the devout layman over the “Old Light” established ministry, which mocked and criticized the revivalists as ignorant, self-deluded, or heterodox demagogues, or bluntly accused them of being con artists. The preaching tour of one Anglican evangelical, George Whitefield, in 1739–1740 drew enormous crowds in American seaboard cities from Savannah, Georgia, to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, demonstrating revivalism’s appeal among the laity. Itinerant ministers began to appear,\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\ndemanding their rights to preach without university training or governmental licensing, and the New Lights generally encouraged them as welcome alternatives to “hireling” ministers seemingly more concerned about their salaries and social status than with saving souls. Sharp divisions of opinion arose concerning religious “enthusiasm,” revivalism, clerical professionalism, and itinerancy, fueled by radical New Light and Old Light attacks upon each other in the pulpits and the press, resulting in rampant separatism and denominational schisms, the most famous of which was the sundering of the Presbyterian Church into rival synods in 1741. News of similar revivals in Europe broadcast by Thomas Prince, Sr., in his periodical, The Christian History, kept readers up to date on these extraordinary events between 1742 and 1745. The tides of revivalism, however, seemed to ebb after 1745, when the renewal of war between Britain and France occupied Americans’ attention and the evangelical fire seemed to have burnt itself out. New Light Presbyterians and Baptists found receptive audiences in the southern backcountry and among slave communities in the 1750s and 1760s, indicating that what Edwards called “a great and general awakening” had finally engulfed the South. Theological disputes sparked by the Awakening continued to be waged in New England and elsewhere, but the popular aspect of the Awakening had apparently declined and Christianity restored to the control of the professional ministry, which had recovered its former authority by the time the Seven Years’ War began in Jumonville’s Glen in 1754. Radical New Lights such as James Davenport of New London, Connecticut, had recanted their excesses and begun to settle into the clerical mainstream. The radical revivalist anti-intellectualism subsided, as the damage done by uneducated and theologically untrained itinerants led New Light elites to work toward the establishment of seminary colleges. Waning news of revivals forced Edwards to conclude tentatively that their decline represented hopefully only a temporary victory for “the enemy”—Satan. For all intents and purposes, though, the Great Awakening seemed to be over, eclipsed by new economic and political concerns leading to the American Revolution.2\n\nHISTORIANS AND THE AWAKENING Historians have been striving to define and explain the First Great Awakening since the outbreak of a “Second” Great Awakening in the early nineteenth century. Shifting interpretative frameworks have created over the past two centuries a rich tapestry of opinion concerning the dynamics and significance of the eighteenth-century Awakening, responding to changes in historiography and scholarly trends. A few brilliant works stand as towering monuments\n\n4 Introduction\n\nto changing ideas about what the Awakening was and what it has meant to the formation of American identity, while others cast doubt upon those works, culminating in Jon Butler’s clanging announcement in 1982 that the First Great Awakening was nothing more than a nineteenth-century “interpretive fiction,” its later historians as having been duped by their forebears or become willing participants in some grand delusion—much as the Old Lights accused the New Lights of fraud and deception at the time of the revivals. So convincing has been Butler’s critique that others have similarly questioned the existence or the nature of the Awakening, even as they continue to discuss the revivals and use the nomenclature which Butler insists is misleading.3 Joseph Tracy first analyzed the eighteenth-century revivals in The Great Awakening (1841), being a centennial celebration of pre-revolutionary revivalism and the advent of what early nineteenth-century Jeffersonian evangelicals dubbed the “Second Great Awakening.” He characterized the First Great Awakening as the seminal event in the formation of a unified American consciousness prefiguring the American Revolution.4 A deeper interpretation emerged with the publication of Charles H. Maxson’s The Great Awakening in the Middle Colonies (1920), which located the roots of the Awakening in Pietism and evangelicalism as exported to New Jersey and Pennsylvania by Dutch and Scots-Irish immigrants. Herbert Levi Osgood saw in the revivals a crucible out of which the American identity was forged, “the first great and spontaneous movement in the history of the American people, deeper and more pervading than the wars.” V. L. Parrington set down a new orthodox interpretation of the “American Mind” in 1927 by characterizing the Awakening as a struggle between Puritan Calvinism and liberal Enlightenment rationalism, in which the latter prevailed and became the motive ideological force paving the road to the Revolution.5 Most studies of the Awakening appearing prior to the 1970s focus heavily upon New England, as well as identifying the Awakening primarily as a subject of intellectual history. Perry Miller argued that religion continued to be the core of American identity in his monumental two-volume The New England Mind (1939, 1953), while Edwin Scott Gaustad diminished the prominence of the New Light revivalist leaders in favor of focusing upon the theological dimension of the Awakening and its aftereffects. C. C. Goen emphasized the schismatic dynamics of what was a much broader and multilayered event, while Carl Bridenbaugh argued that religion and politics were intricately intertwined in the Awakening in ways that prefigured the Revolution.6 Alan Heimert extended this line of interpretation substantially in the highly influential Religion and the American Mind from the Great Awakening to the Revolution (1966). The success of the First Great Awakening, he asserted, was nothing less than an American declaration of intellectual independence from Europe that made the American Revolution not only possible,\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nbut also inevitable. This proved a highly controversial argument, but one that gained credibility throughout the 1970s, boosted by work done by David S. Lovejoy, Darrett B. Rutman, J. M. Bumsted, Richard L. Bushman, and Cedric B. Cowing. Analyses offered in the late 1970s and early 1980s by Mark A. Noll, Nathan O. Hatch, and Harry S. Stout can be summed up in Gary B. Nash’s conclusion that the Awakening constituted “a profound cultural crisis involving the convergence of political, social, and economic forces,” encouraging a latitudinarian and antiauthoritarian spirit that significantly altered the dynamic between those in power and those subject to it.7 Without question, the boldest thesis about the Awakening was offered by Jon Butler, who contended that the Awakening was a nineteenth-century “creation,” and was essentially a nonevent. Joseph Conforti, building upon Butler’s critique, added that the First Great Awakening was invented “as a cultural production of the Second Great Awakening.”8 Despite such a determined effort to sweep the pieces off the chessboard, historians of the 1980s and 1990s largely ignored Butler’s dismissal of the First Great Awakening’s existence, even as they incorporated his broader assertion of a fundamentally antiauthoritarian religious culture into their works. Patricia U. Bonomi and Peter Eisenstadt forcefully countered that American popular religiosity had not declined or surrendered to secularism during the eighteenth century.9 The strength of Butler’s conclusions silenced unqualified adherence to Heimert’s interpretation, but the question Butler thought had been asked and answered still remains: had there been a First Great Awakening at all? Butler sounded the Awakening’s funeral bell by proclaiming it a nineteenth-century fantasy, but Frank Lambert transferred Butler’s interpretative framework back into the eighteenth century in Inventing the “Great Awakening” (1999). Defining “invention” in its eighteenth-century dual meaning (the “‘discovery of a thing hidden’” and “of fabricating or designing something new”), Lambert asserted that the Awakening was the creation of the New Light revivalists themselves. Here, the Awakening was, in Lambert’s opinion, “an early American culture war” that—apart from earlier revivalist episodes—was waged in the press, where it took the form of a political contest for spiritual leadership in the public arena. In essence, following Butler’s conclusions, Lambert asserts that “a rather ordinary occurrence in an obscure corner of colonial America grew into the Great Awakening” after the Revolution.10 Despite Butler’s revisionism, none have gone so far as he to deny the Great Awakening’s existence, variously interpreting revivalism, theological development, and sectarianism within a wide variety of contexts, and using the “Great Awakening” label with or without qualification to describe the event. A significant proportion of scholarship on the First Great Awakening is devoted to biographical studies of the principal figures in it: Jonathan Edwards, George Whitefield, and the Tennents, primarily. These add\n\n6 Introduction\n\nconsiderable detail to the theological and ecclesiological issues suffusing the Awakening, as well as the dynamics of the contemporary debate over revivalism, religious “enthusiasm,” and ministerial identity.11 Works dealing with the European, especially Scottish and Scots-Irish, influences on American revivalism undertaken in the past thirty years have done much to deprovincialize the Awakening as scholarly consciousness of the eighteenth-century Atlantic World has grown, and religion has emerged as a more important facet in the construction of early European-American cultural and individual identity.12 Recent scholarship in the journal literature emphasizes the New Divinity’s roots in the theological arguments of the Awakening, its intercolonial nature, theological disputation, gender issues, and the Great Awakening’s mystical radicalism. This demonstrates the much needed turn toward reinterpreting the First Great Awakening as primarily a religious phenomenon and not as a political one, as Heimert and the majority of those who followed him have done. Thomas S. Kidd, in his 2007 survey of the Awakening, follows Tracy in asserting that this provided British America with a coherent identity defended in the Revolution, confirms Noll in his conclusions that evangelicalism was a galvanizing force for good in early American history, and supports Heimert in connecting the redefinition of ministerial authority vis-à-vis lay activism to the democratic forces that sparked the Revolution.13 While scholarly debates over theological and political issues raised by the Awakening dominate the twentieth-century historiography, a growing profusion of works devoted to other aspects of the revivals have broadened and deepened our understanding of the event since the 1980s. Partially eclipsing the Heimert thesis, this new view of the Awakening has enlarged to identify it as a transatlantic phenomenon as well as other parts of British North America.14 Other thematically oriented studies have further demonstrated the complexities of the Awakening to include media coverage of the revivals,15 gender issues,16 race consciousness, and African-American identity,17 as well as the Awakening’s effects upon American Indian societies.18 To the extent that an integrative approach to understanding religion in eighteenth-century America—particularly the Awakening—has been attempted, the overwhelming majority of scholars have, in Christopher Grasso’s assessment, fallen into “the old habit of seeing the mainland colonies as New England writ large.” This echoes Jack P. Greene’s lament that northern historians since the Civil War have established the broad interpretative paradigm that the North represents progressivism while the South was and remains an “aberration” congenitally inclined to retrogression. Thus, Puritanism and New England culture are interpreted as having provided the fundamental definition for American culture, as Sacvan Bercovitch averred, and the First Great Awakening as peculiar to New England and nowhere else. That similar and even simultaneous influences sparked revivalism in New England and elsewhere\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nin the 1720s and 1730s has not been conclusively established, in spite of the prodigious evidence supporting the conclusion that far more connected and bound the British mainland colonies in the eighteenth century than divided them from one another.19\n\nTHE ARGUMENT Despite the attention devoted to colonial American religion, the First Great Awakening and various aspects of it, there have been few synthetic analyses of the phenomenon. W. R. Ward’s can be considered such a study, but it is essentially Eurocentric, treating the American revivals as a sideshow to the main event. Thomas S. Kidd focuses entirely on the colonial theater, and does so essentially from a contemporary evangelical perspective. The First Great Awakening is an attempt to assimilate more than a century-and-a-half of scholarship into a new synthetic history of one of the most heavily examined and debated, vaunted and maligned, magnified and diminished, exhilarating and frustrating events in early American history. Within a roughly chronological narrative of the Awakening in which the towering figures of Jonathan Edwards, George Whitefield, and the Tennents make their appearances and are granted their rightful prominence, this work devotes greater attention to historiographically underrepresented segments of colonial American society: middle- and lower-class people, women, African Americans, and Indians. Rather than concentrate solely upon revivalism as most studies of the Awakening have in the past, theological debates, published sermonic literature, and newspaper accounts are equally treated in expanding the interpretative scope of the Awakening to emphasize its effects upon politics and society, as well as its temporal span. An impediment to the writing of a sufficiently thorough history of the First Great Awakening has been its identification as an overtly Protestant Christian phenomenon—one that is commonly thought to have been “great.” Such is understandable, given the work done by religious American historians of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, for whom Christianity is the only true religion. But even for those more secularly or ecumenically inclined, the possibility that the Awakening might have involved religions other than Christianity is an alien one. The continued existence of African religious beliefs and practices within slave communities have variously been dismissed as virtually nonexistent, or as not having any significant role in the development of African-American Christianity as a direct consequence of the Awakening. A fundamentalist religious revival seized an important section of Indian Country starting in the late 1730s and running through the early 1760s, and\n\n8 Introduction\n\nthough it shares much in common with the Protestant revivals in terms of origins and goals, because it forms the backdrop to Pontiac’s War and never produced a figure as noteworthy or venerated as Jonathan Edwards of George Whitefield, or sparked an extensive theological debate in print, it has been studiously ignored by historians of the Awakening. These oversights will be corrected in the foregoing work by devising a new, more expansive, and inclusive definition of a religious awakening to include non-Christian religions. There is no question as to the general effect of revivalist evangelicalism in fundamentally redefining the character of Protestant Christianity in British America. Considerable attention has been devoted to the separatism that attended the Awakening, most textbooks depicting the Awakening as having—along with the Enlightenment—a unifying influence upon the colonies prefacing the Revolution. The most recent works credit evangelicalism with, as Thomas S. Kidd declared, “open[ing] up unprecedented . . . opportunities for African Americans, Native Americans, women, the uneducated, and the poor to assert individual religious, and even social authority.” While there is some truth in this, such an assessment is far too optimistic, presumes a unity of purpose among evangelicals that did not exist, and is in no doubt as to the innate rectitude of Christianity. The First Great Awakening did not so much ensconce “the religion of the new birth as a permanent fixture” of American Christianity, as it established fractious sectarianism as its essential character. The use of the term “great” in this work, then represents an acquiescence to a historiographical tradition, and not the author’s judgment.20 Part I covers the roots of evangelicalism in Europe and British America in the seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century Pietist movements and the outbreak of revivalism in Britain and the American colonies after 1700. The intellectual, social, economic, and political background in which these developments took place in the British Atlantic World sets the immediate scene for the spontaneous eruption of American revivalism in times of inordinate stress and anxiety. Part II examines the spread of revivalism during and immediately after George Whitefield’s celebrated tours of the colonies, the dynamics of popular revivalism, and the wider theological contention sparked by it, as well as the rampant divisions that redefined the character of denominations and communities. Part III covers the spread of evangelicalism in the 1750s and 1760s, as well as the impact of the Awakening upon notions of ethnic, racial, and American identity. Here, the nativist American Indian campaign for religious revival and reinvention is given its proper placement as part of a “greater” Awakening. The channeling of the Awakening’s energy into the Seven Years’ War effort figures heavily, as well as how the New Divinity theology growing out of New Light theology meshed with Lockean and Scottish Common Sense political philosophy to prepare the ideological ground upon which the revolutionaries stood in the 1770s.\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nIn sum, this work is a reassertion of the centrality of religion to the colonial American mentalité, as well as the fact that the First Great Awakening was a significant intercolonial and international religious phenomenon that did not fade with the apparent decline in New England revivalism in the decade immediately preceding the Seven Years’ War. In the chapters that follow, the traditional definition of an “awakening” is challenged, eschewing the idea that it was exclusively an event in the history of Protestant Christianity in British America. It is an attempt to confirm the qualified endurance of the Heimert thesis and reconcile it with a careful application of Butler’s interpretation of early American Christianity, but in a larger sense it is a response to McLoughlin’s burning question about the pietistic impulse in American history, which in the case of the eighteenth-century transition into modernity is answered here in the affirmative.\n\nNOTES 1.

Kidd, The Great Awakening, 323. A question that has never yet been asked is why the surge in religious revivalism in British America is called the Great Awakening, rather than the surge in scientific and philosophical endeavor occurring at about the same time, and which is commonly lumped in with the European Enlightenment. An early version of the thesis involved merging these phenomena together into a broadly redefined First Great Awakening, but to do so would have rendered the foregoing work much too large and unwieldy.\n\nPART I\n\n“NO SMALL APPEARANCES OF A DIVINE WORK”\n\nGreat things in England, Wales and Scotland wrought, And in America to pass are brought, Awaken’d souls, warn’d of the wrath to come In Numbers flee to Jesus as their Home. . . . —Weekly History (London), 13 November 1742\n\nChapter 1\n\n“Vital Piety” The European Roots of American Revivalism\n\nIt was nothing short of terrifying. An earthquake and a subsequent series of aftershocks rocked New England on the night and morning of October 29–30, 1727, “attended,” according to Rev. Nathaniel Gookin of Hampton, New Hampshire, “with a Terrible Noise, something like Thunder. The Houses trembled as if they were falling; divers Chimneys were Crack’d and some had their tops broken off. . . .” Such a horrific event triggered conversion experiences for Abigail Aborn and her daughters-in-law, Elizabeth and Martha Aborn of Lynn End, who immediately sought church membership. “God has long been striving with me,” Abigail admitted, “but I have turned a deaf ear to his calls & Counsels and have hardened my heart in Sin.” Elizabeth professed, “yt I can truly Say yt It has been my earnest prayer to God for a long time yt he would better draw me to himself by his Mercy, or drive me home to him by his judgment.” Martha lamented that “I have exposed my Self to all misery both in this Life and yt which is to come and yt ‘tis but Gods Compassions fail not that I am not consumed.” However, each was roused to a renewed conviction of sin by, in Abigail’s words, “the late terrible & Surprizing Earth-quake . . . [through which] I was brôt to a Sight and Sense of my lost and undone Condition by nature. . . .” Indeed, the “Great Earthquake” of 1727 sent thousands of frightened New Englanders streaming into the meetinghouses in search of answers to what had caused it, as well as spiritual comfort to quiet their troubled souls. Applications for church membership and access to the sacraments spiked dramatically, with John Brown of Haverhill reporting that “since the Earthquakes, I have admitted and propounded 154 persons; 87 for the Lord’s Table, the rest for Baptism, or the Renewing the Baptismal Covenant.”1 The mysterious phenomena of earthquakes and storms—which in 1727 were thought to be natural in origin but as yet not understood beyond vague 17\n\n18\n\nChapter 1\n\ntheories about chemical and thermal imbalances within the ground—were variously interpreted as “wonders,” as opposed to something natural and explicable that might nevertheless have spiritual import. Consequently, New England clergymen in 1727 and 1728 took swift advantage of the widespread disquiet and panic afflicting the region, producing blistering jeremiads castigating a backsliding population that the earthquake had been a “loud and awful call to reformation” from God, whose “tokens of his just displeasure” were not only limited to the trembling earth, but also included fierce storms and wildfires. The quake followed a series of fires caused, according to Benjamin Colman, by “the sultry and parching extream [sic] heat of the summer, of a long continuance, for many weeks together. This burning drought penetrated far into the earth, so that many wells and springs of water fail’d that never had before.” The resultant thunderstorms produced unusual episodes of intense lightning that destroyed trees and buildings and sparked fires that Cotton Mather likened to scenes that one could expect to witness during the Apocalypse.2 While not intended to herald the upcoming doom, the sermons took advantage of the anxiety in New England’s towns and villages to revive popular piety. Attempts at periodic revival had been made before, but these took place within the well-circumscribed bounds of sermons delivered in mid-week meetings, fast and thanksgiving days, election days, militia musters, and at executions. Spontaneous religious expression was generally frowned upon in New England, but in the aftermath of the earthquake and a later diphtheria epidemic, an upwelling of religious sensibility led to unprompted outbursts of “enthusiasm” in several New England churches that attracted the attention of Rev. Jonathan Edwards of Northampton, who witnessed the same curious dynamic in his own church in 1734–1735. What had begun as yet another resurgence of popular piety in the wake of disasters soon became something much more significant, with origins that lay much deeper than a collective spiritual angst accompanying the ephemeral panic caused by an earthquake.3 The First Great Awakening cannot be understood properly without its being recognized as a transatlantic phenomenon, the roots of which lie in Europe, with branches stretching across to North America. The advent of Pietism in Holland, Germany, and the British Isles, and their transmission to colonial British America mark a turning point in the history of Protestant Christianity, and are the source of a redefinition of Protestant theology, soteriology, and ecclesiology on both continents. The rising tide of the evangelical Awakening that subsequently resulted from this cross-pollination erupted from different circumstantial contexts but became specifically focused within a millenarian framework arising from the rapid pace of intellectual, economic, social, and political change. It is far more complex than a mere rejection of Newtonian science, Enlightenment rationalism, or theological Arminianism, and more than the incorporation of emotionalism as a component of piety.\n\n“Vital Piety”\n\n19\n\nIt is more than the environmental context of a Continental Europe ravaged by the religious warfare of deadlocked Catholicism and Protestantism in the seventeenth century, and more than the conflicts of imperial powers colonizing North America or the anxieties of colonists beginning to prosper in what had been a forbidding wilderness. It came as much from a previously extant tradition of revivalism as from the introduction of new ideas and practices.  “LIVING BLESSEDLY FOR EVER” Cotton Mather concluded in February 1715/16 that he and his wife needed to recommit themselves to devotional Christianity. Inspired by his reading of the works of a group of Pietist European theologians, chiefly Johann Ardnt’s True Christianity (1606–1609) as translated into English by Anthony W. Boehm, he resolved that he would read Arndt’s masterpiece chapter by chapter every morning as he and his wife lay in bed before finally rising for the day. He wrote in his diary that “It may not only be a Service to myself, but also greatly serve the Interests of Piety in my most excellent Consort, if I should choose, every Morning before I rise, to read a Chapter in my dear Arndt; and communicate unto her the principal Thoughts occurring on it.” Whatever may have been the effect upon Mrs. Mather, Cotton recorded that his daily readings had sparked an intense yearning within him for an “Elevation of the Mind in Prayer, which is in the Verus Christianismus, called Supernatural Prayer, . . . which with a Self annihilation will bring me on towards an Union with God.” This intensity of emotion in the ecstatic losing of oneself in God that became a defining trait of First Great Awakening revivalism reveals the roots of the Awakening in seventeenth-century Pietism.4 Simply defined, Pietism is an emphasis upon the emotional experience of “true” conversion to Christianity and durable faith in imitation of Christ, as opposed to an intellectual understanding of Christian doctrines and adherence to institutionalized practices. Scholars differ widely on specific aspects of Pietism, including its temporal and theological origins. The phenomenon of Pietism has generated debate among historians who disagree about what it means and where it originated, as well as whether it existed as a discrete movement at all. The mystical bent of early modern Pietism appears to owe much—if not actually harkening back—to various forms of medieval mysticism, further obscuring the question of its origins. The term “Pietist” was not used to identify those inclined to it before 1670, and so historians of religion have followed Johannes Wallmann in separating the Pietism that originated at the University of Halle in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries\n\n20\n\nChapter 1\n\nfrom varieties of proto-Pietist and Pietist-like movements that emerged previously. Other scholars’ attempts to widen the chronological scope for Pietism by including those individuals and groups dismissed by Wallmann, or to ignore chronology in preference for more purely theological interpretations, have broadened the definition to such a degree that it becomes difficult to determine precisely what Pietism is, where it came from, and exactly who qualifies as a Pietist.5 Since the patristic age, Christianity has wrestled, Jacob-like, with the sometimes complimentary and at other times mutually exclusive twin powers of faith and reason. The Scientific Revolution, which had commenced in Renaissance Europe, began to unlock secrets of nature that had once been the province of faith, and the discoveries of Copernicus, Galileo, and Sir Isaac Newton posed significant challenges to traditional Christian cosmology, derived as they were from Plato and Aristotle. The effort of theologians to reconcile a world rapidly falling within the bounds of freshly discovered natural laws, Copernican heliocentrism, and Newtonian physics, with one wherein God stops time, reverses the courses of heavenly bodies, and works other miracles in defiance of natural laws, became one of mounting urgency. Anti-intellectual reactions against a religion of the mind in favor of one of the heart had been characteristic of institutionalized Christianity since its foundation, and these took on greater appeal among people coping with an accelerating pace of change. Still others sought ways to reconcile faith and reason in the face of societal transitions and the stresses of multilayered conflicts that profoundly affected Protestantism. However, even though theological arguments certainly influenced the thoughts of those who founded the Pietist movement, pietism cannot be fully comprehended without recognizing its having arisen from the intense sturm und drang of the Counter-Reformation.6 Sixteenth-century Protestant theologians did not deny the power of reason to explain the natural world, but defended the doctrine that the superior truths of Christianity superseded reason, even if they were not necessarily contrary to it. Philip Melanchthon (1497–1560) did not see why philosophy and theology should have an antagonistic relationship, and a steadily growing scholasticism resulted in a pan-Protestant tradition of reconciling “the internal and external evidences of revelation” by the late seventeenth century. Consequently, theology emerged as paramount among the sciences, and it was to pure theology that Dutch Reformed theologians turned as a remedy for the divisions wrought by the Reformation. Jacobus Arminius (1560–1609), professor of theology at the University of Leyden, became attracted to rationalist ideas and repudiated the Calvinist insistence upon total inability of the believer to achieve salvation, as well as the notion of limited atonement. He attracted devotees who became known as the “Arminian” party which, though vehemently decried as “liars and deceivers” by the Synod of Dort (1618–1619), persistently grew in\n\n“Vital Piety”\n\n21\n\ninfluence beneath the surface of doctrinaire Calvinism to become a subject of acrimonious contention for centuries to come.7 Dutch Reformed theologians, along with the French theologian and mystic Jean de Labadie (1610–1674), pioneered Protestant Pietism by variously emphasizing Christian devotional practice over spiritually deadening scholasticism. Anna Maria van Schurman (1607–1678), the first woman to matriculate at the University of Utrecht and a student of Reformed Calvinism, defended the right of women to the same access to education as men on the basis of their equal intellectual potential. She converted to Labadism late in life and finally declared her youthful intellectual precocity to have been a wasted period of vanity. Reason, she concluded, can never be an aid to piety on account of its incompatibility with revelation. In Labadism, she found a community that best resembled the pure Christian communities of the first and second centuries, wherein “all matters are carried out most equably with great joy, ease, and calm, out of mutual and truly Christian love.” Emphasizing communitarianism, Labadist mysticism and millenarian perfectionism uniquely drew adherents from a wide cross section of central European society, but their widely differing reasons for joining the Labadists, apart from a general dissatisfaction with orthodox Lutheranism and Calvinism, did not result in the galvanization of a coherent theology. Labadism’s fervent mysticism and obsessive millenarianism inspired a new emphasis in the Reformed churches on differentiating between the regenerate and the unregenerate that influenced American Puritanism, and their collegia attracted a wide variety of religious seekers and would-be mystics that transformed them from relatively sedate meetings into what can properly be termed revivals.8 A parallel movement harkening back to medieval mysticism, the collegia were small groups, mainly of Anabaptists, who gathered to indulge in free prophecy, apocalypticism, and an ecstatic form of imitatio Christi that bordered on perfectionism. While not specifically Pietistic, the Collegiants did have a direct influence upon the foundation of the Society of Friends in England and, indirectly, also in the formation of Methodism. The mysticism of the Collegiants fed into a movement that came to be known as theosophy, innovated by Valentine Weigel (1533–1588). Weigel emphasized the indwelling of the Spirit of God in the heart of the believer to the extent that he argued on behalf of an almost literal unity between God and the individual at the highest level of religious experience. In what would become a characteristic of Pietism, Weigel exhorted “true” Christians to put off worldly concerns in absolute surrender to God and the cultivation of the spiritual life. These ideas profoundly influenced Johann Arndt (1555–1621), the spiritual progenitor of the Lutheran Pietist movement, whose works emphasized mystical devotion to Christ and the Bible. “Once a Christian has freed himself from the allurements of the world,” F. Ernest Stoeffler summarized, once he\n\n22\n\nChapter 1\n\nor she “has died to the desires of the flesh, and is wholly committed to God in will and affection, a life on the highest ethical plain is a matter of course.”9 Jacob Böhme (1575–1624), surveying the human and material devastation of the early phase of the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648), interpreted it as the ultimate product of intellectual conflicts over superficial doctrinal differences among Catholics and Protestants, when all Christians should always have been united in fraternal love through the indwelling of Christ in the hearts of true believers. Böhme considered the physical and the spiritual to be one and the same, with love as the force binding the cosmos together, and that the sooner the Christians awakened to this truth, the sooner the world would be transformed by the power of love. Thus, the birth of Continental Pietism in the late seventeenth century declared the argument between reason and revelation to be a dead letter, when true life could only be discovered in the “vital piety” of the heart that calmed the spirits of a people traumatized by the experience of war. What the central European Pietists thought secondary to the reconstruction of German society became the essence of the parallel movement that was English Puritanism.10 Just as on the Continent, English Pietism arose as a response within the Puritan movement to persecution. The reign of Edward VI (r. 1547–1553) had been friendly toward Protestants, but his death eventually brought his devout Catholic half-sister Mary to the throne to begin a five-year reign marked by religious repression that compromised her support among English Catholics and sent the most fervent Protestants fleeing to the Continent. These “Marian Exiles,” motivated as much by their political principles as by those of their faith, listened despairingly to reports of immolations of those who dared to confront Mary’s Counter-Reformation that later inspired John Foxe’s Actes and Monuments (1563), better known as the Booke of Martyrs. Consequently, they committed themselves to the absolute purification of the Church of England along Calvinist lines—hence the moniker “Puritans” applied to them by their opponents. One of those martyrs, John Bradford (c. 1510–1555), pioneered a form of English Pietism that owed much to his contacts with the Continental theologians. He persistently railed against the “sweet tunes, ditties, melodies, singing, playing, ringing, knocking, kneeling, standing, lifting, crossing, blessing, blowing, mowing, [and] incensing” prevalent in the Church of England under Henry VIII, and he devoted himself to stripping away what he considered the “popish” detritus of Catholic superstition. Imprisoned in the Tower of London almost immediately upon Mary’s accession, he passed his time writing works that propagated an intimate, personalized Christianity, wherein one must cultivate a direct, affective relationship with Christ. Although Bradford cannot be classified as a Pietist, his example became a model, which the later Puritan Pietists emulated through the turmoil of the Elizabethan and Stuart dynasties.11\n\n“Vital Piety”\n\n23\n\nIt strikes the student of Pietism and Puritanism that the latter inherently incorporated elements of the former and vice versa, insofar as the Puritan concerned himself or herself with the daily practice of piety, and thus satisfactory, precise definitions of both Puritanism and Pietism are elusive. Mysticism can be identified as a common characteristic to all Pietists, but so also is a rigorous methodical emphasis. Perry Miller characterized Puritanism as “Augustinian” in its interpretation of piety, but he concerned himself with underscoring its fundamental rationalism while downplaying its mysticism, which tends to have been conflated with a dour, single-minded fanaticism by their contemporaries and subsequent generations of students and critics. Not all Puritans were Pietists and not all Pietists Puritans. Jerald C. Brauer suggested an interpretative model for Puritan Pietism, which divides what is admittedly an amorphous and dynamic phenomenon into four types: nomism, evangelicalism, rationalism, and mysticism, bearing in mind that these types “participate in each other or are potentially possible through each other and cannot be isolated in any strict way.” Briefly summarized, nomism is an emphasis upon God’s law as set down in scripture and the necessity of obedience; evangelicalism is an emphasis upon God’s love that alters the soul in such a way as to engender complete, trusting submission and obedience to the Law; rationalism is an emphasis upon the power of humanity’s reasoning capabilities “to discern the nature and will of God as it is both revealed in the cosmos, within their own lives, and republished in full clarity in scripture”; mysticism is an emphasis upon an ecstatic “experience of union with the divine ground” of all being “which gives shape and content to . . . religious life, and it is the bedrock on which all else is built.” The individuals sketched below can be located within one of Brauer’s types, but only so long as it is recognized that any given Puritan theologian usually exhibited traits of more than one—hence the danger of typology.12 That Puritanism and what has come to be known as Pietism were mutually identical was a note struck by John Bradford in his last years, and it became a persistent theme in the works of subsequent Puritan theologians who conflated piety with intricate explications of the process of conversion, sanctification, and justification. William Perkins (1558–1602) defined theology as “the science of living blessedly for ever,” meaning that piety is applied theology while theology provided the intellectual underpinnings for piety. This distinction accounts for the strong attachment Puritan theologians developed for the logical treatises of Petrus Ramus, who argued that all arts (logic, grammar, rhetoric, mathematics, physics, and divinity) had a practical aim and that through the methods of technologia or technometria one found in theology the apex of the arts. The goal for anyone is to “live well”—eupraxia—and theology taught the highest eupraxia. Perkins divided the conversion process into ten distinct stages that demanded intense self-examination throughout,\n\n24\n\nChapter 1\n\nand he insisted that a true Christian’s life entailed one of constant spiritual struggle against fear, doubt, and despair as well as against Satan and all his hosts with their enticing, worldly temptations—a common theme appearing in the works of theologians and Christian mystics since St. Augustine. In order to wage that battle successfully, the Puritans emphasized the constant cultivation of godliness through strict observance of the divine law. Dubbed “precisionism” or “preciseness” by continentals, rules for living the godly life were variously expounded by Richard Rogers (c. 1550–1618), John Dod (c. 1549–1645), Nicholas Bound (d. 1613), and John Downame (d. 1652). There is no question, however, that the greatest expositors of Puritan precisionism were Lewis Bayly (c. 1575–1631) and Richard Sibbes (1577–1635), who bridged the gap between precisionism, mysticism, and the Biblicism characteristic of Continental Pietism.13 Bayly put forward a rigorous and precise rule for living the godly life in the Practice of Piety: Directing a Christian How to Walk that He May Please God (1611), which is replete with vivid imagery describing the worldly and otherworldly consequences for those who opt in favor of godliness as well as for those who refuse. Every part of the day and every action had to be infused with meditation upon the certainty of death and the bliss or torments of the afterlife, with every action dedicated to the glory of God and the development of one’s spirit. Recalling the allegory in the “Song of Songs,” Bayly exhorted his readers to “get forthwith the oil of piety in the lamp of thy conversion; that thou mayest be in continual readiness to meet the bride-groom.” Constant reading and rereading of the Bible formed the central core of Bayly’s method, which is consistent with the Biblicism propagated by William Teellinck and Johannes Koch, among other Pietists. However, Bayly did not advocate personal devotion to Christ, which he considered a variety of idolatry, but rather prayerful meditation upon God’s law and particularly strict observance of the Sabbath. Sibbes’s The Bruised Reed and the Smoaking Flax (1630) and A Breathing after God (1639) represent the mystical turn taken by some Puritan Pietists which, like their continental counterparts, encouraged an almost erotic love for Christ that longs for communion—unio mystica—between God and the devotee. Communion for Sibbes was only possible through continuous prayer, which provided the key to comprehending the Bible, the enormous spiritual significance of the sacraments as well as one’s conversion, and only through such discipline could the believer find inner peace and joy. Identical themes pervade the works of Joseph Hall (1574–1656), Francis Rous (1579–1659), Jeremiah Burroughs (1599–1646), Thomas Goodwin (1600–1680), Richard Baxter (1615–1691), and without question John Bunyan (1628–1688), whose The Pilgrim’s Progress (1678, 1684) represents a literary apotheosis within Puritan Pietism.14\n\n“Vital Piety”\n\n25\n\nThe theological apogee of Puritan Pietism was reached with the publication of two seminal works by Jeremy Taylor (1613–1667): The Rule and Exercises of Holy Living (1650) and its sequel The Rule and Exercises of Holy Dying (1651). The unifying theme in these works is that the Christian life (and death) is and must be beautiful, the essence of which “was sweetness, reasonableness, and implicit trust in a good God of whom all creation speaks to the devout spirit.” Blending the methodology of Lewis Bayly’s Practice of Pietie, the emphasis upon the sublimity of ceremonial eupraxia in the works of Lancelot Andrewes (1555–1626), and latitudinarian ideas gaining ascendancy during the Cromwellian Protectorate, Taylor’s aesthetic brand of Puritan Pietism attempted to salve the anxieties of Englishmen struggling to cope with profound religious and political conflict and change. It is consistent with orthodox Calvinism in an emphasis upon good works and eupraxia being inevitable products of true conversion, their external beauty emanating from the beauty within. However, by concentrating on the methodical cultivation of “holy living” and “holy dying,” Taylor deemphasized Calvinist doctrine as secondary to the development of a personal, ecstatic relationship with a God whose presence “fill[s] every place” and continually preparing for death, “every day knocking at the gates of the grave.” Nevertheless, Taylor’s works exerted enormous influence upon the continued development of Pietism and became required reading in both Europe and the American colonies.15 The “Pietist” label, however, was first applied to the German Lutheran founders of the movement, Philipp Jakob Spener (1635–1705) and his disciple August Hermann Francke (1663–1727), who harnessed the individualism and populism of the Reformation to campaign for spiritual regeneration and social justice. Spener was exposed to English Puritanism as a youth and drew much of his theological inspiration from the works of William Perkins and Lewis Bayly and propagated his ideas in collegia pietatis organized for group biblical studies, wherein such “conventicles” he advocated greater individual social involvement and lay participation in church government. Christianity for Spener had to be essentially practical, concerned with individual and societal reformation rather than intellectual development, which had drawn in Lutheran theologians as much as it had their Dutch counterparts. In his highly influential Pia Desideria (1675), Spener allowed reason its utility in advancing human wisdom, which can discover natural laws, but he insisted that reason could never encompass the overarching “divine wisdom” that inherently defies earthly logic and confounds mere human wisdom. The plain, straightforward message of Christ’s teachings trumps the proud, empty intellectual calisthenics of the scholastics, who had become boastful and arrogant even as they maneuvered to gain power at the expense of the people. Once believers took within themselves the spirit of Christ, a miraculous transformation of the world\n\n26\n\nChapter 1\n\nwould take place, eliminating all earthly distinctions that continually fostered inequality, poverty, war, and injustice, thus ushering in the Millennium.16 August Hermann Francke taught Greek and Oriental languages—later theology—at the newly founded University of Halle in Saxony and pastored the village church in Glaucha, a suburb of Halle. There, he experienced firsthand the utter misery of the people following the Thirty Years’ War: the dreadful poverty, hunger, physical and emotional degeneration, and above all, the orphaned and half-orphaned children, for whom he founded a school. This experience made him aware of how distant the churches had become from people’s lives, and under the mentorship of Spener he came to the conviction that the churches had been taken over by theologians arguing about questions that ultimately could never be conclusively answered, rather than by pastors ministering to the vital concerns of Christianity in the everyday lives of the common people. The Protestant churches had splintered into many denominations which wasted time and energy in fruitless doctrinal and theological disputation, effectively ignoring those in greatest need of spiritual guidance. At best this resulted in the creation of a clerical class which distanced itself from the people, and at worst justified religious warfare. The only solution was interdenominationalism that he hoped would result in a union of the Protestant churches. The other responsibility abdicated by the churches had been education, to which Francke dedicated himself, building a school for impoverished and orphaned boys in Halle that stressed literacy as well as ethical and spiritual values. The inculcation of these precepts, Francke believed, would forge weapons that could defeat poverty and ignorance and inaugurate an emphasis upon early education that became a hallmark of Pietism.17 Influenced by the writings of English Pietists from the Puritan tradition, Francke advocated the systematization of the Christian’s life along lines originally laid down by Perkins and Bayly. However, Francke is best remembered for the impressive charitable institutions he established in and around Halle, particularly the dispensary which produced and distributed medicines on a scale that prefigured the modern pharmaceutical company. He branched out to engage in extensive trading ventures that procured goods from as far away as China and generated enormous revenues that helped finance the Orphan House, the schools, the dispensary, and supporting institutions. Christianity for Francke was for naught if it did not have a social activist element, and the ultimate purpose of Francke’s charitable activities was the propagation of his brand of Pietism through the dissemination of Bibles and religious treatises cranked out by his own press in Latin, Greek, German, French, Dutch, English, and a variety of Slavonic languages. Thus, Halle became a hub of intellectual activity and exchange with links radiating out as far as Russia and America, while Halle proselytes fanned out across Europe propagating Franckean Pietism. While this cannot be construed as revivalism, it did\n\n“Vital Piety”\n\n27\n\nprovide a model for international evangelism that inspired eighteenth-century evangelicals to ponder the near possibility of ultimate Protestant union. The most direct line connecting European and American Pietism, however, ran through England, and its most prominent exponent was Cotton Mather.18 “GOD WILL VOUCHSAFE A MARVELLOUS EFFUSION OF HIS OWN SPIRIT” The Puritans of the 1620s were caught between a rock and hard place: suffering increasing intolerance from a Church they were committed to reforming and duty-bound to obey a hostile monarch—Charles I—who would eagerly harry or slaughter them out of England. The option of going to America became more attractive, and thus began the “Great Migration” of the 1630s. The Separatists, having left England for Holland, fretted over the gradual erosion of their cultural and religious identity in that country’s relatively liberal environment, and determined to migrate yet again—this time to what was vaguely called “New England.” Plymouth Plantation was far more to their liking than Holland and the “Pilgrims” prospered, attracting the interest of mainstream Puritans in England who had begun to ponder a radical new strategy for effecting the final reformation of the Church of England. Obtaining a charter from Charles I, John Winthrop’s Massachusetts Bay Company affirmed their allegiance to the crown and to the Church of England, planning to establish a “holy commonwealth” that they were not at liberty to attempt in England. However, theological differences surfaced immediately, as the New England Puritans attempted to work out a satisfactory ecclesiastical polity. Ambiguities and confusion over Calvinist doctrines in New England led to heated debates over the “preparation” one (perhaps) underwent prior to election, which consisted of conviction and humiliation for sin, vocation, faith, justification, ingrafting (union with Christ), adoption (an infusion of Christ’s Spirit), sanctification, and finally glorification. All agreed that sinners could not prepare themselves for Grace, but the language of some implied a concession to Arminianism, which led Anne Hutchinson to accuse the New England clergy of apostasy and lack of spiritual authority. Roger Williams deplored New England’s doctrinal laxity in allowing the unregenerate to hear sermons, pray, and worship with the saints. The Cambridge Platform (1648) sought to settle these disputes, but new ones over the sacrament of baptism exercised New England minds vis-à-vis families consisting of both the regenerate and unregenerate. Thus began the controversy over the Synod of 1662 that resulted in the highly contentious Halfway Covenant. Church attendance and membership appeared to decline among second- and third-generation New Englanders, and a 1679 synod was convened to discuss\n\n28\n\nChapter 1\n\na marked decline in manners and morals. Metacomet’s War (1675–1676) and the Salem witchcraft crisis of 1691–1693 raised further questions about the validity of the Puritan “errand into the wilderness” with which Increase Mather (1639–1723) and his son Cotton (1663–1728) wrestled.19 Cotton Mather is the link between Puritan and Continental Pietism and the faint stirrings of American evangelicalism, as he labored to merge the conservative Calvinism of his grandfather’s generation with Halle Pietism, to which he was introduced by his friend Edward Bromfield, founder of the Anglican Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SPCK). Building fruitful correspondences with Francke, Anthony Wilhelm Böhme (d. 1725), and other European Pietists in the last two decades of his life, Mather grew in his conviction that Protestant union was a real possibility. However, European theologians and clergymen were nearly unanimous in their conviction that America was a land unknown to Christ, the “outer darkness” and the bulk of American Christians as the “worthless servant” mentioned in the Parable of the Talents in Matthew 25:30. Mather vehemently denied this in the general introduction to his Magnalia Christi Americana (1702), his massive twovolume history of Christianity in New England. However, in a letter Mather sent to Francke fifteen years later he suggested that a spark might well have originated from Europe, but that the “Light” burned brighter and with a purer flame in New England. Mather worked energetically to make this point in his correspondence, sending as proof a copy of the Magnalia to Böhme in 1716 and proclaiming “American Puritanism, to be so much of a Piece with the Frederician Pietism, that if it were possible for the Book to be transferred unto our Friends in the Lower Saxony, it would find some Acceptance, and be a little serviceable to their glorious Intentions”—meaning Protestant union. Edward Bromfield put Mather in contact with Böhme and Francke in 1717, and professed to Francke that “there is not to be found a place in which true and genuine Christianity is more cultivated than here in New England.” He impatiently dismissed the traditional Christian belief that the West is the realm of the Antichrist and America as the “outer darkness” in a sermon that asserted that the English Puritan immigrants had brought light where there had been darkness and “a Principal Glory of it, has been the Purity of the CHRISTIANITY, which has been brought unto these Indians, in our Attempts to Christianize them.”20 Mather was certain in his belief that the Reformation had withered and become corrupted in Continental Europe, the established Protestant churches succumbing to the blandishments of power and persecuting “Christians who tried to reestablish true Christianity” in the same way the Roman Catholic Church harried Protestants through the campaigns of the Counter-Reformation. Mather saw in the works of the continental Pietists an identical conviction, fully confirmed in his reading of Böhme’s English translation of Pietas\n\n“Vital Piety”\n\n29\n\nHallensis (1707), Francke’s historical summary of German Pietism which notes these persecutions born of “Ignorance and Impiety” resisted by “some eminent Persons who boldly gave their Testimony against the Vices of the Age, and Corruptions of the Church.” However, “since Christianity hath been so unhappily Rent into many Sects and Parties,” European Protestantism had grown vulnerable, and only with the efforts of the German pioneers of Pietism could Christianity be saved by galvanizing Protestantism in the original evangelical spirit of the Reformation. As far as Cotton Mather was concerned, New England remained the last bastion of true Christianity and the Protestant Reformation. Mather’s explanation for this is a highly exaggerated spirit of ecumenism among the New England churches, which “kindly admit the adherents of all the different denominations to their communion and Eucharist, and grant them all ecclesiastical privileges. . . . There are Calvinists who admit Lutherans, Presbyterians who admit Episcopalians, Paedobaptists who admit Anti-Paedobaptists, whenever the light of sincere piety gleams among them.” This ecumenism to him indicated a processional adoption in America of the Evangelium Aeternum (“Eternal Gospel”) formulated in the thirteenth century by the Italian eschatologist Joachim of Fiore, which early eighteenth-century American and European Pietists agreed was being fulfilled in their time and would end with the true and complete union of all Christians. Such a hope also fed his millenarian beliefs. “We are got into the very Dawn of the Day, when God will vouchsafe a marvellous Effusion of His own Spirit upon many Nations, and REFORMATION, with all Piety, and Charity, shall gain the Ascendant, over those Men and Things, that for many Ages have been the Oppressors of it.” 21 German Pietism infused not just the Lutheran and Reformed churches, but also the Anabaptist sects scattered throughout Central Europe. Hutterites, Mennonites, the Unitas Fratrum (“United Brotherhood”), and various other groups generally referred to as the Wiedertäufer—or Täufer (Baptists) for short—struggled to find security, toleration, and sectarian cohesion through the fitful vicissitudes of the Thirty Years’ War period. William Penn (1644–1718), after recently being converted to English Quakerism, toured the Palatinate in southern Germany in 1677 to visit Anabaptist communities and, impressed by their pacifist quietism, invited them to emigrate to his newly founded colony of Pennsylvania when he received the charter for his “holy experiment” from Charles II in 1681. Those willing and able to do so readily accepted the opportunity to flee the religious strife, economic troubles, and political instability that persistently followed the Peace of Westphalia (1648) that ended the Thirty Years’ War, and led by the Mennonite Pietist Daniel Francis Pastorius (1651–1720), they established a settlement northeast of Philadelphia known as Germantown. Quickly becoming a locus for German and Dutch immigration, Germantown grew steadily after 1700, with the\n\n30\n\nChapter 1\n\nGerman population of Pennsylvania booming with a sudden influx of Palatine Germans migrating southward from New York, where they had originally been settled by the British government. While arising out of radical European Pietism, the American Mennonites strove to keep a low profile as “the quiet in the land,” reluctant to invite the persecution they episodically endured in Germany and had come to expect wherever they settled. Others who were not so inclined had fostered a steady undercurrent of apocalyptic expectation that persisted into the nineteenth century, which became a hallmark of the First Great Awakening. By far, the most significant infusion of European Pietism that laid the foundation for the Awakening in the Middle Colonies was that initiated by Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen (1692–1747).22 The Dutch Reformed Church in America at the start of the eighteenth century was a denomination clinging precariously to cohesion. Still reeling from the sociopolitical aftershocks of the English conquest of New Netherland in 1664 and the subsequent pressures of Anglicization to which the Dutch merchant communities acquiesced, the Reformed congregations struggled with a crisis in identity. The clergy—known in Dutch as the dominies—had developed an alliance with the merchant communities built around a shared affluence that the clergymen were anxious to protect. This alliance inevitably led to bitter disputes between dominies and congregations over clerical salaries, compounded by external political disturbances and precipitated by the annexation of New York to the Dominion of New England (1685), the Glorious Revolution in England (1688–1689), and Leisler’s Rebellion (1688–1691). While Leisler’s Rebellion was a popular revolt against a further weakening of the Dutch cultural presence, ostensibly in the face of an expansionist French Catholic threat, the dominies consistently preached against it from their pulpits, with one pastor derisively referring to the rebels as “Boors and butterboxes.” The dominies were seen as ethnic and cultural traitors by their middle- and lower-class parishioners, and Dutch culture in New York gradually gave way to British identity in the first two decades of the eighteenth century. It remained quite vibrant in the neighboring colony of East Jersey in the 1720s and 1730s, however, despite significant influxes of Palatine Germans, English, Irish and Scots-Irish, as well as immigrants from New York and New England. It was into this milieu that William Bertholf (1693–1726) attempted to introduce Dutch Pietism to New Jersey, gaining support based on his appeal among the Leislerians, but it did not generate a significant following before the arrival of Frelinghuysen.23 Frelinghuysen emerged from a Dutch Reformed tradition heavily influenced by English Puritanism. Upon completion of his ministerial training, he took a pastorate in East Friesland, which was governed by the Elector Georg Albert, who subscribed to a brand of Pietism, emphasizing a rigorous praxis pietatis that likewise influenced Frelinghuysen through contact with Sicco\n\n“Vital Piety”\n\n31\n\nTjaden (1693–1726) and Johan Verschuir (1680–1737), who were nicknamed “the sanctimonians” (fijnen). Frelinghuysen consequently became the strictest of Pietists, believing that one must continually strive to cultivate the indwelling Spirit of God once conversion had taken place. For him, conversion was a total rebirth that completely destroyed the old person and created a new one, and that one who has been “born again” must struggle to achieve godliness despite all hardships and trials with which God constantly tests the elect. He demanded that one strive to achieve spiritual perfection in this life, even knowing that such an achievement was practically impossible, as those who come closest to it in faith would earn salvation. “It is both necessary and expedient for a Christian frequently to consider what he now is,” wrote William Teellinck in 1631, and Frelinghuysen grounded his Pietism in that admonishment. Only through an unflinching knowledge of the self could anyone begin to know God, beginning with the discovery of an inner vocation and an awareness “of the leading of God’s Spirit in their hearts.” He warned his congregations about the wrath of God toward those hypocrites who claim to know him and do not, as contrasted by the bliss experienced by those who have come to an “experimental” godliness. In one remarkable sermon, Frelinghuysen compared the believer’s search for Christ to Mary’s search for her risen son at the tomb: “O my Saviour, my precious lovely Lord Jesus, in fellowship with thee along can my soul find rest; O most lovely fair One, whose love along can quicken my soul, come close to my soul, turn again, my soul’s friend, my treasure, thou portion of my soul’s satisfaction.”24 Frelinghuysen’s Christocentric emphasis upon experimental Christianity was aimed at a godliness that veered toward perfectionism without crossing the boundary line ignored by the mystics. Nevertheless, the New Birth gave converts the power to perceive themselves almost as clearly as God did, conferring as it did, in the words of Frelinghuysen’s friend and colleague Eduard Meiners (1691–1752), “the wisdom of the understanding, of the rightness of the judgment . . . in the conformity of the operation of the soul with that of God.” The growing distaste for scholasticism in Dutch Calvinism, as the seventeenth century drew to a close, pushed Frelinghuysen and those in his circle increasingly away from it and toward mystical, evangelical Pietism. The heart of the believer must be oriented first toward conversion and rebirth, and then to the cultivation of holiness. Following the Puritan theologians who conceived of conversion as processing by discrete stages, Frelinghuysen spoke about the same process which for him centered on rigorous and anxious selfexamination. Introspection should lead to anxiety and then to despair, equating with the Puritan idea of “legall feare.” However, lest such anguish lead to suicide, he reminded his audiences that Satan eagerly waited to bring those lost souls to him who endeavors to take their own lives. Rather, this spiritual “strife is the way to salvation, for God leads his children through conflict to\n\n32\n\nChapter 1\n\nconquest.” Having finally acknowledged one’s lowly, debased state before God, one can come to true contrition and repentance of worldly sins to begin the upward journey to salvation. Even when one becomes assured of conversion, the process of introspection continues, for rebirth becomes “as a mirror in which to examine your condition and to see if the work of grace is wrought in you.”25 Frelinghuysen did retain Teellinck’s interpretation of the covenants, which was inherently rational: “Men must understand the conditions and terms of the covenant; the laws to which a member of the covenant is obligated.” Only those who have completely and contritely humbled themselves before God in light of their absolutely debased nature were worthy of being “Christ’s people, the ones who share in the covenant of God, heirs of salvation.” There is, however, a distinct hint of Arminianism in Frelinghuysen’s soteriology, and his High Calvinism demanded that he find some logical way through which to thread his theology in order to avoid seeming to preach in favor of means. He had accused the Arminians of idolizing freewill, but found himself in a precarious position encountered by so many orthodox Calvinists—of countenancing some element of merit to individual action in the process of salvation. At the very least, the recipient of grace has to accept it, which implies an intellectual and spiritual assent to be saved, not to mention the cultivation of holiness itself. However, he implied what has been called “double predestination,” meaning that not only election or damnation, but one’s “birth, place of residence, the course of his life and achievements, and his death” are also foreordained. What appears to be human effort is only the result of actions directed by God. Consequently, the convert may gain an assurance of his or her salvation, which is an act of faith that leaves the initial mental assent to the covenants far behind. Good works, which for the Arminians are a means to salvation, are for the Calvinists the product of faith, which Frelinghuysen defined as the act of putting one’s trust in God’s benevolence and mercy.26 Concerning sanctification and glorification, Frelinghuysen held to the Frisian Catechism (1718), which posited a two-part process of conversion that begins when “a convicted sinner first turns from Satan to God” and is completed when the convert “rises again from his daily stumblings, or even from a hard fall, and with repentance turns again to the Lord.” This belief would appear to allow for the possibility of falling from grace if, having taken “a hard fall,” the would-be convert did not at last turn back toward God. Frelinghuysen argued against such a possibility by stressing the need for constantly renewing one’s relationship to God in the practice of piety. Inspired by Taylor’s Holy Living and Holy Dying, Frelinghuysen viewed life as a constant trial to demonstrate one’s worthiness before God while beset with opportunities to turn back, with the most arduous test administered at the moment of death, which can be embraced only by the truly holy without fear or dread.\n\n“Vital Piety”\n\n33\n\nGiven that holy living is such a demanding and ceaseless endeavor, only the most devout—the most precise in their striving for perfection despite its ultimate unattainability—could ever negotiate the narrow way to heaven, and only those relative few destined for salvation could begin, much less finish, the journey. One of the fundamental tenets necessary to keeping one’s feet on the narrow way was constantly to observe the Golden Rule and love one’s enemies. Another was a cultivation not just of spiritual humility, but also of material humility, shunning wealth and the things of the world. Frelinghuysen constantly preached against the rich and those who sought wealth, a conviction that resonated deeply within the Pietistic tradition. That this is so hard to achieve offers some indication of how few deserved salvation. Concentrating as he did upon the practice of piety, Frelinghuysen steadfastly avoided the millenarianism that ensnared most continental Pietists and became an obsession among American Puritans.27 In 1719, Frelinghuysen attracted the attention of Matthias Winterwyck, Willem Banker, and Bernhardus Freeman, who were involved in colonial ventures in New York, and they "
