        "text": "BELIEFS.—Sabbath reform work was carried on by the Seventh Day Baptists with great zeal. A statement taken from one of the committees on Sabbath reform, published in the first Na­tional Seventh Day Baptist Council at Chicago in 1890, reads thus :\n\n\"We do not believe this change from the first to the seventh day will ever be accomplished by the Sunday-keeping Christians. Their arguments in the past have been destructive of the foundation upon which their practice was built, and it is only by convincing them of their own error and a necessity for a change that we can hope for any Sabbath observance in this country a few years hence. We have a great work to do and this work will not be done unless it be clone by Sab­bath-observers. These are the facts which confront us, and the facts which we as a people must be prepared to meet. The time for the prosecution of this great work is limited. A few years of unfruitful effort for the enforcement of Sunday laws will prove to those now engaged in this effort that there is no hope of suc­cess in this direction.\n\n\"This effort to revive Sunday observance by civil legislation will help to agitate the question of rightful authority for the Sabbath, and offer a thousand oppor­tunities for us to work as we never have worked be­fore. The conflict between the Lord's Sabbath and no Sabbath must soon be met by the people, and we Sab­bath-keepers are instruments in God's hands for help­ing to decide the question in favor of the former and against the latter with all its evil consequences. The work we must do is a great one; one requiring great consecration, great self-sacrifice, great energies and large means.\"—Proceedings of the Seventh Day Bap­tist Council, pp. 6o-62.\n\nThe means of accomplishing the work of pro­moting the Sabbath and launching a stronger program among their own members are stated in Proceedings of the Seventh Day Baptist Council as follows:\n\n\"A full consecration of ourselves and our means to God in the work of saving our country from the evils of no-Sabbathism,\"\n\n\"A better observance of the Sabbath by the Sev­enth Day Baptists themselves. We must remember that Sabbath observance is a sign of loyalty to God, and if we love Him, we will keep His Commandments,\"\n\n\"Our children should be taught in our families, both by precept and example, the reasons for, and the importance of, true Sabbath observance and the sin of violating the Sabbath law.\"\n\n\"Our children need th have more frequent lessons in the Sabbath school on the subject of the Sabbath, and much more instruction from the pulpit on the ways of meeting the arguments of our opponents.\"\n\nOur Sabbath publications—books, tracts and pe­riodicals—should be kept in every family and be much more thoroughly studied.\"\n\n\"The Sabbath Recorder should teach more fully the sin of Sabbath desecration by our own people.\"\n\n\"We recommend the continuance of the Outlook and Sabbath Quarterly according to its present general purpose.\"\n\n\"We believe that a paper devoted to general Sab­bath reform work and the discussion of Sunday legis­lation is demanded and recommend the publication of such a paper whenever the Tract Board deem it prac­ticable.\"\n\n\"We recommend a much more general distribu­tion of Sabbath tracts.\"\n\n\"We believe more Sabbath reform work should be done by the living teacher, and that the missionaries sent out by our societies should consider that a part of their evangelical work.\"\n\nSeventh Day Baptists maintain that the state should not interfere with the religious convic­tions and practice of its citizens. They also place themselves against the existence of secret societies, and highly support the temperance so­ciety.\n\nThese Sabbathkeepers are evangelical in faith. They accept the divinity of Christ, the personality of the Holy Spirit, the immaterial nature and the immortality of the human soul, salvation through atonement by repentance, by resurrection of the dead, the eternal judgment, sufficiency of the Scriptures, obedience in bap­tism and harmony in obedience to the Saviour's commands regarding the Sabbath. They differ from other Baptists in regard to the seventh-day Sabbath. Their doctrinal views were last set forth in an expose adopted by the conference in 1880.\n\nOne of their chief reasons for keeping the Sabbath is that it was observed and held sacred by Christ and the apostolic church. They be­lieve Christ to be the final sanction for the Sabbath, and have held firmly to their doctrine regarding this for three hundred years. They believe that Christ would have them to be friendly with other churches and cooperate with them in every good work. In recent years they belong to the National Bible Schools organiza­tions, the Foreign Missions Conference, the Layman's Missionary Movement, the Federal Council of Churches, the Faith and Order Movement, and other kindred efforts looking toward united work on the part of Christ's fol­lowers.\n\nMEMBERSHIP.—Statistics of 1944 list sixty-four Seventh Day Baptist churches in the United States, with an inclusive membership of 6,581. ( Yearbook of American. Churches, 1945.)\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventist denomination re­ceived its Sabbath light in 1844, when Rachel D. Preston, a member of the First Verona Seventh Day Baptist church, New York, intro­duced the doctrine of the true Sabbath among the Adventists at Washington, New Hamp­shire. From the Sabbathkeeping church then formed has sprung the Seventh-day Adventist denomination in this country and others,"
