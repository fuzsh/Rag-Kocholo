        "text": "Baptists can officially trace their heritage back to 1609 in Amsterdam, Holland. As a result of a series of meetings of English Separatists John Smyth and Thomas Helwys with the Dutch Anabaptists, the Mennonites, the first English “baptistic” church was started (Baptists and the Bible, p. 12). Since there wasn’t a church sign out front, we don’t know if the church name included the word “Baptist,” but this assembly of believers in Christ was both reformed and baptistic in their doctrine. Initially, these dissenters from the Anglican and Catholic churches baptized by affusion (pouring), but what made them baptistic was their insistence that ONLY those who professed faith in Christ could be baptized. Smyth and Helwys were not the first men to insist upon believer’s baptism. Prior to this group, Christian groups who baptized believers again were often referred to as Anabaptists. (It is important to realize “Anabaptists” included a large group of people over centuries of time many of whom were quite extreme and held heretical beliefs.) “Baptist” was the name given to those who practiced believer’s baptism by others who opposed them in England. In those days, Baptists were divided into two groups particular and general Baptists, but both agreed on believer’s baptism. Today, Berean would not fit into either the particular or general Baptist associations.\n\nAmerican Baptists\n\nIn addition to these men, Roger Williams is given credit for forming the first Baptist church in America in 1638 where again the separation of church and state, soul liberty, and believer’s baptism by immersion were hallmarks of this first baptistic church. William’s contribution was short lived. And were it not for men like John Clarke, Obadiah Holmes, Thomas Gould, and Isaac Backus, Baptists may not have grown in America like they did. In 1644, the first confession of faith was adopted by multiple churches with the specific name “Baptist” in the confession of faith.\n\nToday, Baptist groups constitute the largest non-Catholic assembly in America. With well over 25 million Baptists of tremendous variety, it is impossible to speak for all of these churches. There are both liberal and conservative Baptist churches with much variety in doctrine and practice. Although there are some exceptions, all Baptists generally hold to the following distinctions which separate them from other Protestant denominations: First and foremost, Baptists are followers of Christ.\n\nThe acrostic B-A-P-T-I-S-T-S (seen below) can be used to articulate what makes Berean different from liberal Baptist churches, other mainline denominational churches, and the Catholic tradition. Berean Baptist Church is also committed to each of the five solas of the Reformation because each is clearly taught in the Bible (read more). Christ, Scripture, Faith, Grace, and all to the glory of God alone are all characteristics of true churches.\n\nS is for Separation\n\nFrom the beginning, Baptists have insisted upon the separation of the church and state. Baptists believe the authority of the State should never be used to force conversion, baptism, attendance, or compliance with church ordinances. Baptists believe that Christ is the Lord of the church and reject any suggestion that an earthly king has authority in the church. However, Baptists do not believe this separation prevents church members from involving themselves in the affairs of the state or serving in the defense of their nation. This distinguishes Baptists from those in the Anabaptist heritage."
