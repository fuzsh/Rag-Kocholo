Hope Media Group (HMG) has announced intent to purchase 93.5 WVIP to serve as its New York City outlet for “Vida Unida,” the Christian media corporation’s Spanish-language music network. The name Vida Unida—or “Life Together”—is about being united with God, families, and the community. The WVIP-FM signal originates from the Bronx and covers more than 13 million residents in the five boroughs and New Jersey, 3.8 million of which are Hispanic.

Joe Paulo, CEO and President of Hope Media Group, shares “If someone had told us that within the first two years from Vida Unida’s Houston launch we would be in nine markets, including three of the top four largest Spanish-speaking markets in the U.S., we would have not believed it. Yet God has made this possible because the need and opportunity are so great. We can’t wait to engage Spanish-speaking New Yorkers through Vida Unida to love Jesus, serve others, and spread life-changing hope.”

Myrka Dellanos, host of Vida Unida’s morning show, “Myrka en la Manana,” and an Emmy Award-winning TV personality, shares "As Vida Unida extends its reach to New York City, I am filled with immense excitement. The vibrancy and strength of the Latino community in NYC are unparalleled and being part of their daily lives through this station will be an honor. Together, we can uplift spirits, bridge cultural gaps, and instill hope as we embrace the diversity and resilience that define this great city.”

This acquisition builds on the strategic expansion of Vida Unida’s platforms across the nation following HMG’s merger with Way Media in May 2022. Hope Media Group is the combination of two organizations with more than 75 years of ministry and media experience, beginning in 1982 with KSBJ/Houston and 1987 with WAYJ/Fort Myers. HMG engages over 15 million times monthly with its worldwide audience with positive multimedia content via radio and digital. To learn more, visit hopemediagroup.com.
