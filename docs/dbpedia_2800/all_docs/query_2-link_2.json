        "text": "Hope Media Group is purchasing WVIP/New Rochelle, NY (93.5 FM in New York) for its Spanish Christian Vida Unida network.\n\nWVIP is currently a brokered station that programs a mixture of Jamaican/Caribbean music and talk. Selling price is reportedly $8.15 mil. Seller is Hudson-Westchester Radio, Inc., (owned by the late Bill O’Shaughnessy, who passed in May 2022).\n\nWVIP is a Class A 1750 watts @ 433 ft. WVIP studios are in New Rochelle, with the transmitter located in the Bronx, New York.\n\nJoe Paulo, CEO and President of Hope Media Group, says “If someone had told us that within the first two years from Vida Unida’s Houston launch we would be in nine markets, including three of the top four largest Spanish-speaking markets in the U.S., we would have not believed it. Yet God has made this possible because the need and opportunity are so great. We can’t wait to engage Spanish-speaking New Yorkers through Vida Unida to love Jesus, serve others, and spread life-changing hope.”\n\nVida Unida’s morning host Myrka Dellanos shares “As Vida Unida extends its reach to New York City, I am filled with immense excitement. The vibrancy and strength of the Latino community in NYC are unparalleled and being part of their daily lives through this station will be an honor. Together, we can uplift spirits, bridge cultural gaps, and instill hope as we embrace the diversity and resilience that define this great city.”\n\nHMG launched the organization’s faith-based, family-oriented, Spanish radio station, Vida Unida, on KVDU/Houston (91.7FM) in November 2021. HMG added WLFE/Miami (90.9) in a purchase from from Calvary Chapel of Kendall, FL in September 2022.\n\nVida Unida currently airs on the following stations:\n\n91.7FM KHVU – Houston, TX\n\n90.9FM WLFE – Miami, FL\n\n89.7 KAWA HD2 – Dallas/Fort Worth, TX\n\n96.3 KKWA HD2 – Portland, OR\n\n88.7 WAYM HD2 – Nashville, TN\n\n89.9 W210CA – Birmingham, AL\n\n88.1 WAYF HD2 / 90.3 W212CG – West Palm Beach, FL\n\n91.5 WJWA HD2 / 100.1 W261CW Evansville, IN\n\nHope Media Group is a family of media brands that engage people to love Jesus, serve others and spread hope through radio, events, online content and mobile apps. Headquartered in Houston, the brands include Houston-focused KSBJ/Houston, and the national network of WayFM stations."
