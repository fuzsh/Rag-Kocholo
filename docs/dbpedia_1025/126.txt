Jesus Of Montreal(1989)

Written and Directed by Denys Arcand, French Canadian

Allegory and Passion Play

The film is an allegory concerning a group of actors' attempt to put on a modernized, relevant Passion Play -- so the film is attempting to do what the characters in the film are attempting to do; it is a story about characters producing the same story the original story is also telling.

A Passion Play or Easter Play is a traditional re-enactment of the trial, suffering and resurrection of Christ, traditionally performed during Lent (roughly the forty days before Easter).

Because the film functions as an allegory, try not to get too caught up in the literal story line other than how it represents Christ's final days, as retold in the Gospels; the story line is attempting to represent and retell the key elements of Christ's life and situate them in a modern context.

I use the film because I think it succeeds at what it sets out to do:

1) It retells the Gospels so that people who aren't familiar with them will be.

2) It shows how these stories are still relevant not only to Christians but to the larger, secular and perhaps non-Christian audience and culture.

3) It ultimately transcends the philosophical, theological and historical issues that I usually focus on in my classes, without avoiding those same issues: it has its cake and eats it to: it makes you think and then it makes you feel. This, I believe, is the function of literature.

What To Watch For

Throughout the film, watch for the two choir singers from the opening credit and note where you see them and what they are doing.

Bring Kleenex for the last day. If you don't need it, seek counseling.
