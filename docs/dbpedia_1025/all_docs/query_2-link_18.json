This document provides a summary and analysis of Denys Arcand's film Jesus of Montreal. It discusses how the film consists of an overlaying of three narratives: 1) the story of a group of actors attempting an interpretation of Jesus' life, 2) their interpretation through a passion play, and 3) the original Jesus narrative that viewers are familiar with. It analyzes how the film blurs boundaries between these narratives in a postmodern way. It also compares Arcand's postmodern approach to a modern interpretation like Fellini's. Finally, it explores the film's use of analogies between the lead actor and Jesus to reconstruct the original Jesus narrative in a new way.",
