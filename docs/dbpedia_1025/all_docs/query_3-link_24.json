        "text": "Third Friday of Lent\n\nWe are now at the halfway point in this Lenten cinema series. Jésus de Montréal is movie number four, and we have four more to go after this. While I have enjoyed each of the three previous films in different ways, this one is my favorite thus far. The story and execution are just so unusual and unique with a mixture of earthiness and mysticism wrapped up in a type of non-religious Christianity. If that even makes sense. That’s why this is The Avant-Garde Jesus Movie. Leave it to the French — or the Québécois in this case — to experiment with presenting such an ancient, well-known story in a completely unexpected way."
