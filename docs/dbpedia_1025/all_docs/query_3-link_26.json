        "text": "The French-Canadian film, ‘Jesus Of Montréal,’ which was released in 1989, is a political drama, written and directed by Denys Arcand. The film’s leads are, Lothaire Bluteau (Daniel), Catherine Wilkening (Mireille), Johanne-Marie Tremblay (Constance), Rémy Girard (Martin), Robert Lepage (René), Gilles Pelletier (Fr, Leclerc) and Yves Jacques (Richard Cardinal). The film is available on iTunes, and as well, the Sheridan College library had copies of the film on DVD, which is how the film was viewed for the purpose of this essay.\n\nThe film’s plot is centred around a group of avant-garde actors commissioned to recreate the biblical story of ‘The Passion’ to be performed at Saint Joseph’s Oratory, in Montreal, with the main character, Daniel, portraying Jesus. The story of Christ becomes paralleled in the day-to-activities of the actors’ lives. Daniel gradually takes on the embodiment of his character, Jesus, and the others, of his disciples. They are faced with opposition from the church for their radical new interpretation of the story, and must fight for the sanctity of their performance.\n\nIn the scene we examine here, Daniel (Jesus) accompanies Mireille to an audition for a beer commercial at which the actors are treated without respect. It is clear they are valued only for physical appearance and Mireille is directed to debase herself by stripping on stage. Daniel defends her honor by flipping tables and toppling equipment, thus reenacting Jesus cleansing the temple, since he considers the theater his temple.\n\n(1:05:30 – 1:09:55)\n\nSound design in this scene does some interesting things to impact the viewer and play off of the moral beliefs of the characters. Sound is used to convey the stressed atmosphere, and the anger of the characters. The scene opens with auditioning actors dancing and lip-syncing for the commercial. The over-the-top voice dubbing reflects selling out to commercialism, and how acting talent is not valued by the producers who just want to market beer, and the lip-syncing is insincere.\n\nIn contrast, the use of diegetic sound in the rest of the scene draws us into the actors’ harsh reality. The spoken dialogue seems to have been recorded directly, adding to the rawness of the moment. The lack of music or outside sound brings its own tension and produces a heartless clinical feeling, making the viewer as uncomfortable and violated as the actors. Sound effects, such as rustling papers, creaking chairs and pattering of footsteps, are a key part of this scene reinforcing the frustrating awkwardness of the circumstances, especially as Mireille is told to display more skin than would be appropriate. The silence, mixed with those sound effects, brings us all into the moment of dread she is feeling.\n\nDialogue perspective is used to create distance and conflict between Daniel and the producers. Daniel is Mireille’s friend, so his voice is closer but softer, making him sound concerned and trusting as he tries to convince her not to proceed with being objectified. The voice of the female producer seems to shoot loudly over Daniel’s shoulder reminding Mireille that she is only valued for her body and that the job is on the line if she does not undress, making the producer sound powerful and authoritative, leaving Mireille with a difficult decision.\n\nDaniel gets pushed over the edge by the producer’s remarks; a brief moment of silences drags out the suspense of what he is going to do next. And again dramatic sound effects are used as he explodes and angrily flips a table, smashes cameras and pulls out cables. The loud crashing noises and electrical parts short-circuiting add to the violence of the scene. Daniel even strikes the female producer across the face with one of the cords he pulls. The sharp whizzing of the cord through the air, and the sound when it contacts her face, makes the assault seem all the more painful.\n\nJesus himself reflects these actions as shown in the bible, the whole film depicts of the story of Jesus Christ’s story and his highs and lows. The scene chosen is perhaps one of the darker points in the story of The Passion, exhibiting one of the more emotional sides of Jesus’ character. The use of silence as a contrast to the sounds effects makes it a highly impactful point in the film, wrenching the audience into the same state of shock the producers experience and into the intense anger felt by Daniel. By using simple sound design techniques, an unforgettable moment in the film is created."
