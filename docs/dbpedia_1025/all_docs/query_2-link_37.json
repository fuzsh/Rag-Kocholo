        "text": "Movies set in Montreal allow us to wander the city’s streets and experience amazing storytelling at the same time. There’s a robust following behind film here, as evidenced by locals who flock to movie theatres in Montreal, and that local love only grows when you’re watching stories set here. You may have seen Montreal as a backdrop in a lot of American productions—masquerading as Manhattan or some miscellaneous European city—but this town has also inspired local and international filmmakers as a setting in its own right. If you can’t go out to see one of these on the big screen, then order up some of the best delivery and takeout in Montreal, kick back, and enjoy the show at home.\n\nRECOMMENDED: Full guide to the best things to do in Montreal"
