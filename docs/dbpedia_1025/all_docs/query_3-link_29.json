        "text": "Jesus hangs on the cross, nails driven through his feet and hands, his side pierced, his body limp and stained with blood.\n\nBut that's as far as Christ gets in this Passion play. Sgt. Det. Bastien of the Montreal police arrives before the Resurrection. He's here to arrest the crucified actor for taking his role too seriously in real life. Destroying a den of iniquity may have been acceptable in biblical times, but smashing a video camera and chasing the art directors out the door during an audition for a beer commercial is criminal today.\n\nBastien's assistant slaps on the handcuffs. But he has a compliment for Christ before he carts him away. ''I liked your play,'' he says. ''It sure makes you think.'' Denys Arcand wanted to make people think with ''Jesus of Montreal,'' a much-honored film about a group of underemployed French-Canadian actors whose lives are changed by the Passion play they produce and perform in. (The film opens Friday in New York, at the Paris Theater.) The food for thought in ''Jesus'' is a pure product of the spirit of the age, says Mr. Arcand, a tall, debonair French Canadian with a generous smile, a bushy mustache and an immaculate command of English. In the dying years of a decade that celebrated material indulgence, the 48-year-old director detected ''this yearning for something else, a search for a sort of meaning. It can't be possible that life is just getting a BMW and a nice flat. There's got to be more to it than just that.''\n\nThe actors in the Passion play discover what is lacking in their own lives and careers (up to now punctuated with appearances in tacky commercials) by identifying intensely with the story of Christ and finding new relevance in His teachings. Life's not hard when you ''stop thinking about yourself,'' says the Jesus of this play, taking a thinly veiled swipe at the values of the me generation.\n\nNot that Mr. Arcand is advocating a return to religion to solve the problems of a society he sees wallowing in consumerism. Yes, he was once a devout altar boy who served Mass daily and dreamed of becoming a saint or the Pope. He was also educated by the Jesuits here in Montreal. But this is no born-again Christian, simply a happy agnostic who has read his Socrates and Buddha and still finds that of all the wise men in history, ''Jesus is the one talking to me in the most urgent manner, and his voice is irreplaceable.''\n\n''You're chosen by your subject as much as you choose it,'' says Mr. Arcand, who has made some two dozen documentaries and feature films since he began working in cinema in 1964.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
