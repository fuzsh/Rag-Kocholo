        "text": "Having interrupted my survey of Ozu films after demurring that “Tokyo Story” is not even the best postwar Ozu film, let alone the greatest film ever, with my ten-best list, I decided also to resurrect and update my list of best non-American movies by country (and a long list of my favorite films).\n\nNo one has seen everything, and although I estimate that I have seen between eight and nine thousand movies, I don’t doubt that I could reel off a list of at least a thousand that I’d really like to see. Being directed at what one has missed is a benefit of the “best of” list-making exercise—as long as the corrections are politely delivered, anyway. And the exercise reminded me of large (terrestrial) parts of the globe from which I’ve not seen any movies, even if I have entries here for 82 (and have seen a few from the US as well).\n\n(Like most human categories, the boundaries of what is an “American movie” are fuzzy. Does it include major studio productions shot in Canada? Is “The Last Emperor,” shot in China by an Italian director an “American movie”? If not, should it be considered a “Chinese movie”? Etc.\n\nMy list:\n\nAlgerian: Italian director Gillo Montecorvo’s agonizing “Battle of Algiers” (1966) in its Criterion special edition may be the best docudrama ever made. Rachid Bouchareb’s (2006) epic “Indigènes” (ironically titled “Days of Glory” in English) about Algerian soldiers fighting for the unappreciative French in World War II is also notable, and also something of a docudrama. Its sequel with four of the five leading men returning (in different roles) “Hors la loi” (Outside the Law, 2010) is mostly set in France during the bloody struggle over Algerian independence.\n\nArgentine: Best: “The Official Story” (1985, directed by Luis Puenzo).\n\nA favorite: “The Motorcycle Diaries” (directed by Brazilian Walter Salles, 2004, and arguably a Chilean movie) beat out “Happy Together” (in Cantonese, directed by Wong Kar-Wai). My favorite, however, is the delirious romance of doomed bank robbers, El Nene (Leonardo Sbaraglia), and Angel (Eduardo Noriega) in “Plata Quemada” (Burnt Money, 2000) cowritten and directed by directed by Marcelo Piñeyro. As I already said “an ____ian movie” is often not obvious for sorting. The next two entries further illustrate this. (I haven’t seen Alejandro Doria’s “Esperando la carroza” (1985). I thought the 2009 Oscar-winning “El secreto de sus ojos” was quite good, along with the unassuming 2002 “Historias mínimas”.)\n\nArmenian: “The Color of Pomegranates,” Sergei Paradjanov (1968) non-narrative movie about how Armenia (and Georgia?) may have looked to the 18th-century Armenian (Christian) poet/troubadour Haroutiun Sayakian, known as Sayat Nova (“the king of songs.” It is visually extraordinary (like Paradjanov’s celebration of Ukrainian pre-Soviet society in “Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors”) and very frustrating to anyone who wants a plot or character development or explanations of exotic customs. (This is probably the most alien—in the sense of opaque to me—film on my list, and I was tempted to substitue one of Armenian-Canadian director Atom Egoyan’s films, either “Ararat” or Calendar.)\n\nAustralian (English-language): If Baz Lurhman’s “Moulin Rouge” doesn’t count, then his earlier “Strictly Ballroom” (for best and favorite).\n\nAzberjani: Sergei Paradjanov (1988) Ashugi Qaribi (Ashik Kerib, also known as “The Lovelorn Minstrel”) portrays another troubador (as in Paradjanov’s Armenian-language “The Color of Pomegranates.” It has more plot than “Color,” but plot was not a major concern of Sergei Paradjanov in any language.\n\nBelgian (French-language): The only movie I’ve seen that I’m aware of being Belgian is “Ma vie en rose” (1997, directed by Alain Berliner), which was mildly amusing. The Oscar for the Serbian/Bosnian war black comedy “No Man’s Land” (1987) was credited to Belgium. If that counts, it can be the best and my favorite. I certainly wouldn’t want to choose whether it is Serbian or Bosnian!\n\nBengali: Satrayjit Ray’s (1954-59) Apu trilogy (Pather Panchali, Aparajito, The World of Apu), followed by other Ray movie. On my universal ten-best list, so all I’ll say again is “Wow!”.\n\nBhutanese: In Tibetan, Australian in financing, and less than explicit in where it is set (I think Nepal), still “Phörpa” (“The Cup”, 1999, written and directed by Khyentse Norbu) is a delight to include with its passionate soccer fans among the young monks as at a Tibetan Buddhist monastery (somewhere in the diaspora). The director was born in Bhutan, and also went on to make the very interesting Travelers and Magicians (2003).\n\nBrazilian: The most memorable is “Black Orpheus” (and my memory has had to last a long time), directed by Marcel Camus. “Central Station” (Central do Brasil, 1998, directed by Walter Salles, who also directed “The Motorcycle Diaries”, which was shot in multiple countries) eclipsed “Doña Flor and Her Two Husbands” as my favorite. As the cranky old lady who earns her living writing letters for illiterates in the main train station of Rio, Fernanda Montenegro was unforgettable, as was the 9-year-old Josue (Vinicius de Oliveira). I was very impressed by “Cidade de Deus” (City of God, directed by Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund, 2002), but it is way too chilling to be enjoyable (the tv series “Cidade dos Homens” (City of Men, 2002-05) is less grim).\n\nBritish/English: I’m not entirely sure that David Lean’s epic “Lawrence of Arabia” counts as “English.” The alternate “best” (shot in Vienna by Carol Reed) is “The Third Man,” and that or The Importance of Being Earnest (more for its source material perfectly delivered than for any cinematic merit) or “My Beautiful Laundrette” as my favorite (and sigh that Omar Wannecke did not go on to have much of a career, unlike Daniel Day-Lewis who threw his away) is my favorite.\n\nBurkina Faso: “La Nuit de la vérité (The Night of Truth, 2004), directed by Fanta Rêgina Nacro is at once horrifying and hope-providing, a tale of attempting to get beyond a civil war filled with atrocities.\n\nCanadian: I don’t understand the accolades for the tedious movies of Denys Arcand’s “Barbarian Invasions” and earlier “Decline of the American Empire,” both nominated for best foreign-language film Oscars. His 1989 “Jésus de Montréal” (Jesus of Montreal), however is very impressive. My favorite is also about an extremely committed artist: Francois Girard’s 1993 “Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould.” The best is probably Atom Egoyan’s heartbreaking 1997 “The Sweet Hereafter” with an awe-inspiring central performance by Ian Holm, but what a downer that is!\n\nChad: Mahamat-Saleh Haroun’s (2006) “Abouna” (Our Father) is a poignant tale of lost boys (their father has abandoned them; they are not as literally “lost” as the former child soldiers of the Sudan) in the tradition of “Aparajito” and “400 Blows,” coming from a country with no movie theaters.\n\nChilean: I sees 2005 “Machuca” is a poor relation to “Y tu máman, tambien”) insofar as it focuses on a friendship across class lines, but that is overwhelmed by examination of the American-sponsored 1973 coup.\n\nChinese (Cantonese): My favorite is “Painted Faces” (Qi qiao fu, directed by Alex Law, 1988), followed by Jackie Chan grown up (sort of) in “Project A, Part II” (‘A’ gai waak juk jaap. 1987, directed by Chan). My favorite fight scene is the lion dancers near the start of “Drunken Master” (Jui kuen,1978, directed by Yuen Wooping). Among the best are John Woo’s “The Killer” (Die xue shuang xiong,1989) and Wong Kar-Wai’s “Chunking Express.” And I’m a big fan of Johnie To movies, such as “Running Out of Time.”\n\nChinese (Mandarin): My current favorite is “The House of Flying Daggers”, directed by Zhang Yimou. Either his earlier (1991) cross-Chinese-history tragedy “Raise the Red Lantern” or Chen Kaige’s (1993) “Farewell, My Concubine” may be the best, though for cinematography nothing I know in any language surpasses “The House of Flying Daggers.” A heartbreaking movie, the last part of which is guaranteed to make me cry is Chen Kaige’s “Life on a String” (1991).\n\nColombian (Spanish-language): “La Virgen de los sicarios” Our Lady of the Assassins (2000) is a haunting movie about gangster-overwhelmed Medellin and a very offbeat romance between a “civilized” man and desolate angels. It was directed by Barbet Schroeder, who was born in Teheran and has directed movies in English (Reversal of Fortune) and French (Maitresse), and the documentary “Idi Amin Dada.” For a Colombian-directed movie, partly in indigeouns languages, the visually ravishing “The Wind Journeys” (2009), written and directed by Ciro Guerra is great cinema, if less-than-great as a movie. His Oscar-nominated 2015)“El abrazo de la serpiente” (Embrace of the Serpent) has an amazing indigenous Amazonian performance by Niblio Torres.\n\nCongo-Kinasha (Democratic Republic of the Congo): Djo Tunda wa Munga’s 2010 gangster/picaro “Viva Riva!” is quite lively.\n\nCroatian: “Ovce od gipsa” (“Witnesses “in English, 2003), written and directed by Vinko Bresnan, a chilling examination of complicity with ethnic cleansing.\n\nCuban (Spanish-language): “Lucía” (1969, directed by Humberto Solís) is the sort of historical swath across history Zhang Yimou used to make before he went wuxia (and CGI). I was very impressed when I saw it, but have not heard of it being shown or available in recent years. “Memories of an Underdevelopment” (Memorias del subdesarrollo, 1968, directed by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea) is also very good. Color me tepid about “Strawberries and Chocolate( Fresa y chocolate (1994, also (co-)directed by Gutiêrrez Alea, but admiring of Julian Schnabel’s adaptation of Arenas’s Before Night Falls.\n\nCzech: I love “Larks on a String” (Skrivánci na niti (made in 1968, withheld from release until 1990, directed by Jirí Menzel, more famous for having directed “Closely Watched Trains”, which is certainly a very good film. (And based on a novel by Bohumil Hrabal, author of the wonderful I Served the King of England. (Forget Milos Forman!)\n\nDanish: The one world-class Danish director is Carl-Theodore Dreyer. I’d really like to choose his “The Passion of Joan of Arc” in this category. It’s silent, but surely it’s a “French film.” Not only is Day of Wrath (Vredens dag, 1943) not my favorite Danish film, I don’t even like it. It is the first movie that I rated 5-stars and checked “do not recommend to friends.” It is a great movie but repellent in latter-day complicity with witch-torture and execution (in contrast, there is no sense from “The Passion of Joan of Arc” that Dreyer thought she got what she deserved). Dreyer also directed the incredibly irritating but undeniably great “Gertrud” (1964). (I’ve steered clear of “Ordet.” Maybe some time when I’m feeling very masochistic…) For favorite Danish movie, the conventional choice is a welcome relief from Dreyer: Babette’s Feat (Babettes gästebud, 1987, directed by Gabriel Axel from a novella by the Danish baroness who wrote as Isaak Dinesen), not having seen “Festen” (1998, written and directed by Thomas Vinterberg) or “Bab el shams” (2004, directed by Yousry Nasrallah) or “Pelle the Conqueror” (1988, directed by Bille August). I’m not a Dogme fan, though I thought that Icelandic pop singer Björk was amazing in “Dancing in the Dark” (2000, directed by Lars von Trier).\n\nDocumentary: Tokyo Olympiad has a lot of drama as put together by the master director Kon Ichikawa (Fire on the Plains, Harp of Burma, Enjo, etc.)\n\nDjbouti (in French): “Beau travail,” Claire Denis’s 1999 updating Billy Budd and moving it to the French Foreign Legion outpost on the horn of Africa with striking visuals and superb performances by Michel Subor and Grégoire Colin.\n\nDutch: “Karakter” (1997, directed by Mike van Diem). How did an Oscar-winner get on my list? Well, that’s practically the only way a Dutch movie [or Argentinian] movie gets shown in the US? And that shows that it could win in a category more competitive than my favorite Dutch movie! It really is excellent. But why hasn’t van Diem made another movie since its success?\n\nEquatorial Guinea: Editor/director “Where the Road Runs Out” (2014) directed by South African Rudolph Buitendoch, starring Ivory Coast-native Isaach De Bankolé shows a verdant countryside. De Bankolé’s character George leaves his life as an esteemed scientist based on Rotterdam for the country he left long ago, one in which his father had a large cacao plantation during Spanish colonial rule. The cinematography of Kees van Ostrum (Gods and Generals, Return to Lonesome Dove) is lovely, and the music by French composer Laurent Eyquem is almost as winning as the orphan Jimmy (Sizo Motoko) is. (This is the only movie made in the small Central African country).\n\nFilipino: Outside counsel suggested “Manila by Night” (1980, directed by Ishmael Bernal) also known as “City After Dark.” It is unavailable in the US, alas. And Ricardo Ramos champions “The Blossoming of Maximo Oliveras” (Aureas Solito, 2005), which is more likeable and less melodramatic than the other half dozen Filipino films I’ve seen.\n\nFrench: Jean-Pierre Melville’s “Le Samourai” with Alain Delon as a cat-loving hit man is my favorite and I could argue is the best. (I also like Melville’s movie of Jean Cocteau’s Les enfants terribles a lot, and Melville’s Le Cercle Rouge also starring Delon, and, while I’m at it, Georges Franju’s movie of Cocteau’s Thomas, l’imposteur and Cocteau’s own “La belle et le bête” and “Orphée” The best is widely supposed to be Jean Renoir’s “La Règle du jeu” (which I always think should be plural). I prefer the Marcel Carné/Jacques Prévert “Les enfants du Paradis,” even though it is overlong. I’ll instead go with the intense “Un condamné à mort s’est échappé” (A Condemned Man Escapes, 1956, directed by Robert Bresson, whose “Pickpocket” is another minimalist masterpiece).\n\nGeorgian: “The Legend of the Suram Fortress”/Ambavi Suramis tsikhitsa (1984) directed by Sergei Paradjanov, whose “Ashik Kerib) was also partly in Georgian. “Legend” was the first movie Paradjanov was allowed to direct after 16 years that included more than four in Soviet prison. Like his other movies starting with “Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors,” it celebrates pre-Soviet, non-Russian cultures/societies.\n\nGerman: Fritz Lang’s “M” is one of the most influential movies in film history, and he produced a large body of striking films—silent, German, French, and American ones (see, and, better still, join my Lang writeoff). My favorite German film not in German (but with the wondrous Marianne Sagebrecht) is Bagdad Cafe, directed by Percy Adlon. Werner Herzog’s Fitzcaraldo is in German and I like it better than the more imposing (“greater”)”Aguirre: the Wrath of God.” (Both of which might be classified as “Peruvian films,” and then Herzog’s mostly ignored Cobra Verde with Klaus Kinski going crazy in another tropical locaiton can be Beininian…)\n\nGreek: “Zorba, The Greek” had a Greek director (Michael Cacoyannis, actually Cypriote by birth; he also directed “The Trojan Women” in English) and a great Greek actress (Irene Pappas, Elektra, also directed by Cacoyannis and in Greek) and was filmed on Crete with the Ethnic for All Seasons Anthony Quinn in the lead role. If that doesn’t count as a “Greek movie,” my second choice “Phaedra” (directed by blacklisted American expatriate Jules Dassin, starring his wife, later Greek Minister of Culture, Melina Mercouri in the title role and Anthony Perkins as a modern-day Hippolytus. It’s also English-language, but the category is “best foreign films” not “best foreign-language films”, no? (And would someone release the last Dassin/Mercouri movie, “A Dream of Passion” on DVD, please?)\n\nGuinea-Bissau: Written and directed by Mohamed Camara (1959-), “Dakan” (Destiny, 2009) is quite beautifully shot a male-male romance (against cultural odds).\n\nHindi: Considering that “Bollywood” produces many movies, I’ve seen remarkably few movies in Hindi (fewer than in Bengali). I love R. K. Naryan’s novel The Guide, a comedy that turns to a wheeler-dealer being taken for a saint and taking on the role with lethal seriousness. The Hindi version runs nearly three hours and includes many plot-relevant songs that are not subtitled on the DVD I saw, but the story is still discernable. This 1965 movie, adapted and directed by Vijay Anand. was important historically in the diversification of the Indian film industry. It has outstanding performances by Dev Anand and Waheeda Rehman. (I enjoy Mango Soufflé (2002), written and directed by Mahesh Dattani, though it is in some ways quite inept, but my favorite is the slapstick comedy “Three Idiots” (2009) directed and cowritten by Abhijat Joshi.)\n\nHungarian: The great Hungarian director is Istvan Szabo. I haven’t seen “Mephisto,” which won a best foreign-language movie Oscar. I think that “Colonel Redl” (which also has a powerhouse performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer) is the best of those I’ve seen, but “Sunshine” is more Hungarian in setting and characters than those two. (My real favorite is Kristen Bjorn’s “Comrade in Arms.”)\n\nIcelandic: The slacker comedy “101 Reykjavìk” (2000, directed by Baltasar Kormákur. (I actually have seen other Icelandic movies, and been to Iceland). It is enhanced by having Almodóvar’s recurrent star Victoria Abril in it.\n\nIndonesian: “Langitku rumahku’ (My Sky, My Country, 1990) directed by Slamet Rahardjo is a touching film about two boys, one (Gempol) very poor, the other (Andri) quite rich but neglected who become friends and take to the road (prefiguring the older boys of different, but not as extremely different classes in “Y Tu Mamá, También”).\n\nInuit: I admit not to understand the most famed Inuit movie, “Atanarjuat: Fast Runner.” (dialogue entirely in Inuktitut). I was very impressed by the present-day story of some young Iñupiaq in Barrow, Alaska, the most northernmost US town, in “On the Ice” (2011) written and directed by Barrow-native Andrew Okpeaha MacLean (with more dialogue in English than in Iñupiaq, I’ll acknowledge).\n\nIrish: “In the Name of the Father” (1993, directed by Jim Sheridan) for best, “The Crying Game” (1992, directed by Neil Jordan) for favorite, Both are riveting tales focusing on IRA terrorist. I also love Jordan’s “Mona Lisa,” though I don’t know if it qualifies as “Irish,” even being directed by Jordan. And the boarding school dramedy “Handsome Devil” (2016).\n\nIran (Farsi): I think that “A Separation” (2011), written and directed by Asghar Farhadi, the first movie from Iran to win a best foreign-language film Oscar, is a very interesting, if not especially cinematic, movie. He has written and directed other noteworthy films, including “About Elly” (2009) and “The Salesman” (2016), which also won a best foreign-language film Oscar. Abbas Kiarostami has been revered by many, especially for the 1997 “A Taste of Cherry.” But my favorite director from Iran is Baham Ghobadi, and of his films, “Turtles Can Fly” (2004), “A Time for Drunken Horses” (2000), “Marooned in Iraq” (2002), and “Half Moon” (2006), and “No One Knows About Persian Cats” (2009). The first two I mentioned are in Kurdish, “Half Moon” has more Farsi.\n\nIsraeli (Hebrew): “Yossi and Jagger” (2002) is a very moving romance between two soldiers in an isolated border installation. it was directed by Eytan Fox, whose 2004 “Walk On Water” is also excellent (and confronts the same issues as Steven Spielberg’s “Munich” did a year later). Also his “The Bubble” (Ha-buan, 2006). All three confront the difficulty of ending cycles of violence.\n\nItalian: I’ll go with Luchino Visconti’s “Rocco and His Brothers” as the best as well as being my favorite. If anyone has failed to notice that I am forever smitten by the young Alain Delon, I might add Michelangelo Antonioni’s “L’eclisse” (Eclipse). For me, none of Robert Rosellini’s or Federico Fellini’s movies are as good as the sum of their parts with the exception of Rosellini’s “Il Generale della Rovere” with a transcendent performance by Vittorio de Sica.” I can’t not mention Pier Paolo Pasolini’s “Medea” mostly for containing the one movie performance by the diva of divas, Maria Callas. And Pasolini’s “Passion According to Saint Matthew” with his mother as the Virgin Mary… and “Teorema” with Terrence Stamp as the angel of Eros..\n\nIvory Coast: “Bal Poussière” (Dancing in the Dust, 1988, written and directed by Henri Duparc) is a black comedy about five wives revolting when their husband, Demi-Dieu (Demigod) attempts to add a sixth. (Also see the Senegalese Xala.)\n\nJamaican: It’s not a great movie, though having raw vitality, but the soundtrack of “The Harder They Come” (1972, directed by Perry Henzell) and the charisma of Jimmy Cliff made it a favorite of mine, though it has been radically maimed turn it into an anti-drug movie. (“Countryman” (1982, directed by Dickie Jobson) has a good soundtrack and the pure-of-heart Rastafarian. (I love “Cool Running” with the Jamaican Olympic bobsled team coached by John Candy, but don’t consider it a Jamaican film.)\n\nJapanese: I think that Kurosawa Akira directed more great movies than anyone else anywhere. Many of them (including its immediate predecessor, Kagemusha (The Shadow Warrior) and the earlier adaptation of Shakespeare, “Throne of Blood,” seem to lead up to “Ran” (Chaos), Kurosawa’s second masterpiece about old age (“Ikuru” was the first). “Ran” is a reflection on Shakespeare’s own final masterpiece, “King Lear,” with one of many great performances by Nakadai Tasuke. My favorite Japanese movie is the wry samurai black comedies from the mid-1960s starring Toshiro Mifune: “Yojimbo” and “Sanjuro.” (And, if Kurosawa is the Mount Everest of film directors, he rises from a Himalayan range that includes Ozu, Mizoguchi, Kinoshita, Ichikawa, Kobayashi, Imamura, and Shinoda (in chronological order of their emergence).)\n\nKazakhstan: “Mongol,” directed by Russian director Sergei Bodrov about the early travails of Temüjin, who later came to be known as Genghis Khan was nominated for a 2007 best-foreign-language-film Oscar. (I don’t know what has happened to its sequel!) I preferred it to the Japanese-Mongoloian film also released in 2007, “Genghis Khan: To the Ends of the Earth and Sea, directed by Shinichira Sawai, in which Takashi Sorimachi played Temüjin, but enjoyed the Central Asian location shooting in both.\n\nKenya (entirely in Maa): Though having too many extended shots of young would-be warriors walking across the savannah in pursuit of a possibly mystic lion, Les Guerriers de la Pluie” (Massai: Rain Warriors, 2004, directed by Pascal Plisson).\n\nKirghizi: Adopted Son/Beshkempir The first post-Soviet feature film produced in Kyrgyzstan film, although much of it is opaque to me, was quite a good one about coming of age with ethnographic scenes of matriachs’ ritual for warding off the Evil Away from a male infant, mud brick-making, leeching, and mourning rituals. And director Aktan Abdykalykov’s son Mirlan was excellent in the title role of a 13-year-old who discovers he had been adopted.\n\nKorean: I liked the beautiful “Bom yeoreum gaeul gyeoul geurigo bom” Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter… and Spring,” 2003, directed by Kim Ki-Duk). But “Tae Guk Gi” (Brotherhood of War, 2004) blew me away. At the very least, it is the best movie set against the Korean War. And there is the very funny black comedy “The Silent Family” (1998, Joyonghan Gajok) directed by Song Kong-Ho.\n\nKurdish: The tragedy of an Iranian Kurdish youth trying to get from Le Havre to London in “Welcome” (written and directed by Philippe Lioret, 2009) is a French movie. Which of Bahman Ghobadi’s movies is the best? I think “Turtles Can Fly” (2004), though I think I like “Niwameng” (Half Moon, 2006) better. The very difficult-to-cross borders within Kurdistan are central to both and frustration and tragedy run through his more Iranian 2000 “A Time for Drunken Horses,” and 2004 “Marooned in Iraq”).\n\nLebanon (Canadian-made): “Incendies” (2010, directed by Denis Villeneuve) has multiple griefs from the ethnic cleansings/civil war of Lebanon during the 1970s revealed to a pair of twins by the tasks they are set in the last will of their mother (Lubna Azabal). I was disoriented between the 1970 and present on occasion, but I guess so were the twins on a very painful quest.\n\nLiberia (mostly in English)” Out of My Hand” (2015) was shot partly in the Margibi region of Liberia, partly in New York City, receiving some funding from the Liberian government and starring Liberia-born Bishop Blay as a rubber tapper who may have committed multiple atrocities in the civil war there. After a failed strike, he goes to New York and becomes a cab driver, though the Liberian civil war follows him there.\n\nLithuanian: The only Lithuanian film I’ve seen, “You Can’t Escape Lithuania” (2016) is a frustrating, underdeveloped mix of road movie, crime movie, romance triangle, and thriller made by a young film-maker, Romas Zabarauskas, who cast Denisas Kolomyckis as a gay filmmaker of dubious talent named , Romas Zabarauskas.\n\nMacedonian: Milcho Manchevski’s “Before the Rain” (Pred dozhdot, 1995) is strangely constructed in three parts that cannot quite be set in a chronological order. It shows the emergence of ancient hatreds tamped down by Yugoslav communism. (The middle panel of the triptych is set in London, the other two were filmed on location in Macedonia.) It has a great central performance by Rade Serbedzija (Batman Begins).\n\nMali: “Yeelen” (Brightness, 1987) written and directed by Malian Souleymane Cissé was much lauded and won a special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1988. I find it pretty tedious with an enraged father calling down the wrath of a god over and over and over as he pursues his purer-of-heart son, the handsome Nianankoro (Issiaka Kane).\n\nMauritania (mostly in Hassaniya; one major character does not speak it though it is his mother-tongue and he is staying with his mother) “Heremakono” (Waiting for Happiness, 2002) written and directed by Abderrahmane Sissako, looks very striking. Things happend in the movie, but why they happen or what formed the characters is left to the viewer to infer (or make up). It won the International Critics Award at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, and to me has visual affinities with Antonioni movies (but not the alienation of characters in them).\n\nMexican: It would be hard to argue against Luis Buñuel’s “Los Olivados” being the best. No one would argue that my favorite, “Doña Herlinda y sus hijos” is the best, but it is a charming fairy tale, far removed from the bleakness of “Los Olivados” and “Amores perros. (The ending of “Y tu mamá, tambien” ruined that for me).\n\nMongolian: “Urga” (Close to Eden, 1991, directed by Nikita Mikhalkov) shows a family of nomads, who have some modern technology. which focuses on another nomadic family with some modern artifacts. (Less sentimental than “The Story of the Weeping Camel” and “The Cave of the Yellow Dog,” both quasi-documentaries, directed by Byambasuren Dava, both of which I liked.) I’d like to see “Nohoi oro”n (State of Dogs, 1998), a reputedly strikingly photogaphed movie about the spirit of a dog seeking to find its owner.It was codirected by Peter Brosens who also codirected the bizarre (at least in its final third) Khadak (2007). Although it begs the question of how Chinggis Khan became paramount leader, I was swept up in the 2007 historical epic “Mongol” (directed and cowritten by Sergei Bodrovhttp).\n\nMoroccan: I like Benoït Graffin’s “Café de plage” (Beach Café, 2001 from a novella by Mohammed Mrabet, which is set in Morocco, but give the nod to Ismaël Ferroukhi’s 2004 haj/road movie “Le grand voyage.” (The last part is shot in Mecca, so perhaps I should list it under “Arabian.”)\n\nNepalese: Eric Valli’s (1999) “Himalaya – l’enfance d’un chef” is mesmerizing. The story is Tibetan, as are the performers and some of the crew, though the director and those credited for the extraordinary images (Eric Guichard and Jean-Paul Meurisse) are French. The Bhutanese director, Khyentse Norbu filmed his genial account of a conflict between monastery tradition and televised soccer mansions “The Cup” (1999) in Nepal.\n\nNew Zealand (Maori): “Whale Rider (2002), a very popular choice, adapted and directed by Nicki Caro (over “When We Were Warriors”) for best and favorite.\n\nNigerian: NIgeria produces more movies than any country other than the US and India, most direct-to-video, most atrocious.” The best one I’ve seen and the one I like most is “Confusion Na Wa,” (2013) written and directed by Kenneth Gyang, shot in Kaduna (in the Muslim Northwest of Nigeria). There’s a lot going on in the movie, much of it connected to a cellphone picked up in the confusion at the start after someone was killed in the street.\n\nNorwegian: Max von Sydow delivers the performance of a lifetime (and he has had a formidable movie career) in the title role of “Hamsum” (1996), directed by Jan Troell. The movie about the Norwegian winner of the Nobel Prize for literature portrays a marriage of Strindbergian in its savagery (though the wife, Marie, played by Ghita Nørby, is more sympathetic than in Strindberg plays) and aLear-like old man who had long been anti-British, supported Hitler and the occupation of Norway, annoyed Hitler greatly when they met, and was protected in the same wa Ezra Pound was after the war. (Troell and van Sydow are Swedish, Nørby Danish, but the movie was filmed in Norway and is about a Norwegian writer concerned about Norway’s place in the Third Reich.) I like another Norewgian film about writers, Joachim Trier’s “Reprise,” and was somewhat underwhelmed by the WWII sabotage/resistance thriller “Max Manus.”\n\nPalestinian (in Arabic): “Paradise Now,” an absudist (dark) comedy on the difficulties of becoming a martyr and the frighteningly unreflective ease with which two young underemployed Palestinian friends undertake blowing themselves and as many Israeli soldiers as they can.\n\nPeruvian: Though inferior to the source novel by Mario Vargas Lllosa, Francisco J. Lombardi’s “Pantale y las visitadoras (Captain Pantoja and the Special Services, 2000) is still a very funny satire on military rationality. Lombardi also directed the searing examination of class and sexuality, “No se lo Digas a Nadie” (Don’t Tell Anyone, 1998), some of which I remember vividly. I was disappointed by “Máncora” (2011) despite fine acting in it.\n\nPolish: I consider “Rouge” French, the Decalogue too uneven, visually static, and anthologyy for consideration which leaves me with Andrzej Wajda’s (1957) “Kanal” or his “Man of Iron” or Roman Polanski’s “The Pianist,” which is in English. So “Kanal.”\n\nPortuguese (the country, for the language, see Brazilian above): I was enraptured by the sweeping historical movie “Mysteries of Lisbon” (Mistérios de Lisboa, 2010) directed Manoel de Oliveira (1908-2015).\n\nRomani (aka “gypsy”): Tony Gatlif’s (1997) Gadjo dilo/Crazy Stranger goes from showing suspicions about the stranger played by Romain Duris, to recording music, to showing the hatred of the Romani by other Romanians.\n\nRomanian? I can go with the praise for Cristian Mungiu’s abortion tragicomedy “4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days” (2007), whereas I thought Cristi Puiu’s “The Death of Mr. Larescu” was a bit overpraised, though certainly not lacking bite. Corneliu Porumboiu’s (2009) “Police, Adjective” gives “4,3,2” a run for my nod. All three, and Mungiu’s (2016) “Graduation” are slow-paced for popcorn-movie audiences.\n\nRussian: Having opined that the bipartite Ivan the Terrible, directed by Sergei Eisenstein is the best film ever made, it has to be the best Russian film. Nevertheless, my favorite Eisenstein movie is the silent and fragmentary “Que viva Mexico.” I love the helmets and Prokofiev’s music for Eisenstein’s “Alexander Nevsky,” a somewhat superficial and jingoistic movie in comparison with the two (of an intended three) awe-inspiring “Ivans.” Though not part of the Tarkovsky cult, I think his early (1962) “Ivan’s Childhood” is quite special, and I also like Sokurov’s (2007) “Alexandra” with the great Galina Vishnevskaya.\n\nScottish: At least shot in Scotland, by the Archers (Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger), “I Know Where I am Going” is my choice, partly for the scenery, but mostly for Wendy Hiller (who thinks the title, but is mistaken). (Hitchcock’s “39 Steps” is ostensibly set in Scotland, but..) For more contemporary Scotland, Danny Boyle’s “Trainspotting,” of course, is much touted, though I don’t like it. My favorite is Bill Forsyth’s “Local Hero” (1983), though Forsyth’s 1981 “Gregory’s Girl” is preferred by many.\n\nSenegalese (Wolof- and French-language): “Ceddo” (1977, directed by Ousmane Sembene). With talk of the “clash of civilizations,” and the continued destruction of cultures not aligning with dar-al-Islam or Christendom (and the continuing contest between the Abrahamic religions in Africa), this movie, that I was fortunate to see in a retrospective of Sembene movies that he attended some years back, deserves to be far better known, as, indeed, do his other films. It is, unfortunately, not available even on VHS. His 2004 drama centered on female genital mutilation in a Bambara village, “Moolaadé” now is, as are “Mandabi,” “Xala,” and “Black Girl,” his first feature film. (I have seen a few Senegalese films not directed by Sembene in film festivals and the two feature films directed by Djibril Diop Mambéty on DVD; I was very impressed with his adaptation of Friedrich Dürrenmatt’s play “The Visit”, Hyenas, which is as good as the best Sembene movies.)\n\nSilent: Favorite: F. W. Murnau’s “Tabú” (1931) on which Robert Flaherty collaborated for a while in various parts of Polynesia. A not entirely predictable locale for the culmination of German Expressionism, but one should remember how much European expressionism was influence by primitivism. Should I add his “Nosferatu” as “best”? (Keaton’s “The General” is IMO the best silent film, but does not belong in a list of “foreign” films! Whether Murnau’s 1927 “Sunrise” is foreign is also open to debate.)\n\nSlovak: For me there is no question that “The Shop on Main Street” (Obchod na korze, 1965, directed by Ján Kadár) is a great movie with an unforgettable performance by Ida Kaminskia as an elderly Jewish shopkeeper befuddled when the Nazis come.\n\nSouth Africa (in a slum patois drawing from Xhosa, Zulu, Afrikaans, and English): “Yesterday” (2004, written and directed by Darrell Roodt ), which was nominated for a best foreign-language Oscar was a worthy endeavor, but I was very more impressed by Presley Chweneyagae in the title role of “Tsotsi “(a term meaning “thug”) and a very fine ensemble cast. The movie, which won the foreign-language film Oscar, is as likely to make people want to go to Johannesburg as “Crash” (which I think is not as good a movie as “Tsotsi”) is to make people want to visit Los Angeles. I have seen the arc of the movie described as “redemption”; I don’t think it gets there, but I think that it goes beyond “distraction from thuggery” (Roger Ebert’s characterization) to some expiation (like “Our Lady of the Assassins”, shot in Medellin, Colombia, though the palette of “Tsotsi” is darker that Schroeder’s movie’s).\n\nSpanish: The movie from Spain by which I was most affected was “Cría [cuervos]” (1976), in which Carlos Saura directed his wife Geraldine Chaplin as a mother who is dying of cancer, though the focus is on her young daughter Mónica Randall, who keeps spinning a 45 rpm record “Porque te vas?” by Jeanette. My favorite, however, is Almodóvar’s “La ley del deseo” (Law of Desire, directed by Pedro Almodóvar, 1987), the last movie that Almodóvar made with Antonio Banderas the penultimate one with Carmen Maura (my other favorites are “Mujeres al borde de un ataque de nervios”[Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown] and “Mala Educación” [Bad Education]).\n\nSri Lanka (Tamil): “Dheepan” (2015) follows a Tamil Tiger after their defeat in the long-running civil war there and two refugees to France, where the pretend to be a family… and become one. The film won the Palme d’or at Cannes and has a significant amount of dialogue in French, though, I think, more in Tamil.\n\nSwedish: I was transfixed by Ingmar Bergman’s “Seventh Seal” at an impressionable age (18). It or “”Smiles on a Summer Night “ can be my favorite. For the best, I’ll go with Bergman’s “Wild Strawberries” (1958)—at least until I watch “Persona” again after many decades; it was certainly a film my generation of students loved to discuss. (The greatest non-Bergman Swedish film (IMO) is the adaptation of Strindberg’s Miss Julie,” directed in 1951 by Bergman’s mentor Alf Sjöberg.)\n\nSwitzerland (Swiss German) I like the eleven-year-old genius/piano prodigy pretending to be normal (Teo Gheorghiu) more than the arrogant six-year-old (Fabrizio Borsani) flaunting his superiority. Best of all is Bruno Ganz as Vitus’s grandfather.\n\nTaiwanese (in mixed Taiwanese [Hokkien] and Bejinghua [Mandarin]): Best and favorite are the same: Edward Yang’s “Yi Yi” (2000) with another winsome child, Jonathan Chang, as an obsessive 8-year-old photographer of everything around. The movies of Hou and Tsai I find confusing and alienating, though there are moments of comic absurdity in Tsai’s and Hou’s “City of Sadness” has historical importance. Another 2000 film from Taiwan, “Fleeing by Night” *Ya Ben”) is heartbreaking.\n\nThai: “Rak Toraman” (Tortured love, 1986), the sequel to Pisan Archaraseranee’s 1985 film “Playing Soot Tai” (The last song) is a great revenge flick (also see Kon Ichikawa’s “Actor’s Revenge” in Japanese.) Yes, I have seen other Thai movies, including four by Apichatpong Weerasethakul. And I found much to admire in Ekachai Uekrongtham’s “Beautiful Boxer,” particularly the lead performance by champion kickboxer Asanee Suwan and the cinematography of Choochart Nantitanyatada.\n\nTibetan: I have to go with Martin Scorcese’s luminous biopic of the 13th Dalai Lama, “Kundun.” It was shot in Morocco by an American director of more than a little note, but it is in Tibetan and about the persecution and preservation of Tibetan culture. As is not the case for Bhutan, I have seen some movies filmed in Tibet (plus this list includes movies form Bhutan and Nepal about Tibetans), including Joan Chen’s very interesting (1998) “Xiu Xiu.” I also highly recommend Tom Piozet’s (2002) documentaries “Tibet: Cry of the Snow Lion” and “Saltmen of Tibet, plus “Himalaya” l’enfance d’un chef” (1999), shot in Tibet by Eric Valli.\n\nTunisian: “Le fil”/”The String” (2010), directed and cowritten by Mehdi Ben Attia, stars the great Claudia Cardinale (who was born in Tunis and speaks Arabic among other languages, and plays a Frenchwoman who married an Arab) as the mother of a moody son Malik (Antonin Stahly-Vishwanadan) who has returned after many years in France and takes up with similarly repatriated but decidedly lower-class Arab Bilal (Salim Kéchiouche).\n\nTurkish: I’d like to see “Bir tat bir doku” (2001, directed by Omer Faruk Sorak), and the award-winning “Yol,” but how? German-born director Fatih Akim’s 2004 movie “Gegen die Wand” (Head-On) partly takes place in Istanbul and won many awards, but I don’t much like the movie, preferring Akim’s earlier road comedy “Im Juli” (In July, 2000) and later road tragedy “Auf der anderen Seite” (The Edge of Heaven, 2007). The latter has gorgeous shots of the Turkish Black Sea coast, but for gorgeous cinematpgraphy, my new favorite Turkish movie is “Mutluluk” (Bliss, 2007), directed by Abdullah Oguz from the acclaimed 2002 novel by Zülfü Livaneli (who is a sometimes film director but wrote the musical score rather than the screen adaptation). Özgü Namal (who was 31, playing a raped shepherdess whose age was raised from the book’s 15 to 17) delivers a great performance in it. Though there is much to admire in Bilge Ceylan’s “Once Upon a Time in Anatolia” (2011), I found it frustratingly gratuitously minimalist. I liked the 2015 Oscar-nominated (Franco-Turkish) “Mustang” about repression and five orphaned girls, directed by Ankara-born Deniz Gamze Ergüven.\n\nUkrainian: Sergei Paradjanov’s (1964) visually gorgeous, narratively frustrating “Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors.”\n\nUruguayan: the rather genial and scenic oldster train-hijacking movie El último train (The Last Train, 2002), cowritten and directed by Diego Arsuaga (categorizing “Quemada plata,” the last two-thirds of which is set in Uruguay as an Argentine movie).\n\nVenezuelan: I was underwhelmed by the only Venezuelan movie I’ve seen, Lorenzo Vigas’s 2015 ugly-looking story of a middle-aged man, Armando (Alfredo Castro) who pickes up “rough trade,” and betrays the response he eventually engenders from the skinny jack-roller, Élder (Luis Silva). I much prefer the Colombian “Our Lady of the Assassins.”) I’m surprised the film won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.\n\nVietnamese: I like the fairy-tale romance engineered by a plucky orphan in Stephane Gauger’s “Cú và chim se sáo” (The Owl and the Sparrow, 2007). Though somewhat confusing (in its time jumps and some opaque motivation), I think that “Mua len trau” (The Buffalo Boy, 2004) is the best Vietnamese movie (Le The Hu starred in both, and both were directed by men who were born in Vietnam and educated in California universities).\n\nVanuatu in Nauvhal: The Oscar-nominated “Tanna” (2016) shows young lovers defying their elders, more like Murnau’s “Tabu” than “Romeo and Juliet,” with even more flesh exposed. It won the cinematography award at the Venice Film Festival, I think, more for the photography of the active volcano on the island of Tanna, the jungle, and the beach, than for the exposed human flesh. Asked to do what their characters would do in vairous situations, the movie shows a Naturvölk in which the rivalry between small groups endangers to survival of either or of their culture.\n\n©2006, 2018, Stephen O.
