Hailed in the early 1990s as \"Godfather of the New Canadian Cinema\" and fêted at Cannes as one of the leading contemporary filmmakers, since 1993 Arcand has been able to complete only two films, one of them a small-scale project for TV. This fallow period echoes another around 1980 when, despite having made a string of hard-hitting documentaries and three exceptional feature films, he was considered washed up and found himself reduced to directing episodes of mini-series for CBC television.\n\nArcand would be the first to admit that these setbacks stem, to a large degree, from his own reluctance to compromise. Provocative and politically aware, he sees film as a means of challenging society and its comfortable assumptions, and can rarely bring himself to follow box-office fashion. \"You have to believe in the material,\" he told an interviewer in 1997. \"You wouldn't believe how many scripts with Martians are floating around out there. I could never look at Star Wars ; I'm sure it's well made, but I could never relate to the material.\" And even when he finds material he can relate to, Arcand is inclined to go his own way without regard to the consequences. A documentary he made for the National Film Board of Canada in 1970 so outraged the NFB that they suppressed it, only giving it a grudging release six years later.\n\nDocumentary took up the first decade of Arcand's directing career. Having graduated (with a degree in history), he joined the National Film Board to make a series of shorts on Canadian culture and history. \"They were small films,\" he deprecatingly remarked, \"and no one wanted to make them.\" Arcand used these half-dozen shorts to hone his technique and develop his ideas. At the same time he contrived to slip elements of his pessimistic humour and scepticism even into such anodyne subjects as Volleyball and Parcs atlantiques ( Atlantic Parks )—often making tellingly subversive points through astute use of editing.\n\nOpen confrontation erupted over Arcand's first feature-length film, On est au coton ( We're Fed Up ), an exposé of the wretched working conditions in Quebec's textile industry. It succeeded in antagonising both the extreme left (who thought the propaganda should have been more outspoken) and the employers. The NFB accused Arcand of lacking objectivity and the film, which became a cause celebre, was suppressed until 1976. \"The Film Board,\" observed Arcand, \"makes thousands of films to say that all goes well in Canada. . . . So I think it is just normal that there should now and then be a film which says that everything is rotten and that we live in a country that is corrupt from top to bottom.\" He made two more full-length documentaries for the NFB, both dealing with Québécois politics. \"Arcand's great theme is betrayal,\" commented John Harkness, \"and his documentaries deal with that theme most explicitly.\"\n\nMeanwhile Arcand had turned to feature films to pursue his disenchanted vision of Quebec society—and, by implication, of Western society in general. La maudite galette ( The Damned Dough ) was rather too obviously indebted to Godard, but with its two successors Arcand hit his stride. Réjeanne Padovani and Gina both make shrewd use of a thriller framework to explore political themes, and Gina adds in an element of sexual politics that anticipates his later work—as does its often teasing tone. Though consistently operating from a left-wing standpoint, Arcand mistrusts any form of dogmatism and enjoys upsetting audience expectations. \"A good film is always pulling the rug out from under people's beliefs and prejudices,\" he once remarked.\n\nThe films attracted international notice—the French critic Jean Rochereau compared Arcand to Juvenal and Voltaire—but were too unsettling to gain popular success. For several years Arcand found his career hampered by official suspicion and changes in the system of Canadian government funding. He bounced back, quite unexpectedly, with his first international hit, Le déclin de l'empire américain ( The Decline of the American Empire ), a sardonic comedy about sex. Not a sex comedy; the eroticism is all in the talk. While preparing a lakeside dinner, four male academics discuss sex; at the gym their female counterparts do likewise. Finally they all meet for dinner where the conversation, and the revelations, continue. With nods towards Rohmer and late Buñuel, the overall effect is at once funny and bleak: a witty, perceptive study of an alienated society in terminal decline. The film won the Critics' Prize at Cannes, and was nominated for an Oscar.\n\nArcand gained his second Oscar nomination for Jésus de Montréal , a fable of passionate irony about an actor cast as Christ in the city's annual Passion Play who finds the role is taking over his life. Envisaging the film as \"not a very commercial proposition\" and likely to offend the religious as well as the secular establishment, Arcand was amazed when it became his greatest box-office hit, gaining an award from the World Council of Churches. \"Woe unto you when all men praise you,\" he mused wryly."
