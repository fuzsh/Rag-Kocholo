        "text": "Yeah, I’m not sure what angle Scorsese will take with it considering he already did The Last Temptation of Christ.\n\nThere’s an interview with a young Scorsese where he said that part of the reason why he felt The Last Temptation didn’t work was because he tackled religious themes too overtly, as opposed to slipping them into the narratives of his other works. I do love Silence though — I think that’s one of Scorsese’s best films.\n\nIn any case, I’m game for a new Scorsese anything.\n\nI think Scorsese at this old age now is far more in line with a believer. I think he has far less doubts about God than his younger self did at that point, which makes sense and to be honest, this doesn't excite me at all. I'm far more interested in Paul Verhoeven's Jesus movie, which may or may not be made. Read up on that and you will understand my excitement, especially after his last masterpiece, Benedetta.\n\nI think Scorsese at this old age now is far more in line with a believer.

Read up on that and you will understand my excitement, especially after his last masterpiece, Benedetta.\n\nI see your point. I just don't see Scorsese playing the Jesus story so completely straight.\n\nPerhaps, he is writing a script for this concept that he's talked about for years?\n\n\"And immediately I thought of making a film of the Gospel, but set on the Lower East Side, in the tenements, in modern dress,” the director explained in a wide-ranging conversation with Commonweal. “And the crucifixion would be on the West Side docks, and in black-and-white. And then I saw Pasolini’s ‘Gospel,’ and I said, ‘No, there’s no way for me to do it.’ ”\n\n“Jesus said—when they complained about him, when they said, ‘Look, he’s hanging around with alcoholics, prostitutes, tax collectors,’ and they asked him why he would do that—he said, ‘Well, the ones who are good, they don’t need the doctor, basically.’ And so I always wondered: what about where I grew up, in the Bowery? What about the people who were dying in front of me, the alcoholics who were dying in the streets? What about the underworld? What about the people who wound up doing bad things, but they’re really genuinely good people? What if we do a film, and Jesus is here, on 8th Avenue?” Scorsese said, explaining his vision for the film.\n\nMartin Scorsese Talks His Unmade Jesus In New York Movie & More\n\nCould be interesting!\n\nI see your point. I just don't see Scorsese playing the Jesus story so completely straight.\n\nPerhaps, he is writing a script for this concept that he's talked about for years?\n\nMartin Scorsese Talks His Unmade Jesus In New York Movie & More\n\nCould be interesting!\n\nI also came upon a book about Jesus written in the 70s that was going to be a flick, but never got made. I've seen it pop up in recommendations elsewhere, but finally took a look. Story is about a man from the 70s who time travels to meet ''Jesus''...That premise alone got me hooked and ordered the book, but will let yall know when I eventually read it.\n\nDidn't they make a movie with Ewan McGregor as Jesus around exactly that, a few years ago?\n\nThere was also a Joaquin Phoenix Jesus movie done not that long ago. I havent seen it and nobody else did either. Ha."
