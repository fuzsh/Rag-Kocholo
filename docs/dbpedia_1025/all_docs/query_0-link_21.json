        "text": "MONTREAL, QUEBEC--(Marketwired - Nov 26, 2014) - Quebecor is proud to announce that Éléphant: The memory of Québec cinema will be part of the 18th Cinéma du Québec film series in Paris, a high-profile cultural event held at the Forum des images at the initiative of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC). The film Jésus de Montréal (1989) by Denys Arcand, fully digitized in HD and restored by Éléphant, will be screened on November 26 at 5:45 p.m. Jésus de Montréal, written and directed by one of Québec's most celebrated filmmakers, has earned many Canadian and international awards, including several Genie and Jutra awards, the Jury Prize and Ecumenical Jury Award at the Cannes Film Festival, the Best Film Not in the English Language Award at the BAFTA Awards, and an Oscar® nomination in the Best Foreign-Language Film category.\n\n\"Quebecor is pleased to help make Québec's cinematic heritage more accessible,\" said Pierre Dion, President and CEO of Quebecor. \"Year after year, the reputation of Éléphant: The memory of Québec cinema and its colossal endeavour is spreading, thereby bringing the work of our exceptionally talented Québec creative artists to audiences across the continents.\"\n\nAbout Éléphant: The memory of Québec cinema\n\nÉléphant: The memory of Québec cinema, launched by Quebecor on November 18, 2008, is a large-scale project dedicated to restoring and digitizing in HD Québec's heritage of feature films, and making it available as it is digitized. To date, more than 200 films have been restored and digitized.\n\nOnce they have been digitized in HD and restored, the movies can be accessed 24/7 via video on demand on Videotron's illico platforms: illico TV, illico mobile and illico.tv. The films are also being gradually added, in the original version with subtitles, to iTunes in Canada, the U.S., France and all other European and African countries where French or English is one of the official languages. To date, the Québec films in the Éléphant catalogue have been downloaded more than 250,000 times on Videotron's platforms.\n\nThe Éléphant website at www.elephant.canoe.ca contains the largest existing database and bank of information on Québec cinema. Also produced under the aegis of Éléphant, the book Les images que nous sommes, 60 ans de cinéma québécois by anthropologist Serge Bouchard (Éditions de l'Homme) provides an original and incisive history of 60 years of Québec cinema. It is available in bookstores and in digital format. The digital version, available on iTunes, includes 73 movie excerpts.\n\nOn October 10, 2014, Éléphant: The memory of Québec cinema launched Éléphant ClassiQ, the first edition of a film festival devoted to restored and digitized movies from the world's cinematic heritage. Éléphant ClassiQ is the first festival of its type in Québec and Canada.\n\nÉléphant: The memory of Québec cinema is a philanthropic project that is fully funded by Quebecor and from which it derives no financial benefit. Aside from a small amount to cover a portion of the platform's operating costs, all revenues from distribution of the movies on illico goes to the rights holders and filmmakers.\n\nAbout Quebecor\n\nQuebecor, a Canadian leader in telecommunications, news media, entertainment and culture, is one of the best-performing integrated communications companies in the industry. Driven by their determination to deliver the best possible customer experience, all of Quebecor's subsidiaries and brands are differentiated by their high-quality, multiplatform, convergent products and services.\n\nQuebecor (TSX:QBR.A)(TSX:QBR.B) is headquartered in Québec.
