        "text": "Movie Review of Jesus of Montreal\n\nThe film Jesus of Montreal is interesting story of a group of actors that are cast to perform an updated version of Jesus' life. The way that the cast comes together and the environment in which they perform have a strikingly similar resemblance to Jesus' life here on earth as reporter in the New Testament. This is especially true of the main character, Daniel Columbe, who seeks to alleviate all actors in Montreal from being mistreated and overlooked by standing up to the challenges presented by the church and the corrupters of the industry.\n\nOne of the first similarities in Daniel's \"role\" to that of Jesus was in the way he gathered those around him. When Jesus gathered his disciples, he required that they leave their families and jobs to follow him, dedicate their lives to his mission. Much like Jesus, Daniel goes across the city to find a group of actors that will help him put on the show. In each case, Daniel interrupts them from their work, whether it is waitressing or dubbing porn for the French speaking audience, and tells them that he wants them to help him create the play. In both cases, those that leave their current jobs to follow the one that seeks them, doesn't know what they are leaving for. The disciples had no promises or expectations on what to expect when they left and it was a very big risk for them to follow him. Not only was it risky, but they did it without asking any questions, \"Come, follow me and I will make you fishers of men. At once they left their nets and followed him\" (Mark 1:17-18). This is the same for Mireille, Constance, Martin and Rene as they leave their jobs for an uncertain economic future of producing a play. They too seem relatively confident in their opportunity to work with Daniel. After working together for a short time, the group becomes very close and seems to be together very often, even for midnight drunken walks. The most important part of each group is their faith in the leader they are following and serving. They see and believe in them so much that they can't leave. In this way, Daniel very much resembles Christ because of his undying passion for his work and those he cares about."
