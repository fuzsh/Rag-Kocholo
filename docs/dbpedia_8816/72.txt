“Bank of America Plaza is the smartest building in North Texas. The amount of technology that’s in the building and the way that it is user-friendly and useful to the tenants directly from day 1 is very impressive. The building’s twenty-plus years old, and it functions better and more efficiently than buildings that are just coming out of the ground today. Here at Bank of America Plaza, we utilize the latest in technology to keep all our tenants comfortable and safe. You’re going to be safe because there are 128 security cameras, all tied to the same better-network backbone, that all security officers have access to via cellphone and are monitored twenty-four hours a day.” – Executives at Bank of America Plaza
