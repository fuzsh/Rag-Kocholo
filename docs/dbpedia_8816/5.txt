DALLAS, TX

The Dallas Morning News reported Wednesday that the 72-story Bank of America Plaza is getting a new entry, lobby areas and remodeling of the retail court. The $20 million project will include upgrades to the signature green lights that outline the skyscraper.

Work crews have put up construction fences surrounding the office tower that opened in 1985.

John Crawford with Downtown Dallas Inc. says the work is a necessary and an important ingredient in bringing the building up to a different level.

Officials with Metropolis Investment Holdings Inc. did not immediately return a message Wednesday about the renovation.
