The history of skyscrapers in Dallas began with the construction of the Praetorian Building in 1909, which is often regarded as the first skyscraper in the city,[3] the Southwestern United States and sometimes the entire Western United States.[4] Dallas went through a construction boom in the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in the construction of over 20 skyscrapers, including the Bank of America Plaza and the Renaissance Tower. This boom ended in the late 1980s. From the completion of the Cityplace Center in 1988 until the construction of W Dallas Victory Hotel & Residences in 2006, the city was the site of no major high-rise construction projects.[5] The city is currently going through a second building boom, with 9 new skyscrapers planned to rise over 300 feet (91 m) proposed, approved, or under construction in the city.[6] Dallas is the site of 19 skyscrapers at least 492 feet (150 m) tall. Overall, the skyline of Dallas is ranked (based upon existing and under construction buildings over 492 feet (150 m) second in the South Central United States (after Houston) and sixth in the United States, after New York City, Chicago, Miami, Houston, and Los Angeles.[A]

Over the past few years, there have been many skyscrapers proposed for construction in Dallas. The tallest building currently under construction in the city is the Victory Tower, which will likely stand as the tallest building in the new Victory Park neighborhood. The building is planned to rise 650 feet (198 m). The Museum Tower is the tallest building proposed for the city, planned to rise 560 feet (171 m) in the Arts District. It would stand as the 2nd-tallest all-residential skyscraper in the city if constructed.

Timeline of tallest buildings

This lists buildings that once held the title of tallest building in Dallas. The first skyscraper in the city is generally regarded to be the Praetorian Building, which served as the city's tallest from 1909 until 1912.[3] The Praetorian Building was also the first skyscraper constructed in the Southwestern United States and is sometimes classified as the first skyscraper to be constructed in the Western United States.[4] However, depending on one's definition of "the West", this title could also go to the 1885 Lumber Exchange Building in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Source of Skyline ranking information: SkyscraperPage.com diagrams: New York City, Chicago, Miami, Houston, Los Angeles, Dallas.

B. ^ The Reunion Tower is not a habitable building, but is included in this list for comparative purposes. Per a ruling by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, freestanding observation towers are not considered to be buildings, as they are not fully habitable structures.

C. ^ This excludes the height of the building's five rooftop spires, which were not added until 1987. With the addition of the spires, the building's height was extended to 886 feet (270 m).
