        "text": "Thought this would be a fun dream scenario. You can take 1 building from every major American city and “move” it to NYC. It doesn’t necessarily have to be the tallest, maybe just the best in your opinion. Of course in many situations the tallest probably is the best, but there are a few cities where that definitely isn’t the case. The buildings can be placed anywhere you see fit in Manhattan (empty lots, that huge lot on the east river could probably take at least 3-4 alone, replace shitty low rises) anywhere in the boroughs or on the Jersey side to beef up the skyline from other angles. To be honest, other than the huge empty lot on the East River, I would mostly leave Manhattan alone and beef up Brooklyn, Queens and Jersey with most of these.\n\nHere’s my list. There are some MAJOR cities that quite frankly don’t even have anything worth moving, Phoenix, San Diego, San Antonio, and Portland come to mind. But here goes:\n\nLA: U.S Bank Tower: 1018 feet\n\nChicago: Sears/Willis Tower: 1451 feet\n\nPhiladelphia: Comcast Technology Center: 1121 feet\n\nHouston: TC Energy Center: 780 feet\n\nDallas: Comerica Bank Tower: 787 feet\n\nSan Francisco: Transamerica Pyramid: 853 feet\n\nSeattle: Columbia Center: 937 feet\n\nCleveland: Terminal Tower: 771 feet\n\nAtlanta: Bank of America Plaza: 1,023 feet\n\nBoston: Four Seasons Hotel and Private Residences: 742 feet\n\nMiami: One Thousand Museum: 709 feet\n\nAustin: The Austonian: 683 feet\n\nCharlotte: Bank of America Tower: 871 feet\n\nCincinati: Great American Tower: 665 feet\n\nIndianapolis: Salesforce Tower: 701 feet\n\nPittsburg: One PPG Place: 635 feet\n\nNashville: AT&T Building: 617 feet\n\nKansas City: One Kansas City Place: 624 feet\n\nTampa: 100 North Tampa: 579 feet\n\nSt Louis: Thomas F Eagleton Courthouse: 557 feet\n\nDetroit: Ally Detroit Center: 619 feet (until Hudson’s Site is done at 685 feet)\n\nOklahoma City: Devon Energy Center: 844 feet\n\nMinneapolis: Wells Fargo Center: 775 feet\n\nBaltimore: Bank of America Building: 509 feet"
