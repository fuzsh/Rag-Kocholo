        "text": "By Liviu Oltean, Associate Editor\n\nMetropolis Investment Holdings Inc. recently appointed Peloton Commercial Real Estate as manager of Bank of America Plaza, one of Dallas’ most iconic skyscrapers. Encompassing more than 1.8 million square feet of office and retail space, the 72-story tower not only stands as Dallas’ tallest office building but also as the third-tallest building in Texas and the 22nd-tallest in the United States. Completed in 1985 and designed by JPS Architects, the tower was developed through a joint venture between Prudential Insurance, Bramalea LTD and First National Bank.\n\n“Bank of America Plaza has been one of our firm’s most important leasing assignments for the past several years, and we are delighted to combine leasing and management operations under the Peloton platform,” said Peloton Commercial Real Estate Co-founder Joel Pustmueller. “We believe the combined synergy will enhance and accelerate the repositioning of this iconic asset.”\n\nPeloton has selected Adam Bernhardt as head of the management team and added several new members to it, including Grant Summer and John Dickenson as well as Pustmueller. With these new appointments, Tom Prescott, president of Metropolis Investment Holdings, said he believes there is now an excellent leasing and management team for the famous asset.\n\nPeloton is planning on relocating its headquarters to the tower as proof of its commitment to the Central Business District. “For those of us who have been longtime advocates of the CBD, it is an exciting time that has been years in the making,” said Pustmueller. “The attraction of the downtown area improves almost daily, and the future is bright.”"
