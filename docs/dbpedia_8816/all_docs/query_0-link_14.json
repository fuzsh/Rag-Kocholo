        "text": "VOICE OVER: Rebecca Brayton\n\nThe bustling metropolis of Dallas, Texas boasts a number of architectural styles, and features buildings from different periods in its history. One of the most architecturally significant buildings in the city is the town hall, designed by famed architect I.M. Pei. Pei designed other buildings for the city, including the towering and reflective Fountain Place. The West Village is a newer district that has become a hot spot, and it is served by the city's DART transit system. Visitors can see the entire city from the Reunion Tower observation deck, which is one of the most recognizable structures on the skyline. In this video, http://www.WatchMojo.com explores a few of the top architectural sites of Dallas, Texas.\n\nHistory\n\nBecause of an oil boom in the 1980s, Dallas grew from a moderately-sized city to one filled with towering skyscrapers and huge plazas. Dallas is also surrounded by looping highways that make commuting to and from this bustling metropolis an easy task. However aside from those infrastructure elements, the city of Dallas is home to attention-grabbing design.\n\nThe City Hall\n\nOne of the city’s major urban development undertakings is actually its town hall. This triangular concrete monolith was built to represent the strength and stability of Dallas’ population, and was designed by famed architect I.M. Pei. Interestingly, this town hall was meant to improve the city’s image after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in nearby Dealey Plaza in 1963.\n\nFountain Place\n\nPei also designed a number of other important Dallas buildings, including the impressive Fountain Place skyscraper.\n\nThe West Village\n\nThe relatively newly-built West Village district has become a hot spot in Dallas. It features restaurants and cafes, as well as tree-lined streets that are perfect for a nice stroll. The West Village is served by the Dallas Area Rapid Transit, or DART system, which includes a light rail system. Streetcars are one ingenious and neat way to travel through the city, whether you’re a visitor or a resident.\n\nBridges\n\nAs Dallas is located on the Trinity River, the city features a number of practical and beautiful bridges, as well. The Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge features a 40-storey arch that can be seen from miles around.\n\nReunion Tower\n\nOne important element of the Dallas skyline is the Reunion Tower. Notable for its shape, this observation tower opened in 1978, and at 561 feet high it is one of Dallas’ taller structures. The Reunion Tower is one of the most recognizable buildings on the skyline due to its spherical design, and this dome houses a 360 degree observation deck, as well as a revolving restaurant and a club. At night, this is another structure that stands out against the rest.\n\nAn Architectural Hot Spot\n\nWith towering buildings, unique architecture and even great nighttime scenes, Dallas is a great spot for lovers of design.\n\nComments ∧"
