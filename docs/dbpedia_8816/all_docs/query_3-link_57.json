        "text": "California architecture studio AO has put forward plans for a supertall skyscraper as part of a development in Oklahoma City that, if completed, will be the second-tallest building in the United States.\n\nThe skyscraper will be part of a development called the Boardwalk at Bricktown in downtown Oklahoma City. Plans consist of three 345-foot-tall (105 metre-tall) towers and one larger tower that could be as tall as 1,750 feet (533 metres).\n\nAs it stands, the plan for the three-acre site has gained approval for the smaller towers, but is still seeking approval for the supertall tower. If built, it would be only 26 feet shorter than the SOM-designed One World Trade Center in New York, the tallest building in the US.\n\nIts height puts it well within the supertall range, a category given to skyscrapers with heights between 900 and 2,000 feet tall (300-600 metres).\n\nAO said the height was a response to the city's growing population. The tallest building in Oklahoma City currently is Devon Tower, which has a height of 844 feet (257 metres).\n\n\"The tower's height evolved to align with the visionary goals set by both the developer and the city,\" AO managing partner Rob Budetti told Dezeen.\n\n\"As Oklahoma City experiences a surge in market growth, characterized by increasing demand, population, and the development of employment hubs, the design for The Boardwalk at Bricktown has progressed in response to the dynamic expansion and advancement within this thriving urban landscape.\"\n\nDesigned for developers of Matteson Capital and Thinkbox, the complex will hold retail and entertainment spaces and the towers will hold residences and a hotel.\n\nRenderings show three smaller towers flanking a central corridor decked out with storefronts, a mezzanine, water features and light installations, with the supertall skyscraper at the back of the complex.\n\nThe supertall skyscraper will be relatively flat with a uniform shape that tapers up slowly towards the structure's crown.\n\nThe skyscraper and the towers will be clad with glass and illuminated at points by strips of light at their corners.\n\nThornton Tomasetti has been brought on for the structural engineering of the project.\n\nAO is based outside of Los Angeles and the project will be its first foray into supertall skyscrapers.\n\nOther supertall buildings in the works in the United States include a 1,388-foot-tall (423 metres) skyscraper for JPMorgan Chase in New York City by Foster + Partners.\n\nThe images are by AO Architects."
