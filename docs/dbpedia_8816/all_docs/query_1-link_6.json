        "text": "Fountain Place\n\nKnown as the Allied Bank Tower when it was built in 1986, this tower had the dubious distinction of becoming the world's largest foreclosure. It's unfortunate, because this is one of the gems of the Dallas skyline, and there was to be a second tower next to it, sitting at a 90Â° angle. It is 60 stories tall, and looks different from every angle. The architect was I.M. Pei , who also designed our Symphony Center (see other photos on this site), and who is world famous for putting the pyramid in front of the Louvre, in Paris.\n\nWhat is even more remarkable about this building is the focus on the public. On the grounds around the building is a stunning array of fountains, pools, trees, and a general park-like atmosphere. You can see the pictures of the fountain grid (and hence the newer name). They are computer controlled and come on in varying sequences.\n\nThe image below conveys a unique perspective- I used a fish-eye lens for the shot. And, in the lower left, you see a reflection of me and my friend Dennis in the glass of one of the supporting columns."
