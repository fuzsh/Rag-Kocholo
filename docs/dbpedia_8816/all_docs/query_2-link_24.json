        "text": "History\n\nIn 1841 John Neely Bryan, a lawyer and trader from Tennessee, built the first cabin (now restored) in the area on the riverbank. Other settlers moved into the region, and a town site was laid out in 1844. The origin of the community’s name is uncertain; most likely it is named for early settler Joseph Dallas or for George Mifflin Dallas, vice president (1845–49) of the United States. Its early settlement was augmented by Swiss and German immigrants and in the late 1850s by French artisans from the unsuccessful Fourierist utopian colony at nearby La Réunion. Large numbers of African Americans moved into the area after the American Civil War.\n\nCommercial growth was stimulated by the arrival of the railroads in the 1870s. A huge wholesale market developed, with many of the city’s retail stores serving the American Southwest; one, Neiman-Marcus, has become internationally known. The adjacent communities of East Dallas and Oak Cliff were annexed in 1889 and 1903, respectively, greatly expanding the city’s size.\n\nLocally produced grain, leather, and especially cotton (grown in the black-clay fields around Dallas) fed the city’s early growth and were followed by insurance and, later, oil. The Dallas Cotton Exchange was organized in 1907 and in the early decades of the 20th century was one of the world’s largest cotton markets. In addition, the city was a top manufacturer of cotton-ginning machinery. Also during the early 20th century, Dallas was a centre of food processing and the manufacture of textiles and leather products, and an automobile plant and a branch bank of the Federal Reserve System were established there. Mexican immigrants contributed to the population growth. In 1930 C.M. (“Dad”) Joiner discovered the great East Texas oil field, which attracted investment and made the city a major centre of the petroleum industry. Dallas’s Central Centennial Exposition (1936), the state’s official observance of the Texas revolution centennial, was a boon to the city’s Depression-era economy, and one of the country’s first shopping centres opened in 1931 in the suburb of Highland Park.\n\nThe city began a period of spectacular growth during and after World War II, when several large aircraft-manufacturing plants were established in the area. These were followed by electronics and automobile-assembly plants. Dallas was thrust abruptly into the international spotlight on November 22, 1963, when U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated as he rode in a motorcade through the downtown area of Dealey Plaza. Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport opened in 1974, drawing business to the region and making it an attractive location for corporate headquarters. The oil business reached its peak in the early 1980s; however, by the end of the decade the industry had gone bust, and thereafter its contribution to the economy decreased dramatically. In 1987 Annette Strauss became the city’s first elected female mayor, and in 1995 the first African American mayor, Ron Kirk, was elected.\n\nThe contemporary city\n\nDallas today is a cosmopolitan city known for its high concentration of restaurants and shopping centres. Skyscrapers, such as Bank of America Plaza (1985) and Reunion Tower (1978), create a striking night skyline. The population density is unusually low for a major metropolitan area, reflecting the predominance of single-family homes (about two-thirds of all dwelling units). The city is ethnically diverse, with less than half its population being of European descent. About one-fourth of the residents are African American, and more than one-third are Hispanic. Dallas became well known in popular culture as the setting for the eponymous television drama series (originally broadcast 1978–91); the ranch where the show was filmed is now a tourist attraction and convention centre.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

A top global wholesale market, the city is the home of the Dallas Market Center (1957), one of the world’s largest wholesale merchandise complexes. In addition, it is the world headquarters of the U.S. Army and Air Force Exchange Service, which provides goods and services to military personnel. Wholesale and retail trade combine with services (particularly business, financial, and health) to form the backbone of the economy. Dallas is the leading banking, financial, and trade centre for the Southwest, and some 6,000 companies have their corporate headquarters there. The city is also a busy convention centre and a hub of airline services. It is a well-known medical centre; the headquarters of the American Heart Association is there, as are the Texas A&M College of Dentistry (1905) and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas (1943).\n\nDallas has one of the country’s largest concentrations of telecommunications and high-technology manufacturing and services companies. The top technology fields include software production, computer services, and manufacturing of computer hardware, semiconductors, and wireless communication equipment. Food processing, publishing, printing, and advertising are also important. Clothing manufacture is less significant than in the past, but the city is still known as a regional fashion and women’s apparel centre. Aerospace manufacturing remains an economic factor, although production greatly decreased during the 1990s. Hundreds of oil companies are still headquartered in Dallas, as are many drilling-equipment supply firms and geophysical exploration firms; however, oil and gas extraction now has little economic impact. Cotton’s importance to the city has also declined.\n\nDallas is a major transportation hub and the trucking and distribution centre of the Southwest. The international airport is one of the world’s busiest, and the amount of cargo passing through it ranks it as the largest inland port in the United States. The city operates a second major airport, Love Field, and a smaller facility for corporate aircraft and general aviation. The region has an extensive network of highways and commuter-rail and light-rail transit systems.\n\nThe Dallas–Fort Worth region is one of the state’s principal centres of higher education. In addition to the schools mentioned above, institutions in the Dallas area include Dallas Baptist University (1898), Southern Methodist University (1911), the University of Dallas (1956), the University of Texas at Dallas (1961), and several community colleges.\n\nThe city is known for its cultural activities, including opera, ballet, musicals, and symphony concerts; a notable facility is the Kalita Humphreys Theater (1959; part of the Dallas Theater Center), designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Dallas’s arts district is the frequent site of shows and festivals and includes the Dallas Museum of Art, sculpture gardens, galleries of Asian art, and the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center (1989), designed by I.M. Pei. Pioneer Plaza at the Dallas Convention Center features a life-size bronze sculpture of a cattle drive, complete with 70 head of cattle and 3 cowboys. Old City Park preserves some three dozen restored North Texas buildings, most from the 19th century. The John F. Kennedy Memorial Plaza is near the spot where that president was assassinated; the Sixth Floor Museum (in the building facing the plaza from which the assassin allegedly shot) is dedicated to the assassination and its aftereffects.\n\nFair Park contains extensive recreational facilities, including the Cotton Bowl (home of the annual American collegiate football classic), a music hall, several museums (including African American art, natural history, and science), a planetarium, an aquarium, a horticulture centre, and the fairgrounds of one of the country’s largest annual state expositions. The Dallas Zoo is noted for its reptile collection. Cowboys Stadium in Arlington is the home of the Dallas Cowboys (American football) and the team’s famous cheerleaders; other professional sports teams include the Texas Rangers (baseball), Dallas Mavericks (basketball), Dallas Stars (ice hockey), and FC Dallas (football [soccer]). Several lakes in and around the city provide outdoor recreational opportunities; White Rock Lake, a reservoir in the northeastern part of the city, is surrounded by parkland that includes an arboretum."
