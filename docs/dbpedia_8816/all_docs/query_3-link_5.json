        "text": "Dallas entered the list of cities with skyscrapers in 1909 with the construction of the 190 ft. high Praetorian Building, at a time when buildings with 10-20 floors were considered as skyscrapers. Since then construction in Dallas has been rapid as it displays some of the finest structures of the postmodernist and modernist era. The city consists of 33 high rise buildings which include 19 skyscrapers. 4 more towers, currently under construction, are expected to join this list by 2021. The list of towers given below in descending order of their heights defines the glorious Dallas skyline and constitutes the tallest buildings in the city.\n\n1. Bank of America Plaza\n\nThe tallest building in Dallas since its completion 1985, Bank of America Plaza located on the Main Street District, is the 32nd tallest skyscraper in the United States at 921ft and is a LEED Gold certified structure. The late modernist styled tower was designed by JPJ Architects and consists of 72 floors that accommodate 19,00,000 sq ft. of office space, 8 unique dining spaces, retail areas, gyms, and lounges for their tenants. This elegant glass tower was often called “The Pickle” due to the green led light that accentuates its silhouette at night.\n\n2. Renaissance Tower\n\nLocated at the adjacent Elm Street from the Bank of America Plaza, is The Renaissance Tower. Designed by HOK, the skyscraper stood at a height 710 ft. in 1974 and was originally the tallest building in Dallas, before the opening of the Bank of America Plaza and a few other towers that would surpass it after their completion. To reclaim some reputation, it was renovated in 1986 by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill and was brought to a height of 886ft. These 56 storeyed towersis known for its rooftop spires and unique double “X” lighting.\n\n3. Comerica Bank Tower\n\nDesigned and completed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee on the Main Street District of Dallas in 1987, the 787 ft. tall and 60 storeyed Comerica Bank Tower is a postmodern structure with a modernized barrel vault facade that gives it an Art Deco feel. It would dethrone the Renaissance Tower as the second tallest skyscraper in Dallas if the spire and antenna lengths were not considered in the overall height. Originally designed as a banking building, the structure was made to look intimidating with its lack of interactive retail spaces, block walls of polished granite and darkened glazing, but now offers 1.5 million sqft of office space.\n\n4. JP Morgan Chase Tower\n\nThe fourth-tallest building of Dallas is located at Ross Avenue, in the City Centre District. It is a 55 storeyed postmodern skyscraper, 738ft in height and would be third tallest in the city if the spire and antenna lengths were excluded. Designed and completed by Richard Keating in 1987, the structure is also known as the “Keyhole Building” due to its curved top with a 6 storey hole in the centre.\n\n5. Fountain Place\n\nThe Fountain Place, named after the assortment of 172 fountains located at its base was designed by multiple architects, including I.M Pei, Henry Cobb, Harry Weese Associates and WZMH Architects. This 720 ft., 60 storeyed late modernist tower resembling a large prism is located in downtown Dallas. The initial proposal of twin towers at right angles remained incomplete but a 45 storeyed AMLI Fountain Place being constructed on the adjacent plot is set to accompany it soon.\n\n6. Trammels Crow Center\n\nT708 ft. high, 50 storeyed postmodern towers designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill is located at Ross Avenue of downtown Dallas.

The facade is made up of elegant flamed and polished Autumn Brown Granite and glass Pyramids at the centre of each face.\n\n7. 1700 Pacific Avenue\n\n1700 Pacific Avenue, an office building, located in the city centre district was the second tallest tower in Dallas at its time of completion in 1983, with a height of 655 ft. and 49 floors.

Architects Harrell and Hamilton were hired to design this structure that would be the tallest in the city but was unsuccessful due to height restrictions.\n\n13. One AT&T Plaza\n\nOne AT&T Plaza also known as the Whitacre Towers is the headquarters of American multinational company AT&T and named after its former chairman Edward Whitacre Jr. This skyscraper of glass and white stone was built in 1984 and is located in downtown Dallas.
