        "text": "My path to Mavs Moneyball is a weird one. I’d been writing for the now-defunct ESPN Truehoop network blog, the Two Man Game, run by Rob Mahoney (who is now with the Ringer). One day in 2013 I was tagged in a tweet, my Twitter friend Jon introduced me to LJ Rotter, then Editor-in-Chief of Mavs Moneyball, and suggested me as a potential add to the site. She offered me a position the same day. 11 years later, here we are.\n\nDuring my time with this site, we’ve grown and changed greatly. The industry has changed around us, first with a boom in basketball jobs, then a slow collapse. What began as a blog in the early 2000’s has grown and changed over 20+ years. We’ve had contributors come and go as popular writing styles have changed and then changed again. Podcasts rose as a form of basketball media consumption, with YouTube coming soon after. And here we’ve been the whole time.\n\nEvery year or so, we look for new contributors. During my time here we’ve had people like Tim Cato, Jonathan Tjarks, Iztok Franko, Dalton Trigg, Nick Angstadt, and others join the ranks, contribute, then head offer to bigger and better pastures. We’ve also seen 50-60 other people stop by, write for a few seasons, then head back to their civilian lives, that need to write having been quenched or because life changed and they no longer had the time to help.\n\nThe time for new writers has come again. Our current staff of 20 or so is still dedicated, but 82 games is a lot and frankly, new voices can often help us battle-worn folks rediscover what we loved about writing about the Dallas Mavericks in the first place.\n\n“Alright Kirk, it’s been 300 words, tell us how to apply already.” I’m glad you asked. Here’s the link to the form. What we’re looking for is people who are familiar with our site, have a passion for the Mavericks, and want to contribute to the type of content we run, particularly during the season. While I rarely reject ideas, game coverage is our bread and butter, and we aim to do that well. If games are covered well, everything else follows.\n\nWhile I will not have time to reply to everyone who applies, thank you so much for even considering. I tend to save this ask until the dead of the off-season, because I want the true Dallas diehards covering this team."
