        "text": "New 800,000 sq. Foot Building to Provide State-of-the-Art Amenities and House 5,000+ Employees\n\nSustainable, All-Electric Workplace Designed to Achieve LEED and WELL Certifications; Adjacent to Brand-New 1.5 Acre Urban Park\n\nCentrally Located in the City of Dallas, New Building is in Close Proximity to Cultural and Community Attractions, including the Perot Museum, the Katy Trail and American Airlines Center\n\nDALLAS – Goldman Sachs, along with Hunt Realty Investments and Hillwood Urban, today broke ground on its Dallas Campus at NorthEnd. The state-of-the-art, 800,000 sq. foot building located at 2323 North Field Street will be composed of two wings, with the tallest being 14 floors. Located on three acres on the southeast corner of the broader NorthEnd Development, the campus will sit alongside a 1.5-acre urban park.\n\n“We have been operating in Dallas for more than 50 years—this state-of-the-art new campus further demonstrates our commitment to Dallas, and is testament to the incredible talent and strong client base in the region,” said Goldman Sachs President and Chief Operating Officer John Waldron. “We look forward to Goldman Sachs’ vibrant future in Dallas and are excited to continue partnering with the local community for many years to come.”\n\nDesigned by Henning Larsen Architects in New York, the building will provide a modern working environment and purpose-built workspaces to enable collaboration and productivity in serving Goldman Sachs’ client base in the Dallas area and beyond. The new campus was designed to support the health and wellness of Goldman Sachs’ workforce. With social spaces and on-floor formal and informal collaboration opportunities and hospitality offerings, the building will also feature an on-site cafe, a fitness center, back-up childcare, underground parking, conferencing spaces and access to a variety of outdoor gardens and terraces.\n\nThe building owner is Hunt Realty, and the developer of the project is Hillwood Urban.\n\n“Luring the biggest names in business is becoming business as usual in Dallas — but this is a major moment for our city,” said Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson. “Goldman Sachs is the premier name in finance and investment banking. The expansion of this global brand in our city center is a remarkable sign of how far Dallas has come in recent years as we have focused on attracting talent and businesses by prioritizing public safety, improving quality of life, and reducing our tax rate. This new development also shows that there are still greater things to come for a city that is already a unique and mighty engine of economic growth for our entire nation.”\n\n“We’re thrilled to partner with Goldman Sachs on the NorthEnd site,” said Hunt Realty Investments Chief Executive Officer Chris Kleinert. “Goldman Sachs will serve as an anchor for many years to come in NorthEnd.”\n\n“We look forward to developing a one-of-a-kind facility for Goldman Sachs and its workforce,” said Hillwood Chairman Ross Perot, Jr.\n\nThe building aims to achieve LEED and WELL certifications and will be powered entirely by electric energy. The project will promote opportunities to work with small, diverse and local talent as part of the firm’s supplier diversity goals.\n\nWith the new building, Goldman Sachs will have the capacity to house more than 5,000 people, core to bringing its people together in the Dallas metro area. Goldman Sachs currently employs roughly 4,000 people in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area. Goldman Sachs has a longstanding commitment to recruiting and developing the best talent and is investing deeply in strengthening its training and recruiting programs with local educational institutions.\n\nGoldman Sachs has deep roots in Dallas, operating in the city since 1968. Currently, Dallas serves as the firm’s second-largest office in the United States. The firm’s Dallas footprint includes employees from all businesses of the firm and all divisions.\n\nCentrally located, the new building is in close vicinity to many cultural and community attractions, including the Perot Museum, the Katy Trail and American Airlines Center.\n\nBuilding construction is expected to be completed in late 2027.\n\nAbout Goldman Sachs\n\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a leading global financial institution that delivers a broad range of financial services to a large and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals. Founded in 1869, the firm is headquartered in New York and maintains offices in all major financial centers around the world.\n\nAbout Hunt Realty Investments\n\nHunt Realty Investments serves as the centralized real estate investment company for the Hunt entities and has been active in the real estate acquisition, ownership and investment business for more than 45 years. Today, the company’s primary investment activities are centered in Dallas and the surrounding metroplex, including direct-owned assets such as Fields, the future North End development, and Reunion.
