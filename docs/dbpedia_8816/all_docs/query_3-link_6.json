Dallas' downtown still looks like a mini-Houston.\n\nThey still don't have an Uptown skyline like ours or anything to compete even with TMC's skyline.\n\nThere's nothing that blows you out of the water. Look, after driving for hours and seeing nothing but grass, trees and the occasional cow...Dallas will look impressive.\n\nI enjoy Dallas when I visit for sure...but am always glad to come back to big ole Houston.\n\nLOL.\n\nThis is exactly what I was talking about Niarobi . Why is it so important to discredit the OP's opinion? Yes Downtown Dallas is indeed smaller than Downtown Houston but like the OP said...the architecture in Dallas is better than in Houston which I thinks makes up for its size. Downtown Houston's size no longer gives it the edge. Its time to spruce things up a bit...even Stonclaw said that...\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Dallaz\n\nYou mean 3rd tallest. (You cannot count antennas on a building, only spires)\n\nSo Sears Tower's anntenaes don't count either?\n\nWhile some people may believe that only spires count, I disagree.\n\nThey are part of the overall structure of the building & with One Shells Plaza's anntenae the building stands at exactly 1,000 feet tall. It even has a blinking red obstruction light on top for aircraft warning.\n\nI bet if One Shell Plaza put some colored flood lights on it your opinion would change. That's the Dallas way you know. Renaissance Tower did it recently & it looks ridiculous.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Metro Matt\n\nSo Sears Tower's anntenaes don't count either?\n\nWhile some people may believe that only spires count, I disagree.\n\nThey are part of the overall structure of the building & with One Shells Plaza's anntenae the building stands at exactly 1,000 feet tall.

Renaissance Tower did it recently & it looks ridiculous.\n\nWhy do you think the New One World Trade Center will not be the tallest building in America? The 400+ ft tower will no longer be a spire.\n\n\"We count spires toward the height, if it's part of the architecture, it it's part of the actual design of the building, we count it toward the height,\" Kevin Brass, spokesperson for the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, a private body that serves as a worldwide arbiter of building heights, told WCBS 880. \"But antennas, or any other apparatus that are simply put on top of a building, we do not count toward the height.\"\n\nSource: One World Trade Center may not get \"America's tallest building\" status - CBS News\n\nThe spires on the Renaissance tower is apart of the 80s redesign of the building. When a antenna is added, it's not designed into the architecture of the building, it's just stuck up there. (Just like how the antenna was stuck up on One Shell Plaza) How 'bout you find a skyscraper diagram that places the height of One Shell Plaza at 1000 ft.\n\nWhat's wrong with the lights? The spires were always flood lit. I like the new blue color though.\n\nPics I found on the net\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wXgZs.jpg\n\nhttp://i629.photobucket.com/albums/u...r0290902PM.jpg\n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/jjoepho...n/photostream/\n\nLast edited by Dallaz; 06-05-2012 at 01:28 PM.."
