That was the first Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) bank to fail since Citizens Bank of Sac City, Iowa failed in November 2023. That was the fifth FDIC bank failure of 2023, a year with some of the largest bank failures in U.S. history.\n\nEarlier in 2023, Silicon Valley Bank failed March 10, followed by Signature Bank two days later, ending an unusual streak of more than 800 days without a bank failure. The next bank that failed was First Republic Bank on May 1, then Heartland Tri-State Bank on July 28. Later in November 2023, Citizens Bank failed.\n\nU.S. bank failures\n\nLongest periods between U.S. bank failures since 1933\n\nPrevious bank failure Bank failure Days since previous bank failure\n\nSource: FDIC\n\nJune 25, 2004 Feb. 2, 2007 951 Oct. 23, 2020 March 10, 2023 867 Jan. 13, 1945 Sept. 14, 1946 608 Dec. 15, 2017 May 31, 2019 531 Aug. 16, 1996 Nov. 21, 1997 461 Feb. 19, 1962 May 24, 1963 458 May 26, 1953 Aug. 9, 1954 439\n\nGenerally, a failure occurs when a bank becomes insolvent, meaning it lacks the funds to cover all of its customers’ deposits and the money it owes to others, according to the FDIC.\n\nBank failures aren’t uncommon; a few typically happen each year. So it’s rare for there to be years like 2022, 2021, 2018, 2006 or 2005, when there were no banks closed.\n\nBefore March 2023, only three banks had failed since the coronavirus pandemic started. And all three (The First State Bank, First City Bank of Florida and Almena State Bank) experienced previous financial problems, according to the FDIC. (There was one bank failure in 2020 before the pandemic started.)\n\nBank failures happen from time to time, which is why it’s important to have your money – including your savings accounts, certificates of deposit, checking and money market accounts – at an FDIC bank and make sure you’re within FDIC insurance limits and guidelines. No depositor has lost a penny of FDIC-insured funds since 1933.\n\nAs soon as a bank fails, the FDIC estimates how much that bank failure will cost the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). Quarterly assessments on FDIC-insured banks fund most of the DIF, according to the FDIC.\n\nBank failures since 2009\n\nYear Total number of bank failures\n\nSource: Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\n\n2024 1 2023 5 2022 0 2021 0 2020 4 2019 4 2018 0 2017 8 2016 5 2015 8 2014 18 2013 24 2012 51 2011 92 2010 157 2009 140\n\n2023 – 2024 list of failed banks\n\n2024 list of failed banks\n\nFailed banks Date closed Republic First Bank (DBA Republic Bank) 04/26/2024\n\n2023 list of failed banks\n\nFailed banks Date closed Citizens Bank, Sac City, Iowa 11/03/2023 Heartland Tri-State Bank, Elkhart, Kansas 07/28/2023 First Republic Bank, San Francisco 05/01/2023 Signature Bank, New York 03/12/2023 Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, Calif. 03/10/2023\n\nList of failed banks from 2009 – 2020\n\n2020 list of failed banks\n\nFailed banks Date closed Almena State Bank, Almena, Kan. 10/23/2020 First City Bank of Florida, Fort Walton Beach, Fla. 10/16/2020 The First State Bank, Barboursville, W.Va. 04/03/2020 Ericson State Bank, Ericson, Neb. 02/14/2020\n\n2019 list of failed banks\n\nFailed banks Date closed City National Bank of New Jersey, Newark 11/1/2019 Resolute Bank, Maumee, Ohio 10/25/2019 Louisa Community Bank, Louisa, Ky. 10/25/2019 The Enloe State Bank, Cooper, Texas 05/31/2019\n\n2018 list of failed banks\n\nFailed banks Date closed None N/A\n\n2017 list of failed banks\n\nFailed banks Date closed Washington Federal Bank for Savings, Chicago 12/15/2017 The Farmers and Merchants State Bank of Argonia, Argonia, Kan. 10/13/2017 Fayette County Bank, Saint Elmo, Ill. 05/26/2017 Guaranty Bank, (dba BestBank in Georgia and Michigan), Milwaukee 05/05/2017 First NBC Bank, New Orleans 04/28/2017 Proficio Bank, Cottonwood Heights, Utah 03/03/2017 Seaway Bank & Trust Co., Chicago 01/27/2017 Harvest Community Bank, Pennsville, N.J. 01/13/2017\n\n2016 list of failed banks\n\nFailed banks Date closed Allied Bank, Mulberry, Ark. 09/23/2016 The Woodbury Banking Company, Woodbury, Ga. 08/19/2016 First CornerStone Bank, King of Prussia, Pa. 05/06/2016 Trust Company Bank, Memphis, Tenn. 04/29/2016 North Milwaukee State Bank, Milwaukee 03/11/2016\n\n2015 list of failed banks\n\nFailed banks Date closed Hometown National Bank, Longview, Wash. 10/02/2015 The Bank of Georgia, Peachtree City, Ga. 10/02/2015 Premier Bank, Denver 07/10/2015 Edgebrook Bank, Chicago 05/08/2015 Doral Bank, San Juan, Puerto Rico 02/27/2015 Capitol City Bank & Trust Co., Atlanta 02/13/2015 Highland Community Bank, Chicago 01/23/2015 First National Bank of Crestview, Crestview, Fla. 01/16/2015\n\n2014 list of failed banks\n\nFailed banks Date closed Northern Star Bank, Mankato, Minn. 12/19/2014 Frontier Bank (dba El Paseo Bank), Palm Desert, Calif. 11/07/2014 The National Republic Bank of Chicago 10/24/2014 NBRS Financial, Rising Sun, Md. 10/17/2014 GreenChoice Bank, Chicago 07/25/2014 Eastside Commercial Bank, Conyers, Ga. 07/18/2014 The Freedom State Bank, Freedom, Okla. 06/27/2014 Valley Bank, Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 06/20/2014 Valley Bank, Moline, Ill. 06/20/2014 Slavie Federal Savings Bank, Bel Air, Md. 05/30/2014 Columbia Savings Bank, Cincinnati 05/23/2014 AztecAmerica Bank, Berwyn, Ill. 05/16/2014 Allendale County Bank, Fairfax, S.C. 04/25/2014 Vantage Point Bank, Horsham, Pa. 02/28/2014 Millennium Bank, Sterling, Va. 02/28/2014 Syringa Bank, Boise, Idaho 01/31/2014 The Bank of Union, El Reno, Okla. 01/24/2014 DuPage National Bank, West Chicago, Ill. 01/17/2014\n\n2013 list of failed banks\n\nFailed banks Date closed Texas Community Bank, The Woodlands, Texas 12/13/2013 Bank of Jackson County, Graceville, Fla. 10/30/2013 First National Bank, Edinburg, Texas 9/13/2013 The Community’s Bank, Bridgeport, Conn. 9/13/2013 Sunrise Bank of Arizona, Phoenix 8/23/2013 Community South Bank, Parsons, Tenn. 8/23/2013 Bank of Wausau, Wausau, Wis. 8/9/2013 First Community Bank of Southwest Florida (also operating as Community Bank of Cape Coral), Ft.
