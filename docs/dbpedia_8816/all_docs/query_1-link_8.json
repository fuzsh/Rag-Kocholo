        "text": "The 1980s gave Dallas most of its skyline, with more towers popping up than any time in the city's history.\n\nAlong with the tall buildings came a few tall tales.\n\nWhen designs for the rocket-shaped Fountain Place tower hit the media, Dallas residents were pop-eyed at the plan. The Ross Avenue skyscraper looked nothing like other downtown buildings, with its pointed top and flared sides.\n\nBecause of the unique shape, developers ran wind tunnel tests with a model of the tower to make sure a strong gale wouldn't cause it to spin on its base like a giant pinwheel.\n\nOnce the engineers assured everybody that the 60-story green glass building would not take off in a strong wind, another rumor popped up. Downtown wags worried that because of the huge sloping sides of the building, rainwater would cascade off the tower onto the streets below.\n\nIt was suggested that the resulting deluge might be so strong as to knock over DART buses on Ross Avenue.\n\nIn truth, Fountain Place has a unique water handling system built into the skin of the building. Channels along the glass window frames carry the rainwater away and collect it so the pedestrians 60 stories below won't get kicked to the curb.\n\nDevelopers of Dallas' tallest building, Bank of America Plaza, had their own nasty rumor to deal with.\n\nBuilt with a then-unique steel and concrete structure, the skyscraper went up so fast on downtown's skyline that it seemed to grow overnight.\n\nWasn't too long before someone — probably a competing building leasing agent — started spreading the story that the tower's foundation was faulty and it was sinking into the ground. The tittle-tattle told it that the 72-story tower would soon be 71, 70, 69, 68 — you get the idea.\n\nThat wasn't what the owners wanted to hear when they were touting the tallest building in town.\n\nRepresentatives with Canadian developer Bramalea, which built the high-rise (originally called InterFirst Plaza), and their general contractors quickly debunked the story.\n\nAt 921 feet, it's still one of the tallest office towers in the country.\n\nRecent reports about a San Francisco condo tower that actually has begun to subside make the notion about the downtown Dallas skyscraper less loony. That 58-story San Francisco tower has sunk 16 inches since it was built in 2009.\n\nNot all the crazy Dallas building stories are hooey.\n\nIn 1967, when the 34-story One Main Place tower was being built, Dallas residents woke up one morning in January to find that a big chunk of Elm Street was missing.\n\nSometime after midnight, a half-block stretch of the roadway had disappeared, falling into a giant hole next to the skyscraper construction site.\n\nEngineers and geologists spent months trying to figure out just what happened to the street, while the developers and the city sued each other over who was to blame for the missing right of way.\n\nRegardless of what caused the cave-in, the media and Dallas humorists had a field day with the event.\n\nBumper stickers and T-shirts were soon advertising the collapsed street as a major Big D tourist attraction.\n\n\"In Dallas Visit Wonderful Elm Street Cave\" signs started popping up across town.\n\nUnderstandably, city officials were not amused. They had to come up with three-quarters of a million dollars to fill the huge pit, which turned out to be an unknown fault in the rock underground.\n\nSomeone suggested that the new downtown cavern be made a part of the Texas state parks system.\n\n\"The Elm Street Cavern is the last remaining scenic wonder in Dallas,\" one pundit proffered.\n\nAnd to think that these days, we make such prideful noise over that Calatrava bridge.\n\nNothing, it would seem, really tops an impromptu hole in the ground for stirring people's imaginations."
