Construction is scheduled to kick off Thursday on a new Dallas tower that will house operations of Bank of America.

The 30-story office high-rise will be built overlooking Klyde Warren Park at Harwood Street and Woodall Rodgers Freeway.

Bank of America announced in September that it plans to relocate almost 1,000 workers in its namesake skyscraper on Main Street in downtown Dallas to the new building planned in Uptown.

The bank will occupy about 238,000 square feet in the building, which is a project of developer KDC and Pacific Elm Properties. The half-million-square-foot high-rise is expected to open in 2027. Along with space for the bank, offices in the building are being offered to other business tenants.

The building is being designed by New York-based architect Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, working with Dallas-based Corgan and OJB Landscape Architecture. The tower will include a 12th-floor “sky lobby and lounge,” terraces and ground-floor retail spaces.

KDC has been working on the project since 2020 when it formed a partnership with building site owner Miyama USA Texas.

Partner Pacific Elm Properties is an investment firm backed by Tom Dundon, a Dallas billionaire who made his fortune in subprime auto loans before buying the Carolina Hurricanes hockey franchise. Pacific Elm owns multiple office towers in downtown Dallas.

Bank of America now occupies about a half million square feet of offices in the 72-story Bank of America Plaza — Dallas’ tallest skyscraper. The bank and its predecessors have occupied the building at 901 Main St. since it opened in 1985.
