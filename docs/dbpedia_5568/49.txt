Acrostic Poetry for Patton

Playful spirit, always quick to jest

Adventurous heart, never wants to rest

Takes on life with a laugh and a grin

Tends to trip over his own two feet, but wins!

Oblivious to messes, chaos all around

Never a dull moment when he's in town!

A Fun Roast for Patton

Pompous attitude, think you're a star,

Always loud, but we know you’re bizarre,

Too much bragging, do you hear the snore?

Too many claims, but you’ve done nothing more,

Oblivious to truth, living in your own lore,

Not a chance you’ll rise, we all know the score.

Passion ignites like stars in the night,

A dance of our souls, a magnetic delight.

Tender whispers linger close to my ear,

Together we forge an unbreakable sphere.

Onward we wander, with dreams shining clear,

Navigating love's path, my heart's always near.
