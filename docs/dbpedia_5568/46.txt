Early Origins of the Patton family

The surname Patton was first found in Cumberland (Cumbria) where the name "was the favourite Border form, and remains a Scottish surname today." 2

Paton with no forename was recorded in the Subsidy Rolls for Cumberland in 1332. As a forename we found Patone de Hangaldsyde in 1467. In 1230, Northumberland records show Hugo Patun and later, James Patoun was found in the Hundredorum Rolls for Bedfordshire in 1279. 3

Back in Scotland, "Paton is said to have been the name of a son of Sir Patrick Herring (fourteenth century). Royal pardons were granted to Paten Broune alias Broun and to the servant of Patein or Pateman Broin, 1407. Patone de Hangald-syde (1467) appears again in 1469 as Patrick Hangangside. Three persons named Pawton were voters in the parish of Qwilton (Coylton), 1513, and James Padyne, witness, 1514." 1

The Patton Motto +

The motto was originally a war cry or slogan. Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.

Motto: Virtute adepta

Motto Translation: Acquired by virtue
