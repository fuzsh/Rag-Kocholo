        "text": "By Amy Cosper, Family Business Magazine\n\nOne of the pillars of this family has always been altruistic. We want to help veterans no matter what. So we investigated cannabis and realized there was something there with medical cannabis. We could help veterans with PTSD\n\nThe Patton family name has been synonymous with the military for generations. General George S. Patton is widely considered one of the most successful combat generals in U.S. history and his son, George Patton IV, was a major general in the Korean and Vietnam Wars.\n\nToday, Bob Patton, the 64-year-old non-military grandson of George S. Patton, is the CEO of Green Meadows Farm. The 200-acre farm just north of Boston was intended as the retirement spot for Gen. George S. Patton, but he died in 1945 and never took up residence on the farm.\n\n“But my father did retire there, and he lived in relative quiet as a retiree,” explains Bob Patton. “After about a year of retirement, he became restless and decided he wanted to be a farmer, so that’s what he did. He grew vegetables, which he sold on a roadside farm stand.”"
