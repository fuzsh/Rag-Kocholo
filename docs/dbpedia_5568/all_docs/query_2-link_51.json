        "text": "Background\n\nPaula Patton’s full name is Paula Maxine Patton. She hails from Los Angeles, California where she works as an actress and producer. Her mother Joyce was a school teacher while her father was a lawyer. Paula Patton has mixed ancestry; her father is African-American, while her mother is of English, German, and Dutch descent. Patton’s love for cinema, in fact, is something she got from her mother.\n\nPatton attended Alexander Hamilton High School, where she developed a strong interest in theater. She even took part in several high school productions. After graduating from college, Patton landed a three-month job producing documentaries for P.B.S., which lead to her working as a production assistant for T.V. documentaries. She also produced documentaries for Howie Mandel’s talk show. Patton made her acting debut in “Hitch,” starring Will Smith as the titular character. She had a small role in the drama movie “London” shortly after. Since then, Patton has made several notable appearances in films and television shows. She’s most recognized for her performance as ‘Ms. Blu Rain,’ a lesbian teacher, in the drama film “Precious.“ The movie was nominated for six Academy Awards.\n\nPaula Patton first met Robin Thicke, a future recording artist, when she was 15 years old. Though they were still in their teens, they started dating, and years later, on June 11, 2005, they got married. In 2010, the couple was blessed with a son but four years later, they announced their separation after being together for 21 years and married almost nine. In March 2015, their divorce became official."
