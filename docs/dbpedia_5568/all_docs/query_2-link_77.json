        "text": "He had been trying to turn Jamie against John, Kayce (Luke Grimes) and Beth Dutton (Kelly Reilly) as soon as he was back on the scene.\n\nJamie later found out that it was actually his dad who was behind the dramatic assassination attempts on all three of them at the end of the third season.\n\nHe was determined to keep this a secret from his family so Jamie chose to say nothing.\n\nBut unfortunately for him, Beth found out the truth and she wanted answers.\n\nSince leaving Yellowstone, Patton has been working on other projects.\n\nHe will feature in the upcoming 1920s drama You Can't Win as Foot and A Half George.\n\nPatton is also going to be in the upcoming Western mystery drama Outer Range which is currently in post-production.\n\nYellowstone is available to watch on Paramount Network in America. A UK release date for season 4 has not yet been announced."
