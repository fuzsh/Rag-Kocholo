        "text": "Patton History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nScotland\n\nIreland\n\nThe surname Patton is a Scottish patronymic surname, derived from the name \"Pat,\" a diminutive of Patrick. The Patton family initially lived at the manor of Patton in the English county of Cumberland before moving north to Scotland. In Ayrshire, the name is pronounced Pauton. 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Patton family\n\nThe surname Patton was first found in Cumberland (Cumbria) where the name \"was the favourite Border form, and remains a Scottish surname today.\" 2\n\nPaton with no forename was recorded in the Subsidy Rolls for Cumberland in 1332. As a forename we found Patone de Hangaldsyde in 1467. In 1230, Northumberland records show Hugo Patun and later, James Patoun was found in the Hundredorum Rolls for Bedfordshire in 1279. 3\n\nBack in Scotland, \"Paton is said to have been the name of a son of Sir Patrick Herring (fourteenth century). Royal pardons were granted to Paten Broune alias Broun and to the servant of Patein or Pateman Broin, 1407. Patone de Hangald-syde (1467) appears again in 1469 as Patrick Hangangside. Three persons named Pawton were voters in the parish of Qwilton (Coylton), 1513, and James Padyne, witness, 1514.\" 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Patton family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Patton research.

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Virtute adepta\n\nMotto Translation: Acquired by virtue\n\nSuggested Readings for the name Patton +\n\nDescendants of Isaac Patten, Sr., and his Wife, Jane Norris: An Early Pioneer Family in Sullivan County, Indiana by Ernest C.
