        "text": "Like many families, The Pattons have moved to Parkland from somewhere else. Having just arrived a month ago from Haddon Heights, New Jersey, Sue, Sean and their three children, Molly, 12, Ryan, 8 and Sean, 3, are soaking up the Florida sun. “We had to relocate for Sean’s job in Risk Management,” Sue says. “We love the warm weather and the whole Florida experience. The beach is a big thing for us.” Molly is in the 7th grade at Westglades Middle School. Her favorite subject is reading and when she’s not studying, she loves to go shopping. Ryan plays in the Parkland Flag Football league and attends the 3rd grade at Park Trails Elementary. He likes Math and spends time with his friends…you guessed it… playing football. Sean is an energetic boy with an electric smile and a very quick wit. Adopted from South Korea at the age of 1, his given name was Seon, which all of the Pattons felt was “meant to be.” The Pattons enjoy taking walks together with their English bulldog, Piper, and going to the beach every weekend. “I love that it’s just a 20-30 minute ride to the beach,” says Sue. “We also go to Ryan’s flag football games and are hoping to find a swim team for both Ryan and Molly.” Sue, a homemaker, enjoys riding her bike with Sean (the boy) in the trailer behind her. Sean (the dad) and Sue like finding different varieties of restaurants to enjoy. In all of their exploring, they’ve definitely seen that we have a lot to choose from. Welcome to the neighborhood"
