The expedition reached the Falls of Ohio on May 27, 1778, and landed on Corn Island. Captain Patton did not accompany the soldiers to the Illinois country, but remained on the island under orders from General Clark, to care for the stores landed there & to protect the families of the soldiers who were with the expedition. The duty was difficult, but he was successful in providing for the garrison. In 1779, following General Clark's return, the families on Corn Island decided to move to the mainland & called a meeting of the Falls inhabitants who appointed a 7-man committee to plan & establish a town. James Patton was one of the seven. The town was incorporated as \"Louisville\". James Patton was appointed as one of the Louisville trustees several times. Later when the town was incorporated as part of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, James was elected trustee of the city several times.\n\nHis military record shows him in 1779 in Bowman's march on the Indian towns of Ohio. In 1780, he was with Capt. William Harrod, then stationed at the Falls of Ohio. He served with General Clark in 1780 on the expedition against the Ohio Indians to avenge the attacks by upon Martin's and Ruddle's stations. In 1782, he again served with General Clark on an expedition to avenge the \"Blue Licks\" Massacre.\n\nJames Patton held large amounts of land, both in the city of Louisville & the surroundint country. Most of his holdings were purchased with the funds received from the sale of his VA holdings.\n\nHe was a member of \"The Society of Cincinnati\" an organization formed by George Washington and his military associates in 1783, for the purpose of promoting friendship, of cherishing the memories of mutual hardships, and of aiding members and thier families in case of need. Membership was made hereditary and has descended only through \"eldest sons\".\n\nJames Patton owned a half acre lot on 8th Street between Main and the river. The land was heavily timbered. A giant Sycamore grew on the lot which was hollow at the roots. The hollow was as large as a small room of a house, so James Patton built a log cabin around the tree, using the hollow as one of the rooms. He occupied this cabin & hollow tree until danger from the Indians was gone from the Falls. At that time, he built a large, double stone house upon the site where he lived until the time of his death. On top of the house, he built a cupola with a view of the Falls. He was so familiar with the rapids that he was considered the most skillful person to conduct a boat through them. This was considered a difficult and dangerous task and the Legislature in 1798, passed an act creating the Office of \"Falls Pilot\". James Patton was the first to hold the office, remaining in it until his death.\n\nFather: John PATTON b: Abt 1689 in Newton-Limavady, Derry, Ireland Mother: ROGERS b: in Of Ireland\n\nMarriage 1 Mary DAUGHERTY b: Abt 1750 Children Martha \"Patsy\" PATTON Margaret \"Peggy\" PATTON Mary \"Polly\" PATTON\n\nMarriage 2 Elizabeth Married: 14 Jun 1792 Children PATTON\n\nMarriage 3 Phoebe b: 27 Apr 1782 Children PATTON\n\nNote: American Revolution.

Morgan\n\nChapter One Captain GEORGE BARBER p. 1 - 10\n\nThe parents of Captain George Barber were George and Elizabeth Barber of Augusta County, Virginia. The elder George died 1750 in that colony, and one of the appraisers of his estate in Augusta County was Robert Williams, the uncle of Margaret Watkins, Margaret later to become the bride of Capt. George Barber. Elizabeth, widow of the elder George Barber, married a man by the name of Patton in May of 1751 on Craig's Creek. Robert Watkins (Father of Margaret), the elder George Barber, and Matthew Patton all lived near each other on Craig's Creek in 1745.[1]1\n\nMatthew Patton was the step-father of Capt. George Barber. He lived next to the Watkins family in Johnston County, North Carolina in 1767, and lived next to Capt. George Barber and Reese Watkins in Wilkes County, Georgia. Matthew Patton died in Wilkes County, Georgia in 1806, and two of the executors of his will were Capt. George Barber and Christopher Orr. Matthew Patton had been a witness to the will of Christopher's father, Robert Orr, in Johnston County, North Carolina in 1779.[2]2 This same Christopher had married Martha, the daughter of Reese Watkins. Reese Watkins was the older brother of Margaret Watkins.[3]3\n\nGeorge Barber was born about 1743, probably in Augusta County, Virginia. He had an older brother named [4]Plier. George married Margaret Watkins in December 1766 or early 1767. This date is determined because Margaret signed a deed in Bedford County, Virginia, 6 November 1766, as Margaret Watkins.[5]4 Also their oldest son, William Barber, served in the American Revolution.[6]5\n\nMargaret Watkins was born about 1743 in Chester County, Pennsylvania, the youngest child and only daughter of Robert Watkins and his wife Margaret, and the only granddaughter of Cadawalader Watkins, who immigrated to America from Wales before 1704. The descendants of Cadawalader Watkins have been traced in the book Reese Kelso Watkins, his Ancestry and his Descendants, by Frank B. Russell, 1973.\n\nCHRONICLES OF THE SCOTCH-IRISH SETTLEMENT OF VIRGINIA; Vol 2, pp 390 - 399 Eliz.
