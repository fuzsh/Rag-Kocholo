        "text": "ABOUT\n\nIn 2012, the Patton Family gifted the 28 acre parcel and historic home to The Town of Hamilton. The Patton Homestead was home to the Patton family starting in 1928, and it was notably home to the great General George S.

Patton (1923-2004) along with his wife Joanne Holbrook Patton (1931- 2023).\n\nOn the farm once known as Green Meadows, George and Joanne raised five children and made a lasting impression on their country and local community. They are of course world renown for heroic military contributions over the course of several generations, but it was through Joanne’s dedication to the Hamilton-Wenham community and involvement in a multitude of civic endeavors, that the family is beloved by the Town.\n\nNow that the Patton Homestead is owned and operated by the Town of Hamilton, the grounds are open to the public. People are encouraged to come for recreation, positive community engagement and to host inclusive gatherings for all.\n\nClick here for a Virtual Tour\n\nFree parking is available in the gravel lot.\n\nHolly Erickson, Director\n\nNow working for the Hamilton-Wenham Recreation Department, Holly manages public offerings, as well as private event inquiries.
