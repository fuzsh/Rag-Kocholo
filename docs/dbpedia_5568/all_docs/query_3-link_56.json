Editing or republishing it requires permission from the copyright holder.\n\nThis family history was donated by Joan Benson, great granddaughter of David and Matilda Patton, during a Digitization Days event held at the Paris branch of the County of Brant Public Library on November 14, 2009. For more information, contact the Library at (519) 442-2433.\n\nThis history of the descendants of David Patton and Matilda Killips was written by their youngest son, David Patton, on June 27th, 1940.\n\nAn asterisk * next to a person's name indicates that they were still living at the time that this history was written.\n\nIntroduction: David Patton, Matilda Killips\n\nFamily of David Paaton 1824-1904, fourth son of Thomas Patton and Elizabeth Greenfield of County Down, Ireland, and Matilda Killips, 1825-1894, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John Killips of County Antrim, Ireland, who were married in the Rosemary St. Church, Belfast, Ireland, by the Reverend C.I. McAllister, June 11,1851.\n\nThis sketch written by the youngest member of the family of these good Irish parents in April, 1940 is being revised this 27th day of June 1940, and may require further revision should reliable details of past events come into my possession.\n\nMy grandparents, Thomas and Elizabeth Patton with perhaps half of their family of twelve came to Canada about 1834, settling in Ancaster, Canada West, but later moved further west and purchased a farm property midway between Paris and Ayr in the Township of South Dumfries, County of Brant. This farm was the birthplace of the younger members of their family and is known by the Patton clan as \"Marshview”.\n\nMy father, David Patton was probably a ten years old boy when he tried rolling down the Ancaster hills inside a barrel! Probably his parents decided that South Dumfries might be a safer place to raise a family, and my father, after receiving a schooling in the “Three R'S\", was apprenticed with a painter named Craig In Galt. In ’48 or ’49 he nearly lost his life by receiving a terrible scalding by hot oil. Before his recovery was sufficient to resume work, he took a trip to the old country, and fell an easy victim to the charms of his cousin, the vivacious Matilda Killips, who was brave enough to share with him a six weeks passage on a sailing vessel. They took up residence in Paris where three children were born. About_1866, the railways were built throughout this district, and father did many painting jobs by contract employing a number of men on new houses, and also railway buildings and Bridges . A short distance north of the point where the Great Western R.R. was crossed by the Buffalo and Lake Huron branch of the Grand Trunk R.R. park lots were surveyed. On a newly laid out \"Oak Avenue\", Father and Mother became the owners of two lots, and on this property, they erected a cobble stone house, having many of the beautiful and characteristic appointments and peculiarities of Old Country homes, planted orchard, fruit and ornamental trees and shrubs, garden, berries etc. etc. There was a small barn, a horse; cow, pigs and poultry, the latter three were mother's especial care. They bought two more lots, thus making a property of about 8 acres. By uniting their family names, Killips and Patton, they named this property, \"Kilton Cottage\", and for over forty years, it was the beloved HOME of the Patton family, and will be fondly remembered as long as the many friends and relatives, who, throughout the years enjoyed its wide hospitality are possession of life and love.\n\nPerhaps about 1863, father gave up contract painting and opened a Hardware Store adjoining Whitlaw’s Flour Mill, River St. Paris. He carried a full stock of shelf hardware, garden and farm tools, paints, oils, varnishes, glass, putty, wallpaper, etc. etc. and did custom painting and glazing in a shop upstairs. He took his youngest brother, James, as partner, forming the firm of Patton Bros. Hardware, continuing until the big Paris fire of 1900.\n\nDuring his latter years, he held a controlling interest in the Brantford and Paris Plank and Gravel Toll Road, which in Nov.9th 1918 was taken over by the government and forms a part of Provincial Highway No.2.\n\nMargaret Matilda\n\n1.

His marriage with Edith I. Smith of Stratford, Ontario, took place, Oct. 13, 1888. Their home WAS a happy gathering place for many of the residents of Minnedosa. After a time they decided to move to Vancouver, B.C. which proved a somewhat unsatisfactory venture. For several years they lived in Toronto, where the growing family had much better educational opportunities, but their dear mother's sudden death, April 20, 1913 was an irreparable loss. John's sister Anna endeavored to fill the gap for a considerable time and was there when the Great War of 1914-1918 called all three boys to the colors. Later, John married again a widow Mrs. May Pabst. A son, John, born to them probably in 1918, but I have no definite knowledge of either mother or son at present. John K.

For a time he held a position in the Provincial college at Edmonton but most of his professional work has bean done in Michigan State College, East Lansing. Yet his mind constantly reverts to the western Canadian wheat fields and to Wheat as an economic factor. Marguerite too, who possesses an almost uncanny mastery of values and figures has been repeatedly called upon as a capable government executive. They have a beautiful and commodious home, 926 University Drive, East Lansing, Michigan. Both have done somewhat extensive and observant travelling, and both are applying their wide knowledge of various subjects and conditions for the welfare of the nation or better still, the nations.\n\nDavid Clair\n\nB. David Clair* At Minnedosa, Manitoba, Nov. 20, 1890. Probably the best loved, most genial, originally witty and clever member of the Clan Patton. Gained a pretty good business training with the Dunlop Tire Co. Hamilton. Married Marion W. McCosh of Paris Ont. Oct. 13, 1913.

For several years, he has held a position on the executive staff of \"Sangamo\" manufacturers of electric fittings and appliances, in the Toronto branch of that company, whose headquarters are in Springfield, Illinois. Clair, like most of the clan, loves outside air and natural beauty and, in the fairly extensive setting of their wonder¬ful house at Islington, he has developed his natural love of flowers, until it has become a veritable and pleasing hobby, Especially in the culture of roses, both Clair and Marion are enthusiastically successful. Clair has become recognised as something of an authority on Roses, and his services on the executive of the Ontario Rose Society has been rewarded by his appointment to the President of that Society for this year, 1940. Today's Globe and Mail (June 28th) told of his success at this season's Annual Rose Show of the Ontario Society. One of his entries was judged to be \"Best Rose in the Exhibition”.\n\nJohn David McCosh\n\nB-l In Hamilton, Ont, John David McCosh* Jan. 9, 1915.

This pair enjoy and inspire considerable fame in both in their Islington home, and in their mother’s native town of Paris, where they are frequent visitors. We have every reason to expect good things from both of them. Margaret is said to be a replica of her grandmother Edith. She expects to graduate from High School this term. Norman, we are told, is, since the declaration of war, becoming somewhat careless about his studies and is anxious to attain the age of 18 (next September) so that he may join up with the armed forces of Canada and the Empire. He sure knows how to handle a rifle. He was named after his uncle, Norman Edwin Greenfield, who went overseas never to return.\n\nNorman Edwin Greenfield\n\nC. Norman Edwin Greenfield.

Never very strong physically, yet very capable of noting and attending to the one hundred and one details. About 1885 or 7 she spent a year or more with Joh K. in Minnedosa, Manitoba. A trip to Ireland probably about 1910 was an outstanding event in her life. Mother’s death occurred August 27, 1894 and about four years later, Father decided to sell the Kilton property, and with Bessie and Anna took up residence in Paris until the time of his death Oct. 12, 1904. The two girls moved to another house on River St. where Bessie’s sudden death occurred Feb 19, 1908. Anna lived or boarded or kept rooms of her own or did as health permitted, but was in Toronto with John and Edith at the time of the latter’s sudden death. Anna remained with John and his a family, filling in with an admirable devotion. Daring that time all three of John’s boys went overseas to take part in the Great War. After John's second marriage, Anna went to London, Ont. for a time, eventually returning to Paris, living for a time with Tom and Maggie Helliker and for a time with as at \"Farmhill\" and has had a variety of lodgings, where she could find crowded space for the few antiquated, yet, to her, extremely precious articles which served as reminders of our dear old Kilton home. At prevent sha is boarding in a house on Banfield St. a short distance from our home where she is always a welcone visitor.\n\nDavid\n\n7. David*\n\nAt Kilton Cottage, South Dumfries May 16, 1886. Leaving school at 15, I entered an office of a woolen mill in Paris, but preferred outside work and for three years assisted father and Tom in the Farmhill enterprise. Early in 1937(?) caught the Manitoba fever, and, forming a partner¬ship with another young fellow, famed for six years near Minnedosa, Manitoba.\n\nLost- six years of the best of my young manhood -\n\nLost- All my bit of money savings -\n\nLost- A big chunk of superfluous conceit -\n\nGained- some dearly bought experience -\n\nGained- An inadequate and lop-sided education by long winter night reading and study -\n\nGained - a life-time sweetheart by long continued long-distance correspondence with a girl of my schoolboy fancy.\n\nGained - a few loyal friendships which are still in evidence as the Christmas season comes each year.\n\nGained a great and abiding love for this part of Western Ontario. Its marvellous natural beauty enhanced by good soil and a sane system of agriculture, also tasteful methods of horticulture.\n\nMarried Jane McNaughton Telfer* of South Dumfries Twp. April 8, 1893. In the spring of 1898, we took over the Farmhill property, extremely difficult undertaking in our circumstances. In 1902, after Janey's father Wm. Telfer died, his youngest daughter, Janey's sister Margaret Ellen came to share our home. In 1910 Duncan A. Telfer* Janey’s brother lost his wife. There wore left a family of two boys and two girls. We assumed considerable responsibility regarding two of these, and full responsibility for Elisabeth* their two year old. All four are now married and all have families excepting the oldest boy, Lorne A.* of Toronto.\n\nAfter leaving school, 4 our dear little, bright little girl, Elizabeth, got a job of book-keeping with the Henderson Coal Co., Paris Station. Later she was with a wholesale Coal Business in London, and again evidently still in love with the \"dusky diamonds\", with the Sibbick Coal and Wood business, Paris.\n\nOn October 24, 1936, she was married at our present home, 63 Banfield St., Paris to Paul Giles Pettit*, fruitgrower, of Fruitland, Ont. On March 11th a son, Cecil Telfer* was born to them, and we receive satisfactory reports of his growth and development.\n\nIn October of 1926, I suffered a physical and nervous breakdown, and after being laid up nearly all winter, I realized that I was unable to carry on with the spring work. Held a successful sale of livestock and implements, but failed to obtain the price I desired for the farm, so leased it to a neighbor. In October 1926, I found a satisfactory buyer for Farmhlll, Thomas Woods, Belwood, who with his family is capably managing the property.\n\nLast year Farmhill won First Prize in a competition over a wide area, as the farm showing the most improvements.\n\nIn December 1926, we moved into the house which we now occupy. Though out thoughts and affections still cling to Kilton and Farmhill, we have the great satisfaction of knowing that both properties have passed into exceptionally capable hands.\n\nIn July 1926, at Gimsby, Ont. Oscar Pettit, the husband of Janey’s sister, Elizabeth* died. There were three sons left, all married, with little homes and small families of their own, and so it came to pass that with the exception of a year spent with her eldest son, Harry, in Saskatchewan (he and his pioneering family are now in the Peace River District) and periodic visitations with her Grimsby friends and relatives, Elizabeth Pettit has had her home with us. I sometimes jokingly say that “I married the best of Wm. Telfer’s three daughters but eventually got possession of all three of them.”\n\nLooking back over everything, I think how fortunate we were that Father and Mother were spared to us until we grew up, married, and had homes of our own. Many times I think of, and marvel at, their their wonderful courage, their thrift, their loving care and providences, their genial hospitality, their admirable sense of humor, their abounding generosity, their Christian teaching, practice and example, their love of everything beautiful, their continuous united industry.\n\nFirst, last and best of all, we rejoice in the memories of the happy, comfortable, and beautiful HOME we enjoyed together.-Kilton Cottage\n\nI close with this loving tribute to my devoted wife, Jane McNauhton Patton,\n\nDAVID PATTON."
