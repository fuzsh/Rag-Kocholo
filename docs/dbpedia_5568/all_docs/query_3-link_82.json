See notes at the end.\n\nGeorge Patton\n\nby Caster D. Patton\n\nPatton and his wife, Nancy (Woods) Patton, moved from Orange County, N.C. to the Upper Sequatchie Valley now the southern edge of Cumberland County, Tenn. between 1835 and 1840. His parents were thought to be Alexander and Levinia (Myrack) Patton. Alexander was in the War of 1812 with the 2nd Reg. of Orange County, N.C. Nancy was the daughter of Matthew and Peggy (Faucette) Woods, also of Orange County, N.C. Matthew was a captain from N.C. in the Revolutionary War.\n\nHymelus, who considered himself Cherokee Indian, and his oldest son, William or “Billy”, moved to Mill Springs, Ky. a short time after they both enlisted in the Union Army in September 1861. According to Billy Patton’s son, Jesse, this move was made for the safety of the women after a threat was made on the life of Jesse’s mother. he also stated that they had been in Mill Springs only a few days when he heard the guns roar from the Battle of Mill Springs. Hymlus, who was fifty-six years old when he enlisted in September 1861, died at Cumberland Gap on August 10, 1862.\n\nAfter the Civil War was over, William and Rebecca Jane (Scott) Patton moved to Fentress County and lived in the Wolf River and Forbus Areas. William was born in N.C. in the 18209 and died in 1919. His wife, Jane, was born in Tenn. on October 27, 1821 and died April 12, 1885. Their son, Jesse Patton, was born in 1851 and died in 1947. Jesse was a farmer and had some success drilling for oil on the Little South Fork where he then lived in Wayne County, Ky. He later lived and farmed for many years on the “Old Davey Delk Place” which is on the Middle Fork of Wolf River, usually called “Little Jack” Creek. Jesse and Melvina Jane (Crabtree) Patton were the parents of George W. Patton who was born June 10, 1894, near Mt. Pisgah, Ky. on the “Little South Fork”.\n\nJesse permitted his son, George, to start learning the Oil Rig Drilling Trade as a boy of thirteen. The two of them were to handle the Drillers Helper’s Job or ‘Tool Dresser”. Of course, as Jesses had planned, he turned the job over to his son on the second shift worked, telling him he would make a good “Tool Dresser”, which he did. George went on to learn the Driller’s Job and worked for some time in Kentucky, Tennessee, and for a short time in Lawrenceville, Illinois as a Driller. He also was a farmer and did various other types of work. What he probably did best, at least liked best was Square Dancing. In fact, when he was about sixty-five years of age, he finished second in the State of Tennessee “Buck & Wing” Dancing Competition at Nashville.\n\nGeorge married Edna Pearl (Green) Patton, January 16, 1916. Probably the most difficult task they faced was caring for and raising their thirteen children who were: Jennie, Melvin, Caster, Roxie, Ruby, John, Herbert, Glenn, Noble, Louise, Peggy, Lois and Douglas. Jennie, who married Ralph Cargile, died in 1954. They had three children: Wayne, Willard and Virginia. The other twelve Patton Children are still living in 1986. Details of the Military Service of six of George and Pearl’s sons and five of their daughters’ husbands may be found in The Warriors, by John Patton. A copy of this publication is in the Fentress County Library.\n\nSource: https://homepages.rootsweb.com/~bp2000/fentress/f403.htm\n\nJesse and Melvina Jane Patton\n\nby Lorene Cargile\n\nJesse Patton was born April 15, 1851.

Ida and Jesse had two children, Procter (Monk) (May 4, 1898 1985-6) and Samuel Young (January 3, 1900 – April 21, 1900).\n\nJesse’s family moved to the Wolf River area shortly after the Civil War but moat of his later years he lived in Wayne County, Kentucky near Monticello. He died February 17, 1947 and is buried at Monticello, Kentucky.\n\nThe information for this story was furnished by Lois Patton Crouch, a granddaughter of Jesse Patton. She has done many hours of research on the Pattons as well as the Greens and Fites.\n\nSource: https://homepages.rootsweb.com/~bp2000/fentress/f404.htm\n\nPearl (Green) Patton\n\nby Cater D.

Her parents, Peter and Sarah (Chapman) Green, informed the young couple that if they were intent on marriage the ceremony could be performed in their home, and sent one of her younger brothers to “fetch” the minister who had also performed the marriage ceremony for them. Adah Green, her younger sister, supplies most of this type of information. Her brothers were: Mack, who died while in the U.S. Army, at Camp Gordon, Georgia, in November 1916, Fate, Hyram and Hewey, who died while a young man.\n\nPearl’s grandparents were: Newton and Sarah (Fite) Green and John and Mendy Jane (Scroggins) Chapman.

The 1820 Census shows William Green in Overton County. Thomas Pritchard is listed in the 1830 Census in Fentress County. It is believed they both came from North Carolina soon after 1800. Leonard and Winny (West) Fite left Rowan County, N.C. around 1820, moving to Overton County, Tennessee. Leonard died on the way in Knox County, Tennessee. Their son, Peter, was twelve years old at the time. Young Peter related stories of passing through Jamestown and Wolf River on their way to Overton County. James and Sarah (Stewart) Matthews probably were from North Carolina, but may have lived in East Tennessee before moving to Overton County. James Matthews died in the War of 1812, on November 9, 1813, in the Battle of Talladega, in Alabama, where Gen. Andrew Jackson defeated the Creek Indians with a loss of only fifteen men. The first names of Dark Chapman’s parents are not known to the writer. His mother may have been a daughter of John Dark, who lived in North Georgia where Dark was born, as well as the Chapmans, Abner, John and William, all of whom were in the Revolutionary War.\n\nGabriel and Sarah Morgen were both born in South Carolina, but lived in Polk County, Tennessee. Samuel and Pheriba (Gwinn) Scroggins lived near Grimsley in Fentress County. He was a surveyor for the U.S. Government and they traveled to Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and finally moved to Boyd, Texas, where he died. Pheriba lived to be 105 years old. John, their son, was with “Tinker” David Beaty’s Independent Scouts during the Civil War. John and Anna (Mullinex) Pulse lived below the “Stoke” West Farm on Lower Wolf River; he ran a “Grist” Mill there. Anna died 1&15-50, leaving small children who may have moved to Texas with the Scroggins and older Pulse Children. John, who was born in 1788, died in 1876. He was in the War of 1812.\n\nPearl’s Great Great Great Grandparents were: Peter and Anna Barbara (Summers) Fite, from Pennsylvania and New Jersey to Rowan County, N.C. He was in the Revolutionary War. Joseph and Sarah (Gilbert) Stewart lived in Chatham County, N.C. He was in the Revolutionary War. Robert and Narcissa (Mills) Scroggin lived in Bourbon County, Ky. Robert was a member of the Kentucky Legislature. His father, Samuel Scroggin, was a lieutenant in the Revolutionary War from Delaware. Her father, John Mills, was a captain in the Revolutionary War from Virginia. He was born in Ireland. John and Jane Gwinn came to Fentress County in the 1820s. He ran a Tar Camp in 1826 at Laurel Branch, north of Jamestown. Fredrick and Esther (Woods) Pulse lived in Virginia. It is not known if they ever lived in Tennessee. Eli and Sarah (Dykes) Mullinex moved from East Tennessee to Kentucky and then to Fentress County around 1800. His parents, Richard and Elizabeth (Poynter) Mullinex were probably from Maryland, but lived in East Tennessee before coming to Fentress County. Her parents, William and Sarah (Haley) Dykes lived in Hawkins, County, Tenn. near the Mullinex Family in Green County. William Dykes was in the Revolutionary War.\n\nThree sons of Peter Vogt immigrated from Hesse, Kessel, Germany to Pennsylvania in 1749. They were John, Hens, and Heinrich. They anglicized their name, Vogt, to Fite. John married Catherina Pfeiffer, said to have had all her property confiscated in Germany for entering the United States illegally. Pearl (Green) Patton and her thirteen children are among their many descendants.\n\nby Caster D. Patton\n\nTranscriber’s note: Most, but not all, [transcribed] excerpts relate to Beaty families. Don’t forget the first rule of genealogy — everything should be backed by primary documentation — This book was written by the Fentress Co. Historical Society. It’s mainly a collection of personal histories told from memory and family tradition with little documentation, and should be taken as such.\n\nTNGenWeb Coordinator’s note: Curtis Media Corp. gave permission to post this material originally, and it was uploaded in a free account at Rootsweb.
