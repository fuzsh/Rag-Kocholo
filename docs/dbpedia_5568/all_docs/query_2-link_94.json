        "text": "Will Patton is one of those great character actors that we don’t see enough these days. So, it’s nice to see that he stars in an upcoming crime-thriller titled Hammer.\n\nPatton plays a father in the story who faces “a personal crisis when he discovers his estranged son fleeing a botched drug deal. The two men embark on a violent odyssey that grapples with themes of fatherhood, family and fate.”\n\nThis actually looks like it could be a solid movie. It was directed by Christian Sparkes, and it also stars Mark O'Brien, Ben Cotton, Dayle McLeod, Lara Jean Chorostecki, Connor Price, and Curtis Caravaggio.\n\nVertical Entertainment will release Hammer direct-to-VOD on June 5th."
