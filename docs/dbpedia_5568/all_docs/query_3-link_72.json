        "text": "Rayne writes:\n\nAfter seeing the movie Young Adult starring Patton Oswalt, I wonder why the name Patton isn’t going gangbusters for little boys. It starts with the letter P and ends -on which seems current and it’s extremely masculine. It’s a last name as first name, like Parker. It seems like parents of boys that like Peyton might use Patton for a less unisex name. What do you think?\n\nThe associations that come to my mind:\n\n1. War/military, because of General Patton.\n\n2. Patton Oswalt.\n\n3. Sounds like the word “patent.”\n\n4. Sounds like “pattin'”.\n\nWhen I was checking online to make sure I was remembering right about General Patton (history has always been my worst subject), I found an entire page dedicated to various Pattons, so there are likely to be lots of other associations—a good thing, since it often means the associations are diluted and don’t overwhelm the name.\n\nI see it was used for 45 boys and 5 girls in 2010. That’s up a bit for boys since 2009, when it was used for 32 boys and 5 girls. In fact, let’s look at a longer stretch. Each year will be followed by the number of male babies given the name, then the number of female babies (the Social Security database contains information only if the name is used for at least 5 babies of that sex that year):\n\n2010: 45 males, 5 females\n\n2009: 32 males, 5 females\n\n2008: 28 males, 7 females\n\n2007: 27 males, 7 females\n\n2006: 28 males, fewer than 5 females\n\n2005: 37 males, fewer than 5 females\n\n2004: 20 males, 6 females\n\n2003: 31 males, fewer than 5 females\n\n2002: 16 males, 5 females\n\n2001: 24 males, fewer than 5 females\n\n2000: 15 males, fewer than 5 females\n\n1999: 17 males, fewer than 5 females\n\n1998: 14 males, fewer than 5 females\n\n1997: 15 males, fewer than 5 females\n\nSo it looks like it is gradually getting more popular for boys and for girls, but so gradually and at such a low rate of use, it barely shows up.\n\nLet’s have a poll over to the right [poll closed; see results below] to see what everyone thinks of it; and in the comments section we can discuss what we do/don’t like about it, and maybe speculate about why it isn’t more widely used.\n\nPoll results for “What do you think of the name Patton?” (359 votes total):\n\nI love it! I’d want to use it! – 15 votes (4%)\n\nI like it! I’d want to consider it! – 55 votes (15%)\n\nI like it for someone else’s baby – 135 votes (38%)\n\nNo particular opinion – 43 votes (12%)\n\nSlight dislike – 91 votes (25%)\n\nStrong dislike – 20 votes (6%)"
