        "text": "We are your family, answering your post about William Delany Patton.We can tell you anything you would like to know about him and his family. He was my gggf and I have been researching him for 25 years. He was quite the character. I have amassed a huge amount of documents on him and I have gathered together a group of researchers who are also related to William. We have our family trees online.\n\nWillliam Delany Patton was born Dec 11, 1810 in Shelby county, KY to parents William Patton and Anna Redmond. His father William was born July 12, 1765 in County Down, Ireland (16 miles from Belfast) who came to the US in 1806. His mother Anna was born Oct 4, 1784 in Shelby county, KY. She was an original Pioneer to the territory. They were married June 28, 1807 in Shelby county, KY.\n\nThey had 7 children:\n\nMary Ann born 1809 Shelby county, KY m Charles Frisbee\n\nWilliam Delany Patton b 1810\n\nThen they moved to Ohio county, WV in 1813\n\nGeorge Washington Patton b @1813 Ohio, WV m Susan Allison\n\nJames Christopher Columbus Patton b @1815 Ohio, WV 3 wives\n\nSamuel Franklin Patton b @1818 Ohio, WV m Mary Deatherage\n\nHenrietta Patton b @1820\n\nThomas Jefferson Patton b 1822 m Lucy Gee (was a legislator for the state of AR in the 1880's)\n\nThe Patton's lived 1.5 miles from monument place Ohio, WV from 1813 until 1828\n\nThen they moved to Edgar county, IL (except for William D Patton)\n\nWilliam Patton from Ireland (father) died in Edgar county, IL Feb 21, 1843.\n\nWilliam Delany Patton moved to Monroe county, OH in 1828 to live near his uncle James Patton's family in Sardis after spending 4 years in Wheeling learning to be a blacksmith. He met and married Margaret Ann McClelland b Jan 18, 1806 in PA. I believe she was born in Washington county, PA. She was the daughter of David McClelland but was orphaned by 1828 and living in Monroe county, OH. She was married to Wm D Patton Dec 9, 1828.\n\nTheir first son was George Washington Patton b Sep 27, 1829 in Woodsfield, Monroe, OH. He was 6'4\" and red headed. He was Deputy sheriff in Monroe county when his dad was sheriff in the 1840's. He also owned some land in Sardis which he sold to his cousin Margaret Patton July 1st, 1853.\n\nWilliam Delany Patton and Margaret (wife #1) had 10 children together. Although they moved to Edgar county, IL between 1832 and 1838 where 3 of their children were born, they lived most of their marriage in Monroe county, OH.\n\nMargaret (wife #1) died Apr 13, 1853 in Woodsfield, followed by her daughter Louisiana a year later... both from TB which they got from the minister of the new church they both had joined around 1850. Margaret was the love of William D Patton's life. (aka: Billy D Patton and wife Maggie). He adored her. When she died, he became a different person. He stopped working, stopped caring and became a lothario. Wife #2, Elizabeth Mary Frazier (widow of Louis Oliver) had 5 children with William D Patton before she also died 9 years later.\n\nWilliam Delany Patton had 5 wives and 18 children. The last 4 wives were all widows. Wife #4 had the last 3 of his 18 children.\n\nHe was married to the last 3 wives at the same time when he died of uremic poisoning on Dec 1, 1883. All 3 widows filed for widows pension. His Civil war pension records are about 300 pages of affidavits while the gov't investigated the wives. I can tell you tons of info about him and his life and wives and kids and careers and civil war... you name it. I even have an etching of him.\n\nHis son George W Patton married Mary Ann Robinson on Oct 24 1855 in Monroe, OH. Mary Ann was born Aug 29, 1838 in PA. George followed his father into the Civil war, Ohio 77th Volunteer infantry (company B, I think. His father was in company I). George was very devoted to his father and was always by his father's side. George and Mary Ann moved to Moundsville, WV when his father did the same. George's brother Thomas Jefferson also moved nearby. TB was very bad in the WV area because of the coal mines and denser population. TB plagued both George's and Thomas's families and the mortality of their children. I have 11 children listed for George, many died as infants. Same with his brother's family. A third brother, David Delany Patton, lived with his family near their old family home in Ohio county, WV... just up the river from Moundsville, Marshall county, WV.\n\nGeorge died in Moundsville Jan 30 1903. Mary Ann died Oct 10, 1890 in Moundsville, WV. I have photos of their graves. George's father William Delany Patton is buried with George and his family.\n\nGeorge's brother Thomas Jefferson Patton and his family are buried about 50 ft away in the same cemetery. I also have photos of their graves.\n\nWilliam Delany Patton's siblings and mother moved to Andrew county, MO after the father died in Edgar county, IL in 1843. Their mother Anna Redmond (aka: Redmon) died in Andrew county, MO shortly after 1850. Siblings George & Samuel Patton and sister Mary Patton's husband Charles Frisbee all died around that same timeframe.\n\nIn 1860, the surviving siblings were living in Gentry county, MO. After the Civil war, WD's brother's Thomas Jefferson Patton and James CC Patton moved to Washington county, AR. They remained in AR until their deaths. Thomas Jefferson Patton had also lived in Benton county, AR after his daughters all graduated from college.\n\nI have tons of info and stories on our Patton family as do our other researchers who are related to our Patton family. We never get tired of researching our Pattons. I have extensive biographies I have written on them. William Delany Patton also wrote his own small autobiography as did his brother Thomas J.\n\nWe would be delighted to have more Patton family members join us. We have all kinds of info, documents and stories you would enjoy including stories about his father's life in Ireland. Hundreds of pages of documents... as well as important medical information on medical problems which have plagued our Patton family all the way back to Ireland to present day. I have extensive medical records on William D Patton and his granddaughter as well as some of his sons.\n\nWe would love to find photos on the family. Since George was his most devoted, favorite son, perhaps he had some family photos? It is something that the rest of us do not have.\n\nWe are also trying to find a surviving male with the Patton surname for Y chromosome DNA testing for tracing family history. Perhaps one of George's male descendants with the Patton surname survived?\n\nWe will be delighted to hear from any other Patton family members and have you join our small group and exhange info and stories about the family.\n\nJust post another message here and we will see it to contact you."
