        "text": "Viewers clearly love “Yellowstone,” the contemporary Western starring Kevin Costner as John Dutton, patriarch of a Montana ranching family. The recently concluded Season 4 of “Yellowstone” set ratings records, with the season finale drawing a series high of more than 9 million viewers. As Deadline reports, that number was up more than 80 percent from the Season 3 finale.\n\nDespite fan loyalty, the Paramount Network show has never inspired the kind of critical adoration lavished on such series as “Succession,” and you’d be hard-pressed to find “Yellowstone” turning up on Ten 10 best lists. “Yellowstone” has also largely been overlooked when it comes to awards, unless you consider its one (so far) Emmy nomination, for production design, to be a major accolade.\n\n• You can watch Season 4 of “Yellowstone” on Philo, which offers a free trial, and also stream it on fubo TV, which also offers a free trial. Here’s how to watch past seasons of “Yellowstone” on NBC’s Peacock streaming service.\n\nBut this week, the Screen Actors Guild rode to the rescue. The 2022 SAG nominations, announced on Wednesday, included the cast of “Yellowstone” being nominated for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series, the most prestigious TV drama category.\n\nThe SAG Awards are voted on by members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA). Though not as high-profile as the Emmys, to win a SAG Award is considered an honor.\n\nAs Variety reports, Taylor Sheridan, who co-created “Yellowstone” and created the prequel series, “1883,” which is continuing its first season on Paramount +, said in a statement, “There’s no bigger compliment to an actor than being recognized by their peers. Congratulations to our incredibly talented cast on this wonderful and well deserved nomination.”\n\nRegular viewers of “Yellowstone” are familiar with series stars Costner, Kelly Reilly, Wes Bentley and Cole Hauser. But the list of actors cited in the SAG ensemble nomination is more comprehensive. Here’s who all is listed in the “Yellowstone” ensemble category:\n\nKelsey Asbille (Monica Dutton); Wes Bentley (Jamie Dutton); Ryan Bingham (Walker); Gil Birmingham (Thomas Rainwater); Ian Bohen (Ryan); Eden Brolin (Mia); Kevin Costner (John Dutton); Hugh Dillon (Sheriff Donnie Haskell); Luke Grimes (Kayce Dutton); Hassie Harrison (Laramie); Cole Hauser (Rip Wheeler); Jen Landon (Teeter); Finn Little (Carter); Brecken Merrill (Tate Dutton); Will Patton (Garrett Randle -- which is how SAG has it spelled, though his surname frequently appears as Randall); Piper Perabo (Summer Higgins); Kelly Reilly (Beth Dutton); Denim Richards (Colby); Taylor Sheridan (the co-creator also has appeared in “Yellowstone,” as Travis); Forrie J. Smith (Lloyd); and Jefferson White (Jimmy Hurdstrom).\n\nWill “Yellowstone” win? Who knows, but the show faces stiff competition. Other ensembles in the category include the actors from such awards magnets as “Succession” and “The Handmaid’s Tale,” the star-studded Apple TV + series, “The Morning Show,” and the South Korean phenom, “Squid Game.”\n\nThe 28th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards ceremony is scheduled for 5 p.m. (PT) and 8 p.m. (ET), Sunday, Feb. 27, on TNT and TBS.\n\nMore of our coverage:\n\nConfused about where to see ‘Yellowstone?’: Here’s how to watch new and past seasons\n\nWhen the TV hit ‘Yellowstone’ returns, Piper Perabo will play a ‘protester from Portland’\n\n-- Kristi Turnquist"
