        "text": "Happy Lundi Gras (Mardi Gras‚Äô little-known sister)! üòÇ Of course by the time you read this it probably *will* be Mardi Gras, since it‚Äôs taken me allll dayyyy to get this up due to my little stinker Luke who refused to nap.\n\nI‚Äôm super excited to share my predictions for our buddy Grace Patton‚Äôs new baby, due in June!! I‚Äôm calling them predictions rather than suggestions since I‚Äôve previously done two consultations for Grace (here and here), and been so surprised by the names she and her hubby ended up giving the babies (which is something I LOVE ‚Äì being surprised by names never ceases to thrill me!) ‚Ä¶ so I feel like I don‚Äôt really have anything to offer the Pattons! They are Baby Naming Royalty, as far as I‚Äôm concerned, and I can‚Äôt wait to hear what they name this little green bean! (=gender unknown üå±) (I posted birth announcements for babies five, six, and seven as well.)\n\nBut of course I can‚Äôt stop my namey head from trying to get in their headspace and predict what names, or kinds of names?, they might choose! So first off, as a refresher, Baby‚Äôs big brothers and sisters are:\n\nJulia Grace\n\nSebastian Xavier (Bash)\n\nTheodore Augustine (Theo)\n\nPhoebe Anika\n\nBosco Ignatius\n\nAbraham James (Abe)\n\nClement Joseph\n\n+Felip√© (with Jesus)\n\nAmazing names, each one! ‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§ I did chat with Grace a little bit recently about names for this baby-on-the-way, and she said,\n\n‚ÄúWe really are kind of coming up empty-handed, honestly! We feel like we are completely out of boy names (of course we aren‚Äôt ‚Äî just will take some digging/thinking ‚Äî and Simon prefers to chat about names on the way to the hospital, ha!) and understand why my mom used one of my brother‚Äôs middle names as a first name (Daniel Peter and then Peter Joseph when she had her fourth boy). So, I‚Äôd love suggestions or predictions! Phoebe (at the mature age of 5) is really concerned that any potential girl names, ‚Äúsound nice with Phoebe and Julia‚Äù and so far all she has approved is, ‚ÄúCatherine‚Äù ‚Äî ha! I do love that name but I wouldn‚Äôt consider it a frontrunner at the moment.\n\nBecause Julia‚Äôs middle name is Grace and Phoebe‚Äôs middle name is Anika (which means grace) ‚Äî Simon loves the idea of carrying the tradition on with another middle girl name that also means grace ‚Äî which I feel less strongly about but am not at all opposed to the sentiment!\n\nIf Clement wasn‚Äôt Clement I think he would‚Äôve been a Dominic but again, not a frontrunner this time around ‚Äî funny how that works! Sebastian would‚Äôve been a Vivienne had he been a girl and I think Abe was going to be Iris if he was a girl and I still love those names but I don‚Äôt know ‚Äî we still have months to discuss, I suppose!‚Äù\n\nSuch good info here! I love that Phoebe is concerned that a sister‚Äôs name ‚Äúsound nice with Phoebe and Julia‚Äù ‚Äî I definitely took that to heart when coming up with my list of predictions! (For the record, one of the things I love about her idea of Catherine is that it ends in a different sound than Julia and Phoebe ‚Äî not so easy to do with girl names, since ends-in-a and ends-in-the-ee-sound are pretty common! You‚Äôll see I included some other differently-ending-names below.)\n\nSo we know that Vivienne and Iris were previous frontrunners for a girl, as well as Dominic for a boy. I remember from my previous Patton posts that Caroline and Felicity were also previously discussed, as well as Damian and Simon Jr. (yes, even for a non-firstborn); also no more ends-in-o names for boys either (because of Theo and Bosco).\n\nSince I did two previous consultations, there are a lottttt of names that I‚Äôve already suggested, like:\n\nVarious ideas for backing into the nickname Lola (Violet, Caroline, Lourdes, Louisa, Lucia)\n\nElisabeth\n\nFelicity\n\nStella\n\nEmmeline\n\nMagdalene\n\nVerity\n\nAudrey\n\nA bunch of Mary/Maria/Marie+ ideas (any of those paired with Olivia or Olive, Ophelia, Simone, Tess, Elliott, Emmett, Bennett)\n\nMaximilian nicked Miles\n\nFrancis nicked Finn\n\nGregory nicked Rory or Gus [Gregory Simon=Gus so perfectly!]\n\nOliver\n\nIsaac\n\nGabriel\n\nAlexander\n\nNathaniel\n\n(As you can see, there were a couple instances of overlap between names I‚Äôd suggested and names they considered! SO exciting!)\n\nThere were several that I‚Äôd considered that didn‚Äôt end up making my final cut, but I think a lot of these still potentially have merit (Grace‚Äôs previous idea of Iris is on here! Woo!):\n\nPenelope\n\nImogen(e)\n\nGenevieve\n\nIris or Ivy\n\nLydia (in BOTH previous consultations)\n\nCorinne\n\nLiv\n\nAlice\n\nZara\n\nNatalia\n\nTobias (too much long O probably)\n\nTristan\n\nBenedict/Bennett and Benjamin\n\nMatthias\n\nSamuel\n\nHenry\n\nElliott\n\nEmmett\n\nJude\n\nWhew! This post is a study in New Evangelization Catholic Baby Naming! üíÉ üíÉ üíÉ What names are left??\n\nI was actually chuckling as I was pulling this post together, because when I do repeat consultations (or ‚Äúpredictions posts,‚Äù as I‚Äôm calling this one), I always start from scratch, without looking back at my previous ideas. Then I‚Äôll go back and cross off any repeats. When I did so here, it was hilarious to discover that there were SO MANY names I had to cross off of my ideas below! So many that I thought were spot on, but I‚Äôd already suggested them previously! (As usual, I looked up the names they‚Äôve already used in the Baby Name Wizard, and I looked through my book of Marian baby names; I also used the Name Matchmaker tool on babynamewizard.com, and spent a bit of time looking for names that mean ‚Äúgrace.‚Äù I also looked through a bunch of recent Appellation Mountain posts that list the names that are big on the site that week ‚Äî I‚Äôve always thought Grace has her finger on ‚Äúthe pulse,‚Äù and up-and-coming names would be right in her wheelhouse I think.) After whittling my list down to just new ideas, these are the names that I think Grace and Simon might consider (with, okay, an actual suggestion or two thrown in here and there, I just can‚Äôt help myself):\n\nGirl\n\n(1) Charis\n\nI love this idea, it might be my favorite. Charis, which is said like Karis and Carys and is contained within the word Eucharist, means ‚Äúgrace‚Äù! In fact, that‚Äôs what it means within the word Eucharist! (From Merriam-Webster: ‚Äúfrom eucharistos grateful, from eu- + charizesthai to show favor, from charis favor, grace, gratitude; akin to Greek chairein to rejoice.‚Äù) I know of a family who named their daughter Charis because of the Eucharist connection, and I really love it for a sister for Julia and Phoebe (it‚Äôs got that different ending!). Both Julia and Phoebe have middle names that mean ‚Äúgrace,‚Äù but I really like Charis as a first name for this baby. It can certainly work as a middle too, though I found it sort of difficult to work with rhythm-wise. If they prefer it in the middle, I think something with the rhythm of Felicity Charis would sound lovely.\n\n(2) Margo(t)\n\nMargaret didn‚Äôt seem quite right to me, but I love its variant Margo(t)! It can take any of the Sts. Margaret as patron, and of course means the same as Margaret ‚Äî ‚Äúpearl,‚Äù which happens to be June‚Äôs birthstone! Kind of a cool connection for a baby due in June!\n\n(3) Maud(e)\n\nWhen I saw Maud(e) in one of the recent Appellation Mountain posts, I was immediately struck by it. I‚Äôve never, not once, considered or thought of the name Maud(e) for anyone, but for some reason, it really seemed like one Grace might like! It‚Äôs a variant of Matilda (in fact, it‚Äôs Matilda‚Äôs ‚Äúusual medieval form,‚Äù like Austin for Augustine and Bennett for Benedict), which provides a patron saint.\n\n(4) Edith, Esther\n\nBoth Edith and Esther have a similar feel to me ‚Äî names that were too old lady-ish for a baby not that long ago, but that I‚Äôm starting to see on little girls more and more. St. Edith Stein is a huge inspiration behind the little Catholic girls I see with the name (she‚Äôs amazing), and I love that Esther is biblical like Julia and Phoebe. Edie and Essie are both adorable nicknames too.\n\n(5) Eliza\n\nI‚Äôm not sure what to say about Eliza except that it feels like it might be right! I like it on its own for the Pattons (so far they‚Äôve done shorter girl names [letter-wise] while tending toward longer boy names), but I also like it as a nickname for Elizabeth, if they preferred that.\n\n(6) Bernadette, Colette\n\nGrace and her girls recently took an amazing trip to France, so French names were on my mind when I was working on this. I decided that I really like Bernadette for them! It‚Äôs definitely an up-and-coming name vintage-y name, as we discussed recently on the blog, and it was also in my recent saintly nicknames post (which I submitted as my February CatholicMom article after incorporating your ideas from the comments). The spotlight I did on it a few years ago has a few nickname options too. I also love (LOVE) Colette ‚Ä¶ but maybe it‚Äôs not quite right coming right after Clement? If that‚Äôs not a bother though, it‚Äôs such a pretty name, and St. Colette is a great patron.\n\nBefore moving onto boy names, I want to discuss more fully Simon‚Äôs hope that they‚Äôll give a name that means ‚Äúgrace‚Äù to a girl. I searched on behindthename.com and also a general google search for names meaning ‚Äúgrace,‚Äù and the results are almost all variants of Grace or contain Grace (like Graciela, Altagracia, and Engracia), or are variants of Anne (since Anne means ‚Äúgrace‚Äù). Julia‚Äôs middle name nods to the former (being Grace), and Phoebe‚Äôs to the latter (being Anika), which is another reason I was psyched to find Charis ‚Äî it‚Äôs in a third category altogether! Another that‚Äôs neither Grace nor Anne is Amara, which is Igbo (the language of the Igbo people of Nigeria) for ‚Äúgrace,‚Äù and is quite pretty. Otherwise, I think an Anne name is the best bet, since there are a few that are different enough from Anika I think. Like:\n\nAnja or Anya\n\nAnna or Anne\n\nAnnabel(le)\n\nAnnette\n\nAnouk\n\nHannah\n\nNan, Nancy, Nanette\n\n(many others listed here)\n\nIf Grace and Simon like the idea of an Anne name, they might like to choose one based on how their chosen first name sounds. Margo Annabelle sounds gorgeous to me, for example, as does Charis Anne and Charis Annette, Maude Annette, Bernadette Anne, Edith Annabelle, Eliza Nanette ‚Ä¶ so many beautiful ways to put these names together!\n\nBoy\n\n(1) Oscar\n\nMoving onto boy names, I‚Äôm seeing Oscar here and there a bit more these days ‚Äî I‚Äôm thinking of it as a recent addition to the Owen, Oliver group (along with Otto). St. Oscar Romero is a great patron, and the inspiration behind the choice of name for this sweet boy.\n\n(2) Vincent, Victor\n\nVincent and Victor are old school Catholicky Catholic names that I think always wear well. The full Vincent is so handsome, and Vince and Vinny are easy nicknames. Victor is a particular favorite of mine ‚Äî I tried to convince my hubby of it many times, and I wrote a whole CatholicMom article about it. ‚ÄúNicknames for Victor‚Äù also continues to be one of the most frequent search terms that lead people to my blog, because of this post I did. So fascinating!\n\n(3) Raphael, Ralph\n\nI‚Äôd previously suggested Gabriel for them, but since having Abe, Gabe is no longer an option. Raphael‚Äôs rarer anyway, and has the cool nickname Rafe. Speaking of Rafe, what do we think about Ralph? I don‚Äôt hugely love the ‚Äúralf‚Äù pronunciation, but I‚Äôve long loved that Rafe is a traditional pronunciation of it (and the one actor Ralph Fiennes uses). Cool? Or too high maintenance? (I remembered that I thought Design Mom has a Ralph, so I looked it up to be sure and hoooooly cow, check out Ralph‚Äôs siblings: Maude, Olive, Oscar, Betty, and Flora June. !!! I‚Äôve included Maude, Olive, and Oscar somewhere in this post [either as today‚Äôs predictions or previous consultation ideas]; Betty can totally be a nickname for Bernadette; and I‚Äôm not joking that I considered the Flora/Fleur/Florence idea before deciding not to include it here. Wow. Spot.On.) I‚Äôve recently come to love St. Ralph Sherwin, which is another plus in Ralph‚Äôs favor.\n\n(4) Bear\n\nThis is another backing-into-a-name-from-a-nickname idea. Animal names ‚Äî like Fox and Bear ‚Äî are big right now, and I considered Bear myself as a nickname for Benedict Gerard ‚Äî I thought that was so cute! And I already liked Benedict as an idea for another Patton boy. Arthur is another that I‚Äôve seen people using Bear as a nickname for, since Arthur is said to have ‚Äúbear‚Äù as part of its meaning ‚Äî Arthur has a very Design Mom feel to me, so maybe?\n\n(5) Joaqu√≠n\n\nGrace has a little Spanish flair to her style, as seen in sweet Felip√©‚Äôs name. Joaqu√≠n takes its cue from that, being the Spanish form of (my beloved) Joachim, and also the fact that it‚Äôs not as unfamiliar as Joachim ‚Äî Joaquin Phoenix and Kelly Ripa‚Äôs son Joaquin are two examples of Joaquins that people might know (especially the former). (If they want to consider Joachim though, you know I‚Äôm all over that!!)\n\nThose are all my predictions for boy names, but I couldn‚Äôt resist offering this list of long, saintly names that Grace and Simon might consider for middle names (they‚Äôve already used Xavier, Augustine, and Ignatius): Emmanuel, Thaddeus, Ambrose (ooh this might make a great first name for them?), Maximilian, Chrysostom, Athanasius, Matthias, and the once-considered Dominic and Damian.\n\nAnd those are all the names that I think Patton Baby No. 8 might end up being given! What do you all think? Do you have any predictions or suggestions for the little brother or sister of Julia, Sebastian, Theodore, Phoebe, Bosco, Abraham, and Clement?\n\nMy book, Catholic Baby Names for Girls and Boys: Over 250 Ways to Honor Our Lady (Marian Press, 2018), is available to order from ShopMercy.org and Amazon ‚Äî perfect for expectant parents, name enthusiasts, and lovers of Our Lady!\n\nHappppppy Easter Monday y‚Äôall!!! I hope you all had a wonderful weekend!!! Doesn‚Äôt the world look extra sunny now that Lent is over and the tomb is empty? He is risen! Hallelujah!\n\nI‚Äôm thrilled/delighted/dancing with joy üíÉüíÉüíÉ to post today‚Äôs consultation! Funny enough, it was Easter Monday of 2015 when I posted the first consultation I did for this family (for Baby No. 5) ‚Äî pretty cool that I get to post one for their newest little one on Easter Monday 2017!\n\nSo yes, as you‚Äôve surely gleaned from the title, today‚Äôs consultation is for Grace over at Camp Patton ‚Äî she‚Äôs one of my favorite favorite bloggers, not least because she posts lots of pictures of her beautiful children, and she are her husband have the BEST taste in names! Lest you‚Äôve forgotten, this wee green bean (=gender unknown) üå± will join big sibs:\n\nJulia Grace\n\nSebastian Xavier (Bash)\n\nTheodore Augustine (Theo)\n\nPhoebe Annika\n\nBosco Ignatius\n\n(In calling this baby No. 6, I mean their sixth baby on earth ‚Äî I don‚Äôt at all mean to forget their little Felipe, who‚Äôs surely interceding for them all, like so many of our babies.)\n\nI‚Äôm ridiculously in love with the names Grace and her hubby Simon have chosen, and there‚Äôs not really a whole lot I feel like I can add ‚Äî no matter what they end up naming their babe, I know it will be ah-mazing.\n\nThat said, when I asked Grace if she would mind if I offered some new suggestions, she said:\n\n‚ÄúYes! We‚Äôd love that!\n\nWe are always so undecided until the last minute!\n\nThank you Kate!!!! SO excited!!!‚Äú\n\nI know, right?? SO EXCITED!! üòçüòçüòç\n\nShe continued,\n\n‚ÄúFor boys we‚Äôve tossed around Dominic or Damian (I think we should avoid a name ending in ‚Äúo‚Äù as we‚Äôve got Theo, Bosco, and now Diego and I‚Äôm constantly confusing their names!) and for girls I kind of like Caroline or Felicity but I‚Äôm not sure if Felicity is too similar to Phoebe and if it‚Äôs too long a name not to have a nickname for? (I‚Äôm not a huge fan of ‚Äúlissy‚Äù) ‚Äî I suggested Simon for a boy but Simon said that ship has sailed since we didn‚Äôt name our first born Simon but I disagree ‚Äî ha!!!‚Äú\n\nAs I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre not surprised by, I have thoughts about this whole paragraph. First, I LOVE Dominic and Damian. Love! Dominic‚Äôs one of my very favorites (I spotlighted the name here), and I‚Äôm over the moon every time I see anyone considering Damian! (Here‚Äôs a little Damien I did a recent birth announcement for.) It‚Äôs such a great name with such a great saintly pedigree, I can‚Äôt say enough good things about it. (I‚Äôm not even going to acknowledge that movie. And I really hope you don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm referring to.)\n\nI also love Caroline and Felicity, both of which I included in my ideas in my first consultation post üòä. So let‚Äôs talk about Felicity. (1) Do I think it‚Äôs too similar to Phoebe? I do not. I considered this last time and decided it was perfect enough, even following immediately after Phoebe, to include it in my list of ideas. In a family with a bunch of kids, two of them sharing the same initial sound isn‚Äôt that big a deal at all, especially with having different first initials. Add in that, this time, there‚Äôs a Bosco in between Phoebe and this new baby, and I think it‚Äôs totally and completely fine. (2) What about nicknames? Nicknames! The nickname issue so often seems to be a sticking point in regards to choosing Felicity! But fear not ‚Äî I did a spotlight on Felicity recently, and I included nickname ideas! A lot of the readers left great ideas too, including what they call their real-life little Felicitys, so be sure to check it out; some that I think could work well for the Pattons include:\n\nFliss(y)\n\nFlick, Flicka (actress Felicity Huffman has a web site for women in general and moms in particular called What the Flicka)\n\nLily\n\nFin (especially maybe for something like Felicity Nora)\n\nZita is a Hungarian diminutive of the name, and Zyta a Polish short form\n\nFelly\n\nCissy\n\nFlitzi, Fitzi, Fitz\n\nCece\n\nLiddy\n\nSo I would definitely keep Felicity on their list, and I know one little Felicity in real life who is always Felicity, so that‚Äôs an option too.\n\nAnd what about Simon, after Dad? I‚Äôm glad brother Theodore isn‚Äôt interfering with Grace‚Äôs love of this idea, because Simon is a great name. But what about naming a non-firstborn son after dad? This could be the topic of a whole other post ‚Äî in fact, I‚Äôll plan to do that soon ‚Äî but I‚Äôll offer that though perhaps it‚Äôs more traditional to name a firstborn son after dad, if you‚Äôre going to do that kind of thing, it‚Äôs not UNtraditional nor unheard of to give Dad‚Äôs name to a subsequent son. I‚Äôve got loads of personal examples: we named our firstborn after our two dads, and our second boy got my husband‚Äôs name as a middle, my brother‚Äôs second son is a Junior, my two brothers were named after my grandfathers, and if there was ever a third boy he would have gotten my dad‚Äôs name as a middle. There‚Äôs something really nice about naming a non-firstborn after Dad, actually ‚Äî there are a lot of traditional firstborn ‚Äúperks,‚Äù so saving Dad‚Äôs name for a second/third/fourth son could help even the playing field a bit. But if Simon can‚Äôt come around to the idea of Simon as a first name, I think it would make an amazing middle (for a boy or a girl! More on that below).\n\nReally, I think Dominic, Damian, Simon, Caroline, and Felicity would all be amazing additions to the amazingly named Patton children, and I‚Äôd be thrilled if they named their baby any of them.\n\nDespite the fact that the Patton Parents are expert namers and have some tremendous ideas, of course I can always come up with some more! First I just have to say, I still love all the ideas I suggested last time (for a girl: various ideas for backing into the nickname Lola, Elisabeth, Felicity, Stella; for a boy: Maximilian nicked Miles, Francis nicked Finn, Gregory nicked Rory or Gus [Gregory Simon=Gus so perfectly!]). And the arrival of Mr. Bosco opened up another whole area of possibilities with the last-name-as-first name thing, which really had already been there a little bit with Bash‚Äôs middle name being Xavier (I think Xavier‚Äôs mostly lost its last-naminess, but when there‚Äôs also a Bosco in the family, it comes to the fore a little more), so I was tempted to offer some more along those lines ‚Äî Kolbe, Bennett, Becket, Siena, Serra ‚Äî but I fought against it because I was feeling like following Bosco with another surname name might feel like a little too much. Do you agree? I did make two exceptions though, which I‚Äôll explain below.\n\nOkay! On to my ideas. You all know that I rely heavily on the Baby Name Wizard in my consultations, as it offers, for each entry, boy and girl names that are similar in terms of style/feel/popularity, and I also used Nymbler and the Name Matchmaker this time around as well. I used both the names they‚Äôve already used (first names only, except I also included Xavier and Annika, both of which Grace has said in the past that she sort of wished they‚Äôd saved for first names), and those they‚Äôre considering in my research. A lot of names spoke to me that didn‚Äôt last time, and I also took some chances and ventured farther afield. This is what I came up with:\n\nGirl\n\n(1) Emmeline\n\nI started out feeling like the Pattons had a Brideshead Revisisted feel going on with Julia, Sebastian, and Theodore, and while I initially felt a little bit like Phoebe threw me for a loop, all I had to do was remember that my own family tree on my dad‚Äôs side ‚Äî which has a direct line back to 1600s England ‚Äî has a bunch of girls named Phebe in it (that spelling), especially the closer you get to the family‚Äôs emigration from England, to make me think I wasn‚Äôt that far off with Brideshead Revisited. Add in Caroline and Felicity to the names they‚Äôre considering, and I‚Äôm feeling pretty good about suggesting the lovely Emmeline. Behind the Name says it‚Äôs a variant of Amelia, which is where patron saints can be found, or you could think of it as an elaboration of Emma, in which case these saints would suit. It can be said emma-LINE, emma-LYNN, and emma-LEEN, and can be spelled Emmaline and Emmalyn. Emma and Emmy are sweet nicknames.\n\n(2) Magdalene\n\nThis is the first surname name I allowed myself to suggest, both because it‚Äôs a girl‚Äôs name rather than a boy‚Äôs, and because it doesn‚Äôt feel surnamey and has a long history of use as a first name. I also like that it‚Äôs long, like Sebastian and Theodore ‚Äî until now the girls‚Äô names have been short, and until Bosco the boys‚Äô names were long, so it‚Äôs kind of cool to switch it up with a longer girl‚Äôs name. There are lots of nickname possibilities: Maggie, Maddie, Molly, and Magda are some that I‚Äôd consider (Magda has that Brit feel to me).\n\n(3) Verity\n\nEver since watching Poldark (which I happen to know Grace is a little bit into), I‚Äôve loved the name Verity. Not only is it uncommon but familiar, which is sort of a sweet spot with naming, it‚Äôs got great faith significance in the sense that it means ‚Äútruth.‚Äù It also has a little of that Puritan feeling that I get from Phoebe and Felicity, which is a feel I love.\n\n(4) Audrey\n\nI was surprised to find Audrey listed as style match for Dominic, so I looked it up in the BNW and a good number of the names listed as similar to it are ones I could see fitting in really well at Camp Patton, like Claire, Evelyn, Charlotte, Elliott, and Luke. I thought about it for a bit, and since Audrey Hepburn is its overwhelming association for me, and she herself was British (not to keep harping on the British thing), I started to really feel it. It‚Äôs classy, and literary (Shakespearean, no less: As You Like It), and saintly (though it took me a few minutes to find a version of her story that was uplifting).\n\n(5) Mary/Maria + _____\n\nI mentioned the possibility of a Mary+ name in my last consultation, and it‚Äôs on the list again! I‚Äôm a big fan of balance in baby naming, which I realize works better on storybook families than those in the real world, and it‚Äôs so totally not a big deal whether sibling names have that aesthetic composition that makes me sigh with contentment, but as many of you know I do often find myself trying to come up with names that ‚Äúbridge‚Äù different styles in the names of the already-born children. With Bosco‚Äôs name having a different feel than his big sibs, I wanted to offer an idea that might make sense of it beyond the [very real and awesome] ‚ÄúCatholic names all go together by virtue of them being Catholic names‚Äù idea (which I myself have happily employed in the naming of my own children). To that end, I thought a Mary+ double would be just the thing, as putting Mary in front of virtually any name makes it (1) totally doable for a girl and (2) gives it a Catholic oomph, and (3) there‚Äôs the added layer of a double first name being unusual enough that it can fit in with all sorts of unusual names. There were a few ideas I liked for this idea (and I liked Maria as much as or better than Mary in some examples):\n\nMary Simone or Maria Simone: I mentioned above that if Dad Patton can‚Äôt get on board with Simon for a boy‚Äôs first, maybe he wouldn‚Äôt mind it as a middle for a boy OR a girl. I really love the idea of Mary Simone or Maria Simone, *especially* if a nickname like Maisie is used! You know I‚Äôm a fan of those firstname+middlename mashup nicknames! I think Mary/Maria Simone nicked Maisie would be amazing. (And they could even go with the old English pronunciation of Maria if they wanted, which is like Mariah ‚Äî I know a little girl who has Maria-pronounced-like-Mariah for a middle name.)\n\nMary Tess or Maria Tess: I like Tess for them anyway, but I don‚Äôt feel like Therese/T(h)eresa is exactly their style. But Mary Tess or Maria Tess are sweet! She could go by the double name, or just Tess on the day-to-day.\n\nMary Elliott, or Mary Emmett, or Mary Bennett: One of my favorite things to do with a Mary+ double is to pair it with a boy name or a surname (this is my second surname suggestion). It feminizes the second name without making it seem like a girl name, if that makes any sense, and gives the very Catholic & traditional Mary+ construction a little whimsy and unexpectedness while still staying grounded. Elliott, Emmett, and Bennett are all names I liked for them for a boy, but ultimately cut them from my final list ‚Äî this would be a neat way to work them in in a different way. (Elliott is a variant of Elijah, Emmett is actually from a surname deriving from Emma, and Bennett is a medieval variant of Benedict, so lots of patron saint options here.)\n\nA last note about girl names: There were several that I considered last time that didn‚Äôt make the cut then or now, including Penelope, Imogen(e), Genevieve, Iris or Ivy, Lydia, Corinne, and Liv. This time around, the ones that I considered but ultimately decided not to include on this girl list include Alice, Zara, Lydia (for the second time ‚Ä¶ hmmm), and Natalia.\n\nBoy\n\n(1) Oliver\n\nI honestly don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt suggest Oliver last time ‚Äî I love it for the Pattons!! It did tremendously well in my research, being similar to Julia, Sebastian, Phoebe, Felicity, and Simon. Wow! In this consultation from a couple months ago, a family (who already has a Dominic and a Kolbe ‚Äî like Dominic on the Pattons‚Äô list and Kolbe has a similar feel to Bosco to me) who was considering Oliver explained, ‚ÄúWe like Oliver Plunkett‚Äôs story because in today‚Äôs culture it is hard to be a faithful Catholic. We‚Äôd like any name-sake to be an example of how to live out the faith when facing persecution or other challenges‚Äù ‚Äî I love that! Additionally, though it seems that Oliver is not etymologically related to ‚Äúolive,‚Äù it‚Äôs close enough that it could be a nod to Our Lady of the Olives, and you all know what a sucker I am for a Marian boy name! A reader also pointed this out to me from Psalm 128:\n\n‚ÄúYour wife will be like a fruitful vine\n\nwithin your home,\n\nYour children like young olive plants\n\naround your table.‚Äù\n\nUm, pretty accurate I‚Äôd say (in the very very best way!). üòâ In that same consultation, I also suggested middle names for Oliver and I thought some of the combos might appeal to the Pattons as well: Oliver Nathaniel, Oliver James, Oliver Matthias.\n\n(2) Isaac\n\nIsaac has been on my own list for a long time, I love it! I love that it‚Äôs biblical, which I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs why it was listed as a style match for Julia and Phoebe, and I love that it‚Äôs saintly ‚Äî St. Isaac Jogues is one of the North American Martyrs (their shrine is near me and a local church is named after him, so the name really has taken on more of a saintly feel than biblical for me). It‚Äôs got great nickname options in Ike and Zac.\n\n(3) Gabriel\n\nGabriel is a fantastic name for a little boy. It‚Äôs biblical, saintly, angelic, and Marian, which covers all the bases! It‚Äôs a style match for Xavier, Simon, Dominic, and has great nickname options: Gabe is friendly and boyish; Gil is bookish and dreamy in a Gilbert Blythe sort of way.\n\n(4) Alexander\n\nAlexander is a long name name like Sebastian and Theodore; it‚Äôs papal and saintly and pan-European; but what really encouraged me to put it on the list was the nickname Xander. Grace lamented once that they didn‚Äôt save Xavier for a first name, and in my experience people who like Xavier often like Xander. BUT, if she and Simon don‚Äôt care for Xander but like Alexander, Sander‚Äôs my recent favorite nickname for it. There‚Äôs Alex too, of course, which is such a classic.\n\n(5) Nathaniel\n\nFinally, Nathaniel, a style match for Sebastian, Simon, Caroline, and Julia according to my research, but also having some of that Puritan/Pilgrim feel of Phoebe and Felicity. It‚Äôs such a handsome, serious name with the great nickname Nate.\n\nThe boy names that I considered but ultimately cut from my final list included Tobias (I really loved this one for them, but I just kept thinking that the long O and the B, especially if they used the nickname Toby, was too much with Bosco and Theo and Diego), Tristan (a name moms tend to like and dads tend to not, in my experience), Benedict/Bennett and Benjamin, Matthias (I‚Äôm trying to remember why I didn‚Äôt include it?), Samuel, Joseph, Henry, Elliott, Emmett, and Jude.\n\nAnd those are all my ideas! What do you all think? What name(s) would you suggest for the little brother or sister of Julia, Sebastian, Theodore, Phoebe, and Bosco?"
