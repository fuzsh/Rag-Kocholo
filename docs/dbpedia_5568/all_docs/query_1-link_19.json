Was this our William and was his knowledge of Wine Making and the use of yeast in the fermentation process enough from him to transition from working with the Highland Park Distillery which was established in 1798, to then establish his own bakery?\n\nAdded to this fact his Grandmother, Susanna Dunn, was from Longformacus home of the Sinclair Baronets of Longformacus , may have been enough of a connection for William to meet, fall in love and eventually marry Annie Sinclair. Perhaps Annie was the reason that William travelled to Kirkwell to find work with Highland Park Distillery , to be closer to her family??\n\nThe fact that at this time William appears to be the only male child in his family created significant barriers in tracing his lineage. Although we had traced him back through to this line it wasn't until we started to receive DNA results from family members in the USA that the family tree started to consolidate.\n\nBeing the only male child could also have assisted him in living in relative isolation from family members in the Orkney Islands. Most of his cousins having emigrated to colonial America.\n\nWilliam married Annie SINCLAIR,20 daughter of John SINCLAIR 20 and Barbara MAXWELL,20 on 16 Jan 1790 in Kirkwall & St Ola, Mainland, Orkney Islands, Scotland.21 Annie was born on 22 Oct 1770 in Kirkwall & St Ola, Mainland, Orkney Islands, Scotland.\n\nAnnie is the 5th great-grandmother of Gary Ian Patton\n\nEvents\n\nSCOTTISH CLAN RELATIONSHIP: Clan Sinclair.\n\nGaelic Name: Mac na Ceardadh\n\nMotto: Commit thy work to God\n\nBadge: Whin\n\nLands: Midlothian, Orkney and Caithness\n\nOrigin of Name: Placename, French de Sancto Claro\n\nPipe Music: Spaidsearachd Mhic nan Cearda (The Sinclair's March)\n\nClan History\n\nSt. Clare in Pont d'Eveque in Normandy is generally thought to be the birthplace of this great northern clan.\n\nThe family received a grant of the Barony of Roslin in Midlothian during the twelfth century. Through marriage, the family obtained the Earldom of Orkney, and in the next century received land in Caithness. The earldom or kingdom of Orkney was later resigned by order of James III.\n\nThe chief of clan Sinclair at this time split the family lands, giving the lands of Caithness to his elder son, and the lands at Roslin to his younger son. It was around this point that the spelling \"Sinclair\" came into general use, although the Earls of Roslin still prefer to use the older form of \"St. Clare\".\n\nThe Earls of Caithness engaged in a long succession of feuds with their neighbours and within the family. This resulted in the 4th Earl imprisoning his son in Girnigoe Castle, where he starved to death.\n\nMuch of the Sinclair lands in Caithness had to be sold off to pay debts. Within the family, rights to estates were disputed and culminated in a battle between the Sinclairs and the Campbells on the banks of Altimarlech, near Wick. It is said that, as a result of this battle, \"so many Sinclairs were killed that the Campbells were able to cross the water without getting their feet wet\".\n\nThe Earls of Caithness engaged in a long succession of feuds with their neighbours and within the family.

Chew.\n\nDied on the morning of Tuesday, June 24, 1890, Mrs. Eleanor Ann Chew, widow of the late John James Chew, having nearly completed the 85th year of her age.\n\nMrs. Chew was the daughter of Mr Robert Patton, a well-known and successful merchant of Fredericksburg, and the sister of Hugh Patton, cashier of the Farmers' Bank of Fredericksburg; of Col. John M. Patton, the distinguished lawyer of Richmond, and of Dr. Farley Patton. She was the granddaughter of Gen. Hugh Mercer, of the Revolution, who was killed at Princeton, and the mother of the late Col. R. S. Chew, of the 30th Virginia Infantry of the Confederate Army, and who for many years was the Clerk of the Court at Fredericksburg, as were his father and grandfather.\n\nThe departure of Mrs. Chew severs one of the last links that bind our community to the generation that seems so notable to us, but now passed away forever. With the elevated family traditions and associations she was a Christian matron of the olden type, whom it was profitable as well as pleasant to know. Unaffected, domestic, simple in taste, gentle, she was firm in principle and in matters of duty inflexible, and strong in will.\n\nMany years ago, in 1831, in the earlier years of her married life, she made profession of religion in the old Presbyterian church, under the ministry of the Rev. Dr. Samuel B. Wilson. It was in a year of extended religious interest in Fredericksburg, when as many as eighty-eight were added to that Church alone. With her came into the Church many who, like her, were \"steadfast, unmovable, and abounding in the work of the Lord\" to the end of their days. Mrs. Chew, while retiring and domestic in her disposition and habit, was an eminently intelligent Christian, very fond of the best of reading and most faithful in the religious duties of her home and Church.\n\nSome share of the world's trouble, some seasons of pain and grief were not left out of the allotment of her life; but the grace of God sustained and strengthend her. Her faith failed not, but ripened into patience, and out of the fires of affiliction she came refined and purified. Very sweet and precious to her were the promises of God.\n\nFrom a love of poetry grew a love of sacred verse and great fondness for and fimiliarity with the best of Christian hymns. There was a growing witness of the Spirit, and an increasing confidence as of one whose feet were on the Rock and whose goings were established.\n\nThe decline of strength and health had been very gradual, almost by an imperceptible progress through several years, and at last the tide went out, the flame sank low in the socket, until without pain or struggle gently and sweetly she rested her heart on the bosom of the Lord she had so long trusted and served, and sometimes whispering, \"My Saviour! My Saviour!\" at last, as gently as a child would fall asleep, the aged mother \"fell asleep in Jesus.\"\n\n\"So fades a Summer cloud away,\n\nSo sinks the gale when storms are o'er,\n\nSo gently shut the eys of day,\n\nSo dies a wave along the shore.\"\n\n\"The soulds of believers are, at their death, made perfect in holiness, and do immediately pass into glory, and their bodies, being still united to Christ, do rest in their graves till the resurrection.\"\n\nShe was buried from her residence Thursday morning at ten o'clock, Rev. Dr. James P. Smith performing the ceremonies. The pallbearers were her sons-in-law and grandsons, F T. Forbes, E. M. Crutchfield, J. A. Taylor, Will M. Grafton, J. F. Forbes and John Chew.\n\n(The Free Lance, Fredericksburg, Va., 27 Jun 1890, page 3 col 3,)\n\nSource - Find A Grave\n\nEleanor married John James CHEW, son of Robert Smith CHEW.
