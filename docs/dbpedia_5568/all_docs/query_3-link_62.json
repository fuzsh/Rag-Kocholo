        "text": "The name of Paton is written in old deeds Patton, and the family originally from the south of England is of considerable antiquity. An old parchment deed in the possession of an English family of the name states: \"In the sixth and twentieth year of Henry VI William Patten, alias Waynflete (from a town in Lancashire where he was born), was son and heir of Richard Patten and eldest brother of John, Dean of Chichester. For his learning he was first consecrated Bishop of Winchester, then for his wisdom made Lord Chancellor of England, and was the sole founder of Magdalen College in Oxford (Whittemore's History of the Oranges [probably Henry Whittemore's The Founders and Builders of the Oranges]).\" The family was widely distinguished through Ireland and Scotland, the latter country being the home of the progenitor of the Troy family of Patton.\n\nRobert Patton, of the same Scotch family, settled in Fredericksburg, Virginia, where he became very wealthy. He married Anne Gordon, daughter of General Hugh Mercer, of the revolutionary army, killed at the battle of Princeton. His son, John Mercer Patton, of Richmond, Virginia, was a graduate of Princeton College; member of congress from Virginia, judge of special court of appeals, and a leader of the Virginia bar. He married Margaret French Williams, and had a son, Isaac Williams Patton, of New Orleans, Louisiana, a lieutenant of the United States army, served in the Mexican war, resigned in 1855, and was a colonel in the confederate army, adjutant-general of Louisiana, mayor and treasurer of New Orleans. A son, Mercer Williams Patton, born 1867, is a resident of that city.\n\n(I) Alexander Patton was born in Auchtermuchty, Fifeshire, Scotland, December 13, 1779, died in Troy, New York. He was educated in his native land, where he also learned the cooper's trade. He sailed from Scotland, June 22, 1801, in a vessel loaded with coal for New York, where he arrived August 25, following, after a voyage of unusual peril. When well at sea, fire was discovered in the coal, and during the remainder of the voyage constant endeavor only saved the vessel from destruction. The smoke and gas, particularly the latter, at times overcame the workers, and at one time it was thought the vessel must be abandoned. But the fire was finally controlled and the ship arrived in New York without loss of a sailor or passenger. He did not remain long in New York, but settled in Troy, where he was in business for several years. He married, September 25, 1803, Ann De Witt Van Wagoner, born in Johnstown, New York; children:\n\nThomas, see forward;\n\nJane, married Dr. Amos J. Burton, of Albany, New York.\n\n(II) Thomas, only son of Alexander and Ann De Witt (Van Wagoner) Patton, was born in Troy, New York, February 5, 1807, died in that city, November 25, 1890. He was educated in Troy, near where in 1841 he purchased a farm, and for many years devoted himself to its cultivation. He was later in the leather business and dealt in real estate. He married, in Troy, November 16, 1831, Drusilla, born in Troy, August 20, 1808, died in that city, May 2, 1867, daughter of Benjamin Gordon. Children:"
