Seeking an adventurous honeymoon, they decide on a mule ride into the canyon, accompanied by their guide, Henry (Will Patton). The following day, they descend into the canyon. During their journey, Henry suggests a detour to ancient petroglyphs, located half a day's ride away. After some persuasion from Nick, Lori consents to the proposed journey. This scene, imbued with anticipation and the thrill of adventure, was filmed in Antelope Canyon, Utah. Antelope Canyon is a must-visit destination in the American Southwest, known for its water-carved sandstone curves that are beautifully illuminated by light shafts from above. Its ethereal beauty lends an authentic backdrop to the unfolding drama in The Canyon. However, Antelope Canyon is not just a stunning filming location but also a significant cultural site. Located on Navajo Nation land, it's governed by Navajo Nation rules. As such, visitors are required to book a tour with a Navajo guide to access Antelope Canyon. This ensures respect for the land and its cultural significance while allowing visitors to experience its breathtaking beauty. Access to Antelope Canyon is exclusively through guided tours, which can be booked from Las Vegas or the neighboring Page, AZ. If you're keen on witnessing the mesmerizing sunbeams that the canyon is famous for, plan your visit to Upper Antelope Canyon from mid-March to October.\n\nAfter a day's hike, the newlywed couple (Yvonne Strahovski and Eion Bailey) find themselves at a dead end adorned with petroglyphs. The realization that they've been heading the wrong way pushes them to attempt a climb up the rock face, hoping to catch a signal on Lori's phone. This particular scene was captured in Moab, Utah. The exact filming location isn't disclosed, but Moab is renowned for its wealth of petroglyphs. Fans seeking to immerse themselves in the movie's environment can embark on a canyoneering trip in Moab, where they can encounter numerous petroglyphs. For instance, the Moonflower Canyon Petroglyphs are worth a visit. Easily accessible, these petroglyphs are located beside the road on a small section of the cliff wall, eliminating the need for a hike into the canyon. They're conveniently situated en route from Moab to Birthing Rock. The cliff wall along Potash Road by the Colorado River also houses the Potash Road Petroglyphs. These are scattered along the cliff, some high up and others closer to the ground. This variety adds an element of exploration and discovery for visitors. Travelers can reach Moab by private car. It takes approximately 3 hours to drive from Phoenix via Interstate 17 North. If coming from Las Vegas, the journey will take a little longer, around 3 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nThe Canyon provides viewers with stunning visuals of both Utah and Arizona landscapes. The filming locations for the film in Utah and Arizona have played an integral role in bringing this cinematic masterpiece to life. The breathtaking landscapes of these states, from the rugged canyons of Zion National Park to the iconic vistas of Monument Valley, have provided the perfect backdrop for the film's gripping narrative. With their stunning natural beauty and unparalleled cinematic charm, Utah and Arizona have genuinely added a touch of awe-inspiring magic to The Canyon, making it a visual and emotional journey like no other."
