        "text": "THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THIS PROJECT is to test and analyze the YDNA of the various PATTON (any spelling) families around the world. Test participants must be male and bear the surname PATTON. 37 to 111 markers are necessary for an accurate comparison within a genealogical time frame. We do recommend testing more than one direct male descendant of the earliest documented ancestor through different son lines. Triangulation of these tests help to confirm the haplotype of individual lines.\n\nProject members will be encouraged to pursue advanced haplogroup SNP testing. Advanced SNP tests will be recommended to define family lines and establish the most accurate matches. The SNP tests include BIGY, SNP PACKS and individual SNP tests.\n\nThe \"earliest ancestor\" information listed for testees in this project should represent names that can be documented, rather than names that are theory/unproven.\n\nFamily Finder test results do not have a public display. The number of testees in our project that have ordered Family Finder is noted on the PROJECT STATISTICS page. Project admins can tell members if they are an autosomal DNA match to other members of this project."
