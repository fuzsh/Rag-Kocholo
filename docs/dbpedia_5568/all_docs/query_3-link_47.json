        "text": "Every contributor to The University of Tulsa has a different story to tell. Each of these generous donors has realized the powerful impact they make when they support others in pursuing a degree from TU, and Paul Patton (BA ’72) and his sister Diane Patton are no exception.\n\nPaul and Diane are the children of the late Paul L. and Jonnie Mae Patton. They grew up in Tulsa, and Paul earned his degree in journalism from TU in 1972.\n\nPaul has had a varied career. He combined his excellent writing skills and his strong interest in the political system to serve as a senior administrative aid to George Nigh during Nigh’s tenure as the Governor of Oklahoma during the 1980s.\n\nIn 1989, Paul produced and wrote the documentary entitled “The Honey Harvest” in collaboration with Steve Richey and Rod Slane from Spectral Films, Inc. An amateur beekeeper, Paul produced the film as a study of the honey bee’s intricate social order, relationship to people, and position in the world ecosystem.\n\nMuch of Patton’s career, from 1986 until his retirement in 2019, was spent as the Executive Director of the Tulsa County Medical Society. The Tulsa County Medical Society, a professional organization of over 1,200 physicians and 200 residents in the Tulsa metro area, advocates for both physicians and patients. It was established in 1907.\n\nAn avid reader, Paul is active with the projects and causes of the Tulsa Public Library. In 1998, he served as a member of the selection committee for the Peggy V. Helmerich Distinguished Author Award. The purpose of this annual award is to give formal recognition to internationally acclaimed authors who have written a distinguished body of work and have made a major contribution to the field of literature and letters.\n\nPaul and his sister Diane established a significant endowment fund at TU in 2005. Their substantial giving is an important way to thank their parents, Paul Sr. and Jonnie Mae, for their happy upbringing and to support students who otherwise would not have the financial resources to attend TU. For this, the university is truly grateful."
