        "text": "JOIN REQUEST REQUIREMENT ~ You MUST have or will immediately purchase a Y-DNA 37, 67 or 111 test for a male PATTON in order to join this project. In your JOIN REQUEST for the \"Tell us what you know...\" section - please tell us what test you have ordered or plan to order. Also, you MUST provide the full name of your earliest DOCUMENTED male Patton ancestor and his date and place of birth/death. Provide the same information for each male generation down to your Patton great-grandparent. Do not send a link to a website or online genealogy. Women interested in their Patton line must locate male Patton in their family line and ask them to do the Y-DNA test. AUTOSOMAL DNA TESTS ~ We do not accept testees with only an autosomal DNA test known as Family Finder at FTDNA, or the Ancestry or 23&Me data transfer. MITOCHONDRIAL DNA TEST ~ We do not accept testees with only a mitochondrial DNA test. By requesting to join this project you agree to provide the project administrators with documentary proof of your direct Patton lineage to your great-grandfather. Y-DNA STR and SNP results and some of your earliest direct line ancestor information will be posted on member pages."
