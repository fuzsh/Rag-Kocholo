Just click the cover to download\n\na copy of Ayn Rand's classic novella Anthem with an Introducation and\n\n\"biblical\" editing by Charles M. Province.\n\nAyn Rand's Anthem\n\nWritten in 1937, Anthem was published in England after being refused publication in America. It was\n\npublished in 1946 by Pamphleteers, Inc. In 1950, it was published in Famous Fantastic Mysteries\n\nas a Science-Fantasy story. Anthem relates the struggle of a man who rediscovers individualism\n\n& the personal pronoun “I” in a world where enslaved people have been subjugated to auseless\n\nexistence purely for the benefit of the “State Collective.” They are no longer citizens––they are\n\nproperty of the Collective. Thoughts or actions considered to be against “the common good”\n\nare punished by severe lashings. The world has lost all of the achievements of science and\n\ncivilization and has reverted to primitive cruelty where only candles are allowed for light.\n\nEquality 7-2521 endures danger, denunciation, imprisonment, and torture, but he\n\nbreaks free of the Collective’s shackles, and with the woman he loves, he starts a\n\nnew life in an uncharted wilderness, promising to recreate a world in which\n\neach man will be free to exist for his own sake.\n\nThis museum-quality collectible volume has been edited into a form more\n\nlike an epic poem as befits both the story and Ayn Rand's concept of\n\nit. This new version is a book meant to be kept and read many\n\ntimes. It is a perfect addition to the personal library of any\n\nrational, thinking, and freedom loving individual.\n\nTo order a book, click the cover!\n\nThe Red House: The Book, The Film, and Me. For fifty years, fear of the vanishing red house in the Jersey\n\nBarrens had warped the lives of Ellen and Pete Yocum. Old Pete swore that the house moved from place to\n\nplace and that screams heard within it put a hex on anyone who ventured near. Meg Yarrow, raised by the\n\nYocums since childhood, experienced the same terror until Nathan, the new farmhand, arrived. One day\n\nthey started on a search for The Red House in the Oxhead Woods, only to encounter violent danger––\n\nwhether due to natural or supernatural causes, they could not tell. How they found the house and\n\nunraveled its eerie secret forms the powerful climax of this outstanding mystery novel.\n\nCharles M. Province provides a history of the book by George Agnew Chamberlain, the subsequent\n\nfilm created by the screenplay and direction of Delmer Daves, and in addition, Province provides\n\nthe story of how the film and book effected him when he saw it as a 3-year-old child in 1947.\n\nPut it all together and it offers a fascinating story about how a book can be turned into a\n\nfilm and how that film can eventually give direction to a viewer's life and career.\n\nJon Gnagy––Desert Artist & Television's Art Instruction Pioneer is the third and final book in the series\n\nduring the years after he moved to Idyllwild, California, where he lived for the remainder of his life.\n\nAlthough he continued his various forms of art, drawing, and experimentation, his main interest\n\nbecame the nearby desert locations to the east. Gnagy was fascinated by the landscapes, the\n\nmountains, the hills, the desert sky, and the plant life of the desert. He spent many hours\n\nevery day studying and rendering his views of desert life in many mediums, all of\n\nwihch are exquisite art.

Patton, Jr. built his own legend\n\nas a military genius and warrior. General Patton was the epitome of the American fighting\n\nsoldier in World War II. His unique, unequaled leadership style provided him the ability to\n\nobtain more from his troops than any other General officer in the war. His charisma, his\n\nflamboyance, and his highly publicized warrior image stimulated his men––more than\n\nany other General––to an aggressive desire to meet and destroy the enemy. Patton\n\nwas the personification of the pure warrior spirit; the single-mindedness, the\n\nruthlessness, and the driving will, all of which make up the requisites for\n\nvictory in battle. With his superior and dominant understanding of the\n\ncombat effectiveness of unified forces, Patton integrated his armored\n\ndivisions, motorized infantry, and self-propelled artillery into a\n\nsingular fighting force. Add to that his acute perception of\n\nwell-devised air support operations and his close-knit\n\ncollaboration with the XIX Tactical Air Command,\n\nand it becomes clear how Patton perfected the\n\nconcept of Blitzkrieg. It explains why the\n\nGerman Wehrmacht feared him.\n\nThe Flat River Kid Strikes Again\n\nThe Flat River Kid Strikes Again continues the saga of A Little Kid From Flat River and\n\nThe Adventures of the Flat River Kid, about the life and times of Mike Province, a little\n\nkid from the small Lead Mining town of Flat River, Missouri.

Copley who was born\n\non August 12, 1916, in St. Johnsville, New York. Both of Jim's birth parents (Lodwell) died during\n\nthe Influenza epidemic of 1917-18. From then on, Jim's life took on all the drama and turmoil of a\n\nCharles Dickens' novel. He was adopted at the age of two, brought up by Colonel Ira C. Copley, an\n\nIllinois congressman, and he eventually became the sole owner of one of the world's largest family\n\nowned newspaper empires. Jim Copley was a very private person who assiduously protected his\n\nprivacy. This book, however, helps to display his personality as a publisher and newspaperman\n\nthrough the writings of some of his friends and close associates at Copley Press and the Copley\n\nNewspaper Group.

Following World War II,\n\nAmerican political and military leaders, consumed with hubris, felt the U.S. military was\n\ninvincible and that all other nations would cower if American said, “Boo!” This book\n\nrelates the sordid story of the political chicanery and military incompetence that\n\ncaused the American defeat in Korea. Intelligent and trenchant military\n\nhistorians acknowledge General Walker's actions were\n\nboth prudent and correct during this ill-conceived\n\nmission to act as a \"World Police Force.\"\n\nHardcover or Paperback\n\nJon Gnagy - America's Art Teacher\n\nJon Gnagy - America's Art Teacher chronicles the life and career of Jon Gnagy, the first Television Art Instructor.\n\nWhen Jon Gnagy appeared as the first \"star\" of the first television show ever telecast by the new RCA-NBC\n\nChannel 4 (WNBT) from the top of the Empire State building in New York City in May, 1946, he started\n\na career that continued the rest of his life.

It was, and still is, one of the most remarkable feats of\n\ngeneralship and military maneuver in the history of warfare. It has been said that no one\n\nexcept Patton could have envisioned it and no army except Patton's Third Army could\n\nhave accomplished it. Included are Patton's personal notes regarding the Bastogne\n\nCampaign (December through January, 1944 & 1945) and some candid comments\n\nfrom his personal diary regarding the higher echelons of authority that\n\nallowed the \"bulge\" to occur in the first place.The General George S.
