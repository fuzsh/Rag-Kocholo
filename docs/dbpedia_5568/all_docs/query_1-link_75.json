        "text": "George C. Scott (born October 18, 1927, Wise, Virginia, U.S.—died September 22, 1999, Westlake Village, California) was an American actor whose dynamic presence and raspy voice suited him to a variety of intense roles during his 40-year film career.\n\nScott was born in Virginia but reared and educated near Detroit. He served a four-year stint in the marines during the late 1940s before studying journalism and drama at the University of Missouri. He supported himself with several unskilled jobs throughout the early 1950s, taking numerous roles in television and repertory theater productions. By 1957 Scott considered himself a failure at acting and was working as an IBM machine operator when he was cast in the title role in Joe Papp’s production of Shakespeare’s Richard III (1957). The production was a great critical success, and Scott’s performance was highly praised; one New York critic described Scott as “the meanest Richard III ever seen by human eyes.” For the next two years, he played a succession of quality roles in Off-Broadway and Broadway productions.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nBest Picture Movie Quote Quiz\n\nHe made his film debut in the 1959 western The Hanging Tree and was nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actor for his second film role, that of an unctuous assistant prosecutor in Otto Preminger’s Anatomy of a Murder (1959). So riveting was Scott’s screen presence that many critics thought he stole scenes from star James Stewart by doing nothing but sitting in a chair and following the action with his eyes. His next film role was that of gambler Bert Gordon in The Hustler (1961). Again nominated for an Oscar, Scott refused the nomination in what would become a characteristic gesture; he believed that competition among actors demeaned the profession. He was not nominated a few years later when he turned in a brilliant performance as the apelike Gen. Buck Turgidson in Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove (1964).\n\nDuring the 1960s Scott appeared in several Broadway plays but continued to make one Hollywood film per year. His notable films from the last half of the decade included The Bible (1966), The Flim-Flam Man (1967), and Petulia (1968). In 1970 he took on the role with which he is most associated: Gen. George S. Patton in Patton. Again Scott refused an Academy Award nomination; nevertheless, he won an Oscar for his remarkable tour de force. Choosing to recognize his talent rather than respect his wishes, the Academy again nominated him for his work in Paddy Chayefsky’s satire The Hospital (1971)."
