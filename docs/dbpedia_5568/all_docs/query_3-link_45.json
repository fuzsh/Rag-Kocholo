        "text": "Second Generation\n\n2. Richard PATTEN (PATINE), of Patten House - Chelmsford, England (Patton Familly Lines1) was born circa 1066.\n\nEvents\n\nVoices From The Past: The Echoes of Richard Patine, Cir 1090, Chelmsford, Essex, England. At the crossroads of time, where the whispers of history linger, I invite you to unravel the tapestry woven by the Patine legacy\\emdash a lineage entangled with the very essence of England's medieval saga. Picture me, Richard Patine, standing on the grounds of Chelmsford, Essex, where the rhythms of our family's life commenced, mere decades after the triumphant strides of William the Conqueror.\n\nIn the rustic beauty of Chelmsford, Northeast England, stands our ancestral abode, \"Patten House.\" This haven, granted by none other than William The Conqueror, Duke of Normandy and England's first Norman King, becomes the cradle of our family's tale. Picture Chelmsford, perched on the ancient Roman road, caressed by the North Sea's gentle breath\\emdash an idyllic backdrop for the emergence of the Patine legacy.\n\nWilliam I, the Conqueror, a Norman monarch, casts a towering shadow over our family's life. Born in 1028, he shaped England's destiny from 1066 until his final breath in 1087. His Norman lineage, tracing back to Rollo, Duke of Normandy, and the seismic Norman Conquest, sets the stage for the Patens' journey.family's life and history.\n\nJoin me and my 23rd Great Grandson Gary as we watch our family expand and grow over the centuries,\n\nIn Viking culture, there is a saying that goes \"Minns ætt þína\", which translates to \"Remember your heritage\"\n\n.\n\nDISCUSSION: Patton Family Origins, in 1095, in Chelmsford, Essex, England. \"The family of PATTEN claims an ancestry coeval with the Conquest, the Patten family name first appears in Chelmsford less that 55 years following the Norman Conquest of England.\"\n\n\"Patten House\" was located near Chelmsford, Essex, England. Chelmsford is Northeasterly from London, on the old Roman road, ·near an arm of the North sea. The estate, the possession of which at that time was most likely by grant from the Conqueror, at least held by his consent, was also called Pattine or Patten.\n\nWilliam I, William The Conqueror and also usually known as William The Bastard (c. 1028[1] - 9 September 1087), was the first Norman King of England, reigning from 1066 until his death in 1087. He was a descendant of Rollo and was Duke of Normandy from 1035 onward. His hold was secure on Normandy by 1060, following a long struggle to establish his throne, and he launched the Norman conquest of England six years later. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands, and by difficulties with his eldest son, Robert Curthose.\n\nWilliam was the son of the unmarried Robert I, Duke of Normandy, by his mistress Herleva.\n\n(Many thanks to Margaret Odrowaz-Sypniewska, B.F.A for her research into the Patton Family.)\n\nThe name has been spelled Patten, Peyton (Irish), Patton, Pattin, Paton (Scottish), Paidein (Gaelic)\n\nIn The Surnames of Scotland, it states that the name was from Pat, a diminutive of Patrick. The French diminutive suffix was \"on.\" I tend to lean towards this explanation because my Patten Y-DNA indicates Scandanavian links and as such supports my theory that the Patten Family assisted in the invasion of England in 1066 and as such would have launched from Normandy (France) into England and as such been exposed in part, if not in total to the French Language.\n\nThe Ancestry.com website stated that Patten means \"the seller of clogs.\" As in Middle English, Patin meant \"clog.\" This is interesting as if \"clog\" has the same meaning as the Dutch \"Clog\" it is interesting to note that Matthew \"The Martyr\" Patton was also a Shoe Maker.\n\nVIsit Angelfire Website\n\nThe Patten Family Crest was Patten English: the griffin's head erased, vert. Motto: Nulla pallescere culpa to turn pale at no crime or \"Never made pale with guilt.\"[Fairbairn, James].\n\nThe following is taken from\n\nTHE PATTEN FAMILIES\n\nGENEALOGIES OF THE PATTENS\n\nfrom the North of Ireland, usually called \"Scotch-Irish\"\n\nWith some branches of English ancestry settling in Maine and New Hampshire\n\nBy HOWARD PARKER MOORE IIMem!Jer New H a mpshire Historical So ci e t y\n\nAuthor of The LANG FAMILY, {I9J5)\n\nEDWARDS BROTHERS, INC.\n\nANN ARBOR , MICHIGAN\n\n(1 9 3 9.)\n\nBardsley in his \"Dictionary of English and Welsh Surnames\" (1901). He quotes Burke's historical matter and adds, as to Richard of Dagenham, \"from him the Pattens of Bank Hall, Lancashire claim lineal descent.\" As to the origin of the name, Patten, he quotes Lower's \"Patronymica Britianica\" (1860) as being derived from the \"son of Patrick, from the nickname Pat or Pate, the diminutive being Patt-in or Patt-en, v. Paton and Pattison. Bardsley dogmatizes \"I do not assert that this is true or false. All I say is that the Scottish or North English Pattens have no local derivation but are sons of Patrick.\"\n\nMeaning we venture to presume that Patten is not a \"place-name\" and that it is derived from Patrick.\n\nHarrison in his \"Surnames in the United Kingdom\" (1918) referring to Paton, Patten, Pattin says that \"the names are so common in the North of England that there must be another source beside the French name.\" His construction of the name follows Lower and Bardsley as coming from the old Teutonic base \"Pato\" which he says is \"probably a diminutive of Patrick with the French\n\nsuffix \"on.\"\n\nPerhaps the latest of these erudite gentlemen and scholars, not willing to ' break with such illustrious authorities as Lower and Bardsley in pontificating as to Patrick, was throwing out a hint of \"another source\" in a possible origin of Patten as an occupation name, that is, what the man did for a living.\n\nPattens, wooden shoes or clogs had been in general use for hundreds of years as a substitute for leather in cold and wet occupations, even by priests on the stone floors of churches (vide Bardsley's reference to the period 1464 A.D. and also the use of pattens by gentlemen generally.\n\nSuch clogs were often made of aspen wood, as being the lightest obtainable.\n\nThere is a London guild of Patten makers which has come down from ancient days. It is well known that to this day thousands of peasants in France and the Low Countries habitually use pattens, for the same reasons that their remote ancestors did. But as authorities seem to favor a derivation from \"pato\" as a form of Patrick with a French termination \"en\" or \"in\" it is, of course, inevitable that we go along and not conjecture as to whether the Pattens were named from the wooden shoes or the wooden shoes named from the Pattens. To a layman, however, the word seems good old Anglo-Saxon, or perhaps, Norman, any way an occupation name.\n\n.\n\nCir 1100: Richard resided at Patten House, Chelmsford, Essex, England. Whilst this is a photo of Samuel Cupples House at St. Louis University in St. Louis, Missouri. It is representative of the Romanesque Style of housing at the time and may provide the Reader as to some understanding as to the appearance Patten House in Chelmsford.\n\nRichard married someone.\n\nHis child was:\n\n+ 3 i. Richard PATTEN II of Patten House - Chelmsford was born before 1119."
