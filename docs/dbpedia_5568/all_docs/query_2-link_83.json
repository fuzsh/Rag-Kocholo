Patton and his journey through World War II. After the United States enters the war, Patton is sent to lead American forces on the battlefield in North Africa. After a string of successful battles, he is eventually given command of the newly formed Third U.S. Army and leads them toward victory against German forces in France and Germany. Throughout his campaigns, Patton experiences both triumph and tragedy as he fights for freedom and justice for his country.\n\nOne fun fact about this movie is that it was the first film released with Dolby Stereo sound. This revolutionary feature made it one of the most immersive and realistic war films ever created at that time, further enhancing its realism and impact on audiences around the world. In addition to its groundbreaking sound design, Patton also won seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay as well as an Oscar for George C. Scott's portrayal of General Patton himselfâthough Scott famously refused to accept it in protest against what he saw as \"the whole absurdity\" of competitive awards ceremonies in general.\n\nFox records indicate that in order to reach a break-even point, the film needed to generate $22,525,000 in theatrical rentals. However, by December 11, 1970, it had already surpassed this target, making $27,650,000 and resulting in a profit for the studio. Ultimately, the film garnered worldwide rentals of $45 million, with $28.1 million coming from the United States and Canada, from a total gross of $61.8 million.\n\nPatton Locations\n\nThe movie Patton, released in 1970, was filmed across multiple locations and countries. While the majority of scenes were filmed in the United States and the United Kingdom, other locations used for the production of this classic film included Spain, Morocco, Greece, and Sicily. Spanning from the majestic Royal Palace of Madrid to Cabo de Gata's ocean-filled landscape, each regionâs specific backdrop helped anchor and add depth to this timeless masterpiece. Spain alone hosted numerous scenes that have made an indelible mark in cinematic history.\n\nFrom La Granja's lush green hills to La Alcazaba's fortified castle walls, the country added an artistic flair that helped bring the story alive. The sweeping views of Morocco as well as its more mountainous regions served as perfect backdrops for some of George C. Scott's iconic moments. Similarly in Greece, viewers were able to get a glimpse into some of the more eclectic scenes Patton had to offer with historical sites like The Greek Theatre at Epidaurus being showcased on-screen.\n\nA trip to these various filming locations would be a worthwhile excursion for any film buff or lover of culture alike. From sandy beaches lined with crystal-clear waters in Spain, to captivating coastal views found in Morocco and Greece, these destinations can serve as living reminders of one of Hollywood's greatest epics while simultaneously providing travelers with unique insights into our world today.\n\nAddressing an audience of American troops, General George S. Patton (George C. Scott) highlights the significance Americans attribute to triumphant role models while also emphasizing his own expectations for his soldiers to collaborate and fight as a unified team in order to overcome the enemy.\n\nThis scene was filmed at Patriotic Hall, located in downtown Los Angeles. This historic building has served as a symbol of honor and support for veterans for many years. Originally known as Bob Hope Patriotic Hall, it was dedicated by the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors in 1925. One notable organization based at Patriotic Hall is U.S.VETS, a leading nonprofit agency that provides a range of veteran services. They operate within this iconic building, offering a one-stop hub for veterans to access the support they need.\n\nIf you find yourself traveling to the bustling city of Los Angeles, chances are you'll run into the task of navigating through its vast streets. But don't worry, finding your way to this Patton filming location is easy. To get there, youâre looking at a short drive of around three miles from downtown LA.\n\nGeneral Patton and King Muhammed V of Morocco review the Moroccan troops, including the Goumiers. The Goumiers, renowned for their fighting skills, were tribal warriors who gained a great reputation as soldiers during World War II.\n\nThis scene was filmed at the Royal Palace of Rabat in Morocco. Also known as Dar al-Makhzen, the palace is the primary and official residence of the King of Morocco in Rabat. Situated in the commune of Touarga, this majestic palace stands as a symbol of Moroccan art and architecture. Surrounded by a magnificent park and government offices, the palace creates a grand impression with its intricate design and impressive entrance guarded by mounted royal guards. Built in 1864 on the ruins of the old royal palace, the Royal Palace of Rabat holds great historical significance in Morocco. Today, it serves as the seat of government and an important landmark in the capital city.\n\nThe best way to get to the Royal Palace is by taxi, which are readily available throughout the city. Simply hop in and give the driver the address and they will take you straight there. If you prefer public transportation, you can take a bus or a tram, both of which have stops near the palace.\n\nThis scene portrays the unforgiving conditions of the desert. The \"Cold, sir\" dialogue highlights the extreme temperature variations experienced in desert environments. It showcases the contrast between the brutal reality of war and the contemplative moments that characters like General Patton experience in such inhospitable terrain.\n\nNestled along the southeastern coast of Spain lies a natural paradise like no other, Cabo de Gata, which is where this scene was filmed. This stunning biosphere reserve boasts a rugged coastline lined with towering cliffs, hidden coves, and sweeping beaches that stretch for miles. Known for its vibrant marine life, crystal-clear waters and unique volcanic formations, Cabo de Gata offers a wealth of activities for adventurous travelers. From hiking, kayaking, and snorkeling to simply soaking up the Mediterranean sun, this idyllic destination has something to offer everyone.\n\nGetting to this peaceful paradise may seem daunting, but fear not! There are various ways to reach Cabo de Gata, ensuring that youâll find one that suits your travel style and budget. If you prefer public transportation, you can take a bus from Almeria City to San Jose, a town located in the heart of Cabo de Gata, and then take a taxi or rent a bike to get around.\n\nFollowing the triumph of the Allied forces in North Africa, General Patton and Field Marshal Montgomery (Michael Bates) devise rival strategies for the invasion of Sicily. Inspired by his study of the ancient Peloponnesian War, Patton emphasizes the significance of capturing Syracuse. He recognizes that if an occupying force gained control of the city, it would likely compel the Italian forces to withdraw.\n\nSituated in the heart of the Spanish capital, the Royal Palace of Madrid, or Palacio Real de Madrid, stands as a magnificent architectural masterpiece. Its grandeur and beauty are unparalleled, capturing the essence of regal opulence. With its grandiose presence and rich history, it stands as one of the most iconic landmarks in Madrid. Built in the 18th century, the Royal Palace serves as the official residence of the Spanish royal family. However, it primarily functions as a venue for state ceremonies, official receptions, and cultural events.\n\nVisiting the Royal Palace of Madrid is an experience that shouldn't be missed during a trip to the Spanish capital. Getting there is easy and there are several options available. If you prefer walking, it's a scenic and enjoyable 20-minute stroll from the Puerta del Sol, the city's main square. Alternatively, you can take one of the city's many buses or metros. The Opera metro station, located right next to the palace, is the most convenient stop.\n\nGeneral Patton is depicted driving up to an ancient city that is implied to be Carthage. The scene is set against a backdrop of rugged terrain, with dusty roads winding their way up toward the towering ruins of the city. As General Patton's vehicle ascends the steep incline, the camera captures the awe-inspiring sight of massive stone walls adorned with intricate carvings and remnants of ancient architecture.\n\nThis scene was filmed at the Conservation du site ArchÃ©ologique de Volubilis, an important attraction and archaeological site located in Morocco. It is renowned for its well-preserved Roman ruins and is considered one of the most significant archaeological sites in the country. Archaeological excavations have been ongoing since the early 20th century, with only half of the site currently uncovered. The discoveries made at Volubilis have been of exceptional quality and significance.\n\nIf you're driving, simply head north from the city of Meknes and follow signs for Volubilis. Visitors can also take a shared taxi from Meknes or book a guided tour which typically includes transportation.\n\nAfter Germany surrenders, Patton finds himself in trouble yet again due to his outspoken nature when he draws a comparison between American politics and Nazism. As a result, he loses his command once more. However, due to his expertise, he is retained to oversee the reconstruction of Germany during the post-war era. The movie ends with a final scene showing Patton walking his bull terrier named Willie.\n\nThe RiofrÃ­o Royal Palace, located in the enclave of San Ildefonso in Segovia, Spain, is a magnificent architectural gem surrounded by over 600 hectares of lush forest. Built in the 18th century, the palace is known for its unity of style and grandeur. Constructed by King Ferdinand VI of Spain, the RiofrÃ­o Royal Palace served as both a hunting pavilion and a retreat for the royal family. Its purpose was to provide a tranquil space for the widowed Queen Isabella de Farnesio, the stepmother of King Ferdinand VI.\n\nSituated around six miles from Segovia, the palace offers a range of transport options for visitors. One of the easiest ways to get there is by car; there is ample parking available for those arriving by vehicle. Alternatively, you can take a local bus or cab from Segovia and enjoy the scenic view of the Sierra de Guadarrama Mountains on your journey."
