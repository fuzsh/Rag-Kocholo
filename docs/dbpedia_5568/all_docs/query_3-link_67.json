DANIEL PATTON.\n\nMy parents were Scotch-Irish, born, raised and married in Ireland; where they had 5 children. My father was a Presbyterian, O.S., was in the Irish rebellion, in the days of Robert Emmett; two of his grand-fathers were in the battle of the Boine, in 1690, under King William. My father was a devout Christian, and lover of civil and religious liberty. I, his eight son, was born in Wilkes county, North Carolina, January 8th, 1799. Eight years after my birth, my father and family removed to Bedford county, Tennessee, where he died in 1815. I made a public profession of religion in the 20th year of my age,\n\nunder the preaching of Cumberland Presbyterian ministers. Shortly afterwards, I entered into the work of the ministry in the C.P. church. Rev. R. D. King and myself, formed, and traveled, the first circuit in south Alabama formed by Cumberland Presbyterians, shortly after the Creek Indian war. Much of our traveling was done on the Indian trails. I removed to this State, (Missouri) in the fall of 1826, a poor man, as to earthly substanceshaving a wife and 2 children. Settled in 1 mile of where Richmond, Ray county, now stands, helped husk corn which grew where the Court House now stands. I believe I preached the first sermon ever preached in Richmond and the first in Carrolton. I removed to Clay county, Mo., where I still reside, in the fall of 1844, being strongly urged to do so by the C. Presbyterians of the county. So far as politics are concerned, I read, and thought, formed my own opinions, and always tried to act, in accordance with the fundamental principles of our government. I never meddled with politics in the Pulpit. I passed through the scathing wicked war, gotten up by wicked men, which has well neigh destroyed the best Government in the world. I acted in elections as a voter, and voted the Whig ticket. I have not tried to vote since the base requirement of the qualifying Oath. If in principle, and fact, I was ever entitled to vote, I am so entitled yet. Therefore, knowing the character of the men who have usurped authority to sit in judgment on me I never go to the polls. I am now nearly 72 years old, have been preaching 50 years. I would make any sacrifice a good man could make to see my county reinstated to its former happy state.\n\nThis at your service respectfully. DANIEL PATTON.\n\nLiberty Weekly Tribune September 23, 1870\n\nTHE OLD MEN OF CLAY COUNTY\n\nLiberty Weekly Tribune; Date: 1870 Sep 23\n\nWe request every citizen in Clay county, over sixty years of age, to send us\n\nhis name, age, place and date of birth, disfranchised or not, and any prominent\n\ncircumstances connected with his life.\n\nhttp://files.usgwarchives.org/mo/clay/newspapers/theoldme56gnw.txt\n\nPlease Send Additions/Corrections to the Archives Updated April 14, 2010"
