Everyone knows this is nowhere — or do they? We visit one of the more remote, but interesting ballparks in pro baseball: Skylands Park, the home of the Sussex Skyhawks. Mark Cryan tells us what makes this ballpark unique and worth a visit:

Welcome to the middle of nowhere. Sussex County, New Jersey, is tucked away in the northern tip of the state near the New York state line. It s not Bruce Springsteen’s gritty urban Jersey, but rather rolling hills and pastures. The ballpark, the former home of the New Jersey Cardinals, sits at the crossroads of NJ Routes 206 and 565, in sight of a pair of restaurants and a barn or two. This part of New Jersey is called the Skylands, and it fits, as there is little to distract you from the wide-open vistas. There are several picturesque little towns on the way to the park, although none is close enough or large enough to really be the team’s home own. Hence, the “New Jersey,” and now “Sussex” names.
