His coaching career began in 2003 as the hitting coach for the Erie SeaWolves. From 2006 on, Incaviglia has managed every team he’s been on including the Grand Prairie AirHogs, Sugar Land Skeeters, and Laredo Lemurs. The Lemurs were a part of the American Association League during Incavigilia’s tenure where they won the championship in 2015. The Railroaders hired Incaviglia on Oct. 8, 2023.\n\nBorn in Pebble Beach, California, Incaviglia was drafted in the 10th round of the 1982 MLB Amateur Draft by the San Francisco Giants out of Monterey High School but decided to play college baseball instead at Oklahoma State University. In 3 seasons with the Cowboys, he hit 100 home runs and had a slugging percentage of .915. His final year in Stillwater, Oklahoma was historic as he hit 48 home runs on a 1.140 slugging percentage.

He was inducted into the College Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nIncaviglia was drafted once again in the 1985 MLB draft.

Under the Orioles and Reds minor league system, he played five seasons in the minors and finished his pro career with a record of 37-38, an ERA of 3.75, 31 complete games, and 437 strikeouts.

He’s credited with the development of big league hitters such as Jeff Bagwell, Ivan Rodriguez, Mark Teixeira, and Michael Young. He was the first coach in Rangers history to serve more than eight seasons for their major league coaching staff.
