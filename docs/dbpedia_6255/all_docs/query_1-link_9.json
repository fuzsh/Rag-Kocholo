        "text": "By ADAM REGAN\n\naregan@njherald.com\n\nThe stories that define the Sussex County sports scene each year never fail to excite and compel its loyal fan base. Throughout the years, the memories generated by championships -- both expected and unexpected -- will never be duplicated.\n\nRarely is there a year where a story's significance stretches beyond a scrapbook. This past year brought two such stories.\n\nOne will change the landscape of high school athletics in the county forever, while the other reversed a losing culture that has spanned 13 years.\n\nIt's no wonder both stories top the list of the Herald's Top 5 Sports Stories of 2008.\n\n1) Realignment disbands SCIL: It took 12 years, but former Wallkill Valley athletic director Mike Van Zile and a small team of other athletic directors and principals from North Jersey, who yearned for competitive balance in the state's high school athletics, finally made it happen.\n\nThe New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association Leagues and Conferences Realignment Committee's plan to disband 13 of the state's 21 conferences, including the SCIL, in all sports was approved Oct. 8 by a 30-5 vote.\n\nThe North Jersey Region, which contains 170 member schools in 11 different conferences, will be realigned into four \"Super Conferences\" predicated upon school size, geography and balanced competition starting at the beginning of the 2009-10 school year.\n\nAfter 33 years of existence, the SCIL will be chopped in half. Under the latest model, the area's Group I and II schools -- Jefferson, Hopatcong, Lenape Valley, Kittatinny, Wallkill Valley, Newton, Sussex Tech and Hackettstown -- will be placed in Division C of the Northwest Jersey Athletic Conference.\n\nMeanwhile, larger schools Vernon, High Point and Sparta along with non-public Pope John will play in Division A of the conference against schools like Roxbury, Randolph, Morris Knolls and Mount Olive. The groupings have yet to be finalized.\n\nThe announcement called for celebration from the smaller schools that believed there to be a lack of a competitive balance when they were forced to play against bigger schools. For the most part, the Group III and Group IV schools agreed and looked forward to competing against schools there own size.\n\nHowever, High Point still is not on board, citing increased travel that will cut into a focus on academics.\n\nLike it or not, change is coming.\n\n2) Skyhawks win Can-Am League championship: It had been 14 years since the New Jersey Cardinals changed their official address to 94 Championship Way in Augusta after winning the New York Penn League title.\n\nThat was followed by 13 years of futility from the Cardinals and the Sussex Skyhawks.\n\nFinding someone to acknowledge the existence of professional baseball in Sussex County during that time were few and far between.\n\nThat task became a bit more difficult following the Skyhawks' sweep of Quebec in the Can-Am championship series in September.\n\nCan-Am Manager of the Year Hal Lanier and a group of players who prided themselves on being picked off the scrap heap posted a 52-42 overall record and hit .284 as a team.\n\nThe Skyhawks were paced by first baseman Matt Weston, who finished with a .299 average and 22 home runs, and center fielder Ron Perodin, who led a cast of four players who hit better than .300.\n\n3) Jefferson wins its third state football title: Jefferson players kept a chip on each of their shoulders for an entire calendar year. The memory of a 40-0 loss to River Dell in the first round of the state playoffs last season served as a constant motivator as the Falcons triumphed this season.\n\nBehind a balanced offense and an intimidating defense, the Falcons finished the season 11-1 with a North I, Group II sectional title to show for it.\n\nHerald Player of the Year Kevin Murphy led the SCIL in rushing and set a school record for career tackles during a season where the Falcons shared a piece of the league title with Sparta and Jefferson.\n\nTheir run through a tough league only set the table for a magical championship run. After downing league foe Lenape Valley in the first round, the Falcons had the rare task of dethroning two straight defending sectional champions -- River Dell by a 19-7 score in the semi-finals and West Essex, 21-6, in the finals at Rutgers Stadium, putting an end to a dream season.\n\n4) Valenti wins state wrestling title: Sussex County couldn't go without an individual state wrestling champ, could it?\n\nNot on Derek Valenti's watch.\n\nThe Kittatinny senior defeated Wallkill Valley's Kodie Silvestri in the 130-pound state final in Atlantic City to bring home the county's only individual state title.\n\nWith the win, Valenti ended a 44-2 season where he had to beat Silvestri, his best friend, five times out of six.\n\nThe Herald's Athlete of the Year also stepped out of the shadow of his brothers, Andy and Matt, a two-time state champion.\n\nNowadays, when he returns to Cougar Country, he is no longer referred to as Matt or Andy's brother. It's just Derek Valenti -- state champion.\n\n5) Kittatinny's thrilling run comes up short: Since 1991, Sussex County hasn't produced a state softball champion. While that still is the case, Kittatinny gave it all it had to cast off the 17-year hex.\n\nAlthough the Cougars came up one run short in the Group II final against Sterling in Toms River, it took nothing away from the team's magical run.\n\nAfter being forced to share a piece of the SCIL title with Jefferson, the Cougars (20-7) never looked back. They reeled off five straight victories in the state tournament, getting a clutch hit from a different player each game.\n\nFranny Gely slammed a triple off Rutherford in the state semi-finals to bring the Cougars one step away from a state title.\n\nOnly a bloop single and a few shots that fell just short of clearing the fence kept Kittatinny from a state title.\n\nA small footnote on an otherwise phenomenal season."
