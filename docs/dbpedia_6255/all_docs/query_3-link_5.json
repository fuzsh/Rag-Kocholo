        "text": "The practice of deriving sports team names, imagery, and mascots from Indigenous peoples of North America is a significant phenomenon in the United States and Canada. The popularity of stereotypical representations of American Indians in global culture has led to a number of teams in Europe also adopting team names derived from Native Americans. While there are team names in North America derived from other ethnic groups, such as the Boston Celtics, the New York Yankees, the Montreal Canadiens, and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, these are names selected by groups to represent themselves.\n\nGlobally, there are teams in Africa and Europe that use Native American images and logos, while in South America there are a number of teams that reference the Guaraní people. In Brazil, these teams may be referred to using the derogatory term bugre.[1] However, the adoption of Indigenous names in Asia, Africa, Australia and South America may indicate that the team members are themselves Indigenous.\n\nThe rise of Indigenous rights movements has led to controversy regarding the continuation of practices rooted in colonialism.[2] Such practices maintain the power relationship between the dominant culture and the Indigenous culture, and can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism.[3] Such practices are seen as particularly harmful in schools and universities, which have the stated purpose of promoting ethnic diversity and inclusion.[4] In recognition of the responsibility of higher education to eliminate behaviors that creates a hostile environment for education, in 2005 the NCAA initiated a policy against \"hostile and abusive\" names and mascots that led to the change of many derived from Native American culture, with the exception of those that established an agreement with particular tribes for the use of their specific names. Other schools retain their names because they were founded for the education of Native Americans, and continue to have a significant number of Indigenous students.\n\nThe trend towards the elimination of Indigenous names and mascots in local schools has been steady, with two thirds having been eliminated over the past 50 years according to the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI).[5] In a few states with significant Native American populations, change has been mandated by law, such in Maine,[6] Wisconsin,[7] Oregon,[8] and Washington.[9][10]\n\nLittle League International has updated its 2019 rulebook to include a statement prohibiting \"the use of team names, mascots, nicknames or logos that are racially insensitive, derogatory or discriminatory in nature.\"[11] This decision has been applauded by the National Congress of American Indians.[12]\n\nBristol Aztecs (British American Football League) - Bristol, England\n\nBürstadt Redskins, an American Football club in Bürstadt, Germany\n\nEberswalder Warriors, an American Football club in Eberswalde, Germany\n\nGarland Aztecs, Garland, Texas - Semi-Pro\n\nMayas CDMX (Liga de Fútbol Americano Profesional) - Mexico City, Mexico\n\nMexicas CDMX (Liga de Fútbol Americano Profesional) - Mexico City, Mexico\n\nKansas City Chiefs (NFL) - While adopting Native American imagery, the team was named in honor of Kansas City mayor Harold Roe Bartle who was instrumental in bringing the AFL Dallas Texans to Kansas City in 1963 (becoming the last professional team to adopt an Indigenous-derived name). Bartle earned his nickname as founder of the Tribe of Mic-O-Say, a regional Boy Scouts honor camping society in which he was \"Chief\" Lone Bear. In 1989, the Chiefs switched from Warpaint, a Pinto horse ridden by a man in a feathered headdress, to their current mascot K. C. Wolf. Warpaint returned in 2009, but is ridden by a cheerleader.[13]\n\nSouthern California Apaches - (Semi-Pro, United Football Alliance League)\n\nFlorida State Seminoles (American College Football) NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Atlantic Division of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC)\n\nUtah Utes (American College Football) NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the South Division of the Pac-12 Conference (Pac-12)\n\nNew Jersey Savage\n\nSpanktown Boyz - Uses a Native American wielding a tomahawk as its logo\n\nUnion City Chiefs\n\nBelgium\n\nK.A.A.
