As Coach Adam Thomas’s right hand man, Vick oversees all aspects of the Pirate offense and serves as the infield coach, as well. Under his guidance, the Pirates led the Alabama Community College Conference in nearly every meaningful offensive and defensive statistical category in 2017, while helping guide the Pirates to a number 4 national ranking, en route to leading the conference and country in wins (46) during the regular season, as well as capturing the ACCC Southern Division Championship.\n\nVick previously spent the 2014-16 seasons as the volunteer assistant coach at Auburn University, working primarily with the team’s infielders. Under the direction of Vick, Auburn’s defense improved mightily in his first two seasons on the Plains. After meeting the previous team-best mark of .970 in 2014, Auburn’s defense established a new program record with a fielding percentage of .973 during the 2015 season.\n\nVick brought four years of collegiate coaching experience and three years of coaching in the professional ranks to the Tigers’ staff when he joined prior to the 2014 season. In 2013, he helped lead Central Alabama Community College to the NJCAA National Championship as an assistant. He spent two seasons at CACC, while along with capturing the 2013 national title, he was key in the Trojans climb as high as number 2 in the NJCAA national rankings in 2012. During his tenure with Central Alabama, the Trojans posted an 86-26 record.\n\nPrior to CACC, he was an assistant coach for two years at East Central Community College in Decatur, Mississippi. While there, he helped the team’s defense set a new school record with a .972 fielding percentage in 2010, which was the top fielding mark in the nation.\n\nIn addition to all of the on field team success during his collegiate coaching tenure, 28 of Vick’s former players are currently playing professional baseball.\n\nFollowing a four-year professional playing career, Vick coached professionally for three different independent league teams as an infield and hitting coach. He coached the Pensacola Pelicans (American Association) in 2008, the Coastal Kingfish (Continental League) in 2009, and the Sussex Skyhawks (Can-Am League) in 2010.\n\nCoach Vick played professionally for four seasons, including three years in the Tampa Bay Devil Rays organization. He played collegiately at the University of West Florida, where he started all 109 games for the Argonauts over his final two seasons, hitting .376 as a senior in 2004 with 20 doubles, three triples, 6 Homeruns, and 29 RBI in 192 at-bats. Vick began his collegiate career in the Alabama Community College Conference, where he played his first two years of college baseball at Faulkner State Community College.\n\nA native of Thomasville, Ala., he is married to Lauren Leigh Vick. The couple has a son, Cameron and Daughter, Charleigh."
