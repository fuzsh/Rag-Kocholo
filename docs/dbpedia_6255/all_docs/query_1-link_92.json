        "text": "I drove Kate back to Albany after Mother’s Day lunch on Sunday, and it so happened that the Tri-City Valley Cats were hosting the Trois-Rivières Aigles in a Frontier League tilt at 5pm.\n\nBy this point, I’m sure you’ve figured out that the Aigles are based in Quebec, Canada. I think it is cool to get a lineup card from a team from a different country.\n\nSurprising by Frontier League standards, the game was a pitching duel for the first 7 innings, with the Valley Cats leading, 2-1.\n\nThe Valley Cats went to the bullpen in the 8th inning, and that did not work out well. The Aigles scored six times, and coasted from there to a 7-3 win.\n\nMy lineup card plan was to hit the umpires first, then the dugout of the winning team.\n\nAs recently as last season, the umpires at Joseph L. Bruno Stadium headed up the stands to their locker room. I was where I needed to be as the game ended.\n\nBut I quickly realized the umpires were instead exiting through Tri City’s dugout. That’s probably better for the umpires, but not good for me. Plan A went down the tubes. Sacré bleu!\n\nI was right by the Tri-City dugout, so I decided to peek in as a Plan B but did not see manager Pete Incaviglia, a good MLB player back in the day. The Aigles were finishing their post-game high-5 celebration, so I hustled over to their dugout, for Plan C, and my last shot at scoring a lineup card from the game. Thankfully, their manager was nice enough to give me their dugout card.\n\nA couple names of note on the lineup card:\n\nCito Culver of the Valley Cats was a 1st round pick of the Yankees as a 17-year old back in 2010. Culver made it as far as Tiple-A, but left affiliated ball after the 2018 season.\n\nAaron Altherr, also on the Tri-City team, played parts of 6 seasons in MLB\n\nFinally, a picture that serves as a reminder of the less-fun side of independent league ball.\n\nMy assumption is that the person sleeping next to the bus is the bus driver. The Aigles were to head to Chicago after the game for their next series, a solid 12-hour drive from the Albany area. Good for the bus driver for catching some ZZZZ’s before the long haul.\n\nThe Aigles-Valley Cats game was my 15th of 2023, and first minor league game. I’ve gotten lineup cards at 13 of the games, and have a total of 25 for the year.\n\nI took Thursday afternoon off to head up to Albany to see Kate who is going to school in the area, and also to take in the first game of a DH between the host Tri-City (TC) ValleyCats and New Jersey (NJ) Jackals.\n\nFortunately, Kate was able to come with me, and we made the 10-minute drive from her apartment to Joseph L. Bruno Stadium.\n\nTC is one of the former MiLB affiliates that got left at the curb last year when MLB decided to decrease the number of MiLB teams.\n\nIt’s a shame because TC finished 63rd and 69th, respectively, in attendance — out of 160 teams — in its final two years in MiLB. So it’s not as if the greater Albany community wasn’t supporting the team.\n\nWe only stayed for the first game of the DH on Thursday, and while the stadium was largely empty for the 4pm start…\n\n…it started to fill in nicely by the time G1 ended. Checking the box score, the announced crowd was 3,200+, very impressive for Indy ball.\n\nThe ValleyCats are in a dog fight for the division title with Équipe Québec, and beat NJ, 5-2, in the first 7-inning game.\n\nThat was good because I was most interested in the TC dugout card.\n\nWhen the game ended, I first headed to where the umpires exited the field. Why? Because the most notable person for either team was TC manager Pete Incaviglia, a former MLB player of 12 years, and Baseball America’s college baseball “Player of the Century” for the 20th century after Inky posted ridiculous stats in his college career at Oklahoma State.\n\nAs manager, Inky would sign his official batting order card, and I thought it’d be cool to get the card with his signature.\n\nThe home plate umpire obliged, handing me both teams’ batting order cards. here they are, with TC’s card to the right.\n\nGranted, it’s a carbon copy, but it’s still great to get Inky’s autograph on a lineup card.\n\nNext, I hustled over to TC’s dugout and asked Inky for his dugout card, which he was happy to give me.\n\nIt’s a nice looking lineup card, especially by independent league standards.\n\nKate and I took off after that, with me dropping her off at school and me making the 2+ hour drive back to Connecticut.\n\nThe three lineup cards on the night get us to 30 on the season, a nice milestone number to hit. It was also the 10th stadium I’ve been to this season, and we’ve gotten at least one card from each stadium.\n\nI’ll be honest, whether or not a team is likely (or unlikely) to give me a lineup card after a game often plays a big role in who I’m rooting for. It’s a lot more fun to ask the winning manager for a lineup card than the losing manager.\n\nIn that vein, my allegiance Monday night was squarely with Équipe Québec (EQ) in its Frontier League matchup with the New York Boulders at Palisades Credit Union Park.\n\nEQ gave me its lineup card a few weeks ago when Sean and I saw them beat the Sussex County Miners. The Boulders did not give me their lineup card earlier this season after a win because the manager keeps it.\n\nIt did not look good early on as the Boulders jumped out to a 5-0 lead through five innings before a sparse crowd.\n\nTo make matters worse for EQ, there’s a dead heat for the Frontier Lg Atlantic Division crown, with Tri-City up 1 game over EQ, and the Boulders just a game back of EQ entering the game.\n\nDown but not out, EQ managed to score a run and have a pair of runners on with one out T6. The EQ batter hit what should have been a fairly routine pop-up to short left field, but NY shortstop Phil Caulfield dropped what should have been the second out, allowing another run to score.\n\nEQ would add two more runs in the frame to pull within 5-4.\n\nEQ tied the game T8 on a home run, and it should have stayed that way heading into B8 but for another Caulfield error. Gift Ngoepe, the first native of continental Africa to reach the Major Leagues earlier in his career, hit what should have been an inning-ending double-play ball to Caulfield, but Caulfield booted the ball, allowing the runners to go to second and third. EQ would score three more runs for an 8-5 lead.\n\nEQ led 10-6 heading into B9. NY got its first two batters on board, but went softly into the night from there with three straight outs to end the game.\n\nSuffice it to say, the EQ manager was visibly elated about the win, and happily gave me the lineup card.\n\nA couple thoughts: 1) I love that the card is dated in French; EQ is a French Canadian team, so very fitting! 2) I also love that one of the EQ coaches keeps score for the EQ batters, and pitch counts.\n\nYou’ll notice the ball in the picture. I got one foul ball during the game. There were a few ballhawks at the game, including Teigue, Matt and Kyle who I got to meet. Teigue made a sweet on-the-fly catch of a home run during the game.\n\nThis was lineup card #26 on the season, surpassing 2019’s total. Getting the card made for a more enjoyable ride home despite the late night.\n\nSean and I headed to New Jersey for a Frontier League double-header between Équipe Québec and the Sussex County Miners at Skylands Stadium.\n\nÉquipe Québec is presumably a one-season team due to Covid border restrictions with players from the Quebec Capitales and Trois-Rivières Aigles. As of July 30, the team will be able to start hosting games in Canada.\n\nBetween the fact that this wasn’t supposed to be a Sussex home game and the fact that it was an early starting DH, I figure there wouldn’t be much of a crowd, especially early. I was right.\n\nSean sat down the first base line while I wandered over to the third base side. I scored our first ball of the day on a foul ball to the empty seats between home and third. I’d get one more during the first game while Sean also scored two, including a ground-rule double that he went beyond the OF wall to get.\n\nÉquipe Québec blew an early two-run lead but scored five in the 5th inning to win the 7-inning game, 7-4.\n\nSean was ignored by the Sussex Miners trying for their dugout lineup card, but the Équipe Québec manager was nice enough to hook me up with his card.\n\nOn the good side, the lineup card is full size (11 x 17) and has a watermark, all be it faint. It also has the Frontier League logo. On the downside, it’s paper instead of light cardboard.\n\nWe stayed for the first couple innings of the second game, chasing down three more balls before a storm started to roll in. We weren’t planning to stay until the end anyway, so we got out before the storm, which ended suspending the game until the next day.\n\nThe lineup card was our 20th of the season, and yet another card from an international team to add to the collection.\n\nChasing lineup cards isn’t all peaches & cream. It often involves long drives, late nights and disappointment.\n\nI hit games on back-to-back nights earlier this week.\n\nThe first stop was Dunkin’ Donuts Park for a Richmond Flying Squirrels at Hartford Yard Goats game.\n\nThe forecast was for rain until game time, and dry after that. But the rain lasted a little longer, and the game was delayed about 80 minutes.\n\nI waited until last minute and found a ticket for one of DDP’s suites for $12. Why not!\n\nIt was my first game from a suite. The suites also give access to the YG Club.\n\nThe view from the suite seats was pretty sweet, too.\n\nThe Yard Goats lost again, 7-1. They have lost all three times I have seen them play.\n\nI tried for the Richmond lineup card which also gave me a chance to get the umpire batting order cards.\n\nI went 0-for-2.\n\nThe home plate umpire said no, and the Richmond manager says they keep both their dugout and batting order cards.\n\nIt stunk to stay at the park ’til after 11pm and come home empty handed, but I did get to sit in a suite seat, so all is good.\n\nThe next evening, I had reason to be in northern New Jersey, near Yogi Berra Stadium where the New Jersey Jackals play. And the Jackals were hosting the New York Boulders in a Frontier League matchup.\n\nUntil this season, the closest Frontier League team to us was nearly 500 miles away. But the Frontier League absorbed three nearby (within about 2 hours) NY/NJ teams, and have now added a forth just outside of Albany.\n\nKate and I went to our one and only Frontier League game on a road trip four years ago, getting a few 25th anniversary Frontier Lg baseballs and dugout lineup cards for both teams: https://lineupcards.wordpress.com/2017/07/18/71317-71517-road-trip-part-2/\n\nSo It hit my send-ever Frontier League game. After a late night the day before, I could’ve used a nice 2:40 game, or something like that, considering I still had a solid 1:45 to get home.\n\nIt didn’t happen. Not even close.\n\nThe game went 10 innings and took an unreasonable 4:13 thanks in large part to a combined 36 hits and walks. The Boulders won, 10-9.\n\nThere were few people at the game, and the crowd had dwindled to a hundred or so by the end of the game.\n\nI originally planned to chase both teams’ dugout cards. I changed my mind when it looked like the Jackals would lose and decided to try and get the umpire’s batting order cards and the Boulders card. My thinking was that the umpire would probably give me the batting order cards, I wasn’t sure if the losing team would be in a good mood after losing a close game, and as late a night as it was going to be, I wanted to come away with something.\n\nI don’t know if I would’ve gotten the Jackal’s card or not — I saw the manager carrying it out of the dugout as I waited for the umpire — but I’m glad I chose the route I did. The home plate umpire did give me the batting order cards, but I struck out with the Boulders. They keep their dugout card, the coach told me.\n\nI would’ve preferred one or both dugout cards, but snagging the batting order cards saved me from a long, empty-handed ride home!\n\nThe Frontier League announced it is joining forces with the Can-Am League on October 16, although the reality is that the Frontier Lg is absorbing the Can-Am Lg and the Can-Am Lg is now defunct.\n\nAll but one of the current Can-Am Lg teams will play in the Frontier Lg. The Ottawa Champions will not field a team in the Frontier Lg in 2021, although the Frontier Lg did not rule out a Champions return in 2021.\n\nOf specific interest to me, the New Britain Bees will not be one of the teams in the 14-team Frontier Lg that will play in 2020. The Can-Am Lg was thought to be a possible destination for the Bees.\n\nThat leaves the Bees staying in the Atlantic Lg at least one more season, or becoming a collegiate summer league team in either the FCBL or NECBL. I guess it’s also possible that the Bees could join the Empire Professional Baseball Lg, but the Empire Lg is essentially the lowest run of pro ball, and I don’t see that being likely. Maybe there is some other possibility that I am not aware of? Probably not, but we’ll see.\n\nI’m sad to see the Can-Am League go. We’ve gone to 15-20 Can-Am Lg games over the years. My first-ever pro game foul ball snag was at a Sussex Skyhawks game about 15 years ago.\n\nWe scored dugout lineup cards from four of the Can-Am Lg teams, and an official batting order card from another.\n\nOttawa Champions lineup card from 2015; I like the watermark!\n\nWhile it is far more rare that Can-Am players made it to MLB compared to the Atlantic League, Stephen Cardullo of the Rockland Boulders, in the 3-spot in Rockland’s lineup above, played for the Rockies in 2016-2017.\n\nKate and I went to our one and only Frontier Lg game in 2017, scoring Frontier Lg 25th anniversary baseballs and lineup cards from the Florence Freedom and now-defunct Normal Cornbelters.\n\nIt’s nice that we’ll be able to chase more Frontier Lg lineup cards if we want. Three of the teams — Rockland, New Jersey and Sussex — are all about 2 hours from us.\n\nMeanwhile, we’ll continue to wait to see what happens with the Bees.\n\nWe bid farewell to Batavia, NY on Thursday, July 15th and headed west toward Indianapolis.\n\nOn the way, we met up with a friend for lunch at a restaurant that happened to be down the street from Canal Park, home of the Eastern League’s Akron Rubber Ducks. The park was closed but I still took the obligatory pic of Kate outside the stadium.\n\nWe made it to Indianapolis Thursday around 6pm. I had thoughts of maybe making it to the Indianapolis Indians game that night, but Kate needed to help with set up for her team’s robotics competition. Things got delayed by a thunderstorm that dropped a crazy amount of rain, so we didn’t leave until 8:30pm and therefore no game.\n\nThoughts of going to Friday night’s game also went by the wayside as the competition went on until 7:40pm that day. We might have been able to make the last half of the game, but we were pretty exhausted and called it a day.\n\nSaturday was the final day of the robotics competition. Our hope was to leave straight after Kate’s team finished and head to Florence, Kentucky, some two hours away, for our first-ever Frontier League game. If the competition went late, we might catch some of the Indians’ game instead, and drive down to Florence afterward as that is where our hotel was for the night.\n\nKate’s team ended up winning the competition, which was both great as well as a big deal. They celebrated for a while afterward, posing for plenty of pictures. We left about 5:30pm.\n\nI had decided ahead of time that if we left by 6pm, we’d probably get to at least some of the Florence Freedom game. So we headed to Florence, getting to the stadium just before 7:30pm.\n\nThe game had started at 6:05 pm, and was in the top of the 6th inning when we got there.\n\nThe goal had been, and still was, to get one or more Frontier League 25th Anniversary baseballs that are being used this season. Along with our plan to ballhawk, I brought a few Atlantic League 20th Anniversary balls to try and trade.\n\nAs it turned out, bringing the balls to trade was a great idea. In between innings, we traded with both bullpens. We were very appreciative that both team bullpens helped us out because they easily could have said no or ignored us. So we were on the board with a couple Frontier League 25th balls!\n\nWe walked around the outside of the park and found another ball, then traded for two more for a total of five. As it turned out, there were no foul balls hit anywhere near us, so I am really glad we brought balls to trade.\n\nA secondary goal was to get a lineup card from the game. We got two:\n\n…and…\n\nAs an added bonus, here’s the back of the Freedom lineup card:\n\nWe have never gotten anything like this. It’s cool to see the preparation, particularly the level of detail, that goes into a single game.\n\nThe visiting Normal Cornbelters won the game, 2-0.\n\nDays don’t get much better than this one. Kate’s robotics team won its competition, we saw a game (at least part of a game) in a new stadium for us, got a few anniversary balls, and got our first Frontier League lineup cards!\n\n2017: 19 lineup cards (9 dugout/bullpen; 9 “official batting order”; 1 “today’s lineup” card)\n\nLifetime: 140 lineup cards (96 dugout/bullpen; 41 “official batting order”; 2 “relief pitcher usage”; and 1 “today’s lineup”)\n\nLeagues: MLB: American League; National League. MiLB: International League; Eastern League; Carolina League; New York-Penn League; Southern League. Independent Leagues: Atlantic League; Can-Am League; American Association; Frontier League. Colleges: NCAA – America East Conference; NCAA – American Athletic Conference; NCAA – Ivy League; NCAA – Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference; NCAA – Northeast Conference; Cape Cod League; NJCAA – Region XXI; New England Collegiate Baseball League (NECBL); Futures Collegiate Baseball League (FCBL); Cal Ripken Summer Collegiate League. International: World Baseball Classic (qualifying round, 2016).\n\nWe started collecting different baseball two or three years before lineup cards. We are up to about 120 different professional and amateur baseballs, which is great, it just makes it more difficult to find games where balls are used that we don’t already have.\n\nThat said, there should be some opportunities to add a few new baseballs to our collection this season:\n\nMLB: Three MLB commemorative/special balls, not necessarily all from 2016 (pic below is one of a bunch of 2011 MLB ASG balls that Brown University was using as practice balls in 2015!).\n\nMiLB: We are only missing an Arizona League ball and a Northwest League ball. Our best chance of getting one or both this year would be via a trade. Also, we hope to get at least one special/commemorative MiLB ball. The New York-Penn League All Star Game will likely be the best opportunity (pic below of a couple of 2014 MiLB ASG balls).\n\nIndependent League: We already have a Frontier League ball, but the Frontier League also started using a special ball with red-blue laces last year, so it’d be nice to get one of those. There are a few new start-up leagues planned for this season, including the relatively local Empire League.\n\nNCAA: We already added one new Division I conference baseball, the Mountain West Conference, earlier this year, and hope to add at least one other.\n\nCollege Summer League: A couple new ones would be nice, including the Atlantic Collegiate Baseball League.\n\nInternational: One of the four World Baseball Classic 2016 Qualifiers will take place in NY (a pic of the 2012 WBC Qualifier ball is below). Hopefully, one or more of the four teams – Brazil, Great Britain, Israel and Pakistan – will use their own baseballs during warm-ups. Additionally, Cuban and Japanese teams will play locally against Can-Am League teams.\n\nPart 2 will look at our lineup card goals for the 2016 season!"
