        "text": "Poppy Parker - Cape defensive coordinator John Parker goes by the handle “Poppy” if you want to get his quick attention on your CB radio. But don't bother him during a football game because he's got nothing for you. Like all us good old boys, he has selective attention deficit disorder, but when his defense is on the field that attracts all his focus. There will be much written this week about Cape at Sussex Tech featuring two early season undefeated teams with Bill Collick having been the coach of the Ravens for 10 years.\n\nBut it was John Parker as head coach of Sussex Tech football who won a Division 2 state title for the Ravens in 1993. And later at Woodbridge in 1999, Parker led the Raiders to a perfect 10-0 season, beating Delmar on the road in the final game. That was one of the best-coached teams I have ever seen, and with the undefeated season secured, the Woodbridge players went over to the bleachers behind their bench and applauded their own fans. Woodbridge lost to Middletown in the first round; the Cavaliers won three straight state titles in Division 2 from 1997 through 1999.\n\nShowdown about to go down - The undefeated Cape Henlopen field hockey team is 3-0 this young season, having outscored opponents 20-0. The Vikings have not lost a regular-season Henlopen Conference game in three years. Cape travels to undefeated Delmar Tuesday, Sept. 27. The Wildcats are 5-0, having outscored opponents 32-1. The last two seasons, Cape has outscored Delmar 9-1, but three years ago the Cats upset Cape in overtime in the first round of the tournament.\n\nCape will host Sussex Tech at 7 p.m., Thursday, Sept. 29, in the first night game in No Name Stadium. The Ravens have dropped two overtime games, one at Polytech 2-1 and the other a 4-3 home loss to Archmere. Cape has beaten the Ravens the last two regular-season games only to lose to them both times 1-0 in the semifinals of the state tournament.\n\nMegan Cannon returns in goal for the Ravens. Cannon stopped 10 shots in last year's tournament semifinal victory. Goggle up, girls: butterflies are free, but there is a price to pay for victory.\n\nToo cute - \"Too cute,\" people say when they don't know what else to say. On Sept. 25 as I lumbered about at the Dogfish Dash, trudging amongst 1,700 mostly strangers, the most people I ever didn't know in Milton, I came upon Milton Elementary students Marley Evans and Leela Lyle, who were there with their silly parents.\n\nMarley is in Mrs. Drumheller's class while Leela has Mrs. Selders. They are off-the-chart cute and should be named Sugar and Spice.\n\nSnippets - The University of Delaware field hockey team came back from a 4-0 deficit at St. Joe's Sept. 24 with less than eight minutes to play as the stickers on Hawk Hill couldn't bring home the victory in their first home game since 2007 at brand-new Ellen Ryan field. Hannah Pepper scored her first collegiate goal off a corner during the furious five-goal surge.\n\nDylan Pepper, from Milton and Sussex Tech, has started all four games for Goldey-Beacom College. The Lightning are 0-4. The Colby College Mules lost to the Bantams of Trinity College 28-10 Sept. 24.\n\nNick Kmetz, a Redefer and Judge cousin, completed 24 passes for 196 yards for the Mules. Nick's father is Paul Kmetz, a coach at Indian River and a former Bucknell Bisons quarterback.\n\nThe Stonehill College Skyhawks lost a football game to American International College 37-34 Sept. 24. Kyle Norwood, former Cape player, caught three passes for 27 yards.\n\nSean Hopkins, former Sussex Tech and Sussex Central player, scored his first college touchdown as the Wesley Wolverines walloped the Husson University Eagles 72-0, prompting the question ”Who dat?” Husson, located in Bangor, Maine, has lost three games by a total of 212-26; forget the calculator - they are giving up 70 points a game. Maybe Delaware can get them on the schedule?\n\nMichael Vick walks into a West Philadelphia corner bar. “I'm looking for the man who hurt my paw.” The bartender says, “Go on now, git!”"
