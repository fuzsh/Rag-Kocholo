        "text": "By JON GERAMITA\n\njgeramita@njherald.com\n\nAUGUSTA -- At one time, Chris Brown hated Kyle Ruwe.\n\nFlash back to the spring of 2000. Ruwe is the star for Nova High School in Sunrise, Fla., and Brown is a sophomore third baseman for Cooper City High School, just 10 minutes down the road.\n\nThe rivals, who had already played four times in 2000, were locked in a tight game in the regional finals. The winner went to the state tournament.\n\nRuwe, a junior at the time, shut down Brown and Cooper City and, in the seventh inning, steps to the plate.\n\nBam! The Babe Ruth of Broward County hit a walk-off home run.\n\n\"I know I saw Chris Brown crying on third base,\" Ruwe said. \"I know it.\"\n\nThe two didn't personally know each other in their neighboring towns northern of Miami, but they always knew who the other was.\n\nNow, more than 500 miles from home, they're teammates.\n\n\"It's funny now because we weren't friends and didn't know each other, but we always played against each other,\" Brown said. \"He'll get on me all the time about how he ended my season that year. It's funny how things work out.\"\n\nManager Hal Lanier credited some of his team's recent run of success to team chemistry.\n\nWhen you are as connected as these guys are, it was inevitable.\n\nThere is also relief pitcher Roger Lincoln and backup catcher Cliff Panezich.\n\nIn 2003, Lincoln played for the Mahoning Valley Scrappers, in Niles, Ohio, just west of Youngstown. Panezich at the time was just graduating from Ursuline High School, 15 minutes from where Lincoln played.\n\nLincoln also met his fiancé, Natalie, in Youngstown. Panezich and Natalie had some common friends that went to a nearby high school.\n\nLincoln was out most of this season with elbow problems, but when he returned to the Skyhawks, he was set up with a host family.\n\nAs soon as he walked through the door, there stood Panezich.\n\nA few minutes of talks later, they realized how much they had in common.\n\n\"He said he was from Ohio, then he said from where, and I lit up and said, 'I used to play there,'\" Lincoln said.\n\n\"I went to a few (Mahoning Valley) games when I was in school but I never recalled his name,\" Panezich said. \"But who knows, maybe I saw him play once and never realized it.\"\n\nPanezich is also connected to Ruwe and fellow pitchers Michael Laluna, Khalid Afify and Jamie Douglas, all of whom were teammates in a baseball showcase game last winter in Detroit where, ultimately, the Skyhawks signed them.\n\n\"I even caught for Laluna there,\" Panezich said. \"It's nice to start your first year in pro ball knowing some people.\"\n\nIf you're playing Six Degrees of Skyhawk, it would be wise to start with Lincoln.\n\nLincoln and Ruwe were teammates on the Lincoln Saltdogs of the American Association last year, along with third baseman Jay Yaconetti. Lincoln played with Skyhawks pitcher Justin Knoff and right fielder Jorge Moreno in Winnipeg, a team managed by Hal Lanier.\n\nAlso in Winnipeg, Lincoln played against Mario Delgado.\n\nLincoln was a teammate of Skyhawks starting pitcher Gary Galvez, who grew up 15 minutes from Ruwe and Brown in Hialeah, Fla., when he played for Greenville of the South Atlantic League.\n\n\"When you're 49 years old you will know everyone,\" Knoff joked to Lincoln as the two were receiving treatment before a game recently.\n\nBrown and Delgado used to talk to each other at first base when Delgado played there for the Kansas City T-Bones of the Northern League last year.\n\n\"I knew him, too,\" Brown said. \"We were always friendly and just would talk about stuff.\"\n\nThere are eight independent baseball leagues in the United States, covering different parts of the country. Once a player is in the independent leagues, he could be traded or purchased by any other of the 66 teams if he isn't signed by a Major League team.\n\nWhen Delgado was traded to Sussex on Aug. 5, he was playing for the Lincoln Saltdogs at the time. Knoff was picked up from El Paso in July and Ryan Crespi's contract was purchased from Reno earlier this month.\n\nFor Delgado, the transition was easy: Matt Weston, Ron Perodin and Kevin Rios, like him, are all from southern California.\n\nMoreno and pitcher Matt Salvato played with each other in Sioux City last season, the same place where former Skyhawks designated hitter Walter Young was traded to earlier this year.\n\nLanier managed Moreno, Lincoln, Knoff, Brown and closer Matt Petrusek at one point, too.\n\nAnd just when you thought that all the connections are through, a glance at the roster reveals the last.\n\nLaluna and little-used utility infielder Mark Pappas have the most in common: Both were born Feb. 11, 1986.\n\n\"Baseball,\" Lincoln said, putting his hands up in the air, \"makes it a very small world.\""
