        "text": "On the way to a 32-6 career record as a Spartan, Rogers had many great outings including a perfect game to kick off his senior year. Michael helped the Spartans win state, county and conference championships. He was the winning pitcher for the Spartans in two state title games.\n\nHe was named to The Associated PressÂ’ New Jersey All-State baseball team for three consecutive seasons.\n\nRogers also excelled in soccer earning local, state and regional acclaim. He captained both sports as a senior but he made his biggest impact in baseball, setting county records for wins and being named the N.J. Pitcher of the Year.\n\nLater, he would be recognized as a high school Pitcher of the Decade by area media.\n\nFrom 2001-04, he attended North Carolina State University where he became a two-time All-America selection. Highlights included a record of 24-8 in three seasons at N.C. State, including a three-hit shutout at No. 1 Texas. The 6-foot-1, 205-pounder became only the second pitcher in Atlantic Coast Conference history to be named Pitcher of the Week five times in one season, joining Clemson's Kris Benson, the No. 1 pick in the 1996 draft.\n\nA starting pitcher at North Carolina for three years, Michael was drafted as the 49th overall pick of the Oakland Athletics. He played in the Oakland organization for four seasons.\n\nIn 2008, he was a member of the Sussex Skyhawks of the Can-Am League and for the Rockford Riverhawks of the Frontier League in 2009.\n\nArmed with his degree in Sport Management from N.C. State, as well as the savvy gained from excelling as a right-hander in the sport throughout Little League to the pros, he opened the Michael Rogers Pitching Academy. Rogers made important stops at the highest levels of organized youth sports, including the American Legion Baseball World Series. Michael was 25-2 in three years for Hamilton Post 31, including a trip to the 2000 American Legion World Series.\n\nRETURN TO THE HALL OF FAME MEMBERS PAGE"
