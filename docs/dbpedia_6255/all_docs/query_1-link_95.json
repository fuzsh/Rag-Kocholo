        "text": "Hi,\n\nI bumped into some Piper pictures at http://www.john2031.com/site_map_aviation_information_airplane_pictures.html and found a couple that have me curious.\n\nI don't recall seeing wing tips like these, are they common somewhere?\n\nhttp://www.john2031.com/piper/pa-20_pacer/pictures/n7049k.JPG\n\nhttp://www.john2031.com/piper/pa-20_pacer/alaska/n7481k_5.JPG\n\nJim,\n\nI'm so happy you found the john2031 site! Some great photos of \"working\" shortwings. Especially the \"bush\" Pacers. Its a great site and one that holds up, very simply, the virtue of planes in their functional habitat, rather than the more common polished and pristine habitat...though there is some of that too. He documents working PA-20s and 22/20s very well. Alaska-vernacular Pacers! haha. Lots of interesting mods to be seen if you go through all of them. Some legit and some, you know, Alaska-style. There is one pacer in there where the landing gear seems to be moved back an entire bay and angled forward for example. Here it is: http://www.john2031.com/piper/pa-22-20/alaska/n8909d.JPG\n\nGreat site of photos. Thanks for bringing it up here. Important. Few people have decided that these planes deserve to be documented, and Ken Stoltzfus, Sr. has done a real service. There is some fascinating stuff out at the margins of the airports!\n\nSearching N numbers. Is there a way to search on previous owners? How about any way to find out the original paint scheme of an N number? Thanks.\n\nThe FAA has records of all title transfers, liens (and lien releases), and major alternations for a given N-number. You pay them $15 (I think that's about right, don't spit on me if I'm off by a couple of bucks) and they send you a data CD with everything they know. I did this for my Tri-Pacer and also for my Skyhawk.\n\nUsing that info, I tried to find \"people who remember my Tri-Pacer when it was newish\" to see if anyone had an old photo. Basically I queried the local EAA chapter in the area where it operated for the first dozen years of its life. It wasn't fruitful but was still entertaining. This kind of result can be expected from 50-60 year-old equipment (the people who were there in the early days are few and far between, and likely \"not internet users\").\n\nBest regards,\n\nTodd"
