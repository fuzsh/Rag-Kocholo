The owners of the baseball stadium have announced they will have a new team, the Sussex County Miners, playing at the park in the spring.\n\n(Star-Ledger file photo)\n\nFRANKFORD — Baseball will be back in Sussex County in the spring.\n\nToday Skylands Stadium unveiled the name and logo for its new Can-Am League team, now known as the Sussex County Miners, according to officials at the Skylands Stadium in Frankford.\n\n“We are thrilled to be unveiling the Sussex county Miners, their team colors, and new general manager Dave Chase to baseball fans and the community,” said Al Dorso Sr., president of both the stadium and the new team.\n\nSkylands Stadium was home to a previous Can-Am team, the Sussex Skyhawks, from 2006 to 2011, according to the New Jersey Herald. A single-A affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals, the New Jersey Cardinals, played there from 1994 to 2005.\n\nDavid Chase, the new general manager, has a career in baseball spanning from minor league teams, to serving as publisher and president of Baseball America magazine, according to Skylands.\n\nThe team’s new logo is black and gold, and pays homage to the area’s mining past with a pickaxe.\n\nThe Miners will play 55 home games from Memorial Day through Labor Day next year. The stadium has also updated concessions, bathrooms, and the playing field, and constructed a new pavilion down the first-base line."
