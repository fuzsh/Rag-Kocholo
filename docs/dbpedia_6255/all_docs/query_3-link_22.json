        "text": "Some people may be disappointed that the Reno Silver Sox won”t be playing again in Chico, at least during the regular season. Mark Parent is not one of those people.\n\nMonday”s game represented the 19th meeting between Chico and Reno this season — that”s out of 43 games so far for the Outlaws — meaning that the rivalry has become a bit stale. Parent said he”s looking forward to some different styles of play as well as wishing for some crisper play.\n\n“I”m getting tired of these long, strung-out games,” he said during batting practice.\n\nMonday was the seventh consecutive day the teams have done battle against one another and each has scored 48 runs over that span, an average of nearly seven runs per game. Reno leads the Golden Baseball League in stolen bases and home runs and will host the Outlaws for a two-game set at Peccole Park on Aug. 18-19.\n\n“They can run so well, they can steal bases and they have movement. The guys can hit the ball out of the ballpark. They can do it all,” Parent said.\n\nBYE BYE BAMBINO: The Outlaws released catcher Ricky Bambino on Monday and signed Jason Alcott in an effort to improve defense behind the plate. Bambino hit .203 in 19 games and will undoubtedly be remembered for his name and for his role in starting a brawl against the Silver Sox on July 4.\n\nParent said Alcott was recommended by former Outlaw Bobby Gandolfo, who played with Alcott for the Sussex Skyhawks of the independent Can-Am League. The 25-year-old Alcott hit .159 in 23 games for Sussex and will back up Brock Ungricht.\n\n“We”ve got to shore up our running game defensively. We give away too many bases,” Parent said.\n\nBambino”s roommate with the Outlaws and fellow Redding native Ungricht said whenever a teammate gets released, it makes other players take personal inventory.\n\n“It just reminds you that you can”t get relaxed, you can”t just go with the flow,” Ungricht said. “You”ve always got to make sure you”re getting better and helping the team or else it could be you the next day.”"
