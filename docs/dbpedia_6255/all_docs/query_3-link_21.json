        "text": "CHICO — Those eight stolen bases that broke the organization record by the fourth inning of Tuesday’s win for the Chico Outlaws had an auspicious vibe since they came against a Reno Silver Sox team depleted as can be at the catcher position.\n\nBut on the other end, there was plenty of satisfaction to take from holding the Silver Sox without a stolen base all the while. Reno has generally been considered the top base stealer in the Golden Baseball League this season, and might still have the overall league-best total if former leader Ryan Crespi hadn’t been sold to the Sussex Skyhawks in the Can-Am League.\n\nTuesday marked just the second time in 11 games against Reno since the All-Star break that the Outlaws were able to prevent Reno from recording at least one stolen base. Both occasions had two common themes.\n\nFor one, they came on nights when the Outlaws happened to have a backup playing in place of starting catcher Matt Ceriani. More telling is the other: that they came when the Silver Sox hadn’t been able to put together more than at least three hits against Outlaws pitching.\n\n“Pitching will definitely hold down the baserunning,” said rookie catcher Bryan Silverman, Tuesday’s catcher. “A little part of me always wants a challenge to throw at, but it’s all good as long we end up with more (stolen bases).”\n\nSilverman’s chief problem to deal with would have been Gary Harris, the Reno leadoff man who is second in the GBL with 32 stolen bases. Harris ended up with one of Reno’s three hits, a first-inning double that limited his chance to showcase that speed.\n\nThe Outlaws are third in the GBL in defending stolen bases with a 23 percent success rate cutting down runners.\n\nGOOD TALK: Outlaws radio play-by-play man Rory Miller upon signing off after home contests usually sticks with his informal routine of sharing personal postgame thoughts with members of the Nettleton Stadium press box. After Tuesday’s win, he instead was beaming about the performance of Ceriani, who has been out of the lineup resting a sore back, as a guest broadcast partner during Tuesday’s win.\n\n“His perspective he offered as a player was really good,” Miller said, “but it was the natural sense of timing he had in terms of especially knowing when to hold off on commenting during a play that was impressive.”\n\nCeriani has been somewhat of a seasoned player radio commentator since he became a regular on the postgame show of Stockton Ports broadcasts during his Single-A stint with the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nDONE AT 63: Center fielder Steve Boggs’ status as the only Outlaws player not to miss one of their 63 games this season ended Wednesday when he requested a rare day off.\n\nNotes: Jose Valdez had a team-high three hits in Wednesday’s loss. … The Outlaws had six steals. … A three-base error by second baseman Carlos Madrid in the first inning was changed to a Lino Garcia triple after the game. … Trevor Caughey (6-4, 2.00 ERA) will start on the mound in the finale of the six-game homestand tonight against a Reno starter to be determined."
