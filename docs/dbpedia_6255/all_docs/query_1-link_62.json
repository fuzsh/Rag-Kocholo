        "text": "Former Pirates' standout, Mark Pappas joined Rob Sheppard's coaching staff prior to the 2010 season. In October of 2011, he was promoted to assistant coach after serving one year as a volunteer assistant coach. Prior to the start of the 2018 season, Pappas was elevated to Assistant Coach / Recruiting Coordinator.\n\nAssisting the student-athletes primarily with hitting and fielding, which were strengths of Pappas' game as a player, he earned a ring when Seton Hall won the 2011 BIG EAST Championship.\n\nIn 2021, Pappas helped guide Seton Hall to 16 BIG EAST wins – its most since the 2013 season – and its 10th consecutive trip to the BIG EAST Championship. The Pirates finished with the second-highest batting average in the BIG EAST (.269), the second most sacrifice flies (20) and they led the conference with 47 sacrifice bunts. Four Pirate position players were named to All-BIG EAST teams in 2021 including first teamers Matt Toke and Jerry Huntzinger.\n\nPappas' Pirates again finished as one of the top hitting teams in the BIG EAST Conference in 2018. The Hall had a .272 team batting average in conference games, which ranked third-best in the league. Furthermore, the Pirates belted 28 home runs, which is their most in 11 years.\n\nIn 2014, thanks largely to Pappas' influence, Seton Hall led the BIG EAST in team batting with a .297 average. The Pirates also led the newly-reconstituted conference in slugging percentage, runs scored, triples, RBIs and stolen bases. In the field, Seton Hall's .975 fielding percentage was second-best in the league. The Pirates committed only 52 errors in 54 games.\n\nIn 2013, Pappas' coaching was evident as the Pirates finished the season as the second-best hitting team in the BIG EAST and the top fielding program in the conference. Seton Hall's .301 team batting average in 2013 was the highest since collectively batting .313 in 2000. The Pirates' .978 fielding percentage led the BIG EAST and their 48 errors was 18 less than the second-fewest (Villanova - 66) total in the league.\n\nIn 2011, Pappas managed the Monmouth Monarchs of the Atlantic Baseball Confederation Collegiate League to its first-ever league championship.\n\nA graduate from Seton Hall University, Mark played for the Sheppard from 2005-08. He graduated from the team a career .290 hitter with 101 runs scored, 92 RBI, 34 doubles, three triples, and 13 home runs.\n\nIn his senior campaign, Mark led the team with 41 runs scored, nine doubles, and eight sacrifice flies. In the field, he broke the single-season record with 177 assists and currently ranks third in the category.\n\nFollowing his senior year, Mark signed his first professional contract with the Sussex Skyhawks of the Can-Am League where he played two seasons including their 2008 league championship year."
