        "text": "FRANKFORD — In his wildest dreams, Mark Roscioli Jr. never imagined he'd own a baseball stadium.\n\nHe likes baseball and the Phillies, but the 32-year-old Philadelphia entrepreneur freely admits he knows next to nothing about running a ballpark and, in fact, he’s never been to college, which he says was never “my thing.” His dad ran a junkyard in the suburbs of Philadelphia.\n\n“I have no background in how to run a ballpark. This is going to be trial by fire,” said Roscioli, who on March 15 bought Skylands Park, a 4,200-seat minor league ballpark that was built on a former farm field in Sussex County.\n\nOne thing Roscioli tries to know a lot about is finding a good deal. For a living, he buys distressed real estate at low prices, especially those with cellular antennae. After buying the land, he collects rent for the antennae from the phone companies.\n\nHe said he thinks he made a great deal when he bought the ballpark at Routes 15 and 565 in Frankford Township for $950,000, less than half its original asking price.\n\nAs part of the deal, the former owners, Millennium Sports Management, paid $160,000 in back taxes, which have now been lowered to $30,000 annually due to successful appeals.\n\nSkylands Park, on 28 acres adjacent to a proposed shopping mall, was originally listed at $1.99 million. When it opened in 1994 as home of the New Jersey Cardinals, it cost $9 million to $10 million to build.\n\nRoscioli explained he was initially attracted to the property because there are three cell antennae on light poles in the ballpark.\n\nA large 2010 schedule for the 19-year-old ballpark’s last tenants, the Sussex County Skyhawks, still adorns a wall; the colorful ads that cover the outfield wall are mostly worn and faded. Memorabilia collectors can still find Skyhawks’ T-shirts hanging in a display case outside the conference room near the dormant batting cages.\n\n“At the time, they were asking for $1.5 million. I made a super low-ball offer — and they took it,” Roscioli said during an interview in a conference room held in a red steel prefabricated building known as “the barn” near the field.\n\nNow, he says, the real work begins: what to do with it?\n\n“You see everything differently when you own the place,” joked Roscioli, whose one-man firm, 17 Mile, of Ardmore, Pa., derives its name from 17-Mile Drive near the Pebble Beach golf course in California, where Roscioli once worked as a caddy.\n\nWhile the father of three hopes to add other attractions, including a sports bar and concerts, to make his new investment a year-round revenue producer, Roscioli said finding a new, steady baseball tenant is important — but not necessarily imperative — to the long-term success of the facility. The only other tenant at Skylands Park is a child care center.\n\nWhile not offering specifics, Roscioli said he’s been in “advanced discussions with multiple parties” about bringing a baseball team to Skylands Park although no firm commitments have been made.\n\n“I’ll know in the next three or four months if there’s going to be a team here in 2014. If they don’t pull the trigger soon, we’ll take it down a different path,” including renting the field out to college, high school and local community teams, he said.\n\n“I want to get a partnership with the right team,” he added.\n\nAmong those interested in fielding a team at Skylands Park is the Atlantic Collegiate Baseball League, a Quakertown, Pa.-based league that features top collegiate baseball prospects.\n\nThe league, founded in 1967, plays a 40-game schedule from June 1 to July 30 and has seven teams that play in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. Adding an eighth team would simplify scheduling and add exposure for the league, ACBL officials said.\n\nThe three Garden State teams include the North Jersey Eagles, who play at the Overpeck (Bergen) County Park in Ridgefield Park; the Jersey Pilots, who play at the Snyder Avenue Park Turf Field in Berkeley Heights; and the Trenton Generals, who play at Mercer County Community College and Mercer County Park in West Windsor.\n\n“It certainly would be a good geographic fit. There’s a lot of potential out there,” said ACBL President Tom Bonekemper.\n\nWhile there were talks about establishing a new franchise with an unnamed “private group,” Bonekemper said no one has stepped forward to file a formal application to start a new team.\n\n• Follow @starledger on Twitter\n\nAnd check out our redesigned mobile site by visiting NJ.com from any mobile browser.\n\nRecalling the days when the New Jersey Cardinals, a Class-A minor-league team, set attendance records in the mid-1990s while playing in the New York-Penn League, North Jersey Eagles general manager Brian Casey said he believed there was a strong, untapped interest in baseball in northwestern New Jersey.\n\nCasey said the Eagles do not charge admission for their games, and admission prices are left to the discretion of the individual teams.\n\nIn the meantime, Roscioli is open to any and all ideas about how to make his latest business venture a profitable one.\n\n“Right now, it’s mostly a fact-finding mission. What does the county want? What does everybody want to see?” he said.\n\nRoscioli said the first baseball game to be held at Skylands Park since 2010 will be held Tuesday when Sussex County Community College hosts Orange County (N.Y.) Community College.\n\n“We’re fixing up the field a little, getting it ready. Things are looking good,” he said, adding SCCC plans to host another half-dozen games at the end of the month.\n\nRob Hilliard, who was the driving force behind the construction of Skylands Park more than 20 years ago when the ballpark was dubbed “the field of dreams,” said it sounded like the ballpark was in good hands with Roscioli.\n\n“My overriding interest is to see that Skylands Park has a future as a sports and entertainment venue,” said Hilliard, formerly of Vernon, who now runs a market research firm in northern Michigan. “Ultimately, it’s up to the residents of Sussex County to support this second opportunity in their community.”\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n• Sale of Skylands Park in Sussex County now scheduled for next week"
