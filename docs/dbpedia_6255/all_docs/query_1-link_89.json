        "text": "RIVERDALE, N.Y. - The Manhattan baseball program welcomes back former Jasper standout Rene Ruiz who will serve as an assistant coach for the 2010-2011 campaign. Ruiz was an All-MAAC shortstop during his career in Riverdale and helped the Jaspers win the program's first MAAC title in 2006. The Miami native spent the last two years playing professionally with the majority of his work in the Continental Baseball League.\n\nRuiz served as the starting shortstop who helped the Manhattan baseball program advance to the 2006 NCAA Regional Finals after defeating Nebraska and current New York Yankee pitcher Joba Chamberlain in the Tournament. As a senior, Ruiz was named to the 2007 All-MAAC Second Team after recording one of the highest fielding percentages (.965) among Division I shortstops.\n\nThe product of nationally ranked Miami Southridge Senior High School played a total 77 games professionally for the Big Bend Cowboys of the Continental Baseball League between the 2009 and 2010 seasons. Ruiz started 53 games, scored 42 runs, had 16 RBI and stole eight bases. He started 24 games for the Cowboys in 2010 and was named a mid-season All-Star after batting .396 with a .480 on-base percentage and 14 RBI."
