Gill teaches and writes about twentieth century and contemporary book cultures, focusing particularly on the physical and conceptual mutations of the book in the hybrid territory between book and art.

She has published on artists Tom Phillips and John Latham, book burning, and the strange fate of the dust jacket. Her current research project at the IES – ‘Page Not Found’ – traces the outer limits and unexpected histories of the page.

With Adam Smyth and Simon Morris she is one of the co-founders and editors of Inscription – Journal of Material Text: Theory, Practice, History. She also co-edited Book Destruction (2014) and has written for the TLS, London Review of Books, Literary Review, LA Review of Books and Public Books.

Her creative work has recently been exhibited as part of the Bodleian Library’s Sensational Books exhibition, at Shandy Hall in Yorkshire and, as part of the printing collective 39 Step Press, has been commissioned and acquired by the Beinecke Library at Yale.
