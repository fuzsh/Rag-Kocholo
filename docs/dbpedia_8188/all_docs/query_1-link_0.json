        "text": "Canadian artist\n\nCharles Ignace Adélard Gill (21 October 1871 – 16 October 1918) was a Canadian artist, specializing in poetry and painting. He also worked under the alternate names of Clairon and Léon Duval.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nHe was born at Sorel, Quebec to Charles-Ignace Gill and Marie-Rosalie Delphire Sénécal. He studied at Collège Sainte-Marie de Montréal, Collège de Nicolet and Collège Saint-Laurent, then George de Forest Brush, who was vacationing in Pierreville, undertook to develop Gill's talent for painting. As a result, he went to the Art Association of Montreal that 1888 to study with William Brymner.[1] Encouraged by Brymner, he went to Paris and worked with Jean-Léon Gérôme at the École des Beaux-Arts. After returning to Montreal, he established his own studio in 1894.[2][1]\n\nHe also published poetry in the anthology Les soirées du Château de Ramesay (1900). After his death a volume of his poetry was published under the title Le Cap Eternité, poème suivi des étoiles filantes (1919).[2]\n\nGill had one son, Roger-Charles, with his wife Georgine Bélanger (aka Gaëtane de Montreuil, m. 12 May 1902). He died at Montreal from the 1918 flu pandemic just short of his 47th birthday.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
