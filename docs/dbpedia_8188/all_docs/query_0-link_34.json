Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is characterised by a triad of recurrent orofacial swelling, relapsing facial paralysis, and fissured tongue. The classic triad is infrequent and oligosymptomatic variants are seen more frequently. CTS is a rare complication of facial nerve paralysis characterised by inappropriate lacrimation on the side of the palsy in response to salivary stimuli. It results from aberrant reinnervation of the lacrimal gland by salivary parasympathetic fibres. The therapeutic approach for an acute bout of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome consists mainly of steroid administration. CTS management is composed of anticholinergic drugs and surgical procedures. Botulin toxin injection into the lacrimal gland is the most modern therapeutic option. In the case presented CTS developed in a 50-year-old man after 5 incidents of facial palsy due to Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. The case deserves attention due to the rarity of the observed symptoms and signs.\n\nPublication Bias in Meta-Analysis: Confidence Intervals for Rosenthal's Fail-Safe Number.\n\nPubMed\n\nFragkos, Konstantinos C; Tsagris, Michail; Frangos, Christos C\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe purpose of the present paper is to assess the efficacy of confidence intervals for Rosenthal's fail-safe number. Although Rosenthal's estimator is highly used by researchers, its statistical properties are largely unexplored. First of all, we developed statistical theory which allowed us to produce confidence intervals for Rosenthal's fail-safe number. This was produced by discerning whether the number of studies analysed in a meta-analysis is fixed or random. Each case produces different variance estimators. For a given number of studies and a given distribution, we provided five variance estimators. Confidence intervals are examined with a normal approximation and a nonparametric bootstrap. The accuracy of the different confidence interval estimates was then tested by methods of simulation under different distributional assumptions. The half normal distribution variance estimator has the best probability coverage. Finally, we provide a table of lower confidence intervals for Rosenthal's estimator.\n\nPublication Bias in Meta-Analysis: Confidence Intervals for Rosenthal's Fail-Safe Number\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFragkos, Konstantinos C.; Tsagris, Michail; Frangos, Christos C.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe purpose of the present paper is to assess the efficacy of confidence intervals for Rosenthal's fail-safe number.

D.; Evans, D. J.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nThe feasibility of using MERL 76, an advanced high strength direct hot isostatic pressed powder metallurgy superalloy, as a full scale component in a high technology, long life, commercial turbine engine were demonstrated. The component was a JT9D first stage turbine disk. The JT9D disk rim temperature capability was increased by at least 22 C and the weight of JT9D high pressure turbine rotating components was reduced by at least 35 pounds by replacement of forged Superwaspaloy components with hot isostatic pressed (HIP) MERL 76 components. The process control plan and acceptance criteria for manufacture of MERL 76 HIP consolidated components were generated. Disk components were manufactured for spin/burst rig test, experimental engine tests, and design data generation, which established lower design properties including tensile, stress-rupture, 0.2% creep and notched (Kt = 2.5) low cycle fatigue properties, Sonntag, fatigue crack propagation, and low cycle fatigue crack threshold data. Direct HIP MERL 76, when compared to conventionally forged Superwaspaloy, is demonstrated to be superior in mechanical properties, increased rim temperature capability, reduced component weight, and reduced material cost by at least 30% based on 1980 costs.\n\n[The Rosenthal experiment or: about the site of productive research - on move of the physiological experimental laboratory of Isidor Rosenthal (1836-1915) from the city to the country].\n\nPubMed\n\nStahnisch, Frank W\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe disciplinary development of the new science of experimental physiology is often associated with the conditions of cultural development and increasingly technical working contexts of the Industrial Age. Following this perspective, the germ cells of 19th century institutes of experimental physiology were particularly found in the metropolises of Paris, Leipzig or Berlin. Only the major cities sat the revolutionary trends and within this general process, the scientific trends were no exceptions - the provincial research universities simply followed the central ones in their normal science endeavours. Due to this interpretation, the development of the scientific community was pre-formatted as the interplay of innovation (the city) and reception (the periphery). Isidor Rosenthal (1836-1915) was born in Labischin (District of Bromberg/Posen) in 1836 and got his medical training in Berlin. Like not many other experimental physiologists, he can be used as a historiographical testing probe, to follow the conditions of knowledge transfer from center to periphery: After his studies at the Friedrich Wilhelms University and the completion of his dissertation in 1859, Rosenthal entered the newly founded Physiological Institute in Berlin as the first Research Associate of Emil DuBois-Reymond (1818-1896). Rosenthal worked here particularly on the problem of \"direct and indirect muscle irritation\" in frogs. These neurophysiological investigations led to his growing scientific renown. In 1872, Rosenthal became offered a first professorship in physiology at the Friedrich Alexander University in Bavaria, as one of only few Jewish scientists (and even before Wilhelm Wundt, 1832-1920). But his life and work proved not only exceptional because of his scientific achievements, but also due to his deep rootedness in cultural life--both during his time in Berlin and in Erlangen. By applying a comparative and microhistorical approach in this article, the working conditions of this\n\nRobert Merle dâAubignÃ©, 1900â1989\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBiau, David J.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThis biographical sketch of R.

Clinically, it is characterized by the diagnostic triad: recurrent edema of lips and/or face; recurrent and alternating acute peripheral facial paralysis and scrotal or geographic tongue. The condition generally presents as oligosymptomatic or monosymptomatic form. Two patients are presented with completed triad and oligosymptomatic form. This recent review published by G. Kayabasoglu et al. states that only 30 patients have been described in the international literature in childhood. So we consider this disease in the differential diagnosis in the presence of acute peripheral facial paralysis and/or lips or facial edema.

Estrella; Martinez, Manuel; Arnaiz, Ana; Ortego, FÃ©lix; Grbic, Vojislava; Diaz, Isabel\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe defense response of the plants against herbivores relies on a complex network of interconnected signaling pathways. In this work, we characterized a new key player in the response of Arabidopsis against the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae, the MATI (Mite Attack Triggered Immunity) gene. This gene was differentially induced in resistant Bla-2 strain relative to susceptible Kon Arabidopsis accessions after mite attack, suggesting a potential role in the control of spider mites. To study the MATI gene function, it has been performed a deep molecular characterization of the gene combined with feeding bioassays using modified Arabidopsis lines and phytophagous arthropods. The MATI gene belongs to a new gene family that had not been previously characterized. Biotic assays showed that it confers a high tolerance not only to T. urticae, but also to the chewing lepidopteran Spodoptera exigua. Biochemical analyses suggest that MATI encodes a protein involved in the accumulation of reducing agents upon herbivore attack to control plant redox homeostasis avoiding oxidative damage and cell death. Besides, molecular analyses demonstrated that MATI is involved in the modulation of different hormonal signaling pathways, affecting the expression of genes involved in biosynthesis and signaling of the jasmonic acid and salicylic acid hormones. The fact that MATI is also involved in defense through the modulation of the levels of photosynthetic pigments highlights the potential of MATI proteins to be exploited as biotechnological tools for pest control.

In the current literature confusing heterogeneity exists, mixing together the historically grown terms cheilitis granulomatosa or granulomatous cheilitis, Melkersson Rosenthal syndrome and the umbrella term orofacial granulomatosis (OFG). We provide a systematic review comprising all three disease entities of orofacial granulomatosis using the computerized database \"Pubmed Medline\" entering the key words \"orofacial granulomatosis\" (141 references), \"Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome\" (207 references), \"granulomatous cheilitis\" or \"cheilitis granulomatosa\" (102 references) back to 1956. Full text journals and case studies were included, and data synthesis was performed individually. Etiology remains unclear for all three disease entities. Etiological relatedness to chronic inflammatory bowel disease is under discussion and effectiveness was found for different treatments, e.g. local triamcinolone injections, antibiotics, surgical interventions, TNF alpha blockers or exclusive enteral nutrition. No randomized controlled trial concerning the therapy of orofacial granulomatosis was found. As a consequence, therapeutic conclusions are drawn mainly from small case series, thus limiting the evidence of therapeutic interventions. OFG with the sub-entities MRS and cheilitis granulomatosa is an etiological obscure disease process with various possible therapeutic interventions potentially alleviating the disease course but to broaden treatment knowledge further study in randomized controlled trials are needed.

The purpose of this exercise was to strengthen the interoperability relationship between the FRMAC Fly Away Laboratory (FAL) and the EPA Mobile Environmental Radiation Laboratory (MERL) stationed in Las Vegas, Nevada. The exercise was designed to allow for immediate delivery of pre-staged, spiked samples to the EPA MERL and the FAL for sample preparation andmoreÂ Â» radiological analysis. Upon completion of laboratory analysis, data was reviewed and submitted back to the FRMAC via an electronic data deliverable (EDD). In order to conduct a laboratory inter-comparison study, samples were then traded between the two laboratories and re-counted. As part of the exercise, an evaluation was conducted to identify gaps and potential areas for improvements for FRMAC, FAL and EPA operations. Additionally, noteworthy practices and potential future areas of interoperability opportunities between the FRMAC, FAL and EPA were acknowledged. The exercise also provided a unique opportunity for FRMAC personnel to observe EPA sample receipt and sample preparation processes and to gain familiarity with the MERL laboratory instrumentation and radiation detection capabilities. The areas for potential improvements and interoperability from this exercise will be critical for developing a more efficient, integrated response for future interactions between the FRMAC and EPA MERL assets.Â«Â less\n\n[Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome.

It is a rare entity and is characterized in its complete presentation, by the association of reccurent orofacial swelling, peripheral facial palsy and plicated tongue. Incomplete forms are more frequent and more difficult to establish its diagnosis. This latter is based on major and minor clinical and histological critieria sorted in three levels. There is four forms of MRS. The pathogenesis of this syndrome is still unknown; treatment remains random. It is based on topical or systemic steroids with or without cheiloplastic procedure. We must think of MRS in presence of any recurrent peripheral facial palsy and/or chronic facial swelling.\n\nSuccessful treatment of Miescher's cheilitis in Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome with betamethasone injections and doxycycline\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOudrhiri, Lamia; Chiheb, Soumiya; Marnissi, Farida; Zamiati, Soumaya; Benchikhi, Hakima\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWe report a case of a 19-year-old girl who presented with 5-year history of swelling of upper lip and fissured tongue treated with dapsone then oral steroids without any improvement. Clinical examination found peripheral facial nerve paralysis and Labial mucosa biopsy showed non-necrotizing giganto-epithelioid granuloma. Diagnosis of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome was retaind because of association of cheilitis, lingua plicata and facial paralysis. Given the failure of dapsone and oral steroid we suggested an association of betamethasone injection and doxycycline. Gradual and permanent reduction of the upper lip volume was observed. One year follow up objectified no reactivation of cheilitis.

The purpose of this exercise was to strengthen the interoperability relationship between the FRMAC, RAP, and the EPA Mobile Environmental Radiation Laboratory (MERL) stationed in Montgomery, Alabama. The exercise was designed to allowed members of the DOE RAP Region-3 team to collect soil, water, vegetation and air samplesmoreÂ Â» from SRS and submit them through an established FRMAC hotline. Once received and processed through the hotline, FRMAC delivered the samples to the EPA MERL for sample preparation and laboratory radiological analysis. Upon completion of laboratory analysis, data was reviewed and submitted back to FRMAC via an electronic data deliverable (EDD). As part of the exercise, an evaluation was conducted to identify gaps and potential improvements in each step of the processes. Additionally, noteworthy practices and potential future areas of interoperability between FRMAC and EPA were acknowledged. The exercise also provided a unique opportunity for FRMAC personnel to observe EPA sample receipt and sample preparation processes and to gain familiarity with the MERL laboratory instrumentation and radiation detection capabilities. The observations and lessons-learned from this exercise will be critical for developing a more efficient, integrated response for future interactions between the FRMAC and EPA assets.Â«Â less\n\nREMPI and MATI spectroscopy of cis and trans 4-chloro-3-fluoroanisole\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Sheng; Dai, Wenshuai; Lin, Dan; Cheng, Min; Du, YiKui; Zhu, Qihe\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe Resonance-enhanced two-photon ionization (R2PI) and Mass-analyzed threshold ionization (MATI) spectra of 4-chloro-3-fluoroanisole (4Cl3FA) were recorded in detail. The experimental and calculated results revealed that cis and trans 4Cl3FA are the only two stable conformers in each of the S0, S1 and D0 states. The first electronic excitation energies (E1's) of cis and trans35Cl-4Cl3FA were measured to be 35,326 Â± 3 and 35,443 Â± 3 cm-1 by the R2PI spectroscopy and the corresponding adiabatic ionization energies (IEs) were determined to be 67,330 Â± 5 and 67,591 Â± 5 cm-1 by the MATI spectroscopy. The E1's and IEs of cis and trans37Cl-4Cl3FA were also obtained and found to be identical to that of the 35Cl-4Cl3FA conformers. Compared with the trans 4Cl3FA, the cis 4Cl3FA is more stable in the S0, S1 and D0 states. The vibrational bands observed in the R2PI and MATI spectra are related to the vibrations involving the in-plane deformation of the benzene ring, the CH3 torsion and the OCH3 inversion. The substituent effects on the molecular structures, transition energies and vibrations of 4Cl3FA are discussed.\n\nAn improved experimental scheme for simultaneous measurement of high-resolution zero electron kinetic energy (ZEKE) photoelectron and threshold photoion (MATI) spectra\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMichels, FranÃ§ois; Mazzoni, Federico; Becucci, Maurizio; MÃ¼ller-Dethlefs, Klaus\n\n2017-10-01\n\nAn improved detection scheme is presented for threshold ionization spectroscopy with simultaneous recording of the Zero Electron Kinetic Energy (ZEKE) and Mass Analysed Threshold Ionisation (MATI) signals. The objective is to obtain accurate dissociation energies for larger molecular clusters by simultaneously detecting the fragment and parent ion MATI signals with identical transmission. The scheme preserves an optimal ZEKE spectral resolution together with excellent separation of the spontaneous ion and MATI signals in the time-of-flight mass spectrum. The resulting improvement in sensitivity will allow for the determination of dissociation energies in clusters with substantial mass difference between parent and daughter ions.\n\nThe Self-Powered Detector Simulation `MATiSSe' Toolbox applied to SPNDs for severe accident monitoring in PWRs\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBarbot, LoÃ¯c; Villard, Jean-FranÃ§ois; Fourrez, StÃ©phane; Pichon, Laurent; Makil, Hamid\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn the framework of the French National Research Agency program on nuclear safety and radioprotection, the `DIstributed Sensing for COrium Monitoring and Safety' project aims at developing innovative instrumentation for corium monitoring in case of severe accident in a Pressurized Water nuclear Reactor. Among others, a new under-vessel instrumentation based on Self-Powered Neutron Detectors is developed using a numerical simulation toolbox, named `MATiSSe'. The CEA Instrumentation Sensors and Dosimetry Lab developed MATiSSe since 2010 for Self-Powered Neutron Detectors material selection and geometry design, as well as for their respective partial neutron and gamma sensitivity calculations. MATiSSe is based on a comprehensive model of neutron and gamma interactions which take place in Selfpowered neutron detector components using the MCNP6 Monte Carlo code. As member of the project consortium, the THERMOCOAX SAS Company is currently manufacturing some instrumented pole prototypes to be tested in 2017. The full severe accident monitoring equipment, including the standalone low current acquisition system, will be tested during a joined CEA-THERMOCOAX experimental campaign in some realistic irradiation conditions, in the Slovenian TRIGA Mark II research reactor.\n\nFacial palsy in Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome and Bell's palsy: familial history and recurrence tendency.\n\nPubMed\n\nSun, Baochun; Zhou, Chengyong; Han, Zeli\n\n2015-02-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to compare genetic predilection and recurrence tendency between facial palsy in Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS) and Bell's palsy We carried out an investigation on patients with facial palsy in MRS and those with Bell's palsy who visited the outpatient department in our hospital between February 2009 and February 2013. They were asked about familial history and whether it was the first episode, with the results recorded and compared. There were 16 patients with facial palsy in MRS and 860 patients with Bell's palsy involved in the study. Familial history was positive in 5 of 16 patients (31.3%) with facial palsy in MRS and 56 of 860 patients (6.5%) with Bell's palsy (P < .01). Twelve of 16 cases (75%) with facial palsy in MRS and 88 of 860 cases (10.2%) with Bell's palsy had a history of facial palsy in the past (P < .01). Compared to Bell's palsy, facial palsy in MRS has an obvious genetic predilection and recurrence tendency.

We validated its performance. 736 urines were analysed and results were compared by two pathologists on uncentrifuged samples, using Fuchs-Rosenthal chamber. AUC of ROC curve ranged between 0.86 and 0.99. Sensitivity was >0.90 for all the elements and similar for RBC and yeasts. Specificity ranged between 0.74 and 0.89 for total cast, epithelial/non-squamous/renal-tubular cells and RBC. For all the other parameters specificity was >0.90. Comparison with Fuchs-Rosenthal chamber was very good for all the parameters; r ranged between 0.52 and 0.99 except for pathological cast because of the lack of the pathological samples in medium and higher ranges. Linearity performance (R 2 ) was 1.00, 1.00 and 0.99 respectively for RBC, WBC and epithelial cells (EC). No carry-over was observed. The within-run imprecision was 25.42%,13.81%,1.36% for RBC; 37.50%,10.16%,1.41% for WBC and 35.25%, 17.85%,6.30% for EC at low, near the cut off level and high concentrations, respectively. The between-run imprecision was 6.90%,1.60% for RBC, 4.10%,1.90% for WBC and 7.60%,7.30% for EC, using low and high positive quality controls, respectively. UF-5000 is an analyser of great interest to detect urine particle related to pathological process of kidney and urinary tract. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The Federal Aviation Administration owns or operates support facilities at the airport and wishes to consider the environmental setting and hydro- geologic conditions when evaluating options for remediation of potential contamination at these facilities. The airport is within the Copper River Delta wetlands area and the Chugach National Forest. Silts, sands, and gravels of fluvial origin underlie the airport. Potential flooding may be caused by outbursts of glacier-dammed lakes, glacier icemelt, snowmelt runoff, or precipitation. Surface spills and disposal of hazardous materials in conjunction with precipitation or flooding may adversely affect the quality of ground water. Drinking water at the airport is currently supplied by wells. Alternative drinking-water sources include local rivers and streams, transporting city water from Cordova, or undiscovered aquifers. Each alternative source, however, would likely cost significantly more to develop than using the existing shallow aquifer supply.\n\nMelkersson-Rosenthal syndrome with Hashimoto thyroiditis in a 9-year-old girl: an autoimmune disorder.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Yun-Jin; Cheon, Chong Kun; Yeon, Gyu Min; Kim, Young Mi; Nam, Sang Ook\n\n2014-05-01\n\nMelkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS) is a rare disorder of unknown cause. The classical triad of MRS is orofacial edema, recurrent facial paralysis, and a fissured tongue. We present a 9-year-old girl with a recurrent peripheral facial paralysis. She experienced the first episode of a peripheral facial paralysis on the same side without orofacial swelling and lingua plicata 1 year ago. She was diagnosed with Hashimoto thyroiditis 9 months earlier, as confirmed by an endocrinologic investigation. While the patient was hospitalized with recurrent facial paralysis, we found that serum levels of free thyroxine (1.3 ng/dL) and thyrotropin (0.4 uIU/mL) were within normal range, but the level of antithyroperoxidase antibodies (772.0 IU/mL) was very increased. She had been taking an oral prednisolone orally for 2 weeks. At the 1-month follow-up, the patient's symptoms had completely disappeared. The possible correlation between MRS and autoimmune disorders has been documented in only one report, which described an adult with autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis) and MRS. We suggest that the co-occurrence of MRS and Hashimoto thyroiditis is not coincidental but linked to autoimmunity. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A 45-year-old woman was admitted to the authors' institution for left hemiparesis, dysarthria, and a comatose state caused by right orbital trauma from a thin metal rod. Brain MRI showed a right CCF and vasogenic edema of the right side of the brainstem, right temporal lobe, and basal ganglia. Digital subtraction angiography confirmed a high-flow direct CCF and revealed a hypoplastic second segment of the BVR responsible for the hypertension in inferior striate veins and venous congestion. Endovascular treatment was performed on an emergency basis. One month after treatment, the patient's symptoms and MRI signal abnormalities almost totally disappeared.

Therefore, kinase signaling is one important mechanism for regulating the protective function of XPA. Previous experiments have shown that spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) may mobilize XPA as a general stress response to chemical and physical ototoxicants. Therapeutic optimization of XPA via kinase signaling could serve as a means to improve DNA repair capacity within neurons following injury. The kinase signaling activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been shown in tumor cell lines to increase the repair of DNA damage products that are primarily repaired by XPA. Such observations suggest that EGFR may regulate the protective function of XPA. However, it is not known whether SGNs in particular or neurons in general could co-express XPA and EGFR. In the current study gene and protein expression of XPA and EGFR were determined from cochlear homogenates. Immunofluorescence assays were then employed to localize neurons expressing both EGFR and XPA within the ganglion. This work was then confirmed with double-immunohistochemistry. Rosenthal's canal served as the reference space in these experiments and design-based stereology was employed in first-order stereology quantification of immunoreactive neurons. The results confirmed that a population of SGNs that constitutively express XPA may also express the EGFR. These results provide the basis for future experiments designed to therapeutically manipulate the EGFR in order to regulate XPA activity and restore gene function in neurons following DNA damage.

The preservation of cultural sequences and archaeological artefacts represents especially a crucial issue in the case of caves opened to visitors. For this purpose, a better knowledge of these preserved environments that imprint paleoenvironmental conditions at the time of deposition is needed. In this context, different environmental parameters of the Pech Merle cave, in France, are currently actively monitored including temperature, hygrometry, and gas measurements such as CO2 and radon-222 (decay product of radium-226). This temporal monitoring needs to be complemented by a detailed characterisation of the site, including petrophysical and mineralogical properties. To better constrain the environmental and paleoenvironmental context, more than 100 samples including soils, sediments, rocks and speleothems were collected inside and outside the cave area. We report here magnetic properties of powdered samples (low-field susceptibility, hysteresis parameters, and saturation magnetization) coupled with effective radium concentration (ECRa) measurements. We observe that magnetic susceptibility, which ranges over 5 orders of magnitude from calcareous rocks to topsoils and argillaceous filling deposits, correlates well with ECRa values. This correlation, previously observed (Girault et al., 2016) in very different geological contexts, could be interpreted as a common concentration of sources, also indicating a signature of natural samples to the contrary of anthropic environments disturbed by human activities, in which case the association is blurred. This study demonstrates the general interest of combining two different parameters - here low-field magnetic susceptibility and effective radium concentration determined using non-destructive techniques in the field and in the laboratory - to physically characterize\n\nVoyage dans le noir.

The results showed that the thermodynamic analysis does not permit alone to explain the experimental measurements concerning the composition of the layer. The mass transport analysis showed that thermodiffusion would be of importance on layer composition and uniformity for large substrates.

In this pathological condition of the cochlea, type-1 spiral ganglion neurons in Rosenthal's canal play a vital role in the action potential initiation. Various morphological studies of the human temporal bones suggest that the spiral ganglion neurons are surrounded by heterogeneous structures formed by a variety of cells and tissues. However, the existing simulation models have not considered the tissue heterogeneity in the Rosenthal's canal while studying the electric field interaction with spiral ganglion neurons. Unlike the existing models, we have implemented the tissue heterogeneity in the Rosenthal's canal using a computationally inexpensive image based method in a two-dimensional finite element model. Our simulation results suggest that the spatial heterogeneity of surrounding tissues influences the electric field distribution in the Rosenthal's canal, and thereby alters the transmembrane potential of the spiral ganglion neurons. In addition to the academic interest, these results are especially useful to understand how the latest tissue regeneration methods such as gene therapy and drug-induced resprouting of peripheral axons, which probably modify the density of the tissues in the Rosenthal's canal, affect the cochlear implant functionality.\n\nMerlin C.

Each mission may set up a set of MATIS servers for processing its data products. MATIS embodies lessons learned in experience with prior instrument- data-product-generation software. MATIS is an event-driven workflow manager that interprets project-specific, user-defined rules for managing processes. It executes programs in response to specific events under specific conditions according to the rules. Because requirements of different missions are too diverse to be satisfied by one program, MATIS accommodates plug-in programs. MATIS is flexible in that users can control such processing parameters as how many pipelines to run and on which computing machines to run them. MATIS has a fail-safe capability. At each step, MATIS captures and retains pertinent information needed to complete the step and start the next step. In the event of a restart, this information is retrieved so that processing can be resumed appropriately. At this writing, it is planned to develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for monitoring and controlling a product generation engine in MATIS. The GUI would enable users to schedule multiple processes and manage the data products produced in the processes. Although MATIS was initially designed for instrument data product generation,\n\nEffects of different titanium zirconium implant surfaces on initial supragingival plaque formation.\n\nPubMed\n\nJohn, Gordon; Becker, JÃ¼rgen; Schwarz, Frank\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThe aim of the current study was the evaluation of biofilm development on different implant surfaces. Initial biofilm formation was investigated on five different implant surfaces, machined titanium (MTi), modified machined acid-etched titanium (modMATi), machined titanium zirconium (MTiZr), modified machined and acid-etched titanium zirconium (modMATiZr) and sandblasted large grid and acid-etched titanium zirconium surface (SLATiZr) for 24 and 48Â h. Biocompatibility was tested after tooth brushing of the samples via cell viability testing with human gingival fibroblasts. After 24Â h of biofilm collection, mean plaque surface was detected in the following descending order: After 24Â h: MTiZrÂ >Â MTiÂ >Â SLATiZrÂ >Â modMATiZrÂ >Â modMATi. Both M surfaces showed significant higher biofilm formation than the other groups. After 48Â h: MTiZrÂ >Â MTiÂ >Â SLATiZrÂ >Â modMATiZrÂ >Â modMATi. After tooth brushing: SLATiZrÂ >Â modMATiÂ >Â modMATiZrÂ >Â MTiÂ >Â MTiZr. All native samples depicted significant higher cell viability than their corresponding surfaces after biofilm removal procedure. The TiZr groups especially the modMATiZr group showed slower and less biofilm formation. In combination with the good biocompatibility, both modMA surfaces seem to be interesting candidates for surfaces in transgingival implant design. Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The aim of the present study was to determine the predictive value of clinical scoring and standardized, simplified gait analysis on the outcome after these fractures. Forty-one patients with acetabular fractures treated between 2008 and 2013 and available, standardized video recorded aftercare were identified from a prospective database. A visual gait score was used to determine the patients walking abilities 6-m postoperatively. Clinical (Merle d'Aubigne and Postel score, visual analogue scale pain, EQ5d) and radiological scoring (Kellgren-Lawrence score, postoperative computed tomography, and Matta classification) were used to perform correlation and multivariate regression analysis. The average patient age was 48Â y (range, 15-82Â y), six female patients were included in the study. Mean follow-up was 1.6Â y (range, 1-2Â y). Moderate correlation between the gait score and outcome (versus EQ5d: r s Â =Â 0.477; versus Merle d'Aubigne: r s Â =Â 0.444; versus Kellgren-Lawrence: r s Â =Â -0.533), as well as high correlation between the Merle d'Aubigne score and outcome were seen (versus EQ5d: r s Â =Â 0.575; versus Merle d'Aubigne: r s Â =Â 0.776; versus Kellgren-Lawrence: r s Â =Â -0.419). Using a multivariate regression model, the 6Â m gait score (BÂ =Â -0.299; PÂ <Â 0.05) and early osteoarthritis development (BÂ =Â 1.026; PÂ <Â 0.05) were determined as predictors of final osteoarthritis. A good fit of the regression model was seen (R 2 Â =Â 904). Easy and available clinical scoring (gait score/Merle d'Aubigne) can predict short-term radiological and functional outcome after acetabular fractures with sufficient accuracy. Decisions on further treatment and interventions could be based on simplified gait analysis. Copyright ÃÂ© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The equation has performed well in its original form or as modified. The expression has a significant limitation for application to gas metal arc welds (GMAW) that have a papilla extending from the root of the weld bead. The shape of the fusion line between the papilla and the plate surface has a concave shape rather than the expected convex shape. However, at some distance from the fusion line the heat affected zone (HAZ) made visible bymoreÂ Â» etching has the expected convex shape predicted by the Rosenthal expression. This anomaly creates a limitation to the use of the Rosenthal expression for predicting GMAW bead shapes or HAZ temperature histories. Current research at the Naval Surface Warfare Center--Carderock Division (NSWC--CD) to develop a computer based model to predict the microstructure of multi-pass GMAW requires a simple expression to predict the fusion line and temperature history of the HAZ for each weld pass. The solution employed for the NSWC--CD research is a modified Rosenthal expression that has a dual heat source. One heat source is a disk source above the plate surface supplying the majority of the heat. The second heat source is smaller and below the surface of the plate. This second heat source helps simulate the penetration power of many GMAW welds that produces the papilla. The assumptions, strengths and limitations of the model are presented along with some applications.Â«Â less\n\nPrevalence of unilateral and bilateral deafness in border collies and association with phenotype.\n\nPubMed\n\nPlatt, Simon; Freeman, Julia; di Stefani, Alberta; Wieczorek, Lara; Henley, William\n\n2006-01-01\n\nCongenital sensorineural deafness (CSD) occurs in Border Collies, but its prevalence and inheritance are unknown. This study estimated the prevalence of CSD in Border Collies and investigated its association with phenotypic attributes linked to the merle gene, including coat pigmentation and iris color. Deafness in Border Collies is associated with pigmentation patterns linked to the merle gene. A total of 2597 Border Collies from the United Kingdom. A retrospective study of Border Collies tested, during 1994-2002, by using brainstem auditory evoked responses. Associations between deafness and phenotypic attributes were assessed by using generalized logistic regression. The prevalence of CSD in puppies was estimated as 2.8%. The corresponding rates of unilateral and bilateral CSD were 2.3 and 0.5%, respectively. Adjustment for clustering of hearing status by litter reduced the overall prevalence estimate to 1.6%. There was no association between CSD and sex (P = .2). Deaf Border Collies had higher rates of merle coat pigmentation, blue iris pigment, and excess white on the head than normal hearing Border Collies (all P < .001). The odds of deafness were increased by a factor of 14 for Border Collies with deaf dams, relative to the odds for dogs with normal dams (P = .007), after adjustment for phenotypic attributes. Associations between CSD and pigmentation patterns linked to the merle gene were demonstrated for Border Collies. Evidence for an inherited component to CSD in Border Collies supports selective breeding from only tested and normal parents to reduce the prevalence of this disease.\n\nFlow impedance in a uniform magnetically insulated transmission line\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMendel, C.

H.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nDual alloy combinations have potential for use in aircraft engine components such as turbine disks where a wide range of stress and temperature regimes exists during operation. Such alloy combinations may directly result in the conservation of elements which are costly or not available domestically. Preferably, a uniform heat treatment yielding good properties for both alloys should be used. Dual alloy combinations of iron rich Alloy 901 with nickel base superalloys Rene 95, Astroloy, or MERL 76 were not isostatically pressed from prealloyed powders. Individual alloys, alloy mixtures, and layered alloy combinations were given the heat treatments specified for their use in turbine disks or appropriate for Alloy 901. Selected specimens were overaged for 1500 hr at 650 C. Metallographic examinations revealed the absence of phases not originally present in either alloy of a combination. Mechanical tests showed adequate properties in combinations of Rene 95 or Astroloy with Alloy 901 when given the Alloy 901 heat treatment. Combinations with MERL 76 had better properties when given the MERL 76 heat treatment. The results indicate that these combinations are promising candidates for use in turbine disks.\n\nLabral Reattachment in Femoroacetabular Impingement Surgery Results in Increased 10-year Survivorship Compared With Resection.\n\nPubMed\n\nAnwander, Helen; Siebenrock, Klaus A; Tannast, Moritz; Steppacher, Simon D\n\n2017-04-01\n\nSince the importance of an intact labrum for normal hip function has been shown, labral reattachment has become the standard method for open or arthroscopic treatment of hips with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). However, no long-term clinical results exist evaluating the effect of labral reattachment. A 2-year followup comparing open surgical treatment of FAI with labral resection versus reattachment was previously performed at our clinic. The goal of this study was to report a concise followup of these patients at a minimum of 10 years. We asked if patients undergoing surgical hip dislocation for the treatment of mixed-type FAI with labral reattachment compared with labral resection had (1) improved hip pain and function based on the Merle d'AubignÃ©-Postel score; and (2) improved survival at 10-year followup. Between June 1999 and July 2002, we performed surgical hip dislocation with femoral neck osteoplasty and acetabular rim trimming in 52 patients (60 hips) with mixed-type FAI. In the first 20 patients (25 hips) until June 2001, a torn labrum or a detached labrum in the area of acetabular rim resection was resected. In the next 32 patients (35 hips), reattachment of the labrum was performed. The same indications were used to perform both procedures during the periods in question. Of the 20 patients (25 hips) in the first group, 19 patients (95%) (24 hips [96%]) were available for clinical and/or radiographic followup at a minimum of 10 years (mean, 13 years; range, 12-14 years). Of the 32 patients (35 hips) in the second group, 29 patients (91%) (32 hips [91%]) were available for clinical and/or radiographic followup at a minimum of 10 years (mean, 12 years; range, 10-13 years).

This was based on the discovery in the late 60's of long-lived ion states throughout the ionization continuum of molecular ions. Here, an example is chosen from another fundamental system pioneered at this university. The mass-analyzed threshold ionization (MATI) spectra of jet-cooled chromium bisarene complexes (Î·(6)-RPh)(2)Cr (R = Me (1), Et (2), i-Pr (3), and t-Bu (4)) have been measured and interpreted on the basis of DFT calculations. The MATI spectra of complexes 1 and 2 appear to reveal features arising from ionizations of the isomers formed by the rotation of one arene ring relative to the other. The 1 and 2 MATI spectra show two intense peaks corresponding to the 0(0)(0) ionizations with inverse intensity ratios. As indicated by the DFT calculations, the intensity ratio change on going from 1 to 2 results from different isomers contributing to each MATI peak. The ionization energies corresponding to the 0(0)(0) peaks are 42746 Â± 5 and 42809 Â± 5 cm(-1) for compound 1 and 42379 Â± 5 and 42463 Â± 5 cm(-1) for complex 2. The 1 and 2 spectra show also the weaker features representing transitions to the vibrationally excited cationic levels, the signals of individual rotamers being detected and assigned on the basis of calculated vibrational frequencies. The MATI spectra of compounds 3 and 4 reveal only one strong peak because of close ionization potentials of the isomers contributing to the MATI signal. The 3 and 4 ionization energies are 42104 Â± 5 and 41917 Â± 5 cm(-1), respectively. The precise values of ionization energies obtained from the MATI spectra reveal a nonlinear dependence of the IE on the number of Me groups in the alkyl substituents of (Î·(6)-RPh)(2)Cr. This can be explained by an increase in the molecular zero point energies on methylation of the substituents.\n\n77 FR 46961 - Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Wisconsin; Volatile Organic Compound Emission...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2012-08-07\n\n... holidays.

Dr Mitchell Rosenthal and other leaders in rehabilitation began the process of advocating for TBI services more than 25 years ago, before many in the field fully appreciated the necessity of these efforts. Since that time, substantial gains have been made through advocacy efforts on behalf of individuals with TBI and their families. This article provides an overview of the TBI advocacy movement, highlighting federal legislation resulting in appropriations for TBI services and protecting the rights of individuals with TBI. Key government entities engaged in developing states' TBI infrastructure and providing services to individuals with TBI and their families are also discussed. In addition to celebrating some of the successes that were initiated by the efforts of Dr Rosenthal and other visionaries, select shortcoming of current legislation is noted to provide insights regarding future advocacy needs.\n\nAn Examination of the Effect of External Influences on the Soviet Negotiation Position in Post 1962 Arms Control Agreements\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1978-06-09\n\nBolsheviks inherited not only the geography and â¢ natural resources of Russia, but also the people and the his- tory and the culture.

This article explores the ethnopedology of bamboo (Bambusa sp.) based agroforestry system in North East India, and establishes the relationship of soil quality index (SQI) with bamboo productivity. The study revealed four basic folk soil (mati) types: kalo (black soil), lal (red soil), pathal (stony soil) and balu (sandy soil). Of these, lal mati soil was the most predominant soil type (~ 40%) in bamboo-based agroforestry system. Soil physio-chemical parameters were studied to validate the farmers' soil hierarchal classification and also to correlate with productivity of the bamboo stand. Farmers' hierarchal folk soil classification was consistent with the laboratory scientific analysis. Culm production (i.e. measure of productivity of bamboo) was the highest (27culmsclump(-1)) in kalo mati (black soil) and the lowest (19culmsclump(-1)) in balu mati (sandy soil). Linear correlation of individual soil quality parameter with bamboo productivity explained 16 to 49% of the variability. A multiple correlation of the best fitted linear soil quality parameter (soil organic carbon or SOC, water holding capacity or WHC, total nitrogen) with productivity improved explanatory power to 53%. Development of SQI from ten relevant soil quality parameters and its correlation with bamboo productivity explained the 64% of the variation and therefore, suggest SQI as the best determinant of bamboo yield. Data presented indicate that the kalo mati (black soil) is sustainable or sustainable with high input. However, the other three folk soil types (red, stony and sandy soil) are also sustainable but for other land uses. Therefore, ethnopedological studies may move beyond routine laboratory analysis and incorporate SQI for assessing the sustainability of land uses managed by the farmers'.

With a lifetime risk of 1 in 60 and an annual incidence of 11-40/100,000 population, the condition resolves completely in around 71% of the untreated cases. Clinical trials performed for Bell's palsy have reported some recurrences, ipsilateral or contralateral to the side affected in the primary episode of facial palsy. Only few data are found in the literature. Melkersson-Rosenthal is a rare neuromucocutaneous syndrome characterized by recurrent facial paralysis, fissured tongue (lingua plicata), orofacial edema. We attempted to analyze some clinical and epidemiologic aspects of recurrent idiopathic palsy, and to develop relevant correlations between the existing data in literature and those obtained in this study. This is a retrospective study carried out on a 10-years period for adults and a five-year period for children. A number of 185 patients aged between 4 and 70 years old were analyzed. 136 of them were adults and 49 were children. 22 of 185 patients with Bell's palsy (12%) had a recurrent partial or complete facial paralysis with one to six episodes of palsy. From this group of 22 cases, 5 patients were diagnosed with Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. The patients' age was between 4 and 70 years old, with a medium age of 27,6 years. In the group studied, fifteen patients, meaning 68%, were women and seven were men. The majority of patients in our group with more than two facial palsy episodes had at least one episode on the contralateral side. Our study found a significant incidence of recurrences of idiopathic facial palsy. Recurrent idiopathic facial palsy and Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is diagnosed more often in young females. Recurrence is more likely to occur in the first two years from the onset, which leads to the conclusion that we should have a follow up of patients\n\nModified porous tantalum rod technique for the treatment of femoral head osteonecrosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPakos, Emilios E; Megas, Panayiotis; Paschos, Nikolaos K; Syggelos, Spyridon A; Kouzelis, Antonios; Georgiadis, Georgios; Xenakis, Theodoros A\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAIM: To study a modified porous tantalum technique for the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head. METHODS: The porous tantalum rod was combined with endoscopy, curettage, autologous bone grafting and use of bone marrow aspirates from iliac crest aspiration in 49 patients (58 hips) with a mean age of 38 years. The majority of the patients had idiopathic osteonecrosis, followed by corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis. Thirty-eight hips were of Steinberg stage II disease and 20 hips were of stage III disease. Patients were followed for 5 years and were evaluated clinically with the Merle DâAubigne and Postel score and radiologically. The primary outcome of the study was survival based on the conversion to total hip arthroplasty (THA). Secondary outcomes included deterioration of the osteonecrosis to a higher disease stage at 5 years compared to the preoperative period and identification of factors that were associated with survival. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to evaluate the survivorship of the prosthesis, and the Fisher exact test was performed to test associations between various parameters with survival. RESULTS: No patient developed any serious intraoperative or postoperative complication including implant loosening or migration and donor site morbidity. During the 5-year follow up, 1 patient died, 7 patients had disease progression and 4 hips were converted to THA. The 5-year survival based on conversion to THA was 93.1% and the respective rate based on disease progression was 87.9%. Stage II disease was associated with statistically significant better survival rates compared to stage III disease (P = 0.04). The comparison between idiopathic and non-idiopathic osteonecrosis and between steroid-induced and non-steroid-induced osteonecrosis did not showed any statistically significant difference in survival rates.

The cup-cage (CC) construct, where an ilioischial cage is cemented within a biologically fixed porous metal cup, has emerged as an excellent option to treat such challenges. We sought to determine (1) mid-term Kaplan-Meier survival; (2) clinical outcomes based on Merle d'AubignÃ©-Postel scores; (3) radiological outcomes based primarily on construct migration; and (4) the complication rate for a series of 67 CC procedures performed at our institution. All hip revision procedures between January 2003 and March 2012 where a CC was used (with the exception of tumor cases or acute fracture; four total cases) that had a minimum 2-year followup and that had been seen within the last 2 years were included in this retrospective review. Acetabular bone loss and presence of pelvic discontinuity were assessed according to the Gross classification. Sixty-seven CC procedures with an average followup of 74 months (range, 24-135 months; SD, 34.3) months were identified; 26 of 67 (39%) were Gross Type IV and 41 of 67 (61%) were Gross Type V (pelvic discontinuity). Postoperative clinical and radiological evaluation was done annually. Merle d'AubignÃ©-Postel scores were recorded and all radiographs were compared with the 6-week postoperative radiographs to evaluate for radiographic loosening or migration. Failure was defined as revision surgery for any cause, including infection. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier survival rate with revision for any cause representing failure was 93% (95% confidence interval [CI], 83.1-97.4), and the 10-year survival rate was 85% (95% CI, 67.2-93.8). The Merle d'AubignÃ©-Postel score improved significantly from a mean of 6 preoperatively to 13 postoperatively (p < 0.001).

Retrospective analysis of consecutive patients. Level 1 trauma center. A retrospective analysis of consecutive acetabulum patients treated by a single surgeon between 1999 and 2005 identified 6 patients with a form of anterior wall fracture without involvement of the pelvic brim. All fractures were treated operatively. Open reduction and internal fixation through an anterior surgical approach. Final radiographic appearance and modified Merle d'Aubigne score. All 6 cases demonstrated characteristics of an atypical fracture of the anterior wall, involving the anterior rim of the acetabulum similar in nature to those described for the posterior wall, rather than the standard anterior wall fracture type described by Letournel. Of the 6 cases that were identified, 5 had follow-up 1 year or greater with a mean modified Merle d'Aubigne Score of 17 (range: 17-18). A form of anterior wall acetabular fracture exists, which involves the anterior acetabular rim without involvement of the pelvic brim. It can occur in young patients with high-energy mechanisms of injury, as well as in the elderly with low-energy trauma. With appropriate surgical management, using a modified Smith-Peterson approach, good to excellent clinical outcomes should be expected.\n\nDigital Screening and Halftone Techniques for Raster Processing,\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1980-01-14\n\nI 7 A)-AO81 090 ARMY ENGINEER TOPOGRAPH4IC LASS FORT Bs.voiR VA 161/ OIGITAL SCREENING ANO HALFTONE TECNNIOUIES FOR RASTER PROCLPSINM-.TC(U) JAN GO R...

Being inhibited by its reaction product, MATII isoform upregulation cannot compensate for MATI/III decrease. Therefore, MAT1A:MAT2A switch contributes to decrease in SAM level in rodent and human hepatocarcinogenesis. SAM administration to carcinogen-treated rats prevents hepatocarcinogenesis, whereas MAT1A-KO mice, characterized by chronic SAM deficiency, exhibit macrovesicular steatosis, mononuclear cell infiltration in periportal areas, and HCC development. This review focuses upon the pleiotropic changes, induced by MAT1A/MAT2A switch, associated with HCC development. Epigenetic control of MATs expression occurs at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In HCC cells, MAT1A/MAT2A switch is associated with global DNA hypomethylation, decrease in DNA repair, genomic instability, and signaling deregulation including c-MYC overexpression, rise in polyamine synthesis, upregulation of RAS/ERK, IKK/NF-kB, PI3K/AKT, and LKB1/AMPK axis. Furthermore, decrease in MAT1A expression and SAM levels results in increased HCC cell proliferation, cell survival, and microvascularization. All of these changes are reversed by SAM treatment in vivo or forced MAT1A overexpression or MAT2A inhibition in cultured HCC cells. In human HCC, MAT1A:MAT2A and MATI/III:MATII ratios correlate negatively with cell proliferation and genomic instability, and positively with apoptosis and global DNA methylation. This suggests that SAM decrease and MATs deregulation represent potential therapeutic targets for HCC. Finally, MATI/III:MATII ratio strongly predicts patients' survival length suggesting that MAT1A:MAT2A expression ratio is a putative prognostic marker for human HCC.

Recurrence is more likely to occur in the first two years from the onset, which\n\nTemporal Drivers of Liking Based on Functional Data Analysis and Non-Additive Models for Multi-Attribute Time-Intensity Data of Fruit Chews.\n\nPubMed\n\nKuesten, Carla; Bi, Jian\n\n2018-06-03\n\nConventional drivers of liking analysis was extended with a time dimension into temporal drivers of liking (TDOL) based on functional data analysis methodology and non-additive models for multiple-attribute time-intensity (MATI) data. The non-additive models, which consider both direct effects and interaction effects of attributes to consumer overall liking, include Choquet integral and fuzzy measure in the multi-criteria decision-making, and linear regression based on variance decomposition. Dynamics of TDOL, i.e., the derivatives of the relative importance functional curves were also explored. Well-established R packages 'fda', 'kappalab' and 'relaimpo' were used in the paper for developing TDOL. Applied use of these methods shows that the relative importance of MATI curves offers insights for understanding the temporal aspects of consumer liking for fruit chews.\n\nGenotypes of predomestic horses match phenotypes painted in Paleolithic works of cave art.\n\nPubMed\n\nPruvost, Melanie; Bellone, Rebecca; Benecke, Norbert; Sandoval-Castellanos, Edson; Cieslak, Michael; Kuznetsova, Tatyana; Morales-MuÃ±iz, Arturo; O'Connor, Terry; Reissmann, Monika; Hofreiter, Michael; Ludwig, Arne\n\n2011-11-15\n\nArchaeologists often argue whether Paleolithic works of art, cave paintings in particular, constitute reflections of the natural environment of humans at the time. They also debate the extent to which these paintings actually contain creative artistic expression, reflect the phenotypic variation of the surrounding environment, or focus on rare phenotypes. The famous paintings \"The Dappled Horses of Pech-Merle,\" depicting spotted horses on the walls of a cave in Pech-Merle, France, date back ~25,000 y, but the coat pattern portrayed in these paintings is remarkably similar to a pattern known as \"leopard\" in modern horses. We have genotyped nine coat-color loci in 31 predomestic horses from Siberia, Eastern and Western Europe, and the Iberian Peninsula. Eighteen horses had bay coat color, seven were black, and six shared an allele associated with the leopard complex spotting (LP), representing the only spotted phenotype that has been discovered in wild, predomestic horses thus far. LP was detected in four Pleistocene and two Copper Age samples from Western and Eastern Europe, respectively. In contrast, this phenotype was absent from predomestic Siberian horses. Thus, all horse color phenotypes that seem to be distinguishable in cave paintings have now been found to exist in prehistoric horse populations, suggesting that cave paintings of this species represent remarkably realistic depictions of the animals shown. This finding lends support to hypotheses arguing that cave paintings might have contained less of a symbolic or transcendental connotation than often assumed.\n\nElectrical Transport Through Tunnel Barriers and Thin Dielectric Layers and Physical Properties of the High Tc Oxide Superconductors\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1990-03-26\n\nSmith, D.B.

As consequences, we obtain a new characterization of ( p, 1)-summing linear operators on C(K) in terms of their representing measures and a new multilinear characterization of L â spaces. We also solve a problem stated by M.S. Ramanujan and E. Schock, improve a result of H. P. Rosenthal and S. J.
