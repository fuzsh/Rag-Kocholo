The people were absolutely incredible and so were the ways they took care of and invested in their patients. There are so many unique opportunities for community engagement and so many brilliant patient advocates and change makers. I wanted to be part of a program that would provide a multitude of opportunities for advocacy work in clinical, community, and legislative spaces, and UAB had it all!\n\nHobbies/Special Interests\n\nReading (thrillers, mystery), cooking, piano, trying new coffee shops!\n\nFun Fact\n\nI used to be a competitive slam poet!\n\nHometown\n\nBelmont, NC / Lafayette, LA\n\nUndergraduate\n\nUniversity of Louisiana at Monroe\n\nMedical School\n\nLouisiana State University - Shreveport\n\nCareer/Clinical Interests\n\nCurrently keeping my mind open, but I’ve always been interested in Academic Medicine and possibly Combined Heme/Onc!\n\nWhy did you choose UAB Med-Peds Residency Program?\n\nI loved how close-knit this program was and how evident it was even through a computer screen. I wanted to be at a place where I felt supported not only by my fellow residents, but by leadership as well. I was blown away during my interview and second look because I could tell that the leadership was very supportive of their residents’ wellness, and of their personal and professional goals. The categorical programs are very strong, and I knew training here would make me both a great internist and pediatrician. The beautiful city of Birmingham is just a plus to all this program has to offer!\n\nHobbies/Special Interests\n\nReading, Painting, Crochet, Nail Art.\n\nFun Fact\n\nI was in an arts academy in high school for painting and graphic design- and I still love doing artsy things!

Some of it lies in the combination of balanced training with exceptional categorical programs on each side in a physically connected hospital system that facilitates Med-Peds unity even in a big system. Some of it is the catchment area and mix of tertiary/quaternary care with care of the underserved all in the same place. Some of it is the emphasis on teaching and learning at all levels and creating psychologically safe learning environments. But most of it is feeling like I was already so embraced and loved by a community I simply could not imagine leaving! So thankful I get to be part of the UAB MedPeds family!\n\nHobbies/Special Interests\n\nTennis, mountain biking, running, church/college ministry, game nights with friends, coffee shops, Broadway (sibling trips to NYC), Disney!\n\nFun Fact\n\nMy father and I are trying to see a game at every major league baseball stadium together.\n\nHometown\n\nParis, KY\n\nUndergraduate\n\nTransylvania University\n\nMedical School\n\nUniversity of Kentucky\n\nCareer/Clinical Interests\n\nMed-Peds primary care and maybe inpatient adult medicine, but keeping my options open!\n\nWhy did you choose UAB Med-Peds Residency Program?\n\nTrue connections that I made during my interview and how genuine everyone was.

From my very first interactions, I immediately connected with residents and faculty in Med-Peds, Medicine, and Pediatrics. Additionally, the patient population here is similar to where I hope to practice and the culture at UAB is one which truly supports and encourages resident well being.\n\nHobbies/Special Interests\n\nHiking (locally, love Oak Mountain with my husband and two kids!), currently on a quest to find the best pizza in Birmingham, cycling, reading (fav: The Sun Still Shines), and baking.\n\nFun Fact\n\nI once sang the National Anthem at an Atlanta Braves game and before a sitting US President.\n\nHometown\n\nHuntsville, Al\n\nUndergraduate\n\nAuburn University\n\nMedical School\n\nHeersink School of Medicine\n\nCareer/Clinical Interests\n\nCombined hospitalists, academic medicine\n\nWhy did you choose UAB Med-Peds Residency Program?\n\nI chose UAB Med-Peds because of the strong balance of medicine and pediatrics.

I would love to care for largely underserved populations. I'm passionate about global health and forming sustainable partnerships with other physicians, hospitals, and clinics in different areas around the world. I'm also very interested in the study of infectious disease!\n\nWhy did you choose UAB Med-Peds Residency Program?\n\nI love the culture at UAB. I knew that I would have the opportunity to learn from top-notch clinicians on both the IM and Peds side. The leadership of the Med-Peds program and both of the categorical programs truly care about our development as people with lives outside of the hospital, too!\n\nHobbies/Special Interests\n\nReading (theology/philosophy/history), Sports, Music/Concerts, Outdoors Activities (hiking, skiing, tennis)\n\nFun Fact\n\nI used to work at a deli in Nashville and cooked for country music stars Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, and others.

They are invested in your personal success both in and outside of the hospital. Moving from another state, I couldn’t be more appreciative to have made a new family here with the wonderful people at UAB. It was important to me to train at a Med-Peds program that offered equally strong training on both sides. UAB has the perfect mix of local engagement as well as a national reputation for excellence in medicine.\n\nHobbies/Special Interests\n\nCooking, baking, running, game nights with friends, Peloton, exploring BHAM!\n\nFun Fact\n\nMy husband is an oral surgery resident at UAB and we've both inadvertently started saying \"y'all\" since moving down here!\n\nHometown\n\nHoover, AL\n\nUndergraduate\n\nAuburn University\n\nMedical School\n\nHeersink School of Medicine\n\nCareer/Clinical Interests\n\nAdolescent medicine, transitional care, some form of inpatient and outpatient (all the things)\n\nWhy did you choose UAB Med-Peds Residency Program?\n\nI was really fortunate and lucky to have been able to work with a lot of the MedPeds residents as a medical student; they were half the reason why I decided to go into MedPeds! I chose to stay at UAB for the residents, the leadership, and the incredibly strong categorical programs on either side!\n\nWhat do you love about UAB Med-Peds?\n\nEveryone here is just incredibly supportive of one another and down to earth.

Other than the fantastic training, I was truly interested in a program that was open and willing to have honest conversations about increasing diversity and minority representation within their program. I also had a really fun virtual interview day!\n\nWhat do you love about UAB Med-Peds?\n\nThis program leadership has been phenomenal. They reached out to offer honest advice early on in 4th year and that advice has only increased since then. For every good and bad experience, I know that if I hear from no one else, I am going to hear from my PDs, APDs and Chief. I think I talk to/text with my PD every single day. Is that weird? That might be weird. You don't have to put this part if it's weird.\n\nBirmingham's Best Food and/or Drink\n\nChez FonFon if you want to be fancy. Encore Rouge Food Truck if you aren't on any sort of diet. Big Bad Breakfast, ABE, FIVE or Over Easy if you are looking for brunch. Slice if you want a good low carb pizza.\n\nBirmingham Must-See\n\nHmmm. Tough. I'm not really an outdoors, hiking, nature person so I'm probably not the best person to answer this questions. There's some monument, viking man thing that people talk about. Apparently people like the mountains around here. But, the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute is really nice.\n\nHometown\n\nHuntsville, AL\n\nUndergraduate\n\nAuburn University\n\nMedical School\n\nHeersink School of Medicine\n\nCareer/Clinical Interests\n\nMedical education, hospital medicine, infectious diseases\n\nWhat do you love about UAB Med-Peds?\n\nSince I had the privilege of being a medical student here at UAB, I was able to see that both the IM and Peds programs here truly display excellence without ego. Also, the Med-Peds residents were always my favorite to work with on the wards.\n\nWhat are the strengths of UAB Med-Peds?\n\nThe support! The UAB Med-Peds family is no joke.\n\nBirmingham's Best Food and/or Drink\n\nPost Office Pies, Ono Poke, Back Forty, Soho Social, Blue Pacific, Seoul Restaurant\n\nBirmingham Must-See\n\nHometown Supermarket! I know it’s strange to recommend a grocery store, but for those who love international cooking, this place is truly top notch. I could spend hours in there!"
