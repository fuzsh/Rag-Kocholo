        "text": "Engaging Caregivers in Patient-Oriented Research: Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Retreat for Mothers of Pediatric Heart Transplant Recipients\n\nThis research is driven by patient- and family-identified needs to support the quality of life and wellbeing of mothers of pediatric heart transplant recipients. It leverages Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), delivered at an ecological retreat, as an innovative intervention to meaningfully address the complexities of caregiving and caregiver burden. A mixed-methods design will be employed to examine potential changes in maternal coping styles, distress tolerance, quality of life and perceived social support following the intervention – a MBSR retreat. The retreat will be comprised of mindfulness exercises such as circle sharing, deep relaxation, yoga and walking meditation. Guided by the experiential expertise of our patient partner, Joanna Mitchell, this research places a strong emphasis on patient- and family-centred care, targeting the intersection of maternal wellbeing and child health outcomes within pediatric transplantation.\n\nJoanna Mitchell’s bio\n\nJoanna Mitchell is the mother to 16-year-old Ryley who received a heart transplant at 7 months of age. Soon after Ryley’s transplant, the Mitchell Family became involved as volunteers with the Trillium Gift of Life Network to encourage others to consider organ donation by sharing Ryley’s story. Joanna and Ryley were presented with the TGLN Board of Directors Champion Award in 2017 for their contribution to raising awareness for organ donation.\n\nWhen Ryley was 5, she participated in her first Canadian Transplant Games and the family became involved with the Canadian Transplant Association. With the CTA, Joanna has helped to organize various events to promote both organ donation and healthy active living after transplantation. Joanna has also worked as a parent liaison to bring a pediatric and family perspective to the transplant games. She encourages connections of transplant families by facilitating various social media groups and informal mentorship.\n\nJoanna became a patient caregiver partner with Canadian Donation and Transplantation Research Program more recently with a focus on projects related to pediatrics and the mental health of not only the transplant patient but the family as a whole.\n\nSamantha J. Anthony’s bio\n\nDr. Samantha J. Anthony is a Health Clinician Scientist in the Child Health Evaluative Sciences Program of the Research Institute at the Hospital for Sick Children.

Dr. Anthony is also an Investigator with the Canadian Donation and Transplantation Research Program.\n\nDr. Anthony has been recognized for her dedication to clinical practice and the application of research for improved patient outcomes. Her program of research centres on establishing an evidence-based foundation for successful psychosocial adaptation and enhanced quality of life for individuals with chronic disease, with a specific focus on pediatric solid-organ transplantation. Dr. Anthony has received national academic scholarships and has obtained competitive grants and research awards, including funding from Health Canada, CIHR, Canadian Child Health Clinician Scientist Program, Enduring Hearts, Kidney Foundation of Canada and The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.\n\nSupporting Caregivers: Observations of a Transplant Social Worker\n\nPsychosocial assessments are a required component of a comprehensive transplant work-up. One aspect of this assessment is determining the breadth and depth of a patient’s support system. The transplant team, often the social worker, will provide direction to the support person about expectations of the healthcare team pre, peri and post transplant. While recommendations about resources for support people are often made, there is a paucity of support for caregivers, as the focus is primarily on the patient. There is a need for more funding and resources for caregivers of transplant patients, as they are a vital component to transplant success.\n\nDee Miner’s bio\n\nDee Miner has both a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in clinical social work from the University of Calgary. She has been practicing medical social work with Alberta Health Services for 18 years. Her last 14 years have been as the Liver and Lungtransplant social worker for the Southern Alberta Transplant Program at Foothills Hospital in Calgary. In addition to supporting patients both pre and post transplant, she is responsible for completing the psychosocial assessments prior to transplant listing. To date her research has been focused on teaching coping skills to pre-transplant patients.\n\nImproving Engagement and Empowering Patients on Their Transplant Journey\n\nNavigating the organ donation and transplantation (ODT) system in Canada can be complex and confusing for people on a transplant journey. This qualitative study embraces the power of lived experience to guide and inform a truly patient-driven project in which research priorities have been defined by patients, families and donors. The online survey and focus groups central to the project were co-designed with patient research partners using an extensive iterative approach. Engaging patients from across Canada at every step of the research process is yielding a better understanding of the lived experiences of those on a transplant journey and will be instrumental in developing patient-led and patient-focused recommendations for long term improvements to the ODT system.\n\nCarrie Thibodeau’s bio\n\nCarrie Thibodeau is serving as project lead for a qualitative study called Improving Engagement and EmpoweringPatients on their Transplant Journey. Her educational background is in the fields of applied health sciences and communications, and the focus of her professional career has been on kidney health.\n\nShe has worked closely with both patients and medical professionals for many years, and she has collaborated on multiple projects with the Kidney Foundation of Canada. On a personal level, Carrie has a close family connection to the renal and transplant communities. Her youngest uncle (and de facto big brother)is a three-time kidney transplant recipient and is now undergoing hemodialysis. His experiences have had a profound impact on Carrie both personally and professionally. This project has been an opportunity to be part of a team responsible for ensuring that patients’ lived experiencesare central to the decisions being made about how best to manage organ donation and transplantation in Canada.\n\nKristi Coldwell’s bio\n\nKristi Coldwell is the Senior Advisor for Transplant Research Advocacy at the Transplant Research Foundation of BC.

Prior to that, my entire career had been in respiratory therapy. I was a severe asthmatic growing up and found comfort from the respiratory therapists and nurses who were able to help me breathe. This influence led me to flourish in a career as a respiratory therapist in Ontario and BC since 2008.\n\nAs a respiratory therapist, we are a big part of end of life care in the ICU. My experiences with seeing organ donation as a silver lining for families and for patients receiving a second chance at life, is what inspired me to learn more about career opportunities with BC Transplant.\n\nPersonally in 2018, I was diagnosed with a condition called keratoconus which affected my ability to see. In 2019 I almost lost complete vision in my left eye and was waitlisted for a cornea transplant. A few months later, I received my cornea transplant and was gifted the gift of sight again. This allowed me to continue my work in health care and provide care for my children. I feel honoured to be able to work for BC Transplant and help coordinate life-saving transplants.”\n\nPatient-oriented research and building cultural competency – Indigenous perspectives\n\nMary, Karmen and Craig are all Indigenous patient partners with experiences ranging from being on the pre-transplant waitlist while on hemodialysis, to successful kidney transplant with jurisdictional issues and living kidney donor experience.

In my second postdoc with Dr. Ted Steiner, I looked at the influence of stress (ATP, active oxygen) on intestinal cell sensing of bacterial flagellin; did strange (but gentle) things to mice to further the understanding of inflammatory bowel disease. I moved to a research associate position with Kirk Schultz, who specializes in leukemia immunotherapy. In his lab I organized his clinical research trials, ran yet more ELISAs and dabbled a bit on the side in the immunostimulatory properties of mitochondrial DNA, among other things. Finally I have landed in Megan’s hardcore adaptive immunology lab where I am all about developing and standardizing assays for the clinical setting. One project aims to stratify patients with autoimmune disease based on likely response to biologicals, another deals with immune monitoring of post-transplant patients by flow cytometry.\n\nMy prevailing interest is in the conflict between self and everything that is not self (including altered self-cancer, and somebody else’s self-transplant).

One of the attacked organs is the kidney, leading to a disease called lupus nephritis (LN). LN is a serious manifestation, affecting 60% of adults with SLE. The attacked kidneys are then unable to filter waste products from the blood properly. About 30% of patients progress to end-stage renal disease where the kidneys no longer work. Patients then must go on dialysis or have a transplant to survive. During LN, the immune system attacks the blood vessels that deliver oxygen and nutrients to the kidneys. Our group has shown that attacked blood vessels, when they die, release messengers that can alert the immune system and induce the production of autoantibodies, antibodies directed against molecules of the individual himself. One of these molecules, “LG3”, is found on micro-vessels. Our group has also demonstrated that the autoantibodies directed against LG3, the anti-LG3, were important actors in the loss of micro-vessels in several kidney diseases and in the rejection of transplants. We have also demonstrated that anti-LG3 autoantibodies measured after kidney transplantation are associated with severe vascular rejection and that pre-transplant anti-LG3 levels are also associated with acute vascular rejection of renal allografts. We have found that these anti-LG3s were present in greater amounts in the blood of patients with LN as well as in mice with lupus. The objective of my project is to characterize the impact of anti-LG3 attack on kidney micro-vessels to identify new mechanisms and predictors of renal dysfunction. My project provides a unique opportunity to identify new intervention targets to develop tests and therapies that will help monitor\n\nand treat patients with LN to prevent the devastating effects of this disease and the need for transplantation.\n\nAlterations in muscle fiber types in children with end-stage liver disease undergoing liver transplantation\n\nIntroduction: Low muscle mass is common in children waiting for liver transplantation and can make recovery after transplant more difficult. Muscles are made up of different fibers which have different functions. Some muscle fibers are better for endurance activity (slow muscle fibers [type I]), where some are better for power and strength (fast muscle fibers [type IIA and IID]). Little is known how these muscle fibers are affected by the loss of muscle that happens with liver disease. This study aims to describe the differences in muscle (fiber types, and size) in children who have experienced loss of muscle and those who have not.\n\nMethods: Children were recruited from the Stollery Children’s Hospital Pediatric Transplant Clinics. Muscle mass was determined from MRI or CT scans done at time of transplant assessment and was corrected for height to determine muscle index (cm2/m2). Low muscle mass was determined by comparing muscle index of healthy controls to children with liver disease. Biopsy samples of the abdominal muscles were taken at time of transplant. Muscle fiber histology was performed to determine the amount and proportions of different types of muscle fibers present within the biopsy sample.\n\nResults: 18 children (0.3 – 15.0 years) have been recruited. 14 children have been transplanted, 2 subjects are currently awaiting transplant, and 2 have died waiting for transplant. The most common type of liver disease was biliary atresia (39%), followed by Alagille’s syndrome (17%) and other (44%). A total of 33.3% of children had low muscle mass. The percentage of fiber types were: type I (56.8 ± 11.1%), type IIA (47.3% ± 16.6%) and type IID (8.2 ± 3.2%). However, no differences were seen the proportions of muscle fibers in children with and without low muscle mass.\n\nConclusions: This data suggests that children with liver disease who have normal muscle mass and low muscle mass both have similar proportions of muscle fiber types.\n\nA Qualitative Descriptive Study of Kidney Transplant Recipients Who Experience Graft Loss: A Forgotten Cohort\n\nBackground: Kidney transplantation (KT) is the best treatment for patients with kidney failure. But a KT does not last forever and many patients will eventually lose their transplanted kidney. There is barely any research about the experiences of patients who have lost a transplanted kidney. Also, no research has looked at how these patients decide what to do next – for example, whether or not to get another transplant. Because there is so little research on this, our aims are to: i) understand the experiences of patients who have lost a transplanted kidney; ii) understand how they decide on treatment afterwards.\n\nMethods: This is a qualitative study, which means that we will gather information by talking to people who have lost a transplanted kidney to find out about their experiences and what they think. Firstly, we will ask 30 people who have lost a KT to keep a diary for six months, where they can write about their experiences. After that, we will interview them to talk about these experiences.\n\nAnticipated findings: The findings of this study will be in-depth accounts about the experience of graft loss, in the words of the people who experience it. By finding out about the experience of losing a transplanted kidney from people directly, we can also make sure that strategies to improve healthcare for these patients are firmly based on their perspectives.\n\nSignificance: Understanding more about the experiences of people with a failed KT has been identified as a priority. There is so little research about what care patients need after a losing a transplanted kidney. Clearly, we need to know more about this from the perspective of patients so that we can improve care for them if their graft fails. Our study will get these perspectives and inform strategies to improve patient care.\n\nRegulatory T cell biomarkers identify patients at risk of developing acute cellular rejection in the first year following heart transplantation\n\nPatients receive heart transplants as a life-saving measure after heart failure; thus, ensuring the success of the transplant is of utmost importance. Rejection is one of the major causes for heart transplant failure, and consequently, patients must take drugs that suppress the immune system to prevent rejection. However, these drugs are unspecific and cause serious side effects that can be life-threatening. New immunosuppressive drugs that can prevent transplant rejection while allowing normal immune function can greatly improve care and patient outcomes. One type of immune cells called regulatory T cells (Tregs) can effectively suppress the immune system in a highly specific manner. We believe these cells can be effective in preventing and treating acute rejection. Working toward such a goal, we first sought to understand how Tregs behave during rejection. We tracked Tregs by measuring 36 genes (Treg-associated genes) in the blood of heart transplant patients throughout the first year post-transplant. We found that Treg-associated genes were downregulated not only at the time of acute rejection diagnosis but also in all samples from patients who developed acute rejection. This finding suggests a clear difference in Treg response between stable patients and rejectors. Measuring Tregs in heart transplant patients may help predict patients at higher risk of developing acute rejection.\n\nDonor-Recipient Weight Mismatch as a Risk Factor for Delayed Graft Function in Renal Transplantation\n\nBackground: Matching of kidney donors and recipients is an important predictor of outcomes following kidney transplantation. Studies have demonstrated weight pairing of donors and recipients (DR) to be particularly important for kidney graft outcomes. Recipients receiving organs from smaller donors have been shown to experience significantly worse outcomes than those receiving kidneys from weight-matched donors. With the rising rates of obesity amongst kidney transplants recipients, the impact of obesity in the setting of DR weight mismatch warrants investigation. We investigated the outcome of delayed graft function, defined as need for dialysis within the first 7 days following transplantation.\n\nMethods: We used a large database to identify kidney transplant recipients. We grouped DR according to their weight mismatch at time of transplantation, which yielded the following 4 groups: weight mismatched DR by &gt;30 kg and 10-30 kg (D&gt;R; D&lt;R). We separately grouped DR according to their obesity status, using a BMI cut point of 30 kg/m2 to identify obese vs. non-obese DR. We determined the likelihood of DGF for each of the DR weight mismatch groups compared to weight matched DR.\n\nResults: A total of 255,480 transplant recipients were included; 18% developed DGF. DGF was highest in the 30 kg weight-mismatched groups (22.4% for D&gt;R; 21.1% for D&lt;R). In all DR obesity pairings, D&lt;R by 30 kg was associated with the greatest risk of DGF versus no weight difference.\n\nConclusion: Our study demonstrated that the risk of DGF is highest in the setting where recipients are larger than their donors by 30 or more kg. This finding was observed irrespective of DR obesity status. This may be explained by more complicated surgery in the setting of larger recipient-to-donor size. This finding is supported by previous studies which have demonstrated DGF to be linked to more difficult and prolonged transplant surgery.\n\nAutoKV-Net: Calculating Single Kidney Volume in Two-Dimensional Ultrasound Automatically by Mimicking Sonographers\n\nMeasuring single kidney volume in ultrasound may be a useful surrogate biomarker for renal function, as the renogram requires scarce materials and high costs. Measuring volumes using ultrasound is a promising approach, but requires expertise to identify and measure. In this pilot study, we explored a machine learning approach to SKV estimation in 2D ultrasound cine clips in transplant and native kidneys. A machine learning algorithm was trained using 514 images that were annotated by the sonographers for the kidney capsule. A different set of 16 patients (32 cine clips, 16 volumes) were randomly selected. The sonographers measured the kidney lengths and widths in these cines. The trained algorithm processed the cines, and generated a prediction for the frame with maximum capsule area. It fit a bounding box to it, where the recentangle dimensions serve as the kidney dimensions. The annotators SKV measured was 220 ± 119 mL (95% CI: 162, 278), while the algorithm SKV measured was 224 ± 109 mL (95% CI: 171, 277) with no significant differences. The mean absolute difference was 4 mL while the mean relative difference was 6.7%. For comparison, a +0.1 cm error in each of the algorithm’s measured dimensions using the same volume equation would result in an absolute difference of 78 mL and a relative difference of 42%. There was no performance difference between native kidneys and transplanted kidneys. Manual measurements require 5 to 10 minutes, whereas the algorithm requires &lt; 10 seconds. In this pilot study, an automatic algorithm to measure SKV from 2D ultrasound cines was demonstrated to be comparable to expert estimates of volume. Such a technique may permit for the automatic, rapid and reliable measurement of SKV using conventional standard 2D ultrasound imaging. Future work includes correlation against renogram functional tests and prospective validation of the technique.\n\nMarie-Josée Hébert’s bio\n\nMarie-Josée Hébert earned a specialized degree in nephrology at the Université de Montréal, followed by postdoctoral studies at Harvard.

After a shocking diagnosis of kidney failure, he received a kidney transplant at the age of 15 from his father. Once healed, he wanted to try and continue service to his community as best he could, and, in 2012 was accepted in the University of Saskatchewan College of Pharmacy, where he was fortunate enough to contribute to a patient education project for patients in renal failure and those receiving transplants. In his time at the U of S, he continued to serve as the Finance Officer for the Canadian Association of Pharmacy Students and Interns. Graduating in 2016, he entered community practice, while also contributing to research projects, mentoring and teaching pharmacy students, acting as a guest speaker for the patient experience of the journey of a kidney transplant patient, as well as regular continuing education presentations for healthcare workers. Paraag also has made it a point to speak with patients in his area, such as presenting to retirement homes, assisted living facilities and seniors groups about various health topics, and also currently sits on the Board of Directors for the Pharmacy Association of Saskatchewan.

While it is rare for him to have contact with a donor family and recipient linked to the same organ donation-transplantation event, his contact with families who have lived experience with organ donation on the one hand, and patients who have received transplants on the other hand has provided opportunities to explore how their journeys become linked when they attempt to make sense of and find meaning in their respective crises.\n\nSean has recently completed his PhD at the University of Canberra, Australia. His study explored the bereavement experiences of families of potential organ donors. In preparation for the empirical component of his research, he completed several systematic literature reviews which each explore aspects of the experiences of families of organ donors, transplant recipients, and healthcare professionals.\n\nOne of those reviews sought to understand the relationship that develops between families of organ donors and transplant recipients. Drawing on literature from both sides of this relationship, a number of interesting observations were made. His presentation will focus on these observations, his experiences supporting families of organ donors and transplant recipients, and the findings of recent international studies that have explored the relationship and needs of the parties involved.\n\nSusan Q. McKenzie\n\nSusan is an experienced communications and fundraising professional who has worked to advance a number of charities across Canada. In 2010, after a year on dialysis, she received a new kidney from her husband’s sister. The fear and isolation of that experience planted the first seeds in her mind that much more needed to be done to help others with kidney disease. Two of Susan’s three daughters have also been diagnosed with a rare genetic mutation (MUC1) which ultimately leads to kidney failure.\n\nWhen Susan’s middle daughter needed a kidney transplant in 2017, helping her daughter try to navigate the healthcare system in search of a living donor, further underscored the critical role of patients and donors stepping up to help each other through this very difficult time. Not being a person to step away from a challenge, Susan began working with fellow patients, kidney donors, and researchers to establish the Transplant Ambassador Program (TAP), a volunteer driven, peer support program which has been helping kidney patients and donors navigate the transplant journey since 2017.\n\nToday, TAP has over 150 Ambassadors, and has been launched in all 27 renal centres in Ontario. TAP recently launched additional innovative features to support patients and living donors, including a new Ambassador Directory, and a first-in-Canada service, Patients Seeking Donors, which allows patients to post a profile on a safe and secure website to help them in their search for a living donor.\n\nJennifer Conway’s bio\n\nDr. Jennifer Conway is a Cardiologist at the Stollery and an Associate Professor at the University of Alberta Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry.

Her research project is taking place in the CHUM research center (CRCHUM), particularly in the Hepato-neuro laboratory where she is interested in malnutrition and sarcopenia before and after liver transplantation\n\nLongitudinal evolution of nutritional risk and muscle function of patients waiting for liver transplantation and the effect of early nutritional intervention following the transplantation\n\nAisha Adil, Golnaz Karoubi, Siba Haykal\n\nIn patients living with cirrhosis and waiting for liver transplantation (LT), protein-energy malnutrition is the most common complication (&gt; 80%). After LT, nutritional status can worsen rapidly leading to sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass and function).\n\nObjectives: 1) Assess longitudinal changes in nutritional risk, muscle function and quality of life in cirrhotic patients awaiting LT. 2) Evaluate the effect of early nutritional supplementation rich in protein, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) and energy, after LT, on muscle mass and function, nutritional risk and quality of life.\n\nMethod: A randomized controlled pilot study is conducted including 30 patients going through LT. Muscle mass (CT scan), muscle function (chair stand test), nutritional risk (liver disease undernutrition screening tool) and quality of life (SF-36) are assessed every 3 months before LT, immediately after discharge from hospital and 12 weeks post-LT. At LT, participants are randomized in: (1) intervention group (n=15) receiving standard nutritional care as well as supplements rich in protein, HMB and energy for 12 weeks and (2) control group (n=15) receiving standard nutritional care.\n\nResults: Currently, 26 patients awaiting LT are included. One participant was transplanted. The mean age is 51.3 ± 12.9 years. The most common etiology is alcohol (33 %). 84 % of patients are at risk of malnutrition which remain unchanged within up to one year on the waitlist. Muscle function is impaired (18.1 ± 11.0 s vs. 12.6 s in healthy patients; p &lt; 0,001) and decreased with time on waitlist. Regarding quality of life, the score of physical heath (41.8% ± 18.6) and mental health (52.1% ± 25) are below normal. The quality of life tended to decrease over time before LT.\n\nConclusion: The majority of patients waiting for a LT are at risk of malnutrition, display altered muscle function, and a tendency of decreased quality of life. These preliminary data support the need for early nutritional support after LT.\n\nChloe Wong-Mersereau’s bio\n\nChloe Wong-Mersereau recently completed her master’s in social cultural Anthropology at the University of Toronto. Her research interests includes crisis-narratives, aging diaspora communities as well as the sensorial and embodied experience of marginalized peoples navigating medical spaces. During the pandemic, she has worked with the Canadian Red Cross in long term care homes, COVID-testing clinics, homeless shelters, and on the housing crisis project in Montreal. This involvement has led to the development of her interest in understanding people’s lived experience navigating medical institutions through community and arts-based approaches. Now she currently works as a graduate research assistant on the Frictions of Futurity team led by Dr. Suze Berkhout and Dr. Kelly Fritsch. She is leading a discourse analysis of public facing materials in liver transplant and co-organizing a digital storytelling with a team of filmmakers to help liver transplant recipients in exploring, crafting, and sharing their stories.\n\nExpanding Temporalities: Complicating Psychosocial Tools for Liver Transplant Survivors through Critical Discourse Analysis and Digital Storytelling\n\nChloe Wong-Mersereau, Ruo Hao (Selena) Zhang, Fraser Best, Josee Lynch, Mamatha Bhat, Kelly Fritsch, and Suze Berkhout\n\nBackground: Little qualitative research on the experience of liver transplant survivors exists in the literature. What does exist demonstrates the complexity of pre and post-transplant experiences. Transplant programs often attend to these challenges through clinical scales and tools that prepare recipients for the tracking and management of psychosocial challenges. However, the materials used to capture the experience of liver transplant patients shape those very experiences and in turn tell a particular kind of story.\n\nMethods: The Temporalities of Cure in Liver Transplantation (Temporalities) research project examines what is left unexplored in the experience of surviving liver transplantation through a critical discourse analysis of the transplantation manuals, clinical tools, and scales as well as a qualitative interviews and digital storytelling with long-term liver transplant survivors.\n\nResults: The language and structure commonly used in psychosocial assessments and quality of life scales, surveys and questionnaires can be inattentive to the impacts of social axes of power on the healthcare needs of survivors pre-, during and post-liver transplant. These may also contribute to structuring patient narratives in such a way that the temporal complexities of transplantation are not fully represented. Patient manuals similarly construct a linear narrative of the transplant experience that can be juxtaposed with the more layered and complex lived experiences told through people’s digital stories.\n\nDiscussion: Both the clinical scales and patient manuals can affectively flatten the experience of transplantation, whereas the multimodality of interviews and digital stories engages storytellers and viewers/listeners in ways that reveal important aspects of the psychosocial challenges that exist as one’s transplant journey evolves over time. Critical discourse analysis and digital storytelling complicates conventional biomedical ways of knowing liver transplantation by opening space for seriously engaging, understanding, and witnessing the tensions and frictions that can arise when illness experiences have an extended (chronic) temporality.\n\nChristine Wardell’s bio\n\nChristine Wardell is currently a Ph.D. candidate in Dr. Megan Levings’ lab at the BC Children’s Hospital Research Institute in Vancouver, BC. Her work focuses on detecting alloreactive T cells following transplantation and developing regulatory T cell therapies to prevent transplant rejection.\n\nThe trogocytosis assay: A blood-based assay to detect alloreactive immune cells\n\nChristine Wardell, Caroline Lamarche, Vivian Fung, Paul Orban, Tom Blydt-Hansen & Megan Levings\n\nFollowing receipt of a donor kidney, transplant recipients are maintained on immunosuppressive drugs to dampen their donor-reactive immune response, which would otherwise destroy the kidney. However, these drugs also suppress healthy immune responses against pathogens and cancer. Managing physicians continually adjust a patients’ immunosuppressant regimen to minimize infection risk while preserving graft health. These adjustments are made based on results from graft biopsies, which are invasive and infrequent, limiting physicians’ abilities to optimize immunosuppression. Our goal is to create a blood-based assay that detects immune cells that are reactive to donor human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), which are commonly mismatched in transplantation. Our assay is based on the immunological concept of “trogocytosis”, whereby immune cells that detect and bind strongly to target proteins, rip the target protein from the originating cell and re-incorporate it as a part of their own membrane. We hypothesize that donor HLA-reactive immune cells in transplant recipients trogocytose donor HLA, and that the frequency of trogocytosis+ cells negatively correlates with transplant health. The trogocytosis assay co-cultures recipient blood cells with K562s that express donor HLAs fused to a fluorescent protein; donor HLA-reactive immune cells trogocytose the fluorescent donor HLA, making them enumerable by flow cytometry. We have optimized the parameters of this assay based on an HLA-A2-reactive CD8+ T cell clone. HLA trogocytosis correlates well with conventional activation-induced markers (4-1BB, CD25 and CD69). Trogocytosis efficiency is dependent on K562:T cell ratio, plating density, and peaks at 24 hours of co-culture. The assay has an approximate sensitivity of detecting 1 donor-reactive T cell in 500 T cells. We are currently testing the trogocytosis assay on cryopreserved blood from HLA-A2- recipients of HLA-A2+ kidney transplants and correlating outcomes with biopsy results. The trogocytosis assay may serve as a reproducible and reliable way to assess transplant health using recipient blood.\n\nDavid Zorko’s bio\n\nDr. David Zorko is a Pediatric Critical Care Medicine fellow at The Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Canada).

Dr. Zorko’s research interests include long-term morbidities experienced by children and families following critical illness, and crowdsourcing and machine-learning methodologies in the conduct of systematic reviews.\n\nAutoresuscitation After Circulatory Arrest: An Updated Systematic Review\n\nDavid J. Zorko; Jonah Shemie; Laura Hornby; Gurmeet Singh; Shauna Matheson; Ryan Sandarage; K Wollny; L Kongkiattikul; Sonny Dhanani\n\nIntroduction & Objective: In organ donation following death determination by circulatory criteria (DCD), circulation must be determined to have permanently ceased to ensure that death has occurred. Current practice recommends a 5-minute observation period following circulatory arrest to monitor for an unassisted return of circulation, known as autoresuscitation. In light of newer data, the objective of this updated systematic review was to determine if a 5-minute observation time was still adequate in DCD.\n\nMethods: We searched four electronic databases from inception to August 28, 2021 for studies evaluating or describing autoresuscitation events after circulatory arrest. Citation screening and data abstraction were conducted independently and in duplicate. We assessed certainty in evidence using the GRADE framework.\n\nResults: Of 3741 unique citations assessed, 136 full texts were reviewed, and 73 studies met eligibility criteria. Of these, 45 studies were included in our previous reviews, leaving 18 new studies identified in this update consisting of 14 case reports and four observational studies. Most studies evaluated adults (n=15, 83%) and patients with unsuccessful resuscitation of cardiac arrest (n=11, 61%). Overall, timing of autoresuscitation after circulatory arrest ranged from 1 to 20 minutes. Across all studies on autoresuscitation identified by our reviews (n=73), seven observational studies have been conducted. When examining studies of withdrawal of life-sustaining measures with or without DCD (n=6), 1037 adult and 12 pediatric patients have been evaluated with 23 total autoresuscitation events (2.2%; 95% CI 1.4-3.3%). All resumptions occurred within 5 minutes of circulatory arrest and all patients with autoresuscitation died.\n\nConclusion: In the context of controlled DCD, the current evidence demonstrates that 5 minutes is sufficient observation time for death determination by circulatory criteria (moderate certainty). The findings of this systematic review will be incorporated into a Canadian guideline on death determination.\n\nHyunyun Kim’s bio\n\nHyunyun Kim is a Ph.D. student at the Université de Montréal. He completed a Bachelor’s of Science at Yeungnam University and a Master’s of Science degree at Pusan National University in South Korea. After completing his Master’s degree, he pursued his research activity at the medical research center of the Pusan National University Hospital (PNUH) and the Yeungnam University Medical Center (YUMC) as a research assistant. He then joined Dr. Hébert’s lab in 2019. His research interests are focused on the crosstalk and mechanisms of cell death and autophagy in acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI).\n\nAutophagy Inhibition Aggravates Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury-Induced Microvascular Injury\n\nHyunyun Kim, Shanshan Lan, Francis Migneault, Julie Turgeon, Imane Kaci, Annie Karakeussian Rimbaud, Amani Mahroug, Natacha Patey, Mélanie Dieudé, Marie-Josée Hébert\n\nA kidney transplant is a surgery to place a healthy kidney into a person whose kidneys no longer function properly. Donor kidney undergoes poor nutrients and low oxygen during the surgery followed by kidney damage caused when blood supply returns to tissue. This is a common cause of kidney injury in transplants with over 20% of kidney transplanted patients impacted. Thus, it is important to understand how kidney injury develops during a transplant. We discovered that preventing cell death mechanism protects kidney blood vessels after surgery. However, the role of autophagy, which plays a vital role in the survival mechanism of blood vessels remains unclear. Here, we explore the role of autophagy in the response to kidney injury.\n\nWe induced kidney injury in mice to mimic a kidney transplant and used chloroquine, a drug used to prevent survival mechanism. We collected kidneys and blood to measure the activation of survival mechanism and kidney damage. We found that an injured kidney induces survival mechanism, which was blocked by the drug. The drug deteriorated kidney function and damage. We found that regulating the survival pathway might be a potential therapeutic strategy to insure blood vessel protection during a kidney transplant.\n\nImane Kaci’s bio\n\nImane Kaci is a Ph.D. student in the Nephrology, Transplantation and Renal Regeneration Research Unit at the CHUM Research Centre in Montreal. She is also an academic trainee in the Canadian Donation and Transplantation Research Program (CDTRP). She completed an MSc degree in Molecular Pathology and Personalized Medicine at Université de Montréal. She then joined the laboratory of Dr Marie-Josée Hébert to pursue her Ph.D. in Molecular Biology. Her research project focuses on understanding the immune response triggered by apoptotic exosome-like vesicles released by apoptotic endothelial cells, and its impact on microvascular rarefaction, renal fibrosis, and kidney function loss after renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in transplanted and native kidneys.\n\nApoptotic exosome-like vesicles mediate immune response dysregulation and kidney dysfunction following ischemia-reperfusion injury\n\nKidneys clean the blood and dispose of the waste produced by the body’s cells in the urine. They have abundant blood vessels providing them with oxygen and nutrients to function. Kidney function decreases when injuring its smallest blood vessels, especially in old people. We showed that damaging these vessels during transplantation causes kidney graft to fail. We discovered that injured vessels release pieces of cell, called ‘ApoExo’, in the blood. ApoExo activate the immune system to produce antibodies attacking damaged kidneys. We found these antibodies in the blood of kidney recipients with poor graft function. We now study how ApoExo alter immune response causing renal failure and graft rejection. We used mice with injured kidneys mimicking what transplant procedure causes in patients. We collected kidney and blood to measure ApoExo, immune response, and kidney damage. We found that injured kidney releases more ApoExo with age, which increases immune system activation. This induces more antibodies and white blood cells to attack kidneys’ smallest vessels. It then perpetuates ApoExo release and worsens kidney damage and function. Our study gives a new vision of immunological mechanisms causing renal graft impairment. It will help to better preserve donor’s kidney and make it last longer in patients.\n\nMaude Lanoie’s bio\n\nMaude is a graduate student in the Molecular Biology program at the Université de Montréal.

Nicolas Thibodeau, Déborah Beillevaire, Mélanie Dieudé, Marie-Josée Hébert\n\nWhen kidneys lack blood supply, because of renal transplantation, small vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to the kidney become injured. The loss of microscopic blood vessels is a major factor in kidney dysfunction and chronic disease installation. Our group identified small fragments of vascular\n\ncells called apoptotic exosomes that are released in the circulation when kidneys lack oxygen. These fragments can induce an immune response and a\n\nmodification of the blood vessel environment that may affect the transition from an acute kidney injury to the loss of the kidney transplant. We already\n\nshowed that apoptotic exosomes harbor some specific enzymes and RNA molecules known to induce the production of antibodies that can in turn further damage the kidneys. Here, we explore the mechanism by which vascular cells can internalize apoptotic exosomes and shape microscopic blood vessels. To do that, we exposed cells to apoptotic exosomes labeled with fluorescent molecules to track them once internalized. We used inhibitors and genetic techniques to assess the different entryways inside cells. We found that apoptotic exosomes are internalized in blood vessel cells by a non-classical mechanism and that they can promote their entry by activating this same mechanism. We showed that functional RNA molecules can be delivered to cells through apoptotic exosomes and impact the homeostasis of the recipient cells. We also discovered that blocking this entryway prevents the transfer of molecules from apoptotic exosomes to its surrounding and prevents the alteration of the vascular bed around injured vessels. These results open new avenues for preventing apoptotic exosome internalization and preventing the development of kidney dysfunction.\n\nRuixuan (Sunnie) Yang’s bio\n\nExperimental Medicine Graduate Student with over 5 years of renal research experience. Her study centres around the urinary microbiome and its implications on renal transplant patients, with results arguing for the microbiome’s function as early health indicator.\n\nGram-Positive and Gram-Negative Bacterial Surface Constituents Hinder Kidney Cell Viability In Vitro\n\nDirk Lange, Caigan Du, David Harriman\n\nIntroduction and Objectives: There is a paucity of research on the urinary microbiome in transplant patients, although increasing evidence have argued for the influence of bacterial species on patient health. Our goal is to better understand the nature of this interaction from a cellular standpoint, assessing the effects of bacterial components on kidney cell lines. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are gram-negative bacterial surface membrane components that trigger inflammation, while lipoteichoic acid (LTA) act as the functional equivalent in gram-positive bacteria. This project aims to assess the effects of LPS and LTA on kidney cell viability as an initial study of the urinary microbiome and renal allograft health.\n\nMethods: In vitro models using kidney cell lines: Human Mesangial Cells (T-HMC) and Human Kidney Proximal Tubular Cells (HKC-8), were designed to assess the cellular impact of LPS and LTA. Cells were cultured in vitro with LPS from Escherichia coli and LTA from Staphylococcus aureus in varying concentrations for 48 hours. FACS and MTT tests were performed to assess cell apoptosis and metabolic activity, respectively.\n\nResults: Increased LTA and LPS concentration both resulted in a steady decline of kidney cell metabolic rates. Contrastingly, cell apoptosis was independent of changing concentration.Tubular cells showed higher sensitivity to treatment groups when compared to mesangial cells, while combining LPS and LTA appear to have a modulating effect which reduces their overall toxicity.\n\nConclusions: LPS and LTA both act as stressors to kidney cells which may hinder renal allograft health. When combined, they seem to have a modulating effect which decreases their joint toxicity, further supporting the potential protective functions of a diverse microbiome on patient health. Our next steps will be to assess the cytokine inflammatory signals produced from these interactions in addition to analyzing the urinary microbiome of renal transplant recipients in a shotgun sequencing format.\n\nSamrat Ray’s bio\n\nI am a National Board certified GI, HPB and Liver transplant surgeon from New Delhi India. I am currently pursuing my post doc research fellowship in Establishing machine perfusion in pancreas grafts in the lab of Dr Trevor Reichman and Dr Markus Selzner at the Toronto general hospital, Toronto, Canada. My research focusses on establishing normothermic machine perfusion in porcine pancreatic grafts in 3-day survival models and aiming to replicate the same in human pancreas transplantation in future with an aim to expand the donor pool in pancreas transplantation. Alongside, I also work with the machine perfusion models in porcine liver and kidney grafts and also have been participating in the Human Organox liver trial (Metra study) as a part of my curriculum here at the Toronto organ preservation laboratory.\n\nExpanding the donor pool using Normothermic Ex vivo Machine Perfusion model in pancreas transplantation\n\nCatherine Parmentier, Laura Mazilescu, Masataka Kawamura, Yuki Noguchi, Emmanuel Nogueira, Sujani Ganesh, Bhranavi Arulratnam, Sangeetha Kalimuthu, Markus Selzner, Trevor Reichman\n\nIntroduction: Pancreas transplantation has shown promising results in improving quality of life in diabetes mellitus. However, pancreas grafts are the most discarded grafts from procurement and have the lowest utilization rate (9%) of any organ mainly due to vulnerability of the gland to oedema and ischemia reperfusion injury. Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) aims to simulate physiological milieu for the organ, ex-vivo as close to homeostasis as possible. We hereby summarise our experience using NMP in porcine and discarded human pancreas grafts so far.\n\nMethods: Using a S3 heart-lung machine and neonatal cardiopulmonary bypass equipment with a normothermic perfusion solution and dialysing system, our laboratory established 3-day NMP survival model using porcine pancreata, harvested from 15-week-old Yorkshire pigs. Similar perfusion protocol was replicated for discarded human pancreas grafts to establish feasibility.\n\nResults: 12 porcine pancreases were subjected to NMP alone for 3 hrs after minimal cold storage, using the modified perfusate (9% CO2) and dialysate (1.5 gm/L salt) recipe. Based on the favourable results of the same (average peak 3 hr amylase: 5500 U/L), transplantation was carried out in 3-day survival models (n=4). All animals survived till 3 days with acceptable glucose levels (average peak on Day 1= 6.4 mmol/l) and normal glucose tolerance test on Day 3. Among the human grafts, 5 were from brain dead donors and 1 from a cardiac death donor. Glucose levels decreased during the perfusion (average peak: 9mmol/l; 3.9-19.6) and insulin levels increased (average peak: 1688.4 pmol/l; 7-4304 pmol/L). All grafts (human and porcine) were metabolically active during perfusion and histopathology showed minimal tissue injury.\n\nConclusion: Establishing optimal conditions for NMP is a challenge for pancreas grafts. However, meticulous cold dissection, minimum handling of organ while on the machine along with a relatively hyperosmolar composition of the dialysing solution has shown promising results.\n\nWajiha Ghazi’s bio\n\nWajiha Ghazi is a Master’s student working in clinical research at Toronto General Hospital.

Compared to dialysis, kidney transplant provides better clinical outcomes; however, many kidney transplant recipients are also sedentary and have low physical function. In this study, we aim to assess physical function impairment among patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients.\n\nWe assessed physical function impairment using the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), which is a tool that includes item banks for different domains of health-related quality of life including physical function. PROMIS is efficient and precise as it personalizes the assessment and reduces question burden. Participants also completed the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L questionnaire which covers five domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort and depression). We found that kidney transplant recipients had a higher PROMIS physical function scores than patients on dialysis. Moderate-to-severe physical function impairment was prevalent in 70% of patients on dialysis compared to 25% in kidney transplant recipients. Similarly, 66% patients on dialysis reported at least some “problems walking” on the EQ-5D-5L mobility item compared to 38% of kidney transplant recipients\n\nThese results can help improve the interpretation of PROMIS physical function scores and help patients and clinicians to determine the need for exercise intervention. In future research, we will compare performance-based measures with PROMIS and investigate if exercise interventions can reverse physical function impairment in this patient population.\n\nManoela de Paula Ferreira’s bio\n\nDr. de Paula Ferreira is a research coordinator in the department of Physical Therapy at the University of Toronto.

However, the effects of telerehabilitation, adherence and safety of these virtual interventions are still unclear in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. This systematic review aims to 1) describe telerehabilitation’s effects on physical function, frailty, mental health and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in adults SOT recipients and 2) describe the safety and adherence of the telerehabilitation programs.\n\nMethods: PRISMA Guidelines for systematic reviews and the PICOTS framework will be used. Prospero registration: CRD42022337985. All interventional study designs with a telerehabilitation exercise program in a synchronous, asynchronous or hybrid (mix between in-person and virtual) format to adult SOT (heart, liver, kidney, lung or pancreas) recipients, published in English, Portuguese or French will be included. Abstracts and literature reviews will be excluded. As outcomes, physical function (cardiorespiratory endurance, balance, strength, coordination, flexibility, functional mobility, and physical activity); mental health (stress, psychological distress, anxiety and depression); frailty, HRQL, safety and adherence will be described. Searches in six databases (MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL, EMBASE, Web science, SportDISCUS, and Cochrane Library) and grey literature, from inception to July 2022, will be conducted by a librarian. Studies will be combined into two groups: early (&lt; 6 months post-transplantation) and long-term (&gt; 6 months post-transplantation) intervention and a descriptive approach will summarise the effects, safety and adherence to telerehabilitation in each group. The Cochrane tool (rob-2) will be used to assess the methodological quality of the randomized clinical studies and the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies – of Interventions (ROBINS – I) for the non-randomized studies.\n\nResults: The results of this review will assist in understanding the benefits of telerehabilitation for SOT recipients.\n\nConclusion/Clinical significance: This review will also help identify gaps for future investigations to improve the evidence and quality of telerehabilitation for SOT recipients.\n\nAmina Silva’s bio\n\nAmina Silva is a registered nurse and is in the last year of her PhD at Queen’s University. Her clinical background is focused on end-of-life care, kidney transplantation and eye donation processes. Her research program is focused on organ donation processes, end-of-life and survivorship care and simulation-based educational strategies.

To inform changes in the practice guidelines and ensure ethically acceptable procedures, we examined the international literature on the existing processes, outcomes and ethical debates regarding organ donation following MAiD.\n\nMethods: Scoping review using the JBI framework. Published literature was searched on Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, CINAHL via EBSCOhost, Ovid PsycINFO, Web of Science – Science Citation Index and Social Science Citation Index via Clarivate, and Academic Search Complete via EBSCOhost. Gray and unpublished literature included materials from organ donation organizations. Reports were considered if they discussed organ donation following MAiD at home or in any healthcare setting in any country. Reports were screened, and data extracted and analyzed by two independent reviewers.\n\nResults: The searching process yield 1879 reports and 121 were included in this review. Most reports were in English (n=95), from Canada (n=51), and published between 2019-2021 (n=57). Results from this review identified the following major theme areas: the main processes and procedures involved in organ donation after MAiD in the hospital and at home; the main clinical pathways involved in different settings; ethical dilemmas involved in this combined procedure; healthcare professionals’ roles and perceptions; impacts on the organ donation system; transplant outcomes; public perceptions; safety processes and tools in place; educational strategies for healthcare professionals involved; and suggestions for future research to address knowledge gaps.\n\nConclusion: Results from this review can also be used as a rich source of information for countries with organ donation following MAiD and provide important directions for improvements in the current organ donation and transplantation system using MAiD donors.\n\nCindy Wen’s bio\n\nCindy Wen is a third year undergraduate student at Western University, completing an Honours Specialization in Epidemiology and Biostatistics. She is currently the Team Lead of the Chinese Health Equity Project at the Kidney Health Education and Research Group under the supervision of Dr. Istvan Mucsi, a Transplant Nephrologist at Toronto General Hospital in the University Health Network. Her work primarily focuses on examining potential barriers to living donor kidney transplantation among the Chinese Canadian population. More broadly, her research interests lie in examining the social determinants of health and understanding ethnocultural and gender disparities that create inequitable access to care.\n\n“Losing face” as a potential barrier to living donor kidney transplantation for Chinese Canadians in Toronto, Ontario: Preliminary findings from a qualitative analysis\n\nSusan Abbey, Samantha Anthony, Beth Edwards, Kenneth Fung, Jagbir Gill, Jenny Kang, Janet Li, Sarah Pol, Cathy Yang, Istvan Mucsi\n\nBackground: Patients wishing to pursue living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT), need to communicate their need for a living donor. Hesitancy to discuss this need is a known barrier. Chinese Canadians have reduced access to LDKT. We investigated barriers that Chinese Canadians may face when pursuing LDKT.\n\nMethods: Adults on dialysis, kidney donors and recipients, and people with no lived experience with kidney disease who self-identify as Chinese Canadian were recruited through snowball and purposive sampling. Individual interviews were conducted via phone and MS Teams in English, Mandarin, and Cantonese. Topics explored include ethnocultural identity, knowledge regarding kidney disease, and treatment options. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and translated to English when necessary. Data were analyzed via thematic analysis using inductive and deductive coding strategies.\n\nResults: “Losing face” or “Diūliǎn” is emerging as a major theme from our preliminary data analysis (n=12, 6 females, 6 community members, 5 KT recipients, 1 patient on dialysis). “Diūliǎn” is related to social standards regarding social obligation, social integrity, and self-respect. It is rooted in the desire to maintain harmonious relationships and a positive social reputation by avoiding apparent weakness or other causes of embarrassment. Subthemes include: 1) perception of illness as shameful; 2) perception of illness as a personal responsibility; and 3) burden of asking and anticipated need for reciprocity. Participants described that communication about illness may bring shame to the family, so privacy is necessary to avoid rumors, specifically regarding kidney failure. Illness is expected to be managed privately, without burdening others. Finally, asking for large gifts or favors may damage one’s social reputation and require reciprocity.\n\nConclusion: “Losing face” is emerging as a potential barrier for considering LDKT among Chinese Canadians. Next, we will co-develop culturally appropriate strategies with community partners to support communication regarding the treatment of kidney failure.\n\nGopika Punchhi’s bio\n\nGopika Punchhi is a third-year medical student at the Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario. She completed her undergraduate studies at the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD. She is a member of Dr. Mamatha Bhat’s lab at the Multi Organ Transplant Program at University Health Network, Toronto, ON. Her research interests are primarily in patient selection, organ allocation, and post-transplant outcomes for liver transplantation.\n\nDeep Learning to Predict Trajectories and Identify Features Associated with Death and Transplant in Waitlisted NASH Patients\n\nGopika Punchhi, Yingji Sun, Sirisha Rambhatla, Mamatha Bhat\n\nBackground: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis patients waitlisted for liver transplantation (LT) are older, have more comorbidities, and have a high risk of dropout and death on the waitlist. We used data at time of waitlisting to construct a DeepHit machine learning model and conduct a competing risk analysis to predict the probability of death versus transplant in waitlisted NASH candidates.\n\nMethods: We included 17,551 NASH patients listed for LT from 2002-2021 from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (excluding exception indications such as hepatocellular carcinoma). We constructed a DeepHit model with death on the waitlist as the primary event and LT as the competing risk and compared it to regularized CoxPH models predicting death or transplant. We selected the best-performing models and hyperparameters based on the average concordance index (C-index) during validation. Event-specific C-indexes and Brier scores were evaluated at the 25th percentile (1 month), median (5 months), and 12 months on the waitlist using the test set and compared between the models.\n\nResults: The DeepHit model achieved greater C-index scores for the death event at 1, 5, and 12 months of 0.920(⁤±0.001), 0.820(±0.002), and 0.750(±0.002), respectively, and achieved smaller Brier scores for the transplant event of 0.130(±0.003), 0.210(±0.001) and 0.220(±0.005), respectively. In the DeepHit model, features associated with death were initial MELD, hospitalization and ICU status, and poor functional status, while initial MELD, AB blood type, poor functional status, and hemodialysis were associated with transplant.\n\nConclusion: Our DeepHit model outperforms traditional CoxPH models and can be used to predict the trajectory of a NASH patient on the LT waitlist using data at waitlisting. Modifiable predictors of death or transplant can be identified to reduce the risk of waitlist death.\n\nFarnaz Farahbakhsh’s bio\n\nFarnaz Farahbakhsh received her Master’s of Clinical Sciences at the University of Western Ontario. For several years she has been involved as a leader in stem cell donor recruitment in Canada, advocating for patients from diverse ethnic groups who need a blood stem cell transplantation. She is currently leading the Stem Cell Club’s Iranian Donors Save Lives Campaign alongside an engaging team of volunteers to recruit Iranians as potential stem cell donors.\n\nIranian Donors Save Lives Campaign to Engage Iranian Peoples as Stem Cell Donors\n\nFarnaz Farahbakhsh, Brady Park, Gabriele Jagelaviciute, Elena Kum, Michelle Ho, and Dr. Warren Fingrut\n\nBackground: Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a curative therapy for a range of blood diseases, most patients lack a fully matched family donor and require an alternative donor. Patients are more likely to find a matched unrelated donor from within their own ethnic groups. However, Iranians are underrepresented on the worldwide stem cell donor registries (eg. in Canada, making up &lt;0.2% of donors).\n\nMethods: An array of multimedia was developed in collaboration with a team of Iranian-Canadian volunteers and partners to engage the community to donate. Multimedia were reviewed by transplantation experts and members of the Iranian community, then published to stemcellclub.ca/Iranian/.\n\nResults: Multimedia developed included infographics highlighting the racial disparity in access to stem cell donors, WhyWeSwab stories, and videos of patients with Iranian ancestry (mobile.twitter.com/whyweswab; https://youtu.be/zrQH5JVnt2s), testimonials from members of the Iranian community (https://youtu.be/sd9reXoXt4M) and social media influencers (eg.https://www.tiktok.com/@stemcellclub/video/7095913308280130821), physician statements from Iranian Canadians advocating for their communities to register as donors (eg. https://youtu.be/x1eAoRe5C4k, https://www.youtube.com/watch), and Tiktoks featuring Iranian Canadians to target and educate individuals within the Iranian community about the importance of stem cell donation (https://www.tiktok.com/@stemcellclub/video/7096256780807752966, https://www.tiktok.com/@stemcellclub/video/7099958142640934150, https://www.tiktok.com/@stemcellclub/video/7096893023795170565). Multimedia were arranged into a national recruitment campaign, Iranian Donors Save Lives (stemcellclub.ca/Iranian/), and shared by Iranian partners across Canada (eg. Iranian Students Association, Iranian Canadian Foundation).\n\nConclusion: Multimedia were developed in collaboration with Iranian people to support the recruitment of Iranians as potential donors. We are now evaluating the impact of these multimedia on Iranian potential donors’ knowledge and attitudes towards donation.\n\nKatina Zheng’s bio\n\nDr. Katina Zheng, MD received her medical degree from the University of Ottawa and is now a second-year internal medicine resident at the University of Toronto. She has had a longstanding interest in organ donation and transplantation, which was first sparked early on in her medical school training. She continues to actively pursue research under the supervision of Dr. Bhat with a focus on liver transplantation.\n\nLive donor liver transplantation in primary sclerosing cholangitis: an indicator of an organ allocation system not addressing patient need\n\nFernanda Onofrio, Katina Zheng, Cherry Xu, Shiyi Chen, Aliya Gulamhusein, Cynthia Tsien1, Keyur Patel, Nazia Selzner, Leslie Lilly, Gideon Hirschfield, Mamatha Bhat\n\nBackground: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare cholestatic liver disease where transplantation is the only definitive treatment option. Patients are waitlisted for liver transplant (LT) according to the MELD-Na score, which may not accurately reflect the burden of disease in this condition. We sought to describe and analyze the clinical course over time of patients with PSC referred for LT, in a mixed deceased donor/live donor transplant programme.\n\nMethods: A retrospective cohort study from November 2012 to December 2019 including all patients with PSC referred for assessment at the University Health Network Liver Transplant Clinic. Liver symptoms, hepatobiliary malignancy, MELD-Na progression, and death were assessed.\n\nResults: Of 172 PSC patients assessed for transplant, 144 (84%) were listed of which 106/144 (74%) were transplanted. The mean age was 47.6 years and 66% were male. During the follow-up period, 26/144 (18%) were removed from the waitlist due to infection, clinical deterioration, liver-related mortality, or new cancer. At time of listing, 118/144 (81.95%) had a potential Living Donor (pLD), of whom 94 were transplanted: 64 live donor LT (LDLT) and 30 deceased donor LT (DDLT). Overall mortality was 79% lower in patients with a potential living donor (p&lt;0.001). Exception points were granted to 13/172 (7.5%) patients.\n\nConclusions: Overall, the majority of PSC patients assessed for transplant were listed and subsequently transplanted. Only a minority of patients received exception points, which reflects the difficulty in fulfilling criteria. Waitlist mortality was 11.8% which is lower than other indications for LT. The majority of PSC transplanted patients underwent LDLT; this may be indirect evidence of patients and clinicians recognising that the current MELD-Na allocation system does not accurately reflect their degree of illness/clinical need. Evaluation of approaches to managing deceased donor allocation for patients with PSC is needed to make this more equitable.\n\nKhairunnadiya (Nadia) Prayitno’s bio\n\nNadia Prayitno holds a doctoral degree for her work on the role of roX RNA in Dosage Compensation during Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis, where she utilized a variety of molecular and cellular"
