He represented Yamaska in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1871 to 1874 and in the House of Commons of Canada as a Conservative member from 1874 to 1879.\n\nHe was born in Saint-François-du-Lac, Canada East in 1844, the son of Ignace Gill and studied at the Collège de Nicolet and the Université Laval. He articled in law with Ulric-Joseph Tessier, was admitted to the bar in 1867 and set up practice at Sorel. In 1870, he married Marie-Rosalie-Delphine, the daughter of Louis-Adélard Senécal. In 1871, he was elected to the provincial assembly. He resigned in 1874 to run for a seat in the House of Commons. He resigned in 1879 when he was named as a judge to the Quebec Superior Court in Richelieu district; in 1886, he was named to Montreal district. He was also a director of the Montreal, Portland and Boston Railway.\n\nHe died in Montreal in 1901."
