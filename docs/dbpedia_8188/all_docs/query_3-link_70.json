The Student Life Department includes all clubs and activities, the building and operations, and the Dean’s Office. Our primary purpose is to encourage students to get involved and make positive, healthy choices while in high school. We organize recognition assemblies, dances, and service projects for the entire student body. We support our students by offering activities that promote the core values of service, leadership, and community as they strive for academic excellence. Each day we work to create a safe and secure environment that allows all students to reach their potential. We believe that students “don’t care how much we know, until they know how much we care”. Student Life cares!\n\nI started teaching at St. Charles High School in 1993. I was a Business Education teacher for nineteen years and an Instructional Support Coach for four years. I was part of the Upstate 8 as a high school student - a Lake Park Lancer. I have a Bachelors of Science degree in Organizational Management from Elmhurst College and a Masters of Arts in Secondary Education from Roosevelt University. I completed my Administrator Certificate/Type 75 coursework at Aurora University. I am looking forward to another year as Assistant Principal for Student Life at St. Charles East High. It’s a special place to work! I value feedback and welcome new ideas. I can’t wait to learn and work with you and your son/daughter this year!\n\nThanks for taking the time to read about me and the Student Life Department. Remember, it’s always a great day to be a Saint!\n\nContact Lisa Dandre\n\nAssistant Principal - Matt Gill\n\nEducation & Experience: I earned my Bachelor of Science in Secondary Education from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1995 and my Master of Arts in Educational Administration from Governors State University in 2003.

While teaching, I worked on completing my Master’s Degree in Educational Administration from Northern Illinois University. After 7 years of teaching, I was given the opportunity to become the Assistant Principal/Dean of Students at Plano High School in Plano, IL before coming to St. Charles East as a Dean of Students. My goal is to help all students achieve their fullest potential, academically and socially, while navigating their high school careers.\n\nHaving been at St. Charles East since 2003, I have seen many changes in the culture and climate of our staff and students but the one thing that has never changed is the focus on our students’ success.

In my role, I act as a supportive individual for student growth and learning. I have one intention: to do what is best for students. Together, we do better. Students encounter a gamut of educational experiences. Sometimes those experiences require a team for support, and we must be open to communication and collaboration to achieve success. Therefore, I look forward to the work we -students, parents, faculty, and staff -will accomplish.\n\nI began my educational career in 2004. I earned my Bachelor of Arts degree in English with a minor in Spanish from Eastern Illinois University. I spent the majority of my career in several suburban high schools: Bolingbrook, Glenbard East, and West Chicago. After eighteen years in the classroom, I returned to DePaul to work on a second Master’s degree in Educational Leadership & Administration. As an administrator, before St. Charles East, I served as Assistant Principal at Genoa-Kingston High School. I hope to finish my Ph.D. in Curriculum Studies next year.\n\nI look forward to a great year ahead. Please contact me so that I can better support your student.\n\nContact Nicole Osborne"
