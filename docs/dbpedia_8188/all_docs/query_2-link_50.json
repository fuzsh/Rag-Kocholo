        "text": "Bob Gill, the irreverent graphic designer who helped transform his profession from its decorative roots into a business of ideas, died on Nov. 9 in Brooklyn. He was 90.\n\nThe death, at a hospice facility, was confirmed by his wife, Sara Fishko.\n\nMr. Gill once played piano with the drummer Charlie Watts (and urged him to join an unknown band called the Rolling Stones); co-created “Beatlemania,” the late-1970s Broadway pop extravaganza; wrote and illustrated a dozen or so children’s books; and redesigned High Times magazine, the once-trendy chronicle of dope culture. But these achievements were side gigs.\n\nHis métier, and religion, was graphic design, and along with peers like George Lois — the legendary art director of Esquire who once dropped an image of Andy Warhol in a can of soup for his magazine’s cover — Mr. Gill was part of a revolution in his profession. He felt passionately that good design was about communicating a message, not foisting a fashionable aesthetic on a client.\n\nFor a long time, much of the history of art in the service of commerce was about decoration, “about making things look fancy,” said Michael Bierut, a partner at Pentagram, the global design firm that grew out of a boutique London ad agency founded in part by Mr. Gill."
