They found that the sample is rich in carbon, nitrogen and organic compounds – essential components for life as we know it.\n\n\"Finally having the opportunity to delve into the OSIRIS-REx sample from Bennu after all these years is incredibly exciting,\" said Dante Lauretta, principal investigator for OSIRIS-REx and Regents Professor of planetary sciences in the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. \"This breakthrough not only answers longstanding questions about the early solar system but also opens new avenues of inquiry into the formation of Earth as a habitable planet.

(2024, May 08). Consciousness came before life. IAI News. /articles/life-and-consciousness-what-are-they-auid-2836\n\nMost scientists and philosophers believe that life came before consciousness. Life appeared on Earth about 3.8 billion years ago; consciousness and feelings, it’s said, evolved later due to complex biological information processing, perhaps only recently in brains with language and tool-making abilities. In fact, though, there’s good reason to think that consciousness preceded life, and was central to making life and evolution possible.

In contrast, Roger Penrose's longtime collaborator, Stuart Hameroff, puts forward the controversial case that consciousness precedes life and that we have evidence for this from a recent NASA experiment.\n\n\"Hameroff's theories are getting support from unlikely places.\" ‑ Discover Magazine\n\nTSC Conference 2024\n\nThe Science of Consciousness - Tucson 30th\n\nPlenary & Workshop Videos\n\nDocument\n\n(This pdf was the printed version of the program)\n\nThere were several changes made late in the concurrent program.

In medical school in the early 1970s, Hameroff became interested in consciousness, and in protein structures called microtubules inside brain neurons which he came to believe processed information supporting consciousness. In the mid- 1990s he teamed with Sir Roger Penrose to develop the controversial ‘Orch OR’ theory in which consciousness derives from “orchestrated” (“Orch”) microtubule quantum vibrations linked to processes in spacetime geometry, the fine scale structure of the universe, leading to “Penrose objective reduction” (“OR”, hence “Orch OR”). And he has further proposed the ‘microtubule quantum vibration’ theory of anesthetic action. Hameroff organizes the well-known conference series ‘The Science of Consciousness’, has written or edited 5 books and over a hundred scientific articles, and appeared in films and various TV shows about consciousness. With University of Arizona colleagues Jay Sanguinetti, John JB Allen and Shinzen Young, Hameroff is developing transcranial ultrasound (‘TUS’) for treatment of mental and cognitive dysfunction (TUS may resonate endogenous megahertz vibrations in brain microtubules). Penrose- Hameroff Orch OR is one of a group of major theories of consciousness in the Templeton World Charity Foundation project ‘Accelerating Research on Consciousness’ and is currently being tested experimentally.

Christof received his baccalaureate from the Lycée Descartes in Rabat, Morocco, his B.S. and M.S. in physics from the University of Tübingen in Germany and his Ph.D. from the Max-Planck Institute for biological Cybernetics in 1982. Subsequently, he spent four years as a postdoctoral fellow in the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and the Brain and Cognitive Sciences Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. From 1987 until 2013, Koch was a professor at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, from his initial appointment as Assistant Professor, Division of Biology and Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences in 1986, to his final position as Lois and Victor Troendle Professor of Cognitive & Behavioral Biology. Christof joined the Allen Institute for Brain Science as Chief Scientific Officer in 2011 and became President in 2015. Christof’s passion are neurons – the atoms of perception, memory, behavior and consciousness – their diverse shapes, electrical behaviors, and their computational function within the mammalian brain, in particular in neocortex. The Allen Institute for Brain Science is engaged in a major effort to identify all the different types of neurons in the brains of mice and humans – the cell census effort. Christof discovered that in vivo cortical neurons do not integrate over large number of small inputs given their spiking variability, how neurons can multiply, the relationship between intra- and extra-cellular potential, and how this gives rise to the local field potential and the large-scale current sinks and sources and how weak extracellular fields can entrain spiking activity via ephaptic effects. He postulated the attentional saliency map hypothesis for biological and computer vision according to which one or more topographic organized spatial maps summarize bottom-up salient information in the visual system, he co-discovered, with Itzhak Fried, an highlevel, invariant and abstract single neuron representation of familiar individuals and objects in the human medial temporal lobe (the so-called “Jennifer Aniston” or concept neurons) and developed the ‘continuous flashed suppression’ masking technique. In collaboration with Francis Crick, he initiated the modern search for the neuronal correlates of consciousness, a systematic experimental program to identify the minimal bio-physical mechanisms jointly sufficient for any one specific conscious percept. In collaboration with Giulio Tononi, he codeveloped the Integrated Information Theory of consciousness.

Her work focuses on the edge of experience: on voices, visions, the world of the supernatural and the world of psychosis. She has done ethnography on the streets of Chicago with homeless and psychotic women, and worked with people who hear voices in Chennai, Accra and the South Bay. She has also done fieldwork with evangelical Christians who seek to hear God speak back, with Zoroastrians who set out to create a more mystical faith, and with people who practice magic. She uses a combination of ethnographic and experimental methods to understand the way people feel their thoughts and imagine their minds in different social settings, and what follows. At the heart of the work is the question of how things come to feel real to people. She was named to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003, received a John Guggenheim Fellowship award in 2007 and elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2022. When God Talks Back was named a NYT Notable Book of the Year and a Kirkus Reviews Best Book of the Year. It was awarded the $100,000 Grawemeyer Prize for Religion by the University of Louisville.

Through empirical music research, I aim to better understand the dynamical coordination processes observed in bodily activation (including the brain) of humans engaged in music performance and experience. I consider the study of coordination processes as a gateway towards a better understanding of the powerful (inter)subjective experiences that music can evoke. In my research, I explore emerging technologies of extended reality (XR) as innovative methodological tools, both on the level of stimuli creation (simulation of real-life immersive environments, or the creation of “impossible” stimuli), as well as on the level of quantitative measurement of behaviour and (neuro)physiological responses. Further, this research is connected in collaborative artistic-creative research in which we aim to explore the possibilities of XR technologies to innovate the cultural-creative sector with new forms of musical interaction and expression.

Muotri, a professor in the Departments of Pediatrics and Cellular & Molecular Medicine at the University of California, San Diego, is focusing his research on solving one of life's greatest mysteries: What is it that makes us uniquely human? Research tells us that one of the most influential characteristics of modern humans is our sophisticated brains, and all of the abilities that its complexity grants us. Our unique social brains are one of the key distinguishing factors between humans and other primates. We are even very different from our closest relatives, the Neanderthals, whose brains were limited in their ability to create technology, art, imagination and overall culture. Dr. Muotri is studying the brain from an evolutionary and developmental perspective, differentiating stem cells to recreate \"brain organoids\" in the controlled setting of a lab.

He also served a 1-year appointment at University of Texas, became a Reader then full Professor at Birkbeck College, London, and Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics, Oxford University (during which he served several ½-year periods as Mathematics Professor at Rice University, Houston, Texas). He is now Emeritus Rouse Ball Professor, Fellow, Wadham College, Oxford (now Emeritus Fellow). He has received many awards and honorary degrees, including knighthood, Fellow of the Royal Society and of the US National Academy of Sciences, the De Morgan Medal of London Mathematical Society, the Copley Medal of the Royal Society, the Wolf Prize in mathematics (shared with Stephen Hawking), the Pomeranchuk Prize (Moscow), and one half of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics, the other half shared by Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez. He has designed many non-periodic tiling patterns including a large paving at entrance of Andrew Wiles Mathematics Building, Oxford, and the Transbay Center, San Francisco, California. Sir Roger is widely acclaimed for fundamental advances in understanding the universe. His 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics was bestowed for showing that black holes are robust predictions of Einstein’s theory of general relativity. Roger has also proposed a solution to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics (‘objective reduction’, ‘OR’), which he suggests is also the origin of consciousness, leading to a theory of brain function (‘orchestrated objective reduction’, ‘Orch OR’). And Roger’s concept of Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (‘CCC’) posits a serial, eternal universe, with the Big Bang preceded by a previous aeon which had its own Big Bang, that aeon preceded by another and so on.

Principal Investigator (Plen 4)\n\nGINA POE\n\nGina R. Poe is an American neuroscientist specializing in the study of sleep and its effect on memory and learning. Her findings have shown that the absence of noradrenaline and low levels of serotonin during sleep spindles allow the brain to form new memories during REM, as well as restructure old memory circuits to allow for more learning during later waking periods. She currently works as a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Gina Poe has been working since 1995 on the mechanisms through which sleep serves memory consolidation and restructuring. Dr. Poe is a southern California native who graduated from Stanford University then worked for two post-baccalaureate years at the VA researching Air Force Test Pilots’ brainwave signatures under high-G maneuvers. She then earned her PhD in Basic Sleep in the Neuroscience Interdepartmental Program at UCLA under the guidance of Ronald Harper then moved to the University of Arizona for her postdoctoral studies with Carol Barnes and Bruce McNaughtons looking at graceful degradation of hippocampal function in aged rats as well as hippocampal coding in a 3-D maze navigated in the 1998 space shuttle mission. She brought these multiunit teachings to answer a burning question of whether REM sleep were for remembering or forgetting and found that activity of neurons during REM sleep is consistent both with the consolidation of novel memories and the elimination of already consolidated memories from the hippocampus, readying the associative memory network for new learning the next day. Moving first to Washington State University then to the University of Michigan before joining UCLA in 2016. Research Interests: The Poe lab investigates the mechanisms by which sleep traits serve learning and memory consolidation. Memories are encoded by the pattern of synaptic connections between neurons. We employ tetrode recording and optogenetic techniques in learning animals to see how neural patterns underlying learning are reactivated during sleep, and how activity during sleep influences the neural memory code.

(Full bio under \"Plenary\")\n\nThis symposium will offer an introduction to Integrated Information Theory (IIT), its foundations, its empirical validations, and its implications. The first part will introduce IIT’s endeavor to study subjective experience objectively, highlighting its differences with respect to other approaches, and providing an overview of IIT 4.0’s core concepts and formalism. Then, we will illustrate how to apply this formalism to account for the qualitative content of experience such as the extendedness of visual space and the experience of the flow of time. We will then discuss IIT’s empirical predictions, testing, and validation in experimental settings. We will end by examining the implications of IIT for the dissociation between consciousness and artificial intelligence.\n\nGIULIO TONONI\n\nGiulio Tononi is a neuroscientist and psychiatrist based at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he holds chairs in sleep medicine and consciousness science. His scientific work on consciousness has centered on the development of the Integrated Information Theory, a comprehensive theory of what consciousness is, its neural substrate, what determines its quantity and quality, and how it can be measured. The theory accounts for why certain brain areas are critical for consciousness and has led to the development of practical measures for assessing the quantity of consciousness in both healthy humans and unresponsive patients. His work on sleep has led to the Synaptic Homeostasis Hypothesis, a comprehensive theory of the core function of sleep that is supported by a large amount of empirical evidence.\n\nMELANIE BOLY\n\nMelanie Boly is a neurologist and neuroscientist. She has worked for more than twenty years in the field of altered states of consciousness such as vegetative state, sleep and anesthesia, under the mentorship of Pr.

The lessons provide insight about how moving ourselves is the core of being conscious; offering unexpected discoveries of what you can do with your attention and movement capabilities. Contrary to most exercise systems Feldenkrais® lessons are opportunities to go slow, be easy with yourself and nuture your curiosity. You will find that most of your beliefs about your body, fitness and coordination seriously underestimate your potential for healthy movement. Furthermore, improving your subjective experience of moving enhances your consciousness of yourself, and surprisingly, shifts your engagement with other people.\n\nDOUGLAS TATARYN\n\nFinding and Clearing the Emotional Roots of your Suffering\n\nWed 4/24, Thur 4/25, Fri 4/26, Sat - 4/27 - 7:15 - 8:15 am (Santa Rita)\n\nNot sleeping well?

They have explored the whole spectrum of approaches from philosophy of mind and cognitive science, to neurobiology, pharmacology, and molecular dynamics, phenomenological accounts, and physics. The aim is tolay a sound scientific foundation for future research\n\nThe Science of Consciousness (TSC) conferences are the pre-eminent world gatherings on all approaches to the profound and fundamental question of how the brain produces conscious experience, a question which addresses who we are, the nature of reality and our place in the universe. TSC conferences have been held in Tucson since 1994, (every 2 years) and are recognized around the world. TSC International held its first conference in 1995 and continues in alternate years.\n\nVideos TSC and CCS Programs-Archive\n\nYouTube 1 The Science of Consciousness Conferences & Programs: 2010-2023\n\nChannel 2: UofA Consciousnessadditional 2012\n\nStuart Hameroff MD, Anesth CCS Director - COM-UA website\n\nAbi Behar Montefiore - asst dir, sr. program mgr\n\n520-247-5785 text/messages center@arizona.edu\n\nSUPPORT THE CENTER\n\nJOIN OUR E-LIST FOR CONFERENCE UPDATES\n\nTSC 2018\n\nJune 7th, 2023\n\n15:00 - University of Oxford\n\nTalk with Stuart Hameroff MD\n\nMathematical Institute, Univ of Oxford Room L3 - Woodstock Rd.
