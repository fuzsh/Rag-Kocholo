Charles Ignace AdÃ©lard Gill (21 October 1871 â 16 October 1918) was a Canadian artist, specialising in poetry and painting. He also worked under the alternate names Clairon and LÃ©on Duval.

He was born at Sorel, Quebec to Charles-Ignace Gill and Marie-Rosalie Delphire SÃ©nÃ©cal. After studies at CollÃ¨ge Sainte-Marie de MontrÃ©al, CollÃ¨ge de Nicolet and CollÃ¨ge Saint-Laurent, he worked in Paris under Jean-LÃ©on GÃ©rÃ´me at the Ãcole des Beaux-Arts. After returning to Montreal, he established his own studio in 1894.

He also published poetry in the anthology Les soirÃ©es du ChÃ¢teau de Ramesay (1900). After his death a volume of his poetry was published under the title Le Cap EternitÃ©, poÃ¨me suivi des Ã©toiles filantes (1919).

Gill had one son, Roger-Charles, with his wife Georgine BÃ©langer (aka GaÃ«tane de Montreuil, m. 12 May 1902). He died at Montreal from the 1918 flu pandemic just short of his 47th birthday.
