        "text": "International pop star and soccer legend wander the streets of Buenos Aires. Queue the music and vintage video footage.\n\nIntroducing the singer Manu Chao and coach of the Argentina national team, Diego Maradona in “La Vida Tombola,” a hit single off Chao’s Latin Grammy-winning album “La Radiolina.”\n\nThe song is also featured in the film “Maradona.” Here is the video for “La Vida Tombola,” which translates loosely to “Life Is a Lottery.”\n\nThe film was directed by Emir Kusturica, the award-winning Serbian filmmaker, and was a selection at the Cannes International Film Festival last May. It has been released in several countries in Europe.\n\nChao, 47, who was born in France to parents from Galicia and the Basque region in Spain, has long been a fan of Maradona. In 1994, he included the song “Santa Maradona” on his “Casa Babylon” album, Chao’s last effort with his band Mano Negra.\n\nGoal, The New York Times soccer blog, will report on news and features from the world of soccer and around the Web. Times editors and reporters will follow international tournaments and provide analysis of games. There will be interviews with players, coaches and notable soccer fans, as well as a weekly blog column by Red Bulls forward Jozy Altidore. Readers can discuss Major League Soccer, foreign leagues and other issues with fellow soccer fans."
