        "text": "Maradona by Kusturica, the maverick film director's long awaited documentary on the legendary enfant terrible of world football finally arrived in the UK last week. Screened a year ago in Cannes to mixed reviews, the word for audiences in the UK had been that there was little chance of the film coming soon to a cinema near us.\n\nHowever, last Saturday, The Barbican provided Londoners with their single screening and followed it with a talk from the Palme d'Or-winning director Emir Kusturica himself.\n\nKusturica's very personal take on Maradona purports to show three aspects of the man as never before: the footballer, the political beast and the drug addict. In it, he splices footage of his own films with scenes shot during the three years in which he patiently waited for more access to the star. \"I wanted to stress the similarities between both worlds,\" he said after the screening in London, pointing out the similarities between meal-times with Maradona's family and his own fictional reconstructions of poverty-stricken life in the Balkans.\n\nThe documentary shows Maradona returning to what was once his home in Villa Fiorito, the deprived neighbourhood in the outskirts of Buenos Aires where he grew up, and sitting at the table which dominates the small front room. He speaks movingly about how, in spite of his poverty, his father always managed to get food on that table for his eight children. \"And when there wasn't very much,\" a hugely over-weight Maradona tells the camera, \"Mum would feign a stomach upset so there would be more for us\".\n\nMaradona has returned to Fiorito for the first time in 15 years and mutters as he walks in to his own house: \"This is home.\" Kusturica then reflects in a voice-over – the soundtrack to the whole film – that perhaps \"not going back has allowed Maradona to retain an idealised image of poverty. Otherwise, how do you ever regret having left this beautiful field?\" A piercing observation, as the cameras span acres and acres of rubbish mountains filmed while the crew drive along the motorways of Buenos Aires.\n\nDuring the making of the film Maradona nearly dies and survives thanks to the stomach-stapling surgery which means he will spend the rest of his life eating mash. He speaks candidly about \"when I died\" and regurgitates his odyssey with drugs in a manner which has become all too familiar. Kusturica seems to think the interviews with Maradona are revealing and says \"he opened up to me like never before\". But Maradona has always had a knack for telling it like it is, and in fact, there are probably more canned reels of him discussing his addictions than there is footage of his goals.\n\nIn fact, the film's strong points are not the obvious interviews nor the simplistic parallels between both goals against England in 1986 and the Falklands/Malvinas conflict (edited with images of a bizarre animated Thatcher/Bush hybrid, soundtracked by the Sex Pistols). True, Maradona does tell Kusturica he was playing for the Argentinian dead, \"sent to die by the very Argentinians themselves, mind you,\" he grants pointing a stern finger. Meanwhile the anti-Bush narrative is relevant given that filming takes place while Maradona, as one of the movement's leaders, boards the protest train which gathers Evo Morales and Hugo Chávez in a surreal rally to counteract the former US president's own South American economic summit in Mar del Plata in 2005.\n\n\"I have been offered the job of politician\" says Maradona to Kusturica. We should not ask \"By whom?\" but rather, I think, be grateful he turned it down. Some of Maradona's remarks – \"Power isn't throwing a bomb which can kill thousands in one explosion\" – are little gems. But the political Maradona, I fear, is full of contradiction and equating his football to anti-imperialist messages diminishes the complexity of the man himself.\n\nThe strength of his game was its art, not its politics, and really the scene worth the entrance fee alone is the one in which Kusturica takes Maradona back to Belgrade's Red Star stadium. Maradona relives his 1982 goal for Barcelona: \"Here I enganchó [hook],\" he says concisely as he walks the turf of the empty stadium, in a scene so full of drama, nostalgia and precision the hairs on the back of any football lover's neck will stand to attention.\n\nKusturica clearly grasps the price of Maradona's fame in a scene shot inside a vehicle trying to drive the footballer's family through the streets of a demented Naples, crowds banging and rocking the car, albeit it with adoration. The asphyxia is palpable.\n\n\"I have seen cows and horses trying to shake mosquitoes off their back\" Kusturica said, \"they are desperate and you know they cannot get rid of them\". It's unclear if Kusturica equates Maradona to a cow or a horse, but his visible idolisation of the player suggests he has more sympathy than that. Indeed, the director was a player himself, his career cut short by injury we are told, so it's surprising that in the post-film interview he bought into the 'footballers are stupid' cliché. \"If you find a footballer who has something to say please email me\" he instructed the auditorium.\n\nDuring that interview, sadly, much of this intellectual snobbery came to light. It was perhaps less surprising when it came from the audience and journalist interviewing the film-maker but it was disappointing when it came from Kusturica himself. Remarks such as \"what can you possibly talk to a footballer about\" and \"footballers don't have much to say\" peppered the discussion. It's a pity footballers aren't always treated as cultural icons when they deserve to be.\n\n\"Aren't you worried the football subject will limit its appeal?\" asked the interviewer, encapsulating a million more clichés, all of them mistaken.\n\nThe following day, the calendar for Londoners seeking live culture offered Arsenal v Chelsea at the Emirates and 60,000 attended, which at 40 quid a pop for the cheapest tickets suggests what is of limited appeal these days is mid-afternoon screenings of art-house cinema.\n\nShame because at a fraction of the price of an actual live match, the film did entertain, and offered more than 100 goals scored by the genius who remains unsurpassed in his field - both artistically and culturally."
