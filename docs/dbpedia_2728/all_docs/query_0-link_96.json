        "text": "I met a lady from New York who doesn't drink Coke. She also cares for the refugees from Palestine, not only does she care, but when she has free time, she also helps them. At first I found it funny that she doesn't drink Coke because her small protest seemed insignificant compared to the world's biggest brand. I thought it was a kind of personal protest, the satisfaction of my ideas. However, if I've given her protest some thought, then that protest makes sense, and it's probably gaining importance as I write this text, and it will gain even more as people read it.\n\nI repented because I thought that it was a question of pomodarstvo. Perhaps the diary has managed to handicap my reasoning even though I avoid it. The daily is so cleverly designed that the news from our dear country seems too serious, while when the announcer says \"and now the world\" we turn off our brains and start thinking about how transparent the announcer's blouse is, who she loved to get that position, and Syria, Iraq , and even Serbia seem too distant and uninteresting. NIMBY (\"It's not in my backyard\") syndrome.\n\nBand Manu Čao will hold a concert in Belgrade on September 14. They were supposed to perform in the Pionir hall, but Manu Čao refused to play in that hall. They state that they do not want to hold a concert in a place where there are advertisements of large corporations and banks, which cannot be removed and covered, therefore their concert was moved to the Sports Hall. They once again proved that they are not only musicians, but also activists, fighters for human rights and true anti-globalists. Their move will reverberate more than expected.\n\nIn 2008, from the comfortable seats of the Grand Théâtre Lumière, I had the opportunity to watch the premiere of the film Maradona by Kusturica. Although that film did not compete, it generated a lot of attention. Before the movie, Maradona and Kusturica played \"head\" on the stage, that is, they threw football at each other and they were good at it. The applause was followed by chants of \"Diego, Diego\"! The film provoked everyone, and during the film, people left the screening, especially after the part when the animated part starts where Maradona kicks the ball instead of the head of George Bush and the Queen of England. A few seats away from me sat an Argentinian who cried during the entire screening of the film, moved by the story of the goal that Maradona scored with his golden hand in the match against the English and thus \"returned\" them for the Falkland Islands. One of the most interesting details is the meeting between Maradona and Fidel who, looking at Maradona's tattoos of Che and other revolutionaries in his style, says that he should wear those characters because if it weren't for them, Argentina would be just another star on the American flag.\n\nThe film ends with the film crew giving Maradona a surprise \"around the corner\". Leaning one foot against the wall, Manu Chao plays the song \"La Vida Tombola\" dedicated to Maradona. He approaches them and listens to the song. There is a cross around his neck and he wears dark sunglasses. As the song draws to a close, he bites his lip more and scrunches up his face. He is overcome by emotions at the end, so even though nothing can be seen through the glasses, you can still see that he is crying. It is felt. There was nothing pathetic, because great legends cry sincerely and do not hide it.\n\nAfter the film, applause broke out, the volume of which I will always be able to hear again because I kept it inside me. What surprised me a lot were the congratulations we received after the film Predrag Stojić from Belgrade and I. We were part of the J.Production team and as laureates of the French Cultural Center competition, we represented francophone countries at the 61st Cannes Festival, he represented Serbia and I represented Montenegro. The fact that after pronouncing our countries they also introduced us as Ex Yugoslavia made the others congratulate us after the film because Kusturica is our compatriot. A Moroccan, a Tunisian and a Canadian stood first in line and they were great admirers of the work of Emir Kusturica whose appearance in Cannes caused enormous respect because the vast majority viewed him not only as a director, but as one of the world's greatest fighters against imperialism. And they were not the only ones who thought that way, because little by little and covertly, fearing for their functions and positions, the leading people of the festival also shared their opinion. People even went to such an extent to glorify his personality that even his appearance, which is far from polished, was considered a rebellion. Manu Čao, Maradona and Kusturica were the main topic of the Cannes Festival for days.\n\nWhen I returned to Montenegro, the story about the lawsuit that Kusturica filed against Andrej Nikolaidis because of the text \"The Devil's Apprentice\" was still current. Even in our country, no distinction was made between the character and the act, only that the attitude towards the character is completely different from the one that prevails outside the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Either great artists are really contradictory by some unwritten rule, or we don't recognize anyone who rises above the average, and we don't forgive success. Many claim that Kusturica offered the West a distorted image of the Balkans, while perhaps in the background there is resentment because he aired our dirty laundry.\n\nIf one were to try to determine who to trust, one would find himself in an endless search. There is no final truth or formula, while it is important that a person feeds on something, even if it is crumbs, and that he fights. In Zagreb, Srećko Horvat organizes forums and the Subversive film festival, in Belgrade and Sarajevo at least writing and translating, and Podgorica sleeps. A flash occurs that almost no one notices. Last year, the great Damir Avdić performed under the bridge, and while tearing up with his punk poetry and performance, he sent messages of rebellion and anarchy to the few, while behind him were billboards with big sponsors, those to whom he directed his verses.\n\nWhat remains for our citizens, those who feel this way, who have managed to break away from the return of tribalism, are small protests that lead to small protests. That kind of inner subversion will lead to satisfaction. Blowing the horn to drivers as a form of warning that they are breaking traffic rules is taken as one of the first steps, and it can also be crossing the street at a red light and not wearing a seat belt, although this belongs to some form of ironic protest. It seems that we will always remain torn between us and the world. We survive in that in-between space.\n\nI understand that dissatisfaction and personal protest can also be the fact that my friend still insists that we are \"near the Hotel\", even though the modern builders of Podgorica have done their best to leave only ruins of it."
