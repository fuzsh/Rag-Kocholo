Taxonomies are useful, even necessary for the purpose of\n\nclassification, but they have to be based on objective observation\n\nand identification. Biette's is mostly based on personal tastes and\n\npreferences and as such has no \"scientific\" merit or practical use.\n\nFilmmakers will be shifted from one category to another according to\n\neach person's tastes and values, as clearly shown by Jess's and Joe's\n\nobjections in response to Bill this morning. So battles will rage\n\nanew, needlessly. \"O, that way madness lies; let me shun that.\"\n\nJPC\n\n6502\n\nFrom:\n\nDate: Sun Jan 11, 2004 11:53am\n\nSubject: Testable Hypothesis\n\nBiette's definition of a cineaste contains formal difficulties.\n\nIf a critic says, \"Rossellini is a cineaste\" or \"De Sica is not a cineaste\",\n\nit is not going to be easy for someone else to test whether these assertions\n\nare true or false. Is there an easy way for an outside observer to determine if\n\nRossellini has \"an individual stance with respect to the world and with\n\nrespect to cinema\" - a way that all critics from David Bordwell to Peter Wollen\n\nwill agree is obviously correct? Or that De Sica doe NOT have such a stance?\n\nThis does not mean that Biette's idea of a cineaste has no value. But it\n\nsounds like something that is 1) very personal for each critic; and 2) something\n\nthat can be arrived at after a long, intensive study of a filmmaker.\n\nForgive me. I was trained in formal logic and theory of science. I\n\nautomatically scan everything I read to see if it is a \"Testable Hypothesis\": something\n\nwhose truth or falsity can be determined objectively by outside observers.\n\nIt's an unbreakable habit by this point.\n\nOne can see a lot of untestable hypotheses floating through film critcicism.\n\nFor example, in Olivier Assayas' interview in Cinemascope, he makes a\n\nstatement like (this is a paraphrase from memory) \"big commercial films are in touch\n\nwith important ideas of our society's unconscious, in the way that small\n\nindependant films usually are not\". He means that blockbuster films like \"The\n\nMatrix\" connect up with hidden social issues and technological innovations in a way\n\nthat art films like \"Far From Heaven\" and \"Before Night Falls\" allegedly do\n\nnot. My first thought on reading this is: Assayas might be right or he might be\n\nwrong, but how the heck can I test this? I can't look into society's\n\nunconscious mind. How can one know if \"The Matrix\" or \"Before Night Falls\" is linked to\n\nit meaningfully or not?\n\n(By the way, I loved \"Far From Heaven\" and \"Before Night Falls\", and did not\n\nlike \"The Matrix\", but that is a side issue.)\n\nBy contrast, it is much easier to think about testable hypotheses. A good\n\nexample of a testable hypothesis, is Fred Camper's assertion on his web site that\n\n\"Brakhage's 'Anticipation of the Night' is the first film to show his mature\n\npersonal style\" (once again, I'm paraphrasing from memory). I can test this!\n\nMemories of seeing 'Anticipation of the Night' confirm that it is full of the\n\ntrademark bobbing and weaving that Brakhage did to express the act of seeing.\n\nAnd that it deals with a wide range of visual experiences, in and out of focus,\n\nlight effects, sudden bursts of movement. A memory search also suggests that\n\nsuch features were not fully present in Brakhage films before 'Anticipation of\n\nthe Night', such as \"Wonder Ring'. The assertion turns out to be true...\n\nA testable hypothesis has many merits, that untestable assertions do not. For\n\none thing, it corresponds to something other people can actually examine in\n\nthe real world - here, something about the concrete style of some Brakhage\n\nfilms. For another, other writers can build on it, or expand it, or modify it or\n\ncorrect it, because they know exactly what it means in terms of actual real\n\nworld experience.\n\nMike Grost\n\n6503\n\nFrom: Dan Sallitt\n\nDate: Sun Jan 11, 2004 5:02pm\n\nSubject: Re: 2004: Not a promising year\n\n> The first film I saw in 2004 was the acclaimed \"Young Adam\" by David\n\n> McKenzie.

My movie life\n\nhas improved a lot since I started going to Toronto four or five years\n\nago.\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say that cinema hit a bad patch in the 80s and\n\nhas been picking up steam ever since. But it's possible that I missed a\n\nlot of good films because foreign film distribution in the US was so\n\npoor in the 80s; it's improved a great deal since then. - Dan\n\n6504\n\nFrom: David Ehrenstein\n\nDate: Sun Jan 11, 2004 5:03pm\n\nSubject: Re: Biette challenged\n\n--- jpcoursodon"
