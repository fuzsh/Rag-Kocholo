        "text": "Related: 61st Cannes poster rolled out\n\nCANNES — The latest flurry of chatter ahead of May’s Festival de Cannes concerns a fat martial arts panda, a trio of high-profile documentaries and music diva Madonna.\n\nDreamWorks’ animated comedy-adventure “Kung Fu Panda” is expected to kick and punch its way to the Croisette.\n\nThe voice cast — which boasts Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu and Dustin Hoffman — are among those expected to jet into the French resort to support the movie’s slot in the official selection.\n\nAlso hotly tipped to be part of the official lineup announcement due Wednesday are a trio of docus headlined by Emir Kusturica’s “Maradona,” the long-gestating movie centering on infamous Argentinean soccer legend Diego Maradona. The diminutive soccer star is expected to roll into town, according to French media reports.\n\nThe Cannes docu list also is expected to include Marina Zenovich’s “Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired,” which secured a prize at this year’s Sundance Film Festival. And James Toback’s “Tyson” documentary, with former heavyweight champion of the world “Iron” Mike Tyson tipped to attend, also is likely to feature somewhere in the program.\n\nMeanwhile, this year’s AmfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research dinner, is expected to be presided over by one of the biggest names in pop, with Le Parisien claiming Madonna has taken up one of the more glamorous roles during the festival."
