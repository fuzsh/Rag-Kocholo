I mean, I can understand the utter pointless divinization that argentinians render to Maradona (I actually consider he WAS a great player though) but his story isn&#xB4;t much worthy of Kusturica&#xB4;s genius (so typical sports idol&#xB4;s ascention, glory, decay and recovery)... Or maybe we&#xB4;ll have to wait for final product.\r<br>\r<br>What do you think?",

Oh, yeah, there's not a new Pele movie! Haha.\n\nreply share\n\ntaany2000 18 years ago\n\nKusturica was asked by Maradona to make this film because he felt he was the best director for the job. Probably he could relate to the human characters in his films. Kusturica is the best film director in the world (most unique and succesful style) - and the same goes for good ole Diego.\n\nreply share\n\nWord_inquisitor 18 years ago\n\nEmbarrasing myself? how can that be when I'm only talking about the player who changed football? You can't say that about Maradona, except probably Argentinians, who, in the most part, have themselves in the highest regards.\n\n\"I don't *beep* believe this!

It is not only Argentinians who claims that Diego is the greatest player ever played on the green pitch. You can not compare the powers of Pele to the mightness of a God like Diego. Incomparable! So stop act like a maniac with your Pelé-prppaganda. If you dont like Maradona, you can ask some lame director to make a film about your little idol. Peace!\n\nPS I am going to see Diego play in Swedden this Wednesday.

Go lite some candles with your Maradona pic and masturbate for all I care.\n\nPelé is far more important in the history of football than that drug addict Maradona.\n\n\"I don't *beep* believe this!

Pele was maybe more perfect, but Maradona had an ability to bend the rules and to mesmerize the audience that no other player had and probably will have (Messi cant compare to him, his best performances were copy of maradona's trademark style).\n\nEven tough, is difficult to compare players with different positions.\n\nThe reason they make a movie about Maradona is because he is an interesting character beyond the field, and Pele is boring as hell. Maradona even had a fight with the pope, and that gives him a \"Beatles\" appeal to the world.\n\nThere is no discussion tough that Brasil has better football overall, Brasil breaths football.\n\nreply share\n\ngusdelund 16 years ago\n\nRedifine football?!?!?!?\n\nC'mon then you should look at Distefano, best player before Pele! (if not ask a Spaniard about him)\n\nWhile Pele sold his sold to the Devil (somebody remember Cosmos in the 70s?) Maradona kept his integrity.\n\nKusturitza is an admirer of Maradona, because as all former Jugoslavian they like football.\n\nI don't understand how ppl can even discuss about who is the best football player of all time, for me is not a discussion, without doubt El Diego!!!\n\nreply share\n\nIt seem to me that most of u don't know much about football. In fact everywhere there is a \"football fight\" on the internet it involves most of the times the Pele/Maradona duel. I bet none of u have watched them play live(neither did i) but u only discus about what u saw in the media. Im 100% sure that ur opionion about who is the greatest was developed before u even saw at least a video of them playing, just from listening to that media crap.\n\nThe truth is that u are arguing for something that does not exist. U can't even compare 2 modern day players. They have to play on the same position,equal teams etc. E.g U can't compare Ronaldinho and Kaka cuz their styles are so different. Let alone compare 2 players who have played in different eras. Nobody questioned that they weren't good but for all i know there are players like Di Friedenreich,Stefano,Puskas,Best,Van Basten,Platini or especially Beckanbauer or Cruijf. What makes Maradona or Pele better than Cruijf? What player has ever achieved the level of Beckenbauer in defense? Just cuz he didn't scored goals doesn't mean he wasnt the best.\n\nIf u really want a \"best player ever\" than u should look at the problem like this: What player rose most about the others in his era?.\n\nreply share\n\nPeople!!! This documentary is not only about football, it is aboout ANTIGLOBALISM ( do you use this word in English?). Both Kusturica and Maradona are against globalism and this film is actually about politics. It actually doesn't matter is he the best player all the time or Pele. They were both great players. But actually they are very opposite political personalities. Pele is typical NWO guy who made big money on promoting Coca - Cola and other bih corporations. Maradona had never done that...\n\nreply share\n\njp_spitzer 16 years ago\n\nFinally some one talking about the film.\n\nI'm Argentine, I still love Maradona, but I'm not interested in all this senseless discussion.\n\nreply share\n\nEasternMafia 16 years ago\n\nI guess someone should do it? Out there is a lots of crap of everything and anything.\n\nreply share"
