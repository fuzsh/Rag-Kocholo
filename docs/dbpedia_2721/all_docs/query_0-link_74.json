        "text": "Wilson served twice as Prime Minister during the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nHis first term began on October 16, 1964, and ended on June 19, 1970.\n\nWilson narrowly won the 1964 general election but won the majority in the 1966 snap election.\n\nWilson was succeeded by Edward Heath of the Conservative Party in June 1970.\n\nWas Harold Wilson anti-monarchy?\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, was anti-monarchy.\n\nWilson was a liberal politician and was known in the Labour Party as a left-winger.\n\nDuring his time as Prime Minister, Wilson and the Queen appeared to have a friendly relationship.\n\nAccording to Royal biographer, Robert Lacey, Wilson’s non-traditional ruling class background “persuaded the Queen to drop a lot of stuffy protocol that had remained since Queen Victoria”.\n\nOlivia Colman, who plays Queen Elizabeth II in The Crown season three, spoke to The Times about the Queen’s friendship with Wilson.\n\nShe said: “I think she's a leftie, but I think what's extraordinary and wonderful about her, she can be everything to anybody.\n\nShe said: “Whatever you want her to be, she sort of is. I want her to be a leftie and think she is because she loved Harold Wilson.”\n\nWhen Wilson resigned, Queen Elizabeth II dined at 10 Downing Street to mark his resignation, an honour she had only bestowed to one other prime minister, Sir Winston Churchill.\n\nThe Crown season 3 is streaming on Netflix now."
