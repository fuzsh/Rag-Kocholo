        "text": "It begins innocently enough. A golf ball is teed up and thwacked off screen, and the camera pans out to reveal Harold Wilson, togged up in a radiantly ugly jumper, ambling across a Scilly Isles golf course, his wife, Mary, bumping cheerfully along behind him.\n\nThen the jaunty theme tune kicks in: “Like Humpty-Dumpty he sat on a wall/ giving the orders/ and then, he had a great fall/ Now, he’s one of yesterday’s men.”\n\nThe opening scenes of Yesterday’s Men, a BBC documentary first broadcast 50 years ago in 1971, give little hint of its significance. Yet the 42-minute programme would prove so contentious that its creator and presenter, David Dimbleby, would never be granted an interview with Wilson again, the BBC would be threatened with libel, and they would never be able to re-broadcast it in Wilson's lifetime.\n\nIt purported to be an account of Labour’s “wilderness year” after their surprise defeat at the hands of Edward Heath’s Conservatives in the 1970 election. In fact, its rambunctiously satirical tone and forensic examination of politicians’ private lives set a new precedent for political programmes – one which, even 50 years later, the BBC has not had the gumption to match.\n\n“After the programme was broadcast, there was a retreat by the BBC because it was too controversial,” argues Jon Lawrence, Professor of Modern British History at Exeter University and author of Electing Our Masters, a study of the relationship between the media and politicians. “In the name of exploring the idea of how powerful men cope without power, it exploded a whole load of myths that Labour, and particularly Wilson, had constructed over the preceding decade.”\n\nAfter a long hibernation in the vaults of the BBC archives, the programme was finally shown again during 2013’s Harold Wilson Night, a special evening of programmes to mark 50 years since he was elected Labour leader in 1963. It’s now available on YouTube, where it still makes for an incendiary watch.\n\nIn some ways, it’s timeless. Scenes of Wilson and his family warbling along tunelessly to O God, Our Help in Ages Past in his local church, or taking part in a boozy sing-a-long in a Scilly Isles Labour club have a knockabout Monty Python-esque quality. And the programme's themes resonate today, too. Internecine power struggles in high office? Check. Britain’s relationship with Europe? Uh-huh. The morality of making money after leaving government… Did someone say Greensill Capital?\n\nBut in other senses, it shows an alien world. There’s Dimbleby’s luxuriant bouffant for one. But it's the candour of these big political beasts on camera that strikes you now. Their unguarded pronouncements come across as outright naive in our social media age when every word or tea-bag dunking is primped and scrutinised by legions of PR professionals. For instance, there’s a lovely moment early on when Anthony Crosland describes his shock at suddenly being out of office: “As soon as parliament met again, you discovered that a lot of other horrible people were announcing horrible policies.”\n\nAnd it was this intimacy which caused the first ripples of unease, says Lawrence. “At the time, politicians' private lives were largely off limits. The Sixties had all been about image and Labour had been particularly astute in cultivating that image – Wilson had created this folksy persona in contrast to Heath’s perceived stuffiness.”\n\nThat winsome narrative was sunk by Yesterday’s Men. The programme dwells at length on the grace-and-favour lifestyles that the erstwhile Labour cabinet enjoyed. And there is a strong implication that they have over-mortgaged themselves now that they are no longer on ministerial salaries. “I couldn’t live on an MP’s salary and have a full-time secretary and run a car,” explains James Callaghan, with woebegone frankness.\n\n“The programme pointed the finger and said: ‘These people are not remotely ordinary,’” says Lawrence.\n\nYet it is Wilson’s post-premiership antics which come under heaviest scrutiny. His extensive property empire – three houses, including a bungalow in the Scillies and a London mansion – is detailed. As is the price he paid for his latest purchase: £60,000. This at a time when the average house cost £4,000.\n\nBut it was the matter of his memoir which generated the greatest ruckus. Many in the Opposition and the Civil Service were deeply unhappy about the autobiographic account of his years in power, which had been serialised in The Sunday Times. And during the interview between Dimbleby and Wilson that is threaded throughout the documentary, Dimbleby challenged him on how much he had earned from it. The question detonated a depth-charge of outrage.\n\n“There was this astonishing explosion of anger,” Dimbleby recalled in a behind-the-scenes segment broadcast during Harold Wilson Night in 2013. “We were gobsmacked by it. Inadvertently it seemed, we’d stumbled upon this legal tax avoidance scheme.”\n\nThe game, as Dimbleby tells it, was that Wilson, as a first-time author, had delivered his memoir to the publishers for a tiny, nominal fee. This meant that he could keep the substantial royalties tax-free.\n\nIn response to this apparently-innocent bit of sleuthing, Wilson began to fulminate that Dimbleby would never have dared ask Heath how much his yacht cost. The implication was that, as representative of the BBC, Dimbleby was eager to protect Establishment figures and sink Labour’s chances at the next election.\n\nThat’s certainly how Wilson read it. “By the time the programme was broadcast, he’d created this enormous furore,” remembered Angela Pope, the producer of Yesterday's Men, in the behind-the-scenes programme.\n\nWilson ordered the offending footage scrubbed from the broadcast – and threatened libel if it ever appeared again while he was alive. The BBC duly doffed its cap, and obeyed.\n\n“[It was] an outrageous and shoddy programme,” fulminated Labour peer Lord Donoghue during the Harold Wilson Night interviews. “A disgrace to the BBC.”\n\nLawrence, though, argues Wilson’s reaction should be contextualised within his long-running feud with Auntie. “Wilson’s relationship to the BBC had been sour for a while,” he explains. “He didn’t trust them. And he had long cultivated ITV before then because their viewing demography was much closer to Labour voters in the 1960s.”\n\nIndeed, Wilson’s attitude recalls the Corbynite griping about “media bias” in more recent years. In particular, Vice Media’s 2016 documentary, Jeremy Corbyn: The Outsider, which followed the recently-elected Labour leader through his first months in power, was singled out by Labour's Left for its apparent hostility. The irony, though, as with Yesterday’s Men, is “media bias” is a chimera: one man’s Establishment stooge is another’s trenchant interviewer.\n\n“[Wilson] would probably have seen Yesterday’s Men as pro-Conservative,” says Lawrence. “But you watch that programme today and it could equally be seen as a Leftist critique of Wilson and his government for being part of the elite.”\n\nYet Dimbleby’s wide-eyed denial of any agenda doesn’t quite ring true. There's the matter of the programme's name for a start. The Labour politicians were told they would be interviewed for a programme called “Her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition”. The actual name, a re-engineering of Labour campaign attack on Heath Conservatives, was only revealed at broadcast.\n\nThe sharp-edged mocking tone of the programme is not-so-innocent either. Largely this is down to the theme song, which is stitched right the way through. Its chorus gives a flavour: “We’re not the big shots anymore/ where are the autograph hunters? / Yesterday, we were front pages news, / now it’s only the past to confront us.\"\n\nIt was composed by The Scaffold, a satirical Liverpudlian pop group behind the 1968 hit Lily the Pink. How they got the commission is a little murky. But band member Mike McCartney – brother of The Beatles' Paul – remembers they first met Dimbleby soon after Lily the Pink went to Number 1.\n\n“We were in this little castle in the Wicklow Mountains,” he recalls. “And there’s a photo of us outside with Dave [Dimbleby], Mick Jagger and the Haitian ambassador. It was a unique moment in the Swinging Sixties when everything merged into one another. My God, you look at the satirical tone of the programme, and you wonder whether it would be shoved under the carpet today.”\n\nFellow band member and poet Roger McGough, though, believes The Scaffold’s music resonated at the time for a different reason. “Being in Liverpool, the Swinging Sixties seemed to be happening elsewhere, in California or in London. It was a class thing, and what was going on in Liverpool was the docks closing down and my dad losing his job.”\n\nThese working-class credentials had made The Scaffold a favourite of the BBC – and of Wilson. They fronted the BBC’s campaign around decimalisation, and Wilson named their song Thank U Very Much as his favourite in an interview with Radio 4.\n\nBut, says McGough of their theme for Yesterday’s Men: “He hated it. He was very dismayed when he heard it.”\n\nMcGough, though, doesn’t regret taking part in the documentary. “I liked Wilson,” he explains. “Politically, I’m left-of-centre. But as artists, we’re always looking to see what we can add to the debate. Documentaries, like poetry, aren’t about being intellectual – but showing life in a different light, in a way that touches people in a way they didn’t know they could be touched.”\n\nMcCartney thinks it had such an impact because it showed the powerful in a novel, emperor’s-new-clothes light. “It was one of those moments when you saw how people really are,” he says. “It is important. This is when history is made.”\n\nPerhaps it was too history-making, especially for the BBC.\n\n“It foregrounded the debate around whether public broadcasters should make the news or merely report it,” explains Lawrence. “And this was definitely news.”\n\nThe BBC, as the Martin Bashir scandal highlights, has shied away from making news ever since, he reckons. Would it be made today?\n\n“I don’t think so,” Lawrence reflects. “The BBC is particularly scared of politicians at the moment. We’re in a wave of retreat – and that happened after 1971. There’s still a sense it is a different type of institution than any other media outlet, and that makes lots of the people who run it nervous and lots of people in it frustrated.”\n\nDespite being half a century old, the programme is still a fresh – and unprecedented – approach to public broadcasting. Even now, Yesterday’s Men feels like tomorrow’s news."
