        "text": "Harold Wilson, a Yorkshireman who combined a common touch with an uncommon intellect that turned him into the British Labor Party's most formidable vote getter and perennial Prime Minister, died early yesterday in London. He was 79.\n\nLady Wilson, his wife of 55 years, issued a statement saying Lord Wilson \"died peacefully in his sleep around midnight.\" The cause of death was not given, but he was reported to have been fighting cancer for over a decade.\n\nHe was admitted to St. Thomas's Hospital in central London on Sunday as a patient under the National Health Service, in keeping with his political image as a man of few pretensions and no taste for the lavish life.\n\nIn recent years Lord Wilson -- he was made a baron in 1983 -- had faded from public view, largely because of illness. He spoke only four times during debates in the House of Lords, most recently nine years ago, although he attended sessions faithfully until last year.\n\nBoth Houses of Parliament cut sessions short yesterday in his honor, and tributes flowed from political figures of all parties. Prime Minister John Major, a Conservative, said: \"Over four decades, Harold Wilson was at the center of British public life. From the time of his appointment to Cabinet at the age of 31, he served his country diligently and loyally.\"\n\nTony Blair, the new Labor leader who hopes to emulate Mr. Wilson's feat of leading the party to victory after more than a decade in opposition, said he had implanted \"a deep sense of modern vision for the country.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
