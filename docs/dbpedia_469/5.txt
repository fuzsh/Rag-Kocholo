He is a former lecturer at universities. Emad identified a new political strategy called "The Strategy of Reversed Roles", considering it as a complementary Strategy of group decision making

The strategy shows its effectiveness and use in the face of a new situations or decisive decisions like war and hard economic choices, and particularly in circumstances where the government expects great opposition. lieutenant is used to absorb the momentum of opposition.

Later, if the government intended to change its position again either directly or through collateral pathways to make it more coherent with ideology, the classical political opponents in this case would be less enthusiastic in opposing that position as it would be otherwise expected.

This will give the decision more power and influences the consensus positively - the government usually can benefit from both the initial and the final position. Emad mentioned an example about Turkish attitude towards the 2003 Iraq war, when the AKP - which had just been elected to power - supported Washington in the Iraq war, while the Turkish military and secularists opposed the conflict.

Politics

If a government or a political group in power takes a position that goes against its point of view or ideology in a matter, that leaves political opponents with only two options: to support the decision, as might be expected, or to go against it, preserving their role as opposition. In this case both parties have reversed their role and each one of them stood on the otherâ€™s side ideology.
