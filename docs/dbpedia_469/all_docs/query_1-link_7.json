        "text": "The root cause of this horrible conflict is that Israeli Zionists actually believe they own every Palestinian home, farm, & inch of land, & have the right to kill indigenous Palestinian families that refuse to leave, for the crime of not being Jewish. Please listen to renowned Jewish-American Professor Noam Chomsky explain how ridiculous the Zionist ownership claim is: lnkd.in/gtHPPHUz That‚Äôs because Palestinians have been there for thousands of years, never left, & their genetics proves it. At some point, their Canaanite & Jewish ancestors simply converted to Christianity &/or Islam. So why would that mean Jewish immigrants from Europe & the U.S., who have never even been there, own all of their homes & property? And what would you do if someone stole or demolished your house & livelihood, killed some of your family, & left the rest of you with nothing, to live in the squalor of a refugee camp? That is what Israel did to over 750K Palestinians in 1948, over 300K in 1967, over 250K since 1967, & now it's trying to do it to the families in Gaza FOR THE 2ND TIME. Most of the families in Gaza owned homes & farms where Israeli cities & towns now stand, which Israel literally stole from them. Most even still have their front door keys. A few of MANY Jewish-Israeli sources: 1) Prof. Ilan Papp√©, Israeli Historian: lnkd.in/gFBK6sPB 2) Miko Peled, ex-IDF soldier, son of an Israeli general & grandson of one of Israel‚Äôs founders: lnkd.in/geiy3_5s Israel has also continued stealing more Palestinian homes & farms EVERY YEAR in the West Bank as part of its brutal 57 year apartheid & has imposed a brutal blockade of Gaza since 2005. ALL illegal, immoral, & ongoing acts of war. I also cry for the 38 Israeli children & others killed on Oct 7th, but this horrible conflict did NOT start on that day. The proof is the nearly 2300 Palestinian children killed by Israeli soldiers & settlers between 2000 & Oct 2023, including 43 during the 9 months just before Oct 7th (all details on BTselem.org). Here is the ex-head of Israel‚Äôs Shin Bet (their FBI), Ami Ayalon, & ex-Israeli PM & General, Ehud Barak, BOTH say IF THEY WERE PALESTINIAN THEY WOULD FIGHT ISRAEL BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THEIR LIBERTY: lnkd.in/guNE7vay Even the ex-head of Israel‚Äôs Mossad (their CIA) said ‚ÄúThere is an apartheid state here. In a territory where two people are judged under two legal systems, that is an apartheid state.‚Äù lnkd.in/gF_2dqvM. I will keep advocating for peaceful resistance & Palestinians have been trying for decades, but IDF soldiers shoot them in the knees, kill them, or at least imprison & beat them. If you don't believe it, read this 2020 Haaretz article titled: '42 Knees in One Day': Israeli Snipers Open Up About Shooting Gaza Protesters: lnkd.in/g4VqQRzs And now, Israel is committing mass ETHNIC CLEANSING & GENOCIDE WITH THE WEAPONS WE KEEP GIVING THEM & has killed OVER 25,000 WOMEN & CHILDREN (~70% or the dead), according to the US military: lnkd.in/gaMEPKSn\n\nWe're living in a time where the media wants us to believe that genocide is a justifiable response to the attack last weekend. Where somehow \"flattening Gaza\" is part of a way to get the hostages in Gaza back. Where citizens of Gaza are being blamed for electing Hamas 17 years ago (indirectly implying they did this to themselves) while half the population is under 18... It shouldn't be controversial to say that cutting off water, power and aid to Gaza, a concentration camp by all definitions, is wrong; that children do not deserve to die for actions of any militant group; that Israel is committing obvious war crimes and has a long history of oppressing and killing Palestinians (47 children killed this year before the attack, and hundreds more since) and yet for some reason it is. It goes without saying, wanting the Palestinians to live in peace and safety is not the same as supporting Hamas (as the BBC rightly apologised for implying earlier) the deaths of innocents are tragic regardless of which side they are born on. The Palestinians are not \"Human Animals\" as the Israeli defence minister called them, and there is no justification of their mass murder. We are being asked to stand together with the apartheid state of Israel and to do otherwise is being portrayed as somehow being pro Hamas (it doesn't really matter if the logic doesn't follow, it just is lol). Many of us might remember the \"with us or against us\" rhetoric post 9/11 and the carnage which followed in the decades after, such cycles of violence never lead to anything good. For us Muslims, the Qur'an teaches us that there is only ever one side we should be taking, and that is the side of Justice, and so I conclude with this verse from the Qur'an \"O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm in justice, witnesses for AllƒÅh, even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives. Whether one is rich or poor, AllƒÅh is more worthy of both. So follow not [personal] inclination, lest you not be just. And if you distort [your testimony] or refuse [to give it], then indeed AllƒÅh is ever, of what you do, Aware\" (4:135)\n\nOK! THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON AND ONE PROGRAMME THAT CAN RESTORE WORLD PEACE. There ISN'T ANYBODY ELSE FOR GOD'S SAKE! RESHARING AND LIKING MY POST BELOW IS NOT ENOUGH TO CATALYSE GLOBAL ACTION! We need full support from ALL NATIONS!!! See üëá: I am not imagining things but there clearly is an overwhelming worldwide plebiscite for the following: 1. https://lnkd.in/erHnd4rT 2. https://lnkd.in/ehuS9eXj 3. https://lnkd.in/e6kDYAws 4. https://lnkd.in/eThHWCFd 5. https://lnkd.in/e6-q-Vr9 6. https://lnkd.in/dnCVjBtd 7. https://lnkd.in/eamkZ2ek 8. https://lnkd.in/eCn_-HfX 9. https://lnkd.in/eHZhuDZZ 10. Difference between the WEF & the NCBP! https://lnkd.in/eK3qBB_f WHO or WHAT can bring back peace to the world? Is there anyone else among the eight billion minus one human beings on this planet? There is? WHO? There isn't? Then I respectfully ask for World politico-financial support to rethink the world together. Then NATO would not be needed anymore. Nor would any other EU defense. A World Army would be useful in case of hostile invasion by an alien species."
