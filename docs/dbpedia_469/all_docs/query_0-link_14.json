Dr. Grace Lindsay is Professor of Medical Surgical Nursing at Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, KSA. Her career in nursing and midwifery practice spans a period of over 25 years as a clinician, teacher and researcher. During these years she has worked within the higher education and health care sectors, and in partnership medical charities, publishers and research funding bodies. Such experience is reflected in her current internationally relevant healthcare interests.\n\nAs a nurse, clinical practice started out in midwifery as an RN in the labor/delivery room, moving on to adult intensive care and latterly cardiac preventive and rehabilitative practices. Over these years of growing experience her work was focused on the domains of nursing education and research. A central interest has been in contributing to the evidence base for understanding patient experiences, patients’ health beliefs/actions and outcomes on health as a result of health-care interventions. These interests became the focus of her doctoral studies in health outcome following cardiac bypass surgery which continues to be an area of interest. Nurse-led initiatives designed to improve the care of cardiac patients evolved from this research and formed the basis for her future research direction and in attracting research grant funding. She has made significant contributions to the nursing and health-care literature through a range of peer reviewed journal and book publications. Findings have been disseminated at numerous international and national conferences, and in peer-reviewed international health-care journals (over 60 publications) and two edited textbooks.
