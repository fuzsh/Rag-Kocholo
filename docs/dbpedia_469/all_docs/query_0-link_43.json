        "text": "The objective of this article is to identify the various ways in which electronic tax systems can be protected and sustained in Nigeria, and how the occurrence of cyber tax crimes can be prevented and curtailed, drawing from the lessons and the experiences of other countries in the fight against electronic tax fraud.\n\nRecently, with the increasing availability of Internet, E-commerce has captured the interest of individual consumers and companies of all sizes and interests. Moreover, with the advanced technologies now available, it is more and more spoken about the Digital Economy (DE-Digital Economy). The basic idea is that through e-commerce one can achieve the exchange of ideas, goods, knowledge, beyond simply buying / selling of products and services. E-commerce technologies can be used to run a business using the Internet for communication, Intranet or other computer networks. The concept of virtual value is very important because it offers the possibility of digital information in the usual processes occurring in conducting business activities. One of the main goals of e-commerce strategies is to identify and encourage users of information via the Internet, giving them the necessary support. Electronic commerce offers the ability to run a business in a flexible manner that can benefit from ...\n\nThis study examined how electronic tax system (E- tax system) reduces tax evasion in Nigeria. The survey sample was drawn from Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) staff and small and medium-scale enterprise taxpayers registered in F.C.T., Abuja, Nigeria. Primary data was derived from a questionnaire administered to a population of 60 officials and employees of the FIRS and taxpayers at a small and medium-scale enterprise registered in F.C.T., Abuja, Nigeria. The secondary data used was extracted from the tax revenue collection report on the FIRS platform for 2000–2019 (20 years). The conclusive research design was used. General linear model and linear regression were used to analyze the data collected. The E-tax system was measured using actual tax revenues and the level of electronic tax services. In contrast, tax evasion was measured using tax compliance and mind-set of taxpayers towards E-tax system. Taxpayers’ attitudes towards E-tax system, actual tax revenue, tax compliance ...\n\nThe rapid growth of e-commerce, especially the sale of goods and services over the internet, has fuelled a debate about the taxation regimes to be used. The shift from a physically oriented commercial environment to a knowledge-based electronic environment poses serious and substantial issues in relation to taxation and taxation regimes. Tax administrations throughout the world face the formidable task of protecting their revenue base without hindering either the development of new technologies or the involvement of the business community in the evolving and growing e-market place. Concerns of governments centre on the impact of e-commerce on the state and local revenue. Whereas states can impose a tax on residents’ purchases from out-of-state vendors, they cannot impose an obligation on those vendors to collect the tax unless the vendor has a substantial presence, or nexus, in the state. These problems will be greater for developing countries. The shrinking of the tax base will have a disproportionat e effect and further jeopardize the already fragile economy of the developing world."
