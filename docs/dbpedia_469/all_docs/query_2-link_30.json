        "text": "My fellow Americans, please wake up. Israel is dragging us into war with Iran, & possibly WW3, to distract us from the genocide & ethnic cleansing it's committing with OUR tax dollars. 🙏Please write & call your representatives to demand they stop this madness. >14K KIDS + >10K WOMEN = >65% of the dead = U.S. Funded GENOCIDE 👉Please listen to U. of Chicago Prof. John Mearsheimer explain how Israel is trying to ethnically cleanse both Gaza & the West Bank, & drag us into a war with Iran, which could easily spiral into WW3. He says Israel has always used war as a cover for ethnic cleansing & thinks \"the bigger the war, the greater the opportunity for ethnic cleansing”: lnkd.in/g9tDWs2i 👉What would you do if someone stole or demolished your house & livelihood, killed some of your family, & left the rest of you with nothing to live in the squalor of a refugee camp? That is what Israel did to over 750K Palestinians in 1948, over 300K in 1967, over 250K since 1967, & MORE EVERY YEAR – FOR THE CRIME OF NOT BEING JEWISH. 👉Most of the families in Gaza owned homes & farms where Israeli cities & towns are now, which Israel stole from them. Many even still have their front door keys. & NOW ISRAEL IS DOING IT TO THEM FOR THE 2ND TIME. Jewish-Israeli sources: 1) Prof. Ilan Pappé: lnkd.in/gFBK6sPB 2) Miko Peled, ex-IDF soldier, son of Israeli general & grandson of one of Israel’s founders: lnkd.in/geiy3_5s 👉& DECADES OF ETHNIC CLEANSING & BRUTAL RACIST APARTHEID is why EVEN Israel’s ex-head of Shin Bet (their FBI), Ami Ayalon, & ex-PM & General, Ehud Barak, BOTH say IF THEY WERE PALESTINIAN THEY WOULD FIGHT ISRAEL BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THEIR LIBERTY: lnkd.in/guNE7vay 👉EVEN the ex-head of Israel’s Mossad (their CIA), said “There is an apartheid state here. In a territory where two people are judged under two legal systems, that is an apartheid state.” lnkd.in/gF_2dqvM. 👉I also cry for the 38 Israeli kids & others killed on 10/7, but this horrible conflict did NOT start on that day. The proof is the nearly 2300 Palestinian kids killed by Israeli soldiers & settlers between 2000 & Oct 2023, including 43 kids during the 9 months just before 10/7 (all details on BTselem.org) 👉I will keep calling for peaceful resistance & Palestinians have tried for decades, but IDF soldiers shoot them in the knees, kill them, or at least imprison & beat them. If you don't believe it, read this 2020 Haaretz article titled: '42 Knees in One Day': Israeli Snipers Open Up About Shooting Gaza Protesters: lnkd.in/g4VqQRzs 👉& if you still believe that Israel has offered Palestinians many generous peace deals that they keep rejecting, read this article: lnkd.in/g2_EV6dV Find hundreds of Israeli soldiers, professors, & journalists explaining the truth on this YouTube channel: lnkd.in/g9KFXxMr Sharing their videos will both promote equal rights & fight antisemitism by showing that many Jewish people oppose Israel’s genocide, ethnic cleansing & apartheid.\n\n🙏 A Call for Justice and Compassion for Gaza 🙏 For 18 agonizing days, Gaza has borne the weight of continuous Israeli bombardment, a relentless storm that has left a trail of tragedy in its wake. Thousands of Palestinians have been killed and injured, while over a million people are now displaced. 🌆 Neighborhoods Erased, Lives Shattered: Entire communities have been erased from existence, and families torn apart. The numbers are staggering — 2% of health facilities no longer serve those in need, and 43% of homes are either destroyed or damaged. 🕊️ An Unending Cycle: The painful reality is that this update mirrors a visual produced in 2014, revealing a cycle of devastation that continues unchecked. Israeli war crimes go unaccounted for, and impunity reigns. The lack of accountability has paved the way for the heartbreaking devastation we bear witness to today. 💪 Our Collective Responsibility: It falls upon us to demand change and justice. Let's continue to pressure our political leaders to bring an end to this tragedy and to put a stop to the suffering in Gaza. 🔗 Together, we can make a difference.

Together, we can be a force for positive change. 🌍💙 #JusticeForGaza #EndTheViolence #StandWithGaza\n\nWhat happens if a UN Security Council resolution is violated? UN Security Council resolutions ARE binding (contrary to what the US is saying). Israel breached the ceasefire resolution within hours, and last night bombarded Gaza again. Chapter VII of the UN Charter states: Article 41 The Security Council may decide what measures not involving the use of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon the Members of the United Nations to apply such measures. These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations. Article 42 Should the Security Council consider that measures provided for in Article 41 would be inadequate or have proved to be inadequate, it may take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security. Such action may include demonstrations, blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces of Members of the United Nations. So first start is sanctions. The Security Council is no stranger to imposing sanctions. Since 1966, the Security Council has established 31 sanctions regimes, in Southern Rhodesia, South Africa, the Former Yugoslavia (2), Haiti (2), Angola, Liberia (3), Eritrea/Ethiopia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Côte d’Ivoire, Iran, Somalia/Eritrea, ISIL (Da’esh) and Al-Qaida, Iraq (2), Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, Lebanon, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Libya (2), the Taliban, Guinea-Bissau, Central African Republic, Yemen, South Sudan and Mali. In 2022, the UNSC tried imposing sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. But Russia being an SC permanent member, vetoed it. So the resolution was not passed, but this did not stop Western countries (and many others) imposing sanctions on Russia. So there's a precedent. Even if US vetoes any sanctions resolution, other member states can and should (to honour international law) sanction Israel. States can sanction fully or partially. Yesterday 120 UK MPs wrote to David Cameron (Foreign Secretary) to ban UK arms sales to Israel - which includes parts of fighter jets and missiles. The UK government can do this immediately. Start with this. This belongs on LinkedIn because a few of us will soon issue a note to Corporate Compliance and Risk teams. It's on companies to ensure they are not in any way complicit in a genocide (note the UN has just confirmed this IS a genocide).\n\nThe indiscriminate massacre by the terrorist group Hamas is unfathomable, and the barbaric killing of innocent Israeli lives cannot be justified as an argument to the apartheid decades of blockade the Palestinians have endured. The ongoing bombardment by the IDF has wreaked an insurmountable havoc across swaths of Gaza. As the world mourns and sympathies the loss of innocent Israeli lives, thousands of Gazan families are destroyed. In the end, this will not be the end. The ongoing slaughter at the hands of the IDF will, unfortunately and gravely, have ripple effect across the world. Communities of all, from the developed to the developing world will come to face with the wrath unleashed as a result of these two factions in the Middle East. From places of tourism, public servicing places, health institutions, even sleepy heartland community gathering places will not be spared. Satellite Islamic extremist groups will take this opportunity to strike fear into the hearts, regardless of faith and beliefs, or the absence of it. Alike, white-supremacists and right-wing radical groups will target places of worship. No country can stay neutral as such events are unfolding. The war might be between Israel and Hamas, but the effects will be felt by everyone in this world. #worldpeace #worldinpieces #insolidarity"
