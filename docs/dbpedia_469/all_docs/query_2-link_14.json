        "text": "Results\n\nBetween 4 April 2022 and 4 September 2022, data from 4273 patients across 144 hospitals in 25 countries were collected and analysed (2271 women, 53.1%; median age 50 years; Figure 1 and Table 1 and S7). Some 1923 (45.0%) patients were recruited from high-income countries, and 2350 (55.0%) from low- and middle-income countries (Table S2). A third of patients were prescribed opioid analgesia at discharge after one of 19 eligible surgical procedures (30.7% [n=1311] overall; Table 1). Patients were followed up at a median of 7 days (IQR 7 - 8).\n\nOpioid prescriptions at surgical discharge\n\nPatients who received opioids at discharge tended to be slightly older, with a higher ASA, increased BMI, cancer or kidney disease, smoke or vape, and consume more alcohol (p<0.05; Table 1). After risk-adjustment, age (β = −0.30, 95% CI −0.57 - 0.03, p = 0.031), specialty of surgery (β >20, p<0.02) and total OME consumed 24 hours prior to discharge (β 0.6, 95% CI 0.1 - 0.21, p<0.001) were associated with increased quantity of opioid prescribed at discharge (Table S3).\n\nNotably, patients were likely to be prescribed significantly more opioid after orthopaedic (β = 89.12, 95% CI 75.29 - 102.94, p<0.001) and gynaecological procedures (β = 20.11, 95% CI 3.47 - 36.75, p = 0.018), compared to general surgical procedures. Of note, following all procedures except arthroplasty, fewer than 50% of patients were prescribed an opioid at discharge (Figure 2A). The total amount of opioids consumed 24 hours prior to discharge was also positively associated with larger opioid prescriptions at discharge (β = 0.16, 95% CI 0.1 - 0.21, p<0.001). This mean of the imputed models for the quantity of opioids prescribed had a good fit with conditional R2 = 0.39 and the pooled model is summarised in Table S3. Importantly, of 1952 patients who received no opioids prior to discharge, 197 (10.1%) received an opioid prescription on discharge.\n\nPatients prescribed opioids at discharge tended to have longer operations (p<0.001), more complications (p<0.001), and were more frequently referred to an acute pain service (8.2% vs 4.7%, p<0.001), but had similar lengths of stay (median 2 days (IQR 1-3) vs 2 days (IQR 1-3), p=0.698) to those not prescribed opioids. Regarding co-analgesics, patients prescribed opioids were more often discharged with paracetamol (89.4% vs 71.4%, p<0.001), gabapentinoids (4.6% vs 1.3%, p<0.001), and tricyclic antidepressants (2.4% vs 0.5%, p<0.001). In the 7-days post-discharge, patients prescribed opioids experienced more pain (median visual analogue rating 20 (IQR 5-40) vs 10 (IQR 0-30), p<0.001). These data are summarised in Table 2.\n\nOf those prescribed opioids, the vast majority were given a single opioid (89.5%), and the majority used this prescription (79%). The majority (85%) of these patients also used paracetamol after discharge. Of note only 37% of patients prescribed an opioid were discharged with laxatives, and 22.5% with antiemetics (Table 3). Only 30.5% received documented advice regarding safe disposal of unused opioids.\n\nComparison of prescription quantities to consumption quantities\n\nWhen prescribed, the median quantity of opioids was 100 OME (IQR 60 - 200). In comparison, at 7 days follow-up, the median quantity consumed by patients was 40 OME (IQR 7.5 - 100; p<0.001; Figure 3). The average ratio of the quantity of OMEs predicted to be consumed to what was prescribed was 2.22 (95% CI 2.13 - 2.30; Table S4). This trend of prescribing opioids in excess of that consumed by 7 days was evident across most procedures (Figure 2B). Increasing quantities of opioids prescribed at discharge was associated with a linear increase in risk of opioid side effects (Figure 4A).\n\nAdditionally, there was a steep increase in risk of opioid-related side effects with increasing opioid consumption to approximately 50 OMEs, beyond which the risk of side effects was roughly triple that of <10 OMEs (Figure 4B). Consumption of opioids at follow-up increased linearly with the quantity of opioids prescribed at discharge (r = 0.57, p<0.001, Figure S1). After risk-adjustment, pain severity (β = 0.19, 95% CI 0.10 - 0.27, p<0.001), total amount of opioids prescribed (β = 0.33, 95% CI 0.31 - 0.34, p<0.001), and total amount of opioids consumed 24 hours prior to discharge (β = 0.07, 95% CI 0.04 - 0.1, p<0.001) were independently and positively associated with increased opioid consumption. This mean of the imputed models for the quantity of opioids consumed had a good fit with conditional R2 = 0.60 and the pooled model is summarised in Table S4.\n\nOverprescription was evident after appendicectomy, inguinal hernia surgery, cholecystectomy, sleeve gastrectomy, fundoplication, colorectal resections, hip arthroplasty, knee arthroplasty, hysterectomy, oophorectomy and salpingectomy, prostatectomy, and nephrectomy (p<0.05; Figure 2 and Table 4). However, 59 (1.4%) patients consumed more opioids than they were initially prescribed (e.g., sources other than the discharge prescription). The risk of overprescribing opioids increases linearly as larger quantities are prescribed at discharge, particularly over 100 OMEs (Figure 5A). Below 100 OMEs, the risk of overprescribing progressively reduces (Figure 5A). Similarly, consumption of less than 35 OMEs in the 24 hours prior to discharge was predictive of likely overprescription (Figure 5B). Risk of overprescription was present irrespective of varying pain levels after discharge (Figure 5C). These findings persisted in subgroup analyses where overprescription was defined as prescriptions more than 25%, 50%, and 100% more than what was consumed (Figure S2).\n\nGeographical variation\n\nOverall, 54.5% of patients from HIC as defined by OECD (n = 1923) were prescribed opioids, at a median quantity of 37.5 OME (IQR 0 - 112.5). This compared to only 12.5% of patients from LMIC (n = 2350) with a median quantity of 0 OME (IQR 0 to 0; p<0.001). Median consumption of opioids at 7 days was clinically similar (0 OME [IQR 0 - 0] in LMIC vs 0 OME [IQR 0 - 30] in HIC, p = 0.002). Notably there was significant variation in rates of opioid prescription by hospital centre, but after adjusting for patient factors, clear differences between LMIC and HIC centres were evident (Figure 8). These data are summarised in Table S5, S6 and Figure 7.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this multinational cohort study opioids were widely prescribed in excess of what patients consumed at 7 day follow up after discharge from common general, urological, gynaecological, and orthopaedic surgical procedures. Prescribing higher quantities of opioids after discharge from surgery was associated with a higher risk of experiencing opioid-related side effects. The quantity of opioids prescribed by clinicians at discharge was associated with increased opioid consumption even after adjusting for post-discharge pain severity and pre-discharge opioid consumption. Excess opioid prescribing was evident across a geographically diverse cohort, particularly in high income countries. These findings confirm that urgent improvements in prescribing practice are needed to mitigate the globally escalating opioid crisis.\n\nExcess opioid prescribing has been described across many surgical specialties.9–11, 21–25 Our data corroborate a vast literature predominantly originating from the USA, showing that excess volumes of opioids are prescribed at surgical discharge globally (frequently in excess of 100 OME).7, 10, 24–26 We found fewer than 50% of opioids prescribed are actually consumed within 7 days, findings similar to the results of a systematic review of USA studies, which found that only 29-58% of prescribed opioids were consumed post discharge.9 This demonstrates that opioid overprescribing at surgical discharge is more widespread than previously accepted. This work also highlights important inequities in global practice, with individuals from HIC being more likely to be prescribed opioids, at higher quantities, compared to patients from LMICs. As efforts are put in place to improve opioid stewardship globally, care must be taken to ensure equitable global prescribing practices at surgical discharge.27\n\nOverprescription poses a key risk for increased unregulated circulation of opioids in the community. Safe disposal of excess opioids is known to be low,28 and further evidenced by our findings that fewer than one-third of patients received documented advice about safe disposal of opioids. The retention of what is frequently 60% of an individual’s prescription quantity in the community significantly increases the risk of opioid misuse. Lipari et al have shown that peers and family remain a much more widespread source of opioids for non-medical use in the community than the black market or “doctor shopping” strategies.29 This highlights the responsibility that falls on clinicians to ensure appropriate prescription quantities.\n\nWhen prescribing opioids after surgery, clinical care standards emphasise a patient-centred approach limiting the duration of usual discharge opioid prescriptions to less than 7 days of short-acting opioids for acute pain,17, 30 and this is consistent with the most recent published international multidisciplinary consensus statement on the prevention of opioid-related harm in adult surgical patients.31 Providing large quantities of opioids for longer durations poses a substantially increased risk for chronic use, misuse, and overdose.15 The duration of the first opioid analgesic prescription has been found to be more strongly related to misuse in the early postoperative period than the dosage, with each refill and week of opioid analgesic prescription associated with 20% increase in opioid misuse among opioid-nailve patients.32 Ongoing pain management in the community beyond the first post discharge week should involve the transfer of care to primary healthcare professionals, who are well positioned to ensure appropriate review and to implement weaning plans as appropriate.17 Additionally, guideline-based strategies to optimise analgesia at surgical discharge should include using non-opioid analgesia as first-line and utilising multimodal analgesia.31, 33 Though we found paracetamol was co-prescribed with opioids in close to 90% of patients discharged with opioids, NSAIDs were co-prescribed in only 50%. Concerningly, 10% of patients not requiring opioids prior to discharge were discharged with opioid analgesia. As previously reported, this variability suggests prescribing practices remain dogmatic, habit-driven, and are in urgent need of reform.11, 34\n\nWe also show that a key driver of excess opioid prescribing and the subsequent harms are driven by prescriber choices. The quantity of opioids prescribed at discharge is associated with the quantity of opioids consumed, even after adjusting for pre-discharge opioid consumption and post-discharge pain levels. Numerous regional series have identified this trend,7, 35–37 and we verify the persistence of such trends in an international multi-specialty cohort. Our data demonstrate the risk of overprescription increases significantly beyond 100 OMEs, even when overprescription was defined as double the quantity of opioids that patients consumed. Our data offers a useful quantitative guide for prescribing. Firstly, as fewer than 50% of patients were prescribed opioids at discharge in this cohort, the decision to prescribe opioids at all should be individualised. Secondly, care should be taken prior to prescribing opioids in excess of the average consumed quantity for each respective procedure (as visualised in Figure 2). And finally, particular care should be taken when prescribing in excess of 100 OMEs, as the risk of overprescription increases significantly beyond this point.\n\nStrategies suggested to curtail the volume of opioid prescriptions at surgical discharge in the literature include defining patient needs using surveys, generating operation-specific guidelines, and statistical models to predict patient needs, all of which have been trialled without increases in opioid refills.26, 36, 38 It is widely accepted that opioid prescribing should be individualised, however reliably determining patient-needs remains challenging. In the setting of plastic surgery, Zhang et al proposed a predictive model for postoperative discharge opioid requirements based on inpatient opioid consumption trends, and whose accuracy is not influenced by age, gender identity, procedure type, length of stay, or preoperative opioid use.37 While this was derived from a small cohort of plastic surgery patients, such a data-driven approach seems a promising intervention to guide opioid prescribing. Building a predictive model for consumption that is generalisable to a diverse range of patients irrespective of geography and procedure is the focus of ongoing work with the OPERAS dataset.\n\nThis is a global, prospective, multi-specialty study assessing opioid prescriptions and patient-reported opioid consumption. We had high levels of data-completion and minimal loss to follow-up (<20%) for a study requiring telephone interviews of patients at such a scale. Nevertheless, there are several limitations to our study, including need for care interpreting causality owing to the observational nature of the data. In addition, elements of subjectivity and recall bias are inevitable with patient-reported data points, but are mitigated by the short, 7-day follow-up time point after discharge. Guidelines recommend no longer than a week’s supply of opioids should be prescribed after surgery,16, 17 to encourage patients with inadequately managed pain to seek help and to mitigate large opioid prescription volumes. Hence, our 7-day follow-up is both clinically and pragmatically optimal.15, 16 Further, we do not explore long-term clinical outcomes and dependence beyond patient-reported pain in the acute post-discharge setting.This data also amalgamates a geographically diverse cohort where opioid prescribing practices vary, but this is also a strength of the study that adds to the generalisability of the findings.\n\nOur findings have direct implications for clinical practice, highlighting the importance of appropriate post-discharge opioid prescribing to reduce opioid-related harm, such as excess diversion of unused opioids into the community, dependence, misuse, and overdose. As suggested by Howard et al, our multi-centre data can define “consumption norms” to generate procedure-specific guidelines for widespread use;7 these should then be disseminated through professional bodies such as ‘NPS MedicineWise’ to improve clinical practice. Targeting prescribing education and change interventions at early career prescribers, who frequently organise post-surgical discharges, will be pivotal.\n\nOpioid prescribing after surgery is a global issue, with significant implications for patients. We prescribe nearly double the quantity of opioids patients consume in the post-discharge period, exposing them to opioid-related harm. Individualised opioid prescribing at discharge remains important; however, the quantities currently provided are in excess of patient needs and are driving increased consumption of opioids. While patient pain levels, and pre-discharge opioid consumption influence opioid consumption at discharge, the quantity of opioids prescribed remains a modifiable factor to curtailing excessive prescriptions of unused opioids."
