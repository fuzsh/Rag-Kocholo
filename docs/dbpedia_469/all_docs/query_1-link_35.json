        "text": "In the present study an attempt is made to see whether urban and rural secondary school students differ in their multiple intelligences. A total sample of 400 students (220 boys and 180 girls) studying in standard 9 and 10 from eight Gujarati medium secondary schools of urban and rural areas of North Gujarat was randomly selected. A Multiple Intelligences Assessment Scale (MIAS) constructed by the researcher to assess the student's multiple intelligences was used for data collection. 't' test was applied to see the differences between urban and rural students. Results revealed that secondary school students found to have higher level of interpersonal intelligence. Rural secondary school students were found better than that of the urban students in their linguistic and naturalist intelligence. Urban secondary school students were found better than that of the rural students in their interpersonal intelligence. Further, no difference was found between urban and rural secondary school students in their logical-mathematical, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, musical and intrapersonal intelligence. The study has implications for teachers and parents as well.\n\nStudents various characteristics need to be identified and facilitated at the first year in junior high school to determine their learning preferences and difficulties. This study aims to investigate: (i) students characteristics based on their multiple intelligences (MI) tendency; (ii) gender differences on their MI tendency. The study was held on twenty-seven students of grade seven (eight males and 19 females) at SMP Negeri 4 Randangan Satu Atap in 2021-2022 academic year by using one-shot descriptive survey method. The MI inventory result showed that interpersonal intelligence was strongly developed and the other seven intelligence were developed. Demographic background was contributing to the dominance of the three intelligences (interpersonal, naturalist, and verbal linguistics) as these three types of intelligence become the foundation of how these students who come from families of farmers, fishermen, and small traders living in rural area solve problems and produce works to...\n\nThe present study attempts to investigate the relationship between the multiple intelligences and the academic performance achievement levels of high school students based on Gardner’s multiple intelligences theory. This was a descriptive correlation study. To accomplish this purpose, 270 students of high school of Bandar Abbas selected by clustering random sampling, and all of them filled the Gardner’s multiple intelligences questionnaire. For analysis of collected data, descriptive statistics including Mean, Standard Deviation, Pearson coefficient correlation and regression were used. Findings of this study revealed that moderate inter-correlation exists between verbal-linguistic and visual-spatial intelligences and academic performance achievement (p&lt;05). Multiple intelligences such as logical-mathematical, visual-spatial, verbal-linguistic, intrapersonal, bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal and naturalistic have a significant positive relationship with academic performance achi...\n\nThis study aimed to recognize the differences in multiple intelligences among the students of Jordan University of Science and Technology with its relationship to gender, academic year, and achievement. The study sample consisted of 349 male and female participants. It used a descriptive analysis, the MacKenzie scale for multiple intelligences, which consisted of 9 dimensions and 10 paragraphs per dimension. According to its findings, the average range for all domains of multiple intelligences was 3.70. This value implied that the average students’ responses were accepted. It showed there was not any statistically significant differences at ∝≥0.05 in the students’ results which could be attributed to gender and academic year. Also, there were not statistically significant differences at ∝≥0.05 in the students’ results for the musical and existential dimension attributed to achievement and there were statistically significant differences for the other dimensions.\n\nThis study was conducted to identify the significant differences between female students and male students who took the workshop&#39;s practical subjects. Therefore, three objectives of the study are to identify the multiple intelligences among students, the dominant of multiple intelligence in the workshop&#39;s practical subjects and to identify the significant differences between multiple intelligences and the gender of the 4th year student from School of Education, Faculty of Social Science and Humanities, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia in the subject practical workshop. The design of this study is a descriptive study using quantitative data. In this study, the population identified consists of 204 4th year students of the School of Education, Faculty of Social Science and Humanities who attended the Bachelor of Technology with Education in Mechanical Engineering (SPPJ), Buildings (SPPQ), Electrical and Electronic (SPPR) and Living Skills (SPPH). A total of 180 samples were ident...\n\nThis study aimed to identify the kinds of multiple intelligence common among the College of Education students at Dammam University. The study sample consisted of (201) students specialized in Mathematics, Physics ,Computer Science, English and Kindergarten and the preparatory year of scientific and literary streams. Mackenzie Inventory for Multiple Intelligence (Mackenzie, 1999) was used, after confirming its validity and reliability. The study results indicated an acceptable ratio of multiple intelligence communality among the students of the College of Education at Jubail/University of Dammam regarding the communality of multiple intelligence among them. The most common kind of intelligence was intrapersonal intelligence, while the least common was musical intelligence. The communality level ratio of mathematical-logical intelligence, visual intelligence, linguistic intelligence, interpersonal intelligence (social) and bodily-kinesthetic intelligence were approximate. There was a significant difference attributed to interaction among students' multiple intelligence, specialization, scholastic year and Grade Point Average (GPA).\n\nThe aim of this research is to investigate the ability of multiple intelligence (MI) of male and female students from primary school. The total sample was 71 students consisting of 35 experimental group students and 36 in the control group in a primary school in Cilegon City, 2016-2017 academic year. In this study, the experimental group consisted of male students using learning with the MI and the control group consisted of female students using learning with the MI approach. Analysis of data obtained from this study, using the Independent Sample t-test and Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient. The findings of this study indicate that there is a statistically significant difference between the ability of MI in the experimental group and the control group, where the average score experimental group is higher. These results can be seen in the average score of MI ability in the experimental group is higher in visual-spatial, music, logical-mathematical, interpersonal and bod...\n\nTeacher’s intellectual abilities may act as a force multiplier in student’s learning and understanding and lead to the subsequent progress of their academic voyage. Performance of the individual as a person, citizen, as worker and as a student largely depends upon the intelligence he/she possesses. An intelligent person has the ability to adjust himself to the changing circumstances with ease, efficiency and speed. This study aimed to identify the types of multiple intelligences among secondary level students from Kailali, Nepal in light of Gardner&#39;s theory. To achieve this aim, the Multiple Intelligences Test (MIT) was administered on a study sample consisting of (300) students from four (two public and two private) schools. The results of the study showed that the naturalistic intelligence ranked first, while the linguistic intelligence came last, and that there were statistically significant differences on the bodily-kinesthetic intelligence and spatial-visual intelligence, w..."
