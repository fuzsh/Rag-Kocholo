Beasley Broadcast this afternoon changed the FM simulcast station for its WGAC 580 AM news and talk programming.

The programming moved at 3 p.m. from 93.1 FM to 95.1 FM to take advantage of the stronger signal strength.

"So many people who enjoy the news/talk format are die-hard FM listeners and never think to sample the AM band. The strong reach of this 95.1 FM dial position allows us to broaden our audience," said Kent Dunn, Beasley Broadcast Augusta's vice president and market manager.

The rock music format of 95.1 FM moved to the 93.1 FM station, the company said.

Beasley Broadcast Augusta operates two AM and six FM stations.
