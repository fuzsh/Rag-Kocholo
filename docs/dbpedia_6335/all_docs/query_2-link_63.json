        "meta_description": "WGAC is the No. 1-rated radio station in Augusta. It has weathered the transition in American radio from local stations with local programming to corporately owned stations that feature syndicated programming, and it has been able to do so without giving up its local character. As a news-talk radio station today, WGAC is the first place most Augustans go to find out what is happening nationally and locally, and its morning drive-time and afternoon drive-time show hosts and news personnel are some of the most beloved and respected media figures in Augusta. This book will trace the history of this community landmark from its infancy to its status today as a community institution. It will highlight the people who have created the programming for which WGAC is known and also the people like James Brown who have used the station to launch important careers. The book will also discuss Fuqua's broadcasting technology innovations such as advances in acoustics engineering and early television technology. The history will also cover the station's decades-long support of the Master's Golf Tournament, which has led to it becoming the official radio station of the Master's.",
