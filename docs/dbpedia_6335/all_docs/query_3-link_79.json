        "text": "The Red Sox are in the thick of the American League Wild Card race, so Zolak and Bertrand wonder if we should be expecting more from a team that has rallied around an underdog mentality all year long:\n\nBeetle: Are the Red Sox now in a position where you say if they don’t make the playoffs, they’re half a game out behind the Royals, it’s very disappointing. That it’s now reaching a stage, even with their difficult schedule that is ahead of them, That you’ll be left disappointed if they don’t make it onto the right side of that line?\n\nZolak: I would say yes now. Based on how they have played, if you want to date it to back what mid-May, mid, June, whatever, you see how they played against the Yankees. You see how they played against better teams like they’re in these games. Like they they’re in those games. Like you’re there. So I would say, yeah, it would be disappointing. Now, if you’re beating the scrubs, and get your *** kicked by the good team, I would say no, it’s not disappointing because that’s reality. The reality is, is they’re there and they got a hell of a manager. And maybe he could get you a game or two, and maybe if you could get into that damn series. You’d be a tough out.\n\nMilliken: They have the best OPS in baseball right now. Pete Fatse, what he did, changing the hitting meetings back in May. David Hamilton, what you’re seeing out of him the last couple of days come back to life after they gave him, gave him a three day breather. Masataka Yoshida. Are you kidding me? Almost a .900 OPS going back to July 1st. Dom Smith over .800 OPS. Going back to June. You’ve just gotta sit there and tip your cap. Pete Fatse deserves a lot of credit. The hitting has been way above I think what anybody expected this year.\n\nBeetle: So I guess the real question is when does this team go from being a good story, and that underdog that’s overachieving to a team that’s worthy of expectations?\n\nT-Bone: How about after a win tonight?\n\nMilliken: You sweep the Royals. That’s pretty serious. That’s the team right in front of you.\n\nMcKone: Shouldn’t there already be expectations? Like you did buy at the deadline, you did invest in the team. I know they didn’t go out and have a blockbuster trade deadline, but you also didn’t sell off parts like you did. Add to the roster, so there should be some expectations when it comes to the Red Sox.\n\nLISTEN: Should we have higher expectations for the Red Sox now?\n\nTom Morgan is the executive producer of the award-winning Zolak & Bertrand show.
