        "text": "Adds Clements: \"The next item is training. I strongly recommend training similar to that you receive at events such as ASRW (Automotive Service and Repair Week). You cannot beat good live training. This live training should be supplemented with local and regional live training, trade magazines such as Motor Age and Webinars. We now have a dedicated room with DLP, screen and phone system for Webinars. It is a great way to supplement training.\"\n\nFor customer retention, C&C uses video cameras around the shop so drivers can view the work being performed on their vehicles. The company also hands out CDs to customers containing photos of major repairs.\n\nA big screen television with AutoNet TV also helps educate and entertain customers, according to Clements, who is himself is an ASE certified Master Tech and a member of the Augusta Chamber of Commerce and Better Business Bureau, as well as serving on the advisory board of the Augusta Technical College.\n\nReaching out to community is a crucial aspect of C&C's operations, says Clements. \"We have a Car Care Day in the spring time which includes an Antique Car Show, Blood Donation Bus, Seat Belt Safety Van, Vendor Booths, a large kids' jumping balloon, food fun and prizes. We normally go through several hundred hamburgers and hotdogs at each event.\"\n\nThis Car Care Day is one of many examples of community outreach that helps Clements' shop check the pulse of the area in which his business thrives.\n\nAnd the business still focuses on family, an extension that Clements says goes out to all team members. His father and mother still occasionally work with the company, along with his sister, daughter and niece.\n\nClements mentions one more lesson imparted by his father: \"Don't be afraid to invest money in your business. It is what makes life exciting. Do the research, call your friends, do the math. But when that is done and you feel good about it, Go For It.\n\nHe adds: \"I see many people invest their life savings in a company that they have very little or no control over. Why not invest in your own company? At least you are able to look at the person in the mirror each morning that has control of your money.\"\n\nClements' contributions to this industry go beyond fixing cars, however. He has established himself as a speaker and an advocate for vehicle maintenance. He hosts a Saturday morning talk show each week from 8 to 9 a.m. on WGAC/580 NewsTalk Radio in Augusta, and 93.1 WGAC-FM Warrenton, Ga. His show can be accessed online at www.wgac.com.\n\nSome of his accolades have included the Carl J. Montgomery Memorial Award for professionalism and dedication in the auto repair industry, along with being named the NAPA/ASE Technician of the Year finalist from the Atlanta region each year from 1995 to 2005."
