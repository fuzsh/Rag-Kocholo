        "text": "“After an incredible 31 years of playing country music on your radio in Boston,” Kruse continued, “I am hanging up my headphones. \"\n\nKruse, who is known at the station as “Kruser,” told listeners that leaving was “not an easy decision,” but she needs to be with her family and “try new things.“ The host described her time on the show as “big and loud and filled with dreams that come true.”\n\n“Thank you for all the years, tears, cheers, and beers,” Kruse said. “I’m ready to write a new song. I’m not sad. I’m excited for a new melody and lyrics to write.”\n\nKruse said she will not be “going out with a whimper” but instead “with a bang” — a retirement party called “Kruser’s Last Call.” The radio station will host the send-off on Aug. 20 at the Six String Grille & Stage in Foxborough.\n\n“We are looking forward to honoring Kruser for all of her hard work, dedication and unwavering support of both local and national country artists,” the station said on its website. “She is a big part of Country 102.5 and we want to celebrate her to the fullest at ‘Kruser’s Last Call.’”\n\nThe departure was first reported by the Boston Herald.\n\nThe announcement on X had 37,000 views as of Sunday evening.\n\n“Kruser you are the G.O.A.T. Boston Country radio won’t be the same without you!” one user said.\n\n“This is crazy,” another user said. “It’s hard to imagine country radio without you.”\n\nThe station is owned by Beasley Media Group, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday evening. Country 102.5 had not announced a new host as of Sunday evening.\n\nKruse hosted the segment “Kruser’s Local Catch” each week on the station, which would feature “New England’s homegrown country music talent,” called the “Catch of the Week.”\n\nRecent artists named “Local Catch Of The Week” on Kruse’s segment included Samantha Rae from Kingston, N.H., and Jake Swamp and the Pine from Sudbury.\n\nIn her 31 years at the station, Kruse interviewed many country music stars, including Tim McGraw. In May, McGraw’s show at TD Garden was moved to accommodate the Bruins’ schedule after the team secured a win to advance in the Stanley Cup playoffs.\n\nMcGraw told Kruse on-air that he believed it was the first time one of his shows had been moved for a sports event.\n\n“Boston, I mean it’s such a great town,” McGraw said in a May 7 interview. “It’s a great sports town, it’s a great town for country music too. We always have a great time every time we come.”\n\nKruse also talked to Kenny Chesney in an interview that “hit a little differently,” she wrote in a description on the station’s website.\n\n“There’s been a very few times that you didn’t play Foxborough over these nearly 20 years, Kenny, and our hearts hurt when you’re not here because there’s so much joy and a sense of unity at a Kenny Chesney show, and that is something we need more than ever,” Kruse said to Chesney in a March 22 interview.\n\n“We all have our differences, but I feel that when I am on stage at Gillette in Foxborough that it’s a safe place from all the differences,” Chesney replied. “You used the word unity, and that’s what our audience has become, especially there ... it’s been a huge part of my music.”\n\nKruse has also talked to Luke Combs, Dan + Shay, and George Birge in her tenure on the show."
