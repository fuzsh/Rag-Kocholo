The strong reach of this 95.1 FM dial position allows us to broaden our audience,\" said Kent Dunn, Beasley Broadcast Augusta's vice president and market manager.\n\nThe rock music format of 95.1 FM moved to the 93.1 FM station, the company said.\n\nBeasley Broadcast Augusta operates two AM and six FM stations."
