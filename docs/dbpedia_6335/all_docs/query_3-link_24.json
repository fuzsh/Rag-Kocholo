        "text": "- Renamed in 2012 the \"Frances Preston Trailblazer Award\" in Honor of Esteemed MIW-\n\nBOSTON, MA (August 15, 2012) - The Mentoring and Inspiring Women in Radio (MIW) Group is pleased to announce Beasley Broadcast Group's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Caroline Beasley has been named the recipient of the 4th annual MIW Radio Group Trailblazer Award, renamed in 2012 the \"Frances Preston Trailblazer Award.\" Ms. Beasley will be recognized on stage on Wednesday, September 19th during the Opening Remarks and Welcome Keynote session at the 2012 Radio Show in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe Trailblazer Award is presented each year to a woman who has \"blazed new trails\" for women in the radio industry. It is being renamed in 2012 the \"Frances Preston Trailblazer Award\" in honor BMI's longtime president and CEO. Not only was Frances Preston one of the earliest members of the MIW Radio Group, through her support BMI became- and remains today - an advocate of the group's mentoring efforts. Frances founded BMI's Nashville office, was the first female executive in the country music industry and rose through the ranks to become the New York-based BMI president for 18 years before retiring in 2004. Frances Preston passed June 13th, 2012 at the age of 83.\n\n\"Caroline Beasley's outstanding leadership and commitment to the radio broadcasting industry and Beasley Broadcast Group made her the perfect choice to receive this coveted honor,\" said MIW Radio Group Spokesperson and Greater Media Vice President of Corporate Communication Heidi Raphael.\n\nWith a respect for tradition and an extraordinary talent for business and finance, Caroline Beasley has played a major role in shaping the company founded in 1961 by her father, Chairman and CEO George G. Beasley. Today Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc. owns and operates 43 stations (27 FM and 16 AM) located in eleven large- and mid-size markets in the United States. Entering the family business in 1983, Caroline held various finance positions at both the station and corporate level prior to being named vice president and chief financial officer in 1994. In 2005, she was promoted to executive vice president and in this expanded role oversees all corporate finance activities, including financial analysis related to the company's acquisitions, divestitures and swaps of radio stations, as well as the company's credit and investment banking relationships.\n\nA member of the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) Board of Directors since 2005, Caroline is the Immediate Past Chairman of the Radio Board, has served as the Radio Board's 1st and 2nd Vice-Chairman and continues today to serve the NAB's Executive Committee. Additionally, Caroline is a trustee of the National Association of Broadcasters Political Action Committee. Honored by Radio INK magazine as one of the \"40 Most Powerful People in Radio\" in 2011 and 2012, Caroline has also been recognized in the magazine's \"Most Influential Women in Radio\" listing every year since 2003."
