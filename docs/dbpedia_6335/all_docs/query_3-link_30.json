        "text": "The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.\n\nThe scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.\n\nValue Score A Growth Score A Momentum Score A VGM Score A\n\nWithin each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.\n\nAs an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.\n\nZacks Style Scores Education - Learn more about the Zacks Style Scores\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.\n\nAn industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.\n\nThe industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.\n\nZacks Rank Education -- Learn more about the Zacks Rank\n\nZacks Industry Rank Education -- Learn more about the Zacks Industry Rank\n\nThe Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.\n\nThe ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock.
