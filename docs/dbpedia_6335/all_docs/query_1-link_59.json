        "text": "Augusta Golf Show: Jerry West\n\nWe learned earlier today that Jerry West passed away.\n\nMy earliest memory of Jerry West\n\nHe was there in the early 70’s when I first discovered sports. The first NBA players I ever remember hearing of were, Wilt Chamberlain, because he played in the city in which I was born. Just about any member of the Boston Celtics, and then Jerry West. And I heard about him because his Lakers always seemed to be playing the Celtics for the NBA championship…and they never won. And despite not winning, West was once named the MVP of the finals…imagine that today. Have you seen the logo for the NBA? It’s him! It’s his silhouette.\n\nHe retired, stayed in the game in management roles…for various teams at various times, but he always was, until the day he died, a Laker.\n\nHe loved golf. He was good at it. Really good at it. For a time in his life, would play many times a week.\n\nHow I got Jerry West on the golf show\n\nSeven years ago, Lisa and I spent a few days at the Greenbrier in West Virginia. Our first time in West Virginia. Jerry was from West Virginia, Cabin Creek, West Virginia. At the Greenbrier, the steakhouse at the resort is named “Prime 44 West”. His name and number. We ate there a couple of times.\n\nAfter that visit to the Greenbrier, I reached out to a gentleman I had met there, and asked if there was a way that Jerry would say yes to coming on my golf show. The gentleman said he would ask, and the next thing I know, we’re set. Jerry was going to call from LA, and he was looking forward to the conversation. My friend said that it was rare that a “non-basketball” request came his way, and that he was ready to talk some golf.\n\nOne late golf connection in his life, his son married Michelle Wie…and a couple of years ago, gave Jerry another grandchild.\n\nAnd we did. Below is the link to the conversation I had with Jerry West back in 2017. I hope you enjoy it. Rest in Peace, Jerry West. Thank you for all of the childhood memories."
