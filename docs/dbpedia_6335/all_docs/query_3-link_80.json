        "text": "About Us\n\nThe story of Beasley Media Group is a great example of the American dream.\n\nBeasley Media Group (BMG), LLC, a subsidiary of Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc., is a multiplatform media company providing advertising and digital marketing solutions across the United States. The company owns 59 radio properties located in large and medium markets across the country, as well as offers capabilities in audio technology, esports, podcasting, ecommerce and events. BMGâs platforms reach more than 30 million consumers on a weekly basis.\n\nOur Company was founded back in 1961 when the late George G. Beasley, at the time a high school principal, was awarded an FCC license to build his first radio station, WPYB-AM, a daytime-only 500-watt signal, in Benson, North Carolina. Mr. Beasley was part of a small group of broadcasting pioneers who were introducing radio to smaller cities and towns throughout the country, a technology previously unavailable outside larger cities .Like many first-time FCC licensees, he turned his budding interest in radio into a full-time calling. Mr. Beasley soon sold his first station at a profit, reinvesting the proceeds into the purchase of WFMC-AM in nearby Goldsboro, North Carolina, which brought both a more powerful signal and the attraction of a larger market.\n\nLearn More"
