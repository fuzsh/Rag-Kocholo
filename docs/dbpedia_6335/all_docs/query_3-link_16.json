        "meta_description": "Initiating coverage. We are initiating coverage with an Outperform rating on the shares of Beasley Media Group (BBGI) and establishing at a $3.00 price target. We believe that Beasley should benefit from an advertising recovery in 2022 and from the influx of Political advertising. More importantly, the company plans to invest in the growth of its Digital businesses, which should accelerate revenue growth and drive long-term margin expansion.  Revenue rebound expected. Revenues in 2022 should benefit from an advertising recovery, influx of Political advertising, improved Auto advertising following chain supply issues in 2021, strong Digital revenues, and improving trends in its esports segment. We conservatively estimate that the company will not completely recover core Radio revenues to 2019 levels, which offers revenue upside potential. We anticipate that total company revenues will increase a solid 12%, on the heels of 16% growth expected in 2021.  Margins likely to be constrained in 2022. Operating margins are expected to be constrained in 2022 due to the investment spending in its Digital businesses, but total operating cash flow is expected to increase over 2021 levels. We expect that full impact of the Digital investments will be achieved in 2024, when margins are expected to significantly expand.  Significant cash on the balance sheet. While leverage is relatively high, the company generates free cash flow to service its debt. As of September 30, 2021, there was a significant cash hoard of $48 million. We believe that the company will pursue Digital acquisitions to accelerate its transformation toward a growth oriented Digital media company.  Compelling stock valuation. Near current levels, the BBGI shares trade at 9.6 times Enterprise Value to our estimated 2022 adj. EBITDA estimate of $32.5 million. In our view, the shares do not reflect the anticipated favorable transformation of the company's revenue mix or its cash flow growth potential over the next few years. We believe that looking ahead to 2024 provides a better perspective on the value of the stock, given that margins will likely be compressed in the near term due to the company's digital investments. Our target EV/2024 EBITDA multiple is 7.2 times. This is conservatively at the bottom of historic average trading ranges for the stock.",
