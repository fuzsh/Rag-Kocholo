        "text": "If you receive government assistance for things like food stamps or other aid, you’re now eligible for Walmart’s newest membership program.\n\nThe company just rolled out Walmart+ Assist Thursday. The program offers all the benefits of a Walmart+ membership, but at half the price for customers receiving government assistance.\n\nInstead of paying $12.95 a month or $98 a year for a regular Walmart+ membership, Walmart+Assist customers will be charged $6.47 a month, or $49 a year.\n\n“Walmart+Assist was designed to do exactly what’s in the name: assist those who need it most. We’re making it easier and more accessible for government-assisted customers to become members and take advantage of the full suite of savings Walmart+ has to offer them,” the company said in a statement.\n\nWalmart+Assist members will get free shipping for online purchases, free grocery delivery, fuel discounts and free video streaming with Paramount+. To learn more about the program and to see if you qualify, go to walmart.com. They even offer a free 30-day trial.\n\nRecently, Walmart held a special promotion in May, offering free annual memberships for up to 20,000 new mothers who had given birth that month.\n\nMary Liz is the News Director and Co-Host of Augusta’s Morning News on WGAC.
