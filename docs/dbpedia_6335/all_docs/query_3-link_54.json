        "text": "Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc. ( ) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nGenerally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.\n\nWhat Is Beasley Broadcast Group's Net Debt?\n\nAs you can see below, Beasley Broadcast Group had US$283.6m of debt, at September 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$29.7m, its net debt is less, at about US$253.9m.\n\nA Look At Beasley Broadcast Group's Liabilities\n\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that Beasley Broadcast Group had liabilities of US$48.3m due within a year, and liabilities of US$403.6m falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$29.7m in cash and US$47.7m in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$374.6m.\n\nThe deficiency here weighs heavily on the US$20.7m company itself, as if a child were struggling under the weight of an enormous back-pack full of books, his sports gear, and a trumpet. So we definitely think shareholders need to watch this one closely. After all, Beasley Broadcast Group would likely require a major re-capitalisation if it had to pay its creditors today.\n\nWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).\n\nWeak interest cover of 0.63 times and a disturbingly high net debt to EBITDA ratio of 9.9 hit our confidence in Beasley Broadcast Group like a one-two punch to the gut. The debt burden here is substantial. On a slightly more positive note, Beasley Broadcast Group grew its EBIT at 16% over the last year, further increasing its ability to manage debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Beasley Broadcast Group can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free .\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Beasley Broadcast Group burned a lot of cash. While investors are no doubt expecting a reversal of that situation in due course, it clearly does mean its use of debt is more risky.\n\nOur View\n\nTo be frank both Beasley Broadcast Group's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow and its track record of staying on top of its total liabilities make us rather uncomfortable with its debt levels. But at least it's pretty decent at growing its EBIT; that's encouraging. After considering the datapoints discussed, we think Beasley Broadcast Group has too much debt. That sort of riskiness is ok for some, but it certainly doesn't float our boat. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. To that end, you should learn about the .\n\nOf course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover , today."
