        "text": "American radio broadcasting company\n\nThis article is about the company formerly known as Entercom. For its Internet radio service, see Audacy.\n\nAudacy, Inc. is an American broadcasting company based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1968 as Entercom Communications Corp., it is the second largest radio company in the United States, owning over 220 radio stations across 47 media markets.[3]\n\nIn November 2017, the company merged with CBS Radio. The transaction was structured as an exchange offer whereby owners of CBS Corporation common shares (i.e., not the multiple-voting shares held by CBS Corp parent company National Amusements) at the time of the merger could elect to exchange their shares for Entercom shares corresponding to a 72% stake in the combined company.[4][5] The company changed its name from Entercom to Audacy on March 30, 2021. On April 9th, the ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange changed from \"ETM\" to \"ADU\".[6]\n\nOn January 7, 2024, Audacy announced that it had filed for a prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy, citing approximately $1.9 billion in debt.[7]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nJoseph M. Field founded the company as Entertainment Communications (which would later be shortened to Entercom) on October 21, 1968, on the conviction that FM broadcasting, then in its infancy, would eventually surpass AM broadcasting as the leading radio broadcast band.[8]\n\nAcquisitions\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 1990s, the Federal Communications Commission's regulations on the ownership of multiple radio stations were eased, beginning with the introduction of duopoly rules, which allowed a company to own two stations in each radio market. Entercom took advantage of the change to expand its presence in the markets where it already operated. In April 1995, the company paid $24.5 million for three stations in Portland, Oregon, acquiring KGON, a classic rock station; KFXX, an all-sports station; and KMUZ-FM, a modern rock station.[8][9]\n\nIn January 1999, Entercom went public in an IPO in which it raised around $236 million.[8] In July 1999, the company purchased 43 radio stations from Sinclair Broadcast Group for $821.5 million in cash.[10] It was Entercom's largest deal to date.[11] The deal included stations in eight markets, Kansas City, Missouri; Milwaukee; New Orleans; Memphis, Tennessee; Buffalo, New York; Norfolk, Virginia; and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The deal more than doubled both the number of stations under the company's control, and the number of markets in which it had stations. The acquisition made Entercom the fifth-largest radio broadcaster in the United States, with 88 stations in 17 markets.[11][12] That year, Entercom announced that it would direct its radio stations not to play songs that promoted violence.[13][14]\n\nOn August 21, 2006, Entercom agreed to buy 15 mid-market stations from CBS Radio. Locations included Austin, Texas; Cincinnati; Memphis, Tennessee; and Rochester, New York.[15] Due to ownership limitations set by the FCC, Entercom had to sell three of its stations in the Rochester market; these were acquired by Stephens Media Group.[16] Shortly after the transaction, the company exited the Cincinnati market by trading all four of its stations in Cincinnati and three of its stations in Seattle in exchange for three stations in San Francisco in a deal with Bonneville International.[17]\n\nOn December 8, 2014, Entercom announced its acquisition of Lincoln Financial Media for $105 million; the deal gave the company 14 additional stations in Atlanta; Denver; Miami; and San Diego. To comply with FCC ownership limits in the Denver market and DOJ antitrust concerns, Entercom entered into an exchange agreement with Bonneville under which Entercom exchanged four stations in Denver for classic rock station KSWD in Los Angeles and $5 million in additional consideration. The stations Entercom exchanged with Bonneville were KOSI-FM, KYGO-FM, KKFN-FM and KEPN-AM. Entercom previously owned KOSI-FM, while the remaining stations were acquired through the acquisition of LFM.\n\nEntercom and Bonneville began operating the exchanged stations under time brokerage agreement (TBAs) once the LFM transaction was completed.[18][19] In November 2015, the swap deal was closed successfully.[20]\n\nIn October 2016, Entercom announced that it would acquire four radio stations in Charlotte, North Carolina, from Beasley Broadcast Group for $24 million in cash. The deal closed in January 2017 and WBT AM/FM, WLNK-FM and WFNZ-AM joined Entercom.[21]\n\nOn August 3, 2017, Entercom announced the purchase of a 45% stake in Cadence13 (formerly DGital Media),[22] a startup that handled ad sales and distribution for podcasts, including Pod Save America, Recode Decode and The Tony Kornheiser Show.[23]\n\nOn February 13, 2019, Entercom announced that it would trade its Indianapolis cluster (WNTR, WXNT, and WZPL) to Cumulus Media for WNSH (now WXBK) in New York City, WMAS-FM in Enfield, Connecticut, and WHLL in Springfield, Massachusetts. Both companies began operating their newly acquired stations via LMA on March 1;[24] the swap was completed on May 13, 2019.[25]\n\nIn March 2021, Entercom acquired podcast ad network Podcorn in a deal valued at $22.5 million.[26] The company also reached a long-term licensing agreement with Global Music Rights (GMR), allowing the company to perform all of the songs from songwriters and publishers represented by the performance rights organization.[27]\n\nLegal issues\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2006, Entercom was investigated for payola and fined $4.45 million by the FCC.[12][28][29][30] Then New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer also brought suit in the New York Supreme Court, before judge Ira Gammerman, which settled.[31][32]\n\nIn 2007, Entercom station KDND was sued after a participant in a \"Hold Your Wee For a Wii\" contest held by the station's morning show died of water intoxication.[33]\n\nMerger with CBS Radio\n\n[edit]\n\nOn February 2, 2017, Entercom announced that it had agreed to merge with CBS Radio. The purchase will give Entercom operations in 23 of the top 25 markets, and make it the second-largest owner of radio stations in the US, behind iHeartMedia. Under the terms of the Reverse Morris Trust, the company would retain the Entercom name, board of directors and base of operations, but CBS shareholders would hold 72% of its stock.[34] The company also shut down KDND in Sacramento and returned its license to the FCC, with its programming moved to sister station KUDL. The FCC had designated that the renewal of KDND's license would be subject to a hearing over allegations it had failed to operate in the public interest.[33]\n\nOn September 26, 2017, KSOQ-FM, WGGI and KSWD were sold to the Educational Media Foundation.[35] KSWD and WGGI affiliated with the EMF's K-Love Christian music network, and KSOQ with its Air1 network.[36]\n\nTo comply with federal ownership caps, Entercom stated that it would divest at least 15 stations.[34] On November 1, 2017, Entercom announced a settlement with the Department of Justice, which allowed the merger with CBS Radio.[37] The company also announced a series of asset exchange agreements with iHeartMedia and Beasley Broadcast Group in Boston, Seattle, Richmond and Chattanooga; and local marketing agreements with Bonneville International Corporation in San Francisco and Sacramento.[38]\n\nStations divested to iHeartMedia Location Owner Station Format Boston CBS Radio WBZ (AM) News Boston CBS Radio WZLX Classic Rock Boston Entercom WKAF Urban Adult Contemporary Boston Entercom WRKO News/Talk Seattle CBS Radio KFNQ Sports Seattle CBS Radio KJAQ Adult Hits Seattle CBS Radio KZOK-FM Classic Rock\n\niHeartMedia stations acquired by Entercom Location Station Format Chattanooga WLND Adult Hits Chattanooga WKXJ Top 40 Chattanooga WRXR-FM Active Rock Chattanooga WUSY Country Richmond WBTJ Urban Richmond WRNL Sports Richmond WRVA News/Talk Richmond WRVQ Top 40 Richmond WRXL Alternative Rock Richmond WTVR-FM Adult Contemporary\n\nStations divested to Beasley Location Owner Station Format Boston CBS Radio WBZ-FM Sports\n\nBeasley stations acquired by Entercom Location Station Format Boston WMJX Adult Contemporary\n\nStations operated by, and later sold to, Bonneville Location Owner Station Format San Francisco CBS Radio KMVQ-FM Top 40 San Francisco Entercom KBLX-FM Urban Adult Contemporary San Francisco Entercom KOIT Adult Contemporary San Francisco Entercom KUFX Classic Rock Sacramento CBS Radio KHTK Sports Sacramento CBS Radio KNCI Country Sacramento CBS Radio KYMX Adult Contemporary Sacramento CBS Radio KZZO Hot Adult Contemporary\n\n[39][37]\n\nOn November 9, 2017, the FCC gave the final approval needed for the Entercom merger by granting two 6-month waivers for market station limits in Miami and San Francisco.[40] The merger occurred at midnight on November 17, 2017.[41] Later that day, Entercom would switch WBMP in New York to alternative.[42] This would then be followed up by WJMK in Chicago's switch to classic hip-hop and KVIL in Dallas-Ft. Worth's flip to alternative.[43] The company also introduced a new corporate logo as well as other corporate strategy changes.[44] The Entercom Divestiture Trust then entered into agreements with Bonneville International to operate its stations on their behalf.[39]\n\nShortly afterward, the company announced renewed radio broadcasting partnerships with the Minnesota Twins and Philadelphia Eagles.[45][46] The company also has partnerships with additional professional teams including the New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox, Dallas Cowboys and Detroit Red Wings.[47]\n\nOn July 19, 2018, Entercom announced that it would acquire Philadelphia market-leader WBEB from Jerry Lee Radio for $57.5 million. WXTU was divested back to its previous owner, Beasley Broadcast Group, to comply with ownership limits.[48][49]\n\nOn August 3, 2018, Entercom announced that Bonneville would buy all eight stations for $141 million, which the company had been operating under LMA since after the merger with CBS Radio.[50] The deal was completed on September 21, 2018.\n\nRadio.com\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 25, 2018, Entercom announced that Radio.com would become the exclusive streaming portal for all of its stations, beginning with its legacy stations on July 6, and former CBS Radio stations beginning August 1, ending its relationship with the third-party service TuneIn. All Entercom properties were also branded on-air as \"A Radio.com station\".[51]\n\nFollowing the termination of its deal with United States Traffic Network, Entercom launched an internal Traffic Weather and Information Network (TWIN) in August 2018.[52]\n\nIn February 2019 Radio.com Sports was created, featuring appearances from experts on Entercom sports stations across the country. Mercedes-Benz was the first sponsor to sign on as a brand partner.[53]\n\nOn August 19, 2019, Entercom launched the Radio.com Sports Digital Network, a collection of daily live audio and video programming from the company’s sports stations.[54] Later that month, Paul Suchman became the company’s Chief Marketing Officer.[55]\n\nIn September 2019, Entercom partnered with Apple to integrate its news, sports and music stations into the Apple iOS13 software[56] and soon after, the company expanded RADIO.COM’s accessibility onto Samsung’s Bixby marketplace.[57]\n\nRadio.com was relaunched as the Audacy app and website as part of the company’s 2021 rebrand.[58]\n\nDevelopments\n\n[edit]\n\nIn May 2014, Entercom announced its launch of SmartReach Digital product line focused on creating digital marketing options for small and medium businesses.[59]\n\nEarly in 2020, Entercom opened a HD Radio Sound Space in Los Angeles as an event space and home for future live events. The space was opened with a live performance from Coldplay.[60]\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Entercom developed the Stay Connected programming that included \"Heroes & Difference Makers,\" and \"Love Local,\" and “I'm Listening: Stay Connected,\" a daily digital series on mental health hosted by \"LOVELINE\"'s Dr. Chris Donaghue.[61]\n\nIn 2022, Audacy announced plans to open a new studio on Broadway in Nashville, as part of the company’s partnership with Hard Rock International.[62]\n\nIn February 2023, Audacy released a ground-breaking study alongside research and analytics platform Veritonic that highlights how to make audio ads most effective.[63]\n\nIn March 2024, Audacy introduced dynamic AI and machine learning into its Ad Tech stack to help brands more precisely target podcast consumers. This capability will allow advertising partners to target messages that are aligned with podcast content.[64]\n\nRebranding\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 30, 2021, after more than 50 years as Entercom, the company rebranded as Audacy to clarify its position as a scaled multi-platform audio content and entertainment company. The Radio.com name was also rebranded as the Audacy app.[65] On the same day, Audacy and BetMGM agreed to a multi-year deal designating the sports betting and gaming platform as the preferred sports betting partner with Audacy.[66]\n\nDelisting from New York Stock Exchange and bankruptcy\n\n[edit]\n\nOn May 16, 2023, Audacy was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange due to the company's common stock trading at an abnormally low share price. Audacy announced their intention to appeal the exchange's decision while seeking a reverse stock split from their shareholders to remedy the situation.[67] However, in October 2023, Audacy's appeal was denied, and the NYSE continued to proceed in the process of delisting Audacy's stock, which became effective on November 10, 2023.[68]\n\nIn early January 2024, it was announced that Audacy would be preparing to file for bankruptcy within the upcoming weeks. On January 7, 2024, Audacy filed for prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. As part of the bankruptcy reorganization, Audacy has made a deal with its creditors to transfer control to them while cutting approximately $1.6 billion of its debt.[69]\n\nTunein restoration\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 21, 2023, Audacy and TuneIn reached a new agreement and restored access of its stations to TuneIn users after a near five-year absence.[70]\n\nPartnerships\n\n[edit]\n\nIn April 2019, Entercom reached a distribution agreement with Waze, giving drivers the ability to access Radio.com's podcasts and on-demand audio content through Waze.[71]\n\nIn September 2020 Clark Atlanta University partnered with Entercom, to give Mass Media Arts Students at the university access to company representatives in programming, sales, digital, and on-air talent.[72]\n\nOn October 21, 2020, Entercom announced a partnership with the National Urban League to advance racial justice and equity in the communities they serve.[73]\n\nIn 2020, Radio.com established partnerships with SoundHound Inc [74] and Beasley Media Group.[75]\n\nAlso in 2020, streaming platform Twitch added the video feeds from a number of Radio.com's sports stations with branded channels[76] and GM added Radio.com to its in-dash application in Chevrolet, GMC, Buick, and Cadillac vehicles.[77]\n\nWe Can Do Hard Things, a twice-weekly podcast hosted by #1 New York Times bestselling author Glennon Doyle, her wife Abby Wambach, and her sister Amanda Doyle joined Audacy in May, 2021.
