Throughout history, war has been processed, glorified, and protested through art. Ancient battle scenes stand as among the earliest artistic depictions in civilized society, used at the time for documenting wars won and for intimidating enemies. Since then, myriad impressions of wartime have been shared throughout every civilization and from virtually every perspective. Classic books like Ernest Hemingway’s “Farewell to Arms” stand as celebrated examples of anti-war works, while pieces like Diego Rivera’s “The Nightmare of War and Dream of Peace” incited controversy.

Among the most powerful mediums artists have found to transmit and better understand the effects of war is film. To determine the best American war movies, Stacker compiled data on all American war movies to come up with the Stacker score—a weighted index split evenly between IMDb and Metacritic scores. To qualify, the film had to have an IMDb user score and Metascore, be American-made, and deal explicitly with the United State’s involvement in a war. Ties were broken by Metascore, and further ties were broken by IMDb user votes. These are the women and men of Hollywood who have stepped into the shoes of the greatest heroes in American history, both real and fictional.

Keep reading to see which war movies have made the list, how many came from Clint Eastwood, and which Stanley Kubrik titles crested the top 20.

- Director: Barry Levinson

- Stacker score: 77.3- Metascore: 67

- IMDb user rating: 7.3

- Runtime: 121 minutes

In “Good Morning, Vietnam,” comedic genius Robin Williams stars as irreverent DJ Adrian Cronauer, host of the country’s Armed Forces Radio Service station during the war. Laugh-out-loud funny, and occasionally soberingly realistic, Roger Ebert said that the role was “far and away the best work Williams has ever done in a movie.” It also remains one of the few examples of war-comedy on this list.

#48. Flying Leathernecks (1951)

- Director: Nicholas Ray

- Stacker score: 77.3

- Metascore: 75

- IMDb user rating: 6.5

- Runtime: 102 minutes

A group of U.S. Marines falls under new command in the lead-up to the battle of Guadalcanal in “Flying Leathernecks.” Blatantly pro-war, it has often been said that the 1951 film was assigned to director Nicholas Ray, a known liberal who disagreed with the film’s political stance, so that he could essentially prove his loyalty during the Red Scare.

- Director: Arthur Hiller

- Stacker score: 77.9

- Metascore: 68

- IMDb user rating: 7.3

- Runtime: 115 minutes

As much a love story as it is a war movie, “The Americanization of Emily” sees Lt. Cmdr. Charles Edward Madison, an easy-living American soldier played by James Garner, fall for an Englishwoman, played by Julie Andrews, only to have their newly blossoming romance thrown into turmoil when he gets sent on a dangerous and senseless mission. Set in the time period just before D-Day, the film is based on a novel of the same name by William Bradford Huie.

Released around the same time as “M.A.S.H.”—#20 on the list—”Catch-22″ was not a commercial or critical success upon its debut, but has since found itself a cult following.

- Director: Ben Stiller

- Stacker score: 77.9

- Metascore: 71

- IMDb user rating: 7

- Runtime: 107 minutes

War and comedy are not often words heard in the same sentence, unless, of course, you are speaking about Ben Stiller’s “Tropic Thunder.” The late ‘00s movie follows a group of actors who head out into the jungle to make a film about the Vietnam War only to find that they must become the soldiers they’re pretending to be. The cast is packed with some of Hollywood’s biggest names, including Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr., Tom Cruise, and Matthew McConaughey.

Stanley Kramer directed this fictionalized retelling of one of the Nuremberg trials in which four Nazi judges were held accountable for their crimes against humanity. A number of Old Hollywood stars, including Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, Spencer Tracy, and Burt Lancaster star in the black-and-white film. However, it was a relative newcomer, Maximilian Schell, who walked away with an Oscar for his performance, reprising his role as Hans Rolfe from the story’s original “Playhouse 90″ TV broadcast.

#43. A Private War (2018)

- Director: Matthew Heineman

- Stacker score: 78.5

- Metascore: 75

- IMDb user rating: 6.7

- Runtime: 110 minutes

Rosamund Pike stars as Marie Colvin, an American journalist who devoted her life to covering the civil wars of some of the world’s most dangerous countries, in “A Private War.” The film does well what Colvin tried so hard to do in her reporting—that is, highlights the plight of the innocent victims of conflict—while also giving audiences an idea of the considerable risk war reporters put themselves in to bring them the truth.

#42. Courage Under Fire (1996)

- Director: Edward Zwick

- Stacker score: 79

- Metascore: 77

- IMDb user rating: 6.6

- Stacker score: 80.1

- Metascore: 73

- IMDb user rating: 7.2

- Runtime: 154 minutes

An all-star cast and the seven Oscar nominations for “Cold Mountain” secured its place as one of the best war movies of all time. The early ‘90s movie follows a Confederacy deserter, played by Jude Law, as he journeys home to reunite with the woman he loves, played by Nicole Kidman. A sort of early American “Odyssey,” the film is surprisingly historically accurate and deeply emotional.

#39. Sands of Iwo Jima (1949)

- Director: Allan Dwan

- Stacker score: 80.7

- Metascore: 75

- IMDb user rating: 7.1

- Runtime: 100 minutes

Few battles have captured the American imagination like the one that took place on Iwo Jima during World War II. Dwan’s “Sands of Iwo Jima” is among the many retellings of the event, following a Marine platoon led by John Wayne from basic training through that iconic raising of the American flag. One Variety magazine critic complained the saga was too sentimental and superficial; judging by the film’s IMDb user rating, fans seem to disagree.

- Stacker score: 80.7

- Metascore: 75

- IMDb user rating: 7.1

- Runtime: 113 minutes

- IMDb user rating: 7

- Runtime: 90 minutes

“Hell Is for Heroes” recalls an incident from World War II in which the 95th Infantry Division was tasked with holding off an entire German company for two days while awaiting reinforcements.

- Stacker score: 81.2

- Metascore: 75

- IMDb user rating: 7.2

- Runtime: 145 minutes

- Stacker score: 81.2

- Metascore: 82

- IMDb user rating: 6.5

Originally intended as a straightforward action caper, Lee retooled the movie to address the tension Black soldiers have faced fighting for America’s freedom while not being able to fully experience that freedom themselves.

Fuller, a veteran of the 1st Infantry Division, independently produced the film, which he largely shot in Israel and completed on a minuscule budget.

- Director: Dalton Trumbo

- Stacker score: 82.9

- Metascore: 71

- IMDb user rating: 7.9

- Runtime: 111 minutes

“Johnny Got His Gun” is much more of an anti-war film than it is a war film. The plot follows Timothy Bottoms, an 18-year-old who enlists during World War I only to lose his arms, legs, sight, hearing, and ability to speak. The grim tale didn’t attract legions of fans, and likely would have been widely forgotten if not for its presence in the music video for Metallica’s song “One.”

- Stacker score: 82.9

- Metascore: 73

- IMDb user rating: 7.7

- IMDb user rating: 7.6

The Sidney Lumet film is based on a novel of the same name by Eugene Brudick and Harvey Wheeler that was serialized in the Saturday Evening Post throughout the Cuban Missile Crisis.

- Metascore: 76

- IMDb user rating: 8.3

- Runtime: 116 minutes

- Runtime: 141 minutes

A companion piece to “Flags of Our Fathers,” “Letters From Iwo Jima” is a Japanese-language film about the World War II battle of Iwo Jima, told from the perspective of the Japanese soldiers who fought it. The Clint Eastwood picture stands apart from the war movie crowd because it’s not a story of hard-fought victory, but rather one of inevitable defeat, the type of story rarely seen on the big screen. It was clearly a take that resonated with critics and audiences alike, as demonstrated by the film’s box office success and nomination for several prestigious awards including Best Picture at the Academy Awards.
