        "meta_description": "Focusing on a selected filmography of ten Westerns,         this paper explores the reasons why Civil War films, though         traditionally set in the East, eventually moved to a western setting,         particularly between the early 1940s and the late 1960s. It also aims         to show how and to what extent the Western genre proved to be a         convenient means to sustain the tale of national reconciliation in the         American Civil War. These films reveal that the genre simply drew on         preexisting codes and past trends to represent both the war and         Southerners, but also used what the West had to offer, notably stock         enemies and a neutral territory, to bring about the national         reunification.",

        "text": "3After examining the heritage of the Civil War on the screen as well as the reasons why Civil War scripts “moved West,” the analysis focuses on Southern and Western motifs in the selected films, highlighting the standard elements of Southern representation and some key ingredients that were inherent to the Western genre and proved useful to convey the ideological message of national reconciliation.\n\nThe Civil War on the screen\n\nThe Civil War goes West\n\nThe heritage of the “Moonlight-and-Magnolias school”\n\n14One of the most striking features of these Civil War Westerns is the traditional, frequently clichéd, over-romanticized portrayal of the Southerners, with the stereotypically gallant Confederate gentlemen and Southern Belles. The heritage of the “Moonlight-and-Magnolias school” is unmistakable, for instance, in Virginia City, which actually starts in the South. In the early scene where Julia (Miriam Hopkins) meets Vance Irby (Randolph Scott), all characteristic elements are present: a romantic setting at night under the moonlight, the great aristocratic Southern mansion as decor, the blond Southern Belle and the knightly Confederate officer remembering with nostalgia a world that seems already “gone with the wind,” while the Southern hymn “Dixie” is gently being played as background music. Julia remembers the “old days,” the social gatherings that used to be organized, and of course her father’s “pride,” adding bitterly that she has nothing left because “the war has taken everything.” The whole scene depicts the usual romanticization of the South that was part of the biased narratives meant to soothe Southerners’ wounded pride. We can also see that the Southern officer selflessly accepts the fact that Julia does not return his love, forecasting that she will fall for another man.\n\n15Likewise, in Escape from Fort Bravo, the romanticized South is present, but through less obvious visuals, since the whole movie is set in the West right from the beginning. Rather, it is through the contrast between the Confederate prisoners and Union Captain Roper (William Holden), portrayed as brutal and unforgiving, that the Southern type is highlighted. For instance, despite the dreadful conditions of the prison camp, Confederate Captain John Marsh (John Forsythe) retains his dignity and proudly declares that although he may have fought in the “wrong army,” he has nonetheless fought for the “right cause” (the exact nature of “the cause” is, however, never specified). Meaningfully enough, the Confederates also count among their ranks a poet, Bailey (John Lupton) – a cowardly deserter in the eyes of Roper – who symbolizes the noble, delicate and romantic ways of the antebellum South. The poet is the one who brings back nostalgic memories of his native South (Virginia) that clash with the arid, hostile West (Arizona): “It’s awful out there. Just space and death.” Bailey then breaks into a smile, thinking of his hometown, in a recollection that resonates with the moonlight-and-magnolias South recreated by Hollywood: “Virginia town on a street of maple trees. At the end of that street, a brook ran under a stone bridge.”\n\n16In other Civil War Westerns, Southern motifs typically involve Southern gentlemen, whose gallant manners sharply differ from those of the Frontiersmen in the rough West where such courtesy is uncommon – so uncommon that local women do not always fully appreciate such graciousness! In Santa Fe, for instance, when one of the polite Southerners takes off his hat to salute a lady, he concludes from her surprising lack of reaction: “I guess the gents up here don’t bow to ladies.” In the same film, Britt Canfield is equally astonished when he meets Judith Chandler (Janis Carter), who happens to be the railroad company’s paymaster, telling her with a smile: “In the South, we don’t usually see a woman doing a man’s work.” These comments are definite clichés about the South, just as – on a more humorous note – the Southerners’ military discipline and efficiency sharply contrast with the Yankee “outfit of misfits” in Advance to the Rear (George Marshall, 1964), or with the clumsiness of the Northern bell boy recruited as a spy in A Southern Yankee (Edward Sedgwick, 1948).\n\nThe West as a symbol of America’s future\n\nBritt, a railroad must keep growing, or it dies. And if it dies, all life along its right of ways dies too. Our loyalty belongs to the thousands of people who’ve put their trust in men like you […]. Nothing must stop this railroad from going forward. It’s bigger than any one person, Britt. Even a brother.\n\n19She might as well have said: “Nothing must stop this nation from going forward.” Between his sense of duty and his sense of family, the choice is finally obvious for the “good reb” Britt, and implies that unless his brothers accept the defeat of the South, they will have to be sacrificed for the good of the entire nation. At the beginning of the film, the railroad entrepreneur declares that “nothing but a railroad will make this new empire a part of an expanding America,” asking Northerners and Southerners to “put aside [their] differences for all time, in the interest of a good and common cause.” Echoing this message, the very last words of the movie conclude: “What the future holds, no man can know, but there’ll always be a new end of track. Our trains will become bigger and faster. For as the railroads grow, so will America.” America, as one nation, linked and even mended by its railroad tracks, is henceforth truly indivisible.\n\nUnity against a common enemy\n\n21Warring brothers unite when threatened by a third party, and the Western genre provided stock enemies that came in handy: Indians, outlaws, or any characters of a greedy, despicable, and immoral nature. In Virginia City, when the Union soldiers catch up with the southern rebels’ wagon train, some light-hearted music conveys the idea that the Yankees mean no harm – an idea reinforced by their warm smiles. The musical motif suddenly changes into an ominous tune when a large group of Mexican bandits (whose leader, John Murrell, is played by a rather miscast mustachioed Humphrey Bogart) is seen approaching the wagon train, representing a menace to both Southerners and Yankees. When the bandits attack, the Union soldiers immediately rush to the rescue of the Southerners, and the latter let them enter the circle of wagons formed to defend themselves. The reconciliation is visually manifest when Irby and Bradford are seen fighting side by side against the Mexican bandits symbolizing the racial “Other”: the former enemies instantly recognize their mutual brotherhood and their shared (white) “Americanness.” Through these two characters battling in the Western territories, the North and the South are portrayed as embodiments of common American values: on both sides, they fight courageously, display dignity, trustworthiness and respect for one another. The message is still hammered home in the last piece of dialogue between Bradford and the dying Irby, notably when the former declares: “Too bad you and I had to be on opposite sides of the fence in this. I think we might have been friends.”\n\n22In Escape from Fort Bravo, the same logic applies when Roper and his Southern prisoners are suddenly attacked by Mescalero Indians, as foretold by an unambiguous prologue:\n\nIn 1863, while the War Between the States still raged, a large group of Confederate prisoners were held in a sun baked stockade at Fort Bravo, Arizona Territory.\n\nCaptor and captive—these men in blue and gray—eyed each other with hatred.\n\nIn the wilderness around them a common enemy eyed them both—the deadly Mescalero Indians. [Emphasis added]\n\nReconciliation: the symbolic Union\n\n54 Bruce Chadwick, op. cit., 66.\n\n[W]omen were used as means to absolve everyone, North and South, of guilt about the war. […] Which side a man was fighting for didn’t matter, directors intimated, because the woman knew – although no one else did – that when the war ended the nation, just like the family, would be reunited.\n\n27Women do know and do forgive, as Judith, in Santa Fe, who declares that although Britt Canfield led the Confederate raid that killed her husband during the war, she “never did resent him as a person. Only what he stood for.” In Siege at Red River (Rudolph Maté, 1954), the Confederate male spy admits: “Where I come from, saving Yankees isn’t considered very noble,” to which the Northern nurse who loves him simply asks: “Can’t you think of them just as people?” Just like Judith, this female character distinguishes between the uniform and the man, between the soldier who accomplishes his duty and the human being. The same message can be heard in Arizona Bushwhackers, as the Southern Belle spy, Jill (Yvonne De Carlo), tells the Northerner she loves that the ex-Confederate who has come to act as sheriff is “not in the war anymore. He’s just a human being, like you. He’s trying to pick up the pieces and live the best way he can.” [Emphasis added]\n\nConclusion\n\n29Civil War Westerns clearly appeared to be quite nationalistic or even propagandistic, praising the winning qualities of winning Americans. The Western genre made it easy to further the myth of a supposedly “unavoidable” national reconciliation, facilitating a depoliticization of the Civil War while stressing the necessity of national unity at a time when Americans had to band together, first in the context of World War II and then during the Cold War. The West and the Western were convenient means to repeat the traditional Reconciliation plot – a reconciliation, however, which was designed only for white Americans – without running the risk of sparking off a controversy, as there was no need to justify the absence of African Americans or to mention the cause of the war (slavery) in the Wild West."
