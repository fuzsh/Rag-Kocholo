        "meta_description": "\"An illustrated song telling the story of a hero who leaves for the war as a private, is promoted to the rank of captain for bravery in service, meets the girl of his choice, who is a Red Cross nurse on the field, and finally returns home triumphantly as an officer to the father and mother to whom he bade good bye as a private. The film presents this beautiful song picture in six scenes, each of which has a separate song, making the entire series a complete and effective novelty. PARTING. -- \"Our hero boy to the war has gone.\" Words and music. CAMPING. -- \"What! A letter from home.\" Words and music. FIGHTING. -- The battle prayer. \"Father, on Thee I Call.\" Words and music. CONVALESCING. -- \"Weeping, Sad and Lonely.\" Words and music. SORROWING. -- The mother's lament, \"Come back, my dear boy, to me.\" Words and music. RETURNING. -- When our hero boy comes back again. Hurrah! Hurrah! \"Star Spangled Banner.\" Words and music. The above scene can be illustrated either by a soloist, quartette or with an orchestra, and with or without stereopticon slides. This series of animated pictures, when properly illustrated or announced by stereopticon reading matter, should make a great success. Length 200 feet, complete with words of song and music\"--Edison films catalog.",
