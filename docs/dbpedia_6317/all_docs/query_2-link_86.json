        "text": "We commend to you that marvel of all ages—the greatest device that came from man’s ingenuity—the cinema—the long sought visual form of communication—the perfect form for teaching and the only qualitative gain to communication since the alphabet was evolved.\n\n—B. A. Aughinbaugh, 1941\n\nPublic health and war have long been close companions, and maybe strange bedfellows. Starting with the Crimean War, and then the first terrible round of “modern wars”—the American Civil War, the Franco-Prussian War and World War I—military officials and civilian leaders called on health professionals and volunteers to help mobilize and protect military forces and civilian populations. Health professionals and volunteers, in turn, viewed war as an opportunity to test and implement their theories, as an opportunity to use newly discovered knowledge and newly invented technologies—and eagerly jumped on war bandwagons to advance their professional, scientific, political and ideological goals. Not surprisingly then, public health and military establishments have come to share a common vocabulary (campaigns, mobilizations, officers, enemies, containments, crusades, surveillance, evacuation, battles, wars, victories, tactics, strategies, logistics), a common obsession with scientific and technological innovation, and a common organizational model: the disciplined, deployable, hierarchical service; command and control.\n\nThe synergistic relationship between health professionals and the military especially flourished during the most massive conflict of all: World War II. In the era of total war, the mobilization of science and technology on behalf of the war effort famously bore fruit in the development of antibiotics, radar, and the atomic bomb. But the war also invigorated and shaped a variety of technological approaches to public health—the development of chemical pesticides to kill mosquitoes and other insect disease vectors, the expansion of electronic communication networks for public health surveillance, and the production of public health films aimed at mass audiences of military personnel and civilians.\n\nThe use of film to educate and mobilize the public for health purposes was not new. Interest in the educational possibilities of motion pictures began practically with the invention of the technology. But the medium of film inspired larger visions. In 1910 Thomas Edison prophesied that the motion picture would “wipe out narrow-minded prejudices which are founded on ignorance,…create a feeling of sympathy and a desire to help the down-trodden people of the earth, and…give new ideals to be followed.” [1] Edison clearly had an inventor’s (and investor’s) interest in promoting motion pictures, but his enthusiasm for his invention was widely shared. Film was almost universally regarded as an exemplary technology of modernity, a medium destined to transform society. In the early decades of the 20th century, military and civilian officials, educators, leaders of philanthropic organizations, and commercial companies like Pathé Frères and Eastman Kodak, all began making and exploring the uses of film to instruct the public and shape public opinion. Public health advocates and professionals—who had ambitious agendas of their own—were especially charmed, deeply impressed by cinema’s sway over mass audiences. The first public health film, on the “life drama of the fly,” was made in Great Britain in 1910 as part of a national anti-fly campaign. Other productions followed, in Britain, Germany, the United States, France, and, later, Italy and the Soviet Union, on the health hazards of alcoholism, water and food contamination, and other topics. [2]\n\nAfter this initial wave of filmmaking, some public health professionals began to temper their enthusiasm, perhaps influenced by a larger post-war disillusionment that was setting in. Evart G. Routzahn and Mary Swain Routzahn, pioneering public health media specialists for the progressive Russell Sage Foundation, were skeptical about the effectiveness of the films that had been made. “The propaganda value of the motion picture,” they wrote in 1918, “is both very considerable and…overrated. It is unreasonable to expect results merely because people like motion pictures.” The Routzahns, and some other public health advocates, didn’t dismiss film entirely, but argued that the public health films of the period were poorly made, scientifically inaccurate, and lacking in credibility. [3]\n\nPublic Health And The State\n\nAccording to most historians, in the 19th century and first three decades of the 20th, the United States was a weak and fragmented nation-state, hobbled by divided sovereignty, laissez-faire ideology, and low tax revenues, unable to cope with the new conditions of industrial modernity and the rise of great cities. [4] That assessment is largely derived from the writings of the era’s progressive reformers. From the 1880s to the 1940s, public health advocates, political and social activists, and geopolitical strategists saw themselves as social critics, reformers and nation-builders. Their shared ideal was of a centralized American state with a capable and effective infrastructure that married the force, legitimacy, and resources of the nation to the progressive advance of science. Only vigilant and thoroughly modern bureaucracies, under the stewardship of scientifically educated officials and their academic and philanthropic allies, could study, prevent, and eradicate social and medical pathologies. [5]\n\nThe health progressives had some successes. Between 1880 and 1920, public health bureaucracies took root in state and city governments, and national non-profit health advocacy organizations flourished. World War I especially spurred the expansion of the federal government’s role in public health, and public health film production, in the name of the war effort. After the war, many of the programs introduced during the war were discontinued, in an effort to reduce expenditures to pre-war levels. During the 1920s, the United States Public Health Service had no budget for film production, though some health films were produced by the Department of Agriculture and the Children’s Bureau of the U.S. Department of Labor. [6] In those years, the most dynamic area of public health activity took place in some of the more progressive states (especially in New York and Wisconsin), philanthropic and advocacy organizations like the National Tuberculosis Association, and quasi-governmental organizations like the American Social Hygiene Association, although by the late 1920s these were hampered by the Great Depression and the overall contraction of the U.S. economy. With the landslide election of Franklin Roosevelt in 1932, there came a new burst of activity on the federal level. The New Deal agenda called for an enlarged, progressive federal government; the federal government began increasing its support for public health bureaus and activities, and many state governments followed suit. The onset of World War II (along with the return of economic prosperity, increased tax revenues and greater tolerance for budget deficits) spurred an even greater expansion of public health bureaus and programs, military and civilian.\n\nThis was predicated on a rising tide of popular support for government programs, including those related to public health. Public health programs, in turn, were designed to foster, mobilize and consolidate popular support, as well as fight disease. In the 1930s and ’40s, the American public was served an intoxicating brew of rationalism, professionalism and democratic ideology. A patriotic belief in activist democracy became fused with faith in the power of science and technology. For progressive reformers, a key part of the agenda was to create and nurture an “enlightened” or “intelligent” citizenry. [7] U.S. Public Health Service public relations experts Elizabeth G. Pritchard, Joseph Hirsh, and Margaret T. Prince, in a typical formulation of the late New Deal period, argued that “intelligent citizenship” was “a prerequisite for the full enjoyment of our democratic privileges”:\n\nIntelligent citizenship connotes knowledge of the facts concerning numerous inter-related social problems (of which human health is one) and the means for their solution…. Upon the professions—the physician, the educator, the journalist, the sociologist, economist, lawyer, scientist, and public administrator—devolves the major responsibility for making such knowledge generally available. No less does the obligation fall upon the non-professional citizen to acquaint himself with the facts; that this is so is evidenced by the unprecedented current demand upon responsible agencies, both public and private, for information with reference to reliable source materials on countless subjects. [8]\n\nArmed with the facts, the public would demand action. Governmental efforts to inform the public and mobilize public support, and the increasing pace of scientific discovery and technological invention, would in turn lead to an increased role for science in an expanding and increasingly effective government. An informed and activist citizenry, led by a cadre of trained professionals in possession of the latest scientific advances, would remake society. Neglected or intractable problems would finally be remedied through “the rapid advance of scientific medicine, improvements in public health and medical practice, the increased speed with which new and better measures for the prevention and cure of diseases are applied, and a growing acceptance and employment of the knowledge and skills of other professions both by public health and medicine”:\n\nIn society as a whole, there is the gathering force springing from the wide-spread efforts of public administration and the social sciences to solve problems of industrialization and urbanization, unemployment, poverty, dependency, delinquency, and inadequate education. From these pressures both within and without, there is slowly emerging a clearer concept of the social functions of public health, medicine, and their ancillary professions in the United States. [9]\n\nFor health officials and advocates, mobilization was crucial—and education and technology were the keys to mobilization. The health of the public could only be secured by an informed and aroused populace working energetically and collectively to prevent the contamination of the water and food supply, accidents, and the spread of disease-bearing micro-organisms and insects. And among all the technologies of mobilization, the motion picture was seen as the most modern and most powerful. [10]\n\nThe New Deal-inspired revival of enthusiasm for activist progressive government shifted the locus of health education and propaganda from private philanthropies and commercial companies to the public sector. Public health officials renewed their efforts, producing and distributing short motion pictures for use in combination with other public health campaign components: posters, pamphlets, lectures, glass slide shows, exhibitions and displays, magazine advertisements and articles, radio programs and announcements. Many of these productions showed an increasing sophistication in the use of media. But film was not a central component of the campaigns: motion pictures required an infrastructure of film projectors in schools, community centers or “health-mobiles”. They were also costly to produce and required special expertise. Most public health films still suffered from poor production values, bad acting, and amateurish scripts.\n\nWith the onset of World War II, federal, state, and local government greatly expanded in size and scope, along with the American economy, and so did expenditures on public health. The long sought-after dream of a powerful and effective national government, guided by scientifically trained professionals—the public health holy grail—seemed finally at hand. Media specialists, filmmakers, actors, writers and professional experts were inducted into the military or civilian government, or granted government contracts. Projects long deferred or starved for money suddenly got funding, if they could be justified in the name of the war effort: in the last few years of the war, the U.S. military and information services’ combined budget for “visual education” (mainly instructional and documentary films) amounted to about $50,000,000, a considerable sum. [11] And with this increased funding, public health advocates were able to make more films and better films—more competently scripted, edited, acted, and photographed—and better equipped to make use of sound.\n\nThe invention of synchronized sound motion pictures in 1929 made film more than just a visually kinetic medium: the motion picture became a hybrid of the visual and the aural. During the 1930s filmmakers in Hollywood and elsewhere created and explored new ways to juxtapose sound and images. The addition of sound made film viewing into a more powerful experience. Sound film, it was believed, could better educate and motivate film audiences, orchestrate their emotions, and shape their views. Public health professionals began to enthuse anew about the potential uses of motion pictures. However, the transition from silent pictures to sound did not occur instantaneously or evenly or as fast as it did in Hollywood. In the 1930s, while some medical and public health motion pictures did employ sound, many did not: producers lacked the budgets, skills and equipment to make sound films. Silent medical films continued to be produced throughout the ’30s and ’40s.\n\nThe Public Health Film Goes To War\n\nThe Second World War has seen the development of two new weapons: the airplane and the motion picture.\n\n—General George C. Marshall, ca. 1944, in Arthur L. Mayer, “Fact into Film,” Public Opinion Quarterly 8.2 (Summer 1944): 206.\n\nIn the 1940s, public health sound cinema came into its own. It acquired a mass audience of military men and women (more than 12,000,000), schoolchildren, theatergoers, and community groups. [12] It got larger budgets, in some cases well-known actors, producers, directors, and animators. And it got a starring role in public health campaigns which were more elaborately planned and coordinated than ever before. During the World War II-era, many of the techniques developed in Hollywood entertainment films over the previous decade—polished edits, orchestral musical backgrounds, exciting storylines, snappy patter—came to be used to build audience support and participation for public health programs and mobilizations. Budgets were still generally small—many films consisted of little more than edited footage (sometimes with older footage or stock footage mixed in), with a voiceover and maybe a canned score—but some were more ambitious, the public health equivalent of a top-line, “A” movie.\n\nThe most elaborate were those produced by the United States Armed Forces. Even before the U.S. entered the war, in 1940 and ’41, there was an upsurge in military spending and an increase in military-funded training films. The War Department took over the Astoria Studios in New York and the Army Air Force took over the Hal Roach Studio in Culver City, California. Shortly after Pearl Harbor, in 1941, Darryl F. Zanuck, the head of Twentieth-Century Fox, was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Army Signal Corps, and began supervising production of training films.\n\nIn 1942, with the U.S. fully engaged in the war against the Axis powers, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed an executive order creating an Office of War Information. The OWI’s mission was to use behavioral psychology and other social sciences (what was termed “social engineering”) to study how the U.S. government could best use newspapers and magazine articles, radio, motion pictures, comic strips, and anything else, to educate and mobilize the public on behalf of the war effort. The same year the U.S. Army established an Information and Education Division, led by Brigadier General Frederick H. Osborn (before the war, a prominent member of the Social Science Research Council). Osborn founded a filmmaking unit, headed by the celebrated Hollywood director Frank Capra. Capra in turn established an animation unit headed by Theodore Geisel (“Dr. Seuss”) and staffed by a roster of distinguished animators from Warner Brothers and other top studios, John Hubley, Friz Freleng, Chuck Jones, Bob Clampett, Frank Tashlin, Zack Schwartz, David Hilberman and many others. The onscreen animation talent featured soundtrack music by Warner Brothers composer Carl Stallings and voices by Mel Blanc (the voice of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck). The Navy, Marines, Army Air Force, and Coast Guard followed suit, employing filmmakers, actors and animators—increasingly working in consultation with educators, psychologists and sociologists. In the course of the war, the U.S. military made thousands of films, live action and animated. Although most of these had nothing to do with public health, focusing on other issues deemed crucial to the war effort, many films did include material on medicine and public health, and some were wholly devoted to health concerns. [13]\n\nThe purpose of this motion picture is to give you the facts, and then you as individuals and as citizens of a democracy must take action.\n\n—Thomas Parran, U.S. Surgeon-General, in To the People of the United States, 1944\n\nBut the World War II-era public health film was not just a military matter. During the war, the quasi-military U.S. Public Health Service, state and local departments of health, and non-governmental organizations (such as the National Tuberculosis Association and the Red Cross) intensified their film-making activities, often coordinating their efforts on federal, state and local levels. These health films testify to a widespread belief in the power of motion pictures to educate and mobilize. Many of them also document specific projects and campaigns. In 1940, for example, the federal Works Progress Administration (WPA) co-sponsored a health initiative in Alabama that included funding for production of “scripts for sound film programs”. These were to be produced in tandem with: posters; pamphlets; exhibitions; radio plays, “lectures,” interviews,” and “short radio talks” (with separate scripts “for Negro programs”); a speakers bureau; and a traveling marionette show. [14] Public health motion pictures almost never stood alone: they were usually designed to serve in larger campaigns that deployed a variety of media.\n\nLike any complex cultural production, they were packed with meaning, rife with metaphors and representations of the social practices and conditions of the day: industrial warfare, machine technology, popular culture, consumer goods, urban and rural life, racial segregation, the automobile and the railroad. The public health films of the 1940s were part of a larger rhetorical effort to consolidate an ideological consensus. They celebrated a utopian, almost intoxicated, vision of American democracy—a missionary urge to democratize other nations and societies—and a deep faith in the ability of science to solve (previously intractable) problems of poverty and disease. They also promoted fear of the non-Western races and nations as a source of contagion, and were chock full of casual racism, class prejudice, and sexism. The contradiction that seems evident now, was invisible then: war-time public health films trafficked in racial, gender, class, and national stereotypes, even as they offered a vision of an egalitarian democratic society mobilized to fight the forces of bigotry and prejudice.\n\nThey were shown in a variety of venues—army bases, naval vessels, battlefield encampments, hospitals, schools, community centers, traveling health-mobiles, even movie theaters—to a variety of audiences."
