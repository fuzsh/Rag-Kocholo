        "text": "Colonialism And Anti-Colonial Movements\n\nAvatar (2009)\n\nThis Academy Award-winning film about a mining expedition to a dangerous, undeveloped, alien moon populated by a nature-embracing humanoid tribe can be seen as a thinly veiled allegory against Western colonialism. Ethical issues like the resource curse, the conflict between technology and ancient traditions, and how far soldiers must go in following their orders are also explored.\n\nThe Home and the World (1984)\n\nThe story of a love triangle between a rich, English-educated Bengali, his wife, and a radical nationalist politician, this film dramatizes the political, cultural, and religious differences among Indians under British colonial rule at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nKhartoum (1966)\n\nAfter a messianic leader and his troops massacred a British-led Egyptian force in Sudan in 1883, the British sent General Gordon to Khartoum to evacuate British and Egyptian citizens. But Gordon disobeyed orders and stayed on to fight. It was his last stand. \"A good example of Eurocentrism in filmmaking, as well as a cautionary tale about the perils of imperialism,\" says Gregg.\n\nThe Mission (1986)\n\nIn this visually spectacular film, Spanish Jesuits and Portuguese colonizers struggle over a group of Guarani Indians. It tells of clashes between cultures, between faith and greed, a struggle for redemption, and well-meaning efforts that go badly wrong. Of course, the biggest losers are the Guarani.\n\nRabbit-Proof Fence (2002)\n\nFrom about 1870 to 1970, the Australian government forcibly took many aboriginal and mixed-race children from their parents and brought them to boarding schools where they were taught to forget their past. Rabbit-Proof Fence is based on the true story of three girls who escaped from one such school in 1931 and trekked 1,500 miles home. For an article on this topic, see \"The Stolen Generation.\"\n\nThe Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006)\n\nIn 1920s Ireland, two brothers join the IRA, which is fighting a guerrilla war the British. Both sides behave brutally and become brutalized. With the announcement of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1922, there is initial rejoicing. But the situation soon turns into a civil war: idealism against pragmatism, brother against brother.\n\nZulu (1964)\n\nBased on a true story, the film shows the 1879 Battle of Rorke's Drift, when around 100 British soldiers stationed at a remote missionary outpost faced an assault from 4,000 to 5,000 Zulu warriors. Though seen from the British point of view this is a rousing tale of heroism on both sides, as well as a portrait of individuals, both good and bad, who did the work of imperialism in far-flung parts.\n\nTotalitarianism\n\nThe Last King of Scotland (2006)\n\nSeen from the point of view of Idi Amin's Scottish personal physican, this piece of historical fiction explores the complexities of the Ugandan dictator and his paranoid, all-encompassing reign over the African nation in the 1970s. Forrest Whitaker recieved an Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Amin.\n\nThe Lives of Others (2006)\n\nTaking place in East Berlin both before and after the fall of the Berlin Wall, this subtle and gripping film tells the story of a playwright and his actress girlfriend and the Stasi agent assigned to spy on them. It lays bare their secrets, moral choices, and compromises, and the changes they and their society go through.\n\nTriumph of the Will (1934)\n\nProbably the most famous propaganda movie ever made, this film documents the Nazi Party Congress and in Nuremberg in 1934. Hitler commissioned it and plays a starring role.\n\nInside The War Room\n\nDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)\n\nIn this classic black comedy, an insane U.S. general launches an unauthorized nuclear attack on the USSR, and the U.S. War Room tries to stop him. The film, says Gregg, \"provides a veritable clinic on deterrence theory, the problems of command and control, and that high-wire act known as crisis decision-making.\"\n\nFail-Safe (1964)\n\nShot in black-and-white documentary style, this nightmarish film is the story of a fictional Cold War nuclear crisis. Due to a technical failure, U.S. nuclear bomber crews get the wrong orders and both the Americans and the Russians try frantically to abort their mission.\n\nThe Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara (Documentary, 2003)\n\nIn a series of interviews, former U.S. Secretary of State McNamara reviews his life, focusing on the difficult decisions he made and the lessons he learned from the failure of the Vietnam War.\n\nThirteen Days (2000)\n\nA re-creation of the 13 tense days of the Cuban Missile Crisis, from the perspective of President Kennedy, his advisors, and military commanders, Thirteen Days portrays the hawks in the military as nearly as much of a threat as the Soviets.\n\nCovert Operations And Espionage\n\nBreach (2007)\n\nA dramatization of the operation leading to the arrest and prosecution of Robert Hanssen, the FBI agent found guilty in 2001 of spying for the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation, Breach explores one man's motivations for betraying the secrets of his country.\n\nDirty Wars (2013)\n\nJournalist Jeremy Scahill travels to Afghanistan, Yemen, and Somlia to investigate America's covert wars in this Academy Award-nominated documentary. For more, see Scahill's talk at Carnegie Council.\n\nThe Gatekeepers (2013)\n\nFeaturing interviews with six former heads of Shin Bet, Israel's secretive security agency, this documentary sheds light on the group's role in the Six Day War and other significant and controversial events in the Middle East.\n\nThe Good Shepherd (2006)\n\nFollowing 35 years in the life of a character who joins the CIA at its founding after World War II and becomes a star counter-intelligence agent, The Good Shepherd presents an unromantic picture of a career in espionage.\n\nThe Green Prince (2014)\n\nThis documentary tells the story of Mosab Hassan Yousef, the son of one of Hamas's founding members, who, shocked by the Palestinian militants' ruthless tactics, becomes a spy for Israel.\n\nMissing (1982)\n\nAfter the kidnapping of U.S. journalist Charles Horman during the 1973 coup in Chile, his wife and father embarked on a desperate search for him. Along the way, they discovered evidence suggesting the involvement of the CIA in the coup, as well as in Horman's disappearance. Based on a true story, this film urges viewers to consider the dark side of U.S. covert operations abroad.\n\nState of Siege (1973)\n\nIn 1970, a USAID official in Uruguay was kidnapped and executed by leftist guerillas. Shortly after his death, it was reported that the official had been secretly involved in training the military and police in counterinsurgency tactics, including torture. State of Siege, based loosely on this episode, sympathizes with the guerillas' actions.\n\nThree Days of the Condor (1975)\n\nA thriller about a CIA agent who learns of a secret CIA plot to infiltrate and destabilize the Middle East and who becomes a target as a result, this film illustrates the dangerous consequences, globally and domestically, of corruption in the American intelligence agency.\n\nGenocide\n\nAu Revoir les Enfants (1987)\n\nThis is a tragic, autobiographical film about two French boys in a Catholic boarding school during Word War II. One of them is secretly Jewish, being hidden by the priests from the Nazis. The film raises issues of courage, greed, and betrayal.\n\nThe Diary of Anne Frank (1959)\n\nThis film is an adaptation of a play based on the diary of Anne Frank, a 13-year-old Jewish girl who, with her family and others, hides in a crowded attic during the Nazi occupation of Holland. The DVD includes interviews with the actors, historians, and members of the Frank family. Best to read the diary itself (The Diary of a Young Girl), but the film is powerful too.\n\nGhosts of Rwanda (Documentary, 2004)\n\nThis tells the story of the genocide through interviews with UN peacekeepers and other Westerners who were there at the time; Tutsi survivors of the slaughter; confessed Hutu killers; and high-level government officials and diplomats, including Madeleine Albright and Kofi Annan.\n\nThe Killing Fields (1984)\n\nThis film is the true story of reporter Sidney Schanberg, and his colleague and friend, Cambodian journalist Dith Pran. Like most Westerners, Schanberg fled Cambodia after the murderous Khmer Rouge regime seized power in 1975, but Pran could not. For the next four years, Pran labored in rice paddies as the genocide unfolded around him. He finally escaped and reunited with Schanberg.\n\nThe Experience Of War\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front (1930)\n\nA moving adaptation of Remarque's anti-war novel that follows a group of young German recruits from idealism to disillusionment in the trenches of World War I.\n\nApocalypse Now (1979)\n\nOur staff rated this film and Platoon as the two best movies about the Vietnam War (or the American War, as the Vietnamese call it). Based loosely on Heart of Darkness, it follows a U.S. Army captain on a mission to kill a rogue Green Beret colonel, Kurtz, who has deserted the military to lead a band of Cambodian tribesmen in the jungle. The film suggests that there is little difference between Kurtz's murderous escapades and the American soldiers' killing of Vietnamese peasants.\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)\n\nIn Burma in World War II, British prisoners of war are forced to build a railway bridge for the Japanese. \"With an all-male lead cast, themes of heroism, pride, military tradition, hierarchy, and power are masterfully interwoven into a plot that is ambiguous enough to allow for various viewpoints and perspectives,\" says reviewer Tom Dirk.\n\nCasualties of War (1989)\n\nThe story of a five-man patrol in Vietnam that kidnaps and eventually kills a young girl and the one soldier in the group who refuses to participate, Casualties of War, based on an actual event, depicts war as a destroyer of men's morals.\n\nFlags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima (2006)\n\nThese companion films re-create the famous World War II battle on the island of Iwo Jima from the perspective of the Americans (Flags of Our Fathers) and then the Japanese (Letters), who, though vastly outnumbered by American forces, fought for nearly 40 days to defend the island.\n\nGallipoli (1981)\n\nAlmost an entire Australian army unit was wiped out by Turkish machine gunners in a futile offensive later known as the Battle of the Nek, which took place during the Gallipoli campaign of World War I. Gallipoli tells the story of two young Australian friends who enlist in the army and wind up fighting side by side in this tragic battle.\n\nGrand Illusion (1938)\n\nIn this story of French prisoners of war held by the Germans during Word War I, we see friendships by social class that cut across national lines, and a call for humanism rather than patriotism. This film is an anti-war classic, without a single battle scene.\n\nThe Hurt Locker (2008)\n\nThe winner of the 2010 Academy Award for Best Picture, this harrowing fillm looks at the life and work of a maverick bomb defuser during the Iraq War. The movie explores PTSD, the bonds forged during wartime, and the culture of the military.\n\nLone Survivor (2013)\n\nSet during the war in Afghanistan in 2005, this film tells the story of Operation Red Wings, a failed United States Navy SEALs counter-insurgent mission in which four operatives were tasked with tracking Taliban leader Ahmad Shah.\n\nPlatoon (1986)\n\nTold from the point of view of a middle-class college student who volunteers to fight in the Vietnam War and whose idealism about the war vanishes, Platoon realistically portrays the chaos and confusion that American soldiers faced in the jungles of Vietnam.\n\nRestrepo (2010)\n\nAmerican journalist Sebastian Junger and British/American photojournalist Tim Hetherington, who was later killed on assignment in Libya, follow an American platoon in the deadly Korengal Valley during the Afghanistan war. The film explores daily life in a combat zone and themes of emotional distress and brotherhood among soldiers.\n\nThe Whistleblower (2010)\n\nThis film is based on the true story of Kathryn Bolkovac, a police officer from Nebraska who served as a UN peackepeer in post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bolkovac uncovered a sex trafficking ring in the Balkans, which the UN was covering up, and brought the story to BBC News.\n\nMilitary Justice\n\nBreaker Morant (1979)\n\nIn 1902, near the end of the Boer War, \"Breaker\" Morant and two other Australian soldiers were tried before a British court-martial for killing Boer prisoners of war. They were found guilty, even though their commanders had authorized to carry out such killings. The film raises questions about the accountability of soldiers for their conduct in war and the independence of military courts.\n\nJudgment at Nuremberg (1961)\n\nBased on the Judges' Trial before the U.S. Nuremberg Military Tribunal in 1947, which charged judges under the Nazi regime with war crimes, this film with Spencer Tracy, Marlene Dietrich, and a host of other stars raises the question of whether judges and other officials who carry out morally repugnant laws should be held accountable.\n\nPaths of Glory (1957)\n\nLoosely based on the true story of four French soldiers during World War I who were wrongly found guilty of mutiny and executed, Paths of Glory shows the terrible consequences of unprincipled military leadership, both on the battlefield and in the military courts.\n\nNationalism, Ethnic And Religious Conflict"
