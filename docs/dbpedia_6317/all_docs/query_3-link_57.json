        "text": "Impact on Spanish Cinema\n\nThe Spanish Civil War had a profound impact on the nation's cinema. It shaped not only the film industry but also how Spanish society viewed itself and its history.\n\nDuring the Franco regime, censorship limited open discussion about the war. However, filmmakers found creative ways to address its themes and consequences:\n\nDid you know? Under Franco's censorship, filmmakers often used allegory and indirect references to comment on the civil war and its aftermath.\n\nPost-Franco Spain saw a resurgence of interest in the civil war with more direct and varied portrayals in cinema. This period enabled a broader examination of the conflict from multiple perspectives.\n\nAbout StudySmarter\n\nStudySmarter is a globally recognized educational technology company, offering a holistic learning platform designed for students of all ages and educational levels.
