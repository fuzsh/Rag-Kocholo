        "text": "Introduction\n\n“We all determined very early on that we wanted to affect people in a way that would maybe show them the nature of war for the first time” Steven Spielberg (in Magid 1998:56)\n\nWhile Spielberg states that, in Saving Private Ryan (1996) he wanted to show the nature of war, it is unclear what “nature” he wants to reveal. What is the nature of war? Is it mindless slaughter or heroic sacrifice? While the film purports to show a realistic representation of war, this in itself is a misnomer. How can you create a realistic battle sequence when you are staging the action and there are no real consequences? Dixon (2003:61) reminds us that the John Huston documentary, The Battle of San Pietro (1945) “depicts war as a brutal, unforgiving affair in which men fight and are killed without any of the sentimentality and fraudulent pyrotechnics that marred Saving Private Ryan”. The attempted realism of Ryan is somewhat dissipated by the production and staging that has gone into it. Therefore the question remains, what is the nature of war as shown in the war film. This is not simply a question that will be levelled at ‘Ryan; it pertains to the war film genre as a whole. As Hodgkins (2002:75) states, “war films often possess philosophical and ideological implications far broader than their ostensible storylines might suggest”. Therefore we must investigate what are the ideological implications of ‘Ryan. What is the message and what is it truly trying to say?\n\nTaking the plot of Ryan, it is obvious that one of the important themes is the idea of martyrdom. It appears that the biblical myth of a holy martyr is once again glorified, this time through the myth of the war hero. As Hodgkins (ibid:77) suggests: in Spielberg’s vision, the “U.S. troops are on a holy crusade that will end only when the evil despot, Adolf Hitler, has been unseated”. I would also add: or until they have died trying. The theme of martyrdom is one that connects the realm of war and the realm of religion, for in both, the notion of self sacrifice is exalted and the martyr becomes an icon of the cause he has died for. It is within this framework of martyrdom within religion and war, that I will discuss Spielberg’s ‘Ryan.\n\nThe film was chosen for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is a well-known film that was a critical and commercial success when it was released, receiving a wide international release and winning numerous prestigious awards. The more people see it, the more influential it can be, and thus the more appropriate it is to analyse. Furthermore, Steven Spielberg is one of the top directors in Hollywood, creating both commercially popular and memorable films such as E.T. The Extra Terrestrial (1982) and the Indiana Jones series, while also directing critically lauded films such as The Colour Purple (1985) and Schindler’s List (1993). The last film is significant, not only because it also deals with World War 2. In the discussion to follow, the character of Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) will be shown to be a Christ-figure, but this is not the first time Spielberg has created such a figure. According to Nichols (2000:9), Spielberg has created a trilogy of Christ figures; “Saving the Jews [Schindler’s List], Saving the Slaves [Amistad] and Saving Private Ryan”. Having this precedent gives greater validity to the discussion of religious themes and characters within the film.\n\nThe discussion of biblical imagery and martyrdom in Saving Private Ryan will be two-fold. Firstly I will begin with a discussion of the apocalyptic themes and imagery present within the text. The word apocalypse has now become synonymous with the end of the world, however it could just as well mean the “end of a world”; that is, end of a society or culture (Linafelt and Plate 2003). In this respect war is by its very nature apocalyptic. Nothing is ever the same following a war. Both the biblical and secular versions of the apocalypse will be discussed in relation to the film. I will discuss the presence of various apocalyptic symbols that appear within the film, which in turn further the theme of martyrdom.\n\nThe second task is the interpretation of Captain John Miller in a biblical framework as a Christ/Moses figure. There have been many filmic representations of Christ over the years and a paradigm of Christ-like characteristics has been created. I must differentiate here between the “Christ-figure” and “Jesus-figure”. Peter Malone (1997) separates the two, with the former describing any figure who reflects Jesus and his mission, while the latter describes actual cinematic representations of Jesus himself. This is an important difference when it comes to looking at Christ-figures outside the realm of the religious movie as I am doing here. It also opens up the possibility of varying interpretations of Christ’s mission on earth. While Koslovic (2004) is exhaustive in his discussion and delineation of 25 structural characteristics of the cinematic Christ figures, many of his characteristics are either dubious or too general. I will examine a number of these characteristics in relation to Captain Miller, as well as discussing further interpretations of the Christ-figure which are unique (or at least uncategorised) to this film. The identification of Captain Miller as a Moses figure will be discussed to offer further biblical interpretations on the film.\n\nThe analysis and discussion will use both film and religious studies. The aim of this is to give a truly interdisciplinary analysis of the film text. As has been suggested in Plate (1998) as well as Wright (2007), film and religion studies rarely mix well. An inherent danger in religious scholars attempting to analyze film texts is the attempt to ““baptize” films that did not ask to be converted” (Mercadante 2001:2) and see Christian themes and characters where none exist. This can also be a pitfall of film scholars who consciously approach a film from a religious standpoint. Conversely, I believe that film scholars may also overlook the subtle religious references within a movie, concentrating purely on filmic analysis. We may dismiss biblical referents in a non-religious film, forgetting that, as Malone (1997:59) states the “Gospel stories and images are an intrinsic part of world culture, especially western culture,” and are used by both believers and nonbelievers, consciously and sub-consciously. That is not to say that there is a ruling world ideology of Christianity. More that there is a “Christianity of Culture”, that is, that the stories, parables, themes and characters of Christianity are known around the world. Based on this notion, film scholars can allow for religious themes and characters to be recognized in their analysis.\n\nThe analysis of ‘Ryan will combine a standard filmic visual analysis of shots with an analysis of the text from a biblical and religious studies perspective. The length of the film and the intricacy of the shots make it difficult and arduous to do a full shot-by-shot visual analysis. Instead there will be a close reading of certain important scenes combined with an overall analysis of the mise-en-scene of the film. It is hoped that this will illustrate the filmic representation of martyrdom within the context of the war. Complementary to this will be the biblical analysis of the film, referring scenes, characters and themes to sections of the bible as well as other biblical study works. This analysis will ground the filmic analysis within the realm of religion and support the overall discussion of the representation of martyrdom and sacrifice in war films.\n\nThis thesis will discuss the religious imagery and themes within Spielberg’s ‘Ryan and how these themes support the ideology of self-sacrifice and martyrdom. Jump (2007:17) states that the modern motion picture offers a huge opportunity to make “a fresh moral and religious appeal to the non-churched portions of the community”. If this is the case then the Christian image of the glory of martyrdom can equally be spread. And it is within the war film that this is most evident. Nowhere in any other genre are the terms “hero” and “glory” so closely associated with “death”.\n\nApocalyptic Sacrifice\n\nThe origin of the word “apocalypse” comes originally from Greek, meaning to reveal or uncover. This is obviously supported by the word Revelation in the title of the book. However in modern society, apocalypse is more associated with the end of the world; the end of days. There have been numerous filmic interpretations of the apocalypse, ranging from those that use the bible as a starting point, to others in which the end of the world comes from a catastrophic even (such as The Day After Tomorrow or Deep Impact). According to Plate and Linafelt (2003) this is one of the problems of the Hollywood apocalypses, that is, they consider the end of the world to mean the end of the whole world, an ultimate destruction. However if we understand that there are many worlds, worlds or paradigms within our universal world, then an apocalyptic story takes on greater significance. As stated earlier, war is classed as apocalyptic; it always ends with one world being destroyed and nothing is ever the same. That is why we often classify events as “pre World War II” or “post World War II”. The apocalypse is very much evident in the language; pre and post are, in effect, two separate worlds. The Book of Revelation is essentially about the battle between good and evil. While it may be easy to suggest that “the beast” of the apocalypse is Nazi Germany, there may be another more appropriate signifier. According to Speilberg himself (in Magid 1998), the beast is war itself “and I tried to fill up every square foot of Omaga Beach, as well as the [fictional] town of Ramelle, with the manifestations of war.” In fact, Berger (2000:391) called World War 2 “the revelatory, traumatic, apocalyptic fulcrum of the twentieth century”.\n\nWithin depictions of the apocalypse, whether they are biblical, in the form of the Book of Revelation or the Book of Daniel, or secular, in the form of cinema, there is always a univerisal and significant characteristic; martyrdom. In her article on martyrs in american disaster movies, Lena Roos (2007) gives numerous examples of self sacrifice and martyrdom within the apocalyptic disaster films, which are in essence interpretations of the apocalypse. Take for example Deep Impact. The shuttle crew willingly detonate the bomb knowing that they will die in the process. Another example would be Volcano (1997) in which a character saves the driver of the subway train by walking onto the lava, knowing that he will be killed in the process of saving a life. In ‘Ryan, apocalyptic imagery is very prevalent and, like the disaster movies, the theme of sacrificing yourself to save another is at the centre of these images and symbols. I will begin by taking the apocalypse as described in the Book of Revelation and refer it to the images and references that appear in ‘Ryan.\n\nApocalyptic Visions & Characters\n\nThe biblical Apocalypse did not actually take place, rather it appeared to the author John in a dream or a vision. It is a message for mankind. In apocalyptic visions, the seer is both confused and ultimately instructed by what he sees (Barr 1998) therefore the ultimate revelation is the understanding of the vision. Also according to Barr, an apocalyptic revelation doesn’t provide new information, instead it re-interprets the information available, sheding new light on how to perceive the world. ‘Ryan has been praised on its realistic depiction of the war, but there are two sequences within the movie that lie outside this realm of realism. These are sequences that appear to Captain Miller during the first and last battles in moments of most importance. I believe these can be classed as Miller’s apocalyptic visions. Even Millers first name of John can be seen as a reference to his visionary status. The sequences seem to take place outside reality, in stylised slow motion with muted sounds. In the final battle, as Miller and Reiben run the explosive wire away from the bridge, the building beside the bridge explodes, injuring Miller. When he gets up, he is bleeding and partially deaf due to the explosion. In slow motion he looks around him in a dazed, dream like state. In front of him he sees Reiben, calling for his help. He looks across the river to a U.S. soldier fighting with the Nazis. The soldier punches the Nazi then hits him with his helmet. As more Germans come the soldier tries to flee, only to be caught and beaten (presumably to death) with the end of their rifles. He sees Private Ryan, the innocent, his knees close to his chest, rocking back and forth and screaming in terror as the bombs and bullets fly. Then he sees the body of Horvath lying lifeless. This “vision” ends when Reiben grabs Miller and drags him to safety beside Horvath. Just like an apocalyptic vision, Miller appears confused. He looks down at the body of Horvath, another of his men who have sacrificed their lives for the cause. Finally he looks over and sees the detonator lying in the middle of the road. He realises that in order to stop more people from dying, he must get the detonator, even if it means sacrificing his own life.\n\nThe sacrifice made by Miller is a linchpin in the discussion of martyrdom within ‘Ryan. In the next chapter I will discuss the role of Miller as a Christ figure in more detail. But within the apocalyptic imagery, he very much represents the Christ in the form of the slaughtered Lamb (Rev. 5:6). The Lamb is the only one who can see God and the only one who can open the sealed book (Kovacs and Rowland 2004), bringing about the end of days. There is also a link between the Lamb and the Lion. These appear to be opposing characteristics, the Lamb representing innocence, meekness while the Lion representing aggression and strength. In the Book of Revelation, they are one and the same, representing two characteristics of Christ; sacrifice and conquering might. In Rev. 5:5-10, the Lion has conquered, to open the scroll but it is the Lamb, through sacrifice who actually opens it. The Hal Lyndsay (in Resseguie 1998) states that Jesus came to earth first as the Lamb, willing to sacrifice himself fot the sins of man, but in his second coming he will return with the strength and power of the lion. Resseguie (1998:133) himself suggests that “John’s juxtaposition of the lion and the lamb forges a new definition of victory: the way to conquest is by sacrificial death”.\n\nThe Lamb is the ultimate symbol of sacrifice, but it also represents the ultimate victory that will take place because of this sacrifice: “they have conquered him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they did not cling to life even in the face of death” (Rev. 12:11). In ‘Ryan, Miller sacrifices himself at the end of the movie in order to save the rest of his platoon. Shortly before his death, while he is critically wounded, allied bomber planes fly over, defeating the oncoming Nazi’s. If we are to take Miller as the Lamb, then these planes can be seen as him returning in a new form as the Lion to ensure the victory through his sacrifice. The apocalyptic images of the Lamb and the Lion are not just present within the movie they, in fact, play a very important role in the plot, just as they did in the Book of Revelation itself.\n\nAnother character from Revelation that is depicted in ‘Ryan is Private Daniel Jackson. Jackson is unequivocally a depiction of the archangel Michael. Archangel Michael is one of the foremost angels mentioned in the Bible. He is known as “one of the chief princes”(Dan 10:13) and plays a significant role in the Book of Revelation. It was foretold in Dan 12 that, at the time of the end of the world, Michael, “the great prince, the protector of your people, shall arise”. And in ‘Ryan, it is very much the case that Jackson is the most active of the troop, always eager to fight. In fact, he confirms his biblical mission when he says that “God gave me a special gift, made me a fine instrument of warfare”. Newman (2006) uses this to illustrate Jacksons recognition and willing response to the Christian Calling. In that respect, Jackson is the most vocally religious member of the squad. Whenever he takes aim in battle he quotes bible verse to calm himself. One of the more interesting quotes is his use of Psalms 144:1-2: “Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, and my fingers for battle; my rock and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer, my shield”. Jacksons stronghold is always a church tower, from which he rains judgment on the Nazi’s below. This is ultimately signified in one particular shot (fig 1.) in the last battle. It is a low angle shot from the ground up to the tower, where Jackson awaits the Nazis. Jackson himself is framed in one of two arched windows which calls to mind the religious panel paintings such as “The Ghent Altarpiece” (See Appendix A) In the foreground is a partially destroyed statue. The statue’s hand is outstretched, but missing what would have been a sword and looks in the same direction as Jackson. The missing sword is important as one of the major images of St. Michael is his depiction with a sword as commander of God’s army. Taking the mise-en-scene of this shot into account, the message of this image is clear, Private Jackson and St. Michael are one.\n\nFig 1.\n\nSeven, Seven, Seven\n\nThe number seven appears a multitude of times in the Book of Revelation. The number itself denotes completeness or fullness and subesquently the whole christian church (Ryken et al. 1998, Seiss 2007). In ‘Ryan, Miller’s platoon consists of seven soldiers. They represent a complete cohesive group; a whole which is slowly deconstructed as the film progresses. But let us take the various uses of seven within the book. These soldiers, as representatives of the various seven’s offer a deeper insight into the film.\n\nTaking that Miller is the Lamb, Rev 5:6 describes him as having “seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out to all the earth”. The horns are symbols of strength and aggression while the eyes are symbols of wisdom and knowledge (Seiss Ibid:116), but I would also put a literal interpretation on the eye; that of sight. Miller’s platoon very much represent these two symbols. As horns they are his tools of attack, of aggression, but also as eyes they give Miller sight, often literally in that they can see what he cannot. I am thinking here particularly of Private Jackson who, from his snipers position, can see where the enemies are and relay that information to Miller on the ground. According to Seiss, the horns and eyes themselves represent the seven spirits of God, which are described in Isaiah 11. In many respects, the individual soldiers also represent these spirits. “The spirit of the Lord shall rest on him, the spirit of wisdom [Private Reiben] and understanding [Medic Wade], the spirit of counsel [Sergaent Horvath] and might [Private Caparzo], the spirit of knowledge [Corporal Upham] and the fear of the Lord [Private Mellish]. His delight shall be in the fear of the Lord [Jackson]”.\n\nThe platoon itself is the “old keepsake of World War II films: the ethnically, religiously, regionally and socially diverse platoon.”(Auster 2002:102). Not only that, their personalities run the gamut from shy and bookish to confident and aggressive and as such, allows the audience to relate and connect these different characters, seeing ourselves in them. As stated above seven is the number of completeness, the four corners of the earth plus the holy trinity. As such these seven soldiers can also be seen to represent the seven churches (Rev 1:20). While the names of the seven churches are named (Rev 1:11), they truly represent the “complete Christian body, of all time and all place” (Seiss 2007:37), that is, humanity.\n\nThe most important, and most widely known aspect of Revelation is the breaking of the seven seals (Rev 5:1), which leads to the apocalypse . These are some of the most recognisable images from the apocalypse and have had numerous cinematic representations, such as The Seventh Seal (1957) and The Seventh Sign (1988), cementing their place in the social and cultural consciousness. As we have seen above, the platoon of seven soldiers can represent many versions of the number seven in Revelation, but I believe that it is in their capacity as signifiers of the seven seals that they have their most important role. The representations above only serve to strengthen this argument, for as the seven seals, their opening/death does not only move use closer to the apocalypse, it also means the destruction of wisdom, knowledge and guidance of God (in the seven spirits) as well as the destruction of humanity (the seven churches).\n\nWhat is inherent in the opening of the seven seals is the idea of a countdown; an impending disaster and apocalypse that gets closer and closer as each seal is opened. In ‘Ryan, as each soldier is killed, the mission becomes all the more dangerous. What started out as a public relations mission to save one soldier is costing the lives of others. Private Caparzo is killed while trying to save a young french girl who reminds him of his niece. The soldiers are disturbed by his death and the mission takes on a more sinister tone. Then medic Wade is critically wounded, opening another seal. This death is all the more poignant because they remaining soldiers have to euthanize Wade themselves; actively being involved in the death of one of their own. This amplifies the danger brings us closer to the apocalypse. The result of Wade’s death is platoon almost being torn apart. As Corporal Upham says in disbelief, “What is going on?”; the world as he knows it is changing. No more soldiers die for a time, but the tension is inherent; we never know when the next seal will be opened. It is then in the final, apocalyptic battle that the next seal is opened. First Private Jackson dies in the bell tower, the Private Mellish (in a highly disturbing scene) dies a slow, torturous death and the hands of a Nazi soldier. The sudden shock of Jackson’s death and the prolonged murder of Mellish both act to amplify the sense of dread. Not only that, it leaves the ending ambigously uncertain. We do not know for sure that they will succeed; they may all die before the end of the movie. But as with most cinematic representations of the apocalypse, the apocalypse never arrives. It is always deferred at the last minute. While four of the seals have been opened, and we witness many apocalyptic images, two of the seals remain sealed, that is, two of the soldiers survive the apocalypse.\n\nApocalyptic Plagues\n\nIn Revelation, after the seventh seal is opened, God gives the angels Seven Trumpets, following the blowing of the Seventh Trumpet, seven angels are given seven bowls that contain the wrath of god. There is evidence of these bowls within ‘Ryan in the form of plague imagery. In the next chapter they will be discussed in relation to Moses and the plagues of Egypt, but there is also much to suggest a simultaneously apocalyptic relevance. Runions (2003:139) in his article on Magnolia, reads the exodus imagery of the falling frogs in an apocalyptic light. He sees the film as “using the exodus imagery apocalyptically (…) building on the resistant premise of the exodus to suggest the same for its own apocalyptical themes”. It is an exodus from sin that is used here. ‘Ryan can similarly be read as an exodus from sin We can read the exodus themes in ‘Ryan as an exodus from sin. The path of this exodus, in line with the apocalypse and the seven seals, is redemption through self sacrifice.\n\nThe first plague takes place after the opening battle, in a long tracking shot along the beach. As we move along the waters edge, the waves crash onto the beach; over the bodies of dead soldiers and hundreds dead fish. These shots are interesting because, while they show the devastation, the presence of the dead fish alongside the soldiers appears inexplicable. However from a biblical viewpoint, this scene not only refers to Exodus 7:14-25, but also Rev. 16:3-4 where the angels pour two of the seven bowls into the rivers and oceans, turning them blood red and killing all the fish. It’s presence at the beginning of the film is also significant, for the water turning red is the first of the plagues of Egypt and one of the first of the seven bowls.\n\nIn Ex. 9:8-12, Moses unleashes the plague of incurable boils, while in Rev. 16:2, painful sores are the consequence of the first bowl. “Boil” is a translation of the word “shkhin” which means a skin disease. While there are no boils in the movie, there are other skin diseases, one in particular that is very specific to the wartime environment; gangrene. Another war equivalent of the plague image is that of hail and fire (Ex. 9:13-35) which comes in the form of the air bombings that take place throughout the film, specifically while they are resting in the abandoned church. The final plague occurs in the appearance of the field of dead cattle where medic Wade is killed. Given the mise-en-scene of this sequence, the appearance of the rotting corpses stands-out. Indeed it is reminiscent of the death of livestock in experienced in Ex. 9:1-7. The existence of these images with the diegetic of the film further illustrate the overall apocalyptic themes in the film. In fact, these plagues can be seen as the “plagues of war”; the wrath of god and the punishment for enslaving and torturing his fellow man.\n\nThe story of the apocalypse is, at it’s most basic, a retelling of the story of Jesus (Barr 1998). The most significant aspect of the Jesus story is that of his willing sacrifice for mankind and his ultimate victory over the forces of evil.\n\nAccording to Seiss(2007:112), the seven seals are indicative of the bonds that separate man from god; “the bonds of forfeit which have all this while debarred Adam’s seed from their proper inheritance”. And it is the breaking of these seals that beget our ultimate redemption and movement back to God. Accordingly, the sealed book is not a symbol of revelation of apocalypse; it is in face a symbol of redemption. If we are to then to take soldiers as representatives of the seals, among their other important significations, we can see therefore that each sacrifice; each opening of the seal, in essence, brings us one step closer to the redemption of mankind. This indicates that through our own willing martyrdom in life, we are move closer and closer to God, which is an extraordinarily powerful and evocative idea to present through film.\n\nLord of War: Captain Miller as Christ/ Moses Figure\n\n“Live your life in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that, whether I come and see you or am absent and hear about you, I will know that you are standing firm in one spirit, striving side by side with one mind for the faith of the gospel” (Philippians 1:27)\n\n“Earn this!” Captain John Miller, Saving Private Ryan\n\nWhile the above biblical quote does not come directly from Jesus, rather from St. Paul’s letter to the Philippians, it still resonates strongly with the ultimate message given to Private Ryan, that is, to live your life well; be a good man and earn the sacrifice that has been made for you. Just like Jesus, Captain Miller has sacrificed his life for others, and now we must live our lives accordingly, to prove that the sacrifice was worth it. In the previous chapter I have briefly discussed Miller as the sacrificial Lamb of the Book of Revelations, in his capacity as a Christ figure. I will now outline further proof of this theory.\n\nIt is of utmost importance that, rather than simply identifying Captain Miller as a Christ-figure, we must also relate it to the context of the film itself. As Deacy states, we must investigate how this interpretation affects our understanding of the film, “Does it enable us to apprehend the issues and themes delineated in the picture in a fresh and creative light?” (2006:11) That is why, within this analysis, the plot and themes of the film will be examined in relation to the interpretation of Miller as a Christ-figure. I believe that the mission given to Miller, that is, to sacrifice his life to save one man, is truly analogous of Christ’s mission. Without this parallel, the film would be less effective as a moral parable.\n\nBut there is also much to suggest Captain Miller possess qualities that could be associated with Moses. His mission also echoes the mission of Moses, that is, to free the slaves from tyrannical oppression. However, there is a certain amount of ambiguity when it comes to characterizing a Moses-figure, due in large part to the fact that many of his characteristics are analogous of the Christ-figure. In fact, when Cecil B. DeMille made his famous “Ten Commandments”, he actively exploited these similarities. As Koslovic (2006:1) states “One of the secrets of their still resonating power was the sub-textual engineering of his protagonist as Christ-figures.” There is also biblical precedent for the association of Jesus and Moses (John 5:46-47). Within the bible, there is an undeniable mirroring within the stories of Moses and Jesus, albeit with Jesus operating in a higher and more divine capacity (Heb. 3:3). This has to be taken into account when analysing figures as both Christ and Moses. That being said, etymologically, the word “Christ” comes from the Ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew “mashiach”, which means “anointed one” or “chosen one”. Since Moses, at the time, was the anointed or chosen one, he can therefore be classified as a Christ-Figure.\n\nCaptain Miller as Christ-Figure:\n\nThe final shot of ‘Ryan acts as ultimate and unequivocal proof of the Christic nature of Captain Miller, and is thus the perfect place to begin the analysis. The scenes in graveyard, both at the beginning and the end of the film appear to bookend this biblical tale. Among the vast fields of marble crosses we find an elderly Private Ryan, responded to Miller’s dying dictum, letting Miller know that he tried to be a good man, tried to earn the sacrifice of his friends. As he walks away we see a close-up of the cross. Central in the screen and flanked on either side by the crosses of other men who sacrificed their lives, we see the name etched on the cross: Captain John H. Miller.\n\nBut let us return to the beginning, the first time we see Captain Miller: on the landing craft with his men, heading for the shoreline and an uncertain future. As we pull away from a close-up of his face, we notice that he stands in the centre of the boat, while the others soldiers are polarized to his left and right, framing him (fig.2), indicating both his higher position and his separation, both are aspects of Koslovic’s 25 characteristics (2004). One could also say that it was analogous of Leonardo Da Vinci’s Last Supper, with Jesus in the centre and his apostles to either side. This argument is furthered shortly after the opening battle sequence; in the famous scene of the soldiers walking over the hill (fig.3). Again Miller is central, with his men flanking him on either side. As Miller is seen coming over the hill, the sun begins to shine through the clouds. Whether deliberate or not, it suggests a Christic nature; Jesus: “Light of the World” (John 9:5).\n\nFig. 2\n\nFig. 3\n\nMiller’s salvic nature is seen on two occasions within the opening battle. On these two occasions he attempts to rescue/ protect a younger soldier. In the first instance he drags a soldier onshore from the boat, only to have him be killed on the shoreline. Moments later, he saves another injured soldier, dragging him, this time, through the sand. On this occasion the soldier is dismembered by an artillery shell. Within the space of five minutes, Miller has twice put his own life on the line to save one single soldier. These two failed attempts at salvation not only offer further examples of Miller’s dedication to saving man but also foreshadow the salvic mission that drives the plot of the movie. While the ultimate and final sacrifice of the Christ-figure is noted as a characteristic by Koslovic (2004), we must always remember that Christ performed many salvic acts before his death and thus a characteristic of a Christ-figure should also be a series of salvic deeds.\n\nWhat is also interesting is the use of close-ups throughout the movie, particularly the close-ups of Miller. They are very often tight on Miller’s face and emphasize his blue eyes. Blue is symbolizes “divine, of truth and of fidelity” (Matthews 1990:25), but also blue is the colour as the sky, which represents “the boundary between God and his people” (Ryken et al. 1998). Christ being both divine and human[5] represents this boundary. Moreso, these close-ups are part of shot-reverse shot sequence that highlights an un-discussed aspect of the Christ-figure; that of the gaze of God (Psalms 11:4). In these sequences, Miller-as-Christ watches events unfold before him. The close-ups are often from a low angle, indicating Miller “looking down” upon the world. The first of these sequences takes place just after the opening battle, where Miller stands high atop the hill, overlooking the beach. In this shot-reverse shot, he surveys the destruction below, quipping cynically “Quite a view.” A few moments later we have a reoccurrence of this sequence. In this one, Miller looks on judgingly at two American soldiers who, after shooting the surrendering Germans, proceed to mock their corpses. A further example would be the two important action sequences that use slow-motion, one at the beginning and the other in the final battle; the “apocalyptic visions” as discussed previously.\n\nOne of the more important characteristics of a Christ-figure, or at least one of the most well recognized, is the presence of twelve followers; twelve apostles. In the case of Miller, his apostles are his soldiers. While at the beginning of the film they are numerous, by the start of the mission they have been reduced to “the pick of the litter”, his seven best men who will accompany him on his divine mission, a mission being the “raison d’être for the Christ figure’s arrival” (Koslovic 2004:32). And it is a divine mission, “straight from the top”, U.S. army Chief George C. Marshall (the equivalent of God to Miller’s Christ). But while the number of apostles is of little importance, their function is essentially to give the indication of a group of dedicated followers and to “set the scene and glorify the Christ-figure.” (Koslovic 2004:38) In essence, these seven soldiers can represent the twelve apostles or a hundred disciples; as long as they help identify the Christ figure. This is shown perfectly in the scene in which Captain Miller spares the life of a Nazi officer.\n\nHalfway through the film, the soldiers have already lost Private Caparzo (Vin Diesel) and are no closer to finding Private Ryan. On the way to the town of Ramelle, they come across a Nazi machine gun post and Miller orders them to neutralize it. This is beyond the scope of their mission, but Miller reminds them of the higher mission of defeating the Nazi’s. Following the skirmish, medic officer Wade (Giovanni Ribisi) is critically wounded and the soldiers are forced to euthanize him. There is one surviving Nazi soldier who surrenders, yet the soldiers are out for vengeance. They prepare to shoot the unarmed soldier, similar to the surrendering Nazi soldiers shot at the beginning of the film. But while Miller looked on in judgment at the previous soldiers, here he acts equally human, seeking vengeance for the death of Wade. It is only Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies) who pleads with Miller stop his squad killing the German. This may suggest that Upham has the ear of Miller, possibly linking him to Saint Peter. There is much to suggest that either Corporal Upham or Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore) could be identified as Peter figure; both occupy a prominent position in relation to Captain Miller; both share moments of private consultation with him and appear to be the two most loyal characters. However I would also like to suggest Upham as a John figure. Like Peter, John was close to Jesus. What differentiates Upham from Horvath is that Upham is a writer, just like John who wrote many of the biblical texts. But in this scene, Upham acts more as Millers conscience, reminding him of his divine power over the life of this man.\n\nMiller isolates himself from his men in order to allow himself time for private reflection. This is a very Christ-like act, for Jesus often took time alone for reflection. The subsequent scene begins with a wide shot of Miller sitting on the edge of the bunker (fig. 4a). It is a low angled shot which, as stated earlier, is repeated throughout the film and emphasizes Miller’s higher position. From the background, he is framed by the white sky on the left, and framework of metal on the right. Symbolically, the white sky represents his Christic nature; the good, compassionate side, his divine nature, while the dark metal represents his darker, more human urges, the wish for revenge. Compositionally the “dark side” occupies more of the background, while Miller still rests in the area of the sky, the torn edges of the metal tearing into the sky. It is as if Miller wants to be divinely compassionate, but his more human urges are encroaching; like the skyline he is torn. Wanting to hide his inner turmoil from his followers, he sinks down into the bunker, just as he sinks further into inner conflict. The camera slowly tracks closer and lower to Miller as he sinks down (fig. 4b), which has the dual effect of bringing the audience deeper into his conflict while also raising Miller to an even higher position. Perhaps it is his conscious struggle with evil that raises him to this level. As he breaks down into tears, he clasps his hands tightly, not only to calm himself, but also in a silent prayer (fig. 4c). As the camera moves even closer and even lower, it begins to slowly pan around Miller. This panning brings a change in perspective and a change in the background. The skyscape becomes more prevalent, slowly surrounding the mesh. There is a cut to a close up of Miller’s face (fig. 4d). The shot itself is only at a slightly different angle than the previous shot. The only difference is that now there is no sign of the metal behind Miller. His face is surrounded by sky and trees and he appears determined, strong enough to battle and defeat his darker urges.\n\nFig. 4a\n\nFig. 4b\n\nFig. 4c\n\nFig. 4d\n\nAs the German soldier digs the grave for Wade, the remaining men stand over him, guns drawn. There is something very biblical about this image; the avenging angels, judging the Nazi and ready to punish him for his sins. Having reached his decision, Miller lets the soldier live, provided he surrenders to the next Allied platoon he encounters. This infuriates the other members of the platoon, who are prepared and anxious to kill the Nazi. Private Reiben (Edward Burns) bears all the hallmarks of a “doubting” Thomas figure. From the very beginning he is at odds with the mission, questioning Miller on numerous occasions about the validity and human cost to saving one man, as well as Miller’s leadership skills and at this point, he no longer believes in either. He threatens to go AWOL from the platoon. Guns are drawn and it appears that the platoon is being torn apart. Upham screams at Miller, asking him “Why are you letting this happen?” a question many Christians ask of Christ when bad things happen. And just like Christ, Miller diffuses the situation without violence, through a story. His monologue echoes a Jesus parable with its simplicity and meaning. In this parable Miller finally reveals his true identity, rather than his “alter-ego” (Koslovic 2004:33-34). For John H. Miller, his alter-ego is not his life back in America, but his life in the army as Captain Miller, commanding officer of the C Company, 2nd Ranger Battalion. John was a teacher, just like Jesus (Mark 1:21, Matt 4:23, Luke 5:17). His story is open and honest. He says what everyone else is thinking, “giving voice to the rage and fear that chokes and confuses those whom they [the Christ-figures] aid.”(Nichols 2000:9). John Miller is not fighting for the glory and heroics of the battlefield. He is fighting for a just cause and the chance to go home to his wife and live in peace.\n\nThe ultimate legacy of Christ was his sacrifice for mankind. And just like Christ, Miller sacrifices himself for Private Ryan. This is a microcosm of the death of Jesus, for Ryan is not merely one man, he represents all of mankind, all the men, women and children who survived the war thanks to the sacrifice of others. And the sacrifice of Miller is very much a willing one. As Koslovic (ibid:17) says “dying is the best thing they can do, and they really want to do it, usually against the protests of loving others.” Miller watches as Horvath is shot and injured. He looks over and sees Ryan curled in a ball crying. The Germans are approaching the bridge the platoon had sworn to protect. Miller leaves his place of safety in the bunker and walks into the firing line to pick up the detonator, fully aware that he will be killed. It is also important to note that one of his killers in the German soldier he had previously given salvation to, which strongly echoes Jesus’ death at the hands of those he had saved.\n\nJust moments before Miller dies, Allies bomber planes attack and destroy the advancing German army. Miller calls them the “angels on our shoulders”, HIS angels coming to ensure victory. This echoes the destruction that occurred in the moments following the death of Jesus, outlined in Matt 27:51 but is also one of Koslovic’s characteristics of Christ figures, namely that the death results in a triumphal victory, however pyrrhic. “Such a perceived loss is usually considered one-off, extraordinary and purposeful” (ibid:49). Even though Miller had expressed the longing to go home to his wife, he realized that it is impossible; he cannot go home. The war has changed him and now he wonders “if I’ve changed so much that my wife isn’t going to recognize me (…) every man I kill the farther away from home I feel”. Miller does not fear death; he willingly accepts his fate and his death is tinged with a certain amount of relief. His surviving men try to keep him alive, particularly Ryan and the reformed Reiben, but with his death, just like the death of Christ, we witness the ultimate sacrifice that echoes John 15:13 “No one has greater love than this, to lay down ones life for one’s friend”\n\nCaptain Miller as Moses-Figure:\n\nAs stated in the beginning, Captain Miller is a prime example of the Christ-figure. However he also appears to have secondary characteristics that associate him with the Moses figure. As with the Christ-figure, these characteristics cannot be superfluous to the overall reading of the film; they must help in our understanding of the text.\n\nIn Exodus 2:11-15, Moses is forced to leave Egypt, where he works as a humble shepherd until God calls him to return to Egypt and free the Hebrews from slavery (Exodus 3). As stated earlier, one of the missions of Miller was to free Europe from tyranny. In that example it identified Miller as a Christ in the form of “Liberator of Slaves”. However, just as DeMille did in “The Ten Commandments”, this liberation can be associated with Moses as the liberator of the Egyptian enslaved Hebrews (Koslovic 2006). Miller , like most Americans, is descended from European immigrants; people who have been forced leave their homeland by either for political or economic reasons. And just like Moses, they have been called to return there by a higher power (again the U.S. army) in order to liberate their homeland from tyranny.\n\nFurther identification with the Moses character occurs with the presence of the plagues. There are not ten individually identifiable references within the movie, but there does not need to be. Rather there are a select few, seen within the framework of the war movie, that provide the analogy: the water turning blood red (Ex. 7:14-25), the death of livestock (Ex 9:1-7), the boils in the form of gangrene (Ex. 9:8-12) and the presence of hail and fire (Ex. 9:13-35).These have been discussed in the first chapter in reference to the apocalypse, but they can offer dual meanings. Here they can be read as referents to the plagues of Egypt.\n\nThe final battle and the plan to blow up the bridge are very reminiscent of the story of Moses and the parting of the Red Sea. If the Nazi’s begin to cross the river, the bridge will collapse, sending them to their death in the water below. Finally, in Miller’s death, he fulfills the myth of Moses. While his surviving men (and humanity) can continue the journey towards peace and freedom, Miller is unable to go on with them, just like Moses is unable to enter the “promised land” with his people.\n\nWhether Moses or Christ, Captain Miller’s journey is one of salvation and self-sacrifice for a greater good. Taken within the context of the movie, these characteristics are affirmations of the higher calling of fighting for a just cause. We are emotionally invested in Captain Miller for the very reasons stated above: his compassion towards the enemy, his all-so-human struggle with the tasks that have been given to him, his willingness to die for a cause he believes in. We do not necessarily mourn his death. We admire his strength in belief and self-sacrifice. The representation of Miller as Christ therefore asks the audience to see death in war as a biblical sacrifice for freedom.\n\nThe deaths of Miller and his apostles (and all those who died in the war) glorifies war as it “reminds viewers that sacrificial slaughter is indeed meaningful after all” (Sharrett 1998:37), that is, it reaffirms the act of martyrdom as an exalted deed. But I will conclude with the same scene I began with: Captain John H. Miller on the cross. The shot fades to an American flag, billowing in the breeze, identifying Miller as not just a Christ figure, but an American Christ figure, representing all that is good and true about the country.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the theme of martyrdom is apparent in the images and representations discussed in this paper, it is made explicitely clear in the movie when General George C. Marshall reads aloud the famous Bixby Letter[8] (See Appendix B), written by Abraham Lincoln to the mother of five sons who lost their lives in the American Civil War. The letter states that it is Lincoln’s hope that:\n\n“our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom”.\n\nIt is therefore stated at the outset of the movie that biblical martyrdom and the strength of conviction to sacrifice yourself is a virtue that should be extolled. This is the myth that surrounds the act of martyrdom. As stated earlier, the ideology of martyrdom is extremely powerful, and at a time where pro and anti-war debates rage on, “the symbolic power of the martyr often exceeds argument itself and can thereby short circuit disputation and debate” (Castelli 2006:2), that is, the conviction of the martyr that willingly “pays the ultimate price” for their cause makes it almost impossible to argument against. Within the realm of war this is very apparent. The dead soldiers are eulogized as martyrs to the great cause of a nation, freedom and a way of life. As with Christian martyrs, the sacrifice of soldiers serves to strengthen resolve during times of persecution. The death of soldiers often serves to unite a country and strengthen resolve to defeat the enemy, to “convince and reassure”(ibid:18), just as the attack on Pearl Harbour did for America in World War 2. In retelling these stories of martyrdom on the battlefield, cinema is, in fact, a modern version of the “passios” or passion tales (Sanders 2007). The purpose of these tales is to “make the saint present to the living once again” (ibid: 348). In terms of the cinematic representation of war, these passios reaffirm the theory of a “just war” and the heroicism and glory of a willing sacrifice, especially in times of waning belief for the cause, for example, after the Vietnam and Gulf Wars.\n\nTraditionally Moses is seen as the liberator of the Hebrews. Miller as a Moses figure becomes the liberator of the Europe and by-proxy, the U.S. retains its image as a powerful force for good. This, along with the ultimate sacrifice of the Christ-figure is a biblical theme that resonates in modern day war films. It endorses soldiering as a biblical “calling” (Newman 2006); a duty that is above all else.\n\nIn one particular scene, a messenger is shot by the Nazi’s. Even though he is on the ground they continue firing. This angers Caparzo but Miller calms him down, stating that they do the same thing to their men. Furthermore he explains that, as long as he has breath in his lungs he still carried the message. I believe that this have strong relations to the biblical martyrdom, for the martyrs carried the message of Christ and it was for that reason that they were persecuted.\n\nAppendix A: The Ghent Altarpiece, Jan Van Eyck 1432\n\nAppendix B: Letter to Mrs. Bixby\n\nExecutive Mansion,\n\nWashington, Nov. 21, 1864.\n\nDear Madam,\n\nI have been shown in the files of the War Department a statement of the Adjutant General of Massachusetts that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle.\n\nI feel how weak and fruitless must be any word of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the Republic they died to save.\n\nI pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.\n\nYours, very sincerely and respectfully,\n\nA.
