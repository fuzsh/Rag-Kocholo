        "text": "I. Academic Integrity\n\nAcademic integrity is essential to maintaining an environment that fosters excellence in educational and scholarly activities.\n\nThe following behaviors infringe upon academic integrity and will be subject to disciplinary action:\n\nA. Plagiarism: the theft of words, ideas, or other original material of another person or source, in whole or in part, and passing it off as your own. Any knowledge that is new to you must be cited. Plagiarism may be intentional or unintentional. Be careful. Take time to cite your sources and you will not have a problem. If you are not sure, check with your teacher.\n\nThis includes:\n\nthe work of classmates or other students both past and present\n\ntext generated or modified by AI (regardless of the software program or platform)\n\npurchasing or otherwise obtaining the written work of others\n\nthe uncredited use (both intentional and unintentional) of someone else’s words or ideas\n\nparaphrasing words, ideas, or other original material without acknowledging the source material\n\nself-plagiarism, which is the resubmission of one’s previously graded work from another course without the teacher’s permission\n\nTo ensure that your work is authentic, all formal writing assignments must be\n\nsubmitted to TurnItIn, which will generate a similarity report. This similarity report will be used in evaluating the authenticity of student work.\n\nUnauthorized Collaboration: to act or consult with another person on individually assigned work. When the instructor assigns individual work, collaboration with others is prohibited. If clarification of the expectations is needed, reach out to your teacher.\n\nB. Cheating: to act dishonestly or unfairly in the completion of an assignment or assessment. This includes:\n\nlooking at someone else’s work during the completion of an assessment or assignment\n\nconversing during the completion of an assessment\n\ngiving or receiving information about as assessment\n\neferencing unauthorized material, including electronic devices\n\nDisciplinary Action\n\nA. Plagiarism will result in a grade of zero for the assignment and mandatory recompletion of the assignment for partial-credit. The zero received for the original assignment will remain in place. Plagiarism will be reported to the Assistant Principal for further disciplinary action.\n\nB. Unauthorized Collaboration will result in a grade of zero for all participants and will be reported to the Assistant Principal for further disciplinary action.\n\nC. Cheating will result in a grade of zero and will be reported to the Assistant Principal for further disciplinary action.\n\nAlso inspired by “Academic Integrity at Princeton.” Princeton University, 2020,\n\nhttps://odoc.princeton.edu/sites/odoc/files/Academic%20Integrity%20Booklet%202020-21.pdf. Accessed March 1, 2021\n\nII. Anti-Harassment and Anti-Discrimination Policy\n\nAll members of the Nardin Community are expected to uphold the rights and well-being of others. Violating the rights or infringing on the well-being of others, whether targeting specific individuals or not, is unacceptable. Injury or harm can occur in interactions between any members of the Nardin Community, but Nardin is mindful of the impact that these forms of misconduct may have on historically marginalized groups. The school examines any conduct targeting individuals and groups protected under state and federal law with particular scrutiny.\n\nHarassment (Including Sexual Harassment)\n\nAll members of the Nardin Community have the right to be free from all forms of harassment. Harassment entails behavior that is unwelcome; that is personally offensive or threatening; and that has the effect of harming morale, interfering with an individual’s education, or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive learning environment. Sexual harassment refers to sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and physical or expressive conduct of a sexual nature that is unwanted and uninvited. Whether it manifests itself verbally, non-verbally or physically, Nardin Academy will not tolerate unwelcome, offensive and targeted harassment of any individual.\n\nHazing\n\nHazing is an act or series of acts that persecutes or harasses individual(s) with difficult, humiliating, and sometimes dangerous tasks, and/or involves the forced consumption of liquor or drugs for the purposes of initiation into or affiliation with a group of individuals. It is Nardin’s policy that these activities are outside the context of a positive learning environment and are strictly prohibited.\n\nBullying\n\nBullying refers to a single significant incident or a pattern of incidents involving written, verbal or electronic communications, or physical acts or gestures, or any combination thereof, directed by one or more students at another student, when such incidents physically harm a student or damage the student’s property, cause emotional distress to a student, interfere with a student’s educational opportunity, create a hostile educational environment, or substantially disrupt the operation of the school. Bullying typically involves a real or perceived imbalance of power based on a student’s actual or perceived personal characteristics, behaviors or beliefs, or motivated by the student’s association with another person and based on the other person’s characteristics, behaviors or beliefs. Also prohibited in this policy is cyberbullying, a form of bullying that is conducted through cell phones, computers, email, instant messaging, text messaging, social media, and other electronic media. Additionally, Nardin Academy considers catfishing, or the manipulation of an individual into a relationship by means of a fictional online persona, as bullying.\n\nDiscrimination\n\nDiscrimination refers to unjust, prejudicial conduct or behavior or differential treatment of an individual based on the individual’s race, color, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, ableness or any other protected category. Discrimination is prohibited at Nardin Academy not only because it is unlawful, but because it is inherently wrong and in direct conflict with the mission of Nardin’s founders, the Daughters of the Heart of Mary. More than 160 years ago, the DHM founded a school that provides a safe and socially just environment to learn, collaborate and lead.\n\nRetaliation\n\nNardin prohibits all forms of retaliation. Retaliation is any form of intimidation, bullying or harassment directed against a Nardin Community member who reports unlawful harassment (including sexual harassment), hazing, bullying, discrimination, or hate speech, or who provides information during an investigation of these types of reports.\n\nReporting Violations\n\nNardin strongly encourages all members of its community to report violations of its anti-harassment and anti-discrimination policy. Individuals who have concerns they may have experienced or witnessed one of the above discussed violations should bring her concerns to the principal, assistant principal, a counselor, or any faculty member. Once administration is made aware of an incident, it will take prompt and appropriate action.\n\nAdditional Steps for Students\n\nDiscrimination, harassment, or bullying of any student based on any factor of their identity: race, ethnicity, religion, gender, ableness or sexual orientation, etc., requires several extra steps to be taken to ensure all students, regardless of their identity, receive equal treatment among their peers. This (in addition to the established bullying policy) will ensure students feel protected at school:\n\nWhen a student is reporting an incident, they have the right to request that a faculty member of their choice be present (aside from the administrator receiving the report).\n\nAny student also reserves the right to bring a friend to accompany them in making a report, to act as both a companion and as a witness.\n\nWhen a student reports any incident of discrimination, the administrator receiving said report will create an evidentiary document and mark it with the following information: the date on which the incident occurred; the date on which the report was made; the name of the student making the report; the name of the student, faculty member, or other community member being reported; the administrator receiving and documenting the report; the decided course of action; and the date which will occur 20 days after the initial incident.\n\nAs well as the disciplinary measures taken in accordance with Nardin’s policy against bullying, the student who perpetrated the discriminatory incident must engage in an appropriate course of education to prevent them from repeating the offense in the future. For example, if a student makes a racist comment to another student, the incident could perhaps require the offending student to produce a verbal or written apology, as well as pursue mandated anti-racism education. Materials for this education, whether they be prescribed reading, watching, listening, or a required course, will be determined in conjunction with the school’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee.\n\n20 days after the initial incident, the student has the right to call a meeting with administrators, with their parent(s) or guardian(s) present, to determine whether they feel there has been suitable action taken for closure.\n\n*Changes made in conjunction with the officers of Challenging Injustice In Society.\n\nDisciplinary Procedures\n\nIn the event that Nardin receives a complaint of harassment (including sexual harassment), hazing, bullying, discrimination, hate speech, or retaliation, or otherwise has reason to believe that it has occurred, Nardin will conduct a fair, timely, and thorough investigation. Nardin is committed, and required by law, to take action if it learns of potentially unlawful harassment, discrimination or retaliation, even if the aggrieved party does not wish to formally file a report. All reports will be investigated whether the information was reported orally or in writing. Complaints will be handled confidentially to the extent permitted by a fair investigation and as required by law. While the methods of investigation may vary depending on the severity of the conduct, all will involve the following steps:\n\nEach party involved will meet individually with the principal or designee. The assistant principal for student affairs and/or other discipline staff may also participate in the meeting when requested to do so by the principal.\n\nThe meeting will be documented as each involved party gives their statement of what happened. Any additional information (e.g., previous issues with the parties involved) will also be discussed and documented.\n\nAssistance and support will be provided for the student who is the target of the bullying, hazing, hate speech, harassment, discrimination, or retaliation.\n\nThe principal, assistant principal for student affairs, and Discipline Committee will review the situation and decide on a course of action that is appropriate to the situation.\n\nParents/guardians will be contacted and disciplinary actions may include the following:\n\nA. Written or verbal apology\n\nB. Loss of privileges\n\nC. Detention\n\nD. Suspension\n\nE. Expulsion\n\nHate Speech\n\nNardin Academy is committed to fostering a climate of inclusion for all Nardin Community members and any other individuals who occupy our space. As language is the most critical means of both welcoming and excluding individuals, it is critical that words that are specifically designed to target or hurt are forbidden within our space. This includes, but is not limited to, terms that have been historically used to target individuals based on race, religion, gender, ableness, sexual orientation, or other protected category. While some of these words may be utilized in literature or source material, they will not be permitted to be used in academic or public space, by students, faculty, staff or any member of the Nardin community. Additionally, they should not be heard in public spaces (e.g., music played in common areas). As such, Nardin expressly forbids the use of hate speech by any student during school hours, during school-sponsored events, outside of school hours including school breaks and summer vacation, and off-campus at all times.The use of this language may be addressed in a number of ways, from counseling through the Disciplinary Procedures laid out below.\n\nResponse: In the event that a student has used hate speech in any form or has been accused of using hate speech in any form, the Vice Principal and/or other discipline staff in collaboration with the Principal will conduct an investigation including reviewing evidence and interviewing witnesses. Students accused of hate speech online must cooperate with the investigation and provide the School with all information and evidence that the School requests. Failure to cooperate with an investigation will result in the student’s dismissal from Nardin Academy. The Principal may involve others to help determine whether the speech acts in question are objectionable to the targeted group.\n\nConsequences: A student who is found to have committed an act or acts of hate speech will face the full range of disciplinary consequences as specified on Page 10 and in most cases will incur a minimum 3-day suspension. If the investigation results in a finding that a student has committed a single severe act of hate speech or persistent acts of hate speech that have contributed substantially to a hostile environment for any member or group of members of the Nardin community (students, faculty, staff, coaches, etc.), they will be promptly expelled. Any student found in violation of this policy will minimally be expected to perform significant restitution to the Nardin community as determined by the Nardin administration.\n\nParent(s)/guardian(s) Disciplinary Procedures\n\nThe student and the student's parent(s)/guardian(s) agree to abide by the School's policies, rules, and regulations set forth in the applicable student handbook, which is subject to lawful amendments from time to time and is available on the Parent Portal website and/or at the office of the applicable Unit Head. Furthermore, the student may be suspended or dismissed from school at any time if, in the sole opinion of the School's administration if the student and/or the student's parent(s)/guardian(s) fails to abide by the School's policies, rules, and regulations or otherwise interferes with the School's accomplishment of its educational purpose. We further agree that such action will not release either party from the financial obligation of this contract. The acceptance of the student for enrollment in any school year shall not obligate the School to accept the student in any succeeding year.\n\nIII. Athletic Participation\n\nAll students may try out for membership on sports teams. Nardin is committed to providing everyone a fair chance to participate. Unfortunately, not everyone who tries out for Upper School sports can be accepted. The decision of the coach, in conjunction with the athletic director, is final. Parents/guardians are encouraged to help their daughter(s) understand that not everyone will be selected. Montessori, Lower and Middle School Modified Sports have a no cut-policy.\n\nUpper School athletes may participate in only one varsity sport per season.\n\nA current physical exam is required prior to tryouts for any sport.\n\nAn athlete must maintain a 75% average to participate in any sport. If a student’s average falls below 75, a review of her status will be conducted by the athletic director, guidance counselor, and/or principal.\n\nMisconduct or violation of the school rules may result in removal from the team.\n\nAbsence from school on the day of a game automatically results in the athlete’s ineligibility to participate in that day’s game.\n\nArrival at school after 9:05 a.m., except when due to a physician-verified medical appointment, disqualifies an athlete from participating on that day.\n\nAthletes must be punctual and attend all practices and games.\n\nContracts for each sport must be signed by the athlete and parent/guardian(s).\n\nParental/guardian athletic consent forms are required for participation.\n\nIV. Communications\n\nNardin Academy uses email to communicate to families about day to day activities across the Academy as well as in emergency situations. You may unsubscribe at any time to Nardin’s emails. If you do unsubscribe, know you may not be informed of emergency notifications.\n\nV. Community Portal\n\nParents and guardians can monitor grades and attendance by using the PowerSchool Parent Portal. Access is through Nardin Academy’s website and a password is needed to ensure privacy.\n\nVI. Faculty, Staff, Administration. and Family Contact Information\n\nA complete listing of Nardin Academy faculty, staff, and administration can be found at https://www.nardin.org/about-nardin/faculty-staff-directory\n\nA complete listing of Nardin families and students and staff can be found at https://www.nardin.org/parent-access/familydirectory.\n\nVII. Health Office Policies and Procedures\n\nAll students require a pass during school hours to receive care in the school clinic. A clinic pass may be issued for only one student at a time and is valid for only one period. The pass must be obtained from the scheduled classroom teacher. Students may be released from school for health-related reasons through the clinic only. The school nurse will evaluate the student's condition and notify parents/guardians, if necessary. In addition to basic first aid, the clinic also provides vision and hearing screening as mandated by NYS School Health Services.\n\nAbsences\n\nFor the health of the staff and other students, we ask that your child remains at home when exhibiting any flu-like symptoms. Students who complain of nausea, stomachache, headache, head or chest congestion, or sore throat should stay at home. If your child has had a fever, he or she must be fever-free without medication for a full twenty-four (24) hours before returning to school. A written excuse is required for each absence and should be brought to school the day the student returns.\n\nAdministration of Medications\n\nNew York State Education laws govern the administration of medications during school hours. This includes all medications, not just prescription medications, but over-the-counter medications including PRN (as needed) medications, such as ibuprofen, seasonal allergy medications, etc. Medications may be administered by the school nurse or designee after receipt of the following:\n\nA note from the student’s physician stating the name of the medication, the dose and the time to be given.\n\nA note from the student’s parent or guardian giving the Clinic Director or designee permission to administer the medication.\n\nA separate bottle of medication with the prescription label which will remain in the school until the completion of the therapy.\n\nCommunicable Diseases and COVID-19\n\nIf a student becomes ill with a communicable disease or condition, exhibits symptoms or tests positive for COVID-19, parents/guardians are asked to notify the Health Office as soon as possible. Once notified of confirmed cases, the Health Office will alert the other parents/guardians as to the symptoms of the condition, watch for such symptoms in students who seek health care in school, and notify the proper authorities in the event that this is required.\n\nIf a student presents with symptoms of contagious infection, such as strep throat, conjunctivitis (pink eye), or a questionable skin rash, the individual will be sent home until diagnosis can be confirmed or ruled out, and a physician’s note is sent in with the student. This is necessary to ensure the health and well-being of the entire student body. Students who come to school sick will be sent home.\n\nPlease visit https://www.nardin.org/covid-19 for the most current COVID-19 health and safety measures.\n\nEarly Dismissal/Late Arrival for Medical Appointments\n\nA request for early dismissal must be signed by a parent or guardian and state the reason for the early dismissal and the time for which it is desired. The school reserves the right to check doctors’ or dentists’ offices to confirm the time of the appointment, and the student must return with a note from the doctor’s office.\n\nAll requests for early dismissal must be presented in the office before homeroom/1st Block on the day in question. In order to release a student from school, Nardin must have a parent/guardian phone call or a note with a parent/guardian signature. If a student does not bring a note for an early dismissal with her in the morning, a parent or guardian must come to the office to sign them out in the appropriate school office. In addition, High School student families may fax a note to (716) 881-0086 or a parent/guardian may call (716) 881-6262 ext. 1080.\n\nImmunizations\n\nNew York State Law requires proof of immunization for all students. There are no religious exemptions. Additional immunizations are required for specific age groups. Check with your health care provider or the Health Office staff for specifics.\n\nInjuries/Concussions\n\nParents/guardians must notify the school and Health Office if the child sustains an injury, concussion or suspected concussion. In cases of suspected concussion, head injury or actual concussion, the concussion protocol will be instituted. Students must have an excuse from a physician if they are out of P.E. for more than one week. All students with a documented injury must be cleared by a physician prior to returning to Gym or sports.\n\nAll health forms are found at https://www.nardin.org/student-life/health-office.\n\nMedical Emergencies\n\nIn the case of necessary emergency medical treatment, if a parent, guardian or emergency contact cannot be reached, school personnel will render first aid treatment and then arrange transportation by ambulance to Oishei Children’s Hospital. A staff member will accompany and stay with the child until a parent/guardian can be reached.\n\nNYS Mandated Screening Programs\n\nDuring the year, a screening for vision and hearing will be conducted for students in those grades designated by the NYS School Health Services. Parents/guardians will be notified if further examination by a specialist is indicated.\n\nPhysical Examinations\n\nA current (within a year) physical examination is required for all new students, and all students. This report must be on file in the health office. There are no exceptions.\n\nAny student who participates in any extracurricular physical activity including team sports, must have an updated annual physical report for the current year. No exceptions to this requirement can be made. Parents/guardians are advised to make an appointment early in the summer to avoid disappointment in September.\n\nSelf-Medication\n\nStudents who will be carrying their own medications (inhalers, EpiPens, aspirin or non-aspirin pain relief products) must have the Self-Medication Release Form signed and completed by their parents/guardians and a physician. This applies to all medications, including over the counter drugs such as aspirin, cold capsules, cough drops, etc.\n\nAll medication orders must be renewed annually or when there is a change in medication or dosage. THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS POLICY.\n\nVIII. Family Vacations\n\nTrips taken by the family should be planned with school attendance in mind. Families should make every effort to avoid absence caused by early departure for Christmas, Easter, and other vacation periods. Absence from school for vacation constitutes an illegal absence. In the unlikely event that such an absence will occur, the Upper School student must obtain a vacation absence form, in advance, from the Main Office. Montessori, Lower and Middle School students should advise their classroom teachers. Students are responsible for all work missed during their absence.\n\nIX. Koessler Family Innovation and Technology Center\n\nLocated on the third floor of the Cleveland campus, the Koessler Family Innovation and Technology Center (KFITC) is a hub for Nardin Academy students in grades K-12 and Montessori to manually or digitally research and explore topics within a course or an individual interest. Students gather in the KFITC’s hubs for collaborative projects and technology integrated lessons through The Research and Innovation lab in Lower and Middle Schools, self guided research in the Montessori School, and is continuously open for Upper School classes and students and all teachers and staff.\n\nStudents may go to the KFITC between 7:30 a.m. - 4 p.m. with extended hours to accommodate practice and game schedules. The Director of Innovation and Instructional Technology provides research instruction, reference assistance, and reading advisory service in class settings and informally to individual library users. The KFITC is a member of the Buffalo School Library System, a statewide operation providing Interlibrary Loan and other services.\n\nStudents are required to sign out of their classroom and scan the QR code to sign into the KFITC. Once they sign in, they are expected to stay in the area. There is a limited cell phone use policy as students are encouraged to use the common area and hubs for work and study spaces. Additionally, there is no food or drink, besides water permitted in the common area or in the hubs. Students are required to keep a low volume and use appropriate language when working together to respect those in the surrounding areas. The Director of Innovation and Instructional Technology will monitor all students in the KFITC and determine if any of the expectations are not being followed which will result in students being asked to return to their classrooms with further disciplinary follow up if necessary. Failure to follow the KFITC expectations will result in an inability to use the KFITC.\n\nX. Liturgies\n\nThe Nardin community celebrates holy days and other religious seasons with liturgies that involve student planning and participation. Responsibility for these services is shared by younger and older students throughout the year. Reverence for the presence of God requires students to maintain silence and demonstrate appropriate behavior. Eating, drinking, and gum-chewing are not allowed.\n\nXI. Remote Learning Policy\n\nNardin Academy firmly believes that the most successful teaching and learning is done in the classroom, in person. During the pandemic, we shifted to online, remote teaching and learning as required by the circumstances we all faced. As we continue to manage the changing realities of the pandemic, all students are to be in school year round.\n\nRemote learning will only be offered for the following circumstances:\n\nA student has to be quarantined due to being positive with COVID-19 or is identified as a close contact by the New York State Department of Health;\n\nA medical necessity (documented by a health provider) that would require an absence greater than 5 days.\n\nIn all cases of absence, students can access assignments on Schoology and email teachers as necessary. Remote Learning will not be offered in the instances of travel.\n\nXII. Smoking, Drinking, Drugs\n\nSmoking, vaping, drinking, or the possession of drugs or alcohol is not permitted at any time on or near school property, or at any school-sponsored activity.\n\nDue to the abundance of medical evidence pointing to the dangers of smoking, Nardin is committed to educating students about the hazards of tobacco use and nicotine. Nardin prohibits the use of tobacco products, e-cigarettes, or vaporizers of any sort on Nardin premises and at any Nardin functions at all times. In addition, students may not sell or in other ways make smoking materials—electronic or otherwise—available to other individuals in the Nardin community. Violation of this policy may result in school discipline.\n\nAny student who consumes drugs or alcohol at a Nardin Academy function or at any other school’s activities will be automatically dismissed from their position on a team, in a club, in office, in a play, etc. and will be given a five day out-of-school suspension. If a student has more than one offense, the individual may be expelled.\n\nMembers holding a student body or club office or team membership are held to a higher standard at Nardin Academy. The use of alcohol and/or drugs shows a complete lack of respect for the school and your student body office, club or team. If a student consumes alcohol or uses drugs at any Nardin Academy function (or any other school’s activities), the student will automatically be dismissed from the student body office, club or team. If a student consumes alcohol or uses drugs at any other time, the student may be suspended or dismissed from the student body office, club or team. The moderator or coach, in consultation with the principal and athletic director when necessary, shall determine the disciplinary action, including the length of suspension or whether dismissal from the student body office, club, or team is warranted.\n\nXIII. Social Media\n\nSocial media is used today to share ideas, thoughts and information. It is a very helpful tool used to connect Nardin with our greater Western New York community. As digital citizens, it is imperative that we encourage positive engagement, being respectful, ethical and responsible. Any social media post that reflects negatively on the Nardin Community is Nardin's responsibility. Negative posts made about the Nardin community or its members, regardless of when or where, are Nardin business and will be brought to the attention of the disciplinary committee or school principal(s).\n\nXIV. School Cancellations\n\nNardin Academy uses a phone, text and email notification system through which families will be contacted should school be closed for weather or other public emergencies. In addition, if weather conditions appear hazardous during the school day, an email, text and/or telephone notification will come from school.\n\nXV. Searches\n\nThe school reserves the right to search anything brought onto school property including, but not limited to backpacks, purses, cell phones, laptop computers, and cars, if there is reasonable cause to do so. The school may also search lockers at any time.\n\nXVI. Transportation to Nonpublic Schools\n\nSection 3635(1)(a) of the Education Law requires a board of education to provide transportation to a nonpublic school up to 15 miles from such school when a written request has been submitted by April 1st of the preceding school year.\n\nIn addition, Section 3635(1)(b) requires a board of education to provide transportation from a centralized pickup point, which must be a public school building, for nonpublic school pupils who live more than fifteen (15) miles from school, when a pupil residing within fifteen (15) miles is receiving transportation to the same nonpublic school.\n\nConduct on the school bus is a joint concern of the district and Nardin Academy. For the safety and comfort of all passengers, students are expected to obey the following rules:\n\nStudents must use only the bus and the bus stop assigned.\n\nStudents should wait for the bus in an orderly fashion.\n\nStudents are to remain seated, facing forward, when the bus is in motion.\n\nStudents are expected to converse quietly and refrain from making unnecessary noise.\n\nStudents should not talk to the driver unless it is necessary.\n\nHead and arms must always be kept inside the bus.\n\nStudents should not litter inside the bus, nor throw anything out the window.\n\nStudents are to be respectful of the bus driver and considerate of other passengers.\n\nFighting, shoving, name calling, vulgar language and spitting are expressly forbidden.\n\nStudents should learn and observe the rules and recommendations of the home school district.\n\nFailure to follow these rules may result in disciplinary action taken by the school and may result in the refusal of the district to supply this service to the student.\n\nXVII. Visitors\n\nTo ensure security for our students and school personnel, all visitors, including parents and guardians are required to enter and sign-in with the school receptionist at the main entrance on Cleveland Avenue or the side entrance at 700 West Ferry Street. Appointments are necessary to visit or meet with any faculty, staff and/or administrators.\n\nI. Philosophy and Operational Characteristics\n\nDr. Maria Montessori, an Italian physician and educator, developed the Montessori approach to education: it encourages the development of the whole child to their own potential. Intellectual, physical, psychological, and spiritual aspects are fostered by means of a carefully prepared environment, exposing the child to a variety of specific materials and experiences.\n\nThe Nardin Academy Montessori Program is committed to parents and guardians and their young children. Nardin offers a Toddler program (for children eighteen months through thirty-six months of age), an Early Childhood Program (for children from three to six years of age), and an Elementary program (for children ranging from First to Third grade). Our programs have been repeatedly accredited by the American Montessori Society and Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.\n\nClassroom Community\n\nMontessori philosophy fosters a natural sense of community in addition to a respect for each individual. In the classroom the children are given freedom of choice within a well-defined set of ground rules. These rules have been carefully established to provide fair and clear expectations for the working community, along with a consistent set of guidelines and consequences for one’s actions. The teachers, assistants, and children work cooperatively to provide a safe, comfortable, equitable, and just environment in which to grow and learn.\n\nThe Toddler and Early Childhood Programs are located at the West Ferry Street campus. The Nardin Montessori Elementary classroom is located at the Cleveland Avenue Campus\n\nView of the Child\n\nChildren possess unique sensitivity and mental capabilities for absorbing and assimilating information from their environment, different by nature from those of adults. To help children reach their potential, the classroom environment stimulates and encourages the development of self-esteem, independence, self-motivation, and respect for oneself and others, along with a strong sense of community. Understanding that children learn at their own pace, the intellect is challenged in a developmentally appropriate manner through the Montessori learning materials. These materials and the Montessori philosophy have also taken into account the young child’s need for physical activity by providing a large number of gross and fine motor experiences. Likewise, by means of their daily activities within the classroom community, children are able to explore and develop their social and emotional skills. It is our strong belief that we must educate the whole child according to individual needs, enabling the child to grow to their fullest potential.\n\nRole of the Teacher\n\nThe Montessori teacher has gone through a specialized training in Montessori philosophy, principles, and methodology. The teacher’s role is to guide the child where needed and introduce the learning materials. One of the primary tasks is to carefully observe in order to assist growth and development. Observations help the teacher carefully design the stimulating learning environment which meets the needs of the child. The method of teaching is indirect in that it neither imposes upon the child (as in direct teaching) nor abandons the child (as in a non-directed, permissive approach). Following the child’s interest, the teacher actively works to help the student achieve their goals.\n\nSuggested Montessori Reading\n\nToddler:\n\nMontessori from the Start: The Child at Home, from Birth to Age Three\n\nLillard, Paula Polk and Jenssen, Lynn Lillard\n\nNew York: Schocken Books, 2003\n\nUnderstanding the Human Being: The Importance of the First Three Years of Life\n\nMontanaro, Silvana Quattrocchi\n\nABC-CLIO, 1991\n\nEarly Childhood and Elementary:\n\nThe Absorbent Mind\n\nMontessori, Dr. Maria\n\nHolt Paperbacks, 1995\n\nMontessori: A Modern Approach\n\nPolk Lillard, Paula\n\nSchocken Books, 1975\n\nII. Montessori Educational Programs\n\nCurriculum: Toddler\n\nThe Toddler classroom is a Montessori-based learning environment. The Toddler curriculum reflects the developmental stage of the child at eighteen (18) to thirty-six (36) months, as they make great strides in developing fine and gross motor abilities, refining and enriching language, integrating the senses, and learning social skills. The move toward independence and developing trust is supported, and exploration and spontaneous self-expression are encouraged.\n\nPace of the Day: Toddler\n\nA warm, relaxed atmosphere is cultivated through a carefully planned environment and the sensitive pacing of the child’s day. The classroom teacher gives the child as much time as needed to complete a task, allowing the child to repeat it as often as they like. There is no need to hurry through and move on to the next project.\n\nAn awareness of the child’s changing energy levels throughout the day enables the teacher to accommodate both extremely active periods and calm, restful times as the child’s needs dictate.\n\nCurriculum: Early Childhood\n\nThe Montessori multi-age, three- to six-year-old student environment contains four basic curriculum areas: Practical Life / Daily Living, Sensorial, Language and Math. It is enriched with art, music, geography, science and physical education. The materials in each area are sequenced, beginning at the most simple, concrete levels, and then moving into more complex, abstract concepts. Children freely choose activities from any curriculum area as their interest dictates. Explorations and interactions within the environment help them develop self-discipline, self-knowledge, and independence, as well as enthusiasm for learning, an organized approach to problem-solving and academic skills. Students have the benefit of a multi-age classroom, developing leadership skills, building confidence, independence and curiosity. In their final year of the three-year cycle, afternoon students gather and work on honing the skills necessary for first grade. Students enjoy daily outdoor play time and scheduled physical education time.\n\nPace of the Day: Early Childhood\n\nA warm, relaxed atmosphere is cultivated through a carefully planned environment and the sensitive pacing of the child’s day. The classroom teacher gives the child as much time as needed to complete a task, allowing the child to repeat it as often as they like. There is no need to hurry through and move on to the next project. An awareness of the child’s changing energy levels throughout the day enables the teacher to accommodate both extremely active periods and calm, restful times as the child’s needs dictate.\n\nCurriculum: Elementary\n\nThe Montessori Elementary Program is a three-year, multi-age classroom environment. Students in the first, second and third grade are grouped together in the same classroom as the Montessori multi-age environment provides children with opportunities for broad social development. The Montessori elementary learning environment balances the child’s developing imagination and powers of abstraction with down-to-earth, concrete, hands-on materials. In Montessori elementary, the child’s own questions provide the basis for exploration of the world. Reading, writing and math skills are geared to the individual’s level of mastery and reinforced through research projects in the areas of geography, science and history. Children are continually challenged to stretch to the next level of difficulty, while being guided and supported by the teachers.\n\nNardin Academy Montessori Elementary children have many opportunities to participate and interact with children in the Nardin Lower School program.\n\nPace of the Day: Elementary\n\nThe children start their morning by planning their daily activities as everyone arrives; they then gather for a community meeting within their classrooms. Following that, lessons are given one on one and in small groups, throughout the day. The work cycle includes opportunities for Physical Education, Language classes, Atrium, Art classes, and library time.\n\nSpiritual Development: Early Childhood and Elementary\n\nThe Catechesis of the Good Shepherd is an approach to the religious formation of children which is presented to the students in our Early Childhood program. It originated in 1954 with the founding of the children’s center or “atrium” in Rome, Italy, and inspired by Montessori principles of education, it now extends to many countries including Africa, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Canada, and the United States. An Atrium can be found in home, parish and school settings: it is offered as part of our curriculums to our Early Childhood Students and is mandatory for our Elementary students.\n\nExtracurricular Activities: Early Childhood and Elementary\n\nThere are a number of extracurricular activities offered to the children in our Early Childhood and Elementary programs: these may vary from year to year. Some examples of these are piano, violin and voice lessons, dance classes, gymnastics, and soccer for the Early Childhood students, with several additional sports also available to Elementary students. Parents are informed about these activities through emails, which detail the application, fee, and schedule. Transportation for all after school activities is the responsibility of the parent. If you are not able to transport your child yourself, please make alternate arrangements for their transportation: Nardin is not responsible for student transportation unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\nIII. Home Visits / Orientation / Phase-In Toddler\n\nThe Toddler orientation process begins with a Home Visit. These are an opportunity for our Toddler students and their families to meet the Toddler teachers in a calm, home setting, prior to invitation into the classroom. Home visits occur for our Toddlers in the first four days of classes, and you will receive an email from the teacher arranging a mutually convenient time before the end of August. The Phase-In schedule, for which you will also receive an email, is carefully planned to help your child create positive experiences and begin building trust in a new space, and lasts about 1-2 weeks in the classroom space, without parental adult attendance.\n\nIV. Orientation / Phase-In Early Childhood\n\nThe first few days of the school year are devoted to helping the child adjust to the program, and are truncated in length for student acclimation. It is greatly beneficial for students to attend their assigned phase-in periods: please make every effort for your child to be present for all days. Phase-in schedules will be emailed, prior to the start of the school year.\n\nV. Orientation: Montessori Elementary\n\nThere is an orientation day for incoming Elementary Montessori students in mid-to-late August. The exact date is communicated to parents via email and noted on the calendar sent to families at that time, in addition to the Nardin.org calendar website.\n\nVI. Daily Operations\n\nProgram Structure: Toddler\n\nChildren attend the Toddler program for two (Monday/Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday), three (prior options with Fridays added on), four (Mondays through Thursdays), or all five mornings a week.

Toddlers should be dressed comfortably. Elastic waistbands are helpful for children of this age to encourage self-toileting.\n\nFormalized Dress Code: Early Childhood and Elementary\n\nFormalized dress code items are available for purchase by visiting the Lands’ End Shop.\n\nTops\n\nPolo shirts with the Nardin seal are available in green, white, gray and black.\n\nDresses\n\nDresses are available in green and black featuring the Nardin seal. Note that Montessori students are expected to wear leggings under their dresses in the cooler months. Leggings can be navy blue, black, gray, or white.\n\nNardinware\n\nIn addition to our daily uniform, students may wear a variety of Nardinware items which are available a https://www.nardin.org/student-life/nardinware. Approved items include any zip pullovers or jackets as well as the crew neck Nardin sweaters. No hoodies are approved for the dress code.\n\nBottoms\n\nStudents must wear khaki pants, shorts, skirts, or skorts. Can be purchased from Lands’ End or a brand and store of your choice.\n\nFootwear\n\nStudents in the Early Childhood and Elementary programs should wear sneakers at all times, for their safety and to accommodate physical activity. These sneakers will be kept at school for the entirety of the school year.

Please mark this clearly and visibly with your child’s name. These will be kept in the classroom for the children's use and sent home periodically for cleaning.\n\nPhysical Education Classes: Early Childhood and Elementary\n\nPhysical Education classes are offered to all children in the Early Childhood and Elementary Programs. The Montessori Elementary physical education program continues to enrich the lives of our students by fostering a love and joy of movement. Children's individual skill sets are continually developing allowing them to be successful at a large variety of sports and physical activities. There is an emphasis on team building and becoming active, healthy members of the community. Classes provide an opportunity for a cardiovascular and large muscle work out as well as sport specific skill development. Additional activities children participate in outside of the classroom include: rollerblading, camping {archery, canoeing, rock wall climbing, field sports}, meal planning and preparation, and ice skating.\n\nVII. Birthdays and Holidays\n\nBirthdays\n\nWe prefer to recognize each child’s birthday in our classrooms. Please contact your child’s classroom teachers regarding their in-classroom celebrations.\n\nNardin Montessori does not distribute invitations for outside events.

Meals and Snacks\n\nToddler\n\nMeals\n\nToddler students do not eat a designated meal while at school. The length of the morning is devoted to classroom exploration and learning.\n\nSnacks\n\nToddlers have the opportunity to try many different snack options, in addition to in-classroom tasting sessions, throughout the year. Please alert the Health Clinic at hcornell@nardin.org if a child has an allergy or the Montessori office at dchevrestt@nardin.org if a child has a deep food aversion that you feel may inhibit their enjoyment of this programmatic offering.\n\nEarly Childhood\n\nMeals\n\nParents are responsible for providing lunch, including a drink in a closed container, for Early Childhood students who stay all day. We recommend the use of a well-labeled lunch box (use a laundry marking pen inside and out, or a luggage tag on the handle). If desired, a hot lunch can be purchased through the Nardin Dining Hall: the meals are delivered Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays to the West Ferry campus. Information for ordering is sent via an email at the beginning of the school year. Families can choose the lunches and meal plans desired and pay for them according to the website instructions. This is coordinated by the Dining Hall. For more information, visit https://www.nardin.org/student-life/dining-at-nardin.\n\nSnacks\n\nParents of Early Childhood Program students will be responsible for providing a daily snack for their child in a bag or container separate from their lunch box. We encourage a healthy snack that will fuel their mind and body for the morning work period.\n\nElementary\n\nMeals\n\nParents are responsible for providing lunch, including a beverage, for their Elementary students. We recommend the use of a well-labeled lunch box (use a laundry marking pen inside and out, or a luggage tag on the handle).

All Dining Hall related concerns and questions should be addressed to Julie Levin, at (716) 881-6262 and jlevin@nardin.org.\n\nIX. Parent and Guardian Involvement\n\nCommunication\n\nOur primary responsibility is the education, safety, health, and well-being of your children and our Nardin community as a whole. Faculty and staff are always available to discuss any concerns you may have regarding your Nardin experience, as long as the children are not our immediate responsibility at that time. We therefore firmly request that, if you have a desire for a conversation with your child’s educators, it occur outside the normal school day hours. Please write a note or email requesting a conference time or a phone call for outside of school and after care hours, and we will be happy to accommodate you.\n\nWritten communication from a student’s adult custodial caregiver is required when:\n\nA different person is picking up at regular dismissal, or the student is being picked up at an alternate time from usual.\n\nYour child has been absent for more than three days.\n\nThere is a change of address, email address, home phone number, cell phone, or work number for your child’s adult custodial or emergency caregivers.\n\nObservations\n\nWe strongly encourage in-classroom observation. We limit the observation to two (2) individuals per class per day, and ask that your observation take place between 8:45 and 9:45 a.m. Please call (716) 881-6565 to schedule an observation.\n\nConferences\n\nThere will be one scheduled conference concerning each student’s progress during the Fall term and a second during the Spring semester. All custodial adult caregivers are expected to attend these conferences when possible. Students do NOT have school on these days.\n\nAdditional conferences may be requested by either custodial adult(s) or school representatives, as such needs arise.\n\nVolunteering\n\nWe encourage parents and guardians to share their special talents and skills with the children. Volunteer opportunities may be limited due to COVID-19 restrictions. Please call the main office line at (716) 881-6565.\n\nI. Academic Resource Program\n\nThe Academic Resource Team assists student needs in three ways:\n\nStudents can receive Pull Out Services in Academic Resource, Push In Services in the General Education Classroom, and “Extra” Services such as OT, PT and Speech. Current IEP or Accomodation Plan documentation is required for students to be eligible for Student Support Services.\n\nIn Pull Out Services students attend a resource room program which enables them to receive reinforcement of classroom material. Students are given study guides, notes, practice problems and reteaching across all subject areas. They are also able to work on study skills and organizational skills. The student ratio is no more than 5 students per teacher which provides ample opportunities for each student to focus on mastery of difficult skills.\n\nThrough Push In Services the special education teacher goes into the classroom to give support to both the general education teacher and students. This provides a greater teacher to student ratio, enabling students to have questions clarified more quickly during instruction, and helping them stay focused when taking notes or working. The push-in teacher also helps students with organizational needs. The general education teacher is given support by implementing the student’s classroom and testing accommodations.\n\nStudents may also qualify for additional services. Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, and Speech Therapy are provided to students who have documented IEP goals in those areas. These specialists are provided and contracted through the Buffalo Public Schools.\n\nII. After School Supervision Program*\n\n*After School will not accept drop-in students on a daily basis.\n\nAs a service to families, our After School Supervision Program is available for students in Grades K - 8 from 3 p.m. until 5:30 p.m. for an additional hourly fee on a regular or “as needed” basis.\n\nThe After School Supervision Program includes a quiet period in which students can work on homework. A healthy snack is provided. Additional time for games or outside play will be included.\n\nStudents who are involved in after school sports may use this service. The fee will be indicated on the tuition bill. Policies and procedures will be communicated to all participants with safety being the primary concern.\n\nIII. Arrival and Dismissal Policies & Procedures\n\nArrival:\n\nThe school day begins with announcements starting at 8:05 a.m. for all students. The course of a school day is defined as 7:30 a.m. - 3:30 p.m. Arrival time is between 7:30 a.m. and 8 a.m. All students are to report to the gym where they are supervised until 8 a.m. At 8 a.m. all students may proceed to their lockers and classrooms. Students arriving after 8:10 a.m. must report to the office before going to class. All absences and tardiness are part of a child’s permanent record file.\n\nDismissal\n\nDismissal begins at 2:55 p.m. Students are dismissed by their Homeroom teacher. Please note that the front of the school is reserved for bus traffic, and the west parking lot adjacent to the building is for pick-up purposes.\n\nAt the beginning of the school year, a parent must complete, sign, and return a Transportation Form stating how their child(ren) will generally be getting home from school (e.g., parents will pick up, student will walk, student will take school bus). If such procedure changes during the year, a new form must be completed and submitted. If your child will be going home with a classmate after school, the school must have a written note from the parent granting permission to release the child to another parent. The note must be given to the homeroom teacher first thing in the morning.\n\nIn order to ensure the safety of our students, Nardin Academy utilizes:\n\nAfter school, Lower and Middle School teachers direct children to their parents’ vehicles at the Competition Gymnasium, along the one way driveway from Cleveland Avenue to Auburn Avenue from 3:00 to 3:30 p.m.\n\nPrivate security in the Nardin driveway and parking lot to assist in proper parking, traffic flow, and safety.\n\nPrivate security at the corner of Tudor and Cleveland Avenues to assist traffic in and around the district buses.\n\nAfter school elementary teachers at the Cleveland Avenue school doors to direct children to the school buses.\n\nEnd of the Day Procedures\n\nWalkers & Buses: 2:55 p.m. / Parent Pick Up: 3 p.m.\n\nWalkers must have a Transportation Form filled out and signed by a parent or legal guardian.\n\nStudents on district buses are supervised by an elementary teacher in front of the main entrance of the building.\n\nStudents who are being picked up will be called out as the elementary administrator or teacher sees that child’s vehicle. Each student will be escorted to his or her vehicle to ensure safety. Please stay in your vehicle at all times.\n\nParking:\n\nCleveland Avenue:\n\nParking on Cleveland Avenue is clearly posted and enforced by the City of Buffalo Parking Violations Division. There is no parking in front of the school during school hours, from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.\n\nLegal parking is posted and has opposite sides of the street restrictions based on the day of the week.\n\nAuburn Avenue:\n\nFor safety reasons, students are not allowed to meet parents outside the school gates on Auburn Avenue.\n\nDouble parking on Auburn Avenue is illegal and creates a traffic jam on both Auburn and Cleveland Avenues.\n\nIV. Assessments\n\nTests, quizzes, and teacher observations are part of a comprehensive program to assess student progress. Students will not have more than two full period tests on any given day. Cumulative 20 week tests are given in Math, Social Studies, and Science in grades 5-8. An average of these tests is considered a final exam grade.\n\nNardin Academy students in grades K-8 participate in NWEA’s MAP (Measures of Academic Progress) assessment. These online tests are used in conjunction with goal setting to evaluate students’ progress in reading and math. Students are tested three times a year (Fall/Winter/Spring).\n\nAthletic Participation: All sports are subject to change and be added due to student numbers each year.\n\nParticipation Requirements:\n\nA current physical exam is required prior to tryouts for any sport.\n\nA 75% average must be maintained to participate in any sport. If a student’s average falls below this, a review of her status will be conducted by the athletic director and Principal.\n\nMisconduct or violation of the school rules may result in removal from the team. See Discipline Policy.\n\nAbsence from school on the day of a game automatically results in the athlete not participating in that day’s game.\n\nArrival at school after 9 a.m., except for when due to a physician-verified medical appointment, disqualifies an athlete from participating on that day.\n\nAthletes must be punctual and attend all practices and games.\n\nAthletes are required to attend Study Hall when practices or competitions are held later in the day.\n\nParental athletic consent forms must be signed by the parent(s).\n\nV. Attendance and Absenteeism\n\nParents or guardians must call the school office (x3050) before 8:30 a.m. to report their child’s absence. This should be done each day a child is absent. In the event that no call is received, we will contact the child’s home or parent’s place of employment by 10 a.m. to inquire about the nature of the absence. When the child returns to school, parents are required to provide a note explaining the reason for the absence. New York State legal absences are for personal illness, the illness or death of a family member, impassable roads or weather, or a religious observance.\n\nTherefore, students who miss fifteen (15) or more days of school and who have not met periodically with school administration are in jeopardy of retention. The school secretary will notify the Principal of students who are approaching the fifteen (15) day limit and a letter will be sent to parents expressing the school’s concerns. At a conference with the school administration, alternative educational plans will be determined. It is the parent’s responsibility to notify the school administration of an attendance concern and to request such a conference.\n\nTardiness Policy\n\nTardiness affects the entire learning process of the student as well as the class. While we understand that traffic and unplanned situations can cause a delay, we believe it is imperative for each student to be present at the beginning of the school day and through the end. Students are considered tardy if they are not present in their first block class beginning at 8 a.m. Tardiness is recorded on a student’s permanent record card.\n\nAfter five (5) tardies, a written and verbal communication will be sent home to the legal guardian(s) indicating the school’s concern. Additional tardies may result in a meeting between the administration and legal guardian(s) to discuss the situation. If a student should exceed fifteen (15) tardies, further disciplinary action may be taken at the discretion of the administration.\n\nWe understand that life may present certain circumstances that make it difficult for some to adhere to this policy. If you are a family that has extenuating circumstances that may affect your child’s ability to be on time for school, please request a meeting with the administration.\n\nAbsentee Homework\n\nIf a child is absent for up to two consecutive days, he/she should contact a classmate or check Schoology for assignments. If a child is absent for three (3) or more consecutive days, parents should call the office (x 1010) between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. to request assignments and books. The materials will be collected and placed in the receptionist area by 3 p.m. Teachers will not prepare separate assignments in anticipation of, nor are they responsible for tutorial assistance, after such absences.\n\nWork missed during an absence can be made up within five (5) school days upon the child’s return to school. When your child returns to school, they should contact their teachers to receive assistance and to verify missed assignments. Additionally, students in grades 5-8 can use Resource to meet with a teacher regarding missed assignments.\n\nPlease note that teachers do not prepare work for students who are traveling and/or going on vacation. In this scenario, students should call a friend and/or check Schoology for any missed work. We strongly encourage all travel to take place during the designated school breaks and holidays so as to not disrupt a student's learning and growth. Please contact your child’s Principal if you are planning a family vacation during regular school hours.\n\nVI. Birthday Party Policy\n\nBirthday parties are an exciting time and all students' feelings must be considered. Therefore, the only birthday party invitations that may be distributed in school are ones that include the entire class. If a party is not including the whole class, these invitations must be mailed directly to those invited guests and cannot be distributed at school.\n\nVII. Cell Phones/Smart Watches\n\nThe school office telephone is available to students for brief and urgent matters. In the event that a student needs to contact home, they must make any calls from the Lower and Middle School Office. If calls need to be made during the course of a school day, a student must have a written pass from their teacher. Arrangements for rides home and play dates should be made ahead of time. Parents who want to contact their child may call the school office. In the case of an illness, the Health Office will contact the child’s guardian(s). Students are not to call home for medical reasons on their own.\n\nCell phone and SmartWatch use during the school day (7:55 a.m. - 3:00 p.m.) is prohibited. Any lost or misplaced cell phone(s) and/or Smart Watch(es) are not the responsibility of Nardin Academy.\n\nDaily Procedure:\n\nEach Middle School homeroom teacher has a caddy with enough room for each student's cell phone and SmartWatch to be placed in its own slot. Every morning, homeroom teachers will collect student cell phones and SmartWatches and lock them safely in a predetermined cabinet. Cell phones and SmartWatches will be returned at the end of each day during homeroom check-in time, prior to dismissal.\n\nIf a student arrives late to school, the student will stop in their homeroom to turn in their cell phone and/or SmartWatch so it can be secured safely for the day. If this is not feasible, the student will turn it into the main office and it will be placed in the homeroom teacher’s mailbox.\n\nIf a student has an early dismissal, the homeroom teacher will ensure that student has their phone and/or watch prior to departure. The homeroom teacher will determine how this will happen.\n\nIf a student did not turn in their cell phone or SmartWatch during homeroom, it will be confiscated and the student will be on steps of the Middle School Discipline Policy.\n\nPlease note that students participating in any extracurricular activities, including Afterschool Supervision, are subject to follow the policies of those programs.\n\nVIII. Dining Hall Service\n\nDining Hall Services and procedures can be found here.\n\nAs part of Sustainable Nardin, scratch cooking on a daily basis is available to students. When possible, food is sourced from local farms and vendors, and students are responsible for recycling and sorting waste for composting.\n\nStudents have lunch in the dining hall in two shifts. Grades K-4 eat at 10:50 a.m., and students in grades 5-8 eat at 11:24 a.m. Students may bring lunch, purchase a full meal, or choose from a wide selection of individual items. A credit account is set up for each student for this purpose. To make the dining hall as pleasant and efficient as possible, Nardin Academy has set up a secure online payment system. To purchase food, a student must have an account with Lunchtime. To set up an account, visit the Lunchtime School Payment Portal on Nardin Academy’s website. A menu of the full lunch selections is published monthly on Nardin Academy’s website. No food or drink is to be removed from the cafeteria. Eating or drinking in the halls or in a classroom is strictly prohibited unless under the supervision of a faculty member.\n\nIX.

Likewise, any article of clothing with a picture or graphic may not be obscene or promote any illegal activity or violence. The wearing of any article of clothing that is deemed inappropriate, offensive or a distraction to the educational environment will be required to be changed. Furthermore, Nardin believes that viewpoint neutral dress is important to its educational mission, and is in no way meant to suppress one's freedom of expression. It is however meant to: 1) minimize distractions in the learning process; and 2) maintain an orderly learning environment.\n\nExtracurricular Activities\n\nAll students are encouraged to participate as learning does not stop in the classroom. Nardin Academy offers a wide range of extracurricular activities. We strive to offer extracurricular activities that meet the varying interests in athletics, arts and STEM to enhance creativity within after school opportunities. The following are among the activities that both Lower and Middle School students may become involved in during the school year. Current extracurricular activities include but are not limited to:\n\nX. Honor Roll/Merit Roll\n\nDistinction is given for Middle School Honor Roll/Merit Roll based on quarter grades for students in grades 5-8. A student can become a member of the Scholar’s Club by maintaining an honor roll average of at least 93.0% for the year. Scholars will be recognized at the beginning of the next school year. Only academic courses are included in the average. Averages are not rounded.\n\nHonor Roll: 93% - 100%\n\nMerit Roll: 88% - 92%\n\nXI. Lockers\n\nStudents are given locker space in which to store outside clothing and school materials not in use. Lockers should be kept neat and clean with special attention being paid to the disposal of food items. The school is not responsible for any item left in a locker. If for some reason a student must carry something valuable to school, it is recommended that it be left in the school office for the day. The school retains the right to inspect lockers if the school deems it necessary.\n\nXII. Lost and Found\n\nThe Lost and Found is located in the coat area on the first floor (across from the Elementary office). Clothing items are generally taken there while books, eyeglasses, money, and jewelry are usually taken to the school office. Lost items are put on display periodically during the year before they are donated to charity.\n\nXIII. Meet the Teachers Night\n\nParents of K-8th grade students are invited to meet with their child(ren)’s teachers within the first few weeks of school. At this time Teachers will discuss procedures and curriculum. Dates, times and format will be communicated to families in September each year.\n\nXIV. Middle School Academic Failures\n\nThe passing grade for all numerically graded courses is 65%. A passing grade should be earned in all required subjects before the start of the next academic year. Courses should be made up in a summer school setting if the subject is offered. If this is not possible, the student may be asked to repeat the grade at Nardin the following academic year or find another school. Any exceptions must be approved by the Principal and the academic department.\n\nXV. Parent Conferences\n\nParents will have the opportunity to meet with teachers on Parent Conference day scheduled mid-first semester, in November. Dates, times and format will be communicated to families in August/September each year. Other conferences may be arranged through the Guidance Office.\n\nScheduling a Parent-Teacher Conference:\n\nA registration link/process will be sent home to parents requesting a conference with individual teachers.\n\nParents will complete and return the registration form to the school office by a designated date.\n\nParents will receive a confirmation of their meeting times. If parents cannot attend at the scheduled time, another time will be arranged by the office or by the individual teachers. Parents must telephone the office to reschedule appointment times.\n\nXVI. Progress Reports\n\nAcademic Progress Reports will be issued during each quarter as needed. These reports usually indicate a need for increased effort, better work habits, or additional support in order to reach a higher level of achievement by the end of the marking period. Teachers provide ongoing communication to parents as necessary in regards to the student’s progress.\n\nXVII. Release of Records\n\nThe school maintains records on all students. Information included on these records may not be released without written parental consent except when a student transfers to another school or when a student applies for admission to a high school. In both instances, a transcript will be sent upon request to the educational institution.\n\nReport Cards\n\nReport cards are mailed to parents at the end of each quarter.\n\nLower School - The report cards have been developed by the Lower School faculty to reflect on a student's progress in relation to their growth and development.\n\nMiddle School - Grades 5-8 use a more traditional report card with letters and numbers indicating the achievement level of the student. In grades 5-8, the final grade is determined by a weighted average that combines the quarters and an average of the 20-week tests when applicable in certain subjects.\n\nGrades 5 − 8\n\nA+ 98\n\nA 95\n\nA- 92\n\nB+ 89\n\nB 86\n\nB- 83\n\nC+ 80\n\nC 77\n\nC- 74\n\nD+ 71\n\nD 68\n\nD- 65\n\nF Below 65\n\nXVIII. Student Discipline Policy\n\nPhilosophy\n\nTogether, parents, teachers, guardians, students, and staff at Nardin Academy are raising a community of children, helping them to form responsible and respectful student behavior. Their positive behavioral choices ensure the safety of all and ensure an effective learning environment.\n\nEach school will approach consequences for negative behaviors based on what is developmentally appropriate for the child. Lower and Middle School discipline policies are outlined below:\n\nLower School Discipline Policy\n\nK-4 faculty and staff will use the following graduated consequences to foster positive decision making:\n\nTeacher will speak with the student privately about the decision/choice they have made if negative in nature.\n\nParents will be notified about the occurrence/incident/behaviors via a phone call or email message from the teacher.\n\nStudents may meet with the Principal if necessary to speak about occurrence/incident/behaviors.\n\nPrincipal may follow up with a parent phone call and/or meeting if necessary.\n\nMiddle School Discipline Policy\n\nIn addition to each teacher’s classroom management style, which includes a commitment to building positive relationships with each student, faculty and staff will use the following graduated consequences to foster positive decision making, keeping in mind the age and grade of each student.\n\nStep 1 - Teacher will speak with the student privately about the decision/choice they have made if negative in nature, and discuss better choices.\n\nStep 2 - Teacher will speak with the student privately again. Parents will be notified via phone call or email message from the teacher about the occurrence/incident/behavior, and request a partnership in support and follow up at home.\n\nStep 3 - Teacher will speak with the student and refer him/her to the Principal. Student will meet with the Principal to speak about occurrence/incident/behaviors and parents will receive a phone call from the Principal.\n\nStep 4 - Teacher will speak with the student and refer him/her to the Principal again. Student will meet with the Principal again to discuss and be assigned detention. Principal will follow up with a parent phone call, and request a meeting if necessary.\n\nBelow is a sample list of violations, which is not exhaustive.\n\nChewing gum\n\nOut of dress code\n\nUnprepared for class (laptop, pen/pencil, book, etc)\n\nCell phone, apple watch, airpod, headphone use\n\nPoor manners in cafeteria\n\nDisrespectful\n\nDisrupting the learning environment\n\nBullying/harassment/intimidation\n\nTruancy/skipping class\n\nCheating\n\nPlagiarism\n\nDestruction of property\n\nPossession,distribution of and/or use of illegal and/or prescription drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and/or vape products\n\nSpecific to dress code - Step 1 - Students will have the opportunity to change into appropriate attire or take off inappropriate attire (ie- hoodie), and can pick up their non-dress code attire at the end of the day in the homeroom.\n\nSpecific to phones/watches/airpods/headphones - Step 1 - Students will turn in their device/technology to the teacher who notes the violation, and can pick it up at the end of the day in the homeroom.\n\nSpecific to plagiarism - Every effort will be made to educate students and ensure their understanding of what plagiarism is, how to properly cite sources, use their own words, and the like. There are educational processes and gradual consequences per grade level for plagiarism that will be reviewed in class. The teacher will contact a parent if plagiarism occurs.\n\nDetention\n\nOur goal is to educate and foster students to make independent, positive and informed decisions. Unfortunately, at times, detentions are warranted. Please note:\n\nParents will be notified via phone and/or email when warnings are given, in order to be a supportive partner in good decision making for their child.\n\nParents will be notified by phone when a detention is assigned, with a follow up referral notice either mailed home, or scanned and emailed.\n\nStudents are not allowed to participate in any sports, special events or extracurricular activities until detentions are served.\n\nIf a recess or lunch detention is assigned, it will be served from the beginning to the end of the period.\n\nIf an after school detention is assigned, it will be served the day it is assigned from 3:15 - 4 p.m. If this is not possible as per parent communication, there will be a mutually agreed upon date.\n\nDuring detention, students may be required to:\n\nPerform community service within the school\n\nComplete a behavior specific writing or reading assignment\n\nSit silently\n\nSubstance Abuse\n\nAny student who consumes drugs or alcohol at a Nardin Academy function or at any other school’s activities will be automatically dismissed from his/her position on any team, club, office, play, etc., and will be given a five (5) day out of school suspension. If a student has more than one offense, they may be expelled. Nardin may also require that the student attend and complete a rehab program.\n\nSuspensions\n\nSuspensions can be assigned at the discretion of the Principal. Suspensions can include in-school and out of school. Suspensions may range in duration depending on the severity of the behavior.\n\nIn-school suspensions:\n\nThe student will attend school and spend their day in the Principal’s office.\n\nThe student will be allowed to complete assigned work from his/her teachers.\n\nOut of school suspensions:\n\nThe student will remain at home for the designated amount of time.\n\nThe student may complete any missed work for a maximum credit of 50%.\n\nFollowing a second suspension at any point throughout the year, the student and parent/guardian will be required to attend a meeting to determine whether the student will be allowed to remain at Nardin.\n\nExpulsion\n\nWhile the permanent dismissal of a student is an extreme measure, there are times when specific acts or repeated patterns disrupt the safety of the school and its learning environment. Thus, Nardin Academy reserves the right to expel any student when Nardin, in its discretion, deems it necessary.\n\nWhen this occurs, parents/guardians will be notified in writing that expulsion is a consideration and why it is being considered (along with a summary of the history of prior disciplinary measures, if any). A meeting will be called between the parents/guardians, teacher(s), Principal and/or President. Minutes of this meeting will be kept. Within forty-eight (48) hours of this meeting, the Principal and the President will confer, and a final decision will be made. Parents/guardians will again be notified in writing and the student’s record appropriately marked. The student may appeal this decision to the President of the Academy.\n\nXIX. Tutoring Policy\n\nYou may decide that your child would benefit from individual tutoring outside of the school day.\n\nNardin Academy teachers may offer tutoring services to enrolled students only. Tutoring is not permitted between the hours of 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. Nardin Academy offers no input, takes no responsibility for, and makes no promises as to the success of any tutoring program. The use of school facilities for tutoring is provided solely as a convenience for our students and their families. All tutoring arrangements, including those for payment, are strictly between the teacher and the student’s family. In order to avoid misplacement, tutoring payment should be given directly to the teacher providing the service.\n\nIf the after school program is the destination for a child released from tutoring, the teacher will walk that child to the appropriate classroom and sign that child into the after school room supervisor’s care.\n\nI. Absence\n\nOn each day of a student’s absence, a parent or guardian must call Nardin before 8:30 a.m. to report the absence. A written excuse is also required for each absence, signed by the parent and delivered to the Main Office the morning that the student returns to school. If an excuse is not received within five school days, the absence is recorded as unexcused. After five absences in a quarter, a guidance counselor will discuss the student’s attendance pattern with her. The phone number for reporting absences is 716-881-6262 extension 3010. New York State legal absences are for personal illness, the illness or death of a family member, impassable roads or weather, or a religious observance.\n\nExcessive unexcused absence, defined as more than 10 days absence from class in a semester course and more than 20 days absence from class in a full-year course, will result in ineligibility for Honor Roll/Merit Roll, participation in sports, club leadership, and exemption from exams.\n\nII. Academic and Service Graduation Requirements\n\nTo graduate from Nardin Academy, a student must fulfill all of Nardin’s requirements. Please note: In addition to the academic requirements, all students must complete 80 documented hours of community service.\n\nEnglish 4 years\n\nSocial Studies 4 years\n\nReligion 4 years*\n\nMath 3 years\n\nScience 3 years\n\nWorld Language 3 years*\n\nElectives 6 semesters\n\nHealth 1 semester\n\nPhysical Education 4 years ***\n\nComputer Science 1 semester\n\nWinter Experience 4 years****\n\n*A transfer student must complete a religion course each year she is in attendance at Nardin.\n\n**Students are required to successfully complete three years of study, at Nardin, in a single world language.\n\n***Students involved in a Nardin sport may opt out of their Physical Education course during the duration of their sport’s season, as long as they are in good standing with their team.

All other classes will receive 1.0 in the calculation of the cumulative average. Nardin Academy only includes its own grades in the cumulative average.\n\nFinal Exams\n\nThere will be a final exam in every course that receives a numeric grade with the exception of AP courses, where the AP exam will be considered the final exam. Mid-year assessments are required for all courses with numeric grades prior to the end of the first semester.\n\nExemptions for final exams will be granted to seniors if the student has earned a 94.0% average in the two semesters and have ten or less full day unexcused absences* in a full-year course. There are no exemptions for underclass students. There are no exemptions for one-semester courses. There are no exemptions for mid-year assessments.\n\n*Excused absences include school sponsored activity, college visits, and medically documented illnesses.\n\nNo assignment will be accepted after the last day of the semester.\n\nProgress Reports\n\nEvery student will receive a Progress Report via PowerSchool in each class at mid-semester that will have current grades and comments on student progress.\n\nAssignment and Test/Quiz Policy\n\nIn order to receive full credit, assignments and projects must be submitted complete and on time. Students may hand in an assignment for reduced credit up to five school days from the due date. After five school days the assignment will receive no credit. Students who are absent are expected to hand in any assignment the day they return to school. Long-term assignments are due on the due date regardless of student attendance that day. Late papers will be penalized. Students are expected to make up missed tests or quizzes the day they return after a one-day absence. If the absence has been for a longer period of time, on the day of her return, the student must see the teacher to schedule a make-up test. A zero will be placed in the test column in PowerSchool until the test has been taken and then it will be replaced by the grade earned. It is expected that students will be responsible for all projects, assignments, notes, tests/quizzes if they have a planned absence. It is absolutely necessary to contact teachers several days prior to such absences in order to obtain the work.\n\nAthletic Participation\n\nAll students may try out for membership on sports teams. The school is committed to providing everyone a fair chance to participate. Unfortunately, not everyone who tries out can be accepted. The decision of the coach, in conjunction with the athletic director, is final. Parents/guardians are encouraged to help their child(ren) understand that not everyone will be selected.\n\nAthletes may participate in only one varsity sport per season.\n\nA current physical exam is required prior to tryouts for any sport.\n\nAn athlete must maintain a 75% average to participate in any sport. If a student’s average falls below 75, a review of her status will be conducted by the athletic director, guidance counselor, and principal.\n\nMisconduct or violation of the school rules may result in removal from the team.\n\nAbsence from school on the day of a game automatically results in the athlete’s ineligibility to participate in that day’s game.\n\nArrival at school after 9:05 a.m., except when due to a physician-verified medical appointment, disqualifies an athlete from participating on that day.\n\nAthletes must be punctual and attend all practices and games.\n\nStudents involved in a Nardin sport may opt out of their Physical Education course during the duration of their sport’s season, as long as they are in good standing with their team. See Athletic Handbook for further guidelines.\n\nContracts for each sport must be signed by the athlete and parent(s)/guardian(s).\n\nParental and guardian athletic consent forms are required for participation.\n\nIV. Backpacks\n\nStudents may carry backpacks during the school day. They must make sure their bags do not block aisles in classrooms.\n\nV. Cell Phone Policy\n\nWhile cell phones are a part of everyday life, they can also be a huge distraction and disruption in a student’s day. Appropriate and respectful use of cell phones is an expectation of all Nardin community members. Cell phones, earpods, Bluetooth devices, or other headphone accessories are NOT PERMITTED in school from 8 a.m. - 2:46 p.m. If a parent needs to contact his/her child for an emergency or important message, they may call the upper school office, and we will get the message to the student. If a student is seen using their cell phone or has their cell phone out of their purse or locker during a time when it is not permitted, the phone will be confiscated and brought to the office, a parent or guardian will be notified by email of the action, and the student must leave her phone in the office for one letter day cycle during the school day. Further disregard for the rules will result in the student being required to leave their phone in the office for three letter day cycles and again, parents/guardians will be notified by email. Other devices, including personal laptops, Kindles, etc. are not permitted during the day. The Internet Safety and Acceptable Use Policy is also in effect at all times.\n\nVI. College Visits\n\nSeniors\n\nThe school sanctions four days of excused absences designated as college visits during the senior year. Students should schedule these visits carefully, being aware of the importance of fulfilling all of their academic responsibilities, and having discussed their plans with their teachers and guidance counselor. The College Visit Permission Form, found in the Guidance Office, must be completed and handed into the Guidance Office at least one week prior to the intended trip. Any college visit beyond the four permitted will be considered an unexcused absence.\n\nJuniors\n\nThe school sanctions two days of excused absences in the second semester designated as college trips for juniors.
