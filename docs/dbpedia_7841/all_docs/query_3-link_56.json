        "text": "NIAGARA UNIV., N.Y. – Associate Athletic Director Theresa Arist has been named Athletic Director at Nardin Academy, a premier college preparatory high school in Western New York.\n\n“I want to thank Ed McLaughlin for bringing me to NU and providing me the opportunities to flourish in my role,” Arist said. “NU is full of hard working and dedicated individuals, especially the athletics department. I will dearly miss working with our coaches, staff, student-athletes, and sport management and game operation students. I will forever cheer for the Purple Eagles.”\n\nArist will be in charge of the athletic programs at Nardin Academy located in Buffalo, N.Y. Nardin Academy, founded in 1857, encompasses three schools – Montesori, Elementary (both co-educational) and high school (young women). Nardin Academy high school has been rated the No. 1 high school locally for 10 straight years.\n\nArist spent the last six seasons as the senior woman administrator at Niagara. Arist oversaw 13 athletic programs, served as the gender equity advisor, directed the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC) and NCAA Life Skills programming and managed game operations for home events. Arist was active within the MAAC, serving on the MAAC Athletic Administration Committee, was the chair of the MAAC Women’s Golf Sport Committee and served on the MAAC Men’s Golf Sport Committee and Awards Committee. Since 2006, Arist was a member of the organizing committee for the NCAA Women’s Leadership Symposium.\n\nPrior to Niagara, Arist was the Assistant Athletic Director/Senior Woman Administrator at Walsh University in North Canton, Ohio for seven years."
