        "text": "Nardin Academy in Buffalo has announced it received a $1 million gift. It is the largest single donation in the school’s history. The donor has asked to remain anonymous. The unrestricted gift will be used for strategic priorities. The school said that would be specifically capital enhancements and student scholarships.\n\n“Nardin is blessed to have people who believe deeply in our mission and vision for the future, and this gift is a tangible and significant investment in our school,” said President Marsha Joy Sullivan. “We have strategic goals to enhance our facilities so that our students are prepared for an ever-changing society and have additional resources to ensure that the Nardin experience is accessible for more families. With this gift, Nardin will do both.”\n\nNardin Board Chair Lisa Walsh said while the donor will remain anonymous, the motivating factor for the gift was clear.\n\n“Our donor believes that Nardin’s time is now,” she said. “They see our focus and commitment to academic excellence, character development, and health and wellness, and they chose to give their support. We are beyond grateful for this gift. It is evidence that Nardin Academy continues to be a worthy investment,” said Walsh.\n\nNardin, founded in 1857, is an independent Catholic school in Buffalo for boys and girls in Montessori and elementary school, grades K-8, and an all-girls high school."
