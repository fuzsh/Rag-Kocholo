This holiday season, they will have to be recipients of others' good deeds. All five members of the Seaton <strong>family</strong> escaped from the 3:45 a.m. blaze unharmed, but with only the clothes on their back. The fire ravaged their Heritage Street home <strong>in</strong> the Palmer apd Haggerty area. \"Neighbors pitched <strong>in</strong>land gave us clothes. Between all of them, we all have shoes that fit,\" said David Seaton. His wife, Kelly, said they returned to their home the next day and rummaged through the debris. They were able to f<strong>in</strong>d David's driver's license and a credit card. \"They were charred around the edges, but (the store) took them any- way,\" Kelly said. <strong>Canton</strong> firefighters reached <strong>in</strong>to their <strong>Canton</strong> Firefighters No. 2289 Charity Foundation fund to help pay for hotel expenses for the <strong>family</strong> until other liv<strong>in</strong>g arrangements are made. On Monday, firefighter Mike Caruso presented David and Kelly with a check for $500. \"One of the reasons we have it is to help families and people <strong>in</strong> tragedies like this,\" said Caruso. \"Their home was gutted and they were burned out without any material possessions whatsoever.\" In the midst of the devastat<strong>in</strong>g loss, the Seaton <strong>family</strong> counted their bless<strong>in</strong>gs that they all made it of the burn<strong>in</strong>g house alive. Firefighters said the fire reached temperatures of between 1200 to 1500 degrees judg<strong>in</strong>g by the metal high beam that expanded from the massive heat.

The decision was based on a provision of the law that allows the county road commission — or road department as <strong>in</strong> Wayne County's case — and township to reduce the speed limit to not less than 15 mph on roads adjacent to a park. The half-mile stretch of Morton Taylor dead-ends at Flod<strong>in</strong> Park. However, it appears state police won't be conced<strong>in</strong>g. Residents pushed for the lower limit after a bicyclist was killed after be<strong>in</strong>g struck by a van Sept. 9. The van was driv<strong>in</strong>g with<strong>in</strong> the posted 40 mph limit, accord<strong>in</strong>g to <strong>Canton</strong> Police. \"There has been a traffic control order (TCO) for some STAN PHOTO BY BILL BKXSLO time on Morton Taylor for 40 mph. The TCO has not been changed, even though some authority with<strong>in</strong> Wayne County decided to post a temporary 25 mph sign. This is contrary to what state law says <strong>in</strong> the motor vehicle code,\" said Sgt. Jeff Corbit of the state police, Northville Post. An 85 percentile speed study conducted <strong>in</strong> late September determ<strong>in</strong>ed vehicles were travel<strong>in</strong>g an average of 41 mph on Morton Taylor, said Corbit. Sgt. Bill Brandt of the Lans<strong>in</strong>g state police post is nowhandl<strong>in</strong>g the case. \"Right now there's basically a TCO be<strong>in</strong>g ignored. I don't th<strong>in</strong>k the local authority has a right to supersede,\" he said. Several Morton Taylor residents and their attorney Marc Susselman said the provision of the law that, takes <strong>in</strong>to account the close vic<strong>in</strong>ity of the park will w<strong>in</strong> out <strong>in</strong> the end. Resident John Irv<strong>in</strong> said the \"temporary\" sighs have already been taken down and that's an <strong>in</strong>kl<strong>in</strong>g that the 25 mph limit is <strong>in</strong> process of becom<strong>in</strong>g official. But Brandt said the state police \"have the valid TCO signed See SPEED, A4 Holiday feast warms woman's heart BY CASEY HANS STAFF WRITER Carol Koshy has much to be thankful for this year - even more so on Thanksgiv<strong>in</strong>g day.
