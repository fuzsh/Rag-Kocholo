        "text": "The Fitzgerald family visited the Exposition, and in September 1903 they moved back to Buffalo, this time around the corner from the Lenox, at 29 Irving Place, in Allentown, not far from the the Proctor & Gamble offices at 683 Main Street. Scott was now seven years old, a handsome little kid with gray-green eyes and blond hair.\n\nBiographer Andrew Turnbull described Irving Place this way: \"A single tree-lined block- a lovely sheltered spot for a poet to grow up in. Children played ball in the dappled shade or raced their buckboards down the sloping street, one of the first where asphalt had replaced the universal cobbles.\"\n\nIt was a time when Irving residents lighted the summer nights with Japanese lanterns stretched across porches. Although it is rumored that Fitzgerald acted out plays in this attic, the current owner (in June of 2000), Alison Kimberly, points out that there is no attic in the building.\n\nHis best friend was a boy named Hamilton Wende, whose family had theatrical connections and who obtained free tickets for Teck Theater matinees. Spellbound, the boys would rush home to re-enact the plays. They gave performances for the neighborhood children and charged admission.\n\nAnother boyhood friend was Ted Keating, whose Delaware Avenue home had a common backyard with 29 Irving. The boys would tie long stretches of string to each other's toes at night, so they could awaken each other in the morning.\n\nAt 7, Scott already showed the style that would be his hallmark. So polished was he that his father joked he'd give $5 to hear Scott swear. He learned dancing at the Century Club. A dance card that Scott kept yields prominent Buffalo names. Dorothy Knox, for instance, was Seymour Knox's sister, and Harriet Mack's family owned the Buffalo Times. The Macks lived at the head of Highland Avenue in a big old Victorian house, the Norman Mack House.\n\nThe late Austin M. Fox wrote the following in the December Issue of Buffalo Spree: \"Early on, Scott exhibited considerable interest in girls. Accordingly, he seems to have particularly enjoyed Van Arnum's dancing classes, where his blond good looks and his dancing finesse made a hit with young daughters of well-connected families, such as Kitty Williams, Marie Lautz, and Dorothy Knox, whom he mentions in his 'Thoughtbook.' He records that he won first place in Kitty's affection until dancing school stopped in the spring, at which time he lost the coveted position to rival Johnny Gowans (later a brilliant, well-known, all-around amateur athlete in this area).\n\n\"Present local descendants of Kitty, Marie and Dorothy can add a certain folklore status to their family histories by mentioning at appropriate times, that their grandmother or great-aunt had been kissed by Scott Fitzgerald during youthful post office games at a party of the dancing school group.\""
