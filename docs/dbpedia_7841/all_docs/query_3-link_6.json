Educating children from age 18 months until 18 years, Nardin has co-ed Montessori, Lower and Middle Schools and a college preparatory Upper School for young women.\n\nNardin provides students with the highest standards of excellence in academics, athletics and the arts while upholding a deep commitment to service in the tradition of the DHM. Our students go on to make significant contributions to our school, our communities and our world."
