Our Founders

The Daughters of the Heart of Mary (DHM) were founded in 1790 in Paris, France during the height of the French Revolution by Fr. Pierre Joseph de Cloriviere SJ and Marie Adelaide de Cice. Both dreamed of a new way of living an authentic, vowed religious life in the midst of the world, without any distinguishing sign, habit, or cloister.

Today, the DHM continue to work to build a world in which the primary values are equality and justice for all God's people, endeavor to be a community in which each member's God-given gifts are appreciated and nurtured, and work for an earth that is protected and restored.

Our History

Nardin Academy was founded in 1857 as the first Catholic Academy and free school in Buffalo, NY by Daughters of the Heart of Mary: Ernestine Nardin, Victorine Boucher, and Eliza Smyth. Endeavoring to help educate the children of the diocese, particularly girls, in a faith-based culture, the DHM opened both the Academy during the day and funded a free school for girls without means at night.

While it was officially named "St. Mary's Academy and Industrial Female School," the school was known in the community as "Miss Nardin's Academy." The name was changed to “The Nardin Academy” in 1917 and finally to “Nardin Academy” in 1951.

Throughout Nardin’s history the Daughters of the Heart of Mary have permeated life on campus, both as staff and as guidance on the Board of Trustees.

Following this example, Nardin Academy students develop their talents and cultivate their intellect, character and courage so that they too can make a difference in the world.
