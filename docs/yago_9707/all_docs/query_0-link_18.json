        "text": "British film director and producer (born 1944)\n\nJamil Dehlavi (Urdu: جمیل دہلوی) (born 1944) is a London-based independent film director and producer of Pakistani-French origin.[1][2][3] Since he became a filmmaker in the 1970s, his work has been widely screened internationally, notable films including Jinnah (1998), about the partition of India and the birth of Pakistan, which won the Grand Prize at the Festival of the Dhow Countries, Best International Film at the World Film Awards in Indonesia, the Gold Award at Worldfest Flagstaff, Best Foreign Film at Worldfest Houston, and was nominated for a Golden Pyramid at the Cairo International Film Festival.[4]\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn in Calcutta, West Bengal, to a French mother and an Pathan-Indian father who was a diplomat and subsequently travelled extensively between Asia and Europe, Dehlavi is fluent in five languages (English, French, Italian, Spanish and Urdu).[5][2] He studied at Karachi Grammar School, then at international schools in Paris and Rome, before going to Rugby School and Oxford University.[2] He graduated with a BA degree in Politics and French Literature and an MA (Hons) in Jurisprudence. He was subsequently called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn but never practised, preferring instead to go into the world of cinema.[1] Dehlavi studied film directing at Columbia University in New York, where he was awarded an MFA degree.[3]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile studying in New York, Dehlavi trained as an actor with Stella Adler and made his first feature film, Towers of Silence, which he wrote, produced and directed. It won the Grand Prize at the Festival of the Americas. His next film, The Blood of Hussain (1980), was selected by the Director's Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival and won the Grand Prize at the Taormina Film Festival. All of his subsequent films have also won major awards at film festivals all over the world.\n\nDehlavi has worked on various projects for the BBC, Channel Four, and French television, including Qâf – The Sacred Mountain, which won awards at five environmental film festivals. He worked on Passover, a passion play shot in Córdoba and made in collaboration with the celebrated flamenco guitarist Paco Peña. Dehlavi has also worked in the Radio & Visual Services Division at the United Nations and as an Associate Professor in the School of Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences at Habib University in Karachi.[3]\n\nIn August 2018, the BFI Southbank presented a retrospective of his work entitled Between the Sacred and the Profane: The Cinema of Jamil Dehlavi, which was described as \"a rare opportunity to examine the contribution of one of the most intriguing and least understood figures of cinema.\"[2] With screenings of several films held over the weekend of 10–12 August, the event also featured a conversation with Dehlavi.[6][7]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\n1973: The Guitarist (starring Jamil Dehlavi & Ellen Pauwels)\n\nGold Medal – Atlanta Film Festival\n\n1976: Towers of Silence (starring Judy Van Hook & Jamil Dehlavi)[2]\n\nGrand Prize - Festival of the Americas\n\n1980: The Blood of Hussain (starring Salman Peerzada, Kika Markham, Durriya Kazi & Jamil Dehlavi)[2][1]\n\nDirector's Fortnight - Cannes Film Festival\n\nGrand Prize – Taormina Film Festival\n\nGold Award – Worldfest Houston\n\nGold Hugo Nomination Best Feature Film – Chicago International Film Festival\n\n1984: Qâf – The Sacred Mountain (short documentary film, also known as Qâf)[2]\n\nBest Environmental Film – Jackson Hole Mountain Film Festival\n\nSpecial Jury Award – Telluride Mountain Film Festival\n\nSilver Gentian Best Mountain Film – Trento Mountain Film Festival\n\nDiable d'Or – Les Diablerets, Switzerland\n\nBest Environmental Documentary – Worldfest Houston\n\n1986: Born of Fire (starring Peter Firth & Suzan Crowley)[1]\n\nOfficial Selection – Avoriaz Film Festival\n\nCatalan Award – Imagfic Madrid\n\nGold Award Best Feature Film – Worldfest Houston\n\nGold Hugo Nomination Best Feature Film – Chicago International Film Festival\n\n1992: Immaculate Conception (starring Melissa Leo, James Wilby, Shabana Azmi & Zia Mohyeddin)[1]\n\nPanorama – Berlin International Film Festival\n\nSpecial Jury Prize – Dinard Film Festival\n\nGold Hugo Nomination Best Feature Film – Chicago International Film Festival\n\n1996: Passover (short film starring Jorge de Juan & Belen Fernandez)[2]\n\n1997: Passion in the Desert [Producer] (starring Ben Daniels & Michel Piccoli)\n\n1998: Jinnah (starring Christopher Lee, James Fox, Maria Aitken & Shashi Kapoor)[1][2][8]\n\nGrand Prize – Zanzibar International Film Festival\n\nBest International Film – World Film Awards, Indonesia\n\nGold Award Best Foreign Film – Worldfest Flagstaff\n\nSilver Award – Worldfest Houston\n\nGolden Pyramid Nomination – Cairo International Film Festival\n\n2006: Infinite Justice (starring Kevin Collins & Raza Jaffrey)[1][2]\n\nFIPRESCI International Critics Prize\n\nBest European Feature Film – European Independent Film Festival, Paris\n\nRobert Rodriguez Prize for Excellence – Hollywood DV Festival\n\nCritic's Prize – Amiens International Film Festival\n\nAudience Award Best Film – Florence River to River Festival\n\nSpecial Jury Award – Worldfest Houston\n\nBest Supporting Actor: Raza Jaffrey - Karafilm Festival, Karachi\n\n2010: Godforsaken (starring Annabel Wright, Trevor White & Nick Ashdon)[1]\n\nGolden Palm Award – Mexico International Film Festival\n\nSpecial Jury Remi and Best International Film Award – Worldfest Houston\n\nBest Actress Nomination: Annabel Wright – Milan International Film Festival, Italy\n\nBest European Feature Nomination - European Independent Film Festival, France\n\nBest Film Nomination – Beverly Hills Hi-Def Film Festival\n\nBest Digital Film Nomination – Cairo International Film Festival, Egypt\n\nBest Film Nomination – Portobello International Film Festival, London\n\n2014: Seven Lucky Gods[1]\n\nGrand Prize, Tirana International Film Festival\n\nBest Feature Film – Canada International Film Festival\n\nGold Lion Award – Barcelona International Film Festival\n\nBest Feature Film – Honolulu Film Awards, Hawaii\n\nBest Feature Film – Delhi International Film Festival\n\nSpecial Jury Prize – Worldfest Houston\n\nBest Actor (Nik Xhelilaj) – Worldfest Houston\n\nBest Actress Nomination (Alison Peebles) – Worldfest Houston\n\nBest Original Screenplay – St. Tropez International Film Festival\n\nBest Lead Actress (Alison Peebles) – St. Tropez International Film Festival\n\nBronze Palm Award – Mexico International Film Festival\n\nBest Foreign Film Nomination – Phoenix Film Festival\n\nBest Production Design Nomination (Jamil Dehlavi) – Milan Film Festival\n\nBest Supporting Actress Nomination (Kate Maravan) – Milan Film Festival\n\nBest Supporting Actor Nomination (Christopher Villiers) – Madrid International Film Festival\n\n2016: Blood Money (short film)\n\nShort Film Corner – Cannes Film Festival\n\nBest Picture – West Coast International Film Festival, USA\n\nHonorable Mention Award – Berlin International Film Awards\n\nFinalist – Polish International Film Festival\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
