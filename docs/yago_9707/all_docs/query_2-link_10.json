        "text": "Jamil Dehlavi's films create a unique impression, he is a genius in exploring various themes. Having shot avant-garde works, historical dramas, religious fables, conflicts, myths and socio-economic commentary. I can consider him in the list of the few living directors that have a brilliant understanding of the medium. Though in his 70s, the radical filmmaker is still spewing out films without sign of slowing down and I'm still waiting for his next release which was announced in 2020. It is very rare for this title to be mentioned and never finds a place in the list of surreal films. Criminally ignored, and I wanted to share my thoughts on this nightmare.\n\nA semi-autobiographical impression, a reminiscence of images from childhood, which revives the memory of the author's uncle who rebelled against the family and eloped with the daughter of a Zoroastrian high priest. Jamil Dehlavi looks to the past, that of his family and of his country. He has taken a real incident that occurred in his family and weaved it into the story. The visuals and narrative are composed of his memories of witnessing Zoroastrian funerary rituals as the scenes oscillate between past and present, and sometimes are both at once. Dehlavi merges the traumatic landscapes of sex, politics, death and faith as he becomes obsessed with the death rituals- something juxtaposed with the extended image of vultures, skulls and skeletons. There is so much happening and an attempt to summarize the plot would be an exercise in futility.\n\nVisually, Towers of Silence is like what you would get if you combined Katsu Kanai, Amos Gitai, Jos√© Val del Omar, Shirin Neshat, Parviz Kimiavi, Fernando Arrabal, Bahram Beizai with Rafael Corkidi's cinematography. Equally haunting in all this is the soundtrack, it accentuates the film's sensuality, warbled in Hindustani music. I wish someone will use the images and create a video for a Black metal band or for any Melechesh songs.\n\nAnyway, the 1st reviewer finds it disjointed but no big deal. After all, in the words of David Lynch 'I don't know why people expect art to make sense. They accept the fact that life doesn't make sense'. Is there any sense in that? It is in this experience that Dehlavi indulges us. It is not simple, nor is it easy to immerse yourself in such an experience. It is a film to experience and feel, as are our dreams, fears, memories and nightmares. Everything raw and direct, without filters, as it should be. For me, his films always flabbergasts me in every single moment with awe."
