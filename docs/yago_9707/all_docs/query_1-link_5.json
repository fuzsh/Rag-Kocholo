While Alistair is embroiled in a brief love affair with a Pakistani photographer, Hannah conceives and decides to convert to Islam, coaxing Alistair to do the same, causing a conflict with her family. Meanwhile, the eunuchs from the shrine develop an interest in Hannah's baby, leading to tension from the clash of cultures and religious beliefs.[1][2][3]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nJames Wilby as Alistair\n\nMelissa Leo as Hannah\n\nShabana Azmi as Samira\n\nZia Mohyeddin as Shehzada\n\nJames Cossins as Godfrey\n\nShreeram Lagoo as Dadaji\n\nRonny Jhutti as Kamal\n\nTim Choate as David Schwartz\n\nBill Bailey as American Consul\n\nBadi Uzzaman as Dadaji's Retainer\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nKim Newman reviewing the film in Empire Online wrote, \"despite trying to shoehorn oodles of secondary themes into the brew, the psychological tug-of-war between Islam and Judaism, some nasty imperialist behaviour, and the downbeat ending make this well worth a look, if for no other reason than Western audiences rarely get a chance to see anything vaguely Asian.\"[2]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nJamil Dehlavi\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
