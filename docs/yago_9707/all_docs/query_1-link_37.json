        "text": "The main purpose of writing this book is to teach medical students and residents how to read simple plain x-ray abdomen. Plain x-ray abdomen is done in emergency when the patient arrives with acute abdominal pain. The first person to see this x-rays are young residents and it is hoped this book will help them in reading them methodically and not missing a diagnosis like perforated viscus, with free air under the diphragm. Waiting for a radiologist report till next morning may be too late. All x-rays must be seen by radiologist as they have a better eye to catch up the finer details. Residents needs to be familiar with common acute surgical conditions diagnosed on plain x-ray abdomen done in emergency.\n\nThe partition of India is etched in the history of the Indian subcontinent. The tragedy that unfolded with the mass expedition of people from different areas to the newly created states of India and Pakistan has been the subject of various movies, books and poetry. Many scholars have focused on the political progression that directed to the division of India, the creation of Pakistan, and the associated violence. Numerous people have attempted to find out who was the guilty and how far mutual ideas had made inroads into secular parties and sensibilities. But the main objective of this paper is to reveal the personality of Mohammad Ali Jinnah who played an important role in drawing boundaries between India and Pakistan. Jinnah had visualized that Pakistan would be a homeland for the Muslims of India without knowing that partition would give a free lead to genocide, mass migration and untold sufferings on millions. There has been much speculation about the role of the British in stepping up the partition, and Gandhi's inability to prevent it. Whatever the causes of the partition, the brute facts cannot be challenged. All available evidences show that Jinnah alone was not responsible for the creation of Pakistan. Partition was not only the result of the British divide and rule policy but also the outcome of exact political blueprint to carry the partition of the country. In the present paper the role of Jinnah in the creation of Pakistan has been analyzed in context to Jaswant Singh's book \" Jinnah – India – Partition – Independence \" and Jamil Dehlavi's film \" Jinnah \" ."
