The film was released in February 1981 in the UK. The film was banned throughout Pakistan as the military junta led by General Zia-ul-Haq toppled the government of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.[1][2][3]\n\nPremise\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film is about the life and death of Imam Hussain (as), the youngest son of a Pakistani family. He meets a holy soothsayer who foretells his destiny, which is to liberate the poor and oppressed against a tyrannical government. Parallels exist between the film's plot and the historical Battle of Karbala between Imam Hussain and Yazid ibn Muawiya during the 7th century history of Islam.[3][1]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nAliya Begum\n\nDurriya [1][3]\n\nFauzia Zareen\n\nKabuli Baba[1]\n\nKhayyam Sarhadi\n\nImran Peerzada\n\nKika Markham[1][3]\n\nJamil Dehlavi\n\nMirza Ghazanfar Beg[1]\n\nMubila\n\nSalmaan Peerzada[1][3]\n\nSamina Peerzada[3]\n\nSaqi\n\nShoaib Hashmi[3]\n\nZil-e-Subhan\n\nAlternative titles\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Blood of Hussain is known as To Aima tou agonisti in Greece, Husseins Herzblut in Germany and Le Sang d'Hussain in France.\n\nBanning\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film was banned by the Pakistani military ruler General Zia ul-Haq, after he seized power in a coup de Ã©tat and became President of Pakistan in 1977, as the film portrays a fictional military coup in a less than favourable light. The ban on the film has not been lifted, and the director later moved to the United Kingdom. The film was eventually released and shown on British television.[3][4]\n\nCredits\n\n[edit]\n\nDirector: Jamil Dehlavi[1]\n\nProduction Company: Parindah Films Limited[1]\n\nProducer: Jamil Dehlavi[1]\n\nAssociate Producer: Sharira Masood, Sandra Marsh\n\nProduction Accountant: Gerry Wheatley\n\nProduction Manager: Kaiser Baig\n\nAssistant Director: Imran Peerzada\n\nContinuity: Omar Norman, Marian Nicholson\n\nScreenplay: Jamil Dehlavi\n\nDialogue Writer: Raficq Abdulla\n\nDirector of Photography: Walter Lassally, Jamil Dehlavi\n\nAssistant Camera: Ashiq Rahi\n\nFocus Puller: Tony Garratt\n\nKey Grip: Afzal Akhtar\n\nElectrician: Barkat Joseph, Mohammed Saeed\n\nSpecial Effects: Colin Arthur\n\nEditor: Sue Collins, Jamil Dehlavi\n\ncost: Rashida Masood\n\nMake-up: Colin Arthur\n\nTitles/Opticals: Les Latimer Film Associates\n\nMusic Supervisor: Jamil Dehlavi\n\nPlayback singer: Reshma\n\nSound: Christian Wangler, Shahid Rasool\n\nBoom Operator: Javed Khan\n\nDubbing Mixer: Paul Carr\n\nSound Editor: Martin Evans\n\nStudio: Mark One Films Studios, (London)\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nRelease date: 1980[1]\n\nCountry: Pakistan[1]\n\nSystem: N/A\n\nFormat: 35mm Film\n\nLength: 10068 Feet\n\nRun time: 112.0 mins.\n\nColour/Black and White: Colour\n\nColour systems: N/A\n\nSound/Silent: Sound\n\nSound systems: N/A\n\nLanguage: Urdu, English, Punjabi and Seraiki\n\nTV transmission\n\n[edit]\n\nFirst Transmission date: February 16, 1983\n\nCountry: Great Britain\n\nSeries/Slot: N/A\n\nStart time: 22:00\n\nStop time: 00:00\n\nDuration: 120 mins.\n\nCompany: N/A\n\nChannel: Channel Four\n\nSecond transmission date: October 2, 1988\n\nCountry: Great Britain\n\nSeries/Slot: N/A\n\nStart time: N/A\n\nStop time: N/A\n\nDuration: N/A\n\nCompany: Channel Four\n\nChannel: N/A\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nJamil Dehlavi\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
