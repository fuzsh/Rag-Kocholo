        "text": "This is the story of the first time I fell in love. We had known each other for many years — since I was a child, infact.\n\nI grew up in a very religiously fluid home, my father was a Yemeni-Indian/Pakistani Sunni, my mother an Iraqi Shia — my siblings and I just some Karachi kids struggling to keep up with school and work. As children, we never really picked a side. But every year we would go to the Bara Imam Bara in Kharadar and light candles on the eve of Ashura. Afterwards my father would take us to Bakda Hotel for kababs and biryani. I did not know it but all this time, I was indulging in an act of love — for Hussain. In lighting candles, I was loving Hussain. In beating my chest, I was loving Hussain.\n\nThe ritualistic mourning and it’s celebration of grief and loss, taught me to love and lose without fear. The concept of honoring death through life itself — in the practice of expressing love through pain. It seems a bit macabre but it is the ultimate tragic, romance. A tragedy for all eras. But I think we can all agree that love is a creative force — it births new feelings. It changes us, it changes our surroundings — it changes our very essence.\n\nHussain changed my life. He set me free. I first met Hussain in 2017 during Ashura in Karbala. It was a home coming. It was like being held in a warm embrace. It was being told, it’s okay, I am here for you. 4 to 5 million people visit Karbala each year for Ashura, yet I felt that personal connection with my Imam — the thirst, the heat, the discomfort.\n\nAs I answered the call of Hussain in Karbala, I experienced love in practice. Iraqis opened their hearts and homes. They offered food, water, tea and even foot massages. Why? For the love of Hussain. And we were all answering this call of love together — for no returns. Alot of people gave me duaas to be delivered. I did so with complete honesty. But I was unable to ask for anything for myself. My reward was that freedom. It was a kind of rebirth — possibly after a violent death — almost like a recalibration of your relationship with life itself. To love Hussain was to be completely broken and rise again, not vengeful but more compassionate than ever before.\n\nThere’s also the physical nature of the relationship. To beat a beating heart is to give it renewed rigour. To feel the blood flow from your veins to your skin is to say ‘I love you and I don’t care care about what anyone thinks of that. To love Hussain is to take ownership of your mind and body. To keep giving and keep loving, no matter what."
