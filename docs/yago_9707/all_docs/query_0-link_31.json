        "text": "(Jamil Dehlavi, 1992)\n\nRelease date: 25 March 2019 (OOP date: 8 April 2024)\n\nLimited Edition Blu-ray (World Blu-ray premiere)\n\nA Western couple (played by Melissa Leo and James Wilby) working in Pakistan visit an unconventional holy shrine to harness its spiritual powers to help them conceive a child. They are lavished with the attentions of the shrine’s leader (an exceptional performance from Zia Mohyeddin – Lawrence of Arabia, Khartoum) and her followers, but their methods and motives are not all that they seem, and the couple’s lives are plunged into darkness.\n\nThis ravishing, unsettling film from director Jamil Dehlavi (The Blood of Hussain, Born of Fire) is a deeply personal work which raises questions of cultural and sexual identity, religious fanaticism and the abuses of power. The brand-new 2K restoration from the original negative was supervised and approved by Dehlavi and cinematographer Nic Knowland.\n\nINDICATOR LIMITED EDITION BLU-RAY SPECIAL FEATURES"
