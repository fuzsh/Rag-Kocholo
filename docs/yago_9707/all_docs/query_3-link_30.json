We aim to build a more selfless society, with our teams all around the world engaging in random acts of kindness, not for a reward but because it is the right thing to do.\n\nA global movement of compassion.\n\nThe stand of Hussain has spurred a global social justice movement. With over 90 teams in 5 continents around the world feeding, clothing and supporting the oppressed, we aim to stand up for social justice and against all forms of social injustice.\n\nInspired by Hussain’s timeless legacy.\n\nHussain’s timeless legacy belongs to all of humanity, and demand we not just listen to his story but act on his inspiration. We believe our teams embody the selfless values of Hussain and spread his principles through action and not just words."
