        "text": "There's nothing quite like being on the jury at the Taormina Film Festival where, on the final night in the vast and ancient amphitheatre overlooked by permanently steaming Mount Etna, the prizes are dispensed in front of 30 000 excited Sicilians as prelude to the Italian Oscar awards.\n\nThat meant 18 million television viewers watching as well, with each juror introduced either to cheers or catcalls (cheers for me, since Italy after all beat England and they could afford to be generous).\n\nThis year, though, there were better moments for Britain than just that since the festival's Special Jury Prize for the most striking and original first feature went to Chris Petit's Radio On and John Schlesinger won a Donatello award for his general work as director.\n\nPetit's film, on the eve of its release in Italy, is the first British Film Institute Production Board venture to receive a major award at an international festival.\n\nThat award did not split the jury.\n\nJamil Dehlavi's The Blood of Hussain, which got the Grand Prize, caused considerably more argument. But then the Pakistani film, shown out of competition at Cannes and the first from its country to get such an award has been dogged with controversy from the start.\n\nDehlavi completed shooting a few months before General Zia assumed control in Pakistan and, when he did, it was at once banned. Dehlavi himself had his passport taken away and was refused work either in films or on television. Fortunately, however, the film reached England for lab work just in time.\n\nThe film is concerned with the life and eventual murder of Hussain Murtaza, the younger son of an old land owning family in Pakistan. His struggle against a tyrannical and illegitimate military government is a modern metaphor for the martyrdom and Iman Hussain, grandson of Mohammed, who was killed by the forces of the usurper Caliph Yezid in AD 680.\n\nNot surprisingly the present government in Pakistan saw it as dangerously radical film and deeply regretted the money given to it by Pakistan Film Development Board instituted under Bhutto's regime. Its award at Taormina, however, is of some significance for the other young film-makers of Pakistan who are desperately seeking to break away from commercial projects forced upon them by assembly-line producers."
