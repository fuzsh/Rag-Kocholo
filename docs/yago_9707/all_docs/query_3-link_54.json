        "text": "Minhaj Interfaith and Welfare Foundation (MIWF) started a blood donation campaign across India in the month of Muharram. The campaign was inspired by Imam Hussain (AS)’s sacrifice to donate blood for the good of the community.\n\nThe blood donation campaign aims to increase the number of regular blood donors from Muslim communities through the idea of people saving lives. It is inspired by the teachings of Islam, which honors human life, and guides Muslims to do everything to respect and preserve it.\n\nAs part of the non-profit campaign, called #GiveBloodGiveLife, blood donation centers across India collected blood from more than 1000 people. The blood donation camps were held in Kashmir, Ahmedabad, Mundra, Mandvi, Mysuru, Hassan, Bengaluru, New Delhi, Hyderabad, Kishanganj, etc.\n\nDr. Ziauddin Al-Sheikh, MIWF Blood donation campaign organizer said, “Our aim through this campaign was to serve humanity and save lives through it and we are overwhelmed by the response we got. I wholeheartedly appreciate the teams who took up the cause in very short time and delivered it with superb outcomes.”\n\nRafeeq Ahmed Khan (MIWF President) said, “Blood is one of the most precious gifts that anyone can give to another person. On behalf of MIWF, we thank the selfless voluntary blood donors from across India who responded to our call and participated in this life-saving mission.”"
