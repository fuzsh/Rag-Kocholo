        "text": "Why Imaam Hussain (A.S.) is not forgotten?\n\nDetails\n\nCreated: Sunday, 20 October 2013 19:34\n\nThe one whose martyrdom, grief, pain, sorrows and children's captivity were all only for God will never fade out of the memories. Instead, by the pace of time and age his love, fascination, and charm will grow in the hearts of people. And each year the love and fascination of the people with respect to that \"pure and chaste revolutionary\" increases. Imaam Hussain (A.S.) spent 57 years of his prolific life for the sake of God's love and God's search. Many times he traveled, to the God's house for pilgrimage, on foot. He was very fond of prayers confessions and supplication talking intimately. So far so, that on the last night of his life, he asked for respite only that he might sit all alone and make confessions and supplications, to his God.\n\nRead more ...\n\nHIM Funeral Services\n\nDetails\n\nCreated: Sunday, 20 October 2013 19:34\n\n*Important Update on Funeral Fund Policy - Dated 23 Dec 2023*\n\nAs-salamu Alaikum,\n\nAfter careful evaluation of various cost models and community needs, we have decided that in future, HIM will not take any new funeral fund members. Instead, HIM will adopt a pay as you go option for funeral service that will cover Transferring the body from hospital/home to mosque, perform ghusl - kaffan, cold room storage, arrange for namaz e janaza and then transfer the Janazah to the burial site. The cost for this service to the family will be capped at £200 (without coffin) or £400 (with coffin). This price cap will be reviewed annually. Please note the Responsibility for arranging the grave, completing legal work like issuance of Green form, registration of death etc will be on the deceased's family. Mission's funeral fund committee will only advise on the procedures to be followed. The cost of the grave in most cemeteries around Hounslow ranges from £2500-£8500 and is dependent on many factors, primarily whether the deceased was the resident of that council or not. To pay for this significant expense, for some of you, taking a personal funeral plan that provides a cash lump sum, from commercial providers will be the best option. Some may find the services offered by bigger groups like Pakistan Welfare Association (PWA) to be more financially and logistically advantageous. However, PWA only covers Hounslow and adjacent six Boroughs only. Please refer to PWA's website for full terms & conditions. Whatever works best for your own circumstances, please make a plan towards your funeral costs and not leave it for the heirs to pick up the bill.\n\nExisting Funeral Fund Members\n\nA maximum payment of £1600 will be made to the next of kin to help with funeral costs. Only deduction will be the cost of the coffin (£200), if utilised. These members too have to plan to bridge the gap between Mission payout amount and the cost of grave. Please also note that the existing funeral fund plan is for the named individuals or maximum the couple (if agreed and written on the application form). It will not cover any additional family members. Please ensure your payments are up to date as missed payments will result in cancelling of the membership. If you have any questions, please speak to Br Ibne Ali or email to This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.\n\nVolunteers Training\n\nHIM Funeral Fund Committee is made up entirely of volunteers. A workshop will soon be arranged to provide training related to Ghussal Kaffan and other requirements. Please attend if you want to be part of this rewarding experience."
