        "text": "Dr. M. Tarique Hussain graduated from Queens’ College, University of Cambridge (UK) where he was elected as a Queens’ college scholar for his academic achievements. He undertook cardiology fellowships at Birmingham Children’s Hospital (UK) and the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow (UK). He further underwent advanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cardiac computed tomography training (CT) at King’s College London, where he completed his doctoral degree (PhD) in Imaging Sciences. His thesis was on the subject of magnetic resonance imaging in pediatric coronary vasculopathy with a special focus on post-transplant coronary vasculopathy and aortic correlates of coronary disease.\n\nSince then, Dr. Hussain continued to work as an academic senior lecturer and staff pediatric cardiologist with an interest in clinical cardiac imaging (including X-ray angiography; MRI, CT and echocardiography). During this time he has been prolific in his research work and has been internationally acclaimed for his use of cutting edge technology to improve the healthcare of children (e.g. BBC Breakfast, BBC News online, Telegraph).\n\nDr. Hussain moved to UT Southwestern in 2015 to take up the position of director of congenital cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at Children's Medical Center. His current research interests are in congenital heart disease, heart transplantation and cardiomyopathies. Since moving to this position at UTSW, Dr Hussain has built a clinical cardiac imaging program and research team (including post-doctoral students, training fellows, collaborators and peers). He continued to secure and manage grant-funded research as principal investigator (including NSF funding) and has mentored numerous trainees and junior faculty. His work in interventional cardiac MRI, three-dimenesional imaging and computational modelling continues to receive international recognition."
