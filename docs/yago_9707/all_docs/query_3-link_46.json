Being a carer has given me a unique perspective and a deep appreciation for the challenges carers for people with diabetes face.\n\nAnnjulie Sungkur (Switzerland)\n\nI have lived with type 1 diabetes my entire life, navigating its challenges through every stage, including my tumultuous adolescent years. Like life, diabetes has its highs and lows. Just as we experience the lows, we can reach the highs again, no matter how low we have been.\n\nAbdul Basit Khan (Pakistan)\n\nAs the President of Meethi Zindagi, an organisation that provides healthcare to underprivileged children with type 1 diabetes in Pakistan, and the husband of a person with type 1 diabetes, I have an in-depth understanding of the challenges people with diabetes and their caregivers face."
