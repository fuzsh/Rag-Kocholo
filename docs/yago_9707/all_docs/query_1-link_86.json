They are lavished with the attentions of the shrineâ€™s leader (an exceptional performance from Zia Mohyeddin â€“ <em>Lawrence of Arabia</em>, <em>Khartoum</em>) and her followers, but their methods and motives are not all that they seem, and the coupleâ€™s lives are plunged into darkness.<br/><br/>This ravishing, unsettling film from director Jamil Dehlavi (<em>The Blood of Hussain</em>, <em>Born of Fire</em>) is a deeply personal work which raises questions of cultural and sexual identity, religious fanaticism and the abuses of power. The brand-new 2K restoration from the original negative was supervised and approved by Dehlavi and cinematographer Nic Knowland.<br/><br/><strong>INDICATOR LIMITED EDITION BLU-RAY SPECIAL FEATURES:</strong> </div> <div> <ul> <li>New 2K restoration by Powerhouse Films from the original negative, supervised and approved by director Jamil Dehlavi and cinematographer Nic Knowland</li> <li> <div>Original stereo audio</div> </li> <li> <div>Alternative original mono mix</div>\n\nI have tried specifying the encoding but still get the weird characters. For the 50 + products on this website only a few have this problem.\n\nIs there a problem with how I am scraping or possibly an easy way to clean this up.\n\nThanks"
