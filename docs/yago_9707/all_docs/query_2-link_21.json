        "text": "*Edward G. Brown, a professor of Arabic and oriental studies at the University of Cambridge, said a few words on the Master of Martyrs Imam Hussain سيد الشهداء الإمام الحسين عليه السلام , a reminder of the blood-stained field of Karbala, where the grandson of the Apostle of Almighty Allah fell at length, tortured by thirst and surrounded by the bodies of his murdered kinsmen, has been at any time since then sufficient to evoke, even in the most lukewarm and heedless, the deepest emotions, the most frantic grief, and an exaltation of spirit before which pain, danger and death shrink to unconsidered trifles,” reads page 227 of his book A Literary History of Persia.\n\n72 of Imam’s kinsmen accompanied him, and all were slain in the land of Karbala to achieve righteousness , by the way he not only gave himself up but everything possible in the way of God, including his six month old baby Ali Al Asghar, and with unyielding steadfastness.\n\n*Thomas Carlyle (Scottish historian and essayist) explains: “The best lesson which we get from the tragedy of Karbala is that Hussain and his companions were rigid believers in God. They illustrated that the numerical superiority does not count when it comes to the truth and the falsehood. The victory of Hussein, despite his minority, marvels me!”\n\n*Charles Dickens (English novelist) writes: “If Hussain had fought to quench his worldly desires…then I do not understand why his sister, wife, and children accompanied him. It stands to reason therefore, that he sacrificed purely for Islam.”\n\nYoung and old, women, men, children and infants… inseparable despite the hunger, thirst, heat, torture, and death they were subject to…still unyielding , and their hearts and souls aflame with righteousness chose death rather than evil and weakness. Such are the principles that feed and nurture the hearts of the Muslims who over the past 1400 years have been reviving the epic of Karbala.\n\n*The Poet Rabindranath Tagore writes: Hussein’s sacrifice indicates spiritual liberation. In order to keep alive justice and truth, instead of an army or weapons, success can be achieved by sacrificing lives, exactly what Imam Hussein (A.S.) did.\n\n*Dr. K. Sheldrake, on his part writes: “Of that gallant band, male and female knew that the enemy forces around were implacable, and were not only ready to fight, but to kill. Denied even water for the children, they remained parched under the burning sun and scorching sands, yet not one faltered for a moment. Hussein marched with his little company, not to glory, not to power of wealth, but to a supreme sacrifice, and every member bravely faced the greatest odds without flinching.”\n\n*Dr. Radha Krishnan, Indian Scholar say “Though Imam Hussein gave his life years ago, but his indestructible soul rules the hearts of people even today.”\n\n*Mahatma Gandhi (Indian political and spiritual leader) writes: “I learned from Hussein how to achieve victory while being oppressed.” He adds “My faith is that the progress of Islam does not depend on the use of sword by its believers, but the result of the supreme sacrifice of Hussein, the great saint.”\n\n*Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Indian Scholar describes the altruism of this great personality saying “Imam Hussein’s (A.S.) sacrifice is for all groups and communities, an example of the path of righteousness.”\n\n*Dr. Rajendra Prasad writes “The sacrifice of Imam Hussain (A) is not limited to one country, or nation, but it is the hereditary state of the brotherhood of all mankind.”\n\n*Sarojini Naidu, a great poet writes, “I congratulate Muslims that from among them, Hussein (A), a great human being was born, who is revered and honoured totally by all communities”\n\n*Edward Gibbon (1737-1794), considered as the greatest British historian of his time, in The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire writes “In a distant age and climate the tragic scene of the death of Hussein will awaken the sympathy of the coldest reader.”\n\n*Antoine Bara, Lebanese Writer in his book Husayn in Christian Ideology writes: “No battle in the modern and past history of mankind has earned more sympathy and admiration as well as provided more lessons than the martyrdom of Hussein in the battle of Karbala.”\n\n*Ignaz Goldziher (1850-1921), a Hungarian scholar writes “Karbala symbolizes the true face of struggle against injustice – non-violent resistance. Not taking life but sacrificing your life for Islam.”\n\n*Mohammed Iqbal, the Great Poet and Philosopher of Pakistan says: “Imam Hussein uprooted despotism forever till the Day of Resurrection. He watered the dry garden of freedom with the surging wave of his blood, and indeed he awakened the sleeping Muslim nation.\n\nIf Imam Hussein had aimed at acquiring a worldly empire, he would not have traveled the way he did (from Medina to Karbala). Hussein weltered in blood and dust for the sake of truth. Verily he, therefore, became the bed-rock (foundation) of the Muslim creed.”\n\nWritten by Mouood"
