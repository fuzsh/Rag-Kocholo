Jinnah, Jamil Dehlavi, 1998

An epic film about the life of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the man who founded Pakistan in the wake of Great Britain’s relinquishment of control over India.

After his death in 1948, Mohammad Ali Jinnah (Christopher Lee) awaits final judgement in the afterlife and must tell the story of his life before celestial bureaucrats decide his fate. His story covers the intense political strife and bloody events that led to the formation of Pakistan.

Attracting much controversy during production, but released to great acclaim, Jamil Dehlavi’s Jinnah is an intelligent and moving piece of cinema, with a performance by Sir Christopher Lee that he personally believed to be the finest of his career.
