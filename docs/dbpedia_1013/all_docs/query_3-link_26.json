        "text": "Introduction\n\nIf you've recently purchased a new TV and the picture doesn't quite fit the screen, or you've noticed that your current TV's picture is either too small or too large for the screen, you'll need to adjust the picture to fit the screen. In this article, we'll show you how to adjust your TV picture to fit the screen.\n\nPicture Size Issues\n\nTo calibrate a TV, check its picture size and understand aspect ratio mismatch issues.\n\nBlack bars on the screen sides may occur when the input device sends a picture recorded in a standard 4:3 aspect ratio. Stretching this image will result in a wider-looking image with parts of the top and bottom cut off.\n\nBlack bars on the top and bottom may appear when the input device sends wider programming than the widescreen format, resulting in a picture that is wider than the TV screen. Stretching this image will cut off parts of the left and right sides of the screen.\n\nBlack bars on all sides commonly occur when watching videos from a cable TV provider. This issue is a combination of the above problems and happens when a standard definition video is broadcasted in a wider-than-wide definition format, causing black borders around the screen.\n\nUnfortunately, a windowbox picture fitting issue will not adjust to fit the entire screen, which is a problem with how a particular channel transmits its content to your input device.\n\nAlso read: TV Screen Looks Darker Than Usual? Here Are Some Simple Solutions\n\nCheck Your TV's Aspect Ratio\n\nBefore you start adjusting the picture, it's important to check your TV's aspect ratio. The aspect ratio is the relationship between the width and height of the screen. Most modern TVs have a 16:9 aspect ratio, while some older models have a 4:3 aspect ratio.\n\nIf your TV's aspect ratio is different from the aspect ratio of the content you're watching, you may see black bars on the top and bottom or sides of the screen. To avoid this, you'll need to adjust the picture to fit the screen.\n\nAdjust the Picture Size\n\nMost modern TVs have an option in the settings to adjust the picture size. This option may be called \"Picture Size,\" \"Aspect Ratio,\" \"Screen Fit,\" or something similar. To find this option, go to your TV's settings menu and look for the display or picture options.\n\nOnce you've found the option, select it and choose the option that best fits your screen. You may need to try a few different options until you find the one that works best for you. Some TVs also have a \"Zoom\" option that allows you to zoom in or out on the picture.\n\nRead more: TV Screen Sizes: What Are The Numbers For & Why Should I Care\n\nAdjust the Picture Position\n\nIf the picture still doesn't fit the screen after adjusting the picture size, you may need to adjust the picture position. Most modern TVs have an option in the settings to adjust the picture position. This option may be called \"Position,\" \"Screen Position,\" or something similar.\n\nTo find this option, go to your TV's settings menu and look for the display or picture options. Once you've found the option, select it and use the arrow keys on your remote to adjust the picture position until it fits the screen.\n\nCheck Your Source\n\nIf you've tried adjusting the picture size and position and the picture still doesn't fit the screen, your source may be the problem. Some sources, such as older video game consoles, may not output a signal that is compatible with your TV's aspect ratio.\n\nIn this case, you may need to adjust the settings on your source device or use a different source device that outputs a signal that is compatible with your TV's aspect ratio.\n\nRead more: How To Clean Your TV Screen In 6 Easy Steps\n\nFAQs\n\nQ: What are the common aspect ratio mismatch issues?\n\nA: The common aspect ratio mismatch issues are black bars on the screen sides, black bars on the top and bottom, and black bars on all sides.\n\nQ: Is it possible to fix windowbox issues?\n\nA: Unfortunately, it is not possible to fix windowbox issues. This problem occurs when a particular channel transmits its content to your input device in a way that does not adjust the picture to fit the entire screen.\n\nUpgrade your home entertainment system with TCL TVs and experience picture-perfect quality like never before.
