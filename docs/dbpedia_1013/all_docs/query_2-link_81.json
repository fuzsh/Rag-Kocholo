        "text": "A Gentleman In Moscow. Streaming Exclusively on Paramount+ From Friday, 29 March 2024.\n\nParamount+ today released a teaser from its upcoming limited series A Gentleman In Moscow, and announced that the original series will premiere on Friday, 29 March exclusively on Paramount+.\n\nAn adaptation of Amor Towles’ internationally best-selling novel, A Gentleman In Moscow follows Count Alexander Rostov, played by Emmy Award winning actor Ewan McGregor (Star Wars franchise, Halston, Trainspotting), who, in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, finds that his gilded past places him on the wrong side of history. Spared immediate execution, he is banished by a Soviet tribunal to an attic room in the opulent Hotel Metropol, threatened with death if he ever sets foot outside again. As the years pass and some of the most tumultuous decades in Russian history unfold outside the hotel’s doors, Rostov’s reduced circumstances provide him entry into a much larger world of emotional discovery. As he builds a new life within the walls of the hotel, he discovers the true value of friendship, family and love.\n\nAlongside McGregor, the series stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Ahsoka, Kate, Birds of Prey) as glamorous, self-made film actress Anna Urbanova; Alexa Goodall (The Devil’s Hour, Lockwood and Co) as the Count’s unlikely young friend Nina; Johnny Harris (Without Sin, This is England ’86) as conflicted secret police officer Osip; and Fehinti Balogun (Dune, I May Destroy You) as Mishka, the Count’s best friend from university. Additional cast includes Leah Harvey (Foundation), Paul Ready (Motherland, The Terror), John Heffernan (Becoming Elizabeth, The Pursuit of Love), Lyès Salem (Coupez, Abou Leila), Björn Hlynur Haraldsson (Lamb, The Witcher), Dee Ahluwalia (Consent, Sex Education) and Anastasia Hille (I Hate Suzie Too).\n\nA Gentleman In Moscow is produced by Lionsgate Television in association with Paramount. Ben Vanstone serves as Showrunner on the series, which is the first production to come through Lionsgate’s first look deal with Tom Harper’s company Popcorn Storm Pictures. Harper (War and Peace, Peaky Blinders) will also executive produce alongside Vanstone, McGregor, Sharon Hughff, (Three Pines), Pancho Mansfield (Queen of the South), Moonriver TV’s Xavier Marchand (Nautilus, Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris) and the novel’s writer, New York Times best-selling author Amor Towles. BAFTA® award winning director, and Emmy nominee Sam Miller (Surface, I May Destroy You, Luther) serves as director to select episodes and executive producer. Sarah O’Gorman (The Witcher, The Last Kingdom) also serves as director.\n\nWatch the official teaser below.\n\nA Gentleman In Moscow will soon join a host of the world’s best entertainment currently streaming on Paramount+, including Halo Season Two, Sexy Beast, The Gilded Age, Lawmen: Bass Reeves, NCIS: Sydney, Frasier, Fellow Travelers, Special Ops: Lioness, The Inspired Unemployed (Impractical) Jokers, Star Trek: Strange New Worlds Season Two and Paper Dolls with The Family Stallone Season Two, Jersey Shore: Family Vacation Season Seven, NCIS Season 21, Ferrari and Evil Season Four soon.\n\nYou can stream 20,000 hours of unique stories, iconic stars, live sport and a mountain of entertainment on Paramount+ from $9.99 per month for a monthly subscription or $89.99 for an annual subscription.\n\nJoin the conversation:\n\nwww.ParamountPlus.com.au\n\n@ParamountPlusAU"
