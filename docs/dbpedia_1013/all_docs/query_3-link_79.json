        "text": "There are two reasons why we might want to resize photographs: to print them or to display them online. Small photos (i.e. postcard size) will need to be printed differently to big photos (i.e. poster size), and the quality of the paper also impacts what resize settings we use. The same is true for online use of digital photos, where height and width are restricted by the size and shape of the viewing device and the quality of said image impacts how fast or slow it loads on computers and webpages.\n\nBoth print and online photo use are almost identical in every way, but each have their own specific requirements and limitations. Both print and online images are made up of height and width, and contain many points of color to represent what’s in the photograph. For print, these points of color are called ‘dots’, in digital photos they’re referred to as ‘pixels’. A typical dot consists of four colors: Cyan; Magenta; Yellow and Key (Black), aka CMYK. Whereas each digital pixel is made from combining three colors: Red; Green and Blue (RGB). These dots and pixels combine together to create a photograph.\n\nHowever, neither dots nor pixels have a standardized size. So that means the resolution of an image (how many dots/pixels that make up a photo) is determined by how many dots/pixels are along its width and its height, like this: 1800 × 1200. The more you have, the greater the image detail.\n\nIf you need a photo printer, check out Amazon's amazing bargains:\n\nWhat is a standard photo size? Standard photo print sizes are measured in inches or millimeters because they’re physical, tangible items. Photo print sizes also have a print resolution (measured in Dots Per Inch) that is determined by the absorption of the paper a photo is printed on. If paper is coarse and the ink bleeds easily, then a lower resolution of, say, 100 DPI may be all that’s required because the bleeding limits how fine the details are rendered. However, if paper is smoother and doesn’t allow the ink to run as much, then a finer resolution can be used. For example, a broadsheet newspaper might be printed at 100 DPI, whereas on glossy photo paper or in glossy magazines it could be increased to 300 DPI to give higher definition.\n\nStandard picture sizes are determined by historical print reproduction and are generally regarded as being measured in inches. Normal picture sizes are as follows: 8 × 10, 7 × 5, 6 × 4, and 2 × 3. Square crop photos can also be used, for example, the smallest usually being 1 × 1.\n\nBut what size is a standard photo? Photo sizes are measured in inches or millimeters since they are physical and tangible items. The print resolution of a photo size, measured in Dots Per Inch (DPI), is determined by the paper's absorption. If the paper is coarse, then printer ink easily bleeds through the medium. For this, a lower resolution of 100 DPI may suffice for accuracy. The bleeding limits the details that can be rendered finely. However, if the paper is smoother and doesn't allow the ink to run as much, a finer resolution can be used. A broadsheet newspaper, for instance, may be printed at 100 DPI, while a higher definition of 300 DPI can be used on glossy photo paper or in glossy magazines because the paper can produce better clarity in images. Standard picture sizes are determined by historical print reproduction and are usually measured in inches due to their existence before the metric system was introduced. The typical picture sizes are 8 × 10, 7 × 5, 6 × 4, and 2 × 3. Additionally, square crop photos can be used, with the smallest usually being 1 × 1. Below are the most common photo sizes in inches, plus different photo sizes examples.\n\nHave you ever wondered how digital image sizes are measured for the web? Well, they are measured in pixels because different viewing devices like laptops, tablets, and smartphones have screens with individual pixels that display red, green, and blue lights to create each pixel on the screen. The resolution is measured in pixels per inch (PPI) and determines the density of pixels. Just like in printing, the higher the PPI, the finer the detail in image reproduction.\n\nResizing photos can be tricky because the size of pixels on a screen varies, meaning that a 50” screen could have the same resolution as a 12” screen. Digital photo resolution is measured at a standard rate regardless of the device. Therefore, when preparing photos for online use, the only factors that change are the length and width of the image and the amount of compression used to make the file small enough to load quickly on slow internet speeds. Ultimately, the file size of a photo is more important than its resolution because large files take longer to load, which can negatively impact a website's search engine optimization and cause it to rank lower in search engine results.\n\nWhen it comes to sharing photographs online, there aren't any restrictions on their size or shape, except for social media platform’s size restrictions. However, many websites use standard aspect ratio crops to fit images into their layout. For instance, 16:9 picture dimensions are commonly used, which results in a letterbox shape on the screen, regardless of the image resolution. Instagram, for example, uses 1:1 crops to create square photos, and currently, the resolution they use is 1080 × 1080 pixels. Although, they now also allow for landscape and portrait orientations of rectangle shaped photos."
