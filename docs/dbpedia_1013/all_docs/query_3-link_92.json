        "text": "Modern pages and web parts are designed to be fully responsive across devices, meaning that images used in web parts will scale differently depending on where they are shown, which layout is used, and the device on which they are being viewed. For example, modern pages are designed to look great on mobile devices, and automatic image scaling helps create that attractive experience.\n\nAspect ratio\n\nAn aspect ratio is the relationship between width and height of images. It is usually expressed as two numbers, such as 3:2, 4:3 or 16:9. The width is always the first number. As an example, a ratio of 16:9 could be 1600 pixels in width by 900 pixels in height. Or, it could be 1920 x 1080, 1280 x 720, or any other width/height combinations that can be calculated to equal 16:9. You can find aspect ratio calculators online and in some photo editing tools to help you determine the aspect ratios of your images.\n\nIn most cases, images in modern web parts work best across layouts and devices when they have an aspect ratio of either 16:9 or 4:3, depending on the layout.\n\nColumn layouts\n\nA page can be laid out with sections that include different column types and layouts, such as full-width columns, one column, two columns, three columns, one-third left and one-third right columns. A general rule for images expected to fill the width of a column is that they be at least as wide as the column in which they are placed. For example, an image in an image web part in one column should be at least 1204 pixels wide. Following are the width guidelines for each of the column layouts:\n\nBecause of the responsive nature of pages, images in full-width columns will always display at full-width of your screen with an automatic height based on screen size.\n\nThe height of images placed within other column layouts will depend on your aspect ratio. Here are height/width guidelines for 16:9 and 4:3 aspect ratios (rounded up/down to the nearest pixel). This is helpful to keep your images at a width and height that scales appropriately for mobile devices, for example.\n\nASPECT RATIO\n\nLAYOUT\n\n16 x 9\n\nWidth x Height in pixels\n\n4 x 3\n\nWidth x Height in pixels\n\nWeb part layouts\n\nThe layouts in the web parts you use will also affect how your images scale. The following examples show different web parts and their layouts within one column, and the aspect ratios that are used in each.\n\nConsider this image which has an original aspect ratio of 16:9:\n\nFollowing are examples of this image shown in a one column page layout, in different web parts and layouts.\n\nTips:\n\nWhen you add an image to a page title area or hero web part, it is also best to set the focal point in the area of the image that you want to always display. To learn more about setting a focal point for these two scenarios, see Change the focal point of an image in the Hero web part and Customize the title area in a page.\n\nSite header image recommendations\n\nIn addition to pages, you may want to add custom logos or images in an extended layout. Here are size recommendations for those elements.\n\nElement\n\nDescription\n\nRecommendation\n\nWidth x Height in pixels"
