        "text": "IMPORTANT: This article applies only to specific products and/or operating systems. Check Applicable Products and Categories for details.\n\nHow to troubleshoot TV screen issues\n\nPicture and display issues on your TV screen may be caused by many different factors, including (but not limited to) physical damage, a poor network or cable connection, changes to the picture settings, and outdated software. If you notice any unusual symptoms on your TV screen, the troubleshooting steps in this article may be able to help.\n\nClick or tap a topic below to jump to the relevant section:\n\nCommon TV screen issues\n\nBefore you start\n\nGeneral troubleshooting guide\n\nHow to adjust the TV settings\n\nContact us\n\nExample images of different screen issues\n\nCommon TV screen issues\n\nClick or tap the blue underlined text to see an example image.\n\nBlack screen:\n\nThe screen turns completely black, even when the sound can still be heard.\n\nHorizontal/vertical lines or bands:\n\nThere are noticeable lines or bands in different colours (e.g. red, green, blue, white, black, etc.).\n\nIf there is a clear point of impact, these lines could indicate physical damage.\n\nMosaic or blocky images:\n\nThe picture appears scrambled or garbled.\n\nStains or tinted areas:\n\nThere is a discoloured patch or stain of color on the screen (green, purple, red, etc.).\n\nThis discolouration could be a result of image retention (screen burn-in).\n\nUnclear or unfocused picture:\n\nThe picture appears blurry, hazy, or dull.\n\nDouble or \"ghost\" images:\n\nThe TV image looks like there's a mirror image that's slightly out of sync.\n\nCloudy or patchy images:\n\nThe TV picture looks patchy or blotchy when watching very dark scenes.\n\nA screen that's too dark or too bright:\n\nThe contrast of the screen is too low or high.\n\nAbnormal colours:\n\nThe TV image colours seem overexposed or inverted (e.g. the brightest colours turn dark).\n\nThe display turns grey while watching content.\n\n→ Return to the top of the page\n\nBefore you start\n\nCheck your TV for physical damage\n\nThese troubleshooting steps apply to most, if not all, picture issues, unless you're dealing with physical damage.\n\nIf your TV shows physical damage, please book a repair at your nearest Sony Authorized Service Centre.\n\nYour TV may be damaged if the picture issue is always present on the screen regardless of what you're watching.\n\nPhysical damage lines are usually both horizontal and vertical with a visible point of impact.\n\nConfirm if the picture issue is limited to a specific situation (e.g. a particular app or connected device)\n\nIf yes, the program, game, or video content you are watching may be broadcast or recorded in an aspect ratio that appears stretched or distorted.\n\nFor example, some movie content is recorded in a 21:9 cinema format that will display with black bars above and below the picture when viewed on a widescreen (16:9) TV.\n\nIn this case, the issue is likely with the app or device rather than the TV itself. Check the settings of the app or device to confirm:\n\nTry to switch the TV input.\n\nOr, check the resolution and refresh rate settings on the connected device (e.g., computer, gaming console) and ensure they match what your TV supports.\n\nIf needed, change the current settings to the recommended ones for your TV.\n\nAre you dealing with a pixel-related issue?\n\nThere may be a small number of pixels that do not change color, which is a normal occurrence for all LCD/OLED displays.\n\nThese pixels stay on the screen but are noticeable only while an all-white or all-black picture is shown, and should not be noticeable during normal viewing conditions.\n\nSome pixels can appear dead or defective if there is debris on the screen.\n\nSometimes these dead or defective pixels will correct themselves over time. However, if they don't, try cleaning the screen thoroughly with a soft dry cloth to confirm whether or not the issue is due to a dead or defective pixel, or if it's due to dirt or debris on the screen.\n\nRefer to this FAQ for more details: Pixels on the LCD or OLED screen appear dark or as bright red, green or blue dots.\n\n→ Return to the top of the page\n\nGeneral troubleshooting guide\n\nClick or tap the section(s) related to your TV screen issue.\n\nRestart (reset) the TV\n\nA TV reset can help resolve a number of screen issues.\n\nTo perform a power cycle of your TV:\n\nTurn the TV off.\n\nUnplug the power cord (mains lead) from the electrical outlet.\n\nLeave the TV unplugged for 30 seconds.\n\nPlug the power cord back into the outlet.\n\nTurn the TV on.\n\nRefer to this FAQ for more details: How to reset your Sony TV.\n\nNotes:\n\nIf the issue persists, try plugging the power cord into a different electrical outlet.\n\nIf the TV is connected to an external hard drive (HDD), remove the HDD and try the reset procedure again.\n\nThese steps may also apply to devices connected to the TV.\n\nAdjust the location of the TV\n\nIt's important to find a good location to set up your TV as certain factors such as excessive sunlight and electromagnetic waves can affect your TV's functionality.\n\nFollow these tips to help find the right spot for your TV and avoid the risk of picture issues.\n\nKeep your TV away from direct sunlight\n\nToo much sun exposure can cause permanent damage to the TV screen, including discoloration, fading, and image retention or burn-in.\n\nKeep other electronics away from the TV\n\nThe majority of electronic devices emit electromagnetic waves, which can interfere with the HDMI signal between your TV and connected external device such as a gaming console or set-top box.\n\nA faulty HDMI signal can lead to issues such as black screen and/or No Signal error message to appear on the TV.\n\nBe mindful of household appliances such as laptop computers, microwaves, and Wi-Fi routers. Move them further away from the TV if necessary.\n\nCheck the cable connection\n\nYou may experience TV screen issues if the cable you're using to connect the TV to an external device (such as a gaming console or set-top box) is damaged or defective, or if the cable isn't properly secured to either the TV or connected device. Sometimes, even using the wrong HDMI port or TV input can create a picture error.\n\nThe following steps can help you troubleshoot issues with your HDMI cable connection(s).\n\nMake sure the cable connecting your TV to the device is in good condition.\n\nReplace the cable if it's outdated or shows signs of damage (e.g., exposed wires, bent connectors).\n\nCheck that the cable isn't loose and is securely plugged into both the TV and device.\n\nCleaning around or near the cable can sometimes dislodge it or make it loose.\n\nRe-attach the cable to both the TV and device to ensure a secure connection.\n\nUse high-quality HDMI cables with good shielding.\n\nThis will help protect against HDMI signal interference caused by electromagnetic wave emissions.\n\nIf you are using an HDMI/MHL connection and the screen turns black or the image doesn't display correctly, try the following:\n\nDisconnect the HDMI/MHL cable and connect it again.\n\nUnplug the power cord (mains lead) of the connected device and plug it back in, or reboot the device.\n\nEnsure your TV is set to the correct video (HDMI) input to receive the signal from the device connected to the HDMI port.\n\nIf there is no input signal, try connecting the cable to another HDMI port on the TV.\n\nVerify that the HDMI-connected device is outputting a signal in a format compatible with the TV.\n\nCheck your product manual for more details on compatible signal formats.\n\nIf the issue persists, try using a different connection method if possible (e.g., Bluetooth pairing).\n\nCheck the Wi-Fi connection\n\nCertain screen and picture issues may be caused by a faulty Wi-Fi connection. The options below may help resolve the issue:\n\nRestart your router or check the service provider's website(s) for more information.\n\nIf you're dealing with a poor Wi-Fi signal, you may need to reset or relocate the router, modem, or TV.\n\nCheck the following links for more details:\n\nFor Android TVs\n\nFor non-Android TVs\n\nTo use Google Assistant, your TV must be connected to a Wi-Fi network.\n\nIf you press the Microphone or Google Assistant button on the remote control without a network connection, a grey screen will appear.\n\nThe grey screen will disappear automatically after a few seconds.\n\nRefer to this FAQ for more details: How to & Troubleshooting for your TV internet connection.\n\nPerform a picture test on your TV\n\nPress the HELP button on the remote control.\n\nYou can also open the Help screen via the HOME menu. Depending on your TV model:\n\nSelect HOME → (Apps) → Help.\n\nSelect HOME → (Help).\n\nUnder Top support solutions, select Problem diagnosis.\n\nIf this option isn't available, proceed to Step 3.\n\nSelect Picture/Sound symptoms.\n\nSelect Start.\n\nYour TV will play a series of images and sounds to test the display and audio.\n\nTo cancel the test, press the BACK button on the remote.\n\nThe message Picture and sound test is complete! will appear on your TV screen at the end of the test.\n\nSelect Finish to end the test.\n\nTo repeat the test, select Restart the test or Start again.\n\nCheck the Screen mirroring function\n\nA blurry picture on the TV screen could be caused by enabling Screen mirroring. Keep the following in mind when using this feature:\n\nThe image may not display correctly depending on the output resolution of the screen mirroring device and the resolution of the played file.\n\nFor example, content played in a low resolution (480p or 720p) may not show clearly on the screen.\n\nTry playing high-resolution content (1080p) to see if this resolves the issue.\n\nTry to connect the BRAVIA TV and screen mirroring device using a Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) HDMI cable.\n\nNote: Some models do not support an MHL connection. Check the TV manual for compatibility and specifications.\n\nRefer to this FAQ for more details: Why does a blurry picture appear during Screen mirroring?\n\nPrevent image retention (OLED TVs)\n\nImage retention occurs when an image remains on the screen for long and extensive periods, or if the same image is displayed repeatedly over and over again. This causes a temporary or permanent image to linger on the screen even after you've changed the channel or turned the programme off, almost like a residual shadow. However, there are steps you can take to prevent image retention on your TV.\n\nPerform a panel calibration\n\nPress the Quick Settings ( or ) button on the remote control.\n\nSelect Settings → System → Retail mode settings → Picture reset mode → On.\n\nTurn the TV off and then back on using the AC power cord.\n\nBefore running the panel calibration, a dialogue will appear on the screen. Start the panel calibration from this dialogue.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe TV automatically undergoes a panel calibration a few hours after it's been turned off with the remote control.\n\nIf Picture reset mode is On, and you disconnect and reconnect the power cord and then turn the TV on, it will go into Standby mode for approximately 10 minutes to perform the panel calibration.\n\nThe TV will restart once the calibration is complete.\n\nAfter this procedure, you can set Picture reset mode back to Off.\n\nA panel calibration can also enhance the TV screen when watching dark scenes.\n\nLeave the TV off for one night\n\nWe recommend performing these steps after each use of the TV:\n\nPress the Power button on the remote control to turn the TV off.\n\nLeave it off for one night (at least 6 hours).\n\nAvoid using (static) images that are susceptible to image retention\n\nThis includes:\n\nPhotos\n\nOn-screen menus\n\nProgram guides\n\nStatic images with clocks, logos, or bright colours (including white)\n\nTurn the on-screen display (OSD) off\n\nTurning the on-screen display off can help reduce the appearance of static images on the TV screen.\n\nFollow the steps below to disable this feature:\n\nPress the DISPLAY button on the supplied remote control.\n\nSet the OSD to off.\n\nRefer to this FAQ for more details: What is image retention on OLED TVs and how to avoid it.\n\nUpdate the TV software\n\nIt's important to update your TV software on a regular basis as it includes key features, applications, bug fixes, and improvements necessary to keep your TV running smoothly. It can also help resolve a variety of picture and screen issues you may be experiencing.\n\nTo enable automatic software updates for your TV:\n\nConnect the TV to the Internet.\n\nSet Automatically check for update or Automatic Software Download to On.\n\nWith this feature enabled, updates will automatically download when your TV is in Standby mode.\n\nRefer to this FAQ for more details: How to perform a software update on your TV.\n\n→ Return to the top of the page\n\nHow to adjust the TV settings\n\nIt's possible the picture settings of your TV are not ideal for the content you're watching (e.g., contrast and brightness issues). If you've changed the picture settings before, we recommend resetting them to default values. Otherwise, you can try optimising the settings for the content you're watching.\n\nClick or tap the sections below to adjust the different picture settings on your TV:\n\nPicture reset mode\n\nIf the Picture reset mode of your OLED TV is set to On during a power reset, the TV screen will go completely black. This happens because the TV enters Standby mode when performing a panel calibration.
