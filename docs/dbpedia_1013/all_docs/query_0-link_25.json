To connect with TAPS, visit their website here.\n\nAGAINST COLOMBIA\n\nSaturday’s match marks the United States’ 21st meeting with Colombia, against whom they hold a 3-13-5 record against all-time. Most recently, the two sides played to a 0-0 draw on Jan. 28, 2023, in Carson, Calif.\n\nThe USMNT is looking to earn its first victory against Colombia since March 2005, a 3-0 win in Fullerton, Calif. One of the USMNT’s most memorable World Cup victories came against Colombia in Southern California during the 1994 World Cup, a 2-1 win at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena featuring a goal from former U.S. Soccer Sporting Director Earnie Stewart.\n\nThe USA and Colombia faced off twice in 2016 during the Copa América Centenario, the only other time the tournament took place in the United States. The U.S. fell 2-0 in the group stage in Santa Clara, Calif., followed by a narrow 1-0 defeat in the Third-Place Match in Glendale, Ariz.\n\nAT COMMANDERS FIELD\n\nSaturday’s match is set to be among the top five most-attended MNT games in the DMV area, with 50,000+ fans expected at kickoff against Colombia. The record was set in 2012, when 67,619 fans watch the U.S. take on Brazil, a 4-1 defeat for the home side.\n\nCommanders Field will host the USMNT for the first time since 2012, a 4-1 defeat at the hands of five-time World Cup champion Brazil in front of 67,619 fans. The U.S. Women’s National Team won a quarterfinal match there en route to its historic 1999 FIFA Women’s World Cup championship, a 3-2 triumph against Germany with President Bill Clinton in attendance.\n\nThe USMNT has played many important matches in the D.C. area, compiling a 16-5-6 record all-time. RFK Stadium was the USMNT’s most-frequent home venue, putting up a 15-3-6 record in 24 matches, including a 4-1-2 record in World Cup qualifying.\n\nThe USA last played in the DMV at Audi Field, the home of D.C. United, in October 2019, a 7-0 Concacaf Nations League victory against Cuba.\n\nROSTER NOTES\n\nThe roster will have an average age of 25 years, 210 days as of matchday against Colombia on Saturday.\n\nThe squad has an average of 25 caps, and 15 in official competition.\n\nThe 27 players represent clubs in 10 different countries: England (8), Italy (5), USA (4), Netherlands (3), Germany (2), Spain (2), Belgium (1), France (1), Scotland (1), Wales (1).\n\nChristian Pulisic (66) is the leading cap-winner, followed by Tim Ream (56), Weston McKennie (51), Antonee Robinson (41), Matt Turner (39), Tyler Adams (38), Tim Weah (37) and Yunus Musah (35).\n\nThe 27-player training camp roster is comprised of 18 players who were on the 2022 FIFA World Cup roster.\n\nA total of 21 players have appeared on at least one of the three Concacaf Nations League-winning rosters since 2021. Seven players have won all three titles - Brenden Aaronson, Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah, Christian Pulisic, Gio Reyna, Antonee Robinson and Tim Weah – and an additional 11 have lifted the trophy twice.\n\nAdditionally, 2022 FIFA World Cup veterans Cameron Carter-Vickers, Luca de la Torre and Sean Johnson each make their first camp appearances of 2024.\n\nShould they both appear in one of the June friendlies, Malik and Timmy Tillman would become the ninth set of brothers to play for the USMNT in the same match, and the first since Ken and Steve Snow against Costa Rica on June 14, 1988. The Tillman became the 10th set of brothers to appear for the USMNT upon Timmy’s debut this past January against Slovenia.\n\nUSA-COLOMBIA NOTES\n\nThe USMNT holds a 3-13-5 record against Colombia all-time.\n\nThe two teams last met in January 2023, a 0-0 draw at the conclusion of the USMNT’s annual January camp.\n\nJune 22 marks the 30th anniversary of one of the USMNT’s most memorable upsets at a FIFA World Cup. On June 22, 1994, the Americans secured a 2-1 triumph over Colombia, considered one of the competition's favorites. Colombia defender Andres Escobar scored a 35th-minute own goal, and Earnie Stewart doubled the lead in the 52nd minute at the Rose Bowl. Halftime substitute Adolfo Valencia spoiled goalkeeper Tony Meola's shutout bid in the 90th minute.\n\nThe USMNT has met Colombia four times in Copa América play, across the 1995, 2007, and 2016 iterations of the tournament. Two of those matchups came in the tournament’s third-place game. In 1995, the U.S. got a goal from Joe-Max Moore, but fell 4-1 in Maldonado, Uruguay. In 2016, it was a 1-0 defeat to Los Cafeteros in Glendale, Ariz.\n\nMidfielder Weston McKennie registered the fastest hat trick in USMNT history during his last visit to the Washington, D.C. area, tallying three goals inside the first 13 minutes of a 7-0 win against Cuba on Oct. 11, 2019 at Audi Field. Christian Pulisic and Josh Sargent also scored in that match.\n\nFive players on the roster have previous experience against Colombia: Christian Pulisic (2; June 2 and June 25, 2016); Josh Sargent, Antonee Robinson and Tim Weah (Oct. 11, 2018), and Sean Johnson (Jan. 28, 2023).\n\nTim Weah registered his first career assist in the 2018 match against Colombia, playing provider on Bobby Wood’s 53rd minute goal.\n\nCOLOMBIA OF LATE\n\nLos Cafeteros are currently red-hot, riding a 21-match unbeaten streak going back more than two years which includes a 1-0 win against No. 8-ranked Spain in the last March window. Since playing to a 0-0 draw at Ecuador in a World Cup qualifying match on Oct. 17, Los Cafeteros have won six consecutive contests.\n\nColombia currently sits in third place in South American qualifying for the 2026 World Cup with an unblemished 3-0-3 record. This summer, Colombia will aim to build on a third-place finish at the last Copa América and secure its second title after topping the podium on home soil in 2001.\n\nAT THE HELM\n\nNestor Lorenzo was named manager on June 2, 2022, replacing Reinaldo Rueda, who had been fired that April in the wake of Colombia failing to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\n\nSince taking over the coaching reins, Colombia is undefeated in 18 successive matches (13-0-5).\n\nAfter a playing career as a defender for Argentinos Juniors, San Lorenzo, Banfield, Ferro Carril Oeste and Boca Juniors, Bari, and Swindon Town (as well as earning 13 caps for the Argentine National Team), Lorenzo turned to coaching.\n\nThe 58-year-old was previously an assistant coach for the Argentina Under-20 and full National Teams, and additionally with Leganes (Spain), Toluca and Tigres UANL (Mexico), before getting an opportunity to be the head man with Melgar (Peru) from 2021-22.\n\nCOLOMBIA ROSTER BY POSITION (CLUB; CAPS/GOALS)\n\nGOALKEEPERS (3): Alvaro Montero (Millonarios; 8/0), Camilo Vargas (Atlas/MEX; 21/0), David Ospina (Al Nassr/RSA; 128/0)\n\nDEFENDERS (9): Carlos Cuesta (Genk/BEL; 13/0), Jhon Lucumí (Bologna/ITA; 18/0), Santiago Arias (Bahia/BRA; 56/0), Yerson Mosquera (Villareal/ESP; 3/0), Johan Mojica (CA Osasuna/ESP; 24/1), Daniel Munoz (Crystal Palace/ENG; 25/1), Yerry Mina (Cagliari/ITA; 43/7), Davinson Sanchez (Galatasaray S.K./TUR; 58/1), Deiver Machado (Lens/FRA; 9/0)\n\nMIDFIELDERS (10): Kevin Castano (Krasnodar/RUS; 7/0), Richard Ríos (Palmeiras/BRA; 5/0), Jorge Carrascal (Dynamo Moscow/RUS; 13/1), James Rodríguez (Sao Paulo/BRA; 98/27), Jhon Arias (Fluminense/BRA; 13/1), Jefferson Lerma (Crystal Palace/ENG; 41/1), Juan Fernando Quintero (Racing/ARG; 34/4), Yaser Asprilla (Watford/ENG; 4/2), Mateus Uribe (Al-Sadd/QAT; 53/6), Luis Sinisterra (A.F.C.
