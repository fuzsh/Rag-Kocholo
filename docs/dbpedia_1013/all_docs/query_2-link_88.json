        "text": "We don’t have to wonder if A Gentleman in Moscow will be cancelled. This Showtime series is based on a novel and has been promoted as a limited series. If the show is popular enough, could the network find a way to renew the series for a second season anyway? Stay tuned.\n\nA historical drama series, A Gentleman in Moscow stars Ewan McGregor, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Alexa Goodall, Johnny Harris, and Fehinti Balogun, with Leah Harvey, Paul Ready, John Heffernan, Lyès Salem, Björn Hlynur Haraldsson, Dee Ahluwalia, and Anastasia Hille. The story revolves around aristocrat Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov (McGregor), who finds that his gilded past has placed him on the wrong side of history in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution. Spared an immediate execution, he is banished by a Soviet tribunal to an attic room in the opulent Hotel Metropol. He is also threatened with death if he ever sets foot outside again. As the years pass and some of the most tumultuous decades in Russian history unfold outside the hotel’s doors, Rostov’s reduced circumstances provide him entry into a much larger world of emotional discovery. As he builds a new life within the walls of the hotel, he discovers the true value of friendship, family and love. Other characters include Anna Urbanova (Winstead), a glamorous, self-made film actress; the Count’s unlikely young friend Nina Kulikova (Goodall); conflicted secret police officer Osip Glebnikov (Harris); and Mikhail “Mishka” Mindich (Balogun), the Count’s best friend from university.\n\nThe ratings are typically the best indication of a show’s chances of staying on the air. The higher the ratings, the better the chances of survival. This chart will be updated as new ratings data becomes available.\n\nNote: If you’re not seeing the updated chart, please try reloading the page or view it here.\n\nNote: These are the final national ratings, including all live+same day viewing and DVR playback (through 3:00 AM). Early fast affiliate ratings (estimates) are indicated with an “*”. While these numbers don’t include further delayed or streaming viewing, they are a very good indicator of how a show is performing, especially when compared to others on the same channel. There can be other economic factors involved in a show’s fate, but typically the higher-rated series are renewed and the lower-rated ones are cancelled.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you like the A Gentleman in Moscow TV series on Showtime? Should the story have been extended for a second season?"
