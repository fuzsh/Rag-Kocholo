NICK SCHIFRIN: Slovenia is releasing Russian# sleeper agents Artem Dultsev and Anna Dultseva,## who posed as Argentineans.\n\nThe administration# says their part of today's deal was finally## secured in a phone call between President# Biden and Slovenian Prime Minister Robert## Golob on July 21, just hours before President# Biden withdrew from the presidential race.\n\nThe U.S. is releasing what a senior administration# official says are three Russian intelligence## officials, each convicted by U.S. courts for# cyber crimes, hacking or sanctions evasion.\n\nJAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. National Security Adviser: It# is difficult to send back a convicted criminal to## secure the release of an innocent American.\n\nAnd# yet, sometimes, the choice is between doing that## and consigning that person basically to live out# their days in prison in a hostile foreign country.\n\nNICK SCHIFRIN: A U.S. official tells PBS \"News# Hour\" the Central Intelligence Agency tried to## secure earlier versions of this deal, in January# 2023, the Slovenian sleeper agents for Whelan, in## March 2023, the Slovenian sleeper agents and two# other Russian agents for Whelan and Gershkovich.\n\nEach was rejected by Russian intelligence,## which each time demanded Krasikov.\n\nGermany's# willingness to send Krasikov began as an attempt## to try and release former opposition# leader Alexei Navalny.\n\nThat deal was## initially agreed to by President Biden and# Chancellor Olaf Scholz in early February.\n\nBut before Navalny's name could be formally# offered to Russia, Navalny died in a Russian## penal colony.\n\nU.S. officials say they negotiated# for months, including a letter from Biden to## Scholz, and Germany finally agreed to# release Krasikov in return for some of## Navalny's former allies in Russian detention,# including Lilia Chanysheva and Ksenia Fadeyeva.\n\nRussia is also releasing well-known# Russian human rights defender Oleg Orlov## and political prisoners Sasha# Skochilenko and Ilya Yashin,## jailed for criticizing the war in Ukraine,# all of whom get new lives in Germany.\n\nJOE BIDEN: They stood up for democracy# and human rights.\n\nTheir own leaders## threw them in prison.\n\nThe United States# helped secure their release as well.\n\nNICK SCHIFRIN: But not all Americans got out.# Army Staff Sergeant Gordon Black,.\n\nwho's been## sentenced to nearly four years in prison# for theft, will remain in Russian detention,## as will American teacher Marc Fogel, convicted# and sentenced to 14 years in prison in 2022.\n\nHis mother, Malphine, met with former# President Donald Trump in Butler,## Pennsylvania, the same day of his failed# assassination attempt.\n\nAs for those released,## Putin welcomed the Russian spies and their# families home.\n\nAnd the American families## felt relief.\n\nThey will soon see their# loved ones for the first time in years.\n\nAnd Miriam, Alsu Kurmasheva's younger# daughter, will celebrate her 13th birthday.\n\nJOE BIDEN: Now she gets to celebrate with# her mom.\n\nThat's what this is all about,## families able to be together again,# like they should have been all along.\n\nNICK SCHIFRIN: For the PBS# \"News Hour,\" I'm Nick Schifrin.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: Jon Finer is President# Biden's deputy national security adviser,## and I spoke with him about# the prisoner swap moments ago.\n\nJon Finer, welcome back to the \"News Hour.\"\n\nJON FINER, U.S.\n\nPrincipal Deputy National# Security Adviser: Thanks.\n\nGood to be here.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: All told, this was among the most# complex prisoner swaps.. War.\n\nThe deal was in the works for the last two# years, as I understand it, and ultimately came## together in the last two weeks.\n\nWhat were the# key inflection points?\n\nHow did this all happen?\n\nJON FINER: Look, I think there are# a few key aspects of this deal that## really speak to the approach that# our administration and President## Biden have taken to foreign policy# since we got here.\n\nOne is diplomacy.\n\nWe have said from the very beginning diplomacy# would be the hallmark of our foreign policy,## and that includes diplomacy at the level# of the president.\n\nHe made a call to## a fellow head of state, the prime minister of# Slovenia, one hour before telling the country## and the world that he was no longer going# to be running in this year's election to## try to free up one more aspect of this# deal that was ultimately successful.\n\nIt's that sort of face-to-face and# person-to-person diplomacy that's at## the core of our policy.\n\nSecond is allies and# partners.\n\nThe president has said his world## view was predicated on rebuilding, revitalizing# America's alliances, and you saw a half-dozen## allies come together today with different aspects# of this deal, which ultimately led to get it done.\n\nAnd the third is execution.\n\nAs you said, this# was highly complex.\n\nIt involved a wide range## of countries, complicated logistics,# all coming together on the same day,## and it was executed without a# hitch.\n\nAnd as a result of that,## a large number of people who would otherwise# be held captive are going to be coming home,## including three Americans and one legal# permanent resident of the United States.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: A question about the timing.\n\nWhy## now?\n\nWhy did Vladimir Putin view this# deal as being in his best intere.. JON FINER: Well, I'm the last# person who's going to speak## to the mind-set of Vladimir Putin.\n\nThat# would be a question better placed to others.\n\nBut one of the things that you realize, having# worked now on a number of these deals, even## though this one was the most complex, is that they# sort of move on their own speed.\n\nThey're a long,## very agonizing sometimes periods in which# it feels like not a lot is getting done.\n\nYou continue to beat your head against# it, continue to try to be creative,## come up with new solutions,# problem-solve, have conversations,## and then ultimately things can end up# moving much faster than anyone anticipates.\n\nAnd that's what happened here.\n\nWe wish we# could have done this sooner.\n\nUltimately,## we got it done, we believe, in a timely# fashion that has led people to now be home## spending time with their families before too# much longer.\n\nAnd we're quite happy about that.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: To what degree does# this signal any sort of breakthrough## of tensions between the U.S. and Russia,# and might any of this successful diplomacy## be put to use in helping bring an# end to Russia's war in Ukraine?\n\nJON FINER: To be honest, I would caution# anybody against drawing too many broader## conclusions about the U.S.-Russia# relationship based on this deal.\n\nThat is not the course we're on, what# you just described.\n\nWe are obviously## in a very difficult place, completely on# opposite sides of the conflict in Ukraine,## and I don't see that changing any time# soon unless Russia makes a significant## set of changes to its approach and its# world view, and we don't anticipate that.\n\nWhat we had here was a target of opportunity,# an opportunity to get some people home who## otherwise would be continued to be held# in a just unconscionable situation.\n\nWe## took that opportunity.\n\nBut, otherwise, we are# continuing with our approach, certainly with## the Ukraine war, into our broader approach to# the world, on its current course and speed.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: While this nightmare is certainly# over for those released, there were other## Americans, as you well know, who were left out# of this exchange, namely Marc Fogel, an American## sentenced to 14 years of hard labor in Russia,# and a U.S.-Russian citizen, Ksenia Karelina,## who's facing charges of treason for allegedly# donating $51 to a Ukrainian charity in the U.S. What is the administration doing to# secure their release at this point?\n\nJON FINER: There continue to be# a number of Americans held under## very difficult circumstances, including the# two Americans you just mentioned in Russia,## including Americans in Syria and Afghanistan# and other places around the world.\n\nAnd this administration has made an enormous# commitment from before the time we came into## this office, from the transition# to the Biden/Harris administration,## to do what we could to get these people home.# I think the president has now an extraordinary## track record of doing just that.\n\nWe're going# to continue to work on those cases and all## cases of Americans held who shouldn't# be until the end of this administration.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: Deputy National Security Adviser# Jon Finer, thanks for joining us this evening.\n\nJON FINER: Thanks again.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: Now let's get some# additional perspective on the prisoner swap.\n\nNick Schifrin has that -- Nick.\n\nNICK SCHIFRIN: Geoff, to discuss the# larger implications of today's events,## we turn to Andrew Weiss.\n\nHe's a former# State Department official who served in## the George H.W.\n\nBush and Clinton administrations,## and is now the vice president for studies at# the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nThanks very much, Andrew Weiss.\n\nWelcome back... ANDREW WEISS, Carnegie Endowment for# International Peace: Great to be here.\n\nNICK SCHIFRIN: ... t.. As we just showed a few minu.. and time welcomed home all these Russian spies and# their families on a big red carpet, big flowers.\n\nWhat messages is he sending?\n\nANDREW WEISS: So Vladimir Putin goes to# great lengths to wrap hi.. of the Russian security establishment, but# all of that covers up a pretty unpleasant## and embarrassing fact, which is that Russian# spies have been arrested all over the world## or caught red-handed doing bad stuff, including# the hit man in the Berlin case, Vadim Krasikov.\n\nNICK SCHIFRIN: Krasikov, right.\n\nANDREW WEISS: So what Vladimir Putin is doi.. frankly, for the continued underperformance# of his security establishment and acting## like they're big heroes.\n\nThey're# screw-ups.\n\nThey're not heroes.\n\nNICK SCHIFRIN: As I reported earlier, the U.S.# offered two different trades before today,## for Whelan by himself and then Whelan, Evan# Gershkovich, including those two Russian## so-called illegal sleeper agents that had been# caught in Slovenia, but both were rejected.\n\nAnd the message that the U.S. got was,## call us back when we have Krasikov.\n\nSo# why is Krasikov so important to Putin?\n\nANDREW WEISS: So there's indications that they# know each other personally.\n\nThe Wall Street## Journal has a wonderful long piece that appeared# some time today that says they potentially worked## together back when Vladimir Putin was the# deputy mayor of St. Petersburg in the 1990s.\n\nSo this is a career Russian intelligence# operative who's presumably conducted a## variety of assassinations and targeted killings in# various parts of the world, including in Moscow,## and who claims to have gone to shooting ranges and# done other things with Vladimir Putin personally.\n\nSo there seems to be a connection between# the two men -- the two men, rather.\n\nAnd you## saw when he came down the jetway today at the# airport of Moscow, Vladimir Putin hugged him.\n\nNICK SCHIFRIN: And you and I have# talked multiple times about how## the different parts of the national security# apparatus in Russia often fight each other.\n\nCould there also be a dispute within the# intelligence agencies inside of Russia over## who to release?\n\nAnd would the FSB -- Putin being a# former KGB colonel, would the FSB win that fight?\n\nANDREW WEISS: So Russia has a sprawling# national security apparatus, which is## big by design.\n\nIt's intended to kind of# avoid power consolidating in any corner,## so that Vladimir Putin can# kind of divide and rule.\n\nBut what we have seen, rather than the# Russian security establishment backing## away from confrontation with the West, is# leaning in.\n\nAnd so we have seen reports of## the Russian intelligence services trying# to assassinate the CEO of a senior German## defense manufacturer.\n\nWe have seen# them conduct sabotage operations.\n\nWhen Vladimir Putin says he's at war with the# West, I think we need to take him at his word.\n\nNICK SCHIFRIN: Why would# Putin agree to this deal now,## three months before the U.S.# election,instead of waiting.\n\nANDREW WEISS: Vladimir Putin is a cold-blooded## operator who is tactical and who# believes in being transactional.\n\nSo for him to get what he thinks is a pretty# good deal -- for ages, they have been pushing## to get the hit man in the Berlin case released.# This is a person who is serving a life sentence## for conducting a murder, a targeted killing, in# broad daylight.\n\nSo, for them, this is a good deal.\n\nAnd if you look at the other Russians# who are coming out of detention,## these are people who Russians wanted back, who are# intelligence operatives that have been rolled up## in Poland and Norway and in Slovenia, as# well as people conducted in U.S. courts.\n\nBut what is -- all these debates about a deal come# down to are the numbers, and the counting game is## really complicated.\n\nSo U.S. officials today# are at pains to say we're getting 16 people## out and the Russians are getting eight back.# So it's not an apples-to-apples comparison.\n\nNICK SCHIFRIN: And yet Putin# did not release other Americans,## as Geoff was just highlighting, Marc Fogel# included.\n\nWhy might he withhold some of them?\n\nANDREW WEISS: They're bargaining chips.# So there are other Russians that they want## back.\n\nThere are people that the Russians# will continue to take into attention.\n\nAny American who's foolish enough to go# to visit Russia, even for family reasons,## is at risk.\n\nPresident Biden today made a point of# that in saying the underlying message of today's## good news is also that people need to steer clear# of travel to dangerous destinations like Russia.\n\nNICK SCHIFRIN: And quickly, in the moments we# have left, you have had an extensive career## in government.\n\nHow complicated would it# have been to coordinate all the European## countries and all the U.S. agencies and# Russian intelligence to get this deal?\n\nANDREW WEISS: I'm glad you brought that up.\n\nThat's# what's truly unprecedented about today's news.## It's a multidimensional problem that wasn't just# negotiated between the United States and Russia.\n\nThe German role was absolutely# critical because, as you pointed out,## that was the key demand from the Russian# side.\n\nSo without the German support,## this deal would not have come together.\n\nAnd# then you had lesser roles played by our allies.\n\nNICK SCHIFRIN: Andrew Weiss, thanks# very much -- Geoff, back to you.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: Well, thank you both.\n\nAnd, Nick, as you mentio.. Marc Fogel, who was sentenced to 14 years in# a Russian penal colony back in 2022.\n\nHe was## arrested in 2021 at a Moscow airport for# carrying medically prescribed marijuana.\n\nEarlier this evening, before I spoke with# the deputy national security adviser,## Marc Fogel's sister, Anne,# joined us from her Montana home.\n\nAnne Fogel, thank you for being with us.\n\nANNE FOGEL, Sister of Marc# Fogel: Thank you for having## me.\n\nIt's really important# that I t.. GEOFF BENNETT: While some families are rejoicing# today as they have been reunited with their## loved ones, your family still has to wait.# How are you doing?\n\nHow are you holding up?\n\nANNE FOGEL: It's been a heart-wrenching 36# hours.\n\nI spoke with Marc yesterday morning## on the phone.\n\nAnd he -- when I realized# that he was still in Rybinsk and everyone## else had been pulled out of their penal# colonies, it was -- my heart really sank.\n\nBut it's really hard to give up hope.\n\nAnd for# the entire day, I roller-coastered, around## thinking that Rybinsk is about# four-and-a-half-hours from Moscow.## And I thought that maybe they would be driving him# down or I -- it was just really hard to let it go.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: When you spoke with him, what did# he say?\n\nWhat did he tell you?\n\nHow is he doing?\n\nANNE FOGEL: He was kind of in the dark.\n\nHe knew## that something was going on.\n\nAnd then# he saw a little bit of news about Paul.\n\nThey're constantly playing the television and# news stations in the penal colony that he's## in.\n\nAnd so he knew something was going on,# but he doesn't speak Russian.\n\nSo he wasn't## exactly sure.\n\nAnd he called.\n\nAnd I didn't# want to -- I know this is crushing him.\n\nSo I didn't want to tell him what I knew.\n\nBut# we -- at that point in time, we were calling## our senators and calling the ambassadors that we# have been in touch with.\n\nAnd we were trying to## get something activated for him.\n\nAnd so it was a# crazy day of phones and messaging and e-mailing.\n\nAnd it's all for naught.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: The national# security adviser, Jake Sullivan,## said today that the administration is working# to secure your brother's release from Russia.\n\nHave you heard anything from the administration?\n\nANNE FOGEL: No, we have never heard# from the administration.\n\nI did ta.. to -- my sister-in-law and I did talk# to Jake Sullivan about two years ago.\n\nBut Marc has never been prioritized.\n\nHe# had -- he was convicted under the same## code as Brittney Griner, but he was never# designated as wrongfully detained.\n\nAnd we## don't have the NBA behind us and we don't# have The Wall Street Journal behind us,## so it's been very difficult# for us to get our man out.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: Your mother, your 95-year-old# mother, filed a lawsuit in June against the## U.S. State Department over its failure to# declare Marc Fogel as wrongfully detained.\n\nWhy do you think he hasn't# received that designation## and how has it complicated efforts,# in your view, to secure his release?\n\nANNE FOGEL: I don't think he's been# designated because I don't think he's## important enough.\n\nAs I said, we just don't# have the notoriety, the celebrity status.\n\nAnd, believe me, the worst part of# this process is being pitted against## other Americans.\n\nI don't want that.\n\nNo# one wants that.\n\nMarc doesn't want that.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: When we started our# conversation, you said you wanted## to get your brother's story out.\n\nWhat do you# want folks to know about your brother Marc?\n\nANNE FOGEL: I want you to know that Marc# has had an outsized impact on the world,## essentially, because he has taught# internationally for so many years.\n\nHe has thousands of students that he has taught,# and he is -- there's not a hall of fame for## teaching, but he is the best of the best.\n\nAnd# you have one of his students in your newsroom,## as we speak.\n\nHe has students all over the# world writing to him, praying for him,## making movies about him.\n\nWe need justice.\n\nHe needs# to come home.\n\nHe needs to be with his family.\n\nHis life and sons need him.\n\nAnd this# is absolutely unfair that they did not## bring him home with the greatest historic# prisoner swap since the World War.\n\nI wish I## could be more steady perhaps in saying these# things, but I feel very wronged for Marc.\n\nAnd he needs to come home, and the# Biden administration has nothing## to lose.\n\nThey should have brought him home.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: Anne Fogel,# our thoughts are with you,## your family and your brother Marc.\n\nThanks again# for your

after Israel's military confirmed an# airstrike last month had killed the leader of## Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif.\n\nAlso# today, Iran's supreme leader attended the## funeral in Tehran for

since the## October 7 attack and called for an immediate# release of hostages still being held in Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force has concluded that a deadly# Osprey crash off the coast of Japan last year## was caused by a -- quote -- \"catastrophic# failure\" in a gearbox.\n\nThe investigation## also found that the pilot ignored warnings# to land the aircraft.\n\nThe crash killed eight## service members and led to a monthslong# grounding of all military Ospreys.\n\nIt## was one of several Osprey crashes in recent# years that killed 20 service members overall.\n\nA New York appeals court has

involving the judge's daughter and her# ties to Vice President Kamala Harris,## who is now likely to be Mr. Trump's# opponent in the November election.\n\nSenate Republicans today blocked legislation# that would have expanded the child tax## credit for low-income families and extend# some corporate tax breaks.\n\nIn doing so,## they torpedoed a bipartisan $79# billion tax bill that the House## had overwhelmingly approved.\n\nRepublicans# are betting that they can push through a## more conservative tax bill next year if they# win control of Congress and the White House.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation# proposed a rule today that would ban## airlines from charging parents to sit# with their children.\n\nUnder the proposal,## children 13 years or younger must be allowed# to sit with their parent or guardian for## free.\n\nIf adjacent seats aren't available# when booking, families can opt for a full## refund or wait for a seat to open up.\n\nAnd# if one doesn't, they can rebook for free.\n\nThe Biden administration says the rule could# save a family of four up to $200 in seat fees.\n\nOn Wall Street today, stocks dropped after# recent data sparked worries of an economic##

Colorado, where at least one person was## found dead.\n\nIn California, more than 5,800# personnel, 500 fire trucks and 40 helicopters## are battling a fire that's larger than all# of Los Angeles.\n\nThe Park Fire, as it's known,## is the country's largest and has ballooned# to historic proportions in just over a week.\n\nStephanie Sy has the latest.\n\nSTEPHANIE SY: This is the view for# firefighters on the front lines of## California's Park Fire.\n\nThe blaze, believed# to be started by a local man's burning car,## is now the fifth largest in state history.\n\nSERGIO ARELLANO, Cal Fire: I have not personally## seen a fire grow so fast in# such a short.. STEPHANIE SY: In just a week, nearly# 400,000 acres burned across four counties,## forcing thousands of evacuations and# destroying hundreds of structures.\n\nIn rural Cohasset, California, Dave Tehan and his# son Jonathan are both members of the county fire## department.\n\nWhile they battle to protect their# town, their own homes were lost to the flames.\n\nDAVE TEHAN, Volunteer Firefighter: I feel# luckier than some of the people here,## because we do have a few things, not very# much, but a few things to hold in our hands## that survived.\n\nThe friends from --# that I have known for so many years## have just stepped up and shown so# much support.\n\nI feel rich in that.\n\nSTEPHANIE SY: Kristy Michael Daneau also# live in Cohasset.\n\nThey lost their house## to another fast-moving fire six years ago# in Paradise, California.\n\nNow this is all## that remains of the home where they rebuilt# their lives.\n\nThey had no fire insurance.\n\nKRISTY DANEAU, Wildfire Evacuee: The# most important things I grabbed was## me and my brother and sister have my mom's ashes,## along with my dad.\n\nAnd so I was able to# grab a few little pictures and her ashes.\n\nSTEPHANIE SY: The Park Fire's explosive# expansion is nearly unprecedented,## says UCLA climate scientist Daniel SWAIN.\n\nDANIEL SWAIN, Climate Scientist, UCLA: This# is definitely a top-tier event in terms of## how quickly it moved across the landscape in those# initial days, some of the vastest rates of spread## over that initial 24-to-48 hour period that we# have seen on a wildfire in this part of the world.\n\nSTEPHANIE SY: Nearly 100 fires are# currently burning across the West## and 4.5 million acres have already burned# this year, about a million above average.\n\nThis week, multiple blazes broke# out across Colorado's Front Range,## killing at least one person and forcing# residents to flee their homes near Denver.## Governor Jared Polis has now activated the# National Guard to assist with logistics.\n\nMeanwhile, in Oregon, crews are stretched# thin, battling more than 30 separate fires.\n\nDON CAPE, Oregon Resident: I have lived here# all my life and never, never seen it this way.\n\nSTEPHANIE SY: To make matters worse,## another brutal heat wave is forecast to# turn up the temperature this weekend,## a dynamic that Swain says continues to drive# the intensity of this year's fire season.\n\nDANIEL SWAIN: It has become a very# active season.\n\nAnd a big part of the## reason for this is that nearly the entire# western half of the country as well,## as the western half of Canada, have# experienced, much like California has,## record-breaking heat in recent weeks# over a very long and sustained period.\n\nSo all of that extra heat, even following what# was a relatively wet winter in some places,## has really dried out the vegetation, in# some cases to near-record dry levels.\n\nSTEPHANIE SY: And that means there's# plenty of fuel for the fires yet to burn.\n\nFor the PBS \"News Hour,\" I'm Stephanie Sy.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: Former President Donald# Trump is facing backlash for calling## Vice President Kamala Harris' racial identity into## question when he addressed a Black# journalists convention yesterday.\n\nThat's as the vice president# herself wrapped up a series of## events aimed at speaking directly to Black voters.\n\nOur Laura Barron-Lopez has more.\n\nLAURA BARRON-LOPEZ: Delivering the eulogy# before hundreds of mourners at Fallbrook## Church in North Houston today, Vice President# Kamala Harris bid farewell to a friend,## the late Texas Representative Sheila# Jackson Lee, who served in Congress## for nearly three decades and became one# of its most influential Black members.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS, Vice President of the

remembering# a fellow Black woman trailblazer,## as her own racial identity is being# attacked by her rival, Donald Trump.\n\nSpeaking to a historically Black# sorority yesterday, Harris slammed## her opponent hours after the Republican# nominee questioned her racial identity.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS: Donald Trump spoke at# the annual meeting of the National## Association of Black Journalists,# and it was the same old show,## the divisiveness and the disrespect.\n\nAnd let me# just say, the American people deserve better.\n\nLAURA BARRON-LOPEZ: Trump was asked if Harris,## who is poised to be the first Black and South# Asian woman to.. was a DEI or diversity hire, as some# of his Republican allies have said.\n\nDONALD TRUMP, Former President of the#United States (R) ... promoting Indian heritage.\n\nI didn't know# she was black until a number of years ago,## when she happened to turn black, and# now she wants to be known as black.\n\nDONALD TRUMP: So, I don't know.# Is she Indian or is she black?\n\nLAURA BARRON-LOPEZ: In spite of the backlash,## Trump is digging in, posting this# to his social media plat.. thanking Harris for the -- quote -- \"nice picture\"# that showed the \"love of your Indian heritage.\"\n\nAnd at a rally in Pennsylvania last# night, the Trump campaign displayed## news headlines that referred to her as# an Indian-American senator.\n\nThe former## president accused Harris of faking her identity.\n\nDONALD TRUMP: In her speech in Atlanta last night,## Kamala Harris even tried to outbrand a new# Southern accent.\n\nDid you hear a new accent?\n\nLAURA BARRON-LOPEZ: Harris is biracial, the# daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father,## and her Black identity a key part of her# history as the member of a historically## Black sorority while a student# at a historically Black college.\n\nToday, at the U.S. southern border, Trump's# running mate tried to put the spotlight back## on policy, namely, immigration.\n\nVice

LISA DESJARDINS: And for 25 minutes, Zach heard a## candidate he could support.\n\nBut then the# speech and Zach's thoughts changed again.\n\nZACH HORN: It became a stump speech.\n\nAnd# it was a lengthy stump speech, at that.\n\nAnd## that lost me, to be quite# honest.\n\nI was going to say,## I was hoping for the call for unity.\n\nIt# didn't happen the way that I expected it## to.\n\nAnd so that initial move closer kind of# got washed with some of those things later.\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: Now he's looking at# Harris, considering her seriously,## and saying her V.P.\n\ndecision could make# the difference.\n\nZach's experience with## Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has been good.\n\nZACH HORN: If Josh Shapiro# gets selected as the V.P.,## I'd probably go from a lean-Trump# position currently to a lean-Harris## position at that point.\n\nBut I still# want to hear what everybody has to say.\n\nAnother unsure Republican.\n\nSTEVE BECK, Alabama Voter: If it was tomorrow, it# wo.. LISA DESJARDINS: Steve Beck runs his own travel# agency in Alabama.\n\nIn June, he had mixed feelings.\n\nSTEVE BECK: On one hand discouraged, but,# on the other hand, just encouraged because## we

Something# feels different.\n\nFor voters,## for the deciders especially, the# race is not over.\n\nIt's restarting.\n\nFor the \"PBS News Hour,\" I'm Lisa Desjardins.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: The man accused as# the mastermind behind the September## 11 terrorist attacks and his# two accomplices have agreed## to plea -- have agreed to a plea deal in# exchange for avoiding the death penalty.\n\nThe development comes 16 years# after their prosecution started.\n\nAli Rogin has the latest.\n\nALI ROGIN: The three men, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,## the alleged leader behind the attacks, and# Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak Bin Attash and## Mustafa Ahmed Adam al Hawsawi, all agreed to# plead guilty in exchange for life sentences.\n\nThe men have been in custody since# 2003 and initially charged in 2008,## but there have been years of legal delays due## in part to the brutal torture the men# were subjected to while in detention.\n\nIn a letter, government prosecutors said# they recognize the deal would be met with## mixed reactions among thousands of# family members who lost loved ones,## but they called it the best path to# finality and justice in this case.\n\nFor a closer look, I'm joined by Wall# Street Journal reporter Jess Bravin.## He's the author of \"The Terror Courts,\" an# account of military trials at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nJess, thank you so much for joining us.\n\nHow did this deal come to be# and why is it happening now?\n\nJESS BRAVIN, The Wall Street Journal: Well,# this deal was under negotiation since 2022,## and it wasn't the first time a# deal like this was considered.\n\nFor years, prosecutors and officials in the# military commission apparatus thought that a## deal for life sentences in exchange for guilty# plays was -- pleas would be the only way out.## So an earlier effort was quashed by higher-ups in# the Pentagon.\n\nThis one began, as I said, in 2022## and has continued as some of the detainees, some# of the defendants, KSM, as we have called him,## and the other two decided they were ready to get# some finality for their own fate and move forward.\n\nSo it really accelerated in the last# two weeks.\n\nThere was a court session## at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nProsecutors and the defense## attorneys said they were ready to wrap# it up and try to get this case closed.\n\nALI ROGIN: Prosecutors had# sought the death penalty,## but the alleged torture that# the defendants underwent for## years complicated those proceedings.\n\nHow# did that all factor into this decision?\n\nJESS BRAVIN: Well, it was# really essential, because,## right after 9/11, when reports began emerging# about brutal treatment of enemy prisoners,## torture, as in fact President# Obama called it at one point,## began to emerge, there were questions about# how would this affect any future trials?\n\nAnd there were legal experts then who# warned that it would make it very difficult,## if not impossible, to prosecute people# if they were severely mistreated by the## government while in custody.\n\nAnd# that is exactly what has happened.\n\nThese detainees wanted to bring in evidence# of how they were treated by the CIA.\n\nMohammed## had been water-boarded.\n\nThey'd been beaten.# All kinds of things had been done to them## that the United States would not tolerate for# its own citizens.\n\nAnd they wanted to bring in## evidence saying that any statements# they made were infected by torture.\n\nSo a lot of the pretrial wrangling# over more than a decade has been over,## what can the defendants introduce about their# treatment?\n\nAnd then there was a second factor,## which is that under a doctrine# sometimes called unclean hands,## the government is punished by courts# when it commits misconduct in a trial.\n\nAnd abusing defendants in custody is# misconduct.\n\nSo it is possible that,## even if they were convicted and sentenced to# death, on appeal, a higher court might sanction## the government by taking the death penalty off the# table.\n\nSo the death penalty seemed to be really a## bridge too far, given the mistreatment of these# prisoners after they were captured by the U.S. ALI ROGIN: And what do we know about how the# families of 9/11 victims are responding to this?\n\nJESS BRAVIN: It is a total mixed# bag.\n\nThere are thousands of families## of victims.\n\nAnd as you would expect,# there are opinions across the gamut.\n\nThere are some who feel that nothing# short of death is appropriate for## these defendants.\n\nAnd based on their# actions, it would be hard to say,## if the death penalty is appropriate for# anyone, it wouldn't be appropriate for## them.\n\nOthers simply oppose the death penalty.# Many Americans and people around the world## just philosophically are morally opposed# the death penalty period for anybody.\n\nAnd some of those are among the victims' families.## And then there are those who really# take the prosecutor's point of view,## which is that, ideally, they could pursue# capital punishment for these defendants,## but it's just time for closure and it's time# to end this proceeding and move forward.\n\nOne of the features of the deal is that# there will be a sentencing hearing,## where the defendants can testify, but# they will have to answer questions## from the victim's families.\n\nAnd for many of# those families who are looking for answers,## who are looking for some sense of these# accused perpetrators, that hearing will## be the substitution for a full trial on# what happened in the lead-up to 9/11.\n\nALI ROGIN: In the moments we have left,## what happens next?\n\nWhere do these# defendants spend.. JESS BRAVIN: Well, again, it hasn't fully been# approved by all the proceedings that have to## happen.\n\nBut the plan is that they will next enter# a plea probably within a week or a month of now.\n\nNext year, there will be the sentencing# hearing.\n\nAnd after their sentence is confirmed,## they likely will spend it right where# they are now at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nThe## technical status of their detention will# change.\n\nThey will be sentenced prisoners,## but in terms of their day-to-day lives, probably# not much will change.\n\nThey will be looking at## the same four walls that they are looking# at right now for the rest of their lives.\n\nALI ROGIN: Jess Bravin, covering this every step# of the way, thank you so much for joining us.\n\nJESS BRAVIN: You bet.\n\nThank you.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: Today's historic prisoner release# from Russia was thanks to the diplomatic work of a## group of democracies, freeing over a dozen people# from the autocratic regime of Vladimir Putin.\n\nBut, as William Brangham reports,## a new book examines how autocracies are gaining# power and what they're doi..

WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Accountability.\n\nANNE APPLEBAUM: ... accountabi.. that's the language of their# own internal oppositions.\n\nAnd so they need to undermine the# people who use it and, if they can,## discredit it.\n\nAnd that's part of what# we're seeing happen now around the world.\n\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: One of the stereotypes# that you try to puncture here is this idea## that they really don't have shared interests,# that they work individually to oppress and## terrorize their own citizens, but don't really# care so much about what happens elsewhere.\n\nWhat is it that they do see as the value in# helping -- what does Xi see in helping Putin,## or Putin in North Korea, for instance?\n\nANNE APPLEBAUM: Well, some of it is pragmatic.# So Putin gets ammunition from North Korea,## and he gets drones from Iran, and he gets# components for his defense industry from Xi.\n\nAnd some of it is a little bit more than that.\n\nSo# Xi may have an interest in not seeing Putin fail,## because, if Putin fails, that speaks badly# of autocratic systems.\n\nIt speaks badly of the## kinds of leaders who rule with absolute power.# And it might have a negative impact on him.\n\nThey worry a great deal about the# autocratic club and the fate of its members.\n\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: Your book is# dedicated to the optimists out there.\n\nAnd I wonder, when you look at how the West and# NATO stood up to Putin's aggression in Ukraine,## does that give you a sense# of optimism that the forces## of democracy can be martialed against autocracy?\n\nANNE APPLEBAUM: It really did.\n\nI mean, it was a# moment nobody was really sure what would happen## when Russia invaded Ukraine in full-scale# invasion in 2022, and the degree to which not## just the old West, Europe and America, not just# NATO, but the entire democratic world rallied.\n\nThere's something like 50 countries# who've participated in the defense of## Ukraine or the aid of Ukraine.\n\nThe# flip side is that I don't think we## fully understood at the beginning of# the war the degree to which there was## going to be an autocratic network# that was going to support Putin.\n\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: Supporting him... ... with arms# and money and al.. ANNE APPLEBAUM: Arms and money# and support of other kinds.\n\nAnd we need to now begin thinking about how# to counter that.\n\nAnd people are beginning to## think about it, but a little --# like everything, a little late.\n\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: This is not a# book about Donald Trump.\n\nI mean,## he gets a few passing mentions and a# good chunk of the last page of your book.\n\nBut you do write that, if he were# reelected and uses the tools of## executive power against his perceived enemies,# that it would -- quote -- then it would be:## \"The blending of the autocratic and# democratic worlds will be complete.\"\n\nDo you think that Donald# Trump wants to be an autocrat?\n\nANNE APPLEBAUM: He certainly# says so.\n\nI mean, sometimes,## he says so in a kind of jokey way:# I will be dictator for one day.\n\nSometimes, he says so in the language he uses# about -- whether it's about President Xi,## who he admires, or President Putin, who he# admires, or even the dictator of North Korea,## who's driven his country into poverty# and isolation, who he also admires.\n\nSo he's telling us what kinds of people# are around -- and he rarely -- he has## very few kind words for American# allies or for fellow democracies.## It's really the absolute -- people with# absolute power that he wants to be like.\n\nAnd you can also hear in the language he uses,# whether it's about judges, or whether it's## about the media, or whether it's about American# institutions of other kind, about the electoral## system, that he has great disdain for the# institutions of democracy and the rules that## were set up to make sure that power is checked in# our country and that the executive isn't a king.\n\nAnd those are disturbing traits.# And they would be -- they would be## disturbing at any time in history, but# they're particularly disturbing now,## when we have the rise of so many leaders# with absolute power around the world who## would love to have a transactional# American president to do deals with.\n\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: People who live# in democracies love to think that,## when pressed, that the system will be robust# and stand up to this.\n\nI mean, that was what## many people thought of -- happened during the# first Trump administration, that the system held.\n\nDo you think that that's naive?\n\nANNE APPLEBAUM: It can be naive.\n\nI mean, there is a pattern.\n\nYou .. who lose elections, people like Donald Trump who# believe they are owed power, they deserve power,## who lose elections and who come back in a second# term and say, right, this time, I'm not going to## make that mistake again, and who then change their# electoral system, or, in Orban's case, change the## constitution, change the judicial system,# in order to make sure that they never lose.\n\nThe attention that's paid,# for example, to Project 2025,## which is a project of The Heritage Foundation,# which describes exactly how you would do that## and which sounds remarkably like what's# happened in other countries, including,## by the way, in Venezuela -- that# was how Hugo Chavez took over.\n\nThis isn't necessarily a right-wing# or a left-wing project.\n\nIt's just an## antidemocratic project.\n\nAnd the fact that he will# be surrounded by people like that is disturbing.\n\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: The book is called \"Autocracy,# Inc.: The Dictators Who Want to Run the World.\"\n\nAnne Applebaum, great to# see you.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nANNE APPLEBAUM: Thank you.\n\nGEOFF BENNETT: And that is the \"News# Hour\" for tonight.\n\nI'm Geoff Bennett.\n\nFor all of us here at the \"PBS# News Hour,\" thanks for joining us."
