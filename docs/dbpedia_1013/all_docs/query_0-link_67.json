He talks with correspondent Martha Teichner about the feat that captured the imagination of the world, and about his passion for wire-walking which, he says, has never changed.\n\n05:55\n\nThe journey of rapper-turned-country singer Jelly Roll\n\nThe artist known as Jelly Roll is a 39-year-old former rapper whose songs tell of the troubled life he used to lead. He's now one of the biggest names in country music, with two Grammy nominations this year. With correspondent Kelefa Sanneh, we go with Jelly Roll to one of the jail cells he lived in, where he wrote songs and hatched his plans to make it in music—eventually finding himself on the \"holy ground\" of Nashville's Grand Ole Opry. (This story was originally broadcast on January 7, 2024.)\n\n08:33\n\nWould President Nixon survive a Watergate crisis today?\n\nFifty years ago, President Richard Nixon – facing impeachment and removal from office amid charges of abuse of power, obstructing justice, and contempt of Congress – was visited by leading members of his own party, which had abandoned him; he resigned. But if Watergate happened today, with today's polarized politics and hot-button media environment, would a President Nixon survive? CBS News' John Dickerson talks with Garrett Graff, author of \"Watergate: A New History,\" and historian Brian Rosenwald about a political climate change.\n\n08:34\n\nWhat the historic prisoner swap might mean for the future\n\nOn Thursday 16 political prisoners, including former U.S. Marine Paul Wheelan and Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, were released in a historic exchange with Russia that also freed 8 Russians held in other countries (including an assassin working for the Russian state who was convicted and jailed in Germany). Correspondent Seth Doane talks with former U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan, who says Vladimir Putin, and other authoritarians, may be emboldened to wrongfully detain Americans abroad if they can benefit from prisoner swaps in the future.\n\n04:00\n\nCreating meditative \"Circles in the Sand\"\n\nSand artist Denny Dyke has been creating elaborate designs on the beach at Bandon, Oregon – twisting shapes that have drawn fans to walk his labyrinths before Nature washes them away. Correspondent Conor Knighton visits these temporary artworks that have become a spiritual ritual for many.\n\n04:24\n\nRalph Macchio on the return of the Karate Kid in \"Cobra Kai\"\n\nWhen \"The Karate Kid\" came out in the summer of 1984, the little movie about rival martial arts students, competing against big-budget blockbusters, became one of the highest-grossing films of the year. Ralph Macchio and his co-star William Zabka have since transferred their young rivalry into adulthood, by playing the grown-up Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence in the series \"Cobra Kai,\" now in its sixth and final season on Netflix. For Macchio it's a return to a character that has both enriched his life and challenged it. Correspondent Lee Cowan reports.\n\n08:15\n\nKamala Harris' turn to make history\n\nIn the past week, following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race, Vice President Kamala Harris has all but locked in her party's nomination, racked up an impressive list of endorsements, and hauled in a mountain of cash. Constituencies who had tuned out of the campaign are tuning back in. Correspondent Martha Teichner talks with political strategist Stuart Stevens and presidential historian Lindsay Chervinsky about what the past suggests is in Harris' future.\n\n06:11\n\n\"Wicked\" director Jon M. Chu on the road to Oz\n\nJon M. Chu, the son of immigrant parents, immersed himself in American culture growing up, and built a career as a filmmaker with hits such as \"Crazy Rich Asians\" and \"In the Heights,\" tapping into his own identity and translating stories of struggle and ambition to the silver screen. He talks with correspondent Jo Ling Kent about how his childhood infatuation with \"The Wizard of Oz\" led to his directing the movie version of the smash Broadway musical \"Wicked.\"\n\n07:35\n\nPhilippe Petit looks back on his phenomenal 1974 Twin Towers walk\n\nFifty years ago, on August 7, 1974, the French highwire artist walked a VERY high wire illicitly strung between the Twin Towers of New York City's World Trade Center. His passion for wire-walking, he says, has never changed.\n\nWill this be Kamala Harris' moment to make history?\n\nIn a week's time, the vice president has all but locked in her party's nomination, racked up an impressive list of endorsements, and hauled in a mountain of cash. Constituencies who had tuned out of the 2024 campaign are tuning back in.\n\nArts\n\nCreating meditative \"Circles in the Sand\"\n\nSand artist Denny Dyke has been creating elaborate designs on the beach at Bandon, Oregon – twisting shapes that have drawn fans to walk his labyrinths before Nature washes them away. Correspondent Conor Knighton visits these temporary artworks that have become a spiritual ritual for many.\n\n04:24\n\nThe secrets of Banksy\n\nPutting together the first authorized exhibition in 14 years of works by the anonymous street artist Banksy required extensive planning, and a cover story to hide its secret until it opened, unannounced, in Glasgow last summer. Correspondent Seth Doane explores the art and the mysteries of Banksy's world, including the continued speculation about the artist's true identity, a closely-held secret for decades. [An earlier version of this story was broadcast August 13, 2023.]\n\n07:04\n\nRock star: Sculptor Jago on unveiling humankind in marble\n\nThirty-seven-year-old sculptor Jacopo Cardillo, better known in his native Italy as Jago, has earned a following with his contemporary approach to this classical art form, exposing on social media his process of shaping marble. When he embraced a group of teens who'd defaced one of his works, Jago won a new fan touched by his humanity: Whoopi Goldberg. Correspondent Seth Doane talked with the artist about his most ambitious project yet: creating what will be a 6-ton sculpture more than 16 feet tall.\n\n05:04\n\nA Henry Mancini tribute album\n\nIn honor of the composer's centenary next year, the family of Henry Mancini has been recording a tribute album featuring some of the Oscar- and Grammy-winner's most beloved music, performed by some of the most celebrated artists today.
