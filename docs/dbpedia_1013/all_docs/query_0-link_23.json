        "text": "Storyline\n\nRussia on Tuesday said its forces had thwarted Ukrainian armyâs attack on its Kursk Oblast, while Ukraine reported that it continued to engage in battles with the Russian army in various directions.\n\nIn a daily report release on Tuesday, the Russian Ministry of Defense said that the Russian army occupied more advantageous positions on the frontline and seized a settlement.\n\nThe Russian army hit various Ukrainian targets, including radars, ammunition depots and electronic warfare base stations, according to the report.\n\nThe report said that the Russian air defense system shot down a MiG-29 fighter of the Ukrainian army and intercepted several of its rockets and drones.\n\nThe Russian army has also thwarted Ukraine's attack on its Kursk Oblast and repelled it. The governor of the oblast said that several civilians were killed or wounded in the attack.\n\nThe General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported on the same day that the Ukrainian army continued to engage in battles with Russian forces in various directions including Pokrovsk.\n\nThe European Union (EU) is ready to disburse 4.2 billion euros to Ukraine after the EU deemed the country's reform efforts satisfactory, the Council of the EU said on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to a press release, the council gave its green light to the first tranche of regular payments of grants and loans to Ukraine under the EU's Ukraine Facility.\n\nThe conditions and reforms have been met, the council said. The reforms cover public financial management, governance of state-owned enterprises, business environment, energy and demining.\n\nThe Ukraine Facility, from which the funds will be released, entered into force in March 2024. It foresees up to 50 billion euros of financial support, including 17 billion in grants and another 33 billion in loans, for the 2024-2027 period.\n\nAccording to a report of Russian media Russia Today on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday said that Ukraine is trying to push NATO countries to establish a coalition \"that would attempt to intercept Russian missiles\". The proposal has been previously rejected by some members of the military bloc led by the United States.\n\nZelensky said that the Ukrainian government is considering \"technical possibilities for neighboring nations to use military aircraft against missiles that strike Ukraine\".\n\nHe said Western countries are reluctant to do so as they \"are always concerned about possible escalation\" of confrontation with Russia, but Ukraine will work on it.\n\nThe report said that Ukraine \"has long been pressuring its Western backers\" to play a more active role in the conflict with Russia, especially in intercepting Russian drones and missiles in Ukrainian airspace, but Western countries are cautious about this, as they try to avoid direct military confrontation with Russia.\n\nZelensky said on Monday that Ukraine has received 3.9 billion U.S. dollars in financial support from the United States, adding that Ukraine is working with Western countries on how to use the frozen Russian assets to provide financial support to Ukraine.\n\nAt the Group of Seven Summit held in June this year, the participants reached a deal on using the interest of the 300-billion-U.S. dollar frozen Russian assets to finance around 50 billion U.S. dollars of loan for Ukraine.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin condemned the measure as \"theft\" and vowed that it would not go unpunished.\n\nThe EU announced on July 26 that it had transferred 1.5 billion euros in proceeds from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine's defense ministry and the country's reconstruction.\n\nIn response, Russia has condemned the EU's decision as illegal.\n\n\"This is certainly a reason for thoughtful actions in response to such illegal decisions that are being implemented by the European Union,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, warning that the move will not go unanswered.\n\nRussia on Tuesday said its forces had thwarted Ukrainian armyâs attack on its Kursk Oblast, while Ukraine reported that it continued to engage in battles with the Russian army in various directions.\n\nIn a daily report release on Tuesday, the Russian Ministry of Defense said that the Russian army occupied more advantageous positions on the frontline and seized a settlement.\n\nThe Russian army hit various Ukrainian targets, including radars, ammunition depots and electronic warfare base stations, according to the report.\n\nThe report said that the Russian air defense system shot down a MiG-29 fighter of the Ukrainian army and intercepted several of its rockets and drones.\n\nThe Russian army has also thwarted Ukraine's attack on its Kursk Oblast and repelled it.
