        "text": "What is an aspect ratio, and how is it different from your image resolution? There’s so many different ratios to calculate, so how do you know which one is best for your photography? In this guide, we’ll show you the most common aspect ratios in Photography and break down the rules on when to use each aspect ratio.\n\nMost photographers have a general idea of what we’re talking about when we discuss “aspect ratio,” but would be hard-put to define it in their own words. “It’s to do with the size of the image,” is what most people finally settle on. Well today we’re going to go in-depth about this term, so the next time you hear aspect ratio being discussed you can jump right in! (Hint: it’s not so much about size as it is about shape.)\n\nWhat Exactly Is It, Though?\n\nFor any given photo, aspect ratio describes the proportional relationship between your image’s width and height. You can find aspect ratios that are commonly used in photography and film in many of the objects in the world around you. In fact, you needn’t look further than your TV screen (or computer) to find examples:\n\nYour old-school TV/computer display has a 1.33:1 aspect ratio (almost a square).\n\nA ratio like this means the image on the screen may be smaller than it was originally, or the edges have been cut off so the image can fit onto your screen.\n\nYour TV (for example, those equipped with HDTV) has an aspect ratio of 16:9 (this is a widescreen format, where the width is just about twice as long as the height).\n\nThis type of ratio captures the effects of high definition technology to their fullest.\n\nYour local in-theater or home movie theaters typically have an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (widescreen CinemaScope format).\n\nThis ratio is specially designed to help you become immersed in the show.\n\nAs you read through these examples, you may have realized that ratios can completely transform the viewing experience of your photos. So you can probably see why it’s talked about so often, because it’s important stuff for you to understand! Now that you know what a few ratios look like (keep them filed away as reference points for when you do your own shooting), let’s talk more about what you need to know to make use of them as a photographer.\n\nLet’s Write Ratios!\n\nYou’ll want to know the correct way to write an aspect ratio, since putting even one number in the wrong place can really bungle things up. First of all, an aspect ratio starts with the number associated with the width, separated by a colon from the number associated with the height, like so:\n\nx:y (the width always comes first)\n\nThe x:y is an expression of a ratio, so you will encounter different sizes of photographs that use the same ratio. For instance, if you shoot a 6 x 4″ photo, you’ve just captured an image with a ratio of 3:2. If you shoot an image of roughly 8 x 5.3″, you’ve still captured an image with the same ratio of 3:2.\n\nSo when it comes down to it, aspect ratio doesn’t really have that much to do with the size of your image at all.\n\nThe ratio is directly determined by the size of your camera sensor, but most of the newer DSLRs allow you to change the aspect ratio. The following graphic illustrates how you can change the aspect ratio within the limited size of a particular sensor below:\n\nWhy Is Aspect Ratio Important?\n\n1. For Technical Reasons\n\nYou’re going to need to understand aspect ratios when you’re posting your photographs online.\n\nFor instance, the aspect ratio of your Facebook profile pic will be different when you’re viewing it on a medium like your phone, as opposed to viewing it on your laptop. Because of this, the various social networking platforms or website builders will force you to fit your photos within standard aspect ratios. If you don’t want your profile pic distorted, stretched, or cut off, you’re going to want to match the ratio of your profile pic to their standard aspect ratio (see our section on social media below for a list of aspect ratios a few social networking sites prefer).\n\nThe same idea applies if you’re going to be printing your photos. If your aspect ratio doesn’t match the size of your print, you may end up with a cropped or stretched photo.\n\nPro Tip\n\nIf you’re planning on printing your photos, you’ll need to know which ratios are required for common print sizes:\n\n6 x 4” = 1.5:1 ratio\n\n7 x 5” = 1.4:1 ratio\n\n10 x 8” = 1.25:1 ratio\n\n11 x 8.5” = 1.29:1 ratio\n\n2. For Aesthetic Reasons\n\nChanging the ratio will impact where your subject is positioned in relation to the sides of the frame. If you have an important feature positioned near an edge, you could lose it altogether with the wrong ratio.\n\nYour aspect ratio can be used to convey emotion. For example, a ratio of 2:35 allows for negative space within a photograph. You can use this space to create an expansive quality in your landscape or evoke feelings of loneliness and isolation in your portrait.\n\nChanging your aspect ratio may also help if you feel you have some extra “room” in your photo (this often applies more to vertical images). A vertical image may be too roomy at a ratio of 2:3, while a ratio of 4:5 could give the photo a snugger frame, resulting in a more appealing composition.\n\nRatio Problems to Avoid\n\nIf you shot according to the rule of thirds using a 4:3 ratio, and then needed to create prints with a 3:2 ratio, the composition of the shot may not adhere to the rule of thirds anymore.\n\nYou may see a large dip in quality when attempting to shoot a ratio that’s larger than the ratio of your camera’s sensor:\n\nIf your sensor’s ratio is 4:3 (a micro four-thirds camera), your best bet is to shoot in 4:3 or 1:1. If you try to shoot in 3:2 or 16:9 with this sensor, you may end up having to crop your photo substantially (which will mean a drop in image quality).\n\nTo avoid this issue, you may want to consider purchasing a camera with a larger sensor size. Buying a camera with a larger sensor will not only give you more options for ratios but comes with other benefits as well (including better low-light photos, increased dynamic range, and more background blur).\n\nIn the next few sections, we’ll dig deeper into aspect ratios and discuss:\n\nWhether you should make ratio adjustments before you shoot – or shoot first, then adjust your ratio later\n\nHow the ratios available on your camera will impact your shots\n\nCommon and not-so-common ratios and where you might use them\n\nWhich ratios to use for social networking apps and websites\n\nThe Golden Ratio (another composition method to put in your toolbox)\n\nFilm preferences (because cinematographers also keep a keen eye on their aspect ratios)\n\nPerfecting proportion in your post-processing (tips and tricks to keep your image high quality)\n\nDeciding on the Aspect Ratio Before Shooting vs. Cropping in Photoshop\n\nThere was a time when DSLRs weren’t even capable of allowing users to change aspect ratios while shooting. Back then, the dimensions of your camera’s sensor (or the film type, along with the camera’s design) would dictate the ratio. For example, a sensor that’s 1.5 times as wide as it is high produces a ratio of 3:2. A 35mm crop sensor, full-frame SLRs, and most 35mm film cameras produce this ratio.\n\nNow, thankfully, you can choose whether to change the ratio while out in the field or crop your photos in post-processing.\n\nIf you choose your ratio before shooting, you will have the advantage of being able to literally visualize what your image will look like after it’s been cropped. You will be able to see the cropped image either on an electronic viewfinder or on your camera’s LCD screen in Live View mode.\n\nThere is one drawback to choosing the ratio while shooting: if you choose to shoot your photos in JPEG, your camera will crop your image. There is no way to retrieve the parts of the photo that were cropped. (Psst… you can solve this problem by shooting in RAW mode.)\n\nIf you can’t change your camera’s aspect ratio, post-production may be the only way you can crop your photos. And even if your camera does have that capability, many find cropping to just be easier. It also allows for more flexibility, as you can create multiple versions of an image from a more generous starting point without “losing” the information for good.\n\nPro Tip\n\nIt’s easy to change the aspect ratio on your smartphone, too. The iPhone is capable of taking photos in 1:1 (square), 16:9 (panoramic, which is best for video), and the default mode, 4:3.\n\nIn the Photos app, you can also crop your image anywhere from 1:1 to 9:16 (remember that the ratio is always width:height, so some of these will work best in portrait mode and others in landscape).\n\nTo find the aspect ratio options on an iPhone image, you simply:\n\nSelect your photo.\n\nClick on Edit in the top right corner.\n\nSelect the Crop button (to the right of Cancel).\n\nThen, hit the Ratio button (above Done).\n\nSelect a ratio from the menu, and the new ratio will be applied.\n\nExamples of Aspect Ratios\n\nThere are a handful of standard ratios that will be more widely accepted. When you’re sharing your work across lots of platforms, it’s sometimes helpful to know exactly what your image is going to do when it’s viewed by your audience, so that’s a point in favor of “tried and true” ratios.\n\nHowever, it’s entirely too easy to get stuck in a rut and use the same aspect ratio for everything. Choosing the safest bet every time will seriously cut down on your potential for variety, and it’s not so great for creativity as well. Photographers, as artists, should spend a lot of time thinking outside the box… no matter what shape it is.\n\nHere are some examples of what you can do with different ratios:\n\n4:3\n\nA 4:3 ratio is compatible with printed 5 x 7” or 8 x 10” photos. Landscape photography often works well in this type of format, since it’s wider than it is tall. As you can see below, your eye has a lot of room to travel across the scenery.\n\nPro Tip\n\nCommonly-Used Aspect Ratios\n\nCameras often come equipped with ratios of 3:2, 4:3, 16:9, and 1:1. 16:9 tends to be the default mode for shooting videos, while 1:1 is perfect for capturing square photos for Instagram.\n\nBest Ratios for Online & Social Media Viewing\n\nSocial media has its own set of rules – and each platform will have its own criteria. If you mismatch the aspect ratio of your photo to the one your social networking platform specifies, your image may end up stretched, distorted or cut off. For an idea of what different platforms require, see the figures below (as of 2019).\n\nFacebook\n\nProfile Pic: 180 x 180px (1:1 ratio)\n\nCover Image: 820 x 312px (2.63:1 ratio)\n\nShared Link: 1200 x 628px (1.9:1 ratio)\n\nTwitter\n\nProfile Pic: 400 x 400px (1:1 ratio)\n\nHeader Photo: 1500 x 500px (3:1 ratio)\n\nInstagram\n\nProfile Pic: 110 x 110px (1:1 ratio)\n\nPhoto Size (what the user sees when scrolling through their feed): 1080 x 1080px (1:1 ratio)\n\nPro Tip\n\nWhat are pixels?\n\nEvery photo is made up of pixels. They are the smallest unit in your photos, can be round or square, and each one of them contains a color. The greater the number of pixels, the more detailed – and more true-to-life – your photo will be.\n\nThe number of pixels is referred to by some as the resolution. The number of pixels can also be used to express the width and height of your photo. For instance, in a resolution of 2400 x 3000, there are 2400 pixels from the left to right (ie. width) and 3000 pixels from top to bottom (ie. height).\n\nThe Golden Ratio\n\nWe’ve already discussed how changing your ratio will have an impact on your composition. The golden ratio is also a tool used to help with composition (like the rule of thirds).\n\nLeonardo Fibonacci was the first to note the power of the golden ratio in 1200 AD. Fibonacci saw the golden ratio appear again and again in nature, and he noticed how attracted the human eye was to it. This ubiquitous ratio is 1:1.618.\n\nYou could make use of this ratio by constructing a grid as you do when using the rule of thirds. However, with this type of grid, the ratio from the top of your picture to the first line will be 1, the ratio from that first line to the second line will be 1.618, and the ratio from that second line to the bottom of your photo will be 1.\n\nOr you could use the golden ratio using curved lines that also follow the ratio of 1:1.618, like the following:\n\nUsing the golden ratio, you can place parts of your image on a curved line, leading the viewer of your image to the part of your overlay that looks like a coil, where you have placed your point of interest, as in this example:\n\nFilm Preferences\n\nCinematographers are no strangers to aspect ratios.\n\nWhen films were first projected using a perforated film strip, the ratio on the screen was 4:3 (or 1.33:1). When producers started to add sound to movies, the film strip grew a bit too large to accommodate for this audio information, and the ratio became 1.37:1. After this ratio gained approval from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science in 1932, it became the “Academy Ratio.”\n\nIn the 1950s, TV was becoming popular, and it was starting to look like it might compete with movie theaters for viewers. This prompted the theaters to introduce films with a 2.59:1 ratio. Notably, MGM pulled off a ratio of 2.76:1 (which you may have seen in Ben-Hur).\n\nRatios like these posed a problem when viewers tried to watch films like Ben-Hur on their home TV screens. The ratios didn’t fit the typical 4:3 ratio of a home television, so viewers had to contend with viewing their favorite movies with imposing black bars at the top and bottom of their screens (ie. letterboxing). Here’s a clip so you can see what we mean.\n\nToday, most films are seen in 1.85:1 and 2.39:1. In some cases, filmmakers have changed ratios mid-movie. For instance, in The Grand Budapest Hotel, the prologue and epilogue are shot in 1.85:1, in 2.35:1 for the 1960s portions, and in the 1.37:1 ratio for the main sections of the film.\n\nPro Tip\n\nInterested in creating images that harken back to the days of watching Ben-Hur on a home television set? Check out this two-minute video from PHLEARN to find out how to give your image a cinematic look, complete with black cinematic bars, which will reduce your aspect ratio to 16:9.\n\nPost-Production\n\nSteps for changing the aspect ratio in Photoshop (Example image by quangle on Pixabay):\n\nChoose the Rectangular Marquee tool (top left).\n\nSelect Fixed Ratio from the Style list.\n\nSet the width and height of your desired ratio (but don’t choose measurements).\n\nChoose the portion of the image you want to keep.\n\nClick on Image in the dropdown menu, and then select Crop.\n\nIf you only have the width and height in pixels, an aspect ratio calculator will come in handy.\n\nPro Tip\n\nNeed to crop to a certain paper size in Photoshop?\n\nJust enter the size of your print as the ratio in the width and height boxes, just as you did in the example above (for example, 8.5:11).\n\nThe Current State of the Aspect Ratio\n\nEven now, when so many decisions can be made for us with a click of a button on the DSLR, aspect ratios are not something to take for granted. Consider the impact social media has had on the aspect ratio:\n\nCatering to smartphone users, Instagram popularized the square format. Although a 1:1 ratio would cut details out of, say, a 16:9 ratio substantially, a 1:1 photo or video can look a lot more attractive when framed by your cell phone.\n\nThis 1:1 ratio has also appeared on Facebook. More than 90 percent of Facebook’s monthly users (1.74 billion people) look at Facebook on their mobile phone. And 60 percent of those users only access their accounts from their phones. So as you can see, our increasingly mobile lifestyles dictate a lot about aspect ratio use on the internet.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nFirst, you should continue to pay attention to the ratios online technology requires. Second, you shouldn’t be afraid to experiment with uncommon aspect ratios. If those sound contradictory, welcome to aspect ratios! To get the best results without confining yourself to one or two ultra-basic choices, remember:\n\nPreview images before publishing whenever possible.\n\nKeep a copy of the original aspect ratio and save cropped versions separately.\n\nFor cover images and profile photos, look for the option to shift your image around or zoom in and out. You might not have to go back to the drawing board if it doesn’t look exactly right.\n\nMost of all, have fun with it. Aspect ratios offer a lot of potential for creativity now that you understand them. Go out and try something new today!"
