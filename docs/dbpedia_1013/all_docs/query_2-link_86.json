        "text": "Russia: Moscow Court Sentences Ukrainian TV Presenter Natalia Moseychuk to 5 Years in Absentia\n\nWPF demands the Kremlin stops its transnational repression tactics targeting journalists beyond its borders\n\nLocation: Russia, Moscow Date: July 31, 2024\n\nWomen Press Freedom condemns the sentencing of Ukrainian TV presenter Natalia Moseychuk to five years in prison by a Moscow court, in yet another transnational repression attack on press freedom. Moseychuk was convicted of inciting hatred for comments made on a Ukrainian television channel in 2022. This marks the second time Russia has targeted a Ukrainian woman journalist on similar charges despite their work being conducted within Ukraine. Moseychuk has also been added to the Kremlin’s wanted list. The cynical practice of charging journalists in absentia to exert control over them must end. WPF has documented 45 cases of transnational repression against women journalists so far this year, with 36 of these cases perpetrated by Russia. We denounce this ongoing persecution of critical journalists and demand that all charges against Moseychuk be dropped.\n\nRead latest reports from the globe\n\nOn July 31, 2024, the Basmanny District Court of Moscow sentenced Ukrainian journalist Natalia Moseychuk in absentia to five years in prison on charges of incitement of hatred or enmity.\n\nThe charges stem from her address to the wives of Russian military personnel during a broadcast on the Ukrainian 1+1 TV channel on March 20, 2022. Russian pro-war bloggers amplified the broadcast, which was used as evidence in the case against her.\n\n\"It seems to me that you should be afraid,” Moseychuk reportedly said. “You should be afraid that sooner or later our revenge will find you. You should be afraid that sooner or later you, wives, will become widows, and your children will be left orphans. Because the revenge of the Ukrainian people will find you both in the resorts of Egypt and in the resorts of Turkey, where you will fly with money earned on the blood of Ukraine.\"\n\nThe investigation against Moseychuk began in July last year, and her trial in absentia started in early May. Moseychuk, along with fellow Ukrainian TV presenter Yanina Sokolova, who faces similar accusations from Russia, was added to the Russian government's list of \"terrorists and extremists\" by Rosfinmonitoring in May 2023.\n\nRussia has intensified its prosecution of Ukrainian journalists recently. On July 26, 2024, a Russian court sentenced Ukrainian journalist Fakhrudin Sharafmal in absentia to seven years in prison. Sharafmal was convicted of inciting hatred, rehabilitating Nazism, and calling for extremism after publicly calling for the killing of Russians, including children, on Ukrainian Channel 24 in March 2022. This sentencing follows a similar case where Ukrainian journalist Dmitry Gordon was sentenced in absentia to 14 years on terrorism charges and spreading “fake” information about the Russian military on July 1, 2024.\n\nThe sentencing of Natalia Moseychuk is yet another example of the Kremlin's aggressive transnational repression tactics, which extend far beyond Russia's borders and serve as a warning to journalists everywhere. By targeting journalists like Moseychuk, who operate within their own countries but criticize Russian policies, Moscow seeks to silence dissent and stifle free expression across national lines. This trend not only undermines the fundamental principles of press freedom but also erodes the safety and security of journalists globally.\n\nWomen Press Freedom urges the international community to condemn these actions and calls for a united stance against the Kremlin’s efforts to criminalize journalism. We demand that all charges against Natalia Moseychuk and other persecuted journalists be dropped immediately, and we call on governments and press freedom organizations to take decisive action to protect journalists from such transnational threats.\n\nWomen Press Freedom is an initiative by The Coalition For Women In Journalism\n\nThe Coalition For Women In Journalism is a global organization of support for women journalists. The CFWIJ pioneered mentorship for mid-career women journalists across several countries around the world and is the first organization to focus on the status of free press for women journalists. We thoroughly document cases of any form of abuse against women in any part of the globe. Our system of individuals and organizations brings together the experience and mentorship necessary to help female career journalists navigate the industry. Our goal is to help develop a strong mechanism where women journalists can work safely and thrive.\n\nIf you have been harassed or abused in any way, and please report the incident by using the following form."
