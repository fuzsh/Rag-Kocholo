        "text": "Learn about the different TV display formats. HDTVs are wider than standard-definition TVs (SDTV). If your television is an HD TV, standard definition content will not properly fit your entire television screen, and will instead be stretched or alternatively display black bars on either side of the image to compensate.\n\nBelow you will find a list of the different formats that your Digital Box can be set to display. The availability of these formats is dependent on what equipment you are currently using (Digital Box, Television) to watch TV.\n\n4:3 Aspect Ratio\n\nSDTVs have an aspect ratio of 4:3 (also known as 4x3, 1.33:1, or standard). They are 33 percent wider than they are tall.\n\nExample of 4:3 Aspect Ratio\n\n(Note: If your television is an HD TV, standard definition content will not properly fit your entire television screen, and will instead be stretched or alternatively display black bars on either side of the image to compensate.)\n\n16:9 Aspect Ratio\n\nHDTVs have an aspect ratio of 16:9 (16x9, 1.78:1, or widescreen), They are 78 percent wider than tall. This allows a much wider viewing area to be displayed on the screen and more closely mimics how your eyes actually see the world.\n\nExample of 16:9 Aspect Ratio\n\nLetterbox\n\nLetterbox is where film is displayed at its full width (even on a 16:9 HDTV or a 4:3 SDTV) and has black horizontal bars at the top and bottom of the screen. This process ensures no part of the filmâ€™s image is lost when viewed on any type of television.\n\nExample of Letterbox Aspect Ratio\n\nPan and Scan\n\nSides of the original widescreen image are often cropped off and the focus rests on the centre portion of the frame of the scene. Important visual information towards the sides of the picture can be lost.\n\nExample of Pan and Scan"
