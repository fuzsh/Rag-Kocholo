The story goes that he was cryogenically frozen so that he could be brought back to life once the science had been developed.\n\nThere are variations on this popular myth: you may well have heard the version that it was just his head, rather than his whole body, or that its currently stored under Disneyland’s Pirates of the Caribbean ride.\n\nBut is there any truth to one of Hollywood’s most widely-believed – and persistent – legends? In our latest episode of Debunked, Nicholas Barber separates the fact from the fairy story.\n\nFacebook page or message us on Twitter."
