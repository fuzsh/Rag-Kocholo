        "text": "Just read this: After Walt Disney's death, Roy Disney returned from retirement to take full control of Walt Disney Productions and WED Enterprises. In October 1971, the families of Walt and Roy met in front of Cinderella Castle at the Magic Kingdom to officially open the Walt Disney World Resort.\n\nAfter giving his dedication for Walt Disney World, Roy asked Lillian Disney to join him. As the orchestra played \"When You Wish Upon a Star\", she stepped up to the podium accompanied by Mickey Mouse. He then said, \"Lilly, you knew all of Walt's ideas and hopes as well as anybody; what would Walt think of it [Walt Disney World]?\". \"I think Walt would have approved,\" she replied. Roy died from a cerebral hemorrhage on December 20, 1971, the day he was due to open the Disneyland Christmas parade.\n\nMust say the Disney family is quite interesting:\n\nOn December 16, 2009, Roy O. Disney, who had suffered from stomach cancer for a year, died at Hoag Memorial Hospital in Newport Beach, California. His death occurred 43 years and one day after Walt Disney died, also from cancer. In addition, he died exactly 12 years after his aunt, Lillian Bounds Disney, and 4 days before the 38th anniversary of his father's death. Roy E. Disney's passing came less than a month before what would have been his 80th birthday.[1]\n\nAll had December passings."
