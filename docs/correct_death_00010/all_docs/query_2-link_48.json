        "text": "So he lives until 1986 and is still working on projects up until his death. Same thing happens with Roy, he dies in 1971 still, two months after Disney World opens. But Walt hangs around and works on the company 15 years after this. What happens with Epcot? How vastly different would it be and would it have been more successful? Or less? Is there a chance there is California Adventure sooner than 2001? Is there the foundation for DHS to be built in 1989? And how does the core of the parks change, if any?\n\nBottom line, are things better?\n\nMy personal opinion that when it comes to innovation and imagination it definitely is. When you think of the non-IP attractions at Disney they mostly came from the mind of Walt Disney. In 1964 with the World's Fair he did not look like he was slowing down and brought in three different attractions to the parks that had nothing to do with his movies (Mr. Lincoln, Small World, Carousel of Progress). I would suggest we would see more of this sort of thing. From a business side of things I know how much more money the company would make as that was never his motivation, but I think he would have a lot left in the tank for 20 years to play with.\n\nThere would've a lot of differences.\n\nI don't see the Epcot that opened in 1982 happen since Walt's vision of Epcot was not a theme park. I am saying that because Walt at the time of his death already had a plan Epcot and it was not a theme park to my understanding. That has been common knowledge for decades. I first know about Walt's Vision of Epcot back in 1991 due to a Walt Disney World 20th anniversary special I watched.\n\nWhat Walt wanted with Epcot was Epcot actually being a city in Florida.\n\nI have a link to back Walt wanting Epcot being a city in Florida.\n\nEPCOT Was Walt Disney's Radical Vision for a New Kind of City\n\nEPCOT was Walt Disney's \"Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow.\" But it didn't actually turn out the way he had envisioned it.\n\nI think it very possible that Walt's vision of Epcot would bankrupt the company. Even if didn't, I don't see the Walt Disney Company being as big as player in the theme park industry.\n\nWalt already was going to do Magic Kingdom and that is it for theme parks for Florida despite all that land. The reason is Walt couldn't do his Epcot project without doing a theme park. What would be in Magic Kingdom might've been different due I believe Walt didn't have attractions planned out for Magic Kingdom at the time of his death or not a lot of them.\n\nDisney California Adventure wouldn't happen before Walt died.\n\nWhat I am painting is Florida's tourism would be much different and the theme park industry in Florida. I think Tokyo Disneyland happening with Oriental Land company would be a possibility.\n\nThis is a fascinating subject. Great idea!\n\nI have to agree with the above to a large extent. Things for TWDC would've been incredibly different. From all the documentaries I've seen and articles I've read, Walt was a pretty stubborn guy meaning he would've wanted it his way despite the cost, or whether it was a winning idea. Like others, I think EPCOT would've been a disaster. Since Walt passed, EPCOT was realized as a more practical option... a theme park. As a city, I don't think it would've survived. One of the documentaries I've watched mentions how so many of his trusted advisors tried and tried to talk him out of his vision of a real city, but he wasn't listening.\n\nMK might've been better than it is though. Think about all the rides stuffed into DL and its footprint is much smaller than MK. I think with all the extra land, Walt would've insisted that MK have many more rides than DL. That's just my guess tho. Who knows if we'd have AK or HS. My guess is probably not because EPCOT would've been such a disaster. Sadly, I think Walt's passing probably was the best thing for the Disney company at the time. That said, I think it's far worse now than it should be so who can tell.\n\nThis is a fascinating subject. Great idea!\n\nI have to agree with the above to a large extent.

One of the documentaries I've watched mentions how so many of his trusted advisors tried and tried to talk him out of his vision of a real city, but he wasn't listening.\n\nI’ve often wondered how different our world (not just WDW) would be had Walt lived to open Epcot as originally planned.\n\nMuch of it probably wouldn’t have worked but I suspect it would have changed urban planning as we know it.\n\nPrior to DL opening it was known as “Walt’s folly” and was predicted to fail, instead it ended up changing the theme park business, his “folly” of Epcot could have had the same far reaching consequences. Sadly we’ll never know.\n\nI think you hit the nail on the head here. I think Walt would've tarnished his own legacy. When I think of Walt's passing, all I can think of is this sketch (below) in the paper when he passed. It's immortal and expresses the loss of a legend. Had he stuck around past his prime and through potential failures, he might not have been so beloved. His passing was so sad, although it was before my time.\n\nIn comparison, do any basketball fans fondly remember Jordan's years with the Wizards? I grew up watching MJ, and watched zero games of him in a Wizards uniform. That was horrific. Walt never crossed that line thankfully.\n\nView attachment 704908\n\nInteresting take on Walt and Michael Jordan on the Wizards. If I had to make a comparison, Jordan sinking that final shot in the championship game in 1998 NBA final against the Jazz and then retiring after that was the perfect ending. Sort of like Seinfeld. He went out on top. Walt dying in 1966 easily falls into this category. He was right on top of his career. WDW had broken ground, Disneyland had been going 11 years, there were still great Disney movies well into the 1960s and Disneyland had just added the attractions from the 1964 World's Fair. Stuff like Pirates was finished under his watch. Jungle Cruise was the last movie made under his watch if I recall and it had that Disney touch to it that the other movies since haven't had, certainly not today. Country Bear Jamboree was in its pretty raw stages then but it was an idea under him, as was Haunted Mansion. So he certainly left his mark and it makes you wonder what could have been. Because we know how stagnant the animated feature films got after he died to the point where Roy Disney Jr. had to save it. So in a way seeing Walt die in 1966 is a lot like seeing Cary Grant retire in his prime, even Johnny Carson leaving the Tonight Show at the time he did is a good comparison. Right on top and to this day still peerless.\n\nHere is the thing I am thinking people are underestimating. I myself am skeptical of how Walt's vision of Epcot would be. But one thing Walt never stopped doing was working. He failed at things and crumpled it up and started over. He did this all of the time. I doubt he would have clung to something that was a failure, it wasn't in his nature. I think without Roy it is possible Disney takes a hit financially with Walt not having his brother reign him in with things. But who knows really. He went against the grain all of the time and did the impossible. In 1971 if Magic Kingdom opens up with Epcot it would have been pretty huge, I think. That land that Walt had would be a blessing, something he didn't have with Disneyland. I believe that MK is better utilized. I think it would be unanimously better than Disneyland had Walt oversaw it. Roy did a good job, don't get me wrong, but Walt was the visionary, he would have wanted so much more in there with that extra space. Instead we mostly come to an agreement that Disneyland is still the best theme park ever built. No one has matched it since. So I think underestimating him isn't always the wisest idea because no one has been able to do what he did 57 years after his death.\n\nDisney as it did had some trying times in the 1970s and 1980s. This may have still happened with Walt around, specifically not knowing how Epcot succeeds. But I just can't see how the great theme park innovator of all-time would just give up and not constantly be thinking of new ideas all of the time. And he had more hits than misses, so.............\n\nHere is the thing I am thinking people are underestimating. I myself am skeptical of how Walt's vision of Epcot would be.

But I just can't see how the great theme park innovator of all-time would just give up and not constantly be thinking of new ideas all of the time. And he had more hits than misses, so.............\n\nYep. I pretty much said the same thing. MK would've been a much better park, and likely would've been the far superior park of the two (MK & DL). That was his reason for creating the MK in FL... to make it better. With roughly 60% more land for the park, I have no doubt he would've succeeded at that. If I'm not mistaken his vision of EPCOT included a theme park at the far northwest end of the property, EPCOT being roughly were it ended up being built, but rather than a theme park, EPCOT would've been a town center with a sky, and have been surrounded by supporting lands, housing, farms. Not sure which was the first phase of the project though. I'm not sure if he would've built MK first, or the city. Had he started on the city first, perhaps MK is never built. Who knows, but I do think that the theme park was phase 1.\n\nHe was trying to create his own utopia... a \"Disney World\" you might say. I just don't think it would've ever succeeded, and it more likely would've completely bankrupted him. His vision was admirable, but I think what he was trying to create isn't the type of thing you break ground on and create from the bottom up in a few years. It's something that started small, grows, and then flourishes over decades at least. For a single person (from a funding perspective) to try and create it from scratch in a few years would've been impossible. Just my opinion though.\n\nSo he lives until 1986 and is still working on projects up until his death. Same thing happens with Roy, he dies in 1971 still, two months after Disney World opens. But Walt hangs around and works on the company 15 years after this. What happens with Epcot? How vastly different would it be and would it have been more successful? Or less? Is there a chance there is California Adventure sooner than 2001? Is there the foundation for DHS to be built in 1989?

I would suggest we would see more of this sort of thing. From a business side of things I know how much more money the company would make as that was never his motivation, but I think he would have a lot left in the tank for 20 years to play with.\n\nI want to dream EPCOT would a have been a community of tomorrow and not just a theme park, but I think Walt would have been forsed out of TWDC, a la Steve Jobs.\n\nObviously not everything Walt touched turned to gold early but it reached a point when he had way more successes than failures, and I think he would have eventually pushed harder for stuff that would have been way more difficult to implement. If Walt had continued without Roy I think he would have faced more pushback from eventual Roy replacements, because I think Roy gave Walt a lot more room to run with ideas than a successor would have. I think it may have ended up comparable to Michael Eisner losing Frank Wells.\n\nI want to have faith that things would have still turned out well but I can't shake that I believe Walt would have overspend and eventually been pushed out of his own company with a little less aura to the legacy.\n\nBut Walt also made a career proving people wrong so what do I know?\n\nIf Walt had lived longer and technology hadn't ended the need for companies to support communities to test their creations and to spread the word, it might have worked briefly like Celebration did until people decided that they didn't want to spend that kind of money for what what essentially a do as I say type of community run by a company.\n\nOnce that support would be lost from both industry and the people, there would no longer be a Walt Disney Company. I remember the day he died and how sad everyone seemed to be. He was our childhood and our influence for many years, but EPCOT, the original would have been a failure with way to many possible problems then one person could possibly handle. Plus his expertise was in entertainment and that is where he proved everyone wrong many times, but his strong point was Imagination, with controllable situations like drawing pictures on paper. Providing a free living environment involving people, not so much. I think it is a safe bet to say that I am glad he died with that dream in his head instead of a failure of colossal magnitude and you are not wrong. Disney was on the brink of failure even after the EPCOT we know was established and that is without spending he money that the original would have cost.\n\nHe would have lost passion and interest in the parks and either gave them to someone else to run or they would have stayed the same, EPCOT would have taken all of his time until the mid 70s. It would have been totally different. It would have been a city for the betterment of mankind. They would have worked on propulsion, medicines, cancer research, alzhieimers, tried to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, and huge into computers. World showcase would be neighborhoods where these scientists lived. The only theme park aspect would have been a tram ride kind of thing taking you around the park, and tours that you could see the scientists working (elevated behind glass as to not bother them), and big led scrolling boards about all of their latest discoveries (CANCER CURED TODAY, COMPUTING POWER DOUBLED).\n\nIt would have failed as a theme park and closed off to the public eventually. But the research would have put us 5-10 years ahead of where we are if not more. Scientists would flock from all over the world to work together here, without the bureocracy and access to huge grants, and the best equipment possible. Companies pay for it after that in return for the technology and new drugs.\n\nWalt early 80s loses complete interest in it after about 3 years of completion and moves on to something else. Lillian is alive till 1997 so maybe he retires and sees the country, but he probably would do something totally outside of what we would expect. He would have had nothing to do with animation or movies since 1970 at the latest. Theme parks as soon as the magic kingdom opens. Walt liked to dream, so who knows what those dreams would have lead to next.\n\nIn my perfect world he would have set up his will for all of his money and the profits of Disney (maybe sold maybe not) to go to Epcots furthering research. Kind of like Howard Hughes (although Hughes wasnt done on purpose)"
