        "text": "The death of Walt Disney permeates the second episode of “The Imagineering Story” like a black cloud that hovers over virtually every decision involving the company and its creative arm.\n\nThe second of six parts in the documentary series debuting on the new Disney+ streaming service on Nov. 12 finds Imagineering forebear WED Enterprises encountering dark times and overcoming obstacles at breakneck speed without the guidance of their founder and leader.\n\nSign up for our Park Life newsletter and find out what’s new and interesting every week at Southern California’s theme parks. Subscribe here.\n\nThe second episode of “The Imagineering Story” is aptly named: “What Would Walt Do?”\n\n“What Would Walt Do?” is both the mantra that guides the Imagineers after Walt Disney’s death and all-too-often freezes their decision-making abilities as they hurtle headlong into some of the biggest challenges yet to face the company.\n\nThe docuseries offers a rare behind-the-scenes look at Disney’s secretive creative studio and features interviews with Imagineers Bob Gurr, Alice Davis, Rolly Crump, Tony Baxter, Joe Rohde and many others.\n\nThe documentary takes viewers on a six-decade journey as WED Enterprises creates Disneyland and every Disney theme park in Florida, Tokyo, Paris, Hong Kong and Shanghai.\n\nReview: ‘The Imagineering Story’ takes a no-holds-barred look at Disneyland’s birth and youth\n\nThe second episode picks up after Walt Disney’s untimely death in late 1966 and follows Imagineering’s tumultuous journey through its 1970s theme park building boom and into the mid-80s when all appears lost.\n\nThe opening scenes of the second episode offer rare glimpses at the projection mapping technology behind Madame Leota’s crystal ball and the pepper’s ghost illusion in the ballroom of Disneyland’s Haunted Mansion.\n\nBut the episode soon shifts to Florida and what Imagineering cryptically refers to as Project X, the secret code-name for Disney World. The biggest issue: How to build a theme park on swamp land?\n\n“A lot of people won’t take the worry of running a place,” Roy O. Disney says in the documentary. “It is a lot of worry. You don’t work 40 hours a week. You work 40 and worry 40. It goes on that way. Why in the world should we go on with the Florida project now? We’re doing it for the next generation.”\n\nQ&A: Go behind the scenes with ‘The Imagineering Story’ documentary filmmaker Leslie Iwerks\n\nThe coolest moment in the second episode of “The Imagineering Story” takes viewers beneath the Magic Kingdom through the “utilidors” forming a 10-acre labyrinth beneath the park. The “underground city” bustles with golf carts, forklifts and 15,000 cast members each day. Pipes lining the utilidors carry everything from water to heat to electricity. There are even pneumatic trash tubes for the odorless removal of Disney World garbage.\n\nA visit to the Mapo building at Imagineering — named for the Mary Poppins revenues that funded the complex — offers a quick peek inside the audio-animatronic factory that outfitted many Disney World attractions.\n\n“Everything was custom made and custom designed,” Imagineer Frank Stanek says in the documentary. “Audio-animatronics at the time were like building a one-time Formula One race car.”\n\nInside an Imagineering studio, the sculpted heads of every United States president through Richard Nixon get their finishing touches before heading to Liberty Square, the only new land created for the Florida’s super-sized version of Disneyland.\n\nJust like Disneyland, construction crews race to complete the Magic Kingdom in time for the 1971 opening day. Helicopters are brought in to dry the concrete in Fantasyland in time for the first visitors.\n\nAnd just like Disneyland, the Magic Kingdom’s debut is disastrous. Disney officials expect 500,000 people. Only 10,000 show up. The place is instantly billed a failure.\n\n“We found out later people were staying away because they thought it was going to be so crowded,” former WED treasurer Carl Bongirno says in the documentary.\n\nDespite the shaky starts, Disney’s theme park successes encourage upstarts like Busch Gardens Tampa, Six Flags Over Texas, Pennsylvania’s Dutch Wonderland and other “cheaper knockoffs” to attempt to snag a share of the regional market.\n\nBack on the West Coast, Imagineering feels threatened by the thrill rides and roller coasters popping up at Knott’s Berry Farm and Magic Mountain. By the mid-1970s, Disneyland is getting a reputation as a kiddie park with nothing for teenagers to do. Imagineering’s response: Space Mountain.\n\n“We basically needed to examine again and say, ‘OK, is it time for us to catch up and go beyond what the competition is doing?’” Imagineer Tom Morris says in the documentary.\n\nSEE ALSO: Can you name all 15 E-ticket rides still at Disneyland? It’s not as easy as you think\n\nAs the 1980s dawn, Imagineering does the only thing it knows how to do: Press forward at breakneck speed. The company decides to build two theme parks on opposite sides of the world at virtually the same time. Epcot will be a Disneyland for adults with never-before-seen touch screens, robots, fiber optics and lasers. Tokyo Disneyland will be Disney’s first international park after the Japanese repeatedly beg Disney CEO Card Walker to build it.\n\n“”Card got them on the phone and he gave them all these ridiculous demands,” Bongirno says in the documentary. “And they said, ‘OK, let’s go.’ Card’s jaw dropped and he said, ‘We’ve got a project.’”\n\nBut after a steady run with Disneyland, Magic Kingdom, Epcot and Tokyo Disneyland, Imagineering soon finds itself with nothing in the pipeline.\n\n“The Disney board of directors took a look at WED Enterprises at the time and said, ‘You know what? This company doesn’t make any money. They just spend money,’” Imagineer Kevin Rafferty says in the documentary.\n\nThe result is massive layoffs at WED Enterprises that deplete the workforce from 3,000 to 400. The fear is WED will soon close or be folded into Disney’s movie studio. In 1983, a corporate raider threatens a hostile takeover of Disney that would have broken the company up into separate pieces.\n\nThe second episode of “The Imagineering Story” ends on a cliffhanger: After Walt Disney’s death, what will happen to WED and the company?"
