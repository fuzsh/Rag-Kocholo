        "text": "Disney is in the business of creating and selling wholesome entertainment to children and adults alike. It’s a strategy that has made the firm one of the world’s largest and most profitable media enterprises.\n\nImagine a world without Mickey Mouse or Sleeping Beauty or even the Lion King, a world in which Walt Disney was not part of life. A world without the Magic Kingdom, whimsy cartoons, and sceneries. Walt Disney has transformed the lives of millions of children by pioneering innovative ways of delivering animation, entertainment, and technology.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company, or Disney as it is commonly known, is today one of the largest media conglomerates in the world. In just 84 years, from its founding in 1923, Disney has morphed from a small cartoon studio into one of the most influential corporations in the world. Today, the Walt Disney Company owns eleven theme parks, two water parks, and several television networks, including the American Broadcasting Company (ABC).\n\nWell-known for pioneering entertainment directed to adults and children alike, Disney’s success can be attributed to its ability to adapt to changing socio-cultural trends. In the 1930s, Disney was big in sound and, in the 1980s, in television. The company’s top management has always kept a finger on America’s pulse.\n\nThe co-founder of Disney, Walter Elias Disney, was a great visionary. From the beginning, he searched for ways to make Disney innovative and different from other companies. It was Walter Disney’s ambition to give his audience the very best, so the execution of his pioneering ideas was never left to chance.\n\nDream, Believe, Dare, Do: that was the motto of Walter Elias Disney. He was born on December 5, 1901, in Chicago, Illinois. When he was five, Walt’s family moved to Marceline, Missouri. Walt developed interest in drawing and art at an early age. At the age of seven he could be seen selling small sketches and drawings to neighbors. Doodling pictures of animals and nature was his hobby, which later helped him conceive Walt Disney.\n\nIn 1918, just back from his stint with the Red Cross army, Walt moved to Kansas City, where he worked at the Pesemen-Rubin Art Studio. At Pesemen-Rubin, he produced ads for newspapers and magazines, as well as for movie theatres. The cartoons and ads were quite crude but Walt was sure that he knew what he was doing. Walt met a cartoonist, Ubbe Iwerks, a shy and talented young man, and the two developed a life-long friendship.\n\nIn 1920, Walt and Ubbe left Pesemen-Rubin to form their own company, Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists. However, few clients wished to risk hiring an untested pair, so finally Ubbe left and Walt soon followed. Not one to lose heart, knowing that he was on the right path, Walt started a small company called Laugh-O-Grams in 1922. Through this company he concentrated on selling short animated films to local companies. The Alice Comedies, about a real girl and her adventures in an animated world, was on Walt’s mind during this time. But Walt ran out of money, and Laugh-O-Grams went bankrupt. Instead of giving up, Walt packed his suitcase with his unfinished print of The Alice Comedies, and headed for Hollywood, the city of dreams, to start a new business.\n\nArriving in Hollywood with just $40 and an unfinished cartoon would have dampened anyone’s spirits. But even at young age of 22, Walt knew his dreams would be fulfilled with his vast reservoirs of drive and determination. Walt set up his first studio shop in his uncle Robert’s garage, and Roy, his brother, soon joined him. On October 16, 1923, a New York distributor, M.J. Winkler, contracted to release The Alice Comedies, and that was the formal beginning of The Walt Disney Company.\n\nOriginally known as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, with Walt Disney and his brother Roy as equal partners, the company soon changed its name to the Walt Disney Studio. It was initially located at various places in Hollywood before the brothers settled on Hyperion Avenue Ubbe rejoined Walt in 1924 and the pair, along with Walt’s distributor, Charles Mintz, went on to develop a new cartoon about a rabbit named Oswald. Within a year, Walt made 26 Oswald cartoons. Later, due to a dispute between Mintz and Walt, Mintz separated, claiming the ownership of the cartoon rabbit. Mitz went on to hire many of Walt’s animators and designers to work for him. It was a painful lesson for Walt. In the future, he would ensure that he owned everything that he made.\n\nWalt was in trouble. He had to come up with a new character – and fast. With Ubbe, Walt designed a mouse, wanting to name him Mortimer, but his wife Lilly preferred the name Mickey. And so, in 1928, a star was born.\n\nTHE MOUSE THAT RULES\n\nWalt said of Mickey: “Born of necessity, the little fellow literally freed us of immediate worry. He provided the means for expanding our organization to its present dimensions and for extending the medium cartoon animation towards new entertainment levels. He spelled production liberation for us.”\n\nMickey was an instant success and soon starred in two films. As soon as the first film with synchronized sound, The Jazz Singer, had premiered, Walt knew that sound was here to stay and took a vital decision to make the first sound cartoon. On November 18, 1928, Mickey starred in his first film with sound. It was an immediate sensation around the world, and a series of Mickey Mouse cartoons followed.\n\nNot the sort of entrepreneur to rest on past triumphs, Walt Disney followed up his early success with the Silly Symphonies. Walt’s ambition was unequivocal: to perfect the art of animation. Technicolor was used for the first time in animation during the production of Silly Symphonies. Walt Disney held the patent for Technicolor for two years, allowing him to make the only color cartoons. Soon, in 1932, Flowers and Trees won Walt his first Academy Award.\n\nFor quite some time Disney cartoons won the Oscar every year. Disney made an important breakthrough in cartoon animation in 1933 with the Three Little Pigs. Walt said: “Cartoon animation offers a medium of storytelling and visual entertainment which can bring pleasure and information to people of all ages everywhere in the world. Animation can explain whatever the mind of man can conceive. This facility makes it the most versatile and explicit means of communication yet devised for quick mass appreciation.”\n\nAccording to official archival sources at the Walt Disney Company, Walt’s cartoons were gaining popularity and generating interest in related merchandise. As Walt recounted: “A fellow kept hanging around my hotel waving $300 at me and saying that he wanted to put the mouse on paper tablets for school children. As usual, Roy and I needed money, so I took the $300.” This was the start of Disney’s consumer products.\n\nIn 1934, Walt made plans to produce an animated feature-length version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. When the other major movie producers heard of the project, they dubbed it “Disney’s Folly” and were certain that the project would destroy the Disney Studio. Finally on December 21, 1937, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs premiered at the Carthay Theater in Los Angeles. It was a tremendous success and became Disney’s highest grossing film of all time. It was a record this film held until Gone with the Wind. Even today the film is considered one of the great feats and imperishable monuments of the motion picture industry.\n\nWalt said: “Courage is the main quality of leadership, in my opinion, no matter where it is exercised. Usually it implies some risk – especially in new undertakings. Courage to initiate something and to keep it going – pioneering and adventurous spirit to blaze new ways, often, in our land of opportunity.”\n\nWith the advent of World War II, the company lost access to most of its foreign markets and its next two features, Pinocchio and Fantasia, released in 1940, were a loss. All this was soon followed by Dumbo in 1941, and then Bambi. By the late-1940s, Walt continued to produce full-length features Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan, and later Cinderella. The studio also began a series of live-action nature films, entitled true-life adventures, in 1948 with On Seal Island.\n\nCHANGING SOCIAL TRENDS\n\nThe baby boom hit the US during 1946-1964. It was a defining societal phenomena in American history. Walt knew this was his chance to make a ifference. In 1954, he started producing weekly programs for ABC TV in return for their support of the Disneyland project. It was Walt’s dream to open a clean and organized amusement park. He felt that it was time to try something new. As a father he realized that he would take his daughters for outings but end-up sitting on the bench while children played. He felt that there should be a place where parents and children could have a good time together.\n\nAfter several years of planning and construction, the new park opened on July 17, 1955. Disneyland was a $17- million magic kingdom, with presidents, kings and queens, and royalty from all over the world visiting. It became an instant success.\n\nOver the next decade, Disney productions soared to new heights with the production of various movies like Treasure Island, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, The Shaggy Dog and The Parent Trap. It was a time when major changes were occurring in the TV and cinema industry, and Walt knew it was time to revolutionize movies. He produced One Hour in Wonderland in 1950, but it would be another decade before Walt’s movie dreams produced a real classic.\n\nIn 1964, Mary Poppins became a worldwide success and the crowning achievement of the Disney studio. By combining people, animation and computer graphics it told a classic story. Just two years later came the end of an era at Disney Studios. Walt Disney died on December 15, 1966.\n\nAt his death the company’s profits had reached an all-time high. After Walt the company was managed by Walt’s brother, Roy O. Disney. When Roy took over, the major project that Walt had been working on was the Magic Kingdom. Walt had purchased land in Florida to build a theme park that would dwarf even Disneyland. The Magic Kingdom officially opened on October 1, 1971, with a Disneyland-style theme park, hotels, campgrounds, golf courses, shopping villages and a monorail connecting them all.\n\nRoy Disney remarked: “Walt Disney World is tribute to the philosophy and life of Walter Elias Disney… and to the talents, the dedication, and the loyalty of the entire Disney organization that made Walt Disney’s dream come true. May Walt Disney World bring Joy and Inspiration and New Knowledge to all who come to this happy place… a Magic Kingdom where the young at heart of all ages can laugh and play and learn – together.”\n\nFor the next decade, the company was led by a team including Card Walker, Donn Tatum, and Ron Miller. They merged with companies like Arvida which was a land development firm and Gibson Greeting Cards. In an effort to expand its business, Disney launched the Disney TV Channel in 1983. This was a classical case of lateral thinking by the Disney management. It was responding to the changing environment, adapting the company to serve the customer who now wanted home-delivered entertainment on the TV screen. From theme parks to TV – Disney was an enterprise that understood and embraced constant change.\n\nNEW LEADERSHIP\n\nIn 1984, Michael D. Eisner was named chairman and CEO. When Eisner assumed leadership, Disney was in flux. Other Hollywood studios like Paramount and Warner Bros. had taken over the running. Disney’s film library had barely 158 features and its one channel, the Disney Channel, was losing money.\n\nEisner knew that he had his work cut out for him. He recognized immediately how Disney could maximize its assets. He added two more brands, Touchstone Picture and Hollywood Picture, to Disney’s portfolio. Eisner was a firm believer in horizontal hierarchy. He instructed his top management team to strengthen the links between all departments. They were asked to provide support and information and improve coordination among themselves. He started calling them for weekly meetings. He knew that if Disney were to survive he would have to cut through the traditional red-tapism of the organization and get it working together.\n\nEisner made a fundamental decision: Disney would now concentrate on producing movies. Disney had hitherto produced full-length animated movies once every four years or so. Eisner changed all that. He began making a movie every year. But the crisis was still not over. In the mid- 1980s, Disney’s theme parks showed a decline in visitors. No one was able to come up with a reason why. The rides were great, people who visited them left happy and the ticket prices weren’t that high. After a lot of research Eisner discovered the reason: Disney had not been concentrating on advertising and marketing itself in a newly changed and competitive entertainment environment. Disney reacted swiftly. Adapting to this new marketing imperative, it sculpted a strategy of capturing audiences by novel advertising, using popular stars like Michael Jackson and George Lucas.\n\nBy 1986, Disney had scaled new heights and was leading the box-office with Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Good Morning, Vietnam, and Three Men and a Baby. This was soon followed by The Little Mermaid in 1989 and Beauty and the Beast that went on to become the only animated film ever to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. In 1992 and 1994, Aladdin and The Lion King broke all records by grossing more than $200 million and $783 million respectively. These were heady days for Disney.\n\nEisner now turned his attention to Disney’s hotel business. He expanded and set-up hotels such as the Grand Floridian, Yacht and Beach Club Resorts, Boardwalk Inn and Suites Resorts, Caribbean Beach, Dixie Landings and many more. He also purchased the Disneyland Hotel that soon became the company’s flagship on the West coast.\n\nTV meanwhile was booming. All major production houses had a stake in its growth. Eisner saw a great opportunity and grabbed it. By the early-1990s, Disney had hits like Golden Girls, Home Improvement and Ellen. By end-1990, the Disney Channel had five million subscribers. Disney was, true to character, moving with the times, constantly adapting, changing, chiseling away at new markets and opportunities.\n\nNow was the time to target home videos. Eisner packaged the classic hits of Disney and made them available for home viewing. These were an enormous success and generated a profit of over $100 million. Disney established Hollywood Records in 1990 to strengthen its presence in the music industry. It set up a theme park, Euro Disney, near Paris in 1992 and then went on to acquire Miramax Films a year later. Euro Disney lost a billion dollars in the beginning. Disney miscalculated European spending trends when they were in the park. The timing of opening the park coincided with economic slow-down as well.\n\nThis was the golden era for Disney. Its profitability improved, attendance at its theme parks increased. It was producing more movies and re-releasing its old classics. It was adding various hotels to its chain. Disney’s leadership in animation continued as well. It released the successful The Hunchback of Notre Dame in 1996, Hercules in 1997, Mulan in 1998, Tarzan in 1999 and Fantasia in 2000. In 1995, in partnership with Pixar Animation, Disney released the first computer-animated feature film, Toy Story. This was followed by a series of highly successful collaborations, A Bug’s life, Toy Story 2, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo and The Incredibles.\n\nBut that was not the end of acquisitions and partnerships for Disney. In 1996, Disney acquired Capital Cities/ABC. The $19-billion transaction brought the ABC television network to Disney in addition to 10 TV stations, 21 radio stations, seven daily newspapers, and the cable networks A&E, Lifetime, History Channel and the powerhouse sports network, ESPN. All of these moves – from the successful partnership with Pixar for a slew of animation movies to the expansion into television – reflected how proactive Disney’s management was. It saw burgeoning opportunity in the late-1990s in animation and television and ploughed huge resources into building sustainable platforms in these areas. The trick was, again, foresight and insight. Disney had the foresight to capture the emerging trend in filmed animation and the insight to recognize how television would morph into niche areas (the History Channel, for example), providing Disney an opportunity for growth in a tough, competitive market.\n\nIn 2001, Disney expanded its theme parks in Anaheim, opening Downtown Disney and Disney’s California Adventure. The company’s film studio, which had been dominating the box-office, had a tremendous 2003, with Pirates of the Caribbean, The Curse of the Black Pearl and Finding Nemo.\n\nHong Kong Disneyland opened on September 12, 2005. On the occasion, CEO Michael Eisner said: “I remember the first time we stood in this spot. We were on the deck of a boat in the middle of what was then Penny’s Bay, envisioning what could be, what would be, what will be. Six years later, through our dream partnership with Hong Kong government, the creative dream is now a reality. Hong Kong Disneyland stands before us as a living symbol of the creativity and imagination that are the heart and soul of Disney.”\n\nRobert Iger assumed the position of CEO on October 1, 2005, becoming only the seventh individual to lead the company in its entire history. He quickly adapted Disney to rapidly changing new technologies and Disney became the first broadcaster to have its TV shows made available on Apple’s iPod. It also bought the rights to Walt’s original creation, Oswald, the Lucky Rabbit.\n\nDisney merged with Steve Jobs’ Pixar Animation Studios on May 5, 2006. A month later, Disney – now all geared up to change with the new era of digitized entertainment and communication – launched its mobile phone service. Commenting on the deal, Steve Jobs, CEO of Pixar, said, “Disney and Pixar can now collaborate without the barriers that come from two different companies with two different sets of shareholders. Now, everyone can focus on what is most important, creating innovative stories, characters and films that delight millions of people around the world.”\n\nINVENTION BASKET\n\nThe Walt Disney Company today operates as a diversified entertainment enterprise worldwide. It operates in four segments: Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Studio Entertainment, and Consumer Products.\n\nMedia Networks encompass a vast array of properties in television, cable, radio and Internet. It includes ESPN, the Disney Channel, ABC Family, Toon Disney, SOAPnet, Walt Disney Television Animation, Fox Kids International, Lifetime Entertainment Services, A&ETelevision Networks, E! Networks, Buena Vista Television, Buena Vista International Television, Hyperion Books, Walt Disney Internet Group and Disney Mobile. It also includes the ABC Television Network which owns ABC Entertainment, ABC Daytime, ABC News, ABC Sports, ABC Kids and the Disney-owned production company Touchstone Television and many others.\n\nThe Parks and Resorts segment owns and operates the Walt Disney World Resort, which includes Disneyland Resort, and also operates ESPN Zone facilities in the United States, Disneyland Resort Paris in France and Hong Kong Disneyland in Hong Kong. It licenses the operations of the Tokyo Disney Resort in Japan.\n\nThe Studio Entertainment unit is the foundation on which The Walt Disney Company was built, and at its heart are world-renowned animated features and liveaction motion pictures. The unit produces live-action and animated motion pictures for distribution. It includes Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Feature Animation, DisneyToon Studios, Touchstone Pictures, Hollywood Pictures, Miramax Films, Buena Vista International, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Buena Vista Theatrical Productions, Buena Vista Music Group, Walt Disney Records, Buena Vista Records, Hollywood Records, Lyric Street Records and now the renowned computer animation leader Pixar.\n\nThe Consumer Products segment extends the Disney brand to merchandise ranging from apparel, toys, home décor and books to interactive games, foods and beverages, electronics and fine art.\n\nMAGIC KINGDOM…\n\n“If you can dream it, you can do it. Always remember that this whole thing was started with a dream and a mouse.” Famous words from Walt to remember. Disney was the result of one man’s ability to dream big. The best amusement park, or the best children’s movie studio, or the best anything else is just an extension of Disney’s multifarious brands.\n\nWhat made Disney such a success? Was it Walt’s ability to dream big and innovate? Or was it Eisner’s ability to multi-task and generate revenues from new entertainment sources? Or was it perhaps Iger’s uncanny ability to spot an opportunity and merge with Pixar? In a sense, it was all of them put together. Above all, Disney’s success lies in its ability to adapt and move with the times. Its management visualizes and foretells changing socio-cultural trends and dynamics with unerring accuracy.\n\nIt is not easy for any firm to generate new ideas. But for a company to grow and become successful, not only does it have to generate new ideas, it needs to identify and monetize new business opportunities. Disney, which is the personification of an innovative enterprise for the way it approaches new business opportunities, has a voracious appetite for information and everything new. Its executives research, read, travel, talk, listen and observe ceaselessly. Disney then gives its customers exactly what they want.\n\nAs Walt had once said: “I do not make films primarily for children. I make them for the child in all of us, whether we be six or sixty. Call the child innocence. The worst of us is not without innocence, although buried deeply it might be. In my work I try to reach and speak to that innocence, showing it the fun and joy of living; showing it that laughter is healthy; showing it that the human species, although happily ridiculous at times, is still reaching for the stars.”\n\nAs technology changes, all enterprises are forced into a position of constant adjustment. The ability of a firm to change with agility often decides its success. For Disney, technology was an ever-changing factor, from silent, hand-drawn cartoons to animated color and sound movies. Its business landscape has over the years changed tremendously.\n\nBut it has not just been about technology for Disney. It has been about reinventing society. It created a Magic Kingdom that not only children but adults as well could believe in and enjoy. When it introduced movies on Apple I-tunes, it offered a total of 75 films including new titles such as Pirates of the Caribbean and The Curse of the Black Pearl and older classics such as The Incredibles and Cinderella. CEO Iger said: “We are very, very bullish on consumption over electronically delivered media and we’re taking a very optimistic view of technology as a friend, or a great enabler, and not a great predator.”\n\nAny company, big or small, needs to institutionalize innovation. This helps it recognize and exploit changes in its external environment and its internal dynamics. This further enables a company to change its strategies and build products to meet customer needs before less responsive competitors can. Disney is one such company which saw several needs being left unaddressed at different moments in time by its competitors and fulfilled them.\n\nInnovate or die trying seems to have been the motto through Disney’s roller-coaster history. With a huge new youth market out there hungering for entertainment and social networking, future success lies in digital communications and international markets. To play a new leadership role here, Disney must develop new business models to mitigate the risks associated with its older business lines.\n\nMuch of Disney’s success is due to its extraordinary management skills – pioneering branding, farsighted brandstretching and imaginative merchandising. All of these are a classically integral part of an innovative company. In the end, it is the enterprise that understands its priorities, fills a gap in the market, and addresses the emotional needs of its customers that creates a powerful bond which can last forever – as in the Magic Kingdom."
