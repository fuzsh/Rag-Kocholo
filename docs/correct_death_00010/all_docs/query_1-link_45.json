        "text": "This one-story craftsman bungalow is significant as the first home of Walt Disney in Los Angeles and the location of his first local animation work. The house was owned by Disneyâ€™s uncle Robert and Aunt Charlotte, and 21-year-old Walt relocated to Los Angeles in 1923 and began his animation work in the garage while boarding with them at this residence.\n\nWalt achieved his first success with local animation work within months of his arrival to Los Angeles and the creation of his pioneering animation studio, which introduced numerous innovations to the industry. With a career spanning more than four decades, Walt Disney left an indelible impact on the entertainment industry and firmly cemented himself as an icon of twentieth century American culture."
