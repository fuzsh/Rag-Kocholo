        "text": "Him and his brother Roy the co-founded of Walt Disney Productions, which became one of the best and known motion picture production companies in the world. Disney was an innovative animator and created the cartoon character Mickey Mouse. He created these characters for children around the world to watch and enjoy. On February 04, 1937 Walt Disney's first animated featured film was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Which took off and got very popular, everybody was, because he was doing something for\n\nThe history of how The Walt Disney Company came to be started from a small individual who enjoyed drawing and used art as a way to escape reality, his name was Walt Disney. After the World War 1 ended, Disney went to Kansas City where he later created an animated company that went bankruptcy. Walt Disney moved to Hollywood where he met M.J Winkler a distributor, Disney become part of her production partner. (The Walt Disney Company) In 1927 Disney created a series where the distributor copyright the main character and Disney only made a few hundred dollars, therefore Disney decide to leave and created that same series with a different name which was Mickey Mouse. Disney decided to go with his brother Roy and created Mickey Mouse films. When Disney wanted to put out Steamboat Willie many film producers did not like the film’s idea until Pat Powers decided to release the film in theaters. The film gave Disney enough money to start on other projects which later those project turn out to be such as the amusement parks, merchandise, etc. In December 15, 1966 Walt Disney died from Lung Cancer, Disney’s brother Roy made sure that Disney’s believes and philosophy about the company would still be passed on by the company 's employee. (The Walt Disney Company) The company kept going which has become of the greatest companies that are socially responsible and sustainable.\n\nDisney continued to grow, throughout the years with multiple films being created throughout the 1940’s through the 1950’s (\"Disney History,\" n.d.). However, with all the successes that Walt saw he felt the need to branch out and in 1955 Disneyland opened (\"Disney History,\" n.d.). The amusement or theme park, was such a success that Disney opened a second park on October 1, 1971 that we all know as Walt Disney World (\"Disney History,\" n.d.). Disney continued to grow, evolve, and spread to other countries (\"Disney History,\" n.d.). Purchasing Discover magazine in 1991, opening Disneyland Paris in 1992, and in 1994 held the stage production of Beauty and the Beast (\"Disney History,\" n.d.). In short, “Disney is one of the most famous names in the animation industry” (\"The Walt Disney Company,\" 2014, para. 3); from cartoons, movies, theme parks, Broadway productions, merchandise, and books Disney is where it has been since it’s beginning almost 100 years\n\nAfter some time, they found immense success with their character Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, but then discovered that one of their distributors had stolen the rights to Oswald and had taken all of Disney’s animators except for Iwerks. While this left him broke and without a job, Disney didn’t give up and immediately released a new character he had been working on for a while, which was a certain mouse with red pants and a goofy chuckle named Mickey Mouse. After finding major success with his new character, Walt moved on to create the first animated film to have sound and created the first color animated film. He also opened Disneyland in 1956, which today, is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world, despite the many problems that occurred before the opening of the park like a workers strike, the plumbing system breaking the day before the park opened, and the quest to get funding for a park that would cost $17 million to\n\nDisney World and The World of Fabrication Walt Disney first created the brand Disney in October 16,1923, which was called The Disney Brothers Studio. Walt Disney opened Disney Brothers Studio, which turned into the Disney corporation, later on to live a dream he created throughout his parks. Disney World in Florida's grand opening was in October, 1971, where Mickey Mouse led the first official visitor's into the park. By November Disney World was the most talked about attraction in the Western world. Disney World is a tribute to Walter Elias Disney and to the Disney Organization that made Walt Disney’s dream come true.\n\nTo understand how globally profound The Walt Disney Company is, you must see the history behind the multi-billion dollar business. Like most businesses it started out as a small company when brothers Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney created “The Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio” on October 6, 1923. The following January the first Mickey Mouse cartoon strip was formed which would later on be one of its most famous trademarks. In October of 1949, Disney Music was created and six years later on July 17th of 1955, the first Disney Park, Disneyland in Anaheim California, opened its doors. Following this, television show Mickey Mouse Club, and Mary Poppins premiered.\n\nWalt had an early interest in art, he would regularly sell his drawings to neighbors. He then went off to start his art career, by studying art and photography by going to McKinley High School in Chicago. Walt started to love, and acknowledge nature and wild life, family, and community, which were a large part of agrarian living. Even though his dad could be very strict, and there was never really any money, Walt was encouraged by his mom, and older brother Roy to seek after his talent. Walt Disney is a legend; and a hero of the twentieth century. His overall prevalence depended on the standards which his name speaks to: creative energy, confidence, creation, and\n\nSchlosser explained, “The life's work of Walt Disney and Ray Kroc had come full-circle, uniting in perfect synergy. McDonald's began to sell its hamburgers and french fries at Disney's theme parks. The ethos of McDonald and of Disneyland, never far apart, has finally become one. Now you can buy a Happy Meal at the Happiest Place on Earth” (49). It is a major concern for children to eat unhealthy fast food. McDonald’s happy meal cuts down the fat and calories, which can be replace it with healthier option such as an apples. McDonald collaborates up with Disney to target the costumer to be interested with their food.\n\nOn a calm, glass-like lake, there is a moss-filled deck with a rustic picnic table in Minnesota. The birds would be sweetly singing songs to each other. You could smell the fresh, green, grass, filled with dew from the morning mist. Hotdogs would be roasting on the roaring fire. The waves from the lake would gently be grasping the shore. Occasionally, a fish would splash out of the water. An old rustic cabin would be sitting up on the hill, that’s flooded with trees. Chilling lemonade would be cooling off on the table sitting with, smooth, ice white dinner plates, clear glass cups. There would be original silverware, leaf green cloth napkins, and a centerpiece of a mix of white daisies and bell flowers picked from the dense garden. The only\n\nHe soon changed the name to the Walt Disney Studio. Afterward, Walt decided to take a risk and make the first animated movie. The movie was Snow White, a story about a princess whose mother dies, and the step mother attempts to kill her because of her beauty. It was a huge risk Walt took, but it paid off. The eighty-three minute film with over 250,000 drawings had major success. It won a special Academy Award, and Walt was on the cover of Time magazine. Afterwards, Walt decided to take another huge risk. He wanted to make a theme park based on his characters. Roy, Walt’s brother, did not like the idea, but Walt went through with it anyway. Disneyland opened on July 7, 1955, but there were crowds, long lines, rides that did not work, and a tram that led to nowhere. Walt fixed it all, also making his employees go to Disney University, where they learned manners and how to treat the customers right. Walt bought his parents a home in Los Angeles. Sadly, the heating system failed, and his father got sick and his mother died. Walt never stopped blaming himself for her death. A few years later, Walter got lung cancer. He sadly died on December 15, 1966, in Burbank, California. He died at the age of sixty five, and ever got to see Disney World in Florida. Luckily, Walter Elias Disney lived a good"
