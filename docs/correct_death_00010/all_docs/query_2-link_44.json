He avoided smoking when he was in public view, especially where he might be seen by children. His smokers' cough often heralded his arrival in a particular wing of the studio, allowing off-task employees time to get on task.\n\nIn his autobiography, one-time Disney storyboard artist Bill Peet essentially described Walt Disney as a chain-smoking \"work-a-holic\" who was prone to strong mood swings.\n\nHe often called composer Robert B.
