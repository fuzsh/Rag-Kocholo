        "text": "The Disney family moved to this farm in Marceline in 1906. It was on this very land that a young Walt Disney would say he found the magic of his life. Too young to be responsible for any major farm work, Walt and his younger sister Ruth found a deep connection to the magic of this farmland. On this farm, Walt held his first live show, developed his love for nature, and had a special place under his Dreaming Tree. The Dreaming Tree was a large cottonwood on the farm. Walt would often sit under the tree and draw or imagine stories. Years after he moved to California, he used the model of his family’s barn to create his own barn in his backyard. Using these same blueprints, the Disney barn was restored once again in an old fashioned barn raising to celebrate Walt’s 100th birthday. Although the land is privately owned, guests are welcome to visit the barn 365 days a year from sunrise to sunset at no cost. However, the farmhouse is a private residence so we do ask that all guests be respectful. And don’t forget your pen so you can leave your signature or note to Walt in the barn alongside other fans and dreamers.\n\nIn 1960, Walt Disney personally came to dedicate the new elementary school in Marceline. While other elementary schools have been named for Walt, this was the only one he was actively involved with. Walt donated state of the art equipment and textbooks as well as every single Disney educational product available. He also donated custom playground equipment. He asked legendary Disney animator Bob Moore to create murals throughout the school with some of the most famous Disney characters. These murals are regularly restored and are still there today. At the dedication ceremony, Walt presented the school with an orange Mickey Mouse flag that had been flown over his apartment in Disneyland, he also presented the school with a flag pole from the 1960 Winter Olympics, in which he was the chairman of the Pageantry Committee. The flagpole still stands and is engraved telling the Olympic story, but the Mickey flag is now displayed in the Walt Disney Hometown Museum.\n\nIn 1968, the United States Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating Walt Disney (just 2 years after his death). Many cities with connections to Walt were in contention such as Chicago, Kansas City, Burbank and Anaheim, however, it was Marceline that was chosen to be location where these stamps would be issued. Many years later, in 2003, congress officially renamed this location as the Walt Disney Post Office, the only federal building named after Walt.\n\nEP Ripley was the president of the Santa Fe Railroad, as an honor to him, the Santa Fe Railroad built this city park in Marceline. The Disney family visited this park quite often during their time in Marceline. A train locomotive was also donated to the park by the Santa Fe Railroad, in which Walt requested to have Santa Fe & Disneyland Railroad painted on the side. EP Ripley park is also the home to the restored Autopia track in Marceline.\n\nA young Walt Disney remembered this Coca-Cola Wall from his years in Marceline. This mural inspired the Coca-Cola Refreshment Corner at Disneyland. It was also thought to be lost for many years as another building was constructed in front of it after Walt moved away. Many years later, that building burned down revealing the Coke Wall once again. Notice the Hutcheson’s Furniture and Undertaking ad at the top of the mural. Roy once got him and Walt a job at Hutcheson’s cleaning hearses. However, Roy did all of the work and Walt played dead in the coffins all day."
