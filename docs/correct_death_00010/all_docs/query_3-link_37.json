        "text": "Walt Disney was a pioneer in the field of animated, or cartoon, films. He became famous for creating such well-known characters as Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.\n\nWalter Elias Disney was born on December 5, 1901, in Chicago, Illinois. At an early age Walt had a gift for drawing and painting. While attending high school he took art classes to develop these skills. Disney left school to serve as an ambulance driver during World War I.\n\nIn 1923 Disney moved to Hollywood, California. There he began creating the characters that would make him famous. In 1928 he released the short cartoon film Steamboat Willie. It starred a cheerful mouse named Mickey. The next year Disney formed Walt Disney Productions to create more animated films.\n\nOther popular cartoon characters followed. In the 1930s audiences were introduced to Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Pluto, and Goofy. Disney’s first full-length animated film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, was released in 1937.\n\nIn the 1940s Disney’s company began making movies with live actors. Mary Poppins, from 1964, was the most successful of these. Disney also continued making animated features, including such classics as Pinocchio (1940), Cinderella (1950), and Peter Pan (1953).\n\nIn 1955 Disney’s company opened Disneyland, a large theme park in Anaheim, California. Walt Disney World, a second and larger amusement park, opened in Orlando, Florida, in 1971. Disney died on December 15, 1966."
