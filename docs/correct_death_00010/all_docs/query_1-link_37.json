        "text": "Disneyland and Disney World parks are supposed to be some of the happiest places on earth. Families and individuals travel from around the world to attend these grand theme parks. Despite these amusement parks being very family-friendly, that does not always mean they are safe. Unfortunately, incidents happen – from ride malfunctions to accidental drownings – and people do die at Disney parks. This article provides a full list of every reported fatality at a Disney park in the U.S. as well as their lawsuit status, cause of death, and a timeline of incidents. In total, there have been 93 fatalities caused by 90 separate incidents.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nData Analysis: Statistics, Timeline & Tables\n\nFull List of Disneyland Deaths\n\nAmerica Sings/Carousel of Progress Deaths\n\nSpace Mountain Deaths\n\nBig Thunder Mountain Deaths\n\nMatterhorn Deaths\n\nPeopleMover Deaths\n\nMurders & Suicides\n\nFull List of Disney World Deaths\n\nIt’s a Small World Ride Deaths\n\nSpace Mountain Deaths\n\nBig Thunder Mountain Deaths\n\nSuicides\n\nData Analysis: Fatal Incidents at Disney Parks\n\nDisneyland in California and Disney World in Florida are two theme parks owned by Disney Parks, Experiences and Products Inc. (formerly Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Worldwide, Inc.). These parks are extremely popular worldwide and are the most visited amusement parks in the country.\n\nUnfortunately, as with any amusement park, there are inherent risks that come with operating rides, and fatalities do happen. For the purposes of this study, we examined every reported death that has occurred at one of these two Disney parks. We included fatal accidents related to the park as well as all other causes of death.\n\nHow Often Was a Wrongful Death Lawsuit Filed?\n\nWhen someone dies due to the negligence of another person or organization, their family can file what’s called a wrongful death lawsuit. The goal of this lawsuit is to hold the responsible party accountable for the death and to recover compensation that can go towards funeral and burial costs, lost incomes, and the pain and suffering of the deceased’s family.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the percentage of incidents in which a wrongful death lawsuit was filed.\n\nOf the 87 reported fatal incidents at Disney Parks, the lawsuit status of each one is as follows:\n\n65% of incidents involved no lawsuit\n\n14% of incidents involved a lawsuit in which Disney settled\n\n6% of cases have an unknown lawsuit status\n\n6% of incidents resulted in OSHA fining Disney for safety violations\n\n5% of incidents involved a lawsuit against a third party (i.e. manufacturer)\n\n4% of incidents had a lawsuit that was dismissed or the status is unknown\n\nDisney Victim Demographics\n\nThe age breakdown of victims is as follows:\n\nChildren (Under 10): 15.5%\n\nTweens & Teens (11 to 18): 15.5%\n\nAdults (19 to 64): 43.3%\n\nSeniors (65+): 11.1%\n\nUnknown: 14.4%\n\nThe data shows that in 21% of the fatalities, it was a park employee who died.\n\nTimeline of Fatal Incidents at Disney Parks\n\nBelow is a timeline of fatalities that have occurred at both Disney parks. Each dot represents one fatality.\n\nNote: Timeline has not been updated with 2023 data\n\nCauses of Death\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the cause of death for the 90 reported fatalities at Disney parks. “Natural causes” of death include fatalities from preexisting conditions, both known and unknown. Deaths from natural causes make up 24% of fatalities at Disney, while suicides account for 14%.\n\nCause of Death # of Incidents Natural Causes 22 Suicide 13 Drowning 10 Fall 9 Crushing 5 Head Injury 5 Blunt Force Trauma 5 Plane Accident 4 Ran Over/Dragged by Ride 3 Unknown 3 Hit by Vehicle 2 Vehicle Accident 2 Alligator Attack 1 Amoebic Meningoencephalitis 1 Boat Accident 1 Brain Hemorrhage 1 Decapitated 1 Explosion 1 Pulmonary Embolism 1 Shooting 1 Stabbing 1 Septic Shock 1\n\nDisney Parks Fines & Settlements\n\nWhile many of Disney’s settlement amounts are not disclosed, below is a table of the monetary charges that are known. This includes both fines from OSHA and settlements paid to the deceased’s family, plus the year for context.\n\nOSHA Fines Year $69,000 2011 $35,200 2009 $25,500 2007 $18,350 2003 $12,500 1998 $6,300 2004 $4,500 1999 Disney Settlements Year $25 million 1998 $2 million 1977 $600,000 1981 $250,000 1987\n\nDisneyland Deaths\n\nDisneyland is located in Anaheim, California, and hosts over 60 rides and attractions. The park opened in 1955 and they report having an average of 18 million visitors per year. Disneyland California is the only one designed and built under direct supervision of Walt Disney.\n\nHow Many People Have Died at Disneyland?\n\nAs of Novemeber 2023, 29 people have reportedly died at Disneyland Resorts in California.\n\nFull List of Fatal Accidents at Disneyland\n\nRide: Jungle Cruise\n\nDate: 8/22/2021\n\nCause of Death: Septic Shock\n\nLawsuit: In Progress\n\nIncident: A 66-year old disabled woman was told that the wheelchair accessible boats for the Jungle Cruise were not available, but that she could still ride. After the ride ended, the woman struggled to exit the boat, falling backwards and sustaining a compound fracture in her leg. The woman spent time in the hospital and in a rehabilitation center before contracting an infection and passing away on 1/29/2022.\n\nRide: N/A (Parking Lot)\n\nDate: 8/29/2019\n\nCause of Death: Blunt Force Trauma\n\nLawsuit: Unknown\n\nIncident: A steel plate fell on a 38-year old male construction worker (who was an independent contractor) while working in a trench with other employees. Paramedics tried to perform CPR, but the man later died at the hospital.\n\nRide: Hyperion Theater (Disney California Adventure)\n\nDate: 4/22/2003\n\nCause of Death: Fell From Catwalk\n\nLawsuit: Disney was fined $18,350 by OSHA for safety violations in October 2003\n\nIncident: A 36-year old male stage technician fell 60 feet from a catwalk, prompting an investigation by Cal/OSHA. The victim never regained consciousness and died on May 18, 2003.\n\nRide: Roger Rabbit’s Car Toon Spin (Disneyland Park)\n\nDate: 10/22/2000\n\nCause of Death: Ran Over/Dragged by Ride\n\nLawsuit: Disney never admitted fault, but settled for an undisclosed amount in Jan 2002\n\nIncident: A 4-year old boy fell out of the ride vehicle and was dragged underneath the car, causing serious internal injuries, cardiac arrest, and brain damage. The victim never fully recovered from his injuries and died on January 26, 2009, aged 13, at Children’s Hospital of Orange County.\n\nAftermath: On October 7, 2000, Disneyland changed its emergency policy to instruct ride operators to call 911 first, instead of the Disney security center. Records showed that more than five minutes passed between the time the victim fell out of the ride vehicle and when emergency personnel were called. An investigation concluded that a lap bar had malfunctioned and that the victim was placed in the wrong seat in the ride vehicle, too close to the opening. Three months after the incident, the Permanent Ride Amusement branch of Cal/OSHA instructed Disney to install additional safety features on the ride.\n\nRide: Indiana Jones (Disneyland Park)\n\nDate: 6/25/2000\n\nCause of Death: Brain Hemorrhage\n\nLawsuit: Disney settled for an undisclosed amount\n\nIncident: A 23-year old woman exited the Indiana Jones ride complaining of a severe headache. She was hospitalized later that day and was discovered to have suffered a brain hemorrhage. She died on September 1, 2000, of a cerebral aneurysm.\n\nAftermath: Her family’s subsequent wrongful death lawsuit against Disney stated that the victim died because of “violent shaking and stresses imposed by the ride.” In an interlocutory appeal, the California Supreme Court held that amusement parks are considered “common carriers” similar to commercially operated planes, trains, elevators and ski lifts. This ruling imposes a heightened duty of care on amusement parks and requires them to provide the same degree of care and safety as do other common carriers.\n\nRide: Sailing Ship Columbia (Disneyland Park)\n\nDate: 12/24/1998\n\nCause of Death: Blunt Force Trauma\n\nLawsuit: Disney admitted fault and settled for an undisclosed amount estimated at $25 million. Disney was also fined by Cal/OSHA for $12,500 for improperly training the employee.\n\nIncident: A 33-year old man was struck by a heavy metal cleat fastened to the hull of the Sailing Ship Columbia. It tore loose, striking one cast member and two park guests. The victim died of a head injury at UCI Medical Center two days later.\n\nAftermath: The normal tie line, a hemp rope designed to break easily, was improperly replaced by a cheaper elastic nylon rope that stretched and tore the cleat from the ship’s wooden hull. Disney received much criticism for its alleged policy of restricting outside medical personnel in the park to avoid frightening visitors, as well as for the fact that the employee in charge of the ship at the time had not been trained in its operation. After this incident, Disney reinstated lead foreman on most rides, and the Anaheim Police Department placed officers in the park to speed response. This was the first guest death on a Disneyland ride that was not attributable to any negligence on the part of the guest.\n\nRide: N/A (Parking Lot)\n\nDate: 9/14/1985\n\nCause of Death: Crushing\n\nLawsuit: None\n\nIncident: A 7-year old girl was crushed to death beneath the wheels of a bus at Disneyland. The girl was walking across the parking lot with her uncle while looking for his car when she fell under a moving charter bus that crushed her instantly.\n\nRide: Rivers of America (Disneyland Park)\n\nDate: 6/4/1983\n\nCause of Death: Drowning\n\nLawsuit: Dismissed\n\nIncident: An 18-year old man drowned in the Rivers of America while trying to pilot a rubber emergency boat from Tom Sawyer’s Island which he and a friend had stolen from a restricted area of the island during Disneyland’s annual Grad Nite. Both individuals were intoxicated at the time of the incident. The victim’s mother sued Disneyland for allowing her inebriated son onto the premises, and sued the travel agency that had arranged the trip for not properly supervising the teenagers.\n\nRide: N/A\n\nDate: 4/16/1981\n\nCause of Death: Unknown\n\nLawsuit: None\n\nIncident: A 34-year old woman was standing in line to purchase food at the park’s hub at the end of Main Street near Sleeping Beauty’s Castle when she collapsed and later died at Palm Harbor General Hospital in nearby Garden Grove, California.\n\nRide: Tom Sawyer’s Island (Disneyland Park)\n\nDate: 6/20/1973\n\nCause of Death: Drowning\n\nLawsuit: None\n\nIncident: An 18-year old man and his 10-year-old brother stayed on Tom Sawyer’s Island past closing time by hiding in an area that is off-limits to guests. They later left the island and tried to swim across the river, but the younger boy didn’t know how to swim. The older boy attempted to carry his brother on his back and drowned halfway across. His body was found the next morning. The younger brother was able to stay afloat by dog paddling until a ride operator rescued him.\n\nRide: Monorail (Disneyland Park)\n\nDate: 6/17/1966\n\nCause of Death: Ran Over/Dragged\n\nLawsuit: None\n\nIncident: A 19-year old man was killed while attempting to sneak into the park by climbing onto the monorail track. Ignoring a security officer’s shouted warnings, he was struck by the train and dragged 30 to 40 feet down the track.\n\nAmerica Sings Death / Carousel of Progress Deaths\n\nRide: America Sings (Disneyland Park)\n\nDate: 7/8/1974\n\nCause of Death: Crushing\n\nLawsuit: None\n\nIncident: An 18-year old female employee was crushed to death after slipping between a revolving wall and a stationary platform inside the attraction. She was in the wrong place during a ride intermission; it was unclear whether this was the result of inadequate training or a misstep, as the ride had only opened about a week earlier. The attraction was closed for two days while crews cleaned up and installed warning lights and breakaway walls to prevent further incidents.\n\nSpace Mountain Deaths\n\nThere are rumors that a park guest was decapitated on Space Mountain, but this is false. The only decapitation occurred on Matterhorn, and the only deaths on Space Mountain have occurred from natural causes.\n\nRide: Space Mountain (Disneyland Park)\n\nDate: 8/14/1979\n\nCause of Death: Natural Causes (Tumor)\n\nLawsuit: Dismissed\n\nIncident: A 31-year old woman became sick after riding Space Mountain and was unable to exit the vehicle. Although employees told her to stay seated while the vehicle was removed from the track, other ride operators did not realize what was happening and accidentally sent her through the ride a second time. She arrived at the unloading zone semi-conscious. The victim was taken to Palm Harbor Hospital, where she remained in a coma and died one week later. The coroner’s report attributed the death to natural causes; a heart tumor had dislodged and entered her brain.\n\nThunder Mountain Deaths\n\nRide: Big Thunder Mountain Railroad (Disneyland Park)\n\nDate: 9/5/2003\n\nCause of Death: Blunt Force Trauma\n\nLawsuit: Disney admitted fault and settled for an undisclosed amount\n\nIncident: A 22-year old man died after suffering severe blunt-force trauma and extensive internal bleeding in a derailment of the roller coaster that also injured 10 other riders. As the train entered a tunnel, the axle came loose and jammed against a brake section, causing the locomotive to become airborne and hit the ceiling of the tunnel. The locomotive then fell on top of the first passenger car, crushing the victim.\n\nAftermath: The investigation revealed that the cause of the accident was improper maintenance. Reports showed that the derailment was the result of a mechanical failure that occurred because of omissions during a maintenance procedure. Fasteners on the left side upstop/guide wheel on the floating axle of the locomotive were not tightened and secured in accordance with specifications, and the first passenger car collided with the underside of the locomotive.\n\nMatterhorn Deaths\n\nRide: Matterhorn (Disneyland Park)\n\nDate: 1/3/1984\n\nCause of Death: Decapitated\n\nLawsuit: Disney settled for an undisclosed amount\n\nIncident: A 48-year old woman was decapitated when she was thrown from a Matterhorn bobsled car and then struck by the next oncoming bobsled. An investigation found that her seat belt was not buckled. It is unclear whether the victim deliberately unfastened her belt or if the seat belt had malfunctioned.\n\nRide: Matterhorn (Disneyland Park)\n\nDate: 5/1964\n\nCause of Death: Fall from ride\n\nLawsuit: None\n\nIncident: A 15-year old boy was injured after he stood up in the Matterhorn Bobsleds and fell out. It was reported that his restraint was undone by his ride companion. He died three days later as a result of his injuries. This was Disneyland’s first fatal incident.\n\nPeopleMover Deaths\n\nRide: PeopleMover (Disneyland Park)\n\nDate: 8/1967\n\nCause of Death: Ran Over/Dragged\n\nLawsuit: None\n\nIncident: A 16-year old boy was killed while jumping between two moving PeopleMover cars as the ride passed through a tunnel. He stumbled and fell onto the track, where an oncoming train of cars crushed him beneath its wheels and dragged his body a few hundred feet before it was stopped by a ride operator. The attraction had only been open for one month at the time.\n\nRide: PeopleMover (Disneyland Park)\n\nDate: 6/7/1980\n\nCause of Death: Crushing\n\nLawsuit: None\n\nIncident: An 18-year old man was crushed and killed by the PeopleMover while jumping between moving cars. The accident occurred as the ride entered the SuperSpeed tunnel and was very similar to the 1967 incident.\n\nThe PeopleMover shut down for good on August 21, 1995.\n\nDisneyland Murders\n\nTwo people have been murdered at Disneyland Resorts in California. Below are the incidents.\n\nRide: N/A (Parking Lot)\n\nDate: 3/7/1987\n\nCause of Death: Shooting\n\nLawsuit: None\n\nIncident: A 15-year old boy was fatally shot in the Disneyland parking lot. The incident began as a confrontation between rival gang members before escalating into a fight. An 18 year old was convicted of second-degree murder, but the conviction was subsequently overturned by a state appellate court.\n\nRide: Tomorrowland (Disneyland Park)\n\nDate: 3/7/1981\n\nCause of Death: Stabbing\n\nLawsuit: Disney settled for $600,000 due to negligence for not summoning outside medical help faster.\n\nIncident: An 18-year old man was fatally stabbed with a knife during a fight with a 28-year-old man, after the victim supposedly pinched the man’s girlfriend in Tomorrowland. His family sued the park for $60 million.\n\nDisneyland Suicides\n\nNine people have committed suicide at Disneyland Resorts in California.\n\nRide: N/A (Pixar Pals Parking Structure)\n\nDate: 11/15/2023\n\nCause of Death: Suicide\n\nLawsuit: None\n\nIncident: Anaheim Police responded to a call at 9:30pm on November 16 that someone jumped from the parking structure.
