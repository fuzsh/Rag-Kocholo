(Who in their right mind would destroy Walt Disney's house?!)\n\nSo, the Carolwood Pacific Society disassembled it and rebuilt it in Griffith Park at the Los Angeles Live Steamers.\n\nIf you're way into Disney or trains, I'd say you should definitely visit.\n\nAnd if you have kids, I'd at the very least recommend visiting the Los Angeles Live Steamers -- riding the trains is way cool!\n\nCheck the website for hours.  The barn is typically only open the 3rd Sunday of each month!\n\nhttp://www.carolwood.com\"",
