        "text": "Did you know that there’s a museum dedicated to the life and family of Walt Disney in San Francisco? The Walt Disney Family Museum is a must-do for any die-hard Disney fan! And even if you’re not a die-hard fan (yet!), it’s still an interesting way to spend a day in the city.\n\nThe Walt Disney Family Museum is located in the heart of the Presidio, formerly the most important Army post on the Pacific Coast. The museum is a must-do for any Disney fan, and while we already knew a great deal of Disney history, we learned A LOT more during our visit!\n\nThe kids were surprised to discover that Walt Disney tried to enlist in the Army during WWI but was too young. After altering his birthdate on his passport, he joined the American Ambulance Corps and was sent to France but arrived just as the war ended. He spent almost a year overseas, and rather than taking care of the injured and ill; he spent most of his time working as a tour guide for visiting officials.\n\nThey were also amazed at how many individual drawings were required to animate a 15-second scene of Steamboat Willie. While Steamboat Willie was not Disney’s first Mickey Mouse short (it was the third), it was the first successful one and the first one with sound. On November 18, 1928, Steamboat Willie premiered at the Colony Theather in New York City to rave reviews and launched the career of Mickey Mouse (and Walt Disney).\n\nThe WDFM has great interactive exhibits, and the kids enjoyed trying their hand at creating Silly Symphonies. There are listening stations, movies, drums, and displays with lots of buttons all through the galleries, which help to keep the little ones engaged and entertained.\n\nDuring WWII, the Disney company produced training films for the military as well as public service and morale-boosting shorts, and they did it all at cost (not for a huge profit like other companies).\n\nBen and Lexie thought it was pretty cool to sit on the actual bench from Griffith Park that Walt sat on many times while coming up with the idea for Disneyland. He watched his daughters play and laugh and imagined a place where families could go and have fun together.\n\nThe 13-foot model of the “Disneyland of Walt’s Imagination” was easily the highlight of the museum. We all enjoyed looking for our favorite attractions and seeing which ones changed or were added as well as the ones that never came to be.\n\nWe’ve been to Disneyland many times over the years, and it was so interesting to look at our usual routes through the park.\n\nYou can see the concept for the Rainbow Caverns Mine Train that became the Mine Train Through Nature’s Wonderland and eventually Big Thunder Mountain Railroad.\n\nThe Main Street Train Station and Main Street USA.\n\nNick especially loved the original Space Mountain concept that was both an indoor and outdoor coaster.\n\nAt the end of the exhibits, the mood is a bit heavier. Cartoons cover the walls, praising Disney for the impact he had on the children of the world, but also cover the news of his death.\n\n“You can dream, create, and build the most wonderful place in the world. But it takes people to make the dream a reality.” — Walt Disney\n\nEven though the museum ends on a somewhat somber note with the death of Walt Disney, you are constantly reminded of the impact that he made. The legacy that he left behind is immeasurable; he changed the lives of so many people, as well as changed the industry. “I hope that we don’t lose sight of one thing – that it was all started by a mouse.” — Walt Disney\n\nWe had a phenomenal time at the WDFM and would definitely recommend it if you’re in the San Francisco area- or even if you’re doing a Disneyland trip and can spare a weekend to go north. Strollers are now allowed in the galleries (although you may be asked to store double or jogging strollers at the coat check in the lower lobby depending on crowds), making it easier to explore with the kids. Most people recommend at least two hours to go through all of the exhibits though hardcore Disney fans and those traveling without small children will likely need to allow more time.\n\nThings to Remember if You’re Visiting the Walt Disney Family Museum\n\nThe museum is open Thursday – Sunday from 10am – 5:30pm, but the last entrance is at 4:30pm– go early to beat the crowds.\n\nIt’s closed every Monday – Wednesday, so plan accordingly (also closed on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years Day)\n\nActive duty and retired military (and spouses and dependents!) are free with a valid ID.\n\nEveryone is free on December 5 in observation of Walt’s birthday– tickets are only available in person, on the 5th.\n\nFlash photography and professional camera equipment are not allowed in the museum.\n\nIf you’re looking for more things to do in San Francisco, check out these posts:\n\nThings to Do In San Francisco With Kids\n\nAlcatraz Night Tour | San Francisco, CA\n\nMuir Woods National Monument | California\n\nWhat’s on your Disney Bucket List?? If it’s not already on it, definitely add the Walt Disney Family Museum!\n\nSharing is caring!!"
