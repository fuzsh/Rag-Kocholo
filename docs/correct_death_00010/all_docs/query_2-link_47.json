        "text": "The Los Feliz home Walt Disney dreamed up for his wife and two daughters can be yours to rent — for $40,000 a month, that is.\n\nThe 6,388-square-foot home, which was built in 1932, has nods to some of the castles featured in a few of Disney’s fairy tales. During the period Disney lived in the home, Walt Disney Studios released some of his most popular films, including “Pinocchio,” “Fantasia,” “Dumbo,” “Bambi” and “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” according to the Walt Disney Family Museum.\n\nThe founding father of one of the world’s largest media companies would watch his own productions in the home theater, which is still intact.\n\n“This property was chosen by Walt Disney as the place to raise his family and also coincided with a transition of Disney Studios from fledgling enterprise toward entertainment giant,” listing agent Chase Campen of Compass said in a news release. “It sits on an acre of land with incredible outdoor space and city views. Its historical pedigree only adds to the magical mystique.”\n\nDisney was born in 1901 in Chicago and moved to California in the 1920s. He set up Walt Disney Co. with his brother, Roy, in the back of a small office at Holly-Vermont Realty in Los Angeles. Disney lived in the Los Feliz house in the later part of his life, until 1950. Disney died in 1966 of lung cancer.\n\nThe home, which features French Provincial, French Country Tudor and Neo-Gothic architectural styles, contains four bedrooms, three full bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, an in-ground swimming pool, a home theater and a gated driveway that can fit 10."
