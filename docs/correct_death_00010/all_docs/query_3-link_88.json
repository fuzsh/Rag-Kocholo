        "text": "Dick Nunis was a Disney legend in more ways than one.\n\n“Today, we mourn the passing of Dick Nunis, a true Disney Legend whose contributions to The Walt Disney Company have touched the lives of millions of people all over the world,” said Disney CEO Bob Iger. “What started as a summer job training future Disneyland employees would ultimately become a storied 44-year career at Disney. Dick took the values and philosophies he learned directly from Walt and incorporated them into everything he did at Disney. We are grateful for his many achievements and we extend our deepest sympathies to his family and loved ones.”\n\nThe company said in a statement that Nunis died December 13 surrounded by his family in his adopted hometown of Orlando. He was 91.\n\nNunis first heard about plans for a new park in Anaheim from a classmate named Ron Miller, who just happened to be Walt Disney’s son-in-law. He soon applied for a job and, in May 1955, was hired as an orientation training instructor just prior to the park’s July 17, 1955 debut. He and the founder of The Disney University and author of the park’s orientation and training program, Van France, were responsible for training park employees, including Walt himself.\n\n“Walt believed strongly that what would make Disneyland different was the people—he wanted them to feel that they were part of the organization,” Nunis once recalled. “That’s why he established the first-name policy—he was Walt, I was Dick, and so on. From an overall operations point of view, the most important thing is to work together to make sure that when guests come, they have a wonderful experience.”\n\nRELATED: Randy Fullmer Dies: Disney Animation Veteran On ‘Lion King’, ‘Beauty And The Beast’ & More Was 73\n\nNunis soon worked his way up to attractions supervisor, developing standard operating procedures for the park’s attractions. In 1961, he became director of park operations and helped develop “Project X,” which became Walt Disney World Resort.\n\nFrom 1967–74, Nunis was chairman of the Park Operations Committee, and, in 1968, was bumped up to vice president of operations. When “Project X” opened in 1971, he was named executive vice president of Walt Disney World and Disneyland.\n\nIn 1980 he was named president of the Outdoor Recreation Division, additionally overseeing EPCOT Center and, later, the Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park (now Disney’s Hollywood Studios). Nunis also consulted on plans for Tokyo Disneyland and Disneyland Paris while serving on the Walt Disney Productions Board of Directors.\n\nWhen he retired as chairman of Walt Disney Attractions in 1999, Nunis was honored with a window on Main Street, U.S.A. at Disneyland and was named a Disney Legend.\n\n“On behalf of every Cast Member, Crew Member, Imagineer and employee of Disney Experiences, I want to express my gratitude to Disney Legend Dick Nunis… and my condolences to his family following the sad news of his passing,” Chairman of Disney Experiences Josh D’Amaro, said today. “Dick’s impact on our theme parks business is everlasting. Along with our founder, Walt Disney, Dick helped shape our business, create happiness for millions of families around the world… and set a standard that an entire industry must now live up to.”"
