Walt Disney established a business empire based upon fantasy and what he considered to be good, old-fashioned fun. Disney’s imagination and determination helped his company to grow and prosper through several initial setbacks, the Great Depression, World War II, and the Cold War. His brand of fun continues to entertain today.",

        "text": "After four years, the farm was not profitable, and Walt’s father became ill. In 1911 the family moved to Kansas City where Roy and Walt helped their father deliver newspapers. Walt was only nine years old when he had to get up at 3:30 a.m., seven days a week, to fold and deliver papers for two hours before attending the Benton Grammar School. Walt’s work responsibilities did not keep him from drawing and having fun. He attended the Kansas City Art Institute on Saturday mornings, and performed skits and vaudeville routines with friends at local theaters. Walt graduated from the Benton School, and soon the family moved back to Chicago.\n\nWalt started McKinley High School in 1917 and he began to draw for the student newspaper. His biggest adventure at this time, however, was lying about his age (with the help of his mother) in order to join the Red Cross Ambulance Corps in Europe after World War I. Walt headed to France in 1918, and for nine months, he drove supply trucks and ambulances and chauffeured officers. When his tour was over, Walt returned to Chicago briefly, but rather than going back to school and getting a high school diploma, he headed back to Kansas City in 1919.\n\nFrom there, the two got jobs with the Kansas City Slide Company, later renamed the Kansas City Film Ad Company, making one-minute advertisements to appear before movies and live action films. Disney learned about animation at this job and eventually felt confident enough to start his own business. He left the Film Ad Company in May of 1922 to start Laugh-O-Gram Films in the McConahy building at 31st Street and Forest Avenue. Disney put an ad in the newspaper requesting artists who wanted to learn animation to come work for him.\n\nDisney’s first popular film, Alice’s Wonderland, was created here and featured a girl, Virginia Davis, entering a cartoon world. He went on to make a series of these films, which are referred to as the Alice Comedies.\n\nDisney operated his new company for a year and a half. He had good ideas, but he was not a good businessman. Eventually his staff left because they were not getting paid. Disney declared bankruptcy and left Kansas City in July of 1923 to try his luck in Hollywood.\n\nThe building where Disney created his first films and operated his first professional film studio still stands and is being renovated. The talented animators who got their start in Kansas City eventually followed Disney to California, making up the core of professional cartoonists in the early days of the Hollywood animation scene. They included Ub Iwerks, Rudolf Ising, Hugh Harman, and Friz Freleng.\n\nIn 1927 Disney created Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, which was also a huge hit. At this time, Disney experienced the first of many setbacks with his new company. His distributor in New York, Charles Mintz, hired away most of Disney’s animators. He refused to negotiate a fair contract in order to force Disney to work for him, saying Universal Studios owned all of Disney’s creations. Disney did not give in to Mintz. He went back to Hollywood, and he, Roy, and his one loyal animator, Iwerks, began work on a new character.\n\nDisney released Steamboat Willie in 1928, and contracted with Pat Powers and his Cinephone technology to put the cartoon to music, making it the most successful sound cartoon. The Silly Symphonies Series followed in 1929, and then disaster struck again in 1930. Pat Powers wanted to control the new Mickey Mouse cartoons. Again, most of the Disney staff left to work for Powers, including Ub Iwerks. Powers thought Disney would also follow for a large salary, but Disney did not. Instead, he and Roy purchased their contract from Powers, found a new distributor, and made Mickey Mouse the most beloved cartoon character of all time.\n\nThe Great Depression did not prevent the Disney Studio from growing. Disney continued to experiment with animation, color, and sound, buying exclusive rights to use Technicolor, a new three-color process, in his films. In 1932 he won his first Academy Award for Flowers and Treesand another one in 1937 for Snow White, the first full-length animated feature film. Also in 1932, the Disney Art School was established, and “the Disney style” of animation was taught to new artists.\n\nBy 1939 the studio needed a larger facility, so Disney built the Burbank Studio. In the early 1940s, Disney favorites such as Fantasia, Pinocchio, Dumbo, and Bambiwere released. A labor strike in 1941 impacted the success of the studio. Strikers demanded fair wages and job security. The strike ended in the fall of that year, but some employees remained unhappy, and Disney felt personally betrayed by his staff’s actions.\n\nAlso in 1941, the U.S. Army moved onto the Disney lot and stayed for eight months. During this time, Disney did not have a lot of money to do feature films. He focused on government contracts that required him to make training and patriotic films such as Victory Through Air Power in 1943. Disney produced many educational and industrial films at this time.\n\nDisney took advantage of television to promote his movies and his theme parks. The Mickey Mouse Club began October 3, 1955, and ran until 1959 on ABC. Episodes of Davy Crockett appeared on the television show, Disneyland, between 1954 and 1956, and were so popular that young boys everywhere wore coonskin hats to idealize their frontier hero.\n\nThe building of Disneyland in 1955 was a dream come true for Disney. With financial backing from ABC, he was able to create a fantasy world for both adults and children, allowing guests to immerse themselves in his cartoons rather than just watching them on the big screen. Disney based his “Main Street, USA,” upon the streets of small-town America, particularly the buildings in downtown Marceline, Missouri. In fact, Disney paid a visit to Marceline in 1946 and likely did research for his park design. In 1938 Disney had written, “More things of importance happened to me in Marceline than have happened since—or are likely to in the future.”\n\nThe Freedom Foundation presented Disney with the George Washington Award in 1963 for promoting the American way of life, and President Lyndon Johnson awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Walt and Roy Disney were also instrumental in establishing the California Institute of the Arts in 1961.\n\nBefore he died on December 15, 1966 of lung cancer, Disney visited Marceline several more times. On July 4, 1956, he and Roy attended the dedication of the Walt Disney Municipal Park and Pool. Disney returned in 1960 for the Walt Disney Elementary School dedication. He never forgot the small Missouri town that influenced his work so much."
