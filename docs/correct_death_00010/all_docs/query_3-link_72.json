        "text": "(WTXL) â€” On this day In 1971, Walt Disney World opened near Orlando, Florida.\n\nIn 1955, Disneyland was built in Anaheim, California. After the success of this park, Walt Disney decided to build another park in Florida. Unfortunately, Disney died before the park opened.\n\nAt the time, the park only had two resorts and one park: The Magic Kingdom.\n\nNow, the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Orlando is one of the most popular theme parks in the world."
