        "text": "With the success of their first full-length cartoon feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs the Walt Disney Studios was carried to the top of the animated production field and proved that there was a world market for Walt Disney's product. With the profits, Walt was able to meet the studio’s expansion needs and build a 3-million-dollar studio on a 51-acre parcel of land in Burbank, California! A brand new motion picture studio was designed and created in 1939 and scheduled for completion by January of 1940. The new studio would be an increasing model of efficiency for film production and serve as the worldwide headquarters for the corporation. This was necessary considering the increasing in staff (to more than 1000 artists, animators, story men and technicians) spread across the diverse departments handling various processes involved in the production schedule of both short and feature-length films. (See Walt Disney Studios Operations Chart and Cartoon Continuity Through the Studio Chart below.)\n\nNotwithstanding production of Walt Disney’s Academy Award-winning Pinocchio (due to be released February 7, 1940) and the Academy Award-winning Fantasia (which was to be released November 13, 1940), construction of the new studio was completed by January of 1940. By May 6, 1940, the move from Hyperion to Burbank was complete. This move included the employees, equipment, and even structures from the old studio location.\n\n“Mickey Avenue & Dopey Drive - The Crossroads of the World”\n\nSoon after the move was complete, The Reluctant Dragon (the first live action filmed at the studio; released June 20, 1941) offered audiences the opportunity to see what a working animation studio looked like. A special directional sign prop was constructed for a scene of the film featuring actor Robert Benchley. Today, a sign reading “Mickey Avenue” and “Dopey Drive” stands at the famous intersection.\n\n“The Main Theater”\n\nThe new studio would enable Walt to produce two features at the same time (Pinocchio and Fantasia were both on the production slate at the time). In the photo (pictured above), three Walt Disney Studio employees look on, in anticipation of the Grand Opening and screening of the recently released Walt Disney’s Pinocchio. The Main Theater was opened on the Walt Disney Studio Lot ahead of Pinocchio’s February release. The Main Theater opened on Wednesday, April 10th, 1940, premiering the new completed film for the staff.\n\nEventually, the Walt Disney Studio came under the parent Company of Walt Disney Productions (formed by Walt and Roy Disney in 1923). Walt Disney Productions would produce motion pictures for theatrical and television distribution and occasionally these would be screened at the Main Theater.\n\n“Clubs & Activities”\n\nBy that time, Van Arsdale France mentioned how the Studio “was much more like a good-sized university.” In fact, he recalled that by the time he was hired during the summer of 1954, the Studio was referred to as “the Campus.” He went on to describe aspects that he called “unbelievable” - “People playing ping pong, volleyball, basketball, softball, or just lying around the grass.” There was a gym for male employees and there were clubs formed.\n\nBy 1959, master negatives of Sleeping Beauty and other Disney films were kept in a specially built, two story concrete “vault” at the Disney Studios. In this valuable vault inventory were some 17 cartoon features; 11 full-length live-action features; 4 full-length “True-Life” pictures; and nearly 500 short subjects, mostly cartoons and travel pictures from Disney's People and Places series.\n\n“Walt Disney’s Working & Formal Offices - 3H”\n\nWalt had two offices on the Walt Disney Studio backlot. Walt Disney’s Working Office was used for conferences with directors, writers, artists, and almost anyone involved in creating Walt Disney Productions. Walt used his “Formal Office” for appointments with special guests visiting the Disney Studio.\n\nAccording to National Geographic (published August, 1963), “Walt’s office has become so crowded [with awards] that recently four cabinets of awards were placed in the Studio Commissary. Some of the employees promptly nicknamed the commissary the ‘Awards Room,’” adding that “He is proudest, perhaps, of the Audubon Society Medal awarded in 1955.”\n\nThe two offices (filled with their authentic contents) were used by Walt for nearly 26 years. The offices appear today as they were found in 1970 by Dave Smith, our Walt Disney Company Archivist.\n\nIf you were a Disneyland Cast Member during the early 1980s, you may have seen glimpses of Walt Disney’s Working Office inside the pages of the “Welcome to Disneyland” Orientation book. If you visited Disneyland during the mid-1970s, you may recall seeing a recreation of Walt Disney’s Working Office. Some of you may have fond memories of the rarest privilege of all - to have been invited to the third floor (on the corner) and into Walt’s Working Office for a meeting. After Walt’s passing in 1966, the office was shut (allowing the immediate family member’s entrance to procure select mementos).\n\nNow after some time, the Walt Disney Studios was approached with a proposal by Dave Smith, to thoroughly archive the contents of the Offices of Walt Disney, and the “Chief Archivist Emeritus” would become the first person to enter, preserving and taking inventory of every item in the office, right down to the number of pencils on Walt’s desk.\n\nBehind the desk of Walt’s Formal Office, you’ll notice many figures and miniatures which were either purchased during travels or given to him as gifts. It’s been said that Walt's miniature collection, was to have been part of the inspiration behind the attraction, “It's a small World.” Whatever the case, most of their stories are unknown to this day, but we do know that (in addition to the production character maquette) there is a small deer (located next to Walt’s prestigious Irving Thalberg Memorial Award in Walt’s Working Office) which was personally crafted by Walt Disney. The facsimile of a c.1942 Irving Thalberg Memorial Award in the shape of a bust of Thalberg. This was awarded to Walt for “the most consistent high quality of production achievement by an individual producer.” The true-life award is currently in the care of The Walt Disney Family Museum.\n\nYou may note (among the number of items on Walt’s Formal Office Desk) a Bell. This was a gift from the Coast Guard after Walt’s completion of “Men Against the Arctic.” Walt’s secretary would ring the Bell when it was time for lunch. To the right of the Bell, you will also note at least one of Diane’s Baby Shoes, the pair of which was “bronzed” as Bookends.\n\nAtop a cabinet, there is also a Silver Bowl, a TV Guide Award, 1961-1962, for his best single dramatic program, The Prince and the Pauper.\n\nAs to Walt Disney’s Working Office, The Walt Disney Archivists report :\n\n“Walt arrived here at 8:30 a.m. each day, and from then on, people were ‘in and out’ almost constantly - including producers, directors, writers, artists, and marketing and merchandising advisors. Walt also conducted day-to-day business affairs here with his brother, business partner and company co-founder Roy O. Disney. Meetings in this space sometimes were attended by ‘wall to wall’ people, as Walt’s secretary Tommie Wilck remembered. On occasion, visitors were known to have taken seats on the floor! Walt’s last scheduled meeting was usually at 4:30 or 5:00 p.m. - but then he would read and edit scripts here until he left for home, usually around 7 p.m. Behind his desk were scripts, treatments and project outlines for then-current projects that were in the works around the studio. From film productions to preliminary work on EPCOT, inspiration for many of the company’s endeavors at that point occurred in this very room.”\n\nYou may note (among the number of items on Walt’s Formal Office Desk) a bell. This was a gift from the Coast Guard after Walt’s completion of the Walt Disney Production feature-length film “Men Against the Arctic.” Allegedly, Walt was working so intensely, that he did not hear Lucille call him when it was time for him to eat, and so he had the idea that she ring the bell in the future, to alert him of lunch time. And so Walt’s secretary Lucille would ring the Men of the Arctic Bell Award when it was time for him to go to lunch.\n\nBehind Walt’s Working Office Desk were many awards and books which he valued. There was a Trophy presented to Walt for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs by the Venice festival in 1938. The Milestone Award presented by the Screen Producer’s Guild in 1957 for Walt’s “historical contribution to the American motion picture.” The Winged Victory behind his desk, was presented to Walt Disney for Cinderella by a French magazine. Books behind the desk included the International Motion Picture Almanac, 1965 ; The Magic Bed-Knob, by Mary Norton (became Bedknobs and Broomsticks); Blackbeard’s Ghost, by Ben Stahl; The Heart of Our Cities by Victor Gruen (early Epcot research); The Year of the Horse, by Eric Hatch (became The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit); Little Britches by Ralph Moody (became The Wild Country); Travels with Charley, by John Steinbeck; Abraham Lincoln, a play by John Drinkwater; The Modern Service of Commercial and Railway Telegraph by J.P. Abernathy, 1891.\n\n“Walt’s Formal Office”\n\nThere are many important documents and publications in Walt’s Formal Office, like weekly scheduling charts and Studio cost reports (in the rack to the left of his desk). The Pigeon-hole Cabinet was used to store current scripts, while Walt’s briefcase usually contained scripts that he would carry home to study.\n\nWalt’s Formal Office, also displayed a number of mementos. For instance, there was a Grumman Gulfstream I Model Airplane, a miniature of plane that Walt utilized during the 1960s (seen on display at Walt Disney Archives Presents “Step in Time,” part of “Disney 100 - The Exhibition” celebrating “Disney 100 Years of Wonder”). In fact, this is the exact style of craft Walt used to survey the land that would later be used for the development of Walt Disney World in Florida. The model was a gift from Henry J. Schiebel, Jr. Vice President of the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation in Bethpage, New York. It was displayed near a photograph of a Grumman Gulfstream in flight. After receiving the model plane, Walt wrote Mr. Schiebel (on March 15, 1964): “Thank you for the beautiful model of the 732 Gulfstream. It sits on the bookcase behind my desk where I can - and frequently do point to it with pride. We just completed our first round trip to the East coast and it was a wonderful trip. As they say... ‘It's the only way to fly.’ From all I hear the Gulfstream is one of the finest aircrafts built. I know my pilots are very happy with it and, speaking strictly as one of the passengers, the comfort, the quiet and the beauty of this plane make it an outstanding one. I'm sure you can see we're very pleased.”\n\nAtop his Working Office desk, Walt kept awards he always valued as the finest he ever received. In the center, one cannot miss Walt’s prestigious Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award periodically bestowed upon individuals for a body of work, by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences. As a film producer and pioneer, Walt Disney held the record in the motion picture industry for personally winning the most Academy Awards. Walt won 32 Oscars total including the prestigious Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award (in 1941) “for consistent high quality productions.”\n\nTo the right is a small Hand-carved Deer, which Walt fashioned by himself. The box located under Walt’s Thalberg Award was a gift used to store Walt’s glasses. It was a gift by General Electric for his work with the Progressland Pavilion at the 1964-1965 New York World’s Fair.\n\nWalt Disney wisely shared: “There is more treasure in books than in all the pirates' loot on Treasure Island and at the bottom of the Spanish Main and best of all, you can enjoy these riches every day of your life.”Proving this belief are the sheer volume of literary works found within Walt Disney’s “Formal” Office 3H. This office of Walt Disney Studios contains a library of books on a variety of subjects, by numerous writers. Some books inspired Walt Disney Productions like (“Mary Poppins” and “The Swiss Family Robinson”), while others were autobiographical and historic works of non-fiction. Many of these were autographed by their author.\n\nIn his Formal Office there is a a Mauriece Chevalier photograph (on the wall) autographed to Walt, a Chart (in rack at left of desk) containing the weekly schedule and cost report of production in progress at the Studio, a Briefcase (behind the desk) used by Walt to carry scripts home for study, a Phonograph (in drawers behind the desk) with speakers in the walls, a Winged Victory Award presented to Walt Disney for Cinderella, a Milestone Award presented to Walt by the Screen Producer’s Guild in 1957 for Walt’s historical contribution to motion picture history, an a trophy presented to Walt for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs by the Venice festival of 1938.\n\nGrand Piano: Walt did not play, but the piano was used by composers like the Sherman brothers) to play their new songs for him. Photographs: (on piano) Diane Disney; Diane Disney - holding teddy bear; Sharon Disney. Mousecar: (on piano) the Disney equivalent of the Oscar; this one was presented to Walt by his brother Roy.\n\nKem Weber had purchased the c.1914 Knabe piano and then took it apart and put it back together (after making some alterations). The result was a custom piano created for the office of Walt Disney. It was designed to fit into the tight office space, as well as blend in with the office decor.\n\nNow, Walt never learned to play the piano. But some evenings, Walt Disney would have a drink with composer Richard M. Sherman who (along with his brother Robert B. Sherman) wrote scores for films like Walt Disney’s The Jungle Book. Disney would simply say, “play it,” and Sherman knew what he meant. Richard would then play “Feed the Birds” from Walt Disney’s Mary Poppins (Walt’s favorite tune).\n\nOn “Walt’s Role,” the “Walt Disney Productions Annual Report to Shareholders and Employees” for the fiscal year ending October 2, 1965, shared an interesting answer from Walt. “Responding to a question posed by the National Geographic, Walt Disney described in this way his role as the company’s creative catalyst. ‘You know, I was stumped one day when a little boy asked, ‘Do you draw Mickey Mouse?’ I had to admit I do not draw anymore. ‘Then you think up all the jokes and ideas?’ ‘No,’ I said, ‘I don’t do that.’ Finally he looked at me and said, ‘sometimes I think of myself as a little bee. I go from one area of the studio to another and gather pollen and sort of stimulate everybody.’ I guess that’s the job I do.’”\n\n“The Roy O. Disney Marketing Building”\n\nIn September of 1976, Walt Disney Productions completed its ninth consecutive record year, by dedicating the new Roy O. Disney Marketing Building (shown in the pages of “Walt Disney Productions Annual Report 1976”).\n\n“The Roy E. Animation Building”\n\nAnimation production was non-existent on the Walt Disney Studios’ Burbank lot for nine years, until the ANIMATION building’s completion in 1994. According to curators of The Walt Disney Archives: “The Animation Building opened in 1994, and followed on the heels of the worldwide success of ‘The Lion King.’”\n\nBy some accounts, the Studio previously lacked sufficient space to store such an archive. According to Ward Kimball’s account (in a letter addressed to Roger C. Nelson, proprietor of Remember When Nostalgia Shop in New Orleans, Louisiana; dated July 16, 1970, less than a month after the Walt Disney Archives was founded): The “Merchandise Department says that if they had kept just one, repeat ONE, of each franchised Mickey item, the combined collection would fill our entire 3-floored animation building!” Ward may have made this statement, firmly believing that “all of this accumulation” (of Mickey Mouse watch variations and toys) “will some day find its way into our contemplated museum at either the studio or at Disneyland.”\n\nSix years later (in 1976), the Walt Disney Archives appropriately moved into a two-floor office of the Roy O. Disney Building in order to accommodate the collection, its offices, and services. Most guests only see the Walt Disney Archives Reading Room (where study can be performed). Unseen to most, the Walt Disney Archives also features Audio-Visual Rooms, an Office, a temperature and humidity climate-controlled Storage Area (for the preservation of artifacts and other historic materials), and a Workroom.\n\nSome of these historic materials include, but are not limited to a collection of :\n\n•Character Merchandise Samples (featuring the likenesses of Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters) and Facsimiles (as well as related catalogues, contracts, and photographs of items not currently part of the collection) dating from the 1920s to the present\n\n•a Film Collection which is housed in another facility\n\n•Music in the form of a collection of over 1,300 records produced by the Walt Disney Music Company, and “several hundred singles and albums of Disney songs by other recording companies, such as the first records put out in 1934 by RCA Victor along with tape recordings and sheet music.”\n\n•“Oral Histories” or, “taped interviews with Disney employees, covering many different topics”, and “taped transcripts of… most interviews and speeches”.\n\n•Original Artwork including animation drawings, backgrounds, layouts, renderings, story sketches, and some cels related to film production.\n\n•Photographs (of both publicity and movie stills) and more than half-a-million Negatives\n\n•Production Files including drafts and scripts (as well as many props and costumes related to Walt Disney Studio productions thru the decades)\n\n•Publications (by some time in the 1970s, the “complete” and archived collection included “more than 900 titles of Disney books published in the United States, as well as some “foreign Disney books published in over 35 languages”, “domestic Disney comic books and magazines, along with most of the foreign ones, dating back to 1932”)\n\n•Publicity Materials (both “clippings” and materials prepared for press release and publishing in newspapers and magazines).\n\n•Theme Park Materials including Audio-Animatronic figures and materials, correspondence files (i.e. Inter-Office Communications and letters), models, photographs, plans (as elevations, floor plans, details, and much more), ticket and coupon media, restaurant menus, Park souvenir merchandise!\n\n•Walt Disney “Office Correspondence Files” (spanning more than three decades, from 1930 until his death in 1966), including awards, gifts, office furnishings, personal effects, photographs, recordings, transcripts, and much more related to Walt Disney!\n\nLeonard Nimoy had previously visited the studio regarding the production of “Standby… Lights! Camera! Action!” for Nickelodeon. One episode of the series took viewers behind the scenes of The Black Cauldron. Here, Leonard visits The Walt Disney Studios yet again, perhaps in relation to host “The Challenger Spirit Salute” at the Magic Kingdom on February 25, 1989.\n\nThe camera had the ability to zoom (that is, to move up or back on a camera image by using a zoom lens).\n\nToday, the Walt Disney Studios is located at 500 South Buena Vista, Burbank, California."
