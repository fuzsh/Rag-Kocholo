        "text": "(1901–66). A cartoonist and master of motion picture animation, Walt Disney made the world fall in love with a large-eared mouse, a scheming duck, and dozens of other animal characters. Over the course of his remarkable career, Disney transformed the making of full-length animated films into an art form.\n\nWalter Elias Disney was born on December 5, 1901, in Chicago, Illinois, the fourth of five children. In 1906 the family moved to a farm near Marceline, Missouri. It was here that Disney began to draw; his first sketches were of the farm animals. In 1910 the family moved to Kansas City, Missouri, where young Disney got his first job as an artist: he did weekly sketches for a barber, for which he received either 25 cents or a haircut. In 1917 the family returned to Chicago, where Disney attended McKinley High School, and studied drawing in the evening at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. He left high school without graduating and enlisted as a Red Cross ambulance driver in World War I.\n\nAfter the war, Disney returned to Kansas City and worked as an artist with an advertising firm. During this period he made his first animated cartoons, Laugh-O-Grams. By 1923 Disney had decided his future lay in Hollywood with the film industry. He formed a partnership with his brother Roy and produced the Alice Comedies series. Steamboat Willie, the first cartoon to use synchronized sound, appeared in 1928. It starred a new personality, Mickey Mouse. Within the next 10 years Mickey and his fellow characters Minnie Mouse, Pluto the dog, and Donald Duck became world famous.\n\nDisney’s first full-length film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, was released in 1937. Seal Island (1948) was the first of Disney’s True-Life Adventures, featuring real wildlife. He also made films such as Mary Poppins that used human actors.\n\nDisney won more than 100 prizes for his films, including 29 Academy awards. In 1964 he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. His films, which include Fantasia, The Aristocats, and Bambi, are rereleased periodically. Disney’s films have been released in many languages and are shown around the world. (See also cartoons.)"
