        "text": "July 13, 2020 Archive Insight\n\nPostcard, “Disneyland,” 1975. THF 207872\n\nWelcome to Disneyland!\n\nDisneyland was created from a combination of Walt Disney’s innovative vision, the creative efforts and technical genius of the team he put together, and the deep emotional connection the park elicits with guests when they visit there. Walt Disney himself claimed, “There is nothing like it in the entire world. I know because I’ve looked. That’s why it can be great: because it will be unique.” Here’s the story of how Walt created Disneyland, the first true theme park.\n\nSouvenir Book, “Disneyland,” 1955. THF 205151\n\nDisneyland is much like Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Florida, but it’s smaller and more intimate. To me, it seems more “authentic.” It’s like you can almost feel the presence of Walt Disney everywhere because he had a personal hand in things.\n\nWalt Disney posing the Greenfield Village Tintype Studio, 1940. THF 109756\n\nIn creating Disneyland, Walt Disney challenged many rules of traditional amusement parks. We’ll see how. But first…since he insisted that everyone he met call him by his first name, that’s what we’ll do. From now on, I’ll be referring to him as Walt!\n\nSouvenir Book, “Disneyland,” 1955. THF 205155\n\nDISNEY INSIDER TRIVIA: Do you know where Walt Disney’s inspiration for Main Street, USA, came from?\n\nANSWER: Born in 1901, Walt loved the bustling Main Street of his boyhood home in Marceline, Missouri. Marceline later provided the inspiration for Disneyland’s Main Street, USA.\n\nMap and guide, “Hollywood Movie Capital of the World,” circa 1942. THF 209523\n\nAfter trying different animated film techniques in Kansas City, Walt left to seek his fortune in Hollywood.\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs Valentine, 1938. THF 335750\n\nThere, he made a name for himself with Mickey Mouse (1927) and—10 years later—the first full-length animated feature film, Snow White. Walt innately understood what appealed to the American public and later brought this to Disneyland.\n\nHandkerchief, circa 1935. THF 128151\n\nDISNEY INSIDER INFO: Here’s how Mickey Mouse looked on a child’s handkerchief in the 1930s.\n\n“Merry-Go-Round-Waltz,” 1949. THF 255058\n\nWalt claimed the idea of Disneyland came to him while watching his two daughters ride the carousel in L.A.’s Griffith Park. There, he began to imagine a clean, safe, friendly place where parents and children could have fun together!\n\nHerschell-Spillman Carousel. THF 5584\n\nDISNEY INSIDER INFO: That carousel in Griffith Park was built in 1926 by the Spillman Engineering Company—a later name for the Herschell-Spillman Company, the company that made the carousel now in our own Greenfield Village in 1913! Here’s what ours looks like.\n\nConey Island, New York, circa 1905 – THF 241449\n\nDISNEY INSIDER INFO: For more on the evolution of American amusement parks, see my blog post, “From Dreamland to Disneyland: American Amusement Parks.”\n\n1958 Edsel Bermuda Station Wagon Advertisement, “Dramatic Edsel Styling is Here to Stay.” THF 124600\n\nThe decline of these older amusement parks ironically coincided with the rapid growth of suburbs, freeways, car ownership, and an unprecedented baby boom—a market primed for pleasure travel and family fun!\n\nYoung Girl Seated on a Carousel Horse, circa 1955. THF 105688\n\nSome amusement parks added “kiddie” rides and, in some places, whole new “kiddie parks” appeared. But that’s not what Walt had in mind. Adults still sat back and watched their kids have all the fun.\n\nChicago Railroad Fair Official Guidebook, 1948. THF 285987\n\nWalt’s vision for his family park also came from his lifelong love of steam railroads. In 1948, he and animator/fellow train buff Ward Kimball visited the Chicago Railroad Fair and had a ball. Check out the homage to old steam trains in this program.\n\nTintype of Walt and Ward. THF 109757\n\nAfter the Railroad Fair, Walt and Ward visited our own Greenfield Village, where they enjoyed the small-town atmosphere during a special tour. At the Tintype Studio, they had their portrait taken while dressed up as old-time railroad engineers.\n\nWalt Disney and Artist Herb Ryman with illustration proposals for the Ford Pavilion, 1964-1965 New York World’s Fair. THF 114467\n\nDISNEY INSIDER TRIVIA: Walt Disney used the word Imagineers to describe the people who helped him give shape to what would become Disneyland. What two words did he combine to create this new word?\n\nANSWER: Walt hand-picked a group of studio staff and other artists to help him create his new family park. He later referred to them as Imagineers—combining the words imagination and engineering. This image shows Walt with Herb Ryman—one of his favorite artists.\n\nDISNEY INSIDER INFO: For a deeper dive on an early female Imagineer, see my blog post, “The Exuberant Artistry of Mary Blair.”\n\nPostcard viewbook of Los Angeles, California. THF 7376\n\nWalt continually looked for new ideas and inspiration for his park, including places around Los Angeles, like Knott’s Berry Farm, the Spanish colonial-style shops on Olvera Street, and the bustling Farmer’s Market—one of Walt’s favorite hangouts.\n\nTimes Square – Looking North – New York City, August 7, 1948. THF 8840\n\nWalt also worried about how people got fatigued in large and crowded environments. So, he studied pathways, traffic flow, and entrances and exits at places like fairs, circuses, carnivals, national parks, museums, and even the streets of New York City.\n\nSouvenir Book, “Disneyland,” 1955. THF 205154\n\nStudying these led to Walt’s first break from traditional amusement parks: the single entrance. Amusement park operators argued this would create congestion, but Walt wanted visitors to experience a cohesive “story”—like walking through scenes of a movie.\n\nSouvenir Book, “Disneyland,” 1955. THF 205152\n\nAnother new idea in Walt’s design was the central “hub,” that led to the park’s four realms, or lands, like spokes of a wheel. Walt felt that this oriented people and saved steps. Check out the circular hub in front of the castle on this map.\n\nDisneyland cup & saucer set, 1955-1960. THF 150182\n\nA third rule-challenging idea in Walt’s plan was the attractor, or “weenie” for each land—in other words, an eye-catching central feature that drew people toward a goal. The main attractor was, of course, Sleeping Beauty Castle.\n\nTo establish cohesive stories for each land, Walt insisted that the elements in them fit harmoniously together—from buildings to signs to trash cans. This idea—later called “theming”—was Walt’s greatest and most unique contribution.\n\nHalsam Products, “Walt Disney’s Frontierland Logs,” 1955-1962. THF 173562\n\nDISNEY INSIDER INFO: This Lincoln Logs set reinforced the look and theming of Frontierland in Disneyland.\n\nWoman’s Home Companion, March 1951. THF 5540\n\nDISNEY INSIDER TRIVIA: Which came first, Disneyland the park, or Disneyland the TV show?\n\nANSWER: To build his park, Walt lacked one important thing—money! So, he took a risk on the new medium of TV. While most Hollywood moviemakers saw TV as a fad or as the competition, Walt saw it as “my way of going direct to the public.” Disneyland the TV show premiered October 27, 1954—with weekly features relating to one of the four lands and glimpses of Disneyland the park being built.\n\nChild’s coonskin cap, 1958-1960. THF 8168\n\nThe TV show was a hit, but never more than when three Davy Crockett episodes aired in late 1954 and early 1955.\n\nSouvenir Book, “Disneyland,” 1955. THF 205153\n\nDisneyland, the park, opened July 17, 1955, to special guests and the media. So many things went wrong that day that it came to be called “Black Sunday.” But Walt was determined to fix the glitches and soon turned things around.\n\nDISNEY INSIDER INFO: For more on “Black Sunday” and the creation of Disneyland, see my blog post, “Happy Anniversary, Disneyland.”\n\nWalt Disney World Magic Kingdom guidebook, 1988. THF 134722\n\nToday, themed environments from theme parks to restaurants to retail stores owe a debt to Walt Disney. Sadly, Walt Disney passed away in 1966. It was his brother Roy who made Walt Disney World in Florida a reality, beginning with Magic Kingdom in 1971.\n\nTorch Lake steam locomotive pulling passenger cars in Greenfield Village, August 1972. THF 112228\n\nDISNEY INSIDER INFO: In an ironic twist, a steam railroad was added to the perimeter of Greenfield Village for the first time during a late 1960s expansion—an attempt to be more like Disneyland!\n\nMarty Sklar speaking at symposium for “Behind the Magic” at Henry Ford Museum, November 11, 1995. THF 12415\n\nIn 2005, The Henry Ford celebrated Disneyland’s 50th anniversary with a special exhibit, “Behind the Magic: 50 Years of Disneyland.” The amazing and talented Marty Sklar, then head of Walt Disney Imagineering, made that possible.\n\nDISNEY INSIDER INFO: Check out this blog post I wrote to honor Marty’s memory when he passed away in 2017.\n\nDuring these unprecedented times, Disneyland has begun its phased reopening. When you feel safe and comfortable going there, I suggest adding it to your must-visit (or must-return) list. When you're there, you can look around for Walt Disney's influences, just like I do.\n\nDonna Braden is Curator of Public Life at The Henry Ford."
