Elias was Irish-Canadian and Flora was of German and English descent. Walt's great-grandfather, Arundel Elias Disney, emigrated from Ireland where he was born in 1801. Arundel was a descendant of Robert d'Isigny, a Frenchman who had traveled to England with William the Conqueror in 1066. The family changed the d'Isigny name to \"Disney\" and settled in the English village now known as Norton Disney, south of the city of Lincoln, in the county of Lincolnshire.\n\nWalter married Lillian M Bounds on 13 July 1925 in Nez Perce, Idaho.[1]\n\nWalt Disney is a cultural icon. He was an American entrepreneur, cartoonist, animator, voice actor, and film producer and known for his influence and contributions to entertainment during the 20th century. In 1923, he and his brother Roy O. Disney co-founded The Walt Disney Company.\n\nWalt and his staff created numerous famous fictional characters including Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy. He was the original voice for Mickey. During his lifetime, he won 22 Academy Awards and received four honorary Academy Awards from a total of 59 nominations, including a record of four in one year.\n\nWalt died from lung cancer on December 15, 1966 in Burbank, California, Just ten days after his 65th birthday. He was buried at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, California [2].\n\nDue to popular demand, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 6-cent stamp in his honor less than two years after his death, at his childhood home of Marceline, Missouri. [3]\n\nFrom 1906-1911, Disney spent his childhood playing on the family farm and learning to draw the barnyard animals. As an adult, he recalled his time in rural Marceline as the happiest years of his life, and even modeled Disneyland’s “Main Street U.S.A.” and the setting of “Lady and the Tramp” after the Missouri town.\n\nHe was posthumously inducted into the California Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\nResearch Notes\n\nPossible Canadian Birth?\n\nThere is a possibility that Walt was born in Ontario. Published material gives comments that Walt is said to have made. Also, the Canadian census of 1861 and 1871 shows that Walt had many relations in Heronia.\n\nIn appendix C of “The True Intrepid: Sir William Stephenson and the unknown agents” by Bill Macdonald, the Canadian author relates an encounter he had with Walt Disney. The two were traveling by train from Washington DC to New York city.\n\n..he thought he was a Canadian as well. He was born in Canada...in Goderich I think. ...on Lake Huron...and he left there at the age of three…\n\nA 1993 Disney biography, by Mark Elliott, implied that Disney was obsessed, much of his life, with not having a birth certificate to verify that he was born in Chicago in 1901. Reportedly, he cut a deal with J. Edgar Hoover to report on Hollywood communists in exchange for Hoover’s help proving his parentage. …\n\nIn the profile of Walt's great-grandfather Arundel Disney, the biography states that : A branch of the family traveled from Ireland (through New York city) to Goderich, Huron County, Ontario.\n\nFrom \"Walt Disney -- the Canadian Connection\": [4]\n\nIn 1834, brothers Robert and Arundel Elias sailed to New York City. The party of seven on board the ship named “New Jersey” included their wives Jane and Maria as well as Francis and Elias, sons of Robert and Jane, and Kepple, son of Arundel Elias and Maria.\n\nElias's great grandparents (Arundel and Maria) setteled in Goderich, Huron South and Walt's father Elias, was born in Morris, Huron North. Elias grew up in Bluevale, Morris, a hamlet near Goderich and he attended the Goderich school.\n\nThe 1861 Morris house shows Walt's father, a 2 year old Elias. When Elias was about 18, his family moved to the United States. There he married and the family lived in several states. It's possible that Walt's parents went to visit with relatives in Huronia. And while there, Walt was born.\n\n1861 Morris house: Caple 28y, Mary 22y, Elias 2y. [5]\n\n1861 Goderich house: Erusidel E 58y, Maria 46y, Mary 22y, Elias 17y, Charolette 11y, Thomas 10y, James 8y, Hariett 5y, Arundel R 3y. [6]\n\nNote: Arundel and Maria must have migrated to Canada West just before their son Robert was born in Godrich in 1837.\n\ncc1871 Morris house: Cathel 37y, Mary 33y, Elias 12y, Robert 9y, Anne 7y, Edward 4y, Bertha 2y.[7]\n\nNote: names are spelled as they appear in the census.\n\nSources\n\n↑ \"Idaho, U.S., County Marriages, 1864-1950\", Original data: Idaho, County Marriages, 1864-1950.
