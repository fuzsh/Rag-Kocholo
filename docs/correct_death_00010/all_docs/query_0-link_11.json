        "text": "On my recent trip to California, I got the opportunity to see some of the best that Disney has to offer. I spent a day at Disneyland and California Adventure {my first visit!}, attended the premiere of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, visited Walt Disneyâ€™s Office and I got to tour the Walt Disney Archives. The Walt Disney Archives is the place where all the history of Disney and, in particular, Walt Disney is kept. If you want to know the true history of the Disney company, then this is the place to go. However, Disney places high regards on its history, so seeing the Walt Disney Archives is not just something anyone can do. Most of the Walt Disney Archives are not open to the public, or at least I donâ€™t think they are. So, the fact that I got to see some of this history with my own eyes is pretty cool if you ask me. I feel quite privileged!\n\nA Visit To The Walt Disney Archives\n\nTo give you a little history of the Walt Disney Archives, they actually began in 1970, shortly after Walt Disneyâ€™s death. His brother, Roy, did not want to see the history of his brotherâ€™s company become mottled or lost somewhere. He wanted to create an archive to commemorate the legacy of Walt Disney and his company. He was pitched the idea by Dave Smith, an employee of the company, and Roy liked Daveâ€™s idea. Dave Smith then began the long and tedious process of archiving everything in Walt Disneyâ€™s Office. And I got the rare opportunity to see some of this eclectic material.\n\nOne of the coolest things that I got to do was hold an original and authentic Oscar! Yes, the gilded statue that is awarded to Academy Award winners, that Oscar! This one was awarded to Walt Disney for White Wilderness in 1958 for Best Documentary. In case you were wondering, the Oscar is pretty heavy, but not real heavy. It weighed a bit more than I expected it too, though. I am guessing the weight was comparable to a bowling ball. So not your everyday trophy. ðŸ˜‰\n\nAnother thing that I saw at the Walt Disney Archives was the first ticket ever sold to Disneyland. It was purchased by Waltâ€™s brother, Roy Disney, to show his support for Disneyland. Little did they know back then that Disneyland would become one of the best theme parks in the world. Looking at that ticket to me was like looking at the first car ever sold or the first ticket on a train ride ever. This is a huge piece of American history.\n\nI also saw several original drawings and sketches of different characters from Disneyâ€™s animated history, in particular Mickey Mouse. Many of them were from Walt Disneyâ€™s original animation team that produced some of the first Disney cartoons and, later on, feature films. This is another piece of American history, especially film history. After all, it was Disney animated films like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Bambi that played huge parts in growing Walt Disneyâ€™s company.\n\nThere were also several collected pieces of Disney history, such as an original map of Disneyland. Throughout the archives there were several different figurines and statues, each representing the beginning of a new idea or era in the Disney legacy.\n\nI also really loved the huge cardboard advertisement for the new movie, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, which featured the characters of all of the filmâ€™s main stars, that we got to see on the way to the Walt Disney Archives Tour.\n\nI have to say that being at the Walt Disney Archives was such an honor. This is a side of the Disney company that only a few people get to see. I have laid my eyes upon some pieces of iconic cinematic history and I can say that I felt a little more connected to Walt Disney and the Disney company after viewing these archives. It was a truly wonderful experience. Thank you, Disney for allowing me this opportunity!"
