In early 1893, the Disney family settled into their new home with their two sons: Herbert and Raymond. Shortly thereafter, their third son, Roy, was born on June 24, 1893.\n\nWalter Elias Disney was born on December 5, 1901, on the second floor.\n\nAnd on December 6, 1903, the Disneys welcomed their fifth child, Ruth.\n\nOn February 10, 1906, Elias sold the property to Walter Chamberlain, moving his family to Marceline, Missouri.\n\nIn 1991, Chicago attempted to designate the property as a historical landmark but the owner fought the designation and won, putting the home at risk of demolition.\n\nThe Present: After years of neglect, the home is purchased with the intent to restore it to its 1901 state. The new owners are working with the City to protect the home forever."
