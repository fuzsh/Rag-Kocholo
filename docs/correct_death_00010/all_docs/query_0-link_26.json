        "text": "While constructing the twenty-five-building Burbank complex, Walt Disney was searching for ways to change the nature of / expand his business. Due to the popularity of his cartoons, children from every corner of the country wrote to Walt, wanting to come to Hollywood and see the place where Mickey Mouse lived. Public demand had already forced some of the other studios to open up the gates to their backlots. By inviting people over to the Burbank complex, Walt could make lots of money. Although, he thought there wouldn't be much to see at the Disney Studios. Tourists would be bored by the painstaking technicalities of animation.\n\nBut a little park, with statues of Mickey and the other characters, with picnic tables, grass and trees. That would be great! A place for all the kids who wanted to meet Mickey. That was what he really wanted. Some kind of high quality family park without \"the typical Midway stuff\". A ideal, imaginary, long ago world that would teach the visitor about the development of American ideas of work, comfort, domesticity and urbanism. An American Tivoli, with strong overtones of Greenfield Village and Colonial Williamsburg. That would be a blast. Walt proposed the lot across the street from the studio as a suitable site. The 'Riverside Drive theme park project' was born.\n\nIn the early fifties, Walt Disney lured Harper Goff away from the Warner Bros. Studio, and assigned him to draw up plans for his \"magical little park\"."
