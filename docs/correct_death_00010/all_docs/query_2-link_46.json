        "text": "Transcript\n\nWalt Disney was an American artist, a film producer, and founder of the entertainment conglomerate the Disney Company.\n\nWalter Elias Disney was born on December 5, 1901, in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nAs he moved around the Midwestern United States with his family, Walt discovered an interest in art.\n\nBy the time he entered high school, he had already sought out a correspondence course and begun to study cartooning.\n\nIn 1922 Walt Disney and the animator Ub Iwerks opened an independent art studio creating short advertisements and comedic sketches.\n\nThough the venture soon shut down, Disney, his brother Roy, and Iwerks started again in California with a new studio creating animated films.\n\nFrom that studio came the idea of a new character...who would later become the iconic Disney Company spokesman Mickey Mouse.\n\nIn 1934 Disney began work on his studio’s first feature-length animated film: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, one of the first-ever projects to prove animation’s capacity for long-form narrative.\n\nSnow White was quickly followed by Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi, and Fantasia—and the opening of a new studio in Burbank to keep up with the demand for new releases.\n\nAfter that small feat of changing the world of film forever, Walt Disney moved to his next big project: Disneyland, a California theme park that opened in 1955.\n\nThough more Disney parks followed—in Florida and overseas—Disneyland was the only one created entirely under the supervision of Walt Disney himself.\n\nWalt Disney died on December 15, 1966, in Los Angeles, California, about a month after undergoing surgery for lung cancer.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, his company would be one of the world’s largest entertainment conglomerates and regularly rank among the top 50 companies in America."
