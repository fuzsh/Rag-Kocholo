Have an account? .\n\nWalt Disney was born on December 5, 1901, in Chicago and died in 1966 in Burbank, California.\n\nThroughout his life, he lived in multiple properties, mainly in California.\n\nHe called his vacation home in Palm Springs, California, his \"Technicolor Dream House.\"\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalt Disney lived from 1901 to 1966. He was born in Chicago, but he spent most of his life in California.\n\nDisney was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1966 and died just months later. Following his death, his brother Roy finished his plan to open Walt Disney World in 1971.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe home has since been renovated and turned into a heritage site called The Walt Disney Birthplace.\n\nThe Walt Disney Birthplace website says, \"We have already lost too many buildings that were an incredibly important part of Walt Disney's history. And that is why we have purchased this house and will restore it to its original state, honoring and preserving the home for generations to come.\"\n\nIt took five years for the home to be renovated to appear as it did in 1893, ABC7 reported in 2018.\n\nThe renovation reportedly cost several hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe bay window looks out over the front porch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisney and his brother Roy shared a bedroom as children.\n\nThe brothers shared a lifelong bond, started in the bedroom pictured above.\n\nWalt Disney moved to Los Angeles in 1923. Four years later, he built this home on Lyric Avenue.\n\nAccording to Los Angeles Magazine, his brother Roy built an identical home next door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1932, Disney and his wife, Lillian, built a family home in Los Feliz, California.\n\nAccording to Disney Examiner, Disney worked with architect Frank Crowhurst to design the Tudor- and French-style home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was last listed in 2014 for $3.65 million.\n\nAccording to Collider, the home cost $50,000 to construct and was built mainly by unemployed Depression-era workers.\n\nThe Disneys lived at the home from 1932 to 1950.\n\nSpecial touches, like the painted ceiling and wrought iron railing, give the home a storybook feel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA spacious dining area shows off the Tudor-style architecture.\n\nDisney lived at the home with his wife and two daughters, Diane and Sharon.\n\nThe billiard room, one of 12 rooms in the house, was no doubt a good place for Disney to unwind.\n\nThere are five Disney resort hotels that have complimentary pool tables.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA spacious master bedroom features French-door windows.\n\nThere are four bedrooms in the home.\n\nThe private screening room, pictured below, was where Disney watched many of his films, according to the home's most recent listing.\n\nThe Disney family would come together to watch movies and screenings from the studio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of Disney's most famous films were released while he lived in his Los Feliz home.\n\n\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" was released in 1937, \"Pinocchio\" was released in 1940, \"Fantasia\" was released in 1940, \"Dumbo\" was released in 1941, \"Bambi\" was released in 1942, and \"Cinderella\" was released in 1950.\n\nDetails like this storybook ceiling make the home look like something out of a Disney movie.\n\nThe room looks like it could be right out of \"Sleeping Beauty,\" which, according to Collider, was imagined while Disney lived in the home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe home featured a playhouse for Disney's daughters, Diane and Sharon.\n\nAccording to Glamour, the pool pictured above is not the home's original pool and was constructed in 1963, after the Disneys lived there. Disney's original pool was on a lower tier of the property that was sold, and it still remains on that piece of land.\n\nDisney built his vacation home in Palm Springs in 1962 as a retreat for him and his wife, Lillian.\n\nHe lived in the home with Lillian until his death in 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe called it his \"Technicolor Dream House.\" It sold last year for $1.1 million.\n\nIt sold in May 2020.\n\nThe interior features bright red accents.\n\nHe didn't call it his \"Technicolor Dream House\" for nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe home's many windows allow for light to flow throughout.\n\nThe dining area opens right up to the backyard.\n\nThe one-story home has four bedrooms.\n\nBright accent walls keep with the technicolor theme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe master bedroom features shiny gold furniture and a blue accent wall.\n\nIt also has a sliding door to the backyard.\n\nThe large open floor plan has lots of space for entertaining.\n\nThe living room has its own bar area as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA spacious kitchen has a nice view of the pool.\n\nThe black and white kitchen is perhaps the most muted room in the home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalt Disney's final home was his Carolwood Estate, where he lived until his death in 1966. The home has since been torn down.\n\nAbove he can be seen riding a train outside his Carolwood home. He built the one-eighth scale train and named it the Carolwood Pacific Railroad.\n\nJust over a year after Lillian's death in 1997, businessman Gabriel Brener bought the property for $8.45 million and knocked down the home. In its place, he built a 35,000-square-foot mansion in 2001. The eight-bedroom mansion, which sits on 3.6 acres of land, sold in 2014 for $74 million, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead next\n\nAdvertisement"
