        "text": "Saved from demolition, Walt’s first studio in Southern California was behind his Uncle’s Home. This stop is subject to availability.\n\nWe’ll see Walt Disney’s Star along Hollywood Blvd and other memorable places including the Pantages Theater.\n\nWe make sure you get a fun photo with this iconic landmark.\n\nWalts’ work started in the barn, then moved to the small storefront, then on to Hyperion Studios and finally, to this Grand Studio in Burbank. Although we can’t go inside (yet), we have a photo stop here!\n\nSit where Walt sat as he watched his daughters ride this amazing piece of history. There are still photos of Walt here, where he dreamed of a place where parents and children could play, together. EDIT JANUARY 2024: DUE TO MECHANICAL AND OTHER ISSUES, THE CAROUSEL HAS NOT BEEN OPERATING. WE WILL BE MONITORING PROGRESS AND WILL GET YOU THERE IF IT IS OPEN!\n\nSee Walt’s’ favorite table and sit in the same room where he ate lunch almost every day in the historic Tam O’Shanter restaurant!\n\nYour lunch at the Tam O’Shanter Restaurant is covered, up to $25 per person!\n\nA very special opportunity to pay our respects to Walt and his family, who gave so much to mankind (when we wrote that sentence – it really hit us… he wasn’t just a man who gave to his city or state or even Country – Mr Disney is truly a Citizen of the Entire World who impacted and continues to impact lives). An amazing opportunity to have a few quiet moments in a truly beautiful Memorial Park.\n\nWalt Disney, of course, never saw this building in person and may never have dreamed that such a Grand Building would bear his name but it truly is a Grand Edifice and we’d like you to have the chance for a photo so we’ll make a quick stop here!"
