Over the past week, we’ve been joining in on the celebration of the 100 Years of Wonder campaign with an intimate look at the personal space of Walt Disney in his office on the Walt Disney Studio lot in Burbank, California! Check out our full coverage below which includes a look at his secretary’s office, his formal office, his working office, and his private living area and kitchen.

The permanent exhibition of Walt Disney’s office spaces are only accessible by special invite-only tours for D23 members (and other special guests) and first reopened as an exhibit in 2016. We had a chance to tour the space for ourselves in 2018.

The office itself is located in the Animation building at the Walt Disney Studio. Suite 3H is the exact location on the third floor and was occupied by Walt Disney from 1940 until his death in 1966. Come with us now as we take a step inside Walt Disney’s office at the Walt Disney Studio in Burbank, CA!
