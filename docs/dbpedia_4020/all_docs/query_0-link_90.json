        "text": "Lebanon is an exception in the Middle East.\n\nThe country of the Cedars of God, which is experiencing a very deep political and social crisis leading to the resignation of Prime Minister Saad Hariri, has a strong Christian community.\n\nFor a population estimated at 6.1 million by the CIA’s World Factbook, Christians number about 36 percent, including nearly one million faithful belonging to the Maronite Church, not to mention the diaspora of about 3 million people.\n\nThey are the disciples of Saint Maron, a monk and hermit, who died around 423.\n\nThese Christians date back to historical Syria, to the Patriarchate of Antioch, one of the three patriarchates of the early Church, along with Rome and Alexandria.\n\nThey took refuge in the Lebanese mountains at the time of the Muslim invasion in the 7th century and were constituted as Patriarchates in 685.\n\nThe Maronite Church is an exception among Eastern Churches, marked by separations and reunifications but always remaining united with Rome. Heir to a line of 76 patriarchs, Béchara Boutros Raï was appointed head of the Maronite Church in March 2011. He was made a cardinal the next year.\n\nTheir West Syriac rite, is one of the oldest Eastern rites. Maronite Christians, who represent one of the largest Christian communities in the East, celebrate mainly in Arabic.\n\nThe Patriarch supports the demonstrators\n\nWhile popular protest so far seems to have ignored the communities, Cardinal Raï quickly gave his support to the demonstrators.\n\n“My throat is tightened as I follow events in Lebanon,” he said in a homily in Nigeria before rushing back to Lebanon. “Our people are victims of a bad policy, which has led them to hunger, while new taxes are exhausting them.”\n\nA few days later, on Oct. 23, at the end of a meeting in Bkerke, at the headquarters of the Maronite Patriarchate, the Maronites united with Orthodox and Protestant leaders to support the demonstrators and call on the government to react quickly and vigorously.\n\nThis position is all the more significant as Maronites are very involved in the protest movement, as Karim Émile Bitar of the Institute of Political Science at Saint-Joseph University in Beirut explained.\n\nCriticism of 'confessionalism'\n\n“Very large-scale demonstrations are taking place in regions that are predominantly Christian,” he said.\n\n“It is often mistakenly believed that Maronites are all privileged. The poverty rate is worrying in some areas, such as the mountains.\n\n“Recently, a Maronite sacrificed himself because he could not pay his daughter’s school fees. The demonstrations go beyond the communities, people take to the streets not as Maronites, Sunni or Shia but as Lebanese.”\n\nNevertheless, among the Maronites, a certain fear emerges regarding the radical criticism of the “confessionalism” that structures Lebanon’s political life.\n\nSince 1943, the country has had a distribution of power. The Maronites, who were in the majority at the time, held the presidency of the Republic, while Sunni Muslims held the position of prime minister and Shiites the presidency of the National Assembly, whose seats were equally divided between confessions.\n\nFor Father Fadi Elmir, parish priest of Notre-Dame-du-Liban parish in Paris, the end of confessionalism is frightening. What are the alternatives?\n\n“There is the fear of entering a new confessional war and the fear of the influence of Islamism that could transform our Constitution,” he asserted.\n\n“Lebanon is the only country in the region with a Christian president, where one can live in freedom and in a climate of Islamic-Christian conviviality. Many Muslims also do not want to lose this Lebanese identity.”"
