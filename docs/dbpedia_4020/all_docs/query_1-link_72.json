        "text": "On October 25, 1919, the Peace Conference assembled in Paris attended to a most extraordinary event: a delegation of black-clad, long-bearded Oriental bishops, under the command of the Patriarch of Antioch, Iliyas Huwayyik, pleaded vehemently and successfully, after long months of backstage manoeuvring, for the independence and territorial enlargement of Lebanon. The definitive establishment of Greater Lebanon, on September 1, 1920, seemed, thus, to fulfil the historic aspirations of the Maronite Church and community, which had been striving, for well over a century, for the creation of a sovereign, Christian State on its traditional homeland. By then, the Church was accompanied by a secular élite that defended Lebanese statehood in the distinctively cosmopolitan terms of their rediscovered Phoenician heritage. In spite of their apparent intellectual humanism, theirs remained, nevertheless, an essentially Christian vision of Lebanon, possessing full identity with the Church’s idea of the country as a Christian fortress “within a sea of Arab-Muslim hostility”. The creation of the Lebanese state and, later on, full-blown independence was, paradoxically, a mixed blessing for the Maronite Church, which receded into relative obscurity, leaving the centre of the stage to lay politicians, who were able to reach a modus vivendi with Lebanese Muslims, enshrined in the famous National Pact. However, their inability to cope with the consequences of the Civil War (1975-1990) led to a renewed prominence of the Church both during the conflagration and in its aftermath. This presentation will examine these historical episodes while trying to prove that the Maronite Church conceives of herself as the ultimate deposit of the true Lebanese identity, whose defence, whenever such an identity is threatened by internal or foreign forces, is the ultimate ratio for her involvement in the political – and military – arena."
