        "text": "Q?\n\nAre you Catholic?\n\nA.\n\nYes! The Catholic Church is made up of 24 self-governing Churches, the largest being the Latin Church which many people call the 'Roman Catholic Church.' The other 23 Churches originate in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Africa, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia. Each of these Eastern Catholic Churches is led by a Patriarch or Major Archbishop who is the head of the Synod of Bishops. Each of these Patriarchs is in communion with the Pope of Rome, meaning each of these 23 Eastern Churches is in communion with the Bishop of Rome as well.\n\nQ?\n\nWhat is the Maronite Church?\n\nA.\n\nThe Antiochene Syriac Maronite Church, or the Maronite Church for short, is the third largest Eastern Catholic Church. The Maronite Church descends from the Church of Antioch and the followers of St. Maron, a 4th century ascetic who lived in the mountains of Syria. St. Maron's followers eventually erected a Monastery in his honor on the Orontes River in Syria. The Christians of rural Syria surrounding this monastery would become known as Maronites. The modern Maronite Church is led by its patriarch who resides in Bkerke, Lebanon. The Maronite Church can be found in Lebanon, Syria, the Holy Land, Europe, Africa, South America, Australia, and throughout North America. There are two eparchies (dioceses) for the Maronite Church in the United States. Our Eparch (bishop) resides in Brooklyn, NY and his territory consists of the entire Eastern seaboard of the United States.\n\nQ?\n\nDo I fulfill my Sunday obligation at your church?\n\nA.\n\nYes! You may fulfill your obligation to attend liturgy at any Catholic Church. This includes any of the Eastern Catholic Churches as well.\n\nQ?\n\nMay I receive communion at your church?\n\nA.\n\nAll Catholics who are properly disposed to receive communion are welcome to receive at our liturgies. Communion is distributed in both kinds via intinction (the Host is dipped in the Blood) and placed on the tongue of the communicant.\n\nQ?\n\nI only speak english. Can I understand your liturgy?\n\nA.\n\nAbsolutely, our Saturday Evening liturgy is primarily in english and our Sunday Morning liturgy has a mixture of English, Arabic, and Syriac. There are books with translations for you to follow along with all of the parts of our liturgy. All are welcome!\n\nQ?\n\nAre you part of the Diocese of Syracuse?\n\nA.\n\nNo, though we are geographically located in the Diocese of Syracuse, our parish is led by the Maronite Bishop of the Eparchy of St. Maron of Brooklyn. The Bishop of Syracuse is in communion with our bishop and we have a fraternal working relationship with the diocese."
