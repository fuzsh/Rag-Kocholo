        "text": "By @HorLevnon\n\nEvery year, Phoenicians used to go to Afqa on religious pilgrimage via Adon valley to celebrate the death and resurrection of their youth-God Adon. These pilgrimages/festivals were known as the “Adonites” due to their rituals and rites which expressed fertility and renewed youth. The Phoenicians of this region, the first Maronites of Mt Lebanon. St. Abraham reached Afqa, and Akoura in particular, via the road between Yammoune (Bekaa Valley) and Akoura. He came as a walnut merchant. The river that flows from the Akoura-Tannourine mountain is called “Walnut River” (Nahr El-Jauz) today.\n\nAround 638, a new theological creed appeared in the East and it further compounded the dissensions among Christians. It was based on the principle of the “one will of Christ with His dual nature .”\n\nIn 680 a 6th Ecumenical Council was convened in Constantinople and decreed that Christ had 2 wills. The Maronite Church agreed with this 6th Council’s decision as they had previously agreed with the Chalcedonian Dogma. These religious and political strifes nourished the Maronite’s sense of independence. They opposed the intervention of the Byzantine Court in the affairs of the Church. Rome encouraged this trend and gradually, Maronites rebelled against the politics of the Byzantine regime, which had compromised their freedoms and independence. The Maronite Church was seeking to free itself from Byzantine rule, maintain faithfulness to the Pope, while respecting traditions and dogmas of the Church of Antioch.\n\nThe Mardaites and their resistance\n\nBetween 660–690, a militant movement appeared from Amanos and northern Syria down to the mountains of Galilee with Lebanon as its main stronghold. The Byzantines organized this movement to fight the Islamic Umayyads that had been set up as a result of the Arabo-Islamic invasion of the region. This militant movement organized groups of warriors known as ‘Jarajima’ (named after the city of Jarjouma near Antioch).\n\n“The Marada” as Byzantine historians referred to “Jarajima”, merged with the natives of Syria and Lebanon to form a strong army against the Arab Umayyad regime. This merger was accelerated by the fact that both groups spoke Syriac and were Christian, interested in defending themselves from the expansionism of the recently arrived Arabo-Islamic regime. Maronite Marada caused tremendous damage to the Umayyad regime. Mo’awiya, the Umayyad Caliph, was forced to sign a peace treaty with the Marada and with the Byzantine King in which the Arab leader was forced to pay a huge ransom of 3,000 golden dinars annually, 50 Arabian horses and to set free 8,000 prisoners of war. When Abdul Malek Bin Marwan became Caliph In 685, the Maronite Maradas renewed their attacks against the Arabo-Islamic empire from the Lebanese mountains with an army of more than 30,000 strong.\n\nThe Umayyad Caliph and Justinian II signed a treaty in which the Byzantine Empire withheld his support to the Marada and agreed to exile 25,000 of them to Armenia in Asia Minor. In return, the Umayyad Caliph agreed to pay 1,000 gold dinars per week, half of the revenues of Cyprus and to offer a horse and a slave per day to the Byzantine Emperor (Dau, B. The History of the Maronites p.216).\n\nThis treachery dealt the Maronite resistance forces a great blow and deepened their resentment against the Byzantine Empire. At the same time, it deepened their sense of independence and desire to liberate the Antioch Church from Byzantine influence.\n\nThis division helped lead to the eventual 1054 A.D. succession of the Byzantine Church from Rome. Despite this 1054 A.D. succession from Rome the Maronite Church remained faithful to the Petrine Office and the Church of Rome.\n\nAfter the fall of the Islamic Umayyads and the rise of the Islamic Abassids in 750 A.D. and continuing into the time of the Crusades, Lebanon and the East in general suffered from instability and turmoil. The neighboring states of the Byzantines, Seljuk Turks and Fatamids fought over this land and exchanged control over it several times (Boulos, J. — History of Lebanon, Beirut 1972, p 273).\n\nDuring this period the Maronites remained in the relative safety and protection of Lebanon the Mountain and managed to maintain relative autonomy.\n\n“The owners of vast estates in Lebanon, gauded by a desire to become military leaders over their farmers, formed with the encouragement of the clergy, a Maronite nation with a feudal hierarchy. This nation had a strong patriotic feeling, which often manifested itself in times of distress and in support of their Patriarch” (Ristelhueber, R. — Les Traditions Francaises au Liban, Paris, p 19–20).\n\nP. Raphael a historian on Lebanon said “The clergy worked hard to effect spiritual and cultural renovation…they founded a free village school next to each monastery, in the shadow of each church, in the shadow of each oak tree”.\n\nLammens an observer wrote, “The Maronites were a simplistic people woring, praying, living in peace and dying in grace…This is how they formed themselves. A people serene as their azure and yet hard and tough as the rocks of Lebanon…This is how they chiseled their Mountain and founded a nation.”\n\nThe Maronites tilled the land and turned the rugged terrain of Lebanon into a prosperous one. This prosperity was also spiritual in that countless hermits lived in Mount Lebanon as attested by many historians such as Ibn Kutaiba, Al-Makdassi and others (Hayek, P.M. — Dictionnaire de Spiritualite Asceticque et Mystique — Les Maronites Vol X p 631–644).\n\nMoreover, Lebanon became a refuge not just for the Maronite but also for other Christian Churches of the region persecuted by Islamic powers. The persecutions of Christians of the Holy Land contributed to the launching of the Crusades by European Christians in order to retake the Holy Land back from the Islamic conquerors.\n\nThe Maronites and the European Crusades\n\nThe Crusaders invaded the MidEast under the pretense of protecting the Holy Land and securing the rights of Europeans to make pilgrimages. When the Crusaders reached Arka in 1099, the Maronites were there to welcome them. Jack DiVitri wrote at the time,\n\n“Over the Lebanese hills in Phoenicia, near Byblos, there were multitudes of Christian people well trained in archery. They were called the Maronites, fellow members of the Catholic Church united to Rome.” (Mahfouz, P.J. — ”History of the Maronite Church” imp. pauliste, 1984,p87).\n\nWilliam the Latin Catholic Bishop of Tyre wrote,\n\n“The Maronites were a great and valiant force against the enemies of Christendom.”\n\nFurthermore in 1250 A.D. Maronites assisted Louis IX with 25,000 men strong. King Louis wrote to the Maronite Prince his gratitude, love and admiration for the Maronites’ fidelity to the Popes of Rome, he also stated France’s unwavering support for them (Moubarak, Ab, Y. “Pentalogie Maronite — De S. Louis a Gen. DeGaulle” p771). St Louis had an official regal chartre drawn concerning France’s protection and favor upon the Maronites of Lebanon. It read:\n\n“Chartre of King Louis, King of France, Given to the Maronites, at St Jean D’Acre on May 24 1250 A.D. From Louis the King of France to the Prince of the Maronites of Lebanon and to the Patriarch and Bishops of the Maronite nation. Our hearts were filled with great joy when we saw Simon, your son, coming to us leading 25,000 men strong showing us your feelings of fraternity, friendship and bearing great gifts to us. The bond we first felt with the Maronites in Cyprus is now doubly reinforced here in Lebanon. And we have come to feel as though the Maronite nation, under the guidance of St. Maron, has come to be one in spirit with the French nation because the love and fraternity shown by your people to our people is as strong as the bond that the French feel among each other. Subsequently, it is only just that you be favored with the same rights, privileges and protection that we provide to our own nation. That is why we exhort you, most noble Prince of the Maronites, to do your utmost in serving the welfare of your people and that you seek out only the most noble of men to rule amongst the Maronite people as is done in France. As to you oh kind Patriarch, Bishops, leaders and Maronite people, our hearts rejoice in contemplating the great faith and fervor with which you uphold the Catholic faith and remain in allegiance with the Roman Vicar of Christ, the Pope, the successor of St Peter. We exhort you to maintian this unshakable faith and allegiance. As for us and our successors to the French Throne, we promise to give you and the Maronite nation our special protection just as we provide it to our own French people. And we shall do everything in our power to add to your well-being and prosperity in all circumstances. Stated May 24th, 1250 in the 24th year of our reign in St Jean D’Acre.”\n\nDuring the European Crusades, relations between Lebanon and Europe were restored after five centuries of suspension and cultural isolation. Once again the Lebanese were ready to ascertain their four-thousand year old cultural vigor and active transaction with the rest of the Mediterranean world. The Crusaders lived in tens of fortresses in Lebanon like that of Sidon, Beaufort, Messeilha. Their back up fort was the “Christian Fort” in Mount Lebanon.\n\nIn 1137 the Maronites of Jibbet Bcharre, led the Turkish Prince of Aleppo and his army through their rugged terrain to Tripoli which permitted him to conquer the Crusaders there and capture their prince. The Crusaders’ retaliation precipitated grave animosities. In 1145 the Patriarch, Luke Bnahrini, residing in Yanouh and leading the Maronites of Jibbet Bishareh, Jbeil and Batroun, refused to receive the Papal envoy (Carali, P.B. — ” Les Guerres des Mokadams” — p. 160).\n\nThis rift eventually ended in 1182 and later on, the Maronite Patriarch Jeremiah al-Amishiti participated in the Council of Latran in 1215. During the Council of Latran the 4th Crusade was launched to free the Holy Land from its occupiers. Their enemies capitalized on the temporary dissension between the 2 groups. Prince of Aleppo NourEdine Zinki conquered Mouneitra Fort in the Jbeil region in 1165 and Salah Eddine el Ayoubi reached Mouneitra in 1186.\n\nIn 1215, the Maronite Patriarch Jermiah Al-Amshiti who had his Seat in Our Lady of Ilije Monastery, recieved a letter of confirmation from Pope Innocent III, that sealed again the ties between the Holy See of Rome and the Maronite Patirarchy after the Maronite revolt of Jibbet Bishareh."
