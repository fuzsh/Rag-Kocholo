        "text": "BETH KERKE, Lebanon — The Syriac Maronite Patriarchate in Lebanon organized a synod for women on Saturday which focused on women’s presence and mission in the Church and society. Under the patronage and presence of Syriac Maronite Patriarch Mor Beshara Boutros al-Raï, and organized by the Women’s Pastoral Office in the patriarchate, the work of the Synod on Women was launched at the Patriarchal headquarters in Beth Kerke (Bkerke).\n\nAfter some words of welcome, a documentary film was shown on the history of the synodal procession for women, then the work of the Synod was launched with the presence of delegates from monastic orders and dioceses in Lebanon, the patriarchate, and the Maronite community.\n\nDuring the work of the Synod, the role of women in the Church and society was discussed from different angles based on theological and philosophical ideas.\n\nThe Synod organizers emphasized that equality can only be achieved by rejecting traditional patterns of religious and social institutions, and this oppression that women still suffer from is based on wrong religious concepts, traditions and justifications that should not be ignored anymore, but rather must be confronted, as systematic violence and discrimination against women plague many societies today in the Middle East.\n\nThen there was a speech by Patriarch al-Raï in which he said, “Women are at the heart of God’s plan of salvation, and based on this presence, we proceed with this synod in order to continue our reading and strengthen women’s presence in the church and society.” The Patriarch concluded with a special prayer for women."
