        "text": "An open house held by Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Seminary on St. Maron’s Feast day in 1962 provided the spark for the formation of a parish community in the nation’s capital. From that time until today, the House of Maron in Washington, DC has been an active ecclesial and cultural presence.\n\nAfter the establishment of the Maronite Apostolic Exarchate in Detroit, Michigan, Washington DC’s Maronite community was established canonically under the Exarchate in 1966 with Bishop Francis M. Zayek as Ordinary. Monsignor Elias El- Hayek, the first rector of Our Lady of Lebanon Seminary, was appointed administrator of the officially established new parish.\n\nBefore 1966, the Maronite community used the facilities of Our Lady of Lebanon Seminary for parish activities and the conduct of its liturgical life. After its establishment, the parish continued to use the facilities of the Seminary until 1976, when Bishop Zayek dedicated a combination of the new Church and hall. This building is the Church currently in use by the parish.\n\nFour priests have occupied the pastoral chair of Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Church since its founding. Monsignor Elias EI-Hayek served from 1961 to 1967 both as pastor and rector of the Seminary. Monsignor Seely Beggiani was pastor from 1967 to 1979 and, like Monsignor EI-Hayek, held the position of Seminary rector at the same time. Monsignor Hector Y. Doueihi (now Bishop of the Eparchy of St. Maron) served as pastor from 1979 to 1987. During that period, Monsignor Doueihi was also the Diocesan Director of Liturgy. Chorbishop Dominic F. Ashkar led the parish since 1987 and served concurrently as Diocesan Director of Religious Education. On September 1, 2018, Chorbishop Ashkar retired due to canonical age, and Msgr. George M. Sebaali became the Pastor.\n\nOver the years, the Washington, DC, Maronite community has been visited by many dignitaries from the Eastern and Western Churches: distinguished members of the United States and foreign governments; papal nuncios; ambassadors and other officials of the diplomatic corps; university presidents and outstanding names in various academic fields; and well-known names in many different professional areas. Special moments in the life of the community include:"
