        "text": "Theology means nothing if it is not first believed, then lived. It arises out of faith. For the Eastern Traditions theology is more along the lines of expressing the faith by prayerful reflection on the mysteries of the personal commitment to the Lord, illumined by the light of the Holy Spirit. That is why the works of the Eastern Fathers have always read like pastoral and homiletic commentaries rather technical discussions of ‘’theological’’ subjects.\n\nOne of the key ideas in Maronite spirituality is that God is mysterious and unknowable in Himself. Maronites reverence the Lord as the Holy One in their ‘’Service of Mysteries’’. The concept of Mystery sets the perspective of awe and worship, recognizes the Lord as the Creator-Father and professes the unworthiness of the creature before the Source of his being.\n\nGod does not remain hidden. Maronites recognize the Lord as the ‘’Lover of Mankind’’. As God sent his Word to dwell with us, so that Word reveals the Father who visits his people in mercy.\n\nThe Maronites are the heirs of the literary inheritance bequeathed by the Fathers such as: Aphraates 345AD, Rabboula 430AD, Isaac the Syrian 459AD, Narsai 507AD, St James of Sarug 522AD, and others.\n\nThe figure of the Maronite Patriarch is very important for the Maronites. He is the symbol of their unity. Along with the Pope of Rome, he is named in the Intercessions at every Mass.\n\nAfter St Maroun, the pious Maronite hermits strove for union with God through a solitary and austere life, along with a spiritual and pastoral ministry to the pilgrim visitors.\n\nThe starting point of them was the Word of God, a Word that calls, invites, and personally summons, as happened to the Apostles.\n\nThey transformed rock into fertile soil, in which they grew wheat and other grains. Their lives of prayer, abstinence, and their retreat from the world into the solitude of grottos, rock-hewn shelters, caves, and hermitages did not insulate them from the concerns and suffering of their fellow man. On the contrary, their awareness was heightened; the days and nights of these hermits were spent in prayer and chanting, meditation, penances and physical labour to achieve a close union with God for their own salvation and of the world.\n\nThis spirituality of austerity and frugality inspired their daily life and opened the door to a life of simplicity, a vision of hope, an attitude of readiness, and marked Maronite spirituality with a missionary spirit. The Maronite people did not discover Christ through philosophy, but rather through the patrimonial faith of their ancestors, their Saints from Maroun to Nemetallah.\n\nMaronite spirituality is distinguished by fervent Marian devotion. Blessed Mary is mentioned in every liturgy. The Maronite people strive to imitate the Blessed Virgin of the Scriptures who lived a life of silent adoration of her Divine Son, all the while pondering the meaning of His life ‘’in her heart’’ (Lk 2;19).\n\nBecause they are a community under persecution from their early days up to now, they take refuge under Mary’s protection, they call her Mother of life, Mother of light, hailing her strength and fidelity in the life of the ‘’Cedar of Lebanon.’’ The Rosary has been a favorite prayer of Maronites for centuries."
