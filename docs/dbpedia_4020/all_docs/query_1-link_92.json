        "text": "I am Deacon Elias Hazkial, born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. Although Detroit is known as the \"Motor City,\" we don't only make cars in Michigan. We also make priests!\n\nI am honored to follow in the paths of our treasured Maronite priests from Michigan: Bishop Gregory Mansour, Chorbishop Richard Saad, Father Vincent Farhat, Father George Hajj, and Father Tony Massad. I also follow in the path of my great-grandfather Tobias Harb, who was a priest in Lebanon and built the church in our hometown of Mchikha, in the Matn region.\n\nI am looking forward to joining my predecessors and my ordination to the holy priesthood on Saint Elias Feast Day of next year, God willing: July 20, 2025. But there is a long road behind me that leads to this point in life. By the color of my beard, it is obvious that I was up to something else before I got here. The truth is, priesthood was never in my scope during my youth nor as a young adult. I entered the seminary at age 37, after two short yet accomplished careers in both civil law and automotive engineering.\n\nmy professional successes, our Lord Jesus Christ planted in my heart the burning desire to drop my work and follow him, as the Apostles James and John did. Well, not completely drop my old work: I am being sent to Rome next Fall for further education in Eastern Canon (Church) Law. So, I will pick up legal practice once again. And I still enjoy tinkering with cars when I get the chance....\n\nI am deeply grateful for your warm and sincere welcome to Minneapolis! I have heard so many great things about St. Maron's from past seminarians and priests, and now I get to experience it for myself. I know this summer will fly, but I am excited to serve you and to get to know you in the short time we will have together.\n\nMy name is Fr. Youssef Barakat. Iâm from Zgharta, North Lebanon and a priest in Ehden-Zgharta, where I was born and raised.\n\nI was ordained a priest on Sunday, February 7, 2016 , by Bishop Paul Abdel Sater. I am one of six siblings (3 boys and 3 girls). My mother raised us when my father passed away 30 years ago. We all live together in Zgharta, except for one brother, who lives in Spain.\n\nPrior to becoming a priest, I was a soccer player for the Lebanon National Team. When I felt God was calling me to the priesthood, I was serving the elderly, the poor, and the disabled (physically and mentally).\n\nHelp the Needy - Talitha Cumi\n\nGod blesses those who come to the aid of the poor and rebukes those who turn away from them: \"Give to him who begs from you, do not refuse him who would borrow from you\"; \"you received without pay, give without pay.\" It is by what they have done for the poor that Jesus Christ will recognize his chosen ones. When \"the poor have the good news preached to them,\" it is the sign of Christ's presence.\n\nContinue bringing food and items for FOOD SHELVES and gently-used clothing, household supplies (paper goods, cleaning items), new baby items (diapers, clothing, formula, food, blankets, etc.), and new school supplies. Letâs bring throughout winter. Jackets, mittens, scarves, socks, hats and boots also if you have them to share.\n\nWhatever gets unused in your closets can be deeply appreciated and well-used by the needy. For any large items to donate, please contact Joannie Moses.\n\nThank you for your generosity!"
