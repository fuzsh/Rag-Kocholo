Is the video points out in the aftermath of World War II Syria and Lebanon were French mandates used for over 20 years. The very constitution of Lebanon is from France itself. It can also be noted that the French legacy in Lebanon as well as a Catholic legacy goes back to the eras of the crusades. There are to this day ancient Catholic churches in France that go back centuries.\n\nFrench and Arabic are used in conversation by local Lebanese. This makes Lebanon sort of unique in the modern era and that the European influence is very heavily felt compared to say the gulf countries or say Iraq or Iran. It's a interesting situation because you see the French words in Arabic words used in the same sentences by local Lebanese people to this day. It may be there for that Lebanon has the most European influence at least the most French influence of all the middle eastern countries in mind.\n\nThe French Empire once controlled parts of the Middle East such as in Syria and Lebanon.

For anyone who does not know it should be Maronite.

Its official name is the Kataeb Party. There is a relationship between the two as Maronites do make up the bulk of its membership.\n\nWiki has a fairly decent article on the party.\n\nNapoleon III had saved the christians of Liban,the \"maronites\",in 1860-1861.There were since the years 1820 economics rivalities between the maronites,specialized in the agriculture,and the druzes,specialized in the breeding.\n\nRecording that his uncle Napoleon Ist,was interested by Egyptia and Syria,occupied by the turkish empire,Napoleon III decided to react after the slaughters of Lebanon and Syria,more than 20 000 victims,and the atrocities commited against the women and children.\n\nConforted by his victory in Crimea (1854-1856) Napoleon III solicited and obtained an international agreement (Austria,Prusia,UK,Russia) to send a division (general in chief Beaufort d Hautpoul,general en second Ducrot) to Beyrouth.The campaign was easy,and the sultan obliged the murderers to retreat in their mountains.\n\nThe links go back to Francis 1st in the early 16th century , as an opponent of Charles quint he entered in some understanding with the Ottomans\n\nto provide a fig leaf of respectability for siding with the Muslim enemy he proclaimed himself \"protector\" of the Christians churches in the East\n\nLouis XIV did the same , for about the same reasons\n\nNapoleon III got into a tiff with Russia about who exactly was the \"protector\" it became one of the reasons for the Crimean war\n\nFrance had a lot of cultural influence all through the Near and Middle East as the fount of culture , Prussia as the fount of military excellence while Britain was famed as the fount of treachery\n\nthe British and French during WW1 divided the Ottoman carcass with the Sykes Picot agreement , Britain got Palestine and Iraq , France got Lebanon and Syria"
