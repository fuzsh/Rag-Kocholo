Established over 30 years ago, the Maronite Catholic Society is an incorporated Maronite organisation with an utmost concern to assist the Eparchy in promoting our Maronite tradition and heritage.

The Maronite Catholic Society works alongside of the Maronite Bishop to fulfil the Eparchy’s vision at all levels, be it, to sow the Maronite spirit in the minds and hearts of the upcoming generations.

The Society works:

On the Lebanese level, in fostering vital links with the cultural roots of our ancestors.

On the Australian level, in nurturing inculturation of Maronite values into the Australian society,

And on the Eastern level, in encouraging dialogue with the other Eastern Churches.

The Society’s patronage to Diocesan events and activities is a sign of its members’ passion to their tradition and their eagerness to perpetuate their Maronite faith.
