Barbara Bryne, Allan Corduner, Dennis Creaghan, Randall Newsome, Charlotte Parry, and Henry Stram will star in Harold Pinter’s The Birthday Party at the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, New Jersey. The production, which will run, September 8-October 15, will be directed by Emily Mann, the McCarter’s artistic director. It will open officially on September 15.

The play, which concerns the menacing goings-on in an English boarding house, was first seen in London in 1958, where it had a short-lived run. However, a 1960 British television production was watched by more than 11 million viewers and cemented the play’s reputation. The play was produced on Broadway in 1967, with a cast including Ed Flanders and Henderson Forsythe, and William Friedkin made a film version in 1968 starring Robert Shaw and Patrick Magee.

The show’s creative team includes Eugene Lee (sets), Jennifer von Mayrhuaser (costumes), and Jeff Croiter (lighting). Mann received a Tony Award nomination for her direction of Having Our Say and directed the Broadway production of Anna in the Tropics.
