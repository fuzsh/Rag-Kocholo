        "text": "When FF2's managing editor Jan Lisa Huttner wrote her recent review of the Israeli film BEAUFORT, she referred to Robert Shaws memorable performance as Quint in the film JAWS. As this is the 30th anniversary of that great actor/playwright/novelists death (at the tragically young age of 51), she has asked us to write a tribute to Shaw and discuss our favorites among his films. To do so, we have just re-watched several of his best-loved movies and selected the ones each of us likes best.\n\n(Sharon): A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS, a lushly photographed version of the hit Broadway play (which ran from 1961-1963 and took Tony Awards for best play, actor [Paul Scofield] and director), still astonishes us with the beauty of its sets and costumes and delights us with its well-drawn characters and intelligent dialogue. One of my favorite all-time movie scenes-and my favorite Robert Shaw performance-is King Henry VIIIs arrival at Sir Thomas Mores home, leaping from his boat into the mud of the river and roaring with laughter about it, then sitting down under a tree to have a word with More before lunch. The friendly banter turns sour when More wont support his divorce and remarriage, and the king abruptly heads for the boat again, his entourage scurrying after him. This is the turning point of the film, when More loses the kings favor and is punished for it. The consequences are sad indeed.\n\n(Alan): A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS was powerful the first time around, but now it seems somewhat trite, stagy, stiff and pretentious. And it is a lot of drama about a who-the-hell-cares issue: whether Sir Thomas More should recognize Henry VIIIs divorce of his first wife, which the rest of the country had already accepted. Shaw chews up the scenery with panache in his only scene, and the late Paul Scofield (see his Tribute here) is magnificent as Sir Thomas More.\n\nRobert Shaw, Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss (L-R) in a scene from JAWS.\n\nPhoto supplied by WENN/NewsCom\n\n(Sharon): As I said in our recent tribute to Roy Scheider, although JAWS isnt the scare-fest it was in 1975, its still fun to watch. Roy Scheider is the glue that holds the story together. He is so honest and believable in the role of the sheriff that you forget hes acting and worry for his welfare. On the other hand, Robert Shaws boat captain squints and mugs like the cartoon character Popeye and is just as believable.\n\n(Alan): Although I found JAWS very exciting and lots of fun 33 years ago, it doesnt hold up for me now and is really just a hyped up fish story, I believe. Although Shaws performance as the hard-eyed boat captain Quint is enormously entertaining, it is actually a one-dimensional ham-fest; he seems to eat as much scenery as the shark does. Nonetheless, Shaws performance as Captain Quint in JAWS is ranked #28 on Premiere Magazine's 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time list. A little known fact: Shaw improvised most of his brilliant monologue about sharks swarming the sailors blown off the U.S.S. Indianapolis in World War 2.\n\nOver a 24-year span, Robert Shaw had nine children (and a stepson) by three women. Three months before his death, he told a reporter, Being 51 years old and having 10 childrenthe youngest is 13 monthscreates the economic necessity that forces me into all those big-budget movies in which I often don't have a single realistic line.\n\nHe has also said, Writing is where the real center of my integrity lies. I never write for money. I only act for money, but not invariably, of course. I would never write certain sentences that I say in films, or even that I write in films, because I often fix up my lines.\n\nOn another occasion, Shaw observed, Acting is instant enjoyment and childlike. As an actor I can take an audience in a theatre and throw them in any direction. I can't do that as a writer. Writing is painful, it's lonely, you suffer and there's no immediate feedback.\n\nAnother Shaw statement on acting versus writing: What I try to achieve in acting-flamboyance-would be self-indulgence if I tried it as a writer.\n\nRobert Archibald Shaw was born in Westhoughton, Lancashire, England on August 9, 1927, eldest son of Doctor Thomas Archibald Shaw and Doreen Nora Avery. Thomas was an alcoholic and manic depressive who committed suicide by imbibing a lethal dose of opium when Robert was only 12.\n\nAt school in Truro, Robert was a talented rugby, squash and track athlete who turned down university scholarship offers to go into acting. He was inspired by one his teachers, Cyril Wilkes, who got him to read most of the classics and frequently took him and a few other boys to London to see plays. The first stage production Robert saw there was Sir John Gielguds legendary 1944 HAMLET. After a brief teaching stint in Yorkshire, Robert attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts from 1946 to 1948.\n\nAt Stratford-on-Avon, Shaw was directed by Gielgud, who said to him, \"I do admire you and think you've got a lot of ability, and I'd like to help you, but you make me so nervous.\"\n\nShaws early stage career took him throughout Europe, Australia and South Africa. In 1950, Sir Alec Guiness discovered Shaw when he was performing MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING at Stratford, brought him to London to perform HAMLET with him and then got him his first role: an uncredited small part in Guinesss 1951 classic crime comedy THE LAVENDER HILL MOB.\n\nShaw married actress Jennifer Bourke in 1952 and had four daughters with her. To support the young family during his struggling-actor period, he earned $10,000 pounds for eight months work playing the lead in 37 episodes of the TV pirate/privateer series THE BUCCANEERS.\n\nHe had a child with actress Mary Ure, then the wife of acclaimed British playwright John Osborne (LOOK BACK IN ANGER, Oscar and BAFTA for TOM JONES). They married in 1973, had three more children and performed the lead roles in the 1964 drama THE LUCK OF GINGER COFFEY. Robert and Mary were very happy together for a dozen years, until her accidental death in 1975which turned him into a depressed alcoholic for a while. In 1976, however, he married his secretary of 15 years, Virginia Jansen, and had one child with her, also adopting her son.\n\nShaw once admitted, I drink too much, but added, Tell me one great actor who doesn't drink.\n\nHe played the lead in the 1978 expensive flop FORCE TEN FROM NAVARONE, later commenting, I have it in mind to stop making these big-budget extravaganzas, to change my pattern of life. When I was younger, I wanted to prove that I could be an international movie star. Now that I've done it, I see the valuelessness of it.\n\nWhile playing a Russian official in AVALANCHE EXPRESS, Robert Shaw died of a sudden heart attack in Ireland on August 28, 1978. He was driving with his wife and son when he felt chest pains. He told Virginia he would get out and walk them off, but after a few steps he collapsed. He was pronounced dead 15 minutes later.\n\nRobert Shaw overcame a troubled childhood to become an exceptionally gifted, powerful dramatic actor who accurately did diverse accents, brought numerous unforgettable characters to life and wrote intelligent works that had impact on readers and audiences.\n\n© Alan Waldman and Sharon Waldman (April 1, 2008)\n\n****************"
