        "text": "“IM in the ironic position of someone who achieved commercial success rather late life after spending years on the stage and in making quality films that no one went to see:” Robert Shaw was saying ‘ the , other day.\n\n“Being 51 years old and having 10 children—the youngest is 13 months--creates the economic necessity that forces me into all those big:budget movies in which I often don't say a single realistic line.\n\n“I can't say that I enjoy working as an actor the way I used to, but at the same time I can see the way things are going, and I know that it's better to be at the top of the heap than at the bottom,” he continued, “I have no intention of having to make television commercials when I'm old. Money in the bank means freedom of choice, and if someone wants to pay me $1 million to make a film I'll make it.”\n\nMr, Shaw was speaking from Palm Springs, Calif., where he was enjoying a four‐week vacation between the completion of “Force Ten From Navarone,” a World War II adventure yarn, and the start of work in • “Avalanche Express,” a contemporary spy thriller ‘in which he plays an official of :• the Soviet secret ‘police, a role that harks back to his performance as a British defector turned Soviet assassin in one of the first of the James Bond thrillers to be. filmed, “From Russia With Love.”\n\n“I •find it a• bit ridiculous at my age to be running around a mountain in Yugoslavia waving a machine. gun, saying, ‘Let's go,’ as I did in ‘Force Ten,'” he said. “And location shooting means you work six. long days a week. Thank God, in ‘Avalanche Express’ I'm a prisoner through most of the movie. Lee Marvin, Mike Connors and Joe Nemeth do the running around. I sit and play patience and talk.”\n\nNo star has been busier than Mr. Shaw during the paSt five years or so. He has made something like .10 films, including the enormously successful “The Sting” and “Jaws,” as well as “The Deeps’ and “Black Sunday”. “I have it in mind to stop making these big‐budget ‐extravaganzas, to change my pattern of life,” he said. wanted to prove, I think, that I could be an international movie star. Now that- I've done it, I see the valuelessness of it.”\n\nThis could be. ignored as ,an another rendition of the. Beverly’ Hills Blues, except for the fact that, besides having established himself in serious drama in the West End, Mr. Snaw has published five highly regarded novels as well as a play based on the Eichm’ ann trial, “The Man in the Glass Booth.”\n\n“Writing is where the real center of my integrity lies,” Mr. Shaw said. “I never write for money. only act for money, but not invariably, of course. I would ne\\:er write certain sentences that I say in films, or even that I write in films, because often fix up my lines. I've been working on a novel about an old people's home in •Manhattan for five or six years now. It's called ‘The Ice Floe.’ I've been working on it out here in Palm Springs, but not, I must say, in any concentrated way.”\n\nWhat he had been doing, he said, was playing golf and tennis, drinking milk—it being a period of abstention from strong waters for him—and relaxing with his wife, the former Virginia Dewitt Jansen, better known as Jay, who was his secretary for 15 years and whom he married in 1976, a year after the death of his second wife, the actress Mary Ure.\n\n“I had never been here before,” he said, speaking of the desert resort, “and I must say I'm enjoying lit. I played golf today with Gary Morton, who is Lucille Ball's husband, and a gentleman of 74‐I.cion't recall his name—who hits the ball as well as anyone I've seen.”\n\nAs filmgoers may recall, Mr. Shaw plays a scene on a golf course in “The Sting” with a certain authority that goes beyond mere acting. The reason is that he is, in fact, quite a good player, with a handicap of eight, and the ability to rise to quite considerable levels of excellence. He noted that before making “Force Ten” he had beaten the assistant pro at a Hollywood country club, 3 and 2.\n\n“A great many English actors are good golfers,” he said. “My friend Sean Connery for one, There's ‐a Stage Golfing Society, and members have playing rights at most of the clubs in Britain.” •\n\n• • • •\n\nThere are multiple ironies in the fact that “Straight Time” has received many generally favorable reviews around the country, including one in this newspaper.\n\nFor one thing, Dustin Hoffman, the star of the film, is suing First Artists, the producer, and Warner Brothers, the distributor, in Los Angeles Superior Court. He alleges that the denial to him of his contractual right of final cut led to the release of mutilated version of the film. The same allegations apply to “Agatha,” made under the same auspices and scheduled•for release next year. In all, Mr. Hoffman is asking $68 million in damages.\n\nAnother irony is that the distributor seems\n\nhave believed that “Straight Time” faced a critical panning, since they opened it here last Friday without advance screenings. Thus, the reviews appeared in the Saturday papers. This tactic permits the possibility of a couple of days of strong weekend business on the strength of a star's name before the word gets around.\n\nFor a third, Barbra Streisand, Paul Newman and Sidney Poitier founded First Artists in 1969 in hopes that through it they could assert some measurable’ influence, if not outright control, of the films in which they appeared. Steve McQueen joined it in 1971 and Mr. Hoffman in 1972. The corporation is now publicly owned with interests in records and television as well as in movies, Mr. Hoffman and ‘the other founders are now merely small stockholders in the enterprise.\n\nBertram Fields, the lawyer who is representing Mr. Hoffman, said that his client had waived his salary, ordinarily in the $1‐million,range, in both films in return for the coveted final cut, That is, the right, seldom relinquished by the producers, to determine the final form a film will have. Mr. Hoffman agreed instead to share substantially in the profits, if any.\n\nNeither First Artists nor Warner Brothers would comment on the suit. Mr. Field said that the'right of final cut had been withdrawn because Mr. Hoffman was said to have gone over the budget on “Straight Time” and to have fallen behind schedule on “Agatha.” There were extenuating circumstances in both instances, Mr. Fields said.\n\n“The reviews bear out my client's contention,” he added. “'Straight Time’ is an excellent picture that could have been a great picture if Mr. Hoffman had been allowed to finish cutting it. As it is, one important critic pointed out that it seemed to sag after the first third; which is exactly at the point it was taken away from him.”\n\nWhile Mr. Fields said he was not prepared to say that First Artists and Warners were trying to dump the film, in. which Mr. Hoffman plays a smalltime crook, he didn't think they were “100 percent behind it.” A Warners spokesman said that advertising and promotion of the film, which cost $4 million, had been budgeted at a substantial $3 million and that this amount would now be increased. It is, in fact, doing reasonably good business at the Coronet Theater in Manhattan.\n\n• • •\n\nStarting next Friday the New York Shakespeare Festival (J. Papp, proprietor) will turn .its attention to film in a small way. The 100‐seat Little Theater on the first floor of the Astor Place headquarters will start showing a selection of films that failed to receive the acclaim that their artistic merit thought to have deserved. The first will be “High Street,” made in Belgium in 1973 by Andre Ernotte and Elliot Tiber, and starring Annie Cordy. Admission is $2.\n\n• • •\n\nLillian Gish will act as hostess on Tuesday evening at 8:30 when the 1926 film version of “'La Boheme,” in which she was starred with‐John Gilbert, Renee Adoree, Roy D'arcy and Edward Everett Horton, shown at Town Hall. Tickets for the showing, which is in aid of the Metropolitan Opera Guild, are priced at $10 and $6, and are available through the guild.\n\n• • •\n\nMaureen Stapleton and Paul Sorvino will appear with George Segal and Glenda Jackson in “Lost and Found,” which is being filmed in Banff, Alberta. Mr. Segal and Miss Jackson were last seen together in “A Touch of Class.”"
