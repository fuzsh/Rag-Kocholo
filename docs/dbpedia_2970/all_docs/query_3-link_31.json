To address urgent demand, a small supply of the DVDs has been supplied for the 2017 holiday season exclusively through The Symphony Store at the Woodruff Arts Center. Once sold out, these DVDs will not be widely available again in the near future.\n\nhttps://www.asostore.org/products/robert-shaw-dvd\n\nHaving already received three Best Documentary awards, a Best Music award plus a Best of Fest and several other awards in the past several months, the Atlanta-produced film is still enjoying festival invitations well into 2018. Robert Shaw – Man of Many Voices has also recently earned the Los Angeles Independent Film Reviews’ 2017 Gold Award. The film, about the extraordinary life of America's internationally revered choral and orchestral conductor, is currently making the film festival circuit.\n\nRobert Shaw was an American conductor most famous for his work with his namesake Chorale, with the Cleveland Orchestra and Chorus, as well as the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus. During his lifetime, Shaw received 16 Grammy awards, four ASCAP awards for service to contemporary music, the first Guggenheim Fellowship ever awarded to a conductor, and was a 1991 recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors.\n\nRobert Shaw’s impact went beyond the musical world. As the documentary shows, his influence extended into international relations and into the civil rights arena as well. The film explores his forays into the South with racially integrated choruses as well as his reasoning for bringing his already impressive musical influence to Atlanta in the 1960s.\n\nView the trailer for the film at: http://robertshawthefilm.com/film-trailer/\n\nEmmy Award-winning actor, David Hyde Pierce, narrates the film from Mr. Shaw’s modest beginnings through his improbable but meteoric rise to national stardom and international acclaim. The choral world’s fascination with Robert Shaw’s techniques are only slightly matched by the music world’s celebration of the sounds he was able to create. The 16 Grammy Awards plus the first classical “Gold Album”, selling more than one million copies, attest to his 60-year career.\n\n****\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION\n\nMichael Martin\n\nMarketing/PR 404.357.6617\n\ninfo@robertshawthefilm.com\n\n*FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE*\n\nCLEVELAND IS A “SHAW TOWN”\n\nAtlanta, GA – March 10, 2017 – Two opportunities to see the award-winning documentary Robert Shaw - Man of Many Voices are coming up in Cleveland.

The film is being considered for several film festivals and has already been selected for the St. Louis International Film Festival (November 9th) and at the San Diego Jewish Film Festival (February 9 – 19, 2017).\n\nThe documentary explores the extraordinary and improbable life of small town minister’s son who manages, without formal training, to become a pop music sensation before deciding to devote his life and energy to classical music. In doing so, Shaw pioneered choral techniques that are still applied today while creating the world renowned, Grammy-winning Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus. His highly successful 60-year career influenced more than just music and the film explores his impact on civil rights and international relations during the cold war are explored.\n\nThe few screenings of the film to date have generated an enthusiastic response including this from the New York Times’ music critic, James Oestreich: “Poignant and compelling…though an obvious labor of love, it remains admirably cleareyed in its warts-and-all perspective.” Emmy Award winning actor, David Hyde Pierce, narrates the film.\n\nTickets for the Asheville screening can be purchased at the theatre box office (www.fineartstheatre.com).

Tickets are free but reservations must be made via the NYPL online site.\n\nThe few screenings of the film to date have generated an enthusiastic response including this from the New York Times’ music critic, James Oestreich: “Poignant and compelling…though an obvious labor of love, it remains admirably cleareyed in its warts-and-all perspective.”\n\nViewers at the Atlanta premiere were similarly moved and impressed, “The first half of the program was worth the price of admission alone. And then you got that beautiful and moving film on top of that. What a great way to spend an afternoon,” replied Atlanta-native Temi Feldman Kageorge as she exited Symphony Hall.\n\nThat day began in true Robert Shaw fashion. Ann Howard Jones, Shaw’s esteemed assistant for 15 years and recently retired director of music for Boston University, led 8 local high school and university choral groups in an intense choral clinic. The groups, including the Morehouse College Glee Club and the Lassiter High School Choraliers, then serenaded the assembled guests with a pair of Shaw’s favorite pieces. After several choral presentations, including a performance by Mr. Shaw’s niece Holly Shaw Price, The Atlanta Young Singers and Mr. Shaw’s own Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Chorus, the Woodruff Center hosted a reunion for current and former members of the ASO Chorus.\n\nWinner of numerous awards, Mr. Shaw was the music director the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the founder of the celebrated, all-volunteer ASO Chorus. The film, several years in the making, utilizes a vast archive of photo, sound and motion picture images to explore Mr. Shaw’s highly unusual career path and his unmatched legacy on the world of music and on choral music in particular. The premieres are timed to align with what would have been Mr. Shaw’s 100th birthday.\n\nView the trailer for the film at: https://vimeo.com/138375236\n\nEmmy Award winning actor, David Hyde Pierce, narrates the film. Starting with Mr. Shaw’s modest beginnings the story traces his improbable but meteoric rise to national stardom and international acclaim. The choral world’s fascination with Robert Shaw’s techniques are only slightly matched by the music world’s celebration of the sounds he was able to create. 16 Grammy Awards plus the first classical “Gold Album”, selling more than one million copies, attest to his 60-year career.\n\nThe film also explores how Robert Shaw’s impact went beyond the musical and into civil and human rights issues as well. His forays into the South with racially integrated choruses as well as his reasoning for bringing his already impressive musical influence to Atlanta in the 1960s show a surprisingly early commitment from the very outset of his career. This courage appears again when the film explores his choral tours behind the Iron Curtain.\n\nDavid Hyde Pierce is known largely for playing the psychiatrist Dr. Niles Crane on the NBC sitcom Frasier, for which he won four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. Just as Robert Shaw was known for his distinctive and passionate choral direction, Mr. Pierce is known for his distinctive voice and often does voice work.\n\nTickets for today can be purchased at: http://www.lincolncenter.org/show/special-film-screening-robert-shaw-man-of-many-voices\n\nFuture screening dates can found at http://robertshawthefilm.com/\n\n****\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nATLANTA’S LEGENDARY ROBERT SHAW PREMIERS AGAIN\n\nWITH NEW DOCUMENTARY\n\nAtlanta, GA – March 9, 2016 – A new documentary film focusing on the legendary conductor and choral\n\ndirector, Robert Shaw, will premier April 24th at the Woodruff Arts Center in Midtown Atlanta.\n\nWinner of numerous awards, Mr. Shaw was the music director of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the\n\nfounder of the celebrated, all-volunteer ASO Chorus.
