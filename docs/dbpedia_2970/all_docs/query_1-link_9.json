They torment him verbally, ask him idiotic unanswerable questions, force him to sit down and stand up, and give him a \"party\". Then, eventually, they take him away, a tongue-tied idiot. The trivial becomes the terrible, and with it a certain wonder, a certain pity.",

        "text": "Action!: Friedkin, The Realist\n\nThroughout my many runs with these legendary directors from the past, it seemed like a rule, a rite of passage, that each and every one of them directed at least one cinematic adaptation of an iconic play. Some did it by committee, while others, like this adaptation of Harold Pinter's well-known piece, did it as a passion project for Friedkin.\n\nNow, I'll be the first to admit that I don't enjoy film adaptations of this type, so my negative review has more to do with my own preferences than with the film's actual quality. I enjoyed the humor and the increasing tension brought on by the film noir components, especially the blindfold game, but I just…\n\n\"You can only appreciate what you've had when things change. That's what they say, isn't it?\"\n\nWhen I saw the absolutely wonderful play The Shark Is Broken back on August 4, one of my favorite details in Ian Shaw's portrayal of his father, Robert Shaw, was in how Shaw père teases Richard Dreyfuss (or I should say Alex Brightman in that role) for wanting so badly to get in touch with Harold Pinter; we really believe that young Dreyfuss would admire both the esteemed thespian and the playwright so much that he'd give anything to have a theatrical opportunity on the level of Shaw's success in The Birthday Party. Later that night, I combed through Letterboxd entries to compile a…\n\nSeeing early William Friedkin adapting stage plays for the screen feels like the perfect way for someone like him to test what he was capable of with the medium of film. I think that with the words of Harold Pinter, it feels like Friedkin has a perfect idea for the tone of the films that he wanted to make ever since The Birthday Party, but there's a budding confidence to these films which is especially admirable for someone who made this as his sophomore film.\n\nIt's a wholly claustrophobic feature, but it's also very clear with watching The Birthday Party that William Friedkin wanted this to be the best film he could make out of the play. It really shows,…\n\n\"Stan, don't let them tell you what to do\"\n\nStan (Robert Shaw) is a former pianist who has been holed up in decrepit seaside boarding house run by Meg and Petey (Dandy Nichols and Moultrie Kelsall) for the past year. He is the sole guest until one day, a day which Meg informs Stan is his birthday, two men arrive to stay. One is Jewish (Sydney Tafler) and the other Irish (Patrick Magee) and they appear to know Stan and to have come looking for him. In the evening, during the birthday party, events slowly begin to take a sinister and nightmarish turn.\n\nThis was the second full length play from Harold Pinter, based on an experience he had staying…\n\nMy first experience of Harold Pinter's work was when I was at school and only 13.\n\nLooking back, and having experienced more of Pinter's work since then, whoever that teacher was that thought it was a good idea to try and decipher his work at that age was must have been vastly overstating our intellect.\n\nThat being said, I do remember enjoying The Dumb Waiter quite a lot, which was the play that we studied. I was actually reminded of it when BBC2 started airing Bottom in the early 90s. There was a real Pinter-esque atmosphere and chemistry between characters all the way through the greatest British sitcom of all time, and I do wonder if his work was an…\n\nIt’s been a while. Too long in my books. Life hasn’t left much time for films. But I’m back, and what better re-entry point than here.\n\nThe Birthday Party was an early passionate project by the late, great William Friedkin whom we lost earlier this month. He had seen Harold Pinter’s play on stage and nabbed the rights for a screen adaptation. Not only was this personal for Friedkin, but it hits close to home for yours truly. Pinter lived and worked in my hometown of Worthing in which he set The Birthday Party. Although the play itself is a bottled drama that unfolds indoors, it is firmly set in that familiar seaside setting in which I grew up.\n\nIt’s…"
