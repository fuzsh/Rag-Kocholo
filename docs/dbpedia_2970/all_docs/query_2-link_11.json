        "text": "Vitals\n\nRobert Shaw as Quint, grizzled and tough shark hunter and U.S. Navy veteran\n\nAmity Island, July 1974\n\nFilm: Jaws\n\nRelease Date: June 20, 1975\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nCostume Design: Louise Clark, Robert Ellsworth, and Irwin Rose\n\nBackground\n\nAfter early directorial efforts like Duel and The Sugarland Express, Steven Spielberg forever changed the cinematic landscape with Jaws, considered the first true blockbuster when it was released in the summer of 1975. Filming had commenced a year earlier, 50 years ago this week, on May 2, 1974.\n\nAdapted from Peter Benchley’s novel of the same name, Jaws centered around a fictional shark terrorizing the swimmers off the idyllic New England community of Amity Island… though it had a very real impact on frightened beach-goers for years to follow.\n\nPolice chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) and oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) team up with the hardened shark-hunter known only as Quint (Robert Shaw) to accompany them out into the water to bring an end to “Bruce” the shark’s reign of terror. Though local fishermen are eager to be the ones to stop the shark, Brody and Hooper are well aware of Quint’s qualifications that make him worth every cent of his requested $10,000 fee:\n\nY’all know me. Know how I earn a livin’. I’ll catch this bird for you, but it ain’t gonna be easy.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nVitals\n\nRobert Shaw as David Kabakov, experienced Mossad agent and Major\n\nMiami, January 1976\n\nFilm: Black Sunday\n\nRelease Date: April 1, 1977\n\nDirector: John Frankenheimer\n\nCostume Designer: Ray Summers\n\nWARNING! Spoilers ahead!\n\nBackground\n\nIt’s Super Bowl Sunday! To many of us, the Big Game (as the NFL would prefer us unlicensed folks call it) is an opportunity to spend a Sunday with friends, beer, and buffalo chicken dip while halfheartedly rooting for a team that we may not care about and catching a glimpse of some over-produced multimillion-dollar ad buys. For director John Frankenheimer, it’s an opportunity to yet again present the thrills and cynicism of ruthless criminals exploiting geopolitical dilemmas for their own gain with considerable human lives at stake. In short: Black Sunday.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nVitals\n\nRobert Shaw as Romer Treece, adventurous treasure hunter and lighthouse-keeper\n\nOff the Bermuda coast, Summer 1976\n\nFilm: The Deep\n\nRelease Date: June 17, 1977\n\nDirector: Peter Yates\n\nCostume Designer: Ron Talsky\n\nBackground\n\nFollowing the record-setting blockbuster success of Jaws, adapted from Peter Benchley’s debut novel of the same name, Columbia Pictures quickly purchased the rights to Benchley’s next novel before it was even published. The Deep proved to be another box-office hit, if not as critically acclaimed as its predecessor, with much of its success attributed to an effective marketing campaign centered around Jacqueline Bisset’s white T-shirt.\n\nAnother casting decision that worked in The Deep‘s favor was Robert Shaw, born 95 years ago today on August 9, 1927.

The Germans had instigated their air and sea blockade earlier that summer, followed by Luftwaffe air raids that started with ports and shipping centers, eventually moving further inland to airfields, factories, and ultimately civilian areas. Hitler had intended to gain air superiority over England prior to an invasion dubbed Operation Sea Lion, but a strong national defense from the Royal Air Force and the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy successfully routed the Luftwaffe and prevented this full-scale invasion of the United Kingdom.\n\nThis British victory was considered an early turning point in favor of the Allies during World War II that inspired Winston Churchill to famously declare: “Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.”\n\nOn the 29th anniversary of this famous British defense against Germany in the skies over London, the United Artists war epic Battle of Britain with a star-studded cast including Sir Laurence Olivier, Michael Caine, Trevor Howard, Christopher Plummer, and Robert Shaw. The latter portrays a talented and brash Squadron Leader, said to be inspired by South African fighter ace Sailor Malan, commander of No. 74 Squadron RAF during the actual Battle of Britain.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nVitals\n\nRobert Shaw as Donald “Red” Grant, lethal SPECTRE assassin\n\nThe Orient Express, Spring 1963\n\nFilm: From Russia With Love\n\nRelease Date: October 10, 1963\n\nDirector: Terence Young\n\nCostume Designer: Jocelyn Rickards\n\nBackground\n\nTwo years ago on the 00-7th of October, I wrote about the gray wool suit that Sean Connery’s James Bond wore in From Russia With Love during his brutal fight with SPECTRE assassin Red Grant (Robert Shaw) aboard the Orient Express. Today’s post features Grant’s suit – also gray wool but in a heavier suiting mixed with brown yarns for a warm, fall-friendly outfit – in addition to the watch and weapons that are the tools of Grant’s unsavory trade.

To celebrate the birth of this iconic actor and writer, BAMF Style presents another contributor post submitted by BAMF Style reader “W.T. Hatch”. Enjoy!\n\nVitals\n\nRobert Shaw as Quint, grizzled and tough shark hunter and U.S. Navy veteran\n\nAmity Island, July 1974\n\nFilm: Jaws\n\nRelease Date: June 20, 1975\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nCostume Design: Louise Clark, Robert Ellsworth, and Irwin Rose\n\nBackground\n\nY’all know me. Know how I earn a livin’. I’ll catch this bird for you, but it ain’t gonna be easy.\n\nIn 1975, director Steven Spielberg scared the bejesus out of America with the summer blockbuster hit Jaws. Based upon author Peter Benchley’s novel of the same name, Jaws is the harrowing tale of a 25′ man-eating shark which terrorizes the small beach community of Amity Island. Technical problems forced Spielberg to largely abandon the mechanical shark, dubbed “Bruce” after his attorney, instead using mood, music, and a set of yellow barrels to suggest the beast’s on-screen presence. One viewing of the film is enough to make even the bravest soul think twice before taking a swim in the ocean.\n\nBut one other persona in the movie is more frightening than the shark. I speak of the shark’s archenemy known only by the name of Quint. No doubt inspired by another single-minded sea captain, namely Ahab of Moby Dick, Quint is one of cinema’s most enigmatic, famous, and all-around badass characters.
