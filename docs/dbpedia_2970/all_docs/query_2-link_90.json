        "text": "By all\n\nlogic, Richard Lester deserves consideration as one of the key filmmakers to\n\nemerge in the latter half of the 20th century. Over a career spanning 22\n\nfeature films, he has had a number of critical and commercial successes\n\n(including one that won the top prize at Cannes), his unique directorial style—shifting effortlessly from classical elegance to formally\n\nradical depending on the needs of the material—has\n\ninfluenced any number of filmmakers over the years (one notable fan, Steven\n\nSoderbergh, even collaborated with Lester on a book about his career, the\n\nmust-read “Getting Away With It”) and one of his films has gone on to\n\nbe enshrined as one of the all-time greats in the history of the medium. And\n\nyet, for several reasons—the relatively low profile\n\nthat he kept as a filmmaker even at the apex of his career, the high profile of\n\nthe personalities that he worked with on many of his biggest hits, his\n\ninability to be pigeonholed as a single entity (not even in terms of his\n\nnationality—Lester’s name has threatened\n\nto fade away in the minds of the movie-going public except as the guy who\n\ndirected the first two films featuring The Beatles.\n\nHoping to\n\nreverse that trend and expose Lester’s wide-ranging filmography to a new\n\ngeneration of moviegoers, the Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York has\n\nput together “Richard Lester: The Running Jumping Pop Cinema\n\nIconoclast,” a career retrospective running August 7-13 that will\n\nencompass 15 of his films—all but three of them being\n\npresented in 35mm and one actually serving as its long, long-delayed debut U.S.\n\ntheatrical presentation—that illustrate how he was\n\nable to work in any number of genres with a wit and style that was uniquely his\n\nown. Although not a complete retrospective—some may question the absence\n\nof his first feature, the 1962 youth-oriented musical “It’s Trad,\n\nDad” or his superhero epics “Superman II” (1981) and\n\n“Superman III” (1983)—the films programmed here are\n\nall significant works and any true movie fan attending the program will be able\n\nto reacquaint themselves with some old favorites and perhaps get a chance to expose\n\nthemselves to a couple that they somehow missed over the years.\n\nBorn in\n\n1932, Lester, a child prodigy who entered the University of Pennsylvania at the\n\nage of 15, originally looked towards a career in clinical psychology but soon\n\nshifted his focus when he went to work for a local television station and rose\n\nthrough the ranks until he became a director. Believing that there were more\n\nopportunities in his newly-chosen career path in England than in the U.S., he\n\ntransplanted to London and soon became a power in the industry, even becoming\n\nthe star of the variety series “The Dick Lester Show.” The show\n\ndidn’t last too long but the touches of surreal comedy on display attracted the\n\nattention of no less a figure than Peter Sellers, who hired Lester to direct a\n\ncouple of “Goon Show” reunion specials and, more significantly, the\n\ngroundbreaking 1959 short film “The Running, Jumping & Standing Still\n\nFilm,” a silent comedy homage that earned an Oscar nomination for\n\nLive-Action Short as well as a chance for Lester to move into features with\n\n“It’s Trad, Dad!” After the success of that film, Lester was hired to\n\ndirect “Mouse on the Moon,” a sequel to the 1959 hit “The Mouse\n\nThat Roared” that saw the tiny country of Grand Fenwick stumble into the\n\nspace race when their chief export, a dreadful wine that keeps exploding in the\n\nbottle, is actually a potent rocket fuel. Although not nearly as entertaining\n\nas the original, in no small part because of the absence of Sellers from the\n\ncast (though he was instrumental in getting Lester hired for the job), it did\n\nrelatively well at the box office and it led to that film’s producer, Walter\n\nShenson, to ask Lester to direct his latest project, a film designed around a\n\ncurrently popular music group that had to be produced and distributed within a\n\nfew months—before fans moved on to the\n\nnext big thing.\n\nThe\n\ngroup, of course, was The Beatles, the film in question was, of course, “A\n\nHard Day’s Night” (1964) and Lester’s lightly exaggerated look at a day in\n\nthe life of the newly-minted stars proved to be as groundbreaking and as\n\nsheerly entertaining as the music that it was designed to highlight. As I am\n\nassuming that anyone who has read this far into this piece has doubtlessly seen\n\nthe film any number of times, I am going to assume that a long explanation of\n\nwhat makes it so special, even today, is unnecessary. Instead, I would like to\n\ngive a little more attention to “Help,” the 1965 reunion between\n\nLester and the group, whose popularity had only grown in the interim. The film,\n\na bit of surreal silliness involving the boys being pursued around the world by\n\nmembers of a cult after Ringo gets their sacred sacrificial ring stuck on his\n\nfinger, has never had the best reputation among fans and critics alike, and\n\nwatching a story about a group of murderous fanatics trying to kill one of the\n\nBeatles admittedly plays very differently now than it did a half-century ago.\n\nThat said, I must confess that, while acknowledging every one of the earlier\n\nfilm’s achievements, I actually prefer “Help” to its predecessor.\n\nFrom the first time I saw it as a young child, I fell in love with its\n\ncheerfully cartoonish nature and offbeat knockabout comedy beats (such as a\n\ntiger that can only be quelled by singing Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy”\n\nand the ending dedication to Elias Howe, the inventor of the sewing machine)\n\nand the nuttiness Lester brought to the proceedings remains as infectious today\n\nas it did back then.\n\nIn\n\nbetween the two Beatles projects, Lester made “The Knack…and How to Get\n\nIt,” an adaptation of Ann Jellicoe’s 1962 novel about the then-ascendant\n\nyouth culture in London that focused on the competition that develops between\n\nthree young man—shy schoolteacher Colin\n\n(Michael Crawford), womanizing Tolen (Ray Brooks) and the artistic Tom (Donal\n\nDonnelly)—to win the favors of the newly\n\narrived and freshly liberated Nancy (Rita Tushingham). A relatively\n\nstraightforward proposition on stage, Lester made stylistic changes to the\n\nmaterial that pushed it even beyond what he accomplished in “A Hard Day’s\n\nNight,” including off-beat editing patterns, characters directly\n\naddressing the camera and a Greek chorus of older people commenting on the\n\nmisadventures of the younger generation. When it was completed, Lester’s bold formal\n\nexperiment did not win many fans at first—Jellicoe reportedly hated what\n\nwas done to her play and executives at United Artists, who had such a hit with\n\n“A Hard Day's Night,” dismissed it as well and considered dumping it\n\nas the bottom half of double bills. Unexpectedly, it was entered into\n\ncompetition at that year’s Cannes Film Festival and wound up winning the\n\ncoveted Palme d’Or in the process, though it did not make much of a commercial\n\nimpact in America. Today, the film is a little dated in parts but it still has\n\nan energy to it that is undeniable, and many of the things that it has to say\n\nabout young male-female relationships are still painfully relevant today.\n\n(Sharp-eyed viewers will notice that three of the most beautiful actresses to\n\never set foot in front of a movie camera make their big-screen debuts here—Charlotte Rampling, Jacqueline Bisset and Jane Birkin.)\n\nDespite\n\nthe critical and commercial accomplishments he had achieved to this point,\n\nthere was some rumbling in certain circles that Lester was the proverbial\n\nemperor sans clothes and that there wasn’t much to his films once you took away\n\nthe surface flash and iconoclastic attitude. Whether these opinions reached\n\nLester at all is unknown, but his next couple of movies did find him stretching\n\noutside of the comfort zone that he had established for himself with mixed\n\nresults. A 1966 feature version of the\n\nBroadway hit “A Funny Thing Happened to Me on the Way to the Forum”\n\noffered him the chance to step up to the big leagues but the results were\n\nuneven—there were the nifty Stephen\n\nSondhem songs and comedy legend Buster Keaton in what would be his final screen\n\nappearance but these good points were outweighed by a turbulent production (the\n\nwriter-producer was under the impression that he was going to be directing it\n\nand when that didn’t pan out, he and Lester found themselves at loggerheads\n\nregarding virtually everything about the production), a wildly over-the-top\n\nperformance by Zero Mostel as Pseudolous, the slave trying to help his young\n\nmaster win the heart of the virginal courtesan next door in exchange for his\n\nfreedom, and the nagging sense that this was a property best appreciated on the\n\nstage. The next year, he came up with “How I Won the War,” a WWII\n\nsatire about a group of soldiers sent behind enemy lines to build a cricket\n\npitch for a visiting dignitary. Lester ambitiously designed the film to be both\n\nan anti-war statement and a protest against the jingoistic war movies that he\n\nfelt were equally insidious in how they formed pro-combat attitudes in\n\nunsuspecting viewers. The result is an undeniably intriguing film, but one that\n\nproved to be difficult for most viewers to embrace and when it is remembered\n\ntoday, it is mostly because of the presence of John Lennon in an unassuming\n\nsupporting turn as one of the soldiers.\n\nFor his\n\nnext project, Lester took the bold step of returning to his home country for\n\nthe first time in fifteen years to shoot an adaptation of a novel about the\n\nrelationship that unexpectedly develops between a straight-laced doctor in the\n\nthroes of a divorce and an unhappily married free-spirit socialite that would\n\nplay out during the end days of the legendary Summer of Love in San Francisco.\n\nThe resulting film, “Petulia,” would prove to be Lester’s most deliberately\n\nmature vision to date in the way that is observed both the relationship between\n\nthe two characters (expertly and heartbreakingly played by George C. Scott and\n\nJulie Christie) and the relationship between Lester himself and the country\n\nthat he once called home but now had difficulty recognizing anymore. Released\n\nduring a particularly chaotic point in American history—it premiered a week after the assassination of Robert F.\n\nKennedy—“Petulia” was a\n\nnon-starter at the box-office and sharply divided critics between those who\n\nfound it a revelation and those who found it a sour and unpleasant mess. In\n\nsubsequent years, however, opinions of the film have shifted greatly and\n\n“Petulia” is now generally considered to be one of the high-water\n\nmarks of Lester’s entire career and the first time that he allowed a genuine\n\nemotional core to coexist with the cynical social satire. Even today, its final\n\nimages still retain enough power to inspire a tear or two in the eyes of even\n\nthe most jaded of moviegoers.\n\nAlthough\n\n“Petulia” would become his third under-performer at the box office in\n\na row, Lester still had a certain amount of clout in the movie industry and he\n\nwould invest virtually all of it in his next project, which would prove to be\n\nthe darkest, strangest and most formally daring work of his career. This was\n\n“The Bed Sitting Room,” a deeply surreal and blackly comic adaptation\n\nof the Spike Milligan/John Antrobus play set a few years after a nuclear war\n\n(lasting 2 minutes and 28 seconds) has devastated most of the world and which\n\nfollows a handful of survivors as they wander through the wreckage of what was\n\nonce London. A young woman (Rita Tushingham) is 17 months pregnant and lives on\n\nthe still-functioning Circle Line train with her parents. The BBC is reduced to\n\none man who goes door-to-door to read the news from behind the screens of\n\nhollowed-out televisions. A lord (Sir Ralph Richardson) is convinced that he is\n\nabout to mutate into a bed-sitting room. The National Health Service has been\n\nreduced to one male nurse played by Marty Feldman and the entire police force\n\nconsists of two officers (Dudley Moore and Peter Cook) who do nothing but\n\nadvise anyone they encounter to “keep moving” so as to prevent them\n\nfrom being targets of a future war. The monarchy, by the way, is now in the\n\nhands of Mrs. Ethel Shroake, a former maid of the Queen’s who is the closest in\n\nsuccession to the throne.\n\nWatching\n\n“The Bed Sitting Room” today, it seem incredible that such a thing\n\ncould have ever made it through the production process. The comedy is both\n\npitch-black and of a decidedly British nature, and the final third veers into\n\noutright tragedy before a conclusion that tries to find a small glimmer of hope\n\namidst all the chaos and horror and astonishingly manages to pull it off while\n\nstaying true to the material. Needless to say, when the studio heads at United\n\nArtists took a look at it, they were appalled at what they saw (to be fair, it\n\nseems that the famously hands-off organization was still under the impression\n\nthat Lester was doing a musical version of Joe Orton’s “Up Against\n\nIt” starring Mick Jagger, the project he had been working on before\n\nshifting his focus after that one fell through) and shelved it for more than a\n\nyear. When it did finally appear in 1970, it was such a bomb with critics and\n\naudiences alike that not only did it fail to make a cent at the box office, it\n\nderailed Lester’s directorial career entirely for the next few years.\n\nAlthough\n\nit would take a few years for him to get back into the filmmaking game in the\n\nSeventies, his eventual return would yield a variety of intriguing films that\n\nfound Lester dabbling in a number of unusual genres. His return from the\n\nwilderness began when the father/son producing team of Alexander and Ilya\n\nSalkind hired him to direct an epic production of Alexandre Dumas’ “The\n\nThree Musketeers,” a project that he had once contemplated as a vehicle\n\nfor the Beatles. Instead, Lester brought together an all-star cast, including\n\nMichael York, Oliver Reed, Richard Chamberlain, Faye Dunaway, Christopher Lee,\n\nRaquel Welch, Spike Milligan and Charlton Heston and punched up the story with\n\na lot of humor and elaborate swordplay. Although Lester conceived it to be one\n\nlong film, the Salkinds decided to split it into two parts—“The Three Musketeers” (1973) and “The Four\n\nMusketeers” (1974)—and while this move enraged\n\nthe actors (who were now making two movies for the price of one), both parts\n\nproved to be hugely popular with critics and audiences alike and remain\n\narguably the definitive screen adaptation of the story.\n\nBetween\n\nthe releases of the two Musketeers films, Lester managed to squeeze out another\n\nfilm when he was hired at the last second to take over the production of\n\n“Juggernaut,” a suspense thriller about a bomb disposal team (led by\n\nRichard Harris) who are sent off to disarm a number of explosive devices that\n\nhave been hidden throughout an ocean liner in the middle of the North Atlantic\n\nsea while British police back on shore desperately try to uncover the identity\n\nof “Juggernaut,” the person who vows to blow up the ship unless they\n\nare paid $1.5 million dollars. (The story was inspired by a real-life bomb hoax\n\ninvolving the QE2 in 1972.) An uncommonly serious-minded effort for Lester\n\n(though it does have a couple of moments of humor), the film is as tense and\n\ngripping as they come as Lester manages to keep the white knuckle material\n\ngoing for nearly two solid hours, aided in no small part by an excellent cast\n\nthat also included the likes of Omar Sharif, Anthony Hopkins, Shirley Knight,\n\nIan Holm and David Hemmings.\n\nFor his\n\nnext film, Lester returned to a once-shelved plan to bring the adventures of\n\nSir Harry Paget Flashman, the lying, cheating, thieving and cowardly rat at the\n\ncenter of a series of comedic adventure novels by George MacDonald Fraser, to\n\nthe big screen. Based on the second book in the series, “Royal Flash”\n\n(1975) followed Flashman (Malcolm McDowell) as he is forced by Otto von\n\nBismarck (Oliver Reed) to impersonate a Danish prince about to marry a German\n\nprincess (Britt Ekland) as part of his diabolcal plan to unify Germany under\n\nhis rule. The film is funny enough in parts and McDowell is pretty much perfect\n\nas Flashman but the plot is little more than a rehash of “The Prisoner of\n\nZenda” and the blend of strange humor and action did not jell as well as\n\nit did with the Musketeers movies and critics and viewers alike were left cold\n\nby it.\n\nA far\n\nmore successful revisionary look at a familiar narrative, Lester’s next film,\n\n“Robin and Marian” (1976) offered moviegoers the sight of a now-aging\n\nRobin Hood (Sean Connery) returning from the Crusades at last to woo Maid\n\nMarian (Audrey Hepburn), who has become an abbess in the interim, while\n\nrescuing her from the depravations of the Sheriff of Nottingham (Robert Shaw).\n\nWhile the film may lack the derring-do of previous screen incarnations of the\n\nmyth, “Robin and Marian” is nevertheless a glorious work in which the\n\nperfectly cast Connery (in arguably his best performance of the Seventies) and\n\nHepburn (making her first screen appearance in 8 years) demonstrate incredible\n\nscreen chemistry and Lester dials down the comedy and visual flash so as to let\n\nit shine through even brighter. In the long history of Robin Hood films, this\n\none probably ranks behind only the Errol Flynn classic “The Adventures of\n\nRobin Hood” (1938), and there are times when I am convinced that it beats\n\nout even that one.\n\nThe rest\n\nof the decade saw Lester tackling a number of unfamiliar genres with mixed\n\nresults. “The Ritz” (1976) was an adaptation of the Terrence McNally\n\nplay that is set entirely within the confines of a gay bathhouse in Manhattan\n\nwhere a straight businessman (Jack Weston) has gone to hide out from his\n\nmobster brother-in-law (Jerry Stiller) with the usual wacky results. This\n\nattempt to do an updated version of the classic screwball comedies of old must have\n\nseemed promising on the page, but the results are a little too forced at times\n\nfor their own good and the laughs never really build, though Lester does get\n\ngood performances from the cast.\n\n“Butch and Sundance: The Early\n\nYears” (1979) remains one of the oddest entries in his filmography—not only was he entering the unfamiliar realm of the\n\nWestern but he was doing it with a prequel to one of the most beloved films of\n\nits time and one which derived much of its power from star casting that simply\n\nwasn’t possible this time around. The end result is not quite as bad as its\n\nreputation suggests, but the combination of a dramatically limited narrative\n\nand two stars (Tom Berenger and William Katt) who were simply not Paul Newman\n\nand Robert Redford helped to doom it. Far more interesting was “Cuba”\n\n(1979), a romantic melodrama set against the fall of the Batista government and\n\nthe rise of Fidel Castro that starred Sean Connery as an ex-soldier hired to\n\ntrain Batista’s men to fend off Castro’s army, a mission that he concedes from\n\nthe start is doomed to fail. While there, he runs into an old flame (Brooke\n\nAdams) who is now married to a sleazy plantation owner and their affair\n\nrekindles amidst the chaos of the ever-growing revolution. The parallels to\n\n“Casablanca” are obvious, but Lester finds a way to make the material\n\nseem fresh (something that Sydney Pollack was unable to do a decade later with\n\nthe similar “Havana”) and the romance between Connery and Adams\n\ngenerates some heat. Like many of Lester’s best works, this floundered in its\n\noriginal release but is ripe for rediscovery.\n\nLester\n\nrebounded commercially fairly quickly when his job serving as an uncredited\n\nproducer on “Superman” (a ploy by the Salkinds to goad director\n\nRichard Donner, with whom they were feuding, to quit) led to his being asked to\n\ndirect “Superman II,” the result of the Salkinds pulling another “Three\n\nMusketeers” by trying to do two movies at once. Although the production\n\nwas rocky and Lester was required to utilize footage that Donner had shot\n\n(including all the stuff with Gene Hackman), the resulting film was a hugely\n\nentertaining work that saw Lester shift the tone from the straightforward epic\n\nfeel of its predecessor to some more overtly comic book in nature—ironic since Lester claimed to have never read and comics\n\nbefore and to have had only the vaguest understanding of what Superman was in\n\nthe first place.\n\n“Superman\n\nIII” was also a Lester film, and while it’s a little\n\nbetter than its reputation, the picture is undone by a lame villain (Robert Vaughn as a\n\nstandard megalomaniacal millionaire who belongs in an episode of\n\n“Batman“) and the need to shoehorn Richard Pryor, then at the height\n\nof his box-off popularity, into a plot that simply did not need him.\n\n“Finders Keepers” (1984) was another stab at screwball farce, involving\n\na fugitive (Michael O'Keefe) who boards a train with a stolen coffin that\n\ncontains millions of dollars inside. Despite a decent cast (that also includes\n\nBeverly D'Angelo, David Wayne, Pamela Stephenson and a then-unknown Jim\n\nCarrey), it just never pulled together and is probably the most utterly\n\nindistinct film that Lester ever made.\n\nAfter a\n\nfive-year hiatus from filmmaking, Lester returned to the site of one of his\n\ngreatest former glories when he took on “The Return of the\n\nMusketeers” (1989), an adaptation of Dumas’s “Twenty Years\n\nAfter” that reunited several cast members from the original films\n\n(including Michael York, Oliver Reed, Richard Chamberlain, Christopher Lee and\n\nRoy Kinnear) along with newcomers C. Thomas Howell (as the son of Athos) and\n\nKim Cattrall (as the vengeance-seeking daughter of Milady de Winter) for more\n\nderring-do. During the production of the film, tragedy struck when Roy Kinnear,\n\nwho had worked with Lester several times in the past, was thrown from his horse\n\nduring the shooting of a scene and broke his pelvis. While being treated for\n\nhis injuries in a Spanish hospital, he had a heart attack and died. The\n\nincident crushed Lester, and since he no longer felt confident of his ability\n\nto protect his actors from harm, he essentially retired from filmmaking and\n\nwhile he never made a formal announcement along those lines, the only thing\n\nthat he has directed since then was “Get Back” (1991), a film\n\nchronicling Paul McCartney’s sold-out 1989 tour. To add insult to fatal injury,\n\n“The Return of the Musketeers” failed to find distribution in the\n\nU.S. and wound up making its debut on cable in 1991, making its showing at this\n\nretrospective its unofficial and long-delayed U.S. theatrical premiere.\n\nRichard\n\nLester has been a major force in the world of cinema over the last half-century.\n\nThe fact that he is not considered one of the great filmmakers of his time is\n\none of those sad flukes of cinema history that a retrospective like this will\n\nhopefully help to rectify. He may be most famous as “The Man Who Framed\n\nThe Beatles,” as one biography described him, but as anyone who checks out\n\nsome of his other films will quickly realize, he was much more than that."
