        "text": "We often find ourselves quoting famous lines from movies. From The Godfatherâs âan offer he canât refuseâ to The Terminatorâs âIâll be back!â films have provided dozens of memorable lines.\n\nBut you might be surprised how often almost everybody gets these movie quote wrong. These common misquotations are examples of whatâs become known as the 'Mandela Effectâ.\n\nThis is a phenomenon where a large group of people collectively misremember a fact. It gets its name from an incident in 2010, when many people on the internet said they clearly remembered Nelson Mandela dying in prison in the 1980s. In fact, Mandela was released in 1990 and died in 2013.\n\nHere are six movie lines that are often victims of the Mandela Effect.\n\nAsk any Star Wars fan what the most memorable line from any of the films is, and theyâll likely say itâs when Darth Vader reveals the shocking fact that he and Luke Skywalker are connected by more than just The Force. âLuke, I am your father,â Vader is supposed to have said to the young Jedi.\n\nOnly in reality Darth Vader doesnât ever say that. What he actually says is: âNo, I am your fatherâ after Luke accuses Vader of killing his dad.\n\nBut over the years the quote has been tidied up (probably so that it makes sense when removed from the context of the rest of the speech) and repeated so often that now the false line is the one that most people use when they want to quote the movie.\n\nâMirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?â Everybody knows that thatâs what the Evil Queen in Walt Disneyâs classic 1937 Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs says when sheâs fishing for compliments from the furniture, right?\n\nBut, you might have wondered, why does the vain sorceress feel the need to say the word âmirrorâ twice?\n\nThe answer is that, actually, she doesnât. In the film what she really says is: âMagic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?â Almost everybody has been getting it wrong for over 80 years.\n\nWell, not quite. The original story by the Brothers Grimm includes the phrase: \"Mirror, mirror, on the wall, Who in this land is fairest of all?\" - perhaps some people are remembering the book, rather than the film?\n\nWhen people find themselves in an unfamiliar situation they often quote a line from the classic 1939 movie The Wizard Of Oz. âI donât think weâre in Kansas anymore,â Judy Garland is supposed to have said to her dog, Toto, after they find themselves transported to the magical land of Oz.\n\nBut in fact the correct line is: âToto, Iâve a feeling weâre not in Kansas anymore.â The misquotation is so common it even happens in other movies, including 1989âs Honey I Shrunk The Kids. Youâd think theyâd have taken the time to check!\n\nSteven Spielbergâs 1975 classic suspense thriller about a killer shark terrorising the inhabitants of a small seaside town features one of the most consistently misquoted lines in movie history.\n\nPeople often say âWeâre gonna need a bigger boatâ when they want to point out that something is entirely inadequate for a demanding task. The line is supposedly delivered by Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) to shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) when he finally catches sight of the giant shark.\n\nBut most people get the quote wrong. In reality itâs: âYouâre gonna need a bigger boat.â\n\nStar Trek is one of the most successful science fiction franchises in entertainment history. Seven live-action television series (comprising hundreds of episodes), comics, novelisations and 13 feature films have been made under the Star Trek banner.\n\nAnd its most famous line is surely delivered when Captain Kirk (William Shatner) flips open his communicator and orders: âBeam me up, Scotty.â\n\nThe problem is Kirk never actually says that in any of the TV series or movies. The nearest he gets is âScotty, beam us upâ in the fourth Star Trek movie, Star Trek: The Voyage Home (1986)."
