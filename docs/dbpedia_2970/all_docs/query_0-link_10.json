        "text": "Petey Bowles (Moultrie Kelsall) prepares deckchairs on the seafront. The sea front at Worthing, Sussex.\n\nSunrise on Worthing seafront, but no sign of a deckchair attendant. SD\n\nA car drives through deserted streets. Chapel Road in Worthing with Union Place to the left.\n\nThe same deserted street, at the same time in the morning. SD\n\nChapel Road with The Fountain Hotel on the corner of Chatsworth Road.\n\nThe Fountain, after a few name changes, is currently known as Bar Release. SD\n\nHeading from Chapel Road onto the roundabout at the junction of Liverpool Road and Warwick Street with South Street in the right distance.\n\nThe roundabout was removed in 1997 when the area was pedestrianized. The clock was repositioned near to the entrance of the Guildbourne Shopping centre. SD\n\nSouth Street in Worthing, which has resided in West Sussex since 1974.\n\nNow with less road and more pavement. SD\n\nThe Pavilion Theatre was restored to its former glory after the removal of an unflattering canopy which was added in the 1970s. SD\n\nStreetlights still burn as the dawn brightens. Marine Parade with properties on Heene Terrace standing to the extreme left.\n\nI tried, but my stepladder was just not high enough to reach up level with the streetlight. SD\n\nLooking along Marine Parade from Heene Terrace with Worthing Pier in the distance and the Beach Hotel to the left. The promenade and hotel also feature in 'Up The Junction'. SD\n\nUnemployed Stanley Webber (Robert Shaw) stands outside the dreary guest house where he is a resident. This is Eriswell Road, Worthing in Sussex.\n\nA clear view of the house during a momentary absence of cars. SD\n\nShamus McCann and Nat Goldberg drive away with Stanley on the morning after his \"birthday party\". Facing the junction of Eriswell Road, Montague Street, Rowlands Road and Western Place.\n\nTurn right along Rowlands Road and you will find a 'Wish You Were Here' location. SD\n\nPetey peers through the window as the car disappears into the town. Eriswell Road, Worthing.\n\nNo-one watching me through the window but the cat was quite curious. SD\n\nThe camera pulls back for a last view of the seaside town on another hot day. Looking south towards the seafront from Eriswell Road in Worthing, Sussex."
