        "text": "It’s tee time for Quinta Brunson.\n\nPoint Grey Pictures is teaming with the “Abbott Elementary” star and her production company Fifth Chance on the upcoming comedy feature “Par for the Course” for Universal Pictures. She is set to star in the film alongside “Everything Everywhere All At Once” standout Stephanie Hsu.\n\nBrunson will also co-write alongside “Abbott Elementary” scribe Justin Tan, who will also direct the project in his feature debut. Alex McAtee is set to produce on behalf of Point Grey under its first-look deal with Universal.\n\nPoint Grey was founded in 2011 by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, and is behind projects including “Joy Ride,” “Neighbors” and “Miller’s Girl.” Most recently, Point Grey released the fourth season of Prime Video’s “The Boys” and “Sausage Party: Foodtopia.”\n\nPlot details for the film, based on an original idea from Brunson, are being kept under wraps.\n\n“I’m so excited to be working with Point Grey and Universal on’ Par for the Course.’ This is a comedy close to my heart, and who better to do it with than some of the best producers in the game,” Brunson said in a statement. “I’ve known Seth, Evan, [Point Grey president James Weaver] and Alex for a while and I’m happy to finally work on a project together. Justin Tan is my long-term comedy partner and collaborator, and we are thrilled to have the chance to work together on a film. Stephanie is a talent we are so fortunate to unite with, I can’t wait to see what we can do together on screen.”\n\n“We’re so thrilled at the opportunity to get to work with Quinta,” Rogen said. “She’s one of our most incredible comedic voices working today, and it’s such an honor to get to work alongside her and watch what she brings to this project.”\n\nSenior executive vice president of production development Erik Baiers and creative executive Jacqueline Garell will oversee the project on behalf of the studio."
