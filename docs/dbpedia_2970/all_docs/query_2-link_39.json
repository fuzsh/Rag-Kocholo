        "text": "January 15, 2017\n\nJohn French was Robert Shaw's agent for the last few years of Shaw's life, so he is the ideal person to write with (at least some) inside knowledge of this fine actor. Shaw has given some great screen performances, my favourites being in From Russia With Love, Jaws & The Taking Of Pelham 123. However, this book covers his theatre work, of which I knew littlle & his writing, of which I knew nothing. Although he made some poor decisions during his career his talent was undoubtedly vast. Unfortunately as a person he does come across (to me at least) as a bit of a prick. This book has not chnaged the fact that I will always enjoy his performances, but his personality leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nFebruary 2, 2018\n\nVery disappointing. More about the processes of getting a movie made, staging a play, and avoiding taxes.\n\nJanuary 25, 2020\n\nI would expect that the author being Robert's agent should have known that Quint was talking about the USS Indianapolis not Philadelphia. Was this proof read? Robert Redford is called Bedford at least twice. What other inaccuracies are in here that we would not find so obvious?\n\nMay 9, 2019\n\nA fascinating book about an immensely talented but difficult and not very likeable man. (It is hard to warm to a man who seems to have used 'boy' as his common form of address to other males.)\n\nIt is often frustratingly short on detail about Shaw's acting, either film or stage - on the other hand if you want to know about his marital complexities, his tax affairs or the prices he paid for expensive cars you have come to the right shop. The title 'The Price of Success' is literally true - we learn a lot about Shaw's relationship with his accountants.\n\n(Actually the details of what it meant to be an artistic tax exile in the late 1960s and 1970s are really quite fascinating, as are the details of the finer points of 'billing' - important given Shaw's absurdly competitive personality.)\n\nConsidering the book's relative neglect of Shaw's acting and its sometimes mercenary tone it is surprisingly good on his now largely forgotten writing career - it is odd to think that Shaw was considered one of the really important novelists of the 1960s, given that his novels are comprehensively out-of-print, and not even considered rare or collectible. Surely it is time for a reevaluation of his novels...\n\nAugust 22, 2023\n\nI was interested in knowing more about Shaw after watching a few of his Harold Pinter plays and seeing him in films, the book is interesting but unfortunately focuses more on how movies are made and how actors avoided tax, was looking for a more in-depth look into Shaw psyche, but this wasn't really that. There are also quite a lot of errors, it's clearly been poorly proof read.\n\nI also think the writer should've set aside his obvious dislike for Shaw, obviously Shaw doesn't sound like a very nice character, but the book might have had less bias to show this. Sometimes it was frustrating, with obvious inaccuracies, at one point the writer writes that after Shaw moved to Ireland it all went down hill in terms of career. But that couldn't be true considering this was when he made \"The Taking of Pelham one two three\" and \"Jaws\" ?\n\nJune 21, 2023\n\nI was aware of previous reviews of this biography, most of them being negative. I can certainly understand the reasons!\n\nRobert Shaw is an outstanding actor, one of the greatest to emerge during the late 1950s. I wanted to know something about the man, so I bought John French's biography.\n\nIt made for tough reading: the manuscript is full of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. With Robert Shaw being a writer of some repute, I dread to imagine his reaction to reading such a mess! French doesn't seem to like his own subject, considering he portrays him in a negative light for the most part. Such a disappointment!\n\nThe only other Robert Shaw biography, is \"More Than a Life.\" Alas, this one is long out-of-print and considerably expensive.\n\nOctober 8, 2017\n\nThis biography is carefully researched and crafted to tell the story of Robert Shaw; the man, husband, father, actor and writer. We remember him vividly if we have seen his films but this is another story (well told) of a gifted individual shaped by a childhood he never entirely escaped. As successful as he became the book leaves us wondering how successful he might have been. I would have loved to have seen more about him from the perspective of others, particularly his surviving wife, and his children. Well worth investigating for fans of quality writing about the lives of creative people.\n\nMay 20, 2020\n\nMay be the worst book I have ever read. Poorly written. The author seems to really not like the subject at all. Apparently he was fired by Shaw. Author doesn't deal with Shaw's film successes just blows right by them and yet when he fails French goes on and on. Not one single positive thing in this mans life was discussed or examined. Horrible. There is another biography n of Shaw out there. It isn't great either but better than this.\n\nJuly 11, 2021\n\nGreat biography of a great actor who squandered his talents. He could have been up there with the likes of Burton and O'Toole but seemed to be distracted by too many irons in the fire; novel writing, play writing, screenplays and of course acting. Also beset by money and legal problems topped off with out of control drinking. After his finest performance as Quint in Jaws he choose his next six films poorly and then was gone.\n\nApril 16, 2021\n\nAfter reading this book I found the actor Robert Shaw to be quite an unpleasant nasty man.the read is a bit boring his life was all about money and getting drunk and he seemed such a rude man. Not a Robert Shaw fan.\n\nMarch 18, 2016\n\nA decent biography of the actor by the man who was his agent during the '70s. French knew all the ins and outs of his finances and there's quite a lot of detail about his earnings, the cost of his many cars and the various methods he adopted to avoid paying tax. Shaw was extremely competitive and became a severe alcoholic, but he had his good points too, being genuinely free of snobbery and faithful to his wives (well, almost). He comes across as shockingly cold when his second wife, actress Mary Ure, dies, although it's probable that he was just not given to public displays of emotion and felt it deeply inside. French is also good on his writing, which is often overlooked. It's ultimately a tragic story, though, and if there's a lesson here, it's that having a ton of money really won't bring you happiness.\n\nNovember 3, 2015\n\nVery good biography, written by someone who knew Robert Shaw personally. Best known as Quint in \"Jaws\" or as one of James Bond's opponents in \"From Russia With Love\", Shaw had much greater talents as an actor and writer than many people might know. However he was, apparently, a tortured spirit, always driven to compete, and haunted by his alcoholic father's suicide. Sadly he also started drinking too much and died of a heart attack at the age of 51. I found this an excellent biography which left you with the feeling of a great talent that burned out too soon."
