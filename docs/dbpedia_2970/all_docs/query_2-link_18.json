        "text": "Profile\n\nA hardened killer in the pay of SPECTRE, Red Grant is simply emotionless: without friends or family. His dedication to his job usually consists of tracking and dispatching unwanted SPECTRE targets. He is loyal to this terrorist organisation only because he knows, when off duty, they keep him in the lap of luxury. He is handy with any gun - an expert marksman with a riffle - but his weapon of choice is a garroting cable, concealed in his watch.\n\n\"My orders are to kill you and deliver the Lektor. How I do it is my business. It'll be slow and painful.\"\n\nPersonality\n\nBefore entering the service of SPECTRE, Grant was a psychopathic killer on the loose. He shows no remorse, taking slow, sick pleasure with each kill. He has since been tamed by the trainers at SPECTRE and his urges are rewarded dutifully if he obeys his superiors every command. Grant convinces himself he can live like a \"normal\" person this way.\n\nInvolvement\n\nGrant is recommended by Morzeny, the SPECTRE trainer, that he would be the best man for Col. Klebb's carefully orchestrated plan. Grant is trained to speak English with a plummy accent and told to follow James Bond and protect him from harm until the 00-agent gets what SPECTRE wants, the Lektor Decoder. At the gypsy campsite, Grant is not fooled by Kerim's decoy car and follows the him and Bond to the camp. Here, when the Russians raid the site, Grant saves 007's life unseen.\n\nLater, on the train and with the Lektor and its pretty operator in tow, Bond and Grant come face to face when 007 calls in backup. The killer easily dispatches with the real Captain Nash and takes his place, convincing Bond he has planned an escape route for the whole party. In reality that route will be for just one, after Red dispatches with 007 and the girl. Bond eventually comes to his senses but only seconds before Grant pulls a gun on him. Grant is tempted by the secret stash of money in the Q-Branch case, and Bond uses the concealed tear gas to disorientate Grant and attack. The pair struggle in the confines of the train compartment with Bond eventually garroting the SPECTRE man with his own weapon. Bond never discovered this assassin's real name.\n\nBiography\n\nBorn in 1927, Robert Archibald Shaw, grew up in Lancashire, England. His father and mother were both in the medical profession but their son would choose something different. He schooled in Lancashire until he was 12 and upon the death of his father, the family moved to Cornwall. He was educated at Truro, excelling at physical activities. He was later accepted to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London. He moved to London on Â£1,000 inheritance.\n\nSome argue his career climaxed with the Spielberg production \"Jaws\" (1975), in which he played the rather mad shark-hunter Sam Quint. By the end of the 1970s, Shaw worked with Connery once more, as the sheriff in the classic tale of \"Robin and Marion\" (1976), along with Richard Harris, Ian Holm and Audrey Hepburn.\n\n\"Wish you could see the headlines: 'British agent murders beautiful Russian spy, then commits suicide.'\"\n\nSadly, on the set of \"Avalanche Express\", Shaw was stricken with a heart attack and passed away on 28 August 1978, in Tourmakeady, County Mayo, Ireland. He left 10 children behind him.\n\nShare The Story"
