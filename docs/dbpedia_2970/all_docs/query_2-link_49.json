        "text": "Watching a trio of legendary stars dazzle is just one of the reasons the 1973 classic “The Sting” is a must see film for Mob Movie March.\n\nSet in depression era Chicago, “The Sting” is an old-school heist-styled movie with intricate plots, slick dialogue, and ultra-cool characters. Johnny Hooker (Robert Redford) is a street hustler who must partner with legendary con artist Henry Gondorff (Paul Newman) to take down a ruthless Irish mobster (Robert Shaw).\n\nHollywood icons Paul Newman and Robert Redford are in their prime here, and show us why both had careers spanning decades in the starlight. Newman is as cool as they come in the role of Henry Gondorff. A shell of his former self, depressed and drunk, Gondorff takes the young Johnny under his wing to teach him the art of the long con.\n\nYou can practice acting but there’s just something about Paul Newman that can’t be taught. He has a presence on screen that brings the character to life in a way that only the best can do. His legendary blue eyes are on full display, and his iconic wink makes the character truly memorable. Robert Redford was just 37 at the time, and “The Sting” was his first real strike into a blockbuster role. Redford is equally impressive.\n\nFor me, the most epic performance of the film comes courtesy of Robert Shaw as Irish mobster Doyle Lonnegan. Shaw has written, appeared, and starred in a number of stage and screen productions, but is best known as the salty shark hunter Quint in the 1975 classic “Jaws.”\n\nWatching Shaw’s performance in “The Sting” has made him an all-time favorite. He mesmerizes on screen with a perfectly ruthless demeanor that will make you relish every scene he is in. The card game in which Lonnegan squares off against Gondorff is one of the best scenes you will ever watch. The limp that the character employs is not by accident; Shaw had injured his knee just before the start of filming, and by chance it adds to the mystery of the character.\n\nThe setting for “The Sting” is perfect to get your mob on; the streets, alleys, and parlor rooms of 1936 Chicago. Outfits are amazing, and the set itself will take you back in time. Director George Roy Hill divides the movie with title cards, and the inclusion of the ragtime piano melody “The Entertainer” is nothing short of brilliant for placing you right there along with the story. Hill employs other tactics, such as limiting the number of extras and specific usage of color schemes to make the 1930s era stand out on its own.\n\n“The Sting” won seven Academy Awards and was nominated for three others. The ancillary characters are all excellent, complementing the top stars with the likes of Robert Earl Jones and the great Charles Durning. Charles Dierkop is the very definition of “character actor” as Lonnegan’s unnamed bodyguard.\n\n“The Sting” is a great film that has stood the test of time. Its complex plot and bevy of iconic characters makes it a fun watch at any time. It’s got action and drama but none too serious. The acting and story are some of the best aspects for any movie ever.\n\nby – Matt DeCristo"
