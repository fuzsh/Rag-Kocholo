        "text": "Dive into the drama behind the scenes of JAWS!\n\nFADE IN: The open ocean, 1974. Filming is delayed…again. The lead actors—theatre veteran Robert Shaw and young Hollywood hotshots Richard Dreyfuss and Roy Scheider—are crammed into a too-small boat, entirely at the mercy of foul weather and a faulty mechanical co-star. Alcohol flows, egos collide, and tempers flare on a chaotic voyage that just might lead to cinematic magic…if it doesn’t sink them all.\n\nStep aboard the Orca and into The Shark is Broken , a “profound dive behind the scenes of the making of Jaws” (Daily Telegraph). This Olivier Award-nominated new play is “hilariously brilliant and pure genius” raves the Sunday Express, and stars Ian Shaw (War Horse, Common) as his father, Robert Shaw.\n\nThe Shark is Broken celebrates movie history and peeks at the choppy waters behind Hollywood’s first blockbuster. Short tempers. Short circuits. 95 minutes, no intermission.\n\n★★★★★ “Ian Shaw gives one of the most exhilaratingly theatrical performances of the year” Evening Standard\n\n★★★★★ “Sensational fun” Sunday Express\n\n★★★★★ “Wonderful” Daily Telegraph\n\nCheck out our new 360º Virtual Tour of the Main House auditorium, bars, foyers and Front of House areas\n\nBox Office phone lines are open from 10am - 6pm Monday - Saturday.\n\nDoors open 30 minutes prior to the performance, unless otherwise stated.\n\nTickets for Main House productions may include a £2.50 building levy.\n\nPlease see the ACCESS page for details regarding our Access Register and associated discounts.\n\nA booking fee of £3 per ticket applies to all bookings.\n\nThere is a lift for wheelchair users from the Theatre foyer to the Stalls and Royal Circle levels.
