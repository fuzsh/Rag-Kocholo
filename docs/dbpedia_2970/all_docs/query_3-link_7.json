        "text": "A rough-hewn British character actor who played more leading roles later in his career, Robert Shaw went from being typecast as tough-guy villains to proving his versatility in a wide range of performances. Shaw had his start on the stage in the late 1940s and quickly segued to the screen where he broke through as an assassin for SPECTRE in \"From Russia with Love\" (1963). But it was his Oscar-nominated turn as King Henry VIII in \"A Man for All Seasons\" (1966) that helped shed new light on the actor, leading to a variety of characters in films like \"Battle of Britain\" (1969), \"A Town Called Hell\" (1971) and \"Young Winston\" (1972). Shaw then entered his most fruitful period to play ruthless mob boss Doyle Lonnegan in \"The Sting\" (1973) and criminal mastermind Mr. Blue in \"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three\" (1974), which paved the way for his most iconic performance as salty Quint in Steven Spielberg's \"Jaws\" (1975). From there, Shaw was a leading man in a number of major studio films like \"Black Sunday\" (1977), \"Force 10 from Navarone\" (1977) and \"Avalanched Express\" (1979). But at the height of his career, Shaw suffered a fatal heart attack. Whether on screen or as the author of award-winning novels, Shaw was a unique talent the likes of whom would not be seen again."
