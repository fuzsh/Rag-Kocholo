        "text": "‘The Exorcist’ (1973)\n\nShyamalan’s choice for the best horror film of all time, according to his interview with Letterboxd is ‘The Exorcist.’ William Friedkin’s 1973 film about the demonic possession of a young girl is one of the most influential films of its genre, and its impact can be seen in several of Shyamalan’s films, including ‘The Sixth Sense.’\n\n‘Rebecca’ (1940)\n\nIn 2013, Shyamalan shared several of his favorite films in an interview with Rotten Tomatoes. One of his choices was Alfred Hitchcock’s Best Picture winner ‘Rebecca,’ a gothic romance based on the novel by Daphne du Maurier about a young bride haunted by the memory of her husband’s first wife.\n\n‘I love it, so elegantly done, I so fell in love with those characters, the performances were amazing. It was epic and haunting, and it was just its own perfect little gem that will never be re-created,’ Shyamalan said.\n\n‘Being There’ (1979)\n\nAnother film that Shyamalan shared as one of his favorites in his Rotten Tomatoes interview is ‘Being There,’ Hal Ashby’s 1979 satirical comedy about a simple-minded gardener who becomes enmeshed in the world of Washington, D.C. politics. Shyamalan called Ashby’s film ‘bold, bold, bold genre-breaking filmmaking, and will always be kind of a beacon of originality for me.’\n\n‘High and Low’ (1963)\n\nIn 2023, Shyamalan did an interview with French news site Konbini where he selected several DVDs from a store. One of the movies he choose was Akira Kurosawa’s ‘High and Low,’ a police thriller about detectives attempting to solve a kidnapping case. Shyamalan said that he had a poster of the film in his house, and cited the film as something he watched as inspiration for ‘Knock at the Cabin.’\n\n‘The Birds’ (1963)\n\nAnother film that Shyamalan noted as an inspiration for ‘Knock at the Cabin’ in his video with Konbini is Hitchcock’s ‘The Birds,’ about a small island town plagued by a mysterious epidemic of attacking birds. Shyamalan noted that the film helped him with filming the isolated, trapped-in-one-house scenes during ‘Knock at the Cabin’ and called the movie ‘As good as it gets.’\n\n‘A Man Escaped’ (1956)\n\nIn his Konbini video, Shyamalan said that he first watched ‘A Man Escaped’ — a drama from Robert Bresson about a French resistance leader plotting a jail escape — after his daughter Ishana Night Shyamalan called him raving about the experience of seeing it in film school.\n\n‘I was astonished at how much tension and how much beauty you can get out of simplicity,’ Shyamalan said about the experience of watching the movie. ‘I’m astonished, I’m in awe of this movie.’\n\n‘Raw’ (2016)\n\nJulia Ducournau’s breakout feature ‘Raw’ made waves during its 2016 release for its graphic and bloody story of a veterinarian student who discovers a taste for cannibalism. In his video with Konbini, Shyamalan called the film ‘incredible’ and ‘profound,’ and said he became friends with Ducournau — who directed an episode of his TV series ‘Servant’ — after first seeing the project."
