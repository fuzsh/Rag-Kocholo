The movie, like the play, forces us to accept a horror story that has no reasonable antecedents: Stanley (Robert Shaw) is the only guest at a rundown, seaside boarding house owned by Meg (Dandy Nichols) and Petey (Moultrie Kelsall). Into their lives of placid desperation come two strangers, Goldberg (Sydney Tafler), tackily urbane and garrulous, and McCann (Pattrick Magee), a faithful goon. They have been sent by someone named Monty and "the organization" to retrieve Stanley.

Just how one interprets their confrontations, alternately joshing and menacing, before, during and after a birthday party for Stanley (who swears it's not his birthday), is not particularly important, though it does have the outline of an operation by a sort of metaphysical syndicate.

Rather it is fascinating as a dramatization of a world in which language never quite matches events, and in which events are rearranged  parsed like the pieces of a sentenceso that logic and sanity never quite hold.

Excerpt from NYTimes located HERE

Film version of Pinter's first full-length play, a rather unsubtle and flashy piece of seaside gothic in which a scruffy, stay-at-home boarding-house lodger is terrorised by two sinister visitors: rather clever inversions of the stereotypic stage Jew and Irishman. Seems long and fussy, partly the fault of both play and director, but some marvellous performances (Nichols creating her Silly Moo character, Tafler superb as the anecdotal Goldberg) make it worth seeing.
