Robert Shaw (born August 9, 1927, Westhoughton, Lancashire, England—died August 28, 1978, Tourmakeady, Ireland) was an English actor, novelist, and playwright who first garnered attention for his performances in Shakespearean plays before launching a successful film career.

Shaw began his career with the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, where he performed in Macbeth, Cymbeline, Henry VIII, and other Shakespeare plays, touring Australia with the company in 1949–50. With the Old Vic company (1951–52), he continued primarily in Shakespearean roles. In 1955 Shaw began playing contemporary characters, including one in his own play Off the Mainland (1956) and the role of Sergeant Mitchem in The Long and the Short and the Tall (1959). He first performed in the United States in 1961 in Harold Pinter’s The Caretaker. During this period Shaw also was cast in the leading role in the British TV series The Buccaneers (1956–57).
