        "text": "For this week's post, I wanted to share some of my favorite harsh vocalists in metal! They aren't listed in any particular order, as this is just a list of some of my top growlers and screamers. I will be doing a second part because there are many more that I want to include. Scroll and enjoy, and as always, Devil Horns Up ðŸ¤˜ !\n\n1. Tatiana Shmaylyuk, Jinjer\n\nI was first exposed to Ukraine's Jinjer, like many others, when I heard their song \"Pisces,\" and was pleasantly surprised when after singing the first verse, Tatiana Shmaylyuk broke out her growls on the chorus. From there, I was sucked in immediately and was not only amazed by their discography, but also Shmaylyuk's voice, and how amazing her growls are. Their most recent album, Macro, was especially a highlight of 2019 and one of the year's best metal albums. I would definitely recommend \"On the Top,\" \"Under the Dome,\" and \"Teacher, Teacher!\" as some of their best songs. A very memorable moment discovering them!\n\nWith Lamb of God's Randy Blythe, I find his growls to be among the most unique in the genre, easily discernible from miles away. His deep and visceral vocals do not only make Lamb of God one of the biggest bands in metal, but they also make an impact on the whole genre, as seen through his collaborations with bands like Gojira, Doyle, Eluveite, and more. The recent self titled Lamb of God album is proof that Blythe is and will continue to be a prevalent act in the genre, with a career spanning over 20 years!\n\nA relatively new and upcoming vocalist, Lauren Hart is the lead singer of death metal's Once Human. I discovered her through her collaboration with Kamelot on their 2018 album, The Shadow Theory, where she did guest vocals on songs \"Mindfall Remedy\" and \"Phantom Divine (Shadow Empire).\" If you have not heard her vocals, what are you waiting for!? When I tell you how in awe I was of her vocals on these songs, I really mean it. After having the songs on repeat, I decided to check out Once Human, and after hearing \"Eye of Chaos,\" I was an instant fan. Appearances can be deceiving!\n\nSurprisingly, as a huge Lacuna Coil fan, I have seen many criticize Andrea Ferro's vocals. I have always been a fan of his vocals, especially his growls, which I believe greatly compliment Cristina Scabbia's voice (hence the amazing effect of the \"Beauty and the Beast\" vocal dynamic). They are used on their earlier works, but their two most recent albums, Delirium and Black Anima, really show off just how angry and ferocious his vocals are, especially on their recent song \"Layers of Time.\" Just listen to him open their recent album screaming \"We are the anima!\"\n\nThe first female vocalist I began listening to that did growls, Alissa White-Gluz blew me away with her vocals, especially the wide range her growls and screaming had. This is evident on The Agonist's early albums with her as lead singer. After leaving the band and joining Arch Enemy in 2014, she proved to be a perfect fit for the band with the single \"War Eternal,\" showcasing a vicious ear attack (which is a huge compliment!) that solidified her as one the greatest vocalists in the genre. Queen Beast indeed!\n\nBehemoth was my first venture into black metal, with 2009's Evangelion, specifically the song \"Ov Fire and the Void.\" From what I had heard of black metal, I had always found it a bit hard to listen to it not because of the music, but the vocal style, which sometimes would turn me off from a song. I am glad to say that Behemoth's Nergal and his brutal vocals completely got me hooked into the band's catalog, with their iconic 2014 record \"The Satanist\" being one of my favorite albums of all time. Not to mention his outstanding stage presence as well!"
