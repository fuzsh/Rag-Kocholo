        "text": "I can't say that I was ever a major Lacuna Coil fan, but I did listen to their first four albums and went to a few of their concerts in the 2000s. They then took a turn in a strange direction that was much more pop-infused, and not even in an interesting way. I understand bands updating themselves and keeping up with the times, but this switch always seemed misguided to me, as it produced very few truly memorable songs, with the exception of the anthem \"Nothing Stands In Our Way\" from 'Broken Crown Halo'.\n\nOut of nowhere comes 'Black Anima', which I heard them play in full in 2019 during a concert I went to mostly because they happened to be the only interesting band in town... and wow. What the hell? Suddenly they had modernized in the right way? I cannot say that I followed much that ensued in the four albums after 'Karmacode', so I can't really affirm if this was a gradual evolution or not, but it doesn't feel that way. This feels like much more of a reinvention than anything.\n\nAn element that immediately stands out in this album is the vocals, coming from two members who have been part of Lacuna Coil since its formation. Cristina feels very comfortable exploring her voice in several different directions, from something sweet and more mainstream to the raspy and gothic to the operatic. It sounds overall like she actually managed to find whatever it was she had been looking for artistically. This lends the album a great amount of variety, and the female vocals have their own sonic signature in each song.\n\nMeanwhile, Andrea has mostly given up on clean vocals and become a full-time growler... something that persisted in the re-recording 'Comalies XX' from three years later. Good on him. Andrea was never the best clean singer, and by going in this direction, he manages to contribute much more to their sound. I'd dare to say that his growled vocals are the standout of Black Anima, which is something I could never have imagined saying before. The exceptions are \"Veneficium\" (which still has growls laid over the clean vocals) and \"The End Is All I Can See,\" which coincidentally or not is by far the weakest song on the album.\n\nIn terms of instrumentation, the band is pulling from a much more core/groove basis, employing more chugging and staccato work on the stringed section, like in the explosive leading track \"Sword of Anger,\" which sets the tone of the album in a brilliant way. The bass lines are loud and present, with a lot of plucked notes that allow you to hear the metallic texture of the strings. This is something which is very well complemented by the drum work, which guides the band through the variety of tempos that they propose to navigate in this album. The production of bass and drums is very punchy and feels quite modern, which was a good call for the style they are going for.\n\nThis aspect of variety is a strength of 'Black Anima'. It's hard to get tired of the album because it keeps throwing different tempos and ideas in your direction. For example, fans of classic Lacuna Coil will likely find a song to love in \"Apocalypse,\" which could easily have come from their 'Comalies' era. Meanwhile, the doom-infused title track \"Black Anima\" barely sounds like them, being heavy, dragged out, and having keyboard lines that sound more like second phase After Forever. You also have more accessible and agitated songs like \"Under the Surface,\" which are like a good rendition of what they were trying to compose during their middling era.\n\nOverall, this is a return to form. Fans and casual listeners that had given up on the band should really give it a listen, and their resurgence in popularity in festivals and such seems to also be a clear signal that this was a move in the right direction. I'm glad they are regaining their footing... the gothic metal scene is the better for it.\n\nAnything that Lacuna Coil has released after Delirium doesn’t really capture my attention that much if not at all. That is, until Black Anima arrives on scene. Okay. Let’s see what the band has in store for us this time. At first, I wasn’t expecting anything. It could be Delirium 2.0 for all I know. Well, I have to admit I am wrong. Black Anima is something else altogether. Nothing that they have done in the previous two records are in this album. Hell, those good old days are somewhat gone now and it seems that Lacuna Coil is reborn with a newfound identity.\n\nA little bit about the band’s image before we talk about the music; it’s rather odd that the band chooses to smear their faces with makeup akin to early Mudvayne. The newfound identity I mentioned earlier might be a case of Lacuna Coil going through some identity crisis. Of course, it is a gimmick. What else is new, right? Nevertheless, with this new image, Lacuna Coil also embraced an overall sound that can be described as, should I say, angrier? Despite opening the album with a monologue that sounds a little silly to my ear what with Scabbia’s almost childish voice repeating Anima Nera over and over, the track eventually segues into the real deal that would shape the entire record.\n\nSword of Anger opens rather unusually strong even for Lacuna Coil. Andrea Ferro returns with his most vicious death growl to date. I think he must have damaged his vocal cord or something because he sounds torn apart. That is something I am totally unprepared for. I mean, he did try really hard screaming into the mic two albums before but here, he seems to have it all figured out what works best for him. Plus, his vocal qualities remain consistent throughout the remainder of the tracks. Of course, there are some studio trickeries involved but at least his vocals don’t sound that annoying compared to those found in previous releases. Moreover, our 50-year-old Cristina Scabbia is not showing any sign of slowing down either. Like Ferro, she has some help in terms of vocal correction and synthesizer in the studio. However, watching Scabbia belt some high notes while performing songs from this record on Live Apocalypse truly shows that she still has it in her. Albeit at times you can see she has to muster every ounce of her strength to hit those high notes heard in my favorite tracks Apocalypse and Veneficium, with great difficulties. (There are videos of them performing songs from this album floating on YouTube. I think there aren’t any audience in the video due to COVID restrictions, just them performing by themselves).\n\nThe meat and potato of this album is the guitars, only occasionally masked with some audio effects to hype up the massive sound. Generally, the production shapes the guitar sound too thin and steely for its own good. As a result, the guitars however heavy seemed to blur together with the bass. As we all know, Lacuna Coil really looked up to KoRn so that nu metal bass reverberation is the only annoying thing that the band has refused to let go since the Karmacode days. Since production is stretched too thin on this record, the guitars suffer from what I refer to as post millennial guitar syndrome; while the guitars have this massive wall of sound coming right at you, the steely vibe mentioned earlier renders the end product to be sterile and inorganic. Yes. Overly processed and digitized. This is the same symptom I have noticed in a lot of metal records produced after 2020 onwards. Creed’s last album and Conquer Divide’s recent single both shared this type of sound.\n\nNevertheless, the songs themselves are individually okay despite the pitfalls in terms of how the guitars are engineered. Another surprise is the presence of multiple memorable solos that are greatly improved from anything they have ever done before. Tracks like Reckless can be described as having superfluous, lavish harmonics to it so when the leads are played, they heightened the taxing atmosphere of desperation. 01:58 into the song is where Diego Cavalotti exemplifies a good sense of melody with that arpeggio picking up and down the fretboard. Brief but tastefully done. Hence, Lacuna Coil made the right choice in recruiting Cavalotti into their ranks because I think he has brought some positive changes to the band in terms of riff and solos. On the other hand, previous axeman Marco Coti-Zelati is relegated to handling bass, synth and keys and he does his job just fine.\n\nPretty much the lead guitars are the saving grace on Black Anima. Apocalypse and Veneficium are two of the best tracks on this record. These two songs go together in defining the band’s latest sound. Not only the rhythm, power chords and riffs used on these songs are memorable, the solos are so good that I couldn’t believe at first that I was actually listening to Lacuna Coil. 02:42 mark in Apocalypse is perhaps the best example of this and you have to hear it to believe. I am not exaggerating here. I don’t recall when the last time Lacuna Coil was ever this good when it comes to lead guitars. The melodic build-up creates this sense of ascension that is so uplifting yet melancholic at the same time. Not only the solos are good here in Apocalypse, but the entire song has also been slowly constructing that sense of anticipation from the beginning. You have some otherworldly ethereal choral effect that deliberately places each piece in your mind like Tetris blocks so when the lead solos come in, you get this absolute feel of exhilarating disbelief because there hasn’t been such a lead solo this good in such a long time in the band’s back catalogue.\n\nIt’s refreshing to hear something that is not really a game changer, but a new perspective on what this album is capable of. It’s not exactly a one-hit-wonder type of thing; just when I thought Apocalypse is the only best written song on Black Anima, Veneficium hits me like a block of ice being thrown into my face. The solos on this song are hell a lot more melodic than the one in Apocalypse despite the overall technique of gradual build up is yet again repeated here. Simple yet effectively mournful, giving the song an extra textural layer that adds to its already immense depth.\n\nWhether the band is attempting to reinvigorate their sense of aggression with tracks like Now or Never and Under the Surface, or pummeling listeners with their persistent melancholy harkening back to Karmacode era with Save Me, which is another good song on this record what with its enchanting vocal lines, Lacuna Coil seems to have it together this time around and it’s for the better. Even the extra tracks on the bonus disc have some memorable moments thanks to the ubiquitous melodicism the band is known for especially in Black Dried Hearts and Through the Flames. There is some ritualistic feel to songs like The End is All I Can See and Black Feathers as well, something that the band has dabbled in with Broken Crown Halo but failed miserably before. I think now the keyboard is used to some degree in creating that mystical feel but at times, it can feel as if the output is overly compressed because of the synthetical interference.\n\nThe new drummer Richard Meiz is also a blessing for Lacuna Coil because he is such a capable performer that suits the band revamped sound well. His footwork follows the chugging rhythm which, at times, can be tricky to follow due to its near constant groove on majority of the songs particularly om Layers of Time. His fills are okay as well. Unfortunately, the production is so paper thin that we get a rather plastic like sound with his triggered kick drums, toms and snare. The cymbals are somewhat low in the mix, which is weird.\n\nAll in all, Black Anima is a nice surprise from Lacuna Coil. It feels as if they have been given the opportunity to redeem themselves after nonsensical experimentation with previous materials that resulted in the band receiving so much derision from fans longtime and casual alike. They are not breaking new ground with this record but at least they have done something right musically. That, in my book is enough to make me undergo rebaptism with Cristina Scabbia’s vaginal secretion and turn me into a born-again fan for the last time.\n\nSo, if you are not a fan and want to get acquainted with Lacuna Coil, this album is a good start. Depending on your taste (if you are non-fan or first timer), you may go as far back as the debut and work your way up to Broken Crown Halo. Just avoid Shallow Life and Delirium; these two are used tampons. For Black Anima, get the special two-disc edition, it’s really worth it. Recommended listening during rainy afternoon going into the evening while the sun is still up, probably between 1640 to 1800 hours when the driveway is permeated with mist. Best tracks are of course Apocalypse and Veneificium but others are good as well. Lyrics mostly deal with despair, personal conflict, existentialism, self-discovery, and fear. Don’t expect something philosophical in the lyric sheets. You won’t find such a thing on this record.\n\nIt's weird to think that I haven't written any sort of reviews for Lacuna Coil yet- I loved them back when I was still in elementary school and middle school, having discovered them through playing \"Our Truth\" on Band Hero on my old DS before I lost the guitar grip accessory thing, though I dropped off around 2014 or 2015. It's weird because although I loved a select few of their songs, I never actually listened to much from them, and I think the only album I had listened to even half of was Broken Crown Halo back when it came out, and I remember liking it, but I didn't appreciate the sound nearly as much as I do now. I only picked them back up when Delirium was announced, which was back when I was getting into melodic death metal and other heavier music than just, well, this- Sole exceptions to that being Periphery, Mastodon, and a couple other bands, who I listened to back a year or two prior to my musical discovery. I fell in love with Delirium because it scratched every itch I had for the band. Hell, I even went to see them live with Epica and Insomnium, and it was great, even if we didn't stick around for Epica because it was during the summer in Florida with pretty much no air conditioning. Absolutely loved every second of it until we left though. That being said, I quickly dropped off again in late 2017 or early 2018. It was only when Black Anima was announced that I decided to listen to more of their discography before listening to the album. And holy fuck, their discography is an incredibly mixed bag. On one hand, I've rather enjoyed the bits of Comalies that I've listened to, as well as Broken Crown Halo and Delirium. On the other hand, you have some of the most banal wasted potential in Karmacode, and... Whatever the fuck Shallow Life is. This is going to be a bit of a different review for me, as I'm going to try to figure out just what the fuck this album is two years later. Luckily, I've already expressed my thoughts on this album elsewhere back when it came out, but the new question for me is: How has it aged? That'll be an incredibly important factor for me.\n\nAlright, rant over, I'll be discussing the album now.\n\nRight off the bat, it starts off well, but Cristina's vocals occasionally sound like they've been altered a bit. I don't think it's necessarily autotune or harmonization, but I can't quite figured out what it is. That being said, aside from these times (Which are unfortunately somewhat frequent, and are rather unnecessary), her vocals sound as good as ever. While the opening track makes it seem like they're setting up a tone or theme for the album to go ahead with, trust me when I say that the really awesome mystical witchcraft aesthetic never actually makes up anything substantial in the album. That's right, it's pretty much resigned to the cover art and the band's image, which is a shame because it really felt like they tried to integrate the theme into Delirium, even if it was just surface-level. The closest one could say they integrate it here (Aside from the opening track) is with \"Veneficium\", but that's about as surface-level as Delirium.\n\nAs the album goes on, it takes on the same approach as Periphery IV in that it tries many different styles, which can work wonders in terms of diversity and when it comes to pleasing many different audiences with different songs. There's a continuation in sound with \"Layers of Time\" and \"Sword of Anger\", metalcore with \"Now or Never\", symphonic metal with \"Veneficium\", industrial with \"The End is All I Can See\", the middle portion of their career with \"Save Me\", bits and pieces of Comalies with multiple songs, and irredeemably shitty music taste with \"Apocalypse\"! The reward is immense, but it comes with the risk of not establishing any firm identity. Ultimately, there needs to be a foundational core, and the most one gets is the vocals from both Cristina and Andrea, the chugging guitars which do nothing outside of solos, and precise drums which keep the pace well but rarely do anything to stand out, and the bass, which is arguably consistently the best part of this core. The core is here, but aside from the vocals, there is nothing exceptional, and even then, the effects on Cristina's vocals just remind me of other Lacuna Coil albums. It's damaging to their staying power, as her vocals have been the main draw for the majority of the band's fans. Sure, this doesn't really have an effect on live performances, but most fans are only going to listen to the studio albums. However, the main problem with Black Anima is the constant retreading of old styles without ever integrating what made them special, and this deals some serious damage when combined with the fact that the best songs on the album actually stand out with just how different they are- Effectively making one question what this iteration of Lacuna Coil really is. While it all works rather well on a micro level, on a macro level, it doesn't. This sounds like a recipe for something that can make one really appreciate the album when going back to it over and over, like Sounds of a Playground Fading, but the core sound that I described earlier is so barebones that it just provides diminishing returns. It ends up making for a much better listening experience when you just listen to one or two songs at a time instead of listening to the album front to back. When I first listened to the album, I was completely drained by the time I got to \"Apocalypse\", and dear God did that song only put me knee deep in the fucking grave. There was a lot of care put into this album, with so many little touches here and there akin to Letters To Myself, but I think they got far too lost in that from a songwriting perspective. There is good musicianship here if you dig deep, but it's essentially metalcore without really touching hardcore, finally delving into the overused and somewhat inaccurate mallcore label. The best I advice I could give to the band is: Find out what you really want to make, make the core sound the best you can, then move on to all those little touches to elevate the album from good to great. Either do something like Periphery IV, where the core is so good that the exploration of many different styles and sounds is a mere bonus, or make something like Desideratum, where you combine many different styles into the core sound for the entirety of the album, and focus on make a surreal auditory experience.\n\nHowever, I have to bring up one song in particular: \"Apocalypse\". I was rather generous with it when I first reviewed it elsewhere, saying that \"I wouldn't call it filler, it would've been good on Shallow Life\", but that even if that wasn't like saying that a stale piece of bread is better than maggot-ridden meat, I've still always hated the song with a burning passion, and I didn't have the balls to publicly express that at the time, only resigning that opinion for when I'm around friends- Not that we've ever discussed Black Anima more than once because, well, why would we? That being said, yes, this song is filler, and even though it somehow isn't the longest song on the album, it sure feels like it, and I was incredibly tempted to drop the album altogether while I was listening to it because I was already considering it, and this boring as shit song didn't help in the least. I'll take some of Lacuna Coil's less savory outputs, like \"I Like It\" over this- At least there's a humor about it which propels it into being so bad it's good. Lyrically, \"Apocalypse\" is just a rather basic criticism of the shitty over-zealous Christians (Not to say that all of them are, not even close, but they sure do exist and sure are vocal) that says nothing and just appeals to the newer generations. But you might be thinking that this might tie into the whole witchcraft theme, right? Nope. It's just about 'we're starting a revolution, and you're preaching your lies'. It's basic and immature even for the lowest standards that Lacuna Coil had, and at least lyrically it could've been justified if it tried saying something more or tying into the themes and tone the album had set up for it by the cover art, band image, and opening track. As for it musically, well, it's down there with the worst of Karmacode and Shallow Life. The solo is the only thing I enjoyed from it. I hope I never have to hear this shit after this review.\n\nAnd that's the thing- As negative as I've been, I do really like many songs on this album on their own. Granted, not as many as when I first listened to the album. It hasn't aged as poorly as I thought it would've, but I've gotten into much heavier and much more diverse music, and I've come to hear better in most of the styles and sounds covered from many different bands. As much as I love that Andrea's taken up growls (Especially since his singing seriously deteriorated over the band's discography), I've heard a lot better from many different bands- Hell, I've heard a lot better from this band, and it isn't to say that this album is bad! It's just that the touches of Comalies just don't add anything that made the original album special. Sure, it's a nice flourish, and I'm happy to hear it, but it's a rather mainstream-styled application of the sound. That being said, there are times when it really feels like they tried to focus on the core sound but also tried do something that isn't just their old stuff: The title track is chaotic and frenetic, and it makes for a phenomenal closer which shows them actually getting really creative. \"Black Dried Up Heart\", on the other hand, might be what you expect from their middle period without really borrowing elements from it, but the core sound is so good that it really works here. \"Layers of Time\" is energetic as hell, and while it somewhat continues the sound from Delirium, it deviates in the fact that it focuses on the energy over heaviness, unlike \"Sword of Anger\". \"Save Me\" is a really radio friendly song, and it's pretty much the most mallcore you can get from them, but it works, and it does actually sound good, even if it's mainstream as can be. The core sound isn't just chugging, and the flow of it creates a serene melody all on its own. For me, while I do quite like the solo, it's the spoken word part that shines the brightest- There's an honesty about it that sells the meaning of the song more than any other line in it, as well as anything else on the album as a whole. It isn't overly edgy for the sake of being edgy or appealing to teenagers, and there's a hope that shines through, which if anything, ends up changing the meaning of the whole song, similar to Come Clarity's first verse.\n\nThis review ended up being completely unconventional in comparison to my usual stuff because, well, that core sound is a huge letdown, and the focus of the album is more on the branches of the sound, rather than the trunk of the tree, if that makes sense. And while they draw a bit too much from their roots in terms of how the album plays out overall, I think there is something to be enjoyed here. I think a solid foundation is much more important than all the little accents and deviations, and that's why this album just hasn't stood the test of time for me over Broken Crown Halo, Delirium, Comalies, and Unleashed Memories- Hell, even Dark Adrenaline too. That's why Karmacode and Shallow Life failed not only to live up to the rest of their material, but to even be good. Black Anima's saving grace is that these little touches and variety in the styles covered give it a bit of flavor and longevity. At the same time, they don't give it an identity, and I'll always see this as one of the most musically confused albums that Lacuna Coil's ever put out. I just don't love it as much as I used to, even if that love was originally halfhearted.\n\nSongs To Recommend: \"Layers of Time\", \"Veneficium\", \"The End is All I Can See\", \"Black Anima\", \"Black Dried Up Heart\"\n\nSongs To Avoid: \"Apocalypse\", maybe \"Underneath the Surface\" (Some really good parts, some really bad parts), \"Reckless\" (I've come to kinda like it after a few listens, but it's just as radio friendly as \"Save Me\" without a good core sound or any nuance)\n\nI've not exactly been an active follower of Lacuna Coil since about the time when they kind of exploded onto the scene with the commercial success achieved by their third full-length album Comalies. They just never really klicked with me again like they did with said album's first single \"Heaven's A Lie\". Main reason for me neglecting them later is probably the band realizing around that time that they could further illuminate the more commercial, poppier aspects of their game to gain, well, even more mainstream success. The following years were stained by additional pop and trendy nu-metal elements, further suppressing the initial gloominess and romanticism of Lacuna Coil's origins, hence dropping the ball for me completely.\n\nFast-forwarding a decade and then some, I stumbled upon a video recommendation for \"Layers of Time\" on YouTube. Apparently Google already knew I could like this new shape of Lacuna Coil more than previous incarnations of the band? Well, I klicked the link and was welcomed by a growling Andrea Ferro, which was an element I did not expect. Sure, while the guitar riffing was undeniably still somewhat nu-metal inspired in its downtuned monotony, I couldn't help but realize that the slightly abrasive, almost sludgy distortion put atop of the guitars and the highly prominent ultra-\"clangy\" bass felt welcoming enough to an abandoned fan like me. After giving the whole album a few thoroughly enjoyable spins, I'm just here to laud the band for taking the risk to explore a different direction and not to repeat their worn-out formulae like so many other popular female-fronted goth pop acts since the mid-2000s.\n\nFortunately, Cristina hasn't lost the slightest bit of her versatile, charming voice throughout the years and the inclusion of a growling Andrea to accompany her singing talents...what an excellent move! Revisiting older material, Andrea's presence has always been second-tier to Cristina's - rightfully so - but apparently he started playing with a more extreme take on his vocals on this album's predecessor, Delirium and they chose to weave even more of this approach into their new material and voila - it works like a charm! Of course we are not talking about a complete 180-degree turn into a brutal record here, but there's hints of modern death metal-ish ingredients to be found within the instrumental spectrum of Black Anima's writing without ever mutilating the band's ability to create hook-laden singalong choruses with lasting value and without the usual pop-sugarcoating I'd associate this band with prior to my recent discoveries.\n\nHeavy as it is, the mostly persistent shortage of distinctive guitar riffs diminishes the album overall's impact quite a bit as they couldn't quite shake off the nu-metal tag completely. Groovy single-note riffs aplenty seep through the heavier sections of the album and their lack of diversity and memorability could be a disastrous element, if it wasn't for the spirited vocal trade-offs between Cristina and Andrea, the excellent and even kind of raw production job (perfectly audible, up-front bass guitar!) with only one flaw on display - that one being the drumsets' lack of bottom-end heaviness, which flattens the impact of an otherwise rock-solid and frankly quite powerful performance including great double bass-runs - plus generally consistent and thoroughly enjoyable songwriting patterns that lead to an experience that is so far removed from earlier disappointments, that Black Anima actually found a spot on my best-of-2019 list, despite its imperfections.\n\nImperfections? Well, apart from the aforementioned lack of variety in the guitar department, there are still a few awkward moments on this record, mind you. \"Save Me\" features the cringiest spoken-word passage this side of Dave Mustaine and is overall a rather lackluster track with a corny, overshadowing chorus and not much else to offer, \"The End Is All I Can See\" is a fuzzy (everything but the drums seems to have been put through additional distortion filters) mid-pace plodder which fails at breaking out of its permanent directionless meandering. The opening track \"Anima Nera\" has Cristina assuming a role and tone set somewhere between an evil witch (which was probably the intention) and Daisy Duck (which is...detrimental to the intended effect) and it just doesn't work as an introductory piece because the only emotion it sets is irritation, which is never a good thing when you are trying to get new listeners to spend 45 minutes on your release...\n\nBut apart from that, Anima Nera turned out to be a more-than-decent modern gothic metal album with faint extreme metal tendencies; it feels both beautiful and kind of rotten at the same time. It succeeds because it excels at keeping a foreboding atmosphere alive throughout its whole duration (if you ignore the intro that is) and even its lows are not nearly as deal-breaking as they have been before in this band's shaky history.\n\nWell done, Lacuna Coil!\n\nHighlights: Now or Never, Sword of Anger, Veneficium\n\noriginally written for http://antichristmagazine.com\n\nIn his 1848 tract Human, All Too Human, Fredrich Nietzsche wrote that \"hope, in reality, is the worst of all evils for it prolongs the torment of man.\" So many of the bands I enjoyed as a young metal fan have demonstrated time and again just how right Nietzsche was. While not the primary perpetrators of my torment, Lacuna Coil's path was one on which I could not accompany them. After starting with three albums that ranged between promising, but shaky (In a Reverie), enjoyable, but not-quite-there-yet (Unleashed Memories) and quite good (Comalies), these Italian groove-and-pop-maestros maximized their sound by doubling down on big, poppy choruses and eliminating the Paradise Lost meets Draconian vibe from the earliest material. More offensive, for me, was introducing production values stolen directly from Linkin Park. In particular, the early-2000s nü metal production smothered the material and despite sounding bad and, by 2012's Dark Adrenaline very dated, Lacuna Coil had ridden it into the ground. By the time Delirium was released in 2016, we didn't even bother to review it.\n\nYet, hope springs eternal and Black Anima is Lacuna Coil's best album. This record features the band living up to its great promise: tight, groovy, pop-metal tracks replete with stellar choruses, dynamic compositions with head-bobbing riffs, tightly wound into a 45 minute package. With songs averaging at around 4 minutes long, Black Anima offers up a dynamic set of eleven tracks, all of which feature the band playing at an absolutely high level. While it's unclear if it's is a concept album, it feels like one. Black Anima succeeds as a true album, meant to be listened to from front to back: each piece works together, showing the band assiduously crafting an album that flows perfectly, becoming more than the sum of its parts. And this is important, because Lacuna Coil's writing was never dynamic enough to hold my attention in the past. Comalies, which clocks in at an hour and is widely considered the band's crowning achievement, has great tracks but was not an album I could listen to from start-to-finish. Black Anima, however, I can't stop listening in the middle.\n\nIn addition to the band's most mature and consistent songwriting to date, Black Anima is filled with new and old ideas that work. First and foremost, Andrea Ferro has reintroduced growls into his repertoire and he sounds fantastic. Furthermore, they make him a much more dynamic vocalist; complementing his cleans, which are still used harmonized with (or by) Cristina (the chorus on \"Apocalypse,\" or \"The End Is All I Can See\"). The real strength of his growls, though, is when they play off Cristina's voice, creating the \"beauty and the beast\" contrasts that were so popular in the '90s goth and doom scene and have since disappeared (\"Veneficum\" or \"Black Anima\"). For her part, Cristina has also expanded her range and approach. The album's introduction \"Anima Nera\" establishes her working with a smaller, almost childlike voice, reminiscent of Kate Bush (and more recently in metal Diablo Swing Orchestra's phenomenal new singer Kristin Evegård). Cristina's new vocal approach shows up throughout (the stellar chorus of \"Reckless,\" for example), but even more surprising for me was was her use of more operatic stylings in the intro to \"Veneficum\" to great effect. Black Anima even features good guitar solos (\"Sword of Anger,\" \"Apocalypse,\" or \"Under the Surface\"). Not exactly known for their guitar wizardry, Lacuna Coil seems to have spent the writing process of Black Anima thinking about challenging themselves.\n\nThe core of the band's sound, of course, is still in tact. The record is filled with power chord driven choruses, where rhythm guitars and double kick match each other with chugging eighth notes (\"Save Me,\" \"Under the Surface,\" like... all the songs?). There are plenty of chuggy breakdowns where the band's bass-and-drum-heavy sound causes involuntary head nodding. These are the places where it's clear that the production has changed the presentation of their material. Tracks like \"Layers of Time\" are faster, sure, but with the old pseudo-nü-metal production, the slappiness of the bass and clickiness of the kick would have undermined the heaviness of the sound. Instead, with Andrea's roar, Cristina's inventive melodies and the tight rhythm section of Marco Coti Zelati and new drummer Richard Meiz, \"Layers of Time\" is a forceful and interesting groove track. But even with the core sound is clearly unchanged on songs like \"Apocalypse,\" \"Under the Surface\" and \"Save Me,\" they are complemented and contrasted by tracks like \"Now or Never\" and \"Reckless\" and \"Veneficum,\" that see Lacuna Coil trying something different.\n\nThere are very few bands in my time as a music reviewer or fan that have undergone such an impressive rebirth as Lacuna Coil. And Black Anima successfully does two things simultaneously; it keeps what was good and it complements that core with new ideas. Black Anima preserves what Lacuna Coil has always done well by centering around strong choruses, vocal interplay, and groove. But this core is complemented with Andrea's growls, Cristina's new, more dynamic approach, and with a production that does the band justice. While there may be adjustments around the edges that I would make (less crushed, pl0x), Black Anima is a remarkable accomplishment from a band that had simply tormented me for the last decade. And now with renewed hope, I await what comes next.\n\nOriginally published at Angry Metal Guy: angrymetalguy.com\n\nAs one of the early Gothic metal bands to emerge out of the early aftermath of the mid-90s death/doom craze, Lacuna Coil has naturally been far from strangers to change. Originally being part of said scene briefly under the moniker Ethereal and sticking fairly close to the stylistic conventions pioneered by Theater Of Tragedy, they would tread a path somewhat comparable to Dutch fellow travelers Within Temptation in moving towards a more rock-based, mainline sound that was arguably the forerunner to the commercial phenomenon that was Evanescence. Following their widely hailed and popular 2002 LP Comalies, this outfit began shifting with the popular winds and ultimately ended up abandoning the metallic fervor that made their earlier offerings staples of the late 90s Gothic metal craze that saw the ascendency of acts such as Tristania and Beseech, alienating a contingent of their older audience while, nevertheless, expanding their commercial viability up until the present.\n\nComing in after a slight return to the metal world in 2014’s Broken Crown Halo and the somewhat more rocking 2016 outing Delirium, this veteran Italian outfit has decided to flip the proverbial script with arguably one of the most intense examples of melancholy rage heard since the earliest incarnations of the Gothic style. In a sense, the wailing beast of an album that is Black Anima defies a number of existing conventions, infusing a strong degree of modern groove metal elements into the aesthetic and giving things a more animated and percussive feel. For his first outing as the principle guitarist of the fold, Diego Cavallotti (who provided a guest slot on Delirium) brings a decidedly dense and dark tone to things, reminiscent mostly of Jeff Loomis but even showcasing some Meshuggah affinity in his riff work. Likewise, the character of Andrea Ferro has veered back to its guttural, death bark roots something fierce, which plays quite well with the mechanistic, heavily rhythmic template provided by the guitars.\n\nNevertheless, this is ultimately a Gothic metal affair, and is thus painted by a sufficient degree of aesthetic beauty and smoothness to balance the bestial rage factor with a sense of mystique. Much of this is accomplished through Cristina Scabbia’s powerful yet angelic vocal work, which has lost none of its luster over the past couple decades, though one would be remiss to deny the impact of the band’s overall sonic template and the prominent use of keyboards to further cushion the jagged thorns of this sonic bouquet of black roses. Particularly on the more haunting and droning flow of “The End Is All I Can See” and “Apocalypse”, a more techno-like and less abrasive picture emerges that plays well to Scabbia’s voice, and Ferro’s beastly foil to her beauty persona takes on a more moderated and occasionally melodic tone. Interestingly enough, Cavallotti’s guitar work proves extremely adaptive in this capacity, as he is able to both emulate the more restrained tone of the Comalies sound while also throwing in a few extravagant lead guitar slots that are a tad atypical for this format.\n\nThose exceptional cases being noted, this is an album that is possessed of a uniquely modern and highly original character, one that stretches the definition of where Gothic metal ends and certain newer sectarian sub-genres such as groove metal and even djent begin. Sometimes this manifests in a subtle fashion, like a mostly driving Gothic anthem with a few chugging riff elements and a more forceful harsh vocal element like “Save Me” and the title song “Black Anima”. However, a quick sampling of rhythmic pile-drivers such as “Reckless” and “Layers Of Time” reveal an album that flirts heavily with territory that is often reserved to the likes of Ghost Ship Octavius, whereas overt chug machines such as “Now Or Never” and “Under The Surface” see the riff work and Ferro’s vocals occasionally veering dangerously close to deathcore territory. Credit should likewise be given to newly recruited drummer Richard Meiz in shaping these songs into a horse of a more metallic color, as his precision drum work is intense enough to pass for a number of prominent figures in the more extreme fringes of modern death metal.\n\nNaturally the nagging question on the minds of every older Gothic metal fan who is nostalgic for the days when Theater Of Tragedy were defining the style with Liv Kristine at the helm and The Sins Of Thy Beloved were still putting out albums is does this album compare to Comalies, let alone the stuff from before. The short answer is no, but with the added caveat that it is very close to the same level of quality in its own right, despite being stylistically a far cry from the sound of 20 years prior. This is the sort of album that is sure to break down boundaries and may well prove to help expand the very definition of the Gothic metal, in much the same way that Ukraine’s Ignea has helped to expand the symphonic metal paradigm via their 2017 debut The Sign Of Faith. It doesn’t really possess the sort of vintage, organic atmosphere that nostalgia hounds may seek, but it does provide a much needed shot in the arm to a band that has been a bit too mellow of late, and those who want a bit more metallic edge in their Gothic metal are highly encouraged to immerse themselves in the experience that is Black Anima at least once or twice.\n\nOriginally written for Sonic Perspectives (www.sonicperspectives.com)\n\nAh, Shit! Here we go again...\n\nAll of the die-hard Lacuna Coil Fans (like myself) and gothic metal fans want from LC is for them to hang out and be themselves musically and visually. Instead, Lacuna Coil decided to dawn face paint and questionable music choices. As time goes by I have started to drift away from Lacuna Coil. It was because of the mixed feelings I had for the band's previous album \"Delirium\" where I had to argue still had a few flickers of gothic metal left in them while still being heavy. With \"Black Anima\" however, it's safe to say that this is not gothic metal and the band has fallen deeper into their alternative metal sound. Yes, they've already gone down this route before with \"Karamacode,\" \"Dark Adrenaline,\" and the ever-so-popular \"Shallow Life\" that I \"love.\" I guess it wasn't until now that I realized that Lacuna Coil has started to die in me. They may have \"Broken Crown Halo\" that brought back they're gothic metal sound, but that didn't last long.\n\nBack to \"Black Anima\" this album was nothing more than a flatline album for me. There was no Song on this album that got me hooked onto this album and that managed to be much worse. I couldn't even tell whether this album was really worse than \"Swallow Life,\" but it managed to do just that. At least with \"Shallow Life\" there are some songs on the album i really like it made me want to go back to the album. Unfortunately, \"Black Anima\" was full of questionable musical directions that it just made me question my status as a Lacuna Coil fan and not want to go back to this album. It actually makes \"Shallow Life\" sound much better in comparison. I'm not just saying that to be funny, I mean it really does.\n\n\"Black Anima\" not only axed all traces of gothic metal music heard in the last two albums, but the music is heavier. A heavier direction is not even a problem, so long as it's done right and the band stays true to their past and the fans. I started to realize that the guitars music patterns are simple and generic. Even in \"Delirium\" it had some unique guitar parts where they do basic guitar patterns and had some appealing key changes. Sure it was more metalcore sounding, but at least had some catchiness to the music. Here, the heaviness has no catchiness and to make it even worse, the album is plagued with electronic sounds just to sound atmospheric. It's not atmospheric, it just sounds like a mainstream metal band trying to be an industrial/electronica band. Almost every Song starts with odd electronic sounds or electronic music and that is a turn-off. I mean yes, the keyboards in gothic metal are an electronic instrument, but here it doesn't sound like any typical keyboard sound. The solos don't even help with trying to leave any redeeming quality for me. The music for this album is not appealing that I just found it boring, and just another generic sounding album.\n\nThe vocals surprisingly enough has gone bad as well. Cristina Scabbia sounds like her vocals are deteriorating. Not even moments of power and high notes, it's full of questionable singing such as in \"Reckless,\" where she sounds like she's wailing her vocals and in \"Now Or Never\" where she has this kind of whining shout that didn't appeal to me either. The only time where I heard Cristina show any sign of singing high was in \"Veneficium\" and that is not saying much. The majority of the album is dominated by Andrea Ferro's growling. As I said in my review for \"Delirium,\" I felt this change was almost like a good cop/bad cop approach and they abandon the sound that made them unique during the early-2000s that was full of beauty and the beast bands. If \"Delirium\" had some singing from Ferro, he would no longer do so in \"Black Anima.\" To answer the question, the growling was not good either. This was, of course, a disappointing album for Scabbia and Ferro vocally. They sound like they are having an identity crisis, more particularly from Andrea Ferro.\n\n*Sign* Then there's the lyrics. This was always Lacuna Coil's weakest skill in their albums. Even in \"Broken Crown Halo\" it's not the best. The only difference was \"Broken Crown Halo\" was actually good. \"Black Anima\" I think that Lacuna Coil didn't even need to try with their theme of \"I'm feeling hurt, but nothing will stand in our way.\" The lyrics are what you expect from what I've mentioned from my previous Lacuna Coil reviews, it's just too simple, and generic. Yes, \"Shallow Life\" has its share of puns in their lyrics, but here I start to discover the band's incoherence with their lyrics. The lyrics are the same as the last album, but worse. There's even a line in the Song \"Apocalypse\" that reads \"I don't care.\" So why should we even care and bother anymore when LC is not going to improve in their lyricism? No reason...\n\n\"Black Anima\" was surprisingly the biggest letdown I've heard all year. This is the sound of a band having an identity crisis and trying to constantly hit the bull's-eye. They were close with \"Broken Crown Halo,\" were far-off with \"Delirium,\" then hit the damn wall with this album. This album will most likely kill any anticipation in me to ever enjoy any new music from Lacuna Coil ever again. Coming from me it means a lot. Sure \"Delirium\" was no longer gothic metal and I still enjoyed it, \"Black Anima\" crushed me and it hurts. I appreciate that they want to make heavier music now, but their execution fell flat on their face. No gothic metal, no effort... Just one big mess of an album. How I would some up this album is the same way I ended my \"Shallow Life\" review. A pun line consisting of this album's song titles.\n\nSave me from the sword of anger and the layers of time. Under the surface, the end is all I can see through the flames of a reckless Apocalypse."
