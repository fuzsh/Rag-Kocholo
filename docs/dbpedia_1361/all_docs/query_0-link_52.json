        "text": "Italian metal masters Lacuna Coil have unveiled a new single titled “Hosting the Shadow” featuring guest vocals from Lamb of God frontman Randy Blythe.\n\nThe song marks another new stand-alone single from Lacuna Coil, who earlier this year unveiled the track “In the Mean Time” featuring New Years Day singer Ash Costello.\n\nGet Lamb of God Tickets Here\n\nWhile Lacuna Coil are already known for their dual vocal attack from Cristina Scabbia and Andrea Ferro, Blythe takes the band’s sound to a new extreme. After an extended instrumental intro, the Lamb of God singer’s voice is heard first on the song, as he delivers his signature growl in the verses, where he is eventually joined by Ferro. Scabbia’s clean singing then arrives in the melodic chorus.\n\nRelated Video\n\n“‘Hosting the Shadow’ is a trip through light and dark, where silence reveals its hidden secrets,” stated Lacuna Coil. “Obscure moments can become occasions to evolve, to learn to master one’s own shadow — which is crucial in order to prevail. Randy Blythe did an incredible job on this track, we absolutely adore his voice and his evil laugh!”\n\nThe band continued, “Our admiration for him is infinite and to have him as a guest on this song is a dream come true. Partnering with a friend you respect immensely, that also kicks ass on stages around the world: it doesn’t get any better than this. We’re looking forward to the day we can perform ‘Hosting the Shadow’ live together!”\n\nBlythe added, “I was super excited when Lacuna Coil asked me to sing on a song with them — not only am I a big fan of their music, they are truly beautiful souls who have been like family to me for 20 years now. We’ve played shows together all over the world, and I’ve always wanted to jump onstage and sing with them — I can’t wait until it actually happens with ‘Hosting the Shadow’!”\n\nLacuna Coil will embark on a UK/European tour in October, with tickets available here. Lamb of God, meanwhile, are in the midst of the co-headlining “Ashes of Leviathan” North American tour with Mastodon (pick up tickets here).\n\nListen to “Hosting the Shadow” in the player below."
