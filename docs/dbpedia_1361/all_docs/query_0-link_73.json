        "text": "Following the successful release of “Never Dawn” (over 2 million streams), the goth metal legends LACUNA COIL are back with their new single: “In The Mean Time” featuring Ash Costello of NEW YEARS DAY\n\nThe song’s title is a reference to the mean times the world is living in, as well as a reference to the state the band itself is in, between cycles.\n\nLACUNA COIL says: “’In The Mean Time’ is a reflection on how much our society has generally ‘lost the plot’. We are living in really mean times filled with unhappy people: lonely, anxious, depressed, destructive. The pressure that crushes from the outside doesn’t allow to see things with the right clarity. This song is like group therapy: not a lamentation, but acceptance that once broken, it’s hard to put oneself back together again.\n\n“We need to take our minds off all the inescapable toxicity and find that there’s so much more to this life… and know that in the meantime, everything cannot be aligned. We invited Ash Costello from New Years Day to feature on the track and we’re thrilled she came on board adding exactly what we needed for this song with her warm voice and charisma.”\n\nAsh Costello from NEW YEARS DAY further adds: “I am deeply honored to join LACUNA COIL on tour for the first time, to have the incredible opportunity to lend my guest vocals to a new track and appear in the music video. Working alongside the powerhouse vocalist Cristina has been a privilege, and I may be biased in saying that ‘In The Mean Time’ has quickly become my favorite by LACUNA COIL. Its message about embracing individuality and not conforming deeply resonates with me.”\n\nWhile the song is already out on all digital platforms, you can watch the accompanying music video that was directed by Patric Ullaeus for rEvolver Film Company AB at 6pm CET / 12 (noon) EST / 9am PST below.\n\nThe song and video are released shortly before LACUNA COIL heads out on a headline US tour with special guests NEW YEARS DAY and additional support coming from OCEANS OF SLUMBER. The band will be hitting big festival stages at ROCKVILLE, SONIC TEMPLE and MILWAUKEE Metal Festival.\n\nLACUNA COIL 2024 U.S. tour dates:\n\nMay 2nd Wilmington, DE – The Queen\n\nMay 3rd Asbury Park, NJ – Stone Pony\n\nMay 4th Reading, PA – Reverb\n\nMay 6th Norfolk, VA – The NorVa\n\nMay 7th Charlotte, NC – The Underground\n\nMay 9th Daytona Beach, FL – Welcome To Rockville (festival date)\n\nMay 11th Nashville, TN – Brooklyn Bown\n\nMay 13th Ft. Smith, AR – Temple Live\n\nMay 14th Wichita, KS – Temple Live\n\nMay 15th St. Louis, MO – Delmar Hall\n\nMay 18th Columbus, OH – Sonic Temple (festival date)\n\nMay 19th Milwaukee, WI – Milwaukee Metal Fest (festival date)\n\nIn October, LACUNA COIL are heading out to the UK & Ireland with special guests BLIND CHANNEL:\n\nOctober 15th Belfast – Limelight\n\nOctober 16th Dublin – Academy\n\nOctober 18th Bournemouth – O2 Academy\n\nOctober 20th Manchester – Academy\n\nOctober 21st Glasgow – SWG3\n\nOctober 22nd Wolverhampton – KK’S Steelmill\n\nOctober 24th Nottingham – Rock City\n\nOctober 25th London – Roundhouse\n\nOctober 26th Bristol – O2 Academy\n\nHailing from Milan, Italy, LACUNA COIL emerged in the late 1990s as a gothic metal force. Pioneers in the genre’s melodic side, they blended Cristina Scabbia‘s soaring vocals with Andrea Ferro‘s growls, creating a signature soundscape. Their 1999 debut, “In a Reverie,” established their dark and atmospheric style, while later albums like “Comalies” (2002) and “Karmacode” (2004) incorporated more rock and groove influences, broadening their appeal."
