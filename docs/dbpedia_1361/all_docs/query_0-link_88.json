        "text": "Photo: CUNENE\n\nLacuna Coil have shared a new version of their song Swamped.\n\nSwamped XX will feature on 'Comalies XX', a \"deconstructed\" reworking of their 2002 LP, 'Comalies'. The record is scheduled for release on October 14 via Century Media Records, and will form part of the celebrations of the album's 20th anniversary.\n\nWhile retaining its original elements, the track features co-vocalist Andrea Ferro contributing some deep growling vocals that contrast with lead vocalist Cristina Scabbia's haunting, melodic voice. Head below to view the Trilathera-directed video.\n\nBack in July, the Italian metallers dropped Tight Rope XX from the rebooted album. Check that out here.\n\nLacuna Coil will resume their North American tour tonight (September 16) in New York.\n\nLacuna Coil Upcoming Tour Dates are as follows\n\nFri September 16 2022 - POUGHKEEPSIE New York - Chance Theater (USA)\n\nSat September 17 2022 - NEW YORK New York - Gramercy Theatre (USA)\n\nSun September 18 2022 - NEW YORK New York - Gramercy Theatre (USA)\n\nTue September 20 2022 - WARRENDALE Pennsylvania - Jergel's Rhythm Grille (USA)\n\nWed September 21 2022 - COLUMBUS Ohio - King of Clubs - Columbus (USA)\n\nThu September 22 2022 - PONTIAC Michigan - Crofoot Ballroom (USA)\n\nFri September 23 2022 - JOLIET - Forge Joliet (USA)\n\nCompare & Buy Lacuna Coil Tickets at Stereoboard.com.\n\nNOTE FROM THE EDITOR\n\nWe don't run any advertising!
