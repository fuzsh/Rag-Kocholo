        "text": "Certainly, Lacuna Coil has never accustomed us to a different thing : a symphonic and thoroughbred metal, which allies raw voice (” The army inside “) and clear, laudatory and epic tunes with power melodic rhythmic, without ever overturning in syrupy caricature of radio edit.\n\nAnd nevertheless, this last one is diverted well from the atmospheric and dark metal genre which they contributed to create soon twenty years ago, since their native Italy, and that, beside Tiamat, Type O Negative and Paradise Lost, without forgetting Within Temptation when these last ones were there still in Enter with very death influence, far from having overturned into the aforesaid radio interest.\n\nSo ” Trip the darkness ” is only the energetic opening of an album of metal speed and hyper melodic, in the cutting riffs (“Intoxicated”), catchy tunes (” Kill the light “) and aerials (” My spirit “), and effective solos (” Against you “). The album Dark Adrenaline even kept stenchesounds of its first dark Gothic on the verge of the Indus origins (“Upsidedown”, ” I don’t believe in tomorrow “), whose the most beautiful effect is this the well-titled “Fire”, in setback and saturated guitars, as to carry better the vocal energy of Cristina Scabbia."
