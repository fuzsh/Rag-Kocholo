        "text": "The past several months haven’t been easy for anyone, especially for those who make their living by standing on stages and touring the world. Italian gothic metal masters Lacuna Coil decided to deal with the tough situation by stepping on stage of Milan’s famous Alcatraz Club and play for an empty audience last September. Well, not quietly. Passionate Coilers from all over the world tuned in to watch the exclusive performance titled brilliantly, “Black Anima: Live From The Apocalypse”.\n\nFor this special occasion, the band decided to perform their latest album “Black Anima” in its entirety, including album bonus tracks. Following fan’s requests, this unique set is out now for everyone to re-live digitally or physically on CD and vinyl with a bonus DVD featuring the original live stream footage.\n\nJust like the studio album itself, the live album kicks off with the dramatic intro “Anima Nera” that makes your blood run cold, and jumping straight into the banger “Sword Of Anger”. It takes only a couple first seconds to realise the band is about to give their all. And they do.\n\nVocalist Cristina Scabbia welcomes people with the first notes of single “Save Me” and continues with a deeply felt performance throughout the song, including the emotional spoken part. Andrea Ferro’s demonic growls open the apocalyptic “Now Or Never”, the tempo increases and culminates with Cristina’s passionate chorus. This is the perfect occasion to remind yourself how to headbang properly and train those neck muscles for when real shows get back! “Reckless” delivers a catchy, playful chorus. With this song, the band throws down a challenge to get wild and reckless. And they don’t need to tell twice! This song was just made to be played live!\n\nSoon, it’s time slow down a bit with “Through The Flames”. Andrea shines in verses, meanwhile Cristina in choruses. But the tempo is going up again with “Apocalypse”, featuring an amazing solo by Diego Cavalotti. “Black Feathers” darkens the already gloomy atmosphere even more and runs into up-tempo piece “Under The Surface”.\n\nDisturbing keyboard sounds open up “The End Is All I Can See” and it’s time for Cristina and Andrea to reverse their roles – Andrea takes over the chorus and shows more of his characteristic singing voice. Latin choirs in “Veneficium” bring in one of the “highlights” or the “shivers” moments of the record, one of fans’ favourites, indeed. And even though you can’t speak Latin, you just need to chant the lyrics along with Cristina.\n\nFollowing next, the time has come for the album’s bonus tracks – “Black Dried Up Heart” and special Halloween piece “Bad Things”, which was previously available as an Amazon exclusive track only. After this new song for some, the band goes on with the hit single “Layers Of Time”, which sounds excellent live. Cristina showcases some of her gentler vocals, as well as flies into soaring heights, Diego on guitars, Marco on bass and Richard on drums delivering their all.\n\nWith the following title track of the album, the band finishes the show. At least it might look so. They return for a truly touching piano rendition of “Save Me”, which we’ve heard in its heavy version already at the beginning. If you doubted Cristina’s performance, this piece must change your mind. This is the most unfiltered, rawest version of Lacuna Coil you’ll get to hear. A breathtaking moment to end this excellent show with!\n\nHighly engaging and perfectly mixed, “Live From The Apocalypse” is truly a special gift from Lacuna Coil. After all, it doesn’t happen often that bands get to play one of their albums in full, keeping the show entertaining and attractive for listener’s ears throughout the whole set, with no hesitation. This is a “must listen” for all Coilers and beyond!\n\nRelease date: June 25, 2021\n\nLabel: Century Media Records"
