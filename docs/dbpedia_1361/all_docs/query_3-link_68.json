        "text": "Senzafine (Without End) is the title of one of my favourite songs by the Milanese Gothic Metal band Lacuna Coil. Lacuna Coil are one of the few Italian metal bands that have achieved international fame, and part of the reason for this is probably that they made the decision to write and sing almost exclusively in English. I’ve been a big Lacuna Coil fan for a number of years. I find their powerful melodic music especially captivating, but for me it is the tantalising voice of Cristina Scabbia, widely acknowledged as one of today’s greatest female metal vocalists, coupled with Andrea Ferro’s raw vocal power, that make LC stand out from the crowd. This counterpoint of Cristina and Andreas’ contrasting but complementary vocal styles is well illustrated in the song Senzafine, which as far as I’m aware is their only song performed entirely in Italian.\n\nIn a moment we’ll have a listen to Senzafine, but first I’m going to let Cristina and Andrea introduce themselves to you, and tell you a bit about their passion for music. Click on the following photo to watch an interview in English:\n\n… and here’s one in Italian:\n\nNow listen to the music by clicking on the song title below. WARNING, the lyrics are very abstract and therefore difficult to translate.\n\nSenzafine\n\nScorre lento il mio tempo\n\nChe scivola sul velo della mia pelle nuda\n\nSe oltrepassassi il confine che mi hai dato\n\nForse io non sarei qui\n\nDa adesso ormai che senso ha\n\nCercare di abbracciare un passato più puro\n\nGuardando avanti rischierò\n\nMa riesco a rispondere ai miei perché\n\nTutto ciò che sarai\n\nEra già stato scritto\n\nSe davvero esiste\n\nQuesto dio ha fallito\n\nOgni parola pronunciata\n\nSarà lo specchio del tuo dolore\n\nRiflette la colpa\n\nAlimenta l’odio\n\nMadre\n\nIl mio destino scelgo\n\nSe riesco a resistere\n\nSono ancora in piedi in questo istante di pura follia\n\nnon so più se desiderare il bene o il male\n\nanche se il peccato forse più mi dà\n\nDa adesso ormai che senso ha\n\nOpporre resistenza a un destino segnato\n\nNon resterò a guardare senza\n\nRiuscire a resisterti\n\nRisvegliami\n\nMadre\n\nIl mio destino scelgo\n\nSe riesco a resistere\n\nRisvegliami\n\nNon c’è scelta senza me\n\nNon c’è vita senza me\n\nMy translation\n\nWithout End\n\nMy time passes slowly\n\nit slips like a veil over my naked skin\n\nif I went beyond the limits that you gave me\n\nmaybe I wouldn’t be here\n\nAt this point what sense does it make\n\nto try and embrace a purer past?\n\nlooking ahead is a risk\n\nbut I’ll be able to answer my questions\n\nEverything that you will be\n\nwas already written\n\nif he really exists\n\nthis God has failed\n\nEvery word pronounced\n\nwill be the mirror of your pain\n\nreflect the blame\n\nfeed the hate\n\nMother\n\nI choose my destiny\n\nIf I can manage to resist\n\nI’m still on my feet in this moment of pure madness\n\nI don’t know any more whether to wish for the good or the bad\n\neven if sin may give me more\n\nAt this point what sense does it make\n\nto resist a written destiny\n\nI won’t stand by watching\n\nwithout being able to resist you\n\nwake me up\n\nMother\n\nI choose my destiny\n\nIf I can manage to resist\n\nwake me up\n\nThere’s no choice without me\n\nthere’s no life without me"
