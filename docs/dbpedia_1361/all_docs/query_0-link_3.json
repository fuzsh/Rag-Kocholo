        "text": "You may have enjoyed smooth operatic vocals and jazz renditions of famous songs by female vocalists. You may have danced and sung tunes of pop artists. But what about a powerful energy-laden metal track? Have you tried emulating a metal vocalist? Chances are you may have failed miserably in this pursuit and choked in many attempts (as I did!). Imagine the effort that goes into emoting the angst and rage of a metal song. In a male-dominated industry, it takes a different mettle to become a female metal vocalist. Metal songs demand a diverse and commanding vocal tenor that ranges from guttural growls to operatic highs and symphonic lows to typically convey themes of rebellion and resilience through high-octane lyrics and define the fierce and unapologetic energy of classic, death, symphonic, or progressive metal.\n\nHistory of metal singers\n\nSince the pioneering work of Black Sabbath in late 1960s, metal has evolved into a broad genre with a number of subgenres, including progressive metal, death metal, and classic heavy metal, each with distinct themes and techniques. Metal is a popular genre that has had a long-lasting influence on the music industry.\n\nIn the 80s, female metal singers such as Doro Pesch and Lita Ford first found recognition. Subsequently, gothic metal vocalists encouraged several female singers in the 90s. The 2000s saw the emergence of symphonic metal icons such as Tarja Trunen and Sharon den Adel.
