Black Dried Up Heart (Bonus Track)\n\n24-bit / 44K HD audio master, with three bonus tracks!\r\n\r\nHot off chart-smashing full-length Delirium and ground-breaking, widely-applauded The 119 Show, Italy-based gothfathers Lacuna Coil return with stunning new full-length Black Anima. Both a paradigm shift and a respectful look back to the early days, Black Anima spreads its wings and flies high above the rest of the pack. Lacuna Coil’s ninth full-length is epic, atmospheric, groovy, heavy yet forward-thinking. Vocalist Cristina Scabbia is transcendent throughout. Her vocal partner Andrea Ferro has viciously transformed into a beast, while the rest of Lacuna Coil—including new drummer Richard Meiz—give the performance of their lifetimes. Just as Comalies, Shallow Life, and Delirium were pivotal moments for the Italians and their global network of fans, Black Anima takes Lacuna Coil’s greatness to the next-level! Certainly, fans will recognize Black Anima as Lacuna Coil but there’s so much to discover in songs like “Layers of Time,” “Under the Surface,” “Veneficium,” and “The End is All I Can See.” Expertly produced at BRX Studio in Milan, Italy by band producer/bassist Marco Coti-Zelati, engineered by Michele Adani and Marco Barusso, and mastered by MarcoD’Agostino for 96KHZ.IT Mastering, Black Anima sounds massive yet is dynamic enough to capture’s all of Lacuna Coil’s beautifully dark subtleties. Says Ferro: “Like Delirium, we wanted to be freer. If the music called for a heavier arrangement—like double bass drums, deeper growls, or having Cristina go epic—then we went for it. We didn’t really think about songs that would be for the radio or songs that would be singles. We had to stir things up a little bit.” Black Anima is the next chapter in Lacuna Coil’s incredibly story. Join them!",
