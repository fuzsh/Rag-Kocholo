        "text": "QUEENSRŸCHE guitarist Michael Wilton told Metal Edge magazine about “Digital Noise Alliance”: “It’s an album that kind of stretches and encompasses the whole music genre of QUEENSRŸCHE. It’s got some very melodic moments, it’s progressive, it’s heavy metal and it’s very album-oriented visual music that is going to be just a good all-around QUEENSRŸCHE album.”\n\n“Digital Noise Alliance” was once again helmed by Chris “Zeuss” Harris, who previously worked with QUEENSRŸCHE on 2015’s “Condition Hüman” and “The Verdict” LPs.\n\nThis past March, QUEENSRŸCHE singer Todd La Torre told FOX17 Rock & Review about the band’s upcoming LP: “Each song might have a little different attitude and we wanted to just use real amps and all the vintage, real stuff that was used throughout the history of QUEENSRŸCHE.\n\n“We did all the drums at a place in Clearwater (Florida) — a huge home with the most amazing ceiling for a drum room,” La Torre continued. “So we did all the drums there. And then, really, at my place in St. Petersburg, Florida, we’re able to track all the guitars, bass and vocals.\n\n“Those days of renting thousand-dollar-a-day studios, we don’t really need that anymore. And our producer Zeuss, who did the last two QUEENSRŸCHE albums — he does all Rob Zombie’s stuff; he’s a very seasoned producer, and he does mixing and mastering, so he’s a one-stop shop — he’s down here from Massachusetts. So he’s handling all those duties. And things are going really well. We’re having a great time.”\n\nLast November, La Torre told Canada’s The Metal Voice about the musical direction of the new QUEENSRŸCHE material: “It doesn’t sound like ‘The Verdict’. It’s its own new kind of thing. We really kind of just focused more on melodic hooks. I don’t think we went in thinking, like, ‘Oh, we need to sound old school or new or this.'”\n\nHe continued: “You know what we did on this record… Every other time, each guy would kind of submit their own song ideas and then we would kind of work on that. But what we did on this record was, other than Eddie (Jackson, bass) — Eddie has a couple of songs that are really cool that he wrote and then showed us kind of when they were pretty much done. And then Michael kind of wrote some interesting chords — still staying within the keys and everything. But we all got in a room with our here in Florida, and we literally started from scratch. Like, ‘Michael, what do you got?’ And he would come up with a riff. And Casey (Grillo) would sit on the drums, or I would sit on the drums. We were all actually in a room and just tried it like the good old days. So this record was totally like that — the whole thing pretty much, minus one or two songs. And even that changed a little bit.”\n\nIn early 2021, Wilton told The Metal Voice about the sound of the new QUEENSRŸCHE music: “Our producer, Zeuss, if this is any indication, he says it sounds like QUEENSRŸCHE … I think we’re just going with our gut right now. You don’t wanna take too many drastic chances in this day and age. So I think it’s more of a continuation of ‘The Verdict’, maybe, in some sense. We’re riding that wave. It’s been good to us. (Laughs)”\n\nIn October, Wilton confirmed that returning guitarist Mike Stone would contribute guitar solos to the band’s next studio album.\n\nSince late May 2021, Stone has been handling second-guitar duties in QUEENSRŸCHE, which announced in July that longtime guitarist Parker Lundgren was exiting the group to focus on “other business ventures.”\n\nStone originally joined QUEENSRŸCHE for the 2003 album “Tribe” and stayed with the band for six years before leaving the group.\n\nFor the past five years, Grillo has been filling in for QUEENSRŸCHE’s original drummer Scott Rockenfield, who stepped away from the band’s touring activities in early 2017 to spend time with his young son.\n\nIn early October, Rockenfield filed a lawsuit against the band’s fellow original members Wilton and Jackson, alleging, among other things, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and wrongful discharge.\n\nEarlier this year, QUEENSRŸCHE pulled out of SCORPIONS’ rescheduled “Sin City Nights” Las Vegas residency in order to support JUDAS PRIEST on the “50 Heavy Metal Years” North American tour dates. The trek kicked off on March 4 in Peoria, Illinois and concluded on April 13 in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."
