        "text": "VOICE OVER: Rebecca Brayton\n\nOriginally formed in 1994, Lacuna Coil is a gothic metal band out of Milan, Italy. The group has undergone lineup and name changes, but today they have finally solidified their sound.

In this video, http://www.WatchMojo.com chats with Cristina Scabbia and Andrea Ferro from the band to learn about the group's origins and influences, and how they see the evolution of the band's music.
