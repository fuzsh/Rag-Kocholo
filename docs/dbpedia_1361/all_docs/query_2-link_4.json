        "text": "Vocal style in music\n\nSee also: Screaming (music)\n\nFor the sound sometimes made by the dying, see Death rattle.\n\nThe death growl is an extended vocal technique usually employed in death metal and other extreme subgenres of heavy metal music.[1] It is characterized by guttural, harsh sounds that correspond to the intensity of the genre. The vocal style may have originated from ancient warrior chants, and was refined through blues, rock, and heavy metal. Death growl vocals are sometimes criticized for their \"ugliness\" and inability to understand without a lyric sheet, however this contributes to death metal's abrasive style and often dark and obscene subject matter.[2]\n\nDefinition\n\n[edit]\n\nDeath metal, in particular, is associated with growled vocals; it tends to be lyrically and thematically darker and more morbid than other forms of metal, and features vocals which attempt to evoke chaos, death, and misery by being \"usually very deep, guttural, and unintelligible\".[3] Natalie Purcell notes, \"Although the vast majority of death metal bands use very low, beast-like, almost indiscernible growls as vocals, many also have high and screechy or operatic vocals, or simply deep and forcefully-sung vocals.\"[4] Sociologist Deena Weinstein has noted of death metal: \"Vocalists in this style have a distinctive sound, growling and snarling rather than singing the words, and making ample use of the voice distortion box.\"[5]\n\nTerminology and technique\n\n[edit]\n\nDeath growls and their variants are also known as death metal vocals, brutal vocals, guttural vocals, death grunts, growled vocals, low pitched vocals, low growls, unclean vocals, harsh vocals, vocal fry, glottal fry, false cord vocals and death cord vocals. Despite the misconceptions and stereotypes that are associated with them, usually by non-extreme metal fans, death growls require traditional clean/melodic vocal techniques to be done properly.[6]\n\n...You have to change your way of thinking about death metal vocals. Many metal singers think that it’s all about yelling or screaming. That’s actually not the case unless you want permanent damage to your voice. Rather… singing death metal is an organic vocal effect that you learn to master. And it’s actually the opposite of what many think.[7]\n\nIn June 2007, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre in the Netherlands reported that, because of the increased popularity of growling in the region, several patients who had used improper growling techniques were being treated for edema and polyps on the vocal folds.[8]\n\nIn 2005, professional vocal coach Melissa Cross released the instructional DVD The Zen of Screaming, to teach students the proper way to sing in several styles of rock, metal and hardcore. It has since been re-released as a digital download.[9]\n\nThe low, raspy, aggressive pitch of Lemmy Kilmister of Motörhead, Conrad \"Cronos\" Lant of Venom and Tom Warrior of Celtic Frost were not unlike the death growl and may be thought of as precursors to the current style.[10]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nScreaming (in music)\n\nScreaming (in general)\n\nStrident vowel\n\nHarsh voice\n\nCreaky voice\n\nIngressive sound\n\nPharyngealization\n\nVoiced epiglottal trill\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
