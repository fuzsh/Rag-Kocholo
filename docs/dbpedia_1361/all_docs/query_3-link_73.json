        "text": "Happy Monday everyone! I hope you had a good weekend. I wanted to share a current song that I’m obsessed with and had on repeat on a lot!\n\nI have been a fan of this Italian metal band since 2006 when I heard their single “Our Truth.” My brother had found the music video for “Our Truth” and told me about it. I’ve always been fascinated with how they evolve their style and try different things. From their dark album “Delirium” that address mental illness and human darkness, to their satire song “I Like It” and even this power ballad “End of Time.”\n\nLately, I’ve been in a writing slump for my novel and this song popped up in my recommended YouTube feed. I had heard it years ago but forgot about it. But once I listened to it again last week, I got hooked and I’ve started feeling inspired again. I love how Cristina Scabbia’s voice takes more of a powerful alto sound and blends so well with male vocalist Andrea Ferro. While the band has always that their lyrics are up to the fan’s interpretation, this music video seems to show two people who are trying to rekindle what’s left of their relationship before the end. While I’m not sure why there’s so many different costumes in this video, the lyrics really stuck with me. If you’re a metal fan or wanting to try new music, check out this band!"
