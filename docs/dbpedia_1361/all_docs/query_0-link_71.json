        "text": "Sydney’s 51st Avenue are back and sounding heavier than ever, with their huge new track ‘Moments’ – a track that delves into new territory thematically and sonically, and is the first to feature new bandmate Anthony Carollo on bass duties. Starting things off with a moody synth and drum machine section, vocalist Alynnis Zizza’s vocals build tension perfectly in the verse before the track erupts in the first chorus; with huge modern-metalcore riffage pushing the song to the next level. During the writing process for ‘Moments’, Zizza took more of a lighthearted approach and decided to have fun with the track lyrically – describing a one night stand, a topic that strays from the bands often more introspective lyricism. “I’ve been waiting for a track that makes me feel like dancing so when I heard the instrumental of ‘Moments’, I couldn’t help but move. It’s really different to our other tracks so I figured why not lean into that and write about something we haven’t before. It’s also not a very long track at all so naming it ‘Moments’ and writing about a one night stand felt very appropriate and heaps of fun! I’ve also been in my mum era so a step out of that was refreshing,” says Alynnis Zizza.\n\nFinnish melodic metal band Unén proudly unveil their first official single and video, ‘My Love’s Broken’. “After countless disappointments in relationships, one becomes numb and cold… There is nothing left to give to another person, and yet the endless search for the perfect person continues. It’s always easier to leave everything behind and start anew”, says singer Stina Girs about the song. The band describes the concept behind the video: “The main character starts sculpting a vision of perfection, only to shatter it, symbolizing the disappointments in love and relationships. Piece by piece, she starts tearing it apart. At this stage, the mood of the performance shots also changes, and crumbling clay begins to fall on the band members”. “Around the visual storytelling, we see super slow motion shots of the band and Stina’s vocal parts, which are filmed both in slow motion and at normal speed. The music video is filmed at the historic Lapinlahti Hospital in Finland, one of the oldest psychiatric hospitals in Europe” they continue.\n\nTalented Brazilian Rock band Malvada unveil their new single and video, ‘Down The Walls’, out now via Frontiers Music Srl. Talking about the single, singer Indira Castilho says “’Down the walls’ is a song that describes a relationship based on lies and psychological control. It tells about a situation that many women go through but that is never discussed. The music aims to show the reality, alert women and bring courage to face this situation”. “The riffs are very heavy, rhythmic and connected to the drums”, adds guitarist Bruna Tsuruda. Drummer Juliana Salgado describes it as “a strong music, with strong guitar riffs and drum beats”, while bassist Rafaela Reoli states “I think it’s the perfect song to introduce Malvada to the world”.\n\nRap metal sensation Sicksense – featuring vocalists Vicky Psarakis (ex-The Agonist) and Robby J. Fonts (Stuck Mojo) – have released their new single, ‘On Repeat’. Check out the official video below. The band’s Earache Records debut, Cross Me Twice, will be released on February 14, 2025.\n\nArch Enemy have unveiled their first new music since their acclaimed 2022 album, Deceivers, by surprise releasing the new single and video ‘Dream Stealer.’ The veteran extreme metal band’s guitarist Michael Amott stated, “First new Arch Enemy song we release in a little while and it feels good to be back! It was a blast working on ‘Dream Stealer’ in the studio, this song just has the high energy and twisted atmosphere that makes it so fun to play! Crank it up, loud and heavy! Metal is immortal!” After a haunting instrumental intro, singer Alissa White-Gluz kicks off the vocals with a monster scream, and goes full guttural for the rest of the powerful track. The song is accompanied by an equally dramatic music video, directed by Patric Ullaeus. [via Consequence]\n\nFUTURE PALACE have released a new music video. The new music video, for the track ‘Decarabia,’ is taken from the German post-hardcore band’s upcoming new album, Distortion, which is scheduled to be released in September this year, via Arising Empire. The band have dedicated the new single to the relationships of people who are suffering from mental illnesses. The picture the band paints of this difficult circumstance is engagingly complex and asks fundamental questions: How much can we help the loved ones around us when we ourselves are already dealing with so many of our own demons? How can we not be alone in our struggles when at the same time we see how it becomes too much for our counterpart? “It’s not just bad if you yourself lose joy in life. It hurts all the more when you find out that a loved person has to deal with it,” vocalist Maria Lessing explains, reporting on experiences that come from her own life. “It’s a struggle to try to support someone when you need all your strength to be able to function. But in the end you can resolve even such serious problems with work and growth and become happy together. In any case, I hope so.” [via Distorted Sound]\n\nJust over a month out from Jinjer’s next U.S. tour, the Ukrainian prog-metal crushers have dropped a surprise single that may well pop into their upcoming setlists. The song, titled ‘Someone’s Daughter,’ arrives as a percussively punishing, and spirit-empowering battle anthem. The studio track finds the act once again needling into precision drum battery, bassist Eugene Kostyuk’s slippery fretwork, and vocalist Tatiana Shmayluk’s cascade of immaculate melodies and rumbling death-growls. The music video, which you can see below, mixes performance footage with CGI landscapes. With its lyrics themed around cutting a signature path in the world as a woman, Shmayluk also gets into character while seemingly dressing up as iconic figures like chemist Marie Curie or Egyptian ruler Cleopatra. “´Someone’s Daughter´ is an artistic attempt to cast the light on the inner world of women, who in various scenarios and circumstances, have had to choose a path that was historically made by men,” the singer said in a statement. “In a world where women are often underestimated and overlooked, they are still powerful heroes who navigate hardship with strength and resilience, unapologetically becoming themselves and breaking barriers in the face of the challenges that face them. ‘Someone’s Daughter’ celebrates transitions from naivety into wisdom, weakness into force, unwavering determination, and fearlessness as our mothers, sisters, daughters, and wives walk through adversity and fight for better change. These women are often forgotten but they have earned respect. They‘ve earned mine, that’s for sure!” [via Revolver]\n\nCriminal activity and psychology has been at the forefront of SKYND’s music from the start, observing the bleakest and most horrific aspects of the human condition through musical and lyrical examinations of true crimes and their impact on the victims and society. Marking the duo’s second single of 2024, ‘Violets are Blue’ looks at the 2012 murder of Jun Lin by Luka Magnotta, with Skynd and Father saying that the case points out the severity of mental health issues and the importance of recognizing and addressing them before they lead to violence, as well as the ethical responsibilities of the media and the criminal justice system. Jun Lin was an international student at Concordia University in Montreal, studying computer engineering; he was stabbed and dismembered by Luka Rocco Magnotta, who mailed parts of Lin’s body to schools and political party offices, as well as posted videos online depicting the murder – this has led to him being referred to as an “Internet Killer.” Magnotta was arrested in Berlin less than a month later, and was sentenced two years later to life and an additional 19 years for other charges such as sexual assault, animal abuse, and public obscenity – during his trial, issues of his mental stability were raised, including diagnoses of schizophrenia and several personality disorders. As Lin was a gay man, SKYND has also pointed out the purpose of ‘Violets are Blue’ to discuss the impact such crimes have on the LGBTQ+ community. “This case brought attention to issues of violence within the community and the unique vulnerabilities faced by LGBTQ+ individuals and it therefore felt very important for me to explore,” Skynd says, pointing out the importance of standing up for diversity in the band’s music. The accompanying music video was directed by regular SKYND collaborator P.R. Brown, produced by Anique Wild, and stars David Bruckner. [via ReGen Mag]\n\nItalian metal masters Lacuna Coil have unveiled a new single titled ‘Hosting the Shadow’ featuring guest vocals from Lamb of God frontman Randy Blythe. The song marks another new stand-alone single from Lacuna Coil, who earlier this year unveiled the track ‘In the Mean Time’ featuring New Years Day singer Ash Costello. While Lacuna Coil are already known for their dual vocal attack from Cristina Scabbia and Andrea Ferro, Blythe takes the band’s sound to a new extreme. After an extended instrumental intro, the Lamb of God singer’s voice is heard first on the song, as he delivers his signature growl in the verses, where he is eventually joined by Ferro. Scabbia’s clean singing then arrives in the melodic chorus. “‘Hosting the Shadow’ is a trip through light and dark, where silence reveals its hidden secrets,” stated Lacuna Coil. “Obscure moments can become occasions to evolve, to learn to master one’s own shadow — which is crucial in order to prevail. Randy Blythe did an incredible job on this track, we absolutely adore his voice and his evil laugh!” The band continued, “Our admiration for him is infinite and to have him as a guest on this song is a dream come true. Partnering with a friend you respect immensely, that also kicks ass on stages around the world: it doesn’t get any better than this. We’re looking forward to the day we can perform ‘Hosting the Shadow’ live together!” [via Consequence]"
