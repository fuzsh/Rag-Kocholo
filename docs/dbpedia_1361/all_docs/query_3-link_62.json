        "text": "Itâ€™s been far too long since last I saw Lacuna Coil live, the previous occasion being here in Liverpool when they played (and packed out) the lower floor of Liverpoolâ€™s o2 Academy. That show, way back in 2010, was the last time to date they played in our city, and whenever theyâ€™ve come around since then their dates tended to coincide or come close to gigs by other bands Iâ€™d already booked for. So it was high time I put that right and renew my acquaintance with Cristina Scabbia, Andrea Ferro and the band after all these years. This time around they had as special guests Eluveitie, a band I know about but I am not all that familiar with their material. In fact, I know more about three of their former members (who formed Cellar Darling following their departure from Eluveitie) than I do of this band! So I was also looking forward to seeing this group, but before all of that we had Infected Rain opening proceedings. Iâ€™d got to the Ritz earlier than Iâ€™d expected to, given the usual traffic nightmares you endure whenever going to Manchester for a gig (this is why it isnâ€™t THAT convenient for us this end of the A580, o gig promoters!) especially midweek. So I was there in time to queue up, get a reasonable spot and see the opening band. So far so good!\n\nInfected Rain are a Moldovan band fronted by the splendidly-named Lena Scissorhands, who bounded onto the stage with her hair in bright orange dreads! They sound not a million miles removed from Lacuna Coil themselves albeit with a more aggressive vocal from Scissorhands herself, and that was enhanced when for one number they actually brought out Coilâ€™s guitarist Didi Cavalotti â€“ the frontwoman explained that they were actually down one member for this tour, as one of the guitarists was forced to sit it out (â€˜personal reasonsâ€™ was all she gave by way of explanation). It didnâ€™t seem to matter as they were suitably heavy and enthusiastic, though I could have done without the call for a pit in the last number â€“ I soon made way! This was the bandâ€™s first ever UK show, and although the vocalist admitted that she and the group were nervous (well, she put it rather differently!) they got a good reception from an already healthy crowd.\n\nMy first impression of Eluveitie was that there was a lot of them! The line-up is nine strong, featuring two guitarists, a bassist and a drummer, plus a flautist, a hurdy-gurdy player, a violinist and a harpist who also contributes vocals alongside frontman Chrigel Glanzmann, who takes lead vocal as well as playing bouzouki, additional flute or whatever else happens to be lying about! It was the harpist/singer (Fabienne Erni) who led the way with her voice, before the whole ensemble kicked into opening number â€˜Ategnatosâ€™. Despite all the folky instrumentation, make no mistake â€“ this was a Metal band! Glanzmann delivers a typically harsh â€˜Metalâ€™ vocal, counterbalanced by Erniâ€™s beautiful voice, though when they kick into gear they can thrash with the best of them! Iâ€™ve never seen such instruments used in this style of music before, although this band has been around for over ten years now. Theyâ€™re all very visual, with guitarists Rafael Salzmann and Jonas Wolf throwing shapes alongside bassist Kay Brem, and Matteo Sisti across the stage often taking a prominent role; not only on flute but bagpipes too!\n\nHurdy-gurdy player Michalina Malisz was a little more reserved; unlike her predecessor (Anna Murphy, now of Cellar Darling) she doesnâ€™t sing too, leaving that role to Fabienne Erni.\n\nThis band were more lively than Iâ€™d bargained for, and perhaps I should have cribbed their material before the show rather than watching them â€˜coldâ€™ â€“ then again, when itâ€™s a band I know little about, I like to see what they bring to the live situation before checking out their studio work. Eluveitie bring a lot to the table, and their set of around 50 minutes packed a lot in. Iâ€™d like to see these again should they come back to this country next year.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about Lacuna Coil when they came on was that they were also down one since last I saw them; in the intervening period theyâ€™ve had a few personnel changes. Now they have only one guitarist in the aforementioned Didi Cavalotti, and the drum stool is now occupied by Richard Meiz, who took over this year from Ryan Blake Folden â€“ who himself succeeded Criz Mozatti, the drummer the last time I saw this band. None of this seems to have affected their basic sound, still that alt-metal sound built on syncopated drums with the vocal tag team of Cristina Scabbia and Andrea Ferro still present and correct. Both were wearing hoodies based on the design for current album â€˜Black Animaâ€™, while Cavalotti, Meiz and bassist Marco Coti Zelati had their faces painted black and white (you could say KISS-inspired) for the show.\n\nAlthough the set leaned towards the current album and previous one â€˜Deliriumâ€™, they did delve back through several of their older albums. Scabbia sounded in impeccable voice, one of the best singers in the current scene in my book. She and the band exuded a defiant attitude best illustrated by her speech prior to closer â€˜Nothing Stands In Our Wayâ€™ â€“ encouraging all present not to let anyone else grind them down whatever their situation. As usual they featured their cover of Depeche Modeâ€™s â€˜Enjoy The Silenceâ€™, before coming back to play the lighthearted â€˜Naughty Christmasâ€™ (that was a BIT naughty, as it was only mid-November, folks!) and the one we were all waiting for, â€˜Heavenâ€™s A Lieâ€™.\n\nThis was a fine performance by a band still on top of their game, one of the leading lights of the â€˜female frontedâ€™ (not a genre!) scene. I wonâ€™t leave it so long before seeing the Italian metallers again, though itâ€™s to be hoped that they do find their way to our end of the M62 again seeing as theyâ€™ve done it twice before! ðŸ˜‰\n\nLacuna Coil Facebook page\n\nEluveitie Facebook page"
