        "text": "This post was originally published on October 26th, 2021, after the initial release of Heavy Metal Symphony. I decided to do an updated version with some new bands and song recommendations. Enjoy!\n\nSo you have read or are reading Heavy Metal Symphony (and if that’s you, yay! Thank you!) and since Handel’s Messiah is, sadly, not a real a band, you may find yourself wondering: what do they sound like, exactly? What is symphonic metal? What should I listen to in order to get a feel for Handel’s Messiah’s sound?\n\nWell, you’re in luck, because I have aaaallll the recommendations for you! (Shout out to Piepie Baltz, who gave me the idea for this post!)\n\nFirst of all, a definition: symphonic metal is one of the many subgenres of heavy metal (other subgenres include power metal, death metal, black metal, doom metal, progressive metal, and so on, and often bands can fit into more than one subgenre). Symphonic metal is when a metal band incorporates elements of classical music into their sound: choirs, strings, a full orchestra, classical singing styles, and so forth. Bands can use one or all of those elements to be considered “symphonic metal”, and different bands approach it differently: some bands use samples of choirs or strings on their songs, while others (usually bigger bands with the financial ability to do so, like Epica and Nightwish) will work with actual choirs and orchestras. For me, a classically trained musician and lover of classical music as well as someone who loves heavy music, this fusion of classical and metal is my absolute favorite thing. It appeals to all parts of my musical brain, and I just adore the drama and grandiosity of the sound. At the end of the day, there are more similarities than differences between classical and metal music (and indeed, a lot of metal musicians are classically trained, as are some of the band members in Heavy Metal Symphony), which is why they go together so well.\n\nSo, since you can’t actually listen to Handel’s Messiah, what are some symphonic metal bands you CAN listen to? Read on to find out!\n\nNightwish\n\nNightwish is one of the top bands in the symphonic metal genre (and they are my personal all-time favorite band, and the first band I saw live after the COVID pandemic, and I will forever be grateful that they were). Formed in Finland, they’re a bit more international these days with members also from the U.K. and the Netherlands. They’ve been plagued by several lineup changes over the years, and have had three lead singers since their inception. Their current lead singer, Floor Jansen, is absolutely one of the best metal vocalists on the planet. She can do it all: belt, growl, and sing in a classical style. I drew a lot of inspiration for Ava and her singing style from Floor. Below are a few songs to get you started on Nightwish’s extensive catalogue.\n\n“Dark Chest of Wonders”, off of Nightwish’s blockbuster 2004 album Once (and their final album with original lead singer Tarja Turunen), is one of the first songs I would recommend to someone looking to get a taste for what symphonic metal is. It’s got it all: orchestral elements, a choir, and the band going HARD throughout it all. This clip is from the band’s performance at the Wacken Open Air metal festival in 2013, shortly after Floor Jansen joined the band. This particular performance is immortalized on the band’s live album and DVD, Showtime, Storytime (which is honestly a favorite album of all time for me; this performance is flawless).\n\nNightwish is, in my opinion, notoriously bad at choosing singles from their albums, but this song, “Storytime” from 2011’s Imaginerum (the second and final album with the band’s second lead singer, Anette Olzon), was the exception. It’s a great song, upbeat and catchy but still with their signature epic sound. And as a writer, this song very much has a special place in my heart!\n\n“Shudder Before the Beautiful” is the opening track from Nightwish’s 2015 album Endless Forms Most Beautiful, their first studio album with Jansen. This is one of my favorite songs of all time, and is a good encapsulation of their sound.\n\nAnother one from the Wacken Open Air show in 2013 – “Song of Myself”, another all-time favorite song of mine. This song is a bit bigger than the other two I’ve shared: longer, and divided into multiple movements. Fun fact: I have a line of lyrics from this song tattooed on my left arm: “A song of me, a song in need/of a courageous symphony.”\n\nAnother all-time favorite song! This one is also epic but catchy (Nightwish is SO good at that) and, as the title suggests, is the song the band has often played to close out their shows. And why so many live clips? Because this is a band that is truly exceptional live, and in the spirit of Heavy Metal Symphony being very much about live music and performance!\n\nOkay, one more by Nightwish! This song is, you guessed it, another all-time favorite (hence why Nightwish is my favorite band!). “Shoemaker” is off of their most recent album, Human. :||: Nature., which was released in April 2020, just after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (and BOY did I need a new Nightwish album just then). The end section of this song is, in my opinion, flawlessly beautiful and some of my favorite measures of music ever. I maaaaay have full-on sobbed when I heard it live last year.\n\nEpica\n\nDutch band Epica, fronted by classical mezzo-soprano Simone Simons, take all the grandeur and bombast of symphonic metal to the absolute top. Their songs tend to be longer and are quite elaborate. This is a band that is still on my list to see live someday!\n\n“Unleashed” was the first single off of 2009’s Design Your Universe, and I was completely obsessed with it when it came out: once per commute to college or back, I was blasting this song and singing along. This song is a bit more accessible if you’re new to Epica or to symphonic metal, and I love the lyrics about reaching your full potential.\n\nI think “Once Upon a Nightmare”, from 2016’s The Holographic Principle, is just gorgeous. Epica does EXCELLENT ballads and power ballads, and this one really showcases the range of what symphonic metal can be. (Also, is “Once Upon a Nightmare” not the greatest title??).\n\n“The Skeleton Key” is from Epica’s most recent full-length album, 2021’s Omega. Again in the spirit of live music, the clip above is from the band’s livestream concert from earlier this year, which they’ve since released in DVD/Blu Ray form. I love the instrumentation in this and the eerie vibe of it.\n\n“Rivers” is another gorgeous Epica ballad, also off of Omega, and is one of my favorite songs off of that album. It’s just beautiful!\n\nWithin Temptation\n\nDutch metal band Within Temptation has been around for a long time, and they are excellent. Sometimes referred to as “gothic metal”, their sound has evolved and changed quite a bit over the years as they’ve added new elements in, from 80s synth-pop to techno and hip-hop. The constants, though, are always their big sound, chugging guitars, and lead singer Sharon den Adel’s voice. Nightwish, Epica, and Within Temptation are largely considered to be the “Big Three” of symphonic metal.\n\n“The Howling”, like Nightwish’s “Dark Chest of Wonders”, would be one of the first songs I’d recommend to someone looking to get a feel for symphonic metal. It has it all: the choir and orchestra, the bombast of the full band, and a killer lead vocal. This song is from 2007’s The Heart of Everything, which remains my favorite Within Temptation album.\n\n“Stand My Ground”, from 2004’s The Silent Force, is one of Within Temptation’s most popular songs. This version is from their Black Symphony show, a concert they did with The Metropole Orchestra and a choir in the Netherlands in 2008, and which they recorded and released a live DVD and CD of. (Epica has done similar performances as well). Talk about the ultimate symphonic metal experience!\n\n“What Have You Done”, which features guest vocalist Keith Caputo, is another favorite Within Temptation songs of mine. I love the interplay between the two singers in this song, and the story that takes place within it. This song is also from 2007’s The Heart of Everything. Fun fact: this song helped inspire my upcoming historical novel!\n\n“Faster” was the lead single off the band’s 2011 album The Unforgiving, which had an accompanying comic book. This is a catchy, fun song that’s great to blast with the windows down.\n\nOver the last few years, Within Temptation has been releasing one-off songs, and supposedly a full album is coming sometime soon. “Don’t Pray for Me” is one of those recent songs, and I just love it. It has classic WT symphonic bombast, and the lyrics, about not letting people force their beliefs onto you, are incredibly pointed and powerful.\n\nKamelot\n\nKamelot is technically an American band, founded by Floridian and guitarist Thomas Youngblood, but, like Nightwish, now has members from different countries: lead singer Tommy Karevik is Swedish (but now lives in Canada with his wife, Kobra Paige of Kobra and the Lotus fame) and keyboardist Oliver Palotai is from Germany (and is also the husband of Simone Simons from Epica). Kamelot has also been through a few lineup changes, the biggest being the departure of lead singer Roy Khan in 2012, after which he was replaced by Karevik. Kamelot falls more onto the power metal end of the spectrum, but they do make use of symphonic elements as well. Fun fact: Kamelot’s music features HEAVILY on the playlist for The Borgia Confessions. And yet another fun fact: the day that this post goes live, I will be heading up to Toronto for a Kamelot concert!\n\nIn March of this year, Kamelot released their most recent studio album, The Awakening, and OH BOY is it great. “New Babylon”, with guest singer Melissa Bonny of Ad Infinitum fame, is the most classic symphonic metal song on the record. It does my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE THING that symphonic metal bands do, which is to have the lead singer sing this lovely legato melody over a chanting choir. It’s my musical catnip, I love it absolutely every time it happens.\n\nThis song has been my major obsession for 2023, because it is amazing, of course, but also because it has ALL the vibes of the fantasy book I’ve been working on this year, and is also the “sequel song” to Kamelot’s earlier song “Ghost Opera”, which was the very first every seed of inspiration for said book (more about this here, if you’re interested). This is another great symphonic metal song, with lots of bombast and a classical touch from cellist Tina Guo, who guests on the song.\n\nTime for another live clip! “Phantom Divine” is off the band’s 2018 album The Shadow Theory, and is absolute banger. This clip is from their live DVD, I Am the Empire – Live from the 013, which was released in 2020 and was recorded at their show at the 013 in Tilburg, the Netherlands, in 2018.\n\n“Liar Liar (Wasteland Monarchy)” is off of the band’s 2015 album, Haven, and features guest vocals from Alissa White-Gluz of Arch Enemy. This is a loud, hard-rocking song with a killer guitar riff. Fun fact: this is the song for the very last scene of The Borgia Confessions.\n\nDelain\n\nDelain is a (largly) Dutch band formed by keyboardist Martijn Westerholt. This is another band that has gone through numerous line up changes over the years, with the most consequential coming in 2021, when the band essentially disbanded, leading Westerholt to then reform it with a new lineup. While I am sad that Charlotte Wessels, one of my all-time favorite musicians and songwriters, is no longer the lead singer, Delain’s newest album since reforming, Dark Waters, is REAL GOOD. Below is just a sampling of their catalogue.\n\n“Masters of Destiny” was first released on the band’s 2019 EP Hunter’s Moon, and was also on their 2020 album Apocalypse and Chill, which was the last album before the band was reformed. (And what a prophetic title, considering the album came out in February of 2020). I. LOVE. This. Song. It’s one of my all-time favorites, and it’s everything symphonic metal should be: a huge sound, a powerful lead vocal, tons of bombast. I distinctly remember listening to this song for the first time while driving to work and being underwhelmed by the soft intro and thinking, “Huh, I wish Delain had gone a bit bigger with their new stuff”, and then HOLY SHIT, this song became ENORMOUS.\n\n“The Glory and the Scum” is off of Delain’s 2016 album Moonbathers, and is a great, punchy, hard-rocking song that showcases Charlotte Wessels’s unparalleled gift for melody. Fun fact: this song is on the playlist for The Borgia Confessions, but most of the Moonbathers album is on the playlist for The Spellbook of Katrina Van Tassel – it came out the Friday that I was away on a writing retreat and finished writing the first draft.\n\n“The Cold” is on Delain’s new album with their new line up, including new lead singer Diana Leah. This is yet another of those songs I would point someone towards first if they were looking to get a feel for symphonic metal: the chugging guitars, the orchestra, the choir, the overall vibe. And this one is actually on the Heavy Metal Symphony playlist – it got added as I was doing my last revision!\n\nThis is another song off of the newest Delain album, and I very much love this one – it’s also on the playlist for my fantasy WIP and so has been in pretty heavy rotation since it came out earlier this year (and the video also has a very similar vibe to my WIP, weirdly enough!).\n\nLacuna Coil\n\nWhile Italy’s Lacuna Coil is more straight heavy metal than symphonic metal – they also sometimes get called goth metal – they were the first metal band I really got into, so I felt I had to include them here. With two lead singers, Cristina Scabbia and Andrea Ferro, the band has a lot of versatility in their sound and has been going strong since the 90s.\n\n“Spellbound” is off Lacuna Coil’s 2009 album Shallow Life, and one of my favorite albums of theirs. This song is hard rocking but catchy at the same time (which is no doubt why it was the first single off this album).\n\n“Swamped”, off the 2004 album Comalies (the album that got me into not only Lacuna Coil but metal in general), was one of the first songs of theirs that I fell in love with. It’s a great, heavy song, with awesome interplay between Cristina and Andrea.\n\nFrom the 2019 album Black Anima, “Veneficium” is one one of Lacuna Coil’s more “symphonic” sounds, what with the Latin and all. This is one of my favorite songs of theirs, and when I saw them live last year in September I was THRILLED when they played it.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this (brief) guide to symphonic metal, and found some songs you liked! Hopefully you’ll explore some of these bands’ catalogues in more depth. There’s nothing I love more than introducing someone to their new favorite band.\n\nHeavy Metal Symphony is out now!
