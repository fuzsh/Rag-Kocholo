        "text": "World Rock Day 2024\n\nQueens of Rock ‘n’ Roll and Heavy Metal – The Talented Divas\n\nA World Rock Day Celebration\n\nBy Mauro B. Fonseca, Victor Augusto, and Metalphysicist\n\n“World Rock Day” is celebrated in Brazil on July 13, the date on which the “Live Aid” Festival took place, which had the participation of numerous Rock icons.\n\nPhil Collins expressed during his performances, that the event should be annual. Some radio broadcasters, from two or three Brazil’s radio stations that played the musical genre in their programming, reinforced Phil Collins’ suggestion numerous times. The idea pleased the listening public to such an extent, that around 1990, World Rock Day was instituted (unofficially) in the country to commemorate the existence of Rock.\n\nRecently I found out that only in Brazil is “World Rock Day” celebrated, how ironic, the “world” day of something that is only celebrated in Brazil. As I’m writing for this British site, I thought it would be interesting to use this day to expose some figures, and facts, that made history in Rock N’ Roll and Heavy Metal that we listen to today. I invited the Ever Metal’s crew to contribute and participate that celebration.\n\nWe will talk about the pioneering women, protagonists, supporting actors, musicians, creators, composers and very important for the development of Rock N’ Roll and all its aspects, they played/play an important role in the creation and development of Rock and its aspects.\n\nUnfortunately, their contributions are hazy, as they are underestimated and almost despised by the “machismo” that reigns in the music industry. In fact, many of the representatives listed here are not even remembered when talking about the history of Rock, even I was unaware of several of them, the pioneers in general died poor, miserable and without any recognition for their achievements and contributions to the musical genre. Many of them, when they retire from the spotlight, are forgotten and/or quickly replaced, being destined for the limbo of history.\n\nThis text is a very humble and unpretentious way of remembering these true “Queens of Rock n’ Roll and Heavy Metal” and trying to do them a little justice. At the end of the text, you will find a link to a Spotify playlist that brings a sample of what these women have done for Rock and Metal over the years.\n\nI do like to thank Ever Metal’s site owner Beth Morait for giving me the space and liberty to do this little homage to these talented musicians, and would also like to thank my Brazilian friends Victor Augusto for nominating me to the website group and for his kind contribution to this endeavour, and last but not least Wallace Magri for his equally kind contribution to this project.\n\nPS: What do you think about you and your friends starting to pressure the congressman of your city, state or country to implement this “Rock Day” in your homeland? “13 July for all…” #WorldRockDayForAll, #13JulyForAll\n\nHave fun\n\nMauro B. Fonseca\n\n01 – Memphis Minie (1897-1973)\n\nLizzie Douglas or Memphis Minnie born in June 3, 1897 and died in August 6, 1973. Was an American blues singer and songwriter who recorded around 200 songs between the 1920s and 1950s.\n\nHer most famous songs are “Bumble Bee”, “Nothing in Rambling” and “Me and My Chauffeur Blues”. She is also remembered today for writing a song called “When the Levee Breaks”, which, with slightly altered lyrics and melody, was covered by Led Zeppelin.\n\nShe died poor, sick and (almost) forgotten, in an asylum. She was buried in an unmarked grave and remained so until in 1996 another singer named Bonnie Raitt paid to install a headstone that identified Memphis Minie.\n\n‘When The Levee Breaks’ Audio Recording\n\n02 – Elizabeth Cotten (1895-1987)\n\nElizabeth “Libba” Cotten was an American folk and blues musician. Being a left-handed and self-taught guitarist.\n\nBecause she plays right-handed guitars, she learned to play with the guitar upside down.\n\nThis position meant that she played the bass lines with her fingers and the melody with her thumb, she became a master of the art of strumming.\n\nShe was so important to the folk style that her technique was named “Cotten picking” in her honour, this technique consists of left-handed people learning to make the chords on right-handed guitars played upside down. Edgar Scandurra (a well-known left-handed Brazilian musician), for example, uses this technique.\n\nShe started playing the banjo at the age of 7, but only performed live for the first time, in her early 60s, after being discovered by the mother of the folk singer Peggy Seeger.\n\n‘Freight Train’ Audio Recording\n\n03 – Sister Rosetta Tharpe (1915-1973)\n\nShe is one of the most important names in the history of Rock And Roll. Born on March 20, 1915, in Arkansas, United States, the talented artist was a pioneer in the use of guitars and distortions, and even with a career focused on Gospel, she managed to catch the attention of fans of other genres because of her recordings and performances.\n\nShe was a pioneer in her guitar technique; She was one of the first popular artists to use heavy distortion on her electric guitar, presaging the rise of the electric blues.\n\nEarly rock and roll musicians, including Little Richard, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Jeff Beck and Keith Richards were influenced by his work.\n\nAt the end of 1944, she recorded her version of “Strange Things Happening Every Day”, a traditional song among blacks living in the United States, released in 1945. The song was popularized by its recording and is considered by many to be the first rock and roll sound recorded in the studio in history.\n\n‘Strange Things Happening Every Day’ Audio Recording\n\n04 – Wanda Jackson (1937- )\n\nWanda Jackson, affectionately known as the “First Lady of Rockabilly” or “Queen of Rockabilly,” is a pioneering figure in the music scene of the 1950s.\n\nBorn in 1937, her boldness and singular talent have won the hearts of music fans. Jackson left an indelible mark by blending traditional country with the emerging rock sound, contributing to the definition of the genre.\n\nHer powerful voice and fearless attitude made her stand out as one of the first women to shine in the world of rock.

Joplin is remembered for hits such as “Piece of My Heart” and “Me and Bobby McGee”.\n\nShe is part (unfortunately) of the select club of the Curse of the 27, where several musicians died at the age of 27, usually as a result of drug’s abuse. Her life was abruptly cut short by an overdose in 1970, leaving a lasting legacy as one of the greatest voices in rock and blues.\n\n‘Piece of My Heart’ Official Audio\n\n06 – Rita Lee (1947-2023)\n\nRita Lee Jones de Carvalho was a Brazilian singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, presenter, actress, writer and activist.

And they smashed the venue that day, playing some well-known songs for their first album, “A Noite Vai Ferver” (2021), which is a nice album to take a listen to.\n\nOn the already mentioned gig, they were great performers onstage, and I also realized that Malvada is a ‘girls-only’ band, with endless passion and feeling delivered to the audience.\n\nIn the end of 2023, the band Malvada signed a licensing agreement with the Italian label, Frontiers Srl., which was a great deal for the Record Company because I am positive that the band is going to surpass expectations with their second album. And, to give a taste of what is about to come, they realeased a new single, “Veneno” that is wortha listen to keep in touch with the band’s evolution along their long journey in Rock/ Hard Rock/ Metal scene around the world.\n\nWallace Magri\n\n‘Veneno’ Official Music Video\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/malvadabanda/\n\n34 – Crypta (2019- )\n\nNervosa, in the year 2020, broke up and the musicians parted ways, no hard feelings, and, while Prika Amaral stood up alone to keep Nervosa moving ahead, Lua Dametto (drums) e Fernanda Lira (bass and voices) formed Crypta, that kept the ‘women-only’ rule.\n\nThe interesting fact is that Nervosa’s split hasn’t resulted in Nervosa ending. Far from that Nervosa is still around, and Fernanda Lira became the intimidating and feracious singer and bass player front woman of Crypta. And, after the departure’s bad feelings, everyone who enjoys Death/Thrash Metal realized that the good news is that now we have two great bands with girls ‘players only’ touring all around the world.\n\nCheck out Crypta’s second album, “Shades of Sorrow” with your headphones on the volume 10 to and see if you fancy the Extreme Metal at its best.\n\nMetalphysicist\n\n‘From The Ashes’ Official Video\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/cryptadeath/\n\n35 – Nervosa (2010- )\n\nIn Brazil, Thrash Metal is probably the favourite´s metal genre around here. And, sure, we have the phenomenon called Sepultura, the masters of Brazilian’s Thrash Metal, founded in 1983 that brought their mark all around the world until today and so on.\n\nAmong the several Thrash Metal bands founded in the grace of Sepultura, in the last four decades, the band Nervosa was founded in 2010 and have released two Eps and four full-length albums since then.\n\nThe interesting fact about the band Nervosa is that they count with ‘women-only’ line up, since the day one. I remember, on the first time that I listened to Nervosa, I was amazed to listen to vocals with such aggressiveness and powerhouse songs. I loved it!\n\nNervosa is a band that kept going working hard since day one and had released their last album, “Jailbreak” in 2023, always with Prika Amaral (guitar player) in command, playing on incredible Festivals (Rock in Rio) in Brazil and around the world. So, checkout Nervosa playing in a Festival nearby your town no matter where you are on Planet Earth.\n\nMetalphysicist\n\n‘Perpetual Chaos’ Official Lyric Video\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nervosathrash/\n\n36 – Cobra Spell (2019- )\n\nCobra Spell is one of the most promising bands in the retro hard’n’heavy scene of the 80s. Founded in 2019 by emerging guitarist Sonia Anubis (ex-Crypta), Cobra Spell’s current lineup is completed by Kristina Vega on vocals, Brazilian Twitch streamer Noelle dos Anjos on guitar, Hale Naphtha on drums and Roxy Herrera on bass.\n\nTogether, they have toured with numerous renowned bands, such as guitarist Ross The Boss (Manowar, Dictators), Enforcer and Evil Invaders and others, and released two globally praised EPs, Love Venom (2020) and Anthems of the Night (2022). With these stars under their studded leather belts, Cobra Spell releases their first album changing nothing less than, according to them, “the world domination of rock ‘n’ roll in the 80s”.\n\nPrepared to conquer the world, the band soon caught the attention of the powerful record label Napalm Records (Jinjer, KK’s Priest, Kamelot, Nervosa, Crypta, etc.) who offered a contract. Cobra Spell then released its debut album entitled “666” on December 1, 2023.\n\nA true manifesto against the limitations imposed on women, “666” is not just good music, but an act of rebellion against gender inequality, a cry for freedom of expression and a fight to deny the stigma of women’s sexual freedom.\n\n‘The Devil Inside of Me’ Official Video\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/cobraspell/\n\n37 – Susane Hécate (1975- )\n\nBrasília is a quite new city, with just 6 decades since its creation, when it was built to be the capital of Brazil, in 1960. Despite this short period of existence, this city has already offered a quite interesting history related to Rock music and Heavy Metal. When we think about Extreme Metal Bands, we can’t forget about the force of all pioneer women that appeared in Brasília, since the late eighties and early nineties. Bands like Miasthenia, Valhalla, Volkana and Flammea helped to open doors for the incredible number of female Heavy Metal bands, nowadays\n\nI chose to talk about Miasthenia first, out of the chronological order, only for being the most active of them, also my favorite one as well. They are a Pagan Metal band who bring the dark sonority from Black Metal, but they play it incredibly well with harmonies, melodies and techniques of a great Heavy Metal band. The Portuguese lyrics are far from the silly Satanism or Antichrist themes you often get, thanks to the Vocalist and the master brain of the band, Susane Hécate.\n\nShe has a doctor’s degree in history and teaches at a local university and both of these things help her to create romances based on the theme. Susane delves deep into old civilization histories and describes how the Christians enforced their dogmas and culture, sometimes with bloodshed, during the 16th Century colonization.\n\nDo you want one example about it? On my last review about them, I mentioned a short description about the song ‘Coniupuyaras’ and It says that “In 1542, in the South America forests, the powerful female Indian warriors Coniupuyaras confronted the Orellana conquering troops on the huge Amazonas River, disturbing the Christian and patriarchal order imposed by colonialism.”\n\nAmazing, isn’t it? As amazing as her intelligent way of criticizing these dogmas and religion is her interpretation of it on stage. Considering she is in front of Miasthenia since 1994, and the band is still very active and relevant in Brazil, Susane became very respected by all the great bands who also have female presence in their lineup.\n\nFor me, she is one of the Brazilians musicians that I most admire among all others in Brazil\n\nVictor Augusto\n\n‘Coniupuyaras’ Official Video\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/miasthenia\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/susanehecate/\n\n38 – Adriana Tavares\n\nDespite I spent my entire childhood in Brasília, I just started to follow that Heavy Metal scene in 2007, when I returned to live there at the age of 23. I clearly remember the first underground concert I went which was to see Torture Squad, a very famous Brazilian Death Metal that (nowadays) has a woman as vocalist.\n\nOne of the opening bands was Valhalla. I got impressed by their quality and heaviness and it was the first time I saw a complete female band playing Heavy Metal. At that time, bands with woman on their line up weren’t quite new, after Arch Enemy already had achieved a notorious career, but what my friends out of Brazil maybe don’t know is that Valhalla, and all bands I am talking about here, have been on the road since the early nineties.\n\nValhalla, for example, released their first full album “…in the Darkness of Limb” in 1994, after the first demo “Valhalla” in 1992, and they are still active, despite several lineup changes.\n\nLast year, the founder member and guitarist Adriana Tavares appeared singing on ‘Mind Prisoners’, single (to be released on a new album) and I believe it is something new for her, considering Valhalla had other vocalists before.\n\nWhen we talk about women references in this extreme metal scene, there is no doubts that Valhalla is one of the greatest names in this country and Adriana is still carrying this important flag in Brazil.\n\nVictor Augusto\n\n‘Inside a Black Mirror’ Official Music Video\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100063439611668\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/valhalladeathmetal/\n\n39 – Flammea (1988- )\n\nIn 2023, the metalheads from Brasília received an interesting gift, which was the release of “In Front Of The Mirror” EP from Flammea, one of first female bands that appeared here.\n\nIs it a new album? Not exactly. For what I could understand, it was originally recorded in 1989 but it became something rare to find. Now, with a new mix, this album is available and sound like a travel in the time to try to imagine everything this band had to conquer to have an all-female band playing this kind of music, in the late 1988.\n\nFrom what I researched, the original line up was Shirley Jovi (Vocals), Dayse Bentim (guitars), Adriana Tavares (guitars), Zane Galvão (bass) e Ana A. Lima (Drums). Adriana Tavares left the band to start with Valhalla (that I mentioned before) and Ana A. Lima is still working with the band.\n\nThey had several hiatuses, with few Demos released in the nineties, but Flammea is very respected and frequently mentioned on the history of Brasília.\n\nVictor Augusto\n\n‘In Front of The Mirror’ Official Lyric Video\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FlammeaOfficial\n\n40 – Simone Death (Syang) (1968- )\n\nP.U.S. is one interesting band and it is even hard to explain why. Maybe it is because their lineup had important members on the local scenario, one of them is not even with us anymore, another still very present in Brasília. On thing that is undeniable is the presence of Simone Death on the line up.\n\nWhat my friends, that lived this period in Brasília, use to tell me is how surprised people became after seeing a girl with an angelical face and very well dressed, playing a brutal music like that. For sure, P.U.S. achieved a notorious visibility in Brazil with three full albums released between 1991 and 1996.\n\nThe band stopped in 1997 and Simone became famous with something without any connection with P.U.S. or Metal music when she was part of a reality show, like Big Brother Brazil, in 2001. Since then, she uses the name Syang and the last time I saw something related to her, was her playing as hired musician in very popular genre in Brazil, similar to country music, that has nothing related to Rock or Heavy Metal. Most of the fans of this kind of style, have no idea about the past of Syang as a Metal Head.\n\nVictor Augusto\n\n‘Luxury’ Official Audio\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/syangoficial/\n\n41 – Marielle Loyola (1966- )\n\nAs I mentioned on my first post about Heavy Metals bands from Brasília, I reversed the chronological order of the bands. I decided to talk about Marielle Loyola just now, because she is probably one of first woman on this Rock/Metal scenario.\n\nBefore Volkana, Marielle was part of bands like Escola de Escândalo and Arte no Escuro on the early eighties. Escola de Escândalo for example, was a Punk Rock band from 1982 that lived among mainstream Brazilian Rock bands coming from Brasília and this Rock period is still very famous until today.\n\nIn 1987, Volkana appeared as an amazing Thrash Metal band and released couple of albums until had a break around the year of 1996. They are still very respected and remembered by most of Brazilian Metalheads. Maybe Volkana is not so active nowadays, but they hit the stage sometimes for revival concerts.\n\nMarielle is still very present on our musical culture but working on one of the most beautiful theatres I’ve ever seen, called Ópera de Arame, in Curitiba (State of Paraná/Brazil). This theatre is surrounded by a beautiful nature, and all made by metal structure, that despite remembers a fragile wire structure, it is actually made by steel tubes, creating a unique architecture. This place use to receive great Rock and Metal bands too.\n\nI do admire the hardworking of all women that are playing nowadays. They all worked hard for it, and I am happy to see more and more girls doing it. But it would be unfair to not highlight the importance of Marielle and all others that I talked about here. For sure, you all did the first steps on this long path in Brazil.\n\nVictor Augusto\n\n‘Darkness’ Official Video\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/marieleloyola\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/marieleloyola/\n\n42 – Voice of Baceprot (Around 2014- )\n\nThis band may not be that well-known, but they are certainly breaking many paradigms and dogmas. So, it’s worth giving some space here to talk about them. As described in the band’s official website bio:\n\nYoung, Indonesian, hijab-wearing, female metal trio Voice Of Baceprot (VOB) first garnered prestigious global media attention when the video of the band, playing their own song “The Enemy Of Earth Is You” both in studio and local stages in Garut stormed the internet in 2017 when they were still in vocational school. Later in that year, the song has been played with a full orchestra (Erwin Gutawa Orchestra) in front of the audience in the capital city of Jakarta.\n\nConsisting of Marsya (vocals and guitar), Widi (bass), and Siti (drums), the trio first met when they were still in Islamic Junior High School (Madrasah Tsanawiyah) students in their hometown of Singajaya, a small village two hours’ drive away from the city of Garut, West Java.\n\nTheir teacher Cep Ersa Ekasusila Satia (aka Abah Erza) who introduced & taught them musical instruments was also the one behind the name “Voice of Baceprot”. The word “Baceprot” comes from the Sundanese language meaning “Noisy”. It was chosen to represent the type of music that they play.\n\nSince their formation, VOB have become a point of discussion for a host of renowned global media, including The New York Times, NPR, BBC, DW, Reuters and The Guardian, featuring them in the pages of their online publication. VOB were recently named by heavy metal and rock magazine Metal Hammer as “the Metal Band the World Needs Right Now”.\n\n‘[Not] Public Property’ Official Video\n\nFacebbok: https://www.facebook.com/voiceofbaceprot\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/voiceofbaceprot/\n\nSite: https://voiceofbaceprot.com/\n\nThe End? We hope not!\n\nClearly this text does not mention all the girls and women who were part of the history of the Rock ‘N Roll and Heavy Metal scene.\n\nNew artists and musicians will certainly appear and make history in the Rock/Metal scene. We hope that we will be able to value and give due credit to these talented women when the time comes. We also hope that we are moving towards a more united and gender-independent scene.\n\nI hope this small tribute is the spark and makes you look for female bands and artists to support, enjoy, sing along to and especially headbang to.\n\nHave fun and Metal up your ears!\n\nPlaylist Spotify:\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist1nd7sKFk7PXMGqq1XgyA59?si=79be2b55850e43b1\n\nDisclaimer: This article is solely the property of Maura B.
