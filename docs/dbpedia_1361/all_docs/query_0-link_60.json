        "text": "It’s been far too long since last I saw Lacuna Coil live, the previous occasion being here in Liverpool when they played (and packed out) the lower floor of Liverpool’s o2 Academy. That show, way back in 2010, was the last time to date they played in our city, and whenever they’ve come around since then their dates tended to coincide or come close to gigs by other bands I’d already booked for. So it was high time I put that right and renew my acquaintance with Cristina Scabbia, Andrea Ferro and the band after all these years. This time around they had as special guests Eluveitie, a band I know about but I am not all that familiar with their material. In fact, I know more about three of their former members (who formed Cellar Darling following their departure from Eluveitie) than I do of this band! So I was also looking forward to seeing this group, but before all of that we had Infected Rain opening proceedings. I’d got to the Ritz earlier than I’d expected to, given the usual traffic nightmares you endure whenever going to Manchester for a gig (this is why it isn’t THAT convenient for us this end of the A580, o gig promoters!) especially midweek. So I was there in time to queue up, get a reasonable spot and see the opening band. So far so good!\n\nInfected Rain are a Moldovan band fronted by the splendidly-named Lena Scissorhands, who bounded onto the stage with her hair in bright orange dreads! They sound not a million miles removed from Lacuna Coil themselves albeit with a more aggressive vocal from Scissorhands herself, and that was enhanced when for one number they actually brought out Coil’s guitarist Didi Cavalotti – the frontwoman explained that they were actually down one member for this tour, as one of the guitarists was forced to sit it out (‘personal reasons’ was all she gave by way of explanation). It didn’t seem to matter as they were suitably heavy and enthusiastic, though I could have done without the call for a pit in the last number – I soon made way! This was the band’s first ever UK show, and although the vocalist admitted that she and the group were nervous (well, she put it rather differently!) they got a good reception from an already healthy crowd.\n\nMy first impression of Eluveitie was that there was a lot of them! The line-up is nine strong, featuring two guitarists, a bassist and a drummer, plus a flautist, a hurdy-gurdy player, a violinist and a harpist who also contributes vocals alongside frontman Chrigel Glanzmann, who takes lead vocal as well as playing bouzouki, additional flute or whatever else happens to be lying about! It was the harpist/singer (Fabienne Erni) who led the way with her voice, before the whole ensemble kicked into opening number ‘Ategnatos’. Despite all the folky instrumentation, make no mistake – this was a Metal band! Glanzmann delivers a typically harsh ‘Metal’ vocal, counterbalanced by Erni’s beautiful voice, though when they kick into gear they can thrash with the best of them! I’ve never seen such instruments used in this style of music before, although this band has been around for over ten years now. They’re all very visual, with guitarists Rafael Salzmann and Jonas Wolf throwing shapes alongside bassist Kay Brem, and Matteo Sisti across the stage often taking a prominent role; not only on flute but bagpipes too!\n\nHurdy-gurdy player Michalina Malisz was a little more reserved; unlike her predecessor (Anna Murphy, now of Cellar Darling) she doesn’t sing too, leaving that role to Fabienne Erni.\n\nThis band were more lively than I’d bargained for, and perhaps I should have cribbed their material before the show rather than watching them ‘cold’ – then again, when it’s a band I know little about, I like to see what they bring to the live situation before checking out their studio work. Eluveitie bring a lot to the table, and their set of around 50 minutes packed a lot in. I’d like to see these again should they come back to this country next year.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about Lacuna Coil when they came on was that they were also down one since last I saw them; in the intervening period they’ve had a few personnel changes. Now they have only one guitarist in the aforementioned Didi Cavalotti, and the drum stool is now occupied by Richard Meiz, who took over this year from Ryan Blake Folden – who himself succeeded Criz Mozatti, the drummer the last time I saw this band. None of this seems to have affected their basic sound, still that alt-metal sound built on syncopated drums with the vocal tag team of Cristina Scabbia and Andrea Ferro still present and correct. Both were wearing hoodies based on the design for current album ‘Black Anima’, while Cavalotti, Meiz and bassist Marco Coti Zelati had their faces painted black and white (you could say KISS-inspired) for the show.\n\nAlthough the set leaned towards the current album and previous one ‘Delirium’, they did delve back through several of their older albums. Scabbia sounded in impeccable voice, one of the best singers in the current scene in my book. She and the band exuded a defiant attitude best illustrated by her speech prior to closer ‘Nothing Stands In Our Way’ – encouraging all present not to let anyone else grind them down whatever their situation. As usual they featured their cover of Depeche Mode’s ‘Enjoy The Silence’, before coming back to play the lighthearted ‘Naughty Christmas’ (that was a BIT naughty, as it was only mid-November, folks!) and the one we were all waiting for, ‘Heaven’s A Lie’.\n\nThis was a fine performance by a band still on top of their game, one of the leading lights of the ‘female fronted’ (not a genre!) scene. I won’t leave it so long before seeing the Italian metallers again, though it’s to be hoped that they do find their way to our end of the M62 again seeing as they’ve done it twice before! 😉\n\nLacuna Coil Facebook page\n\nEluveitie Facebook page\n\nInfected Rain Facebook page\n\nI’ve only ever seen Dutch symphonic metallers Epica once before. That was over ten years ago in London, when they were special guests to Finnish power metal band Sonata Arctica. A lot’s changed since then, and these days the band have former Delain bassist Rob van der Loo in their ranks, alongside original members, guitarist Mark Jansen, keyboardist Coen Janssen (no relation) and longtime vocalist Simone Simons. The line-up is completed now by Isaac Delahaye on lead guitar, who took over from Ad Sluiter in 2009. This is their first run of UK dates in several years, for at least the last two tours if you wanted to see this band it meant either a trip to London or continental Europe, so it was about time I checked this group out again.\n\nThe date clashed with one for The Dead Daisies, playing at the Academy 2 about half a mile down Oxford Road, hence my booking to see that band in Bilston instead of Manchester. Nevertheless I decided to park in my usual spot for the Academy venues and walk up, it isn’t that far (!) On getting to Whitworth Street West it was just about time for the doors to open, and a nice big queue to get in stretched right down to the corner of the street. No chance of getting to the front then, but I wasn’t too worried, knowing the gig was going to be well-attended but not sold out I thought I’d still get a reasonable spot. As it turned out I got to within five off the barrier, albeit over towards house right.\n\nThis was to be a three-band bill, and before long openers Oceans of Slumber came on stage. As is normal I watched this band with absolutely no knowledge of them, although in this case it applied to the headliners too, at least in terms of their material (!) but things didn’t get off to a good start with the band coming on to hardly any stage lights save for the ones behind them, and having a sound mix which put bass above everything else! It was so bad that I could not hear the lead singer (Cammie Gilbert, and yes I googled it!) AT ALL for the first number while that bass rumbled through the floor and through my feet, it almost shook my back teeth out! The mix stayed bad all set, and it completely demolished their performance. Their material comprises long plodding numbers that don’t appear to progress, they don’t go anywhere. In addition, the impression Gilbert gave me was that she didn’t actually look that thrilled to be up there! Towards the end she said ‘We have two more songs for you’, which would have been fine, had I heard any songs up to that point!\n\nNext up were Danish act Myrkur, I know their nationality because a big Denmark flag appeared on the stage as they were setting up! I thought this was a band, but a bit more googling informed me that it is actually the solo project for singer Amalie Bruun, who also plays guitar and keyboards on record. She came on stage in what appeared to be bridal wear, and white face makeup with a large black band across her eyes. Visually striking then, but once again the lighting rendered that ineffective as, save for a spotlight between numbers, she and the band were performing in almost complete darkness. That isn’t ‘atmospheric’, it’s irritating – you want to see the band play. I could make out – just- her bassist doing a bit of a Jimmy Page impression with a bow and that was slightly interesting, but this material (performed in her native language) again did little for me. She does have a fine voice however, but it’s not my cup of blood. The best song played was the closer ‘Villemann & Magnhild’, a traditional folk song performed by just Bruun, beating a large frame drum alongside her regular drummer.\n\nSo after two support acts I didn’t particularly enjoy I was hoping for a good set from the headline band. The stage set looked impressive enough, all the usual hallmarks with raised platforms, lots of lighting (for the first time all night) and even the ‘S’ shaped microphone stand for singer Simone Simons. The set leant heavily on most recent album ‘The Holographic Principle’, opening with ‘Edge Of The Blade’ from that album but they did mix it up so that at least one track from their previous albums were featured. I looked up two numbers in and noticed keyboardist Coen Janssen had moved across the stage complete with his (standing) keyboard – I hadn’t realised he’d got a little rail system to flit from one side of the stage to the other, his keyboard also span around on the stand similar to how Styx’s Lawrence Gowan has his setup. Janssen is a real showman, not content with spinning around he will often jump around the stage with or without his instrument! He also has a curved (presumably MIDI-linked) controller which he straps on during the set, so that he can join the rest of the band at the front of the stage.\n\nThey’re typically ‘Euro-Metal’ in their synchronised headbanging routines. but their musical style is heavier, some songs are lengthy progressive metal workouts while others are shorter. Simons’ operatic vocals are frequently counterbalanced by the growls from guitarist Mark Jansen, and there is plenty of scope for lead guitar shredding courtesy of Isaac Delahaye. I had only a general idea of what to expect rather than a thorough knowledge of their back catalogue, but this was still an enjoyable set. It was a completely different experience to that of the gig I saw a few nights before but one thing they do have in common with The Dead Daisies was that all these players are showmen. Probably the zaniest is Coen Janssen, he does go against the idea that keyboardists have to be stuck in one position all night – and with those spinning keyboards and controllers it’s nice to see what he’s actually doing!\n\nNear the end they were calling for a ‘wall of death’ and a circle pit for the last couple of numbers, sod that thought I and headed for the relative safety of the right hand side! Their music is more conducive to that kind of thing than some other symphonic metal bands around, Epica’s style is kind of a death/progressive/symphonic fusion which does distinguish them from the other European metal bands currently around.\n\nIn conclusion, although the support bands weren’t for me at all, Epica gave a great night of Metal and I shall not leave it another ten years before I see these again.\n\nAnother year, another Delain touring cycle. The Dutch symphonic metallers have put a lot of miles over the past few years, with prestigious support slots with Nightwish in the US as well as headline shows in the UK and Europe. This time around the tour is in support of their recently-released sixth album ‘Moonbathers’ and for their Manchester date they were booked into the 1500-capacity o2 Ritz, a step up from their previous appearances at Club Academy.\n\nWith a club night scheduled to follow this gig, it was quite an early start for the show (a three-band bill); following a meet and greet/acoustic performance by Delain for the small group of fans who took up the VIP package (and got first pick of spot on the all-important barrier) the doors opened and plenty were already in place for openers Kobra and The Lotus. A Canadian quintet fronted by the stunning Kobra Paige, their music is traditional Metal with plenty of fist-pumping and shredding solos courtesy of guitarist Jasio Kulakowski. Paige, a classically trained singer who turned to Metal while still in her teens, demonstrated a strong voice and was pleased at the warm reception from the Manchester crowd.\n\nEvergrey were up next, a Swedish outfit based around vocalist/guitarist Tom S. Englund. Their style of Metal is also old-school with plenty of harmony guitars from Englund and fellow axeman Henrik Danhage, and has more than a little Maiden influence. The quintet had a better sound mix (a little less bass-heavy) for me than the openers and went down well with the crowd, some of whom were clearly there for Evergrey as the band’s name was chanted from pockets of the crowd on the floor. The frontman got a cheer when he mentioned that they’d play ‘In Orbit’ which on record features Nightwish singer Floor Jansen, only for him to dampen it down by adding that he’d have to perform her part as she wasn’t there (!) He then got a boo when he announced to this crowd that he was a Man Utd fan (cue some loud boos emanating from my spot, ahem!); presumably he thought that’d go over better than it actually did! (Not everybody there was from Manchester, Tom – those who were could well have been City fans 😉 ) Football banter aside, they gave a very good set and are worth seeing if they play in your area.\n\nDelain came on at 8:30 sharp with drummer Ruben Israel appearing first to the intro music (‘Monarch’ from the recent ‘Moonbathers’ album), who then started to play along to the intro, joined by guitarist Timo Somers and then the rest of the band. They opened with album lead-off ‘Hands Of Gold’ and were straight into that synchronised headbang routine that has become a familiar sight. Lead singer Charlotte Wessels then made her grand entrance (clad in a glittery 1980s-style outfit complete with shoulder pads) to tremendous cheers. From the off she had the crowd in the palm of her hand, easily getting arms raised, fists pumped and ‘hey, hey!’ chants going. Bassist Otto Schimmelpenninck van der Oije once again handled the ‘growly’ vocal parts on this track and others that called for it, when not doing those he was all over the stage, frequently swapping places with Somers and fellow guitarist Merel Bechtold.\n\nThe set was heavily weighted towards the current album (always a sign that a band really believes in their latest release) with no fewer than seven tracks from it performed. ‘Suckerpunch’ got the crowd chanting along with its ‘whoa, whoa’ hook, and the singer got the crowd clapping along for the first of many times to ‘The Glory And The Scum’. Their older albums were not ignored however; the crowd were encouraged to ‘keep those hands in the air’ for ‘Get The Devil Out of Me’ and ‘Army of Dolls’. They’re also celebrating the tenth anniversary of debut album ‘Lucidity’ this year, that record was acknowledged with ‘Sleepwalkers Dream’, ‘Pristine’ and ‘The Gathering’.\n\n‘The Hurricane’ (from the current album) was as much a highlight of the live set as it was on record, showcasing both Wessels’ sweeter lower range as well as her stronger vocal in the chorus. She delivered it with real passion and power, on that sort of form she’s as capable as a Floor Jansen of tingling the spine. ‘Fire With Fire’ showed how much more they’re now using Timo Somers’ vocal, he possesses a fine voice himself and since the addition of Merel Bechtold, he seems to have been given a little more freedom in both his guitar playing and backing vocal.\n\nIndeed the whole band contributed not just musically but visually too; the focus is inevitably on the singer when it comes to female-fronted bands of this type but from drummer Ruben Israel right through to keyboardist Martijn Westerholt, all were dynamic. Founding member Westerholt is often overlooked, high up on his perch at the back of the stage and stuck behind keyboards, but look up and you’ll often see him headbanging away – all while playing! During ‘Don’t Let Go’ (performed in the encore) everybody was bouncing around the stage (and into each other in the case of Wessels and Somers!) while the crowd also began to jump. The floor of the Ritz is notoriously bouncy and was effectively a trampoline during this number! After the usual closer of ‘We Are The Others’ the band took their bows.\n\nDelain’s popularity is growing each time they come to this country, they drew around twice as many this time as they did a year ago at Academy 2. Before long they’ll be at the same level as a Within Temptation or even Nightwish, just reward for the hard yards they’ve been putting in over the past five years."
