        "meta_description": "In A Reverie by Lacuna Coil, released 13 July 1999\n\n1. Circle\n2. Stately Lover\n3. Honeymoon Suite\n4. My Wings\n5. To Myself I Turned\n6. Cold\n7. Reverie\n8. Veins Of Glass\n9. Falling Again\n\nIn 1998, the Milan based band LACUNA COIL surprised everybody with a self-titled MCD which already gathered a number of positive reactions. On the road with Moonspell and later with The Gathering and Seigmen they managed to convince and fill the audience with enthusiasm about their vivid gothic rock. Especially frontwoman Cristina put a spell not only on the audience with her powerful, but still crystal-clear voice and her charismatic and seductive appearance. Before they were ready to enter Woodhouse studios with Waldemar Sorychta as producer once again they had to face turbulence within their line-up. Fortunately they managed to sort everything out without any bigger problems and even gained strength for their debut-album In A Reverie. LACUNA COIL definitely matured and grew to a solid unity resulting in nine refreshing tracks, which easily find their way into the auditory canals of lovers of bands like HIM and The Gathering. Still, LACUNA COIL stand out from the flood of dark rock and metal acts, particularly with their original way to merge the dueting voices of Cristina and her male counterpart Andrea, whose vigorous voice is not of the usual growling quality but far more rock than metal. Altogether the Milanese have a bit more iron, because the instrumentation tends to be more gothic metal and powerful rock. In A Reverie holds the overwhelming power of the setting sun on the Italian river Po with the cosy but still painful passionate overtones as it’s guide.",
