        "text": "During an interview with the Impact Metal Channel on May 7th in Budapest, Hungary, Lacuna Coil vocalists Cristina Scabbia and Andrea Ferro talked about the band’s upcoming 20th anniversary and revealed they have no immediate plans for a new album, stating fans shouldn’t expect to hear brand new material until 2019. Check out the interview below:\n\nLacuna Coil are celebrating their 20 year anniversary and they have opened another chapter in the relationship between the band and their long-term label: Lacuna Coil have just signed a new deal with Century Media Records.\n\nAntje Lange, General Manager International of Century Media Records: “Century Media Records is very happy that Lacuna Coil have renewed their contract with us and we are very much looking forward to the next albums of this exceptional Italian band. Century Media appreciates the continuous trust of the band. The recent album ’Delirium’ charted in 12 countries and the band is touring around the globe.”\n\nCristina Scabbia, vocals: “I am so excited to have signed with Century Media again. Nowadays it is so important that, whichever label is backing up an artist or a band, one has full trust in the artistic and musical vision. I know Lacuna Coil and Century Media will continue to work hard together to make common goals happen faster and more successfully.”\n\nAndrea Ferro, vocals: “We are really excited about starting this new adventure with Century Media Records, we had some great 20 years together that helped us become an internationally successful band. Like in every relationship there have been ups and downs but overall we’ve worked with some great people always willing to grow up with the band and together we have achieved really amazing goals. Here is to another chapter about to start and more successful stories!”\n\nLacuna Coil have announced that they will be joining Dutch symphonic metal giants Epica on the North American leg of the band’s Ultimate Principal Tour. The month-long September trek marks Lacuna Coil‘s first US tour dates in over a year, as the band continues to support their latest full length studio album, ‘Delirium‘. Joining Lacuna Coil and Epica on the Ultimate Principal Tour are Insomnium and Elantris.\n\nAfter announcing the title of their debut album last week, Cellar Darling, the new band formed by ex-Eluveitie members Anna Murphy, Merlin Sutter and Ivo Henzi, now unveil the artwork for This Is The Sound.\n\nThe mesmerizing cover artwork, created by Christopher Ruef (graphic design) and Manuel Vargas Lépiz (photography) drags you right into Cellar Darling’s mystical world of apocalyptic tales, heavy riffs and a captivating voice, ready to break the chains of your imagination. The band also revealed the full track list of their upcoming album – an astounding 14 original songs amounting to a full hour of music.\n\nThe band states: “The figure of the cover lures you into our world of stories and eclectic music. It’s a preview of the remaining artwork, where each song has it’s own own visual representation and symbol.”\n\nThis Is The Sound will see the light of day on June 30th via Nuclear Blast.\n\nTracklisting:\n\n“Avalanche”\n\n“Black Moon”\n\n“Challenge”\n\n“Hullaballoo”\n\n“Six Days”\n\n“The Hermit”\n\n“Water”\n\n“Fire, Wind & Earth”\n\n“Rebels”\n\n“Under The Oak Tree…”\n\n“…High Above These Crowns”\n\n“Starcrusher”\n\n“Hedonia”\n\n“Redemption”\n\nMore details about their first studio tale will follow shortly and in the meantime you can watch a trailer from the recordings in the New Sound Studio of Pfäffikon:\n\nThe band filmed an entire little studio documentary that will soon be revealed bit by bit on Cellar Darling’s Facebook page and YouTube channel, so stay tuned.\n\nAfter their split with Eluveitie, Anna Murphy, Ivo Henzi and Merlin Sutter quickly realized their musical journey was far from over. What quickly developed was a unique and fresh combination of grand and heavy riffs, powerful drumming and a unique voice along with the signature folky, earthy tones of the hurdy gurdy. This, combined with classical elements as well as inherited folk influences, led to the creation of something entirely new, setting Cellar Darling on the path of musical innovation.\n\nCellar Darling released their first single, “Challenge”, and a bonus song called “Fire, Wind & Earth” in September 2016.
