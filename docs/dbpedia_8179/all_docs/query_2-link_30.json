        "text": "In 1978, actor Christopher Eccleston was inspired to work in TV after watching the BBC Play For Today, The Spongers.\n\nThis was a shattering piece of drama about the impact of welfare cuts. Its devastating ending shocked the viewing public.\n\nChristopher returns to Manchester to discover more about the playwright behind The Spongers - Jim Allen.\n\nJim was a man who \"wrote beautifully about real people's lives\". His many works include Days of Hope, United Kingdom, Raining Stones, Land & Freedom, and the controversial theatre piece, Perdition.\n\nWith contributions from Ken Loach and Jimmy McGovern, we hear about the life of the former docker, miner and labourer, a lifelong passionate Socialist with an acute ear for the rhythms of working class speech.\n\nProducer: Elizabeth Foster\n\nFirst broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in January 2015."
