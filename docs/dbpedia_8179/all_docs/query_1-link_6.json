        "text": "Ken Loach's 1995 epic beautifully walks the line between superb intellectual essay of the Left's betrayal of itself during the Spanish Civil War and a believable humane drama that incorporates such ideology and theory in a manner which engages its audiences hearts as well as minds.\n\nIan Hart plays an unemployed Liverpudlian communist who, in light of Franco's Fascist regime, wants to make a difference for the cause. Arriving in Spain he enlists not with the International Brigade (which international communists would usually serve with) but with the POUM, a quasi Trotskeyite people's militia, after meeting up with some of their comrades. The film is top and tailed by the death of Hart's character as an OAP in a shabby…\n\nA Spanish revolution story depicted through numerous extensive flashbacks as a young woman reads the letters her grandfather wrote while he served in an international platoon of the people's army, POUM. The grandfather, David (Ian Hart) is a young communist from Liverpool who decides to leave for Spain and fight against Franco and the fascists after attending a lecture by a Spanish comrade. Few directors portray complex political history as well as Ken Loach does and since the entire story is seen through flashbacks created by David's letters, Loach can jump through time and pick which events he wants to show, rather than taking on the impossible task of accurately portraying the whole revolution.\n\nThe acting is as realistic as…\n\nLand and Freedom is not just about the Spanish Civil War but the nature of revolution. It depicts failure in the end, following men unable to stop fascism and unable to reach their ideals. Yet for a small time there was a brief liberation. The centrepiece of Land and Freedom is a long scene where villagers debate their future and the sort of community they want to make. This is shown as a victory, as a moment of community and fair self-governance. But it does not last.\n\nLand and Freedom examines the splintering of the European left, the lack of unity despite common goals. What starts as a fight against fascism becomes a fight against each other. All kinds of…\n\nImportant and underrepresented material is clumsily presented. The Spanish Civil War is rarely depicted in cinema, especially in a realist sense. Del Toro brilliantly uses fantasy to reveal reality, The Spirit of the Beehive interlinks with literature to show escape. An unvarnished depiction — one with international reach (I’m sure Spanish domestic cinema has dealt with this, and brilliantly) seems lacking, though, making Land and Freedom a promising proposition.\n\nAnd there is some brilliance here. Though there is an over focus on leftist, or masquerading as leftist, infighting. This is certainly a legitimate and relevant topic, and some scenes — one about what to do about liberated land being the highlight of the film — are excellent. Yet, if the…\n\nI've been trying to track this down for years, more so since I did a mini Ken Loach marathon last year, and within minutes I knew this would not disappoint. Loach's personal politics colour every movie he has made, but normally in a more Left vs. Right or Socialism vs. Capitalism kind of way. However, Land and Freedom is much more concerned with the fractions of the left, and the struggle to not only revolutionize the status quo, but find a balance between the warring ideologies as we go further along the left/liberal side of the political spectrum.\n\nHowever, he also never loses sight that for this to really connect with the viewer there needs to be a personal story…"
