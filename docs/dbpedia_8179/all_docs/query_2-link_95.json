That doesn't happen randomly in the theatre - and it doesn't happen often enough.\" - Washington City Paper\n\n\"Holds such sway and power over the audience that you feel you are basking in the heart and soul of Nijinsky. In less than 90 minutes, you not only forget yourself, you leave yourself.\" - Washington Times\n\nSubsequent productions across the United States, Europe, and South Africa.\n\nAvailable from Playscripts, Inc.\n\nCommissioned and Produced by Signature Theatre (VA)\n\n\"Seduction is as seduction does in Norman Allen's sex-and-crucifixion dramedy In the Garden -- a compelling blend of wit, adultery, and C.S. Lewis-esque philosophizing.\" - Washington City Paper\n\n\"Allen's plays have always included issues of morality but he has never taken on religious spirituality so directly. Here he does so with great skill and great generosity.\" - Arlington Connection\n\n\"In the Garden glows with intelligence.\" - Washington Blade\n\nAvailable from Playscripts, Inc.\n\nScore by Berlin, Cohan, Fleming, etc.\n\nCommissioned and Produced by Signature Theatre (VA)\n\nDirected by Eric Schaeffer\n\n\"A delightfully irreverent take on the Dickens classic... An enormously appealing new musical...just the right touches of sarcasm and gentle humor.\" - Variety\n\n\"A wholly delightful affair with the potential to become a recurring seasonal favorite.\" - The Washington Post\n\n\"The Christmas Carol Rag not only works beautifully, it even improves in several ways upon the original.\" - Cleveland Plain Dealer\n\nAvailable from Playscripts, Inc.\n\n(Other works available from Playscripts include plays for young actors: Jenny Saint Joan and Waiting in Tobolsk: The Children of the Last Tsar.)"
