In 1978, actor Christopher Eccleston was inspired to work in TV after watching the BBC Play For Today, The Spongers.

This was a shattering piece of drama about the impact of welfare cuts. Its devastating ending shocked the viewing public.

Christopher returns to Manchester to discover more about the playwright behind The Spongers - Jim Allen.

Jim was a man who "wrote beautifully about real people's lives". His many works include Days of Hope, United Kingdom, Raining Stones, Land & Freedom, and the controversial theatre piece, Perdition.

With contributions from Ken Loach and Jimmy McGovern, we hear about the life of the former docker, miner and labourer, a lifelong passionate Socialist with an acute ear for the rhythms of working class speech.

Producer: Elizabeth Foster

First broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in January 2015.
