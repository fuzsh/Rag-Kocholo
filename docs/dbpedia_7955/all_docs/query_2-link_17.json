        "text": "“We need more pictures of Spiderman”\n\nHollywood has been making movies for theaters about as long as we’ve been manufacturing automobiles, refrigerators, and cans of soda pop. It’s a very old concept, the idea of going out to see something entertaining and expressive. Before the big screen, we’d watch actors on a stage reading lines and singing songs in frilly shirts or whatever Macbeth wears. Until 1888, when Louie Le Prince made a two second long short called Roundhay Garden Scene, marking the discovery of the motion picture. Hollywood soon followed up in 1910 with the D.W. Griffith production In Old California, starring John Wayne as a Boston pharmacist, making it the first movie ever shot in Los Angeles.\n\nHere, we have the two sides necessary to making a great film: innovation and startup capital\n\nDuring this era, a new kind of camera was invented, and later on, techniques to create a new medium of storytelling that could be written, directed, and distributed. This is where things get tricky. Your average hobbyist can’t just drum up a million dollars to pay for materials and labor on an industry level film. You need someone with money who can organize your project and make it come to life in your standards. Which is where the producer and executives come into play. They’re planning to give you enough money to make the film you want with maybe one or two exceptions. Those exceptions are determined by market research they have quote unquote done to make sure this project will have a great opening weekend. Basically, what I’m saying is that advertising controls the retail value of movies and what kind of movie you can create for a general audience.\n\nDoes this mean money isn’t necessary to make films and that everything I’ve ever seen made by Hollywood is fucking trash?\n\nNo, this does not mean everyone is force fed garbage or that Hollywood hasn’t made some great movies worth watching. It does however, make quite an obstacle as far as creativity goes, as people both need and don’t need to pay attention to these types of standards. They often get in the way of real ingenuity in the art-form, which is why I’m here to talk about remakes, reboots, and sequels. Our traditionalist way of thinking about production and story affects the growth of style and maybe these repeatable qualities can sometimes be a burden to furthering storytelling. By traditionalist, I mean like your grandmother giving you her wedding ring to propose with. Aesthetics, philosophy, themes, and even shot sequences are handed down through the generations by a means of influence. Or in other words, Ingmar Bergman was a lot of people’s big brother.\n\nLet’s get back to the word repeat.\n\nWhen making movies, your story collides with a world of genres, influence, and stylistic philosophy that is hard to wade through. Some of your stories could be influenced by others. It happens, remember that most art is theft by fandom, whether or not it was intentional. What bothers me is the blatant exploitation of such a beautiful part of the art-form like influence, iconoclasm, and familiarity. This damage is done by the studios and what they choose to greenlight based on market interest. What people are interested in right now is a series of things based on trope, or scenarios/gags attached to stories that are commonly used as literary devices or entertainment value. This can be likened to the “Throwback” a hyper-nostalgia aesthetic craze that affected the film and television industry quite a bit. We saw the return of shows like Twin Peaks, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Arrested Development, and the creation of Stranger Things, a hodgepodge show that takes on a very 80’s arcade horror aesthetic despite never existing in that time. In film, we’ve been seeing the extension of franchises like Jurassic World, Alien, and Star Wars. All movies over twenty years old. Not to mention we got a shitty remake of every great horror movie from the 1970’s.\n\nI’m still waiting for a bad update of the Shining.\n\nAnyways, there’s a fine line between making a movie based upon your love of something and literally making the same movie again. I feel like a lot of people agree with me and begin to wonder “Why?” when they see trailers and previews for upcoming remake films. Frankly, its all based upon promotion, or rather how much money studios have to spend on marketing for a particular film. It’s easy and cheap to sell you something you’ve already seen or heard about. Many films don’t get the greenlight for a number of reasons: the amount of money needed for studio rental/gear etc, a really expensive person, object, or soundtrack that would take a lot from the budget, or maybe the director is insane and has a bad track record at the box office.\n\nActually, no, mostly just money. They mostly say no because of money.\n\nFor an executive or studio, their main concern is keeping their jobs and businesses afloat. They need to be certain that when they give you the money for a film, it’s going to be returned at the box office. Which to be clear, is where people go to the theater and pay for a ticket. Most of the time, watching a movie on Netflix, Hulu, or another streaming service benefits a licensing company more than it will benefit a studio or production company as a whole. So they need to make sure your butt is in that seat. One way they do that is by controlling what type of film comes out, because they want to make sure people pay to see the film. Some ideas are good but maybe they won’t apply to a big audience and work better as a nuanced piece. They want to make a smart investment for their audience and sometimes that means we don’t get anything new or nuanced.\n\nWe’ve proven as viewers that we can be sold the same thing again and again. Quite literally, but that doesn’t mean we always hate it. Sometimes we want the same old. After all, I’m just as guilty for liking this stuff as anyone else. So let’s breakdown the three types of projects I’ve mentioned above and see how they affect the flow of discovery and exploration in the filmmaking process.\n\nLet’s start with the remake, the most hated of these three.\n\nRemakes come in all shapes and sizes, just like the movie they were before. Some can even have a different name. However, they are most common in genres like horror, science fiction, action/adventure, kids movies, and comedy. These films have had different levels of production value over the years, causing them to be touched up and re-sold. You see this less with drama and romance films. Those have always made money and won awards. Check out Wikipedia for an extensive list of movies that have been remade. You’d be shocked at what counts. But let’s dig deeper.\n\nWe’ll start by defining a remake as a movie that is deliberately and directly being adapted from another movie in order to exist as a different form of the same movie. This excludes homage and influence. I’m talking about how they made four different versions of Babes in Toyland, each slightly different, but still with the same basic storyline and characters.\n\nThat’s a remake.\n\nThis formula can often be altered slightly, like changing the names of characters, setting, or the title, but still giving them the same plotline in essence. Like how Escape From Witch Mountain was remade with Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson as a young adult action film when it was originally a supernatural kids movie like a spooky version of the Apple Dumpling Gang.\n\nRemakes have been something the movie industry has done for a long time, but the market for them recently has skyrocketed. People have a tendency of falling back on their old favorites and those are the heartstrings directors want to pull. They want to create a new favorite out of an old favorite. Meaning the best kind of marketing is personal investment. Most of the time, I don’t think it works as well. It ends up being a subtle cash grab. Though, some people do remake films for reasons other than money.\n\nMany directors remake films they loved as a kid, John Carpenter’s The Thing, originally called The Thing From Another World does just that. This allows for a touch up and departure, where the new director takes up stylistic freedom. Howard Hawks’ 1951 movie was primarily based on suspense, whereas Carpenter’s version was more of a paranoid action-thriller where they actually showed the monster, something the original was praised for not doing.\n\nEither way, the problem isn’t that John Carpenter’s movie flopped, or that the original is better in any way, it’s that when you go after a beloved piece of history (what movies become) you run the risk of damaging it. Not to say that movies have any certain purity, but they do have a market of people waiting to gobble them up, and if they’re disappointed by a shitty remake, then the future of making movies in that certain way could change. It doesn’t make any sense why a horror movie remake gone wrong would mean no more original horror stories, but sometimes people become less willing to take risks.\n\nPretty much the only time remakes go off without a hitch is in the superhero universe. We’ve already been sold the idea that comics books will jump ahead, start over, and pick up randomly at any given point in the timeline. Different people even portray these superheroes in the actual written canon. So you can change the actors for Batman at a whim. Sometimes it fails, but only if its a bad movie. Which if you ask the right person, there’s a lot of good Batman stories.\n\nMy only beef with remakes is that they feel like a waste of time. Why watch some new bastardized version of someone else’s vision? As a writer, I like to encourage people to try things. I’m also a hedonist who wants more than one type of red wine. Casablanca was a great film but so was Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. You can make more than one great movie about love. After all, art is about vision and most of the time pretending to have someone else’s doesn’t make the art as available to an audience’s human connection. With that in mind, a market of remakes isn’t challenging anything or making that movie new or exciting for anyone.\n\nIt’s also not injecting any new art or theme into cinema. As the world changes, different things become available to us emotionally. We have new thoughts, issues, and lifestyles. Those things without comment are not being captured or represented. Makes sense why people freak out at the idea of their favorite movie being destroyed. So while I do see the appeal of remakes, for the sake of making a bad movie good, or to try your hand at a beloved classic, it’s not doing you any favors. You’re not your favorite director. So why not just be the director you are. At the end of a remake, you’re likely just gonna have a slightly underwhelmed audience and that’s gonna sting.\n\nSo let’s move on to a slightly different version of a remake, the television reboot.\n\nThis one is a little bit different, as reboots also come in many forms. It can be a reunion episode, a new season after many years, or simply a foreign show adapted for the US audience. Television doesn’t have the worldly reach that American movies have. Most networks are condensed and the marketing approach is very different. Especially in different countries. This is why we get some foreign shows and not others, and vice versa. American television has adapted many foreign TV shows from places like Japan and the UK to present them as a brand new series like the Office, Skins, and many different cartoons. They can do this because of licensing. And sometimes they make more money than the original. The Office, created by Ricky Gervais for a UK series, was adapted by Greg Daniels (King of the Hill) into a brand new show with different characters for American TV and is now one of the most watched comedy series’ of all time thanks to Netflix and NBC. Totally counts as a reboot. However, in this case, it’s very different from the original and you can watch both without them ruining one another. Gervais even makes a cameo in the US version. So that’s pretty interesting. On the other end, Hawaii 5–0 has a reboot series minus Tom Selleck and instead chose to replace the whole cast with newer, younger actors playing the same characters. Despite being back for almost ten seasons, the ratings are that of a mediocre crime procedural series and it’s lost it’s nostalgia magic. Recasting in most genres of television and film (superhero & soap opera excluded) also tends to diminish the characters’ overall power with the audience and throws the show into a less admirable position due to unfamiliarity and dysphoria. Ineffective reboots tend to fall into the same camp as remakes, the word of mouth and cultural promotion does most of the work marketing popular shows coming back except when they get cancelled, few people seldom remember because nobody was watching. So overall, there’s less damage being done when a network slaps together a reboot. That’s okay, though. There’s still a lot of the old show to go back and re-watch if you’re ever feeling show-sick.\n\nAs far as reunions go, they work out a little less well. Unless of course, a whole new season is being made.\n\nWe’ve seen the casts of Seinfeld, Friends, and other popular shows from the past reunite on newer series’ to kind of “stand next to each other” and while it’s cool for a moment, it doesn’t typically make great television and feels like a novelty. Kind of like how hanging out with your friends from elementary school doesn’t really do it for you anymore. You’ve grown and become a different person to the point where this old version of you is unrecognizable. This is why reunions work best in a season format. Shows that come back for a reunion season rather than an episode kind of capture the old magic of a show by extending the canon. It may be different, as the actors have aged, but usually I find that the level of interest I have for the show remains the same. Curb Your Enthusiasm’s new season was fantastic and in some ways better than some of the earlier ones, and its because Larry David didn’t change the arc of the show at all. He kept the canon on track, let everything fall back into place and it worked. Which is great news for fans, but not every series gets a reunion season that well-off. Arrested Development for example, came back after a multiple year hiatus thanks to Netflix, who probably noticed the show was some great binge-worthy material. Each episode in the 4th season centered around a member of the Bluth family and what they’ve been doing since the show was cancelled (with any plotholes to be filled in during a later episode). This proved to be a problem as fans had become accustomed to watching the show a certain way chronologically. Mitch Hurwitz himself, the creator of the show, actually had to re-cut the entire season because he found it unwatchable in this new format and admitted he may have made a mistake. Thank god.\n\nOverall, it’s safer to do a reunion than a reboot, its like coming home at the end of a long day (that and fans get less angry at the complete reconstruction of a show).\n\nNow let’s get to the sequel, the second most offensive of these three.\n\nSequels always ride the line between good and bad because it both delights fans to know there’s more to the story of their favorite movie and angers curmudgeons who see the difference between a cash ploy and a return to form. In my lifetime, I have been both and often still root for certain sequels. This all comes down to the fact that we are regimented to a new style of watching television and movies that thrives from excess of a particular canon. Sitcoms & serials have become king once again as the number of episodes (amount of programming) are subsequently higher than a one-off movie or drama series, making it a better joyride for a fan. Superhero movies thrive off a similar platform in present day as the Avengers series is reaching their fourth installment featuring this generation’s actors. So, if we love stories, and characters, and never want them to die, how do we determine whether or not a sequel is worth our time and does it make it better than a remake?\n\nMy answer is a resounding “both” as some movies deserve a sequel and some sequels are the same movie in essence as their predecessor, walking a weird path between remake and continuation of the story arc. Let’s take a look at some popular movies who have gotten sequels due to the success of the original.\n\nWell start with an all time smash-hit like Star Wars. This series has been picked up a few times now simply due to the fact that it’s a fan-favorite. People buy the tickets, the toys, and the DVD’s every single time. George Lucas and others involved with the series have even been blamed by their core audience for their lack of consideration when making sequels (and prequels) to what is known as the original trilogy of these movies. However, let’s not forget that the original series of Star Wars has two sequels tying the whole plotline together, making one fantastical journey across the films.\n\nThe first sequel, Empire Strikes Back, extends the original story and provides the ultimate set-up to the third movie, Return of the Jedi, where the good guys go home and everyone wins a medal. This takes pressure off finding a finite ending to a great movie and allows some wiggle room to build a universe. Some people even consider Empire a better movie than A New Hope because it steps away from the traditional arc of the Hero’s journey in order to make a film about growth and knowledge being the true form of power. Either way, it’s great to see Luke and his friends struggle for a minute before the ultimate payoff. If they had chosen to make Return of the Jedi immediately after A New Hope, it would have nearly the same plotline as the original movie and would take anyway any romantic suspense we might have had for the storyline and characters. They also would have to pick a different name. Empire not only acts as a buffer but as a reminder to take the long road in order to maximize the story for the viewer without taking away any power it has behind it. Your fans ultimately will be happier.\n\nNow let’s go in the other direction with Harold and Kumar.\n\nThis series is a delight to watch as you pretty much know what to expect the whole time. Harold and his goofy friend Kumar get extremely baked and go on a nonsensical journey where they manage to run into Neil Patrick Harris, and get even higher until their hijinks get them into serious trouble. These movies are similar to others like the Hangover, where the serial-ability makes them desirable. You can essentially watch all of them and find them about as funny as the others. Only thing is, you can get tired of them mighty quick due to the fact that each plot arc is very similar to the other with a minor change in setting.\n\nIn the first movie you might find Harold and Kumar on their way to White Castle, but in the sequel, they are attempting to escape from Guantanamo Bay prison. While the setting and set-up may be different, it’s basically the same movie (complete with NPH’s cameo). This means all of the possibility for the series is contained within the original story, which proposes a problem for potentially bored fans down the line. I’d also argue that most stories get played out after a few movies no matter what, so it’s really up to the fans who payed for and loved the sequels to determine what they like about the series to begin with.\n\nOkay, that’s enough jibber-jabber. Say something profound to end it!\n\nSure, alright, now that we’ve covered everything these three types of movies have to offer, I’ll leave you with this. Our writing and storytelling ultimately deserves the respect of present-day themes as much as we give into the sentimental views of our past. Writing this article, I learned that regression can be battled only with trust and vision. Maybe the movie industry will consider doing the same thing to keep cinema alive."
