        "text": "Well, I thought that I’d talk about remakes today. This is mostly because, the night before I wrote this article, I finally got round to watching Tom Savini’s 1990 remake of George Romero’s classic 1968 zombie film “Night Of The Living Dead” (MAJOR SPOILERS ahead for both films) and it was a better film than I’d expected.\n\nNot only do some parts of it seem to have been an influence on the very first “Resident Evil” videogame (in terms of atmosphere, scares, location design etc…) but it also manages to keep a lot of the tense small-scale suspense of the original film whilst also adding some faster-paced action-thriller elements too. Not only that, it manages to actually be vaguely scary at times too. Although it would be heretical to say that it was better than Romero’s original, it is still a much better film than I’d expected it to be.\n\nOf course, like any remake, it changes quite a few things – whilst some changes don’t work that well and I have mixed feelings about the different ending, many of the changes work surprisingly well. Whether it was the increased gruesomeness, the film’s extra thriller elements, the extra character development for Barbara, the decision to use “modern” colour film (whilst still giving everything a vaguely “retro” look) etc… A lot of the changes work surprisingly well.\n\nSo, I thought that I’d talk about three of the main reasons why changes in remakes can actually be a good thing sometimes.\n\nFirstly, changes keep things unpredictable for fans of the original. When I watched the remake of “Night Of The Living Dead”, I already sort of knew how at least two or three scenes were going to play out. And, although these scenes still basically did the same thing, there were enough differences to surprise me. Yes, a few of the changes are slightly less dramatic or horrifying than the original – but the changes were still enough to make the film feel more unpredictable than I’d expected and were still in keeping with the spirit of the original film too.\n\nThis latter point is important to remember. These types of changes in a moderately “faithful” remake only really work when whoever is remaking something either has a good reason for them and/or understands why the original did things the way it did.\n\nFor example, although I was disappointed to see that the original film’s unforgettably horrifying “trowel” scene was reduced to a brief visual reference and an “ordinary” zombie bite in Savini’s remake, I could at least accept the change because Savini was trying to be consistent with all of the zombie movies that have followed the original “Night Of The Living Dead” (eg: since this was the first modern-style zombie movie, Romero was still working out the “rules” of the genre at the time). Likewise, the reference also reassures the audience that Savini has actually watched the original film too. So, yes, “surprising” changes can work well if there’s a good reason for them.\n\nSecondly, a remake will often be made in a different context to the original, so changes can help to make the remake seem more relevant. For example, Romero’s original 1968 film was a mildly topical film that subtly criticised both the brutality of the Vietnam war and racism in 1960s America.\n\nOf course, in 1990, the Vietnam war was over and, whilst racism was still present in the US in 1990, there had been at least some progress in terms of reducing it when compared to the late 1960s. So, to make a relevant point that wouldn’t require younger viewers to read a history textbook, the remake distils the original film’s themes into a more timeless “humans can be monsters too” theme instead. And it sort of works.\n\nYes, it means that the remake sacrifices one of the most shocking moments of the original (eg: in the remake, Ben turns into a zombie before he is shot by the rural mob) but the altered ending has aged slightly better for the simple reason that it goes for a more “timeless” point that is as relevant today as it was in 1990. Likewise, the different historical context also means that some of the characters can also be a bit more well-written too – with the remake’s version of Barbara getting more character development and a “grittier and edgier” 1990s-style character arc that is eerily prescient of the version of Sarah Connor that appears in James Cameron’s 1991 film “Terminator 2: Judgement Day”.\n\nFinally, a good remake can also be a bit like a “cover version” of a song. In other words, the new writer or director might decide to add some of their own creativity and personality to it. When done well, this results in something that is both familiar and fascinatingly new at the same time. The classic musical example of a creative cover version is probably Jimi Hendrix’s cover version of Bob Dylan’s “All Along The Watchtower”.\n\nInstead of just copying Dylan’s brilliantly haunting and atmospheric minimalist folk song, Hendrix added his own style to it and turned it into a jaw-droppingly majestic masterpiece of guitar solo-filled rock music instead (which has either directly or indirectly had an influence on every rock and metal musician since). This is pretty much the perfect example of someone adding their own style and creativity to a remake in order to produce something that is as good as – or even better than – the original.\n\nAnother good cinematic example of a director adding their own creativity to a remake is probably Luca Guadagnino’s 2018 remake of Dario Argento’s 1977 horror classic “Suspiria“.\n\nAlthough the remake ditches the cool visual style that made the original film such an amazing-looking work of art, the remake’s gloomier and more muted palette is a perfect fit for the style of film that Guadagnino is trying to make (where there’s more of a focus on subtle creeping unease than on sudden “shock” moments). Likwise, by being bold enough to make major changes to both the characters and story, Guadagnino drastically improves both things in a way that he probably couldn’t have done if he tried to be “accurate” to the original.\n\nSo, yes, the changes in remakes can – when done well by someone who knows what they are doing and has a unique “style” – result in a much more creative and interesting remake than an “accurate” remake could ever be.\n\n—————\n\nAnyway, I hope that this was interesting 🙂"
