        "text": "For centuries, Asian film culture has been rising in popularity with its unique stories, it’s amazing showcasing of new and expressive worlds that highlight eastern culture, and their introduction to talents from the other side of the world that rarely show up on our screens. Asian film media thrives off of various stories that range from innocent and whimsical with its colorful animated features to their darker and mature bold themes of interesting scenarios that can happen in animation or in real life. It also showcases the diverse amount of talent that the eastern side of the world offers, from talented voice actors to amazing and emotional performances by Asia’s best actors/actresses. There is an undeniable sense that these individuals earn the roles that they get.\n\nHowever, the Western side of the world has had a habit of turning these films into critically scolded versions of them, mainly with their own spins on remakes of these movies. Primary examples of this come from western film adaptations of popular Japanese animated series such as Death Note, Dragon Ball Z, Avatar The Last Air Bender, and more. These films would constantly receive critique for failing to capture the same concepts and worlds that the original movies/series had. If not that, then others would complain that Western filmmakers changed tons of dialogue that turns the important characters into blanded out generalized characters that don’t carry the same weight as the original cast would have. Finally, the main critique is that the history of America’s Hollywood using white characters to portray an Asian setting and Asian characters was something that people feel only worsens the quality of the movie. While anyone can portray a character and respectfully do their best, America has had a long history of attempting to “White-wash” these Asian films into a westernized version of them. A huge example is with the 2017 remake of Ghost In The Shell. It outraged people to see the role of the Major, the main protagonist of the film, being played by American actress Scarlett Johansson. It didn’t give fans the justice that they felt they deserved, and many agreed that an Asian actress should have been the one to properly play the part as Major. Luckily, change is shining throughout the world of Hollywood. As more people questioned why they never got to see a diverse cast in their favorite movies, companies to this to their films and began creating new films that would not only have a diverse cast, but would lead and star new characters of many races.\n\nUnfortunately, another problem regarding Asian films may be on the rise of Western film’s additional issue with remaking an entire film for its own audience. The problem arose when controversy was seen about the massive success of Korean director Bong-Joon Ho’s film Parasite. It was known as one of the best movies of its year and won several International film awards for it. However, it wasn’t until it won Best Film at the American Oscars, making it the first non-American film to do so, that people had a problem about where it came from. First, the COVID-19 related jokes about how Asian people were not to be trusted during the midst of the pandemic, then the jabs at how English-speaking viewers wouldn’t enjoy it as much as Koreans because it’s “too hard to understand” (even though subtitles have been a thing forever.) Finally, it came full circle when ex-President of the United States, Donald Trump, shared a few words about the Oscar win. He stated, “How bad were the Academy Awards this year, did you see? ‘And the winner is … a movie from South Korea … What the hell was that all about? We’ve got enough problems with South Korea with trade, on top of it they give them the best movie of the year?” He also mentioned how he wished for classic American movies such as Gone With the Wind to be the winners. However, all hell broke loose when an American remake of the acclaimed Korean movie Train To Busan was announced for the future. Most fans went crazy over how they would manage to grasp the same characters, story, and centric ideas that the original film captured perfectly, social media also showed outrage as it seemed that it was another one of Hollywood’s attempts to turn a popular Asian film into a mediocre version for western fans.\n\nSo what are American audiences’ reasons they can’t enjoy and/or appreciate Asian films the way they do for western films? It seems there are three points as to why they feel they can’t truly appreciate these films:\n\n“I can’t understand what they’re saying.”\n\n“Subtitles are annoying. Why would I want to read the whole movie?”\n\n“They don’t compare to the classics over here.”\n\nHopefully, the outrage that came from fans of the Train To Busan, the change of diversity within western media, and the increase of interest that is coming from all around the world teaches us a lesson about how Asian films can give us a new perspective of worlds to see and the amazing talent that is showcased from within the films themselves.\n\nDiscussion Questions"
