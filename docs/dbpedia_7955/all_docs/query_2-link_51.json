        "text": "Second time’s the harm for these Rotten remakes, with each critically-trashed film here scored well below 30% on the Tomatometer. It’s probably no surprise there’s plenty of horror remakes on here (especially during those flare-ups when Hollywood would plunder overseas for material to adapt for American audiences) but since we’ve already got a worst horror movies list, let’s focus on the remakes that made critics scream without the tacky jump scares. Die Hard director John McTiernan virtually killed his career with the Rollerball reboot, and love made Guy Ritchie do some screwy things, like putting Madonna in Swept Away. Nicolas Cage double-dipped with Bangkok Dangerous and The Wicker Man, putting his image in a tail-spin until his rehabilitation in recent years. Tom Cruise proved he CAN’T do it all with The Mummy, immediately unravelling the Dark Universe. And the FBI may pay you to surf, but they’re certainly not wasting taxpayer dollars on a decent action flick in Point Break.\n\nAs for comedies, the search is on for laughs with The Pink Panther in the Inspector Clouseau role. The Women and Yours, Mine & Ours tried updating some classic comedies of decades past, while Taxi didn’t even work just a few years after the French original came out. Now, see the full list to our guide of the worst-reviewed movie remakes of all time. —Alex Vo\n\n#1\n\nOne Missed Call (2008) 0%\n\n#1\n\nAdjusted Score: 2603%\n\nCritics Consensus: One of the weakest entries in the J-horror remake sweepstakes, One Missed Call is undone by bland performances and shopworn shocks.\n\nSynopsis: When Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon) witnesses the deaths of two friends, she knows there is more at work than just...

[More]\n\nDirected By: Rupert Wainwright\n\n#7\n\nJacob's Ladder (2019) 4%\n\n#7\n\nAdjusted Score: 4336%\n\nCritics Consensus: A needless remake that quickly loses sight of the themes that elevated the original, this is a Jacob's Ladder that leads straight to nowhere.\n\nSynopsis: After losing his brother in combat, Jacob Singer returns home from Afghanistan -- only to be pulled into a mind-twisting... [More]\n\nDirected By: David M. Rosenthal\n\n#8\n\nSwept Away (2002) 6%\n\n#8\n\nAdjusted Score: 8036%\n\nCritics Consensus: Muddled and lacking the political context of the original, Swept Away offers further proof that Madonna can't act.\n\nSynopsis: Imagine being shipwrecked on a beautiful island -- with someone you really can't stand.

[More]\n\n#12\n\nWhen a Stranger Calls (2006) 9%\n\n#12\n\nAdjusted Score: 12167%\n\nCritics Consensus: When a Stranger Calls ranks among the more misguided remakes in horror history, offering little more than a rote, largely fright-free update to the original.\n\nSynopsis: Far away from the site of a gruesome murder, a teenager named Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) arrives at a luxurious... [More]\n\nDirected By: Simon West\n\n#13\n\nShutter (2008) 11%\n\n#13\n\nAdjusted Score: 12972%\n\nCritics Consensus: Being a remake of a Thai horror film instead of Japanese doesn't prevent Shutter from being another lame Asian horror remake.\n\nSynopsis: Photographer Ben (Joshua Jackson) and his new bride, Jane (Rachael Taylor), turn their honeymoon into a working vacation when he... [More]\n\nDirected By: Masayuki Ochiai\n\n#14\n\nMartyrs (2015) 9%\n\n#14\n\nAdjusted Score: 9724%\n\nCritics Consensus: Martyrs flays off everything that gave the original its icy horrific beauty, leaving us an empty, pointless remake.\n\nSynopsis: With help from a friend (Bailey Noble), a tormented woman (Troian Bellisario) tracks down the family that imprisoned and tortured...

[More]\n\nDirected By: Stephen Kay\n\n#18\n\n#18\n\nAdjusted Score: 21265%\n\nCritics Consensus: Visually faithful but lacking the depth and subversive twists that made the original so memorable, the Nightmare on Elm Street remake lives up to its title in the worst possible way.\n\nSynopsis: Teenagers Nancy, Quentin, Kris, Jesse and Dean are all neighborhood friends who begin having the same dream of a horribly...

[More]\n\nDirected By: Diane English\n\n#20\n\nRed Dawn (2012) 15%\n\n#20\n\nAdjusted Score: 21423%\n\nCritics Consensus: The rebooted Red Dawn lacks the original's topicality, but at least pays tribute in delivering the same short shrift to character development and general logic.\n\nSynopsis: When North Korean troops invade U.S. soil and take over the city of Spokane, Wash., a recently returned Iraq War... [More]\n\nDirected By: Dan Bradley\n\n#21\n\nBlack Christmas (2006) 14%\n\n#21\n\nAdjusted Score: 15977%\n\nCritics Consensus: A gratuitous remake of the 1974 slasher, Black Christmas pumps out the gore and blood with zero creativity, humor, or visual flair.\n\nSynopsis: The holiday season turns deadly for a group of sorority sisters (Katie Cassidy, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Lacey Chabert, Michelle Trachtenberg)... [More]\n\nDirected By: Glen Morgan\n\n#22\n\nThe Mummy (2017) 15%\n\n#22\n\nAdjusted Score: 32519%\n\nCritics Consensus: Lacking the campy fun of the franchise's most recent entries and failing to deliver many monster-movie thrills, The Mummy suggests a speedy unraveling for the Dark Universe.\n\nSynopsis: Nick Morton is a soldier of fortune who plunders ancient sites for timeless artifacts and sells them to the highest...
