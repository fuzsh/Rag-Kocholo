Abstract:

This project details the ways in which the classic slasher films of the 1970s, and their post-9/11 remakes, are representative of the individual and complex world views out of which each set of films were borne. The remakes manipulate gender roles including those of the Final Girl and the mother; genre conventions, including increases in domestic melodrama and pathos; production models, including the use of star actors, directors, and producers; sexuality and presentation of the sexualized female body; and race, especially in fine differences between white and non-white characters. In doing so, the post-9/11 films reveal a conservative cultural climate that strives to show recovery of the nuclear family unit after trauma, unlike the originals which are more nihilistic in tone and portray families as either absent or deeply flawed and unrecoverable.

Abstract:

This master’s thesis studies the violence in American cinema. The study is relevant, as it seems that more and more focus is given to the violence found in the arts. Furthermore, it seems that there is a general idea that films are becoming more violent. The thesis first investigates the history of American cinema from the late 1800s to the present while analyzing how violence has been depicted and filmed. The thesis also considers how violence in film has been moderated, for example, by the Production Code. The first part of the thesis focuses on the four eras of Hollywood and discovers that violence has been a part of film since the first films were made. In fact, the first films were focused on violence. The thesis further elaborates how violence has been regulated, and how the depiction of violence has evolved during the hundred years of cinema. The evolution is further investigated in the second part of the thesis, which provides analyses of eleven American films and film remakes. The analyses form a comparison where the remake is compared and contrasted to the original. The purpose of the comparison is to discern how depictions of violence have changed as special effects have evolved and as the various regulations have changed. The films analyzed are Psycho (1960) and Psycho (1998); The Thing From Another World (1951), The Thing (1982) and The Thing (2011); Evil Dead 2 (1987) and Evil Dead (2013); RoboCop (1987) and RoboCop (2014); Total Recall (1990) and Total Recall (2012). The analyses could not show a clear trend toward more violent films as the level of violence found in the analyzed films had only increased slightly, remained the same, or lessened. RoboCop and Total Recall both show that the violence has in fact been reduced as the films were intended for broader audiences

Tämän pro gradu -tutkielman aiheena on amerikkalainen elokuva ja siinä esiintyvä väkivalta. Tutkielma on ajankohtainen, sillä yhä enemmän huomiota kiinnitetään taiteissa esiintyvään väkivaltaan. Sen lisäksi vaikuttaa siltä, että vallalla on yleinen käsitys elokuvien lisääntyvästä väkivallasta. Ensiksi tutkielma käsittelee amerikkalaisen elokuvan historiaa 1800-luvun lopulta aina tähän päivään saakka samalla analysoiden, miten väkivaltaa on kuvattu ja esitetty elokuvissa. Tutkielmassa otetaan huomioon myös eri tavat, joilla elokuvaa on säädelty (esimerkiksi Tuotantokoodi). Tutkielman ensimmäinen osa kattaa amerikkalaisen elokuvan historian ja jakaa sen neljään periodiin. Löydöksenä on, että väkivalta on ollut osa elokuvaa sen syntyajoista lähtien ja itse asiassa ensimmäiset elokuvat pohjautuivat väkivaltaan. Tutkielma myös selventää miten elokuvan väkivaltaa on säädelty ja miten väkivallan esittäminen on kehittynyt elokuvan satavuotisen historian aikana. Tätä kehitystä tutkitaan lisää tutkielman toisessa osassa, joka keskittyy 11 amerikkalaisen elokuvan sekä uusintaversion analysointiin. Elokuvien uusintaversioita verrataan alkuperäisiin elokuviin. Vertailun tarkoituksena on selvittää miten väkivallan esittäminen on muuttunut erikoistehosteiden sekä eri säädösten muuttuessa. Analysoitavat elokuvat ovat: Psycho (1960) ja Psycho (1998), The Thing From Another World (1951), The Thing (1982) ja The Thing (2011), Evil Dead 2 (1987) ja Evil Dead (2013), RoboCop (1987) ja RoboCop (2014) sekä Total Recall (1990) ja Total Recall (2012). Analyysit eivät voineet osoittaa selvää linjaa elokuvien väkivaltaistumisen puolesta, vaan elokuvien väkivalta analysoitujen elokuvien osalta näytti vain hieman lisääntyneen, pysyneen ennallaan tai jopa vähentyneen. RoboCop ja Total Recall -elokuvien analyysit näyttävät miten väkivaltaa on vähennetty, koska elokuvat on tarkoitettu laajemmalle yleisölle

Abstract:

In the eyes of Hollywood producers, film remakes are popular endeavors to undertake. Part of the logic behind remakes is that they will likely perform successfully in the domestic box office because of the tried-and-tested formula that was the remake’s source material as well as the pre-existing fanbase. In addition, over the past two decades the international box office, particularly countries like China and Russia, are overtaking the United States in generating box office revenue. Hence, with the increasing popularity of producing remakes, as well as the growing significance of foreign markets for the entertainment industry, I test whether the international share of the box office is higher for remakes compared to other types of films. I control for several standard variables including type of film, genre, production budget, critical review score, recency of film, and number of installments in the film franchise. In conclusion, I find that although film remakes do not achieve significantly higher foreign box office shares, factors like sequel films, the horror genre, production budget and critical review scores play a significantly positive role in determining foreign box office share, thus indicating the preferences of foreign film audiences.

Abstract:

This thesis offers an analysis of the British marketing and reviewing of three films from the 1970s which have been seen as controversial, through to their most recent DVD releases, as well as their more recent remakes, in relation to the changing public construction of cultural taste. The films are Straw Dogs (Peckinpah, 1971/Lurie, 2011), Last House on the Left (Craven, 1972/Iliadis, 2009) and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (Hooper, 1974)/The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Nispel, 2003). The methodological design of the thesis is based firmly in traditions of historical reception studies, following Barbara Klinger (1994), Janet Staiger (1992, 2000) and Kate Egan (2007), and employs methods of analysis primarily drawn from Lisa Kernan (2004) and Martin Barker and Kate Brooks (1998). By employing a historical reception studies approach to the material, the thesis resists the tendency to treat film remakes as inherently 'inferior' to authentic originals. The public construction of taste in relation to these films is figured in relation to Pierre Bourdieu's concepts of cultural capital, cultural distinction, and developments of these, such as Sarah Thornton's notion of subcultural capital (1995). Through such an analysis a discrepancy emerges between the two sorts of material under scrutiny, whereby a sense of 'the generic' is figured as either positive in marketing or negative in reviewing, suggesting difference conceptions of an imagined audience. Overwhelmingly, the remakes are positioned negatively by critics in relation to the original films and these negative appraisals are often asserted through the discourses which have rehabilitated the original films from their own negative reception during the 1970s and 1980s.

Abstract:

Kazuo Ishiguro's novels The Remains of the Day and Never Let Me Go exhibit many of the same characteristics as his other works. Out of all of those works, however, only these two novels have been adapted to film as of yet. Because of Ishiguro's reliance on first-person narration and point-of-view his novels are particularly more problematic to adapt to screen. This phenomenon is partially due to the audio-visually dependent medium of film and the camera lens' limitations when it comes to exhibiting character interiority. Therefore, the effect of the translation to screen for both of these films is a shift in how the viewing audience responds to the characters as both characters and as human beings. This shift at times augments, expands, or changes the philosophical implications of Ishiguro's works. This paper explores those shifts and permutations and argues that they can ultimately lead to a more empathetic connection between the viewer and the characters in the stories.

Abstract:

The thesis is an examination of how Japanese popular culture products are remade (rimeiku). Adaptation of manga, anime and television drama, from one format to another, frequently occurs within Japan. The rights to these stories and texts are traded in South Korea and Taiwan. The ‘spin-off’ products form part of the Japanese content industry. When products are distributed and remade across geographical boundaries, they have a multi-dimensional aspect and potentially contribute to an evolving cultural re-engagement between Japan and East Asia. The case studies are the television dramas Akai Giwaku and Winter Sonata and two manga, Hana yori Dango and Janguru Taitei. Except for the television drama Winter Sonata these texts originated in Japan. Each study shows how remaking occurs across geographical borders. The study argues that Japan has been slow to recognise the value of its popular culture through regional and international media trade. Japan is now taking steps to remedy this strategic shortfall to enable the long-term viability of the Japanese content industry. The study includes an examination of how remaking raises legal issues in the appropriation of media content. Unauthorised copying and piracy contributes to loss of financial value. To place the three Japanese cultural products into a historical context, the thesis includes an overview of Japanese copying culture from its early origins through to the present day. The thesis also discusses the Meiji restoration and the post-World War II restructuring that resulted in Japan becoming a regional media powerhouse. The localisation of Japanese media content in South Korea and Taiwan also brings with it significant cultural influences, which may be regarded as contributing to a better understanding of East Asian society in line with the idea of regional ‘harmony’. The study argues that the commercial success of Japanese products beyond Japan is governed by perceptions of the quality of the story and by the cultural frames of the target audience. The thesis draws on audience research to illustrate the loss or reinforcement of national identity as a consequence of cross-cultural trade. The thesis also examines the contribution to Japanese ‘soft power’ (Nye, 2004, p. x). The study concludes with recommendations for the sustainability of the Japanese media industry.
