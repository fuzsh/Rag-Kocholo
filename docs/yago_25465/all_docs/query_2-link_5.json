        "text": "by Scott Mehl © Unofficial Royalty 2017\n\nOn Thursday, June 15, 1905, Prince Gustav Adolf of Sweden, the future King Gustav VI Adolf of Sweden, and Princess Margaret of Connaught were married at St. George’s Chapel, Windsor.\n\nGustaf Adolf’s Early Life\n\nGustaf Adolf of Sweden (Oscar Fredrik Wilhelm Olaf Gustaf Adolf) was born on November 11, 1882, at the Royal Palace in Stockholm. At birth, he was created Duke of Skåne by his grandfather King Oscar II. He was the eldest of three sons of the future King Gustav V and Victoria of Baden. Along with his two brothers – Prince Wilhelm and Prince Erik – Gustaf Adolf began his education at home, with a governess and then with tutors. In 1901, he began his formal education, studying history, economics, political science, and archeology at Uppsala University. He also received military training at the Military Academy Karlberg, becoming an officer in the Swedish Army. He would eventually rise to the rank of Lieutenant-General.\n\nIn 1907, Gustaf Adolf became Crown Prince upon his father’s accession to the Swedish throne. He would hold this title for nearly 43 years before becoming King of Sweden in 1950.\n\nFor more information about Gustaf Adolf see:\n\nUnofficial Royalty: King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden\n\nMargaret’s Early Life\n\nPrincess Margaret Victoria Charlotte Augusta Norah of Connaught (known in the family as Daisy) was born at Bagshot Park, Windsor, on January 15, 1882, the eldest of three children of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn and Princess Luise Margarete of Prussia. Her godparents included her grandmother, Queen Victoria and the German Emperor Wilhelm I.\n\nMargaret and her siblings were raised at Bagshot Park and Clarence House, her family’s home in London, and were educated privately at home. As a member of the British Royal Family, she often took part in family functions and events and served as a bridesmaid (along with her sister) at the wedding of the future King George V and Queen Mary in 1893.\n\nSadly, Margaret died before her husband became King of Sweden. She was eight months pregnant with her sixth child in 1920 when she underwent mastoid surgery. An infection set in, killing Margaret, at the age of 38, and her unborn child.\n\nFor more information about Margaret see:\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Princess Margaret of Connaught\n\nThe Engagement\n\nMargaret and her sister, Patricia, were considered two of the most eligible princesses in Europe, and their parents set out to find suitable royal husbands. After visiting the court of King Carlos of Portugal, the family traveled to Cairo to attend a birthday banquet for Khedive Abbas Hilmi Pasha of Egypt in January 1905. Also invited was Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden, who had been visiting his mother, Queen Victoria of Sweden, at her home in Capri. The couple met and were instantly smitten. Ironically, it was Margaret’s sister Patricia who had been rumored as a possible bride for Gustaf Adolf, but he quickly determined that he only had an interest in Margaret. Fully supported by Margaret’s parents, the Prince proposed on February 25, 1905, at a dinner at the British Consulate, and Margaret quickly accepted. The news came as a great surprise to the people of Sweden and was received with great joy by the Prince’s grandfather, King Oscar II.\n\nOn their way back to the United Kingdom at the end of March, the newly engaged couple and Margaret’s parents stopped in Rome. There, they were invited to a grand dinner at the Quirinale Palace, hosted by King Vittorio Emanuele III and Queen Elena, in honor of their visit.\n\nPre-Wedding Festivities\n\nOn June 9, 1905, the Duke and Duchess of Connaught hosted a Garden Party at Clarence House, where the wedding gifts were all displayed. The following day, the groom left Stockholm to travel to London, while his father and uncle, Prince Eugen, traveled on June 11, 1905.\n\nThe festivities began with two large dinner parties held at Windsor Castle on June 12 and June 13, 1905. On June 14, 1905, with all of the royal guests having arrived, a Garden Party was held at Windsor Castle, followed by a State Banquet that evening in St. George’s Hall, Windsor Castle.\n\nWedding Guests\n\nThe wedding was attended by many of the British and Swedish Royal Families, and numerous foreign royal guests. Below is a partial listing of the guests.\n\nThe Groom’s Family\n\nThe Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Sweden – the groom’s parents\n\nPrince Wilhelm of Sweden – the groom’s brother\n\nPrince Erik of Sweden – the groom’s brother\n\nPrince Eugen of Sweden – the groom’s paternal uncle\n\nPrince Carl and Princess Ingeborg of Sweden – the groom’s paternal uncle and aunt\n\nThe Bride’s Family\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Connaught – the bride’s parents\n\nPrince Arthur of Connaught – the bride’s brother\n\nPrincess Patricia of Connaught – the bride’s sister\n\nThe British Royal Family\n\nKing Edward VII and Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom\n\nThe Prince of Wales (future King George V)\n\nThe Princess Victoria\n\nThe Duchess of Albany\n\nPrincess Alice and Prince Alexander of Teck\n\nThe Princess Helena and Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein\n\nThe Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll and the Duke of Argyll\n\nThe Princess Beatrice, Princess Henry of Battenberg\n\nPrincess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg\n\nRoyal Guests\n\nPrince and Princess Christian of Denmark (future King Christian X and Queen Alexandrine)\n\nThe Hereditary Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Baden\n\nPrince and Princess Maximilian of Baden\n\nPrince Georg of Brunswick-Luneburg\n\nThe Khedive of Egypt\n\nPrince and Princess Friedrich Karl of Hesse\n\nPrince and Princess Heinrich of Prussia\n\nThe Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\n\nPrincess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\n\nDuke and Duchess of Sparta\n\nPrince and Princess of Waldeck and Pyrmont\n\nHereditary Prince and Princess of Wied\n\nThe Wedding Attendants\n\nThe bride’s attendants were:\n\nPrincess Patricia of Connaught – the bride’s sister\n\nPrincess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg – the bride’s first cousin\n\nPrincess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha – the bride’s first cousin\n\nPrincess Mary of Wales – the bride’s first cousin once removed\n\nThe Wedding Attire\n\nPrincess Margaret’s gown, made in France, was white satin with orange blossoms and myrtle, covered with white Irish lace. Instead of a tiara, she wore a floral crown that held her veil in place. The veil was a gift from the Ladies of Ireland and was later worn by her daughter, Ingrid, and all of Ingrid’s female descendants.\n\nThe flowers in her hair and the bridal bouquet featured daisies – a nod to her name (Margaret comes from Marguerite, the French word for daisy).\n\nGustaf Adolf wore full military uniform with several orders of chivalry:\n\nThe Star and Collar of the Order of the Seraphim (Swedish)\n\nThe Sash and Star of the Order of the Sword (Swedish)\n\nThe Necklet of the Order of the Polar Star (Swedish)\n\nThe Star and Collar of the Order of the Bath (British)\n\nWedding Gifts\n\nIncluded in the wedding gifts were some prominent pieces of jewelry, including three tiaras that are still in use today.\n\nThe Connaught Tiara was a gift from The Duke and Duchess of Connaught. The all-diamond tiara features a looped garland of diamonds with several large diamonds suspended. The tiara remains part of the Swedish collection today.\n\nThe Edward VII Ruby Tiara was a gift from King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom. The tiara of diamonds and rubies was later left to Margaret’s second son Sigvard and then bought back by King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and remains part of the Swedish collection today.\n\nThe Khedive of Egypt Tiara was a gift from the Khedive of Egypt, recognizing that the couple had first met while in Cairo. The diamond tiara was left to Margaret’s daughter Ingrid, who became Queen of Denmark. Since then, it has been used as a wedding tiara by all of Ingrid’s female descendants. Upon Ingrid’s death, it passed to her youngest daughter Queen Anne-Marie of Greece.\n\nIn addition to the jewelry and other gifts, the couple also received Sofiero Castle, in Helsingborg, Sweden, as a gift from the groom’s grandfather King Oscar II of Sweden. Oscar had the castle built in the 1860s and later expanded in the 1870s.\n\nThe Ceremony\n\nUnofficial Royalty: St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle\n\nThe wedding at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle was conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by the Bishop of Winchester, the Bishop of Oxford, and the Dean of Windsor.

Overhanging each tier were four balconies, beneath which were figures, modeled in sugar, bearing wheat, the symbol of plenty. The tiers were borne by four silver Grecian columns, and on the top of the cake was a draped female figure supporting a porcelain vase, from which hung garlands of natural flowers.”\n\nFollowing the luncheon, Gustav Adolf and Margareta (having taken on the Swedish version of her name) traveled to Saighton Grange in Cheshire, the home of the Earl and Countess Grosvenor, where they spent the night before traveling to Ireland for the rest of their honeymoon.
