        "text": "When I landed in Helsingborg, Sweden, I was pleasantly surprised to see the town. It was a rainy, gray day, but the town center was bustling. I had very low expectations for the town, since there hadn’t been much online or even in the guidebooks about sights to see or things to do. One of the first things I saw in the town center was the Radhuset or city hall, an impressive building that dates back to the 1890s. Unfortunately, a lot of this area is under construction, including the historic staircase that leads up to the Kärnan on top of the hill, overlooking the Øresund.\n\nThe Kärnan is the only remnant of the large Danish fortress that was once there. This fortress was the counterpart to Kronborg across the Øresund. This fortress changed hands several times during various wars between Sweden and Denmark. The tower is an interesting stop, with exhibits describing the history of Helsingborg, especially during the Medieval times when the Kärnan was in use. The top of the tower offers a great view of the city below and on a clear day, you can probably see all the way across the sound. While at the Kärnan, I learned about a nearby castle called Sophiero and decided to check it out since it was only a few miles away and I had no other plans.\n\nSofiero entered the Swedish history books in 1864 first as the summer residence of Crown Prince Oscar and his wife, Sophia. The couple called their new home, Sophie-Ro, named after Sophia (her nickname was Sophie) and ro, the Swedish word for tranquility. When they first built the home, it was only one story, a simple, country home. However, Oscar became King Oscar II after his older brother died heirless in 1872. The palace was renovated and expanded, with a second level added to be able to support the staff and requirements of the royal family.\n\nIn 1905, King Oscar II and Queen Sophia gave Sophiero to their grandson Gustav Adolf and his first wife Margareta. These two are the reason Sophiero is now home to a garden since both were passionate about gardening. Margareta and Gustav Adolf developed gardens, planted rhododendrons and planted a kitchen garden. The gardens continued to expand and grow, and a professional gardener was hired and a greenhouse was added. There are a few greenhouses now, including one that is home to the estate’s grapevines.\n\nGustav Adolf (later King of Sweden Gustav VI Adolf) had a unique interest in rhododendrons and spent his time dedicated to these plants. According to the Sopheiro website, during his time at Sofiero he planted “more than 5,000 specimens, which included with more than 400 different species.” Sophiero is now home to one of Europe’s largest collection of rhododendrons, including several rare and unique varieties.\n\nI can only imagine what the place looks like when it is in full bloom. In addition to the king’s rhododendrons, many of Crown Princess Margeta’s flower beds are still maintained they way she designed them. There were plenty of other flowers in bloom during my visit, including an impressive collection of dahlias. Also, there were lots of apple trees that were heavy with fruit – and baskets of apples free for the taking.\n\nThe royal family continued to spend summers at Sophiero until their deaths. Crown Princess Margareta died in 1920, but Gustav Adolf continued to spend his summers there until his death in 1973. In 1923 he married Lady Louise Mountbatten (be Prince Phillip’s aunt). When the king died, Sofiero was given to the city of Helsingborg and opened to the public.\n\nDespite the dreary weather, it was beautiful to walk around and explore the gardens and grounds. It sprinkled a little, but it also helped keep the crowds away. I tromped around exploring the ravines and gardens, thoroughly enjoying myself. I can imagine during the summer it is a happening place, with picnickers and people enjoying the beauty of this peaceful place. Admission is SEK 100 (about $10), but it was worth it. The bus departed from Helsingborg Central and was clean and a quick trip both ways. I was able to purchase the round trip ticket at the Kärnan for 50 SEK (about $5). I arrived back at the station and was able to get on a train for Lund for the next part of my trip."
