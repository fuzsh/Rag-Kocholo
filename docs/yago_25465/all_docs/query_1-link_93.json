        "text": "LORD Ivar Mountbatten is a British aristocrat and member of the extended Royal Family.\n\nFrom his life and marriage to his royal relations - here’s everything you need to know.\n\nWho is Lord Ivar Mountbatten?\n\nLord Ivar Mountbatten is a British aristocrat, farmer, geologist, and businessman.\n\nHe is also a third cousin once removed to the late Queen Elizabeth.\n\nThe aristocrat is also a first cousin once removed of the late Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nLord Ivar was born to parents David Mountbatten, 3rd Marquess of Milford Haven, and Janet Mercedes Bryce.\n\nHe was educated at Gordonstoun School in Scotland, the same school attended by Prince Philip and King Charles - and later graduated with a Bachelor's degree from Middlebury College in Vermont.\n\nPrior to his current marriage, the lord married Penelope Anne Vere Thompson - whom he shares three daughters with.\n\nHowever, after 16 years of marriage, the pair made the decision to divorce, and eight years later in 2016, Lord Ivar came out as gay.\n\nIn February 2023, Lord Ivar Mountbatten announced his plans to start charging dog walkers £60 a year to walk their pets on his 100-acre Devon estate.\n\nLord Ivar opened Bridwell Park, in Culm Valley to the public during the pandemic.\n\nHe and his husband launched the Orangery café to add to their income after their successful wedding business was hit by Covid restrictions.\n\nHe wrote in the parish magazine: \"The rise in living and operational costs in the past 12 months means our maintenance, management, and operational obligations have spiralled far higher than the return of coffee, cake, and community events can cover.\"\n\nHe added: \"I want to continue to offer access to the Orangery and Parkland across seven days a week. \"But if we’re going to remain open, we need our guests and visitors to support us a bit more if they can.\"\n\nHow old is he and what is his net worth?\n\nThe royal relative was born on March 9, 1963.\n\nAs of October 2023, Lord Ivar is 60 years old.\n\nAccording to reports, as of 2023, the aristocrat has an estimated net worth of $5million.\n\nHe is the owner of Bridgewell Park - a unique country house estate in the heart of Devon which has been frequently used as a wedding venue.\n\nWho is his husband James Coyle?\n\nLord Mountbatten married Glaswegian flight attendant James Coyle in 2018.\n\nThe pair first met when visiting Switzerland in 2015.\n\nThe happy couple married a couple of years later at a private chapel on Lord Mountbatten's private estate in Uffculme, Devon, with Ivar given away by his ex-wife and friend Lady Penny Mountbatten.\n\nAlongside three daughters Ella, Alexandra, and Louise - whom the Lord shares with his ex-wife - the ceremony was attended by other family and friends.\n\nLord Ivar’s second marriage was the first same-sex marriage within either the extended Royal Family.\n\nAlmost a year after celebrating their big day, Lord Mountbatten shared a glimpse into his relationship and links with the Royal Family with Tatler.\n\nSpeaking with the magazine, he admitted he didn't know how his decision to become the first member of the royal family to come out as gay was received by the Queen.\n\nHe explained: \"They really don't talk about it, the royals - they don't communicate very well.\n\n\"I think [my children] like having another man in the house.\n\n\"It's better than a stepmother who could have turned out to be a step-monster.\""
