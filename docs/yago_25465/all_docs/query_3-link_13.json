        "text": "During the First World War, she volunteered with the Red Cross and served as a nurse from March 1915 to July 1917.\n\nThrough the proclamation of 17 July 1917, whereby the British royal family assumed the surname Windsor, the name Battenberg was anglicised to Mountbatten. Princess Louise of Battenberg thereby became Lady Louise Mountbatten, which remained her name until her marriage in 1923. By her own account and that of many others, her marriage to Crown Prince Gustaf (VI) Adolf was a happy one despite the fact that the couple never had any children together.\n\nIn 1950, Louise became queen when her husband ascended to the throne. Louise has been described as a staunch democrat and a practical person who disliked the attention she received as queen.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Queen Louise suffered a couple of minor heart attacks. Her health deteriorated significantly during the autumn of 1964, and she was taken ill following the Nobel Banquet in December, which was to be her final public appearance.\n\nShe died in Stockholm on 7 March 1965."
