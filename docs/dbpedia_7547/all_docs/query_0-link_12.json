        "text": "The Seychelles are an archipelago made up of 116 islands, some bustling hives of activity, others private resort islands and some nothing more than raised coral islands. Many visitors choose to island hop between the larger islands, whether it be by charter flight by private jet or yacht, the second of which is ideal if you fancy dropping anchor beside uninhabited islands and untouched beaches.\n\nMahé is the largest island in the Seychelles, and also home to the capital, Victoria. Here you’ll find 90% of the country’s population, as well as a plethora of resorts, from luxury five star retreats to smaller boutique properties. Mahé is also home to Beau Vallon, the most popular beach in the Seychelles due to its powder-soft sand, crystal clear waters making it ideal for snorkelling and diving.\n\nThe second largest island is Praslin and is much quieter than Mahé and home to a wonderful collection of hotels. As it’s a separate island you can fly straight in if you charter, equally if you need to land at the international airport on Mahé you can transfer over either by air or sea. It is home to the renowned beaches Anse Lazio and Anse Georgette as well as the Vallée de Mai nature reserve where you’ll find the unique coco de mer and vanilla orchids amongst other flora and fauna.\n\nNext in size order you’ll find Silhouette Island, which has only 200 inhabitants and even fewer resorts. Our favourite here is the Hilton Seychelles Labriz Resort & Spa. Silhouette Island is also a biodiversity hotspot with many endemic plant and animal species. La Digue is another island, this one even smaller than Silhouette. Here you’ll find the boutique Domaine de L’Orangerie hotel amongst others as well as a small town with shops, a bank and a few restaurants. For the ultimate escape, head to Desroches, home to the Desroches Island Resort, the only resort on the entire island. This private island resort often plays host to celebrities and can be booked in its entirety should you wish for the ultimate in privacy and seclusion."
