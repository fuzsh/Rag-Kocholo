        "text": "A diverse history contributes greatly to the culture in Seychelles. A myriad of different ethnicities - African, European, Arab and Indian people - live in a harmonious country where diversity is an integral part of the landscape. Even if Catholicism is the most common religion in Seychelles, Hinduism and Islam contribute to the religious environment. Culture in Seychelles transports you to a world with both Creole and Western influences. This heritage is found through a particularly diverse architecture. Indeed, you can admire the majestic colonial mansions that transport you to another era.\n\nThe culture in Seychelles is celebrated through its cuisine which takes its inspiration from a multitude of exotic influences. Like the history of the country, the cuisine in Seychelles is rich and varied. Seafood is popular throughout the archipelago and you can awaken your taste buds by sampling fish or octopus grilled over a wood fire. Curries or manz√© kreol are also on offer. If looking for refreshment, many drinks will delight your palate. Do not hesitate to taste the bacca, a rum made from sugar cane and pineapple. Another must-try is Calou - a liqueur made from fermented coconut sap. Two local beers are brewed in the archipelago: the Seybrew and the Ecu which are very popular with Seychellois. Seychellois know how to have fun and dance is part of the Seychellois lifestyle. You can admire the local people dancing the Sega (a dance mainly from Madagascar) and other rhythmic dances of Seychelles accompanied by instruments such as the violin, banjo, and other traditional instruments such as Kaskavel or the Mouloumba (two bamboo instruments with seeds inside). In addition, the Creole music festival or the international carnival in Victoria will help make your trip to Seychelles memorable and colourful.\n\nDuring your trip to Seychelles, you will discover an array of arts and crafts created from coconuts. Local markets are full of traditional handmade items, such as baskets and woven hats for example. Seychellois artistry is illustrated through meticulous objects where attention to detail will not escape you. A must-see is the \"coconut buttock\", the famous sea coconut carved and decorated with seeds. However, be aware that you will need to request a certificate of sale to be able to take it out of the country. Literature, even if it is unknown to the general public, testifies to the richness of culture in Seychelles. Many recognized Creole authors have left their mark and the famous poet Antoine Abel is recognized in Seychelles. Tradition to tell tales and legends orally is an important part of culture in Seychelles. Culture in Seychelles is at the height of the landscapes: exceptional and unforgettable. You will spend a memorable stay, rich in discoveries and colourful."
