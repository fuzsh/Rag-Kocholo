        "text": "Seychelles is an island country in Africa; surrounded by the Indian Ocean the country has the smallest population of any African state. Seychelles consists of 115 islands, which are spread over 1.3 million square kilometres of the Indian Ocean. They are directly located 4 degrees south of the equator making it one of the most consistently warm countries in the world.\n\nBefore Seychelles gained independence the main exports were cinnamon, vanilla and copra. At this time a third of the population worked on plantations, compared to the 3% of today. Since its independence, tourism has become the country's primary sector which contributes 50% to the GDP. 20% of Seychelles' workforce is currently being employed directly for tourism. Popular tourist destinations include the beaches, the country's wildlife and water sports.\n\nAlthough still relatively new, the serviced apartment industry offers those visiting the country on business the perfect alternative to a hotel room. By providing more space, greater flexibility and a range of facilities, a Seychelles serviced apartment offers corporate travellers an ideal solution for long term stays and relocations."
