        "text": "By examining these aspects, we aim to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of Seychellesâ tax advantages and the benefits it offers to foreign investors.\n\nHow should you visualize a âSeychelles tax havenâ?\n\nIn general, this part covers a picture of Seychellesâ tax haven in terms of its geographical location, economy, political structure, legal system, and Seychellesâ offshore sector development.\n\nA modern archipelagoâs âgoldenâ site\n\nThe Republic of Seychelles, typically known as Seychelles in short, is a country located in the Indian Ocean, lying about 1.500 kilometers east of mainland East Africa.\n\nSeychelles is a well-known archipelago that is made up of 115 small islands. Seychellesâ main and largest island â the MahÃ© is widely reputed as the home to the capital city Victoria, the international airport as well as a large number of commercial centers of the country.\n\nSeychelles has a population of more than 98.000 people, and interestingly almost 90% of the countryâs people live on the MahÃ© island.\n\nThere are 3 official languages used in Seychelles, including English, Seychellois Creole (a kind of French-based creole language), and French. It is also good to know that residents living in Seychelles do not have to witness hurricanes and other disasters as much as other offshore jurisdictions like Caribbean countries.\n\nNot only is Seychelles a picturesque tourism attraction, but it is also well-placed as a golden position for manufacturing and trading between Africa, Europe, and Asia.Â The gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of Seychelles is among the highest in Africa ($16,575, nominal, 2018 est.).\n\nThe World Bank has also classified Seychelles (the only country in Africa) as a High Income Economy since 2015, proving the potential and the robustly growing economy of the Seychelles tax haven.\n\nOpen market economy and political stability\n\nOpen market economy\n\nSeychelles tax haven represents strong stability in both economy and politics.\n\nAgriculture and tourism have both largely shaped Seychelles economy in the beginning. However, it was not until the emergence of the offshore service industry did the jurisdiction underwent drastic changes. How the offshore sector has been booming in Seychelles will be later discussed.\n\nFree ebook\n\nNew to offshore business landscapes?\n\nAll the essential information you need is right here.\n\nAnother key fact about the Seychellois economy is its start as a single-party socialist country throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Afterward, the modification of dropping the centralized planning and using an open market economy instead has contributed significantly to the growth of the country, along with the increase in private investments in particular.\n\nAs a result, the strong economic performance has steered the Seychelles infrastructure, facility, and many other aspects like healthcare or education towards great improvements as well.\n\nStable political structure\n\nLike its economy, the politics of Seychelles tax haven was considerably influenced by the single-party socialism, which was brought about after the 1976 independence from the UK and remained active until 1993.\n\nCurrently, the Seychelles government has highlighted a framework of the multi-party political system with the nationâs president being the head of both state and government. The government holds the right to exercise executive power, meanwhile, the legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Assembly.\n\nSeychelles has joined reputable organizations such as the Commonwealth, the United Nations, the African Union, and many others. Embassies of Seychelles are also spreading throughout the world such as in Paris, New York, Brussels, New Delhi, Beijing, London, etc.\n\nA prime example of the mixed legislative system\n\nRegarding its legislation, Seychelles represents a uniquely mixed-jurisdiction system of law. Why a mixture?\n\nThe justice system of the Republic of Seychelles has been a combination of English Common Law and the French Napoleonic Code. This is due to the result of historical roots from both French and English territory.\n\nIt is noted that The National Assembly, which is the branch of the Seychelles legislative system, holds the power for forming as well as amending all laws, excluding some specific chapters as per in the Constitution. The constitution also highlights an independent judiciary.\n\nIn respect of the offshore sector, Seychelles tax haven has also gone through many changes before determining both modern and strict legislation for this contributing sector in the islands.\n\nCompanies under Seychelles offshore-related laws are provided with a range of merits like wealth protection, tax optimization, confidentiality guarantee for both individuals and corporations. Further details on how a Seychelles offshore company can benefit startups and entrepreneurs will be discussed later.\n\nAlong with Companies Ordinance, Electronic Transactions Act, Financial Services Authority Act, etc., there is two Seychellesâ legislation (with its latest update) that can significantly influence the operation of international companies including:\n\nBusiness Tax (Amendment) Act, 2018\n\nInternational Business Company (Amendment) Act, 2018\n\nThe booming offshore sector in Seychelles tax haven\n\nLike the aforementioned, the offshore sector is a big contributing factor to Seychelleâs economic growth.\n\nIn fact, the introduction of offshore service was in 1994 after the offshore legislation â i.e., the legislation regulating the incorporation of Seychelles International Business Companies (IBCs) â had been set out and gone into effect, then offshore service industry has been well recognized as one of the key income-generating sectors for the Seychelles country.\n\nSeychelles tax haven mostly has focused on offshore activities such as the incorporation of Seychelles IBCs, offshore trust, offshore insurance, investment fund management, offshore banking services, and many other offshore-related services.\n\nThe Seychelles International Business Authority (also known as SIBA) was also established by the Seychelles government to encourage the prospect of the offshore service industry. This authority is to ensure a smooth process for offshore company incorporations as well as to give further assistance to other offshore services like a foreign investment to be done in an appropriate manner.\n\nFor years, Seychelles tax haven has made efforts to introduce new legislation, review, and make necessary amendments for the sector improvements in the jurisdiction. Offshore investment in the Seychelles jurisdiction is also a widely chosen option thanks to its great benefits to investors and entrepreneurs.\n\nThe EU recently announced the next batch of exiting offshore jurisdictions from its ânon-cooperativeâ list which included Seychelles, Anguilla, and the Dominica Republic.\n\nThe scale of delisting, however, is not absolute as theyâre now simply allocated to Annex II which is typically a division reserved for jurisdictions that while not entirely compliant with international regulations, are on a best-effort basis of doing so.\n\nSubsequent to this, the Republic of Seychelles also requested an additional supplementary review from the Peer Review Group (PRG) to provide judgment on whether or not the jurisdiction would be eligible for a Largely Compliant Status.\n\nIf approved then Seychelles would effectively have its name removed from the EUâs list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for good.\n\nInvesting in Seychelles tax haven through the incorporation of an offshore company\n\nSeychelles is considered a wise choice when it comes to offshore investments. As a âtax havenâ, Seychelles offers your business a wide range of benefits. What are the highlights?\n\nSeychelles imposes no tax in place for corporations that do not conduct their business activities within the Seychelles territory. In other words, an offshore company in Seychelles pays no taxes on income generated abroad. There are also no capital gains tax, dividends, interest, inheritance, or property tax.\n\nSeychelles as a tax-free entity for offshore companies is well guaranteed by legislation.\n\nSeychelles offshore companies are significantly attached to their privacy and confidentiality guarantee. The jurisdiction implements strong protections against disclosure of information relating to the identities of the companyâs beneficial owners, directors, and shareholders.\n\nOffshore banking in Seychelles has been growing fast. By its extensive and sophisticated offshore banking network, opening an offshore bank account is a good idea for corporations and individuals.\n\nSeychelles IBC is the most common type of business entity in Seychelles tax haven.\n\nAn annual license fee is a must to any companies registered in Seychelles tax haven, including offshore companies.\n\nThere can be some restricted activities that require an offshore company (international business company for example) to obtain the Seychelles authorityâs permission before operations such as banking, insurance, securities business, gambling business, etc.\n\nYou are advised to conduct a careful examination of the offshore-related laws of Seychelles to make sure your company incorporation runs smoothly. You also should engage professional offshore service providers to save time and resources for Seychelles offshore company formation.\n\nConclusion\n\nSeychelles tax haven is obviously a good option for new investors and entrepreneurs to go offshore.\n\nIn addition to Seychellesâ favorable location, robust economy, effective regulatory regime, this tax haven also includes a range of stand-out characteristics to prove its business-friendly environment for foreigners such as its tax-free feature for foreign-source income, strong privacy provisions, and more. The fast-growing offshore service industry in Seychelles promises strong support for offshore company operations and development.\n\nSeychelles IBC is regarded as the most popular business form for foreign businesspersons when it comes to offshore incorporations in Seychelles. But for a variety of benefits, there are still certain requirements like annual government charge, as well as limitations for business activities to be allowed to incorporate in Seychelles that offshore seekers should bear in mind.\n\nIf you need further consulting, our experts are always available to assist you.
