        "text": "Economic overview\n\nSince independence in 1976, per capita output in this Indian Ocean archipelago has expanded to roughly seven times the pre-independence, near-subsistence level, moving the island into the high-income group of countries. Growth has been led by the tourism sector, which directly employs about 26% of the labor force and directly and indirectly accounts for more than 55% of GDP, and by tuna fishing. In recent years, the government has encouraged foreign investment to upgrade hotels and tourism industry services. At the same time, the government has moved to reduce the dependence on tourism by promoting the development of the offshore financial, information, and communication sectors and renewable energy.\n\nAgricultural products surpluses such as coconuts, vegetables, bananas, fruit, eggs, poultry, tomatoes, pork, tropical fruit, and cassava are used for commercial. Other natural resources in the country are fish, coconuts (copra), and cinnamon trees.\n\nGovernance Structure\n\nThe Executive: The president is both the head of the state and the head of government. He is deputized by the deputy president who is his assistant in running government affairs. A cabinet of ministers is appointed by the president to run various ministries within the government.\n\nThe Legislature: The parliament is a unicameral National Assembly or Assemblee Nationale (35 seats in the 2020 -2025 term; 26 members directly elected in single-seat constituencies by simple majority vote and up to 9 members elected by proportional representation vote; members serve 5-year terms)\n\nThe Judiciary: In Seychelles, there are two categories of courts with one being the highest court(s) made of Seychelles Court of Appeal which consists of the court president and 4 justices; the Supreme Court of Seychelles composed of the chief justice and 9 puisne judges and the Constitutional Court made up of 3 Supreme Court judges. The second category is the subordinate courts formed of Magistrates’ Courts of Seychelles; Family Tribunal for issues such as domestic violence, child custody, and maintenance; Employment Tribunal for labor-related disputes.\n\nSafety and Security\n\nOther than the transnational disputes involving Mauritius and Seychelles over claims of the Chagos Islands (UK-administered British Indian Ocean Territory), the country reports peace and stability.\n\nMembership to Regional Blocs\n\nThe Republic of Seychelles belongs to a number of regional and international blocs namely: UN, AU, RECSA, SADC and COMESA just to mention."
