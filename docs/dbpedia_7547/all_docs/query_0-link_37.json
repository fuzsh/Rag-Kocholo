        "text": "The chart bellow shows how the population of Seychelles has evolved from 1950 until now. It also contains the future prospects of Seychelles population. Data is groupped in several categories depending how the future projection was made: no change in evolution (the growth rate follows the trend of the last period), constant fertility, low fertility, medium fertility and high fertility. The data has been prepared by the United Nations Population Division. Please note that these numbers might be slightly different then those present in the country profiles.\n\nPlease click on the legend below the chart to show or hide projection categories."
