        "text": "Nestled in the heart of the Indian Ocean, Seychelles is often celebrated for its breathtaking landscapes, but behind the idyllic scenery lies a tapestry of unspoken truths that shape the social fabric of this island nation.\n\nIn this edition of #AfricaRising, we delve into Seychelles to uncover the nuanced stories of its people, exploring both the serene beauty and the intricate dynamics that define life in this tropical paradise.\n\nInteresting facts about the flag of Seychelles\n\nIn 1993 pressure from foreign powers led to democratisation of the government. The ruling party lost its monopoly in elections, and the participation of other parties in the government led to a demand for a less partisan national flag. Parliament approved a design incorporating the colours of various parties in a flag that was hoisted on June 18, 1996. The colours of the flag are blue (for sky and sea), yellow (for the life-giving sun), red (for the people and their work for unity and love), white (for social justice and harmony), and green (for the land and natural environment).\n\nThe map of Seychelles\n\nThe Republic of Seychelles is an archipelago of 155 islands situated in the Indian Ocean, southeast of mainland Eastern Africa. With a territory of 177 square miles and a population of 92,000, the Seychelles is the smallest African country.\n\nWhat is currently happening in Seychelles?\n\nCultural Harmony\n\nWith over 94,000 inhabitants, the Seychelles has ethnic roots from around the world in the fields or music, art, cuisine and dance. The majority of Seychellois are of African origin yet, there is still a large blend of ancestors from Europe, India and China.\n\n90% of the population of the Seychelles are of Creole descent, usually from French colonial settlers and African slave labourers. Most of the remaining 10% of residents are of European origin.\n\nEnvironmental Conservation\n\nSeychelles' commitment to preserving its pristine natural environment, from the famed coral reefs to rare species like the giant Aldabra tortoise.\n\nIn October 2018, Seychelles launched the World's First Sovereign Blue Bond aimed at mobilising resources for empowering local communities and businesses, in transitioning to sustainable fisheries and safeguarding our oceans while the blue economy is sustainably developed.\n\nU.N. scientists project that the sea level around the Seychelles will rise by another 2 to 2.5 feet by the end of the century — enough to inundate 1 in 8 buildings and 42 percent of major roads on the main island of Mahé, according to the country's coastal management plan.\n\nThe Seychelles climate is tropical, with daily temperatures of between 24 and 30 °C (75 - 86 °F). The ocean temperature stays at around 26 °C (79 °F) all year-round. Even in the early morning hours, the temperature in the Seychelles does not usually fall below 20 °C (68 °F).\n\nSocial Dynamics\n\nNavigating the unspoken truths of community life, exploring how Seychellois people connect, communicate, and support one another was really easy.\n\nCreoles, indigenous Seychelles population, are peaceful and friendly, always smiling people. They take it slow and are kind to tourists and to each other. If you are invited to a Creole home, be sure to bring a little present – it`s a custom around there.\n\nGender Equality in Seychelles\n\nIn the idyllic setting of Seychelles, where turquoise waters meet powdery beaches, there lies an undercurrent that demands our attention, the unspoken truths of gender equality. As we explore Seychelles in our #AfricaRising series, we venture beyond the postcard-perfect scenes to shed light on the complexities women face in this tropical paradise.\n\nWhile Seychelles has attained 40% representation for women at the management level in the private sector, women hold only 23% of elected positions in the National Assembly, with eight women among the 35 members elected in the 2020 elections (IPU Parline, 2023; World Bank, 2022).\n\nAD703: In Seychelles, majority support gender equality, think greater efforts are needed\n\nHistorical Perspective\n\nSeychelles, with its multicultural tapestry, bears the imprints of diverse gender dynamics. The archipelago's history reflects both the influence of matriarchal traditions from African roots and the patriarchal structures introduced during periods of colonisation. Understanding this historical context is crucial to unraveling the gender landscape in Seychelles.\n\nEducation and Empowerment\n\nSeychelles has made significant strides in promoting education for all, regardless of gender. The government's commitment to education has led to high literacy rates among both men and women. However, the journey toward gender equality goes beyond literacy. Empowering women in decision-making roles, especially in politics and business, remains a challenge that Seychelles is grappling with.\n\nWorkplace Dynamics\n\nIn the workplace, gender stereotypes persist, affecting career choices and advancement. While Seychellois women contribute significantly to the economy, especially in sectors like tourism, barriers to entry and glass ceilings still limit their progress in various professions.\n\nLegal Framework\n\nSeychelles boasts a legal framework that promotes gender equality, yet gaps exist in its implementation. Discrimination and violence against women persist, signalling the need for robust enforcement and awareness programs. Addressing these issues requires a collaborative effort from the government, civil society, and the community.\n\nCultural Influences\n\nCultural norms play a significant role in shaping gender roles in Seychelles. While the archipelago's cultural diversity enriches its social fabric, certain traditions may perpetuate gender inequalities. Unraveling these intricacies is essential for fostering a society where everyone, regardless of gender, can thrive.\n\nEmpowering Conversations\n\nThe unspoken truths of gender equality in Seychelles call for open conversations. By amplifying voices and challenging stereotypes, Seychelles can continue its journey toward a more inclusive and equitable society. Through awareness, education, and policy changes, Seychelles can be a beacon of progress in the pursuit of gender equality in Africa.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAs we unveil Seychelles in this edition, we invite you to join us in a journey beyond the postcard-perfect images. Let's discover the narratives that make Seychelles a unique part of #AfricaRising, embracing both its natural wonders and the resilient spirit of its people. 🏝️✨\n\nAs we uncover the unspoken truths of gender equality in Seychelles, it is evident that this journey requires collective effort. Seychelles has the potential to be a trailblazer, not just in tourism brochures but in fostering a society where every individual, regardless of gender, can bask in the warmth of equal opportunities and dignity."
