        "text": "The president of Seychelles declared a state of emergency on Thursday after a blast at an explosives depot injured almost 200 people and rippled through businesses and homes, sending shock and confusion across the archipelago off the coast of East Africa.\n\nThe explosion, which took place on the main island of Mahé, caused “massive damage” to an industrial zone called Providence and the surrounding areas, the president’s office said in a statement.\n\nVideo footage posted on social media and aired by the state broadcaster showed a fireball lighting up the night sky early Thursday. The blast damaged commercial buildings and offices, flattened some homes in the area and left a deep gorge in the ground.\n\nAt least 178 people were injured by the blast, the president of Seychelles, Wavel Ramkalawan, said at a news conference on Thursday.\n\nThere had been concerns for years about the stock of explosives and the way they were stored, Mr. Ramkalawan said. The Civil Construction Company Limited, where the blast happened, has supplied crusher and quarry products for construction since 1998, according to the company’s website.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what might have caused the explosion. Mr. Ramkalawan did not elaborate on the government’s concerns about the explosives or their storage. Investigators were looking into the blast and would publish their findings, the president said.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
