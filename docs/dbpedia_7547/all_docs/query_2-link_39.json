        "text": "The latest figure from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) puts the Seychelles’ population at 120,581, as of December 31, 2023, indicating a growth rate of 0.9 percent over 2022.\n\nThe new population figure encompasses both Seychellois and non-Seychellois residents.\n\nThe bulletin was published on March 1, 2024.\n\nThe Seychellois-only population is estimated at 100,602 as of December 31, 2023. This represents an increase of 685 persons, or an annual growth rate of 0.7 percent over 2022.\n\nIn 2023, there were 1,553 births registered, compared to 1,569 births in 2022.\n\nThe crude birth rate, which measures the number of births per thousand mid-year population, was 13.0 in 2023, compared to 13.1 in 2022.\n\nOf the 1,553 births, 269 (17%) occurred within marriage, 1,071 (69%) were acknowledged, and 213 (14%) were natural.\n\nThe percentage of legitimate births decreased from 19% in 2022 to 17% in 2023.\n\nThe percentage of natural births also decreased from 15% in 2022 to 14% in 2023, while the percentage of acknowledged births increased from 66% in 2022 to 69% in 2023.\n\nA figure that is worrying is the number of girls under 15 who gave births, which is 15 in 2023 compared to 3 in 2022. In the age group of 15-19, 176 gave birth in 2023 compared to 164 in 2022.\n\nThe Total Fertility Rate (TFR) in 2023 remained constant at 2.0, indicating the expected number of children a woman is projected to have throughout her lifetime, consistent with the rate observed in 2022.\n\n879 deaths were registered and among the deaths, 24 were infant deaths, with an infant mortality rate of 15.5 per thousand live births, compared to 15.3 in 2022.\n\nThe total fertility rate stands at 2.0, and the life expectancy for both sexes is 74.7 years.\n\nThere were 1,636 marriages registered in 2023, of which 23% were by residents. Additionally, there were 220 divorces registered.\n\nThe next Population Bulletin will be released at the end of August 2024.\n\nCompiled by Vidya Gappy"
