        "text": "2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. Related subjects: African Geography\n\nAbout 90% of the Seychellois people live on Mahe Island. Most others live on Praslin and La Digue, with the remaining smaller islands either sparsely populated or uninhabited.\n\nMost Seychellois are descendants of early French settlers and the Africans from East Africa in the 19th century. Desi and Chinese (1.1% of the population) account for the other permanent inhabitants. About 1,703 (2000) expatriates live and work in Seychelles. Of those, about 35 are from the United States.\n\nSeychelles culture is a mixture of French and African ( Creole) influences. The local Seychellois Creole (Kreol), a creole language derived from French and African tongues, is the native language of 91.8% of the people; but English and French are also commonly used. English remains the language of government and commerce.\n\nAbout 91.9% of the adult population is literate, and the literacy rate of school-aged children has risen to well over 98%. Increases are expected, as nearly all children of primary school age attend school, and the government encourages adult education.\n\nPopulation: 81,188 (July 2005 est.)\n\nAge structure:\n\n0-14 years: 26.4% (male 10,839; female 10,601)\n\n15-64 years: 67.4% (male 26,709; female 28,025)\n\n65 years and over: 6.2% (male 1,622; female 3,392) (2005 est.)\n\nPopulation growth rate: 0.43% (2005 est.)\n\nBirth rate: 16.22 births/1,000 population (2005 est.)\n\nDeath rate: 6.34 deaths/1,000 population (2005 est.)\n\nNet migration rate: -5.54 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2005 est.)\n\nSex ratio:\n\nat birth: 1.03 male(s)/female\n\nunder 15 years: 1.02 male(s)/female\n\n15-64 years: 0.95 male(s)/female\n\n65 years and over: 0.48 male(s)/female\n\ntotal population: 0.93 male(s)/female (2005 est.)\n\nInfant mortality rate: 15.53 deaths/1,000 live births (2005 est.)\n\nLife expectancy at birth:\n\ntotal population: 71.82 years\n\nmale: 66.41 years\n\nfemale: 77.4 years (2005 est.)\n\nTotal fertility rate: 1.75 children born/woman (2005 est.)\n\nNationality:\n\nnoun: Seychellois (singular and plural)\n\nadjective: Seychelles\n\nEthnic groups: mixed French, African, Desi, Chinese, and Arab\n\nReligions: Roman Catholic 82.3%, Anglican 6.4%, Seventh-day Adventist 1.1%, other Christian 3.4%, Hindu 2.1%, Muslim 1.1%,other non- Christian 1.5%, unspecified 1.5%, none 0.6% (2002 census)\n\nLanguages: Creole 91.8%, English 4.9% (official), other 3.1%, unspecified 0.2% (2002 census)\n\nLiteracy:\n\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\n\ntotal population: 91.9%\n\nmale: 91.4%\n\nfemale: 92.3% (2003 est.)"
