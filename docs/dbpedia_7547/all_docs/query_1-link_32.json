        "text": "Esmeralda is a rather remarkable tortoise. He (yes, despite the name, he’s a guy) is the world’s biggest and heaviest free-roaming tortoise. He weighs over 670 pounds (304kg) and is thought to be as much as 170 years old. And here’s another rather remarkable thing about him - Esmeralda was named by Lyall Watson, the famous botanist/zoologist and author of Supernature. Watson was visiting Guy Savy, the owner of Bird Island, Seychelles, when the very large tortoise approached them. As Guy tells the story: “We were having fun naming our newfound friend. I think it was Lyall who first mentioned Esmeralda: a happy and far reaching name for such a docile creature. In those days, a wild animal, especially a reptile, was sexed only for research. I don’t think Esmeralda minds.“\n\nEsmeralda is one of many Aldabra tortoises living on Bird Island, a coral cay surrounded by white-sand beaches and can’t-quite-believe-it turquoise sea. The Aldabra atoll, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is home to the largest wild Aldabra giant tortoise population in the world. There are about 100,000 of them - that’s more tortoises than there are humans in the island nation!\n\nThe atoll has been well protected and preserved, so these herbivorous gentle giants are able to roam safely and freely (and, it must be said, slowly), nibbling grasses and leaves and posing patiently for photographs with visitors. They are quite an astonishing sight with their huge domed shells, their big scaly legs and their oddly prehistoric faces.\n\nThe giant tortoises aren’t the only natural wonders on Bird Island. If you prefer your reptiles tiny and water-dwelling, from January to April/May you can see the Hawksbill turtle hatchlings make their way from beach to sea. If you don a mask and snorkel - or scuba gear - you might be lucky enough to see these sea turtles and other marvellous marine life in their natural habitat. It’s a remarkable rich and captivating population, from the large eagle rays and harmless reef sharks, right down to colourful anemones, angelfish, butterflyfish and clownfish. Unsurprisingly, given the name, Bird Island is also a birder’s paradise, attracting vast numbers of seabirds. From May to October, the island is home to tens of thousands of sooty terns.\n\nVisitors are often drawn to the all-year-round sun and sand attractions of the Seychelles - and admittedly, there’s hardly anywhere more relaxing or more beautiful to admire from the comfort of a beach lounger - but it’s worth getting out and about to see the natural wonders on offer, too. With nearly half of its landmass set aside as national parks and reserves, the island kingdom is a sanctuary for some of the rarest species of flora and fauna on earth. And you can explore them under and on the water, on foot, on bike, or even - if you’re adventurous - from a zip line over a forest!\n\nThe love nut\n\nEvery visitor to the Seychelles knows the nut of the Coco de mer or “love nut”. It’s the largest seed in the world and better known for its voluptuous shape. But have you heard of the jellyfish tree? It’s the rarest tree in the world - only a handful of examples survive, and they are all on Mahé Island in the Seychelles.\n\nThe Botanical Garden on the outskirts of Victoria, the capital, is a good place to get a feel for the plant life. You can see the iconic Coco, of course, but the beautifully landscaped tropical garden has an exotic and fascinating selection of fruit and spice trees, tropical flowers and orchids. There are remarkable birds, fruit bat colonies and even some giant tortoises from Aldabra. They may not have quite the heft - or the fame - of Esmeralda, but when you leave the lovely island nation and show off your suntan and your giant tortoise photos back home, they are bound to raise a smile."
