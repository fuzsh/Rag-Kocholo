        "text": "Terrorism\n\nThere is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.\n\nUK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.\n\nTerrorism in Seychelles\n\nAlthough there is no recent history of terrorism in Seychelles, attacks cannot be ruled out.\n\nCrime\n\nProtecting yourself and your belongings\n\nThere is a risk of break-ins, robberies, burglaries and opportunistic thefts. Crime is generally non-violent, but people can have their bags snatched, cars broken into or be robbed while walking at night.\n\nCriminals may target parked cars, residential accommodation including guest houses, hotels, beaches, and marked and unmarked walking trails.\n\nTo reduce the risk to yourself and your belongings:\n\nmake sure your living accommodation has external security lighting, grilles and overnight security guards\n\nuse a hotel safe or safety deposit box to store valuables, money and passports\n\ndo not leave valuables in cars or anywhere on display\n\navoid carrying large amounts of cash or wearing expensive-looking jewellery or watches\n\ncarry a mobile phone with roaming capability for use in an emergency\n\nBe particularly alert in:\n\nBeau Vallon\n\nthe back streets of Victoria\n\nany isolated area, especially at night\n\nCall the Seychelles police on +248 428 8000 to report any incident.\n\nLaws and cultural differences\n\nPublic nudity\n\nTopless sunbathing is uncommon. Nudism is not accepted and is likely to cause offence.\n\nIllegal drugs and prison sentences\n\nDrug taking and smuggling are serious offences in Seychelles. Penalties are severe and may include fines and prison sentences, up to life imprisonment.\n\nLGBT+ travellers\n\nSame-sex sexual activity is legal in Seychelles, but attitudes vary. Same-sex marriage is not recognised.\n\nRead more advice for LGBT+ travellers.\n\nOutdoor activities and adventure tourism\n\nSwimming\n\nBeaches can be safe for swimming at some times of the year and dangerous at others. In general, the west coast is unsafe during the north-west monsoon (around December to March), and the east coast is unsafe during the south-east winds season (around May to September). Beaches at the southern tip are not suitable for swimming at any time.\n\nBeaches do not always have safety information. You should not assume they’re safe. The popular Beau Vallon beach, and some other beaches, may have dangerous rip currents when the sea is rough.\n\nThere are not many lifeguards, though some are stationed on popular beaches. Ask for local advice about the conditions before you visit the beaches and follow any warning signs.\n\nSee water safety on holiday from the Royal Life Saving Society.\n\nHiking\n\nIt is generally safe to hike in Seychelles. Visitors have sometimes got lost on nature walks or hiking on trails. You can plan a route and access online guides and safety tips from the Seychelles Tourism Department.\n\nTransport risks\n\nRoad travel\n\nIf you are planning to drive in Seychelles, see information on driving abroad.\n\nYou can see the legal requirements you need to be aware of in the Road Transport Act.\n\nYou can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Seychelles for 3 months. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence or get a 1968 international driving permit (IDP) as well.\n\nHire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an IDP.\n\nDriving and road standards\n\nMahé is mountainous, and roads are narrow and winding, often with sheer drops and hairpin bends. Not all such roads are equipped with safety barriers. Deep, uncovered storm drains flank many roads.\n\nDrink-driving is a problem, so other road users may behave erratically.\n\nSudden heavy downpours can reduce visibility and road surface conditions quickly. Potholes can appear suddenly after heavy rains. Drivers sometimes veer sharply across lanes to avoid them.\n\nPublic transport\n\nBuses are cheap but infrequent on some routes. A timetable is available from the bus station in Victoria or from the Seychelles Public Transport Corporation. Most public buses do not operate after 8pm.\n\nTaxis are generally of a good standard. Taxi meters are increasingly common but if a taxi is not equipped with one, agree a fare before starting your journey.\n\nSea travel\n\nPiracy in the region has decreased but there is still some risk, especially off the coast of Somalia. You can check the latest situation with United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations and Maritime Security Centre (Horn of Africa).\n\nFor more information and advice, see piracy and armed robbery at sea.\n\nMost of the inner island resorts are accessible by ferry. Pay attention to safety briefings when taking any boat trips. Make sure life jackets are provided, especially on smaller excursion boats."
