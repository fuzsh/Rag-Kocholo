        "text": "Local population\n\nreaches 100,266\n\nBy Laura Pillay\n\nAccording to the latest figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics, the Seychelles population has seen a 0.7 percent increase over 2022, reaching a total of 100,266 individuals, as at June 30, 2023.\n\nThis comprises 48,962 males and 51,304 females, resulting in an approximate ratio of 954 men for every 1,000 women.\n\nOf this population, 41 percent falls within the prime working age group, ranging from 25 to 54 years old, while the elderly, aged 65 years and over, account for 11 percent of the total population.\n\nIn the first six months of 2023, Seychelles registered a total of 771 births, with 401 males and 370 females. Notably, 107 of these births occurred to women aged less than 20 years, reflecting an 11 percent increase from the same period in 2022.\n\nAnalysing birth data by districts, Ile Persévérance recorded the highest number of births with 67 births, followed by Anse Aux Pins (45), Beau Vallon (39), and Anse Royale (38). Grand Anse Praslin had the highest percentage of births to teenagers at 28 percent, followed by Roche Caïman (27 percent) and Ile Persévérance (24 percent).\n\nThe data also reveals shifting trends in birth registration, with legitimate births decreasing from 24 percent in 2018 to 16 percent for the first six months of 2023. In contrast, acknowledged births, where the father formally recognises the child, increased from 62 percent in 2018 to 71 percent during the first half of 2023. Non-acknowledged births dropped from 14 percent in 2018 to 13 percent for the same period in 2023.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reported eight infant deaths in the first half of 2023.\n\nRegarding the overall resident population of Seychelles, which includes both Seychellois and non-Seychellois, it stands at 119,772 persons as of June 30, marking a slight decrease of 106 persons since July 1, 2022. This comprises 64,729 males and 55,043 females, resulting in an approximate ratio of 1,176 men for every 1,000 women. Nearly half, or 48 percent, of the population falls within the working age range of 25 to 54 years.\n\nIn terms of mortality, 423 deaths were registered in the first six months, with 237 males and 186 females. It is important to note that 18 deaths of non-residents were excluded from the population estimates.\n\nFinally, when it comes to marriages, a total of 900 marriages were registered in the first half of 2023, but only 20 percent of these unions were between residents, with 113 resident couples tying the knot compared to 787 marriages involving visitors during the same period."
