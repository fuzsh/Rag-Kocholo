        "text": "This is a moderately strenuous program that is at times physically demanding and busy and requires participants to be fit and in active good health. To make the most of what each locale has to offer, shore excursions from the Island Sky will be active, ranging from a half-day to all day, and can involve up to two miles of walking, including a few relatively strenuous nature walks, often on sandy, uneven or muddy terrain, with possible extreme heat and humidity, the direct sun, or rain showers. These busy times will be offset by leisure time on board cruising to the next destination, with the opportunity to enjoy the ship’s amenities and the full lecture program.\n\nSome travel in Madagascar will be by 4x4 jeeps, with some longer, bumpy, slow drives on dirt roads (up to two hours each way). Madagascar offers a remote and mountainous landscape with minimal infrastructure; this means there is the possibility of delays in transit—or itinerary changes—due to poor road conditions. During the cruise there will be excursions by Zodiacs, which require the ability to step from the ship to the Zodiac and back again in open water (the ship’s crew will be there to assist you). Please note that some locations involve wet landings. All participants who plan to swim or snorkel must be comfortable swimming unassisted in open water, although no prior snorkeling experience is necessary. The ship does not have SCUBA capabilities but there will be an optional SCUBA opportunity one day in the Seychelles."
