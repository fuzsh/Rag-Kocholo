        "text": "After living for five years, our life in Seychelles has been one of the best times. As Seychelles is getting popular among tourists and slowly becoming one of the favourites for expats. The beautiful beaches, quiet island life had won many hearts. However, every place has its pros and cons. It’s always up to us which one we want to have weightage over the other. But when we were moving here, we had no idea about many things about this place. This blog has broken down a few points about Seychelles into the pros and cons of living in Seychelles. That will give you an idea of what to expect and probably help you make up your mind.\n\n#1 Beaches\n\nSeychelles is a popular destination for many things but mainly famous for its Beaches.\n\nPros: The Beaches in Seychelles are open to everyone, even if you are a tourist. Whether you find any attractive beach and it falls in the area of anyone’s residence or is a front for any hotel or resort, you can still access it because it is legally allowed by the government of Seychelles.\n\nThe beaches you will find here are generally clean. Communities are doing this job, and also many times schools or offices conduct cleaning activities.\n\nBook a trip to Seychelles here.\n\nCons — 1. A few beaches have coral close to the shore, so you may find that a turn off. But corals are spread in patches and not all over the beach, so you can still enjoy swimming at the beach.\n\n2. Seagrass or seaweeds are the other saddening factors, but that is also seasonal and depends on which side of the beach you choose to go during that time.\n\nDiving, snorkelling, swimming, water sports and other activities you will find easily. Motor activities, especially in the Beau Vallon area.\n\nBook a hotel in Seychelles here\n\n# 2 Weather\n\nSeychelles has only two seasons like any other tropical place: a wet season and Dry season. But you will keep having rain throughout the year.\n\nFrom May to October, the season in Seychelles is soothing, so you will enjoy the cold breeze more than heat waves, especially if you get a house in the hills.\n\nFrom November to April, Seychelles is very hot, and most of the time, it is not windy, making the weather very hot and sticky.\n\n#3 Dangerous Animals\n\nSo the other day, my sister saw our hiking video and asked, what if you met with any dangerous animal in the jungle.\n\nPros: So yes, there are no dangerous creatures here, but you will find Millipede, centipedes and small non-venomous snakes and friendly giant spiders who are also not harmful.\n\nCons: Though, I had an experience with dogs around here. So you may want to watch out for them while walking out on the road.\n\n#4 Everything is expensive\n\nThe cost of living in Seychelles is pretty high. You name it, and that thing will be expensive.\n\nRestaurants — a locally-made bottle of Seybrew beer is cheap in supermarkets or stores. But in restaurants it costs double.\n\nIf you want to enjoy and become a tourist and stay in a hotel, you will find it difficult to get a cheap hotel room in Seychelles.\n\nHouse rents are very high if you stay close to victoria (town/capital) or inside victoria. But if you get the house outside the Town in any other district, you are okay paying the rent, but again, you will have to have a car or spend on taxies.\n\nIt would help if you had a budgeted month regarding groceries or any extra expense you have the particular month.\n\nPs: If you are lucky to get a house from your workplace, you will save a ton on house rent.\n\nFruits and veggies: The tropical fruits are good, and most seasonal ones are reasonably priced. You will find Avocado, papaya, banana, jack fruits, mangoes during the season that starts Mid December. Mandarine, tangerine, watermelons are expensive, and sometimes you will feel betrayed if you bought them for 500 SCR, and when you cut them, it is terrible inside. Trust me, and it’s a ughhhh feeling. And please, please, please, the avocado season starts end of January and stays until three months, so enjoy local avocados during that time. It will be cheap and incredible in size and taste.\n\nCons: The imported veggies and fruits like apples, tomatoes, and onions are expensive in all seasons. Imported yoghurt is one big bill on your grocery budget. And honestly, I could never make curd or yoghurt, and maybe because of the temperature or packed milk, I am not sure. So buying curd has always been one immense amount on our shopping bill.\n\nBuying water was one of the cultural shocks for me, being an Indian. We don’t buy water, and we get it for free. At home, our filters and boring well at home, in the office’s employees provided with water coolers. Here, you have to buy those 20 litres bottles or something if you have a family at home. In my office, I used to buy 5 litres and keep it under my desk.\n\n#5 Transport and Everything is far\n\nIf you live or got a house away from the Town of Victoria, you will face difficulty getting to the city now and then. Even though the distance shown on the map is not much, you will end up driving for long and exhausted due to the winding roads. And if you are stuck in the traffic, then even worse. Buying a second-hand car is also expensive, but it’s convenient to have one.\n\nIf you want to eat out, you have to go to the Town or any restaurant nearby. Or else cancel the plan if it is even a bit late, like 7 pm due to its distance. And please do not take risks driving at night on winding roads. So this is one fact that no one gets to know until you move in here.\n\nThere’s not much to do in the evening, but if you live close to the Town, you have some restaurants open until late (book before hands because after covid restaurants are closing pretty early), bars, or around Eden island. Otherwise, you have to make your own fun in the evening. There are no cafes around the Island, so you have to go to Eden or Town for that.\n\nAlso, the public buses frequency is not swift, and primarily people living in the hills face this problem to walk down to the bus stop to get the bus.\n\nAlso, the office pickups don’t come to your doorsteps. The solution for this is to buy a car and learn to drive.\n\nPs: I am still struggling with that. I mean driving.\n\nThere are private taxis, but that’s also expensive if you have to travel every day. The solution for this is to make the taxi driver your friend, and he may give you a discount then."
