        "text": "WHERE TO LIVE IN SEYCHELLES\n\nBelow is a short list to the most popular regions to move to as a South African\n\nBEAU VALLON - the island of Mahé\n\nSome of the most affordable homes in Seychelles are found in Beau Vallon. Plenty of beautiful local beaches and fishing trips are close. Cultural influences from other expat influxes can be seen in the local cuisine of Beau Vallon, which primarily consists of Indian and Italian influences. Creole cuisine takes a backseat in this area. There are many homes and apartments for sale and for rent in Beau Vallon. There is a spread of options to suit most budgets.\n\nPRASLIN\n\nThe second largest island and most populated. This island has a relatively laid-back atmosphere and a slower pace than capital city Victoria or suburban Anse Etoile. Praslin is incredibly lush, with green groves and white sandy beaches. There are miles of wild growth, separated here and there by tiny homes or gardens. But there are also coastal villages, small towns, and plenty of commercial opportunities which helps keep the island charm.\n\nHowever it’s challenging to find single-family properties on Praslin. With natural charm tourism plays a major role, hence this island is aimed at the luxury market. Less opulent properties are equally expensive, as they often consist of several buildings or homes.\n\nBut if you’re ready to start a business that caters to the tourism industry in Seychelles, Praslin might be the right place for you. Besides, if your business goes well, you can upgrade your digs and enjoy a life of ease in one of this island’s many sumptuous oceanside manors. Of course, you could always choose a slightly less expensive neighborhood, like Anse Etoile.\n\nANSE ETOILE - the island of Mahé\n\nMost people live on Mahé with many breathtaking neighbourhoods and vista. Property prices are increasing. Many expats prefer to rent rather than buy. This area is less popular with the tourists, it is however a great residential spot with paved roads, homes with patios/verandahs facing the sea, and misty mountainous mornings are only a taste. Anse Etoile is a comfier, friendlier place with many restaurants, shops, bars, clubs, and modest churches.\n\nLA DIGUE\n\nDistinguishable by the giant granite stones La Digue is best-known for its snorkeling spots and peaceful beaches, there are also three small residential areas.\n\n- La Reunion is a great place to live if you’re a foodie, as there are multiple restaurants and takeaways.\n\n- La Passe is a little quieter and out of the way, beckoning introverts and solo expats alike.\n\n- L’Union is a mix of agricultural and touristic attractions.\n\nPrivate homes can be expensive on this island, as much of the land has been left unspoiled and untouched. Part of La Digue’s allure is its wild beauty, so property development is slow-going. When compared to many of the other islands La Digue may be the most affordable option. A handful of homes and apartments are available for less than the standard asking price.\n\nVICTORIA\n\nThe Capital City of the Seychelles. This is the best for International Schools. the massive open-air Sir Selwyn Selwyn-Clarke Market, and the gorgeously green Victoria Botanical Gardens are main attractions too. Many Hindu temples rise like skinny mountains from the city’s paved surfaces, and the thin white Victoria Clock Tower helps residents and visitors keep track of the time. Italian, French, and Creole restaurants are plentiful in the city, as are colorful apartment buildings and tourist-friendly resorts.\n\nRent and property prices are more expensive here. However, you’ll also be a stone’s throw away from some of the most modern amenities Seychelles has to offer, including several shopping malls, a cinema, and a handful of bookstores. Peace Park is a large grassy park area designed to help children, pets, and fitness enthusiasts enjoy some fresh air. There is plenty of open room for new businesses. English River is one of the most popular expat sub-neighborhoods in Victoria. This city is a fantastic place to be if you’re hoping to make a name for yourself in Seychelles. But it’s also a smart option for those wishing to enjoy a taste of island city living.\n\nA few other areas worthwhile investigating\n\nBel Air (Greater Victoria)\n\nRoche Caiman (Greater Victoria)\n\nSt. Louis (Greater Victoria)\n\nAu Cap (Mahé)\n\nAnse Royale (Mahé)\n\nGlacis (Mahé)\n\nGrande Anse (Praslin)\n\nSourced from: Retirepedia"
