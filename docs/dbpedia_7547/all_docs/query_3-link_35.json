        "text": "Introduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nA lengthy struggle between France and Great Britain for the islands ended in 1814, when they were ceded to the latter. During colonial rule, a plantation-based economy developed that relied on imported labor, primarily from European colonies in Africa. Independence came in 1976. Following a coup d’etat in 1977, the country was a socialist one-party state until adopting a new constitution and holding free elections in 1993. President France-Albert RENE, who had served since 1977, was reelected in 2001, but stepped down in 2004. Vice President James Alix MICHEL took over the presidency and in 2006 was elected to a new five-year term; he was reelected in 2011 and again in 2015. In 2016, James MICHEL resigned and handed over the presidency to his vice-president, Danny FAURE.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\narchipelago in the Indian Ocean, northeast of Madagascar\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n4 35 S, 55 40 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 455 sq km\n\nland: 455 sq km\n\nwater: 0 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 199\n\nArea - comparative\n\n2.5 times the size of Washington, DC\n\nLand boundaries\n\n0 km\n\nCoastline\n\n491 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12nm\n\nexclusive economic zone: 200nm\n\ncontiguous zone: 24nm\n\ncontinental shelf: 200nm or to the edge of the continental margin\n\nClimate\n\ntropical marine; humid; cooler season during southeast monsoon (late May to September); warmer season during northwest monsoon (March to May)\n\nTerrain\n\nMahe Group is volcanic with a narrow coastal strip and rocky, hilly interior; others are coral, flat, elevated reefs\n\nElevation\n\nlowest point: Indian Ocean 0 m\n\nhighest point: Morne Seychellois 905 m\n\nNatural resources\n\nfish, coconuts (copra), cinnamon trees\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 6.5% (2011 est.)\n\narable land: 2.2% (2011 est.)/permanent crops: 4.3% (2011 est.)/permanent pasture: 0% (2011 est.)\n\nforest: 88.5% (2011 est.)\n\nother: 5% (2011 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n3 sq km (2012)\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nmore than three-quarters of the population lives on the main island of Mahe; Praslin contains less than 10%; a smaller percent on La Digue and the outer islands\n\nNatural hazards\n\nlies outside the cyclone belt, so severe storms are rare; occasional short droughts\n\nEnvironment - current issues\n\nwater supply depends on catchments to collect rainwater; water pollution; biodiversity maintainance\n\nEnvironment - international agreements\n\nparty to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands\n\nsigned, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements\n\nGeography - note\n\nthe smallest African country; the constitution of the Republic of Seychelles lists 155 islands: 42 granitic and 113 coralline; by far the largest island is Mahe, which is home to about 90% of the population and the site of the capital city of Victoria\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n94,633 (July 2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 198\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Seychellois (singular and plural)\n\nadjective: Seychellois\n\nEthnic groups\n\npredominantly creole (mainly of East African and Malagasy heritage); also French, Indian, Chinese, and Arab populations\n\nLanguages\n\nSeychellois Creole (official) 89.1%, English (official) 5.1%, French (official) 0.7%, other 3.8%, unspecified 1.4% (2010 est.)\n\nReligions\n\nRoman Catholic 76.2%, Protestant 10.5% (Anglican 6.1%, Pentecostal Assembly 1.5%, Seventh Day Adventist 1.2%, other Protestant 1.7%), other Christian 2.4%, Hindu 2.4%, Muslim 1.6%, other non-Christian 1.1%, unspecified 4.8%, none 0.9% (2010 est.)\n\nDemographic profile\n\nSeychelles has no indigenous population and was first permanently settled by a small group of French planters, African slaves, and South Indians in 1770. Seychelles’ modern population is composed of the descendants of French and later British settlers, Africans, and Indian, Chinese, and Middle Eastern traders and is concentrated on three of its 155 islands – the vast majority on Mahe and lesser numbers on Praslin and La Digue. Seychelles’ population grew rapidly during the second half of the 20th century, largely due to natural increase, but the pace has slowed because of fertility decline. The total fertility rate dropped sharply from 4.0 children per woman in 1980 to 1.9 in 2015, mainly as a result of a family planning program, free education and health care, and increased female labor force participation. Life expectancy has increased steadily, but women on average live 9 years longer than men, a difference that is higher than that typical of developed countries.The combination of reduced fertility and increased longevity has resulted in an aging population, which will put pressure on the government’s provision of pensions and health care. Seychelles’ sustained investment in social welfare services, such as free primary health care and education up to the post-secondary level, have enabled the country to achieve a high human development index score – among the highest in Africa. Despite some of its health and education indicators being nearly on par with Western countries, Seychelles has a high level of income inequality.An increasing number of migrant workers – mainly young men – have been coming to Seychelles in recent years to work in the construction and tourism industries. As of 2011, foreign workers made up nearly a quarter of the workforce. Indians are the largest non-Seychellois population – representing half of the country’s foreigners – followed by Malagasy.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 19.52%(male 9,482 /female 8,989)\n\n15-24 years: 12.96%(male 6,461 /female 5,806)\n\n25-54 years: 49.29%(male 24,841 /female 21,800)\n\n55-64 years: 10.44%(male 5,008 /female 4,870)\n\n65 years and over: 7.79%(male 2,974 /female 4,402) (2018 est.)\n\npopulation pyramid:\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 42.8 (2015 est.)\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 31 (2015 est.)\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 11.7 (2015 est.)\n\npotential support ratio: 8.5 (2015 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 35.8 years (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 35.3 years\n\nfemale: 36.5 years\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 76\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n0.74% (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 136\n\nBirth rate\n\n13.4 births/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 142\n\nDeath rate\n\n7 deaths/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 130\n\nNet migration rate\n\n1 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 61\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nmore than three-quarters of the population lives on the main island of Mahe;

Growth has been led by the tourism sector, which directly employs about 26% of the labor force and directly and indirectly accounts for more than 55% of GDP, and by tuna fishing. In recent years, the government has encouraged foreign investment to upgrade hotels and tourism industry services. At the same time, the government has moved to reduce the dependence on tourism by promoting the development of the offshore financial, information, and communication sectors and renewable energy.In 2008, having depleted its foreign exchange reserves, Seychelles defaulted on interest payments due on a $230 million Eurobond, requested assistance from the IMF, and immediately enacted a number of significant structural reforms, including liberalization of the exchange rate, reform of the public sector to include layoffs, and the sale of some state assets. In December 2013, the IMF declared that Seychelles had successfully transitioned to a market-based economy with full employment and a fiscal surplus. However, state-owned enterprises still play a prominent role in the economy. Effective 1 January 2017, Seychelles was no longer eligible for trade benefits under the US African Growth and Opportunities Act after having gained developed country status. Seychelles grew at 5% in 2017 because of a strong tourism sector and low commodity prices. The Seychellois Government met the IMF’s performance criteria for 2017 but recognizes a need to make additional progress to reduce high income inequality, represented by a Gini coefficient of 46.8.As a very small open economy dependent on tourism, Seychelles remains vulnerable to developments such as economic downturns in countries that supply tourists, natural disasters, and changes in local climatic conditions and ocean temperature. One of the main challenges facing the government is implementing strategies that will increase Seychelles' long-term resilience to climate change without weakening economic growth.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$2.75 billion (2017 est.)\n\n$2.612 billion (2016 est.)\n\n$2.499 billion (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 190\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$1.498 billion (2017 est.)\n\nGDP -
