The Seychelles are located in the western part of the Indian Ocean, to south of the equator and about 1,600 km east of the African mainland, to north of Madagascar. The republic consists of 115 islands (only 33 are inhabited).\n\nThe total area of the state is 455 km². The largest island is Mahe (142 km2). The capital of the state, Victoria, and the international airport are located on Mahe. Other major islands: Silhouette, Praslin and La Digue. There are lots of tiny islands as a part of archipelago.\n\nThe population of Seychelles is about 88,000 (2010 census).\n\nOne can endlessly talk about the paradise on Earth. But are these stories worthy to listen? It is better to see it all one time than to hear about it forever, right? To the common “see Paris and die”, we can safely add the paraphrased “Is there life without the Seychelles?».\n\nThe cost of absolutely all packages to the islands is calculated individually on the basis of the budget and preferences of tourists. The minimum package for the Seychelles will cost AZN 1800 per person (airfare, accommodation, transfers and insurance included).\n\nSeychelles (French: République des Seychelles; Seychellois Creole: Repiblik Sesel) is an archipelago in the Indian Ocean/East Africa.
