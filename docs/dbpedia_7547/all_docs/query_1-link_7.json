The natural increase is expected to be positive, as the number of births will exceed the number of deaths by 1,051. If external migration will remain on the previous year level, the population will be declined by 330 due to the migration reasons. It means that the number of people who leave Seychelles to settle permanently in another country (emigrants) will prevail over the number of people who move into the country (to which they are not native) in order to settle there as permanent residents (immigrants).\n\nPopulation change rates in 2024\n\nAccording to our estimations, daily change rates of Seychelles population in 2024 will be the following:\n\n5 live births average per day (0.21 in an hour)\n\n2 deaths average per day (0.09 in an hour)\n\n-1 emigrants average per day (-0.04 in an hour)\n\nThe population of Seychelles will be increasing by 2 persons daily in 2024.\n\nDemographics of Seychelles 2023\n\nAs of 1 January 2024, the population of Seychelles was estimated to be 100,876 people. This is an increase of 0.71 % (716 people) compared to population of 100,160 the year before. In 2023 the natural increase was positive, as the number of births exceeded the number of deaths by 1,044. Due to external migration, the population declined by 328. The sex ratio of the total population was 1.047 (1,047 males per 1,000 females) which is higher than global sex ratio. The global sex ratio in the world was approximately 1,016 males to 1,000 females as of 2023.\n\nBelow are the key figures for Seychelles population in 2023:\n\n1,802 live births\n\n758 deaths\n\nNatural increase: 1,044 people\n\nNet migration: -328 people\n\n51,593 males as of 31 December 2023\n\n49,283 females as of 31 December 2023\n\nGrowth Rate 1952 - 2024\n\nSeychelles population density\n\nSeychelles population density is 219.3 people per square kilometer (568.0/mi2) as of August 2024. Density of population is calculated as permanently settled population of Seychelles divided by total area of the country. Total area is the sum of land and water areas within international boundaries and coastlines of Seychelles. The total area of Seychelles is 460 km2 (178 mi2) according to the United Nations Statistics Division .\n\nReligion in Seychelles\n\nReligion Number of followers Percentage of\n\ntotal population Christianity95,25094.0 %Religiously Unaffiliated2,1282.1 %Hinduism2,1282.1 %Islam1,1151.1 %Other7090.7 %\n\nSource: Pew Research Center. The Global Religious Landscape .\n\nNumber of followers estimated by Countrymeters (Sunday, August 18 2024).\n\nSeychelles age structure\n\nAs of the beginning of 2024 according to our estimates Seychelles had the following population age distribution:\n\n21.9 71 7.2\n\n- percentage of population under 15 - percentage of population between 15 and 64 years old - percentage of population 65+\n\nIn absolute figures (estimate):\n\n22,041 young people under 15 years old ( 11,296 males / 10,746 females)\n\n71,619 persons between 15 and 64 years old ( 37,375 males / 34,244 females)\n\n7,215 persons above 64 years old ( 2,714 males / 4,501 females)\n\nWe prepared a simplified model of the population distribution pyramid which is broken down into 3 main age groups. The groups are the same as we used above: population under 15, between 15 and 64 and population which is over 65 year old.\n\n65+\n\n15-64\n\n0-14\n\nmale female\n\nNote: The pyramid provided is not corresponding to data given above because the age groups have different number of years.\n\nAs we can see the Seychelles population pyramid has a stationary type. Countries with such type of pyramid usually have declining birth rate and relatively low death rate. Which is more common for developed countries.\n\nSource: The estimation data for section \"Seychelles age structure\" is based on the latest demographic and social statistics by United Nations Statistics Division .\n\nAge dependency ratio\n\nDependency ratio of population is a ratio of people who are generally not in the labor force (the dependents) to workforce of a country (the productive part of population). The dependent part includes the population under 15 years old and people aged 65 and over. The productive part of population accordingly consists of population between 15 and 64 years.\n\nThis ratio shows the pressure on productive population produced by the dependent part of population.\n\nThe total dependency ratio of population in Seychelles is 40.8 %.\n\nThe value of 40.8 % is relatively low. It shows that the dependent part of population is less than a half of the working part. In other words the working population (labor force) in Seychelles must provide goods for itself and cover expenditure on children and aged persons. And this part of population is less than 50% of working population. The value of less than 50% means that the pressure on productive population in Seychelles is relatively low.\n\nChild dependency ratio\n\nChild dependency ratio is a ratio of people below working age (under 15) to workforce of a country.\n\nChild dependency ratio in Seychelles is 30.8 %.\n\nAged dependency ratio\n\nAged dependency ratio is a ratio of people above working age (65+) to workforce of a country.\n\nAged dependency ratio in Seychelles is 10.1 %.\n\nSource: The estimation data for section \"Seychelles age dependency ratio\" is based on the latest demographic and social statistics by United Nations Statistics Division .\n\nLife expectancy\n\nLife expectancy at birth is one of the most important demographic indicator. It shows the number of years a newborn infant would live assuming that birth and death rates will remain at the same level during the whole lifetime.\n\nTotal life expectancy (both sexes) at birth for Seychelles is 73.5 years.\n\nThis is above the average life expectancy at birth of the global population which is about 71 years (according to Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations).\n\nMale life expectancy at birth is 68.9 years.\n\nFemale life expectancy at birth is 78.3 years.\n\nLiteracy of population\n\nAccording to our estimates 75,059 persons or 95.21% of adult population (aged 15 years and above) in Seychelles are able to read and write. Accordingly about 3,775 adults are illiterate.\n\nLiteracy rate for adult male population is 94.74% (37,981 persons). 2,108 are illiterate.\n\nLiteracy rate for adult female population is 95.7% (37,078 persons). 1,667 are illiterate.\n\nYouth literacy rates are 98.58% and 99.56% for males and females accordingly. The overall youth literacy rate is 99.05%. Youth literacy rate definition covers the population between the ages of 15 to 24 years.\n\nSource: The estimation data for section \"Seychelles population literacy\" is based on the latest data published by UNESCO Institute for Statistics (retrieved March 13, 2016) .\n\nSeychelles population history\n\nYearPopulationGrowth Rate 195136,617N/A %195237,1911.57 %195337,7411.48 %195438,2561.36 %195538,7361.25 %195639,1801.15 %195739,6171.12 %195840,0801.17 %195940,6141.33 %196041,2591.59 %196142,0391.89 %196242,9652.20 %196344,0082.43 %196445,1152.52 %196546,2372.49 %196647,3312.37 %196748,3952.25 %196849,4602.20 %196950,5702.24 %197051,7572.35 %197153,0482.49 %197254,4242.59 %197355,8742.66 %197457,3592.66 %197558,8462.59 %197660,3182.50 %197761,7692.41 %197863,1722.27 %197964,4872.08 %198065,6791.85 %198166,7441.62 %198267,6851.41 %198368,4811.18 %198469,1210.93 %198569,5890.68 %198669,8570.39 %198769,9440.12 %198869,935-0.01 %198970,0080.10 %199070,3320.46 %199171,0130.97 %199272,0571.47 %199373,3721.82 %199474,7631.90 %199576,0531.73 %199677,1281.41 %199777,9801.10 %199878,7130.94 %199979,4870.98 %200080,4541.22 %200181,7111.56 %200283,2521.89 %200384,9492.04 %200486,6021.95 %200588,0251.64 %200689,0941.21 %200789,8070.80 %200890,2670.51 %200990,6200.39 %201091,0320.45 %201191,5800.60 %201292,2470.73 %201393,0060.82 %201493,8090.86 %201594,6010.84 %201695,3480.79 %201796,0670.75 %201896,7590.72 %201997,4200.68 %202098,0420.64 %202198,7430.71 %202299,4490.71 %2023100,1600.71 %2024100,8760.71 %\n\nThe data is given as of 1st of January of an year."
