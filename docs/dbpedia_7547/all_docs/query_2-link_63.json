        "text": "Seychelles , officially Republic of Seychelles, Island country, western Indian Ocean. Area: 172 sq mi (446 sq km). Population: (2024 est.) 105,000. Capital: Victoria. The mixed population is of French, African, and Asian ancestry. Languages: Creole, English, French. Religion: Christianity (predominantly Roman Catholic; also Anglican); smaller populations of Hindus and Muslims. Currency: Seychelles rupee. Located east of northeastern Tanzania, Seychelles is composed of two main island groups: the Mah√© group of more than 40 central, mountainous, granitic islands and a second group of more than 70 outlying, flat, coralline islands. The country has a developing economy that depends heavily on the service sector in general and the tourism industry in particular. Exports include fish, copra, and cinnamon. It is a multiparty republic with one legislative house; its head of state and government is the president. The first recorded landing on uninhabited Seychelles was made in 1609 by an expedition of the British East India Company. The archipelago was claimed by the French in 1756 and surrendered to the British in 1810. It became a British crown colony in 1903 and a republic within the Commonwealth in 1976. A one-party socialist state since 1979, it held multiparty elections in 1992 and adopted a new constitution in 1993."
