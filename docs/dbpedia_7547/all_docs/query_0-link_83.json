        "text": "Estimates of short-term international migration for England and Wales are available on the basis of three definitions.\n\nThe 1-12 months definition, which includes those migrating for all reasons\n\nThe 3-12 months definition, which also includes those migrating for all reasons\n\nThe United Nations (UN) definition, which states that 'a short-term migrant is a person who moves to a country other than that of his or her usual residence for a period of at least three months but less than a year (12 months) except in cases where the movement to that country is for purposes of recreation, holiday, visits to friends or relatives, business, medical treatment or religious pilgrimage.' In practice, this is defined as a visit of 3-12 months for the purpose of work or study\n\nTo be included as a short-term international immigrant to England and Wales under any of these definitions, a person arriving must have been living outside the UK for 12 months or more (these tend to be foreign citizens, but can include British citizens). A short-term international emigrant from England and Wales must have been living in the UK for 12 months or more prior to leaving (these tend to be British citizens, but include other residents).\n\nThe UN definition is used to allow international comparisons and is also the only available definition for estimates of short-term international migration to local authorities. The UN definition of ‘work’ refers to working for an employer in the destination country and excludes business trips where a migrant is paid by an organisation in their country of origin. The UN definition of ‘study’ refers to Higher and Further Education courses and excludes evening classes and informal tuition.\n\nShort-term migrants who stay for 3-12 months are more likely to use local services and become economically active; therefore, this bulletin focuses on migrants staying for 3-12 months (definition 2), although some figures for 1-12 month stays are also provided for comparison.\n\nShort-term international migration estimates relate to the number of migration events rather than the number of people. For example, under the 1-12 months definition, this means that if one person enters or leaves the UK for more than a month, more than once, each of their journeys to the UK is counted.\n\nONS estimates of short-term international migration, for all three definitions, refer to the mid-year, which is 1 July to 30 June. Home Office short-term visa data refer to calendar years.\n\nWhat about net migration?\n\nUnlike for Long-Term International Migration, there are no estimates of short-term international net migration flows. Short-term migrants do not stay for more than 12 months; therefore, they do not become ‘usually resident’. This means they are not included in population estimates, so calculating a net migration figure for short-term migrants does not have the value that it does for long-term international migration. In addition, short-term migrants coming to England and Wales are counted in as short-term migrants but not out as short-term migrants, because to be counted out as a short-term migrant, a person needs to have been resident in England and Wales for 12 months or more. Short-term international outflows from England and Wales are higher than short-term international inflows to England and Wales, so the net difference would be negative if it were possible to calculate.\n\nThe most appropriate estimates to use in order to estimate the impact of short-term international migration on the overall population are short-term international migration stocks. Stocks estimates are more meaningful because they estimate the average number of short-term migrants in the country on an average day in a 12 month period. For example, if four migrants each stayed in England and Wales for three months, this would be the equivalent of one person staying for one year, so the ‘stock’ count would be 1. Section 2 of this report analyses estimates of short-term international migration stocks.\n\nHow do ONS short-term international migration estimates compare to Home Office data on short-term visas?\n\nVisa data provides only partial coverage of short term migrants since it normally relates to those non- European Economic Area (EEA) nationals, who are subject to immigration control, and who require a visa. EEA nationals do not normally require a visa to enter the UK (although a small number of EEA nationals do apply and are issued with visas). Additionally, for those non-EEA nationals classified as 'non-visa nationals' (e.g. citizens of the USA, Brazil and Japan) a visa is not normally required for visits of less than 6 months. For more information about non-visa nationals, please refer to the glossary.\n\nIn this report, a short term visa is defined as being a visa of less than 12 months duration issued to those who have arrived in the UK for work or study; this definition is presented to better align visa data with the UN definition of short-term international migration. The figures presented relate to visas issued for entry clearance to the UK and do not relate to individual countries within the UK. The figures also include dependants.\n\nIt is important to recognise that visa duration does not necessarily represent length of stay. Many individuals will depart prior to the expiry date, whilst a proportion of these may also be granted extensions of stay. For example, it is not possible to determine whether a holder of a visa has actually stayed for 3 months or more.\n\nAt the boundary between long- and short-term visas only a small proportion of visas are issued for exactly a year (365 or 366 days). However, in 2013 these represented only 0.1% (700) of the total for all regular study visas (219,000); and 3% (5,000) of the total number of work visas (155,000).\n\nPlease also note that some data presented in this report is based on a more recent extract from the underlying administrative data source, and therefore may not exactly match totals published in the Home Office report, Immigration Statistics January to March 2013.\n\nWhere do the data come from?\n\nEstimates of short-term international migration are derived from the International Passenger Survey (IPS). The IPS is a survey of a random sample of passengers entering and leaving the UK by air, sea or the Channel Tunnel and is also used to calculate Long-Term International Migration estimates and Travel and Tourism statistics.\n\nShort-term migrants are interviewed by the IPS at the end of their stay; therefore, if their actual reported length of stay is for 1-12 months and they match the above definitions, they will be included in the short-term international migration estimates. Since they have already completed their migration, they will not later become long-term migrants, so there is no overlap between short-term and long-term international migration estimates. However, there are overlaps between short-term international migration statistics, which count visits by ‘migrants’ of 1-12 months, and travel and tourism statistics, which count visits by ‘visitors’ of over 1 day but less than 12 months. Estimates of visitors are considerably higher than those of migrants. Although there is some overlapping sample between the two statistics, they examine different characteristics of the short-term visitors/migrants.\n\nThe mid-2012 estimates presented in this bulletin are provisional. This is because IPS data are only finalised when a full calendar year's interview data can be calibrated against annual passenger figures supplied to the IPS by the Civil Aviation Authority and the British Ports Authority. Mid-2012 estimates of short-term migration will include data collected up to 30 June 2013 (because short-term migrants are interviewed at the end of their stay). Provisional estimates are replaced with final estimates when the data are republished in the following year; for example, final mid-2011 estimates are included in this report, having been published as provisional estimates on 23 May 2013. In practice, only a very small percentage of the interviews used to build the estimates for the most recently published mid-year will have been collected in the most recent calendar year, so the final estimates will differ only slightly from the provisional estimates.\n\nFor more information about how England and Wales short-term international migration estimates are calculated, please refer to the Short-term international migration methodology - national estimates (218.1 Kb Pdf) and the Short-term international migration - frequently asked questions (95.3 Kb Pdf).\n\nShort-term international immigration estimates for local authorities in England and Wales are derived by distributing national England and Wales estimates to the local authorities on the basis of administrative information about short-term migrants from a number of different sources. Local authority estimates use only the UN definition because these administrative sources are only available for workers and students, and are not sufficiently robust to provide information on those staying for less than three months. Estimates of short-term international emigration from local authorities are not available because there are no suitable data available to distribute estimates of short-term emigration from local authorities.\n\nFor more information about how local authority estimates are calculated, please refer to the Short-term international migration methodology - local authority estimates (167.1 Kb Pdf). Further migration data for local authorities are also available in the Local Area Migration Indicators Suite.\n\nBack to table of contents\n\nCitizenship\n\nThis is the term used in the International Passenger Survey (IPS) to define the country for which a migrant is a passport holder. This refers specifically to the passport being used to enter / leave the UK at the time of interview. It does not refer to any other passport(s) which migrants of multiple nationality may hold.\n\nMore generally a British citizen as described in IPS statistics includes those with UK nationality usually through a connection with the UK: birth, adoption, descent, registration, or naturalisation. British nationals have the right of abode in the UK.\n\nCommonwealth (ONS Statistical Grouping)\n\nThe Commonwealth statistical grouping consists of countries of the Old Commonwealth and the New Commonwealth (see below).\n\nConfidence interval\n\nThis is the range within which the true value of a population parameter lies with known probability. For example the 95% confidence interval represents the range in which there are 19 chances out of 20 that the true figure would fall (had all migrants been surveyed). The uppermost and lowermost values of the confidence interval are termed 'confidence limits'.\n\nCountry of usual residence\n\nBased on the UN definition, the country in which a person has a place to live, where he or she normally spends the daily period of rest. Temporary travel abroad for purposes of recreation, holiday, visits to friends and relatives, business, medical treatment or religious pilgrimages does not change a person’s country of usual residence.\n\nEuropean Economic Area (EEA)\n\nThe EEA consists of the 27 countries of the EU (see below), plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Swiss nationals are treated as EEA nationals for immigration purposes.\n\nEuropean Union (EU)\n\nThe EU consists of 28 countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Ireland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Croatia joined the EU in July 2013 - data with a reference period after that date will include Croatia within the EU grouping. In this report, only Home Office visa data will be impacted by this change.\n\nEuropean Union (EU) accession countries\n\nThe Accession countries are those that joined the EU in 2004 or later. Ten joined in 2004 (the EU8, plus Cyprus and Malta), two joined in 2007 (the EU2) and Croatia joined in 2013.\n\nEU2\n\nThe EU2 (formerly known as the A2) are the two countries that joined the EU on 1 January 2007: Bulgaria and Romania. Between 2007 and 2013, EU2 nationals had certain restrictions placed on them; in the first 12 months of stay, working Bulgarian and Romanian nationals were generally required to hold an accession worker card or apply for one of two lower-skilled quota schemes. Other Bulgarian and Romanian nationals could apply for a registration certificate, giving proof of a right to live in the UK. These restrictions were lifted on 1 January 2014.\n\nEU8\n\nThe EU8 (formerly known as the A8) are the eight central and eastern European countries that joined the EU on 1 May 2004: Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. The EU8 does not include the two other countries that joined on that date: Cyprus and Malta. EU8 nationals previously had restrictions on their rights to work and were required to register under the Worker Registration Scheme, but these restrictions were lifted from 1 May 2011.\n\nEU15\n\nThe EU15 consists of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Republic of Ireland, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\n\nInternational Passenger Survey (IPS)\n\nThe International Passenger Survey (IPS) is a survey of a random sample of passengers entering and leaving the UK by air, sea or the Channel Tunnel. Between 700,000 and 800,000 people are interviewed on the IPS each year.\n\nLong-Term International Migration (LTIM)\n\nLong-Term International Migration (LTIM) estimates are produced by combining migration data from the IPS, Home Office data on asylum seekers, migration to and from Northern Ireland (from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency) and adjustments for visitor switchers and migrant switchers.\n\nNationality\n\nNationality is often used interchangeably with citizenship, and some datasets refer to ‘nationals’ of a country rather than ‘citizens’. Different datasets have different ways of establishing someone’s nationality. The APS, which underlies the population estimates by nationality, simply asks people ‘what is your nationality?’ However, the IPS, NINo and entry clearance visa data are based on nationality according to passport held.\n\nNew Commonwealth (ONS Statistical Grouping)\n\nThe New Commonwealth statistical grouping consists of African Commonwealth countries (Botswana, Cameroon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe), Indian subcontinent countries (Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka), and other Commonwealth countries in the Asian, Caribbean, and Oceania regions.\n\nIt also includes British Dependent Territories and British Overseas citizens. Up to and including 2003 Malta and Cyprus are included in the New Commonwealth grouping. For 2004, the year of accession, they are included in the EU. Malta and Cyprus are members of both the Commonwealth and the European Union from May 2004 onwards. However, for estimation purposes they have only been included in the EU grouping for 2004 onwards.\n\nRwanda was admitted to the Commonwealth in November 2009, but the definition for this statistical grouping has remained unchanged. Zimbabwe withdrew from the Commonwealth in December 2003, but again the definition for this grouping also remained unchanged following this.\n\nNon-visa nationals\n\nNon-visa nationals are nationals who do not require a visa to enter the UK. European Economic Area (EEA) nationals do not normally require a visa to enter the UK (although a small number of EEA nationals do apply and are issued visas). Additionally, for those non-EEA nationals classified as ‘non-visa nationals’ (e.g. citizens of the USA, Brazil and Japan) a visa is not normally required for visits of less than 6 months. There are two ways in which non-visa nationals can enter the UK for work and study purposes without a visa. Non-visa nationals are allowed to work in the UK without a visa, but only for sporting or creative work of less than 3 months duration, this falling outside the scope of the UN definition of a short term migrant. However, for study there are many more admitted into the UK under the student visitor scheme than visas issued as non-visa nationals are allowed to study under the scheme for up to 6 months without a requirement for a visa.\n\nOld Commonwealth (ONS Statistical Grouping)\n\nThe Old Commonwealth statistical grouping consists of four countries: Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa.\n\nPoints Based System (PBS) – Study\n\nThe Points-Based System (PBS) in part rationalised the immigration control processes for people coming into the UK for study. The PBS has five “tiers”, one of which (Tier 4) provides a route for students to study with an approved education provider. Tier 4 was implemented in March 2009. Data shown for Study includes visas issued under Tiers 4 and pre-PBS equivalents.\n\nPoints Based System (PBS) – Work\n\nFrom 2008, the Points-Based System (PBS) in part rationalised the immigration control processes for non-EEA nationals coming into the UK for work. Four of the five Tiers (Tiers 1, 2, 3 and 5) relate to permission to work:\n\nTier 1 provides a route for high value individuals\n\nTier 2 provides a route for skilled workers with a job offer\n\nTier 3 relates to unskilled workers (never implemented)\n\nTier 5 is for temporary workers and youth mobility schemes\n\nThe figures shown for work include visas issued under Tiers 1, 2, 5 and pre-PBS equivalents, as well as data for work categories which were not incorporated into the PBS, in particular overseas domestic workers (17,000 visas issued in 2013) and the UK Ancestry route (4,000 visas issued in 2013).\n\nStatistical significance\n\nThe International Passenger Survey interviews a sample of passengers passing through ports within the UK. As with all sample surveys, the estimates produced from them are based upon one of a number of different samples that could have been drawn at that point in time. This means that there is a degree of variability around the estimates produced. This variability sometimes may present misleading changes in figures as a result of the random selection of those included in the sample. If a change or a difference between estimates is described as 'statistically significant', it means that statistical tests have been carried out to reject the possibility that the change has occurred by chance. Therefore statistically significant changes are very likely to reflect real changes in migration patterns.\n\nStudent visitor\n\nThe student visitor provisions allow for individuals to come to the UK to undertake short courses/periods of no more than six months at a specified type of educational institution. Unlike Tier 4 this study can be at any level and does not have to lead to a qualification. In addition to the six month route there is a concession for those studying English language courses longer than six months in duration, which allows individuals to study on English language courses up to 11 months in duration. The intention of these provisions is to enable an individual to study up to the level required to qualify for Tier 4 of the points-based system.\n\nBack to table of contents"
