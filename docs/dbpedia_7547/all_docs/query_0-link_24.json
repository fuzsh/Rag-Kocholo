The 115-island country, whose capital is Victoria, lies 1,500 kilometres east of mainland East Africa.\n\nOther nearby island countries and territories include the Comoros, Mayotte (region of France), Madagascar, RÃ©union (region of France) and Mauritius to the south.\n\nWith a population of roughly 92,000, it has the smallest population of any sovereign African country; however, it does have a larger population than the British overseas territory Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.\n\nAfter proclamation of independence from the United Kingdom in 1976, Seychelles has developed from a largely agricultural society to a market-based diversified economy, with agriculture being supplanted by rapidly rising service and public sectors as well as tourism.\n\nSince 1976, per capita output has increased nearly sevenfold. [R1]\n\nThe first stamps marked Seychelles were issued on 5 April 1890 and were of a Queen Victoria key type design. A number of different issues followed, all of the same design, including surcharges in 1893 and 1901. [R2]\n\nAs of 2021, Seychelles has not issued any stamp directly related to paleontology.\n\nSome stamps of Seychelles to consider: HMS Beagle\n\n21.12.1976 \"200th anniversary of American independence\" [A1] 27.02.1981\"Ships\" [A2]\n\nNotes:\n\nThomas Jefferson on stamp of Seychelles 1976 MiNr.: 376, Scott: 371 HMS Beagle on stamp of Seychelles 1981 MiNr.: 476, Scott: 466\n\n[A1] One of these stamps shows 3rd American president Thomas Jefferson who is also known and the âFather of American Paleontologyâ.\n\nThomas Jefferson is rightfully renowned as the principal author of the Declaration of Independence, the Third President of the United States, and a champion of Liberty. But he was also a central player in the beginnings of American paleontology. In addition, his participation occurred at a time when people were struggling with the ideas of fossils as evidence of past life, of extinction, and of an Earth far older than the Biblical account.\n\nSome of the fruits of Jefferson's paleontology became part of the collections at the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia. Beginning in 1849 these holdings were transferred over to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, where they are currently housed.\n\nUSA stamp of Thomas Jefferson issued in 1851 is the first Paleontology related stamp ever.\n\nSince then, many stamps depicting Thomas Jefferson have been issued by the USA and many other countries around the world.\n\n[A2] HMS Beagle shown on one of the stamps.\n\nHMS Beagle was a Cherokee-class 10-gun brig-sloop of the Royal Navy, one of more than 100 ships of this class. On the second voyage a young naturalist named Charles Darwin was on board; the pivotal role this round the world voyage played in forming his scientific theories made Beagle one of the most famous ships in history.\n\nDarwin had kept a diary of his experiences and rewrote this as the book titled Journal and Remarks, published in 1839 as the third volume of the official account of the expedition. This travelogue and scientific journal was widely popular, and was reprinted many times with various titles, becoming known as The Voyage of the Beagle. This diary is where Darwin drew most of the ideas for his publications. Darwin attributes his first real training in natural history to his voyage on the Beagle.
