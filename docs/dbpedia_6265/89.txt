PETITIONS

Law and Order

Senator CAVANAGH:

SOUTH AUSTRALIA

– I present from 115 citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia the following petition:

To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully sheweth:

That they are gravely concerned at the apparent appalling increase in crime in Australia, particularly in densely populated areas.

That they fear the police forces of the various States and Territories are undermanned and underequipped to handle the increase in crime.

That their concern is aggravated by the apparent number of unsolved crimes, particularly those involving violence to the individual, including murder.

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Honourable Members of the Senate will seek to ensure that the Comonwealth Government will seek the co-operation of the States and supply extra finance to the Stales to enable:

Proper town planning and development to halt the increase in densely populated areas which leads to increased crime;

the proper staffing and equipping of police forces to enable adequate crime prevention and detection measures to reduce the frightening increase of both solved and unsolved crime;

the proper detention and rehabilitation of criminals; and

compensation to victims of crimes of violence.

And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.

Petition received and read.

Export of Merino Rains

Senator Douglas McClelland:

NEW SOUTH WALES · ALP

– I present from 48 electors of New South Wales the following petition:

To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the electors of New South Wales respectfully sheweth:

That the decision of the Government to lift the 40-year ban on the export of merino rams will do irreparable harm to the present and future merino wool industry of Australia.

That the initial quota of 300 rams will be sufficient to make any future protest worthless.

That the production of fine-medium quality merino wool in cheap labour countries will put the Australian merino woolgrower and all connected with this industry out of business.

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will -

Review its policy and cause to be held a referendum ofwoolgrowers to determine this issue. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.

Petition received and read.

Social Services

Senator DRURY:

SOUTH AUSTRALIA

-I present from 274 citizens of the State of South Australia the following petition:

To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of South Australia respectfully sheweth:

That due to the higher living com, persons on social service pensions are finding it extremely difficulty to live in even the most frugal way.

We therefore call upon the Commonwealth Government to increase the base pension rate to 30 per cent of the average weekly male earnings for all States, as ascertained by the Commonwealth Statistician, plus supplementary assistance and allowances in accordance with A.C.T.U. policy and adopted as the policy of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners Federation, and by doing so give a reasonably moderate pension.

Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate and the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will take immediate steps to bring about the wishes expressed in our petition so that our citizens receiving the social service pensions may live their lives in dignity.

And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.

Petition received and read.

Senator Douglas Scott:

NEW SOUTH WALES · CP; NCP from May 1975

– I present from 419 citizens of the Commonwealth the following petition:

To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:

That they are gravely concerned at what they consider to be the adverse effect on moral standards in the Australian community of the increasing portrayal and description of obscenity, sexual licence, promiscuity and violence in films, books, magazines, plays and, to a lesser extent, television and radio programmes;

That their concern arises partly from the fact that historians such as J. D. Unwin and Arnold Toynbee have shown that nearly all nations which have perished have done so because of internal moral decay; and partly because obscenity and indecency are contrary to the teachings of Christianity which is the acknowledged religion of more than 80 per cent of Australians, besides being ‘part and parcel of the law of the land’ (Quick and Garran in “Commentaries on the Australian Constitution,’ Page 951); and

That, in accordance with the findings of the Australian Gallup Poll, published in the Melbourne Herald 14th November 1969, the majority of Australian citizens want censorship either maintained or increased -

Your Petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should seek to ensure that Commonwealth legislation bearing on censorship of films. literature and radio and television programmes is so framed and so administered as to preserve sound moral standards in the community.

And your Petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.

To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. This Petition of the undersigned residents of Norfolk Island respectfully showeth:

Concern at the possible loss of the special character of a unique island being opened up by a jet strip and the consequent over development and side effects of a large tourist influx.

We would request answers to the following questions:

Has a decision been made on the size and type of aircraft required.

If a decision has been made, on what information and facts was this type chosen, and in particular what tourist numbers wen anticipated.

Has consideration been given to a smaller aircraft type based on Norfolk Island’s present airstrip, population, unique char cater, size and conservation.

Your petitioners pray that the Senate du all in itspower to prevent the destruction of the special character of Norfolk Island by unplanned ove development.

QUESTION

CIVIL AVIATION: NORFOLK ISLAND

Senator MURPHY:

– Will the Minister for Civil Aviation supply to the Senate some answer to the questions raised in the petition from the residents of Norfolk Island which I have just presented? If he is able to supply some of the information now, it will be appreciated; otherwise will he bring a statement on those matters into the Senate before it rises?

Senator COTTON:

Minister for Civil Aviation · NEW SOUTH WALES · LP

– I have not been to Norfolk Island for about 24 years but I remember it quite well. When I was there last it was a most beautiful place and quite unique in many ways. The airstrip was then - I imagine that it still is - on fairly high ground. I am not aware of the problem that is referred to in the petition. We are not the only people using the airstrip on Norfolk Island. There is quite a common pattern of flying from New Zealand through Norfolk Island to both Noumea and Fiji. I will endeavour to obtain information for Senator Murphy prior to the Senate rising, so that he may have some of the questions in the petition answered. Also, 1 imagine, this has something to do with the commercial needs of the operators, of which we are one only, flying to Norfolk Island. Equally there are requirements of the tourist industry to be served. I would want to satisfy myself as to the total base of the objection and to know whether il was from some people only or from the community as a whole. The honourable senator has my assurance that I shall do what I can to find out as much as I can for him.

QUESTION

MEAT EXPORTS

Senator LILLICO:

TASMANIA

– Has the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry noted in at least one Tasmanian newspaper allegations of instances of corruption among Department of Primary Industry inspectors engaged in the inspection of meat for export? Will the Minister have these charges investigated and, in particular, call upon the persons making them to substantiate them?

Senator DRAKE-BROCKMAN:

Minister for Air · WESTERN AUSTRALIA · CP

– This matter was drawn to my attention this morning. I referred it to the Department of Primary Industry which at present is investigating the allegations. I cannot say more than that.

page 1551

QUESTION

IMMIGRATION

Senator MULVIHILL:

NEW SOUTH WALES

– I address a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration. Does yesterday’s deportation of Mr Ho Kum Weng pinpoint the present complex situation existing in Sydney as regards competent Chinese chefs for the expanding Chinese restaurant circuit? Does the Department of Immigration make surveys of such restaurant requirements and balance them against applications lodged in Hong Kong for replacements? What are the mechanics of such vetting by

Australian Immigration officers in Hong Kong? If applications from Hong Kong are limited, what attitude does the Department adopt towards Chinese chefs from Malaysia?

Senator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:

– I have quite a deal of information on this subject and I think it advisable that I give all this information to the honourable senator. Mr Ho, a Malaysian citizen, was admitted in May 1969 under temporary entry permit as a visitor for a 4-month stay. He was not admitted for employment as a chef. His continued stay was the subject of repeated representations to the Minister who considered the matter carefully on no less than 5 occasions. Mr Ho was given, first a 6 months extension of his visit until March 1970, and then a final 3 months extension until June 1970. Upon the expiration of this extension he became a prohibited immigrant. Despite repeated requests to Mr Ho to leave Australia he failed to do so. He was informed that continued refusal to leave would result in deportation. This had no result. The Minister then ordered his deportation, and he was detained yesterday for the purpose of early deportation to Malaysia.

Mr Ho’s brother, Mr Hoppy Hoo, a former student allowed to settle here after marriage to an Australian, had opened a restaurant in 1969 and wanted Mr Ho to remain permanently to assist him. Mr Ho does not have the level of qualifications required for settlement in Australia under immigration policy as reviewed in 1966. Policy permits the entry for 2 years of chefs for employment in restaurants providing authentic Asian meals requiring preparation by highly-trained chefs. This is in line with policy concerning the entry of specialist workers generally and cannot be extended to allow the large and growing number of Chinese restaurants in Australia to bring in staff to prepare less difficult meals. Mr Hoppy Hoo’s restaurant did not meet the requirements of the policy in question.

The Department does not make surveys of these very numerous restaurants to ascertain their labour requirements. Each application by a restaurant is considered individually. If the restaurant itself qualifies to have an overseas chef for 2 years, the proprietor names the particular chef whom he wants to introduce, whether from Hong Kong, Malaysia or elsewhere, and the overseas post in the country concerned checks that particular person’s experience as a chef.

QUESTION

EXPORTS OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS

Senator LAWRIE:

QUEENSLAND · CP; NCP from May 1975

– Has the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry seen a report that the British Government is to place duties and quotas on some exports of primary products from Australia to the United Kingdom? What effect is this decision likely to have on our export trade to the United Kingdom and on some of our primary industries?

Senator DRAKE-BROCKMAN:

CP

– I believe that the speech on this subject was made by the Chancellor of the British Exchequer. I am not aware of the details contained in the report or in the speech. 1 point out to the honourable senator that quotas exist on the British market at the present time in regard to butter and cheese. I am not aware of whether these quotas will be increased, but I do understand that the Minister for Trade and Industry, and probably his representative in this place, will be making a statement on this matter later today.

page 1552

QUESTION

AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY

Senator DEVITT:

TASMANIA

– I ask the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior whether his attention has been drawn to an article in today’s Press, and attributed to the Minister for the Interior, which states that reassessments of properties in the Australian Capital Territory henceforth will be done at 3-year intervals. Was this information available on Monday night last? If so, why was it not made known at the time of the debate which was then taking place on this subject? If it was not then known but has been decided since, does this not indicate that details of the proposed new land tenure system are being worked out from day to day and justify the strongly held view in the Canberra community that the plan is by no means clear cut and its consequences therefore not precisely predictable, despite the many assurances we have been given to tha contrary?

Senator COTTON:

LP

– I would have thought that Monday night’s debate had cleared up all the matters that Senator

Devitt was concerned about in relation to this issue. It was very thoroughly canvassed indeed. The statement given to me by the Minister to pass on to the Senate was quite exhaustively prepared. Also, the Minister’s officers gave out a great deal of information. I am surprised to learn from today’s Press and Senator Devitt that there is still some dissatisfaction. All I can do in these circumstances is to ask the Minister what is the position, and I shall do that.

QUESTION

AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING COMMISSION

Senator MARRIOTT:

TASMANIA

– My question, which is supplementary to one I asked yesterday, is addressed to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General. Advertisements appear in Australian news papers today stating that a parliamentary Party leader will have his Senate election campaign policy speech broadcast over all Australian Broadcasting Commission stations tonight. Can the Minister give any information as to whether these advertisements are statements of fact? Would it not be a breach of the law regarding the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Parliament - the proceedings of the Senate should be broadcast tonight - if all ABC stations broadcast a Party political policy speech? Is it known whether the broadcast has been prerecorded? Or will Mr Whitlam be absent from his place as leader of the Australian Labor Party in the House of Representatives tonight?

Senator Murphy:

– I rise on a point of order. I ask you, Mr President, to reject the last part of the question on the ground that the Senate should not be dealing in any way with the conduct of an eminent member of the other House as related to his presence in or absence from tha*. House.

The PRESIDENT:

– J uphold that point of view. That is quite right. The actions of the Leader of the Opposition in the other place should not be questioned. The Minister may answer only the first part of the question.

Senator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:

– The honourable senator asked me a question concerning this matter yesterday. The information I have is that tonight the Australian Broadcasting Commission will broadcast the proceedings of the Parliament on the first network and the policy speech of the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives on the second and third networks. I am unable to inform the senator of any details of the broadcast.

QUESTION

JUMBO JETS

Senator BISHOP:

SOUTH AUSTRALIA

– Has the Minister for Civil Aviation, his Department or Qantas Airways Ltd investigated the current controversy in the United States of America over the fact that Boeing jumbo jet engines are subject to overheating? Has his Department or Qantas had cause to note that on three occasions recently the engines of this type of aircraft have caught fire? If information is available, will the Minister make it available to the Senate?

Senator COTTON:

LP

– Yes, we have watched this matter very closely indeed. The Department of Civil Aviation’ has permanently located in Washington an Air Attache whose job it is to be on the ball all the time in relation to these matters. Anything of this kind is taken up immediately. We have been watching this very closely, as indeed I am quite sure Qantas has. Although Qantas has not reported on this matter to me, I know that that airline would be watching the position. I will endeavour to obtain the current information for the honourable senator. I may not obtain it before the Senate lifts. If I cannot I will have a letter written to him abou! it.

page 1553

QUESTION

SENATE ELECTION

Senator LAWRIE:

QUEENSLAND · CP; NCP from May 1975

– Has the Minister for Air seen an inaccurate report in the ‘Australian’ newspaper of today’s date that he will not be a candidate for the coming Senate elections on 2 1 st November? Will he make his position clear so that the electors of Western Australia will be assured that they are to have the advantage of retaining an honourable senator experienced in the administration of Government?

Senator DRAKE-BROCKMAN:

CP

– I assure the honourable senator that I will not be retiring from the Senate. I think everyone in this place realises that because of the complex system of Senate elections under which only half of the Senate representatives retire every 3 years, a lot of people, including apparently the editor of the article in today’s ‘Australian’, are unaware that the terms of service of half of the sitting senators expire on 30th June next. I point out that those same senators who retire are eligible for re-election. I assure the honourable senator that the people of Western Australia will have the advantage of retaining an experienced senator. Furthermore I point out that I am the only Government senator from Western Australia who is seeking re-election and I am the only Federal Minister representing Western Australia.

page 1554

QUESTION

PRIMARY INDUSTRY

Senator MURPHY:

– Does the Minister who just spoke and who represents the Minister for Primary Industry recall that in April of this year he brought into this chamber by way of amendment a proposal in which he stated on behalf of the Government that the most appropriate way to deal wilh the problems of the rural industries was to set up industry sponsored committees of inquiry into those problems? Will the Minister tell us how many industry sponsored committees of inquiry have been set up since he proposed them to the Senate in April of this year?

Senator DRAKE-BROCKMAN:

CP

– The honourable senator was quick on his feet after I had sat down to try to get in some propaganda on this matter. I point out to him that a number of industry sponsored committees have been set up. “They are going on all the time. I think the best example is the recent wool inquiry. I point out that the dried fruits industry is presently having an inquiry.

Senator Murphy:

– lt is a simple question. Can the honourable senator not answer it?

Senator DRAKE-BROCKMAN:

– I will not answer it if the honourable senator keeps on interjecting all the time.

Senator Marriott:

– Is not the Leader of the Opposition out of order?

Senator DRAKE-BROCKMAN:

– I would have thought so. I shall start again. I point out to the Leader of the Opposition that the wool industry has just had a very good inquiry. The advisory committee of the Australian Wool Board conducted an inquiry together with the leaders of the industry. The Minister has appointed a first class man with long experience, Sir John Crawford, to assist the industry. The Australian Apple and Pear Board which is holding its federal conference in Tasmania tomorrow has conducted a thorough inquiry into the industry with representatives of the Department of Primary Industry. The dried fruits industry Ls still going through a long inquiry following the rejection of the stabilisation scheme last March. Those are 3 examples for the honourable senator.

35-HOUR WEEK

Senator YOUNG:

SOUTH AUSTRALIA

– I direct my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Would a 35-hour week add considerably to the cost structure of Australia adding greatly to the cost of living and adversely affecting primary industry and other sections of industry, particularly those which are developing an export trade? Does the Minister know whether the Australian Labor Party supports the policy of the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Hawke, for the introduction of a 35-hour week?

Senator Sir KENNETH ANDERSON:

I believe - and I do not think it is arguable on an economic basis - that a 35-hour week, which would have a profound effect upon productivity, would have a disastrous effect on the economy unless there were a corresponding buildup of productivity. I do not think that is arguable. In view of the fact that shortly a matter of urgency will be debated, I have no doubt that I will have an opportunity to expand that argument. I also have some information as to where the Australian Labor Party stands on the introduction of a 35-hour week. I will bring that out at a later hour of the day. I will be able to produce documented evidence about where the Labor Party stands.

page 1554

QUESTION

HEALTH

Senator FITZGERALD:

NEW SOUTH WALES

– Can the Minister representing the Minister for Health advise whether the Government is making any attempt to extend the pensioner health services to cover all injuries and illnesses affecting pensioners? ls the Minister aware that the present health services for pensioners do not include specialist treatment, treatment for numerous complaints, general anaesthetics operations and the setting of fractures? Is it a fact that a pensioner who is treated by a doctor who is not a member of the hospital scheme has to pay for such services as well as the hospital charges? Would not the Minister agree that sudden illness and accidents happen to pensioners and that they should not be burdened financially because of such difficulties? Will she do everything in her power to broaden the pensioner health services to overcome such extenuating circumstances?

Senator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:

– The honorable senator has asked a very important question. I shall get a detailed reply about the particular services.

page 1555

QUESTION

NORTHERN TERRITORY

Senator KEEFFE:

QUEENSLAND

– Can the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior inform the Senate whether the police officer at Wave Hill in the Northern Territory has established a trading post? If the answer is in the affirmative, does the establishment of a trading post under such circumstances have the approval of the Department of the Interior?

Senator COTTON:

LP

– I certainly would not know whether that was an accurate comment. I shall have to obtain information. I offer the observation that a number of similar propositions which have been advanced previously have, on inquiry, been found not to he correct.

page 1555

QUESTION

DRUGS

Senator CAVANAGH:

– I ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Customs and Excise. Does the Dangerous Drugs Act of South Australia make illegal the possession of drugs to which the Act applies and which are named in section 4 of the Act? Is the only drug named in section 4 as a derivative of the cannabis sativa plant an extract or tincture of Indian hemp? As marihuana, smoked as pot in Australia, is the leaves of the cannabis plant and not an extract or tincture, how does it become an offence in South Australia to be in possession of Australiangrown marihuana, as stated in the Minister’s reply to question No. 704 asked by Senator Poyser?

Senator COTTON:

LP

– I am not a South Australian, although I am very fond of that State. My forebears came from it. I have a great admiration for practically all its people. I am not a member of the South Australian Parliament. Therefore, I am not familiar with its Acts. I remember reading, on behalf of the Minister for Cus toms and Excise, the appropriate answer. 1 remember it contained some reference to marihuana. I am indebted to Senator Cavanagh for supplying extra information, but I shall have to ask the responsible Minister whether he can supply Senator Cavanagh with information as to what the South Australian Act means and as to its intentions. Again I will try to get this information before the Senate lifts.

35-HOUR WEEK

Senator BISHOP:

– My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. It refers to the answer that he gave to Senator Young about the 35-hour week. ls the Minister aware that a tripartite body appointed by the National Labour Advisory Council, which is a body set up by the Government, has recently sent out a study of the effects of automation and technological changes on workers? The study lists a number of changes which automation would bring to highly productive industries. They would perform the job of production much quicker than heretofore. The study recommends certain conferences between employers and employees in connection with these changes. If the Leader of the Government is aware of the changes, why did he not mention the fact that studies conducted by the Department of Labour and National Service indicate that mechanisation and automation necessitate consideration of a shorter working week?

Senator Sir KENNETH ANDERSON:

The honourable senator’s question has no relationship to the question I was asked by Senator Young. Senator Bishop is trying to justify a 35-hour week. It is an interesting exercise in that context. However, the fact of the matter is that I was asked a question by Senator Young on a particular subject and I replied to it. I suggest to Senator Bishop that he be a little patient because more will be said on this subject later in the day.

QUESTION

NORTHERN TERRITORY

Senator KEEFFE:

QUEENSLAND · ALP

– My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior. In reply to my last question the Minister said that complaints which had been raised by me in previous questions concerning the treatment of Aboriginals in the Northern Territory had proved on investigation to be without substance. I ask the Minister whether he will cite the cases and the questions involved.

Senator COTTON:

LP

– It will be my pleasure to look up this matter and inform Senator Keeffe. I distinctly remember a reply to a question he asked a little while ago which in effect said that the allegations he had made were incorrect.

QUESTION

PETROLEUM (SUBMERGED LANDS) ACT

(Question No. 567)

Senator CANT:

WESTERN AUSTRALIA

asked the Minister repre senting the Minister for National Development, upon notice:

Has the Joint Committee of Ministers for Mines agreed to amendments to sections 9 and 101 of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967-1968; if so, when was the agreement arrived at.

Has the Joint Committee of AttorneysGeneral agreed upon the terms of the aforesaid amendments; if so, when was the agreement arrived at, and is it a fact that the Parliament of the State of South Australia enacted amendments to its corresponding legislation in November 1969.

Have any other States of the Commonwealth enacted or agreed to enact amendments in similar terms to those enacted by South Australia; if so, when was such action taken or is it likely to be taken.

Was the unilateral action taken by the State of South Australia in conformity with the spirit and intent of clause 6 of the Agreement relating to the exploration for, and exploitation of, petroleum resources: if so, why has ten months elapsed without any action being taken by the other States and the Commonwealth.

Senator COTTON:

LP

– The Minister for National Development has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:

There is no Joint Committee of Ministers for Mines. There is however the Australian Minerals Council, consisting of the Commonwealth Ministers for National Development, Interior and External Territories (the latter observer status) and the State Ministers for Mines. This Council has not considered the proposed amendments in formal session.

1 am advised by the Attorney-General that at its meeting in Hobart on 7th March 1969, the Sanding Committee of Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General considered doubts that had been expressed as to the effectiveness of the Application of Laws’ provisions. The Committee was of the opinion that the doubts that had been raised were not necessarily valid, but that it was desirable that the legislation should be made as clear as possible. The Committee approved draft Commonwealth and State Bills that had been prepared for discussion at the March meeting. These draft Bills were concurred in by correspondence between the Department of National Development and the State Mines Departments. It is true that the State of South Australia enacted amendments to its legislation in November, 1969.

Thus the Commonwealth and all the States had agreed to enact legislation similar to that which has already been passed in South Australia. An amending Bill has been passed by the West Australian Legislative Council and is currently before the Legislative Assembly of that State. The Commonwealth legislation will be introduced into Parliament when the legislative programme so permits.

1 believe it is correct to say that me agreement reached by the Law Ministers at Hobart in March, 1969, was regarded by all Governments as constituting compliance with Clause 6 of the Offshore Petroleum Agreement. With regard to the time which has elapsed since the Law Ministers agreed on this matter, a submission was placed before Cabinet in 1969, but not dealt with during the life of the previous Ministry. A further submission was approved by Cabinet early this year but the legislative programme did not permit of a Bill being introduced in the Autumn sittings.

QUESTION

CIVIL MARRIAGES

(Question No. 462)

Senator MURPHY:

asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice:

What, if anything, is being done by the Attorney-General to ensure that full facilities are provided for civil marriages during reasonable hours at night and week-ends, and at places additional to registry offices.

Senator WRIGHT:

Minister for Works · TASMANIA · LP

– The AttorneyGeneral has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:

Under present administrative arrangements all civil marriages except those in remote areas are solemnised by appropriate State or Territory officers. I think that these arrangements should continue. The times when the officers of a State are available to solemnise marriages is a matter of concern to the State. All States, except Queensland, are now providing extended facilities cor civil marriage ceremonies, at least in the capital city registry offices, on Saturdays and. in the case of one State, on occasional week day evenings. I am informed that in the case of Queensland, there are practical difficulties in the way of opening the Brisbane registry office on Saturdays. The matter is however, being further pursued with that State.

QUESTION

FOOTWEAR

(Question No. 552)

Senator MILLINER:

QUEENSLAND

asked the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Industry, upon notice:

What methods are proposed to be employed against the importation of such sub-standard articles as certain plastic footwear presently being imported, in order that the Australian public may be protected.

Senator Sir KENNETH ANDERSON:

– The Minister for Trade and Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:

There are requirements under the Commerce (Imports) Regulations that imported non-rubber footwear be indelibly branded, on the outer surface of each sole, stating the material of which the soles are composed. The regulation was imposed by the Government to protect the interests of the consumers.

A large proportion of the non-leather footwear sold in Australia is manufactured locally. Local consumers are therefore able to make a choice between the purchase of locally made or imported footwear. No doubt, the brand showing the material of construction of the soles would assist buyers to assess the quality and durability of imported footwear.

The Tariff Board has recently made a report on the non-leather footwear industry which dealt in some detail with imports of plastic footwear. During the inquiry the Board received evidence on behalf of Australian manufacturers, overseas suppliers and local users. The Board’s report, which was released on 4th August 1970, contained no reference to imports of sub-standard articles of footwear.

ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY

(Question No. 737)

Senator KEEFFE:

asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Navy upon notice:

What has been the total cost of all repairs to HMAS ‘Melbourne’ from 1 January 1965 to date.

What were the total number of seamen killed and injured as a result of collisions, or other accidents in which HMAS ‘Melbourne’ has been involved from 1 January 1965 to date.

Senator DRAKE-BROCKMAN:

CP

– The Minister for the Navy has provided the following answers tothe honourable senator’s questions:

Since the 1st January 1965 collision repairs totalling $538,000 have been carried out on HMAS ‘Melbourne’.

The collision with the USS Frank E. Evans on 3rd June, 1969 resulted in the loss of 74 USN personnel and 32 injured. There were no fatalities among HMAS ‘Melbourne’s’ personnel but 25 suffered minor injuries, mainly sprains and cuts resulting from the rescue operations. Additionally, accidents involving aircraft operating from HMAS Melbourne’ have resulted in two deaths and one injury during the period in question.

QUESTION

DRUGS

(Question No. 739)

Senator GEORGES:

QUEENSLAND

asked the Minister representing the Minister for Customs and Excise, upon notice:

In view of the recent serious thefts which have transferred a vast quantity of dangerous drugs from the legal market to the illegal market and having in mind the danger to the community, especially young people, of the illicit trafficking in drugs and the fact that large surpluses of drugs have been accumulated because of recent State legislation, will the Department of Customs and Excise take urgent action to have these surpluses destroyed in order to avoid the possibility of further thefts.

Senator COTTON:

LP

– The Minister for Customs and Excise has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:

The Department of Customs and Excise has no powers that would enable it to destroy surplus stocks of drugs legally held in the possession of wholesalers and retailers againstthe wishes of the owners of the goods.

The recent State legislation referred to by the honourable senator relates to the placing of restrictions on the prescribing by doctors of amphetamine, dexamphetamine, methylamphetamine and, in some States, phenmetrazine.

Because of these restrictions retailers have been returning their surplus stocks to the wholesalers. In this regard it is known that the State Health Departments are receiving the full co-operation of the wholesalers in reducing their stocks of these drugs to an acceptable level. Large quantities have been re-exported and further quantities have been destroyed under the supervision of officers of the State Health Departments.

I understand that stocks of these drugs are not now excessive.

QUESTION

SHIPPING

(Question No. 618)

Senator KENNELLY:

VICTORIA

asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Transport, upon notice:

Is it a fact that freight rateson wool exported to Britain and Europe recently rose by 4 per cent; if so, what reason does the Government have for not invoking the shipping provisions of the Trade Practices Act to prevent such an increase?

As this increase will cost woolgrowers an extra $4m for the export season 1970-71 and will, as Mr W. P. Nicholas, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Woolgrowers’ and Graziers” Council states, be passed on to the consumer, what part did the Government take in negotiations leading to this freight rise, as the Government has a vested interest in the Shipping Conference, through the Australian National Line?

Is the Australian National Line free to fix its own freight rates, when it carries Australian exports, particularly wool, butter, wheat and other primary products?

Senator COTTON:

LP

– The Minister for Shipping and Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:

Yes - during the negotiations on these rates jn Australia in recent months, the Australia to Europe Shippers’ Association (AESA) maintained there should be a standstill on all rates. The shipping Conference pressed for an initial Hi per cent increase, although it did concede that some concession should be made with respect to wool.

At the request of Interlaine and the British Wool Federation, the principals of the owners of Australian wool at shipment from Australia, negotiations were entered into with the Conference in Paris following the talks between AESA and OSRA in Australia. At the Paris meeting both AWGC and the Australian woolbuyers were represented and it appears that without the disagreement of these representatives the freight increase of 4 per cent for wool was settled.

The increase was stated to be subject to ratification by the AESA, but it has not been so ratified.

Representatives of Interlaine and the British Wool Federation in Europe at a meeting with Conference during the last week in August, agreed to instruct the Australian woolbuyers to sign contracts for shipment on the basis of the 4 per cent increase in freights for wool.

While the Government cannot be happy at the settlement of freight rates outside Australia for Australia’s principal export commodity, it must be recognised that Australian woolgrowers, who do not own wool at time of shipment, have only very restricted rights to negotiate freight rates.

The Government has no direct status in what are essentially commercial negotiations between shippers and shipowners. The Trade Practices Act provides a framework within which these negotiations can take place between the Conference and the Shipper Body designated by the Minister - in this case AESA.

Under the Act shipowners are obliged to negotiate with the shipper body, and to make available information which is reasonably necessary for the conduct of the negotiations. They must also permit an officer of the Department of Trade and

Industry to be present at these negotiations. In the present case such an officer was present and kept me, in my then capacity as Acting Minister for Trade and Industry, informed.

While AESA has maintained its posture for standstill, the Government cannot impose a standstill when the owners of the commodity have accepted the freight increase of 4 per cent and Australian commodity representatives have apparently not opposed it when negotiated in Paris.

As a member of the Australia to Europe Shipping Conference the Australian National Line is obliged to abide by the freight rates established by the Conference. To set its own freight rates, the Line would have to operate outside the Conference. In such circumstances it would be quite impossible for the Line to operate an economic and efficient service on a one container ship basis.

QUESTION

SHIPPING

(Question No. 695)

Senator WRIEDT:

asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Transport, upon notice:

Is it a fact that the Australian National Line has exceeded its present allotted quota in the Australia-Japan trade; if so, by how much, and what reimbursement has been paid to the Conference and how much is currently owing?

Under the Australia-Japan Conference Agreement is the Australian National Line entitled to one-half of the Eastern Searoad Service share of the trade, and is it in fact carrying that amount?

Is a copy of this Agreement available to the public or the Parliament?

Senator COTTON:

LP

– The Minister for Shipping and Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:

In the pool period of 30th June 1970 in respect of the southbound trade, the Australian National Line exceeded its share of the trade as allotted under the existing Conference arrangements. The extent to which the quota was exceeded cannot yet be regarded as being finalised as, at this stage, the figures are still subject to Conference audit. The information, however, is confidential to the Conference members.

Not all the excess is to be repaid as a system of carry forward exists until there is a final settlement of this pool agreement which expires in December 1973. Furthermore, following strong representations by the Line, further adjustments, some retrospective, are expected for the carriage of certain cargoes since the Eastern Searoad Service was commenced.

In the northbound pool, which relates only to wool, the monetary extent of any excess by the

Line will not be known until later this year.However, it is expected to be marginal only.

The principals of the Eastern Searoad Service have signed an operating agreement which is not of any concern to the main Conferences. On a combined basis, the ESS is carrying more than its share allotted by the Conference as is ANL within its internal arrangements with ESS.

The agreement is a commercial document, and as such is confidential to the parties to it who include a Japanese company and an Australian public company as well as the Government’s instrumentality, the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission. It is not therefore available to the public generally, or to the Parliament.

QUESTION

TELEPHONE SERVICES

The Posmaster-General has now furnished the following information in reply:

The revised conditions outlined by the Postmaster-General in his second reading speech on the 18th August 1970, concerning the provision of country telephone services provided that the Post Office will in future meet the construction costs for all telephone exchange line services within a 15 mile radius of the appropriate exchange. In addition these conditions will apply to subscribers who have provided or upgraded their lines to Departmental specifications under the privately constructed plant policy which became operative from the 1st January 1969.

Subscribers located within the IS mile radius who paid for their lines to be constructed by the Department will be refunded the full amount paid. Those whose lines were constructed by other contractors will receive a negotiated figure up to the estimated Departmental cost Subscribers located beyond the 15 mile radius will be entitled to similar reimbursement less a charge of $40 for each quarter mile in excess of 15 miles.

There are cases where primary producers have expended considerable sums in providing telephone line plant since the 1st January 1969.

Subscribers who installed equipment under the privately constructed plant scheme will be notified, and it is not expected that there will be any delay in effecting settlements.

IMMIGRATION

Senator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN

On 15th October 1970 Senator Fitzgerald asked me the following question:

Can the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration advise when the immigration agreement discussed by the Australian Minister for Immigration and the Maltese Government some months ago will bc made available to this Parliament? Can she also advise whether the agreement with Malta will embrace the reciprocal social service benefits that are now granted to people from Brimin and Kew Zealand who intend to reside permanently in Australia as they, like Maltese citizens, are members of the British Commonwealth? The Minister will recall that I have asked this question many limes in the last 3 years since the visit of Mr Mintoff, the former Prime Minister of Malta, who came to Australia for the purpose of having discussions wilh the Australian Government on this matter.

The Minister for Immigration- has now furnished me with the following information:

He expects the new migration agreement with Malta to be available to Parliament as soon as mutually convenient arrangements for the formal signing can be made.

He has informed me also that the reciprocal social service agreements wilh Britain and New Zealand to which the honourable senator referred were not negotiated within the framework of migration agreements.

However, the proposed agreement with Malta expresses the intention of both Governments to study the possibility of reaching an agreement on social service reciprocity in the future.

QUESTION

TRADE PRACTICES: CONSUMER PROTECTION

Formal Motion for Adjournment

The PRESIDENT:

– I have received the following letter from Senator Murphy:

Mr President,

In accordance with Standing Order No. 64 I intend to move today for the purpose of discussing a matter of urgency:

That the Senate at its rising adjourn until tomorrow at 9.55 a.m.’

STATEMENT OF MATTER OF URGENCY

The neglect and refusal of the Government to take effective action to protect the public from unjustified price increases caused by price rigging and other harmful practices.’

LIONEL MURPHY

Is the motion supported? (More than the number of senators required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places)

Senator MURPHY:

Leader of the Opposition · New South Wales

– I move:

I do so for the purpose of debating a matter of urgency, namely:

The neglect and refusal of the Government to lake effective action to protect the public from unjustified price increases caused by price rigging and other harmful practices.

One of the greatest problems facing the Australian public, our rural industries and people engaged in trade and commerce in this country is the unjustified price increase system operating throughout the community. What is the cause of the price increases? There may be a number of causes, some of which may be avoidable and some of which may not. When one looks at what are unjustified increases and what can be done to prevent them, one comes to something which is agreed on all sides - that one of the main factors in bringing about unjustified price increases in the community is the existence of price rigging, collusive arrangements of many kinds and other harmful practices.

Senator Little:

– What are they?

Senator MURPHY:

– If the honourable senator studies the list of them in the trade practices documents he will find the answer to his question. They are arrangements such as monopolisation, persistent price cutting to drive a competitor out of business followed by price increases, and other practices which have been given fancy names. They are vertical arrangements, horizontal arrangements and all sorts of other arrangements. The object of all of them is much the same - that is, to gain control of a market or part of a market and then to engage in a particular kind of price fixing not supervised by any public authority, with no responsibility to anybody but the person engaged in the practice, and to force up prices to the highest level that the market will bear.

As T understand it, there is no contest in this chamber or amongst the political parties as to the existence of those practices. Early in 1960, about 10 years ago, a royal commission conducted an investigation in

Tasmania. It found that the practices 10 which I have referred were rife and extended to all sorts of commodities. The list dealt with by the Tasmanian royal commission was found to include electric lights, beer, bread, tyres and tubes, automotive parts, books, sporting goods, hot water systems, paint, cement, steel pipes, hardboard and plywood, most hardware, cigarettes and tobacco, pharmaceutical goods, footwear, much clothing and drapery and many other goods comprising a large part of the wholesale and retail trade.

This situation was confirmed by inquiries made under the direction of Sir Garfield Barwick, who was then the AttorneyGeneral and is now Chief Justice of the High Court. It was said that these practices were rife. There was hardly a commodity not affected by the existence of these harmful practices. It was agreed on all hands in this Parliament that something ought to be done and that effective laws should be made to protect the people against the operation of these practices, lt was agreed that it would be in the interests of the consumer in general, in the interests of trade and commerce and in the interests of Australia that these practices be dealt with effectively. That was common ground. The Liberal Party, the Australian Country Party, and for that matter the Australian Democratic Labor Party-

Senator Byrne:

– Why say ‘for that matter?

Senator MURPHY:

– Because the other two are the major parties in this Parliament. The Democratic Labor Party is represented by a few senators but on occasions they are a very significant few in this chamber. I mean no slight by using the phrase ‘for that matter’. Perhaps I should have said that for that matter, as I recall the situation, this was supported by the Independent senator in this chamber. Everybody recognises the existence of these practices and knew that they were rife. Everybody agreed that there should be firm laws and firm administration to deal with them.

All of us know what these practices do. It was quite a common experience for people who had anything to do with local government to find collusive tenders submitted for petrol, oil and electrical gear.

Councils would call for tenders and tenders would be put in. But all tenders would be for, say, £57,000, which was our currency at that time - indeed right down to the very penny. Tenders from up to a dozen different firms would be the same. The council concerned would have no option but to accept one of those tenders. Sometimes the tenders varied a little bit. Some firm would put in a tender which was £1 less than the others. In other words the 12 firms involved had decided that this time it was a certain firm’s turn and next time it would be some other firm’s turn. Councils were held to ransom. The same practice operated in the government sphere, State and Federal. The Federal Government attempted to do something about this but there was no doubt that these practices were operating throughout the community against public bodies. The ordinary consumer, the average citizen, had no hope at all. Prices of the commodities which he was buying were fixed. No matter where he bought them he paid the price fixed by these private price fixing authorities for their own benefit. The poor little shop keeper with the corner store was not driving around in a Rolls Royce. He was caught in the system and was trying to survive. Prices were not being fixed by him but by large cartels and monopolies, and they are operating at large today.

These cartels and monopolies have also operated in other countries. Those countries soon realised that they needed strict laws to deal with them. In the United States of America and Canada in the last century, firm laws were introduced to deal with these kinds of practices. There has been some curbing of them but even now the benefits are so great that cartels, syndicates and great corporations in the United States have broken those laws despite the severe penalties. They have been prepared to go to all sorts of fantastic schemes. Some of them are like what you would read in a James Bond story. They communicated with one another in coded words and so forth. These firms have been exposed and penalised.

This shows the profits which are to be made and the incentives there are for people to make great profits by indulging in harmful practices which are extremely injurious to the community and force up the prices of commodities elsewhere. It is clear that action ought to be taken to protect the people. It is the duty of every government to protect the people of the country. Beyond any question, that is its first duty, is it not?

Senator Rae:

– You agree that defence is important, do you not?

Senator MURPHY:

– The honourable senator attempts to divert us by talking about defence. Let us talk about that on another occasion. Here is something that is concerned with a specific matter. We will deal with other matters on another occasion. There is no doubt - this is what the people of Australia as well as the Senate ought to know - that everyone agrees that these practices are going on. Everyone agrees that there ought to be laws against them, lt is the duty of the Government to take action in regard to them. That is why this matter of urgency - the Government’s neglect and refusal to take effective action to deal with unjustified price increases brought about by price rigging and other harmful practices - is raised.

What has been done? Sir Garfield Barwick brought in proposals 10 years ago. When he did that there was an outcry from those who were indulging in restricted practices and making the great profits. For about 5 years nothing was done. At the beginning of 1965 proposals were brought in which were a watered down version of what Sir Garfield Barwick had suggested. As honourable senators know, Sir Garfield Barwick went off to the High Court and became Chief Justice of Australia. Some say that the 2 matters are not connected. At the end of 1965 those watered down proposals came into the Parliament and were dealt with by the House of Representatives. Even then, at the last minute, amendments were moved on behalf of the Government which would have destroyed the legislation entirely; there would have been no benefit at all. When the legislation came into the Senate we were able to delete those last minute amendments and to have at least some kind of legislation passed, although we recognised that it was feeble legislation. We were able to do so with the assistance of the Australian Democratic Labor Party and one of the Government senators who could not stomach what was being done to the legislation. What we did then corrected the law.

What happened after that? The Government bad the Bill, but it said at the time that because of the constitutional doubts about the measure it was necessary for the State parliaments to pass complementary legislation; that is, it was necessary to have similar legislation by the States. One would think: ‘Why should not the States pass such legislation if they are asked to? Here are the representatives of all the parties agreeing that laws are necessary. The Federal Liberal Party and the Federal Country Party say that it is necessary for the States to pass these laws’. The people of Australia would think: ‘There should be no problem about it. Surely the governments and the parliamentarians - State and Federal - will act so as to protect the people’.

But what happened? Only in the States in which the Labor Party was in government was any attempt made to pass that complementary legislation. In Tasmania the Parliament passed the legislation introduced by the then Labor Government. In South Australia, under the Labor Government, the House of Assembly passed the legislation, but it was rejected by the undemocratic Upper House, which is controlled by the Liberal and Country League. Each of the other States, where the Liberal and Country Parties were in control of the government, refused to pass the legislation that they were requested to pass. In Victoria some kind of Bill was passed, but the Victorian Parliament would not pass what was asked of it.

How can there be any justification for the attitude that has been taken? Members of the Liberal and Country Parties cannot divide themselves. It is no use members of the Liberal and Country Parties here saying: ‘We wanted it. We did the right thing. lt was our colleagues in the States who would not do it’. That kind of confidence trick will not deceive the people. Federal and State members of the Liberal and Country Parties are all in the same Parties. They go to the same conferences. They should have taken action there. Are the Federal members going to say that their State colleagues and the State governments that represent the same Parties are injuring the interests of the people against their wishes?

What happened after that? This Government waited until 1967 before it even proclaimed the operative parts of the legislation. The Government would not obtain staff: it would not do anything about the legislation but eventually, after much pushing, it proclaimed the operative parts. Then, as was predicted by me in 1965, we saw the spectacle that one of these companies which was affected by the legislation commenced an action in the High Court. That was the Tasmanian breweries case. Action of this kind was to be expected. The case went on for the major part of a year before one thing was decided, that the tribunal was valid. T have no doubt at all that there will be more test cases which will linger on like the Ansett case did some years ago. Meanwhile, the people’s interests are being injured. The proof of the pudding is, I suppose, really in the eating. We have no effective laws in this regard.

The unjustified price increases go on all over the place. The people are suffering, but the Government tries to divert attention from the matter. The Leader of the Government (Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson) said that he is going to talk about a 35-hour week. By all means let us talk about that at some stage - Government supporters have their own views on that - but we will not solve that problem in this place. One thing is clear: The Government can do something about the price rigging which is going on. It has a duty to do but it will not do it. It will not deceive the people of Australia by trying to divert the discussion to other matters. In an endeavour to do something about this, from time to time I have pressed members of the Government and asked what they are doing about trying to persuade their colleagues in the States to pass complementary legislation. I have asked about this in this chamber, even in the last few weeks. On 29th September of this year I asked Senator Wright, who represents the AttorneyGeneral in this chamber: 1 refer to the announcement made by the Attorney-General of South Australia that we would be introducing legislation complementary to the Commonwealth Trade Practices Act in order to remove any doubts or difficulties about the application of the Act in the State of South Australia.

If I might interpolate, that was for the second time because as soon as the Labor

Party was returned to office in South Australia it tried to do this. I wonder whether the Liberal and Country League in the Upper House in South Australia again will prevent from being passed these laws which are necessary for the protection of the people. My question continued:

I remind the Minister that when the Trade Practices Bill was passed the then AttorneyGeneral of the Commonwealth indicated that it was highly desirable that the States pass such complementary legislation. In view of this, if the Government really desires to combat rising prices and inflation, will the Minister take up with the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth the question of pressing the Liberal and Country Party Governments in the States of Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland to introduce such complementary legislation in order to deal with those restrictive trade practices which, on ail hands, are acknowledged as being a factor in the increase of prices and a cause of intiation?

To his credit, the Minister for Works (Senator Wright) said:

The occasion of the announcement to which the honourable senator referred may be an appropriate lime to renew representations to the other Slate governments to introduce complementary legislation. I am obliged to the honourable senator for the suggestion. I shall convey it to the AttorneyGeneral for his consideration.

I asked another time or two and there was no answer forthcoming. This was not the fault of the Minister in this place. Then Senator Rae, who is on the Minister’s side of the chamber, asked only a few days ago on 20th October-

Senator Mulvihill:

– Who was this?

Senator MURPHY:

– Senator Rae. He asked the same Minister, Senator Wright, who represents the Attorney-General in this place:

My question is directed to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. Can the Minister state now, or will he ascertain and inform the Senate whether the question of State government acceptance of the principles of the trade practices legislation is still on the agenda of the Standing Committee of Commonwealth and State AttorneysGeneral for further discussion? Can the Minister indicate whether any progress is being made in getting governments other than the Tasmanian and South Australian Governments to refer power to enable the Commonwealth legislation to be more effective?

Mr Deputy President, I ask you to listen and to absorb this answer. Senator Wright replied: lt will be recalled that this matter was the subject of a question asked by the Leader of the Opposition on 2 occasions in recent weeks. As recently as yesterday 1 told the honourable senator that I would consult with the AttorneyGeneral and see what the present state of conversations between him and the State AttorneysGeneral was. I had that interview with the Attorney-General last night. All I can tell honourable senators is that this sort of interchange of viewpoint is one which is rather disposed to take an indefinite time. We are not in a position to expect that a definite announcement can be made before the Senate rises.

It is 10 years since Sir Garfield Barwick showed the people of Australia that these practices were harming them. Members of the Government parties agree that this is happening. They agree that the laws should be made to deal with it. I note that the Minister for Works (Senator Wright) has just entered the chamber. I assure him that nothing was said to his discredit during his absence. The attack on this occasion is not directed towards him. He smiles. I think that in his heart he agrees with every word I am saying. I recall, to his credit, that he was the only senator to cross the floor to vote with us on this matter previously. Of course he cannot be independent now and speak as he did then.

How can we justify the fact that for 10 years this Government has just fooled around and has brought in watered down legislation? The legislation is full of secrecy. Some attempt has been made by the Trade Practices Commissioner to say that something is being done. It is all very secret. He says: ‘We cannot really tell you, but we have been looking at some things.’ We know that this legislation was not really designed and not really intended to work. Otherwise why did the Government delay its introduction for years? Why did the Government delay proclaiming the Act? Why has it allowed the situation to continue in which its colleagues in the States will not pass laws which have been asked for for the protection of the people? The Government stands condemned, because it knows that these laws should be put into effective operation. It knows there should be amending legislation to stamp out such practices as resale price maintenance, which is one of the worst features of price rigging. It is not even covered by the legislation, because the Government cannot interfere with those who are providing its financial support. It is as simple as that. That is why it does not do these things.

During this debate the Government will try to talk about anything except this matter. It will talk about a 35-hour week; it will talk about defence; it will talk about anything but its failure to take effective action against price rigging. Everyone is being hurt by it. It has forced up prices to those engaged in rural industry. It is forcing up the costs to the little manufacturers and others. They have to pay more for the commodities they need to convert into other goods. It affects those who use motor vehicles for transport because of the price of petrol, oil and spare parts. This situation is inflating the cost structure.

If the Government would do something about the situation there would not be any problem about a 35-hour week; we all would say that it could easily be afforded. But let us not divert our attention, to these things. We will facilitate a debate on a 35-hour week; we are more concerned about the Government’s failure to protect the people against the price rigging which is rife in this community. Why does the Government allow it to go on when it says in this Parliament that there should be effective administration against it? As between the Federal Government and the State governments there is such inaction, neglect and refusal to act that the public is left wide open to be got at. Members of the public all over Australia are screaming, because they can see what is happening. And they ought to know. If the Government had the will it could do something about it. There are many ways of doing something about it, but something will not be done because this Government will not do it.

Senator Sir KENNETH ANDERSON:

Minister for Supply · New South Wales · LP

(3.24) - We have just heard the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Murphy) make a contribution which is really the next day’s hash of the previous day’s meal in the other place. A proposal was submitted in the other place yesterday which was almost identical in terms to the one submitted here today. Certainly the debate there was a little wider. That proposal having been rubbished a little in the other place, Senator Murphy was very careful to narrow down the proposal he submitted here. I invite honourable senators to analyse what he said. This Parliament has debated the problem and has made a contribution to its solution in the form of trade practices legislation. Senator Murphy’s speech was an assault on the States for not having passed complementary legislation. Having regard to the profession to which Senator Murphy belongs he would know that in a debate of this kind he first needs to prove his case in terms of his actual resolution.

He talked in glib terms, smacked the table and made a lot of noise about price rigging and other harmful practices. But in fact not one single case did he bring before us. lt was melodrama. For a moment I almost thought he was a candidate for the next Senate election. Perhaps I am being a bit cynical in making that comment. I withdraw it because, after all, he is the Leader of the Opposition and he is entitled to make his case. The truth of the matter is that this is an example of a motion which was debated in another place. Now it comes up here the second time around. 1 invite anybody here and anybody who is listening in to analyse what was said. Senator Murphy presented an emotional case. He would know even better than I that because of constitutional difficulties there is a need for complementary legislation to be passed by the States. Most of the States have not been prepared to provide that legislation because of cases taken to court such as the Cascade Brewery case in Tasmania which was an appeal against the law. Senator Murphy blames this Government for some sinister delay. We are accused of being part of a machiavellian plot not to persist with this legislation. He therefore suggests that we are terrible people.

Reference was made to the fact that we are members of the Liberal-Country Party coalition and it was said that the LiberalCountry Party coalitions in the States must come out of the same pot. lt is not unknown for the Australian Labor Party to have a couple of differences about coming out of the same pot. I refer to Victoria. It is a pretty shallow argument when the chicken comes home to roost in Victoria to talk about ‘once a Liberal always a Liberal’, whether it be in the Commonwealth or the State sphere. I think the principle goes a bit deeper in Victoria where ‘once a Labor man’ is obviously not a case of ‘always a Labor man’. I think the Leader of the Opposition put forward a pretty thin argument. Since Senator Murphy did not give us any particularity about the unjustified price increases except by referring to price rigging and other harmful practices perhaps I should look at what he might have said. We have had some information about price increases and in more recent times questions have been asked about the increases in terms of the inflation problem. None of us would deny that there have been some inflationary tendencies and that this Government has taken action to steady the economy. The Labor Party does not agree with the procedures which were taken to steady the economy in the budgetary sense.

Senator Young:

– They cannot deny that this Government has the best inflationary record of any country.

Senator Sir KENNETH ANDERSONI ask the honourable senator not to anticipate me because I am about to demonstrate that point. I notice that the more honourable senators on the other side are hurt the more they start to yap. Courtesy demands that I should be heard, just as Senator Murphy was heard. The lynch pin for the motion was price increases. Leaving aside trade practices, the Government has taken legislative and Executive action to stem what it recognised as an inflationary trend. The first action it took was in relation to liquidity. Everybody knows - the Australian Labor Party knows as well as we do, but it is not political for its members to recognise it - that liquidity has a vital influence on an economy. The action taken in relation to the bank rate clearly was intended to slow down the liquidity and to cool down the economy to some extent because it was getting overheated. I do not have to state this to demonstrate that inflationary trends in Australia have tended to slacken.

This motion would have had a lot more validity, if it had any at all, if it were not introduced in the atmosphere of a coming Senate election and if the Senate were not 3 or 4 days away from the time of lifting, perhaps - who knows - but 12 months ago. Statistics published recently by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics disclosed a drop in the price spiral. I quote from the Bureau’s report which was released in the Press on 20th October 1970, which is not so long ago. It was reported that the rate of increase in retail prices had slowed in the September quarter. The September rise for the 6 State capitals was 0.6 per cent against rises in the previous quarters of 1.3 per cent, 1 per cent and 0.8 per cent. The Sydney increase was 0.9 per cent against 1.4 per cent in the previous quarter and 1.6 per cent in the quarter previous to that.

Senator Little:

– That does not show that prices have dropped, lt only shows that the rise has slowed.

Senator Sir KENNETH ANDERSON:

– It shows that the rise has slowed by comparison to the rise in previous quarters. There can be no doubt that the economy has been stabilised, quite contrary to what Senator Murphy said. This has happened in a climate of full employment. We have achieved this result in a most difficult climate. The unemployment problem is world wide. The number of Australians unemployed is less than 1 per cent of our work force. Australia is a primary producing country and the population moves because of seasonal employment. Australia, a primary producing country, has that enviable employment record, whereas other countries in the free world have unemployment figures as high as 4 per cent and 5 per cent and even higher. The rate of increase in the price of commodities in those countries is much higher than the rate of increase in the price of commodities in Australia. One does not walk away from the problem. We recognise that it is a problem and the Government has not defaulted in relation to these issues. The Budget, which the Australian Labor Party has opposed so vigorously and is continuing to oppose, was calculated to have a steadying influence on the economy. There has been no validity in some of the arguments that have been put. Incorporated in the Budget was a tremendous taxation concession of about $240m for this year or about $280m in a full year. That concession was to be given to no less than 5 million people. What did the Labor Party do? It moved to have the relevant Bill withdrawn. The effect of having the Bill withdrawn would have been to defeat it.

Senator Willesee:

– That is not so. The Minister knows better than that.

Senator Sir KENNETH ANDERSON:

– The honourable senator cannot walk away from his responsibilities in this place. The

Opposition voted against the Bill, if it bad succeeded, the Bill would have been defeated.

Senator Murphy:

– We did not vote against the Bill at all.

Senator Sir KENNETH ANDERSON:

–

The Opposition voted against the second reading of the Bill. If 1 am wrong in that statement, I will withdraw it. The Opposition moved an amendment that the Bill be withdrawn. If that amendment had been carried, the Bill would have disappeared. Honourable senators opposite should not kid themselves that the amendment meant anything else. The Budget was calculated to have a steadying influence on the economy. The Opposition has moved amendments to almost every consequential Bill. The amendments, if carried, would have had the effect of stopping the Bills or of referring them to committees. In some instances, they cast judgments against the proposals.

I do not believe that a case has been made by Senator Murphy. He would have been far better off if he had made a straight out attack on the Trade Practices Act. Senator Murphy would have a fairly good understanding of the legal implications of that Act. He would know that our federal system made the application of the legislation very difficult. Nobody would deny that the Act has been challenged in the courts. I think it was only in very recent times that a decision was given in the Tasmanian case. About 80 per cent or 90 per cent of Senator Murphy’s case was a criticism of the States for not passing complementary legislation. That is a decision for the States. To tie to that handle a criticism that the Government has done nothing to curb inflation is to deny and not to recognise what has been done by the Budget, by Executive action in relation to interest rates and a whole scries of proposals, by the very careful examination of expenditure and by the direction of assistance particularly to rural industries. All these matters have been calculated to steady any inflationary trends.

I think that Opposition senators, in their hearts, recognise that action has been taken. I think they recognise the problem. I believe that they accept that the Commonwealth has done a far better job than has any other country to solve this world wide problem. If that statement hurts them, I am sorry, but it is a fact of life. Not only this country but the whole world has to face the problem of falling prices for primary products. We are a young country still. We take over 120,000 migrants a year. We find full and gainful employment for our people. Our employment rate is better than that of any other country. That is the achievement which we have to consider. Added to that, we have been able to contain and hold the price factor. As I said in my speech on the Budget, whilst it is true that the consumer price index has risen, it is also true that average weekly incomes have risen by a far greater percentage. I shall not quote my speech at length because honourable senators have heard it before. I appreciate that some honourable senators do not agree with what I had to say. Nevertheless, 1 shall refer to my speech to establish a point. [ had incorporated in Hansard a table showing the consumer price index and average weekly earnings in various years. I refer to page 615 of the Senate Hansard of Wednesday, 1. 6th September 1970. The consumer price index was 106 in 1968-69, which represented a percentage increase on the previous year of 2.6. The average weekly earnings in the same year were $68.90, which represented a percentage increase on the previous year of 7.2. Let us examine the figures for the next year. In 1969-70 the consumer price index was 109.4, which represented a percentage increase on the previous year of 3.2. The average weekly earnings were $75, which represented a percentage increase on the previous year of 8.9. 1 have the statistics in front of me. I challenge honourable senators opposite to nominate a year and I will give the figures for it. We all recognise that there has been an increase in the cost of living. The fact of the matter is that in 1969-70 the average weekly earnings increased by 8.9 per cent but the consumer price index increased by only 3.2 per cent.

Senator Cant:

– What has been the increase in the profit ratio?

Senator Sir KENNETH ANDERSON:

– The honourable senator would be aware that profit ratios vary. I suppose it would be a different matter if there was price control. 1 have been asked a lot of questions on price control. In his contribution to the debate Senator Murphy did not suggest price control would be the answer, although some of his colleagues in the Senate have referred to it before. I suspect that before this debate goes much further it will be raised again. All I would say is that price control is not the answer to the problem. It has been demonstrated throughout the world that price control is not the answer to the problem.

A few moments ago Senator Murphy made some reference to the actions of Labor governments. It is significant that the Labor governments which have been in office in the States in recent years have not suggested price control as the solution to the problem. Being blood brothers, these Labor governments would have had the same philosophy as Senator Murphy. The fact of the matter is that price control has not been introduced because it has been demonstrated that if it is to be effective it is necessary to have absolute price control over not only commodities but also wages and everything else. The classic or ideal time to impose price control was during the war years when the country was in a state of national emergency and the Commonwealth Government had far greater powers without legal and constitutional barriers to overcome. However, it would not work even under those conditions. A good many of us were not in Australia during the war years; we were somewhere else, but those who were here - our friends, parents and loved ones - have told us of the farce which went on in relation to price control. Those of us who came back after the war will recall the farce in the early post-war years. Everything one wanted was under the counter or behind the curtain.

Price control is not the answer. The answer is along the lines of the actions of the Government. The Government is striving for productivity, which is the answer to the problem. Increased wages and, indeed, reduced hours would be quite acceptable if matched by increased productivity, but if YOU do not have increased productivity they spell disaster. This is where the Government parts from the Opposition. The Opposition does not have the capacity to understand that you have to be able to produce. If wages are increased without a corresponding increase in productivity inflation will occur. A reduction of 5 hours in the working week, which the Australian Labor Party is pledged to support, without increased productivity and everything which goes with it, would be the greatest contribution possible to galloping inflation.

Senator Murphy’s case was built around criticism of the application of the Trade Practices Act. Almost the whole of his speech was based on the fact that the States have not passed complementary legislation and, as a result, they have tended to stultify the application of the provisions of this Act. I do not think Senator Murphy has told the complete story. An Act of Parliament which deals with certain aspects of trade has been passed and is in force. I think honourable senators will agree with me that those who are responsible for administering the Trade Practices Act have demonstrated that the existence of the Act has had a salutary effect on some - it would be silly to suggest all - restrictive trade practices, f believe that collusive tendering will be almost a thing of the past as a result of this Act. I know that collusive tendering has occurred. We have seen examples of it. I conclude by saying that the case which has been put up by Senator Murphy is. not valid.

Senator CANT:

Western Australia

– I rise to participate in this debate with a little bit of sorrow because I have just listened to the most fatuous lot of drivel I have ever heard from a senior Minister of the Government. The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson) said that price control is not the answer. He spoke knowing full well that a form of price control is in operation in the community today, but the Government will not attempt to relieve that price control in any way in favour of the housewives of Australia. The Leader of the Government criticised Senator Murphy for not producing an example. To give one T intend to quote from the annual report of the Commissioner of Trade Practices for the year ended 30th June 1970. At page 10 paragraph 2. IS it states:

The depression of the 1930s, and war time price control, led to many of the price fixing agreements still current and to the pre-disposition of many businessmen to agree prices with their competitors. Common criticisms of price control by governments are that it constitutes undue interference with business freedom, and tends to produce uniformity and to damp down competition. These may be valid criticisms, if the comparison is between government price control and competition. 1 emphasise the word ‘competition’. The report continues:

Often, however, it is not competition, but industry agreement on prices, that has replaced government price control, which was at least known to the public.

So that we do in fact have price control. Mr Bannerman, the Commissioner of Trade Practices, has drawn attention to it. Therefore, it is no good saying that we do not have price control. I do not say that a fair method of price control would be the answer to all of our problems but it would be the answer to a lot of them. The Leader of the Government said that no Labor government in the States has introduced price control. This is true. But a State Labor government would not do so because price control needs to be introduced at a national level and not within an individual State, otherwise it creates problems in that State, particularly in regard to section 92 of the Constitution. No State will introduce price control on its own. The Government knew before it passed the restrictive trade practices legislation that the States would not agree to pass complementary legislation. Sir Henry Bolte warned the Commonwealth that he would not do it, and if one State stands out that means the end of price control.

Earlier this year a survey of prices was made in Western Australia by Professor Drane who said: $69 puts you on the breadline in Perth.

At the time Professor Drane was making this survey the minimum wage in Western Australia was $42.30. The report of his remarks continued:

Families need a take home pay of $69 a week to maintain average living standards.

If he is correct, most of our one breadwinner families might be better off scrambling for handout crusts in Djakarta.

To take home $69, a married man with 2 children must earn just over $80 and claim family allowances week by week . . . The basic wage of $36.45 for men and $27.88 for women should be regarded as fatuous.

That is what Professor Drane said. Now let us see what Professor Wheelwright of the University of Sydney had to say. He has been reported in this way:

Australians were ‘better off in 1960 than they are today in the distribution of wealth, according to a Sydney economist.

In almost every category, wage earners in the lower groups have not kepi up with the others. says Professor E. Wheelwright of Sydney University’s Faculty of Economics. He made the point in. Sydney this week after completing an Australiawide survey on costs of living.

One of the important aspects emerging from his research is a distinguishing line between living standards and living costs.

It can be seen that for some time there has been concern with rising prices, not only by ordinary people but also by those who take an interest in things of this kind and are able to conduct surveys. While workers are trying to get some industrial justice the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton), addressing a dinner at which the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission was present, warned the Commission that the economy could not stand wage rises. A couple of weeks later the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Snedden) on the eve of the hearing of the national wage case made an attack upon rising wages. Mr Bury, the Treasurer, also warned about wage inflation. But not one of those gentlemen referred to profit inflation, which is what we have in this country today.

If you look at the returns of the various companies in Australia von will see that the profits of all of them are increasing. This applies particularly to hire purchase finance companies, the blood suckers who are on the people all of the time. They are the ones who are making the big profits. In his Budget Speech the Treasurer admitted that the cost of living had increased by 5 per cent, that wages had increased by 7 per cent and that profits had increased by 14 per cent. Yet no attempt has been made to control profits.

The Minister said that there was an attempt to control liquidity within the economy, and he mentioned interest rates which were increased in the final quarter of the last fiscal year. What is the use of applying brakes to an economy which can immediately pass on any increases in interest rates? What happened with regard to land values? The increased interest rates were absorbed immediately in the price of land. What happened to the young people who were paying interest on long term loans to enable them to get a home of their own? The interest rates were increased immediately on loans which had been made some years before. They had budgeted to meet certain commitments over the year but the increase in interest rates forced them to adjust their budgets. How can they adjust their budgets except by reducing their standard of living? Yet that is the kind of control which the Government claims it is imposing. Who got the benefit of the increase in interest rates? None other than the estate agents and the land merchants. They collected the increase by shifting it on to the price of land, and they earned a profit on top of that as well. That is the kind of business practice for which this Government stands.

The Minister chided the Australian Labor Party for voting against a tax measure which purported to reduce the taxation burden on the community to the extent of $228m. A survey of the reduction in income tax and a survey of the increase in indirect tax reveals that the community will benefit to the extent of only about $30m, not $22Sm. This is another one of the confidence tricks that the Government attempts to put over the people. At any rate, who got the greatest benefit of the change in the tax scale by applying an across the board reduction in tax of 10 per cent on incomes up to Si 6,000 a year? That is the so-called middle income group which the Government set out to assist. The lower income group did not get the benefit because those on the minimum wage had their tax reduced by 50c a week while those on the so-called average wage - I do not know who gets the average wage because there is no average worker - had their tax reduced by $1.50 a week. However the man receiving a salary of $16,000 a year had his tax reduced by $9.61 a week. That is the way in which the Government claims that it is assisting the people of this country. In fact it is doing nothing to assist them.

Senator Rae:

– The 10 per cent reduction applied to salaries up to S 10.000, not SI 6,000.

Senator CANT:

– The maximum reduction on salaries up to $16,000 is $500 and then it starts to fall off up to S32.000. Senator Rae should have another look at the scale, and if he cannot read it I will read it for him. The Minister said that wages have increased more than prices have. Of course w
