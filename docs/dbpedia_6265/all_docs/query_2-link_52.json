The District of Columbia and Puerto Rico are not included.\n\nNote 2: The values for the \"United States\" that are shown in the \"Change in Seats\" row indicate the total number of seats that were reassigned that decade (except for the 1910 value, which indicates the number of seats added to the U.S. House of Representatives since 1900)."
