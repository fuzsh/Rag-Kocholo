        "text": "Eugene McCarthy (born March 29, 1916, Watkins, Minnesota, U.S.—died December 10, 2005, Washington, D.C.) was a U.S. senator, whose entry into the 1968 race for the Democratic presidential nomination ultimately led President Lyndon B. Johnson to drop his bid for reelection.\n\nMcCarthy graduated from St. John’s University (Collegeville, Minnesota) in 1935, then taught high school while working on a master’s degree at the University of Minnesota. He returned as a faculty member to St. John’s (1940–43) and subsequently served in the War Department’s military intelligence division until the end of World War II. After the war McCarthy again taught school, eventually becoming chairman of the sociology department at the College of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. In 1948 he ran successfully on Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party ticket for the U.S. House of Representatives, where he remained for 10 years, compiling a liberal voting record.\n\nIn 1958 McCarthy was elected to the Senate, where he remained a relatively unknown figure nationally until November 30, 1967. On that day, he announced his intention to challenge Johnson in the Democratic presidential primaries. Although in 1964 he had supported the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (which gave the president broad powers to wage the Vietnam War), by 1967 McCarthy had become an outspoken critic of the war. At first McCarthy’s challenge was not taken seriously, but his candidacy soon attracted the growing numbers of Democrats who opposed further American involvement in the Vietnam War. After the Minnesota senator, with his trenchant wit and scholarly, understated manner, captured 42 percent of the vote in the New Hampshire primary in March 1968, Johnson made the dramatic announcement of his withdrawal from the race. McCarthy went on to sweep three primaries but then lost four of the next five to Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Following Kennedy’s assassination, McCarthy lost the nomination at the convention in Chicago to Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, who had declined to run in the primaries."
