        "text": "I am working to bring transparency to Congress, and part of that effort includes keeping you updated on what bills passed the House each week and how I voted on each piece of legislation. If you have any questions related to my votes, please do not hesitate to contact my Washington office at 202-225-3665.\n\nTOTAL VOTES EXPLAINED: 745\n\nJuly 25, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.Res. 1371, Strongly condemning the Biden Administration and its Border Czar, Kamala Harris’s, failure to secure the United States border. In 2021, as illegal aliens began pouring over our Southern Border leading to the border crisis, Vice President Kamala Harris was designated as the “border czar.” During her time as the border czar, Harris only visited the Southern Border once and has never spoken with the Chief of the U.S. Border Patrol. During Harris’ time as border czar, over 9.9 million illegal aliens have entered the United States, including individuals with ties to terrorist organizations and individuals on the terror watchlist. I am disappointed that only six of my Democratic colleagues had the courage to vote for this simple resolution that highlights the ongoing crisis on our border that has turned every community into a border community. H.Res. 1371 passed the House by a vote of 220-196.\n\nI voted “YES” on H.R. 8998, Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2025. This bill authorizes appropriations for the Department of the Interior (DOI), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and several related agencies. By passing this legislation, House Republicans are upholding our duty to cut spending, authorizing appropriations for these agencies at $4.4 billion below President Biden’s request (a reduction of 10%). This bill also cuts funding for the EPA by 20%, which under this administration has been weaponized to enforce the Green New Deal, Diversity Equity and Inclusion Programs, and burdensome regulations on land use, hunting and fishing, mineral production, and oil and gas leasing. This bill refocuses the EPA and DOI on their core responsibilities— responsibly managing our federal land and keeping our farms and rivers clean. This bill passed by a vote of 210-205.\n\nJuly 24, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.Res. 1367, Establishing the Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump. This resolution establishes a bipartisan Task Force to investigate the attempted assassination of President Donald J. Trump and the actions of the Secret Service and other government agencies that allowed this horrific event to occur. The Task Force will be comprised of seven Republicans and six Democrats, and importantly, the Task Force will have subpoena power. I look forward to carefully reviewing the Task Force’s final report and implementing their recommendations to ensure that nothing like this every occurs again. H.Res. 1367 passed the House by a vote of 416-0.\n\nJuly 23, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on S. 227, Improving Access to Our Courts Act. This legislation formally allows federal court proceedings to occur in Brewster County, Texas. Currently, both parties must sign a waiver to allow court proceedings to occur in Brewster County, otherwise they occur in Pecos, TX several hours away. S. 227 passed the House by a vote of 404-3.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 7887, the ACCESS Act. This legislation would eliminate mandatory experience or educational requirements for government contractors, unless contracting offices provide a written explanation of why the requirements are essential. Too many government jobs have unnecessary requirements that prevent the most qualified individuals from being hired. The government must prioritize skills and expertise, not just diplomas and formalized education. This vote required a 2/3 majority to pass and failed by a vote of 178-234.\n\nI voted “Yes” on S. 3706, the Victims’ VOICES Act. This legislation will ensure that victim advocates, such as family members, legal guardians, or court appointed advocates, receive restitution for expenses occurred as a result of the trial, such as transportation, lost income, and childcare. Victim advocates should not have to sacrifice to advocate for justice for their loved ones. S. 3706 passed the House by a vote of 408-2.\n\nJuly 22, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 1631, the Pro Codes Act. This legislation would provide a fix for copyright protections for private standards that are incorporated into law by reference. Currently, if a copyrighted privately set standard is incorporated into law by reference, the standard setting organization loses their copyright protections. However, this legislation would have allowed companies to retain their copyrights if they provide access to the incorporated standard without charge. This vote required a 2/3 majority to pass and failed by a vote of 248-127.\n\nI voted “Yes” on S. 3249, To designate the outpatient clinic of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Wyandotte County, Kansas City, Kansas, as the “Captain Elwin Shopteese VA Clinic”. Elwin Shopteese was a member of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation and fought in World War II, including in the Normandy invasion and the Battle of the Bulge. He received a Bronze Star and Purple Heart for his service. After serving, he was a Tribal Council member and helped found the Indian Community Alcoholism Resources Expeditors Recovery Home, a tribal center for treating alcoholism. S. 3249 passed the House by a vote of 363-0, with one member voting present.\n\nI voted “YES” on H.R. 8812, the Water Resources Development Act of 2024. This bill authorizes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects and feasibility studies, deauthorizes inactive projects, and establishes pilot programs. This bill makes critical investments into our nation's shipping ports, waterways, flood management programs, and water resource infrastructure. This will ensure that Americans continue to have clean drinking water, as well as high-functioning logistical hubs that keep our economy running. This bill passed by a vote of 359-13.\n\nJuly 11, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on the veto message to accompany H.J. Res. 109, providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to “Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121.” The passage of this resolution by a 2/3 majority of both Chambers of Congress would have overturned President Biden’s veto of this Congressional Review Act (CRA) to rescind a rule issued by the SEC that would force banks who custody crypto assets on behalf of customers to make detailed disclosures and list crypt assets as liabilities on their balance sheets. This will leave American’s assets more vulnerable if a custodian becomes insolvent or enters receivership. This rule is yet another example of the SEC, a market regulator, trying to dictate banking policy with zero input from both democratically elected legislators and the public. I was disappointed to see this resolution did not pass the house with a 2/3 majority, when it failed by a vote of 228-184.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 8772, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2025. This bill funds the Legislative at more than $130 million less than the President’s budget request. This bill is a perfect example of the House Republican majority’s commitment to reining in wasteful government spending and restoring fiscal sanity to Washington. This bill ensures sufficient funding for Congress to continue conducting rigorous oversight over the corrupt Biden administration, bans the purchase of telecommunications equipment or drones from the People’s Republic of China, and bans any Critical Race Theory or Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion education. Additionally, the bill maintains the freeze on Member pay, and requires any unspent funds to be used for debt and deficit reduction. This is the fifth individual appropriations bill that the full House of Representatives has voted on, and House Republicans will continue working to fund the government through regular order, while cutting wasteful government spending. Unfortunately, H.R. 8772 failed to pass the House by a vote of 289-128.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.Res. 1344, Finding that Merrick Garland, Attorney General of the United States, is in contempt of the House of Representatives for disobeying a certain subpoena. On June 12, the House of Representatives passed H.Res. 1292 which recommended that U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland be found in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena by the Judiciary Committee. Unlike previous contempt referrals by the House of Representatives under Speaker Pelosi, such as Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro, the Department of Justice refused to prosecute Attorney General Garland for being in contempt of Congress. This violates the rule of law and our Constitutional norms. H.Res. 1344 would hold Attorney General Garland in inherent contempt and fine him $10,000 per day until he complies with the subpoena for the video tape of President Biden’s interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur. While Attorney General Garland continues to attempt to shield President Biden from accountability, the House Republican Majority will continue working to investigate the Biden crime family’s corruption. Unfortunately, H.Res. 1344 failed to pass the House by a vote of 204-210.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.J.Res. 165, Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of Education relating to Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance. This resolution would overturn the Department of Education’s radical new rule that would require schools to allow biological men to compete in women’s sports and deprive women of athletic opportunities guaranteed by Title IX. The facts are clear: biological men are different from biological women and have distinct advantages over women in many athletic events. Allowing biological men to compete against women strips women of scholarship opportunities and the Title IX protections that generations of women fought for. This resolution passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 210-205.\n\nJuly 10, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 8281, the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act or SAVE Act. As the co-chair of the House Election Integrity Caucus, I was happy to cosponsor and support SAVE Act, which will safeguard the right to vote for Americans by requiring proof of citizenship in order to vote in a federal election. Since President Biden took office, there have been over 9.7 million illegal immigrant encounters nationwide, threatening our communities, our national security, and now our elections. Nearly 80% of voters oppose illegal migrants voting in any U.S. election. We must defend this most sacred right and ensure only American citizens have a say at the ballot box. H.R. 8281 passed the House by a vote of 221-198.\n\nJuly 9, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 7637, the Refrigerator Freedom Act. This legislation prevents the Department of Energy (DOE) from setting or enforcing energy efficiency standards for refrigerators that are either not cost-effective, technologically unfeasible, or do not result in significant energy savings. Under the Biden Administration, the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency have imposed excessive and overreaching regulations that limit choices for consumers and contribute to skyrocketing energy prices. New York families should have the ability to choose appliances they want in their own home. H.R. 7637 passed the House by a vote of 212-192.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 7700, the Stop Unaffordable Dishwasher Standards Act. This legislation prevents the Department of Energy (DOE) from setting or enforcing energy efficiency standards for dishwashers that are either not cost-effective, technologically unfeasible, or do not result in significant energy savings. The Department of Energy's (DOE) proposed dishwasher efficiency standards would significantly limit the water and energy usage of dishwashers, which would raise prices for consumers while providing little benefit. According to DOE's analysis, these proposed standards are estimated to save Americans only $17 over a span of 12 years. H.R. 7700 passed the House by a vote of 214-192.\n\nJuly 8, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 897, the Alabama Underwater Forest National Marine Sanctuary and Protection Act. Discovered in 2004 after Hurricane Ivan, the Alabama Underwater Forest consists of submerged forests of ancient cypress trees that date back to an ice age roughly 70,000 years ago. Exploration of the site continues to yield invaluable scientific insight into a variety of fields and with the passage of this legislation, it is now the policy of the United States to “protect and preserve” this pristine natural sanctuary. This bill passed by a vote of 349-19.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 5441, the Long Island Sound Restoration and Stewardship Reauthorization Act. This bill reauthorizes appropriations for Long Island Sound programs through FY 2028. The Long Island Sound is home to a wide variety of fish, migratory birds, and other species, and serves as a source of recreational and economic activity. Roughly four million people live in communities along the Sound, with more than nine million living in the watershed. The sound is a natural beauty and contributes to over $9 billion in annual economic activity for the state of New York through activities such as fishing, boating, recreation, and tourism. I was glad to see this program reauthorized so that the Long Island Sound can maintain its natural beauty for years to come. This bill passed by a vote of 333-51.\n\nJune 28, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 8774, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2025. H.R. 8774 will make sure that all military servicemembers are supported, including being fully equipped, receiving the familial support they require, and terminating the radical political agenda being pushed by the Biden administration and the Pentagon. In addition, the bill puts DOD back on a path towards sanity and ensures the agency’s only focus is on keeping our nation safe and deterring adversarial aggression. Importantly, this bill includes huge wins for Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station and Fort Drum and will support all our NY-24 servicemembers. I was also pleased the legislation included my amendments to defund Executive Order 14019 and the Biden administration’s radical “Federal Acquisition Regulation: Disclosure of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate-Related Financial Risk” rule. Furthermore, the bill addresses the threat posed by China by providing robust funding for INDOPACOM, the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, and supporting our allies in the region. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to get this bill across the finish line to provide for the needs of our servicemembers and protect our country. This bill passed the House by a vote of 217-198.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 8771, the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2025. This bill supports U.S. national security interests abroad while cutting wasteful spending, countering adversaries, supporting our allies, and strengthening oversight. House Republicans have fully funded aid to Israel, prohibited funding for a new nuclear agreement with Iran, and defunded the anti-Semitic UN Human Rights Council and the pro-Hamas United Nations Relief and Works Agency. Furthermore, H.R. 8771 prohibits funding for China and strongly supports Taiwan. Finally, this bill included two of my amendments, which prohibits any funds to pay the salary of, reinstate, or reemploy U.S. Special Representative for Iran Robert Malley, and stops the Biden administration from wasting money on its radical Executive Order 14019. This bill passed the House by a vote of 212-200.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 8752, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2025. Our nation’s border crisis is a direct result of the Biden administration’s refusal to enforce our immigration laws. Since President Biden took office, human trafficking, illicit drugs, and suspected terrorists have flooded our country and turned every community into a border community. H.R. 8752 builds on the historic border security legislation House Republicans passed last year, H.R. 2, and provides $600 million for building the wall along the Southern Border. Furthermore, this bill funds a record 22,000 border patrol agents, restores “Remain in Mexico” policies, and stops the federal government from shipping migrants from the Southern Border to New York. I strongly support this legislation and urge my Senate colleagues to do their constitutional duty and pass this bill immediately, along with H.R. 2, so we can finally secure our borders. This bill passed the House by a vote of 212-203.\n\nJune 25, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.Res. 901, Expressing support for democracy and human rights in Pakistan. This resolution expresses support for Pakistan’s democracy and encourages stronger ties between the United States and Pakistan. Building strong ties in Asia helps combat China and the Chinese Communist Party’s growing influence in the region, and Pakistan can be a strong partner in combatting the Chinese. H.Res. 901 passed the House by a vote of 368-7.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 7152, the Korean American Divided Families National Registry Act. This bill would require the State Department to make efforts to facilitate reunions of Korean American families who wish to be reunited with family members living in North Korea. This includes creating a national registry of applicable individuals, facilitating in-person and video reunions, and working to promote permanent family reunions. Many Korean American families continue to be split as a result of the Korean War, and this bill will help work towards reuniting these American families with their loved ones. H.R. 7152 passed the House by a vote of 375-8.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 2789, the American Cooperation with Our Neighbors Act. This bill would require the Secretary of State and USAID Administrator to submit a strategy to Congress regarding cooperation between the United States and Mexico, specifically addressing drug and human trafficking and other issues faced by local communities. Due to President Biden’s border crisis, every state is now a border state and fentanyl has been destroying many of our communities. We must do more to cooperate with our neighbors to stem the invasion of migrants into our country and end drug trafficking. H.R. 2789 passed the House by a vote of 368-44.\n\nJune 14, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 8070, the Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) is a critical piece of legislation that authorizes funding for vital defense programs and improves the quality of life for our servicemembers and their families. This year's NDAA works to enhance our deterrence capabilities, counteract China's malign influence, and enhance living conditions for our servicemembers. Importantly, this year's NDAA reversed the Biden administration's dangerous request to halve the annual Virginia-class submarine purchase, which would have a devastating impact on our Indo-Pacific deterrence and our defense industrial base. Improving the lives of our servicemembers and their families, who make sacrifices every day for our country, was a focal point of this year's NDAA. This bill provides a 19.5 percent raise for junior enlisted servicemembers, improves on-post housing, ensures access to quality health care, and invests in greater access to childcare for military families. As a tenacious advocate for our military, I specifically advocated for funding initiatives that will benefit our servicemembers and their families at Fort Drum, Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station, and neighboring communities. Importantly, this bill cracks down on excessive spending and safeguards billions of taxpayer dollars to ensure our hard-earned dollars are not used to fund the Biden administration's \"woke\" policies. I supported multiple amendments that prohibit wasteful funding for Green New Deal mandates, unnecessary diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts, and sex reassignment surgeries. Funding for our armed forces must be focused on military readiness, enhancing our defense capabilities, and supporting our servicemembers' quality of life. Included in this bill were two standalone pieces of legislation that I introduced: the FORKS Made in America Act and the Parity for Child Exploitation Offenders Act. The FORKS Made in America Act will require DOD to buy stainless steel flatware from American companies, such as manufacturers in New York. The Parity for Child Exploitation Offenders Act will close loopholes that allow child predators to escape enhanced penalties for sexual crimes involving children. Passing the NDAA is crucial to our defense and national security initiatives. I am eager to see this bill swiftly signed into law to give our brave servicemembers the resources and support they deserve. H.R. 8070 passed the House by a vote of 217-199.\n\nJune 12, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on S. 138, Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act. S. 138 requires the Special Coordinator for Tibet to actively counter China’s disinformation regarding Tibet and its history. This bill also reaffirms U.S. support for the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan people and reinforces existing U.S. policy that the Tibet question must be resolved through direct negotiations between Tibet and China. S. 138 passed the House by a vote of 391-26.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.Res. 1292, a resolution recommending that the House of Representatives find United States Attorney General Merrick B. Garland in contempt of Congress for refusal to comply with a subpoena duly issued by the Committee on the Judiciary. Attorney General (AG) Garland is a dirty cop. President Biden has admitted to mishandling classified documents, yet AG Garland is engaging in a cover-up by refusing to bring charges against President Biden. Now, he is withholding valuable information from the House Judiciary Committee, further shielding President Biden from accountability. This at the same time he is orchestrating a meritless, politically-driven investigation into President Trump. This scheme is a ploy by the Department of Justice to interfere in the 2024 election on behalf of Joe Biden and the Democrats. House Republicans are dedicated to holding corrupt AG Garland accountable and ensuring the Biden Crime Family is thoroughly investigated and charged for their crimes against the American people. H.Res. 1292 passed the House by a vote of 216-207.\n\nJune 11, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 6543, the No Hidden Fees on Extra Expenses for Stays Act of 2023. H.R. 6543 prohibits unfair or misleading price advertising for places of short-term lodging and requires accurate price listings that include all mandatory and resort fees. Hidden fees drive up costs for American families that are continuing to grapple with inflation. That is why I supported this legislation to improve transparency and allow individuals and families to be fully informed about prices for hotels, resorts, or other lodging arrangements before they travel. H.R. 6543 passed the House by a vote of 384-25.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 2964, the Wastewater Infrastructure Pollution Prevention and Environmental Safety Act. H.R. 2964 requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to create a standardized, uniform label for non-flushable products like cotton swabs, wet wipes, paper towels, and tissues. Many communities in Upstate New York continue to face challenges in maintaining wastewater infrastructure, and blockages from non-flushable products can wreak havoc on older plumbing and wastewater treatment equipment. Simplifying labeling for non-flushable products will save taxpayers millions and prevent future problems for our community’s wastewater infrastructure. H.R. 2964 passed the House by a vote of 351-56.\n\nJune 5, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 8580, the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2025. Ensuring our nation's servicemembers and veterans have access to high-quality benefits, facilities, and care while strengthening our national security is essential to our country's prosperity. H.R. 8580 guarantees that servicemembers, veterans, and their families are supported and receive the benefits they are owed for their service and sacrifice. The bill provides a vital investment in U.S. military infrastructure by improving Department of Defense (DOD) facilities and enhancing the lives of military families through much-needed funding for family housing and child development centers. Additionally, this bill takes steps to uphold pro-life principles, protect our veterans’ Second Amendment rights, and crack down on the Biden administration’s “woke” policies. Voting in favor of this bill reaffirms my commitment to our veterans and active-duty military by ensuring their housing, health care programs, and benefits are fully funded while bolstering our national security. H.R. 8580 passed the House by a vote of 209-197.\n\nJune 4, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 8282, the Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act. As Hamas continues to hold Americans and Israelis hostage, the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for defending Israel against Hamas’ terrorism. These warrants are baseless and illegitimate, especially considering Israel, like the United States, is not a member of the ICC, resulting in the ICC’s lack of jurisdiction in this matter. However, allowing the ICC to arrest Israeli leaders could create a precedent that could lead to American leaders being arrested and tried by the ICC, violating our national sovereignty. This important bill would impose sanctions on any ICC officials involved in the investigation, arrest, detention, or prosecution of any American or ally that is not subject to the ICC’s jurisdiction and prohibits any federal funding for the ICC. I cosponsored this critical bill to ensure that our national sovereignty is upheld and international institutions, such as the ICC, cannot impose their will on countries that are not members of the organization. H.R. 8282 passed the House by a vote of 247-155, with two members voting present.\n\nJune 3, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.Res. 1215, Calling on elected officials and civil society leaders to join in efforts to educate the public on the contributions of the Jewish American community. In recent months, a horrific wave of anti-Semitism has arisen across the country, including at college campuses. This important resolution calls on all elected officials and civil society leaders to condemn anti-Semitism and work to ensure the safety and security of Jewish communities. H.Res. 1215 passed the House by a vote of 371-0.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 6983, To designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 15 South Valdosta Road in Lakeland, Georgia, as the \"Nell Patten Roquemore Post Office\". Nell Patten Roquemore was a dedicated public servant in Lakeland, Georgia who served as Mayor Pro Tempore, postmaster, and as a secretary to various commanders at Moody Air Force Base. Roquemore also led numerous groups dedicated to beautifying and improving Lakeland and Lanier County as a whole. H.R. 6983 passed the House by a vote of 369-2, with two members voting present.\n\nMay 23, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 192, To prohibit individuals who are not citizens of the United States from voting in elections in the District of Columbia and to repeal the Local Resident Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2022. H.R. 192 prohibits an individual who is not a U.S. citizen from voting in D.C. local elections and repeals the Local Resident Voting Rights Amendment Act (D.C. Law 24-0242), which allows noncitizens, including illegal immigrants and foreign diplomats, to vote in D.C. local elections. The right to vote is a fundamental tenet of American citizenship and allowing noncitizens to vote dilutes U.S. citizens’ power at the ballot box. Further, this D.C. law would allow foreign diplomats and agents living in D.C. to vote in U.S. elections. As chair of the Election Integrity Caucus, I will always fight to protect our elections and ensure that only U.S. citizens can vote. H.R. 192 passed the House by a vote of 262-143.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 5403, the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act. H.R. 5403 would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) without congressional authorization. Unelected bureaucrats should not have the power to issue a new currency without input from Congress. A CBDC would pose significant privacy concerns, as its implementation could potentially allow the federal government to track, or even prevent, the purchase of goods by all Americans. We have seen how this has played out in countless other countries throughout the world. Authoritarian regimes such as the Chinese Communist Party have implemented CBDC to impose Orwellian surveillance measures on their citizens. CBDCs fly in the face of the fundamental right to privacy and that is why I was proud to support this bill when it passed the House by a vote of 216-192.\n\nMay 22, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 4763, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. H.R. 4763 creates a framework at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to federally regulate digital asset exchanges, crypto assets, and establishes the position that a digital asset itself is not a security, but that it can be offered as part of a securities contract. The current lack of congressional guidance over cryptocurrency has opened the door for Washington bureaucrats to arbitrarily target crypto companies and exchanges. This bill is crucial in establishing a federal structure for cryptocurrency in order to prevent confusion in the industry. H.R. 4763 passed the House by a vote of 279-136.\n\nMay 21, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 3019, the Federal Prison Oversight Act. H.R. 3019 establishes new independent oversight of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). Specifically, it directs the U.S. Department of Justice Inspector General to give each BOP facility a risk score, with higher scoring facilities requiring more frequent inspection. This bill will help ensure that staffing shortages and safety issues at federal prisons are promptly addressed to keep our correctional officers and prisoners safe and secure. H.R. 3019 passed the House by a vote of 392-2.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 5863, the Federal Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2023. H.R. 5863 would provide tax relief to those impacted by certain disasters, including recent hurricanes, wildfires, and the Ohio train derailment. Tax relief would be exempting compensation for losses from a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income (AGI), as well as deducting losses from their AGI without itemizing their tax returns. I urge the Senate to expeditiously take up this legislation which would provide a lifeline to those in Upstate New York impacted by certain disasters. H.R. 5863 passed the House by a vote of 382-7.\n\nMay 17, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.Res. 1213, A resolution regarding violence against law enforcement officers. H.Res. 1213 expresses condolences to the loved ones of fallen law enforcement officers, acknowledges the tremendous difficulties law enforcement officers face, and condemns calls to defund the police. While I am glad that the overwhelming majority of my colleagues supported this commonsense resolution, I am dismayed that 61 of my Democratic colleagues voted against this resolution. The radical left’s “defund and demoralize the police” movement has increased violence and threats towards law enforcement, and it is a travesty that 61 members of Congress refused to recognize the horrific effect that this movement has had on our law enforcement community. Rest assured that I will always Back the Blue and support those who keep our communities safe. H.Res. 1213 passed the House by a vote of 337-61.\n\nMay 16, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 8369, the Israel Security Assistance Support Act. Recently, the Biden administration chose to unnecessarily delay the distribution of lethal aid to Israel, including various defense systems. This delay potentially violated the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which requires the administration to obligate and expend aid appropriated by Congress without delay, unless it goes through a formal notification process that the Biden administration failed to do. That is why I led a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland demanding a special counsel be appointed to investigate and prosecute any wrongdoing. In addition to holding the Biden administration accountable, we must ensure this aid is distributed to Israel expeditiously. That is why I am a cosponsor of the Israel Security Assistance Support Act which will prevent the Biden administration from unnecessarily delaying aid to Israel. H.R. 8369 passed the House by a vote of 224-187.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 8146, the Police Our Border Act. The Biden administration’s border crisis has created new threats and challenges for our brave law enforcement officers. H.R. 8146 requires the U.S. Department of Justice to report to Congress on how the Biden border crisis has affected law enforcement. This includes details on the financial and operations burdens as a result of greater exposure to fentanyl, crimes committed by illegal aliens, and the impact on morale. We must do more to protect our law enforcement officers from the dire consequences of the Biden border catastrophe. H.R. 8146 passed the House by a vote of 254-157.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 354, the LEOSA Reform Act of 2024. Our brave law enforcement officers work tirelessly to keep our communities safe, both when on-duty and off-duty. The LEOSA Reform Act would allow qualified active and retired law enforcement officers to concealed carry in areas where concealed carry is traditionally prohibited, such as national parks and federal facilities. Law enforcement officers have proven their trustworthiness and ability to keep our communities safe and should not be unnecessarily restricted from carrying a concealed weapon that could be used to save lives. H.R. 354 passed the House by a vote of 221-185.\n\nMay 15, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 7530, the DC CRIMES Act of 2024. The Council of the District of Columbia’s pro-criminal policies have led to skyrocketing crime in our nation’s capital. In 2023, crime increased 30 percent over 2022, homicides have doubled since 2012, and motor vehicle thefts have doubled since 2022. In response to this crime epidemic, the D.C. Council chose to redefine “youth” under criminal law, so individuals 25 and younger could not be charged as adults. H.R. 7530 would restore the definition of “youth” under D.C. law to 18 years old and prohibit the D.C. Council from enacting any changes to criminal liability sentencing guidelines. We cannot allow the D.C. Council to continue turning our nation’s capital into a safe haven for criminals. H.R. 7530 passed the House by a vote of 225-181.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.Res. 1210, Condemning the Biden border crisis and the tremendous burdens law enforcement officers face as a result. Due to the Biden administration’s radical open border policies, every community has turned into a border community and faced a surge in crime. Unvetted illegal aliens have flooded our communities, including those involved in fentanyl trafficking and human trafficking. This has placed a tremendous strain on law enforcement to clean up the Biden administration’s mess. I am disappointed that so many of my Democratic colleagues declined to support this commonsense resolution that stands with law enforcement. H.Res. 1210 passed the House by a vote of 223-185.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 7581, Improving Law Enforcement Officer Safety and Wellness Through Data Act. Law enforcement officers across the United States face increasing threats and violence due to the radical “defund and demoralize the police” movement. However, we currently lack sufficient data to determine the best methods to address the physical and mental impacts of this violence on our law enforcement officers. H.R. 7581 will require the U.S. Department of Justice to develop reports related to violent attacks on law enforcement, the efficacy of current data collection, and the efficacy of existing programs to support law enforcement officers. This commonsense bill will improve our ability to support law enforcement officers and ensure they have every tool necessary to protect our communities. H.R. 7581 passed the House by a vote of 356-55.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 7343, the Detain and Deport Illegal Aliens Who Assault Cops Act. In January 2024, an illegal alien who assaulted two NYPD officers was released without bail and fled New York’s jurisdiction. H.R. 7343 would ensure that any illegal alien who assaults a law enforcement officer is detained and deported by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. We cannot continue allowing violent illegal aliens to remain in the United States. H.R. 7343 passed the House by a vote of 265-141.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 4510, the NTIA Reauthorization Act, which reauthorizes the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). This bill will significantly bolster America’s technological capacity by increasing spectrum management, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. Additionally, it requires the NTIA to establish an interagency process to consider the law enforcement and national security implications of foreign ownership interests when licensing or authorizing telecommunications systems and infrastructure. It is long overdue that Congress moved forward with a comprehensive spectrum strategy. Passing this critical piece of legislation is a step in the right direction to ensure America's connectivity future. H.R. 4510 passed the House by a vote of 374-36.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 1797, the Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Batteries Act. This bill will set federal standards to protect against the risk of fires from lithium-ion batteries. Specifically, it will require the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to set standards for lithium-ion batteries for micromobility devices, including battery chargers, charging cables, external terminals on battery packs, external terminals on micromobility devices, and free-standing stations used for recharging. Particularly due to the increasing adoption of these devices, it is clear that unregulated lithium-ion batteries pose an escalating threat to the public’s safety. H.R. 1797 passed the House by a vote of 378-34.\n\nI voted “Yes” on the Senate Amendment to H.R. 3935, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024. H.R. 3935 reauthorizes the functions of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) through FY2028, including activities and programs related to aerospace innovation, airport planning and development, facilities and equipment, and operations. In addition, it includes an amendment I led with Representatives Langworthy and Higgins to preserve the 1,500-hour flight requirement for pilots. The 1,500-hour requirement was passed in 2010 in response to the 2009 Colgan Air Flight 3407 crash in Clarence, NY, that killed all 49 individuals on board and one person on the ground. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined in its accident report that the crash could have been avoided if the pilots had received additional training in effectively handling a stalled aircraft. Ultimately, H.R. 3935 will support passenger safety on aircrafts, bolster the aviation workforce, and ensure that American skies remain the safest in the world. H.R. 3935 passed the House with a bipartisan majority of 387-26.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 4581, the Maternal and Child Health Stillbirth Prevention Act of 2023. H.R. 4581 clarifies that current funding through the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Services Block Grant may be used for stillbirth prevention activities. Approximately 21,000 babies are stillborn in the United States a year, 1,400 of which occur in New York. For the United States, with one of the most advanced health care systems in the world, this is a shocking and unacceptable reality. This bill builds on the success of the MCH Block Grant program by expanding its scope to include critical research and evidence-based programs and activities to reduce the rate of stillbirth. H.R. 4581 passed the House with a bipartisan majority of 408-3.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 4310, the Youth Poisoning Protection Act. H.R. 4310 would ban the consumer sale of products containing high concentrations of sodium nitrite, a meat-curing chemical that can be lethal when ingested. A 2021 report revealed that an online suicide forum was promoting sodium nitrite as an easily accessible method for suicide. The forum, masquerading as a safe space for discussing suicidal thoughts, contained threads where anonymous users share detailed methods and real-time guidance on using sodium nitrite to die by suicide. This legislation is a proactive step in addressing the ongoing mental health crisis among children and young people in our country and eliminates toxic consumer products that are used for self-harm. H.R. 4310 passed the House with a bipartisan majority of 376-33.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 6960, the Emergency Medical Services for Children Reauthorization Act of 2024. H.R. 6960 reauthorizes through FY2029 the Emergency Medical Services for Children State Partnership Program, which is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration. The program awards grants to state governments and medical schools to support emergency medical services for children who need treatment for trauma or critical care. This four-decades old program is the only federal grant program specifically focused on addressing the needs and challenges of children in emergency departments (ED) and will ensure continued access to ED services for children in NY-24. H.R. 6960 passed the House with a bipartisan majority of 399-13.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 6572, the Deploying American Blockchains Act of 2023. H.R. 6572 directs the Secretary of Commerce to take necessary actions to promote the competitiveness of the United States related to the deployment, use, application, and competitiveness of blockchain technology or other distributed ledger technology. This legislation will foster competitiveness and innovation for new technologies, like blockchain, and ensure the United States can outcompete China in the 21st century. H.R. 6572 passed the House with a bipartisan majority of 334-79.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 6571, the Promoting Resilient Supply Chains Act of 2023. H.R. 6571 establishes a critical supply chain resiliency and crisis response program in the Department of Commerce, which will help promote American leadership in deploying emerging technologies. This initiative would establish a comprehensive government-wide strategy to map, monitor, and proactively strengthen American supply chains, which will bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States and reduce costs for New Yorkers for essential consumer products. H.R. 6571 passed the House with a bipartisan majority of 390-19.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 3950, the Transparency In Charges for Key Events Ticketing Act or “TICKET Act”. H.R. 3950 requires ticket sellers to clearly and prominently disclose the total ticket price and an itemized list of fees (e.g., service, processing, delivery, facility charge, tax, or other charges) at the start of the transaction and before a ticket is selected. This total ticket price must also be included in any advertisements, marketing materials, or price lists. Additional fees at the end of a transaction frustrates and confuses fans who expect the listed ticket price to be the final amount they will pay. H.R. 3950 passed the House with a bipartisan majority of 388-24.\n\nMay 14, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on S. 546, the Recruit and Retain Act. S. 546 would expand the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant program to include recruitment and retention efforts. It would also establish the COPS Pipeline Partnership Program to support partnerships between local schools and law enforcement agencies as a means to improve recruitment. This bill strongly supports recruitment and retention efforts by our local law enforcement officers which will help keep our communities safer. S. 546 passed the House by a vote of 370-18.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 7659, the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act of 2024. H.R. 7659 reauthorizes the U.S. Coast Guard through fiscal year 2026 and includes many important programs for drug and human trafficking interdiction, as well as search and rescue operations. The U.S. Coast Guard provides vital services for many NY-24 communities on Lake Ontario and the surrounding shoreline. We must continue to support our Coast Guard and ensure they have the resources they need to bolster our national security and lakefront communities. H.R. 7659 passed the House by a vote of 376-16.\n\nMay 8, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on S. 870, the Fire Grants and Safety Act. S. 870 reauthorizes the United States Fire Administration, the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) program, and the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grants (SAFER) program. The AFG and SAFER programs are critical to local fire departments, who use these programs to procure the equipment they need to serve our communities. I strongly supported the passage of this legislation through the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee and have consistently advocated for additional funding for these programs. I urge the President to expeditiously sign this bill into law so we can continue supporting our local fire departments. S. 870 passed the House by a vote of 393-13, with one member voting present.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 4143, the National Construction Safety Team Enhancement Act of 2023. H.R. 4143 would allow the National Institute of Standards and Technology National Construction Safety Teams to investigate structural failures that caused loss of life or risked loss of life. This would allow the National Construction Safety Teams to learn from previous structural collapses to help with recommendations to prevent future collapses. I supported this bill when it passed unanimously through the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee and supported its passage on the House floor. H.R. 4143 passed the House by a vote of 358-41.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 7109, the Equal Representation Act. H.R. 7109 would codify the Trump administration’s efforts to add a citizenship question to the census and exclude non-citizens for the purpose of congressional reapportionment. As required by the Constitution, every ten years, the census counts the number of individuals living in the United States and the number of congressional seats allocated to each state is reapportioned based on these numbers. However, there is currently no way to determine how many of these individuals are citizens or non-citizens. H.R. 7109 would add this as a question to the census so we can better understand how many non-citizens, including illegal aliens, are currently residing in the United States. Additionally, this bill would ensure that non-citizens are not counted during congressional reapportionment, which would remove the benefit that states like California receive by counting illegal aliens. I am honored to cosponsor this important bill and strongly supported its passage through the House. H.R. 7109 passed the House by a vote of 206-202.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 2925, the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act of 2024. In May of 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed a lower court decision revoking an approved mine plan for the Rosemont Copper Mine Project, partially located in the Coronado National Forest in Arizona, known as the “Rosemont decision.” The Rosemont decision reinterprets key facets of the Mining Law of 1872 and upends longstanding precedent by requiring mining operators to prove public lands contain commercially developable mineral deposits. If allowed to stand, the Rosemont decision would impact hardrock mining projects across Western states since the mineral-rich states of Alaska, Arizona, Nevada, Montana, and Idaho are located within the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit. H.R. 2925 provides much-needed certainty for domestic hardrock mining operators by codifying longstanding regulatory practices and legal interpretation regarding use, occupancy, and operations on public lands. Domestic mining of hardrock and critical minerals ensures we are not reliant on adversarial nations like China for the technologies essential to Americans’ everyday lives. H.R. 2925 passed the House by a vote of 216-195.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 8289, the Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2024. Currently, the authorization for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operations and programs is set to expire on May 10, 2024. While there is currently legislation under consideration in the Senate that will authorize and update these program for five years, it will need additional time to move through the legislative process. H.R. 8289 extends FAA authorization through May 17, 2024, allowing this to take place. This bill passed the House by a vote of 385-24, with one member voting present.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.J.Res. 109, Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to \"Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121\". H.J.Res. 109 disapproves of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), a Biden administration rule that weakens consumer protections, impedes financial innovation, and hinders competition. SAB 121 requires public companies, including banks, that safeguard digital assets for their customers to record the value of those consumer-owned assets on their balance sheets. This treatment of digital assets held in custody on behalf of a bank’s customers deviates from traditional custodial practices. Recording the value of consumer-owned digital assets on a bank’s balance sheets will increase capital and liquidity costs, which will ultimately be passed onto the American consumer. Further, SAB 121 prevents financial institutions from engaging in digital asset custody, which leaves Americans’ assets vulnerable if a custodian becomes insolvent or enters receivership. H.J.Res. 109 passed the House by a vote of 228-182.\n\nI voted “Yes” on the Motion to Table H.Res. 1209, Declaring the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives to be vacant. As Speaker, Mike Johnson has remained committed to our Constitutional conservative values and has brought principled steady leadership to the House of Representatives. We cannot afford to descend back into the chaos of choosing a new Speaker while so much of our country is in jeopardy. This would inhibit the House Republican Majority from holding the Biden administration accountable and fighting to save America from dangerous far-left policies. I stand with President Trump and nearly all of my Republican colleagues who wholly opposed the motion to vacate Speaker Johnson and I believe that we must remain united and focused as we head to November. The Motion to Table H.Res. 1209 passed the House by a vote of 359-43 with seven members voting present.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 3354, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 220 North Hatcher Avenue in Purcellville, Virginia, as the \"Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Post Office Building\". Albright came to the United States from Eastern Europe at the age of two after the Nazis invaded her birth country of Czechoslovakia. Her career in government included serving as a staffer in the United States Senate, the Ambassador to the United Nations, and as the first female U.S. Secretary of State. H.R. 3354 passed the House by a vote of 371-28, with three members voting present.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 6192, the Hands Off Our Home Appliances Act. H.R. 6192 would prevent the Biden administration from banning household appliances that run on natural gas. Unfortunately, President Biden has continued to wage an out-of-touch war on America’s home appliances. Since he took office, the Department of Energy has unleashed an onslaught of new regulations for home appliances such as stoves, dishwashers, showers, toilets, heaters, and furnaces. These actions from the Biden administration are not based in science and will only serve to increase costs for hardworking Americans. H.R. 6192 passed the House by a vote of 212-195.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 7423, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 103 Benedette Street in Rayville, Louisiana, as the \"Luke Letlow Post Office Building\". A devoted businessman and public servant, Letlow was elected to the United States House of Representatives for Louisiana’s 5th Congressional District in 2020. Tragically, he lost his life before he was able to take office due to complications caused by the COVID-19 virus. Letlow worked as a staffer for Bobby Jindal in both the United States House of Representatives and during Jindal’s first term as governor of Louisiana. Later, Letlow served as campaign manager and chief of staff for Ralph Abraham during his tenure in Congress. I was glad to see this bill pass the House by a vote of 401-0, with two members voting present.\n\nMay 7, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on the veto message for H.J.Res. 98, Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the National Labor Relations Board relating to \"Standard for Determining Joint Employer Status\". This resolution would overturn the Biden administration’s radical joint-employer rule that will harm small businesses and kill jobs. The Biden administration’s rule vastly expands the definition of “joint employer” to include all businesses that share “indirect” or “potential” control of an employee, even if they do not actually exercise this control. This rule was initially proposed by the Obama administration, and it raised operational costs by $33 billion and killed 376,000 jobs in the franchise sector alone. H.J.Res. 98 required a two-thirds majority to pass and failed in the House by a vote of 214-191.\n\nMay 6, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 7219, the Information Quality Assurance Act. H.R. 7219 will improve the federal rule making process, updating existing requirements so federal agencies are required to use the best available information to develop, issue, or inform the public of the nature and basis of rules and guidance. It would also require agencies to make that information publicly available as an open government data asset that would include methodologies, models, scientific sources, and other forms of information that informed the policy decision. This commonsense change will allow Americans to gather greater insight into how their federal government works and provide more informative feedback to rule makers. H.R. 7219 passed the House by a vote of 377-4.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 7525, the Special District Grant Accessibility Act. Special districts are authorized through state statute to deliver specialized services, like fire stations or waste management, to a district that the local city or county does not provide. As of 2022, there are 39,555 special districts in the United States. However, a special district is not currently defined in U.S. code and is ineligible for direct federal funding or grant programs. As a solution, H.R. 7525 will require the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue guidance requiring special districts to be recognized when agencies are considering federal financial assistance. It is important our vital local services are not left behind. This bill passed the House by a vote of 352-27.\n\nMay 1, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.Res. 1112, Denouncing the Biden administration's immigration policies. The crisis at our southern border is the direct result of President Biden’s radical open-borders policies. This resolution recognizes that the Biden administration’s actions have created the worst border crisis in our nation’s history, denounces these open borders polices, and urges the administration to immediately implement policies to end the crisis. Under President Biden’s watch, more than 9.5 million illegal aliens from around the world, including suspected terrorists, have arrived at our southern border. And during his first 100 days in office, President Biden took almost 100 executive actions on immigration, including halting border wall construction. Additionally, the Biden administration suspended and terminated asylum agreements with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. These agreements, which were entered into during the Trump administration, reduced the incentive for illegal immigration by allowing for the removal of certain aliens seeking asylum. President Biden also halted the successful “Remain in Mexico” program and his administration issued multiple memos limiting enforcement actions that can be taken against illegal aliens. These are examples of how the Biden administration has repeatedly violated federal immigration law, including granting so-called “mass parole” to more than one million people and failing to detain or place aliens in removal proceedings. It is vital that President Biden changes course and starts enforcing our nation’s immigration laws for the sake of our national security. H.Res. 1112 passed the House by a vote of 223-191.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 6285, Alaska’s Right to Produce Act. Since his first day in office, President Biden has waged war on domestic fossil fuels to the detriment of American workers and families. H.R. 6285 reverses the Biden administration’s harmful anti-American energy policies by reinstating the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) oil and gas leases and canceling the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A) rule. DOI was required to hold two lease sales in the 1002 Area of the ANWR – the first by December 2021 and the second by December 2024. The Trump administration held the first lease sale, but the Biden administration cancelled the leases. Earlier this month, DOI announced a rule that would lock up over half of the NPR-A for future energy production. These decisions will have a devastating impact on American jobs and energy production. H.R. 6285 would reverse these harmful actions from the Biden administration. This bill passed the House by a vote of 214-199 with two members voting present.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 6090, the Antisemitism Awareness Act. H.R. 6090 seeks to combat the pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic protests taking over American college campuses by requiring the Department of Education to consider the 2016 International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism and its contemporary examples when reviewing, investigating, or determining whether discrimination has occurred. It further expresses the sense of Congress that discrimination against Jews may violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The IHRA’s working definition of anti-Semitism and its contemporary examples are widely accepted and a vital tool for identifying and addressing discriminatory conduct that is motivated by anti-Semitism. Lastly, H.R. 6090 explicitly states that nothing in the bill “shall be construed to diminish or infringe upon any right protected under the First Amendment”. There can be no tolerance for anti-Semitism at our universities, in our communities, or anywhere across our country. H.R. 6090 passed the House by a vote of 320-91.\n\nApril 30, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 3195, the Superior National Forest Restoration Act. H.R. 3195 halts the Biden administration’s attack on domestic mineral development in Minnesota’s Superior National Forest (SNF). In January 2022, the Biden administration cancelled the two decades old mineral lease held by Twin Metals Minnesota in the SNF. One year later, a public land order went into effect, withdrawing 225,000 acres of land in the SNF from mineral extraction for 20 years. The SNF in northeastern Minnesota contains vast amounts of copper, nickel, cobalt, and platinum, which are vital for manufacturing batteries, electronics, and countless other high-tech items. In order to harness the technologies of the future, it is vital we responsibly mine the materials needed to make them here at home. H.R. 3195 passed the House by a vote of 212-203.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 764, the Trust the Science Act. H.R. 764 would reinstate the Trump administration’s final rule removing the gray wolf as a protected species under the Endangered Species Act in the lower 48 states, where they do not face the threat of extinction. The current gray wolf population exceeds the recovery goal for delisting, which requires a stable or increasing population of wolves in Minnesota and at least 200 wolves outside of Minnesota. However, after the Trump administration published a 2020 rule to delist the gray wolf, an activist judge in California vacated the rule. This decision was so extreme, even the Biden administration is appealing the decision in order to reinstate the rule. H.R. 764 passed the House by a vote of 209-205.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 615, the Protecting Access for Hunters and Anglers Act of 2023. Recently, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) proposed to ban the use of lead ammunition and tackle in seven national wildlife refuges and to ban lead ammunition, but not tackle, in one additional national wildlife refuge by 2026. Lead ammunition and fishing tackle are the most cost-effective options on the market and provide an important revenue source for conservation efforts. In FY2024 alone, FWS received over $1.3 billion in conservation funding from excise taxes on hunting and fishing equipment, including ammunition and fishing tackle. H.R. 615 will prevent this misguided rule from coming into effect, ensuring Americans can continue to enjoy hunting and fishing. This bill passed the House by a vote of 214-201.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 3397, the Western Economic Security Today Act of 2023. H.R. 3397 would stop a recent public lands rule proposed by the Biden administration from coming into effect. Under this proposed rule, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) would be able to lock up certain land under vaguely defined conservation leases, incorporate new standards when evaluating traditional multiple use decisions, and apply land health standards to all public lands. The proposed rule marks a significant shift in public land management that would lock up 10 percent of land in the United States and is an attempt to further the administration’s flawed Green New Deal agenda. Rural communities across the American West rely on access to public lands for economic development, grazing, timber production, and recreation. Stopping the Biden administration’s proposed rule will protect $201 billion in economic output and save 783,000 jobs. H.R. 3397 passed the House by a vote of 212-202.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 1767, the Student Veteran Benefit Restoration Act. H.R. 1767 will safeguard the education benefits of student veterans, requiring the restoration of benefits to any student veteran who was unable to complete their program due to a school closure or determination that the program is ineligible for VA education benefits. The educational institution will then be required to refund all amounts to the VA. Student veterans should not lose out on their hard-earned benefits due to forces outside of their control. H.R. 1767 passed the House by a vote of 406-6.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 4016, the Veteran Fraud Reimbursement Act. H.R. 4016 will help veterans who have suffered from benefits fraud, requiring the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to quickly reimburse affected veterans. The VA will then be responsible for recouping the amount from the perpetrators of the fraud. It is vital to protect veterans and ensure their receipt of benefits does not suffer as a result of fraud. H.R. 4016 passed the House by a vote of 413-0.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 3738, the Veterans Economic Opportunity and Transition Administration Act. Currently, the Veterans Benefits Administration is responsible for all Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits provided to veterans outside of health care and cemetery services. However, the bulk of staffing and resources have been directed toward the administration of disability compensation and pension claims. As a result, other benefits, such as transition assistance, vocational rehabilitation, and the Forever GI Bill, have received less attention. H.R. 3738 would address this issue by aligning transition, education, and employment programs in a separate wing within the VA. This will modernize the VA and give the aforementioned programs the proper attention and oversight they deserve without increasing bureaucracy. H.R. 3738 passed the House by a vote of 403-10.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 529, the Extending Limits of U.S. Customs Waters Act. H.R. 529 would formally extend authorities for the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to perform law enforcement activities from 12 nautical miles to 24 nautical miles off the coast. New technologies have allowed CBP and USCG to interdict ships further off our nation’s coast, allowing them to catch human traffickers and drug smugglers further from shore. This commonsense bill will help keep our nation safe and support law enforcement’s ability to catch criminals. H.R. 529 passed the House by a vote of 402-6.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 4824, the Carbon Sequestration Collaboration Act. H.R. 4824 would expand certain research activities on carbon dioxide sequestration conducted by the Department of Energy to include terrestrial carbon sequestration and carbon sequestration in geological formations. I support an all-of-the-above energy approach, which includes coal and natural gas. Investing in carbon sequestration technology will allow us to continue taking advantage of the vital energy produced by coal and natural gas. H.R. 4824 passed the House by a vote of 364-44.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 4877, the Abandoned Well Remediation Research and Development Act. H.R. 4877 would direct the Department of Energy to carry out a research, development, and demonstration program on plugging and remediating abandoned oil and gas wells. Abandoned oil and gas wells can pose environmental and health challenges for local communities. Programs like this will invest in research solutions for plugging and remediating these abandoned wells to protect our communities. H.R. 4877 passed the House by a vote of 333-75.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 6093, the Weather Act Reauthorization Act. H.R. 6093 would reauthorize weather forecasting and emergency preparedness activities related to extreme weather events. Programs included in this bill are critical to New York’s 24th District, as they help us prepare for the extreme lake-effect snow and give our farmers the tools to navigate various adverse weather events. I was honored to vote to reauthorize these programs when this bill passed unanimously through the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee and was honored to support it once again on the House floor. H.R. 6093 passed the House by a vote of 394-19.\n\nApril 29, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 4755, the Privacy Enhancing Technology Research Act. H.R. 4755 would require the National Science Foundation to award research grants to projects that enhance privacy and security for personally identifiable information that may be collected. Congress must do more to protect Americans’ private, sensitive data and this bill works to create the technological solutions to solve this critical issue. I voted in favor of this bill’s passage through the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee and once again on the House floor. H.R. 4755 passed the House by a vote of 354-36.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 4866, the Fire Weather Development Act of 2024. H.R. 4866 would require the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to collaborate with other federal, state, and local stakeholders to undertake activities to improve wildfire forecasting, detection, and communication. Improving wildfire forecasting and detection will help protect communities across the country and save taxpayers billions of dollars in emergency response costs. I supported this legislation when it passed the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and was pleased to support it again when it passed the full House of Representatives. H.R. 4866 passed the House by a vote of 341-48.\n\nApril 20, 2024\n\nI voted “No” on H.R. 8035, the Ukraine Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2024. First and foremost, I strongly support the people of Ukraine in its fight against Putin’s bloody, unprovoked, and unjust war. Russia’s continued targeting of civilians and kidnapping of Ukrainian children is horrifying, and I continue to support the besieged people of Ukraine. However, I have been adamant that we must have a strategic plan from the President outlining U.S. strategy in Ukraine, the long-term cost and outlook of the war, and clearly defining our strategic interests and objectives in Ukraine. The President’s current lack of a strategic plan is extremely concerning. That is why I cosponsored the Define the Mission Act to require this plan. While I am pleased that this bill requires a similar strategic plan from the Administration, we should not be appropriating an addition $60 billion for Ukraine before Congress has an opportunity to review this plan. Further, we must address the underlying policies that led to this war by the United States and our European partners. Our European allies’ radical green energy policies and Biden’s ban on liquid natural gas exports continue to cause Europe to rely on Russian energy, which funds Putin’s brutal war and gives Putin leverage. Finally, our European partners must contribute more to the war in Ukraine. While the American people have already contributed hundreds of billions to Ukraine’s defense, the Europeans have yet to match American contributions. Europe must do more to address its own security and energy needs. While I could not support this supplemental at this time as a result of the lack of a strategic plan, Europe’s unequal contribution, and refusal to address Biden and Europe’s energy policies, I continue urging the Biden administration to address these issues so we can bring long-term peace and stability to Ukraine and Eastern Europe at-large. This bill passed by a vote of 311-112, with one voting present.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 8035, the Israel Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2024. I wholeheartedly support Israel in its war against Hamas and its defense against Iran. On October 7, the world watched in horror as Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists brutalized, tortured, kidnapped, raped, and killed Israeli civilians. The United States must continue to resolutely stand with our greatest ally in the Middle East, the lone beacon of freedom and democracy in the region. This bill also included an important provision to ensure that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) does not receive any U.S. funding. UNRWA has not only promoted hate against Israel in its schools, UNRWA employees actively supported the October 7th attack and some employees even participated. However, I am outraged that this bill contains billions of dollars for aid in Gaza. Unfortunately, a large portion of aid that enters Gaza ends up in the hands of Hamas and continues to help fuel this war between good and evil. That is why I supported numerous amendments submitted to the House Rules Committee to strip this aid out. While I am disappointed that these amendments were not ruled in order, it is critical that the United States immediately provides support to Israel. I will continue my rigorous oversight efforts to ensure this aid does not support our terrorist adversaries and I call on the Biden administration to abandon its rhetoric condemning Israel for its war against Hamas. Israel must do everything in its power to eliminate Hamas and rescue the remaining hostages in Gaza. This bill passed by a vote of 366-58.\n\nApril 18, 2024\n\nI voted “No” on H.R. 4639, the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act. I strongly support every U.S. citizens’ Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures. However, this overly broad legislation goes far beyond this established constitutional protection and would significantly hinder law enforcement’s ability to function. This bill would prohibit law enforcement from procuring any commercially available data without a warrant. It would include sources as simple as a phone book, significantly delaying and impeding law enforcement’s ability to track criminals and help victims. Major law enforcement groups such as the National Association of Police Officers (NAPO) and the International Association of Police Chiefs strongly opposed this bill, joining conservative groups such as Heritage Action which also opposed its passage. It is unsurprising that this bill was supported by the Members of Congress supportive the radical Defund and Demoralize the Police movement, such as Representatives Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, and Tlaib. One-party rule in Albany has already forced so many restrictions on our law enforcement officers, such as Bail Reform, the Green Light Law, and Discovery Reform, that we cannot afford to create additional impediments for these officers to do their jobs. I will always stand with our law enforcement heroes and fight for them as they risk their lives to serve our communities. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 219-199, with 1 voting present.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.Res. 1143, Condemning Iran’s unprecedented drone and missile attack on Israel. This resolution condemns Iran’s recent attacks on Israel, reaffirms and supports Israel’s right to self-defense, and urges full enforcement of the United States’ sanctions and export controls against Iran and its proxies. As Iran, one of the world’s leading State Sponsors of Terror, continues to attack one of our greatest allies, we must stand united in support of Israel and condemn the brutal Iranian mullahs that orchestrated last weekend’s attack. I am disgusted that 14 Members of Congress couldn’t find it within themselves to condemn this unprecedented attack. I cosponsored this important resolution to send a clear message that the United States will always stand with Israel and against the Ayatollah’s despotic regime. This resolution passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 404-14.\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 6245, the Holding Iranian Leaders Accountable Act of 2023. For years, Iranian government officials and affiliated terrorist leaders have been financing the Iranian regime’s malign and terrorist activities around the world. To address this issue, H.R. 6245 would require the President to submit a report to Congress on the assets of certain Iranian government officials and proxy terrorist entities. In addition, it would require the Department of Treasury to seek the closure of U.S. and foreign bank accounts connected to those assets. This would help sever a key source of terrorist funding. H.R. 6245 passed the House by a vote of 419-4.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 6015, the Iran Sanctions Accountability Act of 2023. On September 11, 2023, the Biden administration waived sanctions on Iran to facilitate a $6 billion transfer in funds to be used for humanitarian efforts. Less than a month later, the Iranian-proxy Hamas launched its deadly October 7th attack on Israel. As such, there are concerns these funds, which were intended for humanitarian purposes, could have been used to fund terrorism. In response, H.R. 6015 would require the President to implement regulations that ensure exemptions for humanitarian aid are not used to facilitate transactions that support terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). In addition, it would require the President to submit reports to Congress on the implementation and efficacy of these regulations. Lastly, it would direct the United States Executive Director at the World Bank to oppose financial assistance to Iran. H.R. 6015 passed the House by a vote of 408-13.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 5917, the Strengthening Tools to Counter the Use of Human Shields Act. H.R. 5917 would help enforce sanctions against terrorist organizations that use civilians as human shields, strengthening existing sanctions on such groups. In addition, it would require the President to respond within 120 days to a request from Congress to determine whether an entity is a terrorist using human shields and submit a written justification for whether the President will or will not impose sanctions on such entity. As Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and other radical Palestinian terror organizations continue to use human shields, Congress must do more to combat this monstrous disregard for human life. I am honored to be a cosponsor of this critical legislation and support its passage. H.R. 5917 passed the House by a vote of 419-4.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 4681, the Illicit Captagon Trafficking Suppression Act of 2023. H.R. 4681 would require the administration to impose sanctions on foreign entities who facilitate or profit from the production or proliferation of Captagon, an amphetamine with no uses approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Despite the many sanctions on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for his role in illegal international narcotrafficking, he has recently been engaged in the international Captagon trade, which does not carry the same sanctions. H.R. 4681 would extend international drug trafficking sanctions to Captagon and close this loophole. The bill passed the House by a vote of 410-13.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 6603, the No Technology for Terror Act. H.R. 6603 would codify export controls for Iran that prohibit the exportation of drone components – such as cameras, censors, and circuits – to Iran without a license from the Department of Commerce. As Iran continues to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to target U.S. troops, our allies, and civilians, we must do more to crack down on Iran’s ability to procure related technologies. I am honored to cosponsor this important bill and support its passage. H.R. 6603 passed the House by a vote of 406-19.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 5826, the No Paydays for Hostage-Takers Act. H.R. 5826 would require a report on whether the $6 billion in unfrozen Iranian assets, released by President Biden in September 2023, was used to fund terrorism. In addition, it would require a sanctions determination for any entity that took American hostages on behalf of Iran. Lastly, it would require the banning of visas for those who support terrorism and assist in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). Under the Biden administration, over $16 billion in frozen assets have been released, allowing Iran to use these funds to fuel the oppression of the Iranian people and terrorism around the world. This critical bill, which I have cosponsored, would require the Biden administration to recognize the immense harm caused by the unfrozen assets and ensure Iranian individuals who participated in taking American hostages are held accountable. H.R. 5826 passed the House by a vote of 391-34.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 3033, the Solidify Iran Sanctions Act of 2023. H.R. 3033 would strengthen existing sanctions on Iran’s energy sector and other key industries by permanently reauthorizing the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996. Currently, these sanctions are set to expire on December 31, 2026. I cosponsored H.R. 3033 because we cannot allow these impactful sanctions to expire, as this would give the Ayatollah and his despotic mullahs access to billions in funds which would be used for terrorism and oppression. This bill passed the House by a vote of 407-16.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.Res. 288, the Encouraging the EU to DESIGNATE Resolution. H.Res. 288, which I introduced, calls on the European Union (EU) to join the United States in listing the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist entity. The IRGC is an Iranian extra-military organization that conducts the Iranian regime’s acts of terrorism and is the link between Ayatollah Khamenei and other terror groups, such as Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and the Houthis out of Yemen. For example, the IRGC Quds Force funds, arms, trains, and supports Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and PIJ. The IRGC Quds Force has also played a key role in Iranian-directed assassinations in the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, France, Germany, Bulgaria, and Cyprus in recent years. But the threat posed by the IRGC is not only abroad. Just a few years ago, the IRGC engaged in a murder-for-hire plot to target former National Security Advisor John Bolton and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. You can read my full Report on IRGC Terrorist Activity here. In 2019, President Trump declared the IRGC a Foreign Terrorist Organization. While this was a tremendous first step, we must encourage our allies, including the EU, to join us in confronting the Iranian threat. H.Res. 288 passed the House by a vote of 411-14.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.Res. 883, Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the slogan, ‘‘from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free’’ is antisemitic and its use must be condemned. The phrase “from the river to the sea” implies that a hypothetical Palestinian state should extend from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, meaning that the State of Israel would be abolished. I cosponsored this resolution because the end result of this undeniably anti-Semitic statement would deny the Jewish people the right to a state in their ancestral homeland. I find it shameful that so many of my colleagues refused to condemn this hateful slogan and support statements calling for the abolition of the State of Israel. H.Res. 883 passed the House by a vote of 377-44, with one member voting present.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 6046, the Standing Against Houthi Aggression Act. H.R. 6046 would require the Houthis, also known as Ansarallah, to be designated as a terrorist organization. The Houthis are a terrorist group that have attacked U.S. ships and commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea and are a partner organization of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The Biden administration recklessly delisted the Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) in 2022, and only relisted them as a Specially Designated Terrorist Group (SDTG) after they began attacking U.S. ships. The SDTG designation does not carry the same sanctions and harshness as an FTO designation. Further, the administration has already signaled a willingness to undo the Houthis’ SDTG classification. I strongly supported this legislation and condemn the Biden administration’s weakness on the Houthis. H.R. 6046 passed the House by a vote of 285-135.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 4691, the Iran Sanctions Relief Review Act of 2023. H.R. 4691 would establish a congressional review process for any presidential action that provides sanctions relief to Iran. This would allow Congress to prevent any further attempts by the Biden administration to unfreeze assets or rejoin the Iran nuclear deal. It would also help enhance congressional oversight as a whole of the Biden administration’s reckless and irresponsible Iran policy. H.R. 4691 passed the House by a vote of 278-141.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 5947, To provide for the rescission of certain waivers and licenses relating to Iran. H.R. 5947, which I cosponsored, would rescind the waiver that allowed $6 billion in frozen assets to be released to Iran. At this unprecedented time, when Iran is funding dozens of terror groups, oppressing its citizens, and even launching direct attacks on Israel, it is unconscionable that the United States would unfreeze assets for this rogue regime. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to expeditiously take up this legislation and refreeze these funds. H.R. 5947 passed the House by a vote of 259-160.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 6323, the Iran Counterterrorism Act of 2023. H.R. 6323, which I cosponsored, would rescind waivers and licenses for sanctions on the Iranian financial sector and prohibit future waivers and licenses, regarding all sanctioned Iranian funds. The Biden administration should no longer be able to grant waivers to Iranian sanctions without sufficient congressional oversight. If passed by the Senate, this legislation will hold Iran accountable and ensure that sanctions on Iran are not arbitrarily lifted. H.R. 6323 passed the House by a vote of 271-147.\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 6408, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to terminate the tax-exempt status of terrorist supporting organizations. In the weeks following the October 7thatrocities committed by Hamas against Israel, our nation has seen a significant increase in anti-Semitism. This includes violent threats, hate speech, and even material support for Hamas terrorists. U.S. taxpayer dollars should never be used to prop up terrorist organizations, such as Hamas. To address this issue, H.R. 6408 would remove the tax-exempt status of any terrorist supporting organization, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. I was honored to support this crucial bill to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars are not used to assist terrorist groups. H.R. 6408 passed the House by a vote of 382-11.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 5923, the Iran-China Energy Sanctions Act of 2023. H.R. 5923 would prohibit U.S. financial institutions from opening or maintaining accounts with any Chinese financial institution engaging in transactions of Iranian petroleum products and any foreign financial institution engaging in transactions of Iranian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In addition, the bill would require the President to determine whether any Chinese financial institution has engaged in a transaction of Iranian petroleum products, or whether any foreign financial institution has engaged in a transaction of Iranian UAVs. Over the past few years, China has developed a system to bypass sanctions on Iran and Russia, giving these regimes the funds they need to further destabilize global order and undermine human rights. It is important we crack down on this behavior and ensure stiff penalties for entities that attempt to subvert international sanctions. H.R. 5923 passed the House by a vote of 383-11.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 5921, the No U.S. Financing for Iran act of 2023. H.R. 5921 would require the Department of Treasury to end funds from the United States and the International Monetary Fund to Iran or any entity owned or controlled by the Government of Iran, with only certain humanitarian exemptions to aid civilians. This bill will help sever Iran’s ability to finance terrorism and I urge the Senate to take it up immediately. H.R. 5921 passed the House by a vote of 294-105.\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\n​​I voted “Yes” on H.R. 7888, the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act. At a time when our adversaries are ramping up their military capabilities and seeking to orchestrate attacks on our homeland, we must ensure that our intelligence community has the capabilities to swiftly counteract and prevent terrorist attacks. Section 702, which applies only to foreigners outside the United States, is the most critical tool to keeping America safe. It plays an invaluable role in countering cyber attacks, hindering the flow of deadly fentanyl into our country, and averting threats from China, Iran, and foreign terrorist organizations. In addition, our Republican Majority is committed to preventing another Russia Hoax FISA disaster and ensuring that FISA can no longer be abused to target Americans and political adversaries. The abuses by the FBI have been outrageous and unlawful. That is why I support Representative Mike Garcia’s condemnation of FBI Director Wray for failing to uphold the law and holding those who violated our laws accountable. As a solution to this abuse, this legislation provides 56 reforms to the current law, including reducing the number of FBI agents who can perform Section 702 searches by 90 percent and enhancing criminal penalties for those who violate FISA, leak FISA applications, or lie to the FISA Court. This bill does not include a dangerous proposal that would have undermined the entire purpose of Section 702 through granting Fourth Amendment rights to foreign nationals by requiring a warrant to search foreign surveillance data already lawfully collected by our national security agencies. Under existing law, national security agencies already require a warrant to collect data and take any action against U.S. citizens. This amendment would hamper important law enforcement efforts to protect Americans and would further the radical Defund and Demoralize the Police movement that has been codified by New York’s Greenlight and Bail Reform laws. Approximately 90 percent of individuals on the terror watchlist who have crossed the border illegally have gone through our northern border, leaving New York particularly vulnerable to terror threats. Section 702 is a critical tool for law enforcement to protect New Yorkers and all Americans. By not reauthorizing a substantially reformed Section 702, we would have allowed our foreign adversaries to plan terrorist attacks and undermine our national security without our knowledge. We cannot give our enemies the ability to undermine our freedoms and orchestrate attacks on our soil. As a constitutional lawyer, I remain dedicated to protecting our civil liberties and privacy while defending our national security. The legislation effectively reforms Section 702, which was made by and supported by President Trump in 2017, and I was honored to support its passage. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 273-147.\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on S. 382, the Puyallup Tribe of Indians Land Into Trust Confirmation Act of 2023. The Puyallup Tribe of Indians is a federally recognized tribe located in western Washington state. S. 382 places 17.26 acres of land owned by the tribe into trust, while preventing gaming on the land. In addition, due to pre-existing contamination of the land, the bill clarifies that the United States will not be held liable for any contamination of the land that is taken into trust. S. 382 ensures American taxpayers are not held liable for the cleanup of the land, while also giving the tribe the land it needs to pursue economic development and job creation opportunities. The bill passed the House by a vote of 401-15.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 2560, the Sea Turtle Rescue Assistance and Rehabilitation Act of 2023. H.R. 2560 would require the Department of Commerce to establish the Sea Turtle Rescue Assistance and Rehabilitation Grant Program. The program would award grants for the recovery, care, transportation, and treatment of stranded marine turtles, the release of rescued marine turtles, the collection of data for scientific research related to marine turtle health, and associated facility operations costs. Grants would be limited to $150,000 over a 12-month period, and the non-federal share of any costs of an activity conducted with a grant award would be at least 50 percent, ensuring strong community buy-in. It is a thoughtful step to help these endangered animals without burdensome regulations on landowners and localities. H.R. 2560 passed the House by a vote of 332-82.\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 3250, the National Museum of Play Recognition Act. H.R. 3250 designates the Margaret Woodbury Strong Museum in Rochester as the National Museum of Play. Margaret Strong, who lived from 1897 to 1969, was a prolific collector of dolls and toys, and amassed more than 27,000 dolls during her lifetime. Since the museum officially opened to the public in 1982, it has grown to more than 375,000 square feet, including the National Toy Hall of Fame and the World Video Game Hall of Fame. H.R. 3250 recognizes the National Museum of Play’s vital role in preserving the changing ways in which American children play. The bill passed the House by a vote of 385-31.\n\nApril 9, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 6655, the A Stronger Workforce for America Act. H.R. 6655 would reauthorize certain programs that support workforce training and career services for adults, dislocated workers, and youth. In particular, the bill would reauthorize the Job Corps and YouthBuild programs and would enact key reforms to the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), such as imposing more robust accountability and performance requirements. I am honored to represent the Iroquois Job Corps Center in Medina, which educates youth on career paths in the trades, including masonry, electrical work, and construction. Programs authorized by H.R. 6655 play a key role in supporting our local economy and our national security and I will always be a tireless advocate for those seeking the dignity of work. H.R. 6655 passed the House by a vote of 378-26.\n\nI voted “Yes” on S. 2051, the Missing Children's Assistance Reauthorization Act. S. 2051 reauthorizes the Missing Children’s Assistance Act and improves the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). Specifically, the bill would improve NCMEC’s ability to: assist law enforcement to identify, locate, and recover missing and exploited children; develop educational materials to reduce the risk of child sex trafficking, online enticement, sexual extortion, and cyberbullying; provide education and technical assistance on conducting background checks on individuals working with children; offer support services to missing and exploited children and their families; and facilitate requests to have child sexual abuse material removed from the internet. Congress must continue doing everything it can to combat child exploitation and this bill is an important step in helping our nation’s missing and exploited youth. S. 2051 passed the House by a vote of 406-0.\n\nMarch 22, 2024\n\nI voted “No” on H.Res. 1102, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024. H.Res. 1102 includes funding for Defense, Financial Services and General Government, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, the Legislative Branch, and State and Foreign Operations. Crafted at the last minute, this sprawling 1,012-page bill spends $1.2 trillion of taxpayer dollars and fails to include numerous priorities House Republicans supported during the appropriations process. H.Res. 1102 does not include critical initiatives to bolster border security, such as reinstating President Trump’s effective policy of \"Remain in Mexico,\" and it fails to end President Biden's disastrous catch-and-release policy. Further it fails to sufficiently curtail funding for President Biden's woke agenda, and fails to halt President Biden's unlawful student loan program. Once again, instead of instituting a serious cut to excessive federal spending, Congress was forced to vote on a massive spending bill that perpetuates President Biden's policies that are detrimental to hardworking Americans. While this bill had positive aspects, including a $27 billion increase to critical national defense efforts, this legislation was not enough to protect the American people. I could not, in good faith, support legislation that did not provide relief to hardworking families in New York’s 24th Congressional District. H.Res. 1102 passed the House by a vote of 286-134.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 1023, to repeal section 134 of the Clean Air Act, relating to the greenhouse gas reduction fund. H.R. 1023 would repeal the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and its proposed natural gas tax that would increase energy costs for all Americans. In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act provided the EPA with $26.97 billion, three times the EPA’s entire FY23 budget. However, with a spending deadline of September 2024, there have been concerns this rushed timeline will lead to the EPA spending these funds on bad projects, wasting taxpayer money. There have also been concerns the EPA is giving much of these funds to politically well-connected groups whose founders support Democrat politicians. Regarding the natural gas tax, there are concerns that the annual cost will amount to as much as $65 billion, while only reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions by 2.6 percent. This will be an extraordinary cost to the average American’s energy bill without any noticeable environmental benefit. It will also make many wells in the United States uneconomical, requiring our nation to focus on energy produced in countries with fewer environmental regulations. These policies are wasteful, poorly designed, and harmful to American taxpayers; they deserve to be repealed. H.R. 1023 passed the House by a vote of 209-204.\n\nMarch 21, 2024\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.Res. 987, Denouncing the harmful, anti-American energy policies of the Biden administration, and for other purposes. H.Res. 987 reaffirms House Republicans’ uniform opposition to the Biden administration’s disastrous energy policies. On President Biden's first day in office, his administration, along with fellow Democrats in Congress, launched an unprecedented war on American energy. This included eliminating the Keystone pipeline, a pause on all pending approvals of liquified natural gas exports, and an attempted ban on gas-powered vehicles. At a time when energy prices have increased by approximately $10,000 per American household in three years, we must do everything possible to drive down prices for consumers. The Biden administration attempting to force through radical Green New Deal policies at the expense of Americans’ wallets is wrong. H.Res. 987 passed the House by a vote of 217-200.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.Con.Res. 86, Expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy. H.Con.Res. 86 reiterates the sense that a carbon tax would pose great harm to American energy production and our economy as a whole. A tax on emissions from sources that comprise approximately 80 percent of all the United States’ energy supply and production would have severe effects across all sectors, resulting in diminished economic growth and higher costs for households and consumers. American leadership and innovation in energy production, including from carbon-based sources, has grown the economy while simultaneously reducing consumer costs. A carbon tax would only serve to hurt Americans and cause consumer prices to rise. H.Con.Res. 86 passed the House by a vote of 222-196.\n\nI voted “Yes” on H.R. 1836, the Ocean Shipping Reform Implementation Act of 2023. H.R. 1836 combats Chinese influence in the United States’ shipping industry. Specifically, the bill prohibits port authorities from using Chinese state-affiliated transportation logistics platforms. It is essential that we enhance the Federal Maritime Commission's authority to address market manipulation, especially from bad actors like China. H"
