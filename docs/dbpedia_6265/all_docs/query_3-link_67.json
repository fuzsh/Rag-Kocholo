' 1973b(b), contains a formula defining jurisdictions subject to, or \"covered\" by, special remedial provisions of the Act. The special provisions are discussed below. Jurisdictions are covered if they used a \"test or device\" for voting and less than half of voting age residents were registered or voted in the 1964, 1968, or 1972 presidential elections.
